        "text": "The premise of “Top Gun: Maverick” is that America decides, on its own initiative, and possibly just for fun, to liquidate a uranium-enriching facility of a hostile power. What the effect of this attack might be on the combustible politics of the region in question matters not a jot. The mission justifies itself. After all, it means that Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise), known as Maverick, can rejoin the fighting fray.\n\nIt’s been thirty-six years since we last met Maverick, in “Top Gun,” during which time he has zoomed up the ranks all the way from lieutenant to captain. He is the Dorian Gray of the U.S. Navy, kept forever young by his grin-powered talent for insubordination. When a colleague says, “I don’t like that look, Mav,” he replies, “It’s the only one I got.” As the movie begins, he ignores orders and takes a hypersonic jet out for an early-morning spin at Mach 10, to the fury of Admiral Cain (Ed Harris). Three points: (1) Only Harris could stand firm, as if hewn from the living rock, in the downdraft of a hypersonic jet; (2) The limit-busting flight, and its aftermath, are a straight steal from Sam Shepard’s daredevilry at the end of “The Right Stuff” (1983); (3) Is it just me, or does this new Maverickian sequence, much of it filmed on high in the dark dawn of the heavens, not glow with a genuine beauty?\n\nThe cinematographer is Claudio Miranda, and the director is Joseph Kosinski, although the movie’s Olympian creator, you might say, is Cruise. He’s right there, in total possession of the screen, both in closeup—with helmet, in the cockpit of a plane, or, if you prefer, without helmet, astride a motorbike—and in half length, stripped to the waist, playing football on the beach. The other players are his pupils. No kidding: upbraided and disgraced for his jinks at Mach 10, Maverick becomes a teacher. True, he’s back at Top Gun, schooling the latest hot shots, and prepping them for the blitz abroad, but still. Picture a film called “Bullitt 2: Parking on a Hill,” in which Steve McQueen returns as a driving instructor.\n\nThe eager young warriors in Maverick’s class are addressed by their call signs: Phoenix, Coyote, Payback, Fanboy, and so on, not forgetting the glamorous Bob. Of particular note are Hangman—the very model of a cocky bastard, portrayed with spirited glee by Glen Powell—and Rooster (Miles Teller). He should really be called Gosling, for he is the son of Goose (Anthony Edwards), who lay dead in Maverick’s arms, after ejecting, in “Top Gun.” The memory of that disaster is raw, and it sets up a crunchy dilemma: Will Rooster and Maverick sort out their differences and redeem the past? Hey, here’s a thought: why doesn’t Maverick quit the pedagogy and join Rooster on the jaunt to distant climes, with a chance to blow up some pesky nuclear shit? Chocks away, Mr. Chips!\n\nLike many historical artifacts of the nineteen-eighties, the old “Top Gun” is fondly remembered, widely worshipped, and actually not very good. I suspect that Kosinski knows as much; hence the canny balance with which he retrieves some features of the first film and lets others alone. So, it’s welcome back to Iceman (Val Kilmer), once a rival jock, now an ailing commander of the fleet. But there’s no Kelly McGillis, who played Maverick’s awkwardly tall beloved, and, alas, no Meg Ryan, as Goose’s wife. New to the arena is Penny (Jennifer Connelly), who runs a bar, and takes Maverick sailing—a breezy and unusual scene, in that he is momentarily caught at a disadvantage. At altitude, in an F-18, he can duck and dive all day, but tell him to cleat a halyard and he’s all at sea.\n\nIf Hangman and the gang are, as we are frequently informed, the best of the best, then Maverick, yachtsmanship aside, must be the best of the best of the best. The triumphalism of the movie’s mood—like the absurdity of its plot, which concludes with a bitch of a dogfight over land and sea—is so puppyish as to be disarming, and its lunges at heartfelt conflict, as opposed to airborne jousting, have a comical smack of the playground. (“I saved your life.” “I saved your life.”) Yet the plain fact is that “Top Gun: Maverick” works. Designed to coax a throng of viewers into a collective and involuntary fist pump, it far outflies the original, while retaining one old-fashioned virtue: the lofty action unfolds against real skies, rather than giant smears of C.G.I. The heroes may do super stuff, but they’re not superheroes. Enjoy them while you can. As Maverick is warned by his superior, “The future is coming. And you’re not in it.” The next generation of pilots will not be people at all. Who wants to watch “Top Drone”? Not me.\n\nThe first half hour or so of “Men,” the new movie from Alex Garland, is a bad green dream. Historical instinct may tell us that the countryside is a refuge: “Are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court?” the banished duke inquires of his fellow-exiles, in “As You Like It.” But there is another tradition, the anti-pastoral, which bids us beware. Even as we flee the iron and stone of the cities, in search of more easeful landscapes, are we quite sure of what we will find? Can we have the grass without the snakes?\n\nMany horror movies, of course, toy with rustic terror, yet they tend to treat the back of beyond as a mere trap—a spot in which to strand some urban bozos. “Men,” however, digs into the idea of a haven and unearths both loveliness and disquiet. Look at Harper (Jessie Buckley), say, who drives out of London into deepest England, pursuing peace. She walks over fields drenched in greenness, past trees that are furred with moss as soft as baize, and down a disused railroad track, into the mouth of a tunnel, within which everything drips. The farther she ventures into this ripening world, the less consoling it feels. The director of photography, Rob Hardy, who also shot Garland’s “Ex Machina” (2014) and “Annihilation” (2018), somehow brings a tincture of menace to bluebells. Just a trick of the light, I guess, although, according to old British folklore, a child who picked a bluebell would never be seen again.\n\nHarper is in mourning. She recently lost her husband, James (Paapa Essiedu), who fell from a balcony of their London apartment block, after the two of them had argued. (In a slow-motion flashback, she watches him descend through the air, with a howl.) As Buckley showed in “Beast” (2017) and “The Lost Daughter” (2021), her expressive candor can be almost painful to behold, and she is fast becoming the doyenne of the emotionally embattled; gazing at Harper, we sense something angry and unresolved in her lamentation. Sooner or later, in this rural retreat, rage will be coming into bloom.\n\nFor all the poise of these early scenes, there is a sudden clunk, which augurs badly for the rest of “Men.” Harper, who is renting a large house from a hearty gentleman named Geoffrey (Rory Kinnear), stands before an apple tree in his garden. Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucks, she eats. “Mustn’t do that,” Geoffrey tells her. He adds that he’s joking, but the problem is that the movie isn’t joking, and, before long, it changes direction and turns nasty.\n\nAs she explores her surroundings, Harper encounters a naked prowler; a creepy vicar, who lays a hand on her leg in the churchyard; a kid in a mask, who calls her a bitch; a policeman; and a pub landlord, plus two of his customers. All of them, including the boy, are played by Kinnear, with no other actors in sight, and they seem to be interchangeable. When Harper strikes one of them in self-defense as he tries to break in, leaving his hand and forearm neatly sliced, each of them then bears the identical wound. Huh?\n\nThe moral of this film appears to be: every male, regardless of age and social status, means harm to womankind. Men are defined, and propelled, by the ill will that they bear to the opposite sex, and by their barely concealed belief that women, from Eve to Harper, are asking for trouble. Thus, Harper is sexually assaulted by the vicar, who blames her for the death of James. (And he assaulted her, too, when he was alive.) On and on the malevolence goes. One abusive man spawns another; what form that spawning takes, courtesy of some outlandish special effects, I leave you to imagine.\n\nThere will be viewers, no doubt, who share the violent bleakness of the movie’s outlook. Will they admire such rigor, or will they reckon, as I did, that it narrows and flattens the free movement of the drama, with dismal results? After a while, the story has nowhere to go. Of the delicate eco-fable with which Garland began his tale, little remains, although, in a magical twist, the naked man sprouts leaves and stems from his face and body—as did various folk in “Annihilation,” and as does the Green Man, an ancient figure who can still be seen carved in English churches. In an era of plague and climatic disturbance, there is no more fertile issue than the inter-wreathing of the human and the natural, and no one better than Garland to give it luxuriant life onscreen. Maybe next time. ♦"
