Our early readers are still phonic based but focus more on the flow of the text.\n\nBook Banded\n\nAll our early readers are book banded (levelled) to the Institute of Education (UK) standard. To find out more about book banding and what makes up the different levels click here.\n\nAudio Available\n\nIt is important to hear a language spoken in order to learn to read that language. Our pink, red, yellow and blue books have audio available in the form of a video which highlights specific words."
