        "text": "What is maverick buying?\n\nMaverick buying (sometimes called invisible, wild or rogue buying) is the inefficient purchasing of low value, low volume, tail-end goods and services. These essential but often overlooked items required by a company â like coffee and biscuits, copy paper, or a new laminator â and everything you run to the store for.\n\nIt also includes paying for services, such as fixing broken facilities, and more substantial spending on IT equipment, construction machinery hire, or emergency maintenance of production lines.Â\n\nImportantly, maverick buying takes place outside existing supplier framework agreements. And because maverick buying is usually carried out by individuals, procurement teams remain unaware of these transactions.Â\n\nItâs also worth acknowledging that if it left unchecked, maverick buying can result in financial losses and less-compliant purchasing.\n\nSo why does maverick buying happen?Â\n\nIn our personal lives, weâre all used to getting what we want, when we want it. That âneedâ for something ânowâ is a strong motivation for maverick buying in businesses too.\n\nFor them, maverick buying is a way to secure faster delivery times, control their individual procurement needs and, in some cases, support their local business community. But what other factors contribute to driving maverick buying on a company-wide scale? Letâs take a lookâ¦\n\nLack of a top-down compliance culture\n\nIt all starts at the top. If your organisationâs leadership doesnât encourage and insist on compliance with group-wide procurement processes, how can you expect everyone else to fall in line?Â\n\nYour central procurement team will be powerless to enforce buying behaviours, meaning youâll miss out on contract terms and negotiated prices. And without any incentive to follow the rules or oversight, your decentralised purchasing departments will do as they please.\n\nLack of standardised group-wide processes\n\nLeadership aside, if you donât have any standardised group-wide processes in the first place â or a seamless procurement system that works for everyone â teams will make up their own processes, use the solutions they prefer and resort to maverick buying.\n\nUnfamiliar or confusing procurement processes\n\nEmployees, particularly in regional or specialised departments, are put off by long-winded centralised procurement processes for what they see as strategically trivial spending on things they really need. Instead, theyâll take the path of least resistance.\n\nCatalogues donât meet buyersâ needs\n\nIn some cases, maverick buying happens when the approved supplier catalogues available are limited, failing to offer the selection of products your buyersâ are looking for."
