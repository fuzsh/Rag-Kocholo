        "text": "Perhaps people recall the (surprisingly brief) aerial footage, the aviators, the now-dizzying levels of (accidental?) homoeroticism. But they forget the emptiness.\n\nWhere some films come from great literature, others from historic events, Top Gun was inspired by a picture in a glossy magazine. “It was two guys in leather jackets and sunglasses standing in front of the biggest, fastest f****** airplane you ever saw in your life!” enthused the awesomely named (but uncredited) writer Chip Proser. Keen to preserve the simplicity – and saleability – of this image, reductionist producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer did little more than animate it in order to create, in the latter's words, “Star Wars on earth”. Tragically their 1990 sort-of-sequel Days Of Thunder was pitched as “Top Gun in cars”.\n\nBut how much less interesting would Star Wars have been if its hero was a) already a Jedi, b) fighting for the empire and c) a total tool.\n\nWhichever way you cut it, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a dreadful, dreadful person: arrogant, careless and a bit sex-pesty (following apparently not-interested Kelly McGillis into the ladies' room is officially not OK). Cruise does his dentally enhanced best, but it's hard to warm to the sort of man who repeatedly risks the life of his best friend, Goose (Anthony Edwards), and wears sunglasses indoors (not to mention – unwisely – during a volleyball game).\n\nMaverick's not the only aspect that's deeply flawed. The romance was so weak it required extra scenes to be shot (hence McGillis' hat – she'd changed her hair). And the dialogue is often howlingly bad. “You were a lot like he was,” Maverick is told, referring to his father, Anakin, sorry, Duke Mitchell, “only better – and worse.”\n\nMeanwhile, you can't get much lazier than calling your rule-flouting, authority-shirking main character Maverick. Unless he named himself, which makes him even more of a tool. If that's the case – and suspiciously cool-sounding monikers such as Stinger and Merlin were definitely not dolled out in the officers' mess – why on earth did Goose choose Goose? And what the hell is Cougar (John Stockwell) hiding? At least we see Iceman (Val Kilmer) actually consuming iced water, so that's clear.\n\nBut it's worse than dumb. What professes to be a hearty boys' own adventure has a creeping darkness at its core. Once these not-so magnificent men and their flying machines have blown a few innocent Russians out of the sky, they party like its prom (or Pride) and the film gives in gladly to their queasy triumphalism. No matter that the people they've just shot down were pilots just like them, in the wrong place at the wrong time, fighting for the wrong side.\n\nIn fact, Maverick and co seem to spend as much time congratulating themselves as they do flying. But what are they – and by proxy, we – actually cheering?\n\nAt its centre, Top Gun is the story of a homicidally irresponsible pilot who learns to kill people real good – but literally nothing else – then heads back to school to train the next generation of fratty fly-boy psychos. Go team! Somehow a fist bump doesn't quite feel appropriate anymore...\n\nNow read: 5 Reasons not to see the Entourage movie\n\nShopping\n\nWhere to buy bedding in 2024: Your ticket to five-star bliss\n\nFrom Dusk to Brooklinen, we've tracked down all the best bedding brands to shop in 2024.
