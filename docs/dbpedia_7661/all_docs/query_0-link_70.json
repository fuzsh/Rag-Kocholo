        "text": "Noted director, Peppa Pig fan and foot aficionado Quentin Tarantino is the latest big name to come out behind Tom Cruise's billion dollar-plus hit, Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nThe surprise sequel hit of the summer season — surpassing all expectations, and beating out the likes of Doctor Strange 2, Jurassic World Dominion and Thor: Love and Thunder to sustain the top spot domestically and abroad — just keeps adding flight miles. Stopping by the ReelBlend podcast (h/t Variety) on his recent tour to promote his own classic movie commute-killer, The Video Archives, 59-year-old Tarantino declared his adoration for the “spectacle” of the Top Gun sequel telling the pod: “I fucking love [it].”\n\nHe continued: “I thought it was fantastic. I saw it at the theatres. That and [Steven] Spielberg's West Side Story provided a true cinematic spectacle, the kind that I'd almost thought that I wasn't going to see anymore. It was fantastic.”\n\nTarantino, a long-standing admirer of original Top Gun director Tony Scott (brother of Ridley, to those not in the know) wrote the script for the director's seventh feature, True Romance. Scott passed away ten years ago, and as far as Tarantino is concerned, Maverick could be the closest thing we get to seeing another of his works.\n\n“There was just this lovely, lovely aspect because I love both Tony Scott’s cinema so much, and I love Tony so much that that’s as close as we’re ever going to get to seeing one more Tony Scott movie,” he said.\n\n“[Director Joseph Kosinski] did a great job. The respect and the love of Tony was in every frame. It was almost in every decision. It was consciously right there, but in this really cool way that was really respectful. And I think it was in every decision Tom [Cruise] made on the film.”\n\nAs if it wasn't already clear that Tarantino really fucking loves this movie — as he should — take his final word as bond: “It's the closest we're ever going to get to seeing one more Tony Scott movie, and it was a fucking terrific one.”\n\nOne tiny snag: he thought the Val Kilmer moment was “almost too cheap,” but conceded that it “totally works… it fucking works. You're waiting for it and the fucking scene delivers.” Mr. Tarantino, wash out your mouth."
