        "text": "Nostalgia! The culture is drowning in it. And today here comes a tidal wave: Top Gun: Maverick. This movie, which I practically sprinted to go see, is a paradox: shamelessly embarrassing and deliriously exciting, as devoid of new ideas as it is expert at delivering on expectations. My verdict was a fist pump—Maverick’s flight scenes and dogfight sequences are undeniable, and the final third is the most fun I’ve had in a theater since…well, since Mission Impossible: Fallout (and more on that in a minute). I watched long stretches of Maverick through my hands, deeply mortified at the silliness of what I was seeing, but by the end I was practically cheering. And wondering how we got here.\n\nBut then again, no, I wasn’t: Tom Cruise is how we got here. Cruise is our last movie star, a fanatical entertainment machine, a no-days-off nation-state of unembarrassed charisma. Jetting around the world to one red carpet premiere after another (Cannes, London, Tokyo), beaming that boyish smile into banks of cameras, giving vapid quotes like “I’m living the dream” and “This, this is pretty epic,” and still making headlines, Cruise is blunt-force sincerity, a 59-year-old borne aloft on his work ethic and our goodwill. His promotional tour for Maverick has featured fighter jets trailing red, white, and blue smoke through the French sky; a Top Gun helicopter landing aboard an aircraft carrier—one quakes at the carbon footprint of it all—and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge practically bending the knee to another royal in their midst. None of this is cynicism-inducing. I can’t tell you why.\n\nDitto the movie. You’d be hard pressed to find a less 2022 document. The world of Top Gun: Maverick bears none of the scars and bruises of present-day reality. The landscape is gloriously sun-kissed and immaculately Californian, the actors eerily smooth-skinned and able-bodied no matter their age (even Val Kilmer’s Iceman, who has a poignant if unsteady walk-on). There’s cocky patriotism, a doomsday conflict with a hilariously unspecified foreign power, motorcycles (no helmets), a love scene (I think) in which Jennifer Connelly never takes off her pajamas. The geopolitics of Top Gun: Maverick are evergreen. The social politics, super-duper chill: Women can fly planes as well as the men, everyone basically has enough money, and racial diversity has been harmoniously achieved (in Maverick everyone looks—no matter their race—exactly the same).\n\nDo we need a plot summary? We do not. Suffice it to say that Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Cruise) has been called back into service at the Top Gun flight academy to teach a bunch of naval upstarts how to save the world, including the son of his late buddy Goose (call sign “Rooster,” played by Miles Teller)—and in the end must do it himself. There is an intriguing and quickly discarded theme about the automation of military flight (drones, boo!), but Maverick is not a movie with ideas, thoughts, or really a care in the world. In 1986’s Top Gun, directed by the immortal Tony Scott, there was macho rivalry, tragic death, and the actual Soviet Union. In Maverick, directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy; Oblivion), there are thrills but there’s never a fear of failure. The climactic mission with the unnamed adversary will put all the pilots’ lives at risk, and everything will work out.\n\nDid I say the flight sequences are awesome? They are. Kosinski embedded custom cameras in real F-18s to capture the actors in actual death-defying flight patterns and the cockpit performances have a giddy authenticity that practically nothing else does. (I assumed the actors were terrified, and hopped up on Dramamine.) In the dogfights the planes jockey for position like matchbox cars and flip and bank and invert in ways that take your breath away.\n\nCruise may be the last movie star—and he grins and twinkles his eyes like one in Maverick—but he’s not really acting like he used to (pour one out for Born on the Fourth of July, for Magnolia). He’s warming up for the next aerial stunt. That’s really him in the F-18s, and even as he’s banking, rolling, withstanding the G’s, you get the feeling his mind is gripped by what to try next. In Cruise’s last outing, 2018’s Mission Impossible: Fallout (as fun as Maverick, and as brainless), he leaped off buildings, dangled off of a helicopter, parachuted at high altitude (over 100 jumps, reportedly). The teaser trailer for 2023’s Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One promises, a little wearily, more of the same.\n\nIf it all seems like a fight against the inevitability of age, mortality, and streaming services, that’s because it is. If there’s a truly suspenseful question around Top Gun: Maverick, it’s whether anyone below the age of 35 will go see this movie…and if they do, what (on earth) they will make of its mix of hopeless nostalgia and go-for-it kineticism. Top Gun: Okay, Boomer? No argument here.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is currently in theaters."
