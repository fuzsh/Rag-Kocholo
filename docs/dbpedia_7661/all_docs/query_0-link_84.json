        "text": "A restrained excitement. I was wondering if the terms even exist as I typed this blog post. Yet, that was my feeling when the trailer of TOP GUN: MAVERICK showed up on YouTube some weeks ago. I was surprised about the algorithm of YouTube because I remember so well I had never browsed or searched anything about TOP GUN. But it greeted me and I wasn’t moved at once. The stance remained after listening to Lady Gaga’s Hold My Hand, the movie’s soundtrack that is as beautiful as Take My Breath Away by Berlin.\n\nI still didn’t want to watch it. The decision was slightly changed after knowing the British Royals attended the premiere along with the casts of the movie. And the living legend, Tom Cruise, was there, of course. Looking gorgeous and polite with that stinging smile that captured my attention when watching the first TOP GUN.\n\nNo, no.. It wasn’t because of the Duchess of Cambridge that I eventually watched the sequel. Something inside my heart said the following: “Just watch it. Set yourself free.”\n\nPerhaps, you are wondering why I had to be very serious and then add “set yourself free”. Well, it’s because the first TOP GUN has impacted me in a lot of ways. I was afraid that watching its sequel would transport me back to the past. Don’t get me wrong.\n\nI had a very amazing and unforgettable past. When the first TOP GUN hit the screen in 1986, I was just two years old. And I only watched the movie in the 1990s as broadcasted by a private station here, in Indonesia. I was overblown by the movie! I watched it twice or three times and I was always stunned. To date, I love the plot, the casts, the messages, and definitely, the adrenaline rushes once the jets took off.\n\nBut.. As much as I want to live in the past, life goes on, right? The reason I kept the excitement low was that I didn’t wish to deal with the idea of going back to the past. That would be very emotionally wrecking and with this feeling, I went to the cinema here in Jakarta yesterday. I was ready to “embrace” the emotion as a consequence of “setting myself free”.\n\nAnd it was strongly felt at the beginning of the movie. It was the soundtrack by Harold Faltermeyer and Steve Stevens. Damn! The butterfly feelings in the 1986 movie quickly welcomed me back. And I loved seeing Tom directly appeared in the first scene. I’m not a fan of aviation but somehow watching the jets successfully stimulates the hype. You know, feeling afraid but excited at the same time.\n\nAn unexpected scene surprised me so much. It brought up politics in the aviation sector of the U.S; the budget cut in favor of drones. I won’t tell you the whole story. I strongly recommend this movie even if you weren’t yet born in 1986, LOL!\n\nMy point is about the title of this blog post itself. As I finished watching the film, I can understand the difficulty of the director and all of the crew to present it as “consumable” to all ages. A well-balanced mixture of the 1986 iconic flavors and today’s ever-changing technology and challenges in the aviation industry become the big questions here. That’s why Pete “Maverick” Mitchell said: “It’s not about the plane. It’s about the pilot.”\n\nThe naughty air fighter was now entering his retirement period but he was still a badass. He was facing the threat of being dismissed for good. His outrageous behaviors put the lives of the people at stake. And it was the price he had to pay for his freedom of doing what he was truly good at and belonged to. Until there was a scene when he was advised by his long-time best friend, Iceman, to “let it go”. So simple but very touching as the top aviator was now 50 something. And the Lieutenant knew that but didn’t know how to do so. He loved his job so much that he couldn’t teach the skill to his young students.\n\nSo, so coincidentally that his situation is similar to mine. And perhaps, that’s the reason why TOP GUN holds a special place in my heart which was, of course, unexpected by little Eny when watching the first TOP GUN.\n\nCurrently, I work as an English trainer, and honestly, it’s so damn difficult to pass on my passion for the subject to my students or clients. This pure love is not for everyone. I’m very fortunate to have been blessed with this gift but it’s a whole new thing to transfer it to my students or my clients.\n\nAnd like Pete, I sometimes have to experience new methods to deliver the lessons. Most of the time, I give myself questions, such as Will my students understand this? Will they succeed? Am I crazy enough to try this strategy?”\n\nThe timing couldn’t be better. His crazy attitude has injected special energies into my own career that, I am happy to say, is driven by my love for the English Language. I’m not yet as old as Maverick but the title of this blog post has been lingering since yesterday. Thankfully, I don’t have to undergo a 3-month pilot training while being an almost 60-year-old man as Tom Cruise did, LOL!\n\nBut the points are..\n\nEntering a new phase in our lives can be difficult for some. Accepting the fact about the handover of responsibility can be a daunting task. It’s gladdening that as the movie concluded, Captain Pete eventually learned to let it go because his future was brighter in its kind of way."
