        "text": "Tom Cruise never looks happier than when he’s starring in an action movie that tugs on our nostalgic heartstrings, does he? Case in point: the trailer for Top Gun sequel Top Gun: Maverick, in which Cruise is positively beaming as he teaches a new generation of Navy aviators the ways of the sky.\n\n“After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top aviators,” Paramount’s description reads, “Pete ‘Maverick’ Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him.” Yup, that does sound like the Maverick we met in Top Gun in 1986. The new film finds Maverick training Top Gun graduates for a new, intense mission—and meeting the son of his late buddy, Radar Intercept Officer Lt. Nick Bradshaw, aka “Goose.” Miles Teller will play that progeny, Lt. Bradley Bradshaw, call sign “Rooster.” In addition to Cruise, Val Kilmer will be back as the cocky Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, alongside new stars Jon Hamm, Glen Powell, and Manny Jacinto.\n\n“Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past,” the description concludes, “Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.”\n\nTom Cruise, who is now 57 years old, has earned a bit of a reputation in Hollywood for refusing to act his age—for leaning, instead, on the youthful, action-oriented roles he occupied for years in films like Top Gun and the Mission: Impossible franchise. But if new projects like Mission: Impossible — Fallout prove anything, it’s that Cruise both has the most fun and gives the most fun performances when he doesn’t act his age. Yes, it’s a luxury that many others in Hollywood—particularly women—might not enjoy. But on the other hand, it’s hard to watch this trailer and argue that Top Gun: Maverick doesn’t look like a hell of a good time at the cineplex.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Why Baby Yoda has conquered the world\n\n— Scarlett Johansson on movies, marriage, and controversies\n\n— 2020 Oscar nominations: 20 movies that are serious contenders\n\n— 29 of the brightest stars who died\n\n— The decade’s best shows, episodes, and where to stream our favorites\n\n— V.F.’s chief critic looks back at the films that helped define the year in cinema\n\n— From the Archive: Julia Roberts—Hollywood’s Cinderella and the belle of the box office\n\nLooking for more?
