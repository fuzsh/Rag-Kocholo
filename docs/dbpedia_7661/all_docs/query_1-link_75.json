        "text": "Val Kilmer, variously man of Ice and Bat, has had a torrid time of it over the last decade. In 2014, at 54-years-old — he's just three years older than Top Gun co-star Tom Cruise — he was diagnosed with throat cancer and, as reported by the New York Times Magazine, the combination of a tracheostomy and relentless chemotherapy led to the loss of his voice. He can still speak, but barely: the Times describes it as more akin to squeezing “air up through his windpipe,\" the resultant sound “between a squeak and a voiceless roar”. 2020 brought mixed news: while he confirmed that the cancer hadn't returned for four years, he can now only sustain himself via a feeding tube.\n\nA quick recap: in 1986's Top Gun, Kilmer plays Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, another hotshot trainee in the titular Navy programme rounding up the best-of-the-best aviators from across the United States. Iceman and Cruise's character, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, top the class and expectedly come to heated blows, Iceman the by-the-books nerd, Maverick (as his call sign manifestly indicates) the shit-talking anti-authoritarian. Their relationship carries over into Top Gun: Maverick as one built of profound mutual respect and kinship — the sort that can only be shared by the two best in the world at what they do.\n\nThat Iceman returns to the fold for the sequel, then, might be considered something a little short of miraculous. According to a number of sources on the production of Maverick — Kilmer himself, super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer centrally — it was all down to the energetic rallying of Tom Cruise. “We all wanted him, but Tom was really adamant that if he’s going to make another Top Gun, Val had to be in it,\" Bruckheimer told People last year. His inclusion was confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter in 2018 and, since then, fans and critics alike have wondered just how, given his medical situation, his return might be handled.\n\nSo how do they do it in Maverick? Major spoilers ahead, but it's a touchingly bittersweet little moment.\n\nSomewhere in a pointedly vague, ideologically ill-defined rogue state, a uranium enrichment plant is being built. NATO doesn't like this one iota — nuclear weapons, the potential for total global annihilation, yada yada — so Top Gun is tasked with sending in a crack force of their best recruits to destroy it before it can become active, threatening the planet's fragile stability. Shortly after a gig testing Mach 10 capable superjets goes awry, Maverick happens to be recalled to Top Gun for one last pull of the joystick. This is to the chagrin of every single Navy officer from sea to shining sea, aside from Iceman, now the all-powerful commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.\n\nSo, their differences have been put aside in the thirty-six years since we last saw them together, and now Iceman is keeping Maverick veritably employed. Very nice. But Kazansky, aside from a glimpse or two of his framed portrait on display at the Top Gun facility, is conspicuously absent from the picture, until things go expectedly south on the training field and Iceman calls Mav to his office for a little face-to-face. Rather than conveniently overlooking Kilmer's illness for his cameo, it's established from before he comes into frame that Iceman has too been ill — and his prognosis is dramatically worse. He speaks with Maverick via text on a computer monitor for the most part, before a moment of quiet heroism: he rasps a couple of lines to his compatriot, stirring in his resolve.\n\nWithout inadvertently implying that Kilmer should be treated as if he's dead, the scene called to mind the post-mortem, CGI force ghost reveal of Harold Ramis in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, wherein a silent apparition bearing Ramis' likeness — the OG ‘buster died seven years before the movie came out — helps the main hero beat the big baddie in the climax. That felt noxious and exploitative in ghoulishly exhuming a dead man without his consent. In Top Gun: Maverick Kilmer is very much alive, but each scene is playing to the same emotional register: a final bow for a well-loved hero of a Hollywood long-passed. The difference is one is delivered with grace and reverence, the other the result of commercial greed.\n\nIt ties nicely into the broader themes of Top Gun: Maverick, a movie as much about batting off the impending existential threat of streaming as it is accepting the future and letting go of the past. Instead of treating Kilmer — and, indeed, the entire notion of Top Gun — as a throwaway nostalgia object, he's given a celluloid swan song that'll stand the test of time.\n\nNOW READ\n\nTop Gun: Maverick looks set to be Tom Cruise's biggest movie ever\n\nTom Cruise's 11 best films, ranked\n\nTom Cruise disguises himself to watch movies in theatres"
