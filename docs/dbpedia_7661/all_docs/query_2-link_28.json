        "text": "Tom Cruise recently revealed that he got just as emotional as fans did during his on-screen reunion with Val Kilmer in Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible star returned as Maverick in the 2022 sequel to 1986 action movie Top Gun. In the movie, Cruise's character Maverick has a scene with his former nemesis Iceman, played by Kilmer, whose ability to speak has been affected following treatment for throat cancer.\n\nIn the emotional scene, as he seeks advice on how to handle his working relationship with his late flying partner Goose's son Rooster, Maverick learns that Iceman has terminal cancer.\n\n\"I just want to say, that was pretty emotional,\" Cruise said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\n\"I've known Val for decades, and for him to come back and play that characterâ€”he's such a powerful actor that he instantly became that character again,\" he continued. \"You're looking at Iceman.\"\n\nWhen Kimmel admitted he cried whilst watching their scene together, Cruise shared he was very moved as well.\n\n\"I was crying. I got emotional,\" he admitted. \"He's such a brilliant actor, and I love his work.\"\n\nCruise reportedly fought to have Kilmer back for the sequel, in which Kilmer chose to incorporate his real-life illness into the script.\n\nIn his memoir, the Batman Forever star explained that he approached the producers himself to return as Iceman.\n\n\"Tom was Maverick, but Maverick's nemesis was Iceman. The two went together like salt and pepper,\" wrote Kilmer.\n\n\"It didn't matter that the producers didn't contact me. As The Temptations sang in the heyday of Motown soul, 'Ain't too proud to beg'.\"\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is currently in the running for Best Picture at the upcoming Oscars.\n\nThe film is nominated in other five categories, including Best Song for 'Hold My Hand', performed by Lady Gaga and BloodPop."
