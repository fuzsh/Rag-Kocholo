        "text": "David Ellison has been trying to make “Top Gun: Maverick” since 2010. As a kid, the original “Top Gun” had sparked his love of flying and action movies. As soon as Ellison became a movie producer, he started pushing Tony Scott, its director, to contemplate a sequel. It took eight years of development, two years of production, a new director and five pandemic-related delays. But after this weekend, Ellison can finally declare victory.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” grossed $124 million this weekend in North America, the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career. For Ellison and Cruise, who have worked together on eight projects, it’s their first collaboration to gross more than $100 million over its opening weekend."
