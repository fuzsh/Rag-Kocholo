        "text": "Join us for a special late night at the Library! From 5:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m., visitors will receive free admission to the Museum. Learn about JFK’s formative years in the Young Jack exhibit, join him on the campaign trail up through election night, and experience the 1,000 days of his presidency in our galleries.\n\nAt 7:00 p.m., the Library will host a free screening of the blockbuster movie Top Gun: Maverick, starring Tom Cruise. In addition, maritime maker activities will be available for gallery visitors throughout the evening, and don’t miss the Ask An Archivist table with selected items from the JFK Library's collections.\n\nThis program is part of Navy Week at the JFK Library, culminating in a special free-admission Navy Day on Friday, July 5 as part of the U.S. Navy’s Boston Navy Week, including in-person demonstrations from Navy members and concerts featuring Navy bands.\n\nSpecial food and drink options will be available for purchase. The JFK Café and the Museum Store will be open late.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is rated PG-13 due to some implied sexual content, violent content, and coarse language.\n\nRegistration is recommended but not required."
