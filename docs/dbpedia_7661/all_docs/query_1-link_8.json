        "text": "Hi @BravoAlfaZulu\n\nThis was all covered on the Developer QnA livestream held this last Wednesday, when the announcement about the DLC removal was made.\n\nApril 2024 Developer Live Stream [OFFICIAL] - Twitch Timestamp: 1:44:36\n\nThe reason the DLC will be removed from sale is due to the licensing agreement with the movie company in charge of production.\n\nIf you already own the rights to the product you should be able to install it from the Content Manager in the future.\n\nThanks\n\nThe MSFS Team\n\nAs this thread and the last 40+ days have shown, this solution may not be correct. As this text from the Dev Blog shows, he does not clearly answer if it will be available to redownload after July 25th, 2024. If anything, he somewhat contradicts himself making it sound like it will not be available to redownload.\n\n[Jorg] Are we on the slide? Are we done? Okay. Jayne is questioned out. Here we go. Well, anyway, so you saw this, then this is sort of bittersweet for me because I love it. So come to the next slide. This was a very successful expansion. We’re approaching 3 million downloads. We’ve seen over 40 million flight sessions and because it’s a movie license, those things, unfortunately not endless. It’s going to leave the marketplace on [May 25th] so I don’t think many people have not downloaded this that are on this call, but, but, but if you want it, that would be a good time. because in about a month, it’s gone. Yeah.\n\n[Jayne] So if they download it now, they’ll have it when it’s gone.\n\n[Jorg] And I would, if there’s a Top Gun, I will show us, I’ll try to do something else again with those guys, but you know, they talk about it. So, so, so, but you know, we’ll see.\n\n[Martial] So maybe we’ve got to be a little bit more clear. If you have downloaded it, you will keep it.\n\n[Jorg] It’s not going to be deleted from your machine. That’s not even legal, right? But you can’t download it again, basically, is the problem. If you’re a new customer, you can’t download it again.\n\nWhile he says people that have downloaded it will have it, there is nothing clear about having it if the reinstall the game on a new or rebuilt PC.\n\nJorg says “But you can’t download it again, basically, is the problem. If you’re a new customer, you can’t download it again.”\n\nWhile he reiterates “new customer” this is still not clear. As others have said in other posts, “I wish they would speak clearly” As a software developer myself of 25+ years the one thing I’ve learned is to speak precisely regarding functionality. While they are certainly not speaking in their native tongues, this is clearly left too ambiguous re future re-downloads. You stated in this thread that you were going to look into it. Has anything new been announced that gives clarity.\n\n[May 23, 2024 Development Update Blog Discussion - Discussion Hub / General Discussion - Microsoft Flight Simulator Forums]"
