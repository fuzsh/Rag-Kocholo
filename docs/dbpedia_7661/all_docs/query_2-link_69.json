        "text": "This week I had planned to review the new Minions movie but things changed. I did go to see Minions: Rise Of Gru yesterday but I also went to see Top Gun: Maverick for a second time because a couple of my friends wanted to go. I realise it‚Äôs a bit old now after being out a couple of months but since it‚Äôs still in UK cinemas and doing well, it doesn‚Äôt feel too late to share my thoughts on this film. So here goes.\n\nI remember first hearing the name Top Gun as a kid, around the time the first movie was released in 1986. My Dad took my two older brothers to the cinema but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go because I was too young for the film. It‚Äôs fair to say at the time that it was a massive blockbuster hit and a cultural phenomena. I had the soundtrack on cassette, now that makes me feel old. I played Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins on my Walkman quite often. When I first heard there was a plan to make a sequel 36 years later, I wasn‚Äôt optimistic to say the least. I expected it to be a disaster. By all accounts so did Tom Cruise. He apparently refused to sign on for the film a couple of times. Until he was sure the script was actually good and it could be a decent film in it‚Äôs own right. There are also all the stories of him making the other actors go up in jets and attend basic flight training to make it more realistic. I don‚Äôt know how much of that is true but he does have a reputation for insisting on doing his own stunts.\n\nThe film begins with our protagonist Pete ‚ÄúMaverick‚Äù Mitchell (Cruise), 30 years on from the original film, still flying jets for the US Navy as a test pilot. He has consistently dodged promotions that would prevent him from active flying duty. As Ed Harris character Chester Cain explains in the opening act. ‚ÄúYou should be at least an Admiral by now, maybe even a senator!‚Äù. There‚Äôs a lot of that kind of talk in this early exchange. You‚Äôre a fossil, you‚Äôre the past, the future is unmanned flights etc etc. He tells Maverick that he‚Äôs been called back to the Navy‚Äôs flight combat school TOPGUN much to Cain‚Äôs distaste. As we quickly learn though it isn‚Äôt to fly in an active mission. Instead Maverick is told he will be training some of the best young graduates from the programme to carry out a highly difficult and dangerous mission. Jon Hamm is very good as the cantankerous Beau ‚ÄúCyclone‚Äù Simpson, commander of Naval Air Services and Maverick‚Äôs new boss. He plays an important role throughout the movie and really provides the authority figure for Maverick to kick against.\n\nComplicating the situation for Maverick is the fact that one of the graduates in his class is Bradley ‚ÄúRooster‚Äù Bradshaw, the son of his former flight partner Goose. Whose death is a major plot point of the first film. We also learn that Maverick prevented Rooster from joining Naval Air Services when he was younger and set his career back 4 years. Rooster resents Maverick for this and their relationship becomes a key part of the story. Can Maverick get his young charges ready for this mission in just 3 weeks? Is it even possible? Well to find out you‚Äôll have to watch for yourself because I‚Äôm not giving any spoilers. Sorry.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier I didn‚Äôt have very high hopes for this film given the 36 year gap and the fact the original really hasn‚Äôt dated that well. I saw it a while ago and it wasn‚Äôt nearly as good as I remember. Perhaps that‚Äôs because I was a kid the first time who knows, but it‚Äôs fair to say I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to this. I‚Äôm very happy to say I was completely wrong and Top Gun: Maverick captivated me with it‚Äôs impressive visuals, great acting, soundtrack and little nuggets of nostalgia, which deliver nicely but stop short of the heavy handed touch I feared. There is enough in there for fans of the original to recognise, even some footage from the original film used to add emotion at moments. But it doesn‚Äôt lean on the original and I would say you don‚Äôt even had to have seen Top Gun to enjoy Maverick. Obviously camera technology has changed a lot in 36 years and the flight sequences are exciting and visceral. The choice to use as little CGI as possible is a good one. You can almost feel the speed as the planes take off. It‚Äôs definitely something to behold on the big screen. Whether that translates to home viewings I guess we‚Äôll find out in time.\n\nThe cast is well chosen. Jennifer Connolly is excellent and exudes attitude in her role opposite Tom Cruise. It would have been very easy to include a one dimensional love interest here but she shows she is every bit his equal. The inclusion of Val Kilmer as Iceman and the way they pull this off is touching. Kilmer has been very ill in real life and can‚Äôt really talk any more because of his treatments for throat cancer. The way this is addressed is clever. It was nice to see him on screen again. I‚Äôve always liked Miles Teller since his breakthrough in Whiplash, and his performance as Rooster adds emotional depth to the film beautifully. The supporting cast are all excellent but I have to concede here Tom Cruise demonstrates he is still a bone fide film star. I have my issues with him in real life, and some of his Scientology backed statements on subjects like mental health have been particularly idiotic. Still, I was able to separate the artist from the art and he deserves every credit for his performance as Maverick. I can see the film being nominated for a few prizes when awards season comes round again. It could very well win some of them as well.\n\nOverall Rating: 5/5\n\nOverall I can‚Äôt think of any negative things to say about this film really. Nobody is more surprised about that than me. Despite it‚Äôs run time of over 2 hours I never felt bored or restless once. I would even go so far as to say it‚Äôs the best film I‚Äôve seen this year so far. I probably enjoyed it more the second time, which really says something. It‚Äôs well worth getting along to see it on the big screen before it‚Äôs extended run finally finishes. Allow yourself to swept up by this dramatic story and you‚Äôll have a great time. Whether you‚Äôve seen the original or not.\n\nHave you seen Maverick? What did you think of it? Let me know in the comments below, also via email or Twitter if you like. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll review next week but I‚Äôm open to suggestions and requests. Thanks very much for reading this, if you made it this far, I really appreciate it.\n\nUntil next time take care of yourselves. I‚Äôm off to go find my aviator shades and buzz the tower while digging out my old Walkman hehe üôÇ\n\nDan"
