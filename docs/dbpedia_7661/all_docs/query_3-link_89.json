        "text": "Article content\n\nAfter a recent road test covering several thousand kilometres of winter testing (and a city-stopping snowstorm), I wanted to better understand how the Ford Maverick’s AWD system works, what’s gone into its testing and development process, and what drivers can expect to get out of the system in real life. For insight, I reached out to Scott Wilson, a Ford Calibration Engineer from Richmond Hill, Ontario. Wilson is one of the many folks who worked on the the 2022 Ford Maverick, and specifically, this compact truck’s AWD system.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nDon't navigate the car buying road alone!\n\nJoin our thriving community on social media and connect with other car searchers and enthusiasts.\n\nArticle content\n\nFirst, an anatomy lesson. My non-hybrid tester ran the Maverick’s optional 2-litre turbo four-cylinder engine and AWD powertrain configuration. The engine sits up front, and the AWD system attached to it consists of two key components: a disconnecting power transfer unit (PTU) at the front of the vehicle, and an electro-mechanical torque-transferring rear drive unit (RDU) at the back.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nDeep Dive: 2022 Ford Maverick's AWD system explained Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nWilson says that the combination of these two components allows the system to continuously vary the amount of torque being sent to the rear wheels. In situations where no torque is required, the system can physically disconnect, meaning the driveshaft and gear sets that it’s attached to stop spinning. This results in less friction in the driveline, which saves fuel. The gist? When full traction isn’t required, the AWD system hardware can be physically decoupled, allowing the system to run in a highly fuel-efficient ‘sleep mode’ until additional traction is required.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSo, while you’re cruising down the highway and traction is abundant, the AWD system is decoupled, its gears and shafts stop spinning, and you’re running in a fuel-saving front-wheel drive setup.\n\nWhen slippery surfaces see traction running low, or when the Maverick’s AWD computer brain predicts that it’s about to, the PTU is re-connected. It can switch from fully disconnected to fully operational in a few hundred milliseconds, re-engaging AWD traction in roughly the time it takes a human to blink.\n\nLearn more about the cars\n\n2022 Ford Maverick 2022 Ford Maverick\n\n2.63\n\nout of 5\n\nMSRP $27,750 to $35,400\n\nFurther rearwards, the RDU (which sits between the rear wheels) uses an electro-mechanically controlled clutch pack to enable immediate torque transfer. Applying power to the RDU’s motor changes the clamping force on the clutches attached to it, giving the system the ability to vary torque split between the axles as quickly as a computer can alter the flow of current through an electric motor, which is to say ‘immediately”. The electric motor which drives the clutch packs inside of the RDU is controlled by a dedicated module that reads a variety of sensor inputs to make better decisions.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The AWD system has its own control module that reads in inputs from the vehicle sensors roughly every 20 milliseconds,” Wilson explains.\n\n“In a practical sense, if the front wheels were on polished ice, the AWD system is able to transfer 100 per cent of the engine torque to the rear wheels.”\n\nThe control unit responsible for orchestrating all of this looks at a lot of data.\n\n“The AWD system has a specific control module,” Wilson says.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nPickup Review: 2022 Ford Maverick\n\nFord Maverick Hybrid sold out, might not return until mid-2022\n\n“It’s connected to the AWD hardware and the vehicle’s CAN network, so it can receive data from other vehicle systems and sensors. The system uses signals like outside temperature, steering angle, wiper activation and many more to optimize traction, handling and efficiency. Some other signals the system considers include the accelerator pedal position, yaw sensor, and lateral acceleration sensor.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe goal is to give the Maverick’s AWD system a picture of the current physical forces acting on the vehicle, accurate down to the millisecond. This helps paint the most accurate picture of the current traction situation, which allows the AWD to respond in the most ideal way for the given conditions and driver demands.\n\nThe AWD system also works hand-in-hand with the Maverick’s braking system. In fact, Wilson worked closely with the brakes control engineers to make sure the braking system and AWD system work together efficiently.\n\nDrivers will notice one of the results of this collaboration while they’re trying to steer sharply at a low speed in deep snow — for instance, a snow-filled parking lot. In this setting, the Maverick can apply braking force to the inside rear wheel, almost like an automatic parking-brake slide, but much more precise and seamless.\n\n“Braking of the inside rear wheel does three distinct things,” Wilson Explains. “It makes the inside rear wheel act as an anchor for the rest of the vehicle to turn, it transfers torque to the outside rear wheel, helping the vehicle rotate, and by slowing the inside rear wheel, it speeds up the outside rear wheel, further increasing rotation. Another way to think about this is to consider how a tank steers.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAll 6 Photos for Gallery\n\nFunction Not Available\n\nFull Screen is not supported on this browser version.\n\nYou may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen.\n\nFrom the driver’s seat? It’s a smaller turning circle, less plowing understeer, and a more direct response to your commands — even in a foot of snow.\n\n“This is an on-demand AWD system, but it’s not exclusively reactionary,” Wilson says.\n\nThe control system understands situations where the vehicle is most likely to need additional traction, before a wheel slips. By detecting those situations, the AWD system can be engaged pre-emptively, sending power to the rear wheels and helping provide the ideal response. That’s less slip, and more grip, in more situations, for a more consistent feeling of response and control.\n\n“The control system Ford has developed considers the scenarios where the vehicle is most likely to need traction at all wheels. This method provides the ideal response from the vehicle overall.”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAt a button press, drivers can engage the SLIPPERY drive mode for the most ideal response in challenging winter conditions, and doing so calls up a set of calibrations that ensure the Maverick maximizes safety and driver confidence by working the brakes, engine, and AWD system to limit slippage and help guide the vehicle as precisely as possible.\n\n“For slippery mode, safety is always top of mind,” says Wilson.\n\n“You want good forward traction but also stability while cornering. The AWD system works in conjunction with the brake and engine controls to limit slip and help guide the vehicle where the driver is steering.”\n\nWilson says that testing and validation of the system is carried out partly in Michigan’s upper peninsula at a special winter torture testing centre with challenging conditions and courses. He was even able to drive the Maverick into the F-150 Raptor’s snow testing area — where it eventually got stuck, but not until the snow was up past the doors.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The Michigan site provides just about any type of winter conditions you can imagine — packed snow, deep snow, glare ice, long snowy roads, handling courses, and all kinds of slippery grades,” says Wilson.\n\n“We’ve got special cold chambers there for when we need to test in even lower temperatures than we achieve naturally. Luckily, we get lots of lake effect snow off of Lake Superior, so demanding winter conditions are usually not hard to find. Personally, I can tell you how surprised I was with the Maverick’s capability in snow — and I continued to push the limit while testing, right up until I drove into the F-150 Raptor snow testing area. That eventually got it stuck, but the snow was up past the doors at that point.”\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStill, Wilson says the most difficult testing condition for an AWD system isn’t snow at all — it’s deep sand.\n\n“After completing the test without issue, a Ford team member who works on larger Ford trucks said ‘bet it can’t do that loaded,’ to which I replied, ‘what have you got?'” Wilson says.\n\n“We proceeded to load whatever we had brought along into the bed (extra wheels/tires, coolers, tools, even a winch), put additional team members into the cab, and ran the same test. While the Maverick was working hard, it was never overworked, never got stuck, and truly exceeded this team member’s expectations.”\n\nSign up for our newsletter Blind-Spot Monitor and follow our social channels on Instagram ,Facebook and X to stay up to date on the latest automotive news, reviews, car culture, and vehicle shopping advice.\n\nMore in More Features\n\nReader Review: 2025 Mazda CX-70 MHEV Signature | Reviews\n\nAre off-road accessories safe, secure, and practical for daily use?\n\nBernd Mayländer: F1's Mr. Safety Car\n\nCommercial trucks are going electric, but it's going to be a long road\n\nEvolutionary: The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen has never strayed far from its roots\n\nSee more\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nJustin Pritchard\n\nJustin Pritchard is a Sudbury, Ontario based automotive journalist and award-winning presenter, photographer, videographer and technical writer.

Starting his career at Auto123.com back in 2005 (while finishing his final year of studies at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario), Justin quickly applied his passion for writing, presenting, and photography, working under some of the most recognized editors in the Canadian motoring scene.\n\nJustin has written one of the largest collections of used car buyer guides on the internet, and his TV program, AutoPilot, has aired over 600 episodes across 16 seasons. Presently, AutoPilot is the only English-language motoring program on Canadian cable TV, though he's lent his informative style and easy-to-identify voice to video features for Youtube, Driving.ca, Autotrader.ca, Motoring TV, and elsewhere. With 4 years as co-chair of the Canadian Car of the Year Awards (CCOTY) program, a passion for vehicle testing shines though in all of his work.\n\nA passion for photography from a young age makes Justin as comfortable behind the camera as in front of it, and capturing motoring memories from the scenery of beautiful Northern Ontario is a priority in much of his work. The particularly harsh winter climate in this part of Canada makes Justin a particular expert on winter driving, winter tires, and extreme-weather safety.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nJustin earned a Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) from Laurentian University in 2005.\n\nMajor awards won by the author\n\n2019 AJAC Video Journalism Award (Winner) 2019 AJAC Road Safety Journalism Award (Runner-Up) 2019 AJAC Automotive Writing (vehicle review topics) (Winner) 2019 AJAC Automotive Writing (technical topics) (Winner) 2018 AJAC Journalist of the Year\n\nContact info\n\nInstagram: @mr2pritch\n\nYoutube: @JustinPritchard\n\nPOPULAR VEHICLE COMPARISONS\n\nAffordable EVs\n\nSmall trucks\n\nPopular Crossover SUVs\n\nPractical 3-row SUVs\n\nMinivans for the whole family\n\nCompact Cars\n\nLuxury SUVs\n\nAffordable AWD SUVs\n\nDriving.ca's Blind-Spot Monitor\n\nAll things automotive: breaking news, reviews and more.
