        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Maverick\n\nA unisex name with American origins, Maverick may mean an unbranded animal or calf separated from its herd. The name means ‘an independent person who avoids conformity.’ Mostly given to boys, Maverick is a standout name that symbolizes someone independent, free-minded, and who likes to think outside society’s usual parameters. Although a given name, it was initially used as a surname in the 1900s.\n\nThe unisex name Maverick has attained popularity in the United States but does not hold the same status in other countries. The name also inspires a person to form a unique path with their life.\n\nIt only has one spelling Maverick. However, variations such as Maverik, Mavrick, or Mavric do exist.\n\nPop culture characters with humble roots in agriculture popularized the name. The word ‘maverick’ comes from Samuel Maverick, a politician, lawyer, and cattle farmer from Texas who lived in the 19th century. He refused to brand his cattle which was uncommon at the time. This incident led to people calling rebellious people with unbranded cattle ‘mavericks.’\n\nThe word ‘maverick’ entered the popular glossary because of the popularity of the ABC TV show Maverick. The show followed four honest and ethical brothers who won riches playing poker and then traveled to some beautiful places on their horses.\n\nRecently, the name garnered a fan following after the success of the successful and superhit film Top Gun in 1986 and its sequel Top Gun: Maverick starring Tom Cruise in 2022. He played the lead character of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, a rebellious fighter pilot.\n\nThe name Maverick may sound familiar because of the famous NBA basketball team Dallas Mavericks who have one NBA Championship under their belt.\n\nHow To Pronounce Maverick?\n\n‘Maverick’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Maverick\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Maverick famous with their contributions in various fields.
