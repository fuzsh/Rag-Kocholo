        "text": "Expectations for this sequel have been sky high ever since it was initially announced, with fans eagerly anticipating their reunion with Maverick and company. Cruise knew that that there was an indescribable pressure on his shoulders, but he made sure to deliver the goods. This is a sequel that not only respects the original film, but is able to stand on its own two feet effortlessly. The past informs the present in the film, especially in regards to the character of Maverick. Cruise delivers one of his best performances yet, tapping into the emotional fallout of Goose’s death from the original film and giving the character a sense of maturity and gravitas he didn’t previously have. It’s rare that audiences see a film that not only showcases Tom Cruise the stunt performer and action star, but the actor as well.\n\nThe supporting performances are excellent as well, with Glen Powell and Miles Teller being the other two standouts amongst the cast. The former is essentially the “Iceman” to the latter’s “Maverick” in the film, showcasing his charm and notable magnetism as he pushes his buttons throughout. As for Teller, he’s also delivering one of the best performances of his career, proving to be a perfect fit for the character of Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw. His friction-heavy scenes with Maverick are some of the best in the film, the tension and history palpable with each look and verbal exchange. Cruise and Teller bring out the best in one another and their dynamic is one of the best assets the film has in its stunning arsenal.\n\nAside from the performances, this is a sequel that is sure to give fans the adrenaline rush they are hoping for and then some. Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski, who previously helmed Tron: Legacy, Only The Brave, and Oblivion, which also starred Cruise, made the wise choice of electing to shoot the aerial sequences practically and in-camera. As a result, the aerial sequences are easily the best ever put to film. Not only are these sequences extremely immersive, but the pairing of the impressive camera work and stellar sound design make them jaw-dropping. Each sequence is able to top the last and the third act action sequence is an all-timer, especially because of how wonderfully unpredictable it becomes. As iconic as the aerial scenes in the original film are, they simply can’t compete with the sequel’s.\n\nHowever, the film’s strongest asset is its warm, beating heart that is fully on display throughout. This sequel certainly lives up to its title, fleshing out Maverick in new, unexpected ways as he finally grows into the man he was always meant to become. There are several scenes that hit all the right emotional notes, delivering the emotional punch that feels earned, not manufactured. The sizable gap in time between the original and this sequel works to the film’s advantage, especially as Maverick interacts with old, familiar characters and the new set of pilots he must train. The character was never shallow, but he has never felt more three-dimensional than he does in this film, which is due in large part to Cruise’s fantastic performance and a sharp script from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nThe only flaw the film possesses is a relatively minor one. The sequel certainly doesn’t waste a single second of screen time, moving along at a brisk, effective pace. However, when it comes to the new set of pilots introduced in the film, they aren’t given much time to shine. Aside from Teller’s character, we don’t learn much about his fellow pilots and as a result, they feel a bit two-dimensional despite some solid performances. It’s clear it was a sacrifice the film needed to make in order to not overstay its welcome, but the sequel could’ve benefited from slightly more development when it came to these supporting characters."
