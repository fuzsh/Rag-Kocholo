        "text": "20 Questions | Spelling | Dictation\n\nREADING:\n\nTom Cruise's latest film has broken box office records. The movie \"Top Gun: Maverick\" was in the biggest ever number of North American movie theatres. The magazine \"Variety\" said that 4,732 cinemas in the USA and Canada showed \"Maverick\". This makes it the widest release of all time. The movie broke another record. It is the best Memorial Day opening film in history. It took $156 million in the USA. This beats Johnny Depp's 2007 movie \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\". Maverick also gave Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise his first ever $100 million opening weekend.\n\nMaverick is the sequel to the 1986 film \"Top Gun\". Cruise again plays US navy pilot Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. The production company was happy that \"Maverick\" has done so well. A spokesperson said: \"These results are ridiculously, over-the-top fantastic. I'm happy for everyone. I'm happy for…the filmmakers.\" The movie has great reviews from critics. A UK newspaper called it a \"thrilling\" blockbuster. Another newspaper called it \"absurdly exciting,\" and \"the best studio action film in years\". At first, Cruise did not want to make the movie. He is happy he did.\n\nThis page has all the levels, listening and reading for this lesson.\n\n← Back to the Top Gun: Maverick lesson."
