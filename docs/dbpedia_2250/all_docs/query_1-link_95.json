        "text": "DISASTROID – Recently, Studio SQ shared an independent band with me and their called: DISASTROID. Whoa. Very, very cool name for a band of any Rock genre. To make the situation even better, the music of DISASTROID is very, very cool too. Very cool. Damn cool. Cool as hell. In other Metal words, Stone digs the two songs I’ve been listening to from DISASTROID.\n\nDISASTROID are from The Bay Area (California) and can easily be tagged as Stoner and Hard Rock Rock meets Grunge. However, there are many musical influences happening within the sound from this band; Even a hint of Punk vibe seem to weave its way about in both songs: Low and Money and Guilt. At the end of the day, it’s Rock ‘N Roll, it’s heavy and damn fun to hear.\n\nI really appreciate the “free spirit” style that DISASTROID exhibits musically. This band plays loose while still coming across as a tight unit. Both songs are obviously produced quite well, while still maintaining a fun “garage-style” atmosphere; which seems to be missing too often in the world of Rock today. The vocals of Enver Koneya remind me of the super legendary Chris Cornell. Regardless, Enver still comes across as original to my ears.\n\nFans of Queens of the Stone Age to fans of Army Of Anyone, with all other fans in-between and on the side, should get a Rockin’ kick from the memorable Rock ‘N Roll DISASTROID has created.\n\nBelow the live group shot, there are 2 links for 2 songs; which will give you a taste for what the Heavy Rock ‘N Roll of DISASTROID sounds like. Don’t hesitate! Click them cool links, listen to some DISASTROID and leave a comment about what you’ve heard! Your Metal voice counts, here at Metal Odyssey!\n\n“Low” – http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14759375/Virb/artists/Disastroid/Low.mp3\n\n“Money and Guilt” – http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14759375/Virb/artists/Disastroid/MoneyAndGuilt.mp3\n\nDISASTROID – Official Press Release:\n\nDISASTROID – From time to time one stumbles on a record that simply kicks ass. Disastroid’s upcoming LP “Money and Guilt” is no exception. This rock epic takes the listener on a ride through a minefield of tempo changes, metric modulation, and other surprises that turn your guts. By and large it employs the best that rock has to offer while showcasing refined musicianship and purpose.\n\nHuge guitar tone, heavy riffs, driving rhythms, and melodic vocals are the salient components of Disastroid’s music. While their sound can be reminiscent to some of the heroes of 90’s rock (Melvins, Rollins Band, Jesus Lizard, Soundgarden, etc.), the band has a hard time labeling their work. As frontman Enver Koneya points out “We have no real formula… we just make music that pleases ourselves. It just so happens that others like the sound as well.”\n\nEnver assembled Disastroid in San Francisco from spare parts he found on Craigslist. After recording an EP on his own, Travis Williams jumped on board taking over the bass chair. Travis has had great influence on the direction of the group and over the past three years he and Enver have prolifically written and recorded three albums, most recently with Braden McGaw on drums.\n\nSince their inception Disatroid has been busy. In addition to recording the group has been gaining fans steadily as they perform along the west coast. They’ve also managed to amass a devoted following in their home base of San Francisco, a city which tends to be oriented toward the clinically critical and the cynically hipster.\n\nThey were recently featured in Thrasher Magazine and have accumulated tons of local and national attention. On Disastroid’s horizon is a tour to the Pacific Northwest to support their release of “Money and Guilt”.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\n(Source: Studio SQ)\n\n* For more info & tour dates for DISASTROID, click on the link below!\n\nhttp://disastroid-music.blogspot.com/\n\nLONG LIVE DISASTROID.\n\nStone."
