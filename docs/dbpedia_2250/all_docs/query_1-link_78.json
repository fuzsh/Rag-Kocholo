Following their crushingly successful 2014 Australian Tour, Brazilian Metal Icons SEPULTURA unleash a heavy metal hurricane upon the Sepulnation in May 2018.\n\n“one of my absolute favourite shows; one that I only wish I could relive time and time again” – Metal Obsession (Melbourne Review 2014)\n\nArmed with their finest album in decades ‘Machine Messiah’, SEPULTURA emerge into a troubled world with extraordinary songs guaranteed to lift the spirits of any loyal metalhead. SEPULTURA are legends and are responsible for the existence of several of your favourite thrash metal bands today!\n\n‘’Sepultura deserve all the respect’’ – Metal Rules\n\nThe band’s total command of the stage is cemented in place by blistering live performances that have remained a constant threat to all contemporaries.

Just reading those song titles paint a picture of you losing your shit in a circle pit – this is the power of SEPULTURA!\n\n‘The quartet turns a metal crowd into a mass of headbanging maniacs’ – Heavy Metal Bands Info (Brisbane Review 2014)\n\nJoining Sepultura in this headlong rush into mayhem are one of the most influential Thrash Metal bands ever – DEATH ANGEL. A peek through a time portal to the Bay Area Scene in the 80s would reveal Metallica’s Cliff Burton at the front of the stage at Ruthie’s Inn banging his head to Death Angel’s inventive style, and speedy, complex arrangements. But who needs HG Wells when you can see the real thing here and now at a venue half an hour from home? Buzzsaw speed riffs, double kick drum bedlam, and scorching vocals are just a few of the elements which define the uncompromising urgency that is DEATH ANGEL. Three decades into their celebrated career, DEATH ANGEL remain as hungry as ever.\n\nWith the critically acclaimed double barrel blast to the system delivered by SEPULTURA and DEATH ANGEL, metal fans will be electrified with horns in the air euphoria. We kid you not.
