Seven albums into their career and DEATH ANGEL has never been stronger or more vital to the scene. Among one of the youngest bands ever to storm the metal world, DEATH ANGEL have come to be known as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the 80s Bay Area Thrash Metal scene. DEATH ANGEL weren’t just a band, they were family! Originally formed in 1982 by five cousins, including surviving members guitarists Rob Cavestany and vocalist Mark Osegueda, a thrashumentary tells the story of the bands incredible musical journey and of a dream that called for blood.\n\na thrashumentary DVD Chapter List:\n\n01.
