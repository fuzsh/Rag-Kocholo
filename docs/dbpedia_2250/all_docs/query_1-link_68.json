        "text": "The raging documentary about the history of Bay Area thrash metal music premiered this afternoon in San Francisco and just as you’d expect, it was a wild scene. From the opening reception at the swanky bar of the Kabuki Theater — where we spotted heavy metal legends like Dave Ellefson of Megadeth, Gary Holt of Exodus/Slayer fame, and Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy — to the jubilant crowd attending the screening, the afternoon was as loud as the music that it showcased.\n\nDirected by Adam Dubin, the film contains over fifty interviews with various metal legends (including Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Testament, and Death Angel). Loosely based on a 2012 photo journal of the same name by Harald Oimoen and Brian Lew, Dubin explained in a press release what inspired him to make the movie.\n\n“What I loved about the book is that it wasn’t just about Metallica,” says Dubin. “It was documenting a vibrant scene, where all the bands were equal and there was real camaraderie. The photos captured the sweat of the clubs, the ringing in your ears and the power of young people. Harald and Brian captured the humanity of it, and they understood that I was somebody who could bring that out in a film.”\n\nThe film premiere will be followed by a performance at the Fillmore tonight from Metal Allegiance featuring Alex Skolnick (Testament), Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Dave Ellefson (Megadeth) and Mark Menghi. Gary Holt of Exodus/Slayer will also be making an appearance."
