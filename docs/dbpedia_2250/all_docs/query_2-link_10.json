        "text": "491\n\nCalifornia is so vast that there are multiple locations where you could do a literary walking tour. We recently created our own version for Los Angeles before heading off to San Francisco. SF is rather different from its noir ‚ÄòSin City‚Äô counterpart. Throughout history, the metropolis has nurtured bohemian countercultures. With its diverse populace, acceptance of unconventional behaviour, and detachment from mainstream cultural and political hubs, SF has consistently provided a haven for nonconformist thinkers, creators, and visionaries. As a result, here‚Äôs our literary tour of San Francisco.\n\nWhy is San Francisco famous for its literary culture?\n\nSan Francisco‚Äôs literary scene is celebrated for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it holds a consequential place in literary history, being pivotal in movements like the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the countercultural upheavals of the 1960s. Writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti were key figures during these times, painting vivid portraits of the city‚Äôs lively and unconventional ambience through their works.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth checking out Nancy J. Peters‚Äô 1998 essay ‚ÄúBeat Generation and San Francisco‚Äôs Culture of Dissent.‚Äù She writes that the concept of bohemia captivated writers in early San Francisco, inspired by Henri Murger‚Äôs ‚ÄúSc√®nes de la Vie de Boh√®me‚Äù (1844). This work portrayed life in Paris‚Äôs Latin Quarter, where artists had been forsaking their bourgeois backgrounds since the revolution of 1830 to pursue love and a more egalitarian society. By the 1860s word of it had reached San Francisco writers.\n\nAt this moment in history, many writers were manual labourers, shopkeepers, housewives, and transient individuals. The gritty tales of pioneers and miners, who endured the perils of migration and settlement, were often so intense that they rivalled the most imaginative fiction.\n\nRead: Los Angeles literary tour: self-guided itinerary of the best sights\n\nPeters states: ‚ÄúThe city‚Äôs earliest literature, then, was both democratic and anarchic; at the same time, the lawlessness of the city seemed to elicit from some of its poets a nostalgia for classical literary forms and an imagined lost civility of remote times and places‚Äù. For 18 months during the 1860s, Mark Twain worked as a journalist in San Francisco. The experience was critical in his development as a writer.\n\nAs a result, the city‚Äôs diverse population and progressive ethos have cultivated an environment where writers from all walks of life feel welcome. This inclusivity is seen in the wide array of voices and viewpoints that flourish within its borders.\n\nSan Francisco also boasts an abundance of institutions, such as the renowned City Lights Bookstore, founded by Ferlinghetti, which champions avant-garde literature. The city hosts various literary gatherings, festivals, and readings that provide platforms for emerging writers to showcase their talents.\n\nIts natural beauty and distinctive setting also play a considerable role in its allure. From the iconic Golden Gate Bridge to the mist-shrouded hills, San Francisco‚Äôs picturesque landscapes have served as a wellspring of inspiration for countless writers over the years.\n\nThe Golden City‚Äôs literary influence extends far beyond its geographical boundaries, shaping American literature. Its writers have fearlessly tackled pressing social and political issues, explored themes of identity and belonging, and captured the essence of urban life. So much so, that we spotted much support for the Palestinian cause at various locations.\n\nHere are some of the best literary spots on the San Francisco tour:\n\nLet me start by saying that San Francisco is far smaller than LA, which means it‚Äôs more accessible to get around. With a population of more than 808,000, San Francisco is just a small part of the more than 3.3 million people within the entire metro area. Compare that to LA, which spans 503 square miles with a metropolitan area of 4,850 square miles, and it seems like a town in comparison. However, San Francisco has multiple islands that require crossing via bridges and boats.\n\nSo there are a few parts of SF you could explore without venturing too far afield within a day. However, if you have a little more time, you can venture out to both Shakespeare Garden on the other side of the city, as well as opt for a trip to Alcatraz ‚Äì which is highly recommended.\n\nüìö Robert Frost Plaza. This plaza in the Marina District is named after the American poet Robert Frost. It features a statue of Frost and a plaque with one of his poems. It‚Äôs also a nice spot to check out San Francisco‚Äôs famous trams.\n\nüìöCoit Tower. Bypassing North Beach to get to the highest point, this iconic San Francisco landmark atop Telegraph Hill is connected to Dashiell Hammett‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Maltese Falcon.‚Äù It offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city and the bay. It is $10 to get in, and while there is a 90-year-old rickety lift, it‚Äôs not always in service, so it‚Äôs worth bearing in mind as you‚Äôd have to climb 13 flights of stairs.\n\nRead: Paris literary tour: top spots to visit for book lovers\n\nüìö The Beat Museum. This museum in North Beach is dedicated to the Beat Generation and features exhibits on Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and other writers of the movement. You‚Äôll find memorabilia, photos, and first editions of their works. It is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and costs $8 to gain entry.\n\nüìö City Lights Bookstore. This North Beach standby is a mecca for bibliophiles, and was a meeting place for the Beat Generation writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. The store was founded by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Peter D. Martin in 1953 and is beside the Jack Kerouac Alley and across the road from the Beat Museum. Browse through the shelves or grab a cappuccino at the cafe and soak up the literary vibes.\n\nüìöJack Kerouac Alley. As mentioned, this alleyway between Grant Avenue and Columbus Avenue in North Beach is named after the Beat Generation novelist. It‚Äôs adorned with murals depicting scenes from his book ‚ÄúOn the Road‚Äù and is a popular spot for literary pilgrimages. It also has quotes from his book on the walls.\n\nRead: Brussels literary tour: top spots from Bronte, Bozar, to Boutique Tintin\n\nüìöRobert Louis Stevenson Monument. The outdoor memorial commemorating Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson is in Portsmouth Square in Chinatown. Stevenson lived in San Francisco for a time and wrote parts of his famous novel ‚ÄúTreasure Island‚Äù here. It was erected in 1972 by The California Historical Society. The inscription reads: ‚ÄúTo Remember Robert Louis Stevenson. To be honest, to be kind ‚Äì to earn a little, to spend a little less ‚Äì to make upon the whole a family happier for his presence ‚Äì to renounce when that shall be necessary, and not be embittered ‚Äì to keep a few friends but these without capitulation ‚Äì above all on the same grim condition to keep friends with himself ‚Äì here is a task for all that a man has of fortitude and delicacy.‚Äù\n\nüìöSan Francisco Public Library. Founded in 1977, the San Francisco Public Library is a cornerstone of city culture, offering extensive resources and community programmes. It houses important special collections, including those dedicated to Robert Frost and Sherlock Holmes, as well as a trove of 1,500 volumes by Californian authors. There are also first editions of novels by Jack London. There are tours that take place here.\n\nVisiting further afield from San Francisco\n\nYou can‚Äôt visit SF without taking a trip out to Alcatraz. While primarily known as a former prison, Alcatraz is often the subject of various crime novels, especially its association with famous criminals like Al Capone. Brandon Sanderson, who has been helping change guidelines for Audible‚Äôs audiobooks, is also the writer behind the Alcatraz fantasy series. Fleur Bradley also pens a children‚Äôs book series inspired by the island called ‚ÄúDaybreak on Raven Island.‚Äù\n\nThe only way of reaching Alcatraz is via a 12-minute ferry ride managed by Alcatraz City Cruises, LLC. Their location is on The Embarcadero, close to the junction of Bay Street, just a short distance southeast of Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf. Parking facilities are not available at Pier 33. The tours can be pricey, starting at $45.25 per person and can sell out quickly, so it‚Äôs worth booking ahead. There is also a seasonal schedule, hence the timings change according to the month. It isn‚Äôt that accessible, but there are lifts to get to different parts of the dilapidated prison. There is a buggy that goes from the boat up the hill to the actual complex, but it runs at certain times, so make sure you check the timings when you‚Äôre there.\n\nAside from Alcatraz, Shakespeare Garden within Golden Gate Park is dedicated to the works of the Bard himself. It features plants mentioned in his plays and provides a peaceful dreamy escape. The greenscape was established in 1928 near the city‚Äôs botanical gardens. Interspersed among all the floral patches are citations from Shakespeare‚Äôs various comedies, sonnets, and tragedies. There‚Äôs also a bust of the playwright, which is said to be only one of two in existence.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to check out‚Ä¶"
