        "text": "On the same day that Hell’s Angels attacked antiwar protesters in Oakland, another landmark event for a developing youth culture took place in San Francisco. In the first large concert to feature bands from the city’s local scene, the Family Dog collective organized a dance featuring the music of the Jefferson Airplane and the Charlatans at the Longeshoreman’s Hall, near Fisherman’s Wharf in the North Beach neighborhood. During the previous summer, the Family Dog had moved from Pine Street in San Francisco to the nearly abandoned mining town of Virginia City, Nevada, where the group refurbished a saloon for the purpose of hosting dances and performances in an old Western environment. The house band was the Charlatans, who dressed in Edwardian and Western clothing for shows that were theatrical spectacles as much as musical performances. The October 16 show at Longshoreman’s Hall was the first of several concerts organized by the Family Dog after their return to San Francisco from Virginia City.\n\nAlthough the British Invasion and folk rock were making a significant impact, in 1965 music was not yet the main catalyst for the growing counterculture. Drugs, particularly marijuana and LSD, and the shared experience of the “trip,” were the foundations of the San Francisco scene. At this time, music was more closely tied to dancing than it would be by the end of the 1960s, and it served to expand the sensory exploration and distortion of an acid trip. Whereas marijuana had a longstanding presence among jazz and R&B musicians, LSD initially came to the Bay Area through Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. The “acid tests” they organized in late 1965—the first near Santa Cruz, the second in San Jose—were intended to spread the gospel of LSD’s liberating effects; the Grateful Dead (then known as the Warlocks) developed their improvisational style playing at these events.\n\nLSD was first synthesized in a Swiss lab in 1938, but it reached American youth in the 1960s by way of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and scientific research. The drug was a product of the postwar system that linked the military and the scientific community in the warfare state, the same system that some students had begun to challenge in the mid-1960s. LSD came to the attention of the CIA during its search for techniques of mind control, in Project MKUltra. The drug’s powerful impact on the mind was immediately apparent, but the CIA was unsure about how they could use it: “First they thought it was a truth serum, then a lie serum, and for a while they didn’t know what to think.” In the name of research, the CIA conducted numerous experiments with LSD on unwitting subjects, mainly from socially marginal or compromised populations, but also on their own unsuspecting agents.As a student at Stanford University, Ken Kesey first encountered LSD as a voluntary participant in Project MKUltra experiments at the VA hospital in Menlo Park.\n\nOne of the supreme ironies of the 1960s was that the CIA, like Dr. Frankenstein, put into circulation a drug that helped so many people see through the lies and doublespeak of the U.S. government and its war machine. LSD’s infiltration of American society was a direct result of the Cold War apparatus that married science with warfare, yet the drug activated opposition to the war machine and the calculating, conformist thought that defined postwar modernity. In the early 1960s, many psychiatrists saw favorable results in using LSD as a therapeutic tool for treating a wide range of persistent conditions, such as chronic alcoholism—more than 1,000 clinical papers, involving some 40,000 patients, were written about LSD therapy. This research came to a sudden end in 1962, however, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated LSD as an “experimental drug” that had to be tightly controlled, thus making it virtually impossible for psychiatrists to legally obtain. Nevertheless, the genie was out of the bottle, and LSD would remain legal for another 4 years. As Andrei Codrescu wrote, “The undeniably metaphysical window that LSD opened for so many of us may have unwittingly been opened by those interests lay in keeping it shut. It may well be that, seeing their mistake, they have been trying to close it ever since.”\n\nThe nucleus of this emerging subculture based on LSD was the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco. In 1965, this neighborhood was in a state of visible deterioration, with numerous vacant storefronts along Haight Street and an ample supply of Victorian houses available for low rents. Whereas the Beat subculture was centered in the largely Italian and Chinese neighborhood of North Beach until the early 1960s, rents began increasing as the area accumulated cultural cachet—a comparable dynamic was pushing the hub of bohemian New York to the east, away from Greenwich Village. Community protests barely saved the Haight-Ashbury district from the wrecking ball of urban renewal, while much of the neighboring Western Addition and Fillmore district had been demolished. The Fillmore district was the largest black neighborhood in San Francisco, and in the 1940s, it became a vital center in the national jazz scene–the Fillmore was known as “the Harlem of the West.” Urban renewal destroyed this neighborhood and scattered the city’s black population, mainly to the streets above Golden Gate Park’s panhandle. Indeed, numerous racial conflicts would erupt once hippies started moving to the Haight en masse in 1966.\n\nAlthough the “acid rock” that emerged from the Haight-Ashbury heralded a decisive shift in musical style, the musicians in the scene had started out playing folk, blues, R&B, or jazz. The genesis of the Grateful Dead, for example, was in the folk scene in Palo Alto, 30 miles south of San Francisco, where Jerry Garcia worked as a banjo and guitar instructor in the early 1960s. The earliest influences for Garcia and the band’s second guitarist, Bob Weir, were bluegrass, folk, and roots music, and they were among the many musicians of their generation captivated by Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music. On the other hand, Phil Lesh, the band’s bass player, came from a jazz background and maintained a strong interest in avant-garde composition. With the Grateful Dead, Lesh explored new methods for playing the bass in a more improvisational style, not just as a timekeeping rhythmic instrument. The band’s original singer, Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, represented a third musical lineage rooted in rhythm & blues, which was largely inherited from his father, a DJ at a local black radio station.\n\nThe national popularity of folk music in the early 1960s, especially among college students, spawned a number of local scenes outside of New York and the Bay Area. Janis Joplin, one of the most iconic figures to emerge from San Francisco, got her start in 1962 as a blues singer and guitar player in the folk scene in Austin, Texas. Joplin travelled to San Francisco and then to New York’s Lower East Side, but “by the end of 1964 Janis was a speed freak,” and so she returned to Texas to get away from the scene. She returned to San Francisco with Chet Helms of the Family Dog in 1966, this time shacking up in the Haight-Ashbury to become the lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company. The founding members of Big Brother had also started as musicians playing folk and the blues in the Bay Area’s coffeehouse circuit of the early 1960s.\n\nThe first band from San Francisco to achieve commercial success was the Jefferson Airplane. The group’s founder, Marty Balin, had opened the Matrix, a nightclub featuring live music on Fillmore Street, and the Jefferson Airplane took shape in 1965 as the club’s house band. The other members were musicians who had been playing folk, the blues, and other forms of traditional music in Bay Area clubs and coffeehouses. The Jefferson Airplane was the first of the San Francisco rock groups to get signed by a record label—RCA released their debut album in August 1966. Grace Slick joined the band a couple of months after that, leaving behind her previous group, the Great Society. Two of the songs Slick brought with her, “Somebody to Love” and “White Rabbit,” became hit singles in 1967, reinforcing the association between San Francisco, psychedelic drugs, and a communal spirit of “love.”"
