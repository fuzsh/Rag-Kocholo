We’ve earned the credit: our tech giants have become the dynamo of the American economy, and our unorthodox, fertile business environment incubates many of the world’s most successful and innovative companies.\n\nAnd this tendency toward innovation is anything but a recent trend. They say that in New York, the emphasis is on the new, but the Big Apple has nothing on San Francisco when it comes to world-changing innovations. Today we’re going to look at three that most people will find pretty familiar: the Martini, the jukebox and the television.\n\nThe Martini - The Occidental Hotel, Montgomery Street\n\nThe Martini: a simple cocktail of gin and dry vermouth, garnished with an olive or a twist of lemon. The drink is such a staple of bar culture, it’s hard to imagine a world without them. And while there are a lot of stories surrounding the birth of this most iconic of cocktails, the most persistent all seem to pit the bartenders at San Francisco’s Occidental Hotel against those of an anonymous saloon in Martinez.\n\nThe gist of the story is this: in the mid-1800’s, a lucky miner fresh from the Sierra Nevadas rolled into nearby Martinez, CA for a little celebration. Gold dust burning a hole in his pocket, he knocked the dirt from his clothes and demanded champagne. There being no bubbly in the house, the bartender got creative and shook up (or was it stirred?) a brand-new cocktail: gin, with a splash of white wine.\n\nPatented under the name Coin ActuatedAttachment for Phonograph, the contraption was an immediate success, reportedly earning over $1,000 in its first six months of use. In time the invention prompted scores of imitators, and jukeboxes eventually became ubiquitous in drinking establishments across the country. Jukeboxes were actually a key source of income for music publishers, and at one point in the 1940s, three-quarters of the records produced in the U.S. winded up in jukeboxes.\n\nAlas, the advent of portable radios and cassette decks spelled doom for the jukebox industry, and today there are only two companies still producing them (Rock-ola is one of them). But they remain an enduring part of 20th Century Americana (and notably, they are still one of the defining traits of the Classic Dive Bar).\n\nThe Television - Philo Farnsworth’s Lab at 202 Green Street\n\nThe charms of North Beach are beyond number, and the neighborhood has always played a big part in the story of San Francisco. But few realize that our perfect little corner of the universe also gave birth to one of the most influential electronic gizmos the world has ever seen: the modern television.\n\nIn September of 1927, Philo Farnsworth transmitted the first image with his “image dissector camera tube” at his laboratory on North Beach’s Green Street. Less than a year later he was demonstrating a working model to the San Francisco press. Television had become a reality.\n\nOf course, it would be 1936 before the first public broadcast, and in the intervening years, there was a lot of work for the attorneys. A fellow named Vladimir Zworykin had been experimenting with the cathode ray tube while working for Westinghouse Electric; it seems he had an overlapping patent claim that went back to 1923. RCA ended up owning that patent, and they did everything they could to wrest control of the technology away from Farnsworth. After being frustrated in the courts, RCA finally agreed to pay Farnsworth $1 million and licensing fees, and went forward with their plans to develop the technology for the commercial market.\n\nFor good or bad, the subsequent rise of TV transformed the world in so many ways, it’s probably impossible to estimate the impact. The advent of television advertising in 1941 was the true birth of the American consumer market, and the adoption of the home video screen paved the way for a class of devices that would still be evolving over a century later.\n\nWhatever your thoughts on the matter, one thing is certain: the whole thing started just three blocks away on Telegraph Hill.\n\nMovies We Love: North Beach On The Big Screen, Part 1\n\nAs photogenic as our fair city is, San Francisco has always held a natural appeal for filmmakers. A brainier, more temperate alternative to the glitz of Hollywood, the Bay Area has been a northern sanctuary for movie types for decades. Many of them have chosen to shoot here in North Beach, and its hardly a surprise: with its italianate character and winding, picturesque alleyways, the place is like one big movie set. For your viewing pleasure, here are just a few of our favorite films featuring scenes of North Beach and Telegraph Hill. We'll start with one of the most famous films in movie history...\n\nVertigo\n\nOf all the movies featuring scenes of North Beach, the most iconic is Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo (1958), starring Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak. Considered by many to be the best thriller ever made, the film was shot all over the city, but Hitchcock’s choice of locations shows the director’s particular fondness for North Beach. Case in point: legendary hotspot Ernie’s Restaurant, which until 1995 occupied 847 Montgomery just below Broadway, was immortalized in the film. Four scenes were filmed there, and Hitchcock had both the interior and exterior meticulously reconstructed on a soundstage in Hollywood to allow for panorama shots the restaurant didn’t permit.\n\nHitchcock was a devoted fan of the restaurant, especially their selection of first-growth bordeaux, and dined there regularly when he was in San Francisco–which was often. He even cast the actual bartender and maître’ d’ as themselves in the picture, flying them to Hollywood to film, where they had the rare chance to mingle with the celebrity cast.\n\nThe film’s most recognizable shot of our corner of the city wasn’t filmed at Ernie’s, however. That honor goes to the memorable sequence filmed at 900 Lombard Street atop Russian Hill. Before you protest and say that isn’t North Beach, take a closer look at the photo below. In the scene, Madeleine (Novak) has just arrived at Scotty’s apartment (Stewart) to leave him a thank you note for saving her after she chucked herself in the bay at Fort Point. As she climbs out of her Green Jaguar, she is unaware that she has been followed (ok, it’s a long story–we recommend it). Point being, in the background of the shot you can see another star: Telegraph Hill’s very own Coit Tower.\n\nAnother thing few people know: the chase was originally supposed to continue across the Golden Gate Bridge, but apparently the city would have none of it. And contrary to popular belief, McQueen did little of the breakneck driving captured in the film. He was a red-hot Hollywood property at the time, and the studio couldn't take the chance; stuntman Loren James was actually behind the wheel for 90% of the shots. For more details on the shoot from the man himself, click here.\n\nDirty Harry\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of tough guys, North Beach has played host to more than one macho movie icon over the years. With Dirty Harry (1971), Clint Eastwood created a character that will be forever lodged in the cranium of American pop culture. Harry Callahan was gruff, no-nonsense, and well-armed with an envy-inducing .44 magnum, a certain breed of Hollywood antihero. Explosively violent, but typically stoic until time came for the perfect line, he claims one of the most famous in cinema history in this film: ‘You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?’\n\nFrom Arnold Schwarzenegger to Bruce Willis, action heroes have been ripping this guy off forever.\n\nWhat many forget is that one of the key scenes in Dirty Harry was filmed (or shot, I suppose) right in the middle of North Beach. The scene starts with Saints Peter and Paul Church, the camera panning south across the park to the Dante Building where ‘Scorpio,’ the movie’s main perp, is perched with a sniper’s rifle. The scene concludes with a rooftop-to-rooftop shootout, but Scorpio escapes and continues to menace the public until finally being dispatched by Callahan at the end of the film.\n\nUnlike Steve McQueen, Eastwood did all of his own stunts in the film, including one in which he jumps from a bridge on to the roof of a moving bus. And though the Callahan character (loosely based on David Toschi, chief investigator on the Zodiac Killer case) is considered by many to be Eastwood’s signature role, he was anything but the first choice. The part was first offered to a half-dozen other leading men, including John Wayne, Frank Sinatra….and Steve McQueen.\n\nThe Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill\n\nLest you think North Beach cinema short on sensitivity, we’ll conclude this list with Judy Levin’s The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill (2003). An award-winning documentary, it focuses on the relationship between a local flock of wild parrots and a bohemian musician living in a cabin on Telegraph Hill (Mark Bittner, who wrote the book of the same name). A deeply personal film, it’s a love letter to our corner of San Francisco, with too many breathtaking shots to count.\n\nServed with fresh bread alongside a toothsome combination of small potatoes, pickled onions, gherkins, and cured meat, raclette is the quintessential Swiss comfort food. If you’ve never tried it, you’re in for a rare treat; there is nothing more enticing than the smell of roasting cheese as it fills up the room on a Winter evening. And when it finally hits your plate, the tangy, gooey raclette is everything you expect, perfectly balanced by the accoutrements.\n\nRaclette is generally paired with a white wine like a riesling or pinot gris, served only semi-cool to aid digestion. The Swiss have historically advised against drinking water with the dish, as it can ‘harden the cheese’ in your stomach (a likely story). Whatever the case, we particularly enjoy it with a nice glass of our Gruner Veltliner.\n\nThe history of Raclette goes back over 700 years, the dish originating with peasants in the Swiss Alps who would carry the cheese rounds along with them into the mountains as they herded cows, and heat them up next to the campfire at night to scrape on to their bread. The practice has survived over the centuries, and thankfully you don’t have to go through any of that. Just come by Mondays between 6:30 and 10:00, bring your appetite, and we’ll take care of the rest. Full plates go for $18, and you can have yours without meat for $15.\n\nOutside of a few lines in Time Magazine, the affair initially received scant attention, and it was largely ignored by the French press. When it was mentioned across the Atlantic at all, it was in a tone of utter ridicule; the reputation of French wines was ironclad, and most Europeans considered the results a fluke. The sensitivity of France was particularly understandable: most of the French competitors came from the ’70 vintage, judged by Conseil Interprofessionel du Vin de Bordeaux to be among France’s best of the previous half-century.\n\nWhen it was further suggested that the California wines would never hold up to their French counterparts over time, a rematch was clearly in order. In a second blind tasting held at the Vintner’s Club in San Francisco almost 2 years after the Paris event, the California wines actually improved their standing, nabbing all three top spots for both chardonnay and cabernet. There have been a number of re-tastings over the years (of the reds, the whites being past their prime), yielding similar results. Amazingly, the upstart Californians had not only bested their French elders out of the gate, their wines appeared to be aging better as well.\n\nMeanwhile, all of this attention was having a tremendous effect on the California wine industry. At the time of original Paris tasting, there were less than 70 wineries in Napa. Today there are at least six times that many, depending how you count. Mike Grgich, the winemaker who created the winning chardonnay for Château Montelena, broke ground on Grgich Estates the following year. Though he went on to become a legend in the winemaking community, at the time Grgich was just another young winemaker among many, throwing his hat into the ring behind the optimism of the Judgment of Paris. After 1976, Napa would never be the same.\n\nInterestingly, none of this was Spurrier’s plan. His livelihood was French wines, and the wine merchant arranged the event with the full expectation that the near-mythical French estates would crush the fledgling California vintners. Though he had tasted a few California wines, he didn’t have access to the best of them in London, and actually purchased the wines for the competition (two bottles of each) on a trip to California with his wife. (As you can imagine, Spurrier's well-intentioned efforts didn’t exactly endear him to French vintners, and at one point he was barred from participating in France’s prestigious wine tasting tour circuit for an entire year.)\n\nBut the story wasn’t over, and indeed, the best was yet to come. In a grand 30th Anniversary tasting event (again arranged by Spurrier, and held in London and Napa simultaneously), a prestigious panel of 18 judges judged the now 30+ year-old wines once again. Many French (and francophiles) were convinced their wines would finally prevail after three decades of bottle aging. The results were stunning: the California wines completely dominated, claiming all five top spots. Napa was exultant.\n\nThe winning wines:\n\n1971 Ridge Vineyards Monte Bello\n\n1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars\n\n1971 Mayacamas Vineyards (3rd Place tie)\n\n1970 Heitz Wine Cellars 'Martha's Vineyard' (3rd Place tie)\n\n1972 Clos Du Val Winery\n\nIn retrospect, this is a very impressive roster of wines; that these wineries were largely unknown as late as 1976 is difficult to fathom today. And if you look more closely at the results, there was yet another upset to be found: Ridge Vineyards of the Santa Cruz Mountains had only placed fifth in ’76, but when the wines were tasted thirty years later, it stole first place. Just like Napa Valley, sometimes it takes a little while to show your true potential.\n\nOur ancestors were smart. We know that, because we are here today, living proof of their viability. They celebrated the solstice because they knew what was important, and that there was a time for everything: to plant, to harvest, to rest–and to party. I won’t pretend that we don’t have a lot of work ahead of us. But just like our ancestors, we have each other to count on. And in the meanwhile, we’ve got the rest of the weekend to party.\n\nThings move slowly in this system, sometimes so slowly that you can’t see them move at all. And sometimes it may even seem as if they are moving backwards. But the work gets done; the towers rise, more or less on schedule. As we toast each other this week, let’s keep that in mind, and remember just how fortunate we all are. It’s a long way to Spring, but together we’re going to get there.\n\nThank you all for reading the blog, and for making Belle Cora a big part of your year. Here's to a very Happy New Year, and I look forward to seeing you at the bar!\n\nVagabonds, Lunatics and Scoundrels in San Francisco History, Part 3\n\nIf there is one neighborhood that has set the tone for San Francisco and cemented its reputation for rebelliousness, it had to be the Barbary Coast. The environ we now call North Beach has had an enduring influence on the city’s development, and still does today. San Francisco’s no-holds-barred Barbary Coast origins still reverberate here and throughout the city, expressed in the innovation and boundless sense of possibility SF has come to be associated with in the modern age.\n\nBut as the city has learned, this anarchic spirit has its dark side. With license comes the licentious, and the annals of San Francisco are replete with the widest variety of reprobates, rapscallions and social outliers that any American city has ever seen. To document these noteworthy ne’er-do-wells, today we bring you the third edition of Vagabonds, Lunatics And Scoundrels in San Francisco History.\n\nTessie Wall\n\nWe’ll start back in the 19th Century, with the notorious and colorful madam Tessie Wall. Raised in San Francisco’s Mission District, Tessie was born in 1869, and by all accounts led a normal childhood. A comely and curvaceous young woman, she married early, supporting herself and an errant, alcoholic husband with her job as a housekeeper. But when she lost her first child to respiratory illness within months of his birth, the marriage foundered, and Tessie's path was forever altered.\n\nHer work in upper class homes had exposed her to the prurient predilections of her wealthy benefactors, and Tessie quickly found a way to put them to use. Once free of her husband, she purchased a bordello in the Tenderloin, and hired a coterie of young girls to staff her first venture. Business was brisk at Wall’s sumptuously appointed ‘parlor house,’ and she soon opened a second location. Her clubs were immensely popular among the city’s elite, and frequented by many of the society people whose homes Tessie used to clean.\n\nTessie was a natural promoter. She would secure the latest fashions straight from Paris and New York, adorning her ladies in them and staging parades on Market Street that dramatically increased business. She was also celebrated as a prodigious drinker, and once bested legendary boxer John L. Sullivan in a champagne marathon–after 21 glasses of the bubbly, the heavyweight champ was on the floor at Tessie’s feet.\n\nBut of all her notable features, it was her wild, romantic heart that secured Tessie’s enduring place in San Francisco history. Like many in her profession, she had a keen craving for social acceptance, and chose to marry a politician–prominent Republican Frank Daroux–who was also a club owner. But Daroux’s business was gambling, a vice that at the time didn’t interfere with his political career. Brothels were another matter though, and Daroux made no small effort to get his wife to leave the business. He even built her a house in the country at one point, but Tessie was headstrong to say the least, remarking that she would rather “be an electric light pole on Powell Street than own all the land in the sticks.”\n\nThe couple fought constantly, and the tempestuous marriage came to an end when Tessie learned that Daroux had betrayed her with another woman. Distraught, she followed him to the theater, where she confirmed what she had heard; seeing her husband with a strange woman on his arm was more than Tessie could bear. She waited in the shadows outside the theatre until he emerged and stepped onto the sidewalk, lighting a cigar. So deep was his reverie that he didn’t hear his wife’s approach. Tessie fired her revolver point blank into his chest, and as he fell backward, fired twice more.\n\nWhen the police arrived, Tessie was kneeling over her husband, weeping, the empty pistol in her hand. Asked why she had shot him, Tessie cried “I shot him ‘cause I love him, goddamn him!” Daroux survived, though his political career did not. Remarkably, although Tessie also tried to shoot his mistress through a café window soon afterward, neither ended up pressing charges. Tessie Wall returned to the bordello business, and died 16 years later at the age of 63–from an impacted tooth.\n\nOwsley Stanley\n\nNow we jump forward to the Summer of Love, a period not so much chronicled as mythologized by writers and the press in the decades since. In 1967, San Francisco was teeming with all things new, and extreme personalities and fabulous oddballs were the order of the day–along with plenty of psychedelic drugs. LSD was the elixir of choice, the X-factor, and it had its share of prominent champions, people like Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey–and Owsley Stanley.\n\nThe early manager and financier of the Grateful Dead, Owsley was responsible for creating the laboratory-grade LSD that helped define the late Sixties counterculture. He was reportedly the first to ever mass-produce the drug, in a bathtub near the Berkeley campus (a process he mastered during a marathon 3-week session at the university library).\n\nWith money flying in the door at an increasing rate, business acumen fell by the wayside. The brothers hired high school friends to help manage things, who reportedly spent much of their office hours drinking, drugging and shooting pool. At the center of the disorder was Artie Mitchell, whose cocaine and alcohol abuse had become so bad that friends begged Jim to intervene. On February 27, 1991, Jim drove to Artie’s home, armed with a .22 rifle he inherited from their father. The two argued, and Jim drew the rifle and shot his brother and longtime business partner dead. After a long trial, Jim Mitchell was prosecuted for voluntary manslaughter, and was released from San Quentin after serving only 3 years.\n\nOn July 12, 2007, Mitchell passed away at his ranch house in Sonoma, the victim of heart failure. His funeral was attended by former District Attorney Terence Hallinan, Mayor Willie Brown and some 300 others. Jim Mitchell was interred at Cherokee Memorial Park in Lodi, California, in the plot next to his brother Artie.\n\nYears later, tragedy struck the family again when Jim’s son Jim Mitchell was arrested for the Novato murder of his ex-girlfriend. The mother of his year-old daughter, Danielle Keller was bludgeoned to death by Mitchell with a baseball bat on her front lawn. During his trial, the partial heir to the Mitchell Brothers business and fortune claimed he was railroaded by the press and courts, and simply the victim of his ‘notorious’ Mitchell name. The jury wasn’t buying, and the younger Mitchell was sentenced to 35 years in prison.\n\nNorth Beach Echoes: Music Venues We Miss\n\nAmong its manifold charms, North Beach has one of the richest musical traditions of any neighborhood in America. In the popular imagination, North Beach and jazz are nearly synonymous, and it’s not hard to see why: from the long-forgotten Anxious Asp to the legendary Keystone Korner, this patch of land has hosted a phalanx of serious music venues. And the music hasn’t all been jazz–far from it.\n\nBut like all else, music clubs pass on. It’s sad to watch them go, and this little neighborhood has lost more stages than most cities will ever have. But they are like mushrooms in the cool, damp air: others always appear. Today we’ll take a glimpse back, and remember a few music establishments that North Beach will always miss.\n\nJazz Workshop - 473 Broadway\n\nWe’ll start the tour on Broadway, at the famed Jazz Workshop. One of the focal points for jazz on the West Coast during the genre’s heyday in the 60’s, it was opened on Broadway in 1958 by lawyer Art Auerbach. Immortalized by the many ‘Live at the Jazz Workshop’ recordings made there, the club inherited the all-star roster of downtown’s Blackhawk when it closed in 1963, and played host to a who’s who of jazz greats: Bird, Monk, Miles, Dizzy, Coltrane and dozens more.\n\nRock had largely replaced jazz as America's genre of choice at this point, and many of the jazz venues in the neighborhood had perished (or become topless clubs themselves). Regardless, Barkan’s decision proved a fortuitous pivot: just as Jazz Workshop had in the decade before, Keystone Korner quickly attracted the biggest names in the business. Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, McCoy Tyner, Dexter Gordon, Bill Evans and Stan Getz all performed at Keystone Korner, and the club rapidly grew into one of the best jazz clubs in America. The place was a favorite of many of the musicians who played there, and at the time Getz singled it out as “the number one jazz club in the world today.”\n\nThe club always struggled financially, but creatively it was a powerhouse, and Barkan was an infectiously enthusiastic ringleader, well-liked by his peers. When the business teetered, the community rallied behind the place, and benefits were periodically held to keep it afloat. In spite of the club’s fiscal troubles, everyone who worked there shared Barkan’s commitment to the place, and it fostered a loving, supportive atmosphere in which the musicians shined. Keystone Korner lasted eleven years under Barkan, and over the course of that time hosted hundreds of live recordings, many of which have have become parts of the jazz canon.\n\nIn 1983, Barkan appeared in an article on the front page of USA Today’s entertainment section naming the top three jazz clubs in America, his club among them. Ironically, Keystone Korner had just closed its doors.\n\nThe Anxious Asp - 528 Green Street\n\nAll but forgotten now, The Anxious Asp warrants a mention for its location alone - right across the street from Belle Cora, in the space now occupied by Tattoo Boogaloo. Popular with the beats in the Sixties (Kerouac read his poetry there), the Asp’s jukebox purportedly held the largest collection of Charlie Parker records west of the Mississippi River, and the bathroom walls were papered with pages from the Kinsey report.\n\nThe Asp was Janis Joplin’s favorite spot when she hung out in North Beach, and Jimi Hendrix is said to have habituated the place as well. Apparently Janis (this was before she became famous) was fond of singing along to the jukebox, so much so that annoyed regulars would yell at her to stop, and she was once beaten up out front by a couple of equally unappreciative bikers.\n\nSome accounts say it was a lesbian bar, some call it a bohemian haunt, but one thing is certain: everyone was welcome at the Anxious Asp. Alas, the club finished its run in late 1967.\n\nMabuhay Gardens - 435 Broadway\n\nOf all the venues to ever grace North Beach, perhaps the most notorious of them all was Mabuhay Gardens. A Filipino restaurant and nightclub that started booking punk bands in 1976, Mabuhay Gardens (AKA the Mab, or the Fab Mab) is now regarded as one of the most important clubs of the punk movement, and played host to every major band in the genre. Black Flag, Blondie, Devo, the Ramones – name virtually any punk band, and they played on this stage at least once.\n\nOnce we’re inside, David runs down some stats for us, and it’s impressive to say the least: The church seats 720 worshippers, and employs five priests and one brother. The steeples rise 191 feet above the square, and the height of the nave is a soaring 60 feet. The church contains 138 stained glass windows, all of which were made here by Italian glaziers brought to San Francisco expressly for that purpose (they also created the glass for the chandeliers). The elaborate altar was wrought from Carrara marble in Italy, and weighs 125 tons; it was brought here on a ship as ballast, and took an entire year to make the trip around Cape Horn, arriving in 1926.\n\nTo take advantage of the tax-free status for places of worship, the top two floors of the structure were built as a parochial school, u-shaped and surrounding the interior of the church below like a horseshoe. The school serves grades pre-K through 8, and currently has 238 students. The kids have to deal with a lot of stairs, but it’s a truly rarefied setting for a school, and the classroom windows command spectacular views of both the city and the Bay below.\n\nAs we mount the age-worn stairs, it feels as if the tour is building to a climax. A quick turn around the school reveals a different world entirely; aside from the fact that it sits atop a 92-year-old church, this is a small primary school like any other. We meet the principal, a personable woman named Lisa Harris (Dr. Harris, as I learn from the school’s website), and I experience a vague wish that I could have gone to school in this lovely, cloistered place.\n\nEmerging into the sunlight on the roof of the church, we are expecting a grandiose view, but are nonetheless gobsmacked. It is a glorious Indian Summer day, and North Beach and the bay beyond stretch away to the horizon. The sky is crisscrossed with the trails of the F-18s roaring overhead, and the city below glitters and beckons in the afternoon light. Correction: I don’t merely want to go to school here, I want to live in this place. I look across to my apartment building a few hundred feet away and think well, at least I got close.\n\nThe Sydney Ducks: California's First Street Gang\n\nOur charming northeastern quadrant of San Francisco has borne more than one name since the first European settlers decided to build on these strange and beautiful hills. Today’s strip clubs on Broadway owe their lusty lineage to the Barbary Coast, which was centered on now-genteel Pacific Street; for a while we went by Little City (or Little Italy, if you were looking at a tourist guide). Of course, these days we like to call ourselves North Beach. Of all the labels this patch of land has worn over the years, however, Sydney-Town was the first.\n\nCentered at the base of Telegraph Hill where Broadway met the waterfront (Battery Street at that time), Sydney-Town was loosely policed by The Sydney Ducks (also called the Sydney Coves), a gang of British laborers and prison escapees who made their way to San Francisco from Australia in the mid-19th century (Ducks, because the marshy waterfront was a magnet for seabirds). A small, lawless enclave, Sydney-Town catered to the fringes of a fringe society. In the anarchic maelstrom that was Gold Rush San Francisco, this neighborhood somehow managed to distinguish itself as the most debauched, vice-ridden locale of them all. A magnet for broken gamblers, drug users, petty thieves and low-level prostitutes, for over a decade Sydney-Town was San Francisco’s dark, wicked center, a repository for all things dissolute and degenerate.\n\nThe streets crawled with ‘crimps,’ or bandits who specialized in drugging and kidnapping men who were then sold into forced labor on ships. Men were “Shanghaied” this way on a daily basis, and it was such a profitable enterprise that some Sydney-Town bars reportedly had trap doors built into their floors for the purpose, and it’s said that some of crimps made up to $10,000 a year in the trade, nearly $300,000 in today’s dollars. It’s difficult to imagine the shock Shanghaied men felt when they awoke in chains on slave ships bound for the Far East. The next time you complain about a hangover, just remember these guys.\n\nDespite the dangers of the neighborhood, business was brisk, and entertainment rife: most venues had no posted closing time, and within a couple of blocks you could drink, gamble, smoke opium or rent the company of a female of nearly any race or age. The truly discerning could also enlist the services of one Dirty Tom McAlear (AKA The Geek). A regular customer at the Goat & Compass, Sydney-Town’s grimiest bar, Tom was filthy and offensive in every way, and possessed of a distressingly marketable skill: for a nickel, Dirty Tom would eat anything–and that means anything–you put in front of him. Ew. The Boar’s Head, another popular “groggery,” took its name from their unusual stage show: a sexual exhibition featuring a woman and a wild boar.\n\nThe first street gang in California history, the Sydney Ducks were criminals of the lowest order, and the undisputed lords of their derelict domain. Resourceful to a fault, they ran what would be called a protection racket today, threatening to burn the businesses of those who refused to pay. Once they had collected all they could, they would wait until the wind was blowing away from the waterfront, then set fire to the city, and proceed to loot the local properties and warehouses. Naturally, the locals always had a wary eye out for the Ducks, and adopted a phrase to use when the gang was on the prowl: “the Sydney Ducks are cackling in the pond.”\n\nWhen one of the Ducks' fires, set on Christmas Eve in 1849, devastated the heart of the city, it prompted the formation of San Francisco’s first Committee of Vigilance. A quasi-legal group of businesspeople and prominent citizens who assembled to make arrests, conduct trials and even execute criminals that seemed beyond the reach of the police and City Hall, the Committee was formed to bring order to a city whose rapid growth had made it nearly ungovernable (in 1851, San Francisco had a police force of only a dozen men, in a city of nearly 25,000).\n\nOnce the vigilantes had set their sites on the Ducks, they were not to be deterred. The committee convened on the 9th of June, 1851, and the very next day ‘tried' and hung John Jenkins, a Sydney native accused of stealing a safe from a local shipping office. James Stuart, also from Sydney, was executed for murder scarcely a month later. All told, four Sydney Ducks were killed by the vigilantes, prompting scores of rattled Aussies to pick up and leave town. After ten years, the Sydney Ducks stranglehold on the neighborhood had been broken–but the lawless character of the neighborhood persisted. The center of the action shifted a block south to Pacific Avenue, and became known as The Barbary Coast.\n\nThe last mention of the Ducks in the historical record is true to their larcenous character: on December 19, 1854, several members of the gang were involved in the famous Jonathan R. Davis fight, in which they attacked Davis, an Army Captain and veteran of the Mexican-American war, and two of his traveling companions. Like their run in San Francisco, it didn’t end well for the Ducks: Captain Davis singlehandedly killed eleven of the attackers, seven with his revolvers and four with his Bowie knife, earning a reputation as one of the most wily gunslingers in California history.\n\nThis article is part of a series examining the fascinating people and places that make up the rich history of North Beach and The Barbary Coast. Visit us again soon for more.\n\nBoontling gained national attention in the mid-1970s when Boonville native and boontling speaker Bobby “Chipmunk” Glover was a regular guest on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show. Unfortunately, because most of the dialect’s native speakers are now elderly, its use has declined sharply in recent years. It is estimated that less than 100 people speak it today.\n\nThe language has an irresistible charm: Boont means Boonville, and in the verb form means to speak boontling. Anyone not from Boont is a brightlighter, and if you look like you’ve got some money, you’re high-pockety. When visiting Boonville, be careful not to drink too much blue grass (whiskey), or you might end up with a case of fiddlers – their cheerful term for delirium tremens. Speaking of such things, eesole is the Boont word for an undesirable character. I’m pretty sure that one’s from the English.\n\nMy personal favorite: one of the most widely used words in the dialect, bahl is the Boont term for good; naturally, the word for a very attractive female is bahlness. Lest you think this betrays a romantic streak in the Boont character, I’ll let you go ahead and look up hog rings and mouse ear for yourself.\n\nSpeaking of which, you'll find a lengthy glossary of Boontling words and phrases at the Wikipedia entry (trust me, it’s more than worth a look).\n\nRemember, Talk Nerdy To Me happens on the first Tuesday of every month at 7:00pm. We've got some terrific stuff lined up, and it's bound to be bahl hornin! (that's Boont for good drinking - better study up). We look forward to seeing you here!

His rate: $100 a week. At one point Mr. Chu inspired a bar, where he was invited to give rambling readings (the 12 Galaxies on Mission Street, somehow closed now). The next time you are down on Market, keep an eye out for the guy in the wraparound sunglasses with the sign full of gibberish – Mr. Chu is still at it today.\n\nA quintessential San Francisco eccentric, Anton LaVey was an author, musician and sometimes circus performer; he was also the founder and High Priest of San Francisco’s Church of Satan. Referred to in the press as “The Black Pope” and “the evilest man in the world,” LaVey founded his Satanic Church in San Francisco in 1966, attracting a coterie of prominent followers. Services were held at “The Black House,” his tiny Victorian home in the Richmond District, which he had painted jet black. A timely combination of sexual libertinism, atheism and a soupçon of show business, LaVey’s Satanism was at its core a rejection of Christianity and its values, and incorporated ideas from Nietzsche, Ayn Rand and others.\n\nDismissed by some as a mere publicity hound, LaVey was apparently quite serious about his church. His Satanic Bible, which Richard Metzger described as \"a razor-sharp, no-bullshit primer in natural and supernatural law,” has sold over a million copies worldwide. He baptized his daughter Zeena at the Black House in 1967, performing the service above the back of a nude woman as an altar – and garnering worldwide attention.\n\nLaVey expired of a heart attack in 1997, just a few days shy of Halloween. His church continues to this day, although it has relocated to – where else? – Hell’s Kitchen in New York City.\n\nPerhaps as unhinged a barrister as the California court system has ever seen, David Terry was a Kentucky-born lawyer who came to California during the Gold Rush. Elected to the State Supreme Court in 1855, Terry had a violent temper, and was known to brandish a huge Bowie knife which he routinely carried in the courtroom. In 1856, the state of California declared San Francisco to be a city in insurrection; Terry was sent by the governor to settle the dispute brewing between the Second Committee of Vigilance and the hopelessly corrupt San Francisco police force. Soon after his arrival in the city, the volatile jurist was involved in an altercation in which he stabbed a protesting vigilante. Some accounts say Terry was kidnapped by the vigilantes and fought back; some claim he stabbed the vigilante in a street fight. In any event, Terry spent a few days in a cell at Fort Gunnybags, contemplating the prospect of being hanged.\n\nThe victim survived, however, and Terry was freed, going on to run for reelection in 1859. Upon his defeat, the judge blamed his loss on California Senator David Broderick (actually a good friend of Terry’s). The bad blood eventually became so extreme between the two men that they agreed to a duel, meeting at a spot just outside San Francisco city limits; Terry outdrew the senator, shooting him dead. Though acquitted of murder, Terry left California, his political career over. He met his own death in 1889 after he attacked US Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field, who had ruled against Terry in his divorce proceedings. The bodyguard who shot him had been hired expressly for the purpose of protecting Field from David Terry.\n\nIn 1850, a decade before the Barbary Coast had taken its name, the south slope of Telegraph Hill was home to what may have been the nastiest, most vice-ridden neighborhood in United States history: Sydney Town. Founded by the Sydney Ducks, a gang of British prison escapees who made their way here from the penal colonies in Australia, Sydney Town was a lawless zone catering to low-level gamblers, con men, whores and opium addicts. Their mascot was a shambling wreck of a man named Dirty Tom Mc Alear, lowliest of the regulars at Sydney Town’s most desperate dive, the Goat & Compass. Filthy, malodorous and perpetually drunk, Dirty Tom (or The Geek, as some knew him) had a singular talent: for just a nickel, he would eat anything you put in front of him. Garbage, small animals, insects, feces - it didn’t matter to Dirty Tom. When you look up the word Omnivore, there truly ought to be a picture of Tom Mc Alear.\n\nArrested in one of the periodic purges of the crime-plagued neighborhood (the charge: making “a beast of himself”), Mc Alear claimed he hadn’t been sober for seven years, nor taken a bath since leaving England some fifteen years earlier. There is no record of Tom’s later life, though we’re guessing it wasn’t pretty. Meanwhile, the Sydney Ducks eventually had their comeuppance; we’ll return to that story in a later post.\n\nThis article is one in a series exploring the fascinating people and places that make up the rich history of North Beach and the Barbary Coast.

The Summer of Love had yet to descend upon our fair city; Kerouac, Ginsberg and the beats had already departed. Something was in the air, an unease deepened by the impending arrival of the Republican National Convention at Cow Palace in July. Before 1964, there had been only one Republican convention on the West Coast, and some took this as a sign that the party was gaining power here. The future of the city was anyone’s bet.\n\nCarol Doda was born on August 29, 1937, in Solano County, California. Her parents divorced when Carol was three, and details of her early life are scarce, but she grew up in Vallejo, supporting herself from the age of 14 as a secretary and cocktail waitress. Arriving in San Francisco in 1963 at the age of 26, Carol began attending the San Francisco Art Institute; to pay her bills, she began working as an exotic dancer at the Condor Club on North Beach’s lively Broadway.\n\nHer stage entrance at the Condor couldn’t have been more dramatic: a white grand piano would slowly descend from the ceiling, and atop would be the lovely, platinum blonde Carol, gyrating like a land-bound mermaid. The music was rock n’ roll, and she liked to dance the Swim, mixing it up with a bit of the Frug and Watusi. She absolutely loved it. “The minute I knew I existed in life was the night I started the Condor thing,” Carol would say later. “The only thing that mattered to me was entertaining people.”\n\nOn the night of June 19, 1964, with the encouragement of the Condor’s publicist, Carol took the stage in a topless “monokini” swimsuit. The act was an astonishing success, and within months every club on Broadway was topless. From there, the trend quickly spread across the country. From the Condor Club on the corner of Broadway and Columbus, Carol Doda had fired the opening salvo of the sexual revolution.\n\nCarol was a very smart young woman, and she knew a good thing when she saw one. As the crowds grew, she quickly moved to capitalize on her success, becoming one of the first entertainers to have her breasts surgically enhanced. She took 44 separate shots of silicone, increasing her bust size from 34B to a bounteous 44D. That’s a massive dose of silicone (the procedure has since been banned), but Carol would never show any ill effects. Her bust was later to be insured by Lloyd’s of London for $1.5 million.\n\nCarol would do 12 shows a night at the Condor, performing for thousands of people a week and earning about $4,000 a week in today’s dollars. On September 3, 1969, she began performing bottomless, sparking another national trend. Carol continued to perform fully nude at the Condor until 1972, when California passed a law prohibiting fully nude dancing in bars.\n\nAlong with the Condor’s owner Gino Del Prete, Carol was arrested in 1965 on obscenity charges, but the two were quickly cleared of any wrongdoing. In 1969, Carol was called as a witness in another trial of two nude dancers arrested in Orangevale, California. Presided over by Judge Earl Warren, Jr (son of former California Governor and U.S Chief Justice Earl Warren), it was a bizarre trial during which the judge moved court proceedings three times. First, to the scene of the alleged crime – the Pink Pussy Kat Bar – where defendant Marie Haines danced for him and the jury wearing nothing but a pair of golden slippers (the jury was made up of 10 men and 2 women, in case you were wondering). Then he took the court to another bistro, where Carol performed her signature act for the same audience (the district attorney opposed asking Carol to perform, but was overruled by a resolute Warren). The judge wrapped up the tour by bringing the jury to view the Swedish erotic film“I Am Curious, Yellow” at a local theater, “to provide context.”\n\nThe dancers were acquitted. After the trial, Judge Warren told reporters “we’d like to salute the American judicial system, which believes in getting all the evidence in.”\n\nAt the height of her fame, Carol was internationally known. She appeared in Bob Rafelson’s 1968 film “Head,” featuring The Monkees, and was reportedly the inspiration for Russ Meyer’s “Mondo Topless.” By 1982 she was again at the Condor performing three shows a night. Carol had started working more on her singing at this point, and for several years in the eighties she fronted local band the Lucky Stiffs, playing clubs around the Bay Area. She retired from stripping in 1985 at the age of 48, and later opened her eponymous lingerie boutique on Union Street in the Marina District.\n\nThough she closed up shop in 2005, Carol never stopped singing, and lots of North Beachers know her from her performances here in the neighborhood at Tupelo, Amante and long-gone Enrico’s, often with bandmate Dick Winn at her side. Carol was a regular presence in North Beach, a walking piece of history, an attachment to our collective past as reassuring as the Moon overhead. As night owls will attest, she was a wee hours irregular across the street at Gino & Carlo, where she was afforded a level of respect normally associated with visiting royalty. If you were lucky enough to talk with Carol at the bar, you were in for a treat. She was quick-witted, kind, funny and sweet. Also, Carol was a very good listener – and that’s a remarkable impression to come away with at 1:30 in the morning.\n\nTeague Kernan remembers her in much the same way. Co-proprietor of Belle Cora (and owner of Tupelo just around the corner), Kernan is a North Beach night owl who over the years has haunted many of the same barrooms as Carol. Over the years he got to know her well, and considered her a friend. “I truly loved her, as a person and an entertainer. She was an icon, but I never saw her that way. She was reserved in a way that I understood,” he said of Carol.\n\nWhen she passed away of kidney failure at 78 in November of last year, Teague and his team at Tupelo hosted a moving, bittersweet memorial. Carol’s final audience, the crowd told one another old stories, looked at stunning photos of Carol through the years, and eventually spilled onto Grant Avenue – just steps away from where Carol had made history 51 years earlier. North Beach had lost its most famous daughter, and America a big piece of its history. Carol Doda was a provocateur, a lady and a true San Francisco original, and we won’t see her equal anytime soon.\n\nAt a performance in 2009, when asked if she would ever give up the stage, Carol was characteristically quick to reply: “The only way I’ll stop performing is when I can’t walk anymore, honey.”\n\nWe’ll all miss you, beautiful.\n\nThis is the third in a series of articles examining the fascinating people and places that make up the rich history of North Beach and The Barbary Coast.\n\nVagabonds, Lunatics and Scoundrels in San Francisco History, Part 1\n\nOne morning in the Spring of 1841, Pennsylvania businessman Paul Geddes was on his way to the bank to deposit $7,000 for his employers. That was a considerable sum in 1841, so he was clearly a trusted employee, but Geddes must have been feeling lucky that day; he decided to stop and play a few hands of poker on the way downtown. In the time it takes a civilized man to have lunch, he managed to lose every dime of the deposit. Unable to face his employers and the authorities, Geddes left town, abandoning his wife and five children.\n\nHeading west, he reinvented himself as Talbot Green, landing in San Francisco after a rugged trek across the Sierras. Here in California he embarked on a second successful career, rising to become U.S. customs collector and serve on the city’s town council. Talbot Green was highly regarded in San Francisco, so much so that he was on the verge of running for mayor when he was recognized at a charity ball by a young woman from his previous life. The ruse unravelled, and his past was exposed by a local muckraker. Though he maintained his innocence, Green was forced to leave town in disgrace, and eventually returned to his family in Pennsylvania. Today, all that’s left of Talbot Green in San Francisco is the street named for him in the 1849 survey: Green Street.\n\nTo be sure, Talbot Green was a world-class scalawag, and he is only one among many in our city’s history. There is no shortage of eccentric, larcenous, and just plain odd characters in San Francisco’s colorful past.\n\nConsider Black Bart. One of the most celebrated bandits in California history, Charles Bowles was a prospector and bank teller who served as a Union sergeant in the Civil War. After a series of financial reversals (including a run-in with Wells Fargo agents that evidently stuck in his craw), Bowles career took a sharp detour. Adopting the nickname “Black Bart,” he began periodically sticking up Wells Fargo stagecoaches in California, reportedly with an unloaded shotgun. History would have likely forgotten Bowles if he hadn’t come up with his sobriquet, along with a gimmick to taunt the hated Wells Fargo: at the scene of at least two of his robberies, he left behind a poem. Signed “Black Bart the PO8,” here’s his first:\n\nI’ve labored long and hard for bread,\n\nFor honor and for riches,\n\nBut on my corns too long you’ve tread,\n\nYou fine-haired sons of bitches.\n\nWell-dressed and unerringly polite, Bowles struck at least 28 times between 1875 and 1883, and made a very good living at his new trade; most evenings he could be found quietly sipping brandy in the corner of Martin and Horton’s Saloon on Montgomery Street. But he eventually paid for his crimes: wounded in the hand during his final robbery, Bowles was later arrested and served seven years in San Quentin. Wells Fargo only pressed charges for the last robbery, and upon Bowles’ release there were rumors that the bank had paid him off to keep him from hijacking their stagecoaches. Wells Fargo denied the charge.\n\nSurrounded by reporters as he exited prison, the bandit was asked if he was going to rob anymore stagecoaches. “No, gentlemen,” he told them, “I’m through with crime.” When then asked if he would write more poetry, he laughed and said, “Now, didn’t you hear me say that I am through with crime?”\n\nAnother regular denizen of Martin and Horton’s was a man known only as “The King of Pain.” A prolific gambler and self-anointed healer, he made an impressive fortune selling cure-all liniment from a stand on Third and Mission Streets. At the height of his success, he traveled in an elaborate black coach drawn by six white horses, and was one of the most ornately dressed men of his time (this in mid-19th century San Francisco). Herbert Asbury describes him in The Barbary Coast: “His customary attire was scarlet underwear, a heavy velour robe, a high hat bedecked with ostrich feathers, and a heavy sword.” Eventually his penchant for the gaming tables caught up with him though, and the man known as The King of Pain lost everything, ending his life as a suicide.\n\nA medical student and Sunday school teacher at the 21st Street Emanuel Baptist Church, Theodore Durrant was the subject of one of California’s most notorious murder trials. Dubbed “the Demon of the Belfry” by the press, Durrant brutally murdered two young women, Blanche Dumont and Minnie Williams, leaving their torn bodies inside the church where he worked. Grisly crimes compared by many to those of Jack the Ripper, the murders created a media sensation on the West Coast. The trial was packed to capacity, many of the spectators women drawn to the spectacle and Durrant’s dark, brooding good looks – an early appearance of ‘murder groupies.’\n\nShortly after his recovery, Goofy was kicked, then thrown violently out of a saloon. It brought on an epiphany; despite the obvious trauma to his body, the performer realized that he felt no physical pain. Oofty Goofty had discovered his true calling. Thereafter he toured the city, inviting people to hurt him in various ways in exchange for money. For as little as a nickel you could kick him, and for fifty cents you could even whack him with a baseball bat (his irresistible pitch: “Hit me with a bat for four bits, gents?”). OG finally called an end to the act after heavyweight boxing champ John L. Sullivan broke a pool cue across his back, causing a spinal injury that made Goofty walk with a limp for the remainder of his life. Indefatigable, he was reportedly back in action only months later, performing as a moving target at an attraction that invited fairgoers to try to hit him with a baseball. Despite his best efforts, Oofty Goofty lived into his sixties.\n\nThis is the second in a series of articles examining the fascinating people and places that make up the rich history of North Beach and The Barbary Coast.

Within a few months, she was earning more than any woman in New Orleans. Soon after starting work at the parlor house, Belle met Charles Cora: a well-known professional gambler and clotheshorse, Cora was immediately taken with Belle, and before long before the two were an item. When news of California’s Gold Rush reached New Orleans, Cora was intrigued, and they soon decamped for San Francisco via steamship.\n\nBy the time Charles and Belle arrived in California at the end of 1849, the Gold Rush was in full swing. They began by touring the boom towns across gold country, and quickly built a fortune plying their respective trades. Pooling their funds, they opened their first venue, the New World gambling parlor, in Marysville in 1850. A grand saloon in which gamblers could choose from poker, roulette, faro or dice, the New World was a success, and they quickly opened another house in Sonora. Flush with the proceeds, in 1852 the two decided to move their business to San Francisco. On November 17, 1852, they opened their third parlor house, on Washington Street in what is now Chinatown. Lavish and opulent, the Cora House had no rival anywhere on the West Coast, and was said to be as fine as any residence in San Francisco. Customers, many of the city’s most prominent citizens among them, were treated like visiting royalty, enjoying the finest champagne and hors d‘oeuvres along with their choice of the city’s most beautiful women. By 1853, Belle was San Francisco’s leading madam, commanding the highest prices in the business and attracting luminaries from across the country. She was also celebrated as the most well-dressed woman in San Francisco; with the dashing Charles at her side, Belle Cora was the picture of success.\n\nBut there was change in the wind. During the height of the Gold Rush, gambling and prostitution were part and parcel of San Francisco business. A survey conducted at the time determined that there were 100 brothels operating just within the eight square blocks bounded by Broadway, Clay, Kearney, and Stockton Streets. But by 1855, gold fever had come and gone. There was a rising tide of moralism in the city, fed by the steady influx from the East Coast. At the beginning of the Rush, there were very few women in San Francisco; truth be told, most of them were prostitutes of one order or another. Their scarcity meant that they were held in high esteem, and spared the stigma that generally comes with the world’s oldest profession. That was changing, however; the first laws against gambling and prostitution had been passed just the year before, and as people continued to flock to San Francisco, there was increasing pressure on city officials to clamp down on vice.\n\nWhen Charles and Belle Cora hosted a gala event at Cora House on the same night as a party thrown by U.S. Marshal William Richardson and his wife, they set off a chain of events that would change the city, and end with the death of both men.\n\nAlerted by her lack of male guests, Mrs. Richardson was outraged that a party thrown at a known house of gambling and prostitution would compete with her event. When the two couples later had the misfortune to be seated in the same balcony at the theater (the most expensive seats in the house), the marshal tried, unsuccessfully, to have the Coras thrown out. Words were exchanged, and Richardson reportedly insulted Belle, igniting a bitter feud between the men. Accounts differ, but two days later, Richardson accosted Cora in front of the Blue Wing Saloon on Montgomery Street, just yards away from where the Transamerica Pyramid stands today. The two men walked toward the waterfront to the corner of Liedesdorff Street, and after a heated exchange Charles Cora shot the marshal in the head with a derringer, killing him.\n\nCora was quickly arrested, and a defiant Belle promptly hired the most expensive attorney in San Francisco to defend him. After a contentious and highly publicized trial ended in a hung jury (Belle allegedly tried to bribe more than one juror), public sentiment seemed to be favoring a lesser charge of manslaughter. Then the other shoe dropped. In retribution for publishing an editorial exposing Casey’s criminal past in New York, City Supervisor James Casey killed popular newspaperman and muckraker James King of William, less than a block from the site of Richardson’s shooting. The second crime was the tipping point for the city’s outrage, and the city’s second Committee of Vigilance was born.\n\n“The harlot who instigated the murder of Richardson [and] others of her kind….are allowed to visit the theaters and seat themselves side by side with the wives and daughters of our citizens.”\n\n–The San Francisco Argus, 1855\n\nAn ad hoc force of armed citizens formed independently of City Hall and the police in response to rampant crime and corruption, the Committee of Vigilance eventually claimed over 6,000 armed members. Like the first committee of its kind, formed in 1851, it proclaimed a three month mandate to rout out crime and corruption in San Francisco, conducting its own trials, arrests and lawsuits. On May 18th, over 2,000 committee men descended on the jailhouse on Broadway, demanding the release of both Cora and Casey for a “people’s trial.” The sheriff refused, but reversed his position when a loaded cannon was pointed at the locked jail doors. The men stood trial by committee; in fairness, they did receive a defense, and got the chance to speak for themselves. In the end, both were convicted and sentenced to hang.\n\nOn May 22nd, the day the sentence was to be carried out, Belle arrived at the committee’s holding cells and convinced the committee leaders to allow her to stay with Charles for what remained of his life. The two were married there, and Belle officially took Charles Cora’s name for the first time – less than two hours before he was to hang. Meanwhile, the committee had summoned a militia of over 3,000 members to secure the execution site at Fort Gunnybags, their headquarters on Sacramento Street just off of Battery. A reported 8,000 spectators lined the streets for blocks in every direction. Casey pled his innocence in a long, anguished speech; Charles Cora remained silent throughout the proceedings. At 1:21 pm, just as the bells were rung for James King of William’s funeral, the two were hung side-by-side from the second story windows of Fort Gunnybags.\n\nIn a way, the execution of Charles Cora marked the true end of the Gold Rush. The days of wide-open, tolerated gambling and prostitution in San Francisco were coming to a close, and the forces of law and order had begun taming the Barbary Coast and the city at large.\n\nAfter her husband’s death, a heartbroken Belle confined herself to the bedroom quarters at Cora House, and wasn’t seen in public for over a month. When she emerged, she had undergone a profound change. She promptly sold Cora House, and began diverting her substantial fortune to charitable causes; one of San Francisco’s earliest female philanthropists, she took a particular interest in children‘s education. Belle Cora died in San Francisco on February 17, 1862. She was 30 years old.\n\nIn 1916, a series of articles on the Coras were published in the San Francisco Bulletin. Following their publication, Belle Cora’s body was disinterred from her grave at Calvary Cemetery in Colma and laid to rest beside her beloved husband Charles at the cemetery at Mission Dolores.

With a playful nod to this city's rich history, Belle Cora boasts a cozy neighborhood restaurant and bar pouring 30+ wines by the glass, 6 beers on tap, and an eclectic list of bottled beer. The kitchen serves seasonal small-plate fare perfect for sharing- whether it's our juicy heirloom tomato burrata or our delicious Belle Burger with homemade house aioli!\n\nThe inside is rich and warm with deep red walls, a cushioned banquet, and brass fixtures that make the Redwood bar-top gleam. Outside, our parklet provides ample seating and heated spaces for those brisk San Francisco nights! Surrounded by a private beer garden, star-jasmine trees and wilting willows, we're a beautiful spot for any date or family gathering!\n\nBelle Cora hosts live music frequently! Our bands typically start at 6PM and end at 9PM. We have music for everyone, so stop in after work, on a date, alone or with friends! We offer a delicious menu from 3PM until 10PM Sunday - Thursday and 1PM until 11PM on Fridays and Saturdays. Tables are first-come first-serve, but we're happy to reserve the banquet area for parties of 10 or more! Check us out on Peerspace for more info!"
