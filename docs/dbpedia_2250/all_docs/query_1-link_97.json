        "text": "- Hey, guys! I couldn't really find a lot of information about you, so let's try to restore the complete history of Wasted Morality. First of all, how did you meet each other? What bands were your favourite at that time?\n\n- We are from the mid 1980s era of San Francisco Bay Area thrash and punk scene. The Original band members mostly met in High School and we also knew each other from the local Sonoma County Music Scene (other bands like, Victims Family, Intense, Final Judgment, Capitalist Casualties, Insanity Puppets, Stone Crow) we all played shows and supported the bigger signed bands, like Testament, Exodus, Metallica, Possessed, DRI, Primus, Faith No Moore, Death Angel, etc.\n\nWe drew from the influence of bands listed above that we gigged with and we also drew influence from punk bands like GBH, DK, JFA, TSOL, MDC, Black Flag, Broken Bones, the Exploited, and as young teens, we drew from Sabbath, Zeppelin, Rush, Motorhead, Priest, Saxon, Venom and also much later towards the end of the bands 80s run we actually recorded some Mr Bungle and RHCP influenced material, which was our undoing and as we expanded our intentions we lost some hardcore fan base\n\n- How did you come up with the idea of creating a band? How old were you? What was your first rehearsal place like?\n\n- All of us always had been in bands and were all talented in regards to music lessons, had instruments and connections in the local music scene, We all dreamed of being in bands since we were kids.\n\nOur first studio was a basement that was turned into 4 different little rooms and each band hand a \"studio\". They were very small and hot and there was no room to move.\n\n- Who came up with the band's name? What was the background for such a title, Wasted Morality? Did you consider any other versions?\n\n- Our guitarist / manager Ben Hardman Harding stole it from a local Fanzy Magazine named Metallic Thrash, by \"wasted morality productions\" and eventually we asked them kids that were running the fanzy magazine if we could use the name and they kindly said yes. Thanks Andy Ford!\n\nthe back ground for the bands name was just that wasted morality kinda meaning discontent with government and war and taxes and cost of living and possible nuclear war shit, nope we never considered any other \"versions\"\n\n- Let's talk a bit about your demo, \"Stitches\", released in 1987. The sound quality is pretty good, where did you record it? Who was the producer? Was it your first-time experience working in the studio?\n\n- Banquet Studios in Santa Rosa, Ca. Davy Vain and Rebel Productions Produced it. We had all been in studios, but this was our first time together in this band\n\n- The tape was released with your own efforts. Originally, how many copies did you prepare? Where did you print the covers?\n\n- Yes we did it internally on our own \"label\" 500 copies all cassette at the time. Not sure about the printing Billy D Management handled it and he has since passed, then Gina Pili was our manager and she handled the media arm of the WM\n\n- Who did the cover design? Especially that logo you had, some creepy screaming head, who was the artist?\n\n- Clay Butler who sang for abnormal growth..billy haws old singer.\n\n- How did you distribute your cassettes? Did you receive any attention from local or any other magazines? What was the general feedback on you?\n\n- We sold the tapes at shows, parties and through the mail. Yes there are a couple dozen stories in magazines, papers and online. We had generally great feedback up until about 1989 when we took a wrong turn down the thrash funk punk road. Yet that road ended and Larry Broderick left the band. Wasted continued on with a few singers, but eventually broke up early 1990s. And all founding members joined other projects.\n\n- What was your concert life like? Did you play live a lot? Do you have a couple of gigs that you still keep the memories of?\n\n- All shows were good shows, whether arenas, clubs, bars, theaters or garages. We played 3 or 3 shows a month. Best gigs? opening for bands like, GWAR, DRI, Victims Family, Death Angel, Suicidal Tendencies\n\n- Besides that demo, before your split-up, did you have any other records? If yes, could you tell us about it?\n\n- We have a few things here, 1st is the Stiches Demo which you have spoken of, Then in 1989 we cut the Stell's house Demo, then a few live tapes surfaced as well. Later in 2007 we released \"the worst hits\" CD. We are now working on a 30 year \"stiches\" edition with new and old material\n\n- So, in 1990 the morality was completely wasted and the band split-up. What was happening within the band and what was the reason for such a decision for you?\n\n- Changes in the scene, pay to play policy, lack of clubs, and the sheer fact that fucking grunge killed heavy metal, thrash metal and death metal. Come 1990 everything was Nirvana, Stone temple pilots and Sound garden. fuck all that rock crap. also we had jumped on the funk band wagon, with bands like Psycofunkapuss, Smoking rhythm prawns, Fungo mungo which were opening for bands like Primus, RHCP and Mr Bungle.... yet the Funk died off too as Grunge dominated the early and mid nineties... don't get us wrong Metal and Thrash was alive, it just had fragmented into so many sub genres and was just not as big as it was in the 1980s\n\n- What you guys have been up to after it? Did you continue playing the music or did you simply start the normal lives?\n\n- Mike Pauline on Bass, went on to The Heat Creeps and Seeds of Hate, Larry Broderick went on to an industrial band call the Bleeding Stone, Andrew Rosa played with a lot of bands and is playing in a country band drawing big crowds, Ben Harding is still playing and recording mostly as a studio session guitarist."
