Whether you’re a tourist wanting to see the sights or a local looking for new ideas, we’re sure these recommendations will help point you in the right direction. How many have you tried?\n\nOf course, we have a few other lists that could help expand on this one. Be sure to check out our list of free things to do, things to do on a rainy day, things to do alone, things to do with kids, and things to do this weekend in San Francisco, just to name a few.\n\n1. Cross the Golden Gate Bridge\n\nSan Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge receives over 10 million visits a year and is one of the world’s most recognizable landmarks. The 1.7-mile-long suspension bridge was built in 1937 and has remained a symbol of world-class engineering and local pride ever since. Many visitors like to bike across the bridge to Sausalito, and then take a ferry back. You could also sail underneath the bridge on a scenic boat ride.\n\n2. Have an unforgettable time at Outside Lands\n\nOutside Lands is the country’s largest independently-owned music festival, taking place every year in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park.

Greet the sea lions at Fisherman’s Wharf\n\nThe SF waterfront is a fun and lively place to visit, albeit a little touristy. You could see the sights at Pier 39, strike a pose at Umbrella Alley, visit sea creatures at Aquarium of the Bay, and play vintage arcade games at Musée Mécanique. Don’t forget to tour the historic boats at Hyde Street Pier for a fun trip back in time. You can also set sail on a boat cruise for a memorable day on the water.\n\n6. Stuff your face at Tony’s Pizza Napoletana\n\nThis San Francisco staple is one of the city’s most famous pizza places, helmed by 13-time World Pizza Champion Tony Gemignani. Order from dozens of pizzas ranging from Sicilian to classic American to coal-fired. Take a culinary tour around the Italian neighborhood of North Beach while you’re at it.\n\n7. Walk through the Eliasson tunnel at SFMOMA\n\nSFMOMA (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) is easily one of SF’s most famous museums with a frequent rotation of large- and small-scale art exhibitions from both local and international artists. One of the most-photographed is Olafur Eliasson’s One-Way Colour Tunnel, which feels like stepping into a kaleidoscope. The museum grants free admission to Bay Area residents on the first Thursday of every month from 1-8pm.\n\n8. Catch a free concert at Stern Grove Festival\n\nStern Grove Festival has hosted free summer concerts for 87 years, making it the oldest outdoor music festival in the Bay Area.

You can bet on the series recurring on Sundays between June and August.\n\n🗓️ Dates: Sundays June 23-Aug 18, 2024\n\n9. Explore the CA Academy of Sciences’ indoor rainforest\n\nWith some of the most advanced research facilities in the world, this famous SF museum is capable of putting together some seriously fascinating and creative exhibits including a four-story indoor rainforest aflutter with free-flying birds and butterflies. You’ll want to spare about half a day to catch a show at the state-of-the-art planetarium, step onto the massive living roof, and visit the comprehensive natural history museum.\n\n10. Attend a free outdoor movie screening courtesy of Sundown Cinema\n\nSundown Cinema presents an exciting lineup of free movie screenings in local parks every summer and fall. There are four movies left on the schedule for this year, happening through October.

With over 50 food vendors and 6 stages, this is a real treat that’s totally iconic to the city.

Catch the view from the de Young Museum’s observation deck\n\nThe de Young Museum has been one of SF’s most iconic fine art museums since it was founded in 1895.

Bay Area residents can enjoy free admission every Saturday, and the general public can get in for free on the first Tuesday of every month.\n\n13. Have a bonfire at Ocean Beach\n\nThis stunning beach along the west coast of the city is perfect for bonfires (March through October) or for windy sunset beach walks along the coast. Look for the historic Cliff House and Camera Obscura up on the bluffs. Be advised that beaches in San Francisco are unsafe for swimming due to powerful sneaker waves and rip currents.\n\n14. Take a tour of Alcatraz\n\nAlcatraz Island is an essential part of San Francisco’s history, most famously serving as a federal prison from 1934-1963 housing the likes of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly. It was later the site of a Native American civil rights movement before becoming part of the Golden Gate Recreation Area in 1972. The audio tour is one of the best things to do in San Francisco for tourists, but even locals will have plenty to learn on a visit to this historic island.\n\n15. Ride a cable car\n\nSF’s cable cars are the only moving national landmark in the United States, dating back to 1873. There are 2 types of historic cable cars in service in San Francisco today: 12 California cars, which are larger and may be operated from both ends; and 28 Powell cars, which are slightly smaller and operational from one end only. You can learn more about the cable cars at SF’s free Cable Car Museum.\n\n16. Sip on an Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista\n\nBuena Vista Cafe is credited as the first and arguably the most famous place to serve Irish Coffee in the US starting back in 1952. The famous cafe serves up to 2,000 Irish Coffees per day in an elegant performance, using freshly-brewed coffee, sugar, and Tullamore D.E.W. Irish whiskey topped with freshly whipped cream. If you’re spending time in the Fisherman’s Wharf neighborhood it’s a non-negotiable stop.\n\n17. Discover the Palace of Fine Arts\n\nThe Palace of Fine Arts was built as a temporary exhibition space for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. When the fair ended, prominent philanthropist Phoebe Hearst helped to preserve the beloved Palace structure and saved it from demolition. The structure is designed to depict a decaying Roman ruin, featuring a 162-tall rotunda and large colonnades. Many visitors to the Palace enjoy taking a picnic to eat on the grass surrounding the lagoon.\n\n18. Drink tea and enjoy the view in the Japanese Tea Garden\n\nThe Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park is the oldest public Japanese garden in the United States, dating back to 1894 when it debuted as a “Japanese Village” at the California Midwinter International Exposition. Visitors can enjoy a relaxing cup of tea and Japanese refreshments in the tea house, or visit during March and April to catch the cherry blossoms. The five-tiered wooden pagoda recently underwent a $2M renovation and the garden is looking better than ever.\n\n19. Attend a candlelight concert in a stunning SF venue\n\nCandlelight is present in over 100 major cities worldwide, and we’re lucky to enjoy these captivating classical concerts at the magnificent International Art Museum of America and St. Ignatius Church in San Francisco.

Take a lap around the Ferry Building\n\nSF’s Ferry Building is a center for events, pop-ups, a farmers’ market, and countless excellent merchants who sell their wares daily in the building’s many stalls. Their expansive outdoor dining area has excellent views of the Bay and it’s a fun spot for grab-and-go food. This is also one of the more famous historic buildings in San Francisco, as it was built in 1898 and survived both the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes with minimal damage.\n\n26. Drive down Lombard Street\n\nThis famous red-brick street in Russian Hill attracts 2 million tourists per year. The iconic street features 8 sharp turns in a 1-block stretch, surrounded by lush landscaping and always teeming with cars and foot traffic. You can take the Powell/Hyde cable cr to the top of Lombard, but don’t forget to see one of the city’s best views a block away at Hyde and Chestnut.\n\n27. Visit the Painted Ladies at Alamo Square\n\nThis line of Queen Anne Victorian homes is one of the city’s most iconic landmarks. The houses were built between 1892 and 1896 and have been featured in movies such as Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) and television shows like Full House (1987-1995). You’ll find that the homes are perfectly placed against a dramatic backdrop of the San Francisco skyline, and “postcard row” is now one of the most-photographed views in SF.\n\n28.

Snag a frangipane croissant at Tartine\n\nTartine has been a San Francisco staple forever! They’re well-known for their excellent breads, but the pastries themselves receive the same amount of careful attention.
