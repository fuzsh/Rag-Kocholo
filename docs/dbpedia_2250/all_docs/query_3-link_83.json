        "text": "Show No Mercy: California Nightmare\n\nby\n\nWhat’s the best way to characterize a group of bands, venues, places, and people that lie several thousand miles away from your base of operations? Go directly to the source, and let them tell you their stories. I’ve spent plenty of time in the Bay Area thanks to friends and touring, and I'm familiar with what’s going on in that vibrant metal/punk community, but it takes a real lifer-- or longtime transplant-- to get to the heart of the mystique enshrouding San Francisco’s best-kept secrets.\n\nTo do so, I spoke with a wide range of native musicians, promoters, labels, record stores, and music lovers about their experiences in the long-running California nightmare that’s been dominating American metal for decades. From VON and Weakling to Metallica, from Noothgrush to Ghoul and Death Angel to Scolex, the cult is very much alive in the city by the Bay and its influence has spread far beyond its borders.\n\nHistorically, it’s impossible to overstate the impact Metallica and their immediate successors had on the Bay Area’s musical psyche, even if many of our interview subjects had already outgrown the Black Album by the time they first picked up a guitar or bought a record player. The shadow of the Big Four (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax) has eclipsed so many other bands for too long, and as far as many of today's local bands are concerned, the evolution of the Bay’s metal scene hinged as much upon those four horsemen as it did Neurosis or Autopsy. But, of course, it’s not all high tops and skateboards, either, no matter what the legions of \"retro thrash\" bands would have you believe.\n\nNo scene can survive without its meeting places and artifacts. San Francisco lays claim to some of underground music’s most forward-thinking labels, as well as a handful of record stores like Aquarius, Amoeba, and Rasputin's stocked sky-high with black gold. Some of the most important metal/punk zines, including punk rock bible Maximum Rock'n'Roll, and heavy music venues like 924 Gilman are also rooted in the Bay. Their influence still bleeds into the current sounds of the city, from the hellish racket of Nuclear War Now! Productions to Slap-A-Ham’s powerviolence legacy. But gentrification, changing attitudes, and mutating genres have shifted the center: The slow exodus from San Francisco proper continues to bubble over into Oakland, Berkley, and the rest of the Bay, and a steady stream of heshers, punks, hippies, and crusties have staked their claim, chased out by the astronomical cost of living in the thick of things.\n\nThere’s a reason so many creative people flock to the Bay and make their homes among the grime and glitter. The place crackles with electricity, and by the sounds of it, is the perfect spot to forge friendships, soak in killer tunes, and make a few memories. While the Bay remains steeped in history and seminal recordings, it’s bursting with new talent and fresh ideas. Diversity is the name of the game, and now more than ever, its practitioners are reaping that which they have sown.\n\nThe Bands\n\nChris Brock (Early Graves): My favorite thing about the Bay Area scene is how diverse it is. There are shows where punk, doom, hardcore, crust, grind, and black metal bands all co-exist, and everyone is stoked to hang around and drink beer. What keeps it alive is people's ability to appreciate a little of everything, and there aren't a whole lot of bullshit attitudes going around.\n\nJohn Gossard (Dispirit, White Phosphorus, Weakling, Asunder, The Gault, Vomitorium): There are a few different scenes going on here, it is not all one unified thing.\n\nSean Mcgrath (Ghoul, Impaled, live/ex-member of Engorged, Stormcrow, Exhumed, Scolex, Dispirit): There are so many good bands from the Bay Area that it's hard to think of them all. A few good recent bands are Scolex, who have an early 90s Scandinavian sound; Cyanic, who have very intense, very brief songs that mix technical death metal with very violent sounding black metal; Femacoffin, a killer crust band with former members of Stormcrow; Lecherous Gaze, who are more on the rock end of things with a sound that is reminiscent of Black Oak Arkansas and your Molly Hatchets; and, of course, Dispirit, a truly harsh black metal band who single-handedly keep the smoke machine industry afloat. That's indicative of how varied the bands here are, though a lot of times they play on the same bills.\n\nJohn Gossard: A few current bands I like a lot: Fabricant (extremely technical but strange death metal a bit like Demilich/Timeghoul), Black Fucking Cancer (raw violent black metal ex-Necrite), Odz Manouk (relocated to L.A. but started here and is one of the best US black metal projects going), Worm Ouroboros (Not really metal, but pretty doomy), Mortuous (old school death metal) Scolex (osdm), Necrot (osdm), Hollow Mirrors (psych prog folk with Sam from Weakling), The Witching Hour (simple keyboard heavy raw black metal). There are a couple of atmospheric black metal bands from Santa Cruz Lluvia (formerly The Rain in Endless Fall) and Gloam, some good Oakland punk/metal/d-beat/grind/doom: Negative Standards, Caffa , Kicker (old school anarcho punk a bit like Subhumans), Lycus (funeral doom), Mastery (black metal) Laudanum (sludge/funeral/Godfleshy doom, now with Salvador from Asunder).\n\nSonny Reinhardt (Saviours, Necrot, sound engineer): Bands to look out for here are Scolex, Rude, Necrot, No Statik, Laudanum, Right, Lecherous Gaze, Hazzard's Cure, Owl, Noothgrush, Wild Eyes, Lycus, Badr Vogu, Hollow Mirrors, Apocryphon, Fema Coffin, Replica, Power, Secrets of the Sky, Pyschosomatic, Dispirit, Fabricant, Kicker, Caffa, Swamp Witch, DHC, Cyanic, Satya Sena, Serpent Crown, Your Enemy, Abrupt, Larvae, Connoisseur, Brainoil, Ghoul, Negative Standards, Permanent Ruin, Conquest for Death, and so many more.\n\nJohn Gossard: I don't think any underground local extreme metal or punk bands I pay attention to nowadays are anywhere close to as big as the old bands were. [Even contemporary] Metallica, Exodus, and Testament do much better than the new blood. The Possessed reunion seems to be a lot bigger than they ever were back in the day, too. Neurosis is also still doing well, and again not a new band. Sleep's reunion is huge as well. High on Fire is another. Still, I don't think any of this is as big as Metallica when Ride the Lightning was first released.\n\nSean McGrath: When I first got involved [in the late 90s], metal was really at a low point in the Bay Area-- it would be impossible for me to overstate this fact-- in terms of popularity, but also in terms of number and quality of the bands, so the gap between a band like Machine Head and a band on the next rung or two down the ladder, like Exhumed, was enormous. Exhumed was one of the only bands I knew who had a record deal with a label that had records in chain stores. All the thrash bands had broken up or turned into funk metal bands and then broken up, and there was almost no interest in death metal or black metal for years. That slowly started to turn around when John Cobbett started promoting a weekly metal and punk night called Lucifer's Hammer at a club in San Francisco called the CW Saloon. Oddly, another Country and Western bar that like its famous cousin in New York ended up being better known for underground music. I guess it was a dark time to local Country and Western here, too.\n\nJohn Gossard: [In the late 90s] John Cobbett got a club to start allowing him to book metal nights on Tuesdays. A bunch of people were regulars there and the shows were not only one genre, so a lot of the same people were hanging out watching Weakling one week and Slough Feg the next. Impaled, Ludicra, Hammers of Misfortune, the Gault, Amber Asylum, Noothgrush, Morbodisad, Dekapitator, Exhumed, Brainoil, Asunder, Dead and Gone, Black Goat, and tons more as well as tours like the first Bay Area shows with Mayhem, Enslaved, Burning Witch, Warhorse, Immolation, Impaled Nazarene. That spot introduced a lot of people who ended up working together.\n\nOddly, at the same time, if I went across town to the venue that got bigger death metal tours like Morbid Angel, Deicide, Vader, or old thrash like Rigor Mortis, Metal Church, Destrutcion, Kreator, the Lucifer’s Hammer crowd mostly was not present and a ran into a lot more people from outside of San Francisco at those shows. So there were then (and still are) more than one metal scene going on that does not really hang out with the other.\n\nSonny Reinhardt: There are spots [to see shows] popping up here and there all the time. Some last and some burn bright only for a short time.\n\nJames R. (Swamp Witch, Caffa, promoter, filmmaker): Gilman is and will always be one of the best places to play an all ages show in the Bay Area, but they've fallen onto a lot of bad luck financially. Every year their rent is raised and it's harder for them to keep their doors open. If you are reading this and are in a big band or just have a bunch of money that could help them out financially, please do so!\n\nGregg Deadface (Your Enemy, xHostagex, ex-Blessing the Hogs, Deathroll, Thousands): 924 Gilman St will always hold a place in most people’s hearts, but it seems like all of us Oakland bands just stay within the community. Also, Gilman has so many inner politics and whatnot, that it has turned a lot of us away, and we have just created our own world. Some of these venues are totally DIY, so I can’t go into detail [about] their addresses. Ask a punk!\n\nSean McGrath: The Oakland Metro, Gilman, Thee Parkside, The Elbo Room, El Rio, and DNA Lounge are all great, as far as legit clubs. Then there are the places like Burnt Ramen, Ptomaine Temple, the Swamp, Church of the Buzzard, and the now defunct Hazmat, Slaughterhouse, and others that are/were indispensable in the cultivation of the underground scene here.\n\nThe Darkness\n\nChris Brock: At the time [in the late 90s/early 2000s], hardcore, punk and metal were all the same to me. Metal was almost a bad word at the time. It certainly was not “cool” to dress in all black (or camo) and wear long sleeve shirts. People thought you were one of those Marilyn Manson/Tool guys which still sucks. Some of the bands I can recall really having an affect on me from the area, metal or not, were Sworn Vengeance, a hardcore band that were one of the first in the area at least to mix in some of the Swedish death metal stuff going on. I also loved some of the thrash shit like Vio-lence and Machine Head. When I heard The More Things Change and Burn My Eyes, as well as Eternal Nightmare, it was church, man. I didn’t know of them when they were around, but Asunder and Von are two examples of extraordinary heavy bands from the area, as are Noothgrush and Dystopia. When I got my hands on Neurosis thanks to seeing Phil Anselmo wear their shirts all the time, that’s when shit really started to change for me and recognizing that the Bay Area really has a dark sound coming out of it. It wasn’t such as party as it was in years past.\n\nChiyo Nukaga: These days, the Bay Area is becoming darker. Perhaps the shift just came naturally with all the hype on tone and amp worship? It seems like ambience and dark art has a lot of influence, too.\n\nSonny Reinhardt: At some point the music just became a lot darker and angrier. I think people here really wanted to push the boundaries of what was considered heavy and started taking the music more seriously. Bands like Asunder, Skaven, Stormcrow, and Laudanum, were embracing more of a darker, doom metal and crust sound. I think it was very influential for a lot of people to want to head in that direction here.\n\nJohn Gossard: There are a lot of bands playing doom these days, and more black and death metal bands as well, but we also have had a ton of retro-thrash bands recently which I don't find dark at all.\n\nLooking back to the 80's the biggest bands were not that dark really, but we also had things like Flipper, Possessed, Autopsy, Sadus, VON, Neurosis, Sacrilege BC (the first album anyway), and tons of lesser known demo bands that fell by the wayside. When Weakling first began, the initial version when it was me and the guys from Black Goat, there were really only a tiny handful of people who had heard of black metal around here. People I knew into death metal at the time mostly hated it, and there were a few crust punks I knew who liked it, other than that it was mostly unknown. Then even when the later lineup began playing live it was mostly unknown but the dramas of the Norwegian scene had started to become known to commoners, so there was a bit of outside curiosity about it.\n\nJonathan Tuite (The Flenser label manager): I think there was a bit of a backlash against the thrash thing in the later 90s. It was 10-12 years ago, which is also when things really started to get darker. A lot of people started focusing more on heavier music, and around that time a lot of us started listening to European black metal. Folks that I would see at punk shows started playing in metal bands. For instance, Aesop from Ludicra use to play in the punk band Hickey. Having really great record stores like Amoeba and Aquarius made it possible to get hard-to-find black metal and was responsible for the release and distribution of bands cassette demos and CDrs. Aquarius Records in-house label Tumult released records by Leviathan, Crebain, Hammers of Misfortune, as well as the Weakling album.\n\nThe Labels\n\nSean McGrath: Good old Tankcrimes Records is my personal favorite [label]. Life Is Abuse is another one that puts out a ton of great records. There was also Necropolis Records out of Fremont, who at one time was the biggest American black metal label, period.\n\nAthena Kautsch (Six Weeks Records label manager, Short, Fast, Loud editor, Voetsek): As far as starting a label goes, Jeff (my husband) and I toured together in 1992. Capitalist Casualties, his band, and my punk band at the time, The Dread, did a six-week U.S. tour. We were inspired by all of the great bands and people we met and decided to start a label. I think the most important Bay Area label for extreme music was Slap A Ham, hands down. They were the label that introduced many to powerviolence and bands like No Comment, Crossed Out, Capitalist Casualties, Man is the Bastard, Infest, Lack of Interest, etc. Six Weeks, 625 Thrashcore, and Prank all were influenced by Slap A Ham.\n\nJonathan Tuite: Aquarius and Amoeba were very important to building the scene. Aquarius's weekly newsletter was a huge influence on me and on loud music in general. Now there is Nuclear War Now! in the East Bay which is the largest underground label around. Ipecac is around here somewhere and Neurot and 20 Buck Spin both have roots in the area. Aside from the price of real-estate, the Bay Area is good place for a label.\n\nThe Future of the Scene\n\nJohn Gossard: San Francisco is dominated by corporate interests, gentrification, and attracting international visitors. All of this leads to pushing out venues that cater to grittier art/music, make rent unaffordable both in housing and rehearsal spaces. Oakland is a strange place because it has wealthy communities and completely desolate wasteland areas. There are some areas that get gentrified, but many others that are considered a lost cause, so between all this you have some people with cash, some people with no cash willing to live in cheap but sketchy neighborhoods because it’s cheap, and others living in those neighborhoods because it is the only option in this shitty economy.\n\nGregg Deadface: The Bay Area/Oakland scene to me, especially in Oakland, seems to be a scene that supports its community as opposed to destroying it. I have been witness to a lot of different types of music scenes over the years, and the downfall of them all is usually a lot of infighting amongst bands and the lack of venue/support from the community. That is definitely one thing San Francisco’s is lacking compared to Oakland-- Oakland’s DIY community shows strong support for itself and its artists.\n\nJames R.: People realized they don't have to pay more money to live in a superficial town that hardly embraces a DIY lifestyle. The San Francisco scene is built around bar shows, which means you are there to entertain rich drunk people, whereas in Oakland, you play a DIY house/basement/warehouse and people go to shows to enjoy the show and have a good time. Music is always first.\n\nLaurie Sue Shanaman (ex-Ludicra): I live for the nights when I can catch a great metal show in Oakland. There are still a few good spots in SF, but it’s not the same.\n\nJohn Gossard: I remember seeing Pete from Neurosis bite a chunk of a skinheads ear off at a Skaven (pre-Asunder) show. Having a 14 year old kid smoke me and my friend out at a show in high school only to find out it was laced with what was probably PCP, then watching Blind Illusion play the most amazing shit I ever heard. Seeing Mercyful Fate on The Oath tour. Slayer opening for Laaz Rockit in Berkeley. Opening for Mayhem at their first Bay Area show and having them play at half our volume because they needed the amps quiet enough to hear the triggered drums thought the shitty underpowered PA. Then while being underwhelmed by the sound, seeing the guy next to me get knocked out by pig's head thrown from the stage.\n\nLaurie Sue Shanaman: Many of us in the Bay Area metal scene are getting older. I’m 43. But this has never seemed to stop anyone from enjoying what we love the most-- whether we’re in bands or not, we have a great community of people, and it crosses over between San Francisco and Oakland rather than having any silly rivalry. Although, the Eagle, a mostly gay bar, just reopened in SF. I recently saw Slough Feg there and it really made me happy; it felt encouraging to be in SF for the first time in a long time."
