        "text": "Arching over the Golden Gate Strait, which connects the Pacific Ocean to the San Francisco Bay, the defining landmark of the city links San Francisco to Marin and Sausalito. At just under two miles, it's walkable by foot but also easy to see by car. It's hard to understand the magnitude or beauty of the bridge until you cross it. Stop outside the Welcome Center at the statue of Joseph Strauss, the bridge's designer, and look for the plaques explaining the bridge’s history and, of course, grab the obligatory snapshot. For more insights of the bridge’s backstory, sign up for a free walking tour of the bridge with San Francisco City Guides.\n\nEdible Excursions is run by a team of expert guides obsessed with San Francisco, food, and showing off Japantown. Small groups walk and nibble, sip and savor, for around two hours while hearing stories about the neighborhood and meeting family-run business owners. This is a neighborhood where you can't be afraid to step through doors because behind them teems friendly people, delicious foods, and a community passionate about their heritage and culture. At first, Japantown appears quiet, but once inside a restaurant, a grocery store, or even a mall, your perception changes. For curious visitors and backyard travelers who want to learn more about San Francisco’s Japantown, its history, and its food, and for anyone who loves trying dishes they might not make or find at home, this is a can't-miss.\n\nThe towering trees of Muir Woods National Monument might be known as Sequoia sempervirens to botanists and naturalists, but to travelers like us, they are California coastal redwoods and are some of the tallest and oldest trees on earth. This 558-acre preserve was named after conservationist John Muir and proclaimed a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908. It is home to one of the last remaining ancient redwood forests in the Bay Area. Every step you take here is a do-not-miss wonder. There are around six miles of trails within the park, that wind among the mammoth trees to areas such as Cathedral Grove and Bohemian Grove, and along Redwood Creek. More experienced hikers can extend their treks to the adjacent Mount Tamalpais State Park.\n\nSFMOMA stands out among other elite museums in the city for its innovative, exciting exhibits in a cutting-edge building. Located by a BART station and right off MUNI bus lines, it's accessible in a busy downtown location. Architecture firm Snøhetta spearheaded an innovative expansion, which includes a two-story-high and half-block-long \"living wall\" covered in native plants, as well as fiberglass-reinforced panels on the exterior that evoke the waters of the Bay. The collection is full of heavy hitters and the Museum Store is packed with wonders, ranging from Lichtenstein-inspired vases to glowing book-shaped lamps, delicate silver necklaces to a chess set with San Francisco landmarks for pieces. Spending an entire day here is certainly not out of the question.\n\nThe Legion of Honor museum is not only one of San Francisco's best, but one of its most beautiful buildings, built as a replica of Paris' Legion d'Honneur. It's home to more than 800 European paintings, including works from Picasso, Monet, and Rembrandt, as well as more than 90 sculptures by Rodin, most notably The Thinker. Save some time for a walk along the grounds, for breathtaking views of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nHorses and carriages long had trouble conquering San Francisco's steep hills, and so in 1873 the cable car system was born—three lines of the original eight remain today. They are a symbol of San Francisco, the world's last manually operated cable car system, and one of the city’s most popular attractions. An estimated 9.7 million people hop aboard each year–the vast majority are tourists, but some residents still use these moving monuments to crisscross the city, just as was intended more than 150 years ago. Riding is a blend of an open-air bus and a slow-moving roller coaster. When you board, you'll either sit on the wooden benches for a more comfortable ride, or seek thrills and stand on the car's exterior, gripping the poles as the car moves up and down the steep streets of San Francisco.\n\nYou know the well-worn piece of advice, not to spend too long in California, or it’ll ruin you? This hike will ruin you. Snaking along the rocky clifftops at the city’s wild edge, the Coastal Trail at Lands End follows the Golden Gate Strait out to the Pacific Ocean, delivering jaw-dropping views along the way. The 1.7-mile path wends around corners and over hills, through wide-open spaces and cathedral-like groves of trees, tracing the path of a long-gone railway that once ferried pleasure seekers to Sutro Baths and Ocean Beach. You’ll get there, too, but don’t hurry—this is a hike to be savored.\n\nAn impressive science and natural history museum in Golden Gate Park, the museum was completely rebuilt in 2008, and the new Renzo Piano-designed building features unique architectural elements like a rooftop covered in native plant life. The \"living exhibits\" are probably the highlights. There is a rainforest populated by plants, frogs, and free-flying birds and butterflies, with a flooded rainforest tunnel filled with Amazonian fish. Other live animal exhibits include a recreated swamp, where you can peer down at Claude, the resident albino alligator with ruby-red eyes, plus a colony of playful African penguins who share a tank with pyjama sharks and sea stars, where they swim and do flips. There's also the Steinhart Aquarium, with jellyfish and a living coral reef. The less “live” exhibits include Shake House, an immersive exhibit that allows visitors to (safely) experience the kinds of tremors that shook the Bay Area during the city’s two biggest quakes—the Loma Prieta Earthquake and the Great Earthquake of 1906.\n\nThese Instagram-worthy ruins overlooking the Pacific draw hikers and visitors during the day, especially at sunset, when the views are unforgettable. They are all that remains from a complex opened by Mayor Adolph Sutro in 1896, that burned down 70 years later. The spooky beauty makes this place stand out in a city with many outdoor spaces. Where else in San Francisco can you find sprawling ruins on the edge of the sea? It's practically like something out of the ancient world.\n\nSan Francisco’s Chinatown looms large in our collective imagination, and rightly so. Born during the California Gold Rush years, the neighborhood dates back further than any other Chinese community in North America. With 30 square blocks to explore, it’s also the largest neighborhood of its kind outside Asia. Explore Chinatown’s nooks and crannies on foot and you’ll find something new and wondrous beneath the swaying red lanterns and neon signs. Down one side alley sits Tin How Temple, a quiet, incense-filled space where locals gather to pray; down another sits Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, a small shop where workers rapid-fold fortune cookies beneath a soundtrack of whirring machinery. You’ll see a real cross-section of humanity here—families eating dim sum, older Chinese men and women playing mahjong in Portsmouth Square, dressed-up foodies making a night of it at Michelin-star Mister Jiu’s, gorgeous Empress by Boon, or the exclusive Eight Tables, and tourists hunting for souvenirs (prices are cheaper here than in Union Square and Pier 39).\n\nYou may know it by its real name or you may know it as “The Rock” (thanks Nic Cage!). It is the prison that was open as a federal penitentiary for 29 years and, at one point, housed gangster Al Capone. It became notorious for failed escape attempts—the island is just 1.25 miles offshore and, lured by the glittering lights of the city, 34 prisoners tried their hand at swimming through the frigid, choppy waters to freedom. Today, you can take a 12-minute ferry ride out to the island and take in the infamous prison up close. Audio tours guide visitors through the main cell block, laundry facility, and chow house. Don’t miss the ruins of the 15-room Warden’s mansion, where lavish parties were held. It was burned to the ground during the 19-month-long occupation of Alcatraz Island by Native American activists in 1970. Outdoor spaces to see are Eagle Plaza, the Recreation Yard, and the island’s colorful gardens, maintained by volunteer gardeners of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.\n\nThe Ferry Building becomes San Francisco’s prime food destination during the Saturday Ferry Plaza farmers’ market, which brings more than 80 farmers and purveyors to the plaza surrounding the building, selling everything from rare citrus to small-batch miso to California olive oil. There's much to eat at other times, too, any time of day. Start your day with organic bagels at Daily Driver or vegan donuts from Donut Farm, washed down with Red Bay Coffee. The ever-popular Hog Island Oyster Company has an outpost here serving briny delights pulled from its flagship location on Tomales Bay . Also in the building is Grande Creperie, serving sweet and savory Brittany-style crepes in a French café setting. And recently opened Reem’s brings Arab street food, such as their popular mana’eesh and sharable mezze, from James Beard-nominated restaurant owner Reem Assil to the space vacated by Cowgirl Creamery. The Ferry Building outdoor seating currently holds 100 chairs and 50 tables on the back plaza, while all indoor dining areas are back to full seating capacity.\n\nThe Mission's famous street art, which spills out of alleys, splashes across the exterior of grocery stores and bodegas, and covers homes, is one of its most pronounced characteristics. Some pieces are commissioned, others more spontaneous, but all of it contributes to the neighborhood’s character. The spots you should make sure to hit if you’re touring around are Balmy Alley, just off Mission and 24th Streets, and Clarion Alley near the 16th Street BART station. If you have a bit more time, check out the neighborhood’s major mural corridors, 24th Street from Valencia to Portrero Avenue and Mission Street from the corner of 15th Street to Cesar Chavez. For a real deep dive, contact Precita Eyes Muralists, a nonprofit that runs street art tours of the neighborhood.\n\nOnce the port of entry for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Rim, Angel Island is a state park in the middle of San Francisco Bay. Hop on the ferry (your ticket includes the cost of admission), to get here from Tiburon or San Francisco. Once you get off, it's a lush scene for the eyes. The island is loaded with native plants and animals, and has views of both San Francisco and Marin. This is a great half-day activity: You can walk or bike the whole island in a few hours. You can also visit the Angel Island Immigration Station as well as the Angel Island Immigration Museum (AIIM), which opened in 2022 inside the former hospital building.\n\nFounded in the 1950s by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti and college professor Peter D. Martin, City Lights became famous for publishing Howl by Allen Ginsberg (and undergoing an obscenity trial as a result) and developed a reputation as one of the country's most interesting bookshops. Today, City Lights still publishes some of its own books, with a particular focus on poetry and titles that speak to vital political and social issues, and runs a well-stocked bookstore. If you want to supports artists, discover a new writer published by a small press, to imagine yourself in Kerouac's shoes, or to kill an hour before meeting someone for dinner, this is your place. Their selection is great and, for poetry lovers, the Poetry Room upstairs—with its vast, comprehensive collection—is a place of legend. You needn’t look far for signs of fans’ love of the place. During the pandemic, when it was thought the store might close indefinitely—and the store’s CEO posted a heartfelt GoFundMe asking readers for support—City Lights devotees donated $500,000 in four days to help the iconic store survive.\n\nA National Park established in 1994 from a massive converted Army base, the Presidio is a sprawling, scenic, wild-feeling park in San Francisco proper. The grounds have plenty of attractions, but the real appeal is visual, with trails leading to scenic overlooks of the city skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge. It is perfect for folks who want a remote-feeling walk without wanting to invest time or energy in a full out-of-town hike. The Batteries to Bluffs (.7 miles), Bay Area Ridge (2.5 miles), and Lovers' Lane trails (.6 miles) are all tremendously scenic without being strenuous and, a new addition: Hikers on the Tennessee Hollow Trail can walk through a new section of restored wetlands habitat, which stretches from Thompson Reach all the way to Crissy Field.\n\nThis former railroad and maritime town is picturesque in a classic-New England-meets-laid-back-California kind of way, and an easy day trip for a bite and shopping. Just 30 minutes across the bay on the Golden Gate Ferry, Tiburon is practically another neighborhood of San Francisco and is fast becoming a culinary destination too. Here and you can visit a museum, sample caviar and champagne, sip California wine, pick up some hand-blended spices, and grab brunch on an outdoor deck, all in an afternoon. For budget minded travelers, Tiburon can be spendy, especially if you tack on a restaurant visit to the cost of a ferry ticket. That being said, there is no cost to simply walk around Tiburon and enjoy the atmosphere. There are also places to simply grab a coffee or a sandwich, or BYO picnic if you prefer. The ferry runs on a strict schedule so check ahead for departure and return times.\n\nLocated on Clement Street in the foggy Richmond District, the eclectic Park Life fits right in with the neighborhood's diverse restaurants, cozy coffee shops, unfussy dim sum joints, and other independent stores. Like an indi-mart married an art gallery, Park Life is a champion of emerging global artists and designers who create one-of-a-kind paintings, quirky curios, interesting books, and unconventional home accessories. The inventory is ever-changing, and art and design products collected from around the world are stacked on the tables, shelves, floors, and walls of the 1,400-square-foot space. Here you might page through a book featuring maps from National Parks spanning the last 100 years, spot an oil and acrylic painting of a pink tulip that’s just right for your new office, or pick up an embroidered throw pillow or colored pencils for your studio.\n\nHoused in an airy 1917 Beaux-Arts Building—the former location of the city’s main library—the Asian Art Museum is home to a massive collection, with works from India, China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Southeast Asia, and more. The museum’s vast holdings include pottery, carvings, calligraphy, and unusual artifacts such as coffins, pipes, weapons, snuff bottles, even an entire reconstructed Zen Japanese tea room. The collection of Chinese bronze sculptures is one of the best outside of Asia. If that sounds like a lot to take in, remain calm: in the fall of 2020, the museum unveiled redesigned collection galleries, structured around 15 strikingly displayed masterpieces. Chosen for their beauty, rarity, and significance, these objects give visitors a useful lens through which to view the other 2,500 works on display. Of special note: On the first Sunday of the month, the museum offers free admission.\n\nThe oldest continuously operating public Japanese garden in North America, the Japanese Tea Garden, located in Golden Gate Park, is a wonderful spot to relax while exploring the park, but it's also worth a trip in its own right. Sitting among the perfectly pruned trees, small Japanese-style buildings, and gently flowing water features, sipping tea, it’s impossible not to relax, even on those Saturdays when the place gets a bit busier. Locals get a discount on entry ($7 instead of $10), so be sure to bring your ID.\n\nStep off the busy streets near Union Square and make your way downstairs and into the Oasis Lounge, a former speakeasy with Moroccan tile, velvet banquets, and flickering lanterns adjacent to the 35-seat jewel box theater. This is the exclusive venue of mentalist and magician Jay Alexander, whose show is a little bit Broadway, a little bit Vegas, and a little bit comedy club. It begins in the lounge with close-up magic and sleight-of-hand. The main event moves to the adjacent theater–with Alexander on stage, the interactive performance brings in the audience for mind reading, human lie detector tests, and extraordinary stunts of mind-bending magic. Even skeptics will be convinced that magic is real!\n\nThe Blue & Gold Fleet, San Francisco’s largest ferry company, takes passengers to big-name destinations around the bay: Alcatraz, Tiburon, Angel Island. In 1997, the company launched a San Francisco to Sausalito ride. The journey begins, really, at the departure point: Fisherman’s Wharf. This is the city’s thrumming tourist heart: bicycle taxis fly down the street, aspiring soul-savers hand out pamphlets, the Silver Man poses for photos, and vendors sell T-shirts and knit caps. Once you board the ferry, though, you’ve entered another realm. The engine rumbles to life, and you’re heading out onto the bay. The sounds of the pier fade gradually; then suddenly, all you can hear is the water splashing off the ship, and the low hum of the motor. As the boat cuts through the water, the city starts to shrink and fade, the familiar forms of Coit Tower, Salesforce Tower, and the Transamerica Pyramid growing ever smaller, the rest of the city a sea of matchstick buildings in eggshell and gray and white and dusty rose. Then, perhaps before you even realized it, the boat’s engines decrescendo. Sausalito emerges, a vision in green.\n\nThink of Amoeba Music as the mascot of Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco’s famously countercultural neighborhood and the epicenter of the Summer of Love. Born in 1997—the same year as Radiohead’s OK Computer and the Notorious BIG’s Life After Death—Amoeba is colorful and fascinating, a riot of color and sound. An independent music shop thriving in the age of Spotify and Amazon, the whole place has a punky, free-spirited vibe: The walls are papered with band posters, cheeky merch abounds (Iron Maiden bobbleheads, Bob Ross action figures, a Nicolas Cage prayer candle), and the staff deejays, playing ear-catching CDs of their choice from bands you may have never heard before.\n\nConceived nearly a decade ago by volunteers, neighborhood activists, and outdoor enthusiasts, San Francisco’s Crosstown Trail finally became a reality when it opened in 2019. The epic 17-mile path takes walkers, runners, and bikers diagonally across the city, from the southeast near Candlestick Point Recreation Area to the northwest corner at Sutro Baths. Along the way, you’ll traverse city streets, meander through community gardens and neighborhoods, pass cafes and restaurants (for much-needed food and water breaks), and climb up hillsides and stairways where the city and bay views don’t disappoint. Walking, running, biking the trail is free, but to do the entire thing in a day would take 8-10 hours–break it up into small sections, being sure to pass the south end of sandy Baker Beach, a perfect place for a selfie with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background."
