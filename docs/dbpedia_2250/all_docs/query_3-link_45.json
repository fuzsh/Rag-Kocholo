        "text": "Livestream and in-person tickets for Great American Music Hall performance available\n\nInfluential crossover thrash metal act MORDRED will unleash their regained power live with a hometown performance on Friday, January 22nd at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, alongside fellow Bay Area thrashers Death Angel and Molten. The show will be the band’s first performance of 2022, and another opportunity to experience songs from MORDRED’s 2021 comeback album, “The Dark Parade,” live. Tickets to see the concert in-person are now available at this link. Fans that are unable to attend will still have an opportunity to partake in the evening’s thrash metal indulgences, as the festivities will also be available to experience via livestream tickets and on VOD for seven days after the show. More information on purchasing the livestream for this concert can be found at this link.\n\nSays the band, “It’s amazing to be playing with our old friends Death Angel. The first show that I recall Mordred playing with them was Friday, April 11, 1986 at Ruthie’s Inn in Berkeley, CA, almost 26 years ago. It’s so cool that we all are still around crushing after all these years. We get to play with them AND play songs from our new album ‘The Dark Parade.’ What could be a better way to ring in the new year? We can’t wait for the show!”\n\nThe upcoming performance on January 22nd is the first of many 2022 performances to be announced by MORDRED, with info on more live shows to be revealed in the weeks to come. Their latest record, “The Dark Parade”, was released in July 2021 by M-Theory Audio and features five-sixths of the personnel from MORDRED’s acclaimed 1991 record “In This Life,” plus new drummer Jeff Gomes (formerly of Fungo Mungo and MIRV).\n\nThe new album was the follow-up to MORDRED’s acclaimed 2020 EP “Volition” and their first full-length record since 1994’s “The Next Room.” “The Dark Parade” showcases a band that that has returned to the metal scene with a revitalized energy and successfully recaptured their classic sound, which is rooted in thrash metal but veers off the straightforward path for more adventurous musical explorations by utilizing funk-infused musicianship and hip-hop influences. The final result is a record that sounds as fresh now as the band did during their initial decade of existence. CD, digital, and pre-order limited-edition black with red splatter vinyl editions of “The Dark Parade” are available for purchase at https://smarturl.com/Mordred.\n\n“Demonic #7,” the first single from the “The Dark Parade,” was revealed in April 2021 with a music video produced by graphic artist Andy Pilkington (Flotsam and Jetsam, Skindred, Rock Goddess), which can be viewed at https://youtu.be/_livW5vY9pQ. That initial offering was soon followed up with the music video for “Malignancy” – featuring appearances from fellow Bay Area metalheads Chuck Billy (Testament), Will Carroll (Death Angel) and Matt Camacho (Forbidden) – which can be viewed at https://youtu.be/rdyn3kXh7VU. The group unleashed another taste of the mayhem to be found on their latest record with a video for “All Eyes on the Prize”, which can be viewed at https://youtu.be/K6s0TVVo02M.\n\nMORDRED was formed in 1984 as the burgeoning Bay Area thrash scene was beginning its rise to global prominence. While mosh-inducing thrash formed the basic blueprint of their sound, MORDRED stood out as a unique presence thanks to their integration of the aforementioned funk and hip-hop influences. The group was one of the first metal bands to explore those diversities in extremes, but as the dexterous bass performance of Art Liboon and innovative turntable work from band collaborator Aaron “DJ Pause” Vaughn provided a new spin on the thrash metal genre,\n\nMORDRED retained their metallic bark thanks to groove-laden shred from guitarists Danny White and James Sanguinetti and energetic shout-along choruses spearheaded by vocalist Scott Holderby. That combination of thrash metal and exploratory funk powered three full-lengths on Noise Records between 1989 and 1994: their revered debut “Fool’s Game”; their eclectic sophomore follow-up “In This Life”; and their final – until last year – record, “The Next Room.”\n\nMore information on additional live shows from MORDRED will be revealed in the weeks to come by M-Theory Audio and at www.facebook.com/MordredBand.\n\nMORDRED is:\n\nScott Holderby – vocals\n\nArt Liboon – bass\n\nJames Sanguinetti – guitar\n\nDanny White – guitar\n\nAaron “DJ Pause” Vaughn – turntables/keyboards\n\nJeff Gomes – drums\n\nFor more information:\n\nwww.facebook.com/MordredBand\n\nwww.instagram.com/mordredband\n\nwww.twitter.com/mordredband\n\nwww.m-theoryaudio.com"
