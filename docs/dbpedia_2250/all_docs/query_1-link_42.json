        "text": "The year is 1988. Amidst a scorching Bay Area metal scene, emerges KAOS.\n\nHayward California high school buddies, Jason Darnell (drums), Jay Figueroa (bass), Joe Loescher(guitar) and Josh Valdez (vocals) go to work on the bay area with their first release ¡°Demo 88¡±.\n\nLanding an opening spot at the infamous Hayward Riot Show co-headlined by local metal legends Death Angel and Vio-Lence, the name KAOS was carved into the flesh of the roaring San Francisco Bay Area metal scene.\n\nTheir follow up demo, 1989¡¯s ¡°New Creation¡±, spread like wildfire through word of mouth and fan ¡®zines abroad. With 5000 copies in circulation, ¡°New Creation¡± was held high by metal fans worldwide and is still sought after today.\n\nIn 1990, KAOS finds themselves at the peak of the Bay area metal movement. With the addition of second guitarist, Tom Lettier, the band would continue to play show after show supporting some of the biggest acts in metal as well as headlining their own capacity performances.\n\nWith their much-anticipated 1991 release ¡°Vivisection¡±; KAOS marches forward into a dark abysmal bog with so many others of metals greats as the scene is immanently consumed by the new wave of flannel-clad grunge. Soon after, KAOS would part ways with Josh Valdez and Tom Lettier.\n\nWith only the strongest will to survive, at a time when fans of the genre had all but turned their back on the Bay Area brand of metal, KAOS would recruit guitarist Stacey Murray and drummer Sean Boyles moving Jason Darnell to front man and vocalist. This would mark the beginning of a new chapter in KAOS history.\n\nKAOS would go on to release several demos through 1995. With all of the major venues gone, no stage left to light and all ages shows becoming a thing of the past, the band would dismantle seeing its members go on to pursue families, carriers and other interests. KAOS would be no more¡­¡­.\n\nWith the turn of the century a spark would ignite a new flame under the San Francisco Bay Area Metal scene. KAOS finds themselves together once again in the form of Jason Darnell, Stacey Murray, Jay Figueroa and Joe Loescher and would quickly release their fist ever full length CD entitled ¡°Vision Beyond¡±. The music would fall into the hands of local and international press as well as Northern California metal fans with open arms. KAOS would drive forward in promoting ¡°Vision Beyond¡± with several temporary drummers once again supporting numerous Bay Area greats.\n\nIn 2003, drummer Burton Ortega would fill the revolving drum position and enter the studio with famed engineer/producer Mark Keaton (Machine Head, Exodus, High on Fire) to record and co-produce their sophomore full length, ¡°Kaos Among Us¡±. With the sudden departure of Joe Loescher and immediate replacement Keven Albert, the band would commence to storm the bay area with their powerful live performance as well as appearing at the New Jersey Metal Melt Down VI and the Milwaukee Metal Fest XVII supporting acts such as Testament, M.O.D., Death Angel and The Black Dahlia Murder.\n\nThe Band would continue to support ¡°Kaos Among Us¡± through 2005 making and appearance at the ¡°Thrash Against Cancer¡± benefit concert with Testament, The re-united Laaz Rocket and Vicious Rumors. Soon After KAOS would Team up with Tambre¡¯ Bryant of Relentless Metal Records (Heathen, Warning S.F., Ulysses Siren, Angel Witch) to re-release ¡°Kaos Among Us¡± to the world in 2006.\n\nThe recent events would get KAOS an invitation to the prestigious Tenth anniversary of the Head bangers Open Air in Elmshorn Germany to support Candlemass, Rage and Grim Reaper to name a few. Here KAOS would be medaled the first band in the history of the festival to start a Bay Area style circle pit.\n\nCurrently, the band is preparing to release their third full length CD slated to be titled ¡°The Pits of Existence¡± while continuing to support metal legends like Forbidden, Exodus and Vicious Rumors. Now, more than ever before, this band is ready to march the planet waving the metal flag and bringing their brand of Bay Area metal into every venue they step foot in. KAOS is among us. KAOS among us all.away.\n\n(taken from kaosamongus.com)"
