Veteran San Francisco Bay Area metallers DEATH ANGEL will perform at the Haight Street Fair in San Francisco on Sunday, June 14. They will hit the Haight/Masonic Street stage at 4:20 p.m.

DEATH ANGEL's longtime drummer and original member Andrew Galeon recently left the band. Will Carroll (SCARECROW, OLD GRANDAD, VICIOUS RUMORS) will hande the drum duties for the upcoming local shows in June and the Summer Madness Tour in Europe with KATAKLYSM and KEEP OF KALESSIN. The group said, "Will's been jamming with us for over a month now and is tearing it up! We look forward to hitting the stage with him very soonâ€¦ We'll be performing songs from 'Frolic' and 'Act III' that we haven't played live since back in the day so prepare for a dose of some serious old-school thrash!"
