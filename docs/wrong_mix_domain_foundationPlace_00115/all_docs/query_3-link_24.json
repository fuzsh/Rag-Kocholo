No. 61/124,297, filed Apr. 16, 2008, the entire contents of both applications being hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nThis invention was made with government support under 1R21HL91808-01 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nI. Field of the Invention\n\nThe present invention relates to the fields of molecular biology and medicine. More particularly, it relates to zinc finger nucleases and their use in treating cystic fibrosis.\n\nII. Related Art\n\nA. Cystic Fibrosis\n\nCystic fibrosis, or CF, is an inherited disease of epithelia-lined organs, including the glands that make mucus and sweat. âInheritedâ means that the disease is passed through the genes from parents to children. People who have CF inherit two faulty cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genes, one from each parent. CF mostly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. The symptoms and severity of CF vary from person to personâsome people who have CF have serious lung and digestive problems, while others have more mild disease that does not show up until they are adolescents or adults. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time.\n\nThe disease manifests because if one has CF, mucus becomes thick and sticky. In the lungs, airway innate immunity is impaired, mucus builds up and blocks airways. The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow, which leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage lungs. The abnormal secretions also can block ducts in the pancreas. As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes cannot reach your small intestine, causing vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients leave the body unused. It also can cause bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from partial or complete intestinal obstruction, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty and, as a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause a number of health problem, including dehydration, increased heart rate, tiredness, weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death.\n\nAs treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their thirties, forties, fifties, or older. However, CF remains the leading genetic cause of premature death in the United States. As such, improved methods of treating CF are in great need.\n\nB. Zinc Finger Nucleases\n\nZinc fingers are among the most common DNA binding motifs found in eukaryotes. It is estimated that there are 500 zinc finger proteins encoded by the yeast genome and that perhaps 1% of all mammalian genes encode zinc finger containing proteins. These proteins are classified according to the number and position of the cysteine and histidine residues available for zinc coordination.\n\nThe CCHH class, typified by the Xenopus transcription factor IIIA, is the largest. These proteins contain two or more fingers in tandem repeats. In contrast, the steroid receptors contain only cysteine residues that form two types of zinc-coordinated structures with four (C4) and five (C5) cysteines. Another class of zinc fingers contains the CCHC fingers. The CCHC fingers, which are found in Drosophila, and in mammalian and retroviral proteins, display the consensus sequence CâN2âCâN4âHâN4âC (SEQ ID NO:111). Recently, a novel configuration of CCHC finger, of the CâN5âCâN12âHâN4âC (SEQ ID NO:112) type, was found in the neural zinc finger factor/myelin transcription factor family. Finally, several yeast transcription factors such as GAL4 and CHA4 contain an atypical C6 zinc finger structure that coordinates two zinc ions. Zinc fingers are usually found in multiple copies (up to 37) per protein. These copies can be organized in a tandem array, forming a single cluster or multiple clusters, or they can be dispersed throughout the protein.\n\nZinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) can be used to ârewriteâ the sequence of an allele by invoking the homologous recombination machinery to repair the double-strand breaks using a supplied DNA fragment as a template. The homologous recombination machinery searches for homology between the damaged chromosome and the extra-chromosomal fragment and copies the sequence of the fragment between the two broken ends of the chromosome, regardless of whether the fragment contains the original sequence. If the subject is homozygous for the target allele, the efficiency of the technique is reduced since the undamaged copy of the allele may be used as a template for repair instead of the supplied fragment.\n\nCustom-designed ZFNs that combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of FokI endonuclease with zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) offer a general way to deliver a site-specific double-strand breaks to the genome, and stimulate local homologous recombination by several orders of magnitude. This makes targeted gene correction or genome editing a viable option in human cells. Since ZFN-encoded plasmids can be used to transiently express ZFNs to target a double-strand break to a specific gene locus in human cells, they offer an excellent way for targeted delivery of the therapeutic genes to a pre-selected chromosomal site. The ZFN-encoded plasmid-based approach has the potential to circumvent problems associated with viral delivery of therapeutic genes. Alternatively, ZFN pairs can be packaged in a variety of viral vectors to improve delivery to specific cell types.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThus, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a zinc three-finger binding domain that targets a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of GTGGAATTA (SEQ ID NO:1) and GAGTGGTTA (SEQ ID NO:2). The zinc three-finger binding domain may comprise a sequence selected from wherein one monomer of said dimer comprises a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, 24-26, 27-29, 30-32, 33-35 and 36-38 for GTGGAATTA (SEQ ID NO:1) and selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: SEQ ID NOS:39-41, 42-44, 45-47, 48-50, 51-53, 54-56, 57-59, 60-62, 63-65, 66-68, 69-71, 72-74, 75-77, 78-80, 81-83, 84-86, 87-89, 90-92, 91-93, 94-96, 97-99, 100-102, 103-105, 106-108, and 109-111 for GAGTGGTTA (SEQ ID NO:2).

The genomic DNA is harvested 4 days post transduction. PCR using primers binding outside of the donor template and radiolabeled dNTPs is followed by BspH I digestion. The presence of fragments at 1136 and 504 bp indicates HR. Direct DNA sequencing also documented HR in cells receiving AdZ and AdD, but not AdZ alone.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nEngineered zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) are broadly applicable tools that have been shown to mediate highly efficient genome modification in Drosophila, C. elegans, plant, and human cells (Alwin et al., 2005; Beumer et al., 2006; Bibikova et al., 2003; Bibikova et al., 2002; Cornu et al., 2008; Lloyd et al., 2005; Lombardo et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2007; Moehle et al., 2007; Morton et al., 2006; Porteus and Baltimore, 2003; Szczepek et al., 2007; Urnov et al., 2005; Wright et al., 2005). ZFNs function as dimers with each monomer consisting of a non-specific cleavage domain from the FokI endonuclease fused to an array of artificial zinc-fingers engineered to bind a target DNA sequence of interest (Durai et al., 2005; Porteus and Carroll, 2005). Individual zinc-finger domains bind to 3 bp subsites, and arrays of fingers can recognize extended 9 or 12 bp sequence targets. ZFNs introduce site-specific, double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) that stimulate either highly efficient gene targeting by homologous recombination with an exogenously introduced template (Jasin, 1996) or gene mutation by error-prone non-homologous endjoining (NHEJ). Absolute rates of ZFN-enhanced gene modification can be as high as 50% (Lombardo et al., 2007).\n\nLack of access to a rapid and effective zinc-finger engineering platform has significantly limited the efforts of academic scientists to use and further develop ZFN technology. It is striking that in the five years since ZFNs were first shown to work in human cells, not one academic group has successfully made ZFNs for even a single endogenous mammalian or plant gene (although endogenous Drosophila genes have been modified (Beumer et al., 2006; Bibikova et al., 2003)). The proprietary zinc-finger engineering platform of the company Sangamo Biosciences is not freely available to academic scientists and thus remains a âblack boxâ with respect to both its implementation and efficacy (Scott, 2005). The published literature describes many different publicly available zinc-finger engineering methods which can be broadly grouped into two general categories: (1) âmodular assemblyâ methods in which individual fingers with pre-characterized specificities are joined together (Bae et al., 2003; Beerli and Barbas, 2002; Liu et al., 2002; Mandell and Barbas, 2006; Segal, 2002; Segal et al., 2003) or (2) labor-intensive selection-based methods which require multiple large randomized libraries (Greisman and Pabo, 1997; Hurt et al., 2003; Isalan and Choo, 2001; Isalan et al., 2001).\n\nAlthough modular assembly is easy to perform, the inventors have recently shown that its overall efficacy for making functional ZFN pairs is predicted to be less than 6% (Ramirez et al., 2008) and that even when âsuccessfulâ it yields ZFNs with low activities and/or high toxicities (Cornu et al., 2008; Pruett-Miller et al., 2008). Selection-based methods require construction and interrogation of multiple, large randomized libraries (typically >108 in size) and therefore remain intractable for all but a small number of academic labs. Thus, unlike other broadly accessible technologies like RNA interference, ZFN-induced genome modification has been utilized by very few academic scientists.\n\nThe inventors describe here the development and validation of OPEN (Oligomerized Pool ENgineering), a facile and robust platform for engineering customized zinc-finger arrays. OPEN is enabled by the construction of a large archive of zinc-finger pools designed to bind various DNA sequences. This archive was constructed by the Zinc Finger Consortium, a group of academic laboratories committed to the development of engineered zinc-finger technology (world-wide-web at zincfingers.org). They employed OPEN to rapidly and successfully engineer a large set of zinc-finger arrays: 269 unique multi-finger arrays for 34 different target sites. The inventors then used a subset of these arrays to construct 37 active ZFN pairs for 11 different target sites located within three endogenous human genes (VEGF-A, HoxB13, CFTR), an endogenous plant gene (tobacco SuRA), and the EGFP reporter gene. Using these ZFNs, they show that: (i) OPEN is significantly more robust than the existing modular assembly engineering method, (ii) OPEN ZFNs induce stable genome modifications with high efficiency (absolute rates ranging from 1-50% and with changes in as many as four alleles in a single cell), and (iii) OPEN ZFNs possess activities and toxicities comparable to those of an extensively optimized ZFN pair previously reported.\n\nMoreover, the inventors have identified specific ZFNs that are designed to target the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, thereby providing a potential therapy for cystic fibrosis. In the present embodiment the focus is on modification of exon 10 of the CFTR gene, site of the most common human disease associated mutation, ÎF508, cause by a 3 bp deletion. Delivery methods and vectors for expression ZFNs are provided that enhance the homologous recombination within the CFTR gene. These and other aspects of the invention are described further below.\n\nI. ZINC FINGER NUCLEASES A. Zinc Finger Proteins\n\nZinc fingers are part of a large superfamily of protein domains that can bind to DNA. A zinc finger consists of two antiparallel Î² strands, and an Î± helix. The zinc ion is crucial for the stability of this domain typeâin the absence of the metal ion the domain unfolds as it is too small to have a hydrophobic core. One very well explored subset of zinc-fingers (the C2H2 class) comprises a pair of cysteine residues in the beta strands and two histidine residues in the alpha helix which are responsible for binding a zinc ion. The two other classes of zinc finger proteins are the C4 and C6 classes. Zinc fingers are important in regulation because when interacted with DNA and zinc ion, they provide a unique structural motif for DNA-binding proteins.\n\nThe structure of each individual finger is highly conserved and consists of about 30 amino acid residues, constructed as a Î²Î²Î± fold and held together by the zinc ion. The Î±-helix occurs at the C-terminal part of the finger, while the Î²-sheet occurs at the N-terminal part. This is most useful in tanscription process. The consensus sequence of a single finger is:\n\n(SEQâIDâNO:â113) Cys-X2-4-Cys-X3-Phe-X5-Leu-X2-His-X3-His\n\nMany transcription factors (such as Zif268), regulatory proteins, and other proteins that interact with DNA contain zinc fingers. These proteins typically interact with the major groove along the double helix of DNA in which case the zinc fingers are arranged around the DNA strand in such a way that the Î±-helix of each finger contacts the DNA, forming an almost continuous stretch of Î±-helices around the DNA molecule. Some primary neuron-specific transcriptional regulator that may be involved in mediating early neural development are also zinc finger-based.\n\nThe binding specificity for 3-4 base pairs is conferred by a short stretch of amino acid residues in the Î±-helix. The primary position of the amino acid residues within the Î±-helix interacting with the DNA are at positions â1, 3 and 6 relative to the first amino acid residue of the Î±-helix. Other amino acid positions can also influence binding specificity by assisting amino acid residues to bind a specific base or by contacting a fourth base in the opposite strand, causing target-site overlap.\n\nB. ZFNs\n\nZinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are protein chimera comprised of a zinc finger-based DNA-binding domain and a DNA-cleavage domain. They are able to introduce double-strand breaks (DSB; breaks at the same or very close points in both strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule) at specific locations within a DNA molecule which may subsequently be used to disable a specific allele or even rewrite the code it contains. Inventor of the zinc finger nuclease is Srinivasan Chandrasegaran from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md. ZFNs are undergoing development for use in gene therapy and research applications.\n\nThe DNA-binding domain of a ZFN may be composed of two to six zinc fingers due to their supposed modularity (appositeness to be used interchangeably). Each zinc finger motif is typically considered to recognise and bind to a three-base pair sequence and as such, a protein including more zinc fingers targets a longer sequence and therefore has a greater specificity and affinity to the target site. Depending upon the required specifications of the end-product, the included zinc fingers may be selected via a parallel, sequential or bipartite technique or through an in vitro cell-based technique.\n\nThe non-specific nuclease domain of FokI is functionally independent of its natural DNA-binding domain and is therefore employed in the construction of ZFNs. Since the domain must dimerise to accomplish a double-strand break it is necessary that a nuclease is also bound to the opposite strand by virtue of another ZFN molecule bound to its target sequence as shown in the diagram. The two target sites need not be the same, so long as ZFNs targeting both sites are present. In order to form a dimer, two ZFN molecules must meet with their respective recognition sites not less than 4-6 base pairs apart but also not so far apart that they may not dimerise. While one ZFN molecule binds its target sequence on one strand, another ZFN molecule binds its target sequence on the opposite strand, as shown in the diagram. The nuclease domains dimerise and each cleaves its own strand, producing a DSB. FokI can be employed as a homo- or a heterodimer. The advantage of the heterodimer is that it may reduce off target effects (Miller et al., 2007).\n\nZFNs can be used to disable dominant mutations in heterozygous individuals by producing DSBs in the mutant allele which will, in the absence of a homologous template, be repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). NHEJ repairs double-strand breaks by joining the two ends together and usually produces no mutations, provided that the cut is clean and uncomplicated. In some instances however, the repair will be imperfect, resulting in deletion or insertion of base-pairs, producing frame-shift and preventing the production of the harmful protein.\n\nC. Expression Systems for ZFNs\n\nIn particular embodiments, the ZFN may advantageously be delivered to a host cell or subject using a recombinant vector encoding the ZFN. The term ârecombinantâ generally refers to a polypeptide produced from a nucleic acid molecule that has been manipulated in vitro or that is the replicated product of such a molecule.\n\nThe nucleic acid segments used in the present invention, regardless of the length of the coding sequence itself, may be combined with other nucleic acid sequences, such as promoters, polyadenylation signals, additional restriction enzyme sites, multiple cloning sites, other coding segments, and the like, such that their overall length may vary considerably. It is therefore contemplated that a nucleic acid fragment of almost any length may be employed, with the total length preferably being limited by the ease of preparation and use in the intended recombinant DNA protocol.\n\nThe term âvectorâ is used to refer to a carrier nucleic acid molecule into which a nucleic acid sequence can be inserted for introduction into a cell where it can be replicated. A nucleic acid sequence can be âexogenous,â which means that it is foreign to the cell into which the vector is being introduced or that the sequence is homologous to a sequence in the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the sequence is ordinarily not found. Vectors include plasmids, cosmids, viruses (bacteriophage, animal viruses, and plant viruses), and artificial chromosomes (e.g., YACs). One of skill in the art would be well equipped to construct a vector through standard recombinant techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989; Ausubel et al., 1996, both incorporated herein by reference). In addition to encoding a modified polypeptide such as modified gelonin, a vector may encode non-modified polypeptide sequences such as a tag or targetting molecule. Useful vectors encoding such fusion proteins include pIN vectors (Inouye et al., 1985), vectors encoding a stretch of histidines, and pGEX vectors, for use in generating glutathione S-transferase (GST) soluble fusion proteins for later purification and separation or cleavage. A targetting molecule is one that directs the modified polypeptide to a particular organ, tissue, cell, or other location in a subject's body.\n\nThe term âexpression vectorâ refers to a vector containing a nucleic acid sequence coding for at least part of a gene product capable of being transcribed. In some cases, RNA molecules are then translated into a protein, polypeptide, or peptide. In other cases, these sequences are not translated, for example, in the production of antisense molecules or ribozymes. Expression vectors can contain a variety of âcontrol sequences,â which refer to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and possibly translation of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. In addition to control sequences that govern transcription and translation, vectors and expression vectors may contain nucleic acid sequences that serve other functions as well and are described infra.\n\n1. Promoters and Enhancers\n\nA âpromoterâ is a control sequence that is a region of a nucleic acid sequence at which initiation and rate of transcription are controlled. It may contain genetic elements at which regulatory proteins and molecules may bind such as RNA polymerase and other transcription factors. The phrases âoperatively positioned,â âoperatively linked,â âunder control,â and âunder transcriptional controlâ mean that a promoter is in a correct functional location and/or orientation in relation to a nucleic acid sequence to control transcriptional initiation and/or expression of that sequence. A promoter may or may not be used in conjunction with an âenhancer,â which refers to a cis-acting regulatory sequence involved in the transcriptional activation of a nucleic acid sequence.\n\nA promoter may be one naturally associated with a gene or sequence, as may be obtained by isolating the 5â² non-coding sequences located upstream of the coding segment and/or exon. Such a promoter can be referred to as âendogenous.â Similarly, an enhancer may be one naturally associated with a nucleic acid sequence, located either downstream or upstream of that sequence. Alternatively, certain advantages will be gained by positioning the coding nucleic acid segment under the control of a recombinant or heterologous promoter, which refers to a promoter that is not normally associated with a nucleic acid sequence in its natural environment. A recombinant or heterologous enhancer refers also to an enhancer not normally associated with a nucleic acid sequence in its natural environment. Such promoters or enhancers may include promoters or enhancers of other genes, and promoters or enhancers isolated from any other prokaryotic, viral, or eukaryotic cell, and promoters or enhancers not ânaturally occurring,â i.e., containing different elements of different transcriptional regulatory regions, and/or mutations that alter expression. In addition to producing nucleic acid sequences of promoters and enhancers synthetically, sequences may be produced using recombinant cloning and/or nucleic acid amplification technology, including PCRâ¢, in connection with the compositions disclosed herein (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202, U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,906, each incorporated herein by reference). Furthermore, it is contemplated the control sequences that direct transcription and/or expression of sequences within non-nuclear organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the like, can be employed as well.\n\nNaturally, it may be important to employ a promoter and/or enhancer that effectively directs the expression of the DNA segment in the cell type, organelle, and organism chosen for expression. Those of skill in the art of molecular biology generally know the use of promoters, enhancers, and cell type combinations for protein expression, for example, see Sambrook et al. (1989), incorporated herein by reference. The promoters employed may be constitutive, tissue-specific, inducible, and/or useful under the appropriate conditions to direct high level expression of the introduced DNA segment, such as is advantageous in the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and/or peptides. The promoter may be heterologous or endogenous. The identity of tissue-specific promoters or elements, as well as assays to characterize their activity, is well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n2. Initiation Signals and Internal Ribosome Binding Sites\n\nA specific initiation signal also may be required for efficient translation of coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon or adjacent sequences. Exogenous translational control signals, including the ATG initiation codon, may need to be provided. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily be capable of determining this and providing the necessary signals. It is well known that the initiation codon must be âin-frameâ with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. The exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be either natural or synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements.\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the use of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) elements are used to create multigene, or polycistronic, messages. IRES elements are able to bypass the ribosome scanning model of 5â²-methylated Cap dependent translation and begin translation at internal sites (Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988). IRES elements from two members of the picornavirus family (polio and encephalomyocarditis) have been described (Pelletier and Sonenberg, 1988), as well an IRES from a mammalian message (Macejak and Sarnow, 1991). IRES elements can be linked to heterologous open reading frames. Multiple open reading frames can be transcribed together, each separated by an IRES, creating polycistronic messages. By virtue of the IRES element, each open reading frame is accessible to ribosomes for efficient translation. Multiple genes can be efficiently expressed using a single promoter/enhancer to transcribe a single message (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,925,565 and 5,935,819, herein incorporated by reference). The picornavirus-derived, self-cleaving 2A peptide, designated T2A, allows for the efficient translation of multiple cistrons and therefore is an additional element that can be employed in multi-cistronic messages.\n\n3. Multiple Cloning Sites\n\nVectors can include a multiple cloning site (MCS), which is a nucleic acid region that contains multiple restriction enzyme sites, any of which can be used in conjunction with standard recombinant technology to digest the vector. (See Carbonelli et al., 1999, Levenson et al., 1998, and Cocea, 1997, incorporated herein by reference.) âRestriction enzyme digestionâ refers to catalytic cleavage of a nucleic acid molecule with an enzyme that functions only at specific locations in a nucleic acid molecule. Many of these restriction enzymes are commercially available. Use of such enzymes is widely understood by those of skill in the art. Frequently, a vector is linearized or fragmented using a restriction enzyme that cuts within the MCS to enable exogenous sequences to be ligated to the vector. âLigationâ refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two nucleic acid fragments, which may or may not be contiguous with each other. Techniques involving restriction enzymes and ligation reactions are well known to those of skill in the art of recombinant technology.\n\n4. Splicing Sites\n\nMost transcribed eukaryotic RNA molecules will undergo RNA splicing to remove introns from the primary transcripts. Vectors containing genomic eukaryotic sequences may require donor and/or acceptor splicing sites to ensure proper processing of the transcript for protein expression. (See Chandler et al., 1997, incorporated herein by reference.)\n\n5. Termination Signals\n\nThe vectors or constructs of the present invention will generally comprise at least one termination signal. A âtermination signalâ or âterminatorâ is comprised of the DNA sequences involved in specific termination of an RNA transcript by an RNA polymerase. Thus, in certain embodiments a termination signal that ends the production of an RNA transcript is contemplated. A terminator may be necessary in vivo to achieve desirable message levels.\n\nIn eukaryotic systems, the terminator region may also comprise specific DNA sequences that permit site-specific cleavage of the new transcript so as to expose a polyadenylation site. This signals a specialized endogenous polymerase to add a stretch of about 200 A residues (polyA) to the 3â² end of the transcript. RNA molecules modified with this polyA tail appear to more stable and are translated more efficiently. Thus, in other embodiments involving eukaryotes, it is preferred that that terminator comprises a signal for the cleavage of the RNA, and it is more preferred that the terminator signal promotes polyadenylation of the message. The terminator and/or polyadenylation site elements can serve to enhance message levels and/or to minimize read through from the cassette into other sequences.\n\nTerminators contemplated for use in the invention include any known terminator of transcription described herein or known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to, for example, the termination sequences of genes, such as for example the bovine growth hormone terminator or viral termination sequences, such as for example the SV40 terminator. In certain embodiments, the termination signal may be a lack of transcribable or translatable sequence, such as due to a sequence truncation.\n\n6. Polyadenylation Signals\n\nIn expression, particularly eukaryotic expression, one will typically include a polyadenylation signal to effect proper polyadenylation of the transcript. The nature of the polyadenylation signal is not believed to be crucial to the successful practice of the invention, and/or any such sequence may be employed. Preferred embodiments include the SV40 polyadenylation signal and/or the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal, convenient and/or known to function well in various target cells. Polyadenylation may increase the stability of the transcript or may facilitate cytoplasmic transport.\n\n7. Origins of Replication\n\nIn order to propagate a vector in a host cell, it may contain one or more origins of replication sites (often termed âoriâ), which is a specific nucleic acid sequence at which replication is initiated. Alternatively an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) can be employed if the host cell is yeast.\n\n8. Selectable and Screenable Markers\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, cells containing a nucleic acid construct of the present invention may be identified in vitro or in vivo by including a marker in the expression vector. Such markers would confer an identifiable change to the cell permitting easy identification of cells containing the expression vector. Generally, a selectable marker is one that confers a property that allows for selection. A positive selectable marker is one in which the presence of the marker allows for its selection, while a negative selectable marker is one in which its presence prevents its selection. An example of a positive selectable marker is a drug resistance marker.\n\nUsually the inclusion of a drug selection marker aids in the cloning and identification of transformants, for example, genes that confer resistance to neomycin, puromycin, hygromycin, DHFR, GPT, zeocin and histidinol are useful selectable markers. In addition to markers conferring a phenotype that allows for the discrimination of transformants based on the implementation of conditions, other types of markers including screenable markers such as GFP, whose basis is colorimetric analysis, are also contemplated. Alternatively, screenable enzymes such as herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) may be utilized. One of skill in the art would also know how to employ immunologic markers, possibly in conjunction with FACS analysis. The marker used is not believed to be important, so long as it is capable of being expressed simultaneously with the nucleic acid encoding a gene product. Further examples of selectable and screenable markers are well known to one of skill in the art.\n\n9. Host Cells\n\nAs used herein, the terms âcell,â âcell line,â and âcell cultureâ may be used interchangeably. All of these terms also include their progeny, which is any and all subsequent generations. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. In the context of expressing a heterologous nucleic acid sequence, âhost cellâ refers to a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, and it includes any transformable organisms that is capable of replicating a vector and/or expressing a heterologous gene encoded by a vector. A host cell can, and has been, used as a recipient for vectors. A host cell may be âtransfectedâ or âtransformed,â which refers to a process by which exogenous nucleic acid, such as a modified protein-encoding sequence, is transferred or introduced into the host cell. A transformed cell includes the primary subject cell and its progeny.\n\nHost cells may be derived from prokaryotes or eukaryotes, including yeast cells, insect cells, and mammalian cells, depending upon whether the desired result is replication of the vector or expression of part or all of the vector-encoded nucleic acid sequences. Numerous cell lines and cultures are available for use as a host cell, and they can be obtained through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), which is an organization that serves as an archive for living cultures and genetic materials (world-wide-web at atcc.org). An appropriate host can be determined by one of skill in the art based on the vector backbone and the desired result. A plasmid or cosmid, for example, can be introduced into a prokaryote host cell for replication of many vectors. Bacterial cells used as host cells for vector replication and/or expression include DH5Î±, JM109, and KC8, as well as a number of commercially available bacterial hosts such as SUREÂ® Competent Cells and SOLOPACKâ¢ Gold Cells (STRATAGENEÂ®, La Jolla, Calif.). Alternatively, bacterial cells such as E. coli LE392 could be used as host cells for phage viruses. Appropriate yeast cells include Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pombe, and Pichia pastoris.\n\nExamples of eukaryotic host cells for replication and/or expression of a vector include HeLa, NIH3T3, Jurkat, 293, Cos, CHO, Saos, and PC12. Many host cells from various cell types and organisms are available and would be known to one of skill in the art. Similarly, a viral vector may be used in conjunction with either a eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cell, particularly one that is permissive for replication or expression of the vector.\n\nSome vectors may employ control sequences that allow it to be replicated and/or expressed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. One of skill in the art would further understand the conditions under which to incubate all of the above described host cells to maintain them and to permit replication of a vector. Also understood and known are techniques and conditions that would allow large-scale production of vectors, as well as production of the nucleic acids encoded by vectors and their cognate polypeptides, proteins, or peptides.\n\n10. Commercial Expression Systems\n\nNumerous expression systems exist that comprise at least a part or all of the compositions discussed above. Prokaryote- and/or eukaryote-based systems can be employed for use with the present invention to produce nucleic acid sequences, or their cognate polypeptides, proteins and peptides. Many such systems are commercially and widely available.\n\nThe insect cell/baculovirus system can produce a high level of protein expression of a heterologous nucleic acid segment, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,871,986, 4,879,236, both herein incorporated by reference, and which can be bought, for example, under the name MAXBACÂ® 2.0 from INVITROGENÂ® and BACPACKâ¢ BACULOVIRUS EXPRESSION SYSTEM FROM CLONTECHÂ®.\n\nIn addition to the disclosed expression systems of the invention, other examples of expression systems include STRATAGENEÂ®'S COMPLETE CONTROLâ¢ Inducible Mammalian Expression System, which involves a synthetic ecdysone-inducible receptor, or its pET Expression System, an E. coli expression system. Another example of an inducible expression system is available from INVITROGENÂ®, which carries the T-REXâ¢ (tetracycline-regulated expression) System, an inducible mammalian expression system that uses the full-length CMV promoter. INVITROGENÂ® also provides a yeast expression system called the Pichia methanolica Expression System, which is designed for high-level production of recombinant proteins in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia methanolica. One of skill in the art would know how to express a vector, such as an expression construct, to produce a nucleic acid sequence or its cognate polypeptide, protein, or peptide.\n\n11. Viral Vectors\n\nThere are a number of ways in which expression vectors may be introduced into cells. In certain embodiments of the invention, the expression vector comprises a virus or engineered vector derived from a viral genome. The ability of certain viruses to enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, to integrate into host cell genome and express viral genes stably and efficiently have made them attractive candidates for the transfer of foreign genes into mammalian cells (Ridgeway, 1988; Nicolas and Rubinstein, 1988; Baichwal and Sugden, 1986; Temin, 1986). The first viruses used as gene vectors were DNA viruses including the papovaviruses (simian virus 40, bovine papilloma virus, and polyoma) (Ridgeway, 1988; Baichwal and Sugden, 1986) and adenoviruses (Ridgeway, 1988; Baichwal and Sugden, 1986). These have a relatively low capacity for foreign DNA sequences and have a restricted host spectrum. Furthermore, their oncogenic potential and cytopathic effects in permissive cells raise safety concerns. They can accommodate only up to 8 kb of foreign genetic material but can be readily introduced in a variety of cell lines and laboratory animals (Nicolas and Rubinstein, 1988; Temin, 1986).\n\nThe retroviruses are a group of single-stranded RNA viruses characterized by an ability to convert their RNA to double-stranded DNA in infected cells; they can also be used as vectors. Lentiviruses are complex retroviruses, which, in addition to the common retroviral genes gag, pol, and env, contain other genes with regulatory or structural function. Lentiviral vectors are well known in the art (see, for example, Naldini et al., 1996; Zufferey et al., 1997; Blomer et al., 1997; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,516 and 5,994,136). Some examples of lentivirus include the Human Immunodeficiency Viruses: HIV-1, HIV-2 and the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus: SIV. Lentiviral vectors have been generated by multiply attenuating the HIV virulence genes, for example, the genes env, vif, vpr, vpu and nef are deleted making the vector biologically safe.\n\nRecombinant lentiviral vectors are capable of infecting non-dividing cells and can be used for both in vivo and ex vivo gene transfer and expression of nucleic acid sequences. For example, recombinant lentivirus capable of infecting a non-dividing cell wherein a suitable host cell is transfected with two or more vectors carrying the packaging functions, namely gag, pol and env, as well as rev and tat is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,136, incorporated herein by reference. One may target the recombinant virus by linkage of the envelope protein with an antibody or a particular ligand for targeting to a receptor of a particular cell-type. By inserting a sequence (including a regulatory region) of interest into the viral vector, along with another gene which encodes the ligand for a receptor on a specific target cell, for example, the vector is now target-specific.\n\nOther viral vectors may be employed as expression constructs in the present invention. Vectors derived from viruses such as vaccinia virus (Ridgeway, 1988; Baichwal and Sugden, 1986; Coupar et al., 1988) adeno-associated virus (AAV) (Ridgeway, 1988; Baichwal and Sugden, 1986; Hermonat and Muzycska, 1984) and herpesviruses may be employed. They offer several attractive features for various mammalian cells (Friedmann, 1989; Ridgeway, 1988; Baichwal and Sugden, 1986; Coupar et al., 1988; Horwich et al., 1990).\n\n12. Methods of Gene Transfer\n\nSuitable methods for nucleic acid delivery to effect expression of compositions of the present invention are believed to include virtually any method by which a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, including viral and nonviral vectors) can be introduced into an organelle, a cell, a tissue or an organism, as described herein or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, direct delivery of DNA such as by injection (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,994,624, 5,981,274, 5,945,100, 5,780,448, 5,736,524, 5,702,932, 5,656,610, 5,589,466 and 5,580,859, each incorporated herein by reference), including microinjection (Harland and Weintraub, 1985; U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,215, incorporated herein by reference); by electroporation (U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,253, incorporated herein by reference); by calcium phosphate precipitation (Graham and Van Der Eb, 1973; Chen and Okayama, 1987; Rippe et al., 1990); by using DEAE-dextran followed by polyethylene glycol (Gopal, 1985); by direct sonic loading (Fechheimer et al., 1987); by liposome mediated transfection (Nicolau and Sene, 1982; Fraley et al., 1979; Nicolau et al., 1987; Wong et al., 1980; Kaneda et al., 1989; Kato et al., 1991); by microprojectile bombardment (PCT Application Nos. WO 94/09699 and 95/06128; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,610,042; 5,322,783 5,563,055, 5,550,318, 5,538,877 and 5,538,880, and each incorporated herein by reference); by agitation with silicon carbide fibers (Kaeppler et al., 1990; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,302,523 and 5,464,765, each incorporated herein by reference); by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,616 and 5,563,055, each incorporated herein by reference); or by PEG-mediated transformation of protoplasts (Omirulleh et al., 1993; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,684,611 and 4,952,500, each incorporated herein by reference); by desiccation/inhibition-mediated DNA uptake (Potrykus et al., 1985). Through the application of techniques such as these, organelle(s), cell(s), tissue(s) or organism(s) may be stably or transiently transformed.\n\nII. CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND CFTR A. Cystic Fibrosis (CF)\n\nCystic Fibrosis (also known as CF) is a hereditary disease affecting the exocrine (mucus) glands of the lungs, liver, pancreas, and intestines, causing progressive disability due to multisystem failure. Abnormally thick mucus results in frequent lung infections. Diminished secretion of pancreatic enzymes is the main cause of poor growth, greasy stools, and deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins. Males can be infertile due to the condition congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Often, symptoms of CF appear in infancy and childhood. Meconium ileus is a typical finding in newborn babies with CF.\n\nThere is no known cure for CF, and most individuals with cystic fibrosis die young: many in their 20's and 30's from lung failure. The predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 37 years. However, with the continuous introduction of many new treatments, the life expectancy of a person with CF is increasing to ages as high as 40 or 50. Lung transplantation is often necessary as CF worsens.\n\nCystic fibrosis is one of the most common life-shortening genetic diseases. In the United States, 1 in 4,000 children is born with CF. It is most common among western European populations; one in twenty-two people of Mediterranean descent is a carrier of one gene for CF, making it the most common genetic disease in these populations. In 1997, about 1 in 3,300 caucasian children in the United States was born with cystic fibrosis. In contrast, only 1 in 15,000 African American children suffered from cystic fibrosis, and in Asian Americans the rate was even lower at 1 in 32,000.\n\nCF is caused by a mutation in the gene, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The product of this gene is a chloride ion channel important in creating sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. Although most people without CF have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Therefore, CF is considered an autosomal recessive disease.\n\nCystic fibrosis may be diagnosed by many different categories of testing including those such as, newborn screening, sweat testing, or genetic testing. As of 2006 in the United States, 10 percent of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth as part of newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test in order to confirm the CF diagnosis. Trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, even in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns is somewhat controversial. Most states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly-used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat-testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (pilocarpine) to one electrode of an apparatus and running electric current to a separate electrode on the skin. This process, called iontophoresis, causes sweating; the sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts of sodium and chloride in their sweat. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.\n\nA multitude of tests are used to identify complications of CF and to monitor disease progression. X-rays and CAT scans are used to examine the lungs for signs of damage or infection. Examination of the sputum under a microscope is used to identify which bacteria are causing infection so that effective antibiotics can be given. Pulmonary function tests measure how well the lungs are functioning, and are used to measure the need for and response to antibiotic therapy. Blood tests can identify liver abnormalities, vitamin deficiencies, and the onset of diabetes. DEXA scans can screen for osteoporosis and testing for fecal elastase can help diagnose insufficient digestive enzymes.\n\nAs discussed above, cystic fibrosis occurs when there is a mutation in both copies of the CFTR gene. The protein created by this gene is anchored to the outer membrane of cells in the sweat glands, lungs, pancreas, and other affected organs. The protein spans this membrane and acts as a channel connecting the inner part of the cell (cytoplasm) to the surrounding fluid. In the airway this channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of chloride from inside to outside of the cell, however in the sweat ducts it facilitates the movement of chloride from the sweat into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not work, chloride is trapped inside the cells in the airway and outside in the skin. Because chloride is negatively charged, positively charged ions cross into the cell because they are affected by the electrical attraction of the chloride ions. Sodium is the most common ion in the extracellular space and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the salt, which is lost in high amounts in the sweat of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for the sweat test.\n\nHow this malfunction of cells in cystic fibrosis causes the clinical manifestations of CF is not well understood. One theory suggests that the lack of chloride exodus through the CFTR protein leads to the accumulation of more viscous, nutrient-rich mucus in the lungs that allows bacteria to hide from the body's immune system. Another theory proposes that the CFTR protein failure leads to a paradoxical increase in sodium and chloride uptake, which, by leading to increased water reabsorption, creates dehydrated and thick mucus. Yet another theory focuses on abnormal chloride movement out of the cell, which also leads to dehydration of mucus, pancreatic secretions, biliary secretions, etc. These theories all support the observation that the majority of the damage in CF is due to blockage of the narrow passages of affected organs with thickened secretions. These blockages lead to remodeling and infection in the lung, damage by accumulated digestive enzymes in the pancreas, blockage of the intestines by thick faeces, etc.\n\nB. CFTR\n\nThe CFTR gene is found at the q31.2 locus of chromosome 7, is 230,000 base pairs long, and creates a protein that is 1,480 amino acids long. The most common mutation, ÎF508 is a deletion (Î) of three nucleotides in exon 10 that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th (508) position on the protein. This mutation accounts for two-thirds of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, there are over 1,400 other mutations that can produce CF.\n\nThere are several mechanisms by which these mutations cause problems with the CFTR protein. ÎF508, for instance, creates a protein that does not fold normally and is degraded by the cell. Several mutations, which are common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, result in proteins that are too short because production is ended prematurely. Less common mutations produce proteins that do not use energy normally, do not allow chloride to cross the membrane appropriately, or are degraded at a faster rate than normal. Mutations may also lead to fewer copies of the CFTR protein being produced.\n\nStructurally, CFTR is a type of gene known as an ABC gene. Its protein possesses two ATP-hydrolyzing domains which allows the protein to use energy in the form of ATP. It also contains two domains comprising 6 alpha helices apiece, which allow the protein to cross the cell membrane. A regulatory binding site on the protein allows activation by phosphorylation, mainly by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The carboxyl terminal of the protein is anchored to the cytoskeleton by a PDZ domain interaction.\n\nReference to the human CFTR sequence is made by way of Genbank Accession No. NMâ000492 (SEQ ID NO:114 and 115) as well as SEQ ID NOS:1-2.\n\nIII. TREATMENT OF CF WITH ZFNS A. ZFNs Targeting Î508F\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides for the treatment of CF using particular ZFNs identified herein. These ZFNs target a region of the CFTR that is adjacent to (w/1100 base of) the Î508F mutation. Reference to exon 10 of the CFTR sequence is made in FIG. 10.\n\nB. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Routes of Administration\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of one or more ZFNs dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The phrases âpharmaceutical or pharmacologically acceptableâ refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, such as, for example, a human, as appropriate. The preparation of a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one ZFN, and optionally an additional active ingredient, will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, as exemplified by Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company (1990), incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, for animal (e.g., human) administration, it will be understood that preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biological Standards.\n\nAs used herein, âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, surfactants, antioxidants, preservatives (e.g., antibacterial agents, antifungal agents), isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, salts, preservatives, drugs, drug stabilizers, gels, binders, excipients, disintegration agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, dyes, such like materials and combinations thereof, as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, pp. 1289-1329, incorporated herein by reference). Except insofar as any conventional carrier is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated.\n\nThe ZFNs may be admixed with different types of carriers depending on how they are be administered. The present invention can be administered buccally, intravenously, intradermally, transdermally, intrathecally, intraarterially, intraperitoneally, intranasally, intravaginally, intrarectally, topically, intramuscularly, intratumorally, into tumor vasculature, subcutaneously, mucosally, orally, topically, locally, inhalation (e.g., aerosol inhalation), injection, infusion, continuous infusion, localized perfusion bathing target cells directly, via a catheter, via a lavage, in cremes, in lipid compositions (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes), or by other method or any combination of the forgoing as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). In particular, the ZFNs is formulated into a syringeable composition for use in intravenous administration.\n\nThe ZFNs may be formulated into a composition in a free base, neutral or salt form or ester. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, include the acid addition salts, e.g., those formed with the free amino groups of a proteinaceous composition, or which are formed with inorganic acids such as for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, fumaric, or mandelic acid. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides; or such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine or procaine. Upon formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective.\n\nFurther in accordance with the present invention, the composition of the present invention suitable for administration is provided in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with or without an inert diluent. A carrier should be assimilable and includes liquid, semi-solid, i.e., pastes, or solid carriers. Except insofar as any conventional media, agent, diluent or carrier is detrimental to the recipient or to the therapeutic effectiveness of the composition contained therein, its use in administrable composition for use in practicing the methods of the present invention is appropriate. Examples of carriers or diluents include fats, oils, water, saline solutions, lipids, liposomes, resins, binders, fillers and the like, or combinations thereof. The composition may also comprise various antioxidants to retard oxidation of one or more component. Additionally, the prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by preservatives such as various antibacterial and antifungal agents, including but not limited to parabens (e.g., methylparabens, propylparabens), chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal or combinations thereof.\n\nIn a specific embodiment of the present invention, the composition is combined or mixed thoroughly with a semi-solid or solid carrier. The mixing can be carried out in any convenient manner such as grinding. Stabilizing agents can be also added in the mixing process in order to protect the composition from loss of therapeutic activity, i.e., denaturation in the stomach. Examples of stabilizers for use in an the composition include buffers, amino acids such as glycine and lysine, carbohydrates such as dextrose, mannose, galactose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, sorbitol, mannitol, etc.\n\nIn further embodiments, the present invention may concern the use of a pharmaceutical lipid vehicle compositions that include ZFNs, one or more lipids, and an aqueous solvent. As used herein, the term âlipidâ will be defined to include any of a broad range of substances that is characteristically insoluble in water and extractable with an organic solvent. This broad class of compounds are well known to those of skill in the art, and as the term âlipidâ is used herein, it is not limited to any particular structure. Examples include compounds which contain long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives. A lipid may be naturally-occurring or synthetic (i.e., designed or produced by man). Lipids are well known in the art, and include for example, neutral fats, phospholipids, phosphoglycerides, steroids, terpenes, lysolipids, glycosphingolipids, glycolipids, sulphatides, lipids with ether and ester-linked fatty acids and polymerizable lipids, and combinations thereof.\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art would be familiar with the range of techniques that can be employed for dispersing a composition in a lipid vehicle. For example, the ZFNs may be dispersed in a solution containing a lipid, dissolved with a lipid, emulsified with a lipid, mixed with a lipid, combined with a lipid, covalently bonded to a lipid, contained as a suspension in a lipid, contained or complexed with a micelle or liposome, or otherwise associated with a lipid or lipid structure by any means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The dispersion may or may not result in the formation of liposomes.\n\nThe actual dosage amount of a composition of the present invention administered to an animal patient can be determined by physical and physiological factors such as body weight, severity of condition, the type of disease being treated, previous or concurrent therapeutic interventions, idiopathy of the patient and on the route of administration. Depending upon the dosage and the route of administration, the number of administrations of a preferred dosage and/or an effective amount may vary according to the response of the subject. The practitioner responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the concentration of active ingredient(s) in a composition and appropriate dose(s) for the individual subject.\n\nIn certain embodiments, ZFNs pharmaceutical compositions may comprise, for example, at least about 0.1% of the ZFN, about 0.5% of the ZFN, or about 1.0% of the ZFN. In other embodiments, the ZFN may comprise between about 2% to about 75% of the weight of the unit, or between about 25% to about 60%, for example, and any range derivable therein. Naturally, the amount of the ZFN in each therapeutically useful composition may be prepared is such a way that a suitable dosage will be obtained in any given unit dose of the compound. Factors such as solubility, bioavailability, biological half-life, route of administration, product shelf life, as well as other pharmacological considerations will be contemplated by one skilled in the art of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations, and as such, a variety of dosages and treatment regimens may be desirable.\n\nIn other non-limiting examples, a dose of a ZFN may also comprise from about 0.1 microgram/kg/body weight, about 0.2 microgram/kg/body weight, about 0.5 microgram/kg/body weight, about 1 microgram/kg/body weight, about 5 microgram/kg/body weight, about 10 microgram/kg/body weight, about 50 microgram/kg/body weight, about 100 microgram/kg/body weight, about 200 microgram/kg/body weight, about 350 microgram/kg/body weight, about 500 microgram/kg/body weight, about 1 milligram/kg/body weight, about 5 milligram/kg/body weight, about 10 milligram/kg/body weight, about 50 milligram/kg/body weight, about 100 milligram/kg/body weight, about 200 milligram/kg/body weight, about 350 milligram/kg/body weight, about 500 milligram/kg/body weight, to about 1000 mg/kg/body weight or more per administration, and any range derivable therein. In non-limiting examples of a derivable range from the numbers listed herein, a range of about 5 mg/kg/body weight to about 100 mg/kg/body weight, about 5 microgram/kg/body weight to about 500 milligram/kg/body weight, etc., can be administered, based on the numbers described above.\n\nIn particular embodiments of the present invention, the ZFNs are formulated to be administered via an alimentary route. Alimentary routes include all possible routes of administration in which the composition is in direct contact with the alimentary tract. Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be administered orally, buccally, rectally, or sublingually. As such, these compositions may be formulated with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard- or soft-shell gelatin capsule, or they may be compressed into tablets, or they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet.\n\nFor oral administration, the compositions of the present invention may alternatively be incorporated with one or more excipients in the form of a mouthwash, dentifrice, buccal tablet, oral spray, gel or sublingual orally-administered formulation. For example, a mouthwash may be prepared incorporating the active ingredient in the required amount in an appropriate solvent, such as a sodium borate solution (Dobell's Solution). Alternatively, the active ingredient may be incorporated into an oral solution such as one containing sodium borate, glycerin and potassium bicarbonate, or dispersed in a dentifrice, or added in a therapeutically-effective amount to a composition that may include water, binders, abrasives, flavoring agents, foaming agents, and humectants. Alternatively the compositions may be fashioned into a tablet, gel or solution form that may be placed under the tongue, along the gum line, brushed on to teeth surfaces, or otherwise dissolved in the mouth. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,074,674 and 6,270,750, both incorporated by reference, describe topical, sustained release compositions for periodontal procedures.\n\nIn further embodiments, ZFNs may be administered via a parenteral route. As used herein, the term âparenteralâ includes routes that bypass the alimentary tract. Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be administered for example, but not limited to intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneally. Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,468, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy injectability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (i.e., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\nFor parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, âRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciencesâ 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.\n\nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. A powdered composition is combined with a liquid carrier such as, e.g., water or a saline solution, with or without a stabilizing agent.\n\nOf particular relevance to the present invention is aerosol administration, also known as inhalation therapy, is the administration of ZFNs by an appropriate device that permits inhalation and absorption into the patient's lungs. Aerosol administration in itself is generally a safe practice, as long as the health care provider or user is well educated in its use. It is contraindicated in conditions where complete obstruction of the airway is present, as the administration route is completely blocked. Aerosol drug administration, or in some cases nebulized drug therapy, disperses drugs into the lungs or bronchial airways in the form of tiny dropletsâoften bound to water, oxygen, or another gaseous substance. Drugs are generally delivered by two means. The first is via a device called a nebulizer. The nebulizer is a mechanical pump (of which there are many types) that produces a fine mist in which the drug is dispersed via an appropriate nebulizer-compatible face mask. This fine mist is inhaled deep into the lungs for maximum effect. The second method of delivery is via a hand-held, nebulized aerosol device. These devices, also known as âpuffers,â use the effects of a pressurized gas to create and disperse the drug into a fine mist or spray, which is then inhaled. Both methods of aerosol inhalation are very effective when used correctly.\n\nC. Combination Therapies\n\nIn some aspects of the present invention, other agents may be used in combination with ZFNs to provide a more effective therapy for CF. More generally, these agents would be provided in a combined amount to produce or increase any of the effects discussed herein. This process may involve contacting a subject with both agents at the same time. This may be achieved by contacting the cell or subject with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both agents, or by contacting the cell or subject with two distinct compositions or formulations, at the same time, wherein one composition includes the intracellular Cathepsin L inhibitor and the other includes the second agent.\n\nAlternatively, one agent may precede or follow the other by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the agents are applied separately to the cell or subject, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the agents would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the cell or subject. In such instances, it is contemplated that one may contact the cell with both modalities within about 12-24 h of each other and, more preferably, within about 6-12 h of each other. In some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly, however, where several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations.\n\nVarious combinations may be employed, the ZFN is âAâ and the other agent is âBâ:\n\nA/B/A âB/A/B âB/B/A âA/A/B âA/B/B âB/A/A âA/B/B/B âB/A/B/B\n\nB/B/B/A B/B/A/B A/A/B/B A/B/A/B A/B/B/A B/B/A/A B/A/B/A B/A/A/B A/A/A/B B/A/A/A A/B/A/A A/A/B/A\n\nAdministration protocols and formulation of such agents will generally follow those of standard pharmaceutical drugs, as discussed further below.\n\nMany CF patients are on one or more antibiotics at all times, even when they are considered healthy, to suppress the infection as much as possible. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or there has been a noticeable decline in lung function. Antibiotics are usually chosen based on the results of a sputum analysis and the patient's past response. Many bacteria common in cystic fibrosis are resistant to multiple antibiotics and require weeks of treatment with intravenous antibiotics such as vancomycin, tobramycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent IV such as a PICC line or Port-a-Cath. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as tobramycin and colistin is often given for months at a time in order to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria. Inhaled therapy with the antibiotic aztreonam is also being developed and clinical trials have shown great promise. Oral antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or azithromycin are given to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection. Some individuals spend years between hospitalizations for antibiotics, whereas others require several antibiotic treatments each year.\n\nSeveral common antibiotics such as tobramycin and vancomycin can cause hearing loss, damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney problems with long-term use. In order to prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood are routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.\n\nSeveral mechanical techniques are used to dislodge sputum and encourage its expectoration. In the hospital setting, physical therapy is utilized; a therapist percusses an individual's chest with his or her hands several times a day. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the ThAIRapy Vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator (IPV). Newer methods such as Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, now integrate a cough assistance phase, as well as a vibration phase for dislodging secretions. Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation is also shown to provide a bridge to transplantation. These are portable and adapted for home use. Physiotherapy is essential to help manage an individuals chest on a long term basis, and can also teach techniques for the older child and teenager to manage themselves at home. Aerobic exercise is of great benefit to people with cystic fibrosis. Not only does exercise increase sputum clearance but it also improves cardiovascular and overall health.\n\nAerosolized medications that help loosen secretions include dornase alfa and hypertonic saline. Dornase is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down DNA in the sputum, thus decreasing its viscosity. N-Acetylcysteine may also decrease sputum viscosity, but research and experience have shown its benefits to be minimal. Albuterol and ipratropium bromide are inhaled to increase the size of the small airways by relaxing the surrounding muscles.\n\nAs lung disease worsens, breathing support from machines may become necessary. Individuals with CF may need to wear special masks at night that help push air into their lungs. These machines, known as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilators, help prevent low blood oxygen levels during sleep. BiPAP may also be used during physical therapy to improve sputum clearance. During severe illness, people with CF may need to have a tube placed in their throats (a procedure known as a tracheostomy) and their breathing supported by a ventilator.\n\nLung transplantation often becomes necessary for individuals with cystic fibrosis as lung function and exercise tolerance declines. Although single lung transplantation is possible in other diseases, individuals with CF must have both lungs replaced because the remaining lung would contain bacteria that could infect the transplanted lung. A pancreatic or liver transplant may be performed at the same time in order to alleviate liver disease and/or diabetes. Lung transplantation is considered when lung function approaches a point where it threatens survival or requires assistance from mechanical devices. This point is typically when lung function declines to approximately 20 to 30 percent, however the there is a small time frame when transplantation is feasible as the patient must be healthy enough to endure the procedure.\n\nIV.

In brief, zinc-finger libraries were constructed using cassette mutagenesis to randomize the recognition helix of one finger in a threefinger domain. âB2H selection strainsâ harboring the target nine by site were constructed as described (Thibodeau-Beganny and Joung, 2007). Zinc-finger pools were obtained using two selection steps: First, randomized library members were introduced into a B2H selection strain and plated on histidine-deficient selective media (NM media) containing 3-AT, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 enzyme. Surviving colonies were scraped and infected with M13K07 helper phage to rescue zinc-finger-encoding phagemids as infectious phage particles. Second, rescued phagemids were used to infect fresh B2H selection cells and plated on NM media containing 3-AT and streptomycin. 95 surviving colonies were picked and inoculated into a 96-well block for growth and plasmid DNA isolated to obtain the final finger pools (FIG. 1A).\n\nOPEN Selections.\n\nA detailed description of how OPEN selections were performed is provided in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. In brief, for each target site, PCR-mediated fusion was used to create phage-based libraries consisting of random combinations of three finger pools (FIG. 1B) expressed as fusions to a fragment of the Gal11P protein (FIG. 1C). OPEN selections were performed in two steps. First, B2H selection strain cells were infected with randomized zinc-finger phage library and then plated on NM media containing 3-AT and streptomycin. Surviving colonies were scraped and infected with M13K07 helper phage to rescue the zinc-finger-encoding phagemids as phage. In a second step, this enriched phage library was then used to re-infect fresh B2H selection strain cells which were then plated on NM media containing a gradient of 3-AT and streptomycin. For a small number of the OPEN selections, the inventors performed selections in a single step (see below).\n\nQuantitative Bacterial Two-Hybrid (B2H) Assays.\n\nZinc-finger-encoding plasmids identified from OPEN selections were co-transformed with an Î±-Gal4 expression plasmid into a âB2H reporter strainâ harboring a single copy bacterial plasmid with a target binding site positioned upstream of a weak promoter driving lacZ expression. B2H reporter strains were constructed as described (Wright et al., 2006). Î²-galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate as described (Thibodeau et al., 2004).\n\nHuman cell-based EGFP-disruption assay. Human 293.EGFP cells harbor an integrated retroviral construct which constitutively expresses a Î²-galactosidase-EGFP fusion protein (FIG. 2C). 50,000 transfected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry two and five days post-transfection to determine the percentage of EGFP-negative cells. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided student's t-test with unequal variance.\n\nCEL I Nuclease Assay for NHEJ-Mediated Mutation.\n\nFlp-In T-REx 293 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with ZFN expression plasmids and genomic DNA was isolated three days post-transfection. Limited-cycle PCR was performed with radiolabeled nucleotides and VEGF-A- or HoxB13-specific primers. PCR products were treated with CEL I nuclease and then separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a phosphorimaging screen. All experiments were performed a minimum of two times.\n\nGene Targeting Assays.\n\nHuman Flp-In T-REx 293 and K562 cells were transfected with ZFN expression plasmids and donor constructs and genomic DNA harvest three and four days post-transfection. Limited-cycle PCR was performed with radiolabeled nucleotides and VEGF-A- or IL2RÎ³-specific primers. PCR products digested with SalI (for VEGF-A) or BsrBI (for IL2RÎ³) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a phosphorimaging screen. Additional details and Southern blot assays are described below.\n\nTobacco Transformation and Assay for Mutations.\n\nThe transformation of tobacco protoplasts by electroporation was carried out as previously described (Wright et al., 2005). Protoplasts were allowed to recover and then selected for kanamycin resistance and regenerated into plantlets as previously described (Wright et al., 2005). DNA was prepared from tissue harvested from individual plantlets using the Epicentre MasterPure Plant leaf DNA Purification Kit. SuRA and SuRB alleles were amplified by PCR, gel purified, and sequenced to identify mutations (see Supplementary Experimental Procedures for additional details).\n\nSequencing of Modified Genomic Alleles.\n\nPCR products amplified from genomic DNA were cloned into the pCR4Blunt-TOPO plasmid using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformants and sequenced using primers as described in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.\n\nZFN Toxicity Assays.\n\nZFN expression vectors, donor templates, and plasmid pmaxGFP (Amaxa) were transfected into K562 cells. Cells were assayed for GFP expression at days 1 and 7 posttransfection using a FACScan cytometer and for gene targeting efficiencies at days 4 and 7 post-transfection using the limited-cycle PCR/restriction digest assay. Variant heterodimer FokI domains were constructed by introducing the â+â and âââ mutations previously described in Miller et al. (2007).\n\nFluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH).\n\nTwo-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 3:1 methanolacetic acid fixed cell lines using bacterial artificial chromosome clones RP11-710L16 (6p21.1; VEGFA) labeled in Spectrum Orange (Abbott-Vysis, Downer's Grove, Il.), or RP11-142P4 (14q31.1; copy number control) labeled in Spectrum Green using standard protocols. Images were captured using an Olympus BX61 fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera, and analysis was performed with Cytovision software (Applied Imaging, San Jose, Calif.).\n\nB2H Selection Media.\n\nNM medium has been previously described (Thibodeau-Beganny and Joung, 2007). NM/CCK medium plates contain 100 Î¼g/mL carbenicillin, 30 Î¼g/mL chloramphenicol, 30 Î¼g/mL kanamycin, and 1.5% Bacto-agar.\n\nConstruction of Zinc Finger Pools.\n\nAll master randomized zinc finger libraries were constructed in a standard framework consisting of three tandem repeats of the middle finger of the murine transcription factor Zif268 in which the recognition helix residues have been altered. For each library, recognition helix residues â1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were randomized using 24 codons (degenerate sequence 5â²VNS3â²) encoding 16 amino acids (excluding cysteine and the aromatics). The theoretical complexity of each library is therefore 246=Ë2Ã108 members.\n\nB2H selection strains each harbor: (1) a single copy episome bearing a target site of interest positioned upstream of a promoter which drives co-cistronic expression of two selectable markers (the yeast HIS3 gene and the bacterial aadA gene) and (2) a low copy number plasmid expressing the RNA polymerase Î±-subunit/yeast Gal4 hybrid protein (Î±-Gal4). Strains were constructed as previously described (Thibodeau-Beganny and Joung, 2007). The target binding site of each strain was verified by DNA sequencing.\n\nZinc finger pools were obtained using two selection steps. In a first step, 109 ampicillin-transducing units (ATU) of randomized zinc finger phage library were introduced into >3Ã109 B2H selection strain cells harboring a target subsite of interest. Transformed cells were plated on histidine-deficient NM/CCK medium plates containing 50 Î¼M isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and 10 mM 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 enzyme. After incubation for 24 hours at 37Â° C. followed by 18 hours at room temperature, surviving colonies were scraped from the plates and infected with M13K07 helper phage to rescue the zinc finger-encoding phagemids as infectious phage. In a second step, this enriched phage library was then used to re-infect fresh B2H selection strain cells and the resulting transformants plated on NM/CCK medium plates containing 50 Î¼M IPTG, 10 mM 3-AT, and 20 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. After incubation at 37Â° C. for 48 hours, the inventors inoculated 95 surviving colonies into individual wells of a 96-well block containing 1 ml of Terrific Broth and 50 Î¼g/ml carbenicillin. These cultures were grown overnight at 37Â° C. and then a 96-pin replicator was used to inoculate a second block of identical cultures. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% to all wells in the first block and this was stored at â80Â° C. The second block was grown overnight at 37Â° C. and then the 95 cultures were pooled together. Plasmid DNA encoding the finger pools was isolated from 10 ml of the pooled culture using a QIAgen miniprep kit and for most pools a small number of random clones were sequenced with primer OK61. For finger pools against nine subsites, sequencing revealed no strong consensus (i.e., the sequences were diverse and did not resemble one another), suggesting that selective pressure for those sites was relatively weak under the initial selection conditions. For these nine subsites, the second step of selections were repeated and plated on higher stringency plates to obtain sequences that more closely resembled one another. The higher stringency plates used were NM/CCK medium plates containing 50 Î¼M IPTG, 20 mM 3-AT, and 30 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (for seven subsites: F1 GAT, F2 GAC, F2 GAG, F2 GCG, F2 TGA, F2 TAG, and F2 GTT) or 50 Î¼M IPTG, 25 mM 3-AT, and 40 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (for two subsites: F2 GAA, F2 TGG).\n\nOPEN Selections.\n\nTo create libraries for use in OPEN selections, finger pools were amplified by PCR (FIG. 6). For each amplification, first five and then 20 cycles of PCR were performed using the following primers and annealing temperatures (primer names; initial annealing temp; final annealing temp): for finger 1: OK1424 and OK1425; 55Â° C.; 59Â° C., for finger 2: OK1426 and OK1427; 52Â° C.; 57Â° C., for finger 3: OK1428 and OK1429; 41Â° C.; 56Â° C.
