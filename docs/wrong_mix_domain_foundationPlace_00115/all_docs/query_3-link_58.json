In many respects, I actually welcome the idea of some form of joined up planning in terms of transport planning but it has to be fully joined up - decent bus priority, stopping the hollowing out of town centres in preference to car friendly out of town locations.\n\nTrue. There's a good example locally - Bletchley town centre is heading towards near abandonment (charity shops etc) as a large retail park development near the stadium is basically *becoming* Bletchley town centre, yet it is served only by the buses that would pass it anyway. Arguably moving Bletchley bus station there and rearranging routes to fit would have made sense - that's the kind of joined up thinking I would hope for. (You could never have located the development in the erstwhile town centre, it's just not big enough). Coupled to such development could have been a regeneration project to introduce some high quality residential development given the potential for this being near the station.\n\nIt's a means of mass cross subsidy so that the most lucrative routes are cash cows to fund a morass of unsustainable hobby horses\n\nI don't have an issue with cross subsidy used sensibly; it is after all already done e.g. within and between rail franchises.\n\nThe removal of links if only to act as feeders to support local rail and tram services as an over-riding principle (see forced interchange at Gateshead on the Metro 30 years ago)\n\nI think this sometimes makes sense and sometimes doesn't. I would hope for a pragmatic line on it.\n\nWasting of money on bureaucracy and administration\n\nPossibly.\n\nCommon sense being outweighed by political grandstanding - at worst, we end up with some flax haired populist demanding a new bus for Manchester (NB4M aka Mancunian) to reflect the unique challenges of the area!\n\nYes, this would be a bad idea. Though TfGM may well decide to standardise on a couple of distinctive bus designs for new orders across all operations, and why not? Before Bozza had even had his hair-brained (!) scheme, the Wright Eclipse Gemini's rounded windscreen was the distinctive \"face\" of London bus operations.\n\nexample:\n\n(poster of bus on London Bridge with \"Secure beneath the watchful eyes\" tagline - must admit that poster looks straight out of Scarfolk! )\n\nSpecifying a couple of standard designs is ok, but where does it stop? Insistence on moquette design, door location etc?\n\nI don't see a problem with a standardised moquette design, that and a common livery seems a very good idea. Operators could have their logo on the bus in addition in the same way they do in London. As for door location, that basically is standardised outside London, i.e. at the front only, entirely willingly by commercial companies!\n\nProbably no point doing it for existing buses, a window sticker along the lines of \"TfGM bus service; all valid TfGM tickets accepted\" with the M logo would do the job, but a different moquette and colour scheme doesn't cost extra on a new bus assuming you're not just going for factory white.\n\nI'm against cross subsidy for the very reason in that it royally cocked up the industry throughout the 1960s and 70s. You had good services that had ever increasing demands placed on them - the result was reduced investment and widening headways to prop up dead duck services that had once been justified but were dying on their a**e.\n\nI think your hope is misplaced - hope over experience!\n\nIt depends if we can bring in just a bit of German, Swiss or other European culture to make it *really* work. That culture has to point at \"a city public transport journey\", not \"a bus journey\", to get the real benefit from this. Even in London where the fares aren't properly integrated people use the network as a whole.\n\nI don't see a problem with a standardised moquette design, that and a common livery seems a very good idea.

Even in London where the fares aren't properly integrated people use the network as a whole.\n\nThe livery is, to be honest, neither here nor there.\n\nLook at the actual design and the impact. We see this in London with most operators leasing vehicles because they cannot be guaranteed to retain the work AND the specific requirements restrict the ability to cascade. That is reflected in leasing costs and so passed on to TfL - now imagine that is replicated but with a lesser number of vehicles to some arbitrary spec?\n\nI'd welcome more Swiss thinking especially if attached with Swiss funding. However, pure cross subsidy where Peter pays Paul is the fallacy of the average!\n\nI'm waiting for the MP for Crawley and Greater Friesland to join the debate....\n\nAs usual, the devil's in the detail.

You may dismiss this as wishful thinking; but TfGM do have detailed experience of franchising in respect of Metrolink; where continued rapid growth in passenger demand is a hard reality. There were a lot of people who argued that European light rail returns on investment could not be replicated in the UK (notably in the notoriously wrong-headed National Audit Office report of 2004) https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2004/04/0304518.pdf . I think the same will be found for buses; especially since TfGM may now offer the carrot of connection into tram and train services for bus ticket holders.\n\nKey aspects of my optimistic assessement;\n\n- there are large numbers of reluctant drivers in Greater Manchester; who will jump at the opportunity offered by a half-decent public transport alternative. This has been clearly apparent in respect of tram and train services for a decade or so; but the experience of the Leigh-Salford-Manchester busway has been in no way different. Services are packed; and most of the new riders say they could otherwise have travelled by car. The Busway is not operated as a franchise; but would clearly have been a great deal easier to do if it had. To get big increases in bus patronage; there has to be linked infrastructure and vehicle investment; and that is much easier to do with franchising. The big opportunities here are in longer trips (5km+) in respect of which current bus usage is tiny, and so current big operators do not tend to seek to offer attractive services.\n\n- the big operators deny it; but the configuration of their services and their ticketing and fare structures, are explicitly acting to suppress demand growth for stopping bus services. Almost all commercial routes are natural monopolies for one or another big operator; who therefore benefit from monopoly profits, and who apply predatory ticketing, pricing and timetabling against any attempt by smaller operators to compete. Monopoly business models always seek to under-serve the market (that is how monopoly profits come about), and buses are no exception to this economic rule. Take away the predatory strategies, and patronage will increase.\n\n- Underlying a franchised system is recognition of the fundamental distinction between the fare paid by the passenger to travel, and the compensation paid to the operator for providing a service. The deregulated market arbitrarily concatenates these two payment events - so the bus operator simply banks the fares paid on their buses; the designers of the deregulated system believing (wrongly) that this would enable competition within routes. But franchising offers an alternative route to competition (and hence the breaking-up of anti-social monopoly operations). In franchising the fares go to TfGM, operators put in bids for each route, specifying compensation payments expected - which may be greater of lesser per passenger than the levels of fare payment. Which potentially allows a much simpler fare structure for the passenger, full transferability of tickets around the system, and protection of smaller operators against predatory strategies.\n\nIt is no surprise that while the big operators (and their shills in the press) have been united in rubbishing franchising; the smaller operators are strongly in favour.\n\nClearly there are potential elephant traps:\n\n- the underlying impact on bus operations of traffic congestion remain to be tackled; potentially this may divert public effort and investment away from that goal.\n\n- there are large numbers of reluctant drivers in Greater Manchester; who will jump at the opportunity offered by a half-decent public transport alternative.

Any franchise system like this will benefit the larger operators who can put the bids on. (Theres only one operator for the tram system for example).\n\nAny bus service competes with cars and taxis.

The price isnt as much of an issue and franchising itself wont deliver any extra bus priorities.\n\nI'm not aware of smaller operators who are strongly in favour.

What there won't be, is a multiplicity of fares and tickets. Just as with tendering for subsidised routes currently, where it is noticeable that smaller operators have a much better chance of getting the business than they would of competing for commercial routes. Which is the point the article is making; cutting back terndered services is hitting the smaller operators; franchising is potentially their lifeline.\n\nBuses don't compete with cars at present, trams and train do; bus operators concentrate almost entirely on carless users, hence high price single fares, predatory weekly tickets, no through ticketing across operators, pay on board, frequent stops, infrequent (and unreliable) services. To compete with cars you need simple flat-rate single fares, no penalty for cross-operator travel, high frequency service, high reliability, pay in advance, limited stop, comfortable seating. One of the key messages from the Cambridgeshire and Leigh busways is that to grow demand from former car userss, buses need to be less directed towards the expectations of carless users. Crucially, current deregulated buses build in extra time penalties to users; as on competitive routes, passengers have to wait for the service for which their tickets are valid. In a franchise system you can always get on the firs bus that comes, without paying extra to do so; which reduces overall average transit time; which in turn is the big opportunity for buses to outperform car travel.\n\nIn respect of the busway, the current services are brilliant as a stand-alone offer; but their integration into the general transport network is sorely deficient. So, First run the busway from Leigh to Manchester, but Diamond operate the circular route around Atherton and Leigh. The Diamond buses don't stop at the First busway interchanges; and the First tickets cannot be used on Diamond buses. Equally, busway passengers connecting to trams in the city centre have to pay extra; and vice versa, tram passengers have to pay extra to use the busway from the city centre into the University. This is the basic economics of deregulated buses; each operator only benefits from the passengers that travel on their own buses, so no operator has an incentive to generate additonal demand for public transport as a whole. Franchising works the other way; growth in patronage on one public transport service increases the potential user base for all other services; so long as operators are able to capture usage (through GetMeThere cards ideally) they will be compensated for all passenger movements across the system. But they won't face predatory pricing; as all prices will be the same for the same trip irrespective of the modes and operators used.\n\nOn smaller operators and franchising\n\nhttp://hctgroup.org/about_us/dai_po...ing, or why bus operators need the Buses Bill\n\nThe whole idea of bus franchising is that operators compete for routes; so there can be a multiplcity of operators within one city.

Buses are commercial services.\n\nHowever, TfGM needs to do what many other areas of the country are doing, namely scrap bus subsidies, except to serve areas of significant population that would otherwise be cut off from any public transport services. Such areas (of which there will be few in a large conurbation) could be provided with an hourly Mon-Sat daytime service.\n\nNearly all subsidised evening and many subsidised Sunday bus services are merely carrying air and most should be withdrawn, except where a link is considered strategic. Even such routes are now being withdrawn by TfGM, e.g. there are now no evening bus services south of Parrs Wood to Cheadle and beyond."
