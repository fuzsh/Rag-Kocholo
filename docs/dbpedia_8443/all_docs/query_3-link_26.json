        "text": "The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest-ranking judicial body in the country and is recognized as the court of last resort in the United States. Currently, there are nine United States Supreme Court Justices on the highest court in the land.\n\nThe following student guide provides background information, including demographics, and speaks to the history of the Court and the Justices of the Court.\n\nJustices by State\n\nJustices by Gender\n\nJustices by Race/Ethnicity\n\nJustices by Longest Terms\n\nJustices Appointed by Presidents\n\nJustices by Religion\n\nJustices: Age of Appointment\n\nJustices: Universities Attended\n\nJustices: Historical Salaries\n\nJustices: Appointments By Decade\n\nWhat Types of Cases go to the U.S. Supreme Court?\n\nThe Supreme Court chooses which cases that it wants to hear and decide. The types of cases range vary from a variety of constitutional law matters to cases considered to be of high public importance. This includes cases regarding taxation, immigration, freedom of speech, defective products, personal injury, and criminal matters.\n\nMany cases involve employment law issues and matters involving discrimination. This includes discrimination based upon race, religion, and sexual orientation.\n\nCases in which the United States is a party often go to the Supreme Court. The same is for cases between different states or cases involving ambassadors.\n\nHow does Someone become a Supreme Court Justice?\n\nThere are a total of nine judges on the U.S. Supreme Court. When a position becomes open due to the death or resignation of a sitting judge, the President can appoint a person to the position. This is often a highly contested appointment because these judges can shape the law for the land for a very long time.\n\nMost of these appointments are political in nature, meaning the President chooses to appoint someone who will make decisions based upon political and ideological beliefs. As such, the bench is not always considered impartial, or fair, because there is often a political agenda behind a court ruling.\n\nAfter an appointment is made by the President, there are hearings in the Senate to approve the candidate for the position. If, after the hearing, the Senate confirms the appointment the new justice is sworn into office. It is a lifetime appointment and therefore very important to the separation of powers of our government.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Background Information\n\nThe Constitution states that the Supreme Court has both original and appellate jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction means that the Supreme Court is the first, and only, Court to hear a case.\n\nThe Constitution limits original jurisdiction cases to those involving disputes between the states or disputes arising among ambassadors and other high-ranking ministers.\n\nAppellate jurisdiction means that the Court has the authority to review the decisions of lower courts. Most of the cases the Supreme Court hears are appeals from lower courts.\n\nMany cases that the Court reviews concern the U.S. Constitution, and the Court’s decisions have far-reaching implications for the citizenry and the history of the United States.\n\nFew other courts in the world have the same authority of constitutional interpretation and none have exercised it for as long or with as much influence.\n\nWhat is the Total Number of Supreme Court Judges?\n\nThe Supreme Court has nine (9) Justices: one (1) Chief Justice and eight (8) Associate Justices.\n\nThere have been a total of 116 Justices as of July 2022.\n\nIn total, there have been 17 Chief Justices and 103 Associate Justices\n\nFive (5) judges have served as both chief and associate justice: John Rutledge, Edward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, William H. Rehnquist.\n\nWhich States Provide the Most Supreme Court Justices?\n\nHistorically, Supreme Court Justices have come from the following states:\n\nHow many Women have been Supreme Court Justices?\n\nTotal Number of Men vs. Total Number of Women\n\n*No woman has served as a U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nFirst Woman: Sandra Day O’Connor (1981-2006)\n\nOnly six women have served as Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS).
