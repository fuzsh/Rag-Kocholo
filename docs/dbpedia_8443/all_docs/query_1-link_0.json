        "text": "Following is a list of all Article III United States federal judges appointed by President Chester A. Arthur during his presidency.[1] In total Arthur appointed 21 Article III federal judges, including 2 Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States, 4 judges to the United States circuit courts, and 15 judges to the United States district courts. Arthur shared the appointment of Addison Brown with his predecessor, James A. Garfield, with Garfield placing him on the bench via a recess appointment and Arthur later nominating him to the same seat and issuing his commission. William White was confirmed by the United States Senate and received his commission from President Arthur, but died before taking the oath of office or commencing service. Nevertheless, he is counted as a successful appointment.\n\nArthur appointed 4 judges to the United States Court of Claims, an Article I tribunal.\n\nJustice Horace Gray, Arthur's first and longest serving appointee to the Supreme Court\n\nDavid Josiah Brewer, appointed to the Eighth Circuit Court by Arthur, was later elevated to the Supreme Court.\n\nUnited States Supreme Court justices\n\n[edit]\n\n# Justice Seat State Former justice Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Began\n\nactive service Ended\n\nactive service 1 2 Massachusetts December 19, 1881 December 20, 1881 December 20, 1881 September 15, 1902 2 1 New York March 13, 1882 March 22, 1882 March 22, 1882 July 7, 1893\n\nCircuit courts\n\n[edit]\n\n# Judge Circuit Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Began active\n\nservice Ended active\n\nservice 1 Second March 28, 1882 April 6, 1882 April 6, 1882[2] May 8, 1907 2 Eighth March 25, 1884 March 31, 1884 March 31, 1884 January 6, 1890[3] 3 First July 2, 1884 July 5, 1884 July 5, 1884[2] February 7, 1913[4] 4 Seventh December 3, 1884 December 9, 1884 October 28, 1884[5][2] March 3, 1893\n\nDistrict courts\n\n[edit]\n\n# Judge Court\n\n[Note 1] Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Began active\n\nservice Ended active\n\nservice 1 S.D.N.Y.
