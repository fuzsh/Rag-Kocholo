Also contains the number of parts, indicated by a two-digit number immediately following the code for the musical instruments or voices (e.g., va02, a two-part composition for Voices - Soprano). The function of the instrumentalist or vocalist is represented by the choice of subfield code. If the number of parts is not specified or cannot be determined, it may be omitted.\n\nGenerally, use field 048 for:\n\nWorks for which the medium of performance is stated explicitly or can be easily identified\n\nArrangements for specific instrumentation\n\nChamber music\n\nChoral works with or without soloists\n\nMusic for a specified large ensemble\n\nSolo instrumental music\n\nSongs with specified accompaniment\n\nDo not use field 048 for:\n\nWorks for which the medium is not stated explicitly in the item and cannot be inferred\n\nCollections of miscellaneous instrumentation\n\nFolk music\n\nFolk songs\n\nHymns and liturgical chants\n\nMusical comedies\n\nOperas and other large vocal works with unspecified instrumentation\n\nSchool songbooks without specified instrumentation\n\nSound recordings of popular music\n\nYou may also use field 382 to record medium of performance information in textual form.\n\nUse the following guidelines:\n\nArrangements are coded for the medium of the work being described, not for the original medium\n\nCodes are recorded in score order, if possible, listing soloists first\n\nIf a performer plays more than one instrument in a composition, code for the principal instrument if that can be determined.
