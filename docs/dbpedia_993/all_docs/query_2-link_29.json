Even though they were very different I found them both to be entertaining. Mozart's, Eine kleine Nachtmusik is a serenade and when I was listening to it I felt as if I was being serenaded.

Biography Of Ludwig Van Beethoven 's Symphonies Ludwig van Beethoven's nine symphonies are indispensable pieces of music and contributed to him being referred to as one of the most famous musicians in all of musical history. His symphonies are still played today and are recognized around the world. He is known as a symphonic master due to his nine symphonies. Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer during the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic eras. Beethoven's symphonies were greatly influenced by Haydn and Mozart in the beginning, but they showed remarkable signs of his individuality and eventually transformed into his own style. His life is categorized into three periods; early period, heroic period, and later period, in which his music had distinct characteristics in each of the time periods. His symphonies were first composed in a very classical style that stemmed from his mentors, to later develop into a more romantic style with his own personal touch to finally compose the music that he wanted, without thinking about the music he thought he was supposed to compose. The early period of Beethoven's life lasted approximately six years, from 1794 to 1800. This period began directly after Beethoven met the famous composer Franz Joseph Hayden and moved to Vienna to study with him for two years. Although the lessons with Hayden were not successful due to a personality conflict, Haydn greatly influenced Beethoven's early period. This period of his life encompassed smaller musical pieces ...

The first movement: Allegro begins with an orchestral statement of the main theme. Then the theme is repeated by the solo clarinet, creating a more desolate atmosphere. Eventually the music develops into a dramatic turn after a tutti, leading back to the main theme, where the Alberti bass and arpeggios for the solo clarinet are restated, then ending the movement in a relatively more joyful tutti in A major. The second movement: Adagio, written in ternary form ABA, begins with the solo clarinet playing the main theme of the concerto, with the orchestra restating the theme again. Although this movement starts with a tranquil feel, it develops into a more forceful, enthusiastic tone. Finally the third movement Rondo: Allegro has a happier refrain, but occasionally recalling the melancholy mood from the first movement, also creating quiet music, silence, which I felt were a big part of the musical piece. Overall, the Clarinet Concerto is best portrayed in Brian Robins' words \"valedictory and autumnal.\" Symphony No. 4 in D–minor, Op. 120, was originally composed and completed in 1841, but Schumann being unsatisfied with it, heavily revised the symphony and was later published in 1851.

Including Symphony No. 9, many of his musical works as a composer were created in the romantic period.

In general, music instruments which an orchestra use for this music are two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes and English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, and strings. In the early stage of the movement, loud minor sounds of string and woodwind instruments created feelings of magnificence and anxiety at the same time.

Which was led by musical director and conductor Peter Jaffe. In addition, his son James Jaffe, a renowned cellist, accompanied the ensemble with a beautiful solo performance. There are three pieces that are instrumented by the symphonic orchestra. The first piece is Dances from Cake Walk, by Hershy Kay. The second piece is Schelomo, Hebraic Rhapsody, by Ernest Bloch, and the third piece is Symphony No.9 in E minor, op.95, \"From the New World\" by Antonin Dvorak. All three of these pieces originated in the early 19th century. To begin with, Dances with Cakewalk by Hershy Kay is an orchestrated Broadway style repertoire, with integrated creole melodies and a minstrel song using Gottschalks music arranged originally for the New York City ballet. There are three different dances to this piece. The first dance \"Grand Walkaround\" opens with loud dynamics from the kettledrum, and woodwind instruments creating a grand entrance leading into a piano solo.

Beethoven's Ninth Symphony Essay Beethoven's Ninth Symphony I attended Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on October 14, at the Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth. The Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Miguel Harth–Bedoya and Southwestern Seminary Oratorio Chorus, directed by C. David Keith, performed it. Ludwig Van Beethoven composed the work. He composed it between 1811–1824. Beethoven composed the work in D minor, Op. 125 (\"Choral\"). His Ninth Symphony was his last symphony to compose. It was preceded by eight other symphonies. I was attracted to this work because it was the first symphony to include a choral. I found it astonishing that Beethoven was completely deaf when he finished this work. The first movement is in sonata form – Allegro ma ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Then follows a scherzo with trio – Molto vivace – also in D minor. The scherzo itself is in sonata form with all parts repeated. The octave tuned drums immediately announcing the important role they play in the tonality of the movement as a whole. Then follows a hushed fugato, which serves an introductory purpose as the full force of the orchestra. Then follows a more harmonic path with the utmost vigor. The second subject in C major adds an unusual harmonic flavor. The trio has a quasi– pastoral flavor, The trio is played only once, although Beethoven fools us into believing we will here it once more at the end, like in the first movement but it abruptly ends. The third movement – Adagio molto e cantabile – is quasi–variational similar and involves two themes: Adagio molto and Andante moderato. Both themes are of unsurpassed beauty. There is no link musically between the themes. Indeed it seems that contrast serves an important function in the movement as also seen in the two dramatic fanfares hear towards the end. The finally movement and my favorite of the four movements, Beethoven lets the cellos and basses 'talk' in a gruff recitative that passes judgment on the themes of the first three movements. The recitative then halts and slowly, out of this darkness, the 'joy' theme is heard. As the theme commences, the other instruments of the orchestra become involved and the theme is evolved into its ideal instrumental form. But what does ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n21.

The first movement is a very fast pace introduction with a catchy tune to it and involves a lot of staccato bouncing. The Andante is my favorite; it is so slow and soft. The melody in the first violins is so beautiful and peaceful. Next, the third movement is just the Menuetto and Trio, very small but a nice transition for the finale.

Analysis Of Beethoven's 9th Symphony For the second and final concert report, I listened to the performance of Beethoven's 9th symphony, as played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Beethoven lived in Germany during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and was an influential figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in western music. The performance requires a large number of instruments, with woodwinds, brass, percussion, strings, and even a choir during the 4th movement. The first movement of Beethoven's 9th is quick, driving forward and at times giving the feeling of rushed urgency, while maintaining a composed majesty beneath the surface. This is reflected in the original tempo marking of allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso, meaning literally \"quickly but not too fast, a little majestic\". The movement begins with a the strings playing intervals over a quiet string tremolo, reminiscent of an orchestra tuning themselves before a performance. This crescendos to a loud and bombastic introduction of the first movement's main theme and the introduction of the brass section. The first movement also makes heavy use of dynamic contrast, with large crescendos that swell in time with the music and diminuendos that quickly reign in the impressive power of the full symphony orchestra. The first movement also follows a traditional sonata form, with the main theme having variations throughout the roughly 18 minutes of play time.

The piece was published in 1801, during a period of great experimentation in Beethoven 's music. This can help explain how the piece addresses a broad range of emotions that vary from romance to frustration to anger. The first movement is full of all of those feelings and more, however it is the pianist who decides which of them will triumph over the rest. ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Kempff 's fidelity to Beethoven 's wishes makes this performance full of the majestic sensation that is associated with Beethoven 's music. Liberace was one of the most ingenious and eccentric American entertainers of the 20th century. He was best known for his creative interpretations of piano and vocal music as well the flamboyance present in his performances. One of Liberace 's versions of Moonlight Sonata is actually a mash–up between the first movement and the popular Broadway tune, Night and Day, written by Cole Porter in 1932. Overall, Night and Day is a love song with a joyful spirit. It is full of amorous melodic phrases that add the sincerity of the romance depicted in the lyrics, such as, \"Night and day, you are the one. ..Whether near to me or far, It 's no matter darling where you are, I think of you, Night and Day\". The first movement of the Moonlight Sonata can also be interpreted as filled with romance but unlike Night and Day, the romance is accompanied with struggle. Liberace pairs this happy kind of love song, with a piano piece that has dark, romantic qualities to create a sort or ultimate love piece that has both climatic love–filled moments and low points of misery. Unlike Kempff, in his version of the Moonlight Sonata, Liberace almost immediately pulls away from the original melody.

This part is fluttered with strings, winds, and, more importantly, high pitched notes that the choir must sign. Throughout the section, crescendos often happen, the dropping into soft melodies. The tempo for this section is adagio, similar to that of Introitus. Like Introitus, Lacrimosa shares the same meter signature as well as the same tone throughout. The singers build up into a fortissimo volume, and then drop into a piano tone. However, there are some differences to notice, such as the increased use of winds in Lacrimosa and the decreased use of brass instruments. Instead of focusing more on making a bold statement or emitting tones of melancholy, like Introitus, Lacrimosa provides a sense of conclusion to the symphony as well as to the theme of Requiem. This is what it succeeds in, thus, emitting a passive tone, despite the various crescendos. Although there are no diminuendos featured in Lacrimosa, the audience gets a sense of piano by the sudden drop in note.

Symphony Number 45 in F# Minor (the \"Farewell symphony\")... Symphony Number 45 in F# Minor (the \"Farewell symphony\") Between 1761 and 1790 Haydn was employed by the enormously wealthy Esterhazy family who had two palaces on the borders of Austria and Hungary. The court orchestra was similar to that of many baroque orchestras – two oboes, a bassoon, a string ensemble and a harpsichord. But it also included a pair of horns – instruments that became a regular part of the orchestra thereafter. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– It was this orchestra that accompanied operas in the palace theatre and played symphonies twice a week.

The presto is stormy, but the violent mood is restrained by its form. The major –mode serenity at the start of the Adagio is later tinged with minor–mode sadness and one of the strangest endings in symphonic music. Haydn's use of wind instruments is quite different from Bach's and shows how orchestration changed during the 18th century. Where Bach uses wind instruments to provide melodic lines within his contrapuntal textures, in this symphony Haydn uses them to add colour or weight to the string parts. In fact a performance of the presto on strings alone would make perfect sense. The oboes are used in two ways: they reinforce the violins in loud passages and provide sustained notes that bind the texture (eg bars 20–24) or give a reedy edge to discords (eg start of bars 25,27 and 29). Although printed on a separate stave in some scores the bassoon simply doubles the cello/bass part throughout the presto. Natural horns, like natural trumpets, could play only a limited number of notes. But by requiring the use of different crooks for the town horns Haydn is able to use a wider number of pitches that would otherwise have been possible. The horns' most important job is to provide harmonic glue for contrapuntal passages such as bars 20–24 of the finale, where the second horn doubles the first oboe pedal ...

The instruments that consisted in this specific ensemble were the oud– an instrument that belongs to the string family, the cello– an instrument also belonging to the string family, the qunan– an instrument consisting of mandols that also belongs to the string family, violins, the piano, flutes, and saxophones. The mixture of the different culture of music can be found in the instruments used in the ensemble rather than the music in itself. The ensemble consists of no conductor, only eye movement amongst the musicians and others to instruct each other when to go and when not to go. Everything was done through body language, with little to no guidance from anyone else, which is quite remarkable. To be focused on your music, notes, pace while being focused on ...

Besides the performance, the location of the concert was exceptional. The Bruno Walter Auditorium is a relatively small concert hall. According to its website, the auditorium can only accommodate an audience of 202. However, the Bruno Walter Auditorium has an empowering effect on the audience.

The Concert Of Mozart 's Concerto Symphony On Saturday April 16, 2016, I went with my fiancé to Jones Hall to see the Houston Symphony perform a classical concert. The concert consisted of two pieces. Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3 in G major and Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E major. The orchestra was conducted by Thomas Sondergard from Denmark. The concert lasted for about 2 hours with a 15 minute intermission. Although the concert started a little late, the first piece was Mozart's Concerto No. 3, which he composed when he was 19. The instruments played in this piece were 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 horns, and strings. The violin soloist was Karen Gomyo. There were 3 movements to this piece, and as I learned in class, this was definitely a classical concerto. The first movement is played Allegro in Sonata form. The mood of this movement was bright and cheerful. I liked how the orchestra accompanied the violin. In the second movement it was played Adagio. Because the movement was slower, the mood was a little more tranquil. I liked this movement, because you could hear the violin solo playing an octave higher than the orchestra. The third movement which was the finale, was played Rondeau Allegro. In this movement, I really enjoyed the playfulness of this movement. The violin solo was quite impressive. Overall, this entire piece was quite enjoyable, I really liked the playing back and forth with the solo and orchestra. The orchestra played in tune and everyone was definitely playing in rhythm and were well prepared. I ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n64.

I was familiar with the atmosphere of the concerts. I enjoyed the variety of pieces performed by the students. Each performer stood out because of their unique talent and had me engaged. I enjoyed both the vocal and instrumental pieces. I especially enjoyed the saxophone pieces because it was a contrast to what is normally played in class. I also enjoyed it because I found it relaxing. I enjoyed Gabrielle Johnson's performances, too. Her first song \"El tra la la y punteado\" by Granados was fun to watch because I did not think I would enjoy it. Johnson later performed \"I am\" by Jojo and the difference in her voice was fascinating. The other performer that had my attention the entire performance was Benz Marston. The way he played the cello was mesmerizing. I was so focused on his performance that I did not realize he did not use sheet music.

The performance contained two violinists, two violaists, and a cellist The concert began at 7:00 pm and ended around 8:10 pm. Furthermore, it was located in the Farrell Auditorium, which is in the Saint Louis Art Museum. At this concert, I listened to professional musicians that are a part of the St. Louis Symphony perform music that was composed by Felix Mendelssohn. Felix Mendelssohn's String Quintet No. 1 in A Major, Op. 18, and String Quintet No. 2 in B– Flat Major, Op. 87 are the two pieces the musicians played.

A couple minutes passed and they started performing String Quintet No. 2 in B– Flat Major, Op. 87. The four movements were Allegro vivace, Andante scherzando, Adagio e lento, and Allegro molto vivace. Overall the movements in this piece were smoother than the first piece. However, the movements in the second piece were still very lively. When the musicians started to play Allegro vivace, I noticed the lower notes. Furthermore, this movement was not as fast as the other movements in the first piece. The lower notes caused the movement to be more dramatic, and it reminded me of a rainstorm that eventually gets cleared up, but comes back. Everyone was playing the same notes during the end of this movement, and it was very loud. Andante scherzando was very different. The piece was normal paced, a little bit legato, with some staccato notes.There were tempo changes, but it was the most calming out of all the pieces. The cello stands out in this movement because the notes are legato until the cello begins to play staccato notes, and the other four players also play staccato notes. Similar to Intermezzo: Andante sostenuto, this piece also ends with soft bounces after an enormous build up in dynamics. Adagio e lento starts off within the lower register of notes and is also dramatic. The music reminded me of music that would play if ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n68. First Movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 Essay First movement of Beethoven's symphony No. 3 Eroica Beethoven's Symphony No.3 also known as the Eroica consists of four parts, namely, allegro con brio, adagio assai, scherzo and allegro, which is the standard structure of a symphony. In this work, the analysis focuses on the first movement so as to show how Beethoven enriched symphony. The first movement has a distinctive sonority and texture. It is considerably long as it takes about 14 minutes (it may depend on the version). Some complete symphonies from the classical period are about the same length as this first movement, so Beethoven's work set aside from the traditional symphony. It tells other composers that there is no such thing as a standard length of symphony's movement. In ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The resonant sound of brass generates some tension in the form of dissonant chords. The combination of unusual sounds, vivid dynamics and rhythm changes, are incorporated in the symphony by Beethoven. However there is more as the first movement goes on. Beethoven uses a minor key for a short passage. The agitated sound of strings adds some tension and drama in the movement, which is finally resolved by the woodwinds. The clarinet and flute return music to a major key and a state of calm. The minor passage is a new concept which stands out the traditional symphony. It adds a different texture that clearly departs from the leading motive. This brief minor passage is also repeated so it may be thought of as a second motive. Another striking quality of this first movement is the use of a set of chords played by the whole orchestra. It serves as a bridge to connect the major and minor motives. Towards the end of the first movement, there is a brief passage embellished by the strings while the horns and trumpets remind us the sounds of the leading motive. The lively sound is interrupted by a brief minor passage. Then, the leading motive is repeated by the clarinet and flute. Strong and bright sounds prepare the audience to the conclusion of the first movement. One can conclude that Beethoven's unique expressiveness and passion are reflected in every note of the Eroica's first ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n70. Adagio Plucking The beginning of the piece starts at a mezzo forte and varied a little. The string instruments had the melody most of the time. The mood of the section was calm with the approach of danger. It was sneaking up on unsuspecting people. It made me feel like I was experiencing the aftermath of Star Wars. Even if they had won the dark side would always come back. In Adagio, the tempo picked up to match a vivace feel. It had the mood of anticipation. Quite like knowing that a battle must be fought but there is no idea as to when, but they'll still be prepared. The melody repeated a lot with different alterations. Moderato used plucking to enhance the sound. The flutes and cellos created a deeper sound of peace. The plucking was at a moderate tempo ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n72.

It started with a rather slow tempo that had a call and answer type of theme, with the call part being more loud and dramatic while the answer was soft and then after a part that flowed without the call and answer theme, it was vice versa– so the call part was soft and the answer was louder and more dramatic. This movement faded out and into a slightly more fast paced part, however it wasn't the end of that movement because it wasn't a complete stop. The second movement was quicker and much shorter than the first movement. The third movement was very similar to the first, in that it was a little slow and has very short pauses that fade into a different paced part of the same movement. This movement had variations to the first theme and had a short harpsichord solo. The fourth movement, Menuetto alternativo– trio had a faster pace and sounded like a non imitative polyphony with the violins and viola as the main melody and the cello and harpsichord as the second melody at most times and as the background accompaniment at other times. The last movement was much louder, more dramatic and more lively than the rest of the movements.This movement had multiple parts that sounded were crescendo and then decrescendo. They finished the song with crescendo and it was a very dramatic ending. Most of the movements in this piece were played by the strings, and the harpsichord was rarely heard because the strings overpowered it and were much louder than the ...

Franz Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) was an Austrian composer who began his career in the traditional patronage system of the late Austrian Baroque and ended as a free artist within the burgeoning Romanticism of the early 19th century. He was one of the most celebrated composers of his time and a culture hero throughout Europe. He is familiarly known as the \"father of the symphony\". Beethoven (1770–1827) was a German composer and a pupil of Haydn's. His early achievements show him extending the Viennese classical tradition inherited from Haydn and Mozart but his later work was composed in an increasingly individual musical style. ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... As the father of the four movement form of the classical period, is was no surprise that his Farewell Symphony included the Allegro assai, Adagio, menuet and trio, and the finale–Presto movements. The symphony has an unusual and complex tonal scheme, involving three different structural tonics, F–sharp minor, A major, and F–sharp major; the double finale incorporates all three. The F–sharp minor projects something inherently unstable which demands, and receives resolution by the tonic major, which is gradual, complex and a systematic change from instability to stability. This process involves all aspects of the music including tonality, rhythm, form, instrumentation, dynamics and psychological content. Beethoven also uses a four movement form but includes Allegro, Scherzo, Adagio and Presto–Allegro. The formal structure of the movements, while generally adhering to the Classical models, charted new territory. The first movement, although in Classical sonata form, confounds listeners first by rising to a fortissimo climax in the harmonically unstable exposition section and then by delaying a return to the home key. The scherzo is placed as the second movement, rather than the customary third, and the third movement is a mostly restful, almost prayerful adagio. The last movement builds from a gentle beginning into a brazen finale, while recalling some of the themes from earlier movements and once the \"Ode ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ..."
