Because of that, we don’t recommend using a METRO Day Pass on Park & Ride service.\n\nYou may park in the parking lot of the facility where you’re boarding a Park & Ride bus. Lots are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nIf you plan to park for three consecutive days, you must contact the METRO Police Department to make a request in advance.

Brochures are available for free at all METRO RideStore locations:\n\nDowntown Transit Center - 1900 Main St.\n\nFannin South Transit Center - 1604 West Bellfort St.\n\nMain Street Square - 1001 Travis St.\n\nNorthwest Transit Center - 7373 Old Katy Road\n\nRoute Alerts or detours could affect your vehicle’s arrival time and/or the length of your trip. Subscribing to receive this information is a convenient way to know before you go.\n\nOn the METRO website, you can subscribe to receive notifications direct to your phone or email for the bus, rail, METRORapid and/or METRO curb2curb routes of your choice.\n\nThe quickest and easiest signup option can be found on each individual route page.\n\nIf you prefer, there’s also a Get Text and Email Alerts page where you can subscribe to multiple routes simultaneously.\n\nAll subscriptions are free and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIf you don’t wish to subscribe, you can use any of the following:\n\nRoutes and Schedules tab on METRO website home page - it will transport you to your route page. If there are any active alerts, a link to view them will be visible near the top of the page.\n\nRideMETRO app (a red triangular icon will appear on the screen if your selected route is experiencing a service alert)\n\nYou can also use our Trip Planner which is available on:\n\nVarious pages of the METRO website, including the home page\n\nRideMETRO app for your smartphone\n\nGoogle or Apple maps\n\nMETRO offers a rider tool called Next Bus Texting. To use it, you'll need to know your stop number. It's posted on the bus stop sign at every bus stop location. Just text that stop number to 697433.

Transit centers are sheltered waiting areas where you can transfer to other METRO routes and services that provide access to even more destinations. They’re often found at the beginning or end of a bus route.\n\nThese digitally displayed passenger information enhancements are part of the METRONext Moving Forward Plan, to create a better customer experience.\n\nYou can access METRO Park & Ride buses throughout the region at:\n\nMore than 25 Park & Ride lots\n\nSelect METRO transit centers\n\nIf you don’t require assistance, enter through the front doors, pay your fare and choose an open seat. Please avoid sitting in the priority seating areas for the elderly and people with disabilities, marked by the International Symbol of Access (Wheelchair Symbol).\n\nIf you’re using a wheelchair, mobility scooter, or walker, wait for the operator to activate an accessible ramp which will allow you easy access through the front doors.
