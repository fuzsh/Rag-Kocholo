        "text": "A native grass prairie restoration project, near the dam, is representative of what \"The Barrens\" looked like to early pioneers.\n\nAnglers, boaters and campers are only the most recent people to enjoy the beauty and natural resources of the Barren River Region. As early as 12,000 B.C., Native Americans fished, boated, and lived along the river's floodplain and terraces, and on the bluffs overlooking it. These people lived in small groups that moved often. Around 1,000 B.C. they moved more into farming and built more permanent settlements. By A.D. 900 farming was a way of life and archeologists refer to these farmers as the Mississippians.\n\nNative Americans periodically burned off parts of this region, to provide grasslands that were attractive to grazing buffalo. Thus, this area without trees, appeared to be \"barren.\" This area then came to be known as \"The Barrens\" to early pioneers that came to this area in the 1700s to settle and live.\n\nThe counties of Barren, Allen and Monroe were formerly part of Green and Warren counties and were established around 1797. Originally the entire territory had been set aside for military service grants for veterans of the Revolutionary War.\n\nPort Oliver, near the dam, was formerly called Port Oliver Ford, and was the site of a brine-well field for producing table salt. Baileys Point Recreation Area was the site of an antebellum farmhouse, built by early settlers to the area, named Foster. A family cemetery remains with gravestones and stone vaults that date back to the early 1800s.\n\nFee Boundary\n\nBarren River Lake has approximately 140 miles of fee boundary line (often referred to as the “red line”) surrounding 10,106 acres of government land. The government property line is marked by a series of survey points (t-bars or concrete/brass markers) that are further marked by steel locator posts. The government property line is a straight line between these survey points. Trees between these points are marked with white/red boundary marker signs. The boundary line does not always follow a specific elevation. It’s possible that recorded plats of private property do not agree with the true boundary line at Barren River Lake. To prevent encroachments, we recommend that adjacent property buyers contract the services of a licensed surveyor prior to purchase, and that current owners contract the services of a licensed surveyor prior to any construction. Any discrepancies must be resolved prior to any construction activities on any land in question. Any encroachments onto lands owned in fee by the United States are subject to collateral citations, which can result in a fine not to exceed $5,000 and/or up to six months in jail (Title 36 - Regulation Governing Use of Federal Property), and the responsible party will be required to remove the encroaching structure. Questions and requests for assistance should be made to the project office.\n\nFlowage Easement\n\nIn addition to fee property, the Corps of Engineers has also purchased flowage easements on 4,561 acres around Barren River Lake using the ground elevation of 596 as an acquisition guide. These easements were purchased for the temporary storage of flood water during periods of high rainfall. Because of the potential for flooding, allowable improvements to property with flowage easement restrictions are limited. Vegetation alteration (mowing, agriculture, timber harvesting, etc.) is allowed under the flowage easement restrictions. Structures not intended for human habitation are allowed only after written permission in the form of a Consent to Easement has been obtained from the Corps of Engineers. Septic systems and structures intended for human habitation are prohibited on land encumbered with a flowage easement.\n\nThe boundary line of flowage easement property (often referred to as the “yellow line”) is not marked by the goverment. Legal descriptions of acquired flowage easements are contained in the Government’s acquisition documents recorded in the County Clerk’s Office, and should appear as an encumbrance against the property during a title search. Some information on the boundary of flowage easement property is available at the Barren River Lake project office. To locate the boundary line on any affected property, however, the Corps of Engineers recommends that landowners obtain the services of a licensed surveyor. Encroachments on land encumbered by a flowage easement are violations of legal restrictions on the property and are subject to litigation. They also constitute a title defect which may affect the future sale of the landowner’s property, and the Government cannot assist landowners in the resolution of title defects. Before doing any type of construction or landscaping near the yellow line, contact the project office and speak with a Park Ranger.\n\nFor questions about the fee or flowage easement boundary line at Barren River Lake, contact the Barren River Lake project office. An appointment with a Corps Ranger can be scheduled to assist with answering any questions.\n\nLicenses and Permits\n\nLandowners in subdivisions adjacent to Barren River Lake may be eligible to apply for a license or permit to conduct certain activities on government property, including placement of a boat dock, construction of stairs or steps, construction of a pathway (improved or unimproved), vegetation alteration (mowing), construction of roads, turnarounds, parking areas, boat ramps, and installation of fish attractors. Once placed on government property, these improvements are considered public facilities and adjacent landowners cannot restrict the public’s use of the facilities. Restrictions apply as to where on the lake these activities may take place. For additional information, call the Barren River Lake project office. Additional information is also available on the district Shoreline Management web page.\n\nBoating\n\nBoating opportunities abound at Barren River Lake. Boat ramps are conveniently located in each recreation area and there are also three four service marinas to satisfy needs. These marinas provide boat rental, slip rental, gasoline and grocery items.\n\nThere are eight boat ramps on the lake and one located below the dam on Barren River. The Corps of Engineers charges a day use fee to launch boats, except for Austin, Browns Ford, Walnut Creek, Tailwater, and the State Park boat ramps. Fees are $5 per day and can be paid at the self-service fee box at the boat ramp or purchase an annual day use pass for $40 per year at any Corps of Engineers Office.\n\nDepending upon the discharge rate, below the dam, there are excellent opportunities for canoeing and fishing on Barren River. A boat ramp is located in the campground at Tailwater Recreation Area, just below the dam, off State Highway 252. Call the Barren River Lake Information Line, (270) 646-2122, which is updated daily at 7 a.m. Central, for discharge rates and river levels.\n\nCamping\n\nClass A Corps of Engineers Campgrounds includes Baileys Point, The Narrows and Tailwater. To make reservations for these three campgrounds, see below. The Narrows and Baileys Point are located on the main body of the lake, with Tailwater located just below the dam, on Barren River.\n\nAll three campgrounds have a wide range of amenities which include on-site park attendants, individual water hook-ups, electrical hookups, shower houses, playgrounds, horseshoe pits, volleyball area, hiking trails and nearby swimming areas. Each campsite has a fire ring/cooking grill, table and lantern holder. The Narrows and Baileys Point have washers and dryers available as well as ice and firewood. The Narrows also has a full-service Marina within walking distance. Baileys Point has a concession store with a limited supply of groceries and camping supplies available.\n\nFor the more primitive camper, Beaver Creek campground is available. There are 12 sites with no electric, two water stations, a swimming beach and a vault toilet available.\n\nLoop closures for 2022 Recreation Season\n\nBailey's Point Campground 2022 Calendar\n\nTailwater Campground 2022 Calendar\n\nFishing\n\nFishing opportunities abound at Barren River Lake.

Boat ramps are conveniently located at all recreation areas and include Peninsula, Barren River Lake State Resort Park, The Narrows, Beaver Creek, Baileys Point, Walnut Creek, Austin and Browns Ford.\n\nFishing Piers\n\nFishing is one of the main attractions at Barren River Lake and for those who don’t own a boat, or prefer fishing from the shoreline, there are three fishing piers around the lake and a boardwalk at Port Oliver to choose from. Two of these piers are located at the Quarry Road Recreation Area located at the dam off State Highway 252 in Barren County. Choose the main lake to fish from or a more quiet location in a small pond adjacent to the parking lot. The third location is located below Lucas, Ky., at the end of South Lucas Road on Peter Creek. From U.S. 31 East take State Highway 1318 west and turn left at the stop sign onto South Lucas Road. Port Oliver has 2,400 feet of ADA accessible boardwalk with numerous locations from which to fish and dock one's boat, as well as nine lakeside picnic sites.\n\nRiver Fishing\n\nRiver fishing, below the dam, offers the opportunity to catch muskie, catfish and also hybrid and striped bass. A boat ramp is located in the Tailwater Campground.\n\nFishing Tournaments\n\nAll tournaments taking place at a Corps of Engineer operated ramp at Barren River Lake require the issuance of a special event permit. You may obtain a permit by contacting the project office at 270-646-2055. Also, click the link below while planning for, or registering a fishing tournament. This voluntary registration will help organizers and participants choose a part of the lake that may be less congested.\n\nKY Fish & Wildlife Fishing Tournament Schedule\n\nPicnic Shelters\n\nPicnic sites with picnic tables and bathroom facilities are available at all recreation areas except for Peninsula, Austin and Browns Ford.\n\nThere are four Corps of Engineer maintained picnic shelters available for reservation mid-April to mid-September. Baileys Point picnic shelter is available until mid-October. During the off-season picnic shelters are on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nPicnic Shelter Reservations\n\nYou can reserve the picnic shelters, by calling the Barren River Lake Project Office at 270-646-2055.\n\nThe fee for the picnic shelter is $50.

The Port Oliver Picnic Shelter is available for rent only in conjunction with the amphitheater for a total fee of $150 per day.\n\nYou may reserve these facilities by calling the Barren River Lake Project Office at 270-646-2055.\n\nSwimming\n\nThere is no lifeguard service at Corps beaches -- swim at one's own risk. Always use the \"Buddy System\" -- don't swim alone.\n\nSwimming, wading, snorkeling, or scuba diving at one's own risk is permitted, except at boat launching sites, designated mooring points and public docks, or other areas so designated by the District Commander.\n\nCorps Beaches\n\nThe designated Corps swimming beaches at Barren River Lake are at Beaver Creek Recreation Area and Quarry Road Recreation Area. Quarry Road Beach, located near the dam, is the largest of the two beaches. Both beaches are routinely maintained and sanded. Quarry Road beach has a gate attendant that collects fees Memorial Day through Labor Day. The day-use fee is $2 per person, with a maximum of $5 per carload.\n\nDepth markers and deep water buoy lines are provided. However, remember Corps beaches do not have lifguards and swimmers swim at their own risk.\n\n2022 Recreation Season\n\nThe events for the year are as follows:\n\nBarren County Ecology Meet, TBD, Fall 2022\n\nThe Barren County Ecology Meet provides the sixth grade students from Glasgow and Barren County with hands-on knowledge about our environment and how we can protect it for future generations. The stations are provided by federal, state, and private organizations dedicated to the protection of our land, air and water.\n\nAllen County Ecology Meet, TBD, Spring 2022\n\nThe Allen County Ecology Meet provides the sixth grade students from Allen County and Scottsville, Kentucky with hands-on knowledge about our environment and how we can protect it for future generations. The stations are provided by federal, state, and private organizations dedicated to the protection of our land, air and water.\n\nNational Safe Boating Week, May 21-27, 2022\n\nThe Corps of Engineers would like to take this opportunity to wish everyone a safe and enjoyable summer. Those who own boats should have a boater’s check list to use as a guide to ensure a safe trip when using their boats this summer. With increasing amounts of boat traffic on the water, people should be aware of the current laws affecting boat operation on Kentucky waters. The crrent Kentucky Sport Fishing and Boating Guide contains information that all boaters should know, required equipment, age restrictions, proper operation procedures and more. Swimmers should be aware of boaters on the water and hazards in the lake and swim where they know it is safe, at a swimming beach. Public beaches are located at the State Park, Quarry Road, and Beaver Creek. Certain areas on the lake that look appealing to swim are actually hazardous to the user for what lies beneath the surface of the water.\n\nGlasgow Highland Games\n\nAn annual Scottish Games and Festival based in Glasgow Kentucky. Games are held the first weekend after Memorial Day at Barren Lake River State Park in Lucas, Kentucky.\n\nScout Celebration, August 2022\n\nGreetings to all Scouts!
