That means each state gets at least 3 electors – although more populous states have many more\n\nMost states give all their electoral votes to the person who wins the popular vote in that state, except for Maine and Nebraska, which split some of their electoral votes.\n\nWhoever wins enough states with enough electoral votes to cross the 270 threshold becomes the next president."
