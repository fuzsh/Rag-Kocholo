        "text": "I've been waiting for my camping trip to Trona Pinnacles this weekend to use the 270 awning. We ended up having a 15mph gust of wind come late afternoon into the night. The awning held its own without being staked down but I didn't want to push my luck and finally staked them down. The entire family was grateful and appreciative for the shade in the hot Mojave Desert. Definitely worth the investment if you are considering one.\n\nLove the covered space this awning provides, especially the more squared off area at the rear instead of the angled design most awnings have. I mounted it up and used it 2 days later and it just happened to rain most of the evening. I was thankful to have the covered area to be able to cook on the tailgate of my Tacoma. Deployment and putting it away are super easy and quick. Glad I made the investment! Only flaw was that the box was damaged in shipping which put two pinholes in the cover.\n\nInstall was simple and fast. Deployment is quick and easy. I haven’t used it in the bush yet but can’t wait to try it out. I see the awning room in my future…\n\nAbsolutely in love with my new awning! I chose the passenger side awning since we’re not always camping its nice to pull off the path and still have a little privacy (hiding behind the truck) from the rest of the off road traffic. Literally all you have to do is unzip it swing it around and secure it to the rooftop tent or the rack and you’re done, no poles, straps or ratchets to worry about. Don’t waste your time with any others, well worth the money!"
