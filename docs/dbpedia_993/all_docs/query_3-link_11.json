        "text": "This article is about the TV version of the theme. You may be looking for the full version of the theme.\n\n\"Phineas and Ferb Theme\" is the ska-rock theme song for Phineas and Ferb, performed by the band Bowling For Soup. First heard in the pilot episode \"Rollercoaster\", the music mainly accompanies an introductory cinematic describing the plausible summer hijinks of Phineas and Ferb. Various renditions have been composed to fit unique occasions, often related to holiday festivities and real events with special participations by the boys and their friends. An extended version is spotlighted in the inceptive album. In 2008, it was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music.\n\nExceptions to the regular opening number occur in \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation!\", \"Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!\", \"That's the Spirit\", \"The Curse of Candace\", Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, \"For Your Ice Only\", \"Happy New Year!\", \"Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel\", \"Phineas and Ferb Save Summer\", \"Night of the Living Pharmacists\", \"Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars\", \"Last Day of Summer\", \"O.W.C.A. Files\", and Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nIn Season 1, at the end of the song, the images are taken from the Original Pitch pictures, depicting some of the pictures of the boys' contraptions in the future episodes. Although not all of the contraptions in the Original Pitch are seen in Season 1 yet, the pictures depict images of contraptions/events from \"Rollercoaster\"/\"Rollercoaster: the Musical!\", \"The Fast and the Phineas\", \"Sleepwalk Surprise\", \"Are You My Mummy?\", \"Swiss Family Phineas\", and \"Toy to the World\".\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nIn Season 2, at the end of the song, the images from the Original Pitch are changed to images of Phineas and Ferb in Season 1. In order, these scenes are taken from \"Leave the Busting to Us!\", \"The Fast and the Phineas\", \"Rollercoaster\", \"Greece Lightning\", \"Out to Launch\", \"Flop Starz\", \"Mom's Birthday\", and \"S'Winter\".\n\nAs of the second-season episode \"Don't Even Blink\", when the song gets to the \"like maybe\" part, Phineas' smile broadens as the camera zooms in. Before that, he has a neutral expression on his face.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nIn Season 3 at the end of the song, images from Season 1 are changed to images from Season 2 which were taken from \"Phineas and Ferb: Summer Belongs to You!\", \"Ain't No Kiddie Ride\", \"Spa Day\", \"Tip of the Day\", \"Wizard of Odd\", \"Hide and Seek\", \"The Baljeatles\", and \"Atlantis\".\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nIn Season 4 at the end of the song, images from Season 2 are changed to images from Season 3 which were taken from Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, \"Doof Dynasty\", \"Moon Farm\", \"The Remains of the Platypus\", \"Escape from Phineas Tower\", \"Tri-Stone Area\", \"Excaliferb\", and \"Bully Bromance Breakup\".\n\n\"Doof 101\"[]\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"Doof 101\", Dr. Doofenshmirtz sings a line of the theme song with altered lyrics.\n\nDoof: There's 261 days 'til next summer vacation\n\n\"Last Day of Summer\"[]\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"Last Day of Summer\", one lyric from this song is altered and can be heard as part of the song \"Curtain Call/Time Spent Together\".\n\nPhineas and the cast: There's been 104 days of summer vacation. We've had a lot of fun, and sung a lot of songs. So we think it's time for a big celebration. And it's been a great summer, so we thank you for comin' along!\n\nWinter Vacation[]\n\nMain article: Winter Vacation\n\nLittle League World Series[]\n\nIn 2011, the song was adapted by Disney sibling networks ESPN and ABC for the Little League World Series.\n\nThere's limited days left in summer vacation\n\nand we figured out how to spend them\n\nThe Little League World Series\n\nin Williamsport, PA\n\nto try and get on ESPN\n\nLike maybe...\n\nHitting a home run\n\nor throwing a Ferb ball\n\nor making the crowd do the wave!\n\nBlowing a bubble while stealing a base\n\nDoofenshmirtz: Safe!\n\nOr giving Dugout a quick shave!\n\nTurning double plays\n\ncreating rally caps\n\nor eating a hot dog at bat\n\nDoofenshmirtz: Ball 4!\n\nGiving base running signs\n\nmaking a perfect bunt\n\nor catching a ball with a hat!\n\nBrent Musburger: Amazing!\n\nA worldwide pool of teams have come here to play\n\nand they're tryin' to win it all!\n\nESPN and Phineas and Ferb are ready to play ball!\n\nESPN and Phineas and Ferb are ready to play ball!\n\nUmpire: Play ball!\n\nCandace: Mom! Phineas and Ferb are taking over the Little League World Series again!\n\nHalloween Variations[]\n\nFor the 2011 Halloween specials \"That's the Spirit\" and \"The Curse of Candace\", the original song was used, but the ending of the title sequence was changed as follows:\n\nNew background images during Phineas and Ferb's dance with spiders coming down on a silk thread, a hand reaching out of the ground next to a grave, and Doonkelberry Bats flying.\n\nThe \"fly-by\" pictures include scenes from \"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\" and \"One Good Scare Ought to Do It!\", along with a production/concept picture for \"Are You My Mummy?\"\n\nCandace complains, \"Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a Halloween special!\"\n\nA theremin is heard in the last few bars over the song and over Candace's line.\n\nFor the 2013 Halloween episodes \"Druselsteinoween\", \"Face Your Fear\", and \"Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror\", the theme song was rethemed for Halloween. The following changes were made:\n\nSome ghoulish music is added.\n\nFemale background vocals going, \"Wah-wah-oooh\" like in \"Monster Mash\" by Bobby (Boris) Pickett and the Crypt Keepers.\n\nMany scenes are dimmed to give off the appearance that they take place at night.\n\nThe sun is replaced with a live-action moon.\n\nA spooky voice says, \"Like maybe...\"\n\nA skeleton is seen behind Ferb on the rocket.\n\nThe unicorn-turtle is replaced by a goblin wearing a sorcerer hat behind a tombstone.\n\nThe monkey is replaced by a skeleton.\n\nAnother skeleton is seen behind Ferb in the garage when they create nanobots.\n\nRover is seen in a graveyard instead of the backyard.\n\nThe racecar is being painted purple and a skull replaces the number two.\n\nA skeleton is added between one of the kids and Isabella in the rollercoaster.\n\nA scary voice akin to Boris Karloff says \"Come on, Perry\" instead of Phineas.\n\nA skeleton pops out of the holes in the Whack-a-Pest game.\n\nAlso in the Whack-a-Pest scene, there are more singers than the original one.\n\nThe ending from the 2011 Halloween special is reused with different background music.\n\nSecond Winter Theme Song[]\n\nMain article: Phineas and Ferb Winter Vacation\n\nBackground Information[]\n\nAccording to creator Dan Povenmire on the DVD bonus feature Original Pitch from The Fast and the Phineas, the song was originally going to be done by a classical Disney chorus. He and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh wrote the lyrics, but Disney wanted to make the melody more modern. Dan Povenmire sang an approximation of it on the presentation. Povenmire finally got his classical Disney chorus for the Christmas version of the song.\n\nIn reality, summer vacation lasts about 90 days at most. At San Diego Comic-Con 2013, Dan Povenmire revealed that he wrote 104 because he only expected the show to last 52 episodes, like most Disney Channel shows lasted at the time, and there were two segments per episode, totaling 104.\n\nThe calendar in this theme song indicates that summer vacation started on June 3, the day when the episode \"Rollercoaster\" occurs. Hence September 14 (104 days later) is the day when the events of \"Last Day of Summer\" happen.\n\nIn the episode \"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\", Phineas tells Xavier and Fred that Bowling for Soup is \"before their time.\" He also might be referring to the fact that the kids that are watching this show are not familiar with the band, as it is somewhat before this show's time.\n\n\"Today is Gonna Be a Great Day\" is an extended version of the original theme song, with additional lyrics by Bowling for Soup's Jaret Reddick. He explained to Songfacts that he was brought to the Disney lot and shown the first 13 episodes, which he used to write the full-length song. It took him about 20 minutes to write the extra lyrics.[1]\n\nThe song was nominated in 2008 for an Emmy Award for \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music,\" but lost to \"Pirate Master\" on CBS.\n\nA form of the song is used in the credits for \"Phineas' Birthday Clip-O-Rama!\" in which we see clips of Candace yelling \"Mom!\" the tag-line at the end is \"Mom, Phineas and Ferb are digitally tuning my voice!\"\n\nPizzazium Infinionite's atomic number is 104, which may be a reference to there being (at least for Phineas and Ferb) 104 days in summer vacation.\n\nThe song was referenced in lots of episodes such as, \"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo\", \"Swiss Family Phineas\", \"Last Train to Bustville\", \"Canderemy\", et al.\n\nIn the title sequence for \"Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel\", Spider-Man takes Candace's place and parodies her line as \"Aunt May, Phineas and Ferb are making a crossover!\"\n\nA skeleton of a unicorn-turtle is used as a chess table in the Gravity Falls episode \"Little Dipper\". Creator Alex Hirsch told Dan that it is only a coincidence, but \"would prefer fans think it was on purpose.\"[2]\n\nThe song is referenced twice in \"Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars\". The lines \"Building a rocket or fighting a mummy\" are heard as the boys' speeder's horn, and Linda mentions \"Giving a Bantha a shower\" as one of the items on Phineas' list.\n\nIn the Russian dub of the series, the Season 1 intro used visuals from the Season 2 intro. When the second season premiered, the visuals were retained, but the song was re-dubbed and the lyrics changed slightly, due to a change of the dubbing studio. From the third season onwards, the series used the same intro as in other countries.\n\nIn the character commentaries on the Phineas and Ferb: 104 Days of Summer! iTunes collection, Candace's line is dubbed over with \"Mom, Phineas and Ferb are repurposing old episodes with new commentaries!\"\n\nDuring the Whack-A-Pest scene, Perry has an angry expression on his face as if he was Agent P.\n\nErrors[]\n\nAfter \"Rollercoaster\", the main characters' voices have changed as their actors aged, but Phineas's original voice has remained intact during the opening.\n\nIn some scenes the clouds are moving, in others, they are not.\n\nSongwriters[]\n\nDan Povenmire\n\nJeff \"Swampy\" Marsh\n\nCarl Hill Williams\n\nMichael Walker\n\nMichael Culross Jr.\n\nBMI Work #9365299 (Original theme song)\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of songs\n\n\"Phineas and Ferb Theme\" in other languages\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nPiper's Picks TV #031: Dan and Swampy sing the theme song at the 7:19 mark of this video.\n\nPrevious:\n\nN/A Songs Next:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Short Version 1) Previous:\n\n\"I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun\" (Instrumental 1) Songs (Instrumental 1) Next:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Short Version 2) Previous:\n\n\"Go, Go, Phineas\" Songs (Instrumental 2) Next:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Short Version 5) Previous:\n\n\"Evil Jingle\" (\"Lights, Candace, Action!\") Songs (Instrumental 3) Next:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Instrumental 1) Previous:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Short Version 6) Songs (Instrumental 4) Next:\n\n\"Gitchee Gitchee Goo\" (Instrumental 1) Previous:\n\n\"Gitchee Gitchee Goo\" (Radio Version) Songs (Instrumental 5) Next:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Run Away Runway Version) Previous:\n\n\"Gitchee Gitchee Goo\" (Instrumental 2) Songs (Instrumental 6) Next:\n\n\"On the Trail\" Previous:\n\n\"Perry the Platypus\" (Instrumental 2) Songs (Western Instrumental) Next:\n\n\"S'Winter\" Previous:\n\n\"Evil Jingle\" (S'Winter\") Songs (Instrumental 7) Next:\n\n\"Funky Robot Romance\" (Instrumental 1) Previous:\n\n\"E.V.I.L.
