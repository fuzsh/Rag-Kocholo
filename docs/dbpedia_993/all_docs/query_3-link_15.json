        "text": "After going through the internet, I am not able to find the answer to this. I have over 3000 songs on Apple Music and I am trying to figure out how to sort music by the length of the song. I do not know the name of the song that I’m searching for but I know it’s the longest song out of all of them. Can someone help me with this?\n\nHello Luiscuevas1996,\n\n​Thank you for using the Apple Support Communities. We see you have a question about sorting content in the Music app for iOS, and we'll be happy to provide an answer.\n\nThis resource covers sorting options: View albums, playlists, and more in Music on iPhone\n\n\"Sort your music\n\nTap Library, then tap Playlists, Albums, Songs, TV & Movies, or Music Videos.\n\nTap Sort, then choose a sorting method, such as title, artist, recently added, or recently played.\"\n\nWhile it's not possible to sort by song length on iOS, you can always send your suggestion to Apple here: Product Feedback\n\nAs an alternative, if you use iTunes or the macOS Music app, you should be able to sort by song length there. You would do this by opening the Songs view from the Library options, and then clicking the \"Time\" field.\n\nWe hope that helps.\n\nTake care."
