        "text": "Default is the failure to repay a loan according to the terms agreed to in the promissory note. For most federal student loans, you default if you have not made a payment in more than 270 days.\n\nIf you havenâ€™t made a payment on your federal student loan for at least 270 days (nine months), and you have not entered into an agreement with your lender or servicer to postpone your payments (like deferment or forbearance), you are probably in default.\n\nDuring the months in which you miss payments on your federal student loans, your servicer must exercise \"due diligence\" in attempting to collect the loan. Your servicer must make repeated efforts to locate and contact you about repayment.\n\nIf you have not received a letter from your servicer and you believe you could be in default, contact your servicer immediately. Ask about repayment options and find out if it is possible for you to avoid default.\n\nOnce your federal student loan goes into default, you could face a number of consequences:\n\nYour wages can be garnished without a court order\n\nYou can lose out on your tax refund or Social Security check, because the money is applied to your defaulted student loan\n\nCredit reporting companies are notified, which generally means a lower credit score for you\n\nYou may not receive additional federal student aid if you are in default on a federal student loan until you take steps to bring your federal student loan out of default.\n\nIf you are behind on your federal student loan payments and being contacted by a debt collector, you may be able to arrange repayment options to get out of default."
