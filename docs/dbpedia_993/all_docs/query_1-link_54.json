        "text": "At Kentucky Legal Aid we pride ourselves on providing exceptional client service. This means we make it easy to apply for legal help and let you know quickly what help we can provide.\n\nHow we work on a typical request for legal help:\n\n1. You Call Us\n\nCall 270-782-5740 or 866-452-9243 (toll free) to apply for help. This line is answered Monday through Thursday from 8:30 am to 6:00 pm CT. The line is closed on all major holidays and sometimes for special events.\n\nWhen you call, a receptionist will answer and request your phone number and place you in line for a quick call back from the Intake Department. The receptionist will let you know when to expect the callback. You will usually be called back in less than 30 minutes. However, it could be a longer time if we are very busy.\n\nUnless you are someone’s power of attorney or guardian, you must call on your own behalf, not about someone else’s problem.\n\n2. Initial Evaluation\n\nWhen you are called back you will be asked to provide financial information about your household. Please gather information about all the income in your household and the value of assets that you own (like a home or car) before calling. We use this financial information to determine if we can help you.\n\n3. Speaking with a Legal Advocate\n\nIf you are eligible for help, you will be transferred to speak with a legal advocate. Please gather the documents and facts relevant to your case before calling so we can help you as quickly as possible. The legal advocate will talk with you about your situation and attempt to help you resolve the problem. If needed, the legal advocate may set you an appointment to come to one of our offices or make arrangements for another advocate to help you.\n\nOnce you are approved for services, you will be able to call back as needed to speak directly with your assigned legal advocate. Financial screening is generally only necessary once a year."
