        "text": "The City of Hilliard is seeking public input on four alternative routes for a multiuse path that will connect the east and west sides of Cemetery Road at Interstate 270.\n\nA Talk2Us webpage has been developed to provide information and gather public feedback on four proposed options that will address the pedestrian gap at Cemetery Road and I-270. Those who live, work, or travel in the City of Hilliard are encouraged to provide comments.\n\nPublic comments can also be made by filling out a comment card at the Hilliard Municipal Building, 3800 Municipal Way.\n\nFeedback will be accepted from July 5 through Aug. 5.\n\nAccording to Letty Schamp, Director of Transportation and Mobility for the City of Hilliard, this path will provide a safe connection for pedestrians, bicyclists, and other users via a pedestrian bridge and – with one alternative – a tunnel.\n\nConnecting Cemetery Road to Mill Run by trail will allow people who use alternative means of transportation to cross the corridor for jobs, shopping, recreational activities, and more.\n\nThe community’s participation is valuable in the City’s decision-making and prioritization of capital projects.\n\n“We want the public to take all the alternatives and evaluation criteria into consideration to help us pick the best option,” Schamp said.\n\nIn addition to community input, the City will evaluate criteria such as directness of route, safety, traffic management, and environmental factors when making the final decision.\n\nThe four options include:\n\nAlternative 1 – North side with crossing\n\nAlternative 2 – South side with tunnel\n\nAlternative 3 – North side to south side\n\nAlternative 4 – South side with crossing\n\n“All of these alternatives are safer than existing conditions,” Schamp said. “Each one fills a specific gap, and we have to decide which design best serves our community.”\n\nThe various alternatives are estimated to cost between $3.8 million and $6.2 million."
