        "text": "Product description\n\nA lightweight saw with a narrow blade and the same aggressive performance as that of a ‘big saw? Yes, it is possible! Silky succeeded in developing a pull saw with a narrow blade that enables precision pruning without sacrificing performance. This ingenious design makes the Tsurugi a perfectly balanced saw.\n\nThe combination of the curved blade and the revolver-style handle is ideal for work above the shoulder and below the knee. While your arm, wrist, and hand remain in their natural position, you can still saw on top of the branch with ease. Additionally, you quickly realize when the end of the saw cut has been reached, so that you work more efficiently even in the most difficult circumstances. With the narrow blade of this saw, you will be capable of working with precision in the most densely grown spaces, without damaging surrounding branches.\n\nThe powerful blade has a high rigidity and a row of razor-sharp, aggressive teeth that will leave behind a smooth tree cut. The comfortable Genki revolver grip has no bolts or screws, and consists of just two rubber parts perfectly encasing the steel. Very nifty, and no further tools needed!\n\nThe aluminum scabbard is designed in such a way so that the saw will not fall out of it, but can still be pulled with just one hand. The scabbard is lightweight and can be used by both right-handed and left-handed people. Complete your Tsurugi with the available leg straps and you will always have the saw at arm’s length.\n\nDid you know that the tsurugi is named after a double-edged Japanese sword from ancient times? Proof of its great performance!"
