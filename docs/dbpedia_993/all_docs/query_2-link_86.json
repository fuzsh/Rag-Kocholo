(RHI) is proud to celebrate National Health Center\n\nWeek (NHCW) 2024, taking place August 4-10. The annual event highlights the essential role\n\nCommunity Health Centers play in improving public health and advancing health equity.\n\nHealth centers represent the nation’s largest primary care network, serving 31.5 million patients\n\nnationwide.This year’s NHCW celebration, launched by the National Association of Community\n\nHealth Centers (NACHC), focuses on “Powering Communities Through Caring Connections”\n\nthrough a host of scheduled events that include resource fairs, back-to-school drives, health\n\nscreenings, visits to health centers by local, state, and national leaders, and more.\n\nWith a mission to make high-quality, affordable care available to everyone, regardless of their\n\nability to pay or insurance status, health centers save lives on the front lines of our nation’s most\n\npressing public health challenges. They are powered by a workforce of nearly 300,000 dedicated professionals who reach beyond the walls of the exam room to not only prevent illness but also address the social drivers that may cause it — climate change, homelessness, substance use disorders, food insecurity and behavioral health.\n\n“This week is crucial for awareness because people need to know that this nation’s health centers are more than just the places for doctor appointments”, says RHI Community Outreach Coordinator Chase Hileman. “Our services, our medical professionals, all employees, play a significant part in taking on the issues within the communities we serve”.\n\nNearly 1,500 health centers are the health care home to:\n\n● One in 5 uninsured people\n\n● One in 3 people living in poverty\n\n● One in 7 rural residents\n\n● Nearly 9 million children\n\n● 400,000 veterans\n\nRHI plans to celebrate National Health Center Week by hosting patient appreciation days\n\nfeaturing free snow cones and resources at each of their five clinics. To learn more about the\n\nmission and accomplishments of health centers, visit www.nachc.org.
