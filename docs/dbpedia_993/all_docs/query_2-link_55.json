        "text": "Yes, according to a growing body of research. Listening to or making music affects the brain in ways that may help promote health and manage disease symptoms.\n\nPerforming or listening to music activates a variety of structures in the brain that are involved in thinking, sensation, movement, and emotion. These brain effects may have physical and psychological benefits. For example, music causes the release of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) that can evoke emotional reactions, memories, and feelings and promote social bonds. Music can even affect the structure of the brain. Certain structures in the brain have been found to be larger in musicians than nonmusicians, with particularly noticeable changes in people who started their musical training at an early age.\n\nIncreasing evidence suggests that music-based interventions may be helpful for health conditions that occur during childhood, adulthood, or aging. However, because much of the research on music-based interventions is preliminary, few definite conclusions about their effects have been reached. Many reports on the potential benefits of music-based interventions come from observations of individuals or small groups of people. Evidence of this type is valuable for suggesting new ideas, but carefully designed, scientifically rigorous studies of larger numbers of people are needed to provide stronger evidence on whether music-based interventions are effective for specific purposes.\n\nMusic therapy is a health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs. The term âmusic therapyâ is not a description of a specific type of intervention. Instead, it indicates the education, training, and credentials of the therapist who is delivering the intervention.\n\nMusic therapy may involve a variety of different activities, including music improvisation, music listening, song writing, music performance, and learning through music. Music therapists may work in many different settings, such as hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, senior centers, rehabilitation facilities, or schools.\n\nSome of the music-based interventions described in this fact sheet fit the definition of music therapy, but others do not. For example, music-based interventions that involve listening to recorded music are often delivered by health professionals other than music therapists (such as nurses), and therefore do not fit the definition of music therapy.\n\nYou can learn more about music therapy on the website of the American Music Therapy Association.\n\nIn general, research studies of music-based interventions do not show any negative effects. However, listening to music at too high a volume can contribute to noise-induced hearing loss. You can find out about this type of hearing loss on the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders website.\n\nIn addition, because music can be associated with strong memories or emotional reactions, some people may be distressed by exposure to specific pieces or types of music. Extensive playing of musical instruments can lead to pain and injury. Music-based interventions that involve exercise or other types of movement could also lead to injury if appropriate safety precautions are not taken.\n\nNIH and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in association with the National Endowment for the Arts, are sponsoring an initiative called Sound Health to increase understanding of musicâs effect on the brain and the potential clinical applications. The first Sound Health research projects began in 2019. Some projects are investigating musicâs mechanism of action in the brain and how music may be applied to treat symptoms of disorders such as Parkinsonâs disease, stroke, and chronic pain. Others are looking at the effects of music on childrenâs developing brains.\n\nTopics of NCCIH-supported studies within the Sound Health initiative include:\n\nThe effects of music-based interventions on neurodevelopment and pain response in preterm infants\n\nUsing self-generated rhythmic cues to enhance gait in people with Parkinsonâs disease\n\nThe impact of singing interventions on markers of cardiovascular health in older people with cardiovascular disease\n\nIn collaboration with the Foundation for the NIH and the RenÃ©e Fleming Foundation, NIH has developed a toolkit for rigorous, reproducible, well-powered music-based interventions for brain disorders of aging, such as Alzheimerâs disease, Parkinsonâs disease, and stroke. Three workshops were held in 2021 to gather input from experts in a variety of relevant fields, and a request for information was issued to get stakeholder feedback. The toolkit, which was released in 2023, will be pilot tested in demonstration projects. NCCIH is playing a lead role in this effort."
