When connected to your Casio piano or keyboard, the Casio Music Space app acts as digital musical score, a music teacher, a live performance simulator, and as an all-round app to enjoy learning and playing music. Itâs for complete beginners, people taking up an instrument again, and anyone who wants to experience a new way of playing. Expand your enjoyment of music by watching, listening, and playing through the app.\n\nFeatures\n\n1. Piano Roll\n\nThe piano roll makes it easy to see which notes to play even if you donât read music. Itâs a great way to have fun learning while playing.\n\nThe pitch and duration of each note is visualized in real time as the song plays, making it easy to find the correct notes of the chords or melody.\n\n2. Score Viewer\n\nâMusical Score + Soundâ lets you see and listen to a wide range of music on your smart device.\n\nZoom in and out and flip through pages of sheet music in the app. You can also mark up, save and load scores, as well as listen to music while viewing scores, making it convenient to use while on the move or outside your home.\n\n3. Music Player\n\nPlay along with Your Favorite Songs.\n\nSongs on smart devices and songs from music streaming services are played from the instrumentâs speakers by connecting the smart device to the instrument. Perfect for creating a session-like atmosphere, accompanying songs, or practicing parts of songs for a band.\n\n*Music stored in the cloud, protected with Digital Rights Management (DRM), or on streaming services are not supported.\n\n4. Live Concert Simulator\n\nTurn everyday playing into an extraordinary experience. Feel the excitement of live performance at home.\n\nThe app analyzes any performance on a connected instrument or song on a smart device and automatically adds audience sounds according to the excitement of the music. Add a new dimension to your playing with this unique performance experience.\n\n5. Piano Remote Controller\n\nCheck and adjust the digital piano/keyboard's settings on the app while you play.\n\nConnect a smart device to be able to make settings remotely, without the need to touch the digital piano/keyboard.\n\nNeutronstar181 ,\n\nItâs ok\n\nI am using this only because I use a Casio keyboard, and because itâs free and requires no subscription. The reason I gave it 3 instead of 1 star(s) is because:\n\n1. Itâs free\n\n2. Casio has and always will make amazing, affordable, and cool looking keyboards.\n\nHowever, the music player on it really just doesnât work. Like at all. Also, this may just be because Iâm a newcomer at piano, but I canât even play the easiest song. The easiest song has multiple chords, a fast tempo, and is very complicated and confusing. It also doesnât have you play the notes and instead plays them for you, so youâll never know if you played the correct note because of all the notes in front of it. I would rather start out with kindergarten grade songs like Mary had a little lamb, and then slowly up the tempo and add more complicated chords and notes until you can play some extremely complicated songs like Beethovens moonlight sonata volume 5.\n\nI am deciding if I wanna make this 2 or 3 stars, but if I could, I would do 2.5. Overall, it doesnât glitch too often and I love the feel of a simple little game that it gives off. It reminds me of that game called pop tropica I played when I was little. The loading screen and the transition between the main menu and the loading screen is extremely smooth. Just because of that, I have decided to give it 3 stars. The app has some major flaws but for a free app, itâs worth it. 3/5 , or 6/10.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you for using CASIO MUSIC SPACE.\n\nThank you for your feedback.\n\nWe will continue to strive to provide better service in the future."
