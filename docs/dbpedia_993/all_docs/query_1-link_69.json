        "text": "If a license holder is convicted of a felony or a criminal offense involving fraud it is a violation of section 1101.652(a)(1) of the License Act. This section gives the Commission authority to suspend or revoke a license holder that has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has been convicted of a felony or any criminal offense that involves fraud (including misdemeanors). The Commission does not have the authority to revoke or suspend a license holder that has been only charged or accused of committing a felony or criminal offense that involves fraud. A license holder is required to notify the Commission not later than the 30th day after the final conviction or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. Failing to timely notify may result in more severe or further disciplinary action. All license holders’ criminal backgrounds are rechecked upon renewal, however, this does not excuse a license holder from notifying the Commission not later than the 30th day after the final conviction.\n\nThe real estate brokerage referral business, commonly called a Limited Function Referral Office (LFRO), must have a business entity brokerage license because the business is assisting in procuring property or clients to effect the sale, exchange, or lease of real estate [TRELA §§1101.001(A)(viii) and (ix)]. Only an active licensed sales agent sponsored by a licensed business entity may make a referral on behalf of the brokerage, and any referral fee must be paid to the sponsoring broker. A key distinction between a limited function referral office and another brokerage is the agreement between the agent and the broker to limit the agent’s actions to generating referrals. We do not provide advice on how to run or set up a referral-based brokerage business (or LFRO).\n\nLicense holders must meet Continuing Education (CE) requirements during each two- year license period. CE must include 4 hours of Legal Update I, 4 hours of Legal Update II, 3 hours of Contract-Related coursework, and 7 hours of elective CE courses for a total of 18 hours. To determine how many hours have posted to your license record, you can visit our license holder search.\n\nA broker or designated broker of a business entity who sponsor one or more sales agents or a delegated supervisor of one or more license holders must complete the six-hour Broker Responsibility Course as part of the 18-hour CE requirement.\n\nYes. TREC may suspend or revoke a license if the license holder places a sign on a property offering it for lease or rental without the written permission of the owner or the owner's authorized agent. [TRELA §1101.652(b)(18)]. Also, although TREC does not regulate where a license holder places a sign, a license holder is responsible for compliance with any rules, restrictions, or regulations covering placement of a sign in their local area. Placement of signs in violation of city ordinance could be considered an act of negligence or incompetence that authorizes disciplinary action against the license holder as well as subject the license holder and possibly even their principal to enforcement actions by the appropriate authorities. [TRELA §1101.652(b)(1)] Typically, sign ordinances prohibit placing a sign on a utility pole, traffic signal box, or in a road median.\n\nYou cannot use either company name because each implies that Sally, a sales agent, is in charge. An advertisement cannot in any way imply that a sales agent is the person responsible for the operation of a real estate brokerage. [TRELA §1101.652(b)(23) ]. A sales agent may use her name with the term “Team” or “Group,” so long as the advertisement also includes the broker’s name, and so long as the broker has registered the team or group name with the Commission.\n\nNo. TREC does not review a sales agent’s advertising. TREC will only discuss advertising questions with a broker directly. Your sponsoring broker should review your advertising because your sponsoring broker is responsible for ensuring that your advertising complies with TREC’s advertising rules, and both you and your sponsoring broker can be disciplined if your advertising violates TREC rules. [See §§535.2(g), 535.154, and 535.155 (effective May 15, 2018); TRELA 1101.652(b)(23)]. Your broker must maintain, on a current basis, written policies and procedures to ensure that each sponsored sales agent complies with the Commission’s advertising rules. [See §535.2(i)(6)].\n\nYes. If you are acting on your own behalf or on behalf of your spouse, parent or child, you must inform any person with whom you deal that you are a licensed broker or sales agent acting on that relative’s behalf. This notice must be in writing. A license holder shall not use the license holder’s expertise to the disadvantage of a person with whom the license holder deals. [Rule 535.144(c)]\n\nYes. The Information About Brokerage Services (IABS) representations disclosure is not required when:\n\n(1) a transaction is for a residential lease less than one year and a sale is not being considered;\n\n(2) a meeting is with a party currently known to be represented by another license holder; or\n\n(3) the communication is at an open house and the communication concerns that same property.\n\n[TRELA §1101.558(c)]\n\nIn addition, the IABS is not generally required when the license holder is acting solely as a principal in the transaction.\n\nYes, but if you offer, recommend, or promote the use of a service provider and expect to receive compensation from the service provider when a party uses the service, the ad must disclose that you may receive the compensation. [Rule 535.155 (effective May 15, 2018)] You may advertise an inspector’s services, however, an inspector may not pay a fee or other valuable consideration for (1) a referral, (2) inclusion on a list of inspectors or preferred providers, or a similar arrangement; or (3) inclusion on a list of inspections contingent on other financial agreements. [Rule 535.220(e)(3)] Also, acceptance of a fee from a service provider may violate the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), which prohibits certain referral fees and kickbacks.\n\nOnly with appropriate disclosure and consent. If the license holder is an agent of the buyer, the license holder owes a fiduciary duty to the buyer. The license holder can work for a lender without breaching that duty, but the license holder can't direct a purchaser to any one lender. The license holder should inform the purchaser that the license holder is employed by the lender and give the names of several institutions to the purchaser. The primary duty of the agent is to represent the interests of the agent’s client, not the agent's own interests. [Rule 531.1]\n\nYes, a sales agent can own his or her own business entity. The entity must, if it engages in real estate brokerage, hold a separate license. The entity must have a designated broker through whom all transactions must be handled and who is responsible for the entity's (and any sponsored sales agent’s) actions. The specific details of the supervision that the sales agent’s sponsoring broker exercises over the sales agent’s actions should take into consideration the sales agent’s experience and ability, acknowledging the fact that the broker is responsible for the sales agent’s actions, and should be described in a written agreement between the sales agent and the sales agent’s sponsoring broker. The sales agent’s agreement should also address how compensation is handled with the broker. For additional information, read Rule 535.2 regarding broker responsibility. See also Rules 535.154 and 535.155 regarding advertising.\n\nA sales agent may work from an office location different from the main office of the sales agent's sponsoring broker, but the sponsoring broker is still responsible for the sales agent's actions. [TRELA §1101.803, Rule 535.2(a)] Despite this flexibility, a sales agent may not lawfully engage in brokerage activity unless the sales agent is associated with, and acting for, the sponsoring broker at all times. [TRELA §1101.351(c)] Thus, a sales agent may not work for a broker who is not the sales agent’s sponsoring broker or work for another broker or out of another broker's office.\n\nNo. This could “tend to mislead” the public that the associated broker is in charge of the brokerage operation. The public needs to know the broker with whom they will have a legal agreement (remember listing agreements, etc. are taken in the name of the broker, not the sales agent or the associated broker). The associated broker could use “associated broker”, “broker associate” or “associate broker”, since that distinguishes his or her role. [TRELA §1101.652(b)(23)]\n\nThe intermediary may delegate to another license holder the authority to appoint license holders. If the intermediary authorizes another license holder to appoint associated license holders to work with the respective principals, that license holder cannot designate himself/herself as one of the appointed license holders. This is an improper combination of the different functions of intermediary and appointed license holder. It is important to remember that there will always be a single intermediary broker even if another license holder has been authorized to make the specific appointments. The intermediary is prohibited from acting so as to favor one principal over the other, and may not reveal confidential information obtained from one principal without the written instructions of that principal, unless disclosure is required by TRELA, court order, or the information materially relates to the condition of the property. The intermediary and any associated license holders appointed by the intermediary broker are prohibited from disclosing, without the written authorization from the seller, that the seller will accept a price less than the asking price or that the buyer will pay a price greater than the price submitted in a written offer. [TRELA § 1101.558]\n\nYes, if the assumed business name of the associated broker meets the requirements for a team name since a team name must be used when the associated broker is associating with another broker. Keep in mind that the associated broker registers the assumed business name that is used when they are not associating with another broker and the broker that they are associating with registers the team name being used when associating with that broker. [Rule 535.154(a)(5)]\n\nNote on Exclusive Name Use: TREC does not, and is not, required to vet names submitted for registration as an assumed name or team name for exclusivity. A brokerage should decide whether it makes good sense from a liability exposure standpoint to allow an associated broker (or a sales agent who owns a business entity) to use the same name for a team name under the brokerage that they have registered as an assumed name under their own licensed business entity.\n\nTREC does not consider URLs or email addresses to be advertisements in and of themselves. However, an advertisement that contains a URL or email address of a sales agent that includes a title that implies responsibility for a brokerage violates TREC Rule 535.155(d)(4). Further, TREC will consider all advertisements in their entirety and if an email address or URL] makes the advertisement misleading or deceptive, it violates the law. [Rule 535.155(b)(4) and TRELA §1101.652(b)(23)]\n\nA broker is not required to directly supervise sponsored sales agents; this responsibility may be delegated to another person with the required level of experience and expertise to provide proper supervision under the law. [Rule 535.2(e)] However, the broker remains responsible for the authorized acts of the broker’s sales agents [TRELA §1101.803, Rule 535.2(a) ] and has many affirmative duties regarding written policies, record keeping and advising, training, approving advertising for and responding to sales agents. Brokers should be familiar with and follow the duties set out in Rule 535.2 . A broker should also be aware that a complaint filed against a sponsored sales agent is also a complaint against the broker for the purpose of determining the broker’s involvement in the alleged violation and whether the broker properly supervised the sales agent. [Rule 535.141(c) and (d)] A business entity can only provide the proper supervision by the personal involvement of the broker or by the broker’s delegation to a qualified supervisor.\n\nYes. You are under the Sales Apprentice Education (SAE) requirements. Before you can renew your license, you are required to have completed a total of 270 hours of qualifying course hours, and the Legal Update I and II courses.\n\nTo determine how many hours have posted to your license record, you may visit the license holder info search feature on our website.\n\nYes, as long as the advertisement complies with Rule 535.155 (effective May 15, 2018) regarding any restrictions that might apply. However, a rebate to a buyer from a license holder may be subject to restrictions by the buyer’s lender. You should contact your broker or private attorney to find out how you should notify and obtain the consent of the buyer’s lender to address any impact the rebate may have on the determination regarding the buyer’s creditworthiness.\n\nYes, but the ad must disclose that payment of the rebate is subject to the consent of the seller and if the rebate is contingent upon certain restrictions, such as the use of a particular service provider, the ad must contain a disclosure that payment of the rebate is subject to restrictions. [Rule 535.155 (effective May 15, 2018)] A sales agent must also have their sponsoring broker's authorization to offer a rebate.\n\nTo avoid an advertisement that implies the sales agent is responsible for the operation of the brokerage in this situation, the sales agent should make sure that the ad clearly indicates that the sales agent is not the broker. One simple way to accomplish this is to put “sales agent” next to the agent’s name. Using “REALTOR” or “agent” is insufficient to distinguish the license status of sales agent. [TRELA §1101.652(b)(23) and Rule 535.155(d)(7)]\n\nYes, if the real estate business entity holds a real estate license and the sales agent is sponsored by that entity. In such a situation, the designated broker for the entity is still responsible for the sales agent's actions, even when the sales agent owns the licensed business entity. [TRELA §1101.803, Rule 535.2(l), ] A sales agent may not engage in real estate brokerage activity unless the sales agent is associated with, and acting for, a sponsoring broker. [TRELA §1101.351(c)]. When the sponsoring broker is a licensed business entity, it must have a designated broker to be active.\n\nYes. Rule 531.20(b) states that each broker and sales agent must provide a link on its homepage to the IABS Form labeled \"Texas Real Estate Commission Information About Brokerage Services\". The link must be in at least a 10 point font and in a readily noticeable place on the homepage of the business website of the broker and sales agent. The link can also be \"TREC Information About Brokerage Services,\" in at least 12 point font.\n\nNo. Texas law does not permit dual agency. A license holder may not represent both principals as a dual agent under the revisions to TRELA. Under the current law, a broker must agree to act as an intermediary in accordance with the statute if the broker agrees to represent more than one party in a transaction. [TRELA §1101.561(b)] To the extent a dual agency relationship is created by accident or otherwise, a license holder must resolve the matter by immediate compliance with the notice and consent requirements under TRELA §§1101.558-561 and act as either an intermediary or represent only one of the principals in a transaction while working with the other principal only as a customer.\n\nYes, as long as the ad complies with Rule 535.155 (effective May 15, 2018), which requires the consent of the party the license holder represents in a transaction. When a rental locator represents an apartment complex, the locator needs the consent of the apartment complex. When the rental locator represents a tenant and not an apartment complex, as demonstrated by a written representation agreement or other evidence of representation, the locator is not required to obtain the consent of the apartment complex because the complex is not his client. Regardless of representation, however, it is misleading advertising to advertise a rebate for an apartment complex that the locator knows has a “no rebate” policy.\n\nAn intermediary is a broker who negotiates the transaction between the parties when the broker or a sales agent sponsored by the broker has obtained consent from the parties to represent both the buyer and the seller. The broker intermediary may, with the written consent of the parties, appoint separate individual license holder associated with the broker to work with and advise the party to whom they have been appointed. [TRELA §§ 1101.558-1101.561 and §1101.651(d)]\n\nGenerally, in Texas, filing an assumed business name is required to put the public on notice that you are doing business under a name other than your legal name. For most business entities, the assumed business name is filed with the Secretary of State. For a general partnership or individual broker, the assumed business name is filed with the county clerk in the county or counties where you do business. See https://www.sos.state.tx.us/corp/namefilingsfaqs.shtml\n\nEvidence of registration of the assumed business name with the Secretary of State or in the county or counties where the broker does business is adequate proof of authority to do business under that name. [Rule 535.154(d)]\n\nAssumed Business Name (also known as a dba) is another name for the broker’s business that can be used by all sponsored sales agents and brokers associated with this broker. Another name that indicates a broker’s line of business, e.g. property management or commercial, is also an assumed business name of the broker, even though it may not be available for use by all sponsored agents and associated brokers. [Rule 535.154(a)(4)]\n\nTeam Name is a name used only by a team or group of one or more sponsored sales agents or brokers associated with this broker. Team names must end in “team” or “group” and cannot contain the words “brokerage”, “company”, “associates” or other similar terms. [Rule 535.154(a)(5)]\n\nIf the broker appoints an associated license holder to represent the seller and another associated license holder to represent the buyer, the individual agents may offer advice and opinions regarding the real estate transaction to the party each has been appointed to represent. If the broker does not appoint associated license holders to represent the buyer and seller respectively, then the broker and/or agent may not offer advice and opinions relevant to the real estate transaction to either party and must not favor one principal in the transaction over the other principal. Appointments provide the agents the opportunity to provide a higher level of service to their clients.\n\nAny agent who worked with the seller or the buyer in a transaction that resulted in the sale of a property may correctly state in an advertisement that they “sold” the property. If the license holder did not participate in that specific transaction, he cannot state or imply that his actions resulted in the sale of that property. An example of a misleading advertisement of this nature would be if a license holder sent out “Just Sold” postcards with her contact information and a picture of a recently sold property that she did not help to sell. She didn’t state that she sold it but an average person reading the card could surely and reasonably imply an erroneous claim of involvement. Another potential example of a misleading advertisement is a license holder who included a list of “Recently Sold Homes” in his advertisement that included many properties where he had no role in the transaction, but he failed to make it clear in the ad which – if any – of those transactions he was involved in. Under Texas law, a license holder may not “create a misleading impression” in their advertisement. A broker must review all ads to ensure this result is avoided.\n\nA license holder should fully complete and provide the Disclosure of Relationship with Residential Service Company (RSC-3) when the license holder will receive a fee from a residential service company because a party to the transaction purchases a contract from that company.\n\nMany transactions do not require use of this form. For example,\n\nIf there is no residential service company contract as part of the transaction, you do not need to provide this form.\n\nIf you are not being paid a fee by a residential service company, you do not need to provide this form.\n\nIf a residential service company contract is part of the transaction but you do not receive a fee from that specific company, you do not need to provide this form.\n\nGenerally, the only reason you might fill out this form if you do not receive a fee from a residential service company is because the other agent or broker in your transaction is providing their own disclosure. In this situation, you would fill out the appropriate portion of the form and check the box that says you \"will receive no compensation from a residential service company.\" Your signature in this situation is merely disclosure and is not an endorsement, approval, or otherwise binding.\n\nYes. You are required to tell us within 30 days of a felony. Section 1101.652(a)(7) of the License Act provides that if you have entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or have been convicted of a felony or any criminal offense that involves fraud (including misdemeanors), you must disclose this to the Commission not later than the 30th day after the final conviction or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. The minimum penalty is $500; maximum is $3,000 per failure to report. This means that if you wait until your renewal to notify the Commission of your felony, you could be subject to the penalty, in addition to any disciplinary action related to the crime. If you do have an unreported felony, or an unreported criminal offense involving fraud, report it to the Commission as soon as possible.\n\nYou can be exempt from taking the National portion of the exam if you hold an active license in a state that participates in the National exam accreditation with ARELLO. Submit a license history from the state in which you are licensed when you file your application so we can determine if you are exempt."
