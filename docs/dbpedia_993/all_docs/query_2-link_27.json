        "text": "“The Anamorphic/i lenses create stunning flares – I love an anamorphic flare streak, but I also think it should be selective and appropriate to the project. The Cookes have a subtle version of this and flare beautifully. They are also easy to control if you don’t want flare.”\n\nTony Slater Ling, BSC | Director of Photography\n\n“Some lenses like these they give you different looks at different stops. So its a lens that performs very well as a workhorse, because the colour rendition and sharpness has a very modern quality. But then you go wide open, all of a sudden there is another characteristic.” “It’s a beautiful set…”\n\nMatthew Libatique | Director of Photography"
