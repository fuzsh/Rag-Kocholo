        "text": "F. General requirements. The following general requirements shall apply to all parking spaces and areas:\n\n1. Size and access. Each off-street parking space shall be rectangular, and not less than 9 feet in width and 18 feet in length regardless of the angle of parking. Each commercial or multiple-family parking space shall be served by an aisle which meets or exceeds the standards set forth in these regulations. When curbs or curb stops are employed, up to 2 feet of the stall length may overhang the curb. Stalls may overhang sidewalks provided 4-foot wide usable sidewalks are retained and public rights-of-way are not encroached upon.\n\n2. Aisle length. Parking lot aisles of over 150 feet in length shall have either an approved method of emergency vehicle egress deemed acceptable by the Rapid City Fire Marshal or a turnaround which will accommodate a 30-foot vehicle with a 42-foot turning radius.\n\n3. Locations.\n\na. Off-street parking facilities shall be located outside the public right-of- way and as hereinafter specified.\n\nb. Parking facilities shall either be provided on the same parcel as the use it is to serve or within 300 feet from the building’s primary entrance or use it is to serve, using established sidewalks and crossings. Such distance shall be the walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking facility to the building’s primary entrance that such facility is required to serve.\n\n4. Clear sight triangles. Parking spaces and areas shall not be allowed which would obstruct the required sight triangle as provided in § 17.50.335 when such parking space or area is being occupied.\n\n5. Mixed occupancies in a building. In the case of mixed uses in a building or on a lot, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for 1 use shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use except as hereinafter specified for shared use.\n\n6. Shared parking facilities.\n\na. Upon application by the owner or lessee of any property and after staff review of the application, the Director may authorize the shared use of parking facilities under the conditions specified in this section:\n\n1) Not more than 50% of the parking facilities required by this title will be provided by the shared parking facility;\n\n2) No substantial conflict in the operating hours of the buildings or uses for which the shared use of the parking facility is proposed will occur;\n\n3) The building or use utilizing the shared parking facilities is located within 300 feet of such parking facility using established sidewalks and crosswalks where available.\n\nb. Parking using shared off-street parking facilities shall evidence agreement for such shared use by a proper legal instrument approved by the City Attorney as to form and content. Copies of such instrument, when approved as conforming to the provisions of this section, shall be filed with the Department.\n\nG. Use and maintenance of off-street parking area. Off-street parking space shall be maintained in accordance with the following specifications:\n\n1. Entrances and exits.\n\na. Driveways and curb cuts for ingress and egress shall be built in accordance with the Engineering Division’s curb cut policy and as approved by the City Engineer or his or her designee and in accordance with the city’s off-street parking requirements. Entrances and exits shall in no case be less than 10 feet nor more than 40 feet in width or 14 feet in vertical clearance.\n\nb. Unpaved access to parking facilities is not permitted except for single-family and duplex uses. All commercial and industrial uses intending to utilize an unimproved access for parking facilities shall bear the cost of paving the access way to city minimum construction standards. This requirement is subject to waiver by Common Council only in cases where paving continuity would not be achieved and gravel segments would remain.\n\n2. Circulation. Circulation within a parking area shall be such that a vehicle entering the parking area need not enter a public right-of-way to reach another aisle and that a vehicle need not enter a public right-of-way backwards. This provision shall not apply to off-street parking required for 1- or 2-family dwelling units.\n\n3. Surfacing. Off-street parking areas shall be paved and maintained so as to eliminate dust or mud. Paved parking facilities shall comply with standards established in Ordinance 1976, as approved by the Common Council on October 9, 1980, as administered by the City Engineer, and on file in the Finance Office.\n\n4. Dust palliative. All commercial, light industrial and heavy industrial uses which involve outdoor storage shall apply a dust palliative approved by the City Engineer to all unpaved areas utilized for storage. An approved dust palliative shall be applied annually or as directed by the Engineering Division. Vehicle or equipment maneuvering areas and approaches to permanent loading docks shall be paved as set forth in Minimum Standards for Construction of Parking Lots, June 16, 1980.\n\n5. Drainage. Off-street parking areas shall be graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water with drainage directed toward curb cuts when possible. Parking facilities may be designed to function as metered stormwater detention facilities, when in connection with a master drainage plan and as approved by the City Engineering Division.\n\n6. Markings. Except for 1- and 2-family uses, all parking facilities shall be marked with striping paint as shown on the approved building permit. Aisles, approach lanes, stalls, handicapped stalls and designated no parking areas shall be clearly marked with direction arrows, lines and symbols to assure the safe and efficient movement of vehicles. CLEARLY MARKED is defined as displaying a visibly-defined edge. Whenever parking lots are re-striped, any parking facility which does not meet the standards set forth in subsections H.4. through H.6. of this section shall be made to comply with subsections H.4. through H.6. of this section involving parking for persons with disabilities.\n\n7. Border, barricades, screening and landscaping. Off-street parking areas shall conform to the regulations set forth in the landscape ordinance, § 17.50.300. Tree planting in the right-of-way is permitted as provided in § 12.32.080 of this code, landscape requirements.\n\na. Every parking area that abuts a public or private sidewalk, public right-of-way, or building entrance or exit shall be provided with a wheel guard or curbs not less than 6 inches in height which shall be securely installed and maintained.\n\nb. Every multiple-family or commercial parking area on a lot that abuts a single-family residential lot along a side lot line shall be set back a distance of not less than 12 feet. Not less than 50% of the required landscaping for the subject lot shall be placed within the parking lot or within 20 feet of the parking lot.\n\nc. Every parking area on a lot which abuts the rear lot line of a lot within single-family residential district shall be set back a distance of not less than 15 feet. Fifty percent or more of the required landscaping for the subject lot shall be located in the parking lot or within 20 feet of the parking lot.\n\nd. Landscaping proposed to be located in the right-of-way between the property line and the street section may be applied to the requirements of the landscape ordinance in an amount not to exceed 25% of the total landscaping points required as determined pursuant to the formula in the landscape ordinance.\n\n8. Lighting. All parking areas except single-family residential shall be provided with lighting when evening usage is anticipated. The lighting shall be arranged so as to provide security and to reflect light toward the parking area.\n\n9. Bond for completion. When the required off-street parking area cannot be paved at the time of issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the Chief Building Official shall require a surety in an amount equal to the estimated cost of paving and improvements which will provide for and secure through an improvements agreement the paving completion within 1 paving season. All bonds and other methods of guarantee shall be approved by the City Attorney.\n\nH. Parking for persons with disabilities.\n\n1. Provision of parking. In addition to the general requirements for parking provided for under subsection G. of this section, accessible parking facilities for persons with disabilities shall be provided in accordance with this subsection. Accessible parking for a particular building must be located on the shortest accessible route of travel from adjacent parking to an accessible entrance. If there are multiple accessible entrances to the building, the accessible spaces must be dispersed and located closest to the accessible entrances. For parking facilities which do not serve a specific use or building, the accessible parking shall be located on the shortest accessible route to the nearest accessible pedestrian entrance to the parking facility. Accessible spaces may be provided off-site in accordance with this chapter as long as accessibility is not jeopardized.\n\n2. Accessible route. A minimum of 1 accessible route meeting the requirements of this section must be provided between the building’s accessible entrance and the accessible parking spaces, passenger loading zones, and public streets or sidewalks. An accessible route shall meet the following requirements:\n\na. To the maximum extent feasible, it shall coincide with the route for the general public;\n\nb. It shall have a minimum clear width of 36 inches. If an obstruction turnaround is required then the minimum clear width must be provided as shown in Figures H.2(b)-1 and H.2(b)-2 of the technical drawings on file in the Department;\n\nc. Passing spaces are required if the accessible route is less than 60 inches wide. Passing spaces shall be at least 60 inches by 60 inches and spaced at no more than 200-foot intervals. A T-intersection of 2 walks is an acceptable passing space (see Figure H.2(c)-1 of the technical drawings on file in the Department);\n\nd. A minimum of 80 inches of vertical headroom along the route must be provided. If less than 80 inches of vertical headroom exists in any area adjoining the accessible route, then barriers must be provided to warn blind or visually- impaired individuals (see Figures H.2(d)-1, and H.2(d)-2 of the technical drawings on file in the Department);\n\ne. The ground surface of the accessible route shall be stable, firm and slip resistant. The accessible route may not include stairs, steps, or escalators. Changes in level of less than 1/4- inch do not require edge treatment. Changes in level between 1/4- and 1/2-inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. Changes in level greater than 1/2-inch shall require a ramp at least 36 inches wide and complying with all other ramp requirements (subsection H.3. of this section). Surface treatments involving carpeting or grating must meet specific ADA requirements;\n\nf. An accessible route with a running slope of greater than 1:20 is a ramp and shall have a maximum slope of 1:12 and a minimum width of 36 inches and shall comply with all other ramp requirements (subsection H.3. of this section). Nowhere along the accessible route shall the cross slope exceed 1:50;\n\ng. Curb ramps must be provided wherever an accessible route crosses a curb. Slope of curb ramps must be the least possible with a maximum slope for new construction of 1:12 and a maximum rise for any run of 30 inches. Curb ramps and exterior ramps to be constructed in areas which preclude the use of a 1:12 slope may have reduced slopes and rises as follows: (a) a slope between 1:10 and 1:12 is allowed for a maximum rise of 6 inches; and (b) a slope between 1:8 and 1:10 is allowed for a maximum rise of 3 inches. A slope steeper than 1:8 is not allowed (see Figures H.2(g)-1 through H.2(g)-4 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). The minimum clear width of a ramp shall be 36 inches. Ramps shall have level landings at the top and bottom of each ramp and each ramp run. These landings shall: (a) be twice as wide as the ramp run leading to it; (b) landing length shall be at least 60 inches clear; (c) if ramps change directions then the landing size shall be 60 by 60 inches; (d) if a doorway is located at a landing then the area in front of the doorway shall comply with 4.13.6 of ADA. Handrails shall be provided in compliance with 4.8.5 of ADA if a ramp run has a rise greater than 6 inches or a horizontal projection greater than 72 inches.\n\n3. Ramps. The least possible slope shall be used for any ramp. The maximum rise for any run shall be 30 inches. The maximum slope for any new ramp shall be 1:12 unless otherwise allowed by this code. Curb ramps and other exterior ramps constructed in areas where space limitations prevent a 1:12 slope may have slopes and rises as follows: (a) a slope between 1:10 and 1:12 is allowed for a maximum rise of 6 inches; (b) a slope between 1:8 and 1:10 is allowed for a maximum rise of 3 inches. No slope steeper than 1:8 is allowed. The minimum clear width of a ramp shall be 36 inches. Ramps shall have level landings at the top and bottom of each ramp and each ramp run. These landings shall: (a) be twice as wide as the ramp run leading to it; (b) landing length shall be at least 60 inches clear; (c) if ramps change directions then the landing size shall be 60 by 60 inches; (d) if a doorway is located at a landing, the area in front of the doorway shall comply with 4.15.6 of ADA. Handrails shall be provided in compliance with 4.8.5 of ADA if a ramp run has a rise greater than 6 inches or a horizontal projection greater than 72 inches.\n\n4. Spaces required.\n\na. The following number of off-street parking spaces, based on the total required parking, are to be reserved for exclusive use by persons with disabilities. One in every 8 accessible spaces but always at least 1 space must be van accessible. Parking spaces for persons with disabilities may be counted toward the total number of parking spaces required for the use.\n\n5. Signage. Accessible parking spaces shall be designated as reserved by a sign showing the symbol of accessibility (see Figure H.5-1 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). Van accessible parking shall include this symbol of accessibility sign plus an additional van-accessible sign mounted below the symbol of accessibility sign. (see Figure H.5-2 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). Such signs must be located so they cannot be obscured by a vehicle parked in the space and so they are visible from the driver’s seat of the vehicle parked in the space. Such signs must be located on a permanent supporting post or on an adjacent wall.\n\n6. Parking spaces.\n\na. Accessible parking spaces. Accessible parking spaces must be a minimum of 96 inches in width. Parking access aisles shall be part of an accessible route to the building or facility entrance. Two accessible parking spaces may share a common access aisle. Parking spaces may not exceed a 1:50 slope in all directions. Accessible parking spaces may be angled as long as all other requirements specified in this section are met (see Figure H.6a-1 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). Access aisles adjacent to accessible spaces shall be a minimum of 60 inches in width. The spaces shall be 18 feet in length.\n\nb. Van-accessible parking spaces. Van-accessible spaces shall be a minimum of 96 inches wide and 18 feet in length, and shall be served by an access aisle a minimum of 96 inches wide. The access aisle for a van-accessible space must be located on the driver’s right-hand side of the van as it would be parked in the space. The minimum vertical clearance for van-accessible spaces and vehicle routes between van-accessible spaces and the site entrance/exit shall be 98 inches. A sign alerting van users to the presence of the wider aisle is required, but the space is not restricted to vans. Parking spaces may not exceed a 1:50 slope in all directions. Van-accessible parking spaces may be angled as long as all other requirements specified in this section are met (see figure H.6b-2 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). A van-accessible space and an accessible space may share an access aisle as long as that aisle is at least 96 inches wide.\n\nd. Universal parking. An alternative to the provision of separate van-accessible spaces is the provision of universal parking. Universal parking spaces shall be 132 inches wide, with a 60- inch-wide access aisle. These stalls do not have to be signed separately for van-accessibility, but do need to meet signage requirements set forth in subsection H.5. of this section.\n\n7. Protruding objects. Objects projecting from walls, with their leading edges between 27 inches and 80 inches above the finished floor, shall protrude no more than 4 inches into walks, passageways or aisles (see Figure H.7-1 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). Objects mounted with their leading edges at or below 27 inches above the finished floor may protrude any amount (see Figures H.2d-1 and H.7-1 of the technical drawings on file in the Department). Freestanding objects mounted on posts or pylons may overhang a maximum of 12 inches, from 27 inches to 80 inches above the ground or finished floor. Protruding objects shall not reduce the clear width of an accessible route or maneuvering space (see Figure H.7-2 of the technical drawings on file in the Department).\n\n8. Passenger loading zones. Passenger loading zones shall provide an access aisle at least 60 inches wide and 20 feet long, adjacent and parallel to the vehicle pull-up space. If there are curbs between the access aisle and the vehicle pull-up space, then a curb ramp complying with subsection H.3. of this section shall be provided. Vehicle standing spaces and access aisles shall be level with surface slopes, not exceeding 1:50 (2%) in all directions. Any loading zone must maintain a minimum of 114 inches of vertical headroom. This 114-inch clearance is also required along at least 1 vehicle route from the passenger loading zone to the site entrance and exit. For purposes of this chapter, valet parking areas shall meet the same requirements as passenger loading zones.\n\n9. Addition of accessible parking in existing parking lot. Whenever a parking facility, which does not meet the requirements of subsections H.4., H.5. or H.6. of this section, is re-striped, or when existing parking markings are to be repainted, such parking markings shall be altered to conform to the requirements of subsections H.4., H.5. or H.6. of this section. If the entity providing the parking facility is required to eliminate 1 or more parking spaces to comply with this provision, such elimination shall be permitted without requiring a variance to the parking requirements.\n\na. This provision shall apply only to parking facilities providing for 4 or more parking stalls.\n\nb. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the reconstructions of any parking lot to achieve the requisite slope required in the construction of a new parking facility."
