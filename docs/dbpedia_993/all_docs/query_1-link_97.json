        "text": "What Is Commercial Paper?\n\nCommercial paper is an unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by corporations. It's typically used to finance short-term liabilities such as payroll, accounts payable, and inventories. Commercial paper involves a specific amount of money that is to be repaid by a specific date. Minimum denominations are $100,000. Terms to maturity extend from one to 270 days. They average 30 days.\n\nUnderstanding Commercial Paper\n\nCommercial paper was first introduced during colonial times and was referred to as a bill of exchange. They became more modern during the 1920s when New York merchants began to sell their short-term obligations to dealers to access capital needed to cover near-term obligations. These dealers, or middlemen, purchased the paper (also known as promissory notes) at a discount from their par value. They then sold the paper to banks and other investors. The merchants would repay the investors an amount equal to the par value of the note.\n\nCommercial paper is not backed by any form of collateral, making it an unsecured debt and will usually have a higher yield. It differs from asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), a class of debt instrument backed by assets selected by the issuer. In either case, commercial paper is only issued by firms with high ratings from credit rating agencies. These firms can easily find buyers without having to offer a substantial discount (at a higher cost to themselves) for the debt issue.\n\nCommercial paper is issued by large institutions in denominations of $100,000 or more. Other corporations, financial institutions, and wealthy individuals are usually buyers of commercial paper.\n\nTypes of Commercial Paper\n\nThere are a bunch of different types of commercial paper, as companies can issue different forms of items depending on the criteria they’re willing to commit to. Here are the main types of commercial paper:\n\nPromissory Notes\n\nPromissory notes are written promises to pay a specific amount of money on a certain date. They are used by companies to borrow funds without having to use any collateral, and promissory notes can range from just a few days to up to a year. Promissory notes are sold at a discount from their face value and redeemed at face value upon maturity, meaning the difference between those two amounts is technically the interest earned.\n\nDrafts\n\nDrafts are orders written by one party (the drawer) directing another party (the drawee) to pay a specified sum to a third party (the payee). The drawee is usually a bank. As commercial paper, drafts can be used in trade financing to facilitate the purchase of goods and services. Drafts can be either sight drafts which are payable on demand or time drafts which can be payable at a specific future date.\n\nBankers' Acceptances\n\nBankers' acceptances are time drafts that have been accepted and guaranteed by a bank. They are commonly used in international trade to ensure payment to exporters. The bank's acceptance of the draft means that the bank promises to pay the face value of the draft at maturity (which gives certain parties a level of security). Bankers’ acceptances can also be traded in the secondary market before maturity.\n\nCertificate of Deposits (CDs)\n\nCDs are time deposits issued by banks that pay a fixed interest rate for a specified period. CDs are considered low-risk investments since they are backed by the issuing bank; however, there may be a dollar cap as to the amount that is insured. While they are technically not unsecured like most commercial paper, large denominations of CDs are often included in the broader category of commercial paper because of their relative level of liquidity and short-term nature (assuming a more brief CD length).\n\nRepurchase Agreements (Repos)\n\nRepos are agreements in which one party sells securities to another with a promise to repurchase them at a specified price on a future date. Although repos are secured by the underlying securities, they are frequently used as a form of short-term borrowing in the money markets. Because a repo transaction includes the initial sale and the repurchase agreement, it acts as a short-term loan.\n\nCommercial Paper Terms\n\nIssuer\n\nThe issuer of commercial paper is the entity that is creating the short-term debt to fund their short-term cash needs. As mentioned earlier, most issuers are large corporations with strong credit, as the issuer may demonstrate a high probability of being able to pay back debt especially in the short-term.\n\nTerm/Maturity\n\nThe maturity of commercial paper designates how long the debt is outstanding for the issuer. Commercial paper often a term up to 270 days, though companies often issue commercial paper with a maturity of 30 days. At the end of the maturity period, the commercial paper is technically due, and the issuer is now liable to return investor capital (though they may choose to simply re-issue more commercial paper).\n\nSecured/Unsecured\n\nCommercial paper is often unsecured, which means there is no collateral for the debt the issuing company is taking on. If the issuing company goes bankrupt, holders of the issuer's commercial paper may not have recourse in receiving funds. The idea is because commercial paper's maturity is so short and the credit worthiness of issuers is higher, the debt does not need backing by corporate assets.\n\nDiscount/Face Value\n\nCommercial paper is issued at face value, meaning a debt instrument has a value to it often in denominations of $100,000. Instead of paying interest, commercial paper is instead often issued at a discount, or a price that less than face value. When the commercial paper reaches maturity, the investor will receive the face value amount of the instrument even though they paid a lower discount amount.\n\nLiquidity\n\nCommercial paper is often tied to liquidity, the measurement of well a company's short-term cash flows will be able to cover its short-term debt. Therefore, issuers often create commercial paper to increase their liquidity as it may need cash in the short-term. On the other hand, buyers of commercial paper may not need cash right away, so they are willing to buy and hold the instrument to increase their cash on hand in the future.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Commercial Paper\n\nAdvantages\n\nA major benefit of commercial paper is that it does not need to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as long as it matures in no more than nine months or 270 days.\n\nThis makes it a cost-effective and simple means of financing. Although maturities can go as long as 270 days before coming under the purview of the SEC, maturities for commercial paper average about 30 days.\n\nCommercial paper is also easier to deal with compared to the effort, time, and money involved in getting a business loan.\n\nIt offers issuers the advantage of lower interest rates while it offers investors a low risk of default.\n\nCommercial paper provides an effective way for investors to diversify portfolios.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nCompanies must have extremely good credit to issue commercial paper. So, it doesn't offer access to capital for all institutions.\n\nWhat's more, the proceeds from this type of financing can only be used on current assets or inventories. They are not allowed to be used on fixed assets, such as a new plant, without SEC involvement.\n\nLow interest rates for issuers mean low rates of return for investors. Also, due to the large minimum denomination of $100,000, commercial paper typically isn't directly available to smaller investors. However, they can invest indirectly through companies that buy commercial paper."
