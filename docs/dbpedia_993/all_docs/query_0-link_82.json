(type of trimmer)\n\ni know these questions are fairly basic ones but ive spent the last 5hrs online and ive come up dry and thought it would be best to ask the experts before one of us blows our selves up..\n\nonce again thaks in advance SH, you all have helped out so much in the past...\n\nRe: .303-270 reloading\n\nI believe he has the 270/303 which I think is one of the Epps conversions in Canada. Problem with them is the dies are extremely expensive (damn high) and there isn't much to be had in savings.\n\nI believe you could run 303 case up in 7/308 die to take the neck down the first step and take it down in two stages.\n\nYou could also use 7MM Mauser FL die to take down neck.\n\nI designed three new cartridges a number of years ago.\n\n306 Confederate Sabre\n\n7MM Confederate Sabre\n\n6.5 Confederate Sabre\n\nI could just as easily made a 270 Sabre.\n\nThe 306 Sabre has a 303 base/body diameter and is made by grinding down a 30.06 reamer base to .455\"\n\nat the 303 case length dimension leaving the shoulder same size and having 30.06 neck/throat.\n\nWhen I thought of these the idea was to make a series of rounds that could be easily made and dies available cheap.\n\nThe 306 Sabre die was made my cutting off a 30.06 FL die .170\" from the bottom. Same for seater. No reaming required.\n\nYou run 303 cases in this die until the cases shoulder setback will allow the bolt to close and fireform the case. The shoulder expands and increases case capacity 6 grains of propellant which increases velocity up to 30.06 range.\n\nI made this up for Pattern 14 rifles and 303. The other plus factor is the round now headspaces on the shoulder.\n\nThe 7MM and 6.5mm are even easier to load. Unaltered 6.5X55 and 7MM Mauser dies load these two rounds. Shoulders are blown out to these dimensions as well.\n\nI stress relieved the 303 brass about half way down the body to take the big expansion in stride and I did not lose a case in the deal.\n\nBelow is a normal 303 case and a fireformed 306 Confederate Sabre.\n\nWhen the curator of the British Royal Armouries Museum Leeds found out about them he wrote me and asked me to send him dummy rounds for inclusion in their collection of 303 Variants."
