You know where you are with the Cooke look, its consistent and pleasing.”\n\nEdward Gibbs | Director of Photography\n\nHistory\n\nFor over 100 years, Cooke has been at the centre of the filmmaking business, listening to the community of which we are a part. Starting with the Cooke triplet in 1893, we have become ingrained in the evolution of lenses and have been a key innovator in the history of motion pictures.\n\nCooke History\n\nThe Cooke Look™\n\nDeveloped over 100 years of optical innovation, the inimitable Cooke Look is recognised by cinematographers for its ability to convey the emotion of a visual story through light, colour and composition.\n\nThe Cooke Look"
