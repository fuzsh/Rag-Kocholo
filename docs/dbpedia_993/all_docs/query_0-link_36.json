        "text": "\"\"\n\nDavid L., | Marathon, WI\n\n\"They work really well. We were using trucks in the field and then we had a really wet summer, so we needed something to haul the sileage. The trucks can stay on the hard surface, and the tractors can do the field work. Our efficiency has gone up about 15-20%.\"\n\nBen Wohlgemuth | New Brunswick\n\n\"H&S has provided the best quality products over the years for me. From Load Kings to 7+4, they have met the challenge. H&S has been a great part to the local community, from job training to 4-H and FFA.\"\n\nWilliam Litzer | Marathon, WI\n\n\"“We just want to say thanks for making our life easier. One of our rakes is seventeen years old and performs as great as our other three newer ones.”\"\n\nBethers Farm | Torrington, WY\n\n\"H&S Top Shot is a good quality spreader.\"\n\nJacob Roskopf | Edgar, WI\n\n\"H&S forage wagons are made of great quality and with pride.\"\n\nDerek Grossman | Pittsville, WI\n\n\"H&S forage boxes are well built and easy to operate.\"\n\nGarrett Keem\n\n\"My H&S wrapper and manure spreader are both built very well.\"\n\nDaniel Thies | Westby, WI\n\n\"This was the first product from H&S that we purchased for our operation. We bought our 310 Manure Spreader back in 2000 and have used it almost weekly in the winter months. The durability of their equipment has made a lasting impression on our farm. We are very pleased with the H&S brand.\"\n\nIden Farms | Newark, OH\n\n\"Our H&S 430 manure spreader – Had it for 8 years now and love it! Great product!\"\n\nJordan Miller | Thomas, Oklahoma\n\n\"“H&S 425 manure spreader, largest spreader on the farm, is very useful for our 400-cow dairy operation!\"\n\nMackey Wright\n\n\"Switching to H&S rear unload wagons more than doubled our daily production over front unload wagons. Their simplicity and ease of maintenance as well was a big deal! Highly recommend these wagons to anyone putting up forage. These wagons will be here to stay!! Great product.\"\n\nAustin Moe\n\n\"Our 5 H&S chopper boxes have always treated us well and never skip a beat. Our H&S forage blower, 310 H&S manure spreader, and H&S Hay Tedder have all treated us well.\"\n\nSteven Salzmann | Marshfield, WI\n\n\"Great spreader and some nice upgrades from the Gehl patent!\"\n\nJacob Roskopf | Edgar, WI\n\n\"One of 3 we own. Best wagons we have run.\"\n\nClint van Hatten | Barneveld, NY\n\n\"“Bought new in 2017 and has been a great investment.”\"\n\nMike Gruneweld | Caroline, WI\n\n\"The H&S 6128 merger is so simple to use. It was a charm last year.\"\n\nErik Monjaraz | Zumbrota, MN\n\n\"My farm has been using H&S rakes for about ten years. Ever since we switched to H&S, we have had hardly any breakdowns. They are durable and made out of strong material. Overall, H&S is the nicest and best company to work with.\"\n\nMaddox Coffman\n\n\"We bought this spreader new in July of 2011. It spreads 2 loads of manure every day. It has been our best spreader we have ever had.\"\n\nCarter Allen | Smock, PA\n\n\" “Simple and easy to operate.”\"\n\nBruce Dobmeier | Freeport, MN\n\n\"We love our H&S live bottom Wide Body’s. They are a game changer when it comes to hauling crops.\"\n\nLynsey McKeen | Albion, ME\n\n\"I own a custom chopping business and ten years ago the first wagon that I started out with was an H&S 16ft combo box. It was used, but I’ve continued to use it every year since. Throughout the years I’ve purchased two more used ones and one brand-new Wide Body! They are reliable, easy to\"\n\nJake Walz | Glen Haven, WI\n\n\"If you are looking for a simple merger that makes clean, uniform rows, then the 6128 Twin-Flex Merger is the way to go. With minimal electronics it is super easy to run, and you can put a 100 HP tractor on it with no issues. We have been well-served by H&S equipment for many years.\"\n\nTyler Day | Arcade, NY\n\n\"We are a third-generation farm. Custom chopping and trucking is a large part of our operation. We also manage a large local dairy farm as well as milk two herds at two locations at our own farm. H&S equipment has been a longtime asset to our business. Our trucking end of our operation is constantly\"\n\nJohn Stevenson | Wayland, NY\n\n\"Ran across a couple thousand acres in 2020 with my H&S 7116. It’s the best rake I’ve ever baled behind. Every time I use it, I’m impressed ­– Windrows are smooth and clear of dirt, and it doesn’t leave anything behind when raking large heavy windrows for baleage. Absolutely love it!\"\n\nMichael Zimmerman | Markesan, WI\n\n\"“I started a bale wrapping business five years ago when I bought my first H&S wrapper. Since then, I have purchased a second bale wrapper and wouldn’t go with any other brands! Very easy to run!”\"\n\nEric Otte | Randolph, MN\n\n\"When H&S came out with the right-hand discharge, that’s what switched us to H&S for this size spreader because with right-hand discharge, all your controls are on the right side. I really like this spreader. I’ve had this one three years, it’s got over 12 million gallons through it. It holds up really well.\"\n\nKelly Reinart | Granton, WI\n\n\"My grandpa’s had H&S equipment and my dad has, and it’s proven itself throughout the years. Yes, we had some other brands in between there, but we’ve always gone back to the H&S because it just seems like they’re more durable and hold up a lot better.\"\n\nJohn Swenson, Marshfield, WI\n\n\"You guys know as well as I do in the wintertime, when it’s real cold, that takes a lot of stress on this thing. I’ve got to use it every day in the wintertime, cold or not. It’s reliable and I got good service where I bought it from, so it works.\"\n\nDennis Hemmersbach | Norwalk, WI\n\n\"We bought one 425 back in 2006. It was a really good spreader and we liked it so much that we decided to go back with another one. They’re easy to use, there’s not a lot of moving parts, it’s low-maintenance. Winters in Wisconsin get cold, and they don’t freeze up.\"\n\nVictor Goettl | Chippewa Falls, WI"
