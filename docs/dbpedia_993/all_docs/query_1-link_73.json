        "text": "Introducing, Air Fryer Eggs! The easiest way to make eggs, whichever way you like them! This easy air fryer recipe will help you make soft-boiled, hard-boiled, or jammy eggs in the air fryer in just a matter of minutes! Make for meal prep, for recipes like egg salad or deviled eggs, breakfast, or just an easy on-the-go snack!\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nToggle\n\nWhat Makes This Recipe Great\n\nBy now, you know how much I love my air fryer. It’s such an easy, no-mess way to make so many different recipes. I’ve made Air Fryer Potato Wedges, these juicy Pork Chops, Shrimp, Halibut, and even Air Fryer Filet Mignon! Every recipe blows me away with how delicious, quick, and easy it is. Making eggs in the air fryer is no different! Such a great hack.\n\nWith a family of five, we eat a lot of eggs. So I set out to see how my air fryer could transform eggs into the delicious, nutritious, hard-boiled eggs we all love. What I realized, is that it can do way more than that! This recipe will help you make jammy eggs, air fryer soft-boiled eggs, or hard-boiled eggs– however you need them cooked, there’s a way to do it!\n\nEasy to peel, perfect for meal prepping, make-ahead, and storing, these air fryer hard-boiled eggs will literally change your life! Let’s get air frying!\n\nIngredient Notes\n\nEggs: Use whatever eggs you have on hand. For bigger batches, I’ve found that Costco has really good prices on Organic, pasture-raised eggs. If you have a bigger family or just make a lot of egg recipes, check them out!\n\nIce Bath: You’ll need a bowl filled with ice cubes and water. This helps the eggs from cooking further and makes them easy to peel!\n\nAir Fryer: I use this one by Ninja. In order to get to 270, I had to set it to “reheat” rather than “air fry”. Keep this in mind if you have a similar issue.\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\n\nPreheat your air fryer to 270 degrees for 2 minutes.\n\nAdd the eggs to your air fryer basket in a single layer. I added 8 eggs.\n\nAir fry for 15 minutes for hard-boiled eggs with thoroughly cooked yolks. Alternatively, you can cook for 9 minutes for very soft with slightly runny whites, 11 minutes for jammy eggs, or 13 minutes for just slightly undercooked yolks.\n\nRemove the eggs from the air fryer and Immediately transfer them to an ice bath (a bowl of water and ice) to halt cooking. Let them sit in the ice bath for 2 + minutes.\n\nPeel and serve!\n\nExpert Tips\n\nAir Fryer: If your air fryer doesn’t go below 300 degrees, that’s ok! You will just need to subtract 1-2 minutes from the recommended cooking times. In order to use 270 on my air fryer I need to select “reheat” instead of “air fry”. Check your instruction manual to see if your air fryer has any functions like this.\n\nIce Bath: Don’t skip the ice bath! This is important to prevent overcooking and to help them peel easily.\n\nLeave Space: Make sure not to overcrowd your air fryer. You’ll need space between each egg to ensure proper cooking.\n\nCook Times: Keep in mind that the cook times will vary depending on how to like your eggs. For air fryer soft boiled eggs with slightly runny whites: 9 minutes. For jammy eggs, 11 minutes. For just slightly undercooked yolks: 13 minutes. For hard “boiled”, 15 minutes. Feel free to play around with these times when you get comfortable and have a preference that isn’t listed here.\n\nServing Tips\n\nUse this magical method to make my Deviled Egg Potato Salad, these Bacon Ranch Deviled Eggs, or serve them with a side of this Easy Homemade Sausage and Air Fryer Home Fries for the perfect air fryer breakfast!\n\nYou can also slice and serve these air fryer eggs on top of a salad or eat them for a snack with salt and pepper. You really can’t go wrong!\n\nTo use fewer yolks in your recipes, simply slice the egg in half, discard the yolks, and use the whites.\n\nStorage Tips\n\nStore your air fryer eggs in the refrigerator in an airtight container or ziptop bag for up to 7 days.\n\nRecipe FAQs\n\nHow long should you cook eggs in the air fryer?\n\nHard-boiled eggs with thoroughly cooked yolks: 15 minutes.\n\nJust slightly undercooked yolks: 13 minutes.\n\nJammy eggs: 11 minutes.\n\nVery soft with slightly runny whites: 9 minutes.\n\nMy egg yolks look discolored. Can I still eat them?\n\nYes! You may notice a little hint of green in your yolk. This simply means they’re a bit overcooked. Still totally safe to eat, but the yolk might be drier than you prefer.\n\nLove this recipe? Please leave a 5-star 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 rating in the recipe card below & a review in the comment section.
