        "text": "\"Our Song\" is the eleventh track from American singer and songwriter Taylor Swift's self-titled debut studio album, Taylor Swift, released on October 24, 2006, through Big Machine Records. The song became the third single from the album on September 9, 2007.\n\nBackground[]\n\nSwift self-penned \"Our Song\" for the talent show of her freshman year in high school with no intentions of including it on her debut album.[1] She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show, the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates.[2] \"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one\", she said.[3] The writing process, as with her lead single \"Tim McGraw\", took place in approximately twenty minutes.[3] Several months after performing it at the talent show, some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show, singing a few lines.[2] \"They'd only heard it once, so I thought, 'There must be something here!'\", Swift recalled.[2] When choosing tracks to record for Taylor Swift, Swift \"stood by\" \"Our Song\", repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her. She claimed she \"knew there was something about it.\"[3] She concluded, \"I think there's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it's bouncing.\"[3] Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on Taylor Swift due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase \"Play it again\", which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album. Big Machine Records executives chose \"Our Song\" to be the third single from Taylor Swift, which Swift was surprised[1] yet glad about.[3] The song was released as a CD single on August 22, 2007.[4] \"Our Song\" was introduced to countries outside of Canada and the United States in the international version of Swift's second studio album, Fearless.\n\nComposition[]\n\n\"Our Song\" is a country music song with a length of three minutes and twenty-two seconds.[5] It is set in compound time with eight eighth notes per bar and has a moderately fast tempo of 96 beats per minute.[6] However, Sean Dooley of About.com described \"Our Song\" as a snappy midtempo number.[7] The song is written in the key of D major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from G3 to B4.[6] Jody Rosen of Slant Magazine considers Swift's vocal performance to be twangful.[8] It follows the chord progression D–Em7–G–A.[6] The song's instrumentation relies mainly on banjo[9] and, after the completion of the break, a violin solo arrives.[10]\n\nThe lyrics are in first person.[7] In the first verse, the protagonist realizes she and her boyfriend do not have a song of their own as he drives his car.[11][7] The young couple come to using the events in their lives in place of a regular song in the song's refrains.[11] Those events are described in sharp detail and include slamming screen doors to sneak out late.[8] Dooley identified Swift's role in \"Our Song\" to be a narrator.[7]\n\nCritical reception[]\n\n\"Our Song\" was met with great appraise from contemporary critics. Sean Dooley of About.com listed \"Our Song\" as Swift's fifth best song to date.
