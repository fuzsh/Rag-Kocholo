        "text": "This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of musical compositions or pieces of music that have unusual time signatures. \"Unusual\" is here defined to be any time signature other than simple time signatures with top numerals of 2, 3, or 4 and bottom numerals of 2, 4, or 8, and compound time signatures with top numerals of 6, 9, or 12 and bottom numerals 4, 8, or 16.[1]\n\nThe conventions of musical notation typically allow for more than one written representation of a particular piece. The chosen time signature largely depends upon musical context, personal taste of the composer or transcriber, and the graphic layout on the written page. Frequently, published editions were written in a specific time signature to visually signify the tempo for slow movements in symphonies, sonatas, and concerti.\n\nA perfectly consistent unusual metrical pattern may be notated in a more familiar time signature that does not correspond to it. For example, the Passacaglia from Britten's opera Peter Grimes consists of variations over a recurring bass line eleven beats in length but is notated in ordinary 4\n\n4 time, with each variation lasting 2+3⁄4 bars, and therefore commencing each time one crotchet earlier in the bar than the preceding one.[2]\n\nUpper number of 1\n\n[edit]\n\nEnigma Variations by Edward Elgar, in Variation VII.[3]\n\nEntr'actes and Sappho Fragments by Harrison Birtwistle.[4]\n\nLeopardi Fragments by Peter Maxwell Davies.[5]\n\nMixtur by Karlheinz Stockhausen.[6]\n\nRhythmicana by Henry Cowell, for the entire first two movements.[7]\n\nString Quartet No. 2 by Easley Blackwood Jr.[5]\n\nSymphony No. 2 by Alexander Borodin.
