        "text": "We offer a two-year warranty against defects in materials or workmanship on all Industry Nine products. Product must be purchased new from authorized dealer, valid for the original owner exclusively. Industry Nine will repair or replace, at our discretion, any affected components or assemblies. The warranty will apply to stems, MatchStix, hub shells, axles, drive mechanisms, spokes, and rims.\n\nIndustry Nine will not be able to provide warranty support or assume liability for hubs or wheels that are utilized outside of their intended purpose. This warranty covers materials and workmanship but does not cover normal wear and tear, such as bearing wear, or damage due to lack of proper service intervals.\n\nSpokes will be warranted against defects, but not trail accidents, drivetrain/frame mechanical failure, or foreign object intrusion.\n\nAluminum rims are covered under the two-year warranty but are not warrantied for impact or crash damage. Use of non-authorized aftermarket adaptors and/or modification of axles, hubs, spokes or any other component may result in a voided warranty. Modification of rim finish or graphics by use of stripping solvents or chemicals will void rim warranty. Use of tire inserts, tire casing type or tire air pressure being ridden does not alter or modify this warranty. Alloy rims can still be susceptible to impact damage when riding inserts, and/or using tires with heavy duty casings, and/or inflated to higher pressures.\n\nWe believe in our product and will try to give Industry Nine customers the benefit of the doubt in any case where the cause of failure is undetermined."
