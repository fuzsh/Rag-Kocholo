        "text": "APPLICANTS WHO ARE 15-17 YEARS OLD\n\nIf a permit is issued to a person under 21 years of age that person must hold the permit for 6 months before applying for a road test and are prohibited from using a cellular phone while operating with a permit.\n\nIf a permit is issued to a person under 21 years of age, they must log 70 hours of driving and 10 of the hours must be done after dark.\n\nIf a permit expires, the person must take an exam for a new permit, but will not be required to wait before applying for a road test. The restriction from using a cellular phone still applies.\n\nTo apply for your driver's license, you must be at least 16 years of age and have completed an approved driver education course. You must successfully complete a road test. You are required to complete 70 hours of practice driving, which must include 10 hours of night driving, and have held your learner's permit for at least six months. The 70 hours of practice driving must begin after you have been issued a learner's permit. You must be accompanied by a supervising driver who is at least 20 years old and has held a license for at least two years.\n\nA license issued to a person under the age of 18 is an intermediate license, which prohibits the licensee from the following:\n\nA. Carrying passengers other than immediate family members (grandparent; stepgrandparent; parent; stepparent; spouse; child; stepchildren; brother; sister; stepbrother; stepsister) unless accompanied by a licensed operator who meets the requirements of Title 29-A, 1304, subsection 1, paragraph E. For the purpose of this paragraph, \"immediate family member\" includes the following when living with the immediate family:\n\nA foreign exchange student;\n\nA person who is under court-appointed guardianship of an immediate family member; and\n\nA child whose parent is deployed for military service and is under guardianship of an immediate family member as provided on a United States Department of Defense Armed Forces Family Care Plan, DA Form 5305 or its successor form.\n\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, \"deployed for military service\" means assigned to active military duty with the state military forces, as defined in Title 37-B, section 102, or the United States Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, whether pursuant to orders of the Governor or the President of the United States, when the duty assignment is in a combat theater, in an area where armed conflict is taking place or in an area away from a person's normal duty station;\n\nB. Operating a motor vehicle between the hours of 12 a.m. and 5 a.m.; and\n\nC. Operating a motor vehicle while using a mobile telephone.\n\nA person must hold an intermediate license for 270 days from the date the license was originally issued before they can receive an unrestricted license.\n\nDuring the intermediate license period, violation of these license restrictions, will result in the extension of the intermediate license restrictions and license suspension. An operator's license is considered a provisional license for two years following initial issuance. The intermediate restrictions (A, B and C above) do not apply after 270 days, but a conviction for any moving violation during the two year provisional license term will still result in license suspension.\n\nAPPLICANTS WHO ARE 18-20 YEARS OLD\n\nIf a permit is issued to a person under 21 years of age, that person must hold the permit for 6 months before applying for a road test and are prohibited from using a handheld electronic device or mobile telephone while operating with a permit.\n\nIf a permit is issued to a person under 21 years of age, they must log 70 hours of driving and 10 of the hours must be done after dark.\n\nIf a permit expires, the person must take an exam for a new permit, but will not be required to wait before applying for a road test. The restriction from using a handheld electronic device or mobile telephone still applies.\n\nIf you are 18 years of age or older, you are not required to complete driver education.\n\nYou must successfully complete a road test. If you are under 21 years of age, you are required to complete 70 hours of practice driving, which must include 10 hours of night driving, and have held your learner's permit for at least six months. The 70 hours of practice driving must begin after you have been issued a learner's permit. You must be accompanied by a supervising driver who is at least 20 years old and has held a license for at least two years.\n\nThe first license issued to a new applicant who is between the ages of 16-20 is a juvenile provisional license for a period of two years. The provisional license is in effect for a full 2-year period as long as the first license that was issued occurred prior to the 21st birthday. The provisional phase does not end when a person turns 21. If you are a juvenile provisional license holder and are within the first two years of your license, a conviction for any moving violation will result in the suspensions listed below. Additionally, if you are convicted of operating under the influence prior to reaching 21 years of age, your license will be viewed as a juvenile provisional license for law enforcement purposes, even if you have already held the license for two years.\n\nAPPLICANTS WHO ARE 21+ YEARS OLD\n\nIf you are 21 years of age or older, you are not required to complete a driver education course or log driving hours.\n\nIf a permit is issued to a person 21 years of age and over, that person does not have to wait 6 months before applying for a road test, however, they are prohibited from using a handheld electronic device or mobile telephone while operating with a permit."
