Bearcat,

What do you do w/ the gun ?

Is it a gun you hike in the mountains with,or a more stationary gun ?

I'm going to rebarrel my 25-06 to AI soonish and being that i'll tote it quite a bit i'm going to go w/a 26". Mike

If you are looking for light weight and compact, don't hesitate to be in the 18-20 inch range.

I hunt with specialty handguns and you still get great performance and accuracy with the shorter barrels.

What distances do you want to be able to connect at?

What I'm looking for really is this: I have a rifle that is chambered in 270 Win it could use a little "accuratizing" work. Currently it has a 24" sporter weight barrel on it, I would like to have it set back and recut to 270AI this would roughly make it 23.75" long. Is that length able to use the extra the AI provides or is it a waste? As far as the distance I want it to be capable of it would be a long range desert/mountain rifle. Antelope/Mule deer/Elk/Black bear gun. Thanks
