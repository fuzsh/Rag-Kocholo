Construction Timeline

I-270 started being built in the late 1960s. The section from I-70 to Vasquez opened by 1968, and it opened up to I-76 by 1970. As originally built, I-270 started at a trumpet interchange on I-76 just east of I-25. Two lanes from eastbound I-76 blended off and become I-270, while from I-270 the two lanes merged onto westbound I-76, but those immediately became the exit lanes for northbound I-25 and westbound US 36.

Westbound US 36 connection history: In September 1999, the connection from WB I-270 to NB I-25 opened. If you wanted US 36, you still had to take the former route that mainline I-270 took west onto I-76. Then in mid-February 2000, the full westbound connection finally opened. Also opening was an exit from WB I-270 to Broadway. At the same time, several other things happened: A new exit from I-76 westbound to I-270 westbound opened, and the preexisting exit from westbound I-76 to NB I-25 and WB US 36 closed. Also the ramp from WB US 36 to Broadway closed, replaced by a new exit from NB I-25 to 70th Avenue .

As for the eastbound connection, the full connection from US 36 to EB I-270 opened August 16, 2003. No other ramp openings or closings happened with that, though.

December 12, 1965 Construction of I-270 begins. Major structures include twin bridges to take I-270 over Dahlia Street , a bridge to carry Quebec Street over I-270 and another two to take I-270 over I-70. Cost: $1.4 million for structures and $1.3 million for paving; Contractor: L.H. Kilgroe Construction Co. of Denver .

August 2, 1968 A three-mile segment of I-270 between Vasquez Boulevard and I-70 opens to traffic.

October 23, 1970 A two-mile segment of I-270 opens to traffic between I-80 (I-76) and US 85, adjoining the three-mile segment already in service. This segment completes the 5.2 mile circumferential route.

April 1993 Construction begins to extend I-270 from I-76 to the I-25/US 36 interchange.

March 2004 Cost: $21 million Contractor: SEMA Construction Co., Inc. Work: Constructed a flyover ramp from southbound I-25 to eastbound I-270 and reconstructed southbound I-25 in concrete between 84 th Avenue and I-76.

Future Cost: $15 million Contractor: Yet to be determined Work: Constructs a flyover ramp from eastbound I-270 to eastbound I-76. Duration: On hold (depend on funding) - This is the final phase of this Strategic Transportation Project.
