Step by step solution

01

Understand the given data

The lengths of human pregnancies are normally distributed with a mean \( \mu = 266 \) days and a standard deviation \( \sigma = 16 \) days.

02

Standardize the values

Use the Z-score formula \( Z = \frac {X - \mu} {\sigma} \) to convert the raw scores into Z-scores.

03

Proportion of pregnancies lasting more than 270 days

Calculate the Z-score for 270 days: \( Z = \frac {270 - 266} {16} = \frac {4} {16} = 0.25 \). Look up the Z-score in the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding probability (P(Z < 0.25)). The value is approximately 0.5987. Hence, the proportion lasting more than 270 days is \( 1 - 0.5987 = 0.4013 \).

04

Proportion of pregnancies lasting less than 250 days

Calculate the Z-score for 250 days: \( Z = \frac {250 - 266} {16} = \frac {-16} {16} = -1 \). Look up this Z-score in the standard normal distribution table to find P(Z < -1). The value is approximately 0.1587. Thus, the proportion lasting less than 250 days is 0.1587.

05

Proportion of pregnancies lasting between 240 and 280 days

Calculate the Z-scores for 240 and 280 days: \( Z_{240} = \frac {240 - 266} {16} = -1.625 \) and \( Z_{280} = \frac {280 - 266} {16} = 0.875 \). Find the cumulative probabilities from the Z-table: P(Z < -1.625) ≈ 0.052 and P(Z < 0.875) ≈ 0.809. Hence, the proportion is \( 0.809 - 0.052 = 0.757 \).

06

Probability of a pregnancy lasting more than 280 days

From Step 5, P(Z < 0.875) ≈ 0.809. Thus, P(Z > 0.875) = \( 1 - 0.809 = 0.191 \).

07

Probability of a pregnancy lasting no more than 245 days

Calculate the Z-score for 245 days: \( Z = \frac {245 - 266} {16} = \frac {-21} {16} = -1.3125 \). Look up this Z-score in the Z-table to find P(Z < -1.3125). The value is approximately 0.0948 or 9.48%.

08

Interpret 'very preterm' babies

Calculate the Z-score for 224 days: \( Z = \frac {224 - 266} {16} = -2.625 \). The Z-score table shows that P(Z < -2.625) is about 0.0043 or 0.43%. Since this is a very low proportion, 'very preterm' babies are considered unusual.

Key Concepts

These are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.

normal distribution

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most fundamental probability distributions in statistics. It describes how data is distributed around a mean (average) value. In the context of pregnancy lengths, the mean \( \mu = 266 \ \text{days} \) represents the average duration of a pregnancy.

The standard deviation \( \sigma = 16 \ \text{days} \) describes how spread out the pregnancy lengths are around this mean. A smaller standard deviation would mean that most pregnancy durations are close to the mean, while a larger standard deviation would indicate more variability. In a normal distribution:

About 68% of data falls within one standard deviation (\( \mu \ \pm \sigma \)) of the mean.

About 95% of data falls within two standard deviations (\( \mu \ \pm 2 \sigma \)) of the mean.

Almost all (99.7%) of the data lies within three standard deviations (\( \mu \ \pm 3 \sigma \)) of the mean.

Understanding these properties helps in calculating the probabilities for different ranges of data, like determining the proportion of pregnancies lasting a certain number of days.

Z-score

A Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is a way to standardize data points from different normal distributions to make them comparable. The formula for the Z-score is:

\[ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]

Where:

X is the value in the dataset.

µ is the mean of the dataset.

σ is the standard deviation of the dataset.

For example, to find the proportion of pregnancies lasting more than 270 days, we calculate the Z-score for 270 days:

\[ Z = \frac{270 - 266}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = 0.25 \]

This Z-score tells us that 270 days is 0.25 standard deviations above the mean. With the Z-score, we can then use a Z-table to find the corresponding cumulative probability.

cumulative probability table

A cumulative probability table, also known as a Z-table, helps find the probability that a standard normally distributed random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. This table lists cumulative probabilities for Z-scores.

For our Z-score of 0.25, the Z-table gives us a value of about 0.5987, meaning there is a 59.87% chance that a pregnancy lasts less than 270 days. To find the probability of a pregnancy lasting more than 270 days, we subtract this value from 1:

\[ 1 - 0.5987 = 0.4013 \]

This means approximately 40.13% of pregnancies last more than 270 days. By using the Z-table for various Z-scores, we can find probabilities for different situations, such as pregnancies lasting less than 250 days or between 240 and 280 days. The Z-table is a powerful tool for translating Z-scores into meaningful probabilities, facilitating several statistical analyses.
