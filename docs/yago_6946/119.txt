"It was like an end of an era to see the show end. When I went to the finale party it was great to see so much of the crew that was still involved. The fact they they were able to keep it such a viable show for eight seasons is great. We didn’t think it was going to get past season two."

Role on 24[]

Clarke auditioned for the role of Nina Myers at the last minute. She got the role on the day that filming began. Since the wardrobe department didn't have time to fit her, she had to wear her own outfit for the entire season of filming. Clarke was part of the main cast for the whole first season. She returned to the role on Seasons 2 and 3, appearing in a total of 36 episodes.

Director Jon Cassar reported that while Clarke's acting abilities came naturally, she still had to be trained for the various firearm scenes during filming.

During the filming of the first season of 24, Clarke met actor Xander Berkeley who played George Mason. They married shortly after and have starred together in films like The Third Date, Below the Belt, and Alibi. On television, they starred together in Wainy Days and on Karen Sisco, also with Thomas Kretschmann. On September 23, 2006, Clarke gave birth to their first girl, Olwyn Harper Berkeley.
