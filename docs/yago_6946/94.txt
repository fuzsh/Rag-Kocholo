24 alumni Sarah Clarke, 35, and Xander Berkeley, 48, may not have gotten along on-screen as Nina and George, but that doesnâ€™t carry over to their personal life! The couple posed with their daughter Olwyn Harper, 13 months, at The PS Arts Express Yourself 10th Anniversary on Sunday. Sarah and Xander married in 2002, a year after meeting on the set of the show.
