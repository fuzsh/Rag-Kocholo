Some of you may remember that Xander Berkeley and his wife Sarah Clarke bought the former John "Bill" Wadsworth farm house at 495 River Road, Hiram, from Miguel Leibovich five years ago when they were living in Los Angeles and spent summers there with their two daughters.

They have since moved to Maine outside Portland and are renovating the farm for film production and the Shade of the Elm Inn in Limerick for a hotel and set.

Xander is an award winning actor. He and Sarah played protagonists in the film The Maestro, which is showing Thursday, June 13th, at the State Theater in Portland. Meet and greet them at 6:00 cocktail hour reception, 7:00 screening. They invite you and your friends to attend.

Read more about the event and about Xander and Sarah. Tickets $10, general seating.

The Maestro

Xander Berkeley plays Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco the highly notable composer of over 200 Hollywood films in the 1940’s and 1950’s, who, with his wife (played by Sarah Clarke)was exiled from Mussolini’s Italy. Mario went on to mentor some of the greatest film composers of 20th Century including Henry Mancini, John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Andre Previn and Randy Newman. While revealing the precarious, and perilous journey of the artist, the film shows how a great teacher helps a student find their unique voice, and bring it forth.
