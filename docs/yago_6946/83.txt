Sarah Clarke

Born: February 16, 1972 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA

Married to: Xander Berkeley (7 September 2002 – present) (2 children)

In one of her guest appearances on 24 (2001), Clarke’s character, Nina’s (fake) passport picture is brought up on a screen during a CTU meeting, and the name next to the picture reads “Sarah Berkeley,” Clarke’s married name. The information shown on the passport, however, is not Clarke’s real information (birthdate, etc).

I love Xander’s voice so much that I listen to his voice mails over and over.
