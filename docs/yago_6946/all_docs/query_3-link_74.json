        "text": "I love reading psychological thrillers and have always dreamed of becoming an author in the genre, but I took my time getting here. After studying for a degree in Politics & International Relations, travelling the world for 6 years, and completing 5 ski seasons, I moved to London and became a copywriter, wife and mother. I joined HQ Digital in March 2021 and my debut novel A MOTHER NEVER LIES published later that year. It quickly became a best-seller and stayed in the Kindle top 100 for over six weeks. Since then I have published EVERY LITTLE SECRET, MY PERFECT FRIEND and my first destination thriller - THE SKI TRIP - and I'm currently writing my fifth thriller, which will be published in spring 2024.
