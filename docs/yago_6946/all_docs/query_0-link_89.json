        "text": "BIRTHS Giving love a good name, Jon Bon Jovi, 40, and karate-instructor wife Dorothea, 39, welcomed their third child, 9-pound 4-ounce son Jacob, May 7, in Monmouth County, N.J.\n\nENGAGED Hoping to make 24 last a lifetime, stars of the spy drama Sarah Clarke and Xander Berkeley announced their engagement. The couple, who met on the show, will tie the knot Sept. 7.\n\nWEDDINGS ”What I Really Meant to Say” was ”I do.” Country starlet Cyndi Thomson, 25, married her guitarist, Daniel Goodman, 26, May 11 in Nashville. It’s the first marriage for both.\n\nDEALS So, there is life after Glitter. On May 9, sometimes-dotty diva Mariah Carey, 32, who’s been without a label since Virgin Records bought the singer out of her contract in January, signed a $20 million, three-album contract with Vivendi’s Island/Def Jam division. Carey called the deal an ”unprecedented opportunity.”\n\nARRESTS Say a little prayer for soul-singing Psychic Friend Dionne Warwick, 61, who was charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession May 12 after she allegedly tried to sneak 11 joints through Miami International Airport in her lipstick case. In a statement, Warwick’s spokesman denied the charges, adding that she ”looks forward to having her day in court to clear her good name.” The Grammy winner is the cousin of Whitney Houston, 38, who herself was embroiled in an airport pot scandal last year and eventually cleared of all charges…. Maybe she was looking for Mr. Goodbar. On May 9, a Manhattan judge granted Richard Gere, 52, a restraining order against German expatriate Ursula Reichert-Habbishaw, 51, and charged her with misdemeanor harassment and stalking. Over the last year, Reichert-Habbishaw allegedly made 100 calls and six unwanted visits to the Unfaithful star’s New York City production office. At press time, she was in jail pending a May 16 hearing; her lawyer says she’s ”devastated and just wants to go home.” Gere had no comment.\n\nCOURTS On May 9 in L.A., psychologist Delinah Blake, 35, the daughter of actor Robert Blake, won temporary custody of her half sister, 23-month-old Rose Lenore. The incarcerated Baretta star is accused of committing the 2001 murder of his wife — the infant’s mother, Bonny Lee Bakley — a charge he denies. Bakley’s family did not object to Delinah’s custody petition…. On May 9, a Florida judge dismissed the August 2000 lawsuit that relatives of late Andrea Gail captain Billy Tyne brought against Warner Bros., accusing the studio of falsely depicting Tyne and his crew as ”unseaworthy” in 2000’s The Perfect Storm. (George Clooney portrayed Tyne.) The family’s lawyer says his clients will appeal the decision…. On May 13, widow Lee Anderson Minnelli, 94, dropped a suit against stepdaughter Liza Minnelli, 56. The stepmom had accused the newlywed chanteuse of selling her house out from under her and failing to pay her servants, among other offenses. Liza had no comment…. On May 9, Gone With the Wind author Margaret Mitchell’s heirs reached an undisclosed settlement with Houghton Mifflin, publisher of Alice Randall’s unauthorized The Wind Done Gone. The estate held that the book violated their copyright and sought to halt its publication. Done Gone, which takes the perspective of Civil War-era slaves, remains on the shelves…. On May 13, the parents of the late singer-actress Aaliyah Haughton sued their daughter’s label, Virgin Records. They claim Virgin knew about the alleged inexperience of the pilot of the plane that crashed last year in the Bahamas, killing the 22-year-old star and eight others, just after she had completed a video shoot. Michael and Diane Haughton seek unspecified damages. In a statement, Virgin insisted it’s not to blame for the ”terrible tragedy.”… Days after rapper Jay-Z (a.k.a. Shawn Carter), 32, abruptly dropped plans to buy advertising exec Peter Arnell’s $6.5 million penthouse in Manhattan’s TriBeCa district, Arnell reportedly sued his neighbors — Lynn Fisher Hill and Lewis Taffer — for sabotaging the deal. Arnell claims that the neighbors posted newspaper clips in the building’s lobby noting Jay-Z’s brushes with the law, offending the performer and causing him to back out. Neither Jay-Z, Arnell, nor Hill could be reached; Taffer declined to comment."
