William Clarke\n\nID: I04150\n\nName: Sarah\n\nSex: F\n\nName: Sarah Holton?\n\nBirth: ABT 1611 in England\n\nDeath: 16 SEP 1675 in Northampton, Hampshire, Mass.\n\nNote: Sarah, is listed as Sarah Holton in \"The Parson Family\" by Henry Parsons; 1920 (p. 58). William Holton of Hartford and Northampton was probably baptised October 20, 1610, Nayland Church, Parish of Holton St.Marys, County Suffolk, England. He came to New England in \"The Frances\", sailing from Ipswitch, England in April 1634, when he was 23 years old. A descendant from Iowa discovered that Holton had a sister Sarah baptised in Nayland but it is not known what happened to her. William Holton is buried next to the Clarks at Bridge Street Cemetery, Northampton. William Holton spent some time in Maine (see Warner Ancestry) and William Pynchon, Esq. Had large interests in Maine. Somewhere Lt. Clarke became well acquainted with the Indians; their customs, language, etc. and he seems to have somehow been connected with Pynchon.\n\nMarriage 1 William Clarke b: ABT 1609 in Dorsetshire, England\n\nMarried: ABT 1636\n\nChildren\n\nSarah Clark b: 21 JUN 1638 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nJonathan Clark b: 10 OCT 1639 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nNathaniel Clark b: 27 JAN 1641 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nExperience Clark b: 30 MAR 1643 in Northampton, Hampshire, Mass.\n\nIncrease Clark b: 1 MAR 1646 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nRebecca Clark b: 1649 in Northampton, Hampshire, Mass.\n\nJohn Clark b: 1 MAY 1651 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nSamuel Clark b: 23 OCT 1653 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nWilliam Clarke b: 3 JUL 1656 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\nSarah Clark b: 19 MAR 1659 in Dorchester, Suffolk, Mass.\n\n__________________________________\n\nElder John Stronge is the son of John (Richard) Stronge and Eleanor Deane. John (Richard) Stronge died before the birth of his youngest child in 1613. This is well documented in his will. .\n\nAfter John (Richard) Stronge's death, his wife, Eleanor Deane, daughter of a tanner, married William Cogan (a tanner by trade) before the birth of John (Richard) Stronge's offspring by Eleanor in 1613. Following a west country tradition, the daughter is christened \"Eleanor,\" after her mother. Though she is a \"Stronge\" by blood, William Cogan refers to her as \"my daughter,\" and raises her as such with the name Eleanor Cogan. .\n\nYoung (Elder) John Stronge learns the tanning trade from William Cogan and Eleanor Deane's father, Walter Deane. Sarah Stronge, the future wife of Lt. William Clarke, was born in 1613 to Thomas Stronge, the brother of Elder John Stronge's father. This makes Sarah Stronge the cousin of Elder John Stronge."
