        "text": "Have you ever wondered why so many actors date other actors? It's not just because anyone who isn't an actor wouldn't be able to hack their partners making out with someone else on a daily basis. It's because their on-screen chemistry often leads to real-life romance.\n\nWhile most of these TV couples arise from being part of a fictional relationship, romance has often blossomed between cast members who never actually had any romantic connection on screen.\n\nHere are some of the most unexpected real-life romances between TV actors that you might not have known about:\n\n1. Dominic Monaghan and Evangeline Lilly (Lost)\n\nThey may never have shared anything that could be considered close to a romantic scene, but DoMo and Evie got it on soon after joining the cast of Lost as Charlie and Kate in 2004.\n\nThey are thought to have dated for about three years, before breaking up (shortly after Dominic just happened to leave Lost). Very soon after, she was in a relationship with Lost production assistant Norman Kali, and they welcomed a son in 2011.\n\nIt doesn't look like they had an amicable break-up, though. When a fan tweeted at Dominic about how good Evangeline was looking in The Hobbit, he threw a large dollop of shade at his ex, and seemed to claim that she cheated on him with Kali. Ouch.\n\n2. David Tennant and Georgia Moffett (Doctor Who)\n\nHaving previously dated one-off Who star Sophia Myles, DT later found romance with Georgia, who just happened to play his on-screen cloned daughter. Slightly icky yes, but still.\n\nThe couple married in 2011, and have had three children together: Olive, Wilfred and Doris.\n\nCool nerd fact: she also just happens to be the real-life daughter of Tennant's fellow Doctor, Peter Davison.\n\n3. Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisof (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)\n\nApparently, Alyson and Alexis made a pact that they would not make things awkward by dating while on the same show.\n\nAnd thus, while appearing in Buffy as Willow and Wesley, they had to keep their blossoming romance at bay. Thankfully, Alexis later joined the cast of spin-off Angel, allowing them to get together properly.\n\nThey later married in 2003, and have two daughters together: Satyana and Keeva. Say it with us now: awwww.\n\n4. Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere (Heroes)\n\nMilo may have played Hayden's on-screen uncle in Heroes and they may have had a 12-year age gap, but that didn't stop them having a relationship in 2008.\n\nHowever, just over a year later, the couple decided to call time on their romance and parted ways.\n\nHayden has since become engaged to boxer Wladimir Klitschko, and they have a daughter together.\n\n5. Chris Pratt and Emily Vancamp (Everwood)\n\nLong before they both became Marvel heroes, Chris and Emily met on the set of teen drama Everwood back in 2002.\n\nDespite playing brother and sister on the show, the pair started a relationship before breaking up in 2007.\n\nChris has since married fellow actor Anna Faris, while Emily is engaged to Revenge co-star Josh Bowman.\n\n6. Alyssa Milano and Brian Krause (Charmed)\n\nOn the fantasy drama, Brian actually played the husband of Alyssa's on-screen sister Piper (Holly Marie Combs).\n\nHowever, by the end of season three, he began a relationship with Alyssa, who played Piper's sister Phoebe. The romance came to an end by the conclusion of season four.\n\nAlyssa has since married Creative Artists Agency agent David Bugliari, and they have a son and a daughter.\n\n7. Sarah Clarke and Xander Berkeley (24)\n\nIn 24, Xander played Sarah's baddie character Nina's boss George Mason. While Nina was having an affair with Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer, she didn't have any romantic feelings for stuffy George.\n\nHowever, in reality, Sarah and Xander quickly found romance on the show and they got married in 2002. They have since had two daughters together."
