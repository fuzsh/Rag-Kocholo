        "text": "Heyyy, looky here. It's Xander Berkeley and Sarah Clarke (who played Maynard Eugley and Donna Eugley in the film).\n\nPhoto by Kay Stephens\n\nXander and Sarah invited me down to a little gathering they were holding at the Cornish Inn (a cozy, sweet inn they both own) to hang out with other writers and filmmakers for an evening. As the founders of Picture Maine, they are invested in growing Maine's film industry and to boost the current incentives that Maine currently offers. (You can see my past article for Pen Bay Pilot on that here.)\n\nBy the way, this is Xander behind the bar making me a specialty gin cocktail made from Luxardo, which we decided to call the \"LuxSharknado.\"\n\nAnd here is the luscious spread that Xander personally made for his guests including smoked bluefish, smoked salmon, caviar, gourmet crackers and cheese.\n\nMet some great people last night. Pictured here is Mark Selbo and his wife, Jule Selbo, a novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. Her latest book, 9 Days, a crime novel, featuring female investigator Dee Rommel, is just out!\n\nTime for a selfie. Standing with the very cool Amanda Bowers, an Emmy-nominated producer, part of Phiphen, an independently owned film and television production company. Center back is Patrick Roche, a freelance producer of Gesundheit Media and to the right, Sarah.\n\nWhat a beautiful October evening--about 72 degrees--and the bright fall colors on the trees. Standing here with Jule, Molly Conners, founder and CEO of Phiphen, Xander, and a really cool guy I met, president, founder of Mast Landing Brewing, Ian Hayden Dorsey.\n\nXander mic'd up, standing with Erin Ovalle, host of Maine Life, a production company in Portland. Erin came up to do a segment on Maine and the filmmaking community.\n\nAll the guys from Mast Landing Brewing, who were on hand to support the night's initiative. With Amanda to the right. Love that beer!"
