        "text": "It is often said that “Truth is stranger than fiction.” And this saying seems to work very well for several of The Twilight Saga’s actors, who are living such beautiful love stories, that they even surpass the romances they had onscreen.\n\nWe couldn’t help but sigh here at Bright Side as we created this list of 12 actors, along with their real-life partners, from Stephenie Meyer’s saga.\n\n1. Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) and Suki Waterhouse\n\nThe actor, who knew how to make us fall in love with his character Edward Cullen, has already found his better half. After dating Kristen Stewart, as well as the singer FKA Twigs, Pattinson began a relationship with the model Suki Waterhouse. They’ve been dating for 2 years now, and even though they prefer to keep their private lives as a secret, every time they show up together they seem very happy.\n\n2. Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) and Dylan Meyer\n\nAfter breaking up with model Stella Maxwell, Kristen fell in love again. And this new romance has nothing to envy when it comes to the love story that Bella and Edward lived in Twilight. The actress, who will play Princess Diana in her next film, is paired up with screenwriter Dylan Meyer, whom she met on a film set several years earlier. They met again on the birthday of a mutual friend and the connection between them was so strong that Stewart says she is ready to propose.\n\n3. Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black) and Taylor Dome\n\nTaylor Lautner is another of Twilight’s actors who, with his interpretation of Jacob Black, stole our heart. But his heart is already owned by Taylor Dome, a young nursing grad. Lautner took it upon himself to congratulate her with a romantic post on his Instagram account. Before Dome, Lautner had dated some celebrities like Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift.\n\n4. Ashley Greene (Alice Cullen) and Paul Khoury\n\nThe actress who gave life to Alice Cullen has paired herself up with TV presenter Paul Khoury. She had previously dated singer Joe Jonas. But, along with Khoury, Ashley seems to have finally found happiness, as they were married in 2018. “This is the most beautiful moment I could have ever hoped for. You’ve successfully made me the happiest, luckiest woman alive. I can’t wait to show you my unfaltering immeasurable love for the rest of our lives,” Greene wrote in her Instagram account after Paul orchestrated a magical proposal to her.\n\n5. Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen) and Brittany Gonzales\n\nLutz is another actor who has a dreamlike love relationship in real life. When he met model Brittany Gonzales, they knew they were made for each other. That’s why they got married in 2017 and recently announced that they are expecting a baby. For the ex-vampire, Gonzales is his best friend and his dream wife.\n\n6. Nikki Reed (Rosalie Hale) and Ian Somerhalder\n\nVampires seem to have taken root in Nikki Reed’s heart. The actress not only played Rosalie’s character in The Twilight Saga, but she also fell in love with actor Ian Somerhalder, star of the series The Vampire Diaries. Their love was born in 2014, they then confirmed their commitment in 2015, and got married that same year. For the wedding, the couple asked their guests to donate to their animal rescue organization instead of giving them gifts. They eventually announced that they were expecting their first daughter, Bodhi Soleil.\n\n7. Jackson Rathbone (Jasper Hale) and Sheila Hafsadi\n\nJackson has a beautiful family. He married Sheila Hafsadi in 2013, after already having a son together. And later on, the rest of the children began to arrive. The first one was born in 2012, they named him Monroe Jackson and chose Nikki Reed as his godmother. The second one arrived in 2016 and was named Presley Bowie. Finally, Sheila gave birth to Felix in 2019.\n\n8. Peter Facinelli (Carlisle Cullen) and Lily Harrison\n\n“A magical night with this incredible woman. A perfect ending to 2019,” Peter wrote on his Instagram account after proposing to his girlfriend during his vacation in Mazatlán, Mexico. The actor, who has 3 daughters with his ex-wife (actress Jennie Garth), now seems to have found the owner of his heart.\n\n9. Sarah Clarke (Renée Dwyer) and Xander Berkeley\n\nSarah Clarke not only played an important role in The Twilight Saga, she is also the protagonist of a real life love story. She met actor Xander Berkeley while filming the series 24, fell in love with him, and married him in 2002. They are the parents of 2 girls: Olwyn Harper and Rowan.\n\n10. Justin Chon (Eric Yorkie) and Sasha Egorova\n\nThis actor, who gave life to Bella’s friend Eric Yorkie, married Sasha Egorova in 2014 and they haven’t been apart from each other ever since. On December 31, 2017, they welcomed their first daughter.\n\n11. Christian Serratos (Angela Weber) and David Boyd\n\nChristian, who has Mexican heritage, is paired with David Boyd, lead singer of the alternative rock band New Politics. In 2017 they had a daughter named Wolfgang, who they don’t show much of on their social networks. But what we do know is that Serratos affectionately calls her “little W.”\n\n12. Michael Welch (Mike Newton) and Samantha Maggio\n\nWelch, who played another of Bella’s friends, married model Samantha Maggio in 2016, after proposing to her from a stage during a charity event in Beverly Hills. Together, the couple has a daughter.\n\nDid you know any of these actors’ significant others? We’d also love to read about your dreamy love stories in the comments!"
