        "text": "Thanks to Freestyle Digital Media, we’ve got an exclusive clip from the upcoming biopic The Maestro, which stars Xander Berkeley (The Walking Dead) as famed composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco; check it out below after the official synopsis…\n\nMario Castelnuovo-Tedesco was a highly notable composer of over 200 Hollywood films in the 1940’s and 1950’s. Often receiving zero credit for his work, Mario went on to mentor some of our greatest film composers including John Williams, Randy Newman, Henry Mancini, Jerry Goldsmith and Andre Previn. The film is based on letters that examine Tedesco’s teachings and his relationship with student Jerry Herst (played by newcomer Leo Marks), focusing on both the finer points of art and expression, as well as the realities of post-war Hollywood.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et8h3jicN6c\n\nThe Maestro is directed by Adam Cushman and stars Xander Berkeley (The Walking Dead), Leo Marks (The Last Tycoon), Sarah Clarke (Twilight, 24), Jon Polito (The Big Lebowski), Mackenzie Astin (The Magicians), Joelle Sechaud (Milky Way), William Russ (American History X), Jonathan Cherry (Final Destination 2), Michael Johnston (Teen Wolf), David J. Phillips (Amateur Night), Christopher Redman (God Friended Me), Raul S. Julia (The Hoax), Kim Bubbs (The Thing), Lucas Elliot Eberl (Letters from Iwo Jima), Bobby Campo (The Final Destination), Kristin Gutoskie (The Vampire Diaries) and Alex Essoe (Starry Eyes)."
