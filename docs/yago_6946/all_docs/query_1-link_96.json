Now in our 24th year, VFF is the first and longest-running film festival in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley and screens short films along with narrative and documentary feature films from around the world. In addition to film screenings, The Valley Film Festival mentors filmmakers through every stage of their careers, via our Focus On: series of educational panels and professional development seminars.\n\nThe Valley Film Festival was founded by Los Angeles native, and proud “Valley Girl,” Tracey Adlai, in 2000, to spotlight locally produced films in response to the San Fernando Valley’s attempt to secede from Los Angeles. VFF remains the first and continuously running film festival in The Valley and runs August 1-8, 2024 at the Laemmle NoHo 7 in North Hollywood.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ValleyFilmFest/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/valleyfilmfest/\n\nX.com: https://x.com/valleyfilmfest\n\nU.S. NARRATIVE COMPETITION\n\nA Little Family Drama, (United States) – Los Angeles Premiere.
