        "text": "Raymond Malone, Fairness and Construction Board, 414 E 12th Street, 4th Floor East Kcmo. ( LETTER BEING IGNORED) (PART II) April 16, 2024 Quinton Lucas, Mayor City Council, All Districts Cc: Brian Platt, City Manager Cc:Jaime Guillen, CREO Director City of Kansas City, Missouri City Hall, 29th (Mayor) Kansas City, Missouri 64106 Honorable Mayor and City Councilpersons, These illegal and unethical practices have also dissuaded business retention, growth and success for not only disadvantaged businesses but also majority owned businesses. As from the day the Fairness in Construction Board was established, passive participation in race, color, national origin and sex-based discrimination by our local government have re-emerged and has had a ripple effect within the construction community resulting in abusive procurement, oppressive fiscal policies and procedures. These divisive tactics are a direct result of the de factosilencing of the Fairness in Construction Board. The Board has been deprived of decades-long basic monitoring and reporting as required by City Code, Section 3-463(11). Specifically, the lack of transparency by the Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity Department Director and the Mayor’s office has adversely affected the Fairness in Construction Board’s ability to perform our duties effectively and enjoy a positive, inclusive atmosphere. Specific Concerns: 1. The Department lacks the basic operational ability to answer telephones and respond to messages, return calls or follow up when information is requested. Although the board has requested organizational information, including a Department organizational chart with contact numbers, roles and responsibilities information, none has been provided. 2. The Disparity Study remains a concern. To date we have received misleading or false information concerning the status of the study. We now have been informed that the solicitation was opened back up recently without any explanation. As you are aware, the MBE/WBE Program depends on a current and accurate study. 3. There have been multiple resolutions that are being considered by council that would directly affect the MBE/WBE ordinance (PNW, Size Stds, etc.) We were not made aware of these resolutions by the Department and when asked the Department staff seems to have little or no information. 4. The unequal treatment in city-funded and assisted construction projects and procurement procedures and the opportunities for certified, small disadvantaged firms particularly in the city departments and EDCKC-led projects. Specifically lack of uniform reporting and enforcement on city andincentivized projects. 5. Reports of hostile work environments on construction projects and failure of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity Department to respond and investigate pursuant to the duties under City Code, Chapter 3, Article IV and Chapter 38. Including the lack of investigation into abusive treatment and payment violations.\n\nRaymond Malone, Chairman Fairness in Construction Board 414 E 12th Street, 4th Floor East Kansas City, Missouri 64106 raymond.malone1943@gmail.com April 16, 2024 Quinton Lucas, Mayor City Council, All Districts Cc: Brian Platt, City Manager Cc:Jaime Guillen, CREO Director City of Kansas City, Missouri City Hall, 29th Floor (Mayor) City Hall, 22nd Floor (City Council) Kansas City, Missouri 64106 Honorable Mayor and City Councilpersons, Our past letters and messages to you to date have gone unanswered, therefore I’m forced to write this letter to informed you of our very real concerns. As the appointed Chair of the Fairness in Construction Board, who has always strived for excellence and professionalism, I find it necessary to address these issues in the hope of fostering a more inclusive and equitable contracting environment. As a reminder, the Fairness in Construction Board was created to address and remediate unfair public procurement procedures in both city funded and assisted projects, including tax incentivized projects. Particularly, the Fairness in Construction Board addresses disparities and exclusion of available and qualified socioeconomically disadvantaged businesses on publicly funded and assisted contracts. Through the implementation of the Fairness in Construction Board (“Board”), we have created a more competitive and fair environment for all. This is achieved through the collaborative process of the members of the Board. Being comprised of collective bargaining organizations, majority owned businesses, minority and woman owned businesses, construction business organizations, professional construction services organizations, and community input has created a partnership that promotes equal access, opportunity and protection of the laws of the city, state and federal government in public procurement. The strength of the Board has been transparency in data collection and reporting from the City’s Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity Department. After repeated requests, the Board has been denied access to reports, administrative support and monitoring of city-funded and assisted contracts, including tax-incentivized projects (such as the Meta data-center project and more recently the Google data-center project). This has caused an increase in complaints of discriminatory activity in public procurement processes, on construction projects and reports of economic abuse of small and disadvantaged businesses on taxpayer funded projects. Over the past several decades, I have encountered numerous instances of discrimination based on race, color, sex and national origin in construction and its contracting procedures. These instances have ranged from subtle biases to outright discriminatory actions. A few examples of why Prime contractors need to be monitored. Especially JE Dunn, Turner Construction and McCownGordon in Kansas City Missouri our Disparity report displays discrimination. Mayor ignores Kcmo Fairness Board.\n\nAlex Hormozi is talking here about trailblazers and vision. (If you have a clear vision, don't let the uninspired tell you you're doing it wrong.) This reminds me of genre preferences. I like certain genre things that most people won't like. I've had that feeling of doubt when I watch something and really enjoy it only to see the majority of people tell me that I'm wrong. Here's a case in point. The best film that I saw last year was 2017's SMALL TOWN CRIME, a Western Noir starring John Hawkes. I think myself and three other people saw it. It was gritty. It was brutal. It was brilliant. Listening to other people talk about the film was instructional: it was too bleak, it was too dark, there were no A-listers in the cast (other than Octavia Spencer in a brief supporting role). This is exactly the kind of story that I like, something a little raw, a little off-the-beaten-path. John Hawkes is searingly good in this film, and it starred an always magnificent Robert Forster before he passed in 2019. There were things in this film that I just adore. I kind of wish that millions of others see what I saw. I'm kind of happy that they don't. If they made this film just for me, a passion project for fans of the genre, I am content. You'll never get a franchise out of any of these films, but I have them as glorious one-offs in my library. tl-dr: have faith in yourself, in your instincts. Don't be afraid to be a trailblazer, whether it's in your career or your passions. I'm John the Wordsmith, and I love me a good Noir Thriller. #storytelling\n\nApplying knowledge effectively is more challenging when we lack foundational understanding and specific information. Wisdom and knowledge can be gathered from a variety of sources. I believe it's less efficient to learn basic principles through trial and error when we could instead learn from those who have already faced these challenges, found solutions, and paid the price. When I read books, it's as if I'm engaged in a conversation on topics like finance, investments, business, or philosophy. Listening to talks and podcasts feels like sitting on the couch with a successful business person. And when I have the opportunity to consult a mentor, I make it a point to ask the difficult questions that can potentially save me the costs—either in time or money—associated with a trial-and-error approach. While we do gain experience through mistakes, it often comes at a price. #entrepreneurship #business #mindset #courage"
