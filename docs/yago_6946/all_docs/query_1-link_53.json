        "text": "Name: Renée Dwyer\n\nType: Human\n\nSpecial Ability: None\n\nRenée Dwyer married her high school sweet heart, Charlie Swan, right after high school. But it was not a fairy tale marriage as Renée left with their baby, Bella, and divorced Charlie soon after.\n\nRenée is an eccentric, silly woman who will brave any new thing (like skydiving) and come to her senses later. Bella always felt that she was the mother of their relationship, having to guide Renée away from doing ridiculous things, and Renée thought of Bella as her middle-aged child.\n\nAfter Renée remarries a much younger baseball player, Phil Dwyer, Bella unselfishly sends herself to live with her dad in Forks so that Renée and Phil can travel together. Edward describes Renée’s mind as being incredibly insightful and almost childlike. Renée believes Bella to be more mature than other teenagers her age and gives Bella and Edward her blessing for their marriage.\n\nBella says she and her mother look alike, but that Renée has shorter hair and laugh lines. Renée originally moved to Phoenix, Arizona after her divorce from Charlie, but then moves to Jacksonville, Florida with Phil. Bella says in Twilight that her mother is her best friend. After Bella becomes a vampire she doesn’t contact her mother, knowing Renée couldn’t handle her change like Charlie could.\n\nEarly History\n\nRenée’s early history is characterized by her free-spirited and somewhat impulsive nature. She married Charlie Swan, Bella’s father, at a young age, and they settled in Forks, Washington. However, Renée, who always had a bit of a restless spirit, found the small-town life in Forks stifling and unfulfilling. This restlessness led her to leave Forks with Bella when Bella was still a baby, seeking a more vibrant and dynamic environment.\n\nThe mother and daughter moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where Renée raised Bella largely on her own. Renée’s approach to life was somewhat unconventional; she often behaved more like a friend than a traditional parent to Bella. This role reversal in their relationship had a significant impact on Bella, who grew up to be mature and responsible from a young age, often finding herself in the position of taking care of her mother rather than the other way around.\n\nRenée’s personality is whimsical and artistic, with a penchant for trying out new hobbies and often relying on Bella for stability and practical matters. Her parenting style, while loving and affectionate, was somewhat erratic, contributing to Bella’s independent and self-reliant character.\n\nActor Biography\n\nName: Sarah Lively Clarke\n\nNick Name(s): Creathon\n\nDate of Birth: February 16th 1972\n\nHeight: 5’ 4”\n\nHair: Brunette\n\nEye Color: Blue/Green\n\nFun Fact: Sarah is a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority.

In 2001, Clarke auditioned for the role of CTU agent Nina Myers on 24. She won the role on the day that filming began.
