        "text": "Tell us about yourself and why you do what you do?\n\nWe’ve been married 12 and a half years. Back when we got married, there weren't the same number of wedding photographers to choose from and since it was during the film days - you generally didn't receive the negatives. Since we were paying for our wedding ourselves, we opted not to go with an album and only had our photographer for the ceremony and formals. We both regret not having more photos of all our guests and all the fun we had at the reception not to mention some of the moments that happened in the morning while we were both getting ready.\n\nAs time has passed and we've started to lose friends and family members, the value of the photos we have of them increases exponentially. We always tell our couples that they aren't just investing in a timeless heirloom for themselves, but it will also be a treasured heirloom that future generations will appreciate and enjoy. What we both wouldn't give to have more photos of our parents on their wedding day. We believe in the timelessness of the printed image and we want every couple to have a record of their entire day from exchanging vows and the first kiss to all the little things they wouldn’t have known about, the things that happened when they weren’t there, so that when they’ve been married for forty, fifty years and open their album they can relive that day and smile!\n\nAt what moment during a wedding do you feel like \"Yep, this is it. This is why I do this.\"?\n\nSarah: When I see the groom’s reaction to his bride coming down the aisle!\n\nBruce: Usually during speeches when emotions are running high or during the father-daughter dance. Dads that cry when they see their little girl in their wedding dress always get me a little teary.\n\nWhat is the best advice you can give a couple planning a wedding?\n\nSarah: Both of you should be involved in planning your day… it’s about the both of you and you want it to reflect the two of you as a couple. Don’t get caught up in the little things. Oh, and don’t forget to date while you’re doing all the planning…go for a coffee to decide the seating plan… go for a walk after you go cake tasting…just 'cause you’re getting married doesn’t mean you stop dating.\n\nBruce: Make sure the day is about you. Don't feel pressured to conform to certain traditions and ways of doing things just because you think your friends or family will want you to. Make it about you and surround yourself with the things that make you happy. If you want to have a small backyard wedding with a food truck - do it. If you want a giant church wedding with a reception at a fancy hotel - go for it!"
