        "text": "Xander Berkeley was born in Brooklyn, New York on December 16, 1955, but has lived most of his life in New Jersey. He attended Hampshire College and worked in the theaters at the five college system which Hampshire was a part of, including Smith, Mount Holyoke, Amherst, and the University of Massachusetts. Xander then worked in the Regional and Repertory Theaters in addition to Off Broadway while living in New York. A play written by Reynolds Price called “Early Dark” had such a cinematic feel to it, that an agent saw the acting potential in Berkeley and encouraged him to make the move out west.\n\nBerkeley began playing minor TV roles in 1981, with early appearances in ‘M*A*S*H’, ‘Cagney & Lacey’, ‘Remington Steele’, ‘Miami Vice’, ‘Moonlighting’ and ‘The A-Team’. Although not becoming a household name, Berkeley's face was increasingly recognizable into the 1990s. His later television guest roles included ‘The X-Files’, ‘CSI’, ‘ER’, ‘24’ and ‘Law & Order’.\n\nOn the big screen, Berkeley has appeared in “Sid and Nancy” (1986) “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991), “A Few Good Men” (1992), “Apollo 13” (1995) “The Rock” (1996), “Apollo 13” “Air Force One” (1997), “Shanghai Noon” (2000). Berkeley has the distinction of appearing in both the made-for-television film ‘L.A. Takedown’ in 1989 and its 1995 critically acclaimed theatrical remake “Heat”, both directed by Michael Mann. Several of his earlier roles were in films by director Alex Cox including his only Euro-western “Straight to Hell” as Preacher McMahon. Berkeley often plays the roles of unsympathetic characters.\n\nIn 2001, Berkeley became a recurring guest star on ‘24’ as George Mason, the head of the Counter Terrorist Unit.\n\nBerkeley has provided voices for animated series such as ‘Aaahh!!! Real Monsters’, ‘Teen Titans’ and ‘Gargoyles’. He voiced Quentin Beck/Mysterio in ‘The Spectacular Spider-Man’ and Captain Atom in the animated movie “Superman/Batman: Public Enemies” (2009).\n\nHe portrayed the mysterious John Smith on the CBS drama ‘Jericho’. He began portraying the series regular role of Percy on The CW's drama ‘Nikita’ at the start of the 2010-2011 television season.\n\nIn his spare time Berkeley is a painter and a sculptor, as well as a make-up artist. Berkeley met Sarah Clarke on the set of 24 in 2001, and married her the following year. Berkeley and Clarke live with their two daughters: Olwyn Harper (born on September 23, 2006) and Rowan (March 2010) in Los Angeles.\n\nBERKELEY, Xander (aka Kander Berkeley, Xander Berkley) (Alexander Harper Berkeley) [12/16/1955, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.A. - ] - producer, TV, voice actor, married to actress Sarah Clarke [1972- ] (2002- ).\n\nStraight to Hell – 1987 (Preacher McMahon)\n\nBack to Hell - 2000 [himself]"
