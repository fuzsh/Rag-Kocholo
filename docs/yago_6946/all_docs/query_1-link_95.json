Get your mind out of the gutter and back on the road, they're there to help you remember to slow down.\n\nMind Your Language\n\nLocal organization connects immigrant English learners to local residents in a new way that forms strong, lifelong bonds. Maybe the real second language we learned was the friends we made along the way.\n\nThrow AI In The Garbage\n\n...ok, so it's designed to be there. New AI research pilot program from SLU is designed to track your garbage and recycling habits so that scientists can better understand our local sanitation trends.\n\nNot Today, Death\n\nDeath-row no more!

His family was hoping for an overturned conviction, but the evidence that could have cleared him was compromised.\n\nDon't You Try And Pet Them\n\nBlack bear cubs have been spotted, and they're just as adorable as you'd think they'd be. If you have a gut feeling that you're probably going to die trying to pet something you shouldn't, avoid the area for a while.\n\nOh Shiâ€“\n\nMalden residents have been taking problems into their own hands after the city didn't respond fast enough to complaints. The City of Malden is now begging residents to stop it with the DIY adjustments to the sewer system.\n\nIt's Still Summer, You Delusional Pumpkin Enthusiasts\n\nCoffee giant Starbucks is bringing back their annual sensation early this year! Temperatures may not be dropping, but a Pumpkin Spice Latte makes it easier to pretend that crisp autumn air is what you feel instead of sweat dripping down your neck.\n\nIt Ends With Drama\n\nAmidst rumors that actor Blake Lively and director Justin Baldoni are feuding over who owns the controversial flick, most of us want to know why either of them wants to claim it in the first place.\n\n[title of show] The Gender Bend Edition\n\nThis production opened last weekend and will be up through September 8th at the Kranzberg Black Box Theatre. Don't miss the chance to catch this woman-led production!\n\nCarnival Nights\n\nIt's hot, but music and snacks can take the edge off.
