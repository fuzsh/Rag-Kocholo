He is of Jewish ancestry, and she said last year she had converted to the faith.\n\n“Her birth leading into Rosh Hashanah symbolizes new beginnings and hope in the midst of tough days. She’s our reminder of a better tomorrow” the couple said in a statement. Rosh Hashanah for 2020 starts Friday evening.\n\nFrey will take a brief leave and continue handling day-to-day mayoral duties from home, according to a release from his office. Clarke is director of government affairs at a Minneapolis law and lobbying firm."
