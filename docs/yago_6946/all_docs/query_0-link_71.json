        "text": "Sarah Clarke\n\nBorn: February 16, 1972 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA\n\nMarried to: Xander Berkeley (7 September 2002 – present) (2 children)\n\nIn one of her guest appearances on 24 (2001), Clarke’s character, Nina’s (fake) passport picture is brought up on a screen during a CTU meeting, and the name next to the picture reads “Sarah Berkeley,” Clarke’s married name. The information shown on the passport, however, is not Clarke’s real information (birthdate, etc).\n\nI love Xander’s voice so much that I listen to his voice mails over and over."
