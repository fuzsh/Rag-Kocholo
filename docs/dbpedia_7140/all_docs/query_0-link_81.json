        "text": "Marubeni has finalized the sale of low-carbon aluminum billets*1 to Fuji Light Metal Co., Ltd. and FUJISASH Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “FUJISASH Group”), under a strategic collaboration agreement with global mining group Rio Tinto. The sale is for a batch of Rio Tinto’s RenewAl™ aluminum billet from its renewably-powered New Zealand aluminum Smelters (NZAS) to FUJISASH Group, which is committed to reducing carbon emissions throughout its supply chain and manufacturing process. This represents the first sale of RenewALTM low-carbon aluminum billets in Asia, and will enhance environmental values and contribute to sustainable supply chains.\n\nOverview and Distinctive Features\n\nMarubeni will provide Rio Tinto’s low-carbon aluminum billets (RenewAl™), the industry’s first certified low-carbon brand of aluminum, to FUJISASH Group, with which Marubeni has built a strong, long-standing business relationship, for use in the aluminum sashes and curtain walls*2 of buildings provided by the FUJISASH Group. In addition, Rio Tinto’s digital traceability platform, START™, will enable FUJISASH Group to access up to 14 ESG-related information, such carbon footprint, safety performance and diversity numbers, as well as provenance information, bringing greater supply chain transparency and assurance of responsible sourcing practices.\n\nBackground and Significance\n\nSince the announcement of the strategic collaboration agreement between Marubeni and Rio Tinto, an emerging demand for low-carbon aluminum and ESG related information has become evident in the value chains of several industries. Marubeni will continue to hasten the pace of cross-industrial collaboration among producers, trading companies, and building materials manufacturers to expand the range of applications of low-carbon aluminum, develop new products, and jointly undertake traceability initiatives for sustainable growth.\n\nOngoing Prospects\n\nMarubeni’s Mid-Term Management Strategy, GC2024, positions green strategy as a fundamental platform for the enhancement of corporate value. Aluminum-related business is an area of focus within this green strategy to enable a transition to a decarbonized society. Marubeni will contribute to creating a sustainable society by supplying responsible aluminum to a range of clients and supporting the decarbonization of the entire supply chain.\n\n1 Billet: An ingot of aluminum that is cast, usually into a cylindrical shape, and cut for extrusion processing. It is extruded at high temperatures using an extruder to create tubes, bars, or shapes with various cross sections.\n\n2 Curtain wall: An extremely lightweight exterior wall developed for skyscrapers and apartments to achieve outstanding design features while reducing the weight of the building as a whole and mitigating the shattering of glass in the event of an earthquake.\n\nCompany overviews\n\nRio Tinto\n\nCompany name: Rio Tinto Location: UK (London) Establishment: 1873 Representative: Jakob Stausholm (CEO) Main Business: Development, production and processing of mineral resources such as iron ore, aluminum, copper and critical minerals Website: https://www.riotinto.com/\n\nFUJISASH\n\nCompany name: FUJISASH Co., Ltd.
