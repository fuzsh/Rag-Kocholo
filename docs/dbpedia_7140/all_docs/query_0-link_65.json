Digital twins, which were pioneered by NASA, are virtual representations of a physical environment – such as a space station – that allow you to swiftly test multiple scenarios. These twins blend data from real-world processing plants with historical data, such as design and production. This allows the field personnel and those in our remote operations centre to view the same data and make decisions based on real-time data in seconds rather than hours or days. They can also test methods for increasing output without destroying parts or disturbing operations.\n\nEXCLUSIVE INSIGHTS COMING SOON!\n\nWhat are Rio Tinto’s key innovation segments?"
