        "text": "The incoming copper boss has vast international experience in the energy sector, across operational and commercial roles. She started at Shell as a drilling engineer and worked in Asia, Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the US.\n\nJackson was later appointed by BG Group as its executive vice president for global business development and strategy. She then rejoined Shell in a top position, dealing with acquisitions, divestments and new business development across the energy company’s portfolio.\n\nRio Tinto chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, said that Jackson’s appointment would play a crucial role in shaping the company’s copper business for a successful future.\n\n“As we continue the ramp up of Oyu Tolgoi to become one of the world’s largest copper suppliers, we are also looking to the future with new opportunities across the world,” Stausholm said in a statement.\n\nThe newly appointed executive said it was “an exciting time” to lead Rio’s copper division, as the metal plays a central role in delivering a low carbon future.\n\nPath to CEO?\n\nIncumbent copper chief Bold Baatar is seen by investors and analysts as a top contender to succeed Stausholm, who assumed the top post in January 2021. The Danish national has been focused on regaining public and investors trust in the company, following global outcry over the miner’s destruction of sacred Aboriginal rock shelters in 2020.\n\nBerenberg’s analyst Richard Hatch, said the Mongolian national’s promotion could potentially be another step towards Baatar taking over as CEO of Rio Tinto, though he said in April that he did not anticipate this happening in the near future.\n\nSimon Trott, a long-time employee at Rio who leads its iron ore business, and Peter Cunningham, the company’s chief financial officer, are also considered as other potential candidates for the top position."
