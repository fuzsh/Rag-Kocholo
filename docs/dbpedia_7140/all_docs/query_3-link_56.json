        "text": "Brokers are hiking earnings forecasts forRio Tinto (GB:RIO) as the iron ore price jumps, but the mining giant’s backing by some of the world’s best-performing portfolio managers suggests it offers more than just a play on short-term trends.\n\nRio Tinto is rated AAA by Citywire Elite Companies as a result of its high-conviction backing by 11 of these top professional investors.\n\nBrokers have upped their forecasts for Rio’s earnings over the next year by just over 10% during the past month.\n\nThat follows a sharp rise in the iron ore price from early August to mid-September. Iron ore accounts for about 70% of the group’s Ebita, with another 15% from aluminium and nearly 10% from copper.\n\nTop three elite backers\n\nElite manager Fund Size in fund Rank in fund Simon Gergel and Richard Knight Allianz UK Listed Equity Income 2.5% 11/56 Muzo Kayacan and Simon Weinberger BlackRock Advantage Europe Equity 1.8% 14/174 Philip Wolstencroft Artemis SmartGarp UK Equity 1.5% 25/63\n\nSources: Citywire/Morningstar, latest holdings data.\n\nHow Citywire Elite Companies works\n\nLow iron ore inventories at ports and signs of a pickup in building activity in China as low-key stimulus policies take effect, have driven the price of the metal higher. That said, the overall mood remains anxious due to the financial travails of China’s big property developers, such as Evergrande, and concerns about global economic health.\n\nChina is estimated to account for about 70% of the demand for seaborne iron ore and half of the demand for copper.\n\nThe longer-term outlook for Rio’s markets is more positive, though. That’s because the metals it mines have a hugely important role to play in the world’s transition to green energy.\n\nDemand for steel, which is made from iron, and other metals is enjoying a major tailwind from the transition.\n\nFor example, Rio estimates every megawatt of wind power requires 85 to 210 tonnes of steel, two to 12 tonnes of copper, and one to two tonnes of aluminium. For solar, the same figures are 35 to 45 tonnes of steel, 4.5 tonnes of copper, and 3.5 to 8 tonnes of aluminium.\n\nJoin the elite! Get the weekly Citywire Elite Companies newsletter\n\nThat’s potentially a lot of demand given the International Energy Agency forecasts annual renewable capacity additions will continue to rise from about 350GW this year, about 90% of which is expected to come from wind and solar.\n\nMeanwhile, electric cars contain about three times the amount of copper as petrol vehicles, and the higher-grade iron ores Rio Tinto sells are in hot demand because they are easier to make ‘green steel’ from.\n\nOn a number of measures, Rio Tinto looks very cheap and a 7% forecast dividend yield stands out. Several of the Elite Investors we track who hold the shares run income and value-focused funds, including Kempner Multi-Cap Deep Value managers Harris Kempner Jr and Shawn Gault.\n\nRio’s valuation is in the lowest 10th of its 10-year range based on enterprise value to forecast sales and in the lowest 30% based on forecast price-to-book value.\n\nHowever, the shares look a less compelling bargain based on their forecast free cashflow yield of 7%. Free cashflow is expected to drop as capital expenditure ramps up over the coming years. The company is spending on some new projects, but also on keeping existing mines productive.\n\nRio is also ploughing money into decarbonisation plans, which looks necessary to preserve the company’s ‘social licence’ and keep on the right side of regulators and customers.\n\nA lot of smart money is betting this spending will be worth it, and in the long term, gains from the green energy transition could prove a boon.\n\nKey facts Market capitalisation £62.0bn Price £49.58 52wk high/low £64.06/£44.25 Return on capital employed 27.1% F’cst price to earnings 8.4 F’cst dividend yield 6.9% F’cst EPS growth -2.9% 12mth share price -2.5%\n\nSource: FactSet, as of 6 Oct 2023.
