        "text": "Sinead Kaufman – Chief Executive, Rio Tinto Minerals – BDI Raw Materials Conference\n\nRio Tinto operates across 35 countries and is one of the largest companies in the sector. Next year we celebrate our 150-year birthday, having started life as a copper mine in Spain in 1873, an operation that prior to our ownership, had supplied the ancient Greeks and Romans.\n\nNeedless to say, a lot has happened since then – for the mining sector as a whole, and for Rio Tinto as an organisation. None more so than in the Minerals portfolio that I lead.\n\nRio Tinto’s Minerals business produces a diverse range of products from diamonds to battery materials, including lithium, scandium and other critical minerals that are at the heart of our business strategy.\n\nThe need to decarbonise is driving demand for critical minerals at a pace rarely seen in the history of the resources industry. The World Bank estimates that over three billion tons of minerals and metals will be needed for wind, solar and geothermal power, and energy storage. In parallel, geopolitical tensions are escalating, and states and industries are increasingly focussing on securing critical minerals supply.\n\nThis context places mining at the centre of one the world’s great challenges: how to supply the critical minerals needed to support the world’s energy and green transition, while ensuring the highest social and environmental standards, while meeting the needs of a complex array of stakeholders.\n\nThe clock is ticking on climate change\n\nWhen I joined Rio Tinto 25 years ago, the world saw its first global climate change agreement – the Kyoto Protocol. For many, this was the first real indication that major emitters, such as the mining industry, would need to prepare for a climate conscious future.\n\nThis was reaffirmed in 2015 with the Paris Climate Agreement, and again last year in Glasgow.\n\nIt is no longer a question of if we need to cut emissions; rather, how quickly and significantly we will cut emissions. We are changing what we mine, how we mine and who we partner with, in order to harness the power of both mining and sustainability.\n\nTemperatures and sea levels continue to rise and all around the globe, we are seeing unprecedented storms, extreme flooding and escalating bushfires. However, the path to net zero is not straight forward. Decarbonising quicker means transforming faster, but the materials used in clean air technologies – such as wind turbines, solar panels and battery technologies – often require more critical minerals than their traditional counterparts.\n\nAn electric car uses around five times the amount of minerals as an internal combustion engine. A wind farm on land requires around eight times the minerals needed by a conventional gas-fired power plant with the same capacity.\n\nIn Europe, there are plans to be less dependent on imports, and to establish domestic supplies of clean energy technologies. This adds to the demand growth for a wide range of metals, which requires mature base metals markets like aluminium, copper, nickel, and initiating new product markets such as lithium and rare earth elements.\n\nEuropean autonomy over strategic minerals is vital to achieving its climate change targets. Germany, at the centre of Europe, is core to this ambition. While this is aligned to the world view of climate change, the energy transition does present challenges and opportunities.\n\nInnovation and partnerships are key\n\nAt Rio Tinto, we are supporting the global energy transition in several different ways.\n\nFirstly, we will be accelerating our own decarbonisation, switching to renewable power, electrifying processing, and where possible, running electric mobile fleets.\n\nSecondly, we are increasing our investment in R&D to speed up the development of technologies that will enable our customers to decarbonise. Technology and partnerships have a key role to play.\n\nAnd finally, we are prioritising growth capital in commodities that are essential for the drive to net zero to focus on finding, producing and refining critical minerals through assets, technology and partnerships.\n\nInnovation will be crucial to meeting these goals, because many of the techniques for creating a sustainable supply of critical minerals still need to be invented.\n\nSo, the opportunity for the mining industry is to invest in technology and in doing so create new tools for engineering effective recycling procedures, treating the leftover material from mining as a resource instead of waste, and adopting new techniques for exploration, production and recovery.\n\nWe are committed to investing approximately $7.5 billion between now and 2030 to deliver our decarbonisation strategy and reduce Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in that timeframe.\n\nIn essence, the mining industry must move from the linear model of “take, make and dispose”, to a circular model that explores opportunities for waste to be processed to create by-products that could be used by the mining industry or other industries.\n\nWe have already started on this journey. Our European portfolio includes our ISAL aluminium smelter in Iceland which produces 184,000 tonnes of recyclable, low carbon aluminium using 100% renewable power. We have also established research centres in Australia and Canada whose primary purpose is to partner with academia and other scientific institutions in developing technologies to support the energy transition.\n\nIn Canada, we are now successfully recovering scandium – a critical supply-constrained material – from waste, without additional mining activity, and its associated emissions or environmental impacts.\n\nIn the Southern hemisphere at our Technology Development Centre in Melbourne, we pioneered the technique to recover battery-grade lithium from existing mine waste at our Boron operations in California.\n\nAnd I am delighted that we are supporting the development of a battery ecosystem in Europe through our partnership with European based battery technology and manufacturing company, Inobat.\n\nNo matter where we are in the world, breakthrough technology and partnerships are vital. Without these, there is a very real risk that the basic building blocks of sustainable technologies will hamper reaching net-zero emissions targets.\n\nListening to communities is critical\n\nMeeting, and preferably exceeding, community expectations is as important to the energy transition as meeting demand and investment in R & D. Our focus goes beyond the boundaries of a mine to understand a much broader context. This includes the current and future uses of the land we manage, its biodiversity and social values, its connection to other habitats, and community expectations as to how the land is developed and managed.\n\nMine closure is an often over-looked part of the mining life-cycle. Closing a mine requires recycling, reusing and repurposing, all the while working alongside local communities who are deeply invested in the legacy of the mine. And it requires planning for closure before we even begin mining.\n\nOne example of this is a former aluminium smelter in the French Alps, which we transformed into several environmentally sustainable projects directly benefiting surrounding communities. The seven-hectare eco-park hosts an ecological water treatment plant, a cycle path and a high-tech household waste transit station. A waste recycling and processing centre are also planned.\n\nWe should not underestimate the complexity of the issues associated with what we are calling “cradle to cradle” mining. There are many issues that require careful conversations to ensure that all the voices will be heard. We place great importance on closure and ensuring full awareness of what we are leaving behind.\n\nThe mining industry must be able to demonstrate that 21st century mining can be done in a way that minimises impact, brings social and environmental benefits and leaves former mining sites rehabilitated.\n\nA reimagined future\n\nTo achieve our decarbonisation goals quickly and responsibly, we need government policy support in the various jurisdictions we operate in around the world.\n\nIn Germany, we encourage and support the federal government’s ongoing development of a raw materials foreign policy to strengthen sustainable supply chains.\n\nStrengthening the European Union’s raw materials sector is also crucial to ensuring a diversity of supply for future demand. We welcome the plans initiated by Commission President von der Leyen and the current discussions surrounding it. Promoting research and innovation related to new mining developments and circular economies will help facilitate the energy transition.\n\nI believe there is a strong case for a reimagined future, a future where mining can harness the power of sustainability and can respond to the complex demands of stakeholders – host communities, government, civil society and customers – while minimising the environmental impact across all stages of the mining lifecycle.\n\nI am excited for the role we will play as we develop partnerships and create opportunities for Europe and Rio Tinto. It will be a far cry from Spain in 1873, but nonetheless it too will be history in the making."
