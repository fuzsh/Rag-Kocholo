        "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entrée Resources Ltd. (TSX:ETG; OTCQB:ERLFF – the “Company” or “Entrée”) has today filed its interim financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. All numbers are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\n\nQ2 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOyu Tolgoi Underground Development Update\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia includes two separate land holdings: the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence, which is held by Oyu Tolgoi LLC (“OTLLC”) and the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, which is a joint venture partnership between Entrée and OTLLC. Rio Tinto owns 66% of OTLLC and is the manager of operations at Oyu Tolgoi.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, Rio Tinto announced ramp up of the Oyu Tolgoi Lift 1 underground mine continues in line with its long-term plan. Oyu Tolgoi is set to become the world’s fourth largest copper mine by 2030 with the operation expected to deliver average mined copper production of ~500 thousand tonnes per annum between 2028 and 2036.\n\nOTLLC continues to see strong performance from the Lift 1 underground mine, with a total of 114 Lift 1 draw bells opened from Panel 0 on the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence, including 14 draw bells during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. In the second quarter 2024, OTLLC delivered 1.5 million tonnes of ore milled from Panel 0 on the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence at an average copper head grade of 2.02%.\n\nThe sinking of ventilation Shafts 3 and 4 was completed in April with the shafts reaching their final depths of 1,130 metres and 1,176 metres below ground level, respectively. Rio Tinto continues to expect both shafts to be commissioned in the second half 2024.\n\nAs at June 30, 2024, construction of the conveyor to surface works was 97% complete. Commissioning remains on track for the second half 2024.\n\nConstruction works for the concentrator conversion remain on schedule. Commissioning is expected to be progressively completed from the fourth quarter 2024 through to the second quarter 2025.\n\nConstruction of primary crusher 2 commenced in December 2023 and is due to be completed by the end of 2025.\n\nOTLLC’s 2023 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study for the Lift 1 underground mine has been submitted to and is under review by applicable regulatory bodies in Mongolia. The Lift 1 underground mine incorporates the development of three panels (Panels 0, 1, and 2). The Hugo North Extension (“HNE”) deposit on the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property is located at the northern portion of Panel 1.\n\nDrilling programs to support a Lift 2 Pre-Feasibility Study are in progress. Mineralization from Lift 2 will be included in an updated resource model for Hugo North (including Hugo North Extension).\n\nEntrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property\n\nFirst Lift 1 Panel 1 development work on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence is expected to commence in the fourth quarter 2024. Development work will start in the southwest corner of the HNE deposit and will establish the initial Panel 1 western ore handling truck chute, including extraction level tipple development, the truck chute chamber on the haulage level, and the supporting ventilation loop with the return air level. OTLLC has advised the Company all 2024 development will be in rock classified as waste, which will be stockpiled separately and sampled in accordance with OTLLC’s standard sampling protocols and procedures.\n\nUnderground and surface in-fill diamond drilling at the HNE deposit on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence is in progress. Approximately 14,128 metres of underground drilling in 25 holes and 6,840 metres of surface drilling in 4 holes is planned for 2024. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 3,309 metres of underground drilling in 15 holes and approximately 2,311 metres of surface drilling in 3 holes has been completed on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence. The principal purpose for the drilling is to support the Lift 2 Pre-Feasibility Study and updated resource model for Hugo North (including HNE).\n\nOTLLC is also proposing approximately 8,785 metres of diamond drilling in 5 surface holes on the Heruga deposit (Javhlant mining licence) in 2024 to increase ore body knowledge and support an Order of Magnitude Study. No drilling has been conducted on the Heruga deposit since 2012.\n\nThe 2024 exploration program for the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence will focus on the Airstrip, Ulaan Khud South and Ridge targets, including approximately 2,500 metres of diamond drilling in 2 inclined holes (one at Ulaan Khud South (~1,300 metres) and the other at the Ridge target (~1,200 metres), located midway between Ulaan Khud and Hugo North Extension) and geological and geophysical studies. 2024 work on the Javhlant mining licence is focussed on the Bumbat Ulaan target and the Heruga Trend (Heruga South and Heruga West targets) and will include diamond drilling and geological and geophysical studies. As of June 30, 2024, one diamond drill hole totalling 1,500 metres has been completed at the Heruga South target and one diamond drill hole totalling 640 metres has been completed at the Heruga West target. At Bumbat Ulaan, approximately 1,200 metres of scout reverse circulation drilling in 4 holes is planned.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company announced additional diamond drill hole results from the 2022 and 2023 drilling programs over the HNE deposit.\n\nCorporate\n\nFor the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024, the Company’s operating loss was $0.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, compared to $1.0 million and $1.9 million for the comparative periods in 2023.\n\nFor the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024, the operating cash outflow before changes in non-cash working capital items was $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, compared to $0.9 million and $1.6 million in the comparative periods in 2023\n\nAs at June 30, 2024, the cash balance was $4.0 million and the working capital balance was $4.0 million.\n\nOUTLOOK AND STRATEGY\n\nEntrée’s primary objective is to confirm the transfer of the Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences from the Company’s Mongolian subsidiary to OTLLC as contemplated by the joint venture agreement between the Company and OTLLC (the “Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA”), either in conjunction with finalization, execution, and closing of an agreement with OTLLC to restructure or amend the existing Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA to streamline the operating environment for both parties, or enforcement of certain provisions of the 2004 Equity Participation and Earn-in Agreement and Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA pursuant to binding arbitration proceedings commenced by the Company in 2022. The Company currently is registered in Mongolia as the 100% ultimate holder of the licences.\n\nThe commencement of arbitration proceedings followed protracted discussions with Rio Tinto and OTLLC to confirm the transfer of the Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences to OTLLC. The arbitration was commenced in Vancouver, British Columbia under the International Commercial Arbitration Act (British Columbia). A three-member Tribunal has been appointed and the first arbitration hearing took place in Vancouver on April 8 and 9, 2024. A second arbitration hearing took place in Toronto on July 10, 2024.\n\nNotwithstanding the ongoing arbitration proceedings, the Company remains committed to achieving a commercial resolution with Rio Tinto and OTLLC. Any definitive agreement reached between the Company and OTLLC to restructure or amend the existing Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA would be subject to Toronto Stock Exchange acceptance and the requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions applicable to a related party transaction. There are no assurances that a definitive agreement will be finalized and executed, or if finalized and executed, that the transaction would close.\n\nThe Company has also been in discussions with Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (the State-owned company that holds the Government’s 34% interest in OTLLC) regarding the potential for the Government of Mongolia and Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC to conclude an agreement with the Company for the State to share in 34% of the economic benefit of the Company’s interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. The Minerals Law of Mongolia provides the State may share in up to 34% of the economic benefit derived from exploitation of a mineral deposit of strategic importance where proven reserves were determined through funding sources other than the State budget. The Hugo North Extension copper-gold deposit on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence and the Heruga copper-gold-molybdenum deposit on the Javhlant mining licence are mineral deposits of strategic importance.\n\nThe Company’s interim financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 are available on the Company’s website at www.EntreeResourcesLtd.com, on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, and on OTC Markets at www.otcmarkets.com.\n\nQUALIFIED PERSON\n\nRobert Cinits, P.Geo., a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has approved the technical information in this release.
