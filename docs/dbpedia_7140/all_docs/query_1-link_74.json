        "text": "The bounce continues to confound the masses, including us, as the bears not only fumbled the ball but have been trampled by the relentless bulls. On Thursday, the S&P 500 (SPX) ripped higher by 1.6%, the S&P 100 surged 1.7%, the Nasdaq spiked by 2.3%, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) tacked on 2.5%, the S&P 400 was up 2%, and the Russell 2000 popped 2.6%. Over the past six days, the SPX has jumped by 6.6%, the largest such move since November 2022, when stocks were emerging from a bear market. Historically, gains like this occur in two very different market environments: a market that is bottoming and/or coming out of a correction/bear market, or during counter-trend rallies within corrections/bear markets. It seems clear that the first scenario describes what is currently taking place. The Nasdaq and the QQQ have catapulted 9% in six days, also the strongest move since November 2022. There are a few things missing from the rally, but we can write at least one of them off due to the summer doldrums. Volume on the major indices has been lacking, which is common this time of year. We have not seen a typical breadth thrust, which happens many times when stocks are coming out of pullbacks, corrections, and bear markets. The reading of NYSE advances/total issues has not registered an 80%-up day while advancing volume/total volume has printed two 80% (or more) days since the rally started. The stunner of the week, again, is the NAAIM Exposure Index. It dropped for a second straight week (the survey is taken every Wednesday) and is neutral at 57%. Exposure rises coincident with price, and vice versa. Can we chalk this up to the summer as well? If not, this is an extremely bullish tell for the market. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)"
