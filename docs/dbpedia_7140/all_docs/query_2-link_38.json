        "text": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel today joined Rio Tinto to announce the company is opening a new office in Chicago. The 145-year-old global mining and metals company is one of the leading providers of essential materials like aluminum and copper to American manufacturers and plans to employ 70 people at a new office in the Aon Center by the end of the year.\n\n“Chicago’s talent, technology and access to markets give innovative global companies like Rio Tinto the tools they need to continue to grow and succeed,” Mayor Emanuel said. “I want to welcome Rio Tinto to their new home in Chicago and look forward to seeing them thrive here.”\n\nFounded in 1873, Rio Tinto is one of the world’s largest metals and mining companies. Chicago has long been one of the world’s historic commodity hubs and Rio Tinto will make it home to 70 employees initially with plans to grow over time. The office will allow for expanded engagement and provide opportunities for partnerships with new and existing customers.\n\n“The US is one of the largest markets globally for Rio Tinto’s products,” Chief commercial officer Simon Trott said. “Opening a commercial office in Chicago strategically locates our US sales and marketing activities closer to our existing and future customers. It also gives Rio Tinto access to the US talent pool and ensures the company responds and adapts to market changes, allowing us to better respond to customer needs. Rio Tinto’s operations have supplied essential materials to US customers for over 100 years and the company is committed to continuing to partner and deepen our relationship with them.”\n\nThe United States is home to more than 3,000 Rio Tinto employees working at operations in Utah, Arizona and California. The U.S. is the top market for many of Rio Tinto’s products, including copper, diamonds and industrial minerals. Rio Tinto is the largest supplier of aluminum to the United States from its low carbon operations in Canada. The company’s Boron mine in California recently celebrated its 145th anniversary of supplying essential materials to customers around the world.\n\n###"
