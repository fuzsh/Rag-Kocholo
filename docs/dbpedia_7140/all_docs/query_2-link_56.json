        "text": "Feb. 16, 2023\n\nMarubeni Corporation\n\nRio Tinto\n\nGlobal miner Rio Tinto and Japanese trader and business conglomerate Marubeni Corporation have agreed a first sale under a new strategic Collaboration Agreement to secure a sustainable and reliable supply of Rio Tinto’s Responsible Aluminium products to Japanese downstream manufacturers.\n\nThe first sale is a batch of Rio Tinto’s RenewAl™ high purity aluminium, from the renewably powered New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS), to a major Japanese motorcycle manufacturer committed to reducing carbon emissions throughout its supply chains and manufacturing process.\n\nThe agreement, the first of its kind in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, is focused on providing downstream industry with a simple, integrated way to achieve ESG-related goals and requirements, such as reducing carbon footprints, disclosing lifecycle assessment (LCA), and sourcing responsibly. It will also provide strong long-term security of supply at a time of growing supply-chain risks.\n\nIt combines Rio Tinto’s suite of Responsible Aluminium products - which include RenewAl™, the industry’s first certified low carbon aluminium, Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certified aluminium and the digital traceability platform START - with Marubeni’s extensive trading network, commercial capability and carbon credit mechanism, Neutr-Al™, which will be offered as part of the collaboration.\n\nTolga Egrilmezer, Rio Tinto Head of Sales & Marketing, said “We are excited to be a part of the first producer-trading house marketing partnership focused on delivering sustainability throughout the aluminium supply chain.\n\n“Consumers want to know more about the products they buy and be assured that they have been produced responsibly and sustainably. By working with partners like Marubeni, we can help our downstream customers in the aluminium value chain meet this growing consumer demand, while at the same time advancing our commitment to decarbonise our product value chains.”\n\nMarubeni Chief Operating Officer, Metals & Mineral Resources Division Daisuke Tsuchiya said “Marubeni's Mid-Term Management Strategy GC2024 positions green strategy as a fundamental platform to enhance corporate value. Aluminium-related business is an area of focus within this green strategy to enable a transition to a decarbonised society. Through this collaboration, Marubeni will contribute to creating a decarbonised society by supplying responsible aluminium, produced by Rio Tinto, to various customers through Marubeni’s interface, which has been built up over through the company's many years of aluminium trading.”\n\nRio Tinto\n\nRio Tinto is an industry leader in the supply of responsibly produced materials, including in responsible aluminium production.\n\nIn 2016, Rio Tinto launched RenewAl™, the world’s first certified low CO2 primary aluminium brand. It has helped to pioneer responsible production standards for the global industry as a founding member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), becoming the first producer to offer ASI Aluminium in 2018. Learn more at www.aluminium-stewardship.org.\n\nIn 2021, Rio Tinto launched START, a new standard in transparency, traceability and provenance. Using secure blockchain technology, START provides key environmental, social and governance (ESG) information about how Rio Tinto products were made. It covers fourteen criteria: global warming potential, water management, waste management, energy sources, air emissions, biodiversity, land management, recycled content, safety performance, community investment, third-party assessments, ethics & compliance training, diversity in leadership and our whistleblower programme. Through START, Rio Tinto empowers its customers and their customers, to make a more sustainable choice."
