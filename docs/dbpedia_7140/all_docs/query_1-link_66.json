        "text": "Almost all industries in Australia today have adopted digital media in some way. However, uses in large scale activities such as mining may seem to be different from others. This article looks at mining practices with a media studies approach, and concludes that, just as many other industries, mining and media have converged. Many Australian mine sites are adopting new media for communication and control to manage communication, explore for ore bodies, simulate forces, automate drilling, keep records, and make transport and command robotic. Beyond sharing similar digital devices for communication and computation, new media in mining employ characteristic digital media operations, such as numerical operation, automation and managed variability. This article examines the implications of finding that some of the most material practices have become mediated by new media. Mining has become increasingly mediated through new media technologies similar to GPS, visualisation, game remote operation, similar to those adopted in consumer home and mobile digital media.\n\nDuring the last 10 years, important contributions about knowledge management (KM) issues in supply chain management (SCM) have been published. The current paper aims to build upon previous literature reviews focused on KM in supply chains (SCs) from an integrative perspective, particularly recognising the studies conducted by Bhosale and Kant (2016. “Metadata Analysis of Knowledge Management in Supply Chain: Investigating the Past and Predicting the Future.” Business Process Management Journal 22 (1): 140–172) and Cerchione and Esposito (2016. “A Systematic Review of Supply Chain Knowledge Management Research: State of the Art and Research Opportunities.” International Journal of Production Economics 182: 276–292) as an effort to discuss the evolution of KM in the SC field. To this end, a systematic literature review including 210 papers is conducted over the period 2008–2017 from three positions previously not addressed jointly within the supply chain (SC) context: research methods employed by the authors; KM processes applied in the business processes across the SC; and intra and inter- organisational performance metrics linked with KM initiatives. Results exhibited that: (i) ‘Survey’ and ‘Case study’ are the two research methodologies mostly employed by authors (ii) the knowledge transfer is discussed in the majority of the studies reviewed, (iii) 114 intra and inter-organisational performance metrics are reported within the SC context from an empirical data approach. Findings concerning previous identified gap analysis and future lines of research are described.\n\nThe common-held view of the future of copper mining is one of declining quality of mineral resources and increasingly limited long-term development options. This decline, in turn, is viewed as inevitably leading to increasing economic, socio-political and environmental costs. As a result, new technologies and innovations will be required to mitigate cost escalation. The future is therefore typically summarised as a battle of a 'below-ground' declining quality asset base pushing costs upward versus 'above-ground' technology and innovation driving costs downward. The role that high quality new mineral discoveries could play in mitigating industry cost pressures is typically understated, if considered at all. New high quality discoveries can be mined at lower cost than existing assets and potentially if discovered in the right locations within a more amenable contemporary environmental and socio-political setting. Such deposits, once discovered, would improve the overall quality of the industry asset base, as well as benefitting their owners substantially through higher margins. However, to target new high quality deposits explorers need some understanding of the nature of high quality copper mines in the long-term future. Conventional scientific and economic techniques for analysing the future of copper supply, generally by studying the project pipeline, ignore as yet undiscovered resources and also struggle to fully incorporate the multiple internal and external factors that could impact upon copper mining practices in the future. Scenario analysis is specifically designed to consider multiple factors interacting in the future, and is thus more creative than simply looking at the visible project pipeline. The use of scenarios is therefore potentially capable of providing insight into aspects of the future of copper mining about which little is currently known or that remains considerably uncertain. In this study, the Oxford University Scenarios methodology was employed to analyse different plausible futures for copper mining and the consequent implications for exploration targeting strategies. The scenario analysis highlights two key dimensions or axes that serve to map out potential industry futures: firstly the technical and economic optimisation of the existing industry; and secondly the generation of new prospects or 'search space' for the copper industry. These two axes in turn frame four different scenarios for the future of the copper mining industry. These copper mining scenarios are then compared to the 20 largest existing copper mines and projects, and their owners, to determine if any represent an appropriately robust exploration targeting proxy: none do. The paper therefore concludes that efforts by industry are required to generate mine concepts that would be viable across all scenarios, and thus act also as exploration targeting proxies. In the interim, companies will have to seek to build portfolios that create an overall robust asset base, out"
