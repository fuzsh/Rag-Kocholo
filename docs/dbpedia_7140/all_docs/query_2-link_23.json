        "text": "News\n\nAustralia's MinRes pulls back Li output with downturn\n\nSingapore, 29 August (Argus) — Australian lithium and iron ore producer Mineral Resources (MinRes) will pull back on lithium production at its Mount Marion and Wodgina sites with the current downturn. \"I'm starving the product going in[to] the market,\" said MinRes managing director Chris Ellison on 29 August. \"I don't want to oversupply the market. I don't want to waste my ore.\" MinRes issued its July 2024-June 2025 fiscal year lithium shipment guidance on 6pc-grade spodumene grade basis for Mount Marion at 150,000-170,000 dry metric tonnes (dmt), down from the previous year's 190,000-220,000dmt, according to its latest full-year results presentation. Wodgina's guidance was 210,000-230,000dmt, down from the previous year's 210,000-240,000dmt. Its newer Bald Hill site, which was not issued a guidance, aims to ship 120,000-145,000dmt. \"We've got used to higher prices. We've put a lot more gear in there and got greedier and tried to get more product. We're paying attention to that,\" said Ellison. But MinRes has no plans to shut the mines down. But it will spend \"as little\" as it can on the mines while conserving cash. MinRes' revenues for 2023-24 rose by 10pc against a year earlier to around A$5.3bn ($3.6bn), partly supported by higher iron ore revenues but offset by the weaker lithium prices. \"We're in a tough market. We're in one of those downturns [but] it's nothing we need to panic about,\" added Ellison. He forecast lithium prices to likely remain depressed for \"six months or so\" before rebounding early next year. But has warned that if it does not, plenty of lithium operations are going to be \"turned off\". Argus-assessed prices for 6pc grade lithium concentrate (spodumene) held stable from a week earlier at $770-840/t cif China on 27 August, while prices for 99.5pc grade lithium carbonate ex-works China hit their lowest level since early 2021 and are currently at Yn73,000-78,000/t ex-works. MinRes will also not delve into downstream processing of lithium in his times, stressed Ellison in a sharp contrast with its rival Pilbara Minerals , stating those yield \"marginal returns\". MinRes earlier in June ended a transitional third-party processing agreement with US-based lithium producer Albemarle for the conversion of its Wodgina spodumene into lithium hydroxide.

The two airlines each ordered 100 C919s in April from Comac, which will be delivered gradually during 2024-31. This latest deliveries mean that all three of China's largest airlines now have the C919 in their fleets. Comac in March delivered the first C919 to state-owned China Eastern Airlines, which in September 2023 placed an order for 100 of such planes. At the 2024 Singapore Airshow, Comac announced an order from Tibet Airlines for 40 C919s. It has received orders for more than 900 C919s. So far, nine C919s have been delivered to domestic airlines, Comac said. A continued increase in orders and deliveries of the C919 airliner is likely to continue to boost demand for titanium mill products in the coming years, market participants said. A single C919 aircraft contains 3.92t of titanium mill products. The aerospace industry accounts for over 25pc of global total titanium consumption, according to industry estimates. Comac launched the C919 development programme in 2008 and began prototype production in 2011. The airliner had its maiden flight in 2017 and received its airworthiness certification from Chinese authorities in September 2022. It completed its first pre-delivery flight test in the same year. China is also seeking Europe's approval for C919 to compete with established aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus outside China.

Weiming has started to preheat Jiaman's first side-blown converter on 25 August, which is a key step to bring the equipment to the linkage debugging stage before advancing to the production phase. Jiaman, a partnership between Weiming and Merit International Capital, has a nameplate capacity of 40,000 t/yr in nickel metal equivalent. It has four production lines with 10,000t of nickel metal equivalent each. Jiaman is the second project to adopt the oxygen-enriched side-blowing furnace (OESBF) process in Indonesia, following major Chinese nickel and lithium-ion battery cathode active material (CAM) precursor manufacturer producer CNGR in 2022 . The OESBF process is cost-effective as it uses ores with low nickel content as feedstock and recovers cobalt metal, CNGR said. Market participants are monitoring the progress of the OESBF process closely, as well as its feasibility, as it is still a developing technology. Weiming has two other high nickel matte projects in Indonesia, producing 40,000 t/yr and 50,000 t/yr of nickel metal respectively, bringing the company's total production capacity to 130,000 t/yr in nickel metal equivalent.
