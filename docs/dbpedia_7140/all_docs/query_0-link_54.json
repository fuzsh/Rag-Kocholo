        "text": "Challenge\n\nCurrent digital tools can take three to six months to configure for a single project\n\nSolution\n\nAllowing engineering service providers to use a preconfigured, standardized system up front with AVEVA engineering tools, including AVEVA™ Asset Information Management, saved time and money\n\nResult\n\nConnecting design and engineering tools allowed Rio Tinto to streamline project delivery, making operations more efficient\n\n“If we have a plant running at 100% availability and 80% utilization, how can we bridge that gap? This is the outcome of the data we get from the system that we want to act on to lead to improvement.”\n\n– Diego Lachiavo,\n\nProject Manager, Rio Tinto\n\nChallenge\n\nThe in-house system for tracking downtime had fallen out of use\n\nSolution\n\nThe aluminum business implemented AVEVA™ Production Management on top of the company’s widely used AVEVA™ PI System™, to easily track downtime and losses\n\nResult\n\nTeams across disciplines extracted analytics to investigate losses and mitigate them in the future\n\nChallenge\n\nThe company needed to standardize HMI across all its mine sites to improve flexibility and response times\n\nSolution\n\nUsing AVEVA™ System Platform and AVEVA™ Plant SCADA, Rio Tinto implemented a centralized HMI design with a goal of delivering one ASM standard across all mines\n\nResult\n\nThe company created an intuitive library of new and legacy sites and can now update products 24/7"
