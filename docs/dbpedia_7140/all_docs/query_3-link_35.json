        "text": "We promise to work collaboratively with associations and other stakeholders to enhance the contribution of mining and metals to sustainable development. Our commitment to working with others does not stop at our industry’s boundaries. We were founded on a spirit of open engagement, and we continue to champion diversity of opinions today to deliver bold leadership for our wider industry and non-resources sectors alike.\n\nCompany Members\n\nICMM members recognise that they have an active role to play in creating a safer and more sustainable mining and metals industry. Through their commitments, company members work together, alongside governments and local communities, to improve quality of life beyond the provision of the minerals and metals that sustain modern living. All company members are represented on ICMM’s Council by their CEOs and on various committees by nominated representatives.\n\nMember Admission Process\n\nSince the inception of ICMM in 2001, the requirements of membership for companies have evolved from an informal set of expectations to a more prescriptive set of commitments.\n\nOver the same period, an increasingly broad set of stakeholders now recognise membership in ICMM as a practical demonstration of leadership commitment, linked to expectations of progressive improvements in sustainable development performance.\n\nThe due diligence process relating to the acceptance of new members underscores the leadership commitment and integrity of the organisation and its members. ICMM’s company member admission process[1] is designed to:\n\nProtect the interests of ICMM members, any prospective member company, and ICMM as an organisation, against reputational or any other risk, or liability for adhoc decisions taken.\n\nBe based on criteria that are consistent with the obligations of existing members.\n\nPlace the onus for demonstration of ability and willingness to meet ICMM’s membership requirements on the prospective member company.\n\nEstablish a consistent, rigorous and independently verified assessment of the prospective member company’s self-assessed performance against the obligations of existing members.\n\nBe independent, fair and unbiased, and ensure that any prospective member company can fully respond to any questions that might arise during the conduct of due diligence.\n\nMember Performance Commitments\n\nICMM has long recognised that economic growth should never be at the expense of people or planet. In 2003, ICMM published its 10 Principles for sustainable development to set a standard of ethical performance for our members. Over time, we have worked to expand on these with position statements on key issues, such as nature, Indigenous Peoples, climate change, tailings governance, water stewardship and transparency of mineral revenues.\n\nIn early April 2018, ICMM launched a global public consultation on the introduction of a comprehensive set of performance expectations on how members should be expected to manage a broad range of sustainability issues at the corporate and operational levels, to enhance these original 10 principles.\n\nThese enhanced Mining Principles strengthen social and environmental requirements, on issues such as labour rights, resettlement, gender, access to grievance mechanisms, mine closure, pollution and waste. Implementation is supported by robust site-level validation, credible assurance and transparent disclosure. Aligned with the objectives of other responsible sourcing initiatives, our Assurance and Validation Procedure reinforces commitments to transparency, and ensures the credibility of reported progress.\n\nOverview of the Process\n\n1. Applicant Information Report (AIR): Submission of information in support of an application by a prospective new member company (the ‘Applicant’).\n\nExpectations of the Independent Expert Review Panel (IERP)\n\nThe IERP follows a standard procedure and terms of reference which ICMM establishes in advance. This is based upon the need for the IERP to carefully consider the information provided in the application information and assurance reports from an Applicant. Each member of the IERP signs a confidentiality agreement with an Applicant in order to bind himself/herself to keep confidential all information received that is not in the public domain.\n\nThe terms of reference for the IERP is limited to considering whether:\n\nThe Applicant currently meets ICMM’s membership requirements and the extent and significance of any gaps.\n\nThe Applicant has the requisite commitment and capacity in place to fully implement the membership requirements within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nThere are any reputational risks for ICMM or its members from the Applicant not fulfilling the requirements of membership within an agreed timeframe and on an ongoing basis.\n\n—\n\nNotes\n\n1. Member Associations are not required to comply with ICMM’s Mining Principles, and are subject to a different admission procedure, available separately."
