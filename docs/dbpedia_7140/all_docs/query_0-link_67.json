        "text": "Stephanie Ricci contributed to this story.\n\nThe mining industry has become critical to the world as we know it, but it will also play a pivotal role in reaching global sustainability goals. Clean energy technology is more mineral intensive than fossil fuel technologies, leading to a larger material footprint.\n\nOut of any other metal, a 2020 World Bank report assessed that the production of aluminum, one of the world’s most widely used metals, will experience the highest increase by 2050 to meet the soaring demand for green technology.\n\nSo, how do we ensure a decarbonization when the very production of aluminum is a major driver for greenhouse gas emissions—generating about 2% of the world's human-caused emissions?\n\nA smelting breakthrough\n\nIt’s a paradox Ivan Vella, Chief Executive of Rio Tinto Aluminium addressed on stage at the Conference of Montreal earlier this summer, in a discussion with Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, François-Philippe Champagne, on how we can strengthen the economy via innovation.\n\nRio Tinto is a world-leading mining and metals corporation operating in 35 countries. In 2018, the company partnered with Alcoa to launch the joint venture company ELYSIS and develop the world's first carbon-free aluminum smelting process, with support from Apple and the Governments of Canada and Quebec. This revolutionary technology eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional aluminum smelting process while producing oxygen.\n\n“If something's been the same for 140 years, it's pretty difficult to change it. But our research scientists have spent 20 years looking at this problem and the team at ELYSIS really made a breakthrough last year with the start of production at its R&D Centre,” said Ivan Vella, Chief Executive of Rio Tinto Aluminium.\n\n“We're still in the early stages and working as fast as we can to commercialize this technology so that we can start to ramp up the production and help solve this critical paradox,” he said.\n\nIf fully implemented in Canada alone, this new technology could eliminate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions equal to taking nearly 1.8 million light-duty vehicles off the road, according to the joint venture company.\n\nELYSIS has announced that it aims to have its technology available for installation in 2024.\n\nA social responsibility\n\nAs a leader at the world's second-largest metals and mining company, Vella believes that he also shares a social responsibility to the communities in which the company’s operations are taking place.\n\n“There's a very tight link between our business performance, the integrity of our culture, and being an attractive employer where new generations of employees want to be,” he said. “To be a material supplier for the energy transition, we need to be a good partner first.”\n\nVella is passionate about bridging the need for the mining sector with hearing the voices of host communities. He welcomes the focus on increasing the long-term positive effects mining can have by partnering with First Nations and Indigenous peoples, along with the communities they operate in.\n\n“We have a very close connection with First Nations peoples because we are impacting their country, their water, their environment,” said Vella. “Our ability to work through that with them and help contribute to reconciliation, to the truth-telling, and broader cultural awareness, for me, is fundamental.”\n\nThe company recognizes this is an ongoing journey and is working to bring Indigenous peoples to the center of the decision-making process on matters relating to the protection of their cultural heritage. Rio Tinto also invests in a range of partnerships with First Nations communities, including $1.5 million in research to support the Indigenization of higher education.\n\n“We need to work with First Nations to have their guidance and help to manage our impacts more effectively. The key word is listening,” he said.\n\n“I want to be part of that change that shifts a company like Rio Tinto to be seen as a partner who doesn't take more than they give,” he continued. “We want to be the company that people look up to, delivers the materials the world needs for the energy transition and other demands, but that does it ethically.”"
