        "text": "Description of your research\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION TARGETED RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS PLATFORM\n\nDevelopment of Technology to Deliver Radionuclides to Targets\n\nWe are developing next-generation antibody-drug conjugates that can treat numerous molecular targets with various drugs (Figure 1). Currently, the drugs (payloads) that can be delivered include radionuclides (diagnostic and therapeutic), photosensitizers, and anticancer drugs (Figure 2).\n\nIn this system, radionuclides can be delivered to cancer cells using a chelating agent called DOTA as a payload, including diagnostic radionuclides such as 111In (for SPECT) and 64Cu (for PET) and therapeutic radionuclides such as 90Y (β-ray), 177Lu (β-ray) and 225Ac (α-ray). It is also possible to label and deliver halogens such as 211At (α-ray) to cancer cells using other binding modes.\n\nHowever, since radiopharmaceuticals consistently emit radiation and radiation on/off cannot be controlled, we are collaborating with researchers at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Fukushima Medical University to establish a delivery method called the pre-targeting method to reduce side effects on normal tissues as much as possible. In this joint research, we are designing and synthesizing payload molecules that have a kinetic behavior in the body so that radiopharmaceuticals accumulate quickly at the target site without circulating in the body for a long time, and those that are not bound to the radiopharmaceuticals are excreted rapidly out of the body. We are also researching and developing the practical use of internal therapy for alpha-ray emitting radionuclides, which have particularly strong cytotoxicity, while obtaining experimental data in mice.\n\nResearch and Development of Next-Generation Binding Agents\n\nOn the other hand, we are also designing and synthesizing binding agents (protein molecules) that bind to target molecules on the surface of cancer cells and deliver their payloads. For ligands that bind to target molecules, we have used single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies produced from human and mouse IgG antibodies and single-domain antibodies (VHH, nanobody) derived from alpaca and antibody mimetics (affibody). We have experience in this area (Figure X). Recently, we have collaborated with molecular dynamics simulation researchers to design ligand molecules by computational methods. Although scFv (26kD), which has a significant molecular weight, was problematic for mass production, we developed a way to rapidly produce the target protein in E. coli by using VHH (12kDa) and affibody (6kDa), which have a small molecular weight (Reference DOI:10.1016/j.pep.2021.106043). This enables us to immediately manufacture the computationally designed molecule as a conjugate and evaluate its activity. We are developing a new conjugate manufacturing platform that combines AI and computational design.\n\nPlatform technology for new therapeutic targets and new radionuclides\n\nTherapeutic nuclides are being researched and developed worldwide, with a shift from 90Y to 177Lu, which has a higher response rate, for β-ray nuclides, 211At and 225Ac for α-ray nuclides, and new therapeutic nuclides such as 212Pb.\n\nIn addition, radiation in vivo is being promoted for practical use in clinical diagnosis, treatment, and basic research. Specifically, in the \"Medical Diagnosis of In Vivo Chemical Environment by Creation of Entangled Photon-Emitting Nuclei and Molecular Probes\" in JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (B), in which researchers from the School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo are serving as principal investigators, it has become possible to detect changes in the in vivo chemical environment caused by radiation emitted from radionuclides by systematizing detection theory and developing detection devices. Basic research on applying these technologies to medical care has been initiated.\n\nWe are conducting research and development to provide a target-targeting platform that meets a wide range of needs, including actual clinical diagnosis and treatment, as well as research on new bio-environmental information obtained from radiation emitted by radionuclides delivered into the body.\n\nCompetitive research funds related to this research\n\nFY 2014-15 AMED P-DIRECT\n\n“Practical Application of Advanced Colorectal Cancer Pre-targeting Therapeutics Integrating PET Imaging Diagnostics and Isotope DDS Therapy\" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2016-17 AMED P-CREATE\n\n“Development of an innovative cancer cell targeting system for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced metastatic cancer\" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2017-18 JSPS Bilateral Joint Research Project (JSPS-STINT (Japan-Sweden))\n\n\"Pre-targeted drug development using Astatin-211 for the treatment of metastatic cancer \" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2018-20 AMED Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control\n\n\"Development of a Therapeutic Agent for Intractable Cancer by Internal Therapy with Alpha-Ray Emitting Nuclei \" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2018-20 Fundamental Research (B)\n\nDevelopment of robotic purification and labeling technology to reduce radiation exposure in short-lived α-ray pharmaceutical manufacturing processes\" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2019-21 Fundamental Research (B)\n\n\"Experimental study of internal irradiation therapy for peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer using super-selective delivery short-lived α-rays\" (Representative: Sachiyo Nomura) (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2020-22 Fundamental Research (B)\n\n\"Optimization of Pretargeting Methods for Targeted Alpha Therapy and Adaptation to Multiple Cancer Types\" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2020-22 Fundamental Research (B)\n\n\"Development of innovative leukemia therapy using alpha-ray emitting radionuclides targeting cancer stem cells\" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2021-23 Fundamental Research (B)\n\n\"Creation of Next-Generation Antibody Drug Conjugate Therapeutics for Advanced Cancer\" (Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2022-24 JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (B)\n\n\"Medical Diagnosis of In Vivo Chemical Environment by Creation of Entangled Photon Pair Emitting Nuclei and Molecular Probes\" (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nFY 2023-27 Fundamental Research (A)\n\n“Development of novel radiopharmaceuticals using α-ray emitters and antibody-based drug delivery systems” (Co-Principal Investigator)\n\nList of publications on radiation research\n\n1*, Yumura, K. et al.
