A certain level of fluency is necessary to maintain the interlocuter’s attention in oral communication and to be able to save speakers’ own face (Lennon, 2000), and oral fluency is also a significant factor in the comprehensibility of L2 speech (Suzuki & Kormos, 2020). Fluency constitutes an important aspect of the assessment of speaking skills in a variety of high-stakes oral proficiency tests and is also a robust indicator of L2 proficiency (Tavakoli et al., 2020). Therefore, it is essential to better understand L2 oral fluency as a construct particularly in the Japanese higher education context where learners need to develop spoken language proficiency for use in future workplace contexts.\n\nIn this presentation, we report two studies forming part of a larger project that has investigated predictors and variability in L2 oral fluency among 128 Japanese university students. Speech data were elicited using four speaking tasks: argumentative task, picture narrative task, and reading-to-speaking, and reading-while-listening-to-speaking task. We assessed utterance fluency (observable temporal features of speech) using measures of speed, breakdown and repair fluency. We measured cognitive fluency, which is defined as speaker's ability to manipulate L2 knowledge efficiently (see Segalowitz, 2010), by means of vocabulary size and grammaticality tests and lexical retrieval, sentence construction and articulatory speed. In the first study, we examined the relationship between the utterance and cognitive fluency, and in the second study we analysed variations in temporal features of fluency across tasks. Our findings yield insights into what L2 skills and knowledge areas learners need to develop to become fluent L2 speakers and how cognitive demands of different types of task can exert an impact on the fluency of students’ performance. The findings can assist in syllabus and curriculum design for university-level language teaching as well as inform the assessment of Japanese university students’ oral communication skills.\n\nReferences:\n\nLennon, P.

Following a brief chapter meeting, during which we will announce officer election results, there will be an EdTech workshop on MALL applications.\n\nThese EdTech practical workshops are for language teachers who want to know more about EdTech and look for different ways to implement new ideas in their teaching. Each presenter will demonstrate an EdTech tool and give the audience some hands-on experience.\n\nAbstract:\n\nFaced with an ever advancing environment of technology in the classroom, research on mobile assisted language learning (MALL) has been lacking, particularly in a Japanese EFL context. The present study surveys 189 Japanese non-English majors in two women’s universities in Japan. The study finds that although most participants had little motivation to study English outside of the classroom, they had generally favourable views on learning language via MALL applications and games. Additionally, more than half of participants reported engaging in autonomous learning via MALL applications outside of the classroom. However, most students did not engage with the applications for a long period of time.\n\nBios:\n\nChristopher Saarna is a graduate of the Temple University Japan TESOL program. He has been working for 8 years in universities and vocational colleges in Japan. His research interests include CALL, Content and Language Integrated Learning, and vocabulary acquisition.\n\nYukiko Yoshihara obtained the Master's degree in TESOL from Temple University Japan. She has taught English at several universities. Her areas of interest include Content and Language Integrated Learning, coaching in teaching, extensive reading/listening, shadowing, Communicative Language Teaching, and learner motivation and autonomy.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nEdTech: Technology-mediated peer feedback for improving students’ writing skills\n\nDate: May 28, 2023\n\nTime: 6pm-7pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/52P9CAkzchk3vP2v6\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/events/s/edtech-technology-mediated-pee/1483747348826133/\n\nEdTech practical workshops are for language teachers who want to know more about EdTech and look for different ways to implement new ideas in their teaching. The presenter will demonstrate an EdTech tool and give the audience some hands-on experience.\n\nAbstract:\n\nPeer feedback can be one of the most useful activities for improving learners’ writing skills, learning autonomy, and critical thinking skills. However, especially in the Asian context, students are struggling to give honest feedback to their peers, mostly for cultural reasons (Nation and Carson, 2016). This issue can be solved using several websites and applications that transform peer feedback into an anonymous and easier-to-handle activity. In this webinar, we will explore technology-mediated peer feedback and propose several approaches and tools to implement it effectively in your courses.\n\nBio:\n\nPanagiota (Penny) Tzanni is an EAP Lecturer and Course Designer at the University of Nottingham Ningbo, China.

The presenter will demonstrate an EdTech tool and give the audience some hands-on experience.\n\nAbstract:\n\nTest drive your own Free Moodle: In this hands-on workshop, participants will be guided through setting up a test-drive Moodle and then how to design a Moodle course to enhance classes. Setup is simple: access the URL https://SOMETHING.demo.wisecat.net and replace “SOMETHING” with a word of your choice. Then follow the on-screen instructions to make your user account and give your new Moodle a name. Note: these test-drive Moodles will be open from the day of the workshop and deleted two weeks later.\n\nParticipants will then be guided through applying the SDCE model to scaffold Moodle use and augment F2F teaching effectively. Several modules will be covered, followed by some tips on how to reduce teacher labour including grading the easy way. Finally, the floor will be opened for questions.\n\nBio:\n\nAdam Jenkins is an educator at the Shizuoka Institute of Science and Technology where he created and is the administrator for the iLearn@SIST e-learning platform.

A PubMed search retrieved 23 papers comparing sleep duration and academic performance, 18 of which concluded there is a relationship between sleep duration and academic performance and the rest of the papers reported either no relationship or inconclusive results.\n\nIs there really a relationship between sleep duration and academic performance? We compiled the data from the above studies into a table and compared their purposes, methods, numbers of participants, regions, gender, and confounding elements in order to investigate the true nature of the reported relationship between sleep time and academic performance.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nTYL event - Teaching English to Young Learners Today: The Singapore Experience\n\nDate: Feb 18, 2023\n\nTime: 2pm-5pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/GH39Z6Fvv3vEBHu57\n\nFacebook: https://fb.me/e/3eEbYqOgq\n\nThis event, sponsored by Tokyo JALT and the TYL SIG, is for teachers of kids to young adults, so teachers of preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, are all encouraged to come! As always, there will be great presentations and lots of time for discussion and networking.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe presentation will first begin with an overview of some of the widely accepted principles for teaching English to young learners. There is general agreement among ELT experts and practitioners that young learners seem to learn best when they are immersed in highly interesting and accessible language, when they get to practice the language in a fun and engaging way and when they get to use the target language for meaningful interactions. They also believe that while some attention to language forms may be needed, the bulk of classroom instruction should be used to expose young children to rich and meaningful language.\n\nThe second part of the presentation will illustrate how these language learning principles play out in a national English language curriculum for young learners in Singapore. Typically starting with receptive skills (e.g., listening to and/or reading highly interesting stories), the learning sequence then extends to productive skills (i.e., speaking and writing), all the while couching the learning in a rich language environment that aims to build greater fluency and enjoyment.\n\nBios:\n\nDr Willy A Renandya is a language teacher educator with extensive teaching experience in Asia. He currently teaches applied linguistics courses at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Each presenter will demonstrate an EdTech tool and give the audience some hands-on experience.\n\nOliver Rose - Three web apps for ‘live’ in-class games\n\nThe presenter will introduce the following web apps which he designed, with input from Paul Raine, who also programmed them:\n\na) LingoMatchLive: In this communication game, players are divided into pairs who have to describe a list of target words to each other without saying the actual word (similar to the well-known ‘taboo’ game). A leaderboard shows the progress of the pairs, adding some fun pressure to communicate more quickly and fluently. It can be accessed free with no registration required here: https://lingomatch.live\n\nb) LingoBingo: This is a bingo game in which the game host describes the target item and can see the progress of players as they respond on their smartphones. Game contents can be customized to use pictures or text. Students can also host a game with their group from their phone. It can be accessed free with no registration required here: https://lingobingo.live\n\nc) LingoLabLive: This game has students competing with each other to create target sentences from given prompts. The prompts can be a combination of text, picture and audio. The answer can be set to one of 3 difficulty modes. It can be accessed free with no registration required here: https://lingolab.live\n\nIn this session the games will be demonstrated and their design and use will be discussed.\n\nAdam Kardos - Digital Gamification for Young Learners\n\nIn recent years we have seen a proliferation of digital learning resources. Many of these make use of gamification in order to keep learners motivated. But are simple digital games and points enough to keep young learners fully engaged and putting in the extra work they need to learn a language? How exactly do digital gamified learning resources motivate young learners? This presentation will use Self Determination Theory to examine the effects of fun, points trophies and other features of gamification on the motivation of young language learners.\n\nBio:\n\nOriginally from Australia, Oliver Rose has taught EFL in Japan for 18 years and currently teaches at Kwansei Gakuin University in Hyogo, Japan.

In EdTech 201, each presenter will demonstrate an EdTech tool and give the audience some hands-on experience.\n\nErin Noxon: Make your own free LL using Google Docs, Classroom, Forms, and Videos\n\nMonitored read-aloud practice, listening to different speakers, answering questions... All things you would love for your students to be able to do in the language lab. But, do you have the time, the budget, and can you find the right software? And how do you even begin to get feedback on how they are learning? What if you could do it all for free, with equipment that you already have lying around, and, after the initial set up time, the class took care of itself? Over the past years I've created my own curriculum out of spare parts, using G Suite tools for voice recognition, Forms-based grading and more. I'll teach you how to do it.\n\nPaul Raine: Nation’s Four Strands and Digital Language Pedagogy with ZenGengo\n\nIn recent years, the move toward blended and hybrid forms of language learning has led many teachers to re-evaluate their digital toolsets. Language teachers in particular need not only a reliable set of tools but also a solid pedagogical framework within which these tools can be put to use. Renowned linguist Paul Nation argues that a well-balanced language course should consist of “Four Strands”: meaning-focused input, meaning-focused output, language- focused learning, and fluency development. In this presentation, the speaker will demonstrate the effectiveness of ZenGengo (www.zengengo.com), a web-based language teaching and learning platform, in creating activities that correspond to Nation's Four Strands.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Erin Noxon teaches at Sagano High School in Kyoto, Japan. She has taught EFL English, science, and Tech & Media skills during her 20+ years of teaching in public schools in the US and Japan. She is a Google Certified Innovator and is currently researching global learning with EdTech, ALT training, and public school blended learning environments.\n\nPaul Raine (MA TEFL/TESL, University of Birmingham 2012) is an award-winning teacher, presenter, author, and developer. His books include the best-selling 50 Ways to Teach with Technology and the innovative multi-path graded reader Journey to Mars. He has helped design and develop several websites for teachers and learners of EFL, including abaxlms.com and zengengo.com. He has published numerous research articles on the teaching and learning of English as a second language, and is particularly interested in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). He currently teaches at universities in the Tokyo area.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nSpelling the foreign: A few observations on katakana and beyond\n\nDate: October 15, 2022\n\nTime: 7-8 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/WRZZAkuxgo67YXiD9\n\nFacebook: https://fb.me/e/75QJYNUP0\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this talk I will deal with the (ortho)graphic representation of Western loan words in Japanese. I start with a brief overview of katakana spelling rules and the phonemic principles behind them. Next I will discuss other available script options for writing loan words, which include not only hiragana and, where available, kanji, but also the roman alphabet. In a third step, I will speculate about how these unaltered roman spellings of loan words are starting to leave their mark on the romanization of domestic Japanese vocabulary, as witnessed by many innovative spellings based on English orthography rather than Hepburn or kunrei rules. These are particularly common in the commercial domain, with examples such as Cocolo for kokoro, Benry for benri, and, most impressively perhaps, alc for aruku.\n\nBio:\n\nI am a linguist with special interest in sociolinguistics, pragmatics, and stylistics. I have done research on multilingual signage in central Tokyo, communication in Japanese eldercare, the language of dating spam mails, and, most recently, address terms in American literature.

MWEs encompass a large set of sequences above the word level, such as collocations (strong tea), binomials (fish and chips), multi-word verbs (put up with), idioms (tie the knot), and so on. These sequences differ in a number of ways; however, what they have in common is that proficient language speakers recognise them as highly familiar and use them extensively.\n\nMWEs are important because they constitute a large proportion of authentic spoken and written discourse, and are considered an essential component of mature linguistic performance. The abundance of MWEs puts them at the forefront of vocabulary teaching and learning. In addition, research suggests that using MWEs can be a quick way of developing fluency, particularly, in the early stages of language learning.\n\nIn the present talk, I will introduce MWEs and review some empirical evidence attesting to an important role they play in second language learning and processing.\n\nBio:\n\nAnna Siyanova-Chanturia is Senior Lecturer in Applied Linguistics at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Anna’s research aims to answer important theoretical, practical and methodological questions pertaining to how humans learn and use a second language.

Through conducting various studies on these topics, we have explored how we as EFL instructors can facilitate our students’ positive group dynamics and strengthening their English-learning motivation as well as their engagement in English-mediated socializing.\n\nAs outcomes of those studies, we were able to introduce some new GD-related concepts or pedagogies, one of which is Becoming Ideal Classmates (BIC). We introduced Ideal Classmates as a way to provide cognitive and emotional scaffolding that fosters students’ interactive learning and well-becoming. The pedagogy involves first asking students to describe the kinds of helpful behaviors for language learning that they would like to see in their classmates. Then by sharing these ideas, students start to co-construct images of their ideal classmates, and these images can become meta-cognitively understood, potentially creating a turn toward group-caring and altruism through self-transformation; an effect called reciprocal idealizing (i.e. the more I want others to do x for me, the more I myself seem to do x for others.)\n\nWe started working on the Ideal Classmates research in 2012 and kept working with it for approximately 10 years.

Following a brief chapter meeting, during which we will announce officer election results, Dr. Coxhead will speak about Vocabulary in Instructional Materials. We hope you can join us!\n\nAbstract:\n\nInstructional materials (e.g. textbooks, teachers’ handouts and even teacher talk) are important sources of input for learners in any context. This talk reports on three studies on the vocabulary of each of these kinds of input and provides practical suggestions for carrying out similar studies of such materials. Finally, we will consider two approaches to evaluating popular textbook exercises for vocabulary.\n\nBio:\n\nProfessor Averil Coxhead teaches undergraduate and postgraduate courses in vocabulary, EAP, TESOL and Applied Linguistics in the School of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, Aotearoa/New Zealand.

Averil is currently researching specialised vocabulary, including multiword units, in spoken and written English in the trades and higher education.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nMind, Brain, and Education Series Part 4: Stories in the Brain . . . and in the Classroom\n\nDate: June 03, 2022\n\nTime: 7-8 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nRSVP: https://forms.gle/ZCr1LT2roG949ygr7\n\nFacebook: https://fb.me/e/3fd0osTIA\n\nThe Tokyo chapter of JALT and the Mind, Brain, and Education SIG are happy to be co-sponsoring this 4-part series. We hope to expand your knowledge of the interaction of psychology (the 'mind' part) and neuroscience (the 'brain' part), and their application to teaching (the 'education' part).\n\nAbstract:\n\nStorytelling and education have a long and flourishing partnership. From antiquity to the present day, the power of stories has been recognised. It is the power to deliver a lesson and make sure it is not only remembered but learnt.\n\nThis presentation examines stories in the classroom from a Brain Science perspective and explores what lies behind their power to educate: they engage the emotions; they facilitate the sharing of meaning; they engage the mechanisms of social learning (learning from and for others); they provide patterned slices of experience; and this in turn support predictions based on past experience. In other words, stories play to many of the learning strengths of the human brain.\n\nAfter a theoretical examination of the factors that lend stories their power, we will then exchange ideas for harnessing that power in all levels of foreign language learning. Bring your story-based learning ideas and I will bring mine.\n\nAfter all, who doesn’t like a good story? And that, my friends, is the point.\n\nBio:\n\nStephen M. Ryan teaches at Sanyo Gakuen University, in Okayama, and is active in JALT’s Mind, Brain, and Education SIG.

New educational possibilities have opened up, but new demands are also being made of education. As teachers, we are called on to help our students deal with a social and educational context of digital disarray, characterised by digital distraction (due to competing attentional demands), digital disorder (due to the proliferation of misinformation, disinformation and fake news), and digital disconnection from the self and others (due to superficial and antagonistic interactions with otherness).\n\nThis seminar charts the kinds of changes that have taken place, examines the ways in which digital literacies can help to deal with these changes, and suggests that improving digital literacy skills can be a way of beginning to promote digital wellness for both teachers and students.\n\nDrawing on the Framework of Digital Literacies, first proposed by Gavin Dudeney, Nicky Hockly and Mark Pegrum in 2013, now used in a range of language learning initiatives in Europe and elsewhere, and subsequently revised in 2018 and 2022, we will look at a series of key literacies of major relevance to language teaching and learning, including information literacy, intercultural literacy, ethical literacy, attentional literacy and critical literacy.\n\nThe time has come for language teachers to promote digital literacies – and digital wellness – alongside the teaching of language itself.\n\nBio:\n\nAssociate Professor Mark Pegrum is a Lecturer in Digital Learning in the Graduate School of Education at The University of Western Australia in Perth, where he is also the Deputy Head of School (International). In his courses, he specialises in digital technologies in education, with a particular focus on mobile learning. He is a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, and his teaching has been recognised through Faculty and University Excellence in Teaching Awards, as well as a 2010 national Australian Learning & Teaching Council (ALTC) Excellence in Teaching Award. His current research focuses on digital literacies and especially attentional literacy; mobile and emerging technologies, including extended reality (XR); and the forms digital learning takes in diverse contexts across the Global North and South. His books include: Brave New Classrooms: Democratic Education and the Internet (co-edited with Joe Lockard, 2007); From Blogs to Bombs: The Future of Digital Technologies in Education (2009); Digital Literacies (co-authored with Gavin Dudeney & Nicky Hockly, 2013); Mobile Learning: Languages, Literacies and Cultures (2014); Mobile Lenses on Learning: Languages and Literacies on the Move (2019); and Digital Literacies (2nd ed.; co-authored with Gavin Dudeney & Nicky Hockly, 2022).

We hope to expand your knowledge of the interaction of psychology (the 'mind' part) and neuroscience (the 'brain' part), and their application to teaching (the 'education' part).\n\nAbstract:\n\nMusic is found in all cultures worldwide. It is an international language that communicates emotion across other language barriers. Importantly, listening to music involves the whole brain. We will explore how music is processed not only through our ears and auditory cortex, but also through our senses of touch and sight, and how we can recall music through visual and tactile stimuli as well as an audio stimulus. We will experience how instrumental music activates areas of the brain associated with language. And understand why motor areas of our brain are activated automatically when we hear music, even when we are sitting or lying still. These phenomena explain why using music in a classroom is especially stimulating and conducive to learning. Participants will be invited to share the ways in which they use music in their classrooms and the positive outcomes they have experienced. The presenter will also introduce additional suggestions for using music to stimulate language learning both in the face-to-face classroom and when teaching online.\n\nBio:\n\nAmanda Gillis-Furutaka is a professor in the Department of English at Kyoto Sangyo University. She has an MA in TESOL from the University of Birmingham and a PhD in music from the University of London Goldsmiths College.

We hope to expand your knowledge of the interaction of psychology (the 'mind' part) and neuroscience (the 'brain' part), and their application to teaching (the 'education' part).\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis session will take an introductory look at the three main kinds of memory--sensory, working, and long-term--and look at how they work together during the learning process. In addition, we'll explore how the memory types interact in Cognitive Load Theory, one of the major theories of learning today. With this theory in mind, we'll end by discussing and reflecting on the implications for teachers and practical ways to apply these ideas in our classrooms.\n\nBio:\n\nJulia Daley currently teaches English writing and conversation at Hiroshima Bunkyo University.

Those that do are more likely to engage, more likely to stay on task, and more likely to produce a positive energy. They are a pleasure to teach. Those that don't are a labor. In those classes, speaking activities erode into silence, exercises get only minimally completed, absence rates are high, and sometimes there is an ether of negativity. We know some factors that cause these class conditions, such as: whether it is after lunch or not, appropriacy of materials, teacher attitude, but we'd like to explore another cause, the C factor, rarely mentioned in the literature, but extremely important in aiding student learning, achievement, and even mental health.\n\nNeuroscientists like Lieberman have recently identified how this key factor is a part of the Default Mode Network, and psychologists like Cozolino explain that in overlooking it, Western psychology has put forward a wrong definition of “human.” We consider it the most important factor in getting students into the right “brain state” for learning, borrowing an expression from Terry Small.\n\nTo find out what the C Factor is, and how you can strengthen it, come to this workshop.

Negotiation is a form of communication that requires more than just language ability. It requires being able to listen to, and communicate with, others within a milieu of diverse language abilities, academic, professional and cultural backgrounds in an increasingly global society. Added to this is the reality that the majority of English spoken globally is English as a Lingua Franca (ELF). Model United Nations (MUN) simulations are uniquely positioned to help students develop their language ability and their global competencies, as well as being ideal opportunities for participants to experience ELF in an intensely communicative context. A common goal in MUN simulations is to prepare students to solve complex problems that are associated with living in a technological, competitive, and globally connected world. This presentation will introduce some insights drawn from research on ELF in MUN simulations and will summarize some of the best practices in MUN event and delegate preparation.\n\nIntroduction: Contextualizing New Perspectives: ELF in MUN Simulations\n\nPart 1 ELF, GLOBAL EDUCATION, AND LEARNING IN MUN\n\nPart 2 BEST PRACTICES IN MUN EVENT PREPARATION\n\nPart 3 BEST PRACTICES IN MUN DELEGATE PREPARATION\n\nQ&A followed by Informal Discussion\n\nBio:\n\nDonna Tatsuki was awarded both an M.Ed and Ed.D degrees in Applied Linguistics from Temple University Japan.

This event will start with an overview, defining AOL, followed by a demonstration of how the presenters and their colleagues have mapped the goals and objectives of an English curriculum. Next, an overview of the recent aims of the AOL project will be introduced with reports focusing on three specific areas. One purpose of this will be to show how the AOL framework encourages accountability, systematicity, and rigour. Additionally, this framework is as much for a broader curriculum as it is for an individual course. This event will be of interest to language program coordinators, administrators and teachers who are concerned with a quality culture but perhaps not sure where to begin or how to incorporate AOL in their programs and their classrooms.\n\nBios:\n\nMaiko Berger has taught English at university over the past 14 years.

Alliteration. Onset-rime. What are they and how can they be taught? This presentation will explore the introduction, instruction, and challenges of beginning literacy skills in a Japanese preschool English program. The differences between phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, and phonics will be discussed, along with the sequencing and progression of these skills. Practical and easily made activities and resources for pre-literacy learners will also be shared.\n\nBio:\n\nMartin Sedaghat is an English teacher and curriculum designer for the Niigata University of Health and Welfare International Preschool. Originally from California, USA, he has lived in Niigata Prefecture since 2003. Martin is currently studying for his MA in TESOL, and is particularly interested in the use of picture books, board games, and art projects in second language acquisition. He is also serving as the Program Chair for the JALT Teaching Younger Learners Special Interest Group.\n\nSession 2\n\nPresenter: Namiko Tsuruta\n\nTitle: Raising Curious and Confident Readers from the Bottom Up\n\nAbstract:\n\nReading is a skill which most of our EFL learners will hone for the rest of their lives. Rather than worrying about their graded reader homework compliance at the tertiary level, why aren’t we engaging them more in reading many years before that?\n\nBased on my own EFL experience with literacy in the US and my 23 years of EFL teaching experience in Japan, I have found that reading in English is an important but complex process that needs to be encouraged and monitored, and well before our primary school learners pick up a textbook in the 5th grade. Listening to and engaging with picture books as toddlers fosters a love of language that, if nurtured, can develop into independent reading fluency.\n\nPlease join me as we review some of the fundamental processes in L2 literacy development. Come ready to discuss what we can do as foreign language teachers to foster our learners’ love of reading. We hope all our learners will succeed in passing the English section of their university’s entrance examination; more importantly, though, we should focus on helping our learners develop more advanced literacy skills, so they can stay current and remain relevant in this ever-evolving global and digital world.\n\nBio:\n\nSince 1999, Ms. Tsuruta has been teaching English in nursery, primary and secondary schools as well as working in private language schools and teaching business English in the Kanto area. She has also trained ALTs and JTEs in team-teaching and group learning environments in Ibaraki, Nagano and Tokyo for many years. Ms. Tsuruta is currently Program Director of Global Language Institute (GLI) and Creative Director of thetokyolife.jp. Her most recent presentation was at the 2021 international JALT conference where she shared GLI’s one-year virtual exchange project with students in Japan and Nepal. Her research interests include learner identity, autonomy, performance in education, sustainable learning and education, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nSession 3\n\nPresenter: Lawrence Hong\n\nTitle: Three Keys to a Successful Phonics Program\n\nAbstract:\n\nIt seems like everyone is teaching phonics these days. In a recent unofficial facebook poll between phonics and sight words, roughly 90% of respondents reported using phonics as their main focus when teaching reading. And why not? Phonics gives students the necessary skills to deconstruct and reconstruct words.\n\nWhile most reading programs in private language schools focus on phonics, you can be sure that no two programs are the same. So how do you design an effective phonics program? By making sure that learning is achievable, motivating, and meaningful. Just like phonics can break down large words into achievable parts, Lawrence will show you how to deconstruct and reconstruct an effective phonics program that will transform your students into motivated readers.\n\nBio:\n\nGraduating in 2006 from the University of California (LA), Lawrence has been teaching English in Japan since 2007 in a variety of contexts, including large eikaiwa chain schools, small private English schools, private kindergartens, and public elementary schools. For the past eight years, he has been running AES Eikaiwa, a private children’s English school in beautiful Tarui, Gifu. As the sole teacher, he has been able to focus on the many different types of personalities of his students and on creating a successful curriculum to serve them all. While his degree in mathematical economics has allowed him to effectively systematize many aspects of his business, he believes that because each child is different, learning within a rigid system is ineffective.\n\nLawrence is involved with ETJ, JALT, and numerous unofficial professional development groups. He stands on the shoulders of giants, and wouldn't be where he is today without the help and encouragement from countless amazing teachers and mentors. He enjoys snowboarding and bouldering in his free time, but his recent dad bod will make you question that.\n\nTeaching Younger Learners in Tokyo\n\nDate: February 21st\n\nTime: 2-5 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFee: Free for everyone\n\nContact: tokyojaltyl@gmail.com\n\nEvent flyer: https://drive.google.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/230039791967592\n\nThis event, sponsored by Tokyo JALT and the TYL SIG, is for teachers of kids to young adults, so teachers of preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, are all encouraged to come! As always, there will be great, short presentations and lots of time for discussion and networking. Here is the line-up of presenters:\n\nEric Kane: Boom Chicka Boom Boom - Rhythm and Melody Basics in the Classroom\n\nCOVID-19 has affected families, friends and all professions, including teachers. Especially teachers! Our school found ourselves leaning a lot on online resources, and as we primarily teach children, most of those resources were chants and songs. Why is that? Rhythm and melody are core components in a child’s path towards English language acquisition. Understanding and using these concepts frequently can increase the depth and pace in which our students acquire language. The best part? It’s pretty easy. Bonus!\n\nIn this online seminar, we will look at how and why the human brain absorbs language easier and better when funky beats are a part of the curriculum. We will look at practical ways of incorporating this into our classrooms and hopefully have a darn good time doing it.\n\nBio: Eric has spent the past 25 years in Japan as a student, teacher, school owner, YouTuber, and founder of ELF Learning. In his free time he enjoys barbecuing, craft beer, spending time in Nagano, and tickling penguins when the opportunity arises.\n\nBen Shearon: From Torture to Bliss: How a focus on fluency made JHS English better for teachers and students\n\nTeaching junior high school students in an eikaiwa setting is a challenge for many schools. Often students and parents choose to move to a juku to focus on 'academic English' and even students that remain can feel their studies are not helping them much with their school classes.\n\nIn this presentation I will describe the evolution of a medium-sized eikaiwa's English classes for junior high school students, and how they went from the least enjoyable to most enjoyable to teach. Student engagement, achievement, recruitment, and retention went through the roof after implementing these changes. For teachers at public and private junior high schools it should be possible to implement the same principles in regular school English classes.\n\nBio: Ben Shearon was born in Germany and grew up in Spain but is saddled with a British passport. He's been teaching for 21 years, 20 of them in Japan and has taught in public elementary, junior, and senior high schools as well as universities. He helps his wife run an English school, blogs infrequently at sendaiben.org and writes about personal finance on his other website.\n\nLesley Ito: Teaching grammar to children: What's the best way?\n\nPeople often mistakenly think that methods used to teach grammar to adults , such as explicit teaching of grammar rules using meta-language or consciousness-raising, will work well with children.\n\nThe presenter will share what current literature says on this matter, as well as the results of her own action research. Methods that are effective for teaching grammar to children will be demonstrated, such as storytelling and extensive reading, as well as grammar triggers, a method developed by the presenter in her own classroom.\n\nBio: Lesley Ito is a well-known teacher, teacher trainer, school owner, and award-winning materials writer based in Nagoya. She has taught in Japan for over twenty-five years, won “Best of JALT” in 2011, and has presented professionally throughout Japan, and at the ER World Congress in Dubai, UAE. Winner of the 2015 LLL Award in the Young Learner Category for Backstage Pass, her ELT writing credits include teacher’s guides, workbooks, graded readers, and the e-book Fifty Ways to Teach Young Learners: Tips for ESL/EFL Teachers.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nEdTech 201 - Workshops - Bringing EdTech Tools to the F2F Classroom\n\nDate: Friday, March 19th, 2021\n\nTime: 19:00 - 20:00\n\nFee: Free for all\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nQuestions: TokyoJALTEdTech@gmail.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/176091397639069\n\nEdTech 201 is a practical workshop for language teachers who want to know more about EdTech and look for different ways to implement new ideas in their teaching. The theme of this workshop is ‘Bringing EdTech to Face-to-face Classroom.’ In 2021, we are transitioning out of online class and back to campus. Some of us might be teaching f2f or hybrid classes. We are hoping to help instructors with the change. In EdTech 201, each presenter will demonstrate an EdTech tool that can be used in f2f or hybrid settings and give the audience some hands-on experience.\n\nPresenters & Topics:\n\nChris Mattson - Google Classroom & G Suite\n\nJason Pipe - Kahoot!\n\nReturn to the top\n\nTeaching Younger Learners in Tokyo\n\nDate: June 20, 2021\n\nTime: 2-5 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFee: Free for everyone\n\nContact: tokyojaltyl@gmail.com\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/events/215874200323634\n\nThis event, sponsored by Tokyo JALT and the TYL SIG, is for teachers of kids to young adults, so teachers of preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, are all encouraged to come! As always, there will be great, short presentations and lots of time for discussion and networking. This time, our presenters will address the overarching theme of Collaboration.\n\nSession 1\n\nPresenter: Barbara Hoskins Sakamoto\n\nTitle: Adventures in Global Collaboration\n\nAbstract:\n\nOnce upon a time in the late 1980s, a publisher thought there might be enough demand to maybe justify the risk in creating a different kind of textbook for children learning English – a book specifically designed to teach English as a foreign language. With authors in different countries and editors in yet another country, and no Internet, collaboration was an adventure! In this session, Barbara will share how collaborative methods have changed since those early days of fax machines, conference calls, and hotel meetings. In addition to some (hopefully) entertaining stories, she will share some of the factors that she believes are essential in creating and sustaining a long-term collaborative team.\n\nBio:\n\nBarbara Hoskins Sakamoto came to Japan in 1985 with an MATESOL and a plan to teach for two years. While she has left the country since then, she always seems to return. Barbara is a co-author of one of the world’s best-selling textbook series for children learning English, Let’s Go (Oxford University Press), co-author of the online course, English for Teachers (International Teacher Development Institute), and author of the chapter, The role of technology in early years language education, in Early Years Second Language Education (Routledge, 2015). She is an English Language Specialist with the United States State Department and is Course Director for International Teacher Development Institute (iTDi.pro).\n\nSession 2\n\nPresenter: Mari Nakamura\n\nTitle: Promoting Young Learners’ Core Skills Through Intercultural Collaboration\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn this increasingly complex society, promoting young learners’ core skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, digital literacy, and collaboration must be considered indispensable. The importance of these skills was emphasized in the MEXT 2017 Course of Study, and as of the 2019 academic year, efforts to integrate these elements into English language instruction in elementary schools have begun. In this practical session, Mari will share her two most recent projects for students of different age groups, showing how developmentally appropriate intercultural exchange projects can help young learners attain these essential skills. By joining this session, participants will be able to explore the applicability of such projects to their own teaching contexts.\n\nBio:\n\nMari Nakamura teaches young learners at her language school in Kanazawa while managing MELEP, a professional development community for teachers of young learners, and teaching part time at Kanazawa University. Her main interests are literacy education and intercultural exchange projects. Besides teaching young learners and collaborating with professionals, she loves listening to music and is always on the lookout for new up-and-coming artists.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nState of the Chapter with featured guest Zoltán Dörnyei: Long-term motivational persistence in language learning\n\nDate: July 2, 2021\n\nTime: 6:45-8 pm\n\nFee: Free for everyone\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/events/502529167448703\n\nAs part of our annual State of the Chapter event, we are very happy to welcome Zoltán Dörnyei as our featured speaker.\n\nFollowing a brief chapter meeting, during which we will announce officer election results, Dr. Dörnyei will speak about long-term motivational persistence in language learning. He would also like to engage with as many attendees as possible during the Q&A portion of the event, so please have a think about questions you'd like to ask!\n\nAbstract:\n\nMotivation concerns the choice and direction of a particular action, the effort expended on it and the long-term persistence with it. However, the last motivational dimensions – long-term persistence – has received far less attention in past research than the other components, even though student motivation is known to display continuous ebbs and flows as well as a steady ‘leak’, that is, a tendency to peter out with time. This paper will describe the main components of motivational persistence, and will offer several strategies to promote it in language learners.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nZoltán Dörnyei is Professor of Psycholinguistics at the School of English, University of Nottingham. He has published extensively on second language acquisition and language learning motivation, and he is the author of over 25 books, including Research Methods in Applied Linguistics (2007, Oxford University Press), The Psychology of the Language Learner Revisited (2015, Routledge, with S. Ryan), Innovations and Challenges in Language Learning Motivation (2020, Routledge) and Engaging Language Learners in Contemporary Classrooms (2020, Cambridge University Press, with S. Mercer).\n\nReturn to the top\n\nArt and Creativity online social event\n\nDate: July 21, 2021\n\nTime: 7-9 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/events/345757353716204\n\nDrop by for conversation about Art and Creativity, inside and outside of the classroom.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nTeaching Entrepreneurship Through Experiential Learning\n\nDate: October 9, 2021\n\nTime: 7-8 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/981889565976338\n\nPoster: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qagb1C8q9OahRBW5Uq0qbChMpT0KtP_m/view?usp=sharing\n\nAt this year's PanSIG, Steven Quasha and Daniel Mills did a poster presentation on Teaching Entrepreneurship Through Experiential Learning. We are happy to welcome them for an extended discussion and workshop on the topic and hope you'll be able to join us.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe rate of women entrepreneurs in Japan is abysmally low compared to other nations. In fact, Japan ranks last among OECD countries, and data indicates that a mere 17% of Japanese women declared to have knowledge about starting or growing their own business. The current situation indicates the need for learning materials that not only introduce the topic of entrepreneurship to all students but also showcase female models of business success. To this end, the presenters have created a series of experiential learning materials centered around a strong female character, Mirai Takahashi, who is in the process of launching a business start-up with the guidance of her mentor, Catherine Sakamoto. Through Takahashi’s successes and failures, students experience the risks and rewards of starting their own company.\n\nThis workshop will showcase how to utilize these materials and demonstrate how perceptions of entrepreneurship, gender equality, and digital transformation in business are crucial for students. The presenters will describe their current efforts to gather both quantitative and qualitative data for these studies and share their initial results.\n\nSpeaker bios:\n\nSteven E. Quasha is an associate professor in the Faculty of Modern Management at Sugiyama Jogakuen University in Nagoya. He holds an MA in Asian Studies from San Diego State University and an MA in TESOL from Macquarie University. He also has a teacher trainer certificate from the School for International Training (SIT). His research interests include language assessment, business English, and using technology in the classroom.\n\nDaniel J. Mills is an associate professor at Ritsumeikan University in the Faculty of Economics and holds an MS.Ed. in TESOL from Shenandoah University along with an Ed.D. in Instructional Technology from the University of Wyoming. His research interests include Informal Learning with Technology, Mobile Learning, and Technology Adoption.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nTeaching Younger Learners in Tokyo\n\nDate: October 24, 2021\n\nTime: 2-5 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/1287359025014354\n\nThis event, sponsored by Tokyo JALT and the TYL SIG, is for teachers of kids to young adults, so teachers of preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school, are all encouraged to come! As always, there will be great, short presentations and lots of time for discussion and networking.\n\nHere is the line-up of presenters:\n\nSession 1\n\nPresenter: Kim Takeda\n\nTitle: Adapting and Developing Teaching Strategies to Meet the Challenges and Innovations of Teaching English in Japan\n\nAbstract:\n\nBack in 1988, I was one of the 848 participants selected to become an Assistant Language (English) Teacher in the second year of the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme. Having taught elementary school for 8 years in Los Angeles, I felt well-prepared and ready to teach English to my new students. Well, much to my surprise, English Education in Japan was not exactly what I expected. I had to quickly adjust and revise my teaching strategies to best meet the needs of my students and the Japanese school system. Five prefectures, 50 plus schools, and 33 years later, it’s been interesting watching how English Education in Japan has evolved. I think most of the changes have been extremely positive, but change also brings about new challenges. So, what can teachers of English do to level up their game and prepare themselves for these challenges and innovations? In this presentation, let’s take a look at some of the biggest challenges and innovations in English Education in Japan today. I will be sharing some tips and ideas about how any teacher of English can adapt their current teaching styles and/or develop strategies to meet these challenges.\n\nBio:\n\nKim Takeda is from Los Angeles and has taught for over 40 years, 33 of them being in Japan. She is now teaching English for Global Communication at Keio Yokohama Elementary School which is an affiliate school of Keio University. Before coming to Japan, she taught elementary school for 8 years in Los Angeles and earned her Master&#39;s degree in Humanistic Education. After teaching high school for 13 years in Tottori prefecture, she returned to teaching elementary school and has taught at various elementary schools, including 2 English immersion schools, in Osaka, Shizuoka, and Gunma prefectures. In her free time, Kim enjoys hanging out with her dog Sinbad, live streaming, and watching her favorite shows and movies. She is probably best known at school as the teacher with the most unusual Halloween costumes.\n\nSession 2\n\nPresenter: Satomi Miura\n\nTitle: The importance of incorporating more hands-on activities into our upper level primary school English classes\n\nAbstract:\n\nAfter a two-year transition period, a foreign language (English) became a formally assessed subject in primary schools in Japan from April 2020 alongside new textbooks for Year 5 and Year 6. Consequently, the amount and content of English to be learned in upper primary school has increased, resulting in some confusion amongst both teachers and children. Some children even seem to have become demotivated at this early stage of learning an additional language. Amidst all this, educators have become keenly aware of the importance of hands-on or experiential activities. These types of activities allow children to become more engaged with the topics and content being studied while helping them retain knowledge by stimulating multiple areas of the brain. In this presentation, I will introduce some of the activities that have been effective in my classes, including “Let’s Fetch Water!” and “Lap Book Project: Food Chain.”\n\nBio:\n\nSatomi Miura has been involved in foreign language activities as a JTE and ALT at elementary schools in Iwate since 1999. Between 2005 and 2006, Satomi studied at Camosun College in Canada, focusing on ESL, psychology, and counseling. She received her Canadian TESL certification in 2006 and was a recipient of that year’s International Student Award. In 2007, Satomi opened her own English conversation school, IE TreeHouse. She is currently an ALT at Hanamaki Board of Education in Iwate, and teaches at four public primary schools. She is also a J-SHINE Trainer and a part-time lecturer at Iwate University.\n\nSession 3\n\nPresenter: Nicholas J. Wilson\n\nTitle: Exploring the World through ICT in Elementary School\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe new English textbooks for elementary schools include units and sections dedicated to foreign countries and cultures. However, these are limited in both content and variety. What if we could empower students with the autonomy to explore the world, and give them the opportunities and skills to research, discover and share the tales of their virtual trips with their classmates? In this presentation I will discuss how a digital approach to foreign language education can help teachers switch roles with their students, and let their curiosity become the fuel for creating engaging and entertaining classes.\n\nBio:\n\nNicholas J. Wilson teaches English in public elementary schools in Nagano. He is also a Google Certified Educator, focused on fostering student’s 21st-century skills through foreign language education. An active JALT officer, Nicholas organizes independent professional development opportunities for ALTs including Agorà, a monthly interactive live event as part of the ALT Training Online grassroots initiative.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nJill Hadfield: Constraints and Creativity in Online Teaching\n\nDate: Saturday, November 27, 2021\n\nTime: 10-11 am\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/899280327415888\n\nAbstract:\n\nHow can you overcome the constraints of teaching without a physical classroom or the appropriate materials, in order to teach live online in a way you feel is best ELT practice? This interactive talk will answer that and show how, paradoxically, these constraints can lead to creative and novel activities for language teaching.\n\nBio:\n\nJill Hadfield has worked in France, China, Tibet and Madagascar and was until last year Associate Professor in Language Teacher Education, Unitec, New Zealand. She is currently working freelance, writing and editing ELT materials. She has published 40 books for language teachers including the Communication Games series, Classroom Dynamics, Introduction to Language Teaching and Motivating Learning. She has also written two travel books and a novel. She is currently interested in bringing research into practice through the Research and Resources in Language Teaching series, creativity in language teaching and online interaction. Her book Interaction Online, with Lindsay Clandfield (CUP) was shortlisted for the Ben Warren Prize and the ELTons Award for Innovation in Teacher Resources. Her latest book Live Online Teaching co-authored with Lindsay Clandfield was published this year by Pavilion Publishing.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nChiyuki Yanase: Enhancing Language Teacher Well-being\n\nDate: Saturday, December 4, 2021\n\nTime: 6:30-7:30 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/1327149631070467\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn the language classroom, the teacher’s state of mind can affect the mood, emotions, and motivation of learners (Mercer & Gregersen, 2020). Despite the importance of teacher wellbeing, educators tend to prioritize the wellbeing of their students and neglect to focus on their own physical as well as psychological health. In this workshop, I will explain why teacher wellbeing matters and share activities that can enhance teacher wellbeing during these uncertain and stressful times.\n\nBio:\n\nChiyuki Yanase is a lecturer at several universities including Keio and Chuo University. She has been teaching English for over 30 years at various institutions and holds an MSc in TESOL for Young Learners from Aston University in the U.K. Her current research interests focus on developing autonomy, creativity, and self-efficacy of learners as well as teacher wellbeing.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nTokyo JALT Showcase\n\nDate: Friday, December 10, 2021\n\nTime: 7-9 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/3014119545507365\n\nGuy Smith & John Peloghitis: The Future of Critical Thinking – Countering Cognitive Bias\n\nAbstract:\n\nCognitive bias is emerging as one of the key challenges for future critical thinking instructional approaches. One of the key objectives of critical thinking courses and materials is to teach students how to think in a clearer, more rational, and more open-minded manner. Research from psychology, economics, cognitive science and other fields shows that in order to achieve this it is important to mitigate or forestall the effects of distorted and flawed reasoning that can emerge as a result of cognitive bias. Cognitive bias has received significant attention in regards to practical considerations in fields such as medicine, business, leadership, and economics as it has been shown to play a powerful role in negatively impacting clear thinking. As yet, it has received limited attention in most educational critical thinking instruction and most teachers are unaware of how cognitive bias works, its implications for the classroom, and what they can do to mitigate the negative impact of cognitive bias. This presentation first provides an overview of cognitive bias. It looks at some of the more common biases that can appear in classroom tasks and suggests some strategies for teachers to address the negative effects that biases can have on the development of critical thinking skills in language learning contexts and other areas of learning. Debiasing refers to teaching and activating thinking or behavioral habits that prevent, mitigate, and control the negative effects of cognitive biases, leading to an enabled and enhanced ability to practice and develop critical thinking skills. Based on the body of research regarding debiasing, this presentation explains practical ideas for how language teachers of all levels and also those who teach in other areas can introduce debiasing into their critical thinking teaching through close discussion of some actual lesson plans.\n\nBios:\n\nGuy Smith – My teaching and research interests are understanding cognitive bias in education and critical thinking, self-determination theory, and teacher and student well being.\n\nJohn Peloghitis - I teach academic reading and writing, debate, and research writing. I am interested in second language writing, metacognitive strategies, syllabus design, and critical thinking.\n\nDeborah Maxfield: Impact of Online Teamwork on Anxiety and Group Cohesion\n\nAbstract:\n\nResearch has suggested that forming cohesive ingroups can increase self-esteem (Tajfel & Turner,1978; Dovidio et al., 2009) and reduce anxiety (Lee & Robbins,1998) as well as foster motivation (Dornyei & Murphey, 2003; Deci & Ryan, 2000). However, whether these relationships exist for online contexts remains under-researched.\n\nIn 2020, two new courses (Presentation and Debate) were made compulsory for all first-year students at a major university, and were taught entirely online. Based on previous psychological and EFL research, students were assigned to regular groups for 3-4 weeks to encourage peer support and, thereby, (a) decrease anxiety and (b) foster motivation. At the end of the term, over 200 students were surveyed about their experiences with online teamwork using a 6-point Likert scale survey. Their perceptions of online group work, including cohesion and efficacy, impacts on social and state anxiety, effects on motivation, and other concerns were analyzed.\n\nInitial analysis suggests that the overwhelming majority of students found teamwork helpful and enjoyable during the course and reported feeling less language learner anxiety overall due to teamwork, yet some still reported language learner or social anxiety. These results and more will be explored in greater detail in this presentation.\n\nBio:\n\nAs a Lecturer in English Education at Rikkyo University, Tokyo, I am conducting research on how psychology is mediated by L2 learning environments.\n\nKeiko Nakamura: Analysis of Junior HIgh School English Textbooks Focusing on Cross-Cultural Understanding\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology issued the latest Course of Study for junior high schools and its new explanatory guide in 2017. One of the goals the new educational guideline is ‘to develop an understanding of the culture behind a foreign language’. In addition, the explanatory guide aims learners should acquire a spirit of tolerance, acceptance of others, peace, and international contribution through the study of foreign languages, and also requires that learners should be able to think in many different ways. In accordance with the new guideline, new government-approved English textbooks were published by six different publishers. Those newly published textbooks are fully used from April 2021. As learners who learn English in the EFL environment, they rely on textbooks in English classes as well as their teachers. Thus, it is worth examining how newly published textbooks deal with ‘cross-cultural understanding’. This study conducted a quantitative analysis of cross-cultural materials which appeared in the new textbooks, as compared to older versions of the textbooks. Referring to previous studies, the number of times which the materials related to ‘global issues (including race issues)’, ‘foreign cultures (including the way of living and foods)’, ‘Japanese cultures (including furoshiki and how to celebrate events)’ and ‘comparative cultures (including the way learners address teachers, the differences between student life in Japan and the U.S.) appeared in the textbooks are recorded. It was found that there are more appearances of the materials which related to ‘global issues’ and ‘foreign cultures’ in the newly published textbooks than older ones. However, these materials do not provide learners an immediate understanding of different cultures. It is hoped that the effective use of these materials by the instructors in the classroom will enhance the learners' communication skills.\n\nBio:\n\nKeiko Nakamura has previously worked as a part-time teacher at a Junior High School, and now teaches at several universities in Kanto area.\n\nSanduni Sarathchandra: How to implement a CLIL lesson in a university academic speaking course to teach critical thinking skills\n\nAbstract:\n\nCoyle, Hood & Marsh (2010) define that the “Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is a dual-focused educational approach in which additional language is used for the learning and teaching of both content and language” (p.1). CLIL is an influential and evolving learning approach. It encourages language learning by understanding the authentic communication and training skills in the course of active participation. Teachers play important roles as trainers, supporters, monitors, assessors and guides. Similarly, learners act as receivers, risk takers and innovators. Through CLIL, learners are able to practice how to make the maximum use of one’s own communicative skills to move from L1 to L2. It provides a chance for students to learn helpfully and also it triggers learners’ apparent aptitudes to use and deal with the target language in a proficient way. Because language learners try to learn the content using a foreign language, they have a good chance to communicate with their peers via listening and speaking. It is this collaboration that is presumed to comfort language acquisition where learners are willing to understand each other and to present their individual thoughts. Language teachers in foreign language context can effectively employ CLIL in order to offer learners with a natural background for language application. At the same time teachers can provide a productive input of L2 for students, upsurge their skills to interact efficiently, and to boost students’ enthusiasm to the lesson.\n\nIn this Practice-oriented presentation, I show teachers how to effectively integrate the content and language via a CLIL lesson and implement it in the university sophomore language classroom to teach academic speaking, and thus enabling students to state their opinion in a logically structured way based on their learning from the class. A detailed CLIL lesson plan will be explored in this presentation.\n\nBio:\n\nSanduni Sarathchandra is a Lecturer in English Communication at Reitaku University. Her research interests include Material Development for Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), Test Preparation in Language Assessment, Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT), and Language Learners in Classroom Research.\n\nYuka Masda & Kana Watanabe: Can aerobic exercise be used as a strategy to reduce Test Anxiety? (short student presentation)\n\nAbstract:\n\nYoshida and Masda (10, November, 2020, Tokyo JALT) examined literature and concluded aerobic exercise may be an effective method to alleviate test anxiety in college students. Test anxiety is defined as excessive worries about taking tests and is believed to have negative impacts on students’ test performance. In recent years, reports of the cognitive function-enhancing effects of aerobic exercise have attracted attention (Hillman, Erickson &amp; Kramer, 2008 et al.). Aerobic exercise has been associated with academic performance in students in high-school and younger. Acute aerobic exercise is also thought to influence our emotions including anxiety (Ekkekakis &amp; Petruzzello, 1999). Despite such evidence, the amount and frequency of aerobic exercise drastically decreases in college students compared to high school students, while test anxiety tends to increase. This suggests the lack of exercise may be the cause of increased test anxiety in college students. However, while past research demonstrates positive effects of aerobic exercise on general anxiety, only one study has focused on test anxiety.\n\nIn this study we investigated the relationship between exercise habits and test anxiety using an online survey with 100 college students. For this we translated the Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale Questionnaire (Cassady &amp; Johnson, 2002) into Japanese and compared the results with their reported exercise habits.\n\nOur main interests were the two questions as below:\n\nDid the degrees of test anxiety vary depending on their exercise habits?\n\nDid the exercise timing - exercise performed before or after the tests - affect test anxiety?\n\nThis paper reports the results from the survey above.\n\nBio:\n\nKana Watanabe is a 5th year student at Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences. She studies the relationship between test anxiety and aerobic exercise.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nTeaching Younger Learners in Tokyo!\n\nShare Your Best Ideas and Questions for Discussion\n\nDate: Sunday, February 16th, 2020\n\nTime: 1-5 PM (followed by pizza nearby for those who want to keep on talking)\n\nLocation: Tokiwamatsu Gakuen\n\nCost: 1,000 (Free for JALT members) OR Join Tokyo JALT for 3,000 yen (JETs / ALTs 1,500)\n\nRSVP: http://bit.ly/TJALTrsvp Or apply to share your ideas:http://bit.ly/TJALTandYLevent\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/events/610579479760399/\n\nQueries: tokyojaltyl@gmail.com\n\nFlyer:http://bit.ly/TYLinTokyoFlyer\n\nEssential Tips on Building Confidence as a High School ALT Justine McCabe\n\nShe will cover essential tips for teaching English as a second language for high school students based on what she has learnt while working as an ALT.\n\nJustine is a high school teacher from Australia, but currently works in Tokyo as an ALT on the JET Programme at a private sports-focused senior high school.\n\nEncouraging Mindfulness and Emotional Literacy in Younger Learners Monika Sadkiewicz\n\nIn this presentation, Monika will share with us the methods she has used to help her young charges toward greater self-control and empathy for classmates.\n\nMonika is a multi-lingual preschool and kindergarten teacher skilled in using empathy and other emotional intelligence skills to effectively manage classroom behaviors.

Participants in this workshop will leave with a clear understanding of how to implement Task-Based Language Teaching for beginners. Input based TBLT for beginners requires scaffolding to make up for the deficit in both language and communication skills. From the research presented in this workshop, we are convinced that TBLT is possible with early beginners and is therefore applicable to elementary school beginners, college, and business English learners.\n\nA Grassroots Initiative Providing On-Line ALT Training - AND - Comparing Monolingual and Bilingual Approaches in Junior High Nathaniel Reed\n\nALTs' receive little to no training, although they have incredible potential to meet MEXT goals and make a noticeable dent in the quality of education students receive. With no other parties openly intending to support ALTs in supporting the growth of their students, and themselves, I outline a grassroots initiative aiming to do this. I share the ongoing needs analysis that gave rise to this teacher training initiative and how it is being put together.\n\nBy 2020 junior high school English teachers are to teach English in English \"according to the level of understanding of students\" (MEXT, 2015). This presentation reports on a yearlong study in two junior high schools; in one school, I spoke only English (whilst teaching and outside of class), and the other; both English and Japanese. Rich findings from student and co-teacher questionnaires, interviews and observations are put forward. Audience viewpoints are encouraged.\n\nNathaniel Reed is a British sixth-year ALT for the Niigata City Board of Education and father of two.He received an MA in Applied Linguistics in 2015 and since then worked to develop an open access teacher training site for ALTs (ALT Training Online). Dedicated to improving the quality of education in public schools he has published and presented on this site in addition to conducting classroom based research. In January 2020 he became Regional Professional Development Activities Chair (RPACC), and aims to bring more JALT groups together as well as open awareness of the potential JALT offers to more people.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nCANCELED Eli Hinkel: Effective Teaching Techniques for L2 Speaking and Conversations CANCELED\n\nDate: March 16th, 2020\n\nReturn to the top\n\nCANCELED Hanami (West Tokyo and Tokyo JALT)\n\nDate: March 22nd, 2020\n\nReturn to the top\n\nZoom Emergency Remote Teaching Webinar: Best Practices\n\nDate: Sunday, May 3, 2020\n\nTime: 02:00 PM Osaka, Sapporo, Tokyo\n\nSpeaker: José Domingo Cruz\n\nFlyer:https://bit.ly/TJALTwebinar05032020\n\nPlease register in advance for this webinar:\n\nhttps://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_VZN-y4hFSAOyIqpHCNIfKw\n\nSpecial thanks to the Niigata Chapter of JALT for their support in planning this event.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nState of the Chapter: Officer Elections and special guest presenter Fiona Mauchline\n\nDate: July 17th, 2020\n\nTime: 6:45-8 pm\n\nLocation: Zoom (link will be provided)\n\nFee: Free for all attendees\n\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/events/288456382589473/\n\nAt our annual State of the Chapter event, we celebrate all that our members have accomplished and conduct chapter business, such as elections.

In this webinar I will give participants a number of instantly useable online activities plus a toolkit for designing their own online tasks . We will discuss principles of task design and explore how the nature of task design for online contexts differs from that of classroom contexts. We will look at five categories of online tasks: Critical, involving an exchange of opinions, Personal, involving an exchange of personal information, Factual, involving sharing information, Fanciful, involving entering into an imaginary scenario and Creative, involving the creation of a ‘product’ and seven types of online interaction: Confetti, Pass the Parcel, Poker, Breakout, Postal Ballot, Writers’ Group and Creative Commons which teachers can use as templates for designing their own materials.\n\nReferences:\n\nClandfield,L. and Hadfield, J.

There has been much interest in using self-assessment as a means of involving students more in the learning process, which is thought to lead to more responsibility on the part of the learner. While self-assessment is often conflated with “student reflection,” in the research presented here, students’ assessments were given equal weight as their teachers and their ratings were reflected in their formal grades. Using research conducted in university writing courses in Japan, the presenter will illustrate how the procedure can be incorporated into the curriculum of both face-to-face and remote-learning contexts.\n\nPresenter Bio:\n\nDr. Chris Carl Hale is Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Global Communication and Language at Akita International University (AIU) where he teaches in the English Language Teaching Practices program.\n\nReturn to the top\n\nEd Tech 101 - Show and Tell\n\nDate: September 18th, 2020\n\nTime: 19:00 to 20:00\n\nLocation: Zoom\n\nFee: Free for all\n\nThe aim of Ed Tech 101 is to create a casual and fun environment for teachers to take away practical ideas that can be implemented in their own classrooms.
