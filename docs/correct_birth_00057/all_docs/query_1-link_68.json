        "text": "The overall legacy of the modern Olympic Games is tarnished by a slew of scandals ― allegations and documented evidence of corruption, with unethical quid-pro-quo deals and bribery repeatedly occurring in all corners of the globe.\n\nLegal proceedings and courtroom convictions featuring Olympic officials, past and present, have shifted the spotlight away from memories of glorious feats performed at sporting venues. And the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is now in the crosshairs of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.\n\nFormer Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee marketing division chief Haruyuki Takahashi and three Aoki Holdings Inc. officials, including Hironori Aoki, 83, the nationwide clothing firm’s former chairman and founder, were arrested on Wednesday, August 17 on suspicion of involvement in an alleged bribery scheme.\n\nAoki Holdings has been accused of making ¥51 million JPY ($380,000 USD) in payments between October 2017 and March 2022 to Takahashi, whose home was raided in July in the ongoing probe. Not one or two payments, prosecutors allege, but 50.\n\nAnd the allegations of corruption are tied to the payments, which were made to a bank account of Takahashi’s company, prosecutors claim.\n\nTakahashi, 78, previously worked as an executive for Japanese advertising giant Dentsu Inc., which reels in Olympic sponsors as part of its central role as a power broker in Japanese sports circles.\n\nTakahashi Denies Allegations\n\nTakahashi, who left his post as senior managing director at Dentsu in 2009, contends the received payments were made for legitimate consulting work, according to published reports. He has dismissed the prosecutors’ version of events, telling NHK he had \"never given special treatment to Aoki regarding the Olympics.”\n\nProsecutors are painting a different picture: That he was paid to influence Tokyo 2020 officials in order to land Aoki Holdings a lucrative contract to sell official Olympic merchandise and clothing. NHK summed up the alleged scheme in an online report’s headline: “Arrested exec. mentioned Aoki as Games sponsor before official announcement.”\n\nAoki Holdings became an official Tokyo 2020 sponsor in October 2018.\n\nIn essence, prosecutors suspect that Aoki Holdings’ then-chief executive who retired last month made Takahashi, in a position of influence on the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee since 2014, an offer he couldn’t refuse: cash. Or as NHK succinctly reported: “Prosecutors suspect the consulting fees actually constituted a bribe paid in return for favors.”\n\nInvestigators also recently searched the home of the Aoki Holdings founder and visited the now-defunct Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee’s offices.\n\nThe Associated Press summed up the crux of the prosecutors’ allegations this way: “Aoki, which produces ‘recruit suits’ that youngsters fresh out of school wear for job interviews and their first jobs, was a surprise pick to dress the Japanese Olympic team when other nations had top fashion brands designing their athletes’ outfits.”\n\nAlso arrested were ex-Aoki Holdings vice chairman Takahisa Aoki, the now-retired chairman’s younger brother, and former company senior managing director Katsuhisa Ueda.\n\nGrabbing the attention of the prosecutors’ office is the terms of the financial transaction that linked Aoki Holdings to Tokyo 2020 organizers. Specifically, the amount of the deal (¥500 million JYP, or $3.7 million USD).\n\nSources claim that figure is less than 50% of the cost that other companies have had to pay for similar deals, Kyodo News reported.\n\nAoki Holdings designed the official uniforms for Japan's Olympic and Paralympic teams.\n\nRELATED:\n\nEDITORIAL | Learn From Raid on Tokyo 2020 Official, Clean Up the Olympic Games Now\n\nBaseball\n\nBlue Jays’ Kikuchi Assigned to Bullpen\n\nToronto Blue Jays southpaw Yusei Kikuchi made 90 MLB starts, including 20 for his current club this season, before he was ordered to work as a relief pitcher.\n\nKikuchi fell to 4-7 on Monday, August 15 after allowing six runs (three earned) and four hits in 3⅓ innings in a 7-3 home loss against the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nWhat’s more, the Blue Jays fell to 6-14 in games that Kikuchi started this season.\n\nKikuchi, who played for the Seattle Mariners from 2019-21, made his first MLB relief appearance on Thursday. He worked a scoreless eighth inning in Toronto’s 9-2 rout of the New York Yankees, yielding one hit in Gotham. He walked one and struck out a pair of batters.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Kikuchi, 31, said he understood that the team felt it needed to give him a new role.\n\n“[Manager John] Schneider had mentioned that this move was the best,” Kikuchi was quoted as saying by the Toronto Star, “not just for the team but for myself. I had mentioned the option of maybe going down to Triple-A and staying on a five-day rotation, but Schneider [said that], as of now, the best move for the team and the organization was for me to go into the bullpen and take on a new role.”\n\nKikuchi, who signed a three-year contract with the Blue Jays in the offseason, is 19-31 with a 5.01 ERA in his MLB career. As an NPB pitcher, he was 73-46 with a 2.77 ERA in eight seasons, all with the Saitama Seibu Lions.\n\nOhtani Has First Four-Hit Game Since June 2019\n\nShohei Ohtani ignited the Los Angeles Angels offense on Wednesday, August 17, but his 4-for-5 effort was not enough in the hosts’ 11-7 loss to the Seattle Mariners.\n\nOhtani stroked singles in the first and fifth innings, ripped a triple in the seventh and hammered a two-run home run to center off Seattle’s Matthew Festa in the ninth.\n\nIt was Ohtani’s first four-hit game since June 13, 2019.\n\nRELATED:\n\n#13 Sports Talk ― Jeff Fletcher Shares Insights About His New Book On Shohei Ohtani\n\nSurfing\n\nOlympic Silver Medalist Igarashi Qualifies for WSL Finals\n\nKanoa Igarashi has achieved his goal of qualifying for the World Surf League’s Championship Tour finals for the first time.\n\nThe men’s surfing silver medalist at the Tokyo Olympics last year won his round of 16 duel with Jadson Andre, amassing 15.70 points to the Brazilian’s 13.40 in the 10th and final event of the WSL season on Thursday, August 18 in Teahupo’o, Tahiti.\n\nEntering the Outerknown Tahiti Pro, Igarashi was sixth in the Championship Tour standings. His pressure-filled win over Andre and American challenger Griffin Colapinto’s loss to Yago Dora of Brazil in an earlier heat (14.94-14.63) secured the Japan-born, California-raised surfer’s trip to the finals, September 9-17 in San Clemente, California.\n\n“I really don’t know what to say ― this is super emotional to me ― I’m lost for words right now,” Igarashi said. “First of all I want to thank Teahupo’o. I’ve been coming here for so long and spending time with some of the locals and preparing myself for a moment like this, and when that wave came I knew if it was meant to be it was going to happen right there.\n\n“Now, I'm into the top five and heading home.”\n\nBased on accrued points in the 10 Championship Tour events, here are the top five spots for the upcoming finals:\n\n1. Filipe Toledo\n\n2. Jack Robinson\n\n3. Ethan Ewing\n\n4. Italo Ferreira\n\n5.
