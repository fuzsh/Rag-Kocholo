        "text": "This week’s Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers will see a number of star players in action for their countries, including world No. 1 Iga Swiatek and four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.\n\nThe 16 nations in qualifying action will be looking to book their place at the Billie Jean King Cup finals in November.\n\nThe winners of the ties will advance to the finals, while the losers will compete in the play-offs later this year to try to earn a place in the 2025 qualifiers.\n\nWho’s playing and which players are missing out? Read on for everything you need to know about the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers…\n\nWho’s playing in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers?\n\nThe eight qualifying ties are:\n\nAustralia v Mexico\n\nSwitzerland v Poland\n\nFrance v Great Britain\n\nUSA v Belgium\n\nJapan v Kazakhstan\n\nBrazil v Germany\n\nSlovakia v Slovenia\n\nUkraine v Romania\n\nIga Swiatek opted not to play for Poland at the finals two years ago because of the “unsafe” schedule that would have seen her quickly travelling from Texas to Scotland to compete.\n\nThe world No. 1 also didn’t play last year, but is back in the squad for the first time since playing in the 2022 qualifiers.\n\nSwiatek has won nine of 12 Billie Jean King Cup matches and will give Poland’s chances of making the finals a significant boost.\n\nNaomi Osaka is also back for Japan, making her first appearance in four years in the tie in Tokyo against Kazakhstan.\n\nOsaka has enjoyed an encouraging start to the season following her return to the tour after giving birth.\n\n\"She said that she wants to play, so I'm really happy,\" said Japan captain Ai Sugiyama. \"We're aiming for the very top. The players have the potential.\"\n\nTo be eligible for the Games, players need to have represented their country twice in the Billie Jean King Cup during the four-year Olympic cycle, with one of those appearances in 2023 or 2024.\n\nOsaka does not meet the criteria but there are exemptions for players who have had time away from tennis, plus two spots for former Grand Slam winners.\n\nAnother new mum, Angelique Kerber, will be in action for Germany as they face Brazil, who will be led by Beatriz Haddad Maia.\n\nSimona Halep was included in Romania’s team to face Ukraine after recently returning to action from a doping ban, but pulled out due to injury.\n\nElina Svitolina will compete in the tie for Ukraine, making her first appearance since 2012.\n\nJessica Pegula will lead the United States team against Belgium in the absence of Coco Gauff.\n\nIn-form Emma Navarro is set to make her debut, with Madison Keys, Taylor Townsend and Caroline Dolehide also in the team.\n\nWho’s playing for Great Britain?\n\n“Brutal” is how Katie Boulter has described Great Britain’s clash against France.\n\nBritish No. 1 Boulter will lead the team and will be joined by Emma Raducanu, Harriet Dart, Heather Watson and debutant Francesca Jones in Le Portel.\n\nRaducanu will be playing for the first time since making her debut against the Czech Republic in 2022.\n\n“I’m very pleased. We’ve missed her. We love having her back,” said Boulter about Raducanu.\n\n“Obviously the No. 1 thing is that she’s healthy. I’ve always said it for myself and it’s my biggest wish for her as well is that she can stay as healthy as possible. We’re going to be welcoming her with open arms for sure.”\n\nFrance are led by world No. 23 Caroline Garcia.\n\nWhen are the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers?\n\nThe Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers will take place on April 12-13.\n\nThe finals will be held in Seville, Spain later this year.\n\nWhat's the format for the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers?\n\nThe four singles matches will be followed by the deciding doubles match if needed. The matches are best-of-three sets.\n\n- - -\n\nStream the 2024 French Open live and on-demand on discovery+\n\nWTA Nottingham\n\n'What a match' - Boulter beats Raducanu in Nottingham Open semis to book Pliskova final\n\n16/06/2024 at 16:05"
