        "text": "The key visual for “Kanagawa Kenmin Hall 50th Anniversary Opera Series Vol. 2: “Lohengrin” by Salvatore Sciarrino” to be held at Kanagawa Kenmin Hall on October 5 (Sat.) and 6 (Sun.) has been revealed, along with details on the full program and ticket information.\n\nThis is the second in a series of innovative performing arts productions based on various themes as part of the Kanagawa Kenmin Hall’s commemorative events for its 50th anniversary in 2025. The first production of the series, held in 2022, featured a new production of the contemporary opera “Einstein On The Beach” by Robert Wilson, a genius of performing arts, and Philip Glass, a master of minimal music, with translation by Yukiko Konosu, direction and choreography by Shintaro Hirahara, and performances by Yasuko Matsuyuki and Yoji Tanaka.\n\nThe upcoming performance of “Lohengrin” is a work by the Sicilian composer Salvatore Sciarrino, which premiered in September 1984 in Catanzaro, Italy (the first version premiered in Milan in 1983). Based on the legend of Lohengrin as told by the Brothers Grimm in their “German Legends,” Wagner created his work in 1850, followed by French poet Jules Laforgue’s parody in the 1880s. Subsequently, inspired by Laforgue’s “Lohengrin,” Sciarrino composed his version.\n\nSharino’s “Lohengrin” will be performed for the first time in Japan, with Ai Hashimoto playing the lead role of Elsa, Yoichi Sugiyama conducting, Nao Yoshibiraki and Aya Yamazaki directing, and Seika Osaki rhetorically directing. The piece will be performed with violinist Tatsuki Narita as concertmaster.\n\nAlso to be performed for the first time in Japan is “Paesaggi con macerie,” also composed by Sharino. The work was created for a music festival in Vilnius, Lithuania, in the midst of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and will be premiered in 2022. Tickets are available at the door.\n\nTickets will go on pre-sale for KAme (Kanagawa Members) on Saturday, June 8, and will go on general sale on Sunday, July 7."
