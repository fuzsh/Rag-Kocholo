For other uses, see Yokohama (disambiguation).\n\nDesignated city in Kantō, JapanTemplate:SHORTDESC:Designated city in Kantō, Japan\n\nYokohamaFile:Yokohama (Chinese characters).svg\n\n\"Yokohama\" in new-style (shinjitai) kanji\n\nJapanese nameHiraganaよこはまKatakanaヨコハマKyūjitai橫濱Shinjitai横浜\n\nTranscriptionsRomanizationYokohama\n\nYokohama (Japanese: 横浜, pronounced [jokohama] (Audio file \"ja-Yokohama.ogg \" not found)) is the second-largest city in Japan by population,[2] and the most populous municipality of Japan. It is the capital city of Kanagawa Prefecture. It lies on Tokyo Bay, south of Tokyo, in the Kantō region of the main island of Honshu. It is a major commercial hub of the Greater Tokyo Area.\n\nYokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nYokohama (横浜) literally means \"horizontal beach\".[3] The current area surrounded by Maita Park, the Ōoka River and the Nakamura River had been a gulf divided by a sandbar from the open sea. This sandbar was the original Yokohama fishing village. Since the sandbar protruded perpendicularly from the land, or horizontally when viewed from the sea, it was called a \"horizontal beach\".[4]\n\nHistory[]\n\nSee also: Timeline of Yokohama\n\nOpening of the Treaty Port (1859–1868)[]\n\nYokohama was a small fishing village up to the end of the feudal Edo period, when Japan held a policy of national seclusion, having little contact with foreigners.[5] A major turning point in Japanese history happened in 1853–54, when Commodore Matthew Perry arrived just south of Yokohama with a fleet of American warships, demanding that Japan open several ports for commerce, and the Tokugawa shogunate agreed by signing the Treaty of Peace and Amity.[6]\n\nIt was initially agreed that one of the ports to be opened to foreign ships would be the bustling town of Kanagawa-juku (in what is now Kanagawa Ward) on the Tōkaidō, a strategic highway that linked Edo to Kyoto and Osaka. However, the Tokugawa shogunate decided that Kanagawa-juku was too close to the Tōkaidō for comfort, and port facilities were instead built across the inlet in the sleepy fishing village of Yokohama. The Port of Yokohama was officially opened on June 2, 1859.[7]\n\nYokohama quickly became the base of foreign trade in Japan. Foreigners initially occupied the low-lying district of the city called Kannai, residential districts later expanding as the settlement grew to incorporate much of the elevated Yamate district overlooking the city, commonly referred to by English speaking residents as The Bluff.\n\nKannai, the foreign trade and commercial district (literally, inside the barrier), was surrounded by a moat, foreign residents enjoying extraterritorial status both within and outside the compound. Interactions with the local population, particularly young samurai, outside the settlement inevitably caused problems; the Namamugi Incident, one of the events that preceded the downfall of the shogunate, took place in what is now Tsurumi Ward in 1862, and prompted the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.\n\nTo protect British commercial and diplomatic interests in Yokohama a military garrison was established in 1862. With the growth in trade increasing numbers of Chinese also came to settle in the city.[8] Yokohama was the scene of many notable firsts for Japan including the growing acceptance of western fashion, photography by pioneers such as Felice Beato, Japan's first English language newspaper, the Japan Herald published in 1861 and in 1865 the first ice cream and beer to be produced in Japan.[9] Recreational sports introduced to Japan by foreign residents in Yokohama included European style horse racing in 1862, cricket in 1863[10] and rugby union in 1866. A great fire destroyed much of the foreign settlement on November 26, 1866 and smallpox was a recurrent public health hazard, but the city continued to grow rapidly – attracting foreigners and Japanese alike.\n\nMeiji and Taisho Periods (1868–1923)[]\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the port was developed for trading silk, the main trading partner being Great Britain. Western influence and technological transfer contributed to the establishment of Japan's first daily newspaper (1870), first gas-powered street lamps (1872) and Japan's first railway constructed in the same year to connect Yokohama to Shinagawa and Shinbashi in Tokyo. In 1872 Jules Verne portrayed Yokohama, which he had never visited, in an episode of his widely read novel Around the World in Eighty Days, capturing the atmosphere of the fast-developing, internationally oriented Japanese city.\n\nIn 1887, a British merchant, Samuel Cocking, built the city's first power plant. At first for his own use, this coal-burning plant became the basis for the Yokohama Cooperative Electric Light Company. The city was officially incorporated on April 1, 1889.[11] By the time the extraterritoriality of foreigner areas was abolished in 1899, Yokohama was the most international city in Japan, with foreigner areas stretching from Kannai to the Bluff area and the large Yokohama Chinatown.\n\nThe early 20th century was marked by rapid growth of industry. Entrepreneurs built factories along reclaimed land to the north of the city toward Kawasaki, which eventually grew to be the Keihin Industrial Area. The growth of Japanese industry brought affluence, and many wealthy trading families constructed sprawling residences there, while the rapid influx of population from Japan and Korea also led to the formation of Kojiki-Yato, then the largest slum in Japan.\n\nGreat Kanto earthquake and the Second World War (1923–1945)[]\n\nMuch of Yokohama was destroyed on September 1, 1923 by the Great Kantō earthquake. The Yokohama police reported casualties at 30,771 dead and 47,908 injured, out of a pre-earthquake population of 434,170.[12] Fuelled by rumours of rebellion and sabotage, vigilante mobs thereupon murdered many Koreans in the Kojiki-yato slum.[13] Many people believed that Koreans used black magic to cause the earthquake. Martial law was in place until November 19. Rubble from the quake was used to reclaim land for parks, the most famous being the Yamashita Park on the waterfront which opened in 1930.\n\nYokohama was rebuilt, only to be destroyed again by U.S. air raids during World War II. An estimated seven or eight thousand people were killed in a single morning on May 29, 1945 in what is now known as the Great Yokohama Air Raid, when B-29s firebombed the city and in just one hour and nine minutes reduced 42% of it to rubble.[11]\n\nPost-World War II growth[]\n\nDuring the American occupation, Yokohama was a major transshipment base for American supplies and personnel, especially during the Korean War. After the occupation, most local U.S. naval activity moved from Yokohama to an American base in nearby Yokosuka.\n\nThe city was designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956.[citation needed]\n\nThe city's tram and trolleybus system was abolished in 1972, the same year as the opening of the first line of Yokohama Municipal Subway.\n\nConstruction of Minato Mirai 21 (\"Port Future 21\"), a major urban development project on reclaimed land, started in 1983. Minato Mirai 21 hosted the Yokohama Exotic Showcase in 1989, which saw the first public operation of maglev trains in Japan and the opening of Cosmo Clock 21, then the tallest Ferris wheel in the world. The 860m-long Yokohama Bay Bridge opened in the same year.\n\nIn 1993, Minato Mirai saw the opening of the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the second tallest building in Japan.\n\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup final was held in June at the International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nIn 2009, the city marked the 150th anniversary of the opening of the port and the 120th anniversary of the commencement of the City Administration. An early part in the commemoration project incorporated the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) which was held in Yokohama in May 2008.\n\nIn November 2010, Yokohama hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.\n\nGeography[]\n\nSurrounding municipalities[]\n\nThese municipalities surround Yokohama.\n\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nKawasaki\n\nYokosuka\n\nZushi\n\nKamakura\n\nFujisawa\n\nYamato\n\nTokyo\n\nMachida\n\nClimate[]\n\nYokohama features a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa) with hot and humid summers and chilly winters.[14] Weatherwise, Yokohama has a pattern of rain, clouds and sun, although in winter, it is surprisingly sunny, more so than Southern Spain. Winter temperatures rarely drop below freezing, while summer can seem quite warm because of the effects of humidity.[15] The coldest temperature was on 24 January 1927 when −8.2 °C (17.2 °F) was reached, whilst the hottest day was 11 August 2013 at 37.4 °C (99.3 °F). The highest monthly rainfall was in October 2004 with 761.5 millimetres (30.0 in), closely followed by July 1941 with 753.4 millimetres (29.66 in), whilst December and January have recorded no measurable precipitation three times each.\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical population[]\n\nPopulation Year of\n\ncensus Population Rank among cities in Japan 1920 422,942 6th, behind Kobe, Kyoto,\n\nNagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo 1925 405,888 6th 1930 620,306 6th 1935 704,290 6th 1940 968,091 5th, surpassing Kobe 1945 814,379 4th, the city government of Tokyo\n\nhaving been disbanded in 1943 1950 951,189 4th 1955 1,143,687 4th 1960 1,375,710 3rd, surpassing Kyoto 1965 1,788,915 3rd 1970 2,238,264 2nd, surpassing Nagoya 1975 2,621,771 2nd 1980 2,773,674 1st, surpassing Osaka[18] 1985 2,992,926 1st 1990 3,220,331 1st 1995 3,307,136 1st 2000 3,426,651 1st 2005 3,579,133 1st 2010 3,670,669 1st 2015 3,710,824 1st\n\nYokohama's foreign population of 92,139 includes Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos, and Vietnamese.[19]\n\nWards[]\n\nYokohama has 18 wards (ku):\n\nWards of Yokohama Place Name Map of Yokohama Rōmaji Kanji Population Land area in km2 Pop. density\n\nper km2\n\n1 Aoba-ku 青葉区 302,643 35.14 8,610 2 Asahi-ku 旭区 249,045 32.77 7,600 3\n\nHodogaya-ku 保土ヶ谷区 205,887 21.81 9,400 4 Isogo-ku 磯子区 163,406 19.17 8,520 5 Izumi-ku 泉区 155,674 23.51 6,620 6 Kanagawa-ku 神奈川区 230,401 23.88 9,650 7 Kanazawa-ku 金沢区 209,565 31.01 6,760 8 Kōhoku-ku 港北区 332,488 31.40 10,588 9 Kōnan-ku 港南区 221,536 19.87 11,500 10 Midori-ku 緑区 176,038 25.42 6,900 11 Minami-ku 南区 197,019 12.67 15,500 12 Naka-ku - (administrative center) 中区 146,563 20.86 7,030 13 Nishi-ku 西区 93,210 7.04 13,210 14 Sakae-ku 栄区 124,845 18.55 6,750 15 Seya-ku 瀬谷区 126,839 17.11 7,390 16 Totsuka-ku 戸塚区 274,783 35.70 7,697 17 Tsurumi-ku 鶴見区 270,433 33.23 8,140 18 Tsuzuki-ku 都筑区 211,455 27.93 7,535\n\nGovernment and politics[]\n\nThe Yokohama Municipal Assembly consists of 92 members elected from a total of 18 Wards.
