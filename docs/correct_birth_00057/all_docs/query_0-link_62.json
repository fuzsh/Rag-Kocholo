However, the epidemiology of S. scabiei infestation has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the epidemiology of S. scabiei infestation in raccoon dogs and its influence on the population of masked palm civets in Yokohama, Japan. We examined records of raccoon dog rescue between 1981 and 2010 and classified the dogs into the following 4 categories on the basis of the reason for rescue: dogs with S. scabiei infestation, scabies-infested dogs involved in car accidents, uninfested dogs involved in car accidents, and other reasons for rescue. We found that the number of dogs rescued due to car accidents and other reasons increased from 1989 onwards, and an S. scabiei outbreak was recorded since 1993. The infestation spread from the southern to the northern regions of Yokohama. The total number of raccoon dogs rescued annually peaked in 1995 and declined thereafter. The number of masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) rescued gradually increased with a decline in the number of raccoon dogs rescued. In the present study, we revealed the epidemiology of S. scabiei infestation in the raccoon dog. The outbreak might be induced by the increased population density, and the infestation spread immediately from the southern to the northern regions of Yokohama since 1993. Further, the population of masked palm civets may have increased due to the decrease in the population of the raccoon dog. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

By the age of 30 years, 14.3% of women who had ever had a partner had experienced violence from that partner, and 3.3% had suffered injuries related to such violence. By the time women had reached the age of 49 years, these percentages were 19% and 4%, respectively. In addition to the need for increased prevention efforts, our findings indicate the need for an expanded legal definition of intimate partner violence in Japan given that the current definition excludes premarital violence.\n\nExperiences of Intimate Partner Violence and Related Injuries Among Women in Yokohama, Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYoshihama, Mieko; Horrocks, Julie; Kamano, Saori\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe estimated rates of intimate partner violence and related injuries in a sample of 1371 women aged 18 to 49 years in Yokohama, Japan.

The indexes of new high school geography as compulsory subject will be 1. Using of maps and GIS, 2. Understanding of the world and International collaboration: Life and culture, issues of world, 3. Disaster prevention and ESD: natural environment and disaster, and construction of ideal society. The instruction of the GIS will be one of the issues for social studies teachers in the new curriculum. The aim of this study is to make the utilize map and GIS education content through trial class in junior high school. Trial class was done on Tsurugamine junior high school in Yokohama city with university and Yokohama city school board collaboration. In the trial class, the teacher indicated the old and new topographical maps to students and asked them to consider the characteristics of the area and the land use change. Transparent sheets overlaying is useful this activity. Transparent usage indicated the GIS function of overlay. It is good activity for students to understand the function of GIS. After the considering land use changes, they considered the future of their town. The several unused lands are spread in this area. Students present their opinions how to develop them. The important thing to carry out map and GIS class through neighborhood area is preparation of adequate maps. For this preparation, collaboration with university geography stuffs or undergraduate students are effective.\n\nMaternal effects and larval survival of marbled sole Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHigashitani, Tomomi; Takatsu, Tetsuya; Nakaya, Mitsuhiro; Joh, Mikimasa; Takahashi, Toyomi\n\n2007-07-01\n\nMaternal effects of animals are the phenotypic influences of age, size, and condition of spawners on the survival and phenotypic traits of offspring. To clarify the maternal effects for marbled sole Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae, we investigated the effects of body size, nutrient condition, and growth history of adult females on egg size, larval size, and starvation tolerance, growth, and feeding ability of offspring. The fecundity of adult females was strongly dependent on body size. Path analysis revealed that the mother's total length positively affected mean egg diameter, meaning that large females spawned large eggs. In contrast, the relative growth rate of adult females negatively affected egg diameter. Egg diameters positively affected both notochord length and yolk sac volume of the larvae at hatching. Under starvation conditions, notochord length at hatching strongly and positively affected days of survival at 14 Â°C but not at 9 Â°C. Under adequate food conditions (1000 rotifers L - 1 ), the notochord length of larvae 5 days after hatching positively affected feeding rate, implying that large larvae have high feeding ability. In addition, the mean growth rate of larvae between 0 and 15 days increased with increasing egg diameter under homogenous food conditions, suggesting that larvae hatched from large eggs might have a growth advantage for at least to 15 days after hatching. In marbled sole, these relationships (i.e., mother's body size-egg size-larval size-larval resistance to starvation-larval feeding ability) may help explain recruitment variability.\n\nCharacterization of proteins in the muscle of limanda yokohamae from the masan bay, Korea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Soo Woon; Kim, Sam Moon; Lee, Dong Kun; Moon, Hyo Bang; Choi, Hee Gu; Kang, Chang Keun; Choe, Eun Sang\n\n2007-06-01\n\nIncreasing industrial development in the Masan Bay area of Korea over the past decades increased the risk for the survival of marine organisms in the bay area by the deterioration of the water quality. Since living organisms have the ability to adapt contamination-associated stimuli by the alteration of gene expression, changes in proteins can be used as an important criterion for assessing the levels of environmental conditions. In this study, therefore, alterations of the expression of proteins in the muscle of Limanda yokohamae from Dukdong and Dotsum in the bay area were surveyed and characterized as compared with Haegumgang, which served as a control site. The results demonstrated that the twenty spots detected from Dukdong and Dotsum were similar to each other. Fifteen proteins were found to be predicted or undefined proteins, while five proteins were identified as heavy polypeptide 11 of myosin, apolipoprotein A-I, fibroblast growth factor 17b precursor, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 b and bonnie and clyde. These data suggest that local fish in the bay area have dysfunction in muscle physiology including contraction, lipid metabolism, proliferation and differentiation and nervous system.\n\nThe Role of Emotional Abuse in Intimate Partner Violence and Health Among Women in Yokohama, Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHorrocks, Julie; Kamano, Saori\n\n2009-01-01\n\nObjectives. As part of the World Health Organization's cross-national research effort, we investigated the relationship between various health indicators and the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV), which included emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, among women in Yokohama, Japan. Methods. We used multivariate logistic and negative binomial regression to examine the relationship between health status and IPV in a stratified cluster sample of 1371 women aged 18 to 49 years. Results. In 9 of 11 health indicators examined, the odds of experiencing health-related problems were significantly higher (P < .05) among those that reported emotional abuse plus physical or sexual violence than among those that reported no IPV, after we controlled for sociodemographic factors, childhood sexual abuse, and adulthood sexual violence perpetrated by someone other than an intimate partner. For most health indicators, there were no significant differences between those that reported emotional abuse only and those that reported emotional abuse plus physical or sexual violence. Conclusions. The similarity of outcomes among those that reported emotional abuse only and those that reported emotional abuse plus physical or sexual violence suggests the need for increased training of health care providers about the effects of emotional abuse.

As part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) cross-national research effort, this study examined the relationship between the experience of IPV and use of alcohol and tobacco among a probability sample of women aged 18-49 in Yokohama, Japan. Using retrospective data for 2000-2001, we employed methods of survival analysis that allowed an examination of the probability of initiating smoking and drinking subsequent to the experience of IPV. Experiencing IPV was associated with current smoking as well as initiation of smoking and current patterns of drinking. Women who had experienced IPV were more likely to be smoking at the time of the interview and tended to initiate smoking at earlier ages compared to those who had not experienced IPV. At any time point, the risk of starting to smoke was more than twice as high for women who had previously experienced IPV than for women who had not. In addition, women who had experienced IPV were more likely to drink heavily. The present study's findings clearly point to the need to enhance coordination between IPV prevention and substance abuse programs in order to improve the safety and wellbeing of women who have experienced IPV.

Spatial distribution of radon-222 (222Rn) concentration in water showed more submarine groundwater seepage in the offshore area. The lower salinities at offshore sampling stations corresponded with the highest 222Rn concentrations. Juvenile marbled sole were collected from March through June with seasonal peak in April in 2013 and 2014. Mean abundance of juvenile marbled sole was highest at the second most offshore station where high submarine groundwater seepage was indicated. Major prey items in the stomachs of the marbled sole at the post-settlement stage (10-40 mm) were small crustaceans such as cumaceans and gammarids, which were partially replaced with polychaetes in larger juveniles (40-50 mm). Abundance of these major prey items was also higher at offshore stations. A negative correlation between gammarid abundance and salinity indicated a higher concentration of gammarids around the area of high submarine groundwater seepage, a pattern not observed for the other major prey organisms. Stable isotope analysis showed greater dependence of post-settlement stage marbled sole on the small crustaceans with low Î´13C indicating that nutrients of terrestrial origin contribute to production of the juvenile marbled sole on the tidal flat.\n\nThe impact of western science and technology on 'ukiyo-e' prints and book illustrations in late eighteenth and nineteenth century Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nLow, Morris\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the Edo period (c. 1600-1868), exposure to Western art, science and technology encouraged Japanese 'ukiyo-e' (pictures of the floating world) artists to experiment with Western perspective in woodblock prints and book illustrations. We can see its early influence in the work of Utagawa Hiroshige (1787-1858), as well as Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797-1861). Unlike Hiroshige, Kuniyoshi lived to see the opening of the port of Yokohama to trade with the West in 1859. A whole genre of Yokohama prints emerged and one of the key artists was Utagawa Sadahide (1807-1873). In his illustrated books entitled 'Yokohama kaikÅ kenbunshi' (A Record of Things Seen and Heard in the Open Port of Yokohama) (1862), Sadahide plays with perspective in an effort to represent the dynamic changes that Japan was undergoing in its encounter with the West at the time. In the work of later artists such as Hiroshige III (1843-1894), Kobayashi Kiyochika (1847-1915) and Inoue Yasuji (1864-1889), we can see growing efforts to depict light, shadow and depth, and a continuing fascination with the steam locomotive and the changes occurring in the Tokyo-Yokohama region as Japan entered the Meiji period (1868-1912).\n\nUpdate of inactivated equine influenza vaccine strain in Japan\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGAMOH, Koichiro; NAKAMURA, Shigeyuki\n\n2017-01-01\n\nJapan established a vaccine selection system, in which a committee evaluates veterinary influenza vaccines to determine if the vaccine should be updated. In 2013, it was concluded that the present equine influenza vaccine strains did not have to be updated, but clade 2 (Fc2) viruses of the Florida sublineage should be included. We collected three Fc2 viruses as candidates and conducted comparative tests. Results indicated that A/equine/Carlow/2011 (H3N8) is not suitable, because of its unstable antigenic characteristics. A comparison between A/equine/Richmond/1/2007 (H3N8) (Richmond/07) and A/equine/Yokohama/aq13/2010 (H3N8) (Yokohama/10) in eggs showed that they shared equal growth properties. Immunogenicity test in mice showed that Yokohama/10 induced higher HI antibody titers than Richmond/07. Therefore, we concluded that Yokohama/10 was the most suitable strain.

This study examined the associations between meteorological conditions and objectively measured step counts using year-round data collected from a large cohort ( N Â =Â 24,625) in Yokohama, Japan from April 2015 to March 2016. Two-piece linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations between the monthly median daily step count and three meteorological indices (mean values of temperature, temperature-humidity index (THI), and net effective temperature (NET)). The number of steps per day peaked at temperatures between 19.4 and 20.7Â Â°C. At lower temperatures, the increase in steps per day was between 46.4 and 52.5 steps per 1Â Â°C increase. At temperatures higher than those at which step counts peaked, the decrease in steps per day was between 98.0 and 187.9 per 1Â Â°C increase. Furthermore, these effects were more obvious in elderly than non-elderly persons in both sexes. A similar tendency was seen when using THI and NET instead of temperature. Among the three meteorological indices, the highest R 2 value with step counts was observed with THI in all four groups. Both high and low meteorological indices discourage people from walking and higher values of the indices adversely affect step count more than lower values, particularly among the elderly. Among the three indices assessed, THI best explains the seasonal fluctuations in step counts.\n\nWelcome Address\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKiku, H.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, It is an honor for me to present my welcome address in the 3rd International Workshop on \"State of the Art in Nuclear Cluster Physics\"(SOTANCP3), as the president of Kanto Gakuin University. Particularly to those from abroad more than 17 countries, I am very grateful for your participation after long long trips from your home to Yokohama. On the behalf of the Kanto Gakuin University, we certainly welcome your visit to our university and stay in Yokohama. First I would like to introduce Kanto Gakuin University briefly. Kanto Gakuin University, which is called KGU, traces its roots back to the Yokohama Baptist Seminary founded in 1884 in Yamate, Yokohama. The seminary's founder was Albert Arnold Bennett, alumnus of Brown University, who came to Japan from the United States to establish a theological seminary for cultivating and training Japanese missionaries. Now KGU is a major member of the Kanto Gakuin School Corporation, which is composed of two kindergartens, two primary schools, two junior high schools, two senior high schools as well as KGU. In this university, we have eight faculties with graduate school including Humanities, Economics, Law, Sciences and Engineering, Architecture and Environmental Design, Human and Environmental Studies, Nursing, and Law School. Over eleven thousands students are currently learning in our university. By the way, my major is the geotechnical engineering, and I belong to the faculty of Sciences and Engineering in my university. Prof. T. Yamada, here, is my colleague in the same faculty. I know that the nuclear physics is one of the most active academic fields in the world. In fact, about half of the participants, namely, more than 50 scientists, come from abroad in this conference. Moreover, I know that the nuclear physics is related to not only the other fundamental physics such as the elementary particle physics and astrophysics but also chemistry, medical sciences, medical cares, and radiation metrology\n\nKorean Affairs Report No. 321\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1983-11-10\n\nmedia recently reported articles on the occasion of the 38th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea.

Unlike already commercialized laparoscopic surgical simulators, our surgical simulator is capable of using patient-specific models for preoperative training and improvement of laparoscopic surgical skills. We have been evaluating the simulator clinically with the aim of using it in renal surgery training at Yokohama City University Hospital. The simulator can be applied to other types of laparoscopic surgery, such as gynecological, thoracic, and gastrointestinal. Here, we report on the technical aspects of the simulator.\n\n82 FR 35991 - Certain Flash Memory Devices and Components Thereof; Notice of Commission Determination Not To...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2017-08-02\n\n... following respondents: SanDisk LLC of Milpitas, California; Western Digital Corporation of Irvine, California; Western Digital Technologies, Inc. of Milpitas, California; SanDisk Limited of Yokohama, Japan...\n\n75 FR 54914 - Notice Pursuant to the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993-LiMo Foundation\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-09-09\n\n... damages under specified circumstances.

These six species consumed a variety of benthic invertebrates and teleosts, but their preferences for different food resources varied. Although all species consumed crustaceans, the contributions of different crustacean taxa differed among the species' diets. Caridean shrimps and crabs were a significant part of the Hexagrammos agrammus and H. otakii diets, respectively, while amphipods were consumed mainly by Sebastes inermis. Caridean shrimps and prawns were abundant within the Lateolabrax japonicas diet, but were not common prey resources for Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae or S. schlegelii. Polychaetes and ophiurids were ingested by P. yokohamae, and the former prey taxon also made moderate contributions to the diets of H. agrammus and L. japonicus. With the exception of P. yokohamae, the diets of all species included teleosts. Teleosts contributed the largest proportion of the S. schlegelii diet, followed by the S. inermis and L. japonicas diets; however, H. agrammus and H. otakii rarely consumed teleosts. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) ordination plots and permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed the variation in dietary composition among species and the contributions of each prey taxon. These interspecific differences in diet increase the range of food resources available to these fishes, thereby reducing competition for resources within the fish community in this region.\n\nAntigenic and genetic analysis of H3N8 influenza viruses isolated from horses in Japan and Mongolia, and imported from Canada and Belgium during 2007-2010.\n\nPubMed\n\nMotoshima, Masayuki; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Asakura, Shingo; Kuribayashi, Saya; Sengee, Sugar; Batchuluun, Damdinjav; Ito, Mika; Maeda, Yukiko; Eto, Mariko; Sakoda, Yoshihiro; Sodnomdarjaa, Ruuragchaa; Kida, Hiroshi\n\n2011-08-01\n\nA/equine/Kanazawa/1/2007 (H3N8), A/equine/Hokkaido/I828/2008 (H3N8) and A/equine/Mongolia/1/2008 (H3N8) were isolated from infected horses. A/equine/Yokohama/aq19/2009 (H3N8) and A/equine/Yokohama/aq13/2010 (H3N8) were isolated from horses imported from Canada and Belgium examined at the Animal Quarantine Service in Yokohama, Japan. In the present study, these five isolates were genetically and antigenically analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes showed that three isolates from horses in Japan and imported from Canada belonged to the same branch, clade 1 of the Florida sublineage, while the isolates from horses in Mongolia and imported from Belgium belonged to another branch, clade 2 of the Florida sublineage. Reactivity patterns of a panel of monoclonal antibodies to the HA of A/equine/Kanazawa/1/2007 (H3N8) with the five isolates indicate that the HAs of these viruses were antigenically similar to each other and to the reference strains A/equine/La Plata/1/1993 (H3N8) and A/equine/Avesta/1/1993 (H3N8). The present findings indicate that extensive antigenic variation has not accumulated among H3N8 influenza viruses in horses.\n\nPATRAM '92: 10th international symposium on the packaging and transportation of radioactive materials [Papers presented by Sandia National Laboratories\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNone\n\nThis document provides the papers presented by Sandia Laboratories at PATRAM '92, the tenth International symposium on the Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Materials held September 13--18, 1992 in Yokohama City, Japan.

Upon examining the import status in the period from the late part of the Taisho era to the early part of Showa era (around 1920 to 1930), the following transitions were observed. 1) In 1923 (Taisho 12), the Kantoh earthquake happened and it attacked Yokohama where the function as main trade port was almost totally destroyed. ... 2) The earthquake happened just at the time when the tariff protectionism was increasingly promoted in every country. ... 3) Since the port of Yokohama, as trade port, was damaged by the earthquake at that time and the government import statistic data were limited to a partial summing-up, our investigation was referred to the statistic data at the ports of Osaka and Kobe. ...\n\nCumulative incidence and prevalence of childhood autism in children in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nHonda, H; Shimizu, Y; Misumi, K; Niimi, M; Ohashi, Y\n\n1996-08-01\n\nAn epidemiological survey of childhood autism as defined in ICD-10 Research Criteria was conducted in the northern part of Yokohama, Japan. The routine health checkup for 18-month-old children served as the initial mass-screening, and all facilities which provide child care services function to detect all cases with childhood autism and refer them to the Yokohama Rehabilitation Centre. Cumulative incidence of childhood autism up to 5 years of age among the birth cohort of 1988, and prevalence on 1 January 1994, among residents born in 1988 were estimated Cumulative incidence and prevalence were 16.2 per 10,000 and 21.1 per 10,000, respectively. Children with high-functioning autism who had IQs of 70 and over constituted approximately half of all the children with childhood autism. CONCLUSION. It was confirmed through better detection of high-functioning cases that childhood autism in Japan is more common than formerly estimated.\n\nTokyo, Japan\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1981-01-01\n\nTokyo, (35.5N, 140.0E) the capital city of Japan, Tokyo Bay and the neighboring cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki and Chiba are seen in this view of Japan.

Furthermore, although different from FDEIA, one student who had completed oral immunotherapy developed anaphylaxis during exercise after eating causative food. There have been few large-scale epidemiological studies of FDEIA, however, in elementary school children, therefore we conducted an epidemiological study in elementary school children in Yokohama to clarify the frequency and characteristic of FDEIA. We sent a questionnaire regarding the occurrence of FDEIA to all 348 public elementary school nurses in Yokohama. We also compared the results with those for junior-high school that we previously reported. We excluded those children with a past history of immediate food allergy who had achieved desensitization status after oral immunotherapy, from FDEIA, and instead defined them as having desensitization status and exercise-induced anaphylaxis (DEIA). Of 348 school nurses, 317 responded (91.1%). Overall, eight of 170Â 146 children were diagnosed with FDEIA, which was significantly lower than the prevalence in junior-high school students (0.0047% vs 0.018%, P = 0.0009). The causative foods were wheat (n = 4), and soy, fruit, crustaceans, and squid (n = 1 each). Four children had DEIA and the causative foods were wheat and milk (n = 2 each). Multiple episodes occurred in five children with FDEIA and in three children with DEIA. FDEIA was far less common in elementary school than in junior-high school, and wheat was the major causative food. The new appearance of DEIA was notable. Decreasing episode recurrence remains an issue that needs to be resolved.

PM2.5 with alum was injected intraperitoneally for sensitization. Five days later, 200 Î¼g of PM2.5 in 25 Î¼L of saline was administered to mice intranasally five times for further sensitization. On the 11th day, PM2.5 was administered as a challenge. On the 12th day, mice were examined for airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell count, mRNA expression of Th 1 , Th 2 cytokines, and metallothioneins in lung tissue, and histopathology. PM2.5 increased AHR, total cell numbers including eosinophils in BALF, and mRNA levels of IL-5, IL-22, eotaxin, eotaxin 2, and metallothionein 3. In PM2.5-induced lungs, inflammation was observed around the bronchus. These results demonstrate that PM2.5 alone, collected with the cyclone system in Yokohama city in Japan, induces asthma-like airway inflammation. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Retrospective cohort study. Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan. Twenty-four women with progestin-negative hypothalamic amenorrhea. Administration of human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) and treatment with a combination of estrogen and progesterone. Plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations and period required for recovery from amenorrhea. Plasma ACTH concentrations 30 and 60 minutes after injection of hCRH and the percent maximum increment (%Cmax) of ACTH were significantly lower in the amenorrheic patients compared with the control group patients. The basal cortisol was significantly higher, and the %Cmax of cortisol was significantly lower. In the 16 patients who recovered from amenorrhea, there was a significant positive correlation (Y = 1.93X-10.8, r = 0.629) between the basal cortisol concentrations (X) and the period for recovery (Y). The serum E2 gradually increased before recovery, and this E2 increase was preceded by changes in the plasma cortisol concentration and the %Cmax values of cortisol and ACTH. The CRH test might be useful for evaluating the roles of stress and for estimating the period required for recovery in hypothalamic amenorrhea.\n\nONRASIA Scientific Information Bulletin.

Sixty-eight patients who underwent cataract surgery at the Department of Ophthalmology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, or its affiliate, Kanazawa Hospital, Yokohama, were enrolled in this study. They received one or both of the following: 1.0 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip and LVFX ophthalmic solution applied four times at 30-minute intervals, both beginning two hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX and LVFX concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mean intraoperative FMOX and LVFX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 1.21 +/- 0.63 microg/ml and 0.69 +/- 0.47 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations sufficiently exceeded the MIC90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes. The FMOX and LVFX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. These drugs may have efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.\n\nToward an Arctic Strategy\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-02-01\n\nArctic Sea Ice Extent6 Reduced ice pack area translates to less reflected solar energy, which further accelerates the ongoing melting process .

Yokohama is the second largest city in Japan, about 25 km southeast of Tokyo. The first workshop of the series was held in Strasbourg, France, in 2008 and the second one was in Brussels, Belgium, in 2010. The purpose of SOTANCP3 was to discuss the present status and future perspectives of the nuclear cluster physics. The following nine topics were selected in order to cover most of the scientific programme and highlight an area where new ideas have emerged over recent years: (1) Cluster structures and many-body correlations in stable and unstable nuclei (2) Clustering aspects of nuclear reactions and resonances (3) Alpha condensates and analogy with condensed matter approaches (4) Role of tensor force in cluster physics and ab initio approaches (5) Clustering in hypernuclei (6) Nuclear fission, superheavy nuclei, and cluster decay (7) Cluster physics and nuclear astrophysics (8) Clustering in nuclear matter and neutron stars (9) Clustering in hadron and atomic physics There were 122 participants, including 53 from 17 foreign countries. In addition to invited talks, we had many talks selected from contributed papers. There were plenary, parallel, and poster sessions. Poster contributions were also presented as four-minute talks in parallel sessions. This proceedings contains the papers presented in invited and selected talks together with those presented in poster sessions. We would like to express our gratitude to the members of the International Advisory Committee and those of the Organizing Committee for their efforts which made this workshop successful. In particular we would like to present our great thanks to Drs. Y. Funaki, W. Horiuchi, N. Itagaki, M. Kimura, T. Myo, and T. Yoshida. We would like also to thank the following organizations for their sponsors: RCNP\n\nU. S.

On the behalf of the organizing committee, I certainly welcome all your visits to KGU Kannai Media Center belonging to Kanto Gakuin University, and stay in Yokohama. In particular, to whom come from abroad more than 17 countries, I would appreciate your participations after long long trips from your homeland to Yokohama. The first international workshop on \"State of the Art in Nuclear Cluster Physics\", called SOTANCP, was held in Strasbourg, France, in 2008, and the second one was held in Brussels, Belgium, in 2010. Then the third workshop is now held in Yokohama. In this period, we had the traditional 10th cluster conference in Debrecen, Hungary, in 2012. Thus we have the traditional cluster conference and SOTANCP, one after another, every two years. This obviously shows our field of nuclear cluster physics is very active and flourishing. It is for the first time in about 10 years to hold the international workshop on nuclear cluster physics in Japan, because the last cluster conference held in Japan was in Nara in 2003, about 10 years ago. The president in Nara conference was Prof. K. Ikeda, and the chairpersons were Prof. H. Horiuchi and Prof. I. Tanihata. I think, quite a lot of persons in this room had participated at the Nara conference. Since then, about ten years passed. So, this workshop has profound significance for our Japanese colleagues. The subjects of this workshop are to discuss \"the state of the art in nuclear cluster physics\" and also discuss the prospect of this field. In a couple of years, we saw significant progresses of this field both in theory and in experiment, which have brought better and new understandings on the clustering aspects in stable and unstable nuclei. I think, the concept of clustering has been more important than ever. This is true also in the\n\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. - At Port Canaveral, the Pressurized Module of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) is lifted out of the shipâs cargo hold.

The specimens and photographs were initially reported on the internet-based social networking site, Twitter. Two specimens of Carassius auratus, including an aquarium form, were also reported at the same locality and date, suggesting that the illegal introductions originated from an aquarium release. Our report demonstrates an example of web data mining in the discipline of Citizen Science.\n\nWaste reduction and recycling initiatives in Japanese cities: lessons from Yokohama and Kamakura.\n\nPubMed\n\nHotta, Yasuhiko; Aoki-Suzuki, Chika\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWaste reduction and recycling at the city level will acquire greater significance in the near future due to rising global volumes of waste. This paper seeks to identify policy-relevant drivers for successful promotion of waste reduction and recycling. Factors influencing the success of waste reduction and recycling campaigns are identified. Two case study cities in Japan which depict the successful use of the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) at the municipal level are presented. In these cases, the existence of incinerators, which are generally considered as disincentives for recycling, was not functioning as a disincentive but rather as an incentive for waste reduction. Owing to the high cost of incineration facilities, the movement to close incinerators has become a strong incentive for waste reduction and recycling in these two cities. The study suggests that careful consideration is necessary when making decisions concerning high-cost waste treatment facilities with high installation, maintenance and renewal outlays. In addition, intensive source separation and other municipal recycling initiatives have a high potential for producing positive results. Â© The Author(s) 2014.\n\nPTC Mid Year Seminar.

Since September 2008, POEM has been successfully performed in more than 200 consecutive patients with symptomatic achalasia at the Digestive Disease Center of Showa University, Northern Yokohama Hospital, Yokohama, Japan, with excellent short- and long-term results and absence of serious complications. International experience of POEM within clinical studies is also promising. According to these results, POEM is considered as a safe procedure that can be applied to all achalasia patients. However, the low incidence of achalasia (0.3%â1% per 100,000 population), in combination with the potential serious complications related to the technically demanding POEM procedure, has made training difficult. There is therefore an urgent need for an animal model for training to decrease the learning curve. Further, there are other ethical and training issues to address. The pig is the most appropriate animal model for training in POEM due to its anatomy being similar to that of humans. The porcine esophagus has the advantage of easy mobilization due to absence of tight junctions to surrounding organs. A non-survival porcine model would be a simple, inexpensive, and reproducible animal model for training in POEM, without the need for concern about complications. A possible training process might first involve observation of POEM performed by specialists, then training on non-survival and survival porcine models, followed by training in humans under specialist guidance and finally, performance of POEM in humans.

Trend-cycle components (Trend) that control for the weekly effects, other irregular variance for asthmatic attack incidence and environmental parameter measurements were estimated from the original data series using the method of Akaike and Ishiguro (1980). The rate of increase for each environmental parameter was then calculated from its trend-cycle components. We classified the data into four stages on the basis of rising and falling temperature and humidity. For each stage of temperature and humidity, fluctuation we estimated correlations between the number of asthmatic attack visits and original data series measurements, estimated trend-cycle components, and calculated rates of increase for each of the air pollutants. The daily number of asthmatic attack visits was negatively correlated to the daily mean values of all air pollutants, but positively correlated to the daily mean temperature and relative humidity. The trend-cycle components of the air pollutants were also negatively correlated to the frequencies of asthmatic attacks (p < 0.01 for all pollutants except NO2). In contrast, the number of asthmatic attack visits were in general positively correlated with increasing levels of pollutants. Furthermore, when both temperature and relative humidity decreased, significant correlations (r > 0.31, p < 0.001) between the number of asthmatic attacks and increased rates of all air pollutants were observed (r: NO2 > NO > SO2 > SPM).\n\nNo immediate relief for large mining tire shortage\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFiscor, S.\n\n2006-05-15\n\nInventories are low and they will not get better anytime soon, but mine operators do have a few options.

The Extraction and Refinement (E&R) Strategy utilizes a public children's health surveillance program to produce maximum efficacy in early detection of autism. In the extraction stage, all cases at risk of childhood problems, including developmental abnormality, are identified; in the refinement stage, cases without problems are excluded, leaving only cases with conclusive diagnoses. The city of Yokohama, Japan, conducts a routine child health surveillance program for children at 18 months in which specialized public health nurses administer YACHT-18 (Young Autism and other developmental disorders CHeckup Tool), a screening instrument to identify children at risk for developmental disorders. Children who screen positive undergo further observation, and those without disorders are subsequently excluded. To study the efficacy of early detection procedures for developmental disorders, including autism, 2,814 children born in 1988, examined at 18 months of age, and not already receiving treatment for diseases or disorders were selected. In the extraction stage, 402 (14.3%) children were identified for follow-up. In the refinement stage, 19 (.7%) of these were referred to the Yokohama Rehabilitation Center and diagnosed with developmental disorders. The extraction stage produced four false negatives, bringing total diagnoses of developmental disorders to 23 (.8%) - including 5 with autistic disorder and 9 with pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDDNOS). Sensitivity was 60% for autistic disorder and 82.6% for developmental disorders. Specificity for developmental disorders rose to 100% with the E&R Strategy. Picture cards used in YACHT-18 provided a finer screen that excluded some false positive cases.

We report 4 cases of penile fracture treated at the Department of Urology, Yokohama City University between 2005 and 2012. The age of the patients ranged between 26 and 67 years (mean age, 41.5 years). Of the patients in our series, 3 sustained injury during sexual intercourse, and 1 while rolling over in bed. All patients were treated surgically and cured without any functional disturbance after treatment. Reports before 2002 and 99 cases after 2002 were also reviewed. The number of patients between 40 and 60 years was increasing. Magnetic resonance imaging was useful to detect the site of penile fracture and immediate surgical treatment was important.\n\n[The advertisements of drug in newspaper by Ginkou Kishida].\n\nPubMed\n\nAmano, H; Kawabuchi, M; Tanaka, Y; Saitou, A; Sugihara, M\n\n1992-01-01\n\nGinko Kishida, who was a journalist formerly, took advantage of newpaper to publicize ophthalmicus.

A food-borne outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with SaV occurred among junior high school students in Yokohama, Japan, during and after a study trip. The nucleotide sequences of the partial capsid gene derived from the students exhibited 98% homology to a SaV genogroup IV strain, Hu/Angelholm/SW278/2004/SE, which was isolated from an adult with gastroenteritis in Solna, Sweden. An identical nucleotide sequence was detected from a food handler at the hotel restaurant, suggesting that the causative agent of the outbreak was transmitted from the food handler. This is the first description of a food-borne outbreak associated with the SaV genogroup IV strain in Japan.\n\nAcute toxic tests of rainwater samples using Daphnia magna.\n\nPubMed\n\nSakai, Manabu\n\n2006-06-01\n\nRainwater samples were collected at Isogo Ward of Yokohama City, Japan, from 23 June to 31 July 2003. The toxic potency of pollutants present in 13 rainwater samples was tested using Daphnia magna. Most test animals died within 48 h in five test solutions that were prepared from rainwater samples. On the other hand, when nonpolar compounds such as pesticides were removed from rainwater samples before the toxic tests, mortalities in all test solutions were less than 10%. Eight kinds of pesticides were detected in rainwater samples. The highest concentration was of dichlorvos, at 0.74 microg/L. Results indicated that insecticides in rainwater sometimes lethally affected D. magna and that toxic potency of insecticides that are present in rainwater constitutes an important problem for environmental protection.\n\nAtmospheric deposition of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in the Kanto Region, Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgura, I; Masunaga, S; Nakanishi, J\n\n2001-09-01\n\nThe atmospheric bulk (dry and wet) deposition of dioxins was investigated at four locations (Tokyo, Yokohama, Tsukuba, and Tanzawa) in the Kanto region (in Japan) over one year using a stainless-steel pot. Annual average polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) deposition fluxes were estimated to be from 450 to 1300 ng/m2/yr, and the annual average TEQ fluxes from 5.7 to 17 ng-TEQ/m2/yr at the four locations. The PCDD/PCDF deposition flux was higher in winter than in summer. The deposition flux could be related to ambient temperature, particularly for less chlorinated PCDDs/PCDFs, while the deposition flux is not necessarily related to the amount of precipitation. The PCDD/PCDF deposition flux increased as the particle deposition flux increased, for the winter samples. Based on the ratio of the PCDD/PCDF deposition fluxes to the particle deposition fluxes, the contribution of the reentrainment of soil particles to the TEQ of PCDD/PCDF deposition was considered to be negligible in this region. Based on the air concentrations monitored near our deposition sampling points by the municipalities, the ratio of the annual deposition flux to the annual average air concentration was roughly estimated to be 0.082 cm/s. The range of deposition flux in the Kanto region was estimated to be from 1.5 to 31 (median: 9.8) ng-TEQ/m2/yr based on the range of air concentration data measured by the municipalities. The total annual deposition flux in the entire Kanto region was estimated to range from 50 to 900 g-TEQ/yr (median 320 g-TEQ/yr). This estimated flux was of the same order as the sum of estimated emissions from municipal solid waste incinerators and industrial waste incinerators in the Kanto region. The contributions of dioxin-like PCBs in Yokohama, Tsukuba, and Tanzawa depositions were less than 10% of the total TEQ; however, in Tokyo it was almost equal to or more than 50%.\n\nCarbon Dioxide, Hydrographic, and Chemical Data Obtained During the R/V Thomas G.

As a result, Japanese vaccine manufacturers will replace LP93 with A/equine/Yokohama/aq13/2010 (Y10, Fc2). To assess the benefit of updating the vaccine, five horses vaccinated with inactivated Y10 vaccine and five vaccinated with inactivated LP93 were challenged by exposure to a nebulized aerosol of CL11.

We estimated the concentrations of the mist water, the average concentration of the mist droplets, via the determination of water-soluble components of the coarse aerosol and the observation of the imprints of the droplets on a MgO-coated glass slide. The pH of the mist water was estimated from the equilibrium calculation with the data of the Gran plot of the solution of the dissolved coarse particles, the inorganic ion concentrations of aerosol larger than 10 Î¼m, and the estimated volume of mist water. The mist water was measured as about 1 eq/L total concentration for typical inorganic ions and about pH 4.5 in Yokohama. Such highly concentrated mist droplets may have intense environmental effects.\n\nParticipatory conservation approaches for satoyama, the traditional forest and agricultural landscape of Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobori, Hiromi; Primack, Richard B\n\n2003-06-01\n\nThe traditional agricultural landscape of Japan, known as satoyama, consists of a mixture of forests, wet rice paddy fields, grasslands, and villages. This landscape supports a great diversity of plant and animal species, many of which are significant to the Japanese culture. The satoyama landscape is currently being rapidly converted to residential and industrial uses in Japan's expanding metropolitan areas, with the local loss of many species. Only 7% of the land in the Yokohama area remains as satoyama. City residents and older farmers have become key participants in programs to protect examples of satoyama. Many urban residents value the experience of participating in agricultural and conservation activities once they are made aware of the threat faced by the satoyama landscape. In one particularly successful program, conservation efforts and fund-raising are linked to \"Totoro\", an imaginary forest animal featured in a popular animated film.\n\nPositioning of nasobiliary tube using magnet-loaded catheters.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatanabe, Seitaro; Sato, Takamitsu; Kato, Shingo; Hosono, Kunihiro; Kobayashi, Noritoshi; Nakajima, Atsushi; Kubota, Kensuke\n\n2013-10-01\n\nIn endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD), repositioning the catheter from the mouth to the nose is complicated. We devised a method using catheters with magnets and verified its utility and safety. We prospectively enrolled 20 patients undergoing ENBD at Yokohama City University Hospital. The procedures were successful in all 20 cases and no case required a change of operators to a senior doctor. The mean time for the procedure was 36.6 seconds. The emetic reflex was induced 0.5 times on average using the magnet method. The mean X-ray exposure time was 29.6 seconds. No complications occurred. The magnet-loaded catheter method for positioning the ENBD catheter before finally leading it through the nose took little time and was performed successfully and safely. Therefore, the magnet method could become the first choice among techniques for ENBD catheter placement.

The five-man expedition was led by Francisco DÃ­az Covarrubias. They succeeded in establishing two observing stations near Yokohama, one in Nogue-no-Yama and one on a hill called \"The Bluff\", and also in determining precise geographical positions for them. Clear skies allowed the observation of the transit at both stations. The results were presented in Paris in 1875, and published on the same year. They were meant as a contribution to be processed along with all other data obtained by different missions. The importance of the expedition for the development of early modern science in Mexico - particularly astronomy - is examined in the broad context of the social and political conditions then prevailing in the country. The relevance of the mission for the establishment of scientific, cultural and even commercial ties between Japan and Mexico is emphasized.\n\nMagnetic Enzymatic Platform for Organophosphate Pesticide Detection Using Boron-doped Diamond Electrodes.\n\nPubMed\n\nPino, Flavio; Ivandini, Tribidasari A; Nakata, Kazuya; Fujishima, Akira; MerkoÃ§i, Arben; Einaga, Yasuaki\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA simple and reliable enzymatic system for organophosporus pesticide detection was successfully developed, by exploiting the synergy between the magnetic beads collection capacity and the outstanding electrochemistry property of boron-doped diamond electrodes. The determination of an organophosphate pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF), was performed based on the inhibition system of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase bonded to magnetic beads through a biotin-streptavidin complex system. A better sensitivity was found for a system with magnetic beads in the concentration range of 10(-9) to 10(-5) M. The estimated limits of detection based on IC10 (10% acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition) have been detected and optimized to be 5.7 Ã 10(-10) M CPF. Spiked samples of water of Yokohama (Japan) have been measured to validate the efficiency of the enzymatic system. The results suggested that the use of magnetic beads to immobilize biomolecules or biosensing agents is suitable to maintain the superiority of BDD electrodes.\n\nMHD Stability in Compact Stellarators\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Guoyong\n\n1999-11-01\n\nA key issue for current carrying compact stellarators(S.P. Hirshman et al., \"Physics of compact stellarators\", Phys. Plasmas 6, 1858 (1999).) is the stability of ideal MHD modes. We present recent stability results of external kink modes, ballooning mode, and vertical modes in Quasi-axisymmetric Stellarators (QAS)( A. Reiman et al, \"Physics issue in the design of a high beta Quasi-Axisymmetric Stellarator\" the 17th IAEA Fusion Energy conference, (Yokohama, Japan, October 1998), Paper ICP/06.) as well as Quasi-Omnigeneous Stellarators (QOS)^2. The 3D stability code Terpsichore(W. A. Cooper et al., Phys. Plasmas 3, 275 (1996)) is used in this study. The vertical stability in a current carrying stellarator is studied for the first time. The vertical mode is found to be stabilized by externally generated poloidal flux(G.Y. Fu et al., \"Stability of vertical mode in a current carrying stellarator\"., to be submitted). Physically, this is because the external poloidal flux enhances the field line bending energy relative to the current drive term in the MHD energy principle, Î´ W. A simple stability criteria is derived in the limit of large aspect ratio and constant current density. For wall at infinite distance from the plasma, the amount of external flux needed for stabilization is given by f=(Îº^2-Îº)/(Îº^2+1) where Îº is the axisymmetric elongation and f is the fraction of the external rotational transform at the plasma edge. A systematic parameter study shows that the external kink in QAS can be stabilized at high beta ( ~ 5%) without a conducting wall by combination of edge magnetic shear and 3D shaping(G. Y. Fu et al., \"MHD stability calculations of high-beta Quasi-Axisymmetric Stellarators\", the 17th IAEA Fusion Energy conference, (Yokohama, Japan, October 1998), paper THP1/07.). The optimal shaping is obtained by using an optimizer with kink stability included in its objective function. The physics mechanism for the kink modes is studied by examining relative\n\nGlucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiwa, S\n\n1980-01-01\n\nFifty-four cases of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency have so far been reported in Japan. Among them, 21 G6PD variants have been characterized. Nineteen out of the 21 variants were characterized in our laboratory and G6PD Heian and \"Kyoto\" by others. G6PD Tokyo, Tokushima, Ogikubo, Kurume, Fukushima, Yokohama, Yamaguchi, Wakayama, Akita, Heian and \"Kyoto\" were classified as Class 1, because all these cases showed chronic hemolytic anemia and severe enzyme deficiency. All these variants showed thermal instability. G6PD Mediterranean-like, Ogori, Gifu and Fukuoka were classified as Class 2, whereas G6PD Hofu, B(-) Chinese, Ube, Konan, Kamiube and Kiwa belonged to Class 3. All the 6 Class 3 variants were found as the results of the screening tests. The incidence of the deficiency in Japanese seems to be 0.1-0.5% but that of the cases which may slow drug-induced hemolysis would be much less. G6PD Ube and Konan appear to be relatively common in Japan.\n\n[Analysis of phthalates in aromatic and deodorant aerosol products and evaluation of exposure risk].\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Yoshiki; Sugaya, Naeko; Nakagawa, Tomoo; Morita, Masatoshi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe established an analytical method for the detection of seven phthalates, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate (DEP), benzyl butyl phthalate, di-i-butyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and di-n-octhyl phthalate, using an ultra high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a photodiode array detector. This method is quick, with minimal contamination, and was applied to the analysis of aromatic and deodorant aerosol products. Phthalates were detected in 15 of 52 samples purchased from 1999 to 2012 in Yokohama. Three types of phthalate (DEP, DBP, DEHP) were detected, and their concentrations ranged from 0.0085-0.23% DEP in nine samples, 0.012-0.045% DBP in four samples, and 0.012-0.033% DEHP in four samples. No other phthalate esters were detected. Furthermore, we estimated phthalate exposure via breathing in commonly used aromatic and deodorant aerosol products, then evaluated the associated risk. The estimated levels of phthalate exposure were lower than the tolerated daily limit, but the results indicated that aromatic and deodorant aerosol products could be a significant source of phthalate exposure.\n\n\"Azul Platino\": another Spanish natural stone to be considered as Global Heritage Stone Resource.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJosÃ© Tejado, Juan; Mota, M. Isabel; Pereira, Dolores\n\n2014-05-01\n\nSeveral granites are quarried in Extremadura, Spain, with very good aesthetic and physic and mechanical characteristics. \"Azul Platino\" has a striking bluish colour and its properties make this granite a perfect option for most applications as ornamental rocks. This granite has been used for centuries, first in the architectonic heritage of the extraction surrounding area, but afterwards in many important projects in Spain, Europe and all around the world: La Guardia Airport (NYC, USA), Yokohama Bridge (Tokyo, Japan), European Parliament (Brussels, Belgium), Planetarium (Valencia, Spain), Tenerife Auditorium (Tenerife, Spain), Suntec City (Singapore), MTR Kowlonn Station (Hong Kong), O'Connel Street (Dublin, Ireland), .... One important characteristic of this natural stone is the low radon exhalation that all the varieties, including the more weathered ones, show. For being a granite, this is an important characteristic for its use, both in interior and exterior use. But \"Azul Platino\" accomplishes all requirements to be considered as a nominee for Global Heritage Stone Resource consideration. Together with other local natural stones, it could be part as well of a Global Heritage Stone Province nomination.\n\nA new probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for greater Tokyo\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStein, R.S.; Toda, S.; Parsons, T.; Grunewald, E.; Blong, R.; Sparks, S.; Shah, H.; Kennedy, J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTokyo and its outlying cities are home to one-quarter of Japan's 127 million people. Highly destructive earthquakes struck the capital in 1703, 1855 and 1923, the last of which took 105 000 lives. Fuelled by greater Tokyo's rich seismological record, but challenged by its magnificent complexity, our joint Japanese-US group carried out a new study of the capital's earthquake hazards. We used the prehistoric record of great earthquakes preserved by uplifted marine terraces and tsunami deposits (17 M???8 shocks in the past 7000 years), a newly digitized dataset of historical shaking (10 000 observations in the past 400 years), the dense modern seismic network (300 000 earthquakes in the past 30 years), and Japan's GeoNet array (150 GPS vectors in the past 10 years) to reinterpret the tectonic structure, identify active faults and their slip rates and estimate their earthquake frequency. We propose that a dislodged fragment of the Pacific plate is jammed between the Pacific, Philippine Sea and Eurasian plates beneath the Kanto plain on which Tokyo sits. We suggest that the Kanto fragment controls much of Tokyo's seismic behaviour for large earthquakes, including the damaging 1855 M???7.3 Ansei-Edo shock. On the basis of the frequency of earthquakes beneath greater Tokyo, events with magnitude and location similar to the M??? 7.3 Ansei-Edo event have a ca 20% likelihood in an average 30 year period. In contrast, our renewal (time-dependent) probability for the great M??? 7.9 plate boundary shocks such as struck in 1923 and 1703 is 0.5% for the next 30 years, with a time-averaged 30 year probability of ca 10%. The resulting net likelihood for severe shaking (ca 0.9g peak ground acceleration (PGA)) in Tokyo, Kawasaki and Yokohama for the next 30 years is ca 30%. The long historical record in Kanto also affords a rare opportunity to calculate the probability of shaking in an alternative manner exclusively from intensity observations. This approach permits robust estimates\n\nA new probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for greater Tokyo.\n\nPubMed\n\nStein, Ross S; Toda, Shinji; Parsons, Tom; Grunewald, Elliot\n\n2006-08-15\n\nTokyo and its outlying cities are home to one-quarter of Japan's 127 million people.

This study has been performed using the thermal simulation computer program UWENSOL. Climatic data used in this analysis were for Yokohama, Japan, which has a subtropical humid climate similar to Washington, D.C. (in terms of winter air temperatures and useful radiation). Initial studies considered the use of different wall thicknesses, glazing types, and orientations for a Trombe wall and alternate storage quantities for a walk-in greenhouse. Employing a number of comparative parametric studies an economical and efficientmoreÂ Â» combination of devices was selected. Then, using a computer routine COMFORT which is based on the Fanger Comfort Equation, another series of parametric analyses were performed to evaluate the degree of thermal comfort for the occupants of the house. The results of these analyses demonstrated that an averaged Predicted Mean Vote of less than 0.3 from a thermally-neutral condition could be maintained and that less than 10% of all occupants of such a passively-heated house would be thermally uncomfortable.Â«Â less\n\nProceedings of Symposium on Physics of Target Implosion and Pulsed Power Techniques Held in Yokohama, Japan on 30 September-1 October 1987\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1988-02-01\n\nJapan. -- ,, mnm mmmm m m mil II m mlmmmm PREFACE A It is reported that by using the Nd glass laser, experiments of beam-target interaction are carried...Beam 8. 14.00-14.30 T.
