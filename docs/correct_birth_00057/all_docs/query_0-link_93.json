        "text": "Homeschooled Until Age 9\n\nAt the age of 9, I started attending elementary school after being homeschooled. Both my parents are Japanese, but I was raised in English through homeschooling, so I learned Japanese for the first time at school. Starting school, I felt uncomfortable because I didn’t understand typical group behavior or social skills, but thanks to homeschooling, I can now speak English and write English lyrics.\n\nIntroduction to Music: Mariah Carey and Celine Dion\n\nWhen I was young, I only knew Christian music, Mariah Carey, and Celine Dion. It was really shocking when I heard Mariah Carey and Celine Dion’s songs and thought, “Music is amazing.” Around the fifth grade, I started listening to Avril Lavigne’s songs too.\n\nDeveloping Self-love was a Gradual Process\n\nIn junior high school, there were hardly any queer people around, or rather, I didn’t even know of their existence. It bothered me that even on TV, everything seemed to be about “J-POP” or conforming to certain genres, and it felt like you had to fit into those molds to be part of entertainment. So, I used to think, “People like me…” People like me would have to hide forever. If I had known queer people back then, my perspective at the time would have definitely changed. I would have realized much sooner that it’s okay to do what I like. It took me a really long time to love myself, so what I’m singing now is also for that past self of mine. I’m creating what that past self wanted to see and hear."
