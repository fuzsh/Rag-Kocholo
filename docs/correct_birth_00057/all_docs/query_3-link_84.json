        "text": "Between 2014 and 2019, Judge Sugiyama served as the chair of the Judicial Council of California’s Probate and Mental Health Advisory Committee. During his tenure, he helped inform the judicial branch’s position on all proposed state legislation in the field of probate law affecting the administration and operations of the courts. He also guided the amendment of existing Rules of Court and Official Judicial Council Forms, as well as the formulation of new rules and forms that were responsive to legislative enactments, judicial decisions and changed circumstances in the legal environment.\n\nWhen he served as a bench officer, Judge Sugiyama was highly respected as a thoughtful, compassionate jurist who decisively issued well-reasoned decisions and orders. His written rulings were regarded for their clarity and rigor. At appropriate moments in proceedings in which litigants took seemingly intractable, irreconcilable positions, he often drew on a wealth of historical, literary and film references and allusions that enabled counsel to develop new perspectives that led to equitable case resolutions on their own.\n\nADR Experience and Qualifications"
