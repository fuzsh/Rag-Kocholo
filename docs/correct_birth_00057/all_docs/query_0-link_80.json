        "text": "In this fifth installment of our “Nitobe Fellows in Conversation” series, we interviewed Yoshimichi Sato (Professor and Dean, Faculty of Humanities, Kyoto University of Advanced Sciences; Professor, Graduate School of Arts and Letters, Tohoku University), who conducted overseas research at the University of Chicago, USA, as a Nitobe Fellow.\n\nSocial capital research is based on the idea that human relationships can have positive and negative effects. Sato says that his research on social capital, which he came across by chance at the University of Chicago during his overseas research, greatly influenced his research and life afterwards. Social capital has a positive effect that chance encounters can open up and enrich one’s life. On the other hand, it can also have a negative effect, as people can pull each other down and prevent the success and growth of others. Mr. Sato spoke in detail about the significance of building bridges between the social capitals of different groups in a society that is becoming increasingly “divided.\n\nPlease take a moment to listen to this interview and learn more about how each chance encounter has the potential to change your life.\n\nYoshimich SATO (Professor and Dean, Faculty of Humanities, Kyoto University of Advanced Sciences | Professor, Graduate School of Letters, Tohoku University/ Nitobe Fellow 1992-94)\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1957.
