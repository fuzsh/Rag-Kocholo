        "text": "Nadia was playing with a heavily taped right elbow which she had strained earlier in the week while practicing. Nadia said: \"[Sania is] a very good young player, very powerful, has great groundstrokes. The most difficult thing was that I hadn't really played a match in three weeks, and I had to play someone so powerful. She definitely was not an easy person to play in my first match... I'm not disappointed. My arm is getting better and hopefully, I'll get more practice matches in, get in better shape and be ready for Los Angeles.\"\n\nKim was presented with an award for \"Comeback Player of the Year,\" and posed for a photo with Francisco \"Pancho\" (aka \"Segoo\") Segura, who received a \"Legends\" award. Segura's strong & accurate two-handed forehand earned him a place in tennis history, mostly in the 40s and 50s (3 of the ladies in the 2005 Acura main draw use the 2-handed forehand: Akiko Morigami, Shuai Peng, and Marion Bartoli). Segura is also appreciated for his sense of humor.\n\nAbout the match Kim said: \"In the beginning, [Marta] made some great shots, some good volleys, but I kept focused and eventually she started to miss...\n\n\"The fans and everyone here have been supporting me and saying that I can win it this time, but no player can think that way. It's not as easy as what people are saying to me.\"\n\nNathalie said: \"I had a real battle this morning, winning in the breaker of the final set after three hours spent on the court.\n\n\"When I came out, my feet were burning so much... I took a cold shower, stretching, massage, pasta, nap and then I was back on-court for dubs with Francesca. Even if we didn't win that one, I had so much fun playing with her and I never laugh so much on the court, and the crowd too.\n\n\"Then it was time for bike, stretching, massage and there we go. It's nice to know that I'm playing the night match tomorrow...\" Nathalie's WTA Diary\n\nThis is probably Ai's biggest win in singles since she defeated Nadia Petrova 1-6, 6-1, 6-4 to win the Gold Coast title in January, 2004. After that win Ai's singles ranking reached a career high of # 8.\n\nAi has been working with a new hitting partner (Simone Amorico, an Italian) and a new fitness trainer. Ai said: \"My goal is to get back into the top 10. My fitness is getting better and with the new team I'm getting my confidence back. I don't want to end my career not playing at the level I'm capable of.\" Reuters story\n\nSvetlana said: \"[Ai] concentrated during the whole match and I didn't. I had too many ups and downs. [The past] month was the longest break I've ever had from tennis, and I need some more matches before I get my form back... I think I was playing good tennis at times. I just didn't keep my level at the top... I gave her a chance to get into the match in the second [set]. And in the third, it was much more difficult to beat her.\" AP story\n\nMary said: \"Patty is a great player, she always puts up a great fight against me. I think I played well. It wasn't my best match, but she made it difficult in the end. On the big points, she would just keep hitting winners. The key for me is to be aggressive and play my game.\"\n\nPatty said: \"[Mary] played great. I was really tired, my arm is hurting a bit, my back is hurting a bit. She has her first tournament (since Wimbledon) and I'm on my third. So if you're not like 100 percent, she's too tough.\"\n\nShuai said: \"This was my first time to play Kim Clijsters and at the beginning of the match, I was so nervous that I didn't think too much, just hit. I kept telling myself to believe that I could win and to take all my chances.\"\n\nKim said: \"[Shuai is] probably one of the best hitters I've played so far. I tried to change it up but she had an answer for everything. I don't think I played bad. In fact, I don't put any blame on myself; she just played so well and didn't miss.\""
