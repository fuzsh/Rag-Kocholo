        "text": "Hayakawa Mechanical Pencil\n\nTokuji invented a unique thrusting device for a pencil's lead and inserted it into an attractive and sturdy metallic shaft. He called this product the Hayakawa Mechanical Pencil. At first, stationers had a number of criticisms: the metallic outer shaft was cold to the touch in winter, and the design clashed with the kimonos that were still widely worn at the time in Japan. But popularity jumped after a large order came in from a trading firm in Yokohama exporting to the West, and soon stationers in Japan were placing a steady stream of orders for the Hayakawa Mechanical Pencil. Tokuji improved the product by developing ultra-thin lead and he named this newer version the Ever-Ready Sharp Pencil. It became known simply as the Sharp Pencil, and the name lives on in our company name today.\n\nJapan's First TV Set <TV3-14T>\n\nThe age of television in Japan began in 1953 when Sharp became the first Japanese company to mass produce TV sets. But Sharp's research into television goes back to 1931, a time when radios were just beginning to take off in Japan. Thanks to ultra-short wave technology gained from research during and after World War II, Sharp was able to build Japan's first TV set prototype in 1951. At the end of 1952, Sharp put Japan's first TV sets on the market and in 1953 became the first company in Japan to mass produce them. Sharp's first TV set, the TV3-14T, was priced at 175,000 yen-at that time the initial salary for high school graduates was 5,400 yen a month. With the goal of putting a TV set in every household, Sharp took the industry lead in bringing down costs so that this new appliance could be affordable to as many people as possible.\n\nAll-Transistor-Diode Electronic Desktop Calculator <CS-10A>\n\nThe CS-10A was the world's first electronic desktop calculator using all-transistor diodes. It sold for 535,000 yen, about the same price as a 1,300 cc car. Four years earlier, in 1960, upon urging from young engineers at Sharp, the company had embarked on research into areas including computers and semiconductors. With the release in 1964 of the CS-10A, Sharp achieved its long-held goal of downsizing computers into a compact calculator that could be used by anyone, anywhere, and anytime. In December 2005, the electronic desktop calculator first commercialized by Sharp was recognized with a prestigious IEEE Milestone*1 from the IEEE*2, a worldwide electrical and electronics engineering society.\n\nSuper Mobile LCD Eliminated the Need for a Backlight\n\nWhile conventional transmissive LCDs used a backlight to make the display visible, the effects of sunlight made them rather difficult to see outdoors. And achieving a full-color display with conventional reflective displays was difficult. Sharp's Super Mobile LCD, however, didn't need a backlight and was perfect for outdoor use. In fact, the brighter the ambient light, the easier it was to see. With about one seventh the power consumption, one third the thickness, and about one half the weight of previous displays, it was the ideal LCD for mobile equipment.\n\nSuperheated Steam Oven <AX-HC1>\n\nSharp's innovative AX-HC1 Superheated Steam Oven used a newly developed superheated steam generator to \"roast\" foods with water. By spraying food with superheated steam*1 at a temperature of 300℃, the oven delivered approximately eight times more heat content*2 than convection ovens. This cooked food such as meat and fried foods while dramatically reducing excessive fat and salt.This Superheated Steam Oven made possible a whole new level of healthy cooking, allowing low-calorie cooking that reduced fat in fried foods, low-salt cooking that reduced salt in foods such as salted fish, and low-oxygen cooking that limited the loss of nutrients such as vitamin C due to oxidization. The Superheated Steam Oven won over countless consumers looking for a healthy way to cook.\n\nLED Lamp <DL-L60AV>\n\nSharp released the DL-L60AV LED lamp featuring a remote controller for changing the color of the light, an industry first*. Users could select their preferred shade of white according to the weather, season of the year, or time of day; for example, warm white during the winter or at dinnertime when a relaxing atmosphere is desired, or a crisp cooler daylight white during the summer or in the morning for a refreshing wake-up. And combining this with the dimmer function, users could adjust lighting to the color and brightness they desired with one remote controller.\n\nICC PURIOS\n\nThe ICC Purios employs ICC (Integrated Cognitive Creation)*1, a “visual creation” technology from I3 (I-cubed) Research Center Inc.*2, and a 4K panel with 8.29 million pixels (3,840 x 2,160), four times*3 that of full HD. This LCD TV also has panel control technology for fine-tuning of brightness.\n\nThese features combine to give scenery images a realistic perspective and objects a 3D feel, making viewers almost feel like they are part of the on-screen world. They also result in meticulous reproduction of images with a consistent brightness exceeding that of standards for commercial master monitors used at TV stations and in other professional settings.\n\nThe ICC Purios was the world’s first TV certified for the THX 4K Display standard*4 stipulated by THX Ltd.*4. It’s a premium model for consumers who demand an authentic home theater experience and images second to none.\n\nMicrobe Sensor\n\nSharp developed a microbe sensor that can automatically measure the amount of airborne microbes, such as bacteria and mold spores, in as little as 10 minutes*1.\n\nThe sensor takes in air from the measuring area and extracts the microbes that need to be detected. Using Sharp’s proprietary version of the fluorescent detection method*2, it automatically measures the amount of microbes in as little as 10 minutes. The microbe sensor can be linked to a computer to conduct continuous measuring, making it possible to monitor changes in microbe counts over time*3.\n\nHealsio Ocha-Presso Tea Machine\n\nSharp released the Healsio Ocha-Presso tea machine, which makes green tea without altering*1 the nutrient*2 content of tea leaves such as catechin*3 and fiber. It represents a whole new way to make and enjoy green tea.\n\nThe product’s small ceramic tea mortar mills the tea leaves into a fine powder, doing it slowly in order to reduce friction heat and thus avoiding the destruction of the nutrients in the leaves. While in conventional tea brewing the leaves end up as leftover tea grounds, the leaves themselves are ground into a fine powder with Sharp’s Ocha-Presso. The result is green tea that not only has approximately 1.9 times*4 the amount of catechin but is also high in nutrients such as fiber and chlorophyll*5, something rarely found in tea-pot-made green tea. The milled tea leaves are stirred with a rotary blade—like as with a bamboo whisk—inside the machine, then mixed evenly with hot water to give the flavor of authentic, hand-made green tea.\n\nUD20 Series AQUOS 4K TV\n\nSharp released the UD20 series of 4K-compatible LCD TVs, which give consumers powerful, life-like images and allow viewing in original resolution of 4K trial broadcasts*1, an industry first*2, and 4K Internet streaming videos.\n\nTo watch 4K trial broadcasts (4K 60p), a TV needs to comply with the HDMI 2.0 standard (4K 60p) for digital image transmission, be compatible with the HDCP 2.2 copy protection standard, and have a tuner capable of receiving 4K trial broadcasts. In addition to satisfying both these standards, the UD20 can be combined with the AQUOS 4K recorder (released simultaneously), the first 4K recorder in the industry*2 capable of receiving 4K trial broadcasts and thus allowing home users enjoyment of these broadcasts. As well, the UD20 series is the industry’s first*2 TV to come with an HEVC decoder*3 compatible with Hikari TV 4K video on demand, a service presented since October 27, 2014 by NTT Plala Inc., enabling users to enjoy 4K broadcasts with just this TV.\n\nSharp’s 4K low-reflection panel reduces on-screen reflection of ambient light and provides rich, deep blacks, while Sharp’s Rich Color Technology expands the color gamut by 12% compared to a previous models*4, thus providing high-resolution, highly detailed 4K images in brilliant colors.\n\nAs for sound quality, the UD20 series comes with a newly developed sound bar, which is detached and independent of the display. With the left and right rounded dual mid-range speakers and tweeters placed facing frontwards, users get high output and balanced sound. At the rear of the display is a DuoBass low-vibration subwoofer, which increases the realistic audio experience of the 2.1-channel, three-way, eight-speaker system.\n\nTU-UD1000 AQUOS 4K Recorder\n\nSharp’s TU-UD1000 AQUOS 4K recorder can receive, record, and play back 4K trial broadcasts*1 (4K 60p) in their original resolution, an industry first*2.\n\nIn June 2014 in Japan, the NexTV-F (Next Generation Television & Broadcasting Promotion Forum) began broadcasting 4K trial broadcasts on 124/128° CS digital broadcasting, but to watch these broadcasts users require a compatible HEVC decoder*3 and a tuner for SKY PerfecTV’s Premium Service.\n\nThe TU-UD1000 has an HEVC decoder and a tuner for SKY PerfecTV’s Premium Service, allowing users to receive 4K trial broadcasts in their original resolution. By combining this product with a 4K-compatible AQUOS TV*4, users can enjoy high-resolution 4K entertainment.\n\nThe TU-UD1000 has a 1TB hard disk for storage of approximately 53 hours*5 of 4K broadcasts in DR mode. It is also compatible with the HDMI 2.0 standard (4K 60p) for digital image transmission and the HDCP 2.2 copy protection standard, which means that users can play back the 4K trial broadcast images (in 4K 60p) in their original 4K resolution.\n\nCloud Storage Battery System\n\nThe JH-WB1401 and JH-WB1402*1 cloud battery storage systems combine with Sharp’s cloud HEMS*2 to realize efficient energy management by adapting to changes in the usage environment.\n\nWith this new energy solution from Sharp, the system predicts how much power will be generated based on the next day’s weather forecast and analyzes the user’s daily power usage situation, in the process automatically controlling battery charging and power supply in the most optimal way and reducing electricity bills.\n\nThe cloud storage battery comes in two types: one for installation indoors for cold regions*3, and another for outdoor installation. It is also much more compact than Sharp’s previous storage battery*4. And while Sharp’s previous product required two power conditioners—one for the solar power generation system and one for the storage battery system—the JH-WB1401 and JH-WB1402 require only one power conditioner, allowing for efficient charging.\n\nEmopa-Equipped Smartphones\n\nSharp released smartphones equipped with Emopa, a newly developed function that, for example, gives the user audio and text messages, and changes the screen, depending on the time, place, and user's personal needs. The smartphones have been released in models for three major Japanese mobile phone carriers*. The word \"Emopa\" stands for \"emotional partner.\" The technology incorporated into Sharp's newly released smartphones is based on the Cocoro Engine artificial intelligence used in Sharp's health and environment appliances. Adapting to a range of situations, Emopa knows what the user needs to hear as it gives suggestions regarding what to do next, in the process offering both friendship and comfort. For example, when the user is about to leave home, Emopa's voice will say \"Don't forget your umbrella\" if the weather forecast calls for rain. Such well-timed messages give the phone a heart and soul and make possible a whole new world of communications between people and their smartphones.\n\nCeiling-Installed Plasmacluster Ion Generator\n\nSharp released the IG-GTA20 ceiling-installed*1 Plasmacluster Ion generator, which includes an LED light and deodorizes and eliminates*2 odor-causing bacteria adhering to the floor and other places in the bathroom.\n\nThe Plasmacluster Ion generator draws its power by attaching into a standard-sized E26 cap shape light socket. This means that deodorizing and eliminating odor-causing bacteria from the bathroom, one of the most worrisome rooms in the house for unpleasant odors, is as easy as screwing in a light bulb. It also means it fits inconspicuously into bathrooms that have no extra wall outlets or extra space for installing Plasmacluster Ion generators.\n\nA motion sensor turns on and off the generator's LED light when someone enters and leaves the bathroom. When the bathroom is empty, the light is turned off and Plasmacluster Ions are generated in maximum mode. And when someone enters the bathroom, the light goes on again and the generator automatically returns to standard mode with a lighter airflow. So there's no need to worry about forgetting to turn off the bathroom light, and users get round-the-clock deodorizing for an electricity cost of approximately 1.8 yen*3 per day.\n\nCornet Cyclonic Vacuum Cleaner for Bedding\n\nSharp released the EC-HX100 Cornet cyclonic vacuum cleaner for bedding, the first vacuum cleaner in the industry*1 to employ a heat cyclone that takes advantage of mites'*2 weakness against heat by blowing warm air onto bedding to loosen mites' grip from the fibers of bedding and then powerfully sucking them up.\n\nThe Cornet removes*3*4 mites and related allergens (mite feces and mite carcasses) from bedding by using a powerful beating brush, along with heat generated by the motor that is blown as warm air onto the bedding to loosen the mites' grip from the fibers so that they can be sucked up by the powerful vacuum force. The warm air comes from the vacuum cleaner's internal motor to save on electricity consumption. There is also a function to prevent the air temperature from getting too high and damaging the bedding.\n\nMore than 99% of the mites sucked up are killed*5 by the high-speed swirling air movement of the centrifugal separation cyclone motor. Cleaning of the dust cup and filter is easy: just remove them and wash them with water. In addition, the warm air and Plasmacluster Ions deodorize*6 pillows and other bedding, while the warm air also fluffs up the bedding to a comfortable softness.\n\nAQUOS 4K Next 4K LCD TV\n\nSharp released the AQUOS 4K Next 4K LCD TV, with a 4K LCD panel employing Sharp's proprietary 4-color*1 technology for combining red, green, blue, and yellow sub-pixels to enable 8K-equivalent resolution*2, as well as the world's first*3 8K upscaling circuit for rendering 8K images.\n\nThe AQUOS 4K Next delivers beauty down to the most minute details thanks to the 8K upscaling circuit embedded into the X8-Master Engine Pro. This works in unison with Sharp's Rich Color technology, consisting of an LED backlight system employing a new fluorescent material and a color restoration circuit, to achieve approximately 1.4 times the color reproduction range of previous Sharp TVs*4. The AQUOS 4K Next includes Megacontrast dynamic range expansion technology, which boosts the ability to express light and dark shades by simultaneously controlling the LCD openings and the brightness of each area of the backlight using a proprietary algorithm that detects and restores the brilliance of the light source and the shine reflecting off the light source of the image. Through Sharp's proprietary low-reflective N-Black Panel, and other high-image-quality technologies that enable superb detail, a rich color gamut, and high contrast, the AQUOS 4K Next literally puts television viewers inside the onscreen action.\n\nDigital Cordless Facsimiles and Phones with Functions for Helping Prevent Bank Transfer Swindling\n\nSharp released two models of digital cordless facsimiles, the UX-AF90CL and UX-AF90CW, and two models of digital cordless phones, the JD-AT80CL and JD-AT80CW, which have functions for helping prevent bank transfer swindling (in which callers trick people into depositing money into a bank account).\n\nThere are seven functions useful in preventing bank transfer swindling over the phone. These include functions that warn users about incoming calls before they answer. With one function, for incoming calls from numbers not registered in the main phone unit's database, the phone automatically switches to a voice message asking the caller to give his or her name. The user will also be notified of incoming calls from unregistered numbers with a flashing red LED lamp*1.\n\nAn automatic call recording function*2 records an entire phone conversation after giving a warning message that it is about to do so. These facsimiles and phones are also easy to use, thanks to features like a large LED screen and a button for increasing receiver volume so callers are easy to hear.\n\nSharp also released two models of digital cordless facsimiles, the UX-AF91CL and UX-AF91CW, which have the industry's first*3 function for filtering incoming calls by automatically discriminating calls and blocking ones that are suspicious.\n\nKN-HT99A Healsio Hot Cook\n\nThe KN-HT99A Healsio Hot Cook electric waterless cooker was the industryâs first*1 such product to cook without a flame and without water to enable healthy, easy-to-make waterless cooking. Through waterless cooking, in which the abundance of water naturally occurring in ingredients such as vegetables is trapped inside the cooker, the Healsio Hot Cook retains most of the nutrients, minerals, and other substances in the food that have antioxidant effects, such as vitamin C and folic acid, and gives users the great natural taste of the food ingredients.\n\nThanks to the built-in stirring unit that stirs the dish at the ideal timing, and sensors that detect temperature and steam levels and adjust the heat accordingly, the Healsio Hot Cook relieves the user from having to constantly stir the food and adjust the cooking heat. Users can select from among 85 pre-set simmered and other dishes, put in the ingredients, and then are free to do something else while the Healsio Hot Cook automatically makes the dish according to the ingredient amounts and heating needs. Itâs easy to make curries or stews and other simmered dishes that are hard to get just the right flavor or that need to be stirred to avoid charring.\n\nWith the ready-to-eat timer function*2, users simply put in all the ingredients and set the timer (set time*3) to what time they want to eat. The temperature is automatically adjusted, with consideration for health and food safety, to what is ideal until the dish is ready to eat.\n\nMosquito-Catching Plasmacluster Air Purifier\n\nSharp released the FU-GK50, a Plasmacluster air purifier that can catch mosquitos. A world-first*1, the FU-GK50 makes use of its suction force and mosquitosâ behavior to catch those annoying insects with a sticky sheet instead of chemicals.\n\nThe FU-GK50 creates an environment attractive to mosquitos: it emits 360-nm UV light, and the main unit is black and has small openings that the bugs can enter. The approaching mosquitos are sucked in by the flow of air during air purification and get stuck on the sticky sheet.\n\nBecause it uses no chemicals, the FU-GK50 has been lauded for bringing peace of mind to households with infants, the elderly, and pets.\n\nThe FU-GK50 also offers advanced air purification. Its Speedy Circulating Airflow draws in faraway dust and its three filters (including an Electrostatic HEPA Filter*2) effectively collect dust and deodorize.\n\nRoBoHoN Mobile Robotic Phone\n\nRoBoHoN is a world-first*1âa small, easily portable robot-shaped phone.\n\nIt was developed in collaboration with Tomotaka Takahashi, Project Associate Professor at the University of Tokyoâs Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology and CEO of robot development company Robo Garage Co., Ltd. This humanoid robot can walk on two legs and is compact enough (approx. 19.5 cm tall) to be carried almost anywhere.\n\nRoBoHoN has all the basic mobile phone functionsâphone, e-mail, cameraâas well as a built-in projector*2 for projecting photos or videos onto a screen or wall. Users can also download dedicated apps to give RoBoHoN new functions.\n\nNot only can RoBoHoN communicate through dialogue and gestures, but it can also make body movements like standing up, walking, and dancing. Such features have made RoBoHoN a hitâa âpartnerâ that you can feel attached to.\n\nRoBoHoN has garnered some high-profile attention, such as through its exhibit at the G7 Ise-Shima Summit in 2016. Itâs also seeing increasingly widespread use; for example, commercial applications such as providing multilingual services for tourists.\n\nUltrasonic Washer\n\nSharp released the UW-A1 ultrasonic washer, which quickly and effectively removes stains*1 on clothes and other fabric products. Using ultrasonic vibrations of 38,000 times per second, the UW-A1 gets rid of stains that are otherwise hard to remove by hand or with a washing machine.\n\nUltrasonic vibrations of 38,000 times per second generate vacuum bubbles between the water-soaked fibers. When these bubbles burst, they generate a powerful force that flicks away the dirt. The UW-A1 can easily remove grime from collars and sleeves, cosmetics such as foundation and lipstick, and food stains. Because the UW-AI cleans with the power of bursting bubbles, it is gentle and thus minimizes damage to fabrics*2.\n\nThe UW-AI is cordless, rechargeable, compact, and weighs only 200 grams*3. This means you can take it outside the laundry room and use it to remove stains on the go.\n\nHealsio Griller Superheated Steam Oven\n\nSharp released the AX-H1 Healsio Griller superheated steam oven, which uses the same superheated steam as Sharpâs other Healsio ovens for healthy, delicious cooking. The compact AX-H1 is exclusively for superheated steam cooking and can quickly make fried or roasted dishes, or reheat them*1.\n\nFor breakfast, the AX-H1 toasts bread to delicious perfection. You can also prepare a breakfast specialâtoast, bacon, and sunny-side-up eggsâusing the ovenâs ability to cook different ingredients at the same time.\n\nFor dinner, heating frozen foods or reheating ready-to-eat dishes restores their just-cooked deliciousness by reducing excessive oil. The AX-H1 can also make âfriedâ foods without actually using frying oil, as well as grilled seasonal vegetables that allow you to savor the flavors of the season.\n\nAGEs Sensor\n\nSimply insert your finger to have the RQ-AG01J measure your bodyâs accumulation of AGEs (advanced glycation end-products). AGEs contribute to aging*1.\n\nNo blood samples are required. Simply put the tip of your middle finger into the device, and after 30 to 60 seconds, the RQ-AG01J will measure the amount of accumulated AGEs. Certain types of AGEs have autofluorescence (the natural emission of light after having absorbed light). Taking advantage of this characteristic, the RQ-AG01J applies near-UV light to the finger and calculates the accumulation level of AGEs by measuring and analyzing the amount of light emitted by the AGEs in the fingerâs veins.\n\nThe results are displayed on a five-point scale from A to E. It also shows the userâs rank (1st to 100th place) when compared to people of the same age group*2. The included printer can be used to print out the results.\n\nRACTIVE Air Cordless Canister Vacuum Cleaner\n\nSharp released RACTIVE Air, a cordless canister vacuum cleaner weighing a total of 2.9 kg, the worldâs lightest*1 for a cleaner with a motorized power brush. Sharp made this possible by making the main unit lighter and using lightweight material for the wand.\n\nThe wand is made of dry carbon (a type of CFRP), a strong, lightweight material that is also used in aircraft. By significantly reducing the strain on the hand, it is easier to clean thresholds, steps, and narrow spaces. Stairways are particularly hard to clean, but with RACTIVE Air, the strain placed on the arm is reduced by up to 20%*2 compared to Sharpâs previous model (cordless stick vacuum cleaner). And thanks to a smaller and lighter main unit motor and electronic circuits, the main unitâs weight*3 is just 1.8 kg. The cleaner is easily portable over thresholds, steps, and stairways.\n\nA powerful turbo fan, high-efficiency lithium-ion battery, and compact motorized power head give this cleaner the same suction power as on corded canister vacuum cleaners*4.\n\nThe RACTIVE Air lineup includes a bagged type for easy dust removal and a bagless cyclonic type that maintains suction power even when the canister is filled with dirt.\n\nLC-70X500 AQUOS 8K 70-Inch 8K-Compatible LCD TV\n\nEquipped with a high-definition, high-image-quality LCD panel, the LC-70X500 is one of the AQUOS 8K Series of 8K-compatible TVs.\n\nThe TV aims for the ultimate in realistic imagesâeven greater than those expressed in 4K resolution. With a resolution 16 times that of full HD, the 8K LCD panel reproduces images with ultra-fine detail beyond that visible to the naked eye. Add technologies for wide color gamut and high brightness that Sharp has nurtured over the years in its AQUOS TVs, and viewers can experience images like never before.\n\nThe LC-70X500 can upconvert existing full-HD or 4K images from digital broadcasts (terrestrial and BS/110Â° CS satellite) into 8K images. Rich Color Technology Pro (wide-color-gamut technology) and MEGA Contrast* (dynamic range expansion technology for reproducing image brilliance) also enable viewers to watch current TV content in even higher quality.\n\nConnecting the optionally available 8K broadcast receiver lets you watch 8K broadcasts, which started in Japan on December 1, 2018, in outstanding 8K quality.\n\n8C-B60A 8K Professional Camcorder\n\nSharp released the 8C-B60A professional-use 8K camcorder, the worldâs first*1 camcorder integrating capabilities*2 for shooting, recording, playback, and line output of 8K (60p*3) video. This all-in-one camera/recorder unit was developed with technical cooperation from Astrodesign, Inc.\n\nBesides the ability to shoot images in high-resolution 8K (60p), this camcorder is designed to offer ease of use in shooting and recording and to lessen the burden on the camera operator in the post-recording editing process. The 8C-B60Aâs image pickup device is a large, Super 35-mm-equivalent CMOS image sensor with 33 million pixels. Compression utilizes a coding method*4 that exerts minimal burden on the CPU, thus enabling efficient 8K (60p)-image editing and approximately 40 minutes of continuous recording (when using the bundled 2TB SSD pack).\n\nBecause it allows real-time output of 8K (60p) uncompressed images at the same time that recording is taking place, the 8C-B60A can be used for live transmissions as well.\n\nfunband Wearable Device\n\nfunband is a wristwatch-type wearable device for fans of Japanese professional baseball. In addition to live scores, it delivers*1 the latest news on your favorite team and players.\n\nfunband uses Bluetooth® to connect to the cloud via a smartphone.

Wherever you are watchingâat the ball park or elsewhereâyou can share with other fans the excitement of rooting for your favorite team.\n\nIn 2017, Sharp released models for each team of the two Japanese professional baseball leagues. Not only does funband bring new excitement to baseball, but it can also be used as a regular wristwatch.\n\nAQUOS R2 Smartphone\n\nSharp released the AQUOS R2, the worldâs first smartphone*1 to have two camerasâone for shooting videos and the other for taking photosâon the back*2. This unique configuration allows you to take videos and photos at the same time. The R2 was sold via carriers NTT Docomo, SoftBank, and KDDI in Japan.\n\nThe R2âs video camera (called Dramatic Wide Camera) has an ultra-wide-angle lens boasting a 135-degree*3 field of view, while the photo camera has 22.6 megapixels. By optimizing image stabilization and focus for each camera, the R2 can take exciting in-focus video (even when the object moves) and clear, vivid photosâsimultaneously.\n\nWhile shooting video, the R2âs artificial intelligence analyzes the object and the shot composition. It can automatically take photos of memorable scenesâsuch as the moment a baby smiles or a pet looks into the cameraâwhile shooting video. The R2 lets users experience a new way of taking imagesâshooting immersive videos and high-resolution photos with a single unit.\n\nWhatâs more, the R2 has a large, 6.0-inch WQHD+ (3040 x 1440 pixels) high-speed IGZO LCD*4. It also featuresâfor the first time in a smartphone*5âDolby VisionTMand Dolby Atmos®, letting you enjoy powerful sound along with super-realistic images.\n\nPet Care Monitor Cat Litter Tray\n\nSharp developed the HN-PC001 Pet Care Monitor, a cat litter tray that automatically measures the petâs urine volume and frequency, the petâs weight, and other factors, and records and analyzes them on the cloud*1*2. These reports are then sent to the ownerâs smartphone*3 so that they can keep track of their petâs health. The launch of this product marked Sharpâs entry into the pet business.\n\nThe measurement data saved to the cloud is analyzed via Sharpâs own abnormality detection algorithm (AI)*4. If any abnormalities are detected, such as too much or too little urine, too much time spent in the litter tray, and so forth, the HN-PC001 will send a notice to the ownerâs smartphone.\n\nCats tend to refrain from using the litter tray if its immediate surroundings are too chilly. The HN-PC001 can solve this problem by measuring the temperature around the litter tray, thus helping to maintain a comfortable environment.\n\nAQUOS Products for New 4K Satellite Broadcasts\n\n4S-C00AS1 4K Tunerï¼ AQUOS 4K Recorderï¼ AQUOS 4K AIoT-Ready LCD TV\n\nSharp released the 4S-C00AS1 4K tuner and AQUOS 4K recorder, which enable viewing*1 and recording of new 4K satellite broadcasts*2, and the AQUOS 4K AIoT-ready LCD TV.

In 2019, it expanded the lineup with the SR-03M-Y (LTE/3G model) and the SR-04M-Y (Wi-Fi model), which are capable of walking, and the sitting SR-05M-Y RoBoHoN Lite (Wi-Fi model).\n\nA security application allows RoBoHoN to watch the home while the user is out, detecting and photographing people entering the house and then emailing the photos to the user. This comes in handy for parents who want to know if their children have come home from school. The eRemote Mini IoT remote controller (sold separately) allows the RoBoHoN to respond to voice commands to, for example, operate things like TV and lighting.\n\nCorporate users get functions like facilities guide and guest welcoming. By sensing when people approach, RoBoHoN can, for example, explain items in a store, showroom, or museum, and welcome guests at a company reception desk. And it can speak Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nAlso new to the lineup is the SR-05ME-Y RoBoHoN Lite HEMS (Wi-Fi model), which takes voice commands to do things like check the power generation capacity of solar power systems and operate appliances.\n\nThe expanded RoBoHoN lineup allows the product to be used beyond the home to include corporate customers like hotels and English language schools.\n\nEC-SR3SX-P/-S and EC-SR3S-P RACTIVE Air Power Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaners\n\nThe RACTIVE Air Power cyclonic cordless vacuum cleaners have the power and charge-life to thoroughly clean an entire home. The cordless, stick form marks a new product category that eases vacuuming for users.\n\nThese vacuum cleaners have a large-capacity, high-voltage 25.2 V rechargeable lithium-ion battery and a high-blowing, high-pressure 3D fan motor, along with an optimal construction and air intake/exhaust path, which combine to give greater suction power than previous Sharp products. When using the full-power mode to clean hard-to-remove dirt in just five seconds, it is 1.5 times*1 more powerful than previous models, the highest ever for Sharp cordless stick-type products.\n\nThe removable large-capacity, high-voltage battery runs for 60 minutes*2 on one charge and charges fully in just 80 minutes*3. The EC-SR3SX premium model comes with two batteries, which can be switched so that users get up to 120 minutes*4 of operation on low-power mode, two times that of Sharpâs previous models (which gave maximum 60 minutes on auto mode and 24 minutes on high-power mode).\n\nThe vacuum cleanersâ wand is made of aluminum and has an oval cross section, making it just one-quarter the thickness*5 and significantly lighter than Sharpâs previous models using a plastic wand. The strong yet light body has a standard weight of just 1.9 kg.\n\nNow with a stronger free-running assist function, the new models lessen the burden on the user by approximately 30%*6 compared to Sharpâs previous standard-weight 1.5-kg models.\n\nLessbea® Beacon Powered by Dye-sensitized Solar Cell\n\nSharpâs Lessbea® beacon is powered by a dye-sensitized solar cell that has been certified*1 as having the worldâs highest power generation efficiency under the outdoor evaluation standard (AM1.5) in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells. It can therefore give off stable signals at an interval of one per second even in dark spaces of about 50 lx*2, such as under indoor emergency lighting. This gives it top-class performance*3 among solar-powered beacons.\n\nMost conventional beacons use primary batteries as a power source, and must be installed in a high place, at least two meters above ground, to avoid radio wave attenuation. This means significant maintenance costs due to periodic battery changes and the extra work necessitated by their high location. Sharpâs Lessbea® solves both these problems. Providing both high performance and a compact size measuring just 74 mm (W) x 7 mm (H) (at its thickest) x 134 mm (D), the Lessbea® boasts a subtle design and no visible screws, thus making it a good match for installation in office environments.\n\nTEKION COOLER bag\n\nSharpâs TEKION COOLER bag uses Sharpâs unique and advanced cold-retention material to keep drinks at a cool, refreshing temperature of â2Â°C. The bag uses chloroprene rubber, a light, easy-to-fold material used for wetsuits. Even subzero drinks put inside wonât cause condensation, so users can take it anywhere and place it on a table, without worry of water droplets forming on the surface.\n\nTThe bagâs cold-retention material comes from Sharpâs years of research in LCD materials. It can be designed to melt*1 at a specific temperature in the â24Â°C to +28Â°C range*2. Users can enjoy all kinds of food and drink in the most satisfying temperature range for consumption.\n\nTo bring this cold-retention material to market, in March 2017 Sharp formed an in-house venture business called TEKION LAB. Tekion means âideal temperatureâ in Japanese. Through the Makuake crowd-funding service, Sharp tied up with a sake brewery and conducted marketing stressing this new way to enjoy subzero alcoholic beverages. The TEKION COOLER bag marked the full-scale launch of TEKION products under the Sharp brand. Sharp is teaming up with companies in other industries to expand TEKION products using cold-retention material into the fields of sports, beauty, medicine, and logistics, among others.\n\n30-inch 4K Flexible OLED Display\n\nSharp and Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) co-developed a 30-inch 4K flexible organic LED (OLED) display.\n\nThe OLED display, with light-emitting elements formed onto each of the RGB subpixels (RGB light emission method) of a 30-inch-diagonal (approximately 76 cm) flexible film substrate, is the largest display of its kind in the world*1.\n\nThe light-emitting elements are formed with ultra-high precision onto each of the RGB subpixels using the vapor deposition method. This renders a color filter unnecessary and gives high light-use efficiency. The use of a film substrate means the display part of the panel is approximately 0.5-mm thick, and this allows the display to be rolled into a cylinder approximately 2 cm in radius that fits neatly in a storage case.\n\nThe display employs IGZO*2 thin film transistors (TFTs) to drive the OLED elements. NHKâs proprietary signal-processing technologies and panel drive technology were used in order to improve brightness uniformity and the sharpness of moving objects. The 30-inch 4K flexible OLED display has garnered attention at events like Inter BEE 2019 and CES 2020.\n\nAY-L40/28/25/22P Airest Plasmacluster Air Conditioners\n\nSharpâs newest Plasmacluster air conditioner series, Airest, employs four continuous blowers that give it the strong air-dust-removal power of an air purifier. Its new construction has a dust-collecting and odor-removing filter at the air intake. These features have given the Airest the industryâs top air-purifying function*1 and made the series the only air conditioners to have met air cleaning standards stipulated by the Japanese air purifier industry.\n\nThe dust-collecting filter removes dust and bacteria, the causes of mold growth, and keep the air conditionerâs inside clean. In addition, the built-in Plasmacluster Next ion generator is effective against odors and mold that the filter cannot remove. The result is an ideal air environment for users.\n\nThe Airest products are controlled by cloud-based AI that makes use of weather forecasts in order to maintain maximum room comfort around the clock. Sharpâs proprietary*2 long-panel airflow control sends air evenly and comfortably throughout the entire room.\n\nAQUOS R5G Smartphone\n\nThe AQUOS R5G smartphone is the first AQUOS smartphone compatible with the 5th-generation mobile communication system (5G) and also the first smartphone with an 8K wide camera. Making the most of 5Gâs high speed and large capacity, the smartphone downloads large video data such as movies in just seconds, and quickly uploads videos taken with the built-in camera.\n\nWith the 8K wide camera, users can take life-like stills and videos at ultra-detailed 8K resolution (7,680 x 4,320) and with a wide field of view, great for large group shots where even individual faces are clear and recognizable. Proprietary Sharp AI enables the focus playback function, which automatically recognizes faces of people and pets (dogs, cats, etc.) in a video, and zooms in and plays them back.\n\nThe approximately 6.5-inch Pro IGZO LCD can display a billion colors, allowing for faithful reproduction ranging from skin texture to gradations of a blue sky, as well as making stills and videos easier to look at even under bright sunlight. It also combines high visibility and low power consumption. And with a high-performance CPU and high-speed, large-capacity memory, the R5G offers approximately 25% better CPU performance over Sharpâs previous model (AQUOS R3 released in fiscal 2019).\n\nMA-1050 Non-woven Mask\n\nThese masks are manufactured in the clean rooms at Sharpâs Mie Plant, where dust and other airborne particles are almost non-existent. The highly sanitary masks use a 99%* Cut Filter that prevents PM2.5 and pollen from getting in and virus droplets and particulates from getting in and out.\n\nConsideration was also put into the shape of the mask, with a nose fitter that can match the line of the wearerâs nose, thus reducing the open space between the mask and the face and limiting the amount of virus droplets and particulates getting in. Wide, soft ear straps ensure minimal burden on the ears even when wearing the mask for extended periods.\n\nIn February 2020, when masks were in extremely short supply in Japan, Sharp answered a call for help from the Japanese government and began production in March 2020. Mask sales to the general public began on April 28 via a lottery system on Sharpâs COCORO STORE e-commerce website. The first round of the online sales lottery saw the numbers of people applying to purchase masks exceed Sharpâ planned sales volume.\n\nIn September 2020, Sharp added the MA-1050S, smaller masks for women and upper grade elementary school students. The company also gradually increased production capacity and in November cumulative production reached 100 million masks. Sharp has since then been coming up with new ways to bring high-quality made-in-Japan masks to more people. For example, in December 2020 Sharp launched its MA-R230 and MA-R230S periodic mask delivery service for shipping masks to customers at regular intervals.\n\n12Â°C Tekion Cold-retention Material\n\nUsing technology built up through research into LCD materials, Sharp developed 12Â°C Tekion cold-retention material for use in shipping fresh produce. Palsystem Consumersâ Co-operative Union, Tanix, and Sharp collaborated to build a new shipping system using Tekion cold-retention material, the first such product in the industry*1 made especially for fresh produce. Besides maintaining the quality of fresh produce shipped directly from producing regions, the system also dramatically reduces power consumption, solves labor shortage problems, and helps reform the way people work.\n\nIn conventional shipping, 0Â°C cold-retention material can cause low-temperature damage to the fresh produce, so buffer material must be placed between the produce and the cold-retention material to prevent quality deterioration. With 12Â°C Tekion cold-retention material, low-temperature damage is prevented and time and labor are saved since no buffer material needs to be inserted.\n\nAnd by using 12Â°C Tekion cold-retention material, with its high melting point, users save about 40% annually on electricity needed to keep cold-retention materials at freezing. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of about 950 average households*2, and converts to a reduction in CO2 emissions of about 2,000 metric tons. In addition, while fresh produce has traditionally been sorted at night, it can now start the morning of the day it arrives, thus helping solve the problem of labor shortages and leading to reformed work patterns.\n\nFull-fledged application of 12Â°C Tekion cold-retention material to commercial business is not limited to shipping fresh produce. It is also being used as a product for end consumers. Descente Ltd. has released the Core Cooler*3, a glove employing Tekion cold-retention material to keep users cool during exercise on hot days.\n\n8M-B120C 120-inch 8K Display\n\nThe 8M-B120C 8K display is a commercial-use information display with a 120-inch-class 8K LCD panel, among the largest in the industry*. The 2,657.2-mm x 1,494.7-mm (W x H) large screen gives realistic reproduction of everything from the texture of materials to the depth of scenery.\n\nThe 8M-B120C employs imaging technologies developed for the AQUOS 8K TV, allowing full-high-definition and 4K-resolution images to be upconverted to 8K for clear, detailed images, and direct-lit LED local dimming technology for better display of lights and darks. It also comes with an HDMI 2.1 port for 8K content.\n\nThe 8M-B120C features the multi-screen input needed for commercial usage, so users can show several different kinds of content at once. Four PCs can be connected using a video cable and their images shown on a four-part split screen on the 8M-B120C. Each image can be relocated on the screen and even enlarged or shrunken in size.\n\nFace Shield, Eye Shield, Mouth Shield\n\nIn cooperation with Issei Oura, product designer and representative director of the NPO Mamoru wo Mamoru, Sharp has released a face shield, eye shield, and mouth shield to protect against airborne droplets. These high-performance products are made of a comfortable-to-wear and highly durable titanium frame*1 and a film utilizing special surface processing technology (Moth Eye technology) built up through Sharpâs LCD panel development.\n\nBoth sides of the clear film are specially processed (using Moth Eye technology) to cut surface reflection and thus dramatically reduce*2 glare. Besides preventing reflected sunlight and room lighting from obstructing the wearerâs view, the shields use a special newly developed acrylic resin that is effective in preventing mask fogging caused by high humidity or the userâs exhalations. The result is a consistently clear field of view.\n\nThe shields incorporate a light titanium frame made in Sabae, Japanâs most renowned eyeglass-manufacturing district, giving a shield that is comfortable to wear, even for long periods. The surface of the film is highly resistant to scratching, so each one has an exceptionally long service life.\n\n3Â°C Tekion Cold-retention Material\n\nUsing technology derived from our research into LCD materials, Sharp developed 3Â°C Tekion cold-retention material for use in shipping pharmaceuticals at cold temperatures. The cold-retention material is used in a constant-temperature transport container set developed in collaboration withâand sold byâSugiyama-Gen Co., Ltd. This innovation makes it more efficient to transport pharmaceuticals at a constant temperature.\n\nTransporting pharmaceuticals requires strict temperature control. Specimens, vaccines, and cells must be stored at temperatures between 2 and 8Â°C, while blood needs to stay within a range of 2 to 6Â°C. Sharpâs 3Â°C Tekion cold-retention material works for both temperature ranges.\n\nWhen using the constant-temperature transport container sets, thereâs no need to make seasonal cold-storage temperature settings or change the composition of cold-retention material packs. The unique features of the 3Â°C Tekion cold-retention material make such steps unnecessary.\n\nConventional constant-temperature transport containers require one to two hours of waiting time until their frozen cold-retention material reaches an appropriate temperature. Utilizing Sugiyama-Genâs know-how has made it possible to place 3Â°C Tekion cold-retention material inside the container right after the material has been taken out of the freezer. This eliminates any waiting time before packing, thereby boosting operational efficiency. The constant-temperature transport container set is the first such product in the industry* that can be used consistently throughout the year with zero waiting time.\n\nBased on the constant-temperature transport container sets, Sharp jointly developed a product specifically designed for transporting COVID-19 vaccines. The 3Â°C Tekion cold-retention material marked Sharpâs entry into the field of constant-temperature pharmaceutical transport.\n\nAQUOS R6 Smartphone\n\nSharp released the AQUOS R6 âco-engineered with Leicaâ smartphone as the first fruits of a collaboration with Leica Camera AG, a company that has been making camera history for over a century.\n\nSharp and Leica jointly developed the entire camera system. This included the design of the sensor and lens as well as image quality adjustments. The result is a 1-inch sensorâamong the worldâs largest for smartphones*1âand a Leica-branded Summicron 7-lens unit (f/1.9, focal length 19 mm).\n\nWith high sensitivity for effectively capturing light even in dark settings, the R6 can take distortion-free images across the range from wide angle to telephoto. And by incorporating computational photographyâa digital image-processing technologyâthe R6 can, with high sensitivity, shoot superb images with a wide dynamic range, day or night.\n\nThe display is a Pro IGZO OLED, the worldâs first*1 OLED display with a variable refresh rate of 1 Hz to 240 Hz*2. The display automatically switches refresh rates in real time to suit the content, achieving both superb energy efficiency and clear, smooth images with minimal image persistence.\n\nMH-L1-B Medical Listening Plug\n\nSharp released the MH-L1-B Medical Listening Plug, a wireless earphone-style hearing aid for users with light or moderate hearing loss. This grew from a collaboration with Neuroceuticals Inc., a medical device manufacturer and seller.\n\nCertified as a âcontrolled medical device,*1â the MH-L1-B offers all the functionality, quality, and safety of a standard hearing aid at an affordable price*2.\n\nThe Medical Listening Plug works with the Cocoro Listening*3 smartphone-based support service. Through this service, hearing aid professionals*4 provide consultations and after-sales assistance. From the comfort of their own homes, users can chat with support staff over video and get help with initial set-up and later fine-tuning of their devices.\n\nThe MH-L1-B allows users to make settings*5 to match common usage scenarios, such as online meetings, customer service, or commuting. It can also be used for listening to music in high quality, just like with wireless earbuds. A built-in microphone allows hands-free calls on a smartphone.\n\nWith a stylish design that matches any business setting, the MH-L1-B was launched as a new class of hearing aid that people would want to wear daily, just like eyeglasses or a wristwatch.\n\nMA-C20V1/C2015 Nonwoven Sharp Crystal Masks\n\nThe Sharp Crystal Mask has a three-dimensional form based on a hexagonal shape (dubbed 3D Crystal*). This design gives a more flattering profile to the face and ensures ample space around the mouth. This makes it easier to breathe and minimizes smudging of makeup and lipstick.\n\nHygiene-wise, the mask uses a four-layer nonwoven filter that blocks more than 99% of PM2.5, pollen, particulates, and virus-carrying droplets. The outermost nonwoven layer is impregnated with an inorganic antibacterial agent that inhibits the growth of bacteria on the mask surface through the action of silver ions (Ag+).\n\nSince March 2020, Sharp has been offering face masks manufactured in the clean rooms of its Mie Plant as one way to contribute to society. The MA-C20V1/C2015 masks were released as premium products to wide acclaim, combining style, comfort, and function.\n\nDX1/DP1 AQUOS XLED 8K/4K TV\n\nThe AQUOS XLED DX1/DP1 8K/4K TV was launched as a new brand under the AQUOS lineup. It employs newly developed mini LEDs for its backlight.\n\nThe 4T-C65DP1 has approximately 72 times the number of mini LEDs compared to previous models*1, in a highly concentrated array. Newly developed active mini-LED drive technology allows fine control of the darkness and brightness levels in each area of the screen. This technology has dramatically improved contrast and other display performance parameters.\n\nPeak brightness of the 4T-C65DP1 is roughly three times that of previous models*1. This allows viewers to enjoy dynamic images ranging from dazzling brights to sharp blacks. Newly adopted Quantum Dot*2 Rich Color technology converts the optical wavelength of the backlight to produce pure primary colors (red, blue, and green). This results in a wide color gamut and vivid color reproduction.\n\nOn the audio side, Sharp has revamped the speaker system. The newly developed ARSS+ (Around Speaker System Plus) audio system places speakers not only at the bottom of the screen, but also on the top and sides*3. This system creates an immersive sound field, putting viewers right in the middle of the action, where sound and images come alive as one.\n\nThe DX1 line features a âfloating displayâ design with an ultra-thin bezel of just 2 mm. With just 2 mm between the screen and the background, onscreen images appear to float in mid-air.\n\nTEKIjuN Humidity Control Material\n\nTEKIjuN is a world first*1, a humidity control material in solid form that adjusts airtight spaces to a desired humidity, and maintains them*2, by absorbing moisture when the air is humid and releasing moisture when it is dry. The balance of ingredients of TEKIjuN can be changed to allow it to achieve and maintain a target relative humidity of anywhere from 40% to 90%. Besides allowing maintenance of a humidity environment at a level ideal for stored items regardless of outside temperature, TEKIjuN comes in solid formâresin infused with liquid moisture control materialâto eliminate the risk of leakage and make it easy to handle. It also requires no power source.\n\nTEKIjuN comes in bead and sheet form. The beads are able to absorb and release large amounts of moisture and are effective over long periods. This makes them suitable for storing things like industrial and art items, luxury goods, and food. The sheets can rapidly absorb and release moisture and react to extreme fluctuations in humidity, making them ideal for use as anti-condensation material for electronic equipment, buildings, and logistics.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, Sharp released bead-type TEKIjuN for quality control of upright pianos and storage at research institutions.\n\nAN-SC1 AQUOS Sound Partner\n\nThe AN-SC1 AQUOS Sound Partner wearable AI speakers connect to Wi-Fi and allow the use of voice assistant features without the need to connect to a smartphone or other device. It uses the Amazon Alexa*1 cloud-based voice assistant from Amazon.com, Inc. Through interaction with the voice assistant, users can listen to news and music and search information from a range of locations*2, as well as use voice commands to operate appliances, lighting, and other voice-enabled devices*3.\n\nLike with previous Sound Partner models, the AN-SC1 can connect via Bluetooth to TVs, smartphones, and PCs for wireless enjoyment of, for example, audio from TVs and music from smartphones. Its built-in microphone allows it to be used for videoconferences over PCs.\n\nThe market release of the AN-SC1 is thanks to an autumn 2021 crowdfunding campaign on Green Funding, which raised more than nine times the target amount.\n\nLC-LH Indoor Photovoltaic Device\n\nSharp has developed the LC-LH indoor photovoltaic device, the result of a fusion of technologies for dye-sensitized solar cells*1 and liquid crystal displays. It boasts high conversion efficiency even in weak indoor light and can be mass-produced at significantly low cost and high quality using existing LCD production facilities and know-how.
