Percy the Small Engine is an anthropomorphised fictional green saddle tank engine who originated from The Railway Series. He has a 0-4-0 wheel arrangement and is the number 6 engine on the North Western Railway, the Fat Controller's railway on the Island of Sodor.[1]

Percy in The Railway Series[edit]

Percy would make his debut in the 1950 book Troublesome Engines, and would be the titular main character of the 1956 book Percy the Small Engine.[2] He was built by the Avonside Engine Company, although it is unknown which specific model he is based on nor who designed him.

In the story "Trouble in the Shed", the Fat Controller purchases and names Percy after three of his other engines, Henry, Gordon and James, go on strike and refuse to leave their sheds. He initially ran Thomas' branch line on the Ffarquhar Branch Line before transferring to being a station pilot at the big station.

Throughout the series, he is consistently known for pulling the nighttime mail train.
