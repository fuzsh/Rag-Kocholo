        "text": "Percy the Small Engine - Engines Evolved AU\n\nNote: I was not going for a “Railway Series”-esque design, nor did I even use RWS-references while drawing this interpretation of the character in mind. The overall intention was to make the character resemble a model that at least looks somewhat more convincing than the average toy.\n\n‪I bear in mind that Percy must look convincing to an extent, yet at the same time the design should not deviate too much from the traditional Percy-model.\n\nI personally find this character a tad adorable, with a certain edge of sorts; slightly hesitant, overworked, and perhaps a bit ignorant too. I made several of his features small and rounded, since I thought it’d give the impression of general “pudginess” on him.\n\nTitle(s): “Saddletank Toughie”, “Caterpillar Engine”, ”Little Messenger”\n\nHeight: 14 ft\n\nLength: 25 ft\n\nWeight: 45 tons\n\nTop Speed: 40mph\n\nAggression: Moderate\n\nSignature Ability: Enhanced Durability\n\nPercy is thought to be a strange hybrid between multiple classes of locomotive, though his overall shape made a greater resemblance to a Great Western Railway “Avonside” Saddletank-engine than virtually anything else. Sir Topham Hatt typically labels him as such when filing documents of his engines’ performances among the railway.\n\nHis first arrival to Sodor was nothing short of himself being filled to the brim with eagerness and attitude, a similar nature to Thomas at the time. Percy was quite quick to stand up to Gordon, Henry and James, who all saw him as nothing more than a nuisance during their first strike at Tidmouth’s yard. The tank engines fortunately volunteered with most of the shunting and branchline duties, whilst Edward was becoming increasingly exhausted during his teachings with them. Despite that the moods of the three would’ve easily clashed, it was mostly the younger engines’ optimism that kept their older mentor moving on.\n\nAlthough Percy’s primary jobs such as carrying freight and mail around the island seemed like fairly simple tasks, there were almost too many reported cases where he ends up caught in an accident... sometimes, sticky ones. It was so much to the point where it was easy to claim repeatedly that Percy was practically transforming the island’s safety-record into a “total embarrassment”.\n\nHis crew eventually went to Hatt’s office to discuss about the numerous incidents on the railway, although unaware that while their engine was resting in a shed at Knapford, along the underside of the roof was an eerie substance of sorts leaking out. The moment Percy spotted this, his usual cheerful mood swung from surprise to fear within seconds. Unable to keep himself away from the substance, he openly shouted for help just when the chemical spread throughout his frame and insides. It already became too late when his crew hurried to the sheds, for Percy now appeared as if he had been mentally-scarred.\n\nSymptoms didn’t take form until several days after the “shed-scare”. Percy was reportedly becoming more inclined towards picking fights with larger and/or older engines quite akin to an aggressive small dog, even some cases where he wouldn’t usually do it in the first place. His body noticeably felt harder to the touch, and his physical toughness was becoming more apparent when he had a close-call with a boulder and somehow ended up with very few signs of damage after facing the direct explosion of a nearby shed.\n\nPercy was generally considered a bit courageous on one side, yet incredibly klutzy on there. It was stated at least more than once that he shared a similar scatterbrained nature to Thomas in ways, often serving as a sidekick to him. He finds himself aware that his attitude and enthusiasm would likely not mesh too well with those who act the opposite. Despite that, Percy faces difficultly with reasoning, mostly because of his frequent reputation of challenging against those who would find his own words/ideas hard to take seriously. Railway accidents have been so common with Percy that he no longer acts frightened when caught into them, practically expecting himself to be the butt of jokes afterwards. He was later taught by Edward to be calmer and more considerate when engaged in a confrontation of any sort; however, Percy would end up occasionally hesitant when encountering someone or something actually preparing an assault on him — considering he didn’t often have to deal with experiences such as that. As a “last resort”-tactic, Percy would outright jump to his allies’ defense if he feels it’s right in a brutal situation."
