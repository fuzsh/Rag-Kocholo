        "text": "A (Somewhat) Formal Introduction\n\n\"Hello everybody! Welcome to the Island of Sodor!\"\n\nI guess it's about time I do something with this blog, which was originally created for a review of Paramount's Knuckles series back when it came out...which I never ended up doing. And what better way to kick it off than with my review of the source material of a licensed game for the recent 52 Game bonus challenge! The material in question? Thomas & Friends' first season, all the way from (October 9) 1984 to (January 8) 1985. This is something I've been really looking forward to and is a bit personal to me, having been a huge Thomas fan growing up (just take a look at my collection if you don't believe me!). With the bonus challenge coinciding with my recent watch through a YouTuber's ongoing retrospective of the entire series, I figured now would be a good time to revisit the show in full myself (well, the first season anyways). So, without beating around the bush further, here's my recent thoughts and take aways! Now, where to start...\n\nAdaptations, Morals, & Continuity?! Oh my!\n\n\"Once upon a time, an innocent engine was bricked alive in a tunnel and left there to die forever. The end.\" Yeah, no.\n\nBeing adaptions of the carefully crafted Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry, the writing is at the heart of it all and is arguably the most important aspect. So, I think it deserves to be spotlighted first. As for the stories of the episodes themselves, they are more or less straight forward adaptions of some of the earlier books, with a few changes. In this case, that's a good thing, as what we have here are stories with morals that aren't flat out told like most other little kid media, coupled with some interesting ideas for such a demographic. A bit of an infamous case would be the aforementioned \"The Sad Story of Henry / Come Out, Henry!\" episode. To recap, Henry stops in a tunnel while taking some passengers in order to protect his paint job, in fear of it getting wet by the ongoing rain. After the passengers attempt to pull and push him out, after Thomas does the same thing, and even after the rain stops (he's sure it'll start again soon), Sir Topham Hatt makes the ultimatum that Henry shall be bricked up in the tunnel until he's ready to come out. The lesson here could be interpreted as not letting your fears getting the better of you, or perhaps to not be selfish. There's also the irony of Henry's paint getting dirtied from being in the tunnel for so long. Of course, Henry getting bricked up in a tunnel is definitely overkill, but at the very least, it's something serious that you wouldn't expect from a little kids show. This is a show where the repercussions of your actions do matter.\n\n\"And me and Squidward are gonna stay on strike until we get what we deserve! Even if it takes forever!!!\"\n\nAnother good example in my opinion regarding morals and more complex topics is \"Trouble in the Shed.\" Here, the setup is that Gordon, James, and Henry are on strike, having grown tired of fetching their own coaches and feeling that it's below them. In response, The Fat Controller shuts them up in the sheds, and has Thomas, Edward, and newcomer Percy, take over the commute until the bigger engines give in. Workers going on strike is more of an adult topic and is presented to its audience as if they have some level of intelligence, corresponding with a theme that's again enveloped into the story and is left up for interpretation. Compare it to most other little kid shows that use simpler vocabulary and topics and spells out its morals word for word.\n\nI'd like to use the last two examples as leeway to the next subject I'd like to praise: continuity. Yes, you heard me right, there's continuity. I didn't believe it either. But now having seen every episode, in order, I can confirm it exists and makes watching them chronologically somewhat important. Each episode, for the most part, transitions into one another, and events that happen earlier on are brought up again later, usually with some effect. \"The Sad Story of Henry / Come Out, Henry!\" is a more pretty straightforward example, with the direct next episode having Henry be set free. This can be handwaved though as a typical two part-er. \"Trouble in the Shed\" is bit of a better example. Firstly, Gordon, James, and Henry had decided to go on strike in the previous episode, \"Tenders and Turntables\" with the meeting being held the night before. What led to them coming up with the reasoning for their decision was because several episodes prior, specifically in \"Thomas and the Breakdown Train,\" Thomas' rescue of James led to him getting his own branch line and coaches, leaving no one to fetch the bigger engines' coaches. In addition, aside from the feeling of superiority being the only reason, being bigger tender engines led to a couple of accidents on the turntable needed for them to go behind the coaches to push them into the station and then get in front to pull them. Said accidents can be seen in \"Tenders and Turntables.\" If that wasn't enough, I think an even better example can be found within the episode, \"Toby and the Stout Gentleman / Toby the Tram Engine,\" and its following episode, \"Thomas in Trouble / Thomas Breaks the Rules.\"\n\n\"Thomas had never seen such bullshit before.\"\n\nThe former introduces Toby to the show, and centers on his final days running his line. With trucks having taken most of the workload, and with the number of passengers decreasing day by day, his manager had decided to do away with him. One of the last passengers he has the honors of carrying is The Fat Controller himself (who Toby doesn't know at this time); he's on vacation with his wife and grandchildren. The day after Toby's retired to his shed, the tram engine's conductor receives a letter from \"the stout gentleman\" he had carried a few days prior with potential good news. Que the latter episode, where Thomas gets in trouble with the new police officer on his branch line for not wearing a cowcatcher or side plates. Sir Topham Hatt attempts to argue in Thomas' defense, but after getting nowhere and Thomas lamenting how he'll be made fun of for looking like a tram engine, he recalls Toby and his predicament and decides to purchase him. And yet, I think an even better example can be found with the second to last episode of the season, \"Down the Mine,\" which neatly ties up Thomas and Gordon's character arcs from throughout the series thus far. But I think you get the point. The way they tie this all together seamlessly is something I had never noticed before and have come to appreciate on my recent rewatch. That, and some of the little humorous bits they sprinkled throughout.\n\n\"Who cares? This is good cocoa!\"\n\nOne final thing I'd like to praise about the writing is some of the humor that's incorporated. No real need to go any more in depth than that, it's just funny stuff. Nothing that'll set your world on fire and have you reeling, but it's nice that they even bothered with humor, and in many varieties. Whether it be stupid moments like the one above from \"The Flying Kipper\"...\n\n...perfectly paced ones like this scene from \"Thomas Goes Fishing\" (Thomas' face helps as well)...\n\n...or just silly banter like this part from \"James and the Express / A Proud Day for James.\" Funnily enough, most of the humor derives from this, as one thing you kind of learn as you're watching the episodes, and pretty much most of the \"Classic\" era seasons (1-7), is that despite the show being called Thomas & Friends, the engines are kind of just a bunch of dicks to each other, which is a good thing. It's better to have flawed characters than perfect role models, as it makes them more relatable. What I think makes the above scene even better is the way George Carlin narrates the whole think, specifically that teasing voice he gave James, which allows me to segway into the second portion of this review...\n\nPresenting...Presentation! Music, Visual Design, & More\n\nGoo goo g'choo ch-I'm sorry. As compensation, here's a fun fact: George Carlin was so nervous over not having an audience to narrate the episodes to that show creator, Britt Allcroft, bought him a teddy bear to read to, which sat by him for the rest of his tenure on Thomas.\n\nSo, continuing off the last point, let's talk about narration. For those who don't know, the first two seasons were narrated by The Beatles drummer, Ringo Starr, with different takes made for both the U.S. and U.K. versions. After setting off, (in)famous comedian, George Carlin, stepped in to not only narrate the third and fourth seasons for American audiences, but also redubbed the first two seasons for the U.S. as well to keep thing consistent. Growing up, I've heard a mixture of their narrations across my DVDs (most had Carlin though), but for this rewatch, I stuck with the George Carlin versions completely. As such, I think it would be a bit unfair for me to decide which of the two are better right now. However, I will give praise to Carlin's performance for the first season. I think his voices for whenever the characters speak are a nice touch. The previous example is a worthy shout-out, but for comparison's sake, here's a moment from an episode that I've now heard both dubs of, \"Thomas and Gordon / Thomas Gets Tricked\":\n\nThe way Carlin pauses for a second and does a lighter-toned, and then sing-song voice for Thomas to make things more distinct is an unnecessary addition that I like. Not that Ringo does a bad job by any means, with his more straightforward narration. Both do their job and do it well, and it's nice to see that Thomas managed to acquire top talent from the beginning. That said, without anyway to smoothly transition over this time (they're both audio things I guess?), I'd like to move on to the music now.\n\nFor the first season, composers, Mike O'Donnel and Junior Campbell went for a synth-based soundtrack, that despite sort of being of the times, still manages to, well, stand the test of time. One great piece, and the one that's probably my favorite of at least the first season, is Henry's theme, which is linked above (a recreation of it anyways). I can't think of anything to really say other than that I just like it. I guess the best word I could use to describe it is that it's pleasant. It perfectly fits with all of Henry's moments throughout the season. Shoutout to all the variations of it used in \"The Flying Kipper\" episode.\n\nMost of the other character's themes this season are more upbeat sounding and energetic, and good little tunes. The one I would like to highlight here though to represent them is James'. That addition of jazz to it I think puts it above the rest. Props to the music video, lyrical version that would be produced later on. Speaking of which...\n\nOkay, this is more of an honorable mention than anything. Since the music videos were produced from season 3 onwards, it's kind of unfair to link one here, but I think Toby's theme is a special case where the lyrical version that came later is better and does the composition a bit more justice. The somber, nostalgic tone, combined with fitting lyrics that recap the events of \"Toby and the Stout Gentleman / Toby the Tram Engine,\" and \"Thomas in Trouble / Thomas Breaks the Rules\" makes it worthy of a mention as a highlight of the series.\n\n...and it wouldn't be right if I left the music category without mentioning the classic runaway theme, usually played right before a crash/accident happens, or as a chase is ensuing. This theme in particular got a lot of variations throughout the \"Classic\" seasons, with several alone being made for the first season, as seen in the video above. It's fast paced and filled with tension, perfectly orchestrating the dire situations it often backs. While on the subject, let's actually talk about the crashes and accidents that happened this season.\n\n\"Fortunately, no one was hurt.\"\n\nYes, I'm going back to \"The Flying Kipper\" for this one. A series staple, although crashes and accidents have been present from the very beginning, they were utilized sparingly throughout the first season. Furthermore, they weren't as extravagant as the ones found later on. Rather, realism was the aim here and they were treated as such with a level of seriousness and dignity. Take the above example. Henry slides into the break van and completely demolishes it, nearly killing the men that were inside, had they not left. Come morning, he's dazed and confused and feels downright miserable. Additionally, he fears this was the final nail in the coffin for him (makes sense if you've seen the prior episodes with him) and will be promptly scrapped. He even casts his doubts on Sir Topham's reasoning that now he may have a new body that'll make him stronger than ever. Fortunately, in the end, he comes out on top, but the way they depict everything is just a testament as to how they weren't holding anything back for the kids, not sugarcoating a single thing. Aside from this, there's less than a handful crashes and accidents in this season, but I think the fact that they're sparingly used and spaced out make them more of a spectacle, and the gravity of the situations all the heavier. Shock and awe, shock and awe. Now for another kind of spectacle...\n\nYeah, I know you're probably getting sick and tired of me talking about \"The Flying Kipper,\" but it really does hit all the right points showing what this season has to offer. A trend throughout this season is having scenes where the camera is set afar from the train(s), while filling the foreground with details/objects, and accompanying all of this with a nice backdrop that implies a good sense of distance. The fact that \"The Flying Kipper\" takes place during the night (not used in many episodes this season), resulting in some nice lighting, makes it even more eye candy to take in. Of course, there are other good-looking shots that can be found within the episodes. Take for example this:\n\nThis is a shot that comes from the very first episode, \"Thomas and Gordon / Thomas Gets Tricked.\" Notice the workmen and crates in the foreground, the buildings off in the distance, etc.\n\nHow about this shot from \"Toby and the Stout Gentleman\"? Once again, everything's all done in layers. You've got the mountains, the castle ruins, Toby himself, etc, etc. I think you get the picture.\n\nSo, with that concluded, and with all of the categories and topics I wanted to discuss covered, what do I think is the best episode of the season? The one that sums it up the best, and shows everything it has to offer? The one I could recommend to you the most? Well, if you didn't get the hint already (I even mentioned it earlier)...\n\n\"It was time for Thomas to leave. He had seen everything.\" - The Conclusion\n\nBig surprise, I know. But now having seen the first season in full for the first time, I can see why people hold this episode in such high regard, and why some even consider this one of the best of the entire show. It looks great, sounds great, it plays with tone, it's a great story all in itself, and it marks a major point in Henry's character arc, requiring some idea of the episodes that proceeded it and having effects that would be maintained for the rest of the series. It's a symbol of where the show was at the time. Sure, it's not big and extravagant, but it doesn't need to be. As for the season itself, and the show as a whole really, it has a timeless nature to it and can be watched just as fine anytime and at any age. Coming back to Thomas & Friends was a trip down memory lane for me, and hopefully, it made you feel nostalgic too. If not that, I hope I introduced you to something that you may be interested in looking into. At the very least, I hope you were able to take away something from this.\n\n\"And so, we've come to the happy ending of our story, and it's time for all of us to go home, just like Thomas.\"\n\nAnd that concludes my first blog post on here. If you have any suggestions on how I can make these better in the future, please, let me know! I don't mind any criticism whatsoever. Well, just don't tell me about the image sizing. I was kind of forced into writing this on my Xbox One out of circumstance, which granted, the version of the Edge browser on here emulates a computer one pretty darn well. However, I was unable to resize images, so please mind them! That said, until next time...whenever that is."
