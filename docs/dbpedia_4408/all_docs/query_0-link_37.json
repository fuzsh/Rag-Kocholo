        "text": "2013 was an exciting time for the older Thomas fandom. A new production team had come in and took over the series creating an era that would be developed by a team who were trying to bring Thomas back to its glory days while trying to bring something new to younger audience. At the same time, Mattel had officially taken over HIT Entertainment and its properties, including Thomas. But years after its official broadcast around the world and its DVD release in 2016, does the series still hold up? Let's find out, but first...\n\nTHESE ARE SOLEY MY OPINIONS AND ARE NOT INFLUENCED FROM THE THOMAS & FRIENDS FANBASE\n\nSERIES 17 (2013)\n\nAndrew Brenner\n\nLee Pressman\n\nDavey Moore\n\nPaul Larson & Laura Beaumont\n\nDavid Baas\n\nRobert Anderson (Arc Productions)\n\nIan McCue (HIT/Mattel)\n\nHaliam Jabbour (HIT/Mattel)\n\nMark Moraghan\n\nEPISODES\n\nSTEAMIE STAFFORD\n\nI remember when this episode first came out, people didn't really like and I was sort of half and half on it back in 2013. Watching it now, it's not as bad as people had thought it was. While the story was quite simple, it was interesting to see the writers tackling a story to a character that was just introduced the previous year, 2012, and would fade away into obscurity because they do. While Stafford's persona didn't shine as much, I think it was good of him going through some character development starting off as an engine wanting to make some noise but then realises in the end that he should be proud of being who and what he is. I will say though him going off making chuffing, puffing and whistling noises did get repetitive over time. So yeah, I didn't think this was a bad episode but not really a perfect one.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nGORDON RUNS DRY\n\nWhen this episode was new, everyone praised this episode and while it was a good episode it wasn't anything great. I loved how Andrew Brenner had nailed Gordon's arrogance, boastful and proud nature, feels like him in the classic series. But of course Gordon running out of water and filling up a couple of times did get a bit repetitive as well. I don't really have any other problem with the episode though and while this was a good episode, it was pretty simple and straightforward.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nTHE LOST PUFF\n\nI like Paxton in this episode with his dimwitted behaviour and I like how they took a character who's not that intelligent about something and would believe something is real. If this were written at the time of the early CG era (S13-16) they probably would've added Percy as the character since he's suppose to be the idiotic one that needs to know everything because he's not smart enough and yet he's a steam engine. It was a good episode and it has a nice message about how silliness can lead to trouble.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nKEVIN'S CRANKY FRIEND\n\nThis episode seems average to me and I think if they had the idea at the time could've introduced Big Mickey here instead of leaving it four years later. Cranky was in a situation and maybe perhaps Big Mickey offers to help but Cranky refused and keeps on making a mess and keeps on delaying ships and engines with him doing all of the work. I mean, how the way he was introduced in S21 was just jarring and was purely there as fan service. If he were introduced here it would feel more natural and needed. However it's all wishful thinking now. I do like the episode but it was kinda repetitive with Cranky messing up and Kevin clearing up. However the dynamic between Cranky and Kevin was good. But overall it was just average.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nTOO MANY FIRE ENGINES\n\nI liked this episode with its message of how two is better than one, which the Fat Controller had justified to the inspectors in the episode. I also like how Flynn went through dilemma about his own worth, thinking that Belle is good enough to be a sole firefighter until he realises in the end. Belle and Flynn aren't great characters and are more gimmicks because of their water hoses and canons. Perhaps if the story was tweaked maybe given Flynn and very charmistic persona, given that he's a hero, but with him breaking down and not getting their in time his ego started to bruise and then go through his dilemma about his worth until he realises that two are better than one. It would've brought some great character development in my opinion.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nCALM DOWN CAITLIN\n\nTo me this is where S17 feels different compare to the first six episodes. There was not much repetition with the dialouge, although the whole 'please be considerte' dialouge was a bit annoying to hear a few times but then again it worked in this episode because the engines were trying to get through to Caitlin that she's working at night and that people are sleeping and don't want to be distrub. It's like they saw 'The Early Bird' and made it better. It was also fun seeing Caitlin being this excitable engine whose heart was in the right place of course but just loves doing something that isn't too common for her, we've all at least been like her before so it makes her relatable.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nWAYWARD WINSTON\n\nI never liked this episode when it was new but looking back at this episode for a while, it wasn't that bad. I find it ironic now that the episode's message is saying that vehicles need a driver and yet after the episode's release, the engines often go off on their own without the need of their crew. It was a nice message along with being careful what you wish for but the whole driver thing gave me a bit of a chuckle. One other thing I liked about this episode is the Fat Controller taking responsibility, it was quite rare to see something like that as, from my memory, he took responsibility for not listening to Percy's warning in 'Percy Gets it Right' in S7. I like this because it showed that the Fat Controller is a human being in the end and not this dictator that some journalists have been shallowly thinking of.\n\nI think one minor improvement could've been done visually with Winston trailling off. His face shows he more likely knew he would be a runaway but maybe have him actually being worried that he was a runaway since it never had happened to him before. This still isn't a top favourite but it isn't bad either.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nNO MORE MR. NICE ENGINE\n\nI think this episode could've been more of a Diesel Vs. Hiro episode, I mean it technically is but it didn't felt like one. I think what could've made it more like that is have Diesel and Hiro arguing who thinks how trucks can be handled. Have Hiro being cool, calm and collective about them and trying to ignore them and have Diesel being tough on them even though they were behaving themselves. This was a good episode but maybe it could've been better.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nAWAY FROM THE SEA\n\nWhat I like about this episode is how the fear of replacement trope was turned around. Instead of a steam engine fearing a diesel was going to replace them, you have a diesel fearing that a steam engine was going to replace them. We never saw that in any Thomas episode, heck not even in the Railway Series books! It just felt more refreshing to see something new, shame that they never went with that idea again and see how any diesel would react to such an idea. Plus with Salty fearing about going to the quarry again, that makes it even more refreshing whereas usually they would fear about being scrapped. A personal favourite of mine. Porter, despite being his debut episode, though didn't really shine through as a character in the episode personality wise. But a solid good episode none the less.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nTHOMAS' SHORTCUT\n\nSeven years had passed since this episode had debuted and it still holds up very well today and aged like fine wine. One of the best things from S17 was that they brought something different that hadn't been used in Thomas for quite sometime outside of the whole 'steam vs. diesel' conflict and of course one of those things was the 'road vs. rail' conflict, although Thomas and Bertie's conflict was pretty much done in good faith as friends. It was a bit repetitive with Thomas trying to find a shortcut but it didn't feel as annoying as like the first few episodes. It had a nice message that we should stick to the road we know and how taking shortcuts can lead to trouble. I'll never forget my reaction when I first saw Harvey in full CGI, I won't say here because there was a bit foul language. But it was a great surprise and I do miss that unexpected moment in the show when no leaks were made, the episode was broadcasted out here before the 'Spills and Thrills' DVD was out in 2014. To me this was a solid episode and probably the best of S17.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nTHE SMELLY KIPPER\n\nRating: 4/10\n\nGONE FISHING\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nTHE AFTERNOON TEA EXPRESS\n\nI think the episode could've trimmed down the narration a bit as there was so much of the narrator telling us what we see visually. We know that Stephen is old and we know that Stephen is slow. But at the same time, there might be some visually impaired children who watch the show and rely on the depth of narration to have something that explains what's going on. While I understand other people's frustrations with the episode itself that's just the feeling I get when I watch this episode or any episode with the fattening of narration, so that's why I'm not going to too harsh towards it. Plus this episode made me realise back then that although Thomas was based around on railway accuracy, this isn't by a member of the Awdry family anymore, and it hadn't been since 2011 after Christopher wrote the last Railway Series book, I would say 1996 but we have two more books in 2007 and 2011. Yes engines being on the same track would never happen in real life, especially an engine like Rocket would never be allowed on a main line in the modern age due to its speed limit. But story comes first and you need something that would work for a character that would later become something conflicting in order for them to learn a lesson. The episode itself wasn't too bad. It was simple but at the same time not too memorable. I would say there are some traits of the 'Miller/Barlow' era in this episode such as Jam at the docks and then a spare just in case if another engine messes up the first order. But I'm glad that had been toned down to the point it doesn't exist anymore.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nHENRY'S HERO\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nLUKE'S NEW FRIEND\n\nI still love the episode, it was a very nice one with Luke wanting to be with the deer at the quarry only. But the episode also points out how a quarry is no place for an animal like a deer and they also added how dangerous it is visually with the deer being on Owen and not to mention the entire place is filled with engines, explosives, not much fresh air to breathe in thanks to the dust and large cranes carrying stone. Perhaps maybe to make the episode more emotional perhaps have Luke being stuck only in one place while the rest of the Skarloey engines went away back to the sheds away from the quarry, making him feel very lonely. It would make his friendship with the deer and him letting it go in the end more emotional and it would give the message that its dangerous for animals to be in a quarry and no matter how near or far, they are still friends. However I do love the episode.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nTHE SWITCH\n\nI think maybe to spice up a bit more of a rivalry between Luke and Millie is probably have them being a bit boastful about their own work and what makes it more important than the other. It was there in the episode but it didn't feel much like one. Like maybe have Millie thinking Luke's job was easy and Luke the same. For the latter he was confident about doing Millie's work and with Millie maybe you can have going in full of confidence as well. However the episode was still good and I like it how it gives the message that all jobs are different. All in all, another good episode from Davey Moore.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nNOT NOW, CHARLIE!\n\nI remember not everyone liking the ending of this episode when the narrator says that Charlie would never tell another joke again but it didn't last long and while I understand that it destroys any sort of character development, I feel that they did that because Charlie's trait is to have him telling jokes. Plus we had many characters who learn something and sometimes go back to their original trait because its there to stir up conflict. As much as I love for characters to grow, learn and develop, I think its more easier for a show or movie that is one whole continuing storyline rather than an episodic series. Plus the ending makes Charlie more human, we all can't fulfill our promises and we can always get back into a habit. This is probably the best Charlie episode, and probably the only one since he never had any great episodes to begin with. It's nice to see him going through some consequence for once instead of laughing, joking and causing trouble and never got a scolding for it. Seriously, even BWBA can make a S13-16 look like total garbage and I do seriously mean that. The story kind of remind me of 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf', where a boy played a trick to people that a wolf is coming until when an actual wolf came no one believed him. Just like with Charlie and the elephant. Charlie joked about elephants until a real one escaped from the animal park and he warned about to the other engines but they didn't believe him because they thought it was a joke. In the end, a great episode for Charlie and its nice that he went out on a high note.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nTHE THOMAS WAY\n\nA nice way to introduce Duck to the younger generation, although we would learn that years later that kids don't actually resonate with Duck, according SiF's twitter page. I think I can understand why, you have the steam team characters (e.g - Thomas, James, Percy etc.) who would often have flaws and would make plenty of mistakes over each episode. Duck however is more sensible and although this episode showcased that being stubborn can lead to trouble and not everything can go your way, a sensible engine like him wouldn't try and do that again whereas the main characters would make more mistakes due to whatever personality traits they were given, perhaps kids might've found Duck boring? That's just how I see it, I would love to know the real reason if there is one. Anyway despite that, the episode was good and I seem to remember not many people like Thomas' character in the episode but I feel like he was only trying to make Harold happy after his accident by showing him the sites of Sodor, I think what they should've done was to maybe give it more explanation if they were going with that. I will say it was good but not a huge favourite of mine. Plus that little easter egg of Duck's S6 model surrounded by Paddington yards was a nice little treat still.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nTHE PHANTOM EXPRESS\n\nAs much as I am a fan of Keith Wickham, I really didn't like how he voiced James and Percy in some parts of the episode, they sound too robotic in the UK dub at this time. Probably because I'm so used to Nigel Pilkington and Rob Rackshaw now since they'd taken over Keith's roles as James and Percy and they have something more natural in their voices. Keith Wickham is still a great voice actor but I think he's more better voicing characters that share his voice in both dubs, he sounds more flexable and natural and it shows. As for the episode I do like the James and Percy dynamic, the foggy dark atmosphere of the castle grounds and I also like how Stephen is this wise old engine with some snide remarks but he still gets nervous about somethings. There are some moments I think that should've been 'show don't tell' moments like Percy thinking that James' puffing sound was Stephen's but we had the narrator saying; 'But it wasn't Stephen, it was James.' The visual of James puffing around the corner and we see his cheeky face is enough to tell the audience that it was him. I know I said that there might be some visually impaired kids who watch the show but you also have the sound effects that they would identify the characters with, particulary the whistles. In the end, this was a good episode.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nTHE FROZEN TURNTABLE\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nPERCY'S LUCKY DAY\n\nThe story is a tad predictable as it's very common in children stories; someone has an unlucky day, got a good luck charm, lost it and it turns out you don't need a lucky charm after all. The episode was good none the less and had some great moments like Bill and Ben bickering, Percy mistaking a green handkerchief as a green flag is something like 'Wrong Road' etc. In the end it was a nice Percy story and I feel that it can be quite suitable for him. But it feels very so-so to me.\n\nRating: 5/10\n\nNO SNOW FOR THOMAS\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nBILL OR BEN?\n\nThis was a fun episode, Bill and Ben were in character and it was nice that Connor got a chance to shine with some personality compare to his appearance in King of The Railway. Not a great character by any means but you can tell he had a competitive attitude but he was fair when he knew one of the twins won't be any faster than him. I really have no problems with this episode at all.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nTHE MISSING CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS\n\nIt's quite odd to see Diesel 10 in an episode after seeing him in two, atrocious, movies and 'Calling All Engines!', yeah I know everyone doesn't like the latter because apparently Diesel 10 being nice is bad even though at the time MRR was barely referenced in the TV series at all, more likely due to rights issues with Sony as they own the movie, it's a bit complex to explain it all so I digress. But I would say he was given much more better justice in term of character in this episode, he's not evil but more of a battler for the inequalities between steam and diesel. It's nice to see that from him then being a generic bad guy diesel who hate steam engines and think they are superior. I will say that episode did have some conflicts like D10 bullying Paxton, Sidney's wheels and the missing decorations and some of them don't seem relevant to the main title. Perhaps maybe if the plot was more focused on D10 and his way of wanting Christmas his way by bullying the other diesels and have the diesels standing up towards him telling him what Christmas means and have them go off and celebrate it with the steam engines and then you have D10 celebrating all on his own realising that he had been selfish and apologised, perhaps maybe if it works have him being terrible to Sidney by ignoring him about his wheels and on his lonesome, he saw him and decides to be nice to him as well as the other diesels. This wasn't a bad episode but could've been better.\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nSANTA'S LITTLE ENGINE\n\nThe small facial expressions from Winston give me a chuckle like how he was shocked that the Fat Controller came up with the idea of driving Winston as Santa's sleigh and when the Earl said he made his mind up you can see the relief coming from Winston, a nice way of expressing the reaction of the characters instead of the narrator telling you exactly what's going on, show don't tell. I do like the focus towards the Fat Controller in this episode and you can see how reserved he was over the Earl's plan which makes him very human. There's really not much else to say and this episode was a nice way to end the 17th season.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n---\n\nAnd so that was S17, does it live up today? Hmm, I'm kinda 50/50. While the writing in some episode is still great to sit through, I feel that some episodes, particularly the first six episode really feel that they belong to the likes of S13-16, I'm not saying they are bad but I feel that some of the repetition in those episodes were so obvivous and that the production team found these scripts and retooled them to make them more bearable to sit through. 'Gordon Runs Dry' was a favourite of mine back when it was new with Gordon's characterisation but the dialouge in the episode and the three strike formula really feels like a 'Miller/Barlow' era script. I really don't see it as a top favorite anymore like I used to. The first six really came off as a slow start for me but by the time when it got to Caitlin's episode that's where things really began to pick up speed and was becoming a bit more interesting.\n\nThe visuals are good but they kinda gave me this plasterscene/playdo kind of vibe towards the engines and the backgrounds, I think the weird lighting had to do something with the way some of the characters look, I think it's great though how two years after this Arc Productions had brought in much more better visuals, but we'll get to that later.\n\nThe music, I like Robert Hartshorne's music but if there's one problem I have with his music during his time in the show and that is how the music is just there to fill in the background. I do miss the indiviualism of the themes for some of the characters and while Hartshorne has talent, the music just sounds generic. It feels like Bruce Faulconer for the english dub of the 'Dragon Ball' series how the music was just there. At times some of his music can work in some scenes but other times like Goku turning Super Sayian for the first time, the music was just your generic hard rock soundtrack to make it look edgy or cool.\n\nThe voice acting was good but when watching the UK dub, I feel some of the dialouge sounded more robotic, particulary from Keith Wickham and Ben Small. As much as I like them and do see talent within them, I'm glad Wickham had improved over the years but it was also sad to see Ben Small not having his contract renewed, I still think HIT/Mattel should've let him stayed on as his other characters like they did for Wickham. I have seen a few US dubbed episode and would say that their dialouge sound more natural compare to their UK counterpart and I know that because usually the US voice actors are the first ones to act out the characters. Although I can also see some of the fandom's criticism of the idea of having two dubs and I think nowadays, Thomas can work with a UK dub in both countries. We live in a world now where kids can hear an english accent thanks to YouTube and of course their are shows like 'Peppa Pig' and 'Bluey' where they keep the respective dub to a US market and it turns out fine in the end.\n\nI think it was great that the production team brought back characters like Duck, Bill and Ben though and I really have no quarrel with that."
