        "text": "CLASSIC GAME FISHING BOAT – PETER JOHN\n\nBack in Nov 2023 we ran a very brief story with the above photo of PETER JOHN – other than ID’ing the location (THC Hotel, Waitangi, Bay of Islands ) we learnt no more about the vessel – then out of the blue we received a note from Col Skudder with a raft of intel to share so I’ll hand over to Col to pass on his memories of PETER JOHN –\n\n“Early 1961 / 62 K John Humphrey (logging contractor Rotorua) purchased the launch and kept it , moored in Pilot Bay, Mt Maunganui. John used the vessel frequently through out the Bay of Plenty, mainly Mayor Is and Motiti Is areas with his close diver friend Mick Claude , also of Rotorua. I spent lots of hours in my youth, fishing with John and Mick and both my father (Bob Skudder – owner of Naomi- game fish launch) and John were close friends.\n\nFrom memory just after the MaCherie (built by Visa Ship Yards, Mt Maunganui for Don Shattock – approx. 1963) the PETER JOHN was hauled out at Visa slipway for major refitting. John replaced the twin petrol engines with twin diesel engines plus had an enclosed pilot house fitted above the engine room. The rebuild was very much in keeping with your pictured vessel lines, change making the vessel more family friendly for Johns family, rather than the day boat it had been originally.\n\nNot long after – approx. 1963 – John sold PETER JOHN & purchased the Oliver & Giplin built game fisher MARGARET ANNE, which John chartered out of Tauranga. Again, I spent time as decky with John H. on his new game fisher. I understood PETER JOHN then moved to Whangamata with a new owner.\n\nLate 1970’s I moved back to Tauranga with my family and skippered several Game Fishing vessels out of Tauranga, namely WAIMARIE II (after Max Caruthers sold it to Malcom Sarten of New Plymouth – continuing with Malcom until his passing and Bill Ebdale – boat broker – sold it for Malcom’s estate.\n\nAlso skippered NORTHERN STAR (owner Ron Kusabs) plus managed Faulkner Bros Ferries (after Company was purchased by Leo Dromgol – North Shore ferries/ Tauranga – Mt bus Co) – vessels WAITERE / MISS RUSSELL / SHAMROCK. Late 1970′ I had the pleasure of skippering DUVAUCHELLE – game fisher (owned by Jim Hunt -Hamilton) and managed the conversion of DUVAUCHELLE from twin Volvo stern drives to twin Yanmar vee drives along with Reg Hodson- boat builder, and Len Gilbert – Gilbert Marine. End result was and I believe still is, a fuel efficient well balance high speed vessel.\n\nI then moved to Malaysia – Super Yachts , then USA and operated private SUPER YACHTS both West and East Coasts , before returning, Charter game fishing Moreton Bay/ Gold Coast and owing my own 16m high speed sport fisher.Age having to be accepted, retiring in Cairns Far Nth Queensland."
