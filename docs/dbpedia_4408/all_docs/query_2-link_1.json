In the UK, he narrated all of the official read-along apps.\n\nPrior to the Big World! Big Adventures! rebrand, there were only five episodes in the CGI series of Thomas & Friends in which Keith Wickham does not voice a character: Buzzy Bees, The Switch, Not So Slow Coaches, Marion and the Dinosaurs and Love Me Tender. Since the rebrand, several episodes have omitted him from the voice cast, particularly in episodes that take place in foreign countries.\n\nHe reprised his roles as Gordon, Percy, James, and Harold in Thomas and the Hidden Treasure.\n\nHe reprised his roles as Gordon and Sir Topham Hatt in Rainbow Sun Productions' Thomas and the Magic Railroad 20th Anniversary Celebration.\n\nHe voiced Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, and Sir Topham Hatt in SleepyHenry's Ask The Famous 8 Five Year Anniversary Special. To date, this was his last \"official\" role as these characters.\n\nThis was the first time he had voiced James since 2016.\n\nBoth he and Rob Rackstraw have voiced characters in \"The Koala Brothers\", with Wickham voicing Frank and Archie, and Rackstraw voicing Buster, George and Sammy.\n\nHe based his voice of Henry on that of political writer, broadcaster and MP, Matthew Parris.[1]\n\nHe revealed in an interview with the Roll Along Thomas blog that he never watched the Thomas & Friends television series prior to being cast, despite being aware of its existence.[2]\n\nReferences"
