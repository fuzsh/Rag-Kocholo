        "text": "Percy is a little green engine who loves doing his best for the Fat Controller's Railway. Percy has his flaws such as his cheekiness with the bigger engines.\n\n(He peeps at Gordon to wake him up!)\n\nAnd his tendency to feel afraid sometimes.\n\n(At Tidmouth Sheds with Edward, Toby, Thomas, James and Emily looking worried at one of Edward's stories.)\n\nBut Percy is still Really Useful, particularly at his favourite job of delivering the post.\n\nOne day, Percy was at the Sodor Steamworks with James and Thomas. Percy had to have his whistle repaired. It had got a lot of quarry dust in it and needed a good polish.\n\nVictor had finished James' repair and was now finishing Thomas' troubles.\n\n\"There you go, my friend.\" smiled Victor, \"Now go and be Really Useful!\"\n\n\"Thank you, Victor!\" And Thomas puffed out of the Steamworks.\n\n\"And now, Percy, we should be finished polishing your whistle. Kevin, bring Percy's whistle.\"\n\nKevin spun round with Percy's whistle in his hook but as he spun, he dropped the whistle. He quickly picked it up again, but he didn't notice that it was dented, and nor did the workman whom propped it back in place.\n\n\"There you go, Percy.\" said Victor.\n\n\"Thank you, Victor.\" said Percy.\n\nJust then, the Fat Controller arrived.\n\n\"Today, the Railway Inspector will be visiting the Island. I want all of you to work your best and be Really Useful.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" said the engines.\n\nThe Fat Controller left and Percy went to obey him and Victor and set off to collect some daytime post vans.\n\nAs Percy shunted into the post vans, he saw the Railway Inspector approach him and Emily.\n\n\"Well, Miss Emily,\" said the Inspector approvingly, \"You and your coaches look spotless and perfectly in good working order.\"\n\nEmily smiled and gracefully chuffed away. Then the Inspector turned to Percy.\n\nPercy expected for him to be pleased too as he had just returned from the Sodor Steamworks, but the Railway Inspector was surveying Percy for a long while, and he started to worry.\n\n\"Well, Master Percy,\" he said, \"You are quite dapper, but there is something wrong with your whistle.\"\n\nPercy could not believe it. He had just had his whistle repaired. He had good trust in Victor.\n\n\"You must go to the Steamworks to have it fixed.\" continued the Railway Inspector, \"It's dented and loose.\"\n\nAnd he walked away, leaving Percy feeling confused and disappointed.\n\nPercy pulled away with the post train, wondering how his whistle could be damaged.\n\n\"Victor just had it fixed. It's impossible.\" he peeped. Then a thought popped into his pistons. \"Maybe the Railway Inspector was mistaken. After all, it had just been repaired. Victor wouldn't have tricked me.\"\n\nSo Percy didn't go back to the Steamworks. He steamed along the branch line with the post train.\n\nHe puffed happily to deliver supplies to Farmer Trotter. He whistled hello, but his whistle sounded strained and windy, not shrill and squeaky.\n\nPercy was worried.\n\n(Thomas passes with Annie and Clarabel, whistling. Dowager Hatt, Bridget Hatt and Old Bailey can be seen onboard)\n\nLater he puffed to Knapford Station and finished his deliveries. His whistle still sounded bad. Percy could now see that Victor hadn't fixed his whistle on properly.\n\n\"Why did Victor do this?\" he sighed sadly. He felt hurt.\n\n(The Policeman and Lady Hatt can be seen on the platform)\n\nPercy had to return the mail vans to the shunting yards over Gordon's Hill. He set off. He was determined to finish his job before returning to the Steamworks.\n\n(He passes the roads, and the three Horrid Lorries drive past, faceless.)\n\nPercy puffed to the top of Gordon's Hill. He felt very sad about how Victor failed to fix his whistle. Then he puffed down the other side.\n\nThen there was trouble. Thomas was on his way along the line with Annie and Clarabel delivering passengers on the main line. Percy saw Thomas' steam from the top of the Hill. He could tell Thomas was on the same track as he was.\n\n\"Bust my buffers!\" Percy was speeding down to the bottom of the Hill. He knew he couldn't stop in time or change tracks. He tried to whistle to Thomas. But his whistle had shot off without sounding completely! Percy and Thomas were in worse danger!\n\nPercy sped past a signalbox. He was applying his brakes but Thomas wasn't and he couldn't stop. The signalman saw the danger and he quickly switched Thomas into a siding. Percy screeched to a stop a bit beyond the siding. Everyone was safe.\n\nThomas had stopped in front of the buffers. He was cross. The incident meant his passengers would be delayed.\n\n\"Percy!\" he shouted.\n\nPercy slowly reversed back towards Thomas.\n\n\"I thought Victor had repaired your whistle!\" snapped Thomas.\n\n\"So did I!\" sighed Percy and he told Thomas all that had happened.\n\nThomas didn't believe Victor had done it on purpose. \"Go back to the Steamworks. Victor has an explanation. I'm sure of it.\"\n\nPercy wasn't sure, but he had to get a new whistle now anyway. So after dropping off his mail vans, he went to the Steamworks.\n\nVictor was surprised to see Percy back. \"Percy, my friend, what happened to your whistle?\"\n\nPercy told Victor all that had happened that day. Victor frowned.\n\n\"The whistle must have been damaged here. KEVIN!\"\n\nKevin approached meekly.\n\n\"Did you damage the whistle at all when you gave it to Percy?\" asked Victor.\n\nKevin sighed and admitted to dropping the whistle. Percy wasn't cross. He was pleased that it was an accident and that Victor didn't get him into trouble on purpose.\n\nAt last, Percy was fitted with a new whistle. The Railway Inspector arrived.\n\n\"Ah, now that's much better, Master Percy!\" he said approvingly.\n\nPercy was very happy."
