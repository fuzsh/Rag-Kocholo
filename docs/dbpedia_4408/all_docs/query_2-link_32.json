        "text": "Script written by Nathan Sharp\n\nTop 10 Animated Female TV Characters Voiced by a Man\n\nNow that is one convincing vocal performance. Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the Top 10 Animated Female TV Characters Voiced by a Male.\n\nFor this list, we’ll be looking at female characters from various animated TV shows who are actually voiced by men.\n\n#10: Dowager Hatt\n\n“Thomas & Friends” (1984-)\n\nIf you’ve haven’t watched “Thomas & Friends” in a while (don’t worry, we won’t blame you), then we’ll give you a little recap. Dowager Hatt is the stern mother of Sir Topham Hatt, the manager of the North Western Railway. Since the late 2000s, Dowager has been voiced by Keith Wickham, a voice actor popular for his work as Polluto on the UK children’s series “Tommy Zoom.” Wickham does voice work for many characters on “Thomas & Friends, including that of Dowager’s own son, Sir Topham. The man is just that versatile. Okay, yes, the Dowager voice is nothing but an exaggerated, nasally male voice, but the point still stands!\n\n#9: Bev Bighead & Gladys the Hippo Lady\n\n“Rocko’s Modern Life” (1993-96)\n\n“Rocko’s Modern Life” was a popular Nickelodeon show that became controversial for its sneaky innuendos and adult humor. It followed the adventures of wallaby Rocko, steer Heffer, turtle Filburt, and dog Spunky. Two of its other characters, Rocko’s neighbor Bev Bighead and Rocko’s acquaintance Gladys the Hippo, were voiced by Charlie Adler, the same man who voiced Starscream in the “Transformers” movies and Buster Bunny in “Tiny Toon Adventures.” His female characters don’t have the most feminine of voices, but hey, he gets the job done.\n\n#8: Ruby Jean ‘Granny’ Cuyler\n\n“Squidbillies” (2005-)\n\n“Squidbillies” is a Cartoon Network show that follows the adventures of a family of anthropomorphic mud squids. It’s surprisingly popular, despite its rather disgusting-sounding premise. The oldest member of the family, senile Granny Cuyler, is a nasty purple thing with glasses, a bright shade of lipstick, and a walker. She is voiced by stand-up comedian Dana Snyder, who is perhaps best known for his work as Master Shake on “Aqua Teen Hunger Force.” Dana puts on a very distinct high, nasally, and slurred voice for Granny, and it really digs its way into your ear. Whether you find this annoying or hilarious, the voice has Dana’s signature all over it.\n\n#7: Gertie Growler\n\n“George of the Jungle” (1967)\n\nMales voicing females is certainly not a new concept. “George of the Jungle” was a short-lived ABC program that ran from September to December of 1967. It consisted of three segments – “George of the Jungle,” “Tom Slick,” and “Super Chicken.” The “Tom Slick” segments told the story of a race car driver, his girlfriend, and his elderly mechanic, Gertie Growler. Gertie was voiced by Bill Scott, a renowned voice actor and writer who co-created both “George of the Jungle” and “The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends.” Scott also provided the voices of George, Tom Slick, and Super Chicken. So really, the show was mostly just Bill Scott talking to himself the entire time.\n\n#6: Grenda\n\n“Gravity Falls” (2012-16)\n\n“Gravity Falls” is like “Twin Peaks” for children. It follows twins Dipper and Mabel Pines as they explore the mysterious and spooky town of Gravity Falls. Mabel’s best friends are Candy Chiu and Grenda, who are respectively voiced by female Niki Yang and male Carl Faruolo. This really shouldn’t come as a surprise, as Grenda has a very distinctive deep and particularly masculine voice. Interestingly enough, Caruolo only has a few voice acting credits to his name. He’s better known for his writing and storyboard work on shows like “Sanjay and Craig.”\n\n#5: Baby Skeeter\n\n“Muppet Babies” (1984-91)\n\nIn the 1984 movie “The Muppets Take Manhattan,” Miss Piggy dreams of what it would be like growing up with Kermit. This sequence in turn influenced the creation of CBS’s “Muppet Babies,” which told the stories of toddler Muppets growing up in a nursery. The producers wanted to add another female character to the cast, which led to the creation of Scooter’s twin sister, Skeeter. Skeeter was originally voiced by Howie Mandel, who left the show after the second season and was replaced by another male voice actor, Frank Welker, better known for his role as Fred in “Scooby-Doo.”\n\n#4: Betsy Krabs\n\n“SpongeBob SquarePants” (1999-)\n\nBetsy Krabs is the strict mother of Eugene Krabs and grandmother of Pearl. In Seasons 2 and 3, Betsy was voiced by Paul Tibbitt. Tibbitt has long been involved in the production of “SpongeBob SquarePants” and took over the role of showrunner from Stephen Hillenburg after his departure following the first movie. He served as executive producer and showrunner until 2015, when he left the show to work on “It’s a Wonderful Sponge.” However, Tibbitt’s tenure as Betsy Krabs didn’t last long. Beginning in Season 4, she was regularly voiced by female voice actress Sirena Irwin.\n\n#3: Diane Choksondik\n\n“South Park” (1997-)\n\nDiane Choksondik, the kids’ fourth grade teacher, is certainly a distinctive “South Park” character, and not just because of her name. She has many distinguishing physical traits, such as her extremely saggy breasts, large glasses, and lazy eye, which tends to wobble around as she talks. And, like many South Park residents, she is voiced by co-creator Trey Parker, who lends his voice to many male characters, including Stan and Cartman. However, Trey’s role as Choksondik was finished after she was killed off in the sixth season episode, “Professor Chaos.”\n\n#2: Lumpy Space Princess\n\n“Adventure Time” (2010-18)\n\nServing as one of the major characters of the show, Lumpy Space Princess is the princess and later queen of, you guessed it, Lumpy Space, a cloud city located in space. She is portrayed as bratty, stubborn, and self-centered, serving as a parody of airheaded valley girls. She has consistently been voiced by series creator Pendleton Ward, who uses a stereotypical valley girl accent called valleyspeak to portray Lumpy Space Princess’s ditzy personality and spoiled attitude. And we must say, despite being a princess, that deep, nasally voice works perfectly for her character.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nNanny\n\n“Count Duckula” (1988-93)\n\nDr. Mrs. The Monarch\n\n“The Venture Bros.” (2003-)\n\nGranny Goodness\n\n“Superman: The Animated Series” (1996-2000)\n\n#1: Tina Belcher\n\n“Bob’s Burgers” (2011-)\n\nKristen Schaal, who voices the youngest child, Louise, is the only real female member of the Belcher family. Everyone else is voiced by a male, including matriarch Linda and oldest child Tina. Linda Belcher is voiced by John Roberts, who modeled Linda’s voice after his own mother’s. Tina, the socially awkward yet incredibly horny oldest child, is voiced by deadpan stand-up comedian Dan Mintz. Mintz provides Tina with the same deadpan delivery and hardly ever conveys emotion. He also doesn’t even try to put on a female voice, making it incredibly obvious that Tina is voiced by a man. However, this little oddity just makes her character that much funnier."
