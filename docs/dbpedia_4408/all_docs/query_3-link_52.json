        "text": "Percy is the Number Six engine on the Fat Controller's Railway. He is the second tank engine to have come to Sodor. He was needed when the bigger engines posed a strike against the Fat Controller because after Thomas got his own branch line, they had to fetch their own coaches and they didn't like that at all. Since then, they have learned their lesson...but still complain.\n\nPercy fetches the coaches a lot of the time and sometimes he feels that the bigger engines don't give him enough credit.\n\nOne day, Percy fetched the coaches for Gordon's Express.\n\n(Toby and Hank can be seen in the station. Lady Hatt can be seen chatting with the Duchess of Boxford. Other people on the platform include a schoolgirl, Farmer Trotter and the Bird Watcher.)\n\n\"Hurry up, Little Percy!\" ordered Gordon.\n\nPercy frowned and biffed the coaches into Gordon. He didn't like being teased for his size.\n\n\"You're such a small and careless engine!\" grumbled Gordon. \"I'm surprised that the Fat Controller has ever believed you to be Really Useful! You're just too small, timid and weak.\"\n\nGordon steamed away, leaving poor Percy feeling very small indeed.\n\nThat night, at Tidmouth Sheds, Thomas had stern words for Gordon.\n\n\"Percy is not a small, timid, weak engine! He is Really Useful!\" he snapped.\n\n\"Ha!\" laughed Gordon. \"Not small. He's smaller than even you, Thomas.\"\n\n\"And not timid?\" chuckled James. \"Don't you remember the time he ran all the way back to a station because he saw some garden gnomes?\"\n\nPercy remembered that day well. It still made him feel foolish\n\n\"And not weak?\" teased Diesel as he rolled by. \"Percy is a weakling, the biggest weakling of the steamies, or should that be the smallest? He was so easy to biff, I biffed him hard when I didn't even mean to once. And he had to have my help shifting an old calliope around.\"\n\n\"B-b-but I proved to be Really Useful back then!\" snapped Percy.\n\n\"But you were silly beforehand, Percy.\" said Henry a little snobbishly. \"And you've always been a bit silly. Remember the time you got covered in jam after teasing me and trying to scare the coaches?\"\n\nPercy sighed. That mistake was one of his worst memories of his time of Sodor.\n\n\"Percy may be small.\" said Thomas. \"But you should never overlook a little engine. Percy can be brave, fast and smart!\"\n\n\"Name one time Percy was fast!\" sniffed Gordon.\n\n\"Well, remember when Percy first came to Sodor?\" asked Thomas. \"He was stuck on the main line and you nearly crashed into him, but his reaction was so swift, he managed to go on a runaway to avoid it. You even praised him for preventing that accident!\"\n\n\"I forgot about that.\" mumbled Gordon thoughtfully.\n\n\"When has Percy been smart?\" asked Henry.\n\n\"Remember that time Percy had to work in the mines and then an avalanche happened when the Troublesome Trucks crashed into the prop? It was Percy's idea to shelter under a canvas barrier. That saved him and his Driver and Fireman!\"\n\nHenry thought about it. \"Hmm, that Was clever.\"\n\n\"And I suppose you have a time in mind when Percy was brave?\" snarled Diesel.\n\n\"Yes, actually!\" snapped Thomas. \"And I'm sure that James especially remembers that day! Percy once rescued James from a landslide at the China Clay Pits! He was very brave that day; even I didn't want to get too close to the danger!\"\n\nJames blushed redder than his paint. \"Yes...I do remember Percy's bravery then.\"\n\n\"So you see! Percy is Really Useful, brave, fast and clever!\" said Thomas.\n\nPercy was blushing too. He knew all that Thomas had said was right, and most of the engines had now agreed with him, all except Diesel.\n\n\"Hmmmph!\" he growled.\n\nThe next day, Percy was shunting in the Knapford yard.\n\n(Stanley and Philip can be seen shunting there too.)\n\nThomas came in.\n\n(He is coupled to Annie and Clarabel.)\n\n\"Gordon is waiting for his coaches, Percy.\" he said.\n\n\"He still won't shunt then.\" chuckled Percy.\n\n\"Some things will never change, Percy.\" laughed Thomas and he went off to collect his passengers.\n\nPercy was on his way to collect Gordon's coaches when Diesel oiled in cheekily and blocked the way.\n\n\"Out of the way, Diesel!\" frowned Percy.\n\n\"Make me, Little Percy!\" sneered Diesel.\n\nDiesel forced Percy to keep changing tracks in the yard to try and reach the coaches, but then there was trouble.\n\nDiesel reversed too fast into a siding and hit the buffers. He wasn't hurt or off the rails, but his axles and back buffer beam had broken and his side rod had fallen off. So now he couldn't move.\n\nThen there was more trouble.\n\nFrom up above, the engines all heard a revving, stuttering sound. Harold the Helicopter was flying above the station but his engine was stuttering and his alarm lights were bleeping on and off and he started to judder about up and down.\n\n\"Engine trouble, chaps! Emergency landing! Stand clear!\" he shouted as he lowered down towards the yard.\n\nBut Harold's pilot could no longer control Harold and knew they had to land roughly and without a guarantee of a safe spot. They were heading towards Diesel.\n\n\"I can't move!\" cried Diesel.\n\nWithout thinking, Percy rushed forward. \"I must be brave!\"\n\nPercy was coupled to Diesel and he pulled him clear of the siding as Harold juddered and hit the siding with a fierce bump.\n\nLuckily, no one was hurt.\n\n\"Well done, Percy, old chap!\" called Harold.\n\n\"Y-you saved me, Percy!\" stuttered Diesel.\n\n\"See, Diesel!\" called Thomas. \"Percy may be little but he is a Really Useful hero!\"\n\nEven Gordon had to agree. \"Three cheers for Percy!\"\n\n\"Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! HOORAY!\"\n\nPercy smiled. He may still be small, but he now felt very big!\n\nAnd he now had a new memory to remind himself that he was Really Useful!"
