        "text": "My voice for Sir Robert Norramby in this part of the #ThomasCreatorCollective's \"Gordon's Grand Adventure\" series (seen at 1:54 and 2:16)\n\nis an impression of Mike Grady,\n\nwho voiced the character in the actual TV series (both US and UK).\n\nThis video shows some of the impressions I can do from the popular TV series, \"Thomas & Friends\". The audio was sent as an audition when the original actors, Martin Sherman and Ben Small left in 2014.\n\nFor this video, it was all for fun; it's an \"audition\" for a fan-redub of the 2012 Thomas & Friends special, \"Blue Mountain Mystery\", which\n\nalso features some of the many British accents I\n\ncan do.\n\nThe audio clips for this video were originally sent to 20th Century Fox to audition for some of Harry Shearer's characters from \"The Simpsons\", after he announced in May 2015 that he was going to leave the show over the new pay cuts. But as of July 2015, he ultimately decided to stay on.\n\nThis video was also done for fun, but was also done to show that my vocal impressions\n\ndon't just lie with trains and tugboats,\n\nbut can also lie with a certain puppet show...\n\nThis video was an audition I sent for the now-cancelled TUGS CGI project, \"TUGS: Stormy Seas\", which features me as all the male roles. At the time, I managed to impress the people I sent this to, and landed the role of \"Ten Cents\" as a result."
