        "text": "-READ IT!!!!-\n\nWARNING: THE FOLLOWING YOU’RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY CONTAIN– Oh, forget it!!!\n\n-We Now Join Our Regularly Scheduled Review, Already in Progress-\n\nHello, I’m The Detective Librarian and at last, I get to review the one thing that I’ve been waiting for, a long LONG time!!!!!\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: You mean, Season 6 of “MLP: FIM” this spring?\n\nTHE DETECTIVE LIBRARIAN: No, Ted!! Season 6 hasn’t even aired yet. Besides, I’m hyped up for it too, ya know? Especially with that CUTE, WITTLE, FLURRY HEART/SHINING ARMOR AND PRINCESS CADENCE’S (MI AMORE CADENZA’S) BABY ALICORN THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS AND DUMBO!!!!!!!! :’D :\n\nTED THE SCRIPT PERSON: Oh. Right. Sorry, continue.\n\nThank you. As I was saying, I’m going to review the one thing all you “Thomas” fans like me have been waiting for: Season 19 of “Thomas & Friends”!!! YES, I’M REVIEWING THE NINETEENTH SEASON OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD ICONS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INFAMOUS “ENGINE ROLL CALL”!!!! Just like Season 17 & 18, Season 19 starts off as a Walmart exclusive on DVD with “Whale of a Tale”, containing six episodes from this season on June 9, 2015. It then aired in the UK on Milkshake on September 21st of the same year, before reaching the US nearly a month later on October 13th on PBS Kids. Speaking of “Engine Roll Call”, this season contains a new “Engine Roll Call” and intro with a different tune, footage, and inclusion of everyone’s favorite Great Western Pannier, Montague AKA Duck!!!!!:\n\nBut, hey, at least it’s better than the usual crappy “Engine Roll Call”. But, I THINK THAT THE ORIGINAL OPENING FROM SEASONS 1-7 WOULD’VE BEEN, MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!!!!! AGAIN, HERE’S THE TRUE AND ORIGINAL OPENING RIGHT NOW!!!!:\n\nAs you can tell, I LOVE the original “T&F” opening from Season 1-7/Classic Series, while I HATE, HATE the “Engine Roll Call”. But, I digress, just like The Unlucky Tug/TheUnluckyTug02’s review of Seasons 14 & 15 and SteamTeam3211’s review of Season 15, I’ll be listing the episodes from which they aired on TV or DVD and give them my personal opinions about it and my final score, before giving the season my official scoring results of what I think of it. With that said, let’s take a look!!!\n\n#1.) “Who’s Geoffrey?”: In this season opener, Thomas causes an accident and Brendam Docks and tries to get himself out of trouble, by lying that a made-up engine named “Geoffrey” from the Mainland caused the accident. But, the lie gets out of control and now, everyone on Sodor believes that Geoffrey is real, when in reality, he isn’t!! As much as people love this episode itself, I think it’s a great start to this season because it was funny, well-written, and clever!!! I can agree with NewController01 that it would’ve been more funnier, if Geoffrey was an real engine and I think I read one comment about this episode that he or she depicted Geoffrey as Arthur (one of the many Classic Series characters who hasn’t returned in AGES) and I agree, even if Sodor Island 3D/Trainz Simulator depicted Geoffrey a different engine. Yeah, I know, a lot of you laughed at not two of my favorite parts of the episode, one of the best moments in “T&F” history: “The Accident at Brendam Docks” & “Thomas Pretending to Be Geoffrey”.:\n\nAside from that, since Martin T. Sherman (the former voice of Thomas and Percy in the US dub) left the show and Keith Wickham (Percy, James, STH/The Fat Controller, and other characters’ voices) dropped his role as Percy, we get to hear Percy’s new US and UK voice for the first time, which are Christopher Ragland in the US and Nigel Pilkington and I can honestly say, Chris does a pretty good job voicing Percy. But, Nigel does an okay job voicing him and it’s actually pretty good too. Here’s a comparison between those two and you’ll get what I mean!:\n\nAll in all, I love this episode!! It’s not only one of the best episodes in this season so far, this is one of the best “Thomas” episodes I’ve ever seen!! It was funny, well-written, and the animation’s improving too!!! I’d give it a 9.5/10!!!\n\n#2.) “The Truth About Toby”: In this episode, Toby runs out of coal when delivering some empty cars/trucks to Cronk Scrapyards and is left stranded there. However, as Thomas, Edward, and other engines pass by, they accidentally start a rumor that Toby is going to be scrapped. For me, this episode was okay and it wasn’t really my taste. I know that there was a mixed reception for this episode, but, I’m on both sides because if Toby was really going to be sent for scrap, Sir Topham Hatt/President McFatFace would tell the other engines about it immediately and he would never scrap any of his engines that are “RESPONSIBLE, RELIABLE, AND ‘REALLY USEFUL'”!!!!!!! “USEFUL!!!!!” From the title of this episode, I would’ve expected Toby NOT being the REAL Toby back at his old tramway at East Anglia, before it was shut down and the harbor he used to work at with his classmates and the other engines know about the lesson of not spreading rumors by now, ESPECIALLY IN THE SEASON 5 EPISODE: “THOMAS AND THE RUMO(U)RS”!!!!\n\nAside from my rants about this episode, everything else was solid, especially Toby’s new UK voice. He’s now voiced by James and Stanley’s new US voice, “Rob Rackstraw”/Travis’ UK voice from “Bob the Builder”, while his original UK voice (Ben Small/Thomas and Rheneas’ old UK voicer). I think it sounds MUCH better than his old UK voice, but, his US voice (William Hope) could’ve been better and I think it’s high time we get a new US voice for Toby. Even if sounded more country/American, Toby’s UK voice is just perfect and here are clips from the episode to see what I’m saying, here!:\n\nThe other few good things about this episode is Stanley getting a speaking role again (except for a few seconds), Toby (FINALLY) going back to his old, caring, and wise personality, Toby and Henrietta’s interaction similar to “Tobias and the Half-Pariah”, and a few funny moments from this episode. Overall, this episode was average and it needed both some major and minor adjustments. I’d rate it a 5/10. Moving on to the next episode!\n\n#3.) “Lost Property”: This time, some Railway Inspectors come to the Island of Sodor and Thomas has to take them and Fatto on Annie and Clarabel. But, they come across some dilemmas during the inspection of the North Western Railway, such as some bratty children, cows on the line, and a kid pulling the emergency cable on Annie (just like in Season 18). The first time I watched this episode, I thought it was okay, but now, I think it’s pretty good. I especially love the scenes with Fatty, when he plays with a ball on a string twice and every time he does it, he ends up getting two black eyes!!!! The first time I saw that scene, I laughed at that! But, the scene where Thomas picks up the bratty kids at Dryaw Station on his branchline would’ve been more funnier, if Fatto started beating the living crap outta them, like this!:\n\nNah, too violent. Anyways, I liked this episode because the shots were amazing, Arc’s animation has done it again, and the humor was funny as always! For a pretty good episode, I’ll give it a 7.5/10.\n\n#4.) “Henry Spots Trouble”: And, of course, the bad episodes come in when we have Henry’s wussy-personality return! This time, when Henry sees Fatto’s grandchildren get chicken pox, Henry fears about getting it as well. Alright, I can seriously go on about how awful this episode was because I hate the fact that they still made Henry a coward, since Seasons 8-16, and– REALLY???!!!! HENRY’S AFRAID OF GETTING A HUMAN ILLNESS THAT CAN’T SPREAD TO ANY ENGINE OR SOME OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORT??????!!!!!!! Andrew Brenner, if you’re reading this, for the last time, HENRY IS NOT A COWARD!!! HE IS A KIND AND MATURE ENGINE THAT SOMETIMES ACTS LIKE GORDON AND JAMES AND THE REASON WHY HE HID INSIDE HIS TUNNEL IN “THE SAD STORY OF HENRY”/”COME OUT, HENRY” WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN’T WANT TO GET HIS GREEN PAINT WITH RED-STRIPES SPOILED BY THE RAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I JUST WISH THAT HENRY WAS NO LONGER A GIANT WUSS THAT IS LIKE FLUTTERSHY FROM “MLP: FIM”, EXCEPT THAT FLUTTERSHY’S A GREAT CHARACTER IN MY OPINION, EVEN IF SHE IS A COWARD AS WELL FOR A SHY SPIRIT OF KINDNESS OUT OF THE ELEMENTS OF HARMONY AND THE MANE SIX!!!!!\n\n…..*Deep Sigh* Sorry, it’s just that, I despise the fact that even if Andrew Brenner watched the classic TV series and read the “RWS”, he (the head writer himself) still made all the other writers do Sharon Miller’s way of writing the show, by still making Henry a giant worrier that worries about, every single thing he comes across. Although, there a few things I like about this episode, including the scene where Fatto accidentally rips his trousers and reveals the back of his underwear. It’s like that scene from one of the classic “Spongebob” episode, “Ripped Pants”, when Spongebob accidentally rips his pants and everyone at Goo Lagoon and his friends laugh at him, which, of course, is repeated many times, until the joke gets old. Well, yeah, I laughed at that too. All in all, I give this episode a 3.5/10, I really didn’t like it very much and it’s definitely one of this season’s worst!!\n\n#5.) “A Cranky Christmas”: Now, it’s time for the show’s annual Christmas/Holiday-themed episodes, when Cranky the Crane accidentally drops a Christmas crate for Thomas to take to Town Hall, before Thomas does the same process on what Cranky did when he slips on the icy rails at the Town Hall. Now, for this season’s first Holiday-themed episode (unlike the dreaded “WINTER HOLIDAYS” for the sake of “Political Correctness”), I didn’t like this one too much. It just didn’t feel well-written for me, either, again, even there were a few I actually liked, I don’t have a lot to say about this episode. If Cranky was worried about breaking the cargo he accidentally dropped a crate at Brendam Docks, I bet the Dock Manager would let him know about it, ahead of time!! For a below average episode, I would give it a 3/10, it wasn’t that good.\n\n#6.) “Snow Place Like Home”: In this pun-worthy title of something Carl Azuz from CNN Student News would come up with, we learn that Victor doesn’t like snow, but Kevin at the Sodor Steamworks foolishly decides to go and play in the snow. As you’d expect, things go awry, when Kevin gets caught in a pile of snow, beside the Steamworks, forcing Victor to go and look for him the snowstorm. Since this is the 3rd episode that focuses on Kevin (or as missoliverandblossom/DaWillstanator/William Grubb would say: “Sodor’s Own Jerry Lewis”) and the 2nd episode to have Victor the main character, it did have some faults, such as Kevin acting like a doofus as usual. But, it’s actually not bad. As usual, the animation’s fantastic and I do like how Victor got more character development. But, other than that, I again don’t have anything else to say about this episode, it’s a 5.5/10 for this one.\n\n#7.) “The Beast of Sodor”: As you can tell, we get ANOTHER Henry-focused episode and it’s about Henry worried about “The Abominable Snowman”/”The Yeti”, while Spencer/The Duke and Duchess of Boxford’s private engine (who is stuck on Sodor because of the Vicarstown Drawbridge closing down due to snow) teases him about it. The first time I read about this episode, I honestly thought that it was gonna suck, like other newer Henry-episodes (not the older ones from Season 1-7). But, when I first watched it, I actually enjoyed it. The plot was good, the humor was amusing, especially the part where Fatto gets chased by a bull in a field (possibly Champion from Season 4 episode: “Bulls Eyes”) and how the dramatic cue from “Spongebob” is played four times in this episode, like this scene, for example!:\n\nGotta love “Spongebob” and their music/dramatic cues from “Ren and Stimpy”!!! Overall, despite Henry’s cowardness returning once again, I actually liked it and the humor was great as always. I’d give it a 7.5/10!!\n\n#8?????) “Toad and the Whale”: As you can probably tell by the title, this episode is about Oliver the Great Western Engine’s brakevan, Toad. This time, Toad spots a whale stranded on the beach at Bluff’s Cove. He, Oliver, and the Sodor Search and Rescue Center work together to get the whale back into the ocean. Now, Toad has been getting a lot of screentime lately, ever since he and Oliver (officially) returned in Season 18 (not counting “Tale of the Brave”) and despite this is Toad’s 3rd episode focused on him, it was pretty good. Although, Oliver did act like an ignorant jerk towards Toad when Toad spotted the whale. Can you guess on how Oliver reacted? He thought that Toad was making a joke about it!!!!:\n\nI’m not even joking, here!!!! Oliver thought that Toad was kidding about an ACTUAL WHALE THAT IS DRYING AND DYING AT THE SAME TIME ON BLUFF’S COVE BEACH, WHILE HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH DUCK!!!!!! 😡 I SHOULD BE PISSED OFF, I SHOULD BE BUCKING ANGRY THAT OLIVER IS AN IGNORANT IDIOT, INSTEAD OF BEING A HARD-WORKING ENGINE THAT HAS A HOT-TEMPER WHO ESCAPED FROM SCRAP BY DOUGLAS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, at least Toad singing “Beside the Seaside” from Season 18 was one way to pay Oliver back for telling Toad his lifestory on how they came to Sodor in the first place in their returning episode, “Toad’s Adventure” from Season 18, here!:\n\nDespite my complaints, it’s still a pretty solid episode and I sure hope that in the next season, Oliver will get his own episode again, just like he did back in Seasons 3-7!! I give this episode a 7/10.\n\n#9?????) “Wild Water Rescue”: In this episode, the Search and Rescue Center celebrates its 1,000th rescue and Percy’s been given the job to take the Mayor of Sodor to present the new SS&RC bell to celebrate this wonderful occasion. But, the Devious Diesel himself strikes again when he sets Percy on a wild goose chase to pick up the Mayor at the old quarry mine, while he picks up the Mayor instead, in order to get his picture taken in the newspaper. For me, this episode was pretty average and I felt like the title could’ve been better, I think it should be called “On the Front Page”, “Stealing the Spotlight, Like Thomas Would Do”, or “Special Attraction Part II: ‘How to Get Away with Fooling Someone With an Obvious Lie, While Getting To Do the Thing You Wanted to Do, MUWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!” Also, the plot might have nothing to do with the title of this episode. Although, I do like how Kerry Shale (the UK voice of Diesel) gets to be Diesel’s new US voice, while replacing Martin T. Sherman and I can say that Kerry Shale is MUCH better than Michael Brandon and Martin’s voice for our favorite black and sly BR Class 08 shunter!!! Also, the scene where Percy practices for his picture on the newspaper were really amusing and would definitely be perfect selfies!!!\n\nWell, here comes Sodor’s next big meme. Anyway, this episode was alright and could’ve been better, a 4.5/10.\n\n#10????) “Very Important Sheep”: This episode is about “SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Or should I say, similarity to MOAB’s “Sheep” joke in his review of “Muddy Matters”, when Percy has to take some sheep to a funfair in Maithewaite Station. But, the sheep escape and cause chaos for Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel and on the Mainline. As you can tell, this episode is the third version of the ultimate worst “Thomas” episode yet, “WONKY WHISTLE”!!!!!!!! But, this time, Percy is in a hurry, rather than being a moron, like in Seasons 8-16!! Also, what really impressed me was Trevor the Traction Engine returning in CGI, except that he made a cameo in “Emily and Dash” from Season 15 and this episode, sadly. It would’ve been very fantastic, if Trevor got a speaking role in this episode, like he did in the past. Overall, this episode was a really good one and it really felt like “Wonky Whistle”, IF it was done correctly, that is with Percy as the main focus!! As soon as I give this episode an 8/10, let me make this quote from MOAB/DaWillstanator to move onto the next episode………………“SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\n#11????) “Salty All at Sea”: Not to be confused with the Season 3 episode: “All at Sea”, when Salty has been chosen to work at the Mainland harbor, much to his horror. He lets his own imaginary fantasies get the better of him, when he races around the Island/the NWR to get away from going to the Mainland, instead of having to go to the Vicarstown Drawbridge, connecting to the Mainland. Oh my Luna, I absolutely don’t like this episode because of how Salty was portrayed in it!! I can agree with many of you that Salty being afraid of travelling on the ocean is one of the dumbest explanations I’ve ever heard in my entire life, compared to “The Middle”!! Because Salty afraid of travelling, instead of going to the Mainland through the you-know-what at you-know-where, REALLY??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is “Sharon Miller-Logic” if you ask me!!!!:\n\nEXACTLY, RARITY!!!!! Besides, wouldn’t it make more sense, if Salty went to the Mainland by the Vicarstown Drawbridge???!!!! Still, I didn’t like this episode for Salty’s 3rd episode and you know what, NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!!! It’s a 2/10, it was just that awful!!!\n\n#12????) “Den and Dart”: In this one, when Mavis has an accident at Ffarqhuar Quarry, Den and Dart, the Vicarstown Dieselworks diesels, are forced to work separately. I mean by having Den take Mavis’ place, until she is repaired, while Dart helps with Mavis’ repairs. I can say that this episode is actually very good with having an interesting characterization and plot, even if we’ve seen Den and Dart separate back in Season 16 (*UGH*). It’s actually quite similar to the episode from WildNorWester’s “Sodor: The Modern Years” (spin-off of “Sodor: The Early Years”) episode, “Separation Anxiety”, which involves Ben having to work on his own, when Bill has an accident at the Containment Yard and is taken away to be repaired. Also, the music when Den shunts the trucks with confidence was very good and imagine if it was heard in the classic episodes from Seasons 1-7!!!!:\n\nIt is, without a doubt, one of the best music pieces in the CGI series and the show itself, so far!!! All in all, I really love this episode and it’s one of my favorites out of the season thus far and I would give it a 9.5/10!!\n\n#13????) “Helping Hiro”: When Thomas accidentally causes Hiro to have an accident, Thomas feels extremely guilty about it. He decides to help Hiro, by going to the same woods Hiro was found at in “Hero of the Rails” to find some of the lost engine parts that was used to restore him. The first time I saw this episode, I enjoyed it, but after seeing SamTheTrainFan’s thoughts on it on Twitter, I kind of changed my mind about it. It didn’t seem to go in any direction, really and had no moral or lesson, but I think the moral is that accidents happen and you should realize that it’s best to forgive yourself and move on with your life. But, here, it felt more or less of a sequel to “Hero of the Rails” and Thomas should know that the Sodor Steamworks has plenty of parts to repair Hiro. Other than, this episode wasn’t that good and needed some major rewriting!!! The score is a 3/10.\n\n#14 & 15?????) “Diesel’s Ghostly Christmas” (Parts 1 & 2): This episode manages to be a (yet-another) “Thomas”-version of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol”, by having Diesel play as Ebeneezer Scrooge when he refuses to be “helpful”. This causes Thomas and his friends pretend to be the “Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future”, in order to teach Diesel a lesson. Just like “Duncan the Humbug” from last season, this episode was a very fantastic adaptation of a really great Christmas classic “A Christmas Carol”!! I love the way how it’s set up, having it be a double-featured episode was a very splendid idea, it felt like an actual “MLP: FIM” episode, the animation was great as always, and I do love the part where Paxton as the Ghost of Christmas Present broke the fourth wall by saying to the audience:\n\nPAXTON: “Then I must be good at pretending.”\n\nYep, gotta love Paxton and his young, adorable, kind, goofy, and naive personality for a BR Class 08 diesel like Diesel, Arry and Bert, Sidney, and Splatter and Dodge. Although, I would admit that Diesel kinda acted gullible over the other engines pretending to be ghosts and he would’ve recognized the other engines, if he heard their voices. It might be like “Ghost Train”/”Percy’s Ghostly Trick” from Season 2 and “Thomas, Percy, and the Dragon” from Season 3 all over again, where Thomas claimed that he was pretending to be scared, when Percy pulled that prank on Thomas about him pretending to be a ghost. But, aside from that, this episode was very well-done for another “Christmas Carol” adaptation in the “Thomas” franchise and it’s like cactus190706’s “Gordon’s Christmas Carol” from 2010 and MilkTankerMedia’s 2015 Christmas special: “Making Spirits Bright: A Sodor Christmas Carol”!! I’d give this (these) episode(s) a 9/10!!\n\n#16????) “Best Engine Ever”: In this one, Emily wishes that she could be streamlined like Caitlin. Here’s the funny thing, when the Wooden Railway model of Emily’s streamlined version in her fantasy in this episode came up, it was pretty surprising to be fair. Even if I’m not a big Emily person because of how she replaced Duck, Oliver, and Donald & Douglas since Season 8 and her annoying personality, this episode is a good enough Emily episode. I really appreciate the fact that they expanded Emily and Caitlin’s personalities, instead of being (ya know) JUST ANOTHER TOY!!!!! As for the scene where Emily saves Caitlin at Ulfstead Castle was executed very well and needless to say, Emily is starting to be slightly likable, even if I’m still not an Emily fan. I would give this episode an 8/10!!\n\n#17????) “Slow Stephen”: From the episode’s title, Stephen the Rocket proves to the other engines that being slow is good sometimes, when he helps prevent Gordon from crossing the unstable Sodor Suspension Bridge. This episode is not only much better than Stephen’s last episode, “The Afternoon Tea Express” from Season 17, it’s definitely one of the best ones yet, since Stephen’s one of my favorite characters!!! Also, the Suspension Bridge collapsing was so BUCKING excellent in CGI and is way more dramatic than it was in “Calling All Engines” and “The Great Snowstorm of Sodor”!!! No offense. This episode is an 8.5/10 for this one!!\n\n#18????) “Two Wheels Good”: In this episode, after hearing the Thin Controller/Mr. Percival mentioning his bike being “Two Wheels Good”, Thomas, Spencer, and Bertie argue on which set of wheels are good, while they, along with Harold take the Duke and Duchess of Boxford to Lord Callan’s Castle. As you can tell from the plot, Lord Callan returns in CGI and I gotta say, it’s a really nice comeback and nice to see Lord Callan again after a long time of absence in the series (of course). But, his voice, Keith Wickham, is at the point when I realized that all fans were right that Keith is running out of voices for the characters he plays in the CGI series because Keith’s voice for Lord Callan sounds more like Skarloey, but with a Scottish accent. I think it’s time we add more celebrities, cast members, and guest stars in the show. Other than that, it’s a 9/10 for me.\n\n#19????) “Reds VS. Blues”: Thomas and James compete against each other, when picking up football/soccer (in the US) fans and taking them to the Dryaw Football/Soccer field. But, this (of course) leads to disastrous results. For me, this episode was pretty good, even if it is predictable from beginning to end, I especially liked the part where Fatto kicked a football/soccer ball and accidentally caused it to break a window and the part when Percy breaks the fourth wall, by stealing the narrator’s line: “And then there was trouble!”:\n\nMan, Fatto’s becoming from a strict, but a open-hearted controller of the NWR to a very funny comedian/clown. I would rate this episode a 7/10!\n\n#20????) “The Little Engine Who Raced Ahead”: This episode introduces our new toy– Uh, I mean character: Philip (no, it’s not Phil Aardman from turtlesandthomas’ “Sudrian Conflict”), an energetic and child-like diesel boxcab (played by British actor, Rasmus Hardiker). His introductory episode focuses on him winning a race against Gordon, even though he had no idea that Gordon never raced him at all. This episode was a really good one and I like Philip as a character. Sure, he can get a bit annoying now and then and later, but, he’s actually a pretty cute character and it’s nice to see more diesels introduced in the show. But, ya gotta love his personality of him acting like a little kid and I can agree that many fans can relate to Philip when they were younger. But, not everyone’s a fan of Philip. Just look on how Philip tried to interact with Daisy in EE93’s “Enterprising Engines”.:\n\nAll in all, I rate this episode an 8/10 for another fun character from Andrew Brenner!!\n\n#21????) “Philip to the Rescue”: As you can tell, Philip saves James (who is trying to prove that he’s not a showoff) from a nasty accident at the bridge/tunnel at the bottom of Gordon’s Hill. For Philip’s second episode, this episode is probably better than the last one and James’ accident was brilliantly animated. Also, I love the fact that they showed James’ driver telephoning Fatto for help, like in the older episodes. Well, at least Philip is better than other annoying and idiotic characters like Samson and Billy!! This episode is an 8.5/10.\n\n#22????) “No Help at All”: At the China Clay Pits, Bill and Ben think Timothy the Oil-Burning engine is “No Help At All” and they decide to ask Fatto to send Timothy to Brendam Docks, during the events of “Salty All at Sea” and “Den and Dart”. As how much I love Bill and Ben, I actually love this episode for many good reasons!!! It’s a nice way to have an episode take place between two different episodes and it’s a very great concept. Also, we get a remastered version of the “Down By the Docks” song from Season 6 and even if it’s not as good as the original version, it’s still another great classic “T&F” song. Here’s a comparison between the original and this episode’s version of it!!:\n\nIt’s like “The Adventure Begins”, except that was a very great 70th Anniversary special from last year!!! Also, Marion’s goofy antics kick in again for this episode and I love the ending when she’s still working and (as usual), it’s very funny!!! Overall, great episode with a returning of Bill and Ben and a remastered version of another great classic “Thomas” song!! I’d rate it a 9/10!!!\n\n#23????) “The Other Side of the World”– I mean, “The Other Side of the Mountain”: After Bertie the Bus teases Thomas about the other side of a mountain on Thomas’ branchline, Thomas is determined to figure out what’s on the other side of that mountain. You know, the mountain in this episode reminded me of the Culdee Fell Mountain Railway from the “RWS”, except that the Culdee Fell engines are the engines that we DEFINITELY need to see in the CGI and the TV series, as long as HIT tells the tale of Godred’s tragic crash correctly. This episode was a pretty good one and the crash was very unrealistic and it felt like “Toby Takes the Road” from the “RWS” all over again. But, the scene when Thomas dreams about him having wings like an airplane (reference to “Thomas and Bertie”/”Thomas and Bertie’s Great Race” from Season 1) felt like “Sticky Toffee Thomas” from Season 10, but without the goggles and helmet on his face and smokebox. Well, at least it isn’t *UGH* “JAY JAY THE BUCKING JET PLANE”!!!!!!!!!!!! Other than that, this episode was a good one and I’d give it an 8.5/10.\n\n#24????) “Thomas the Babysitter”: In this episode, Thomas has to deal with an annoying baby and his mother on his two coaches, Annie and Clarabel. For me, this episode was great and adorable at the same time, it really reminded me of “MLP: FIM” episode: “Baby Cakes” from Season 2. Both of those episodes were really adorable and “Thomas the Babysitter” felt like an actual “RWS” story that the Rev. W. Awdry or Christopher Awdry would’ve come up with, years ago. Especially the scene when the workmen (Alfred) and his wife decide to name the baby “Thomas”, just like how the Baby Cakes’ first words were this!:\n\nNow, anyone got a tissue. <:’) Anyways, it’s a 9.5/10 for such an ADORABLE, LITTLE EPISODE!!! <:’D\n\n#25????) “Rocky Rescue”: In case you haven’t read the title, this episode is about Rocky, but NOT as the main character. It’s just the ENTIRE Search and Rescue Team because after Rocky lifts Henry back onto the rails at Ulfstead Castle, he ends up having his own accident when he derails on the Mainline. Instead of (ya know) having the OTHER Breakdown Train/Crane (including Jerome and Judy from “The Adventure Begins) from Seasons 1-9, the entire S&RC has to come and rescue him, but they learn that it’s best to work together–:\n\nOkay, for me, this episode wasn’t that great and it felt like it would’ve been better, if it was written differently, like have Rocky’s accident be taken alternately. It would’ve been way better in my opinion. Still, I have nothing else to say for this episode and I’d rate it a 6.5/10, it could’ve been better.\n\n#26????): “Goodbye Fat Contoller” (“Goodbye Sir Topham Hatt”): In the (possible) season finale, Percy sees/overhears a bunch of workmen near Fatto’s office at Knapford Station. He worries that Fatto’s really going away forever and the other engines try to work hard in order to keep him from leaving permanently. But, as you’d expect, it’s all a major misunderstanding!!!! For an episode that had Percy act like a naive idiot again, it’s actually a very great one because it (once again) felt like a “RWS” story, the animation improves again, and the humor was great, too. Also, we get a really great musical recreation of the original theme for Sir Topham Hatt/The Fat Controller in his Season 1-2 and Season 5 theme!! But, during the montage when the other engines try to work hard and the Season 14 “Sir Topham Hatt” jazz song was playing, I would’ve preferred a recreation of the “Sir Topham Hatt” song from Season 5, like this!:\n\nOh well, the jazz version was more fitting anyway. Also, the scene when Fatto’s temporary office is at the shed really made me laugh and after seeing Ken Friedel’s video with the scene, while MOAB’s “T&F” Christmas Short #3 was playing, I can agree with him that those two scenes are very similar to one another.:\n\nFor the season finale, I’d rate this episode a 9.5/10! NOW, ONTO MY FINAL THOUGHTS FOR THIS SEASON!!!\n\nOverall, is this season better than Season 18? Well, the answer is “YES”!! There were a lot of good episodes, nice references, funny jokes, and great recreations of original songs from the show!! Also, the animation from Arc Productions has improved BIG TIME!!!!! However, there are a few episodes that were unlikable or mediocre, including one of Henry’s episodes, “Salty All at Sea”, etc.. But, that doesn’t stop me from loving this season!!! It’s definitely an improvement over the last season!! Heck, the show itself is improving from the crappy writing we’ve gotten from Seasons 8-16, but I would’ve preferred more returning characters, but I’m happy over what we’ve gotten this time!!! This gives me my final score for Season 19 of “Thomas & Friends” a 9.5/10 for not only one of the best seasons in the CGI era, one of the best “T&F” seasons yet!!!!\n\nNow that that’s settled, we’ll look forward to Season 20 this year and the next special this year, “The Great Race”!!! Let me know in the comments below on what your thoughts are on this season. As always, I’m The Detective Librarian and I’ll see you in my 110th Review Special next time for Rainbow Dash’s “Birthaversary”!!!! Toodles!!!! 😉"
