        "text": "If there are episodes that are scrutinised more than Toby's, they're probably Henry's, as his character change has been one of the most drastic and, seemingly, permanent. But the question is: can they actually make that work for this episode?\n\n\"It's a kid's show\". This phrase has been met with disgust whenever anyone mentions a bad animated show/film because people think that kids don't deserve quality entertainment. I've been known to be highly critical of that phrase in recent years as well, but I feel the need to use it for this episode. Why? Because there's a difference between using something as an excuse and using it as a defence.\n\nNo matter how much fans of Thomas & Friends (the show, not necessarily the Railway Series) argue the point against trolls or those who have an opposing opinion, the simple fact of the matter is this: Thomas & Friends is a kids' show. Always has been, always will be. Yes, there is a far reaching appeal to it, and that can't be denied and shouldn't be sneered at, but the primary focus of any episode is how it can appeal to children. And I think this one does that rather well as it understood something very important: the difference between talking down to an audience and talking directly to an audience. That's why, I believe, this episode has succeeded where series 9-16, as well as Steamie Stafford, failed.\n\nYes, the general theme is Henry just being scared of getting chicken pox, but kids can relate to this very easily. There are new things that they know little to nothing about, and that will scare them. So the basic moral of \"___ is nothing to be scared of\" is a very reassuring one, especially when it comes to something that they will experience further down the road. Yes, the catalyst to the fear here is only chicken pox, but they can take the basic lesson that's taught here with them so they can feel reassured later in life; whether they're facing a new school, college or university. Heck, even doctor and dentist appointments, or whatever new experiences a child faces.\n\nThis, to me, is what makes the franchise timeless. It's not the models, or the CG, it's having relatable characters and teaching relatable morals that can stand the test of time, and can be learnt by all ages. That is what a true children's show is truly capable of, and this episode, and this team, understand that wonderfully. It's also the reason I get annoyed when people use \"it's a kid's show\" as an excuse when terrible ones are created, but I digress.\n\nWith all that said, is the episode perfect? Nope. It does feel strange that Stephen and Bridget (nice to see them back, and referring to their grandfather as such) would be allowed out with chicken pox. If there were other kids around them at the station, they would be at risk of catching them. Although using Winston again was nice. He's not being used as an inspection vehicle per se, rather the Fat Controller's personal rail-car, but any opportunity to see him again is fine by me. It also keeps the pox from spreading on their travels.\n\nAlso, that near miss with James was a bit ridiculous. Granted, it did up the entertainment value slightly, and I can understand that they did it to emphasise the danger of Henry going backwards with the train, but it still looked pretty stupid\n\nDiscounting those things though, this episode was, for me, rather entertaining, especially the scenes at Kellsthorpe Road with the painter and Wellsworth with the Fat Controller. The painter gag really had to rely on the animation to work, and the animators did a brilliant job on that end.\n\nSpeaking of which, the animation here is great. There's not really much I can say without constantly repeating what I've been saying since Arc took over. They're brilliant, but they have their flaws. Simple as that, really.\n\nThe voice acting, again, is pretty spot on. Even though James' line delivery by Keith Wickham was really weird, he did an excellent job with Henry, displaying a genuine fear in his elderly sounding voice.\n\nI also believe that, this series, Matt Wilkinson is by far and away the most improved actor on the cast this series. Cranky and Spencer sound a lot more mature and now Butch seems to have had the same treatment. His Scouse accent is a lot more prominent, and it's a bit deeper. It feels like Sharon Miller is giving him more direction this series, and it really shows.\n\nFan Reaction\n\nThe Mad Controller's Corner\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSo we have a new writer and another episode where Thomas is the focus? And it's also a very railway-centric episode. An interesting combination, but how will it fare?\n\nIn a word? Brilliantly. If there's one type of episode I really like, it's those that have railway operations at the forefront. This is no exception, only here it goes slightly beyond.\n\nIt's basically the quintessential Thomas & Friends episode: engine does a job, things go wrong, engine proves themselves. It's also really entertaining and it has a lot of heart.\n\nI also like that the railway inspectors returned. It seems like this is becoming a yearly thing, like the four Christmas-themed episodes and the six direct-to-DVD episodes, and I'm all for that. It just makes a lot of sense that they'd want to visit yearly in order to ensure it's running as it should.\n\nAs for the kids? While I do like how they were portrayed as it does feel real to life (although, in fairness, it is only a small minority that act this way), I think that more should have been done to give them some sort of punishment, or something to regret their behaviour. Having the Fat Controller try and defend them really didn't sit well with me, especially since that also happens in reality, only it's the parents that are the ones on the defensive. I know he was only trying to keep the inspectors happy, but wouldn't him at least giving them a talking to have shown the inspectors that he was really in charge?\n\nThat said, the ending in itself was quite nice. Giving the whole railway a \"glowing report\" did seem like a bit of an overreaction just for returning a watch, but it was made clear that it meant quite a lot to the inspector. If they'd have said that he'd give the Ffarquhar branch a glowing report, or just Thomas, Annie and Clarabel, it would have made more sense.\n\nThat said, if the episode had just been a regular story about the railway being inspected, I don't think I'd have liked it too much as it runs the risk of being rather boring (and, like I've said, we've been down this road before). However, they threw in quite a bit of humour throughout. Some of it visual, some physical, but pretty much everything hits the mark for me. It really helped to keep the investment up.\n\nAs usual, the animation is amazing. The scenery around the branch line is absolutely gorgeous, and I like how it's being treated as an actual branch line, rather than throwing random assets together and calling it a \"branch line\".\n\nAlso, the glossy look of the models really shone here, especially in this shot. No detail is left out of the reflection and it just looks... lovely.\n\nAnd, as usual, the voice acting is excellent. John Hasler seems to be getting better and better as Thomas; it's like he's been voicing the character for years, he feels that natural. That said, Teresa Gallagher (Annie and Clarabel) and Keith Wickham (The Fat Controller) did an excellent job as well.\n\nFan Reaction\n\nThe Mad Controller's Corner\n\nFinal Thoughts"
