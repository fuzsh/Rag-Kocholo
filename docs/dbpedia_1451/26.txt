Congratulations to Mark Dempsey (captain) and the Junior Gaelic football on their victory in Silverpark, Stillorgan last Tuesday, March 1st. This game was a lot tighter than the result suggests, and we were relieved when the referee’s final whistle blew.

It really was a game of two halves as we looked to be in control and cruising in the first half Goals from Sam Kilroy, Shane Van Zaydum, James Clancy and Mark Dempsey (all 4th Year) build lead with the score at half-time 4-9 to 1-2.

Although Luke Murphy (4th Year) scored a great goal at the commencement of the 2nd half, this signified the end of our dominance. Cois Life really showed their resilience and character gaining confidence and momentum on every score and capitalising on every mistake we made. If it wasn’t for some great last gasp defending by Ernie O’Brien and Gavin Donohue (both 4th Year) as well several spectacular saves from goalkeeper Ronan Ffrench (3rd Year) the game may have slipped away from us.

We would like to thank Mr. O’Brien, Mr Grant, and Robert Kenny (Class of 2021) and Mr Pat Smith for organising and coaching the team.
