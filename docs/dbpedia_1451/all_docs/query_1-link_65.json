However, UCD continued to battle until the final whistle sounded, closing the deficit to six points at full-time. A man of the match performance from Darragh Canavan, with significant contributions from brother Ruairí, ultimately sealed the competition for the Belfast side.\n\nIn this year’s Electric Ireland GAA Higher Education Rising Stars 2024 Football Team of the Year, Sigerson Cup Champions, UU, have seven players included on the team. Beaten finalists UCD have five representatives on the team. Beaten semi-finalists, University of Limerick (UL) feature twice on the team while Maynooth University have a single player included.\n\n2024 Electric Ireland GAA Higher Education Rising Stars Football Team of the Year\n\n1.

The determination and skill on display in this year’s Electric Ireland Higher Education GAA Championships has been immensely enjoyable to watch, and the players named here serve as fantastic representatives of their third level institutions. We look forward to celebrating their achievements at a formal ceremony later in the year.”\n\nSarah Sharkey, Group Sponsorship & PR Manager, Electric Ireland, commented: “We are delighted to announce the 2024 Electric Ireland GAA Higher Education Rising Stars Football Team of the Year and are looking forward to being able to recognise these players’ outstanding performances at the annual Electric Ireland Higher Education GAA Rising Stars Awards Ceremony. Our ongoing commitment to these Championships has been a journey of excitement and inspiration, fuelled by the players whose dynamic performances have captivated audiences all season long.”\n\nElectric Ireland’s #FirstClassRivals campaign continues to celebrate the unexpected alliances that are formed by County rivals coming together in pursuit of some of the most coveted titles in the GAA when they play together as teammates during the Higher Education Championships."
