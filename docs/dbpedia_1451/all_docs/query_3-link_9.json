        "text": "MANCHESTER UNITED arrived in Perth, hoping for a nice start to their pre-season tour in Australia.\n\nBut it took a turn for the worse after a member of staff was admitted to hospital.\n\nWho is Mark Dempsey?\n\nDempsey hails from Crumpsall in the Manchester area and was born on January 14, 1964.\n\nHe joined United's academy in 1980, going onto spend six years at the club - but only ever made one league appearance.\n\nHe later starred for Swindon, Sheffield United, Chesterfield, Rotherham and Macclesfield before ending his career in 1994.\n\nIt took the former midfielder some time to get into coaching, starting out in Man United's youth set up.\n\nAfter heading to Tromso for work in 2009, he joined up with another ex-Devil in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Molde.\n\nHe followed the Norwegian to Cardiff City before returning to Scandinavia for more managerial opportunities - the first of which came at Haugesund in Norway.\n\nAfter spells at Djurgarden, Start and Kongsvinger as manager and a return to Molde as assistant, Dempsey was reunited with Solskjaer and Man United as first team coach in December last year.\n\nWhat is Dempsey's condition in hospital?\n\nIt was reported that a member of United's travelling staff had been taken to hospital with a 'suspected overdose', but it is now understood that Dempsey was admitted due to exhaustion."
