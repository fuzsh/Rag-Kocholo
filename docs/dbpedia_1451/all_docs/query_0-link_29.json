A former player, Chris took over from Jean Tigana after he was dismissed late in the 2002-03 season and helped secure the club as a Premier League team. To date, he holds the club record for the youngest manager to take charge of the first team.\n\nCareer[]\n\nBefore Fulham[]\n\nChris had an accomplished playing career in which he represented Wales on 31 occasions, ending his career as captain of Fulham where he was forced to retire following injuries sustained in a car crash at the start of 2001.\n\nFulham (2002-2007)[]\n\nAfter announcing his premature retirement from playing in October 2002, Chris duly joined the coaching staff under Jean Tigana the same month having already completed his coaching badges.\n\nAfter a run of poor results, Jean Tigana was sacked on 17 April 2003 with five games of the 2002-03 season remaining. Chris was named as caretaker manager to oversee the tailend of the campaign, winning three matches and securing a 14th placed finish for the Whites.\n\nIt was announced on 15 May 2003 that Chris had officially been appointed as Fulham's manager. Despite his relatively young age of 32, he had beaten other more experienced candidates such as Klaus Toppmöller and George Burley to the post.\n\nDespite many pundits tipping Fulham to get relegated in 2003-04 and for Chris to be sacked, he had a good start to his managerial career by achieving a 9th placed finish.\n\nChris managed to attain mid-table security over the next two seasons, and this was despite losing key players such as Louis Saha, Edwin van der Sar & Steed Malbranque amongst others. However, 2006-07 would be his last season in charge of Fulham. Despite a reasonably good start to the season, results fell away and the club fell into a relegation battle after only one win in eighteen matches. Chris was sacked on 10 April 2007.\n\nAfter Fulham[]\n\nHaving been recommended by fellow Welshman John Toshack, Chris moved abroad to manage Real Sociedad on 4 July 2007; the Spanish side had recently been relegated from the top tier of Spanish football, La Liga. However, it wasn't a great spell in charge and Chris resigned from the job only several months later.\n\nHe then returned to England to manage Coventry City in the Championship in February 2008 and stayed at the club for a little over two years before he was sacked following a 19th placed finish. Another short spell abroad would follow, this time at Cypriot club AEL, but his time there would be short with another resignation after a few months owing to financial difficulties at the club.\n\nFollowing the tragic death of Wales manager and former player Gary Speed, Chris was appointed as Wales manager in January 2012. He eventually led his country to their best FIFA rankings they had achieved a the time, 8th. He also led them to their first ever major tournament in nearly 60 years, qualifying for the 2016 European Championships. After finishing top of their group, they progressed to the Semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Portugal.\n\nUnfortunately, Wales failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and Chris resigned as manager on 17 November 2017. Two days later, he was confirmed as the new manager of struggling Sunderland, a club with a large fanbase that found themselves in the relegation zone of the Championship. Despite his best efforts, the club was in turmoil and with results not improving, he was relived of his duties in April 2018.\n\nChris then moved abroad again, this time to China to manage Hebei where he spent a solitary season, before having a brief time out of the game.\n\nIn January 2022, Chris was appointed as manager of Atromitos, a Greek top tier side. He spent over year and a half with the club before he resigned in October 2023.\n\nFulham Statistics[]\n\nSeason Competition P W D L F A GD Win % 2002-03 Premier League 5 3 1 1 6 4 +2 60% FA Cup 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --% League Cup 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --% Total 5 3 1 1 6 4 +2 60% 2003-04 Premier League 38 14 10 14 52 46 +6 37% FA Cup 6 3 2 1 9 5 +4 50% League Cup 1 0 0 1 0 1 -1 0% Total 45 17 12 16 61 52 +9 38% 2004-05 Premier League 38 12 8 18 52 60 -8 32% FA Cup 5 2 2 1 8 5 +3 40% League Cup 4 3 0 1 10 5 +5 75% Total 47 17 10 20 70 70 0 36% 2005-06 Premier League 38 14 6 18 48 58 -10 37% FA Cup 1 0 0 1 1 2 -1 0% League Cup 2 1 0 1 7 7 0 50% Total 41 15 6 20 56 67 -11 37% 2006-07 Premier League 33 7 14 12 34 52 -18 21% FA Cup 4 2 1 1 9 9 0 50% League Cup 1 0 0 1 1 2 -1 0% Total 38 9 15 14 44 63 -19 24% Total 176 61 44 71 237 256 -19 35%\n\nCareer honours[]\n\nIndividual\n\n• Championship Manager of the Month\n\nWinner (1): February 2009\n\nFulham squads[]\n\n2002-03 squad 1. van der Sar 2.
