        "text": "“History was created in Manchester United football circles today,” wrote football journalist Alf Clarke (later to be a victim of the Munich Air Disaster) in the Manchester Evening Chronicle on 3 September 1938. “This afternoon, there are no fewer than five United teams on duty. They are the senior side, Central League XI, ‘A’ team, MUJAC first team and MUJAC second XI... no club in the country is better served with junior players than Manchester United.”\n\nJohnny Carey, Stan Pearson, John Aston and Charlie Mitten were among the players discovered by Rocca, a quartet that would go on to be cornerstones of Sir Matt Busby’s first great United team. In 1938/39, playing in the Chorlton Amateur League, United’s youth team – featuring Pearson, Mitten and Aston – fizzed in an eye-popping 223 goals. After a decade of yo-yoing fortunes in the league brought promotion back to the top flight in 1937/38, Gibson’s promise was taking shape.\n\n1940s and 1950s\n\nWar put everything on hold, but the cessation of hostilities spiked the need for players, particularly younger ones. So many had been lost to the game through death, injury or age. Encouragement was required to finesse the skills of the new generation. A post-War FA County Youth Cup had been a start, but things really took off when FA secretary Stanley Rous green lit a knockout competition for 15 to 18-year-olds, and, in 1952, the FA Youth Cup was born.\n\n1970s, 1980s and 1990s\n\nThough the 1970s and 1980s were not barren decades – Arthur Albiston, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes, Clayton Blackmore among the notable names – it was the arrival of Alex Ferguson that restored the picture painted by Busby. “I have always considered the player you produce better than the one you buy,” he averred, seeing the future in 1992’s Six Years at United. He acutely understood Busby’s modus operandi, the connections, or the ‘lifeblood’ as he put it.\n\nUnder the watchful gaze of Collyhurst-born Brian Kidd, European Cup winner of ‘68 and that legend of youth development, Eric Harrison, the fabled class of ‘92, boosted by the expanded focus Ferguson’s era had brought, yielded a first Youth Cup since 1964. And what riches. Beckham, Giggs, Scholes, the Nevilles, Butt – a glorious reboot of that 1950s dream, and the eventual realisation of Busby’s European Cup quest, capped by glorious Treble season. And while 1998 brought the start of the greatest campaign in the club’s history, it also saw the relaunch and rebranding of our youth development set-up, now known as the Manchester United Academy.\n\nThe production line of great young players continued, with homegrown talents a core part of all 13 of United’s Premier League titles from 1993 through to 2013. As well as the legendary Class of ’92, players like Wes Brown, John O’Shea and Darren Fletcher came through the ranks to become champions.\n\n2000s, 2010s and 2020s\n\nThe Reds have won the FA Youth Cup three times since 2000 - in 2003, 2011 and 2022 - extending the club's record tally to 11.\n\nA player from our youth development levels has been included in each and every one of our first-team matchday squads since October 1937, a remarkable sequence unmatched in football and one which we are rightly proud of.\n\nAs well on-pitch support, players in our Academy receive a rounded education, providing them with the necessary skills to succeed in football or in careers away from the sport. Countless graduates are now experiencing successful broadcast careers, such as Wes Brown, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes.\n\nOthers, such as Mark Dempsey and Paul McShane, form part of our Academy coaching staff, who continue to nurture young players with the aim of guiding them to fulfil their potential.\n\nAs we look to the future, our dedication to individual player development remains unwavering, as the most exciting prospects from in the UK and around the world dream of playing for Manchester United Football Club."
