        "text": "By DOUG IRELAND, Journal Sports\n\nBeginning his playing days in junior high during World War II, riding for an hour in the back of a pickup truck to start college at Northwestern State, and finishing eight decades in organized basketball helping choose officials for the NCAA’s Division I Final Four, Tynes Hildebrand has lived an unparalleled career.\n\nPlayer, coach, athletics director, officials observer. From the 1940s until a decade ago, the 93-year-old Hildebrand has been immersed in his favorite game, the only sport he could play growing up in rural Sabine Parish and attending tiny Florien High School.\n\nHe has counted among his friends and colleagues legends such as longtime USA Olympic coach Henry Iba of Oklahoma State, national-championship coaches John Wooden (UCLA), Indiana’s Bob Knight, UTEP’s Don Haskins, and Louisiana icons including Dale Brown, Fred Hobdy, Billy Allgood, Lenny Fant and Benny Hollis. Hildebrand, Knight and Haskins helped Iba pick the country’s 1972 Olympic team.\n\nAs head coach at Northwestern State, Hildebrand helped found the Louisiana Association of Basketball Coaches half a century ago. As the LABC celebrates that anniversary with its 50th Annual Awards Banquet Saturday, May 4 in Baton Rouge, it’s fitting that Hildebrand will become only the fourth recipient of the organization’s Don Landry Award since that elite recognition for long-term impact and service to the game in Louisiana was created in 1998.\n\nIt’s named for the founding father of the LABC. Hildebrand, now living with his wife of 72 years, Julia, in Flower Mound, Texas, after more than a decade spent at The Oaks retirement community in Shreveport, is touched to receive it.\n\n“Don Landry’s the one who has done so much for Louisiana basketball. He involved so many people and did so very much, and got schools around the state invested in the LABC and building our game around the state,” said Hildebrand. “We had such good times with great fellowship that people wanted to be included. So to receive an award with his name on it is a distinct honor.”\n\nAnother iconic figure in state basketball history, LABC Hall of Famer and 2023 Mr. Louisiana Basketball recipient Mike McConathy, has a far-reaching understanding of Hildebrand’s impact. McConathy’s father Johnny, the No. 5 pick in the 1951 NBA Draft, was a senior at Northwestern State when Hildebrand joined H. Lee Prather’s Demons. The younger McConathy was a prep All-American at Bossier City’s Airline High, recruited nationally but ultimately choosing Louisiana Tech over his father’s alma mater. Later, he was tabbed to be the Demons’ head coach in 1999 and in 23 seasons became the state’s all-time winningest coach.\n\n“His connections to every aspect of the game in our state, and beyond, from a player to a coach to international play, to referees, he has run the whole gamut. That’s rare, anywhere, and he’s one of a kind in Louisiana,” said McConathy.\n\nHildebrand spent 16 seasons (1965-80) as head coach at his alma mater, Northwestern State, where he posted 191 wins. He retired, and was named the LABC’s Mr. Basketball a year later, but returned in 1983 as the Demons’ athletics director for 13 years, working at half-salary in a financially-strapped department that under his guidance developed into one of the more successful in the Southland Conference on, and off, the field of competition.\n\nAs a coach and administrator, Hildebrand was an outstanding mentor. Among his prize pupils: Demons’ guard and future longtime Notre Dame basketball coach Mike Brey along with athletic department interns Greg Burke, his successor as AD who held that post for the next 26 years, and Greg Sankey, now in his 10th year as the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference.\n\nHildebrand was enshrined in the LABC’s Hall of Fame in 1992 for his coaching career. A year following his retirement as AD, Hildebrand became one of the NCAA’s Division I officials evaluators in 1997, a role he fulfilled for 17 seasons. In 2006, he became one of the inaugural four NCAA regional officiating supervisors.\n\nGenerations of coaches, players and fans – and certainly, officials – have felt the influence. He says it’s been more than an equal trade.\n\n“Louisiana basketball has been my life,” he said. “The Hildebrand family has lived a Louisiana basketball life. And it’s been good to us.”\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nIt’s finally time to put the topic of forward-facing sonar to rest. Last week I gave a great breakdown on this topic. Now, I’m tired of all the debates of banning this new technology. I’m tired of hearing all the whining from anglers who either can’t master it or just refuse to learn it. It’s time to put this topic to rest and move forward!\n\nThis controversy is no different than any other issues that have risen in other sports. This is not about some drug that is enhancing an angler’s ability to perform and fish better. It has nothing to with any one angler having a bigger advantage over another. Why? Because every angler has the right and access to the same technology as the next one.\n\nThe problem with this controversy is the fact that it’s not the young anglers who are complaining. It’s the guys who have helped build the sport of professional bass fishing into what it is today. It’s the legends of the sport and guys who have made a good living fishing with B.A.S.S. or Major League Fishing (MLF).\n\nThey don’t like the fact that today’s young anglers are stepping out onto the big stage and not just competing with them, but winning tournaments. They feel that forward-facing sonar is the only reason this is happening. So rather than get on board and get better with it, some have chosen to file complaints.\n\nI relate to this topic the same way I had to become a better hitter in order to get the opportunity to get drafted by a Major League Baseball team.\n\nOne thing that separates an average hitter from a great hitter is the ability to hit the curve ball. This one thing has kept more baseball players out of the highest level than any other baseball skill.\n\nUntil I got better and learned how to go with the pitch, I was only an average hitter. But I spent two years of my college career getting better with countless hours hitting in a batting cage and working off a batting tee. This was hours of what is referred to as soft toss, programming my body to hit the curve ball and go with the pitch.\n\nI didn’t go and complain to Major League Baseball and push for a “no curve ball rule!” No, I worked at it and got better by putting in the work! This same effort needs to be applied by these fishing pros. Instead of using the offseason to go hunting, it might be a good career move to get on the lake and get better using forward-facing sonar.\n\nHere’s some food for thought. If the older anglers on tour were winning with this new technology, would anyone be complaining about it? If Rick Clunn or Kevin Van Dam was kicking everyone’s butt with it, I’ll bet a dollar-to-a-donut that all pros would be figuring out how to get better with forward-facing sonar!\n\nSo, for all the anglers that just can’t seem to grasp this new forward-facing technology, you’ve got two choices: either get better with it or load your boats and go home. You cannot stop technology in an age where a new computer today is out of date before the end of the month you bought it.\n\nIt’s like any other advancements in the bass fishing world, forward-facing sonar is here to stay. Stop waiting on B.A.S.S. or MLF to make rule changes to accommodate the older anglers. In the words of my team partner who got tired of my negative complaining, “Shut up and fish, you big baby!”\n\nContact Steve at sgraf26@yahoo.com\n\nI remember exactly where I was three years ago when my financial world changed. No, I didn’t win the lottery or get a visit from the IRS.\n\nInstead, I was at the concession stand at Disch-Falk Field on the campus of the University of Texas for a baseball game and all I wanted was a soft pretzel (easy on the salt).\n\nI whipped out my wallet from my back right pocket, pulled out the cash before seeing the look on the concessionaire’s face, which basically said “We’ve got another rube!”\n\nInstead, I was actually told “Sir, we don’t accept cash.”\n\nWHAT?!?!? Literally, my money was no good at Disch-Falk Field, so I was left with no choice. Out came the debit card.\n\nI’d rather cut my toenails with a hacksaw than pay for singular items with a debit card. To me, it’s like writing a check to the Handee Mart on Tech Drive in Ruston for $0.76. (Yes, I did that in 1981 and I am still not proud of it.)\n\nUntil the Great Pretzel Incident in Austin, I had managed to avoid this financial blasphemy. And I have pretty much steered clear of it since. But I know it’s out there, mainly because I see it all the time at high school athletic events — and I go to about 100 of those a year.\n\nThe combination of working at a school and being a sports writer allows me the ability to walk right through the admission gate instead of having to scan a QR code or download an app. For that, I am one thankful dude.\n\nAll of this comes up because there is a bill in the Louisiana Legislature – House Bill 5 – that would require colleges to accept cash at sporting events. If needed, I am availabe for hire to be the chief lobbyist for this bill.\n\nIt’s being sponsored by Rep. Charles Owen of Rosepine and if my man Charlie wanted to have a real impact, he would expand that to include high schools. For all I care, just keep going from there.\n\nLook, I get it. There are all kinds of reasons/excuses that they will give you for being “cashless.” Seems like it started with Covid, when apparently if two people touched the same dollar bill, instant death was sure to ensue.\n\nThere is also the ol’ nefarious Booster Club member, who gets sticky fingers behind the popcorn machine and walks out with pockets stuffed when it’s all said and done. LSU sent a note to the House saying that the bill could lead to a $75,000 annual loss of revenue for concession companies. So we need to be inconvenienced because you can’t make proper change for a $20?\n\nAnd when all else fails, they’ll tell you that being cashless is “for convenience of our patrons.” LSU also argued that it will slow down concession lines. Sure, if everybody is at the ready with the chip card and taps the machine at the right time, that would speed things up.\n\nNow come back to the real world.\n\nIt’s particularly troubling at high school games, where internet access for running credit cards can be sketchy. And wait until you see how the line gets backed up because MeeMaw has no idea what she has to do just to get inside the gate so see can watch little Trey.\n\nThe University of New Orleans suggested some concession stands should require reverse ATMs, which allow somebody to deposit cash and receive a temporary debit card. That’s taking inconvenience to a new level. Think MeeMaw will go for that?\n\nThere is only one solution – have both. There’s nothing wrong with have the ability to pay online for game admittance or for two hot dogs and a bag of popcorn. Tap away with that chip card and the guy behind you will appreciate getting to the front of the line a little quicker.\n\nBut as long as someone is not counting out pennies to pay for a pizza slice, let the people who prefer cash still have the same opportunities as all of you chip-card-toting Millennials.\n\nBefore the pretzels gets stale.\n\nContact JJ at johnjamesmarshall@yahoo.com\n\nBy JOHN JAMES MARSHALL, Journal Sports\n\nThere’s been something of a revolution in golf that has nothing to do with equipment, technology or even LIV.\n\nAnd you may not have even noticed it — unless you are finding it more difficult to get a tee time at your local municipal course.\n\nPublic golf – they like the term “municipal” a little more – is on the rise across the nation and certainly in the Shreveport-Bossier area.\n\n“We are probably up 30 percent in the last few years,” says Querbes Park pro Nathan Barrow.\n\n“At least,” says Huntington Park pro Reg Adams, when asked about Barrow’s projection. “It’s just been up, up and up the last four or five years.”\n\nIt’s being called “Munaissance” and what is truly bringing about this revival is that cities are re-investing in their public courses.\n\nThat has certainly happened here. In the last 10 years, both Huntington and Querbes have undergone major renovations, thanks to bond issues. Greens have been re-done. Drainage has been improved. New clubhouses at both facilities.\n\nIn addition, the Querbes Park Foundation has played a major role in improvements at course when it was struck by major damage from a storm last June. Querbes is celebrating its 100th year in 2024. Huntington opened in 1969 as a private course before the city purchased it in the early 1970s.\n\n“The city realizes that we need to keep investing in this journey to try to attract more golfers, more kids, more families,” Adams says.\n\nThere has always been the mental caricature of the “muni monster” golfer — hat on backwards. Shirt untucked. Music playing in the cart.\n\nWhich is exactly what is helping to feed this transformation in golf. Private courses have always had their place and it seemed as though municipal courses only got the leftovers. These days, municipal courses thrive from having clientele who enjoy a more casual version of the game.\n\nNow, it seems as though municipal golf, once seen as dying on the vine in some locales, has found its place as well.\n\n“It’s just a little more relaxed,” says Adams. “Not only are there guys who are all about golf, but we are getting blue collar guys and boys and girls and people coming back who may have stopped playing for whatever reason. More women. More families. We are welcoming them all.”\n\nGolf, in general, can be expensive … and then there is the cost of country club golf. Without doing an in-depth analysis, price increases seem to have held steady more at public courses than private, where it seems as though membership is never far away from another dues increase and/or assessment.\n\nFor years, there was a net-zero growth in golf. There has always been a new influx of golfers, but there was also those who stopped playing for whatever reason. Now, there is still that influx, but they are also retaining those who they might have previously lost.\n\n“When I first got in the business, you never saw a big increase,” Adams says. “You had a lot of new golfers that came in, but you had the same number who left. If you were a young single guy and played a lot of golf and then you got married, well, priorities change.”\n\nBoth Barrow and Adams agree that the social aspect of municipal golf is a huge factor.\n\n“With today’s generation, it’s an inclusive atmosphere now,” Barrow says. “Everybody is included at a muni course. Everybody is eligible, everybody is welcome. We have music playing at the clubhouse when you walk up. It’s a more inviting and welcoming atmosphere and if it’s their intro into golf, this is where they will stay.”\n\nAdams points to a number of programs by the PGA that have also had an effect. For example, PGA Hope has been targeted for veterans and he has seen remarkable results at Huntington.\n\n“It’s just taken off like gangbusters,” he says. “You get veterans to come with other veterans and that way they can socialize together.”\n\n“People are also looking at the health benefits,” Barrow says. “A lot of people want to carry (their bag) walk and that is promoted at municipal golf courses whereas maybe not at a private club.”\n\nBarrow is also the pro at one of the most walkable courses around. “Seems like everybody in town lives 10 minutes away from Querbes,” Adams says. “It’s easy to get there and easy to play nine holes after work.”\n\nBarrow says Querbes has doubled its revenue over the last six years. Both courses are finding more ways to get golfers to the courses, whether that is with Thursday Night Scrambles or simply sending out email blasts on what is being served at lunch in the restaurant.\n\n“You only have so many golfers in the golfing pool,” Adams says. “Some of them are members at country clubs because they see the benefit and they can afford it. But if something happens and they can’t afford that, they can still come play golf at the city courses.”\n\n“It’s authentic golf,” Barrow says. “It’s golf in its purest form.”\n\nContact JJ at johnjamesmarshall@yahoo.com\n\nO.J. Simpson died last week. He was already dead to a large portion of Americans since his arrest for the brutal June 12, 1994 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, waiter Ron Goldman.\n\nHe was taken into custody at his home in Brentwood, Cal., at the end of his infamous freeway ride that captivated the nation’s TV viewers as thousands of Los Angeles residents gathered roadside and on overpasses to watch the spectacle. The driver of the white Ford Bronco, his USC football teammate Al Cowlings, told police during the low-speed pursuit that Simpson, huddled in the back seat, had a gun and was at times holding it to his head.\n\nDuring the ride, Simpson’s lawyer Robert Kardashian (the first Kardashian you ever heard of) held a press conference to read a letter from his client that said, “Don’t feel sorry for me … I’ve had a great life, great friends. Please think of the real O.J. and not this lost person.”\n\nYou know this already. You know the football great was acquitted of murder charges in the longest trial in California history, January-October 1995. You know the verdict disgusted much of America, and provided vindication to others, chiefly Blacks who believed the justice system was unfair and prejudiced. You know the L.A. police department had a long-standing record of corruption and misconduct, and that undermined Simpson’s prosecution.\n\nBut here’s what only about 500 people know: the poignant words of his Buffalo Bills’ quarterback, Shreveport-Woodlawn football hero Joe Ferguson, at the end of his acceptance speech at the 1994 Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Natchitoches.\n\nThe induction was just a couple of weeks after Simpson’s arrest. Ferguson had fielded plenty of calls from media asking for his reaction. Most notably, he was a guest on TV’s hottest news interview show, Larry King Live on CNN, and as anyone who knew Ferguson at all would expect, Joe was cautious, concerned for his former teammate, sickened by the crime and agonized by what seemed undeniable. It still does.\n\nNobody asked Joe about O.J. at the Hall of Fame press conference. Wasn’t the time or place. The weekend was about celebrating Ferguson’s incredible career, from the mind-boggling days at Woodlawn to a stellar college performance with the Arkansas Razorbacks, then 12 NFL seasons, seven in Buffalo, the first five with Simpson, including Joe’s rookie year of 1973 when the Juice got loose to set the NFL single-season rushing record with 2,003 yards in 14 games.\n\nFerguson’s LSHOF induction class was star-studded: Grambling football and pro wrestling legend Ernie “Big Cat” Ladd, Lady Techster and Wade Trophy winner Pam Kelly, Grambling basketball coaching great Fred Hobdy, and Denver Broncos’ sack master Rich Jackson of New Orleans joined him as headliners.\n\nThe biggest part of the audience that night came from Shreveport-Bossier to cheer on Joe. His graceful speech celebrated those precious times at Woodlawn, what he understandably called the most fun he ever had playing football.\n\nHe was the last speaker. The mutual admiration in the room, with the partisan crowd, was palpable. Then he wrapped up his remarks the way he rolled – never sidestepping anything, and on this night, not the elephant in the room.\n\n“Before I go,” Ferguson said, “I need to say something. I know you’ve all seen the news over the last couple of weeks about the horrible situation in Los Angeles. I’ve been asked about it a lot, and it’s very confusing, and very sad. I truly don’t know what to say, except this.\n\n“I’d like to ask you a favor tonight – please pray for my friend, O.J.”\n\nWhat an exit line. Thirty years later, it epitomizes Ferguson’s class, loyalty, and grace.\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nDennis “Skinny” Hallmark passed something along to me that was special. So special in fact that what I learned on that visit to Alabama with him in 1992 ignited a passion I had never felt before or since. He guided me on my first turkey hunt and when I drew a bead on a gobbler and he dropped, I was hooked just as solidly as if I had mainlined a narcotic.\n\nFor the next 20-something years, hunting wild turkeys in spring was my passion and not only did I finally learn how to do it on my own, I have had special opportunities to pass along my love for the sport to several other rookies like I was that day in Alabama.\n\nSarah Hebert was the first. On opening day of turkey season for youth several years later, I was asked to do for Sarah what Skinny had done for me. In other words, I was her guide for a hunt on what was then the Jackson-Bienville wildlife management area. I was privileged to call in a gobbler for this young teenager and saw in her eyes the same fire I experienced when my Alabama gobbler bit the dust.\n\nStill later after having several successful turkey seasons under my belt, my Ruston friend, Jody Backus, asked if I would accompany him to his property to see if I could guide him to success with gobblers that inhabited his land. He was successful in downing a big one.\n\nEach episode differs in the way it plays out. When I called the gobbler in for young Sarah Hebert, it came right off the roost to the decoy we had set out. The hunt ended quickly because soon after daylight, she was packing out her first longbeard. In Backus’ case, the weather was chilly and nasty and we were on the verge of giving up when at the last minute, a big longbeard decided to make Jody’s day.\n\nOn two other occasions, I shared my know-how with a couple of other hunters who took what they had experienced when I guided them to call in and take gobblers on their own. I wasn’t there when Carla Johnson and Ross Downer got their gobblers but their success was almost as gratifying as if I had been there.\n\nLouisiana’s turkey season opened this past Saturday and I found out about another situation in which one hunter guided another hunter, a novice, to take their first longbeard.\n\nMy nephew, Dan Dupree, lives on Clear Lake in Natchitoches Parish with his wife, Debbie and two offspring, daughter Rachel who will graduate from college this summer as a nurse, and high school senior Johnathan, who has been successful in killing a gobbler or two.\n\n“I had located some turkeys on our hunting lease and had gone out and scouted to sort of get them located. When opening day came, I had planned to take my dad and guide him but he wasn’t able to go,” said Johnathan. “Rachel asked me if I would take her so rather than going out to chase gobblers on my own, I agreed.”\n\nRachel had been successful on her deer stand having taken a nice 9 point buck this past deer season but had never tried turkey hunting. They got to the woods early and as it began to get daylight, the gobblers began waking up and long story short, Johnathon used his turkey calls to entice a big longbeard to Rachel’s gun. She dropped the 21-pound bird with a 10 ½ inch beard at 30 yards with one shot from her 20-gauge Remington.\n\nHer reaction? “I’m hooked; I think Johnathon has created something in me that I’m going to love” she said.\n\nThat’s the way it is, one hunter helping another experience the thrill of something that means so much to the guide and ultimately to the novice hunter. In my case, my helping Sarah and Jody and Ross and Carla to getting their first gobblers was right up there in soul satisfaction equal to the day Skinny watched me jump up and down with excitement over my first.\n\nThat’s the magic turkey hunting induces.\n\nContact Glynn at glynnharris37@gmail.com\n\nFor every athlete the day comes when you’re no longer able to compete either due to age or a career-ending injury. Well, for today’s senior bass pros, or what most call the legends of the sport, that day might be approaching a lot sooner than many of them had planned. Today, let’s look at why so many of these elderly pros are looking to load their boats and go home — for good.\n\nJust like any other sport, athletes come to a point in their careers in which they start to contemplate retirement. There comes a day for all athletes where you just can’t compete anymore. So many of today’s bass fishing pros are at that point, mainly due to a technological advancement called forward-facing sonar (FFS). Nothing has impacted the bass fishing world like this latest form of technology.\n\nSo, why is this technology having such an impact on the older anglers? Well, I guess it’s the fact that FFS has played right into the hands of the younger generation of anglers moving up into professional bass fishing. They have embraced this technology and taken it to another level which has cut their learning curve and their ability to find fish by 75 percent. Today’s young anglers all grew up playing video games and FFS for these young anglers is nothing more than just that: a video game.\n\nThe old school anglers have not embraced this technology nearly as well as the younger guys and it shows in the tournament results. For proof, look at the Angler of the Year (AOY) standings and you’ll see names like Matt Herren, Lee Livesay, John Cox, Greg Hackney, Jason Christie, Michael Iaconelli, and the 4-time World champion, Rick Clunn. As of this writing, all are in the bottom 50 of the AOY standings.\n\nSo why are the older anglers not accepting FFS? Some feel that FFS is not good for the sport in the long run and would like to see some restrictions or rule changes made to help level the playing field and protect the fisheries. But most will tell you that this technology is here to stay as some of the older anglers are now starting to question if they are going to try and get better with FFS or just get out of the sport all together. Most of these anglers will wait and see if B.A.S.S. or MLF make any major rule adjustments to their circuits regarding FFS before they decide to leave the sport they love so much.\n\nMy conversations with several professional anglers have revealed there is some resentment to these new young anglers taking over the sport. The legends of the sport don’t like the fact that these young up-and-coming anglers haven’t paid their dues and are not just winning but dominating events immediately. The techniques that used to work for the older guys and how they have fished their whole career no longer allows them to be as competitive as they once were. This has been a shock and blow to their egos.\n\nFor the older anglers, it took years of time on the water to obtain the knowledge they possess while these young guns are doing a better job of adapting to the new technology that’s available. No longer do young anglers have to go through the painful task of fishing daylight ‘til dark in order to compete with the legendary pros.\n\nFor the young anglers on the rise, the game has changed as the word “scouting” today means something totally different than it did 10 years ago. The anglers who are proficient with FFS will spend their day idling, scanning, and marking schools of bass that they can come back to on tournament day. Some are not even having to wet a hook in practice in order to save their fish for the tournament. A recent example is 33-year-old pro angler, Jason Hamner, who spent 14 days on Grand Lake prior to the Bassmaster Classic doing nothing but idling and marking brush tops without ever wetting a hook.\n\nWith all this being said, will this force many of the older anglers to retire and idle off into the sunset? Several have told me that it’s something they are considering as they are frustrated with both B.A.S.S. and MLF officials for not doing more to address the (FFS) technology issue. They feel that this new technology will ruin the sport over the next five years, as due to FFS, fish no longer have a safe haven.\n\nFact is, all of our lakes are under assault as more anglers across the country are purchasing these high dollar forward-facing sonar units. It’s not just bass that are being affected, it’s crappie as well. So many crappie guides have told me they are concerned as well, since these FFS units are targeting the bigger breeding population.\n\nTo put a bow on this topic and from my perspective, it appears that the senior anglers of both B.A.S.S. and MLF have a choice to make. Either get on board with FFS and get better with it or take their tackle boxes and go home because I don’t see anything changing with regards to this new technology. I truly believe it’s here to stay.\n\nContact Steve at sgraf26@yahoo.com\n\n(NOTE: O.J. Simpson’s death, from a cancer battle at age 76, was announced Thursday by his family. His mother grew up in Caddo Parish and Simpson visited the Shreveport area often since he was acquitted of double murder charges in the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles. In August 2022, Shreveport-Bossier Journal writer Harriet Prothro Penrod met him and recounted their conversation for the Journal.)\n\nBy HARRIET PROTHRO PENROD, Journal Sports\n\nI don’t know what it was that made me drive the golf cart across the fairway and introduce myself. Curiosity, I imagine. It’s not like I put a lot of thought into it. In fact, I had no idea what I was going to say when I got to his golf cart.\n\nThere I was, in the middle of the 17th fairway at Huntington Park golf course, introducing myself. “Hi. I’m Harriet Prothro Penrod. I’m with the Shreveport-Bossier Journal, and I was wondering if I could do a short Q&A with you after your round.”\n\nHe looked me right in the eyes, held out his hand, smiled, and said, “Are you related to (College Football Hall of Fame coach) Tommy Prothro?”\n\n“No,” I said, “but it is spelled the same way.”\n\nHe said sure, he’d be happy to sit down and visit after the round. “Well, okay,” I replied. “I’ll meet you in the clubhouse.”\n\nIt was on this same course two years ago – playing in the Ebony Golf Tournament – that I saw O.J. Simpson. Actually, I heard him first and recognized that voice. There was no doubt about the identity of the large man bending over to find his golf ball in the high grass on the other side of the 15th green.\n\nHe hung around the clubhouse after the tournament, but I had no desire to go up and talk to him. Perhaps now – two years later — that I was writing for the SBJ (which didn’t exist then), I felt the journalistic urge to interview the (in)famous individual. Maybe people would be interested to know what he was doing in Shreveport.\n\nThink what you may about him.\n\nGrowing up, my favorite sport was football. I spent endless days in the front yard – in pads and helmet – playing with my cousin, younger brother, and any of the boys from the neighborhood who wanted to play. When my cousin, who was “all-time QB,” wasn’t playing, that meant I got to be quarterback. When Jeff was there, I’d play wide receiver.\n\nMore than once, there would be a knock on our front door and my mom would answer to hear a young boy say, “Can Harriet come out and play quarterback?”\n\nBelieve me, that’s not what my mom wanted to hear. But I digress.\n\nI say all that to say this: I loved football – playing it and watching it. And I grew up watching O.J. Simpson play football – at USC and for the Buffalo Bills, where his quarterback was Shreveport’s own Joe Ferguson.\n\nMaybe that’s what made me want to talk to him. Whatever the reason, last Sunday I cut my own round short and waited in the clubhouse at Huntington, wondering if he was actually going to come in and sit down to talk.\n\nIf he did, what would I ask him? I hadn’t prepared a “Q&A” or anything else to ask him. I’d just wing it – bring up some topics and see what he had to say.\n\nAnd in he walked . . .\n\nAnd so I said . . .\n\n“I saw you at the Ebony tournament here a couple of years ago. How often do you get to Shreveport?”\n\nEvery two to three years, I come for a family reunion. We’re having our reunion this weekend. We own property in Greenwood – it was deeded down to our family. My kids didn’t make it this year. My two younger kids both have kids under one (year old).\n\n“How are you spending your time these days?”\n\nBetween golf and fantasy football, I stay pretty busy. Golf has kept me sane through the years. It gets me up, keeps me moving. I just turned 75. I’ll usually play Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday (in Las Vegas). Sometimes people in town want to play, so I’ll play more. We’ve got a golf group in Vegas called “In the Cup.” There are about 12-13 guys from the Shreveport area who come play. Eventually, we’re all going to come down here and have a tournament – maybe at Squire Creek (outside of Ruston in Choudrant).\n\n“What do you do when you’re not playing golf?”\n\nI’m on Twitter. I’ve had over 900,000 followers. I try to stay out of politics, but that’s almost impossible. I try to keep it in sports and history.\n\n“Who do you think are the best running backs in the NFL today?”\n\nKing (Derrick) Henry (Tennessee Titans) and Jonathan Taylor (Indianapolis Colts). And Saquon Barkley (New York Giants) is definitely in the top 5 – he just can’t stay healthy.\n\nO.J. talked some more about football – how he and (Pro Football Hall of Famer) Eric Dickerson would be attending, and had a bet on, this year’s opening NFL game between the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Rams. He talked some more about politics – how he thought either California Governor Gavin Newsom or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis would be the next President of the United States.\n\nBefore leaving, I told O.J. I had one last question: “So, generally, how do people treat you out in public?”\n\nGenerally, very well. Rarely do people say something out-of-line.\n\nIt was then that a gentleman walked across the clubhouse and asked O.J. if he could have his picture taken with him. You see, as a 10-year-old, he had watched Simpson play in Buffalo and had even gotten O.J.’s autograph after the game.\n\nA football fan . . . like me.\n\nContact Harriet at sbjharriet@gmail.com\n\nAs writers, we often spend a lot of time staring at an empty computer screen. In the old days, it was a blank piece of paper curled up around the typewriter roller, just waiting for the hunting and pecking to begin.\n\n“Empty” and “blank” are the operative words there, because that’s what it feels like when the creative juices just aren’t flowing.\n\nIt’s a part of the craft that we take for granted. I have no idea what all is involved in writing a novel, but I have to believe Ernest Hemingway had moments in which he had no idea where to start. Ernie was known to knock a few back, so that probably helped get him loosened up and started on The Old Man and the Sea.\n\nSports writing might be a little easier – you mean to tell me that Farewell To Arms wasn’t about the decline of the Dodgers pitching staff? – because there’s always some game being played or about to be played and therefore something to write about.\n\nI’d have no idea how or what to write about a City Council meeting, but I’m all over a Benton vs. Parkway baseball game.\n\nI don’t know about the rest of the people who practice this craft, but the hardest part for me is simply getting started when you are swimming in a sea of nothingness.\n\nMy boy Gustave Flaubert once wrote “The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.”\n\nHere’s what I believe in, Gustave — Newspapers.com.\n\nI don’t know if this website is the greatest invention ever – air conditioning and the automatic teller machine are hard to beat – but I find when the verbs and adjectives are hard to come by, a deep-dive into my online account is the cure for what ails me.\n\nAnd it only costs $74.90 every six months. (There is no discount for 19th century French novelists.)\n\nI’ll spend hours looking for just the right bit of inspiration and often ended up fascinated with how the craft of sports writing has changed over the years. Sometimes it’s re-reading a piece I wrote in my younger days and wondering just what the hell I was thinking when I cranked out a 26-inch story on a prep football game between two teams with losing records.\n\nBut I often see stories by some really terrific writers who wrote a really terrific story on a really terrific game. No matter how the industry has changed, that’s still what it’s all about.\n\nSounds silly to some, but just trying to write a story as good as the next guy is a great way to start pounding the keyboard.\n\nNewspapers.com is like a gigantic scrap book (kids, ask your parents from clarification) that can be used for whatever purpose you’d like.\n\nBut nothing is better than to look back a few decades and read the prose in which the stories, particularly sports, were written. I stumbled into a May, 1964 story about Jesuit (now Loyola) was headed to Hahnville to try to win the state baseball championship.\n\nIn the unbylined story, it was written “Restovich will take over the gateway post while Attaway is laboring on the hill. Mike Restovich will hold down second while Tony Papa will be at the other keystone post. The hot corner will be in the reliable hands of Marvin Jordan, the man with the supersonic arm. Tommy Mazur will handle the backstopping chores. Danny Gayer, hard-hitting James Bustillo and Tony Rinaudo will handle the gardening chores for the Flyers.”\n\nIf that’s not gold, I don’t know what is. Gateway post, keystone post, laboring on the hill … all of those are great, but “gardening chores” to describe the outfielders had me doubled over.\n\nYou think Hemingway could have cranked out a paragraph like that? Think again, my friend.\n\nThat’s inspiration.\n\nContact JJ at johnjamesmarshall@yahoo.com\n\nBy DOUG IRELAND, Journal Sports\n\nAUGUSTA, Ga. – Shreveport native Sam Burns has been fairly quiet recently on the PGA Tour after beginning 2024 with a sizzling start on the West Coast, but he could be one of the big stories this weekend at The Masters.\n\nGolf’s first major championship is slated to tee off today at Augusta National, although it’s likely that some of the stormy weather that swept through Louisiana will either stall the start or make conditions extremely difficult early. (Accordingly, tee times were pushed back more than two hours early this morning).\n\nBurns now has a 3:42 EDT (2:42 CDT) start, and is paired with 2013 Masters champ Adam Scott and Cameron Young, who Burns routed 6&5 to win the 2023 World Match Play Championship, the most recent of his five PGA Tour victories.\n\nHe had four Top 10 finishes in his first five starts this season during the Tour’s West Coast swing. Burns has banked $2.1 million in winnings this season and is almost to $24 million in his career since joining the PGA Tour in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case for the past two years in Augusta, Burns is sharing a rental house with his closest friend on tour, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Both are expecting their firstborns, and each have said if they get the call from their wives, they’ll drop out and head home.\n\nThat day is expected to be imminent for Burns, whose wife Caroline, also a Shreveport native, is expected to give birth next week. Scheffler’s wife is due in three weeks but he, too, has made it clear he’s bolting for home if she calls.\n\nDiscarding that potential storyline, Burns is the off-the-radar pick to challenge for the win by CBS Sports golf analyst Patrick McDonald. Given 50-1 odds (everybody in the field but Scheffler is no better than 20-1), Burns has earned McDonald’s endorsement with his early-season brilliance and his driving distance and putting accuracy.\n\nBurns is ninth on tour in putting average (1.70 per hole) and first in putts of three feet or less, making all 255 this year in his 21 rounds. He’s also third in accuracy on approaches from 125-150 yards, hitting it to an average of 19 feet, 9 inches. The former Calvary Baptist and LSU star is ninth in total driving and remains one of the game’s longest off the tee, while ranking second in birdie average (4.79 per 18 holes).\n\nThe 27-year-old is 22nd in the Official World Golf Rankings, coming off his first USA Ryder Cup appearance last year, and stands 24th in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup standings.\n\nHe was 29th at last year’s Masters after missing the cut in his first appearance in 2022.\n\nBurns now lives in Choudrant and plays out of Squire Creek Country Club.\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nCraig Nall, the Alexandria native and former LSU quarterback who set regular-season records for passing yardage (2,022) and completions (166) in his only season at Northwestern State in 2001, is trying to recover from heart-piercing blows two years ago that involved three deaths in his family within 15 days.\n\nThe 44-year-old Nall, who backed up Brett Favre for five NFL seasons with the Green Bay Packers, is also trying to recover from a divorce.\n\nAnd Nall, who several years ago started QB1 Sports, a successful venture offering one-on-one coaching from a former NFL quarterback, is also trying to recover from alcoholism.\n\nHe’s making progress on all fronts.\n\nCraig’s father, Malcolm, died of a heart attack two years ago, and within 15 days, an uncle and a sister-in-law died. “That was pretty tough for the family,” Craig understated. “My dad was my best friend, my biggest fan.”\n\nAbout three times a year he leaves his home in McKinney, Texas, to visit his mom, Susie, in Alexandria. He visits often on the phone with her and describes her as “a strong woman of faith,” adding, “and we’re kind of getting through things together.”\n\nDivorce reared its ugly head in Craig’s life after 17 ½ years of marriage in October of 2022. “Amanda and I didn’t give our two sons a great example of what love is,” he said, trying to explain they grew apart through financial difficulties. Neither was making much money in their respective jobs at the time – when he was in commercial real estate and brokerage — and his alcoholism was part of the problem, he said. “We didn’t get along. There was no infidelity, but we argued a lot.”\n\nNow, he says, he has a girlfriend, Jessica, whom he met on St. Patrick’s Day last year. “We get along so well, we have fun doing anything together. Within 10 minutes of meeting her, he said, she persuaded him to go with her and get a tattoo, admitting it sounds crazy. “I couldn’t tell her no.” He said he got the Taurus sign above his right shoulder since he and both of his teenage sons, Matthew, a saxophone wizard, and Mason, a good athlete, all were born under that astrological sign. Mason, incidentally, who’ll turn 14 in two weeks, shares the same April 21 birthday with Craig.\n\nJessica, he said, has a serious side, too, and “has certain expectations of me, and I don’t want to screw this up.” They are not engaged, although they have talked about it. “I know Dad would love Jessica.”\n\nAs for the alcoholism, Craig said, he’s dealt with it in varying degrees since college but more so during his time in the NFL, “where we worked hard but we partied hard, too.” He said while most people who drink can quit after a couple, he found he always wanted more. It peaked last July, around the same time he had a serious bout with Covid, when his blood pressure soared to a dangerous 200 over 130.\n\n“One night I left the house to go to the store to get something to drink,” he said in a phone interview this week. “I had this routine where I’d do that and cruise around, usually in the neighborhood. I ended up on a highway and out of gas. I had no idea how I got there. I went into a treatment center in the first week of August.\n\n“I made a phone call to a friend, who has over five years of sobriety,” Craig continued. “I wanted to get help. He got me booked to a treatment center.”\n\nThe treatment center’s program focused largely on faith, he said, and he said he found help from prayer. “I let Him take the wheel. I let Him guide me. I pray all the time. I’m trying to be obedient to Him, to be of service to Him.”\n\nHe said he learned alcoholism is not a behavioral thing but a disease. “Some people like me have allergic reactions to alcohol, where it’s an addictive problem. You’ve got to want to quit. I needed help. I wanted to set a better example for the boys. Probably within two months, (the urge to drink) was gone.”\n\nHe credits God for being 8 ½ months sober and gives Him thanks daily.\n\nCraig’s coming back to Natchitoches next weekend to attend the Demons’ spring football game, the Joe Delaney Bowl, on April 20, supporting his former LSU teammate, new NSU head coach Blaine McCorkle. When the Northwestern job opened last fall, McCorkle called Nall for insight and a few months later, the former Tigers’ deep snapper under Gerry DiNardo is generating excitement in the Demon camp.\n\nNall is now finding satisfaction in a new job as a registered representative in the oil and gas business with the SEC in 28 states, but he still attends AA meetings, and finds himself counselling others in his group who are struggling with not only addiction but with faith.\n\n“There’s a joy of knowing God is in control,” he said. “I’m trying to live out His will.”\n\nThe inspiration for this column was from a recent “Next on the Tee” podcast in which Nall was the guest of Chris Mascaro of Atlanta. It is available on open.spotify.com.\n\nThere is no way I could ever forget my introduction to hunting wild turkeys. I had actually tagged along years ago behind Blue Parkman, a veteran turkey hunter from Ruston who had several years of chasing gobblers under his belt. Back then, turkeys were scarce only being found in isolated areas such as the Jackson-Bienville wildlife management area where I followed Parkman. The hunt ended without success although I got to hear a turkey gobble for the first time.\n\nIt was years later, 1994, that my addiction to turkey hunting began when I accepted the invitation to hunt turkeys in Alabama. I was reluctant at first because I had never turkey hunted and the date of the invitation coincided with bream bedding season here at home. I rather reluctantly accepted the invitation, shot my very first gobbler and I was instantly hooked. Some 20 years later before age and infirmities halted my ability to chase gobblers, I was able to bring down 41 gobblers from around the country, collecting my coveted Grand Slam in the process.\n\nI would love to still be able to hurry across the woods to be sitting within 100 yards of a roosted gobbler before it flew down. Since I can’t, I enjoy talking about them, writing about them and supporting them by my membership in our local chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation.\n\nNow that turkey season is kicking off – opening day in Area A this year is April 6 – I visited with the state’s top wild turkey expert, Cody Cedatol, to get his thoughts on what the turkey situation looks like this year in Louisiana. For the past several years, things have not been quite so rosy as they have been in earlier times.\n\n“Based on all we have been able to tell,” Cedatol began, “things are looking better than they have over the last decade or so. We have had a good hatch two years in a row and we have determined that the gobbler harvest was up again last year so we’re excited about that.”\n\nMy next question had to do with the reason or reasons that things are looking better for our state’s turkey population.\n\n“There are at least a couple of reasons,” said Cedatol. “A few years ago, we delayed the opening of turkey season to give gobblers and hens a bit longer to get together and breed and this has resulted in better hatches of young turkeys. Another reason is an environmental one. For the past couple of years, we have had better weather during the nesting and brooding season. Turkeys need a relatively dry period from April to June and that’s what we’ve had and turkeys have responded.”\n\nCedatol noted that there were reports of a good population of juvenile males (jakes) last year which means those that carried over will be adult gobblers this season.\n\nI wondered what plans if any were on the drawing board going forward from this year as regards management of wild turkeys.\n\n“We have a proposal before the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission that would prohibit the harvest of jakes except by youth hunters. Lots of hunters have expressed a desire for us to do this and in fact, many private hunting clubs already prohibit the taking of jakes. It’s not a done deal as the proposal is out for public comments and Commission won’t be acting on it until their April meeting,” he said.\n\nPublic hearings will take place around the state prior to the meeting giving hunters the opportunity to express opinions as to whether or not the prohibition of taking jakes will become law. Have an opinion? Let the Commission know what you think.\n\nContact Glynn at glynnharris37@gmail.com\n\nDid you remember the eclipse Monday?\n\nHow could you not? The national media was relentless. It was an historic event many people never imagined they’d witness.\n\nAmericans gathered all over to watch. It didn’t last long, but for some, it was an obsession for much longer.\n\nCloudy weather? No problem. As long as your rabbit ears were working and the TV signal picked up an NBC station.\n\nFifty years ago yesterday – Monday, April 8, 1974 — the greatest home run ever was struck, in Atlanta’s Fulton County Stadium. Hank Aaron eclipsed the major league baseball career home run record set by the legendary Babe Ruth.\n\nThe first reminder of that landmark day in America came via email early Monday from the venerable Nico Van Thyn, who grew up in Shreveport and became one of Louisiana’s finest sports journalists along a career path that carried him to destinations near and far. Van Thyn was one of the 53,775 paid customers in the park that night, with “great seats, just to the left of home plate high in the lower deck,” he wrote in a 2014 blog entry.\n\nHe was there. I watched like 35 million others, on a TV. I will humbly and prudently yield the storytelling of Hammerin’ Hank’s monumental blast, and its lasting significance, to Nico at his blog with these entries:\n\nhttps://nvanthyn.blogspot.com/2014/04/hanks-home-run-no-715-i-was-there.html\n\nhttps://nvanthyn.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-great-moment-for-all-of-us.html\n\nIt was ironic Monday to hear network announcers repeatedly, gleefully, understandably refer to the celestial event as a shared experience, one that transcended differences in religious beliefs, politics, culture, or current status in the pursuit of happiness. It united people. It absolutely did.\n\nThen, at 3 p.m. CDT, their colleagues at CNN, Fox, MSNBC and the others – not the Weather Channel, though! – reverted back to their not-subtle, deeply-angled accounts of news and issues, with the storytelling not remotely approaching the down-the-middle reporting America thrived upon 50 years ago from CBS’s Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor and David Brinkley on NBC and on ABC, Louisiana’s Howard K. Smith (born in Ferriday) and Harry Reasoner.\n\n“Those Were the Days,” as the lead characters, Archie and Edith Bunker, crooned to introduce the hottest sitcom of the day, All in the Family.\n\nArchie was, to put it mildly – which he never did – a patriotic American. Most of us still are, a half-century later.\n\nIt’s easy to understand patriotism as the base motivation of Louisiana’s new governor, Jeff Landry, who unleashed what many of us consider an outlandish edict last week in the wake of the LSU women’s basketball team not being on the court when the Star Spangled Banner was played pregame at the Tigers’ Elite Eight contest with the Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nOr as one poor young local newscaster called them, the “Hawkees.”\n\nDid you chuckle? Did you chortle, wince, or groan, when Gov. Landry trotted out his position that despite his admiration for LSU coach Kim Mulkey, it was an insult the Tigers weren’t disrupting their regular pregame routine to stand at attention for the national anthem. He followed with a “suggestion” filed with the leaders of all state university systems that going forward, the student-athletes on teams not standing at attention on the field or court for the anthem should risk having their scholarships revoked.\n\nIt has not been well received. You’ve read and heard countless repudiations from in and outside the sports community.\n\nIt’s been pointed out endlessly that when the U.S. Military Academy came to play football in Tiger Stadium last fall, neither the Army Cadets or LSU Tigers were on the field for the anthem. Rarely is any college football team. Go down sport by sport, starting with basketball, and the variables are many, and the teams out standing for the anthem are in the minority, primarily because the timing of the song’s rendition varies from venue to venue.\n\nThere are many rabbit holes to chase down on the topic. But there is a fairly basic, simple remedy. It’s done in baseball and softball, almost uniformly, when the anthem is played, if at all. It’s done at some places in hoops, volleyball, soccer and more.\n\nPlay it just before the game starts. The NFL has done so forever. Not everything the NFL does is worth emulating, but this is. Most sports, the last thing that happens before game time is introduction of the lineups. Easy enough to take another 90 seconds or so to play the anthem, when all participants are geared up to compete.\n\nYes, as we saw eight years ago with Colin Kaepernick, and his teammate, former LSU player Eric Reid, taking a knee to protest their misgivings with the country, there will be dissenters.\n\nThey should not be sanctioned. Dissent is as fundamental an American right as savoring the Star Spangled Banner. There’s no shortage of Congressional testimony from uber-patriotic, decorated military veterans, easily recalled online, that says so much better than I ever could. But that’s another rabbit hole …\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nJOURNAL SPORTS\n\nThere are 450 members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., founded in 1959. Thirteen more will be enshrined Aug. 16-17.\n\nTwo of the newbies will be Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame members. Seimone Augustus, the Baton Rouge native and LSU great entering the LSHOF during the Class of 2024 Induction Celebration June 20-22, is joined by Alexandria’s Charles Smith, boys basketball coach at Peabody Magnet for 40 years and a 2019 LSHOF inductee.\n\nSmith’s Peabody teams frequently play in early-season games against local teams and in some locally-hosted tournaments.\n\nOnly eight Louisiana natives – Ruston and Louisiana Tech’s Leon Barmore, Natchitoches native and Shreveport-born Joe Dumars, Rayville’s Elvin Hayes, Summerfield and Tech’s Karl Malone, Tickfaw native and Lady Techster Kim Mulkey (enshrined in Springfield as a coach), Shreveport native and Centenary grad Robert Parish, Bob Pettit of Baton Rouge and LSU, and Grambling’s Willis Reed – have previously been enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. All are in the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nThree more LSU luminaries who are not Louisiana natives, but are LSHOF inductees, Sue Gunter, Pete Maravich and Shaquille O’Neal, are also in the Naismith Basketball Hall. So is Pineland, Texas native and Lady Techster great Teresa Weatherspoon.\n\nHaving two Bayou State greats inducted in the same year has happened once before. Barmore and Parish were inducted in the Springfield Hall together in the Class of 2003.\n\nAlready this year, along with her upcoming LSHOF induction, Augustus will be enshrined April 27 in the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Tenn., and tonight, in the new East Baton Rouge Parish School System Hall of Fame alongside Pettit and other LSHOF members Eddie Robinson, Billy Cannon, Doug Williams and Danielle Scott.\n\nThe Basketball Hall enshrinement is unquestionably the ultimate recognition.\n\nAlso among the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame 2024 Class: Vince Carter, Chauncey Billups, retired Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, and as contributors, Doug Collins, Herb Simon and Jerry West.\n\nScanning the list of previous Basketball Hall inductees are superstars like Charles Barkley, Kobe Bryant, Bill Russell, Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, Bob Cousy, Rebecca Lobo, Nancy Lieberman, Lisa Leslie, and Teresa Edwards – not to mention the game’s greatest coaches from all levels, like Red Auerbach, Pat Summitt, Tara Van Derveer, Pat Riley, Lenny Wilkins, Adolph Rupp and John Wooden.\n\nThe inductees are chosen after a multi-tiered process that culminates with finalists being considered by a 24-person Honors Committee, with at least 18 affirmative votes required for induction.\n\nAs women’s basketball has soared into mainstream sports conversation in the last couple of years, Augustus was especially gratified at her first-ballot selection announced Saturday at the men’s NCAA Final Four in Phoenix.\n\n“It means so much, to be a trailblazer of the game to get it where it is now – the elevation of it, the visibility of it. And also, for the people I went on this journey with – it’s been a long, hard journey, but very gratifying journey now that it’s been stamped with the Hall of Fame foundation and going into the Hall in 2024,” she said. “It’s been an amazing journey and career that ended with a cherry on top.”\n\nShe played point guard/forward while starring at high school, college and professional levels and was part of three gold medal-winning Olympic teams and four WNBA title teams. Augustus was on the national scene not long after becoming a teenager, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated for Women as a high school freshman.\n\nLSU unveiled a statue in her honor in January 2023 for her magnificent four seasons with the Tigers as she won back-to-back national Player of the Year honors and helped her team to three Final Fours. Augustus led Baton Rouge’s Capitol High to a 138-7 record and Class 4A titles in 2001 and 2002 and a finals berth in 1999 as she scored 3,600 points, had 1,728 rebounds and 869 assists.\n\nShe was a member of the U.S. Olympic gold medal-winning teams in 2008, 2012 and 2016.\n\nSmith’s credentials are unquestionably among the best ever among high school coaches. He has 1,208 career wins, fifth in national high school history, and his teams have won nine state championships – the latest just last month in an overtime victory over Madison Prep at the Marsh Madness LHSAA Final Four in Lake Charles. He has won 85 percent of the games he’s coached, losing only 214.\n\nHe was ESPN’s National High School Coach of the Year in 2010, when his Warhorses went 41-0. He was a head coach in the 2021 McDonald’s High School All-Star Game. He came to Peabody in 1974 as a math teacher – and remains in that role. He was an assistant coach, helping the Warhorses win the first state title in school history, before taking over the head coaching role in 1984.\n\nSaturday, in Phoenix, his thoughts raced back home.\n\n“It’s a thrill to be here, to represent my school, Peabody High School. I’ve been there for 50 years, teaching and coaching. I’ve had some wonderful guys to play basketball for me. This is an honor not only for me, but for all high school basketball coaches,” he said.\n\nJOURNAL SPORTS\n\nBATON ROUGE – Angel Reese is winging away from LSU and into professional basketball.\n\nReese, one of the most colorful and at times controversial players in women’s college basketball history, announced Wednesday morning via a photo shoot in Vogue magazine and social media accounts that she will enter the 2024 WNBA Draft and turn professional.\n\nThe 21-year-old Maryland transfer became a two-time All-American and the 2023-24 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year for LSU. She was the catalyst for last season’s national championship team, with dynamic scoring and rebounding and a flair to her game and persona that earned her the nickname “Bayou Barbie.”\n\nIt has brought her a vast collection of high-profile endorsement deals in the rapidly emerging era of Name, Image and Likeness in college sports. Reese is a spokesperson for brands including Goldman Sachs, AirBnB, Reebok, Topps, Beats by Dre and others. Her NIL valuation is approaching $2 million.\n\nLSU’s season ended Monday night with an NCAA Tournament Elite 8 loss to Iowa. She had told media she would quickly make an announcement whether she would return to LSU or turn pro, declaring for the WNBA Draft. That decision was already made, revealed the Vogue story, as her photo shoot to accompany the article was done in mid-March.\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey praised Reese and indicated no surprise at the decision in a university press release.\n\n“Angel transferred to LSU after my first season in Baton Rouge and she helped transform our program,” Mulkey said. “When she came here, she said she wanted to be here for two seasons and she has lived up to that. What a remarkable two years it has been.\n\n“We are all indebted to Angel Reese for the contributions she has given to this program, helping us win our first national championship, and the contributions she made on our university as a whole. She not only helped grow our program but had an impact on growing the game of women’s basketball across the country.\n\n“We wish her good luck as she moves to the WNBA and look forward to see all that she accomplishes. We will miss her but will always cherish the two years we got to spend with her.”\n\nReese had 61 double-doubles at LSU, trailing only Sylvia Fowles in school history. The Baltimore native had three separated streaks of at least 10 straight double-doubles and averaged 20.9 points and 14.4 rebounds as a Tiger. Reese became the first player since Wendy Scholtens from Vanderbilt in 1989 and 1990 to lead the league in both scoring and rebounding in consecutive seasons. Reese had seven games with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds over the past two seasons.\n\nReese recorded a double-double in all 10 of the NCAA Tournament games she played as a Tiger, tying the NCAA Tournament record for consecutive double-doubles.\n\n“I’m leaving college with everything I ever wanted,” Reese said on a video she posted on her X account. “A degree, a national championship and this platform I could have never imagined.\n\n“This is for the girls who look like me that’s going to speak up in what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. To grow women’s sports and to have an impact on those coming next. This was a difficult decision, but I trust the next chapter because I know the author. Bayou Barbie out.”\n\nReese saw her brand skyrocket at LSU. She came to Baton Rouge with just about 70,000 instagram followers and now has 2.7-millions. She has appeared on numerous magazine covers including Sports Illustrated and Women’s Health. Reese won the 2023 ESPY for the Best Breakthrough Athlete, was named the 2023 BET Sportswoman of the Year and the 2023 Sporting News Athlete of the Year.\n\nShe had multiple viral moments such as the “Shoe Block” against Arkansas and a TikTok-style dance against Tennessee which helped her Bayou Barbie brand skyrocket, said LSU’s press release.\n\nWhile WNBA salaries don’t approach NBA pay, most women in the league also play overseas, where they are compensated much better. Reese said she was “OK” with the challenge of going pro at the expense of comforts like charter air travel that LSU provided and is uncommon in the WNBA.\n\n“I’ll be working with grown women,” Reese said. “I’ll be working with women that have kids, women that have a family to feed. I’m going to have to work my butt off every single day and grind. And who wouldn’t want that? I don’t want anything in my life to be easy.”\n\nShe expressed indifference at any criticism of her move.\n\n“It was obviously a hard decision to make but it’s best for me my career and my family,” Reese said in a TikTok video. “Be happy for me, or don’t. I don’t care.”\n\nIf you hunt or fish, you’ll find there are some activities that are more highly revered than others, at least they are by zealots of the sport. Take quail hunting, for example. While quail in our part of the country have basically gone the way of the Studebaker, there are those who still keep a brace of pointers and seek out those widely scattered pockets of cover that may hold a covey or two. Why? Because quail hunting is so special to them; they just can’t entertain thoughts that quail numbers continue to shrink.\n\nThen there are the fly fishermen. The average angler heads for the lake or the creek bank armed with rods and reels, or a cane pole and bucket of worms. While some rod and reelers and cane polers have perfected their craft to a fine edge, the average fisherman just wants to catch supper, and the gear he selects is what he feels will allow him to do that most effectively.\n\nAh, but the fly fisherman is a far different creature. He’s probably more of a purist; a perfectionist, than any other sportsman. He talks in almost reverential tones of tippets and Royal Coachmen and such. He ties his own flies; builds his own rods. It’s as if the process of preparing to fly fish is an end in itself.\n\nI once tried fly fishing, but I soon learned that I lack something in the “purist” category. I purchased my outfit years ago at the local discount store for $29.95. No, that was not the price of the fly line; that was the package price for rod, reel, line, leader and a box of flies. I took my purchase to a local pond where I’d located a bed of bluegills in the shallows. I managed to catch a few fish but I spent an inordinate amount of time getting my popping bug untangled from the myrtle bush behind me.\n\nI also noticed a lack of dexterity when it came to making “the cast.” I almost threw out my shoulder trying to emulate the fly fishers I’d watched on TV. While they made it look so easy, I spent most of my fishing time tripping over line wrapped around my ankles and getting a half-hitch from around my ear.\n\nWhile on a turkey hunting trip to South Dakota several years ago, I spent some time with Dick Leir, owner of Dakota Angler and Outfitter, and as he drove me alongside the sparkling-clear streams in the Black Hills, he talked about his favorite sport, fly fishing.\n\n“Fly fishing can be frustrating, but once you get over the initial aggravation, it is a calming sport,” Leir explained. “There is an evolution that takes place in the life of a fly fisher. At first, his goal is to catch ‘a’ fish. Once he accomplishes this, he wants to catch a ‘lot’ of fish. Then he progresses to wanting to catch a ‘big’ fish; then a ‘lot of big’ fish. He arrives as a genuine fly fisher when his consuming desire is to catch ‘that’ fish.\n\n“Fly fishing is unique in that it is one of the few do-it-yourself sports. Anglers get a lot of satisfaction from painstakingly building their own rods and becoming adept at tying their own flies. To catch ‘that’ fish on a rod you have built with a fly you have tied offers the utmost satisfaction,” said Leir.\n\nAccording to Leir, trout fishermen don’t go to a stream with the purpose of catching fish to eat.\n\n“The object is not to catch ‘supper.’ Wild trout are much too valuable for that. A legendary fly fisherman, the late Lee Wulfe once said, ‘a trout is too valuable a commodity to catch only once,’” recalled Leir.\n\nWhile wild trout are the number one quarry of most fly fishers, practically any species of fish can be caught on a flyrod. We don’t have trout in Louisiana, but there are other fish that can provide great sport for the flyrodder. Bedded bluegills, like I attempted to catch, bass and crappie are all amenable to being caught on fly tackle.\n\nAs advanced age has caught up with me, I have laid aside my fly rod and casting rod and settled for a seat in a comfortable chair on the bank of a pond with bedded bluegills swirling the water just off shore. Skewering on a cricket and lobbing it into the mass of bream, I’m as happy as a fly fisherman wading a clear mountain stream for trout.\n\nContact Glynn at glynnharris37@gmail.com\n\nDoesn’t seem that long ago but in 2018, one of best guys we know gave another one of the best guys we know a gift certificate to Superior’s Steakhouse, and he used the card to treat the Shreveport-Bossier Journal staff to lunch with local sports icons Bobby Aillet and Leo Sanford.\n\nWe are easily led. Especially when free food is involved. And lunch with heroes.\n\nIn a comfy “meeting” room, we sat there for nearly three hours and overate and listened to these two Louisiana Tech Athletics Hall of Famers and, at the time, besties for 70 of their nearly 90 years as bona fide dudes.\n\nThere are worse ways to spend time and money.\n\nWhen Mr. Bobby died three years ago this week, age 93, it was J.J. Marshall who recalled that day and said to me, “I could have sat there and listened to them talk all afternoon.”\n\nWe just about did.\n\nAnd now Mr. Leo has passed this early spring at 94, two of the final members of The National Association for the Advancement of Grandstand Quarterbacks (NAAGQ), an exclusive “club” for more than 70 years, formed by Tech football teens going off to war in 1943, a group whose families grew up together and, through the years, grew old together.\n\nThey weren’t stingy about sharing stories — if they were asked. No chest-beating in this bunch. Thankfully, they shared enough of themselves that we’ll always have stuff to carry around.\n\nLeo was a member of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame, the Ark-La-Tex Museum of Champions, a star at Shreveport’s Fair Park High, a Pro Bowler in the NFL, a league champ in 1958 with Johnny Unitas and the Baltimore Colts, a humble bear of a man with oven-mitt-sized paws who, after this playing days, sold class rings and letter jackets to students all over the area; he sold that stuff but the smiles and understated jokes, he did those for free.\n\nHe loved to tell about him and another Tech recruit being driven from Shreveport to Ruston by legendary Tech football assistant Jimmy Mize, and Coach Mize asking Leo’s friend what he wanted to major in, and the kid said, “Engineering,” so then Coach Mize asked Leo the same thing, and Leo said he was thinking that if his buddy could learn to drive a train, so could he, so Leo said, “Engineering.”\n\nAnother one’s about Coach Joe Aillet with Leo and some other linemen in a crescent moon around Aillet and the coach hollers “I need a dummy!” and nothing happens for like five second so Leo jumped out toward coach and Aillet said, “Not you, Sanford. I need a BLOCKING dummy.” (Leo would tell the story and shrug his shoulders: “He said he needed a dummy so …”)\n\nWhen Sanford established the largest endowed scholarship in Tech Athletics history in honor of his wife Myrna after her passing in 2018, Leo told his buddies at their Friday morning unofficial club meeting at Shreveport’s Southfield Grill that “I’d be happy to have given the second-largest endowed scholarship if one of you other guys would step up.”\n\nIt was an almost ordained sort of special, the times Leo and Bobby and their football friends and families got to share. Disheartening to think it’s over, but then again, these were times built on love, and love never dies. No good thing ever does.\n\nSpeaking of love, this is from Myrna’s obit: “On their first real date he told her he was going to marry her, and she told him he was crazy. While she spent the next 68 years admitting he was right, she’d also tell you he was still crazy.”\n\nCurt Joiner, one of Leo’s sons-in-law, will tell you it’s always been a “good” kind of crazy. “I don’t know if there’s any guy in the world I enjoy spending an evening with more than my father-in-law,” Joiner said.\n\nA lot of guys share that feeling.\n\nContact Teddy at teddy@latech.edu\n\nToday’s bass boats are nothing short of incredible — and expensive! The accessories you can add to a bass boat are really cool and can make a huge difference in your ability to fish effectively. But which of these inventions has truly had the greatest impact on the sport of bass fishing? We’ll do a walk-thru from the front to the back of the boat and go over each of these features and their importance.\n\nWhen you buy a bass boat, it’s very similar to buying a new truck or car. There are all kinds of accessories that you can select to make your boat even better. There are some you might consider a luxury item while others are a necessity if you want to compete.\n\nLet’s first look at the very front of the boat and talk about the trolling motor. Nothing, in my opinion, has had a greater impact on the sport of bass fishing than the trolling motor. In 1934, O.G Schmidt invented the first electric trolling motor in Fargo, North Dakota. This invention revolutionized bass fishing by allowing an angler to navigate a body of water with ease without having to run the big engine. This device is used not as the primary means to propel the boat but makes navigation much easier especially in shallow water. From its inception, the trolling motor has served one purpose — to move the boat around quietly without spooking fish and is a standard feature on today’s bass boats.\n\nThese high-tech trolling motors can lock a boat down on one spot in open water. It will literally hold the boat in one position automatically with the push of a button, allowing the angler to fish an area or a spot more effectively. The days of using an anchor to hold a boat in place are gone with today’s new trolling motor technology.\n\nAlso located on the front deck of the boat are high-tech electronic fish locators. These units have made bass fishing so much easier, not just for professional anglers, but the novice angler as well. They allow anglers to see fish as far away as 100 feet on a screen the size of a small TV. They give great detail about the structure and contours of the lake bottom. They show water temperature, depth, GPS coordinates, timber, and grass and will tell you the composition of the bottom as to whether it’s hard or soft.\n\nWhy is this important? Hard spots are where bass like to set up, especially during the spawn. Today’s sonars show debris from lay down logs and rocks to brush piles along with clouds of baitfish. The detail is so good that an experienced angler can tell if the fish he’s looking at are bass, white perch, or catfish.\n\nMoving further to the back of the boat, let’s look at the dashboard. Today’s top of the line bass boats are mostly digital. Your gauges, including the speedometer, RPM, and temperature gauges, are all digital. Some have gauges that monitor the gas, oil, and battery levels, while some boats have a water temperature gauge for the livewells, ensuring that you can maintain a good temperature level for your fish in order to keep them alive for weigh-in.\n\nAnother advancement, one that might be the best safety feature ever invented for a bass boat, is the hot foot. The hot foot is a gas pedal that allows the angler to drive the boat just like a car or truck, with both hands on the steering wheel. It also allows for better boat control when navigating rough water conditions.\n\nThere’s also another feature that has become one of the best accessories you can put on a boat: a shallow water anchor system called Power Poles or Talons. The first product is made by a company called Power Pole while the Talons are made by Minn Kota. Power Poles fold out from the back of the boat while Talons are mounted on the back of the boat and descend straight down. Both are really good: it’s like comparing Ford or Chevrolet; which one do you like the best?\n\nBoth are great tools and will do exactly what they are designed to do, anchor you down in one spot. The only drawback to these units is that they are only designed for shallow water of 12 feet or less. When they first came out, I was a skeptic and thought it was a waste of money until I added one to my boat and realized how useful it was to have these on your boat. They come in handy when you’re having to sit down and retie or cull fish. They also come in handy when you are launching your boat or docking up for a weigh-in.\n\nAs you can see, bass boats have come a long way since the days of stick-steering banana-style boats. The features you can add are nothing short of incredible, but they do come with a cost. Major boat brands like Ranger, Skeeter, Caymas and Triton all have boats that fall into the $90,000 plus range.\n\nTo compare how far the price has jumped in the last 23 years, a fully loaded bass boat back then cost around $30,000. But today, some boats are hitting the crazy $100,000 mark! Why? The cost of building materials and the high level of accessories it takes to build a bass boat today have increased.\n\nSo, if you’re in the market for a new bass boat, prepare yourself for sticker shock as companies continue to improve and upgrade these high-tech water rockets that can reach speeds of 80 mph.\n\n‘Til next time, good luck, good fishing and make sure to check out Tackle Talk Live podcast, as well as the Hook’N Up & Track’N Down Show on YouTube.\n\nContact Steve at sgraf26@yahoo.com\n\nNo problem finding a column topic on Monday evening.\n\nBut enough about Caitlin Clark.\n\nApril Fool’s.\n\nHow can you say enough about Caitlin Clark? Or, for that matter, how both teams, Iowa and LSU, rose up and provided a performance worthy of the buildup to not only the game of the year in women’s hoops, but a pivotal collision of titans who have advanced their game in the last 12 months to the point where it is in the mainstream sports conversation, and not just at this time of the year.\n\nThank you, ladies. Thank you, competitors. And OMG, Caitlin Clark! I will always believe if Angel Reese doesn’t aggravate her injured ankle in the second quarter – after which the game began shifting Iowa’s way – the outcome would have been dramatic and perhaps different.\n\nBut I’m glad I watched. Not all big games live up to billing. This one did, even if there wasn’t an exciting finish.\n\nActually, I’m here to offer observations relevant to yesterday’s date.\n\nThere were some well-played 4-1 social media posts circulating. I’m still unsure if the Louisiana Downs racing calendar was one. Our resident Shreveport-Bossier Journal LaDowns dude, Tony Taglavore, points out that among 67 racing days announced Monday, none are Fridays or Sundays, and only five are Saturdays.\n\nAs Tony T wrote on his Facebook page, “Make no mistake about it, the track is not for locals. It’s so people across the country can wager on the races. Not a knock against the track. Just the way the business is now.”\n\nSpeaking of business, some fine monkey business focused on the local high school football scene and stirred plenty of perfectly-timed confusion Monday.\n\nCap tip to the X account @318Sports for “breaking” its April 1 story on the 2024 Battle on the Border prep football event. The matchups “announced” in the post included Calvary-Evangel, Airline-St. Thomas More, Northwood-Mater Dei (California), Southwood-St. John Bosco (I had to look it up, also in California), Loyola-John Curtis, and a trio of already active annual contests: Haughton-Parkway, West Monroe-Ruston and Green Oaks-BTW.\n\nAll games in the three-day event “will be streamed on ESPN+,” read the post. Uh, huh.\n\nThen @318Sports doubled down with a post reporting the Byrd-Captain Shreve Backyard Brawl this fall was moving to Tiger Stadium, and all plausibility went out the back door with “free admission, transportation, breakfast, lunch and dinner to all students.”\n\nMore than a few people went hook, line and sinker on those. Well done.\n\nApril 1 was a fine day for Ben Bolch to post “A LONG OVERDUE APOLOGY” on X. Bolch, whose name is very nearly Belch, was full of hot air when he wrote what actually WAS a “hit piece” on the LSU’s women’s basketball team previewing the Sweet Sixteen matchup of the Tigers and UCLA, the team he covers for the LA Times. Note I did not write “Los Angeles.” Instead the first initial represents the word “lame” and you can fill in the other word.\n\nBolch’s mind-blowing insult to the LSU team, and to women in sports, warranted not only an apology, but a deletion from existence, and he should be put in time out indefinitely, along with people up the editing chain there in La-La Land. If in fact his statement Monday was a sincere apology, he again fell woefully short.\n\nIf he were a player, coach or administrator, there would be cries for “sensitivity training” and other recriminations. Fines and suspensions. Bolch/Belch actually had the gall to say “it was not my intent to be hurtful … but I now understand that I terribly missed the mark.”\n\nNot calling for his head on a platter. But his laptop on the shelf for a while is appropriate.\n\nThat’s no April Fool’s joke.\n\nContact Doug at sbjdoug@gmail.com\n\nBy RON HIGGINS, Journal Sports\n\nBATON ROUGE – Malik Nabers woke up at 5 a.m. on Wednesday, five hours before the official start of LSU’s Pro Day in the Charles McClendon Practice Facility.\n\n“I’ve been ready to go at it,” said the former Tigers’ wide receiver who’s projected to be among the top 10 players selected in= the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft on April 25-27 in Detroit. “My legs were shaking a little bit I was so ready to get out here.”\n\nAs he has done in his entire LSU career, Nabers performed flawlessly under pressure. This time, it was provided by the watchful eyes of six NFL head coaches and more than 100 NFL assistants, scouts and other personnel on hand to put 13 draft-eligible Tigers through the paces.\n\nHis vertical jump measured 42 inches, which would have tied for second at February’s NFL combine if he had chosen to participate.\n\nAnd then after one false start and shifting his feet back and forth until he settled into a comfortable starting position, Nabers blazed the 40 in 4.35 seconds. It would have been the eighth fastest 40 at February’s NFL draft combine.\n\n“I was thinking about the 40 (yard dash),” said Nabers, a consensus first-team All-American last season when he led the nation in receiving yards per game (120.7). “I haven’t run it since high school. I started working on it two weeks ago.\n\n“I’d seen a lot of things in the media saying that I ran 4.5, 4.6 (in the 40). I wanted to come here and showcase I’m not even close to that, to showcase my dog mentality.”\n\nLSU head coach Brian Kelly, who was like a proud parent watching Wednesday’s proceedings, said Nabers’ 40 time and vertical number proves what makes him so great.\n\n“It validates what you see on film and that it’s backed up by great physical traits,” Kelly said of Nabers. “What it does more than anything else is that it shows he can separate with the ball in his hands, he can be explosive after the catch. Now it comes down to ‘who is the kind of guy who you want to get the ball in their hands’. I don’t think there’s a better receiver in the country.”\n\nHeisman Trophy-winning quarterback and possible No. 1 overall draft pick Jayden Daniels and likely top 15 draft choice wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. chose not to test in any of the six standard measurables (40-yard dash, 20-yard shuttle, 3-cone, vertical jump, broad jump and bench press.\n\nThomas tested at the NFL combine where he ran a 4.33 40, had 11 bench reps at 225 pounds and a 38½ inch vertical and leapt 10 feet, 6 inches in the standing broad jump.\n\nHe shined, as did Daniels and Nabers along with wide receiver/return specialist Greg Clayton and current Tigers wide receiver Kyren Lacy and tight Mason Taylor participated in a 58-play scripted passing drill.\n\nDaniels completed all but a handful of passes, most of incompletions on deep throws of which he also completed several.\n\n“The main thing I was trying to show was my consistency in the pocket,” Daniels said, “my footwork moving off the platform and getting my feet back under me, progressions coming back to the third read and putting the deep ball out there to showcase my guys (Nabers and Thomas Jr.) speed.”\n\nDaniels is projected to be drafted No. 1 overall by the Chicago Bears or No. 2 by the Washington Commanders.\n\n“It’s the same vibe for everybody,” said Daniels of any team wanting to draft him. “Who’s going to invest in me, who’s going believe in me – kind of LSU did – on and off the field.\n\n“It will be a blessing wherever I go, just hearing my name called.”\n\nIf drafted No. 1 by the Bears, Daniels is already slotted to sign a 4-year deal (with a team option for a fifth year) for a projected $38.5 million with a $24.8 million signing bonus. If drafted No. 2 by the Commanders, the length of the contract is the same, but he’ll be paid a projected $36.8 million with a $23.8 million signing bonus.\n\nSeven players participating in LSU’s Pro Day – Daniels, Nabers, Thomas Jr., center Charles Turner and defensive linemen Maason Smith, Mehki Wingo and Jordan Jefferson – have consistently shown up in seven-round mock drafts.\n\nOne player not projected to be drafted – linebacker Omar Speights – had a solid showing on Tuesday. He led all Tigers in the bench press with 30 reps, ran a 4.62 40 and had a 31½-inch vertical and a 10-foot standing broad jump.\n\nContact Ron at ronhigginsmedia@gmail.com\n\nBy the late JERRY BYRD, written for the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame, 1992\n\nIn 1943, when he was a sophomore at Shreveport’s Fair Park High, Leo Sanford was one of only four players on the football squad who didn’t get game uniforms.\n\nFifteen years later, he wrapped up an eight-year NFL career in a game that is still considered “the greatest game ever played.”\n\nBetween those milestones, Sanford helped Fair Park reach the 1945 state finals and helped Louisiana Tech win two Gulf States Conference championships.\n\nIn 1969, the 100th anniversary of college football, the Louisiana Sports Writers Associatioin selected an all-time Louisiana collegiate team. The centers were Max Fugler, from LSU’s 1958 national championship team, and Sanford.\n\nOffensive linemen rarely receive individual recognition, but Sanford played on both offense and defense in high school, college and in the NFL. He was a starting linebacker in the 1957 and 1958 Pro Bowls, but throughout his career was equally effective at center.\n\nUntil his senior year at Fair Park, Sanford’s chief claim to fame was winning All-City distinction in the trombone three times in elementary school and twice at Fair Park. As a senior, he was a backup linebacker on a team that reached the Class AA state finals before bowing to Holy Cross of New Orleans.\n\nReturning the following season for an extra year of eligibility, as many prep players did at that time, Sanford stood out on a Fair Park team that lost the district championship to Haynesville. After the 1946 Indians completed their season, with a 12-7 Thanksgiving Day victory over Byrd, Sanford had scholarship offers from LSU, Florida and Louisiana Tech.\n\nHe chose Tech because of two people: Joe Aillet and Myrna Mims. Aillet was Tech’s head coach, while Mims was the future Mrs. Leo Sanford. She was working in Shreveport, and Sanford didn’t want to attend a school so far away that he couldn’t visit her frequently.\n\nIn his sophomore year at Tech Sanford played a key role in the Bulldogs’ 13-13 tie with Auburn. His 50-yard interception return for a touchdown was erased by a penalty on the runback, but the turnover set up a Tech TD.\n\nThe highlight of his four years at Tech was a 33-13 victory over Mississippi Southern, which was considered the No. 1 small-college team in the nation that year. Jimmy Harrison and Gene Knecht were Tech’s offensive stars in that win, while Sanford led a charge that held Mississippi Southern to minus 12 yards rushing.\n\nSanford was a three-year starter, All-GSC two years in a row, and was captain of the 1950 Bulldogs.\n\nHe was a sixth-round selection of the Chicago Cardinals in the NFL Draft. Several weeks later, Sanford received a standard player contract in the mail. If he made the team, he would be paid $5,000 for the 1951 season. Sanford, who was making $275 a month with Pan Am Southern Oil in New Orleans, decided it would behoove him to make the team.\n\nAt 6-1, 220, he was a bit small to play center and linebacker in the NFL. But he made up for it with great quickness and versatility. In high school and college, he had played for teams using the direct center snap (before the T-formation took over). His deep snapping ability was a plus for his NFL aspirations.\n\nHe had plenty of competition. Another rookie candidate for the Cardinals’ center position was Notre Dame All-American Jerry Groom, a first-round draft choice. Still another was Knox Ramsey, younger brother of Cardinals’ linebacker coach Buster Ramsey. When the coach moved his brother to a guard position, Sanford felt he had an excellent chance to make the team.\n\nHe called defensive signals for the Cardinals in 1956 and had two interceptions and a fumble recovery in a victory over the Eagles. One of his career highlights was a club-record 92-yard touchdown on an interception return against the Steelers.\n\n“Leo is one of the league’s finest linebackers because of his speed,” said Cardinals’ coach Ray Richards.\n\nAfter seven seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Baltimore Colts just in time for their championship season in 1958 – capped by a come-from-behind 23-17 overtime victory over the New York Giants that would be called “the greatest game ever played.”\n\nIt was the last game Sanford ever played. He tore up his right knee in the first half, but still managed to limp back out for deep snaps – including the one for Steve Myhra’s 20-yard field goal with seven seconds remaining in regulation to force overtime.\n\nThat snap was the final play of Sanford’s career. He attempted a comeback in 1959, but his knee gave out in the second week of training camp. Sanford spend the season in the press box, scouting opponents.\n\nHe gave pro football one more shot in 1960, trying out for the expansion Dallas Cowboys. Once again, the knee didn’t cooperate. After a couple of weeks, Sanford told coach Tom Landry he was calling it a career.\n\nBy that time, he was already a sporting goods salesman in the offseason. He later switched to the senior ring business, traveling the Ark-La-Tex for many years..\n\nThis profile was written for the 1992 book “Louisiana Sports Legends” book comprised of Jerry Byrd’s profiles of every inductee of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. Sanford was enshrined in 1990. He died last week at age 94 and will be laid to rest today in his hometown after a family funeral service.\n\nThis is a special time of year, for many reasons. For the outdoorsman and woman, fishing is on the verge of getting white-hot and it’s about time to start chasing gobblers.\n\nThere is one thing that more and more outdoor enthusiasts have taken an interest in over the past few years. Seed and feed stores will bear this out. Bird watching has grown into a sport that is attracting not only the Jane Hathaway types but good ole boys and girls as well. Birdseed, feeders and bird books are hot items today.\n\nThis is the time of year when a plethora of species make the unbelievable trek from South and Central America to move into our woods, some to nest and some to make brief stops on their way north. The best way to know just which wild bird species are paying you a visit is to get yourself prepared to view them. Here are a few essentials to make this sport more enjoyable.\n\nBIRD FEEDERS – These come in a variety of shapes and styles. You can buy them, or you can make them yourself. My personal favorite is one I once constructed that was squirrel-proof. I nailed a 3-foot square of plywood on top of a length of old power pole that extends some five feet above the ground. Before securing the plywood, I slipped a length of sheet metal pipe, something like a stovepipe, over the pole, making it difficult for squirrels and raccoons to climb.\n\nBIRDSEED – I use two types; a black oil sunflower and wild bird mix. Others use thistle for finches or suet for woodpeckers and nuthatches. Be sure you replenish the supply regularly, especially after a rain since birdseed will spoil if left wet and unattended too long.\n\nWATER – Birds, like humans, need water. A birdbath located somewhere in the yard will attract birds that come to water and bathe. A pump in the bath that circulates water will often attract warblers and other species that are not seed-eaters.\n\nBINOCULARS – Leave a good pair of binoculars near your easy chair or wherever you can sit and watch what goes on around your feeder. Good viewing glasses makes bird identification so much simpler.\n\nBIRD BOOKS – I have several and these are invaluable in helping me determine which species I’m viewing. I also keep a log of new sightings to help me build a list of birds I’ve identified.\n\nAnother type of bird will be here any day now, but you won’t find it feeding on sunflower seeds. It’s hummingbird time and they’re easy to attract. All you need to do is hang a couple of hummingbird feeders outside your window for a colorful aerial display.\n\nHere are some facts about these tiny creatures you might find interesting.\n\nHummingbirds wings beat about 55 times per second in normal flight, and up to 200 beats per second during courtship and territorial displays.\n\nTop speed for the hummingbird is about 60 miles per hour.\n\nDuring migration, hummingbirds may travel 500 miles non-stop across the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTheir nests are no bigger than a half dollar and their eggs the size of an English pea.\n\nFEEDER TIPS\n\nMake your own hummingbird food by mixing one part granulated white sugar to four parts water; never substitute honey for sugar.\n\nHang feeders in the open but shaded areas, especially under eaves next to hanging flower baskets.\n\nClean your feeders every two to three days so the liquid does not ferment. Feeders should be cleaned with vinegar or bleach (not soap) and then rinsed with scalding water.\n\nDon’t worry about when to take your feeders down. Hummingbirds know when to leave. Late season feeding of northern migrants often occurs after your resident birds have already gone. They won’t stay behind and freeze.\n\nWhile hummingbirds need nectar for energy, they also rely on insect protein for body and feather growth. When insect levels fall, the birds begin to leave.\n\nBird watching…it’s inexpensive, it’s rewarding and it’s fun. And I’m glad that even good ole boys can enjoy it.\n\nContact Glynn at glynnharris37@gmail.com"
