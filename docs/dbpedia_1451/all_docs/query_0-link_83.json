        "text": "By Ryan Sophabmixay, Student Correspondent\n\nStudying abroad is an exciting experience for many students. However, assimilating to the new culture and surroundings can be challenging. Peter Amicucci ’22, Poughquag, New York, welcomed those challenges. While attending The University of Scranton, Amicucci became actively involved in campus life by joining the wrestling team and musical programs. He joined the concert choir during his senior year and was a member of the jazz, symphonic and concert band and won a Fulbright-Lappeenranta University of Technology Graduate Award to Finland. There, he embarked on a journey to continue his education while finding ways to understand and enjoy the Finnish culture.\n\nBeginning in the spring of 2021, Amicucci dedicated one year toward working on his Fulbright application. The process for the prestigious international academic exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government consisted of background checks, multiple short answer questions and two essays: a personal essay and a statement of purpose. In addition, Amicucci reached out to professors in Finland to fulfill the affiliation requirement in the Fulbright application process.\n\nHe later met with The University of Scranton Fulbright board and panel members to finalize his application by October 2021. After waiting several months, Amicucci became a national finalist for the Fulbright grant in March 2022. He described the joy he felt reading the message.\n\n“I saw I got the grant, and I started jumping up and down like a lunatic,” Amicucci said.\n\n“The Fulbright application was the most intense application I’ve done in my life. But it was something I had always wanted to do. I’m glad I applied.”\n\nThe transition to LUT was not too difficult for Amicucci. Amicucci attended orientation the week before classes began and had tutors (orientation assistants) and second-year students guide him in locating classes and developing his schedule. The biggest differences Amicucci noticed: the college education and student culture.\n\n“Finland college education is more tradition based. Finland has mandatory events that are considered rites of passage. One event is Vappu Eve, where all students completing the first year of university do their baptism,” Amicucci said.\n\n“The process varies from university to university. One school has a crane, and they gather three to four people at a time. …We have two metal slides and people go down in the water two at a time.”\n\nHe described the helpful environment among the student population. “The student culture was very different,” he said. “Within each major there is a great community where if someone feels like they are struggling with something, and the professor is not available, they can go in and find someone to help them.”\n\nAt Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, Fulbright award recipient Peter Amicucci '22, pictured back row, center, was a member of the Big Band, which is the university’s professional level jazz band\n\nAttending LUT, Amicucci also got involved with music groups. He is a member of the Lappeenranta Big Band, which is the university’s professional level jazz band, and the Teekkarilaulajat men’s choir for LUT.\n\nLast year, Amicucci, along with other choir members, performed in a coffee advertisement for Lehmus Roastery. The Finnish brand used the ad to promote its holiday line of coffee, specifically the Kettu-kahville, which translates to fox coffee. He described his experiences, which included wearing a fox-themed costume.\n\n“Going through the process of recording and filming the commercial was actually a cool thing,” Amicucci said.“The shoot was supposed to take two hours, but the same day there was a graduation gig … and we were double-booked. As soon as I finished my scenes, I took off the fox costume and rushed over to the university.”\n\nPeter Amicucci ’22, pictured above at center, played two successful seasons with the Lappeenranta University football team, helping them through two national championship games.\n\nBeyond music, Amicucci reconnected with his love for American football in Finland. He played two successful seasons with the Lappeenranta University football team, helping them through two national championship games. Though not victorious, Amicucci enjoyed sharing the field with his teammates.\n\n“I got to experience their view on the sport and at the same time got to show my view on the game …,” Amicucci said.\n\nAmicucci always had a strong interests in music. During the pandemic, he learned to play the violin because of the safety guidelines.\n\n“Transition from brass to violin was more difficult than instrument to vocals. I like to be challenged when it comes to music. And I feel like the violin checked off all the boxes,” Amicucci said.\n\nAmicucci said he still incorporates the Jesuit teachings learned at Scranton in his daily life.\n\n“The Jesuit education has helped a lot in guiding me through the community. The values are always there. The care for the whole person is stressed a lot in Finland,” Amicucci said.\n\nAmicucci is set to graduate LUT with a master’s degree in supply management and a minor in sustainable business. He plans to return to the U.S in July and would like to work in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Although he looks forward to returning home, Amicucci appreciates his time in Finland and will carry the lessons he learned throughout his career.\n\n“If you think you’re going to study abroad, just ... break the bubble. Experience a lot,\" said Amicucci.\n\n“It’s bittersweet to leave Finland, but maybe down the line, I’ll get a summer cottage and visit a couple months a year.”\n\nA view of the Northern Lights as photographed in Finland by Peter Amicucci '22.\n\nBy Grace Whittam '24\n\nSarah Flanagan ’20, G’21 of Northford, Connecticut, embarked on a journey to become a pediatric occupational therapist, a path marked by resilience, dedication and the pursuit of helping others. She now serves as a pediatric occupational therapist at Cheshire Fitness Zone in Cheshire, Connecticut, where she aids in building up children’s autonomy and confidence.\n\n“I love witnessing the excitement when a child develops a new skill or level of independence and how that translates to what is meaningful to them at their stage of life,” Flanagan said.\n\nFrom a young age, Flanagan felt a calling to work with people with disabilities. Her journey to this path started long before she first toured The University of Scranton. The affinity for helping others began when she was 14 at Camp Nerden, a special needs summer camp in Middlefield, Connecticut, which her guidance counselor recommended she check out in order to complete mandatory service hours set by her high school.\n\n“She had no idea what she recommended was something that would literally change my life,” Flanagan said.\n\nBy the end of the summer going into her sophomore year of high school, Flanagan had completed the recommended curriculum hours for her to graduate. Nevertheless, she continued to volunteer there year after year, and the summers at Camp Nerden became Flanagan’s favorite part of the year.\n\nTransitioning from a volunteer to a staff member, Flanagan spent over a decade at Camp Nerden forming deep connections with campers. Both Flanagan and her sister have shown steadfast dedication to Camp Nerden and have formed relationships with campers that have changed their lives for the better – a testament to the love shared on the camp’s grounds.\n\n“Camp is truly a place where people can come and fully be themselves. It is a place to feel free, seen, loved and supported – not just for campers, but for the staff as well,” Flanagan said.\n\nThe Flanagan sisters recently made a favored camper’s day by spending her birthday with her; their friendship, which began over a decade ago when the camper was five, was one of the formative experiences at Camp Nerden that helped inspire Flanagan’s decision to become an occupational therapist.\n\n“At camp, I needed to utilize the resources available to create meaningful, motivating outdoor activities and adapt the activity accordingly for each group that came through with a variety of factors such as different ages and level of cognitive and physical ability,” Flanagan said.\n\nFlanagan brought her passion for helping others with her as she started touring colleges. Upon visiting The University of Scranton, she fell in love with Leahy Hall’s occupational therapy labs.\n\n“Especially in preparing for such a hands-on profession, I wanted to be able to apply what we were learning in our textbooks to real life scenarios and materials,” Flanagan said.\n\nBut choosing Scranton was not just about academics for Flanagan. After attending a Catholic high school, she felt connected to the Jesuit values Scranton holds close to its core. Flanagan wanted to be on a campus that not only integrated these values into education, but also fostered them around the community.\n\nShe felt particularly connected to the Jesuit value of “cura personalis.” This value calls for “care of the whole person,” something Flanagan takes into her work every day and applies to every client interaction she has. She works to understand her patients’ values, beliefs, routines and roles, and she uses that knowledge as the foundation of their occupation profile.\n\n“Occupational therapy is a holistic profession, so we treat more than just the symptoms we are presented with. Understanding the patient allows us to develop a full picture of who they are and how the entire person is impacted by the diagnosis or symptoms they are seeking therapy for,” Flanagan said.\n\nWhile on campus, Flanagan was involved in many activities, including the Relay for Life Committee, Praise and Worship, Royal Signers and the Student Occupational Therapy Association; she also participated in many intramural sports, where she often achieved “smashing success.” Flanagan was a leader for the Manresa retreat and had on-campus jobs at the mail room and the Office of Admissions.\n\nIn a memorable assignment from an activity analysis course, Flanagan was tasked with filling a bag of 20 OT-based activities, staying within a $20 budget. This assignment altered Flanagan’s perspective and pushed her to think creatively about how one simple material can be applied to different physical, cognitive and social task areas.\n\n“To this day I can look at a simple dollar store material like a pipe cleaner or bubble wrap and think of multiple ways it can be used to address goals,” Flanagan said.\n\nThis helped Flanagan become better attuned to her clients’ or students’ varying needs as she is prepared to respond to them anywhere from a fully-equipped therapy room to a utility closet with little to no materials provided.\n\n“This has also helped to keep therapy sessions unique and interesting for my clients, as I am able to use the same materials in new, different ways throughout a plan of care,” Flanagan said.\n\nAfter passing her National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, Flanagan has been working as a pediatric occupational therapist in an outpatient setting and elementary schools for almost two years, bringing the value of “cura personalis” to each patient she sees.\n\nBeginning her mornings at one of three elementary schools, Flanagan helps students in special education functionally participate in curriculum expectations and normal classroom routines. She focuses on activities like handwriting, typing, cutting, coloring, visual perception and completing multi-step tasks.\n\n“I recommend accommodations and modifications to the environment to help promote success for my students in class,” Flanagan said.\n\nAfter she leaves elementary schools, she heads to her outpatient clinic, where she services clients with varying goals and needs, including fine motor development, visual motor and perceptual skills, cognition, sensory processing and emotional regulation.\n\nFlanagan appreciates the way pediatric occupational therapy can help children to gain a sense of autonomy and reach their potential.\n\n“I love that I can be a support for families of children with disabilities and enable functional, safe participation in family tasks as independently as possible,” Flanagan said.\n\nYet, Flanagan acknowledges the challenges of transitioning from student to practitioner. Thanks to a supportive mentorship program, she navigated this journey with guidance.\n\n“I try to integrate self-care like exercise into my week as much as possible because it’s important that I’m bringing my most regulated self to sessions to help regulate the children I work with,” Flanagan said.\n\nThrough it all, Flanagan has remained committed to pediatric occupational therapy. In the years to come, she will continue to rely on the fundamental and in-depth knowledge she learned from the occupational therapy classes and labs that originally caught her attention at Scranton, and she hopes to expand her knowledge and work with more specific treatments, specifically in the neuro aspect of pediatric occupational therapy.\n\n“Each course at Scranton was integrated with the activity analysis component that truly taught me to ‘think like an OT,’” Flanagan said.\n\nThe University of Scranton Athletic Department will induct six new members into its Wall of Fame on Saturday, Feb. 3.\n\nThe Class of 2024 is comprised of Kristen (Best) Higgins '04 (Women's Swimming & Diving), Travis Farrell '13 (Men's Basketball), Jerry Rivers '82 (Wrestling), Samantha Russo '13 (Women's Soccer), Katie Slade '11 (Women's Lacrosse) and Joe Veselovsky '09 (Men's Swimming & Diving).\n\nAn induction ceremony will take place between games of a men's and women's basketball doubleheader against Catholic at the John Long Center.\n\nThere will also be inductee remarks and a cocktail reception to be held at 5:30 p.m. on campus. Register here to be a part of Scranton history.\n\nThe Wall of Fame was founded in 1970 to honor student-athletes, administrators and those in the community who have been instrumental in the overall development of the University's athletics program.

Veselovsky is also the only four-time conference champion in program history.\n\nHe continues to hold the program record in the 400 IM with a time of 4:13.02 that was set on Feb. 10, 2007, which is the longest-standing program record. Veselovsky also holds the second-fastest time in the 200 fly, sixth-best in 200 IM and seventh-best in the 100 fly.\n\nScranton's second-place finish at the 2009 Landmark Championships was the best finish in program history at the time.\n\nBy Grace Whittam ’24\n\nWhile navigating across the DeNaples Center, Brennan Hall and the lacrosse field during his student days, Matt Grilli ’19 fell in love with the sense of community he found on The University of Scranton campus. Today, he charts a new course through the business world as an account executive on the sales team of SiriusXM Media, a broadcasting corporation with over 5,800 employees.\n\n“There’s never a bad day in Scranton. There may be a rainy one, but never a bad one,” Grilli said.\n\nGrilli, 26, of Chatham, New Jersey, graduated from The University of Scranton in 2019 with a degree in marketing. His interest in marketing and advertising was initially piqued during his junior year of high school by a guest speaker at a school event.\n\n“Marketing was a good mix, in my eyes, to work in business, which was interesting to me, but (being) on the more creative front of everything and helping brands’ success through advertising was my true interest,” Grilli said.\n\nA scion of a family where nearly everyone studied at a Jesuit university, Grilli said his family’s commitment to Jesuit education helped narrow his search for the right college. Early into that process, Grilli found that he gravitated toward a smaller school environment, which made Scranton a great fit.\n\n“From my two visits, I knew that I would fit in with the student body,” he said. “The people at Scranton are welcoming, whether you are on the hill, in the classroom, or out and about on campus. It’s a great feeling to know that people have your back around campus, and somehow I felt that the moment I stepped on the campus.”\n\nThe Kania School of Management at The University of Scranton and its dedicated professors exposed Grilli to a variety of knowledge in and out of the classroom. This included studying investment strategies through the Bloomberg Terminals, marketing and advertising techniques, and even exploring the various religions of the world. Grilli appreciated the uniqueness of Jesuit education’s commitment to learning about all types of faith traditions, including those outside of the Catholic and Christian realms.\n\n“Going to a school that had these values, that put emphasis on having smaller classes and a true focus on education, is so evident at Scranton, and it’s such a special part of the education,” Grilli said.\n\nDuring Grilli’s time in Scranton, he became involved in various activities, including the business club, the marketing society and the Men’s Lacrosse team, which he played on for the entirety of his college experience. Additionally, he participated in entrepreneur society events and community service programs, and he never missed a dinner on the third floor of the DeNaples Center.\n\n“Third floor was an every evening thing for us after lacrosse practice,” Grilli said. “You’re sharing and breaking bread with your closest friends all in one place.\n\n“It’s really a special place.”\n\nMen’s Lacrosse was instrumental in forming Grilli’s deep sense of community while at Scranton. A four-year goalie on the team, Grilli took underclassmen under his wing as he grew older, serving as a mentor on and off the field. Some of his favorite memories originated from the team’s spring break trips, where the bonding that occurred often made up for missing Scranton’s parade day festivities.\n\n“Being able to leave college and be friends with not only people who were in my graduating class, but with people who were two, three or four, even, years younger or older than me was really important,” he said. “I was still able to feel close to the school four years after I graduated because I still had friends and teammates there.”\n\nEvery year around Thanksgiving, the lacrosse team assisted local food shelters with delivering prepared meals for Thanksgiving Day feasts. Grilli and many of his teammates were recruited by Rev. Daniel Sweeney, S.J., assistant professor of political science and faculty athletic advisor, to join the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service organization. Grilli said the sense of community he loved at Scranton evolved even further through the volunteer events he participated in with the Knights of Columbus and through Fr. Sweeney, who said occasional Masses for the team on Sunday mornings.\n\n“(Fr. Sweeney) was very close with the team,” Grilli said. “Being able to have a priest and that element of faith active in our team and larger community was so great.”\n\nDuring his senior year, Grilli utilized the connections he’d made through networking to explore whether a career in advertising might be a good fit for him.\n\n“I think it’s important to use your network and to be guided to help solidify your interests and passions,” he said. “I’m feeling really good about the career so far, and I owe it all to the people who (helped) me my senior year and my first year working on the agency side.”\n\nGrilli began his career in advertising work at an agency called Essence shortly after graduating. After nearly nine months in the workforce, however, the world drastically changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Zoom meetings and remote work became the new norm, that sense of community Grilli valued began to diminish, making it harder for him to establish himself as a new employee in the workforce and build relationships with clients and colleagues.\n\n“It's easy to be the first one in and the last one to leave when you can see everyone, but it’s a little harder when you’re online,” Grilli said. “The Covid situation made me work a lot harder.”\n\nAbout two-and-a-half years ago, he transitioned away from advertising and took a position on the sales side of operations with SiriusXM Media. Since starting with Sirius, Grilli has been happy to be back in the office, where spending time with his coworkers in a collaborative environment has rekindled the sense of community he found he sorely missed during the height of the pandemic.\n\n“It may be more difficult to commute into an office, but once you are there, I think it is very rewarding from a business and mental health standpoint,” he said.\n\nGrilli said he appreciates the culture and environment within SiriusXM Media, which he compares to the comradery he found walking the halls of the DeNaples Center.\n\nIn terms of advice for seniors, Grilli emphasized the importance of trusting that Scranton is helping seniors get to the place they want to be in their career. As long as they are putting in their best effort, students should trust that the first job or school acceptance will come.\n\n“Don’t put too much pressure on yourself,” he said. “Make sure to have a super fun senior year, but have as many conversations as you can, whether that be by connecting on LinkedIn with different alumni or other connections.\n\n“Getting on the phone with those people already in the workforce is something I would say is really important if you’re having doubts about what to do next.”\n\nAlso, he encouraged all seniors to broaden their social circles by proactively meeting at least 10 new people during the course of senior year, a practice he said significantly enhanced his college experience.\n\n“Keep those special relationships close in the years after graduation and be sure to see those people as much as you can,” Grilli said.\n\nOn Oct. 19, John O’Malley ’87, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army Retired, will embark upon ROAR: The Ryan O’Malley Annual Ride for the fifth time by participating in the Arizona Trail Race 800, the longest single track mountain bike race in the world, in support of the Ryan T. O’Malley ’99 Memorial Scholarship.\n\nThis year, John will by vying for the \"Triple Crown of Bikepacking,\" a distinction earned by completing all three of the classic dirt bikepacking routes in the United States: the Arizona Trail, the Tour Divide/Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, and the Colorado Trail. To date, only 33 people have earned this distinction.\n\nAfter Ryan's passing in 2011, his family established the scholarship in his memory to enable Computer Science students of limited resources with an interest in fitness to attend The University of Scranton. Since that time, Ryan's family and friends have raised more than $160,000 for the scholarship, much of it through ROAR: The Ryan O'Malley Annual Race, a 5K fundraising event the family organized from 2013-2017. In 2018, John, Ryan’s brother, embarked upon the inaugural ROAR: The Ryan O’Malley Annual Ride by cycling the 500+ miles of The Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango in Ryan’s memory. While John rode The Colorado Trail again for ROAR in 2019 and 2020, he was sidelined by injuries and knee surgery in 2021.\n\nWhile John embarked upon the Tour Divide in June of 2022, a life-threatening accident 125 miles from the 2,665.7-mile race's finish line landed him in an intensive care/trauma unit. Eighty-four days later, he returned to the scene of the accident and triumphantly finished the final leg of the race.\n\n“I ride to remember and honor our brother, Ryan, with whom I shared a common love of adventure, sport and cycling,” he said. “I ride to give back in some way to the community who nurtured us. Through the ROAR and Ryan’s scholarship, we help to provide students with limited financial resources the opportunity to attend The University of Scranton. The purpose of the annual ride is to seek donations for the scholarship fund, to increase awareness of suicide prevention and to promote physical health and well-being. If I can inspire anyone to get outside and exercise, it’s a win.\n\n\"In a more philosophical sense, I take on such endeavors to expand my mind and my potential, to be more capable in all aspects of life. This is how I live my life. We are all capable of so much more.\"\n\nA Lifelong Love\n\nJohn’s love of cycling and adventure began when he was growing up in the Green Ridge section of Scranton.\n\n“Bikes were a big deal back then, and if you had one, you were a lucky kid,” he said. “ For me, the bike became an instrument of exploration, discovery and freedom.”\n\nAs the oldest child of John J. O’Malley, Ph.D. ’64, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University, and his wife, Helene, John shared his love of cycling with his five siblings, especially Ryan, his youngest brother.\n\n“As a kid, time and distance had little meaning,” he said of the hours they spent exploring the NEPA area together. “We’d just ride, inspired by the adventure and the natural beauty of the region.”\n\nUpon graduating from the University, John began his military career in Ft. Carson, Colorado, where he started racing mountain bikes. Since then, he has continued to ride and race, competing in triathlons and adventure races throughout the country. When he and his family settled in Monument, Colorado, he became so inspired by the expanses and terrain he saw on two wheels that he proposed the idea of funding Ryan’s scholarship through an annual bike ride, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe Arizona Trail Race 800\n\nThe Arizona Trail Race 800, like the Tour Divide and the Colorado Trail, is a solo, self-supported race where John will be carrying all his required gear and food. The longest single track mountain bike race in the world, the race traverses the Arizona National Scenic Trail, extending from the Mexican border to the Utah border with 70,107 feet of elevation gain from start to finish. Starting at the U.S.-Mexico border, the trail climbs and descends from one “sky island” mountain range to another, gaining and losing thousands of feet in elevation and traversing biomes ranging from desert to boreal forest.\n\n\"This will likely be the most challenging of the three triple crown events,\" John said, adding that the diverse terrain will demand plenty of technical riding and \"hike-a-bike\" action. Given the trail's remote nature, John believes it will be difficult to find water sources and places to replenish his necessary supplies. As an added challenge, after riding 700 miles, he will be required to disassemble his bike at the north rim of the Grand Canyon, put it on his back, and hike 21 miles to the south rim. Because of these conditions, John anticipates finishing the race in about 20 days while averaging 40-45 miles a day. In order to maintain that pace and to hike the 50 pounds of bike and gear he will have to carry, he plans to consume about 300-400 calories an hour. Throughout his journey, John will provide daily updates on his Facebook account. Interested parties can track the race and his progress at trackleaders.com once the race begins.\n\n\"Competing in the Arizona Trail Race 800 is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" he said. \"I am blessed to have the time, resources, health and support to take on such an endeavor. I’m going to give it my best shot and hope to inspire others get outside, stay healthy and live life to the fullest – just like Ryan would!\n\n\"No matter how hard things may get for me, I think about people who are struggling with depression or other mental or physical illness. I have it easy. I am merely the guy riding a bike.\"\n\nJohn thanked his wife, Kathi, their daughters, Kaitlyn and Jenna, his entire family, and the greater Scranton community for supporting his endeavors.\n\n\"The University of Scranton has been instrumental in this support, especially Bridget Chomko and the Office of Annual Giving,\" he said. \"Bridget has been with us since the very beginning and works tirelessly to help us attain success each year.\"\n\nJohn attributes any success in cycling and life in general to his upbringing in Scranton and the long hard days on the gridiron and ball fields of his hometown.\n\n\"The work ethic, values and grit instilled in me at a young age have carried me through challenging times in the military and in sport and adventure,\" he said. \"My experience at the U with long hours spent in the ROTC program and the weight room set me up for success in life.\n\n\"The people who raised, coached and nurtured me while growing up in Scranton are my greatest life heroes. The University of Scranton was truly our home away from home.\"\n\nVisit this link to support ROAR and The Ryan T. O'Malley '99 Memorial Scholarship Fund.\n\nBy Grace Whittam ’24\n\nMartina Martin ’80 found a vocation and a lifetime of meaningful work in the global and local United Way system. She largely credits this vocation to the teachings and lessons she learned through The University of Scranton’s Socratic approach to education.\n\n“If you can come out of the University and appreciate that Socratic approach early on, you’re much better off,” she said. “It’s so much better to use that ‘inquiry over advocacy’ approach.”\n\nMartin, a Scranton native, began her education at the University in the fall of 1976, graduating Magna Cum Laude in 1980. This was during Scranton’s initial years of coeducation, and Martin was a part of the University’s fourth graduating class of women.\n\nMartin’s time at the University was marked by many noteworthy achievements and activities, including membership in the Jesuit Honors Program and the University Singers and being elected vice president of the Business Club. She commuted to campus and was the first member of her family to graduate college. Originally in pre-med, Martin found a better fit in business administration and marketing through a unique set of circumstances some might call “cura personalis.”\n\nThrough the Jesuit Honors Program, Martin was empowered to create a course that catered to what she wanted to learn, as long as she could find someone to teach it. When she expressed her desire to take an advertising course, she was directed to reach out to a local top advertising professional, Bill Donovan. Donovan agreed to teach and mentor Martin in a one-on-one advertising course if she agreed to help him start up his own public relations and advertising firm in Northeast Pennsylvania – and they did just that. Martin’s professional life started at Bill Donovan Communications during her third year at the University, and she continued on at that company for almost three years following graduation. Working for Donovan gave Martin a crash course in many different aspects of the communication, PR, advertising, and marketing fields, and it paved the way to her future success.\n\n“It was a wonderful way to be exposed to so many pieces of nonprofit, professional, and for-profit professions that I was positioned well for my next job,” she said.\n\nSeeking to help others with her newfound skills, Martin began volunteering on the communications committee of United Way of Lackawanna County, which is the local member of United Way Worldwide, a global nonprofit organization serving 37 countries and territories.\n\nA few years later, Martin became the director of communications and marketing at United Way of Wyoming Valley. She then committed 11 years as a senior manager at United Way Worldwide in Alexandra, Virginia, where she aided the efforts of United Way organizations and Fortune 500 companies across the country and beyond who were engaged in community philanthropy. Today, Martin is the senior vice president and COO of United Way of Central Maryland in Baltimore.\n\nA central part of Martin’s work was to help visiting delegations from all corners of the world who were trying to export American concepts of philanthropy in ways that fit their governments and cultures. In that capacity, she has worked with people from the United Kingdom, Japan, China and many other nations. Martin believes these cultural exchanges result in beneficial outcomes for everyone involved.\n\n“It’s makes for such a rich life to be with all different types of people,” she said.\n\nA personal favorite part of her work is seeing the way people who would otherwise not interact with one another come together for the betterment of their community.\n\n“Whether it be by race, gender, age, political orientation (or) sexual orientation, people who are otherwise sometimes fierce competitors come together because they care about their community,” Martin said. “That’s what United Way is all about.”\n\nThe United Way in Baltimore shifted its fundamental strategy in 2012 when it began focusing on directly incubating solutions to complex issues of poverty faced by low-wage earners known as ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed) who work hard but struggle to make ends meet. For example, the organization created family centers for teenage parents to help them complete high school while simultaneously providing care for their children. This became one of the most rewarding part of Martin’s work as the family center program, staffed by United Way employees, has bested the national average graduation rate for parenting teens by almost 30% .\n\n“When I think about what’s most rewarding, we are always, as an organization, moving to the next intersection of where’s the need, and what can we bring to bear on it,” Martin said. “It allows you to stay with an organization for a very long time, because it’s never the same organization.”\n\nMartin has been recognized for her work on numerous occasions. An O’Hara Award recipient, she was named one of Maryland’s Top 100 Women three times and received a Maryland Icon Award. Although she said she didn’t fully appreciate the University’s Socratic approach to education until the middle of her career, it’s clear that it aided her as she sought to produce better ideas and encourage inclusive thought. She emphasized the importance of seeking advice and inspiration from the people you look up to, and she encouraged all Scranton students to utilize Scranton’s alumni network to do just that.\n\n“There are people at all stages of their career ready to hire Scranton grads,” she said. “Do not hesitate to use the wonderful network of Scranton alumni all over the world.”\n\nIn a world where change is seemingly the only constant, Martin’s life at United Way continues to grow and develop to meet the needs of the people she serves.\n\n“It is not just a job,” she said. “It’s my vocation and avocation. That mission is so important, and that’s the thing that gets all of us through the days that are more heavy-duty.”\n\nThe University has released photos from the public launch of \"A Fire That Kindles Other Fires: The Campaign To Advance Mission, Access, & Excellence,\" its new $135 million capital campaign. See the photos here.\n\nThe University celebrated the campaign's launch with a black-tie gala attended by more than 350 guests in the Byron Recreation Complex on campus Sept. 16. The historic campaign, the largest in the University's 135-year history, will advance Scranton’s mission, accessibility and excellence.\n\n“A Fire that Kindles Other Fires is an expression borrowed from the 35th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus. It is a reference to moving into the future with all of the history and tradition of the past; with the same identity but with a new energy in pursuit of new possibilities,” said Rev. Joseph Marina, S.J., president of The University of Scranton. “It is also a reference to people – the people who have been touched by the power of a Catholic and Jesuit education and now move through the world as agents of change and messengers of the gospel, kindling other fires.”\n\nMission-related goals of the campaign include continued investment in state-of-the-art facilities, laboratories, learning spaces, such as the renovations made in Hyland Hall to support the mechanical engineering program, and initiatives that support core aspects of a Scranton Jesuit education, such as the programming and scholarships offered through the Gail and Francis Slattery Center for the Ignatian Humanities.\n\n“The wonderful truth remains that anything and everything we do at Scranton should be and will be done for our students first,” said Father Marina. “Our shared focus is precisely where it belongs: on our students and their success.”\n\nThe campaign will grow the University’s endowment to help break the cost barrier and allow access to a Scranton education regardless of financial means. First-year students received more than $40 million in financial aid scholarships, $37 million of which was provided by the University.\n\nCayla Kumar, a first-generation student majoring in biochemistry, cell and molecular biology with a minor in philosophy from Queens Village, New York, now in her senior year at Scranton said in her remarks at the gala: “One key pillar of this campaign is scholarship, and I can personally attest to its transformative power. The scholarships provided by this University have not only eased the financial burden on my mother, but have also opened the doors to countless opportunities for me. Scholarships are not just funding education; they are investments in the future leaders and change-makers who will carry our mission forward. They bridge the gap between potential and realization, between dreams and achievements.”\n\nThe campaign will also support efforts to overcome other barriers to a Scranton education, such as the University’s campus-wide plan for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. It will support programming to help enroll, retain and graduate first-generation college students, such as Scranton’s THR1VE program, which provides peer mentors, faculty and staff mentors, advocates and leadership and other resources to first-generation college students.\n\nThe campaign will also support Scranton’s goals of excellence in academic and professional outcomes of its graduates, as well as Scranton’s commitment to provide a transformational education to students who graduate as “men and women for and with others.” Each year, more than 2,850 students perform more than 170,000 hours of service. Students also participate in Campus Ministries’ International Service Program, which provides immersion experiences in developing countries across Central and South America.\n\nTwo of Scranton’s most generous longtime benefactors, John D. Dionne ’86, H’10, former chair of the University’s Board of Trustees, and Jacquelyn Dionne ’89, co-vice chair of University’s Board of Trustees, will serve as co-chairs of A Fire That Kindles Other Fires.\n\n“The University of Scranton has been stoking the fires of knowledge within its students for 135 years, and we hope that it will continue to kindle those fires for 135 more,” said Jacquelyn Dionne. “Each and every day, Scranton is lighting the way to a better tomorrow.”\n\nIn addition to the Dionnes, members of the campaign executive committee include Tracy Bannon ’84, former trustee; John Boken, managing director of AlixPartners and current trustee; Mary Haveron ’85, finance and accounting director of Tire Alliance Groupe, L.L.C., and former trustee; John R. Mariotti, D.M.D. ’75, QMA Orthodontics member and current trustee; Vincent Reilly ’80, managing partner of Reilly, McDevitt and Henrich, P.C., and chair of the University’s Board of Trustees; James Slattery ’86, COO of North America MELROSE P.L.C. and former chair of the University’s Board of Trustees; Joseph Sorbera Jr., JLS Cost Management Systems, Inc., and current trustee; Davida Sweeney, former co-chair of the University’s Parents Executive Council; John “JP” Sweeney, financial advisor/vice president investments Wells Fargo advisors member and current trustee; and Michelle Maldonado, Ph.D., provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at the University, and, ex-officio, Father Marina and Robert Davis Jr., Ed.D., ’03, G’10,’13, vice president for University advancement.\n\nAlso at the gala, University benefactors Patricia and Edward Leahy ’68, H’01, were presented with The University of Scranton’s President’s Medal.\n\nTo date, the campaign has raised more than $112 million from 17,800 donors in its non-public phase, which began in May of 2018. The campaign received more than 13 gifts of $1 million or more and the largest single-donation in the University’s history, a $10 million gift from the Leahys, which Father Marina announced at the gala.\n\nTo make a donation to the University’s A Fire That Kindles Other Fires Campaign, visit scranton.edu/campaign.\n\nWhile the campus of The University of Scranton has been known to inspire a sort of “love at first sight” in many of its grads who grew up outside of the Scranton area, Phyllis Reinhardt ’78 humorously recalled a decidedly different sort of first encounter with northeastern Pennsylvania while driving past the culm dumps, or mountainous piles of coal mining waste, alongside Interstate 81 in 1960 to meet the family of Carl Richard Shewack, her husband-to-be at the time.\n\n“He’s bringing me to meet his parents, and it was a beautiful, beautiful day in the spring,” she said. “The windows are down, mind you, and I get a whiff of the culm dumps, and I think, ‘Oh my God, what am I getting into? What am I doing?’\n\n“That was my introduction to Scranton.”\n\nDespite that less-than-stellar introduction, Reinhardt, a native of Wisconsin and a veteran of both the Air Force and the U.S. Army Reserve, came to appreciate life in the Electric City.\n\n“There is an atmosphere in Scranton that makes you want to get to know people,” she said. “I’ve lived in several places over my military career, and I came back here.\n\n“Scranton is a good place to live.”\n\nAfter spending her childhood on a farm in Wisconsin, Reinhardt joined the Air Force and was stationed in Syracuse, New York, where she met Shewack, who was also serving in the Air Force. The couple married in May of 1960, and, after Carl finished his term of service and Phyllis was discharged on the basis of marriage, they settled in Scranton. Along the way, they were blessed with three children: Lisa, Linda and Carl Richard Jr.\n\n“Scranton was a wonderful place to raise the kids,” she said.\n\nAfter a decade of marriage, Reinhardt and Shewack divorced, and Phyllis decided to pursue her dream of going to college. After briefly working toward a career as a medical secretary and realizing that she was never going to master stenography, she took an aptitude test that indicated she would excel at social work and decided to pursue a degree in sociology at The University of Scranton.\n\nLearning How To Learn\n\nReinhardt joined the U.S. Army Reserve to help finance the cost of her education. When she enrolled at the University in 1974, coeducation, which began in 1972, was still a fairly new phenomenon, and some of the faculty members she encountered were still adjusting to the new status quo.\n\n“Many of the professors still called us ‘guys,’” she said. “They had not yet made that transition to ‘ladies and gentlemen,’ but I never felt that anyone resented our being here.”\n\nOn the whole, Reinhardt said she felt quite welcome on campus.\n\n“The University is a welcoming community,” she said. “It’s warm. People are very outgoing.”\n\nAt the University, she said she encountered a priest who helped contextualize both her purpose as an undergraduate student and her innate desire to serve others.\n\n“He said, ‘If you’re here to learn how to do a job, you’re in the wrong place … you’re here to learn how to learn,’” she said. “That always struck me as, ‘Yes, you have to learn, you have to put that energy and that knowledge to good use, and how better than to help your fellow human beings?’”\n\nDuring her student days, Reinhardt served on the University Senate and the Dexter Hanley Council, where she was elected vice president during her senior year; she also became the first woman to join the University’s Veterans Club. While she can barely remember how she managed to successfully juggle her extracurriculars, her studies, her job and her family, she said the University’s emphasis on nurturing her spiritual core aided her efforts.\n\n“My life was busy, but to find the peace and contentment of knowing that you are part of something bigger than yourself … that lesson has really stuck with me,” she said. “There were times throughout my life where things didn’t go so well, but that sense of spiritual being, that this is the core of every human being – if you aren’t in touch with that, life can be pretty rugged.”\n\nA Woman For And With Others\n\nAfter graduating from the University, Reinhardt moved to Nebraska to work for the Department of Veterans Affairs. When her mother fell ill, she moved back to Wisconsin to care for her. After her mother passed, Reinhardt took on a “dual status” position in the U.S. Army Reserve that allowed her to function in both a military and civilian capacity, and she worked toward a master’s degree in public administration at Iowa State University. At the beginning of the Gulf War, she was promoted to director of Family Programs, a new position in which she helped prepare reserve soldiers and their family members for the challenges of deployment by briefing them on their benefits and informing them of the various resources they could utilize for support, and she continued to serve in that capacity until her retirement a decade later.\n\n“(The reserves) decided that they needed a family readiness program to support military families, and I was fortunate enough to be one of the first 10 people to hold that position,” she said. “I met the most wonderful people.”\n\nAfter a long career spent teaching, training and assisting others, Reinhardt retired and returned to Scranton, where she almost immediately began volunteering to teach, train and assist others. She became a docent for Scranton’s Everhart Museum, where she has led school groups on tours of the property for the past 20 years. She joined the National Active & Retired Federal Employees Association Scranton Chapter 129 and currently serves as its president. Drawing upon her days on the farm in Wisconsin, she became a master gardener for the Penn State Cooperative Extension, where she lends her vast experience to her fellow gardeners in the interest of helping them solve their problems. She also became active in Fair Districts PA, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fixing legislative rules in order to end gerrymandering in Pennsylvania. At the University, she joined the Friends of the Library Advisory Board and attended many of the cultural enrichment programs and luncheons offered by the Schemel Forum. Ultimately, Reinhardt said she believes that we are here to serve each other, and she enjoys spending her time helping the people of her community.\n\n“It makes me feel, I guess, needed,” she said. “I had 15,000 soldiers and their families looking to me for guidance when they deployed, and, suddenly, nobody needed me. The phone stopped ringing, the emails were no more, so I guess I filled that gap by (volunteering).”\n\nShe also hasn’t stopped pursuing new interests: despite “never graduating from drawing stick people,” she began taking oil painting classes at the Dunmore Senior Center a few years ago and has enjoyed them immensely.\n\nA Scranton Legacy\n\nAs an early pioneer of coeducation at the University, Reinhardt helped blaze a trail for thousands of women to follow in the decades to come, including her daughter, Lisa Thurston ’85, G’09, academic dean at Scranton Preparatory School, and her granddaughter, Catherine Thurston, VMD ’15, a large animal surgery resident at the University of Pennsylvania’s New Bolton Center.\n\n“To see them succeed, and so well – it makes me very proud, obviously,” she said. “They are in fields where they are helping people, so maybe it’s a family tradition to share your knowledge, to help people solve their problems?\n\n“It’s very heartwarming.”\n\nWhile the University has certainly seen its share of changes since Reinhardt’s student days, she said the warmth and welcoming spirit she first encountered nearly half a century ago remains intact, and she plans to continue to serve the greater University community in the years to come.\n\n“It has always been one of my better achievements to have graduated and to be able to use that and give back,” she said. “Serving on the (Friends of the Library Advisory Board), I can give back to the students who are following me and make it a better environment for them.\"\n\nJoe Fitzgerald, M.D. ’64 has figured out the key to a happy, successful retirement: serve the children of his community and play a lot of golf.\n\nThe retired orthopedic surgeon, who resides in Kingston, Rhode Island, with his wife, Kathleen, spends every Tuesday and Thursday at Clothes to Kids Rhode Island, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides new and quality used clothing to low-income or in-crisis school-age children in Providence County free of charge so that they may attend school with the confidence and self-esteem needed to achieve academic success.\n\n“It’s supposed to add self-esteem, and I think it works,” Fitzgerald said. “I think it makes the world a better place.”\n\nFitzgerald’s interest in making the world a better place can be traced back to the example he saw his mother, a nurse, and his father, a school teacher, set for him when he was growing up in Throop, Pennsylvania. His love affair with golf also began early in his life after an uncle arranged for him to play for free at a local course.\n\n“I played golf about 45 holes a day when I was 13,” he said, “so I got pretty good as a result of that.”\n\nAs a student at Throop High School, Fitzgerald already knew he wanted to attend the University.\n\n“Where else would I go?” he said with a laugh. “Everybody went to Scranton. I was five miles away from Scranton.\n\n“It was affordable and it was a rite of passage.”\n\nAfter spending a few weeks considering what he wanted to do with the rest of his life, Fitzgerald realized he enjoyed his science courses and thought a life spent helping others through medicine would be a life well-spent.\n\n“I was very happy I did that,” he said. “I never regretted that.”\n\nFitzgerald commuted to campus each day with a few friends who also commuted. At Scranton, he double-majored in biology and philosophy in an early version of what would become the Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program, and he played on the Golf Team, where he achieved a three-stroke handicap. During his senior year, he was accepted at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., where he initially lived above the office of a doctor who happened to be a Scranton native.\n\nDuring the rest of his time at medical school, Fitzgerald lived at the District of Columbia General Hospital, where he worked a few hours a week in exchange for room and board. In addition to that arrangement, he also worked as a lab technician to cover the rest of his expenses. He graduated from medical school in 1968 and met his future wife, Kathleen, who was then a student nurse, during his time as a medical intern.\n\n“We got married about a year-and-a-half later,” he said, adding that they eventually brought two children, Matthew and Jennifer, into the world.\n\nAfter finishing his internship, Fitzgerald spent two years in the U.S. Army as a general medical officer. After he was discharged, he landed a prestigious residency in orthopedics at Rhode Island Hospital. After finishing his residency, he founded South County Orthopedics and became the Chief Team Physician at the University of Rhode Island. While running South County Orthopedics, he found a way to “pay it forward” that proved to be as spiritually rewarding as it was financially advantageous.\n\n“Because of my living at D.C. General and the fact that I was able to go through school without much debt, I tended to do a lot of charitable work in my own practice,” he said. “If people could’t pay me, I’d say, ‘That’s OK. Just keep coming back and send your friends,’ and I filled up a practice that way.\n\n“I just wanted to be a doctor, take care of people and do charitable work.”\n\nFitzgerald continued to operate as a Team Physician at Rhode Island University and as the head of South County Orthopedics for 40 years; when the company merged with a few other groups into Ortho Rhode Island in 2016, he retired and began playing golf three days a week. About three years ago, he discovered Clothes To Kids Rhode Island and dedicated himself to supporting its mission.\n\n“Clothe a child, change a life,” he said, echoing one of Clothes To Kids Rhode Island’s slogans. “It’s very gratifying.\n\n“I shop with people, that’s all, and talk to people about their lives.”\n\nSince opening in 2016, Clothes To Kids Rhode Island, which is primarily funded by donations from local citizens or corporations, has provided 9,000 wardrobes to children in Providence County, a thrift store value of more than $375,000. Fitzgerald plans to continue to serve his community at Clothes To Kids Rhode Island, and he needn’t look any further than the smiles on the faces of the people he serves to know that his efforts are helping to make the world a better place.\n\n\"I have a chance to talk to people and smile at them,\" he said. \"In our place, everybody smiles.\"\n\nBy: Julia Gavigan ’23, student correspondent\n\nWhen Phil Grieco ’00, the senior director of Brand Strategy and Consumer Insights at Monster Energy, was an undergraduate at The University of Scranton, he already knew he had a passion for communicating with others.\n\n“Nothing else spoke to me besides communications,” he said. “I loved talking to people and public speaking. I was so drawn to it.”\n\nWhile working toward a bachelor’s degree in communications and media studies, Grieco was impressed by the University’s emphasis on the Jesuit value of cura personalis, or care for the whole person. That level of attention to his wellbeing helped prepare him for his remarkable career.\n\n“It felt like people had eyes on you,” Grieco said. “The professors had eyes on you; you weren’t just a number.\n\n“I felt like there was a personal touch.”\n\nHe also learned the value of trying new things and meeting new people.\n\n“That shaped who I am today,” he said.\n\nGrieco started his career in public relations at MFA Marketing and Public Relations, a small agency now known as Finn Partners in New York City. At MFA, he worked with clients like Burton Snowboards and Timex Watches. He then switched companies in 2003 and began to work for Octagon, a sports marketing agency, as a senior account executive in Public Relations and Marketing. At Octagon, he was exposed to the inner workings of the sports marketing industry. In 2007, he became senior brand manager of Mars, the world’s leading manufacturer of chocolate, where he learned “everything from brand positioning to how to market.”\n\n“Who is the target consumer?” Grieco said. “What is our brand? What is our message? And how are we going to go out, make it relevant, stay top of mind and build loyalty?”\n\nAt Mars, Grieco directed multimillion-dollar NASCAR and NFL partnerships across multiple brands, including M&Ms, Snickers, Pedigree, Doublemint, JuicyFruit, Skittles and Starburst. He continued to utilize the line of questioning he developed at Mars when he began working for the National Basketball Association, where he drove sponsorship deals for NBA, WNBA and G League teams to maximize revenue growth. During his time with the NBA, he also worked directly with the Sacramento Kings, Minnesota Timberwolves, Charlotte Hornets, Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors and New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nIn 2016, Grieco moved across the country to the West Coast to work as the director of Global Marketing for GoPro, where he shaped the global marketing strategy of all GoPro brand partnerships, including Under Armour, BMW, Mattel, Toyota and Red Bull.\n\nIn his current position at Monster Energy, Grieco is responsible for overseeing strategic marketing and innovation initiatives.\n\n“I get to work more closely with our leadership because I sit at the hub of our data,” he said. “They constantly want to know how we are doing, how are we performing, what’s up, what’s down, why is this retailer down, and why is this brand down.”\n\n“Sometimes you can find it in the data; sometimes you need to find that information through a conversation with a stakeholder, or custom research, and that’s why data is so important.”\n\nThroughout the creative process, Grieco says it’s imperative to listen to the wants and needs of the consumer in order to create a successful brand. One of the many projects that Grieco has been involved in at Monster Energy that exemplifies his ability to respond to the demands of his consumers was the launch of True North Energy seltzer, an organic, plant-based seltzer. The research into the target audience and goals of the launch began two years ago with the emerging popularity of regular and spiked seltzers. Starting with a research brief, Grieco and his teams discovered there was a growing interest in healthy seltzers, which eventually resulted in the creation of True North.\n\nGrieco was also involved in the creation of Reign, a performance energy drink and one of Grieco’s most successful beverages at Monster Energy. The 300 mg caffeine-infused beverage was launched three years ago to compete against Bang Energy drink, and, within 18 months, it became a $300 million brand. Today, it generates $450 million in retail sales annually.\n\nAs demonstrated by the products he’s launched at Monster Energy, the key to Grieco’s success is simply listening to and understanding the people around him. By caring for the needs of his consumers and embracing a form of corporatized cura personalis, Grieco proves that paying attention to each individual can benefit both one’s personal and professional lives.\n\nWhen John O’Malley ’87 embarked upon The Tour Divide in support of The Ryan T. O’Malley ’99 Memorial Scholarship June 10, he figured it would take him about a month or so to traverse the race’s grueling 2,665.7-mile route from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S.-Mexico border in New Mexico; that was before, of course, a life-threatening accident about 125 miles from the race’s finish line landed the retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel in an intensive care/trauma unit July 15.\n\nJust 84 days later, on what would have been his brother Ryan’s 45th birthday, O’Malley returned to the scene of the accident determined to finish the race’s final 125 miles.\n\nWhat happened in-between, of course, might be called a miracle.\n\n“John truly is an iron man,” said Helene O’Malley, John’s mother. “The blessed Mother and Ryan were looking down on him.”\n\n“John is a world-class athlete who completed a world-class endurance cycling event with a world-class effort and … some other-worldly help,” said John “Jack” O’Malley, Ph.D. ’64, professor of psychology emeritus at the University and John’s father. “God is good.”\n\nA Lifelong Love\n\nJohn’s love of cycling and adventure began when he was growing up in the Green Ridge section of Scranton.\n\n“Bikes were a big deal back then, and if you had one, you were a lucky kid,” he said. “ For me, the bike became an instrument of exploration, discovery and freedom.”\n\nAs the oldest child of Dr. O’Malley and Helene, John shared his love of cycling with his five siblings, especially Ryan, his youngest brother.\n\n“As a kid, time and distance had little meaning,” he said of the hours they spent exploring the NEPA area together. “We’d just ride, inspired by the adventure and the natural beauty of the region.”\n\nUpon graduating from the University, John began his military career in Ft. Carson, Colorado, where he started racing mountain bikes. Since then, he has continued to ride and race, competing in triathlons and adventure races throughout the country.\n\nROAR\n\nAfter Ryan's passing in 2011, his family established The Ryan T. O’Malley ’99 Memorial Scholarship in his memory to enable Computer Science students of limited resources with an interest in fitness to attend The University of Scranton. Since that time, Ryan's family and friends have raised more than $150,000 for the scholarship, much of it through ROAR: The Ryan O'Malley Annual Race, a 5K fundraising event the family organized from 2013-2017.\n\nWhen John and his family settled in Monument, Colorado, he became so inspired by the expanses and terrain he saw while on two wheels that he proposed the idea of funding Ryan’s scholarship through an annual bike ride. In 2018, John embarked upon the inaugural ROAR: The Ryan O’Malley Annual Ride by cycling the 500+ miles of The Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango in Ryan’s memory. While John rode The Colorado Trail again for ROAR in 2019 and 2020, he was sidelined by injuries and knee surgery in 2021.\n\nThe Tour Divide\n\nOn June 10, John embarked upon ROAR: The Ryan O’Malley Annual Ride for the fourth time by participating in The Tour Divide in support of The Ryan T. O’Malley ’99 Memorial Scholarship.The Tour Divide follows the “Great Divide Mountain Bike Route,” a 90 percent off-road trail that follows the Continental Divide through Alberta, British Columbia, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. Established by the Adventure Cycling Association in 1998, it is considered the most important off-pavement cycling route in the world. Prior to beginning The Tour Divide, John said he was looking forward to riding for “family, community and the well-being of others.”\n\n“I ride to remember and honor our brother, Ryan,” he said. “I ride to give back in some way to the community who nurtured us. Through the ROAR and Ryan’s scholarship, we help to provide students with limited financial resources the opportunity to attend The University of Scranton.”\n\nThe Tour Divide’s race clock runs 24 hours a day, and the self-supported riders aren’t allowed any outside help other than the ability to access public facilities along the way. Participating cyclists must carry their camping equipment, food and water through long stretches of remote mountain wilderness, pristine river valleys, open grassland and desert while risking injury, mechanical failure, treacherous weather and encounters with potentially dangerous wildlife.\n\nThey also, apparently, need to watch out for dangerous human life.\n\nThe Accident\n\nAfter riding for more than a month in the Tour Divide, John was involved in an accident in the early morning hours of July 15 near Silver City, New Mexico, about a two-day ride from the race’s finish line.\n\n“I was struck by an apparent hit-and-run driver on Hwy 180,” he said. “Although there were no witnesses to the incident, and I remember nothing of the accident, being intubated on-site, nor the Medivac flight, the nature and extent of injuries to both sides of my body, and damage to my bicycle, helmet and other gear verify that this is what happened.\n\n“Hospital staff came to the same conclusion as well, based on my overall condition.”\n\nJohn was found by two motorists sometime after the accident who alerted the police, and he was airlifted to an intensive care/trauma unit in El Paso, Texas.\n\n“I sustained a traumatic brain injury with a skull fracture and a few subdural hematomas/ subarachnoid hemorrhages,” he said. “A complement of body bruises and cuts, a broken nose, broken molars and some torn cartilage/ligaments (knee and shoulder) complete the ‘needs repair’ list.”\n\nAfter a 12-day stint in El Paso, where John was joined by his wife, Kathi, his mother-in-law, Karen, and his sister, Julianne Phillipp, M.D. ’91, a Virginia-based pediatrician, he was transferred to a rehab center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he received occupational and cognitive therapy for an additional four days. Since then, he has continued outpatient care with a team of doctors and therapists in Ft. Carson, Colorado, and his recovery has been nothing short of miraculous.\n\n“A CT scan about three weeks ago showed everything was healed up,” John said. “I owe much of my recovery thus far to believing wholeheartedly that I will heal and become stronger … most of this belief comes from the love and support of my family.\n\n“I can also say that being an athlete and a soldier has contributed directly to where I am right now. Coordination, reaction, balance, strength and agility have been developed through training/drills my entire life and helped me immensely during initial evaluation and therapy.”\n\nCrossing The Finish Line\n\nJohn and Kathi returned to the scene of the accident to finish what he began in June Oct. 7. Although he was quickly greeted by heavy rainfall that transformed the terrain from a navigable dirt path to a thick “peanut butter mud,” he traveled about 80 miles in approximately 10 hours of cycling, leaving him with just 45 miles to go to his goal.\n\nOn Oct. 8, John finally crossed the finish line of The Tour Divide 120 days after embarking upon it.\n\n“The Tour Divide is truly a once-in-a-lifetime adventure that stays with you and changes you for the good,” he said. “There is no easy way out there and I wouldn’t want it any other way.”\n\nAll things considered, John remains grateful for the experience, especially for the more than $12,000 his efforts raised for Scranton students.\n\n“The greatest / proudest part of the ride was what we raised for Ryan’s scholarship fund,” he said. “To all who pledged – thank you.\n\n“Your kindness fueled me daily out there and will help young men and women receive a great college education.”\n\nThe University of Scranton’s President’s Business Council (PBC) presented Patti Byrnes Clarke ’86, P’17,’19, global chief talent officer, Havas Group, and Tom O’Brien ’86, P’19, senior managing director, SumRidge Partners, a Raymond James company, with President’s Medals at its 21st Annual Award Dinner on Sept. 29 at Gotham Hall in New York City. Proceeds from the gala, which raised more than $1.1 million, support the University’s Presidential Scholarship Endowment Fund.\n\n“Our University has been blessed to be able to honor so many extraordinary individuals over the years and this year is no different. We are privileged to count among them our alumni Patricia Byrnes Clarke and Tom P. O’Brien, both of the class of 1986,” said Rev. Joseph G. Marina, S.J., president of The University of Scranton in his remarks.\n\nThe President’s Medal recognizes individuals who have achieved excellence in their fields and demonstrated extraordinary compassion for others, representing lifetime achievements that reflect the University’s mission of Catholic and Jesuit excellence and service.\n\n“Patti and Tom are highly successful professionals who have had a tremendous impact on generations of alumni,” said Frank Pearn ’83, P’16, global chief compliance officer, JPMorgan Chase and Co., and chair of the President’s Business Council, in his remarks at the dinner. “They truly embody everything that the PBC aims to represent and, given the way that they share their talents, gifts and insights, they are wonderful examples of St. Ignatius’s quote that ‘Love is shown more in deeds than in words.’”\n\nThrough its celebrations, the PBC has generated more than $20 million for the University’s Presidential Scholarship Endowment Fund. Presidential Scholarships are four-year, full-tuition scholarships awarded to incoming first-year students at Scranton with both outstanding records in high school and notable community involvement.\n\nPresidential Scholar Dominic Finan ’23, Malvern, a neuroscience and philosophy double major in the Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Honors Program, spoke at the award dinner on behalf of the Presidential Scholars.\n\nDominic Finan '23 addresses the crowd at the PBC 21st Annual Award Dinner flanked by his fellow Presidential Scholars.\n\n“Collectively, the 18 of us (from the class of 2023) have 28 majors, 18 minors, and 5 concentrations. … These academic pursuits, research opportunities and moments of profound growth would not be possible without the contributions of everyone in this room. So, for that I say thank you. Thank you for empowering our unique gifts, talents, and interests; and thank you, most importantly, for helping us call The University of Scranton our home. You have changed our lives, and our family’s lives, for the better,” said Finan. “The generosity of the President’s Business Council cleared a path for us to become future lawyers, doctors, actuaries, educators, researchers, and business executives alike. We promise to use the spark you ignited in us to ‘go forth and set the world on fire.’”\n\nIn accepting their awards, Byrnes Clarke and O’Brien talked about why they became involved with the PBC and in giving back to the University.\n\n“I got involved with the PBC because I wanted to try to give back to students and help with mentoring and job placement,” said O’Brien. “Early in my career, a fellow Scranton alumnus, whom I did not know, helped me. … I need to do this because someone a long time ago helped me.” In recollecting his persistence in getting Scranton students considered for internships at Morgan Stanley and then at SumRidge Partners, O’Brien added, “If you haven’t tried it yet, I encourage you to do so. You are getting someone who is productive, hard-working, resilient and not entitled that will make a huge impact on your business.”\n\n“The exposure to Scranton and its students and its alumni challenged me to take on my own journey to do more and to do better as a person, a family member, a leader and a friend,” said Byrnes Clarke. “It’s true that as Scranton students we are exposed to the Ignatian values, but aren’t always mature enough to overtly put them into practice in our lives. But, with a Scranton education, that Ignatian foundation is always there. And when you choose to be engaged, and get involved and give back to Scranton, you get this very special opportunity to explore those Ignatian roots.”\n\nA recording of the 2022 PBC Dinner is available at https://youtu.be/efhjS3UcENQ, and photos from the event can be found on the Alumni Society's Shutterfly page.

O’Malley ’99 Memorial Scholarship at the University, O’Malley was involved in an accident near Silver City, New Mexico, about 125 miles from the race’s finish line in the early morning hours of July 15. According to the O’Malley family, John was found by two motorists who spotted him on the side of the road and alerted the police.\n\nAccording to a GoFundMe page set up by Katie O’Malley, John’s daughter, to help with their family’s medical expenses, “John was airlifted from the scene in New Mexico and taken to an intensive care unit/trauma center in El Paso, Texas.\n\n“We have since learned that he has endured a traumatic brain injury.”\n\nAlthough John can’t recall the events surrounding the accident, he publicly thanked the Silver City police officers who assisted him in a Facebook post dated July 26.\n\n“I am most grateful for their decisiveness and professionalism as a CT scan revealed a subdural hematoma,” he wrote. “I still have no idea how nor when I sustained these injuries.\n\n“At this point, I’m heartbroken that I didn’t finish the race, but happy to be under great care (with) a great prognosis to return soon and get ‘er done! The silver lining to all of this is that we raised over 12k for the Ryan T. O’Malley Memorial Scholarship fund at The University of Scranton allowing students in need the opportunity to get a college education.”\n\nAccording to John “Jack” O’Malley, Ph.D. ’64, professor of psychology emeritus at the University and John’s father, John was transferred from the University Medical Center of El Paso to Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Colorado Springs July 27, and he was released to his home in Monument, Colorado July 30, where he will continue outpatient physical therapy.\n\n“His recovery has been remarkable!” Dr. O’Malley said. “Everyone has been so kind, and we deeply appreciate the caring and prayers.”\n\nAccording to several recent Facebook posts and comments made by John and his circle of friends, he remains an inspiration to many, and he plans to dedicate himself fully to healing and recovering until he’s ready to race again.\n\n“I’m headed back to Silver City to finish this baby!” he wrote in a Facebook comment July 30.\n\nTo follow John’s progress and learn more about the Ryan T. O’Malley Memorial Scholarship, visit this link.\n\nROAR\n\nOn June 10, John embarked upon ROAR: The Ryan O’Malley Annual Ride for the fourth time by participating in The Tour Divide, an annual ultra-distance cycling race that sees participants traverse the length of the Rocky Mountains from Alberta, Canada, to the US/Mexico border in Antelope Wells, New Mexico, in support of the Ryan T. O’Malley ’99 Memorial Scholarship.\n\nAfter Ryan's passing in 2011, his family established the scholarship in his memory to enable Computer Science students of limited resources with an interest in fitness to attend The University of Scranton. Since that time, Ryan's family and friends have raised more than $150,000 for the scholarship, much of it through ROAR: The Ryan O'Malley Annual Race, a 5K fundraising event the family organized from 2013-2017. In 2018, John embarked upon the inaugural ROAR: The Ryan O’Malley Annual Ride by cycling the 500+ miles of The Colorado Trail from Denver to Durango in Ryan’s memory. While John rode The Colorado Trail again for ROAR in 2019 and 2020, he was sidelined by injuries and knee surgery in 2021. Prior to beginning The Tour Divide, John said he was looking forward to riding for “family, community and the well-being of others.”\n\n“I ride to remember and honor our brother, Ryan,” he said. “I ride to give back in some way to the community who nurtured us.
