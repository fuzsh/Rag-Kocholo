        "text": "Britain’s recent months have been politically dominated by the fallout from the referendum which will radically alter Britain’s relationship with the European Union. Its oldest trading partner, Ireland, which was a central pillar of the Empire until 1922 and the Commonwealth until 1949, remains a member of the EU. Brexit -perhaps – means there is a question mark over how the nations will co-exist as the boundaries are redrawn.\n\nIreland effectively ceased being a British territory in 1949 with the Ireland Act that, most significantly, allowed Irish people to live and work in Britain as ‘non-foreign’, with rights not afforded other immigrants, such as those from Europe. There is now a question mark over these rights and the relationships between the two nations.\n\nNorthern Ireland voted 56%-44% to remain in the European Union, with many Unionists voting ‘leave’ on matters of British sovereignty and identity. But away from these issues of identity and sovereignty, there is a practical dimension that ‘leave’ throws-up concerning the business community: what about the return to a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland the Irish republic?\n\nSince freedom of movement and residence for citizens of EU member states was introduced by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, and the development of the Peace Process, the Irish border (once a highly securitized frontier) has gradually become open. Armed military checkpoints and customs checks have disappeared facilitating greater trade and co-operation between the two states.\n\nAny future re-established restrictions on freedom of movement and a hard border may have profound effects on north-south trade. Customs checks – a detested element of journeys north and south prior to the Peace Process – would necessarily be a requirement again depending on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe once fragile border economy, which has been rebuilt on retail and shopping, has seen vast numbers of people travelling from the north into the Republic for cheaper fuel. Greater numbers travel northwards from the south for cheaper household goods and groceries; both governed by the fluctuating exchange rate between the pound and euro currencies.\n\nTowns like Newry and Enniskillen, which suffered greatly during the Troubles, have become reinvented thanks to freedom of movement. Belfast and Dublin, thanks to new and improved motorways are now little more than 90 minutes apart, having a huge impact on improving trade.\n\nBrexit is likely to effect Northern Ireland, its developing Peace Process and trade in both the states on the island more than anywhere else in Britain and Liverpool will be one of the cities in the frontline, experiencing what happens to the relationship between the two nations.\n\nFew other cities in Britain can claim to have such an Irish influence. Trading relations date back for perhaps a thousand years and direct Irish immigration, beginning from the early nineteenth century, is one of the central drivers behind the growth of the city.\n\nCommon bonds of language and shared culture won’t change regardless of what form Brexit takes. Liverpool is the city where Irish immigrants like Kitty Wilkinson and Agnes Jones helped revolutionise public health; where James Sexton and Jim Larkin transformed working class politics by organising workers and where authors like Robert Noonan and Pat O’Mara documented the working class life of immigrants.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century Irish women transformed the NHS just as generations of Irishmen worked the docks and construction sites. In the late twentieth century Liverpool became a place where Irish people came to university and stayed after graduation. As a result, cultural examples of Irish life, like the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and the Liverpool Irish Festival, are thriving with volunteers anxious to maintain bonds with home and celebrate our shared cultural history and experiences.\n\nIn the last 20 years the achievements of Liverpool’s top flight football teams and the all pervasive influence of the English Premier League has led Irish people to make regular ‘pilgrimages’ to the city and become major contributors to the city’s burgeoning tourism economy.\n\nIreland’s/Liverpool’s bonds with Britain go far beyond the possible effects of Brexit. They are long standing and profound. While Irish people will continue to live and work in Liverpool, we are more than simply employees plying our trades. Our spirit, our culture and our experiences are stitched into the fabric of Merseyside life. The Liverpool Irish Festival is a continuing recognition of this.\n\nDr Paddy Hoey\n\nEnthusiastic podcaster and blogger, Dr Paddy Hoey lectures in Media and Politics at Edge Hill University. Former Liverpool Echo and Daily Post contributor, City Talk FM presenter and Hope University lecturer, he enjoys consulting for Laughterhouse Comedy and sits as a Director on the Board of the Liverpool Irish Festival.\n\nA provocation from the Artist Centre for Human Rights, details of its manifesto and why it began in Liverpool\n\nThe Artist Centre for Human Rights was set up in Liverpool in the commemorative year of 2016 as an internationalist arts project that is both a cultural organisation and an evolving artwork. The Centre disseminates local cultural articulations of Human Rights through an international programme of artistic production.\n\nWe launched the Artist Centre for Human Rights in Liverpool as the city in which William Roscoe first advocated anti-slavery laws and campaigns. Roger Casement and Edmund Morel took up this cause again in Liverpool, by establishing the first internationalist human rights campaign in the twentieth century. We also acknowledge the energy and persistence of their multi-media approach to recruiting support and in educating people in the atrocities of the Congo Regime, particularly around the commodification of rubber in Europe. We work with artists and educational practitioners; environmental, cultural and community organisations to create and commission new artworks promoting Human Rights. The Artist Centre for Human Rights acknowledges the rights of humans to be based on a broader parity of esteem with the environment across the globe.\n\nThere are many instances of powerful relations between Liverpool and Ireland. To think of Irish connections in Liverpool is to think of Casement’s defiance in secretly funding his and Morel’s campaign to undermine colonial exploitation of indigenous peoples in the Congo. It is to think of people in Liverpool working in solidarity backstage in the days, months, years before the Easter Rising in Dublin. It is to think of the Abbey Theatre players in Liverpool the week before the Rising, performing Yeats’ and Gregory’s transformative play Cathleen Ni Houlihan; the following week some of those same artists conducted key roles in the operations of the Rising. It is to think of Irish refugees landing in their thousands at Clarence Dock in the 1840s to take residence in what Dr Duncan (Liverpool’s first Medical Officer of Health) called ‘the cemetery of Ireland.’ It is to think of Maud Gonne holding a public rally in Saltney Street in 1900. It is to think of The Gaelic League offices on Duke Street or the body of Donovan O’Rossa being carried for two miles ‘on Irish shoulders’ from the Prince’s Landing Stage to Nelson Dock on route from America to burial in Dublin. It is to think of those numberless Irish whose descendants live here today and who make up a large part of a city that voted to remain in Europe. As the Citizen says in Joyce’s Ulysses “and our eyes are on Europe.”\n\nThe ACHR pays homage to these legacies with the intention to refract the backward glance fully to a forward-thinking engagement with our present. As prisoner C.3.3, Oscar Wilde – writing De Profundis in Reading Gaol – recalled Wordsworth’s lines: “Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark / And has the nature of infinity.” In taking up the chance for a cultural revival in Ireland, artists like Yeats, Synge and Milligan took language as acts of resistance and defiance and as the setting for new projected energies in an assertion of Irishness, in a mode of cultural and social becoming. This Irishness stages a resonant model for all cultures, all places, all forms of independent belonging.\n\nThe Cassandra Echo is the journal of the ACHR; we commission new pieces that will disseminate human rights through artistic endeavor. The journal is an homage to the spirit of other internationalist discussions that have sought to give word to causes that act in the face of resistance: for instance, the Belfast journal The Shan Van Vocht set up at the end of the nineteenth century by Alice Milligan and Anna Johnston; or the Free International University forums set up by artist Joseph Beuys in the 1970s.\n\nWe call for discussion, conversation, engagement with international artists and organisations that refract core practices in society such as architecture, environmentalism, social infrastructure, art itself, literature, community activism and feminism. We work towards new commonalities in language, new localisms in international dialogue, progressive values and equalities.\n\nSean Borodale & Catherine Morris, co-founders\n\n[email protected]\n\nartistcentreforhumanrights.com\n\nCatherine Morris (Liverpool Central Library’s first Writer-in-Residence) is writing Intimate Power: Autobiography of a City, montaging life-writing, photo-essays and community interviews, currently being made on location at resonant sites across Liverpool. Catherine is also Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool.\n\nSean Borodale works as a poet and artist, making scriptive and documentary poems written on location; emerging from a process of writing and walking. Currently undertaking a residency with Bluecoat, Sean’s also undertaking an oral recording of Ulysses in Liverpool.\n\nThis is a co-authored essay from Catherine Morris and Sean Borodale, cofounders of the Artist Centre for Human Rights (ACHR) and co-editors of The Cassandra Echo the ACHR’s journal\n\nIn August this year a guest editor of the @Ireland Twitter account received a barrage of racist and sexist abuse. Michelle Marie, a black woman describing herself as a mum and model, came under attack from Twitter trolls who launched the usual sexist, racist and fattist abuse (how sad that we’ve come to expect such an onslaught simply for being black or a woman or anything but size zero), but with the added accusation of ‘not being Irish enough’ to represent the community Twitter account.\n\nOriginally from Oxford, Michelle was told by one Twitter user to ‘return to her ancestral lands’. Let’s assume that particular tweeter wasn’t one of the 6,638 Brits to apply for an Irish passport in the wake of Brexit*. Another found it ‘insulting’ that someone ‘not genetically Irish’ could dare to represent the nation. Presumably that individual is unfamiliar with ‘The Granny Rule’ which has kept the Irish football team in operation since the 60s!\n\nThankfully not all responses were so detestable. Darragh Doyle, who manages the @ Ireland account, hosting a different guest editor each week, said that most replies to Michelle’s tweets, “particularly from Ireland or Irish people, condemned the racist, sexist, vile tweets” and voiced their support. So the question remains: if the majority of Ireland and the Irish Diaspora can welcome and celebrate the Irishness of a black woman born elsewhere, why did the rest of world have such an issue with Michelle Marie, a black, English woman who’s taken up residency in Ireland?\n\nWould they take the same offence at an act such as the Rusangano Family representing Irish culture here in Liverpool? Comprising of a Togolese MC, a Zimbabwaean rapper and Irish producer, the hip hop, electronic outfit were standout performers at last year’s Liverpool Irish Festival, bounding up and down the Kazimier Garden stage with an explosive energy that matched the sheer vigour and tenacity of their lyrics. Their performance broke all stereotypes of Ireland’s traditional ‘diddly-a’ music (as ‘me Da’ calls it) and was like no other act to have graced the Liverpool Irish Festival before.\n\nThe beauty of this festival – and of Irish culture in general – is that there’s enough room on the stage for whimsical Irish poetry and hip hop, for contemporary art and traditional dance. The threads of our national fabric have stretched so far beyond our own shores, it seems new exotic strands are beginning to reach back from far afield and become entwined with the traditional hues and patterns of Irish heritage.\n\nIreland’s greatest export has always been its people, thanks to a steady stream of emigration. The greatest cities of the world were built with Irish émigrés sweat. Our culture has been woven into the fabric of everywhere we’ve travelled over the centuries. There are more Irish people living outside of Ireland (44m) than in it (4m). We could and should never be a nation to close its borders or question the right of anyone to make a home and future for themselves in a land not theirs by birth.\n\nAnd with such a constant stream of people leaving the country and bringing our culture to the far-flung corners of the world, it’s refreshing to see that the Celtic Tiger (Ireland’s economy), membership of the EU and controversial tax breaks for global companies has done something to turn the tide. That Ireland at home reflects the same diversity as Ireland abroad is surely a sign of real progress, at a time when the rest of the world is closing borders and putting up walls?\n\nAs a schoolgirl in Dublin I studied Irish sat next to a refugee from Somalia; as a teenager in Tyrone I played Gaelic football against girls from Nigeria and now, here in Liverpool, I am constantly met by second, third and even fourth generation Irish who still raise their glass with a “Sláinte”.\n\nJust this summer past I attended the glorious Africa Day Festival in Dublin’s Phoenix Park and salivated over the delicious smells, admired the beautiful crafts, delighted in the bright bold colours of the traditional garments and shook my very white (or lobster red by that point!) shoulders to the Afro beat. That same night I went to a packed out Croke Park and listened to Bruce Springsteen sing songs rooted in the traditions of Irish folk music and recall stories about his own Irish granny.\n\nI wonder if the trolls who attacked Michelle Marie would be as quick to deny the Boss his Irish identity?\n\nEmma Walsh\n\nWriter, blogger and active feminist. Half Dublin-jackeen, half Tyrone-culchie, Emma moved to Liverpool to study English Literature and Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool and now works at The Reader.\n\n* An estimated 6m Briton’s have Irish ancestry that would – by law – permit them Irish nationality. Post-Brexit, Ireland’s foreign minister Charlie Flanagan asked for the surge in applications to cease, stating “increased interest clearly points to a sense of concern among some UK passport holders that the rights they enjoy as EU citizens are about to abruptly end. I want to state clearly that this is not the case”.\n\nThe harrowing stories of hunger strikes in 1981, pitting Irish political prisoners against the weight of Whitehall and the British Government, are well known. However, the stories, decisions and personalities that generated these actions are less clear. In this article, Stuart Borthwick helps us understand the process that drove these hunger strikers, providing 66 Days viewers with a context for Bobby Sands’ actions and those of his counterparts. This is a must read for anyone thinking of attending the film screening or those interested in the ongoing politics of Ireland.\n\nMost people know about the hunger strikes in the H-Blocks of HMP Maze, south of Belfast, in 1981. Ten men died as part of a campaign for political status for prisoners convicted of offences during ‘the Troubles’. Yet despite the release of three feature films on the subject (Brian Campbell and Laurence McKeown’s H3 released in 2001, Steve McQueen’s Hunger in 2008 and now Brendan J Byrne’s 66 Days), the origins of the dispute are rarely discussed, even if the consequences of the strike are well known.\n\nIn March 1972, after a few short years of increasingly fierce armed conflict and 328 violent deaths, the Conservative government in London announced the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the imposition of ‘direct rule’ by the Westminster government, to be overseen by a new cabinet position of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. William Whitelaw, the first incumbent in post, soon recognised that those fighting on the streets of Belfast, Derry and elsewhere were not criminals or looters, but politically motivated combatants. This was not a series of riots, or even a mere insurrection – this was approaching a civil war. Within three months of taking up post, there was a truce and Whitelaw engaged in face-to-face meetings with the leaders of the IRA. A truce, not merely an IRA ceasefire. Strange to conceive in the light of subsequent speeches by successive prime ministers, but true nonetheless. One of Margaret Thatcher’s closest confidantes did not merely ‘talk to terrorists’, but negotiated a truce with them.\n\nAn IRA precondition for meeting with Whitelaw was the creation of “Special Category Status” within the prison network. This precondition was readily granted by the British, bringing to an end an IRA hunger strike in Crumlin Road jail that was calling for political status for prisoners. All prisoners convicted of “scheduled offences” would henceforth be treated as de facto prisoners of war, wearing their own clothes, refraining from prison work, associating freely amongst themselves, and receiving food parcels and visitors from the outside. Prisoners also received 50% remission on their sentences and paramilitary structures were accepted by the British authorities, with governors and warders liaising with paramilitary organisations in the running of prisons.\n\nThe truce broke down immediately after it became clear that there was no British plan for withdrawal from Northern Ireland (a key IRA demand). However, Special Category Status remained a legacy of the truce until the subsequent Labour government seemingly decided that their Conservative predecessors were ‘soft on terrorism’. In 1976, Merlyn Rees, Labour’s new Secretary of State, announced that Special Category Status was to be phased out. A new prison was to be built to house the newly convicted, who would be treated as criminals. IRA volunteer Kieran Nugent was the first to be convicted under the new system, who when presented with a prison uniform refused to wear it, informing prison warders that they would have to nail it to his back.\n\nAnd thus began the prison protest that led to the hunger strike of 1981, as depicted in the film 66 Days, which has a special screening at FACT as part of the Liverpool Irish Festival. The hunger strike led to the deaths of Bobby Sands and nine other IRA and INLA prisoners, and was ended when the families of those still on hunger strike intervened to request that their next-of-kin be fed should they become unconscious.\n\nShortly after the hunger strike collapsed, the authorities conceded special category status in all but name, with prisoners receiving 50% remission from their sentences, wearing their own clothes, and associating with each other. They could never quite openly admit it, but “crime” was no longer “crime” and these prisoners were different. But the pretence of a criminalisation policy remained intact and the next Prime Minister, John Major, retained a hard line towards Republican prisoners, announcing to the House of Commons that it would ‘turn his stomach’ to negotiate with the IRA. The reality was different. The British state had never really stopped ‘talking to terrorists’ since Whitelaw negotiated with the IRA in 1972. It was this talking, often conducted at arm’s length and in secret by the security services and the IRA, that led to a peace process and the subsequent release of all Republican prisoners by 2000.\n\nStuart Borthwick’s book “The Writing on the Wall: A Visual History of Northern Ireland’s Troubles” was launched at the Liverpool Irish Festival in 2015 and is available for sale from News from Nowhere on Bold Street.\n\nLiverpool Irish Festival would like to thank Stuart Borthwick for preparing this article, exclusively for our site and audiences. We encourage people to attend the screening of 66 Days (105 ons, Cert. 15) and hope that this information offers a broad account of how these strikes came to pass.\n\nLiverpool Irish Festival returns this autumn with a celebration of Irish playwriting and theatre, showcasing emerging writers and playwrights, reworked versions of classic Irish works and original productions.\n\nThe tradition of Irish theatre and playwriting is a strong element of the island’s culture. Indeed, Irish theatre has made a disproportionate contribution to English drama. A generation of writers such as Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats, James Joyce and the formation of the Abbey Theatre galvanised Irish theatre and storytelling. In Liverpool, too, the power and strength of independent theatre, homegrown writers and venues – from the Everyman Playhouse, Hope Street Limited and Unity Theatre – all championing emerging talent. Liverpool Irish Festival continues this, providing a platform for new works and new talents, using the traditional format of one act plays through to visual spectacle and multimedia stages telling nostalgic tales.\n\nThe ‘Performance and Poetry’ programme at Liverpool Irish Festival includes;\n\nThree Plays: Riders to the Sea, The Shadow of the Glen and Purgatory at the Treasure House Theatre at the World Museum explores the theme of the undead and how the Irish peasantry’s relationship between the living and the dead has been full of mysticism and myth. Originally performed as a trinity of plays by the RSC, Alsop Drama take the three one act plays, by John Millington Synge and William Butler Yeats to consider rural life in Ireland in the early twentieth century, and how superstition and folklore influenced relationships with the spirits, the living and past.\n\nLiverpool Lambs, an original production written by Steve Nolan and Peter King (descendent of the King Brothers, volunteers who travelled from Liverpool to Ireland for the Easter Rising), who retell the little known story of the Liverpool men and women who played a role in the Uprising. Performed at the Unity Theatre this spring, Northern Soul described it as “accurate and evocative”, telling a story many have forgotten.\n\nA centenary celebration of James Joyce’s ‘A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man’, a panel discussion of James Joyce’s celebrated novel with His Excellency Ambassador Dan Mulhall (Irish Ambassador), Dr Katherine Mullin (Senior Lecturer, University of Leeds), Professor Frank Shovlin (Institute of Irish Studies, University of Liverpool) and Professor Andrew Gibson (Royal Holloway, University of London). This event also serves as the official launch of the festival.\n\nA new production written and directed by three emerging Liverpool Irish artists is to be staged at Invisible Wind Factory as part of Liverpool Irish Festival. Telling the story of a women’s commune in 1914, touching on revolution and suffrage, Scadàn is accompanied by live music, imagery and old Celtic stories creating an immersive and mesmeric performance. Written by Lauren O’Hara and Connor Kelly (both young writers from Derry-Londonderry and living in Liverpool) the production is directed by Roisin Fletcher, who lives in Liverpool with family hailing from Co. Donegal. Scadàn tells the story of Muireann, who leaves the island of Tory en route to America. At a women’s commune she meets four other women, one of whom is a Liverpool suffragette. Delving into the Irish politics of 1914, the suffrage movement in England and Ireland, audiences journey with Muireann – leaving Tory, exploring the feelings actions and emotions that continue to inform politics today, locally and globally. Like all good theatre, it provokes us to think: should we take action, should we educate? Do we have to get involved? What does involvement even mean?\n\nAdditional programme:\n\nStorytelling with Liz Weir\n\nWed 19 Oct, 7.30pm, St Michael’s Irish Centre\n\n£5 from St Michael’s Irish Centre or online (+booking fee)\n\nSklonište\n\nThurs 20 Oct, 8.30pm, The Box, FACT\n\n£7/£5conc\n\nConnect with the festival on www.liverpoolirishfestival.com\n\nfacebook/LivIrishFest\n\nTwitter @LivIrishFest\n\n#madfortrad\n\n#madfornew\n\n#LivIrishFest\n\nA new production written and directed by three emerging Liverpool Irish artists is to be staged at Invisible Wind Factory as part of Liverpool Irish Festival. Telling the story of a women’s commune in 1914, touching on revolution and the suffragettes, Scadàn will be accompanied by live music, imagery and old Celtic stories creating an immersive and mesmeric performance.\n\nA Crowdfunder has been launched to support the production, which will run over two nights during the festival on Tues 18 Oct and Wed 19 October. Liverpool Irish Festival runs from 13-23 October 2016.\n\nWritten by Lauren O’Hara and Connor Kelly (both young writers from Derry-Londonderry and living in Liverpool), the production is directed by Roisin Fletcher, who lives in Liverpool with family hailing from Co. Donegal. Scadàn tells the story of Muireann, who leaves the island of Tory to make her way to America. At a women’s commune she meets four other women, one of whom is a Liverpool suffragette. Delving into the Irish politics of 1914, the suffrage movement in England and Ireland, the audience journeys with Muireann – leaving Tory, exploring the feelings, actions and emotions that continue to inform politics today, both locally and globally. Like all good theatre, it provokes us to think: should we take action, should we educate? Do we have to get involved? What does involvement even mean?\n\nThe story is fictional, but was inspired after the discovery of a book by Roisin, ‘Vivid Faces: The Revolutionary Generation in Ireland, 1890-1923’. Having travelled to Tory many times and reading about the women involved in Irish revolution, Roisin learned about women’s communes and those who were based in County Donegal. Weaving in the stories of myth, legend and tradition she knew from her family in Donegal, the production began to emerge.\n\nAlongside the story, Scadàn will feature music composed by Liverpool composer and sound designer Luke Thomas (‘Dis Place’, ‘TENT!’) who has worked on immersive art installations for Liverpool Light Night and as musical director at Hope Street Limited.\n\nRoisin, who completed a six month emerging artist programme with Hope Street Limited, directing The Snow Flake Trail 2015 and a new street performance for Spare Parts Festival 2016, says; “The stories of female revolutionaries rarely make it to history books. I felt a great sense of connection when I first read about these women, the communes and their politics. Telling the story of these five women using myth, music, legend and language touches on all the elements of art and storytelling I’m passionate about. It’s a fictional tale but it says a great deal about our relationship with politics now as well as our Irish heritage”.\n\nEmma Smith, who leads Liverpool Irish Festival adds, “We are delighted to be working with emerging artists in Liverpool and to provide a stage for their voices and stories. It is also critical to me that we begin to unveil the women of our past who have long had their stories, brilliance and power shrouded from view, and impact go unrecognised. This promises to be a powerful and emotive production telling a story of a century ago that will feel very present. It’s also encouraging that its origins are in these young women and in this city”.\n\nTo support Scadàn on Crowdfunder go here\n\nConnect with the festival on www.liverpoolirishfestival.com\n\nfacebook/LivIrishFest\n\nTwitter @LivIrishFest\n\n#madfortrad\n\n#madfornew\n\n#LivIrishFest\n\nA tension rankles between the traditional vanguard and today’s ‘new wave’. Reflected in culture, multiple understandings of history and our communication choices, the struggle to understand generations before and after our own is often at the root of why we create: to tell our story. In the centenary year of the Easter Rising and the year of Brexit – two defining and connected moments shaping Ireland, Britain and Europe – the tension between new and old is of the zeitgeist.\n\nTension isn’t necessarily negative. It can be the propellant needed to push beliefs and society forward making new ground and putting pay to outdated thought. Consider last year’s majority vote supporting gay marriage in the Republic of Ireland, a powerfully progressive statement wholly unimaginable at the time of the Eater Rising. It demonstrates we can take something traditional – marriage – and inject it with a contemporary spark – equality! – to create something new, showing tension can create something warm, friendly and downright convivial. We need to celebrate these stories to keep moving forward.\n\nSo, what is ‘a story’? Literally, a story is “a narrative designed to interest, amuse, or instruct the receiver”. Stories allow us to understand personal positions; picture individual environments and reflect and share our histories, differences and similarities. They state our identities. Post-Brexit our stories could be more important than ever, which informs what 2016’s Liverpool Irish Festival is about: bringing Liverpool and Ireland closer together. What could be more convivial than that?\n\nEveryman Street Café will provide (Mon-Sat) the social hub for the festival, with a small library of Irish materials, providing space for people to meet, talk about festival events and make friends. The event holds multiple stories ripe for sharing, discussing and reconsidering. A 100 years since James Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man HE Ambassador to Ireland Dan Mulhall, Professor Frank Shovlin of the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies and other academics will discuss its significance and legacy. Scadán (a new Irish story and production) from Liverpool and Irish writers, actors and producers, explores five female stories on an Irish island, 100 years ago.\n\nCommemorative responses differ across the generations, offering moments of reflection and chances to explore a central moment in the foundation of the Irish Republic. 1916’s Easter Rising saw six days of fighting in Dublin, with nearly 100 men and women risking everything to travel from Liverpool to take part, stating a claim for their Irish-ness. Today 6 million ‘English people’ await Irish passport decisions, showing ‘Irish-ness’ is just as important today. Accordingly, this year, we are showing contemporary works exploring what the Easter Rising means – historically and today – in artefact form (Central Library) and in print (the Bagelry), with additional talks on the subject. Singer songwriter – Damien Dempsey – performs his unique album No Force on Earth commemorating the Rising (Music Room, Liverpool Philharmonic). We also have Peter King’s (descendent of the King Brothers, famous Liverpudlian Easter Uprising volunteers) Liverpool Lambs among many more.\n\nThe Liverpool Irish Festival does not pitch new against old. It explores what can be learned from both and enjoys what can happen in between. Without taking sides, it considers how and why we arrive where we are and how we may use it to shape what follows. It provides convivial environments to provoke discussion, encourage sharing and explore difference, whilst building friendships, progressing views and creating positive experiences. Sound interesting? Get along to the Liverpool Irish Festival, 13-23 October 2016.\n\nWritten for Bido Lito by Laura Brown and Emma Smith\n\n“It was amazing, really energetic, lively, really drew you in. It was just one of the best things I’ve seen live for a very very long time. Excellent. Really really enjoyed it.” Visitor comment.\n\nA record breaking 20,000 came to this year’s Liverpool Irish Festival, the largest audience in the Festival’s history, attended its 50+ events which took place at over 30 venues. 10,000 interacted with the Meta-Perceptual Helmets, a new media artwork available for free in the city centre during the ten-day Festival.\n\nThroughout the Festival, people were asked what they thought about Irish culture and what they’d seen as part of the programme, be it a film, performance, music event or poetry, offering three words to describe their impression. Responses included “pride”, “humble”, “loving”, “authentic”, “fun”, “history”, “friendly”, “lively”, “challenging” “moving” “memorable”. “Endless, surprising, journey” was the reflection from one event.\n\nLaura Naylor, former Festival Manager, says. “We wanted to ask our audience this year about how they see Irish culture. As we’re evolving the Festival to explore a more diverse combination of contemporary as well as traditional Irish culture we wanted to see what the response was. Irish identity and heritage is important to the city, the population of Liverpool swelled by four times its original size during the great famine. People feel emotionally connected to their Irish past and identity here, which is clearly how people feel when they come to the Festival. We also want to educate those who don’t know about the Irish heritage and connections of Liverpool”.\n\nWith new funding from Arts Council England, this year the Festival explored a public realm art experience with the Meta-Perceptual Helmets, created by Irish artists Anne Cleary and Declan Connelly. The highly polished handcrafted wearable helmets contained prisms and lenses and offered the public new animal perspectives on the world. Whilst giving the wearers a cultural experience they also taught the public about science and design. They were a huge hit with around 10,000 people trying them out.\n\nAnne Cleary, one of the artists who created the work, says, “We were delighted to take part in the Liverpool Irish Festival. The Festival mixes the contemporary and the traditional in a really upbeat way, and reflects the wide range of cultural influences that is Ireland today. It was great to be in Liverpool alongside such legends as Christy Moore, while having the opportunity to see some of Ireland’s newest and most exciting performers.”\n\nFor the past two years, the Festival has showcased some of the newer acts and cutting edge performance coming from Ireland. This year this included Rusangano Family, featuring mynameisjOhn, MuRli and Godknows who played a blistering set in Liverpool’s Kazimier Garden.\n\nThey said,\n\n“The Liverpool Irish Festival was definitely one of the highlights of 2015 for us, in terms of performance but also socially. As a band, it was hugely rewarding for us to be invited to play there and meet like-minded people for the first time who are actively making and promoting similar music to ourselves. It felt like the whole city was part of the welcoming party, and absolutely everyone we met there was bang-on A1 sound.\n\nWe were really impressed with the forward-thinking attitude of the whole festival in terms of pushing CONTEMPORARY culture. Tin whistles and wooly jumpers are all well and good, but it felt like the Liverpool Irish Festival was pushing a more current modern view of where Irish music is currently at, and show some real savvy in booking acts that are all breaking through and trying to sculpt a new vision of what Ireland represents. Everyone involved are certifiable legends. We LOVED it.”\n\nSea Legs featured folk artist Ciaran Lavery and electronic artist Ryan Vail in an exclusive live performance of their mini album. Manager Lyndon Stephens said the night was very special.\n\n“The Sea Legs show at Leaf as part of the Liverpool Irish Festival was just fantastic, great location, crowd and atmosphere. It’s amazing that the Liverpool Irish Festival is providing a platform for contemporary Irish music and acts like this. We loved being a part of it”.\n\nThe Irish Embassy in London added their endorsement of the festival “The Embassy of Ireland is delighted to support such as diverse and exciting programme as that offered by the Liverpool Irish Festival. It truly represents the breadth and innovation of modern Irish culture, featuring everything from an outdoor céili on the streets of Liverpool to innovative visual artists, contemporary dance and even meta-perceptual helmets.”\n\nFor now the Festival team is preparing for 2016, when it will return in October (13-23 Oct). There are also events planned for earlier in 2016, as former Festival Manager Laura Naylor explains, “We’re working with more promoters and artists in both Liverpool and Ireland and we’re getting a lot of interest for other special events and screenings outside of the traditional Festival dates. We’ll see, we could have music and film coming your way throughout the year”.\n\nNew partnerships in 2015 included Kazimier, Liverpool Small Cinema, Leaf, Magnet, Unity, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool Music Week, 92 Degrees, Bold Street Coffee as well as longstanding connections with FACT, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, St Michael’s Irish Centre and Mellowtone.\n\nLiverpool Irish Festival 2015 was funded by Liverpool City Council, the Irish Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Tourism Ireland."
