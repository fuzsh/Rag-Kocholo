He passed away in 1889.\n\nEven though Mark Dempsey was not married to Ruth Starr, they had several children together. One of those children was a daughter named Mary Anne Starr or Dempsey. Mary Anne's maiden surname was confirmed by the death certificate of her daughter Susie Maynard. Susie (Preston) Maynard's death certificate file # 116 56-12432 shows her mother's maiden name was Mary Anne Dempsey. Mary Anne had Susie with P. McCellan Preston. She also had red hair like her biological father.\n\nEven though P. McClellan Preston was the biological father of Susie (Preston or Coleman) Maynard, he did not raise Susie. Mary Anne (Dempsey) married John Coleman and according to family tradition John Coleman adopted and helped to raise Susie. Consequently, Susie used the Coleman surname as her maiden surname instead of the Preston surname. P. McClellan Preston later married Mary Anne Dempsey's first cousin Lucinda Ann Dempsey, daughter of Lewis. Lewis was the brother of Mark. Also, according to family tradition, P. McClellan Preston on occasion maintained a relationship with Mary Anne and he drowned while returning home to his wife Lucinda Ann after visiting Mary Anne.\n\nUPDATE: Jan. 2, 2010 Bob Preston who is the great grandson of P. McClellan Preston posted the following message on the Preston message board at rootsweb.com: Board: Message Boards > Surnames > Preston URL: https://www.ancestry.com/boards/surnames.preston/383.393/mb.ashx Subject: Re: David PRESTON b. 1830 and wife Mary Author: Bob Preston Date: Saturday, January 2, 2010 Classification: Query Surnames: P. Mcllelan Preston\n\nCame across this as I am a great grandson of P. McClellan Preston. I do not have specific answers to your questions, but have some related information I thought I would share. My father (John Preston, son of James Preston) is a grandson of P. McClellan) and his grandmother Lucinda lived with his family in Kermit WV until her death in 1949 (he believes). My father has always relayed the story that my grandfather (James) found his dad (P. McClellan) in the Tug River after he had been shot and killed when my grandfather was about 13 years old (he was born in 1897). Also, my dad only ever knew of him referred to as P and does not know if it stands for anything else. There are family pictures of Lucinda. Source: https://www.ancestry.com/boards/PrintMessage.aspx?mid=383.393&p=..fh.surnames.preston\n\nSusie and her mother and adopted father are on the 1900 Martin Co., KY census as follows:\n\nNo. 110 Coleman, John Sept, 1844-55 m 29 yrs KY NC VA Anne wife Oct. 1847-52 m 29 yr (married 1871) 7/4 ch. (also known as Mary Anne Dempsey)\n\nMadison 15\n\nSusa 14 b. March 1886\n\nLiza 12\n\nI strongly suspect that John Coleman is somehow related to the only other Coleman family on the 1900 census because he was listed in the same district or area where the family headed by the widow Lucinda (Ratliff) Coleman was living. She was the widow of Mathias or Matthew Coleman. Also, the proximity of these two families on the 1890 Special Census for the Civil War Veterans in the 3rd & 5th Precincts (Inez) is too close to be disregarded as mere coincidence. Mathias or Matthew Coleman was the son of Peter Coleman and either his wife Sarah (Dale) or Catherine (Stiltner). The following is an excerpt from the 1900 Martin Co., KY census pertaining to this family.\n\nNo. 74 Coleman (Ratliff), Lucinda Jan. 1836 64 Wd 4/3 KY, KY, KY (widow of Mathias m. 7-13-1854 Pike Co., KY, Mathias was son of Peter)\n\nSusanna dau. Aug. 1864 36 S.\n\nBlackburn, Henry Grandson Mch 1884 16\n\nNancy Granddaughter Apr. 1890 10\n\nPrevious to this Lucinda was on the 1880 Pike Co., KY census. The following is an excerpt:\n\nNo. 27 Coleman, Lucinda 47 KY, KY, KY\n\nSusanah 22\n\nEsther E. 20\n\nBethena 18\n\nPrior to this Lucinda was on the 1870 Floyd Co., KY census. The following is an excerpt:\n\nNo. 157 Coleman (Ratliff), Lucinda 37\n\nRebecca J 15 b. 1855\n\nSusan 13\n\nEsther 11\n\nBethany 8\n\nAccording to family tradition Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman is buried in the Dempsey family cemetery across from the old Mark Dempsey Farm.\n\nJohn Coleman later married Jane (Marcum) Copley. Can anyone identify the parents of John Coleman born 1844? Does anyone know if and/or how John was related to Mathias & Lucinda (Ratliff) Coleman?\n\nFinally, there is also another Coleman family who later moved to the area in Martin County, KY called Warfield. On the 1910 Martin Co., KY census in the Warfield precinct is the family of William Coleman and his wife Pearlie (Dempsey). Later on the 1920 census William is listed along with his brother Jesse who is living with his wife Sadie (Romans) and his mother Mary Jane (Parsley). However, further research suggests these Colemans were not related to the family of John & Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman. According to research found in the Logan Co., WV courthouse as well as census records, William and Jesse Coleman were the sons of John B. Williamson or Coleman and Mary Jane (Parsley). John B. Williamson or Coleman was the biological son of Hiram Williamson and Eliza Jane (Johnson). Hiram Williamson was a descendent of the famous pioneer Jenny (Sellards) Wiley. After Hiram and Eliza Jane were divorced, Eliza Jane married William Coalmer who was from Pennsylvania and had Prussian (German) roots and her son John B. Williamson then chose to use his step father's surname which was initially spelled Coalmer then changed to Coalman and now current members of this family use the spelling Coleman.\n\nMark Dempsey who bought the Chapman Farm below Warfield in 1851, had a son out of wedlock named Joseph Baisden Dempsey. According to Mark's descendants, Mark had a relationship with an unidentified woman with the Baisden surname around 1834 and they had a son named Joseph in 1835. However, the Baisden woman was not a woman with the surname Baisden since her name was Ruth Starr. The reason why the name Baisden was included in his name is because he was raised by Joseph S. Baisden and Lucinda (Osborne) who were very close neighbors to his mother Ruth Starr. Joseph later moved in with Mark Dempsey and at that point Joseph became known as Joseph Baisden Dempsey. Mark and his family all accepted that Joseph was Mark's son and Joseph is buried next to Mark on the Dempsey family cemetery across from the Mark Dempsey farm and Joseph also received land from Mark. This information about Joseph was included in a genealogical article that was started by Mark and later finished by Mark's son Lewis.\n\nIn this article, Mark wrote about his family and did not include the information about Joseph; however, Mark's son Lewis later included the information about Joseph when he finished the article. According to the article, it is believed that Joseph's unidentified mother was the daughter of an unidentified Baisden family. The only possible parents in the vicinity of this unidentified Baisden woman could only have been Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden. After researching the family of Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden, I have concluded that Joseph's mother was not a daughter of this Baisden family since all of the daughters of this family have been otherwise accounted for by marrying and having their own families.\n\nRuth Starr, who was a close neighbor of the family of Joseph and Lucinda (Obsborne) Baisden, may have been Joseph Baisden Dempsey's mother because Ruth Starr was known as having several baseborn children and gave some to their fathers or others to raise. Since Ruth Starr is listed on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census as a close neighbor to Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden, suggesting a close connection, it was plausible that Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden may have been one of the families who accepted one of Ruth's baseborn children to help raise and they may have accepted Joseph Baisden Dempsey. This would explain why there is a Joseph Baisden age 15 listed on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census in the household of Joseph & Lucinda (Osborne) Baisden.\n\nIn order to honor his \"adoptive\" family, Joseph acquired the Baisden surname as his middle name and became known as Joseph Baisden Dempsey. This makes sense when you consider the time period before there were any governmental social programs available to assist an unwed single mother in raising her children. In fact it was quite common during this zeitgeist to require an unwed mother to \"appear before courts to show cause why her baseborn children should not be bound out according to law.\" These children were usually awarded to wealthy families as servants or given apprenticeships to learn a trade in order to make a living.\n\nRuth’s first child was Davidson Samson b. 1834, who was also identified on the 1850 Logan census as Davison Samson age 16 living in the household of #133 Green White.\n\nRuth had another son John Dempsey or Starr who was born about 1836. This child appears on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census as John Starr age 14 living with his mother Ruth Starr. According to a deed transfer, James Starr had no children; therefore, this John Starr was not the son of James Starr. According to a written statement by Mark Dempsey's son Lewis Dempsey, his father Mark Dempsey boarded with James Starr in 1833 while teaching school and left home 1836 and went West to MO & NM and returned home in 1838. This explains how Mark Dempsey came to have a relationship with Ruth Starr. Mark Dempsey apparently met Ruth Starr while he was boarding with Ruth's brother James Starr. It appears that Ruth's child John Dempsey or Starr was born about 1836 or shortly after Mark Dempsey left home to travel out west, according to the Dempsey family article written by Mark's son Lewis. It has already been established by the marriage record for John Dempsey or Starr that Ruth Starr was his mother and his father was an unidentified Dempsey. Some people think John's middle name was Jude. It was not. This was simply a misidentification with another person , John Jude who was also living with James Starr, according to the 1850 Logan Co., VA census. This John Jude later married Anna Staten and is the ancestor of many of the present day Jude families in today's southwestern WV area. Ruth's son John is living with her on the 1850 Logan census as John Starr, but his marriage record shows his name as John Dempsey, which support the conclusion JOHN DEMPSEY OR STARR WAS ALSO A SON OF MARK DEMPSEY.\n\nAnother child Ruth had born out of wedlock and raised by his father was her son James Madison \"Matthew/Matt\" Duncan or Starr b. 1838 who was raised by his father Mark P. Duncan who was listed on 1850 Logan census as James M. Starr age 12 living in household of #528 with Mark P Duncan.\n\nAnother explanation how Mark Dempsey met Ruth Starr was through Ruth Starr’s sister Martha Starr. Martha married Mark Dempsey’s brother Andrew Dempsey. This especially makes since because Mark at one time was boarding with James Starr who was the brother to both Martha Starr and Ruth Starr. Consequently, Mark Dempsey was the brother in law of Martha Starr and yet is another reason why Mark was boarding with James. He came to know James Starr because James’ other sister Martha Starr married his brother Andrew. Conclusion: Mark Dempsey was boarding with James Starr because James Starr was the brother of Martha Starr, who was married to Mark Dempsey’s brother Andrew Dempsey. While he was boarding with James Starr, he met James’ sister Ruth Starr, who was also the sister of Martha (Starr) Dempsey.\n\nI also believe it's possible this same RUTH STARR MAY HAVE HAD OTHER CHILDREN BY MARK DEMPSEY after he came back home about 1838, including my great great grandmother Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman b. abt. 1842, who was identified as Polly Starr age 8 living in the house hold of her mother Ruth Starr, according to the 1850 Logan Co., VA census. Polly is a nickname for Mary. Also, according to Mark Dempsey's genealogical article, there is a 16 yr. period between the birth of Mark's first son Joseph Baisden Dempsey and his first child he had by his wife after they married in 1851. I think that during this 16 yr period Mark may have fathered other children, especially since during this period he lived at some point with James Starr. Also, according to the previously mentioned genealogical article written by Lewis Dempsey, it did NOT specifically exclude any other children for Mark Dempsey. It only included children by his wife Lucinda (Alley) and the unidentified Baisden woman, who as it turns out may be Ruth Starr.\n\nAlso, I have other info that suggests Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman b. 1842 may have been the daughter of Mark Dempsey. My uncle James Maynard is a descendant of Mark Dempsey's brother Lewis who lived at Kermit. Lewis had a daughter named Lucinda Ann. She was commonly known as Ann. Ann was the niece of Mark Dempsey. Ann lived to be almost 100 yrs old and personally told James Maynard who was her great-grandson that Mary Anne (Dempsey) Coleman was her first cousin. Anyone that has studied the Dempsey family knows that there were only 2 sons in the family of John & Rachel (Solomon) Dempsey who settled near the area of Buck Creek, KY which flows into the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River. The immediate vicinity of this small community includes the area of Warfield, KY & neighboring Kermit WV. Those two brothers who settled in this immediate vicinity were Lewis and Mark. Since Lewis' daughter Lucinda Ann said that Mary Anne was her first cousin, that indicates one of Lewis' brothers had to be Mary Anne's father. The process of elimination in the immediate area only leaves Mark as the logical conclusion as the likely biological parent since there were no other Dempsey sons in the family of John & Rachel (Solomon) Dempsey in the immediate area.\n\nThe following entries for the 1850 Logan Co., VA census should provide some more clarity:\n\nNo. 83 Ruth Starr 33 F VA\n\nJohn Starr 14 M VA\n\nHenry Starr 9 M VA\n\nPolly Starr 8 F VA\n\nShelton Starr 4 M VA\n\nRuth had another son who went by the name Joseph Baisden Dempsey. His father was Mark Dempsey, but he was raised by Joseph Baisden and Lucinda (Osborne) and he is listed in their household as \"Joseph Baisden\" on the 1850 Logan Co., VA census in household No. 79 as one of Ruth Starr's nearest neighbors.\n\nSource: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-6X39-FX5?i=12&cc=1401638\n\nAfter Joseph Baisden Dempsey was almost raised, he went to live with his biological father Mark Dempsey who gave him property and helped him earn a living by providing him assistance in setting up a business. Joseph Baisden Dempsey was also buried next to Mark Dempsey in the Dempsey Graveyard which is located next to the Dempsey farm which is located only a mile north of Warfield, KY in Martin County.\n\nNo. 522 James Starr 52 M Farmer $3,300 VA\n\nRebecca Starr 34 F VA\n\nJohn Jude 17 M VA\n\nJoseph* Dempsey 10 M VA 14 Sep 1850\n\nSource: https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:S3HT-6X39-N6J?i=78&cc=1401638\n\nThe following research supports the conclusion this Joseph Dempsey is a duplicate of Joseph Dempsey age 10, son of Andrew & Martha (Starr) Dempsey. Joseph was living with his uncle James Starr because James Starr was the brother of Joseph’s mother Martha (Star) Dempsey, who married Joseph’s father Andrew Dempsey. This conclusion is based on the following data:\n\n1860 Logan Co., VA (WV) census\n\nNo. 709 Dempsey, Joseph A 20 VA\n\nEmanda 27 VA (sister) b. 1833 (d/o Andrew)\n\nThis Amanda b. 1833 was the daughter of Andrew; therefore, Amanda’s brother Joseph was also the son of Andrew.\n\nA near neighbor was Joseph’s uncle James Starr who appears on the census as follows:\n\nNo. 708 Starr, James 60 VA\n\nRebecca 43 VA\n\n1870 Logan Co., VA (WV) census\n\nNo. 98 Dempsey, Andrew 62 (see census)\n\nNo. 100 Starr, James 60 (see census)\n\nNo. 101 Dempsey, Joseph 30 VA\n\nRebecca (Deskins) VA 24\n\n1880 Logan Co., VA\n\nNo. 370?

Mark had many more children besides those listed here. Mark and Lucinda raised a large family on a large farm located about a mile north of Warfield in an area referred to as Hode. Mark Dempsey was the first County Executive Judge of Martin Co., initially referred to as Superintendent, when the County was formed in 1870. Later his family moved to the new county seat that was established in Inez. His family became one of the most prominent families of Martin County and included many merchants and an organizer and President of the Inez Deposit Bank and an organizer of the Kermit State Bank and invested in the development of the area's abundant natural resources including coal and timber.\n\nRuth Starr was the daughter of Conrad \"Coonrad\" and Elizabeth (Scantling/Scantland/Scanlon etc.) Starr who were both born about 1778.\n\nAccording to family tradition this family was partially native American Indian, i.e., Cherokee.\n\nTheir children included:\n\nJames Starr b: Abt 1798 in Wythe (Tazewell County,Virginia\n\nPolly Starr b: Abt 1805 in Virginia\n\nSamuel Starr b: Abt 1806 in Virginia\n\nSarah Starr b: Abt 1808 in Virginia\n\nMartha Starr b: Abt 1812 in Virginia\n\nJohn Starr b: Abt 1816 in Ohio\n\nRUTH Starr b: Abt 1817 in Virginia\n\nLater in life Ruth married and had children by Evan Ellis and moved to Roane Co., WV abt 1855.\n\nThe name Conrad or \"Coonrad\" is such a distinctive name which I believe has a German origin; Consequently, it may be possible to find more research for this family in either Ohio or Pennsylvania. It is also possible due to the family's native American influence, the name Conrad may have been corrupted into \"Coonrad\" to gain greater acceptance by the local native American people.\n\nFinally, does anyone know if the descendants of Joseph Baisden Dempsey b. 1835 continued the use of the name Conrad/Coonrad or even the name Ruth?\n\nIf anyone has any additional information on the family of Ruth (Starr) Ellis, it would be highly appreciated.\n\nSources https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/50263772/markdempsey\n\n1860 Lawrence Co., KY census, 1880 Martin Co., KY census\n\nOral family history according to James Maynard who was a great grandson of Lucinda Anne (Dempsey) Preston. Lucinda lived with James when he was a child and she instructed him on the history of the Dempsey Family including families in Warfield in Martin County, Kentucky and Kermit in Mingo County, West Virginia."
