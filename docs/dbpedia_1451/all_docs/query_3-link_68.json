        "text": "BOULDER — The message from inside the Colorado locker room: Enough is enough.\n\nAfter another article was published over the weekend — this time from Athlon Sports — highlighting a reportedly “chaotic” culture inside the locker room with claims from anonymous former Buffaloes players, the new voice of this year’s team, long snapper Camden Dempsey, felt he needed to stand up for his teammates.\n\n“We’re a program that’s in the spotlight and with that you’re gonna have a lot of lovers — which are great — but you’re also gonna have a lot of haters,” said Dempsey, nicknamed \"The Governor\" by coach Deion Sanders. “One thing we recognize on this team is that Coach Prime is an incredible man who is in the space of college sports, he’s a businessman, he’s a family man and he’s also shaking everything up. With that, you’re gonna get people who don’t like that.\n\n“These pieces, it doesn’t have any impact on the team. We’re still down there (with our) horse blinders on practicing hard. At the end of the day, we’re working our hardest and we’ve got a coach who’s changing the scope of college football and that’s all we care about.”\n\nThis comes just a few months after several members of the CU program took issue with an article in The Athletic that highlighted former Buffs players, almost all of whom were recruited by the previous coaching staff, and how they were pushed out of the program during the first offseason under Sanders.\n\nDempsey knows there will continue to be stories written about the program given the national spotlight afforded to Sanders. But each one hits home for someone who grew up in nearby Lakewood and has been coming to games at Folsom Field most of his life.\n\n“Having been a Buff my entire life, the locker room is a family,” Dempsey, the junior long snapper from Lakewood High School, said. “Our team is a family. It’s the same thing as someone coming in and snooping on your Thanksgiving dinner and speculating what’s happening. That’s not true. With those pieces, it doesn’t highlight the good that our players are doing. It doesn’t correlate at all to what’s happening, what results our team is putting on the field. You’ve got the best recruiting out here, you’ve got a team with the second-highest team GPA in history.\n\n“It does disappoint me, but at the same time, we’re ready to rock and roll.”\n\nThat’s why Dempsey — as well as several other OBs, or \"Original Buffaloes\" that are still around from the pre-Sanders era — are trying to ensure that the traditions of the CU program don’t get lost in this era. Over 100 new players have joined the program since Coach Prime arrived.\n\n“We’re taking them out to all the big Boulder places that everyone goes, hanging out, really getting to connect with the community because that’s what we want this football team to be,” Dempsey said. “We want everyone to feel involved. The 'OBs' are trying to bring that pride and tradition back. We’re teaching our guys the fight song. We’re gonna be signing that loud and proud this year, which I’m excited for. It’s gonna be good to hear back in the end zone when we’re winning every game.”\n\nCommunity involvement and fight songs are one way to show the current group of Buffs is in Boulder for the right reasons. But winning, as Dempsey knows, is the real cure-all.\n\n“When those lights come on against North Dakota State, I think people are gonna see all the media (criticisms), the fervor, everything that’s been going around us doesn’t mean a lot when you’re gonna look at our record,” he said."
