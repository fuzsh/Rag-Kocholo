        "text": "Week two of The Great American Bash featured an NXT Tag Team Championship match between the defending Nathan Frazer and Axiom and the returning MSK – comprised of Zach Wentz and the once heroic Wes Lee. Together with Trey Miguel they made TNA’s The Rascalz, who were believed to seize a shallow white-and-gold division. But the only believing coming from TNA on Tuesday nights belongs to Joe Hendry.\n\nEarlier, the first two episodes of NXT on the CW were confirmed for October 1 in the Allstate Arena of Chicago and October 8 in the Enterprise Center of St. Louis. Joining the debut respectively are hometown legends CM Punk and Randy Orton, who only add to momentum gained after a successful two-week special.\n\nPete Dunne vs Trick Williams\n\n“The Bruiserweight” is back in commission for marquee matches against the likes of Williams, who still garners hearty support from Orlando. Zen friend Tyler Bate is shelved, but Dunne gains control with signature joint manipulation. They trade strikes with oomph, and a snappy Williams hits a mid-air neckbreaker before picture-in-picture. The latter’s Booker T-esque comeback is followed by an avalanche flapjack, and a spinning big boot earns a two-count. Williams continues fighting back until Dunne delivers Bitter End for three, scoring the much-needed upset victory; the defeated favorite is beloved regardless.\n\nWinner: Pete Dunne\n\nAs required for American-themed events, a midcard barbecue commences. Hank and Tank kick out Lexis King, and Robert Stone and Stevie Turner compete in an eating contest.\n\nSuited-up NXT Champion Ethan Page succeeds in looking punchable before NXT Tag Team Champion Nathan Frazer sarcastically wishes him luck. The latter laughs off not knowing where Axiom is preceding their title defense.\n\nTatum Paxley vs Kehlani Jordan (c) – Women’s North American Championship\n\nPaxley is cheered heavily against an edgeless champion, whose one defining quality is her Michigan State gymnastics background. The challenger plays mind games with her Jordan doll and retains control through picture-in-picture. Wendy Choo picks it up while Paxley stifles Jordan’s one-legged comeback, eventually hitting a 450 Splash for a big near-fall. The champion recuperates with an Avalanche Spanish Fly and Frog Splash for the win, and Choo returns the doll before ultimately taking Paxley out.\n\nWinner: Kehlani Jordan\n\nWren Sinclair suspects that Tavion Heights’ excursion to Japan is another murder cover-up before The D’Angelo Family walks in. Tony D’Angelo says if Sinclair wins her match later, Charlie Dempsey gets a shot at the Heritage Cup – and the No Quarter Catch Crew leader agrees she can potentially join the group. North American Champion Oba Femi storms past, leading cameras to Axiom and Nathan Frazer’s first encounter of the night.\n\nPete Dunne’s backstage interview is cut short by Trick Williams, who starts a pull-apart brawl. “Hey Pete, figure this out!” Williams says.\n\nOro Mensah vs Ethan Page (c) – NXT Championship\n\nMensah gets his in-ring revenge for Meta-Four’s Noam Dar, months in the making. His mesmerizing offense leads into picture-in-picture, but Page follows with a mid-air boot and subsequent powerslam. The challenger comes back with an outside dive, Rolling Thunder Kick, and springboard sidekick until Page slams him into the festive wooden picnic table. Mensah recuperates with his finishing corner strike, but Page survives with a rope break to eventually hit a big boot and Ego’s Edge for victory. “This ain’t NXT. It’s N-X-Me,” the reigning champion says.\n\nWinner: Ethan Page\n\nWes Lee gets emotional about losing MSK and reuniting The Rascalz in 2024. He and Zach Wentz look to regain the NXT Tag Team Championships tonight.\n\nHank and Tank’s barbecue continues, and Ashonte “Thee” Adonis tries talking up Jaida Parker, who instead banters with Lola Vice about the NXT Women’s Championship. Brayden Ray makes a rare television appearance, promptly powerbombed through a table for being naturally annoying.\n\nJoe Coffey vs Joe Hendry\n\nDespite being off-key and off-beat, Orlando becomes a choir for Hendry’s first singles match in NXT. He starts hot, diving onto Mark Coffey and Wolfgang ringside and sidestepping his opponent’s crossbody attempt. The stouter Coffey (and stouter Joe) dominates through picture-in-picture until Hendry pulls an Eddie ringside to eject Gallus. An astounding “we believe” chant accompanies Hendry’s finishing slam, and commentary can’t help but wave their hands too. “What the hell am I doing!” Booker T says joyously. The victor is interviewed in-ring, hinting that he’s sticking around much longer: “You won’t even need to say my name. Believe me, I will appear,” Hendry says as the superstar of the night.\n\nWinner: Joe Hendry\n\nAndre Chase credits Ridge Holland for upgrading their classroom, and the latter reveals an NXT Tag Team Championship match next week. He leads a motivational speech while Duke Hudson realizes he’s been replaced, and Riley Osborne shares the sentiment.\n\nThe barbecue turns sour when Shawn Spears tries getting to Brooks Jensen, and Stevie Turner steals Robert Stone’s idea for a multi-women number-one contenders match for the NXT Women’s Championship. The Good Brothers bury Hank and Tank’s food and drink menu, and a brawl rightfully erupts.\n\nWren Sinclair vs Kendal Grey\n\nNo Quarter Catch Crew’s incentive for Sinclair’s victory is a match for Tony D’Angelo’s Heritage Cup next week. She’ll also join the ranks, despite Charlie Dempsey’s reluctance, which is a given considering her Level Up-level opponent tonight. Myles Borne provides a feckless apron distraction, but Sinclair gains the pinfall victory regardless.\n\nWinner: Wren Sinclair\n\nAnother genuine Je’Von Evans vignette narrates his exponential rise. He’s young enough to call Matt Bloom Lord Tensai, who was the first WWE wrestler he met and his eventual coach.\n\nOba Femi says he’ll defend the North American Championship next week against “any man who is brave or foolish enough to challenge.” The D’Angelo Family nonchalantly interrupts, vowing to retain the Cup against Dempsey.\n\nMSK vs Nathan Frazer and Axiom (c) – NXT Tag Team Championships\n\nVic Joseph notes that MSK was stripped of the NXT Tag Team Championships 852 days ago. It’d be foolish not to recrown the momentum-building tandem and save a floundering tag division. At the helm are dissenting champions in Frazer and Axiom, who hit consecutive outside dives before picture-in-picture. Wes Lee receives the hot tag, presenting a rare match to the champions’ speed, but the latter come back with an Avalanche Spanish Fly and Phoenix Splash combo for two. Axiom inadvertently superkicks Frazer, and Zach Wentz capitalizes with a Springboard Cutter for a huge near-fall. Action breaks loose, and Lee keeps fighting, but a final Golden Ratio from Axiom helps the champions retain to a deflated crowd.\n\nWinners: Nathan Frazer and Axiom\n\n“I promise it’s not gonna take two years,” Wentz says to console a defeated Lee and a tearful Trey Miguel. But in return, Lee shockingly superkicks Miguel and low-blows Wentz. “You left me alone!” he screams, continuing the assault by sending Miguel through the barricade and crushing Wentz into the steps. “A-hole” chants fly towards the once sympathetic Lee, who turns heel for the first time in his NXT career."
