Shay Ryan, Ben, Neil Flynn, houli,daragh malone\n\nI get your point but I think it's a pretty good return from a single group of players. I think it's harsh on Tony Archbold and Darragh Ryan to not include them. Tony would have probably started for us this year in the league but he was out injured for a long time. Darragh Ryan is travelling and from what I saw of him last year for both Kildare and Sarsfields, he would have been a strong contender for that panel again this year.\n\nI would include 2 x Aarons , Jimmy and Paddy as already in the mix.. So thats 4 well in the mix. Daragh Ryan wouldnt be far off if he was about and neither would Tony if he had a run at it..\n\n6 is a decent return from any under 20 team in imo...\n\nTherell be another 5/6 from the 22/23 crop and im looking forward to seeing who makes it from that crop as there were very few stars (no offence intended of course). That in itself is a good thing as they had to work damn hard to get there.\n\nWhile it doesnt guarantee success 3 all ireland final appearances in 6 years does bode well for getting through some top talent.\n\nInteresting that the 2016 crop had so many !\n\nFor 2024, i imagine Glenn stayin on is most likely but as mentioned by others i would like to see a bit of a back room shake up on the S/C and tactical side. Also think there is no way we should not have Flanagan involved in some regard with a view to succession.\n\nWe have gone back and forth over the relative merits of Davy Burke but that ship sailed for now. But when we have an obvious successor in our county who has won an Ireland and played at the top level , we cant repeat the same mistakes of letting Flanno slip through..\n\nJesus it hurts a lot not to be making plans for Armagh on Saturday. I think we would have gone toe to toe with them too.\n\nFor 2024 i really think we need to hit the ground running... Being back in Div 1 is key (we say this on repeat!)... For me i actually think div 2 is marginally easier in 2024 than it was in 2023. Dublin 2023 were almost an automatic promotion team. You cant say that about any of Donegal, Armagh, Kildare or Cork.\n\nPromotion and a leinster title (yes you heard that right) would be my goals for 2024.\n\nWe are going to beat them one of these years.\n\nAgree with the lads, the u20 All Ireland winning team in 2018 has produced well over 8 players into the senior panel at some stage since then. Darragh Ryan is a serious player, would be great to have him back. As for Tony, I think many on here are forgetting he started every game last year in tough division 1 and only missed the last Mayo championship game in 2022. Thought he did extremely well all year - really direct pacey player. I believe he picked up a bit of an injury in the early stages of the league which ruled him out for the rest of the league. Only got back going again before the Leinster semis this year. There is a lot of players from 2018 and 2023 teams that will make up our senior team for years to come no doubt\n\ncilldara_abu wrote:\n\nOn management: I think Glenn stays, and that it is the default for year 3 on a 3 year deal. I don’t expect too much communication from the CB or otherwise on this matter. Would be nice to see a change up in the back room team that adds better S&C and some tactical skill to help give us a defined game plan.\n\nOn players/Monaghan match: I think we have a good bunch, for example — Darragh Kirwan played well in general play, but missed scorable kicks last Saturday... If he can sort this out and become a more regular scorer we will have a great full forward. Still depressed though, the game was there and the players on the field did not take the opportunity. Can’t blame the ref, we should have been out of sight with 10 mins left. I agree that the call on the (no) mark looked like a free to Kildare instead of a pass and a winning score for Monaghan. Not great indeed. Here we are talking about the if ands and buts again…..looking back, if only we had scored a goal from one of those decent chances (we scored one against Roscommon, and it was the difference between winning and losing), though Darragh Kirwan’s shot off the bar was far from a gimme, and Dan’s in the first minutes was a hopeful one too. Mixed feelings on if it’s good to see lads taking on some shots like that versus sticking it over the bar and (maybe) winning the match in this case. There is not a lot in it…3 games this weekend with a 1 point margin.\n\nIn summary, I think there is enough to work with… great to win U20 this year. I for one, think that makes this a successful year… Kildare have only won 2 AllIrelands in my lifetime, and I am old enough to have seen Shea Fahy playing pretty bad in Newbridge before he moved to Cork and became footballer of the year in 1990 (and All Ireland MOTM). We need that little bit of magic (anyone have the recipe?) to realize the potential in some of these players, and who knows what can happen in the next couple of years!\n\nIt's infuriating that Darragh missed so much and you can imagine how devastated he was. Usually he would have knocked over a few of them and he was very unlucky for the goal. Expect him to shoot the lights out for Naas now in retaliation!"
