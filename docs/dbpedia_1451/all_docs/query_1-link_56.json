        "text": "Confirming current selector Fitzgerald will take over from Dempsey, a Limerick GAA statement released on Friday afternoon read: “Limerick GAA wish to announce that the Limerick Senior Football Management have stepped down with immediate effect.\n\n“Limerick GAA would like to thank them for their commitment to the job and wish them well in the future.\n\n“Mark Fitzgerald will take up the new position of manager until the end of the season Limerick GAA will be making no further comment.”\n\nIt was announced last October that Dempsey would take over on a two-year term. He was succeeding Billy Lee, who stepped down after six years in charge. Lee oversaw promotion from Division 4 to Division 2 and reached a Munster final in 2022.\n\nDempsey previously managed Knockmore to two Mayo senior titles and worked with the Mayo U21 and minors prior to that. A month after he was announced manager, Dempsey confirmed All-Ireland winner Anthony Maher was on the ticket as coach.\n\nHe was joined by former Limerick player Eoin Joy from the Fr Casey’s club and Fitzgerald, the Kerins O’Rahilly’s clubman who has been with Kingdom minor teams.\n\nLimerick are still in contention to stay up in Division 2.\n\nThe county face fellow strugglers Kildare next weekend before their final round game against Clare on March 26, who are also hoping to avoid the drop to Division 3."
