        "text": "Two-time reigning state champion Central Catholic has released its 2024 football schedule, Athletic Director/Head Coach Greg Dempsey (Class of 1990) recently announced.\n\nHighlighting the Scarlet & Gray’s fall slate will be home games against rivals Whitmer (August 30) and St. John’s Jesuit (October 4). CCHS will also entertain Brother Rice as part of Homecoming Weekend (September 13) and St. Mary’s Preparatory on Senior Night (October 11).\n\nAdditional highlights to the Fighting Irish’s schedule will be road matchups versus 5-time Michigan state champion De La Salle Collegiate (September 20), 11-time Ohio state champion Saint Ignatius (September 27), and arch-rival St. Francis de Sales (October 18). Each of the aforementioned road contests will take place on a college campus. CCHS will battle the Pilots at Wayne State University (Tom Adams Field), the Wildcats at Baldwin Wallace University (George Finnie Stadium), and the Knights at the University of Toledo (Glass Bowl Stadium).\n\nThe CHSL Championship Game will take place on Saturday, Oct. 26 at Ford Field in Detroit.\n\nThe Fighting Irish are coming off a historic 2023 campaign that saw them capture their 6th OHSAA state championship in program history (1962, 2005, ‘12, ‘14, ’22, ‘23). CCHS, which is currently riding a school-record 31-consecutive wins, posted a perfect 16-0 overall ledger and a 6-0 mark in the Catholic High School League (CHSL), establishing a school record for wins in a season.\n\nCentral Catholic’s complete schedule can be found by clicking HERE."
