These vary from road running, as epitomised in the County by the Ballycotton Series and the '10' miler, to the International track & field meet that is now the City Sports. A review of Mountain Running is included, and there will be those who will well remember the 'Multi-Eventers' that the UCC Athletic Club hosted for many a year, and at which a future Olympic decathlete first competed in one.\n\nDownload Chapter 7 - Aspects of The Sport - Introduction in PDF Format\n\nThe full list, in order, is as follows -\n\nBallycotton Road Races - John Walshe\n\nCork City Sports - James Kelleher\n\nEast Cork Athletic Board - Dan McCarthy\n\nEVENING ECHO Mini-Marathon - Pat Walsh\n\nMountain Running - Denis Hegarty\n\nMulti-Events at UCC - Colm Murphy\n\nThe Team Manager - Joe O'Flynn\n\nOther Chapter 7 Photos\n\n'56' at the City Sports; the 1993 Sports had a 56 pound for distance event on the programme - the first time the '56' was included in an International for seventy years.

In the early to mid 'seventies', a few races took place, such as the Youghal round-the-houses New Year's Eve event, plus a handful of summer races held in conjunction with festivals, at such places as Skibbereen and Ballymore.\n\nThe main fixtures for road runners were held in the early spring, when Midleton AC staged their ambitious programme of events for all age groups. St. Finbarrs also attracted the various age groups to their popular relays around The Lough. The only real distance race, however, was the 15 mile run from Cork to Cobh. This promotion often served as the National Championship at the distance, and, as a consequence, attracted some of the country's finest long distance exponents.\n\nIn August of 1977, a five mile race was held in Ballycotton, with 34 runners taking part. A ten mile event was planned for the following March, as, at that time, there was no annual race at this distance in the country. Early March was deemed a suitable date, coming at the end of the cross-country season, and before the track commenced. And so, on March 12th 1978, the Ballycotton '10' was born, when 31 runners, all Cork based, finished the ten mile distance, each receiving a certificate showing their time & position on the day. A number of trophies and plaques were presented as prizes. The entry fee was 30p per runner, and the total expenditure on the race amounted to £70.10p\n\nBallycotton, 1980 - Dan Kennedy, left, and Mick Joyce, relieved to be at the finish!\n\nBy 1980, the numbers had grown to over 150, which was considered a huge amount for a road race at the time. In October of that year, the first Dublin City Marathon took place - ushering in the 'running boom' in this country. Over the next few years almost every town and village had a race or 'mini-marathon' of some description. The Ballycotton race benefited from this interest and indeed, near 'mania' in road running and jogging, and, by 1984, the Ballycotton '10' had a total of 848 finishers. The five mile events, which started with just the one race, had at this stage developed into a four race Summer Series, with promotions in Balyandreen, Shanagarry, Churchtown South, as well as Ballycotton itself, with each race attracting in excess of 200 competitors.\n\nLeaders in the 1990 Ballycotton '10'; from left, Sean Harte, John Scanlon, John Griffin and James McGee\n\nAs with all 'booms', a recession had to set in, and, towards the end of the decade, a lot of the races that had appeared on the scene fizzled out, due to lack of interest, or sponsorship, or both. Numbers in the Ballycotton '10' levelled off at around the 700 mark, still quite a sizable amount. However, in the last couple of years, figures in all the Ballycotton events have shown a dramatic increase. The Summer Series of 1992 had record fields in all four races, with an average of 250 in each. This year (1993) the Ballycotton '10' exceed all expectations, with the total of entries (1257) and finishers (1088) up 25% on the previous best. This significant increase was also reflected in the high standard, with 200 runners finishing under the one hour barrier. The race is now almost as well known in the UK as in Ireland, with up to 100 making the trip each year. It is also a huge community involvement, and a major boost to the local economy, at what is a quite time of year.\n\nThe early races in the Ballycotton area were organised with the help of Midleton AC, along with the Cork County Board, and also, of course, the local juvenile club, which was in existence for a few years. In 1981, Ballycotton Running Promotions was formed, which is probably the only club of its kind in the country, dealing solely with the organisation of races. Their efficiency and expertise have played a significant role in the development of road racing, not alone in their own area, but in the country as a whole, where the Ballycotton races are now taken as the yardstick for many other promotions.\n\nTop\n\nCORK CITY SPORTS\n\nby James Kelleher\n\nThe Cork City Sports replaced the old and renowned Cork Drapers Sports which had lapsed for financial reasons. The City Sports gradually forged ahead to become the leading sports meeting in the country. The inauguration of the meeting was largely due to the work of John 0. Jagoe. John was a former Inter-Varsity champion and was of course a well known city businessman who became the first president of the organizing committee.\n\nThe Army was represented on the Committee from the start and its contribution - in particular that of the Southern Command, has been very important over the years. UCC too has a representation on the Committee and the College has played a big part in the promotion of the sports through the years. An American involvement in the sports was established in 1951 when the American vice-consul in Cork, Nick Lakas, presented a solid silver cup - the American Trophy - which has been presented annually to the outstanding athlete of the meeting.\n\nThe very first Cork City Sports was held on July 26th, 1949. The UCC sports complex at the Mardyke was the venue - as it still is today. The admission at these first sports was 1/6 for adults and 1/- for children - 7.5p and 5p for those of the present generation. Among the highlights was the presence of an Army Band and the organizing Committee added to the fun with an aerial fireworks display. The prizes were presented by Doctor Tom O'Higgins. There was but the one championship event - national - and that was the 120 yards hurdles. This was won by Gerry Murray of UCC, afterwards, himself, a Chairman of the Committee.\n\nOver the years the fixture has been graced by all great athletes and cyclists this country has produced as well, of course, by many outstanding athletes from abroad.\n\nIn 1960 women's events were included for the first time and in 1963 women's athletics in the south received a tremendous boost when the Irish Olympian, Maeve Kyle, competed.\n\nA review over the past twenty five years would start with the 1969 sports - this was truly an outstanding meeting. A very strong American squad were present which included Olympic and International athletes Mel Pender, Charlie Greene, Neil Steinhauer, John Carter, Dalton Le Blanc and Ken Moore thrilled those that came to the Mardyke to witness world class athletes in action. There were shot putts in excess of sixty feet and high jumps of over six and a half.\n\nThere was a crowd in excess of ten thousand that Tuesday evening to witness these Champions and perhaps the top performance was that of Charlie Greene who clocked 9.6 for the 100 yards - equivalent to 10.4/10.5 for the 100 metres. Yet even for Charlie there was a mild surprise in the final. He had difficulty with the starting at the Sports and in the final he was left in the blocks. With the other sprinters heading for the tape he walked down the straight commenting that the starter was 'too fast for him!'\n\nAll the top 'home' athletes made the journey to Cork for this Tuesday evening spectacular; Fanahan McSweeney turned in many a fine performance and won twelve sprints - from the 100 yards to the quarter - in his City Sports career. Margaret Murphy too had many a fine win and won the American Trophy for the best athlete of the 'meet' in 1971.\n\nIn 1974 John Hartnett of Grange clocked a superb 3:56.3 for the mile. This surely would equate to a sub-3:50 mile on any artificial surface. Back in 1974 the present track was still only a dream and John's record was run on grass. Another to excell on that grass surface was Colm Cronin who triple jump in excess of fifty feet - the furthest ever on a non 'artificial surface'.\n\nFour years after that superb mile run of John Hartnett the Sports moved from the Mardyke as a new track was then being laid down. The City Sports in 1978 were held in Pairc Ui Caoimh. Among the visitors was future Olympic Champion and World record holder - Steve Ovett.\n\nCycling events at the sports ceased with the short re-location to Piarc Ui Caoimh. In that particular sphere Frank O'Sullivan of Fermoy was truly the king of the two wheeled vehicle. Frank won the American Trophy on no less than four occasions - 1955, 1956, 1959 and 1960.\n\nIt was back to the Mardyke the following year and the new track was officially opened when the Cork City Sports were run off. UCC took on an Irish University combination and a BLE President's selection in a keenly contested competition. There was an open mile and again Steve Ovett among others thrilled the crowd with a great race.\n\nThe Sports on July 3rd, 1984 received immense media attention world wide when Yuri Sedykh of the former Soviet Union broke the world record in the hammer with his opening throw. The distance was a fabulous 86.34 metres. Sergei Litvinov, the world record holder coming into the City Sports that year, and Sedykh bettered the previous world mark on no less than seven occasions but Sedykh's first round throw was the best of the competition. So there was but the one world record, even if there were seven throws in the competition better than the previous mark!\n\nThe Sports were cancelled for the first time in 1988 and again the following year. Sponsorship was no longer as easily secured as hitherto due to the economic recession.\n\nHowever the City Sports did re-emerge once again in 1991 and in 1992 the competition took the form of a triangular with Ireland taking on Russia and Southern England. This new triangular proved a great success and was repeated again in 1993. This year the athletics complex at the RTC in Bishopstown were reauired to have the six long throws and history was again created when a women's hammer was on an international programne for the first time. The presence of the 56 pound weight for distance caused much excitement at the Mardyke and as a strange twist the first two positions were filled were Russians - so much for tradition!\n\nThe City Sports have by now became quite an institution in Cork. The early July 'meet' remains the premier athletics event in the country.\n\nTop\n\nEast Cork Athletic Board\n\nby Dan McCarthy\n\nThe inaugural meeting of the East Cork Athletic board was held at the Scout Hall, Midleton, on October 4th, 1967, where the following officers were elected: Chairman: Paddy Hartnett; Vice-Chairman: Noel Higgins; Treasurer: Jerry Russell; Secretary: Donal Duggan. It was decided to hold a cross-country league that winter, but most of the races were transferred to the road, because of the outbreak of foot and mouth! The Board's first sports meeting was held on the Cricket Ground in Midleton, and the Abernethy Trophy was won by Ballymore/Cobh, for the top overall club.\n\nThe track and field championships of 1969 was held in Youghal Greyhound Track, where Liam O'Brien, later to compete in the Olympics, won the boys under-14 880 yards. The early 'seventies' saw Fr Liam Kelleher in Midleton, where he was to coach many National medal winners. In 1971, Willie O'Mahony, Youghal AC, took the post of Treasurer, which he still holds. Other active members of the Board in the early 'seventies' were Willie Harte, John Hegarty, Michael Burke, Brendan Barry, Jim Leahy, Brendan Hurley, Sean Kennedy and Jack Dempsey.\n\nIn 1974, Midleton athletes Linda Barrett, Noreen Fleming, Mary Fleming, Gretta Hartnett, Joe Brice and Kathleen Glavin won 11 National medals between them.\n\nThe mid 'seventies' saw three new clubs, Watergrasshill, with Eamonn Ryan and Maureen O'Connell at the helm, Glounthaune, with Pat O'Shea as the driving force, and St Catherine's with Fr Finn, Dermot O'Leary and Michael Burke looking after their affairs, with the latter also holding the post of secretary with the East Cork Board.\n\nAfter ten years as chairman, Paddy Hartnett handed over the seat to fellow Midleton man Phil Glavin. Joe Duggan has been involved with the Board for a number of years, in a public relations capacity.\n\nIn 1977, Mary Dempsey had the congratulations of the Board bestowed on her, for an International cross-country win, and 1978 saw Maureen O'Connell take over as secretary, a post she still holds, and fellow Watergrasshill person, Jack Higgins, became president, as Ballycotton AC became the latest club to affiliate. In 1980, Ballynoe man Dan McCarthy took over as chairman, and was responsible for putting all cups and shields back into operation, as well as organising the inaugural road race championship, held in Ballynoe, with Pat Whyte, Midleton, winning the event.\n\nIn 1981, Willie Harte became president, a post he still holds, and Fr O'Neill's affiliated, as did Carrignavar, under the guidance of Fr Liam O'Brien. In 1982, St Nicholas, Castlelyons, joined the Board, with Dick O'Brien the leading light, and the Carrigtwohill club was revived by Tim Mulcahy, Willie John Curran, and Willie Harte. St Coran's joined the Board in 1985 and were the youngest, until Glenbower AC joined the fold.\n\nA number of other individuals who played a role in East Cork athletic activies during the 'eighties' were Noreen Murphy, Michael Finn, Tom Casey, Carmel Casey, Tom Regan, Tom Houlihan and Mossy Morrisson.\n\nAt international level, there were many athletic successes, especially with the likes of Mike Keogh, Midleton, Liam O'Brien, Midleton and Sonia O'Sullivan, Ballymore/Cobh, all of whom went on to compete at Olympic Games. Mike in 1972, Liam in 1984 and Sonia in 1992.\n\nThe divisions youngest club is Glenbower AC, formed by Fr Liam Kelleher, on his return to the region. The Board's finances have always been in balance, especially with the introduction of a special championship medal with the Fitzgerald crest on it, but the financial headache has been relieved greatly, with sponsorship received from Castlelyons Milk, who have been associated with the Board's championships since 1990.\n\nPictured from left are Tadgh Crowley, secretary Cori: County BHAA, Catherine Murphy, secretary Cork County BLE Board Dan McCarthy, chairman, East Cork Board and John Walshe for many the face of the Ballycotton Series and of course the guiding light.\n\nAmong the premier events organised under the jurisdiction of the East Cork Board is the very successful Ballycotton Roaed Running Summer Series, which attracts athletes from all over these islands, and indeed from further afield. The Ballycotton '10', in early March, has now an entry in excess of one thousand. Such is the popularity that athletes from all organizations take part, and the above picture, taken at the fourth race of the 1992 Series at Ballycotton village itself, illustrates this.\n\nTop\n\nTHE EVENING ECHO MINI-MARATHON\n\nBy Pat Walsh\n\nThe Ladies' Mini Marathon has been one of the great success stories of the 'eighties and 'nineties for the Cork County BLE Board. It has turned out to be a great fun event, a method of raising great sums of money for charity and a prestigious race for the top runners. It has grown year after year with last year's entry exceeding 2.200 women!\n\nThe whole idea began in 1982, when Reg Hayes, then chairman of Cork County Board, and Declan Hasset, of the EVENING ECHO, among others, held a number of meetings. As a result, the inaugural event began in the autumn of 1982. The event, held annually on the last Sunday in September, has grown to the extent that it is bv far the biggest athletics event in Munster.\n\nThe very first mini-marathon was won by the late Ursula Noctor, from DCH, and she won it again last year, 1992. Regrettably, Ursula passed to her eternal reward earlier this year, having bteen sick for several months. Other winners have included Anne Keenan-Buckly, Liz Bullen, Valerie O'Mahoney and Roisin Smith. In the last few years, local marathon expert, Brid Murphy has been third on three occasions. However it is fair to say that, in this event, the real winners are those who take part, and complete the 5 mile course.\n\nOne of the great features of the race has been the huge sums of money raised for many charities, and general fund raising. Some causes state that it is their single biggest source of funding each year. Many thanks therefore is due to those who, along with competing, go to great trouble in selling lines, and gathering generously for their particular cause. I would estimate that in excess of £150,000 was collected for various causes in the 1992 event.\n\nThe principal sponsor for the annual event is of course, the EVENING ECHO which has been involved in a huge way, right from the inaugural event, and hopefully this will continue for many years yet. Not only does the ECHO contribute in monetary terms, by way of sponsorship, but also all the coverage given in the paper for the event, the facilities made available to the Board, and the help on the day. Special mention must be made of Ann Mooney. who has been writing, interviewing training groups, promoting the event for weeks before, almost every year from the start of the event.\n\nKEANE'S JEWELLERS have every year provided their timing for the event, as well as a printout of individual times for all the competitors. In the last few years, entries and results have been handled by the use of computer facilities sponsored by APPLE CENTRE HORIZON, who have been most helpful in every way. The NANO NAGLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, in Mahon, under the guidance of teacher Dave Manning, have helped in the 'inputting' of all the entries on the computer system.\n\nNaturally there is a tremendous amount of voluntary time and effort involved in organising a race of this magnitude; the fact that each participant will receive their position and running time means that if all details from the entries are not entered, then accurate results are impossible. Months and weeks of planning are involved, before this event each year.\n\nThe 1992 EVENING ECHO Ladies' mini-marathon; the first four finishers pictured with the Lady Mayoress, Mary Martin; from left: Brid Murphy, Ursula Noctor (RIP), Liz Bullen and Mary Sheehan.\n\nThe organising committee consists of Paddy Hickey, Blarney/Inniscarra; Pamela Buckley, St Finbarrs AC; Joan Keating, Belgooly AC; Eileen Vaughan, Blarney/Inniscarra; Mary Meagher, Blarney/Inniscarra; John Smyth, Leevale; Noreen Murphy, Carrignavar and finally Pat Walsh, Skibbereen AC - the chairman of the committee.\n\nThanks must also be expressed on behalf of the County Board to all the volunteers from the various BLE clubs in the county, who help out on the day itself. The course is always fully manned through the entire length, and the many stewards ensure that all the runners are looked after, as they make their way through the City and suburbs. In addition there are also many 'helpers' at the finish, where upwards of eight finishing tunnels are in use. The 'Echo Mini-Marathon' has developed into one of the three largest races in the country. The amount of money collected for the various causes is tremendous. It has also proved to be a fun day for the two thousand odd women, who parade their talents around the streets of Cork!\n\nThe support of the EVENING ECHO has been instrumental in the success of this race and long may their support continue for this the biggest event in the yearly fixture list of Cork County BLE Board.\n\nTop\n\nMOUNTAIN RUNNING\n\nby Denis Hegarty\n\nOrganised mountain running started in Cork in 1990, under the guidance of Gerry McGrath from Dublin. Once established in the Southern Capital it quickly developed a foothold, and now is a well established athletics variation on the local sporting scene.\n\nIt would be great if mountain races organised themselves, however this is not the case! This aspect of the sport is all about runners organising races for each other - over courses and terrain quite different from what one normally expects in athletics. With the return of Gerry to Dublin in 1991 it was left to the Eagle AC to take over the organising of these\n\nevents.\n\nAnyone who participates in regular exercise is capable of mountain running, and many of these mountain races are aimed at people wishing to run a mountain race for the first time. However many events are also open to the more experienced mountain runners.\n\nHowever mountain running can be somewhat difficult on the body, and great concentration is required on the slope upwards, but more especially on the slope downwards. Here there is a great tendency to charge down the slope which can be dangerous for the unwary. There is much skill involved in negotiating difficult terrain - whether rocky or boggy, steeply inclined, or a host of other natural barriers and difficulties, which makes this form of athletics all the more exciting and all the more different.\n\nIn Cork County, there are three races in all included on the annual programme, these are Corrin Hill, outside Fermoy, which is some three miles in distance, and has a 500 foot climb, Nagle mountain near Kilavullen, which is four miles in distance, and has a 1000 foot climb, and Musheramore, between Macroom and Millstreet, which is also four miles in distancem and is also a 1000 foot climb.\n\nThese three races were made part of a seven race Munster Championship in 1992. This was increased by one run to an eight race Championshipm in 1993, but with Musheramore being dropped from the series.\n\n1993 also saw a special race being held in Millstreet - to coincide with the Eurovision Song Contestm and was a great successm with over 80 athletes taking part - the largest number of athletes at a Cork Mountain Race to date.\n\nSeveral Cork runners have had great success at Munster and at National level. At National Championship level Brian Linehan struck gold in 1990. Pat Murphy of Eagle was a good second in 1992m and clubmate Eddie Noonan was third. Denis Hegarty - also of Eagle, won the Munster Championship the same year. So Cork is not without its share of successes in this very specialised branch of athletics.\n\nCork were also strongly represented in the province's success in the Inter-Provincial race on Carrantoohil in 1991, with no less than four of the top six man team being from Cork.\n\nTop\n\nMULTI-EVENTS AT UCC\n\nby Catherine Murphy\n\nThe first UCC decathlon, in 1975, saw a closely fought battle, won by British & Irish University boxing champion, and occasional middle distance runner, Mick Doyle. Mick won out through high point scoring in the 400 metres and 1500 metres. The eight man field were under the supervision of Fergus O'Donovan of St Finbarr's throughout.\n\nThe UCC decathlon was the brainchild of Colman O'Keeffe. It addition to promoting the event Colman presented a shield to the Club, to be awarded to the best UCC athlete. Colman himself was a capable quarter miler, clocking sub-fifty on several occasions. Although the event was sponsored by the UCC Athletic Club, it was nonetheless open, from the very first decathlon, to anyone who was keen to 'have a go' at multi-events.\n\nAs permission was granted by the Cork County Board, the UCC decathlon carried with it the title of county championship, and the best placed Cork athlete was therefore the designated county champion.\n\nAs was only right, specialist multi-event men won the title in the following three years, 1976 to 1978, inclusively - twice by Oliver Murphy, and, in between, by Tipperary man Peadar McGing. The 1976 decathlon was won by a mere 18 points - Oliver scored: 4,564 points, to Maurice Power's 4,546 points. In fourth place was Finny Long, international steeplechaser, who vaulted over three metres, and completed the 1500 in 4:15!\n\nHurdling specialist, Maurice Delany had the better of exchange in 1979, before Colm Murphy won the trophy five years in succession - mainly through high point scoring in the shot, discus and javelin. On one remarkable occasion - as can only happen in a decathlon - he narrowly avoided being lapped in the 1500 metres, but then Mark Earley's 4:17.1 was quite some running.\n\nAlong the way, John Sheehan, of Bandon, got his first taste multi-events, John later of course went on to become an international decathleten and was indeed a regular at the UCC event as indeed was Liam O'Brien, of Midleton, who was quite an all rounder, in the years before concentrating on the steeplechase, and middle distance running generally.\n\nThe UCC decathlon attracted competitors from all over Ireland, and others, to grace the event on a regular basis included; Frank Lonergan and Dave McMathuna of Raheny Shamrocks, LiamTierney of Nenagh, and Brendan Curtin of Crusaders, all national decathlon champions. In 1983, the contestants included future Olympic decathlete Carlos O'Connell, who placed fifth overall. John Hartnett, of Midleton, won that year with an impressive total that was helped in no small way by a 4.15 metre vault.\n\nUCC Champions for the Colman O'Keeffe Shield\n\nYearAthletePoints 1975 Mick Doyle 4343pts 1976 Oliver Murphy 4564pts 1977 Peadar McGing 4647pts 1978 Oliver Murphy 4856pts 1979 Maurice Delany 5266pts 1980 Colm Murphy 5006pts 1981 Colm Murphy 5041pts 1982 Colm Murphy 4897pts 1983 Colm Murphy 4696pts 1984 Colm Murphy 4722pts\n\nTop\n\nTeam Manager\n\nby Joe O'Flynn\n\nAt the County Board AGM, in 1981, Joe was elected Team Manager, in succession to John Walsh. During his term, Cork teams made a few token appearances in the now defunct Inter Region track and field competition, won numerous Southern Region titles, and, as a matter of fact, won every Southern Regional or National Cross¬country or road title open to the county, except the National mens cross-country title. Maybe - as he suggests himself - he should take a more active role in that competition!\n\nIn his first season - of 1981/82 - he was fortunate to inherit a solid team from his predecessor John Walsh. In the Championships, in Waterford, the hosts going for a sixth title in a row, provided the first two individuals with John Treacy and Gerry Deegan, but Cork packed well to win the title. Cork placings that day were Tony O'Leary 5th, John Hartnett 8th, Richie Crowley 9th, Pat Whyte 12th, Liam O'Brien 19th and Billy Horgan 22nd. In the mid 'eighties', Cork had the three in a row - 1983, 1984 and 1985, but have failed to win the title since, the consequence of scholarships perhaps. Individual titles were won by Tony O'Leary, in 1984, and Richard O'Flynn, in 1985.\n\nAlthough not quite as successful as their male counterparts, the women have their own list of successes. They were runners up in the National Championships in 1981, 1983, 198A, 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. The title was won in 1987, when Dublin were disqualified, and again in Killenaule, in 1990. Cork placings on that day were Anita Philpott 2nd, Valerie Vaughan 3rd, Joan Hough 10th and Susan Jenkins 13th. Valerie O'Mahoney provided Cork with individual titles in 1985, and in 1986.\n\nOur Intermediate Ladies won their inaugural championships in Kilmacow, in 1987, with Valerie Vaughan the individual winner in Waterford, in 1988. Our Intermediate men won the title in 1985, 1988 and 1991, with Bryan Meade taking the individual title in Waterford 1988, and Leonard O'Regan in Dungarvan 1991.\n\nThe high standard of Junior cross-country running in the county is reflected by the following results - Junior or under 18 ladies won the title in 1985, 1987, 1990, 1991 and 1992, with individual winners in Anita Philpott, in 1985, and Sonia O'Sullivan, in 1987. The Junior men won the title in 1981, but did not win again until 1989, and, since then, have made it four in row wins, and had individual winners in Leonard O'Regan, in 1982, Mark Carroll, in 1989, where we also had John Murray 2nd, and Declan O'Callaghan 3rd, John Murray, in 1990, and Martin McCarthy, in 1991. It is interesting to note that 1981 team - Kieran Stack 2nd, Colm O'Riordan 4th, Dave Dunlea 5th, Michael Kelleher 10th, Jerry Wallace 12th and Derry Beckett 18th.\n\nOur veteran ladies team of Brid Murphy, Marion Lyons, Rose Crockett and Pat O'Callaghan won the title in 1992, and even though our veteran men have not won the title, they did finish runners up in 1992 and 1993.\n\nOne statistic which bears mentioning is that Cork teams have won the men's Southern Region Novice title from 1981 to 1989 inclusive, and have not won it since.

At the Olympic Games, Cork born athletes have been very much to the fore over the years, and, in the early part of the century, the names of such as Horgan, Leahy, O'Callaghan, to name but a few, figured in the medal placings.\n\nThis tradition continues to the present, and Cork athletes will ensure that no major Championships would be quite the same without a 'Rebel' County representative. Over the past twenty five years, the following from Cork have enjoyed participation at this level - Margaret Murphy (1972), Donie Walsh (1972), John Hartnett (1972), Mike Keogh (1972), Fanahan McSweeney (1972), Liam O'Brien (1984), Marcus O'Sullivan (1984, 1988 and 1992), Barbara Johnson (1988) and Sonia O'Sullivan (1992).\n\nProfiles of these athletes follow, and included are two further Cork Olympians - Dave Guiney (1948) and Joe West (1952). Both competed at Olympics prior to the formation of BLE, but, nonetheless, both have profiles as they continue to provide the athletics world with much needed support.\n\nThree further 'Cork' Olympians are herewith mentioned, but are not included in the listing as such. PETER MAHER competed for Canada, at the 1988 and 1992 Celebrations. Peter was born in Ottawa, of Irish parents. During the early 'eighties' he returned to Ireland - North Cork in particular, where he fell under the guidance of Fr Liam Kelleher. Peter resumed training with the local North Cork AC, and soon was a scoring member of Cork County teams, at Regional and National level.\n\nHe subsequently returned to Canada, and duly competed for that country at the last two Olympic Games. One of the more\n\nthrilling sights of the 1989 World Championships was that of Peter, in full flight, leading the marathon for much of the opening miles. Another to run in an Olympic marathon was JOHN WOODS, of Liverpool, and one time Grange man. John was a regular with the Grange club, in the early 'eighties', and ran in many a 'Grange' International, and the National Championships, winning several titles.\n\nIn 1988 he barely missed out on the 10,000 metre standard wher winning the National title but subsequently ran in the Seoul marathon - for Ireland. Another adopted Corkman is SEAN D0LLMAN, of Leevale. Sean's connection with Ireland is through his mother, who is Irish; his link, and how he actually became a member of Leevale, is somewhat obscure! Nonetheless he made the qualifying time for the 10,000 metres at the last Olympic Games, and duly took his place in the line up.\n\nMore recently Sean has been injured, thus explaining his non-appearance at the National cross-country Championships, in which he placed, in 1990 and 1991. He is one though of whom more will be heard in the future.\n\nWhatever of adopted Corkmen, the following pages cover those Olympians who have been born in the county.\n\nTop\n\nDave Guiney (London, 1948)\n\nDave Guiney must surely be among the best known sports personalities in Ireland. Here in Cork, his column in the Thursday edition of the EVENING ECHO attracts a readership, not only here in Cork, but throughout Ireland, and indeed abroad in England, and elsewhere. Yet Dave's career as a journalist is but a small part of what has been, and still is, quite a remarkably active life.\n\nBorn into a family that had a keen interest in sport, it was hardly surprising that Dave should follow in the family tradition. There were National Champions in such diverse events as the shot and discus, the high and long jump, as well as the decathlon. Indeed the Guiney name was celebrated for its athletic 'talents'. There were also the odd Rugby International 'cap', and many other sporting honours, so Dave's involvement in athletics, to the highest level, was hardly a surprise - he was yet another of the Guiney family to thread the way to International stardom and beyond.\n\nThe list of Championship and International successes are lengthy and, as such, it is better to list them fully rather than dwell too long on any single one success. Space precludes such in enlargement, as the achievements are many.\n\nThe first of Dave's titles, at National level, were won when he took the shot and javelin, at the Youth Championships in 1940. He was altogether more successful the following year at these particular Championships, winning no less than five titles - shot, discus, javelin, high and long jumps. By this time he also was in the National record books, as he shared the National long jump record with Kevin O'Flanagan.\n\nThe first senior National title came in 1944, when he won the shot, setting a Championship record in the process. This was the start of quite a remarkable sequence of Championship titles in the shot, as Dave remained undefeated until 1957 - some fourteen titles in all! In 1946 he was the Irish and British shot putt champion, and was also Ireland's sole representative at the (1946) European track & field championships, held that year in Oslo, Norway.\n\nBy now Dave was among the top thirty shot putters in the World. His first ranking at this level was in 1943, and he was to remain at this standard throughout the 'forties', securing a berth in the top twenty on a number of occasions. He was among top 'putters' in Europe at a time when the Scandanavian and British shot putters were at their prime. It was hardly surprising then that there followed so much success abroad - the 'war' was over, and International competition once again resumed.\n\nIn 1947, he followed in the illustrious steps of another altogether all-time great of Irish shot putting - Denis Horgan. Denisis too, like Dave, was also a Duhallow man. That year he won his first AAA shot putt title. Denis, of course, was a Champion shot man, in the decades either side of the turn of the century, He carried away quite an array of AAA Championship titles, so it fitting that another Duhallow man should be the next Irishman to win an AAA shot title. Dave defended that 1947 title successfully the following year - a year that also saw Olympic participation at the XIV Olympic Games, held of course in London.\n\nDave was a regular on Irish International teams, from 1946 until 1957, when he retired from the circle. He won the 'shot' in 1947, 1948 and 1951, at the triangular meet, Ireland Vs England Vs Scotland, this was quite some distinction considering the standard of putting in England and Scotland at the time. There were also to be International calls in Holland, Norway and Sweden to name but a few countries.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1953 Dave set several National shot figures, from 14.71 metres - his first, to 15.23 metres - the last mark. There also being several National records set in between these two marks.\n\nBesides athletics there were other sports that attracted his very capable talents. He was a noted footballer and played with the Cork team at minor level, winning a Munster medal in 1938 at this level. There were also forays into the world of rugby, and Dave donned the shirts of Kanturk RFC and Clontarf RFC.\n\nHis career with the 'press’ is as outstanding as his athletics career. There was involvement with the SPORT MAGAZINE, THE SUNDAY CHRONICLE, THE SUNDAY GRAPHIC, THE EMPIRE NEWS, THE IRISH PRESS, THE EVENING PRESS, and THE IRISH INDEPENDENT. Dave was sports' editor of the IRISH PRESS, and Irish sports' editor of the SUNDAY MIRROR. He 'retired' in 1986 but yet remains involved with the EVENING ECHO and is also the editor of SPORTSWORLD.\n\nWhen not busy with the latter two, he occasionally has the odd book published. In all, there have been thirty such put into 'print' since the early 'seventies! The topics covered vary and include books on hurling, football, golf, rugby and of\n\ncourse athletics, and the Olympic Games.\n\nDave is a member of the International Society of Olympic Historians, chairman of the rugby writers of Ireland, and president of the Association of Sports Journalists in Ireland. He was also the Irish delegate to a number of World Sports Press Congresses over the years and has reported on every Olympic Games since Tokyo in 1964.\n\nAs a finale Dave was appointed Press Attache to the Ireland Olympic Team, for the Barcelona celebrations, in 1992, and duly filled that position with enthusiasm and dignity. He did not simply fill that role, as many of the Olympic team will readily relate, but also acted in a number of other capacities to ensure that spirits remained high when the odd athlete did not meet with success in the sporting arena. There was a tremendous rapport with the athletes - a rapport very much in evidence when Dave walks into any athletics complex in the country. Dave's knowledge of athletics and sport in general is near encyclopediac. This extends to the Olympic Games and in particular Irish participation therein. His continued guest for data and information is truly amazing and remains never ending. This is matched by an enthusiasm for the subject which is passed on to all those that he comes in contact with. Dave remains a charismatic figure, one not easily forgotten.\n\nTop\n\nJohn Hartnett (Munich, 1972)\n\nThe major individual success in Irish athletics of 1970 was, without doubt, the victory of John Hartnett in the International Junior cross-country Championships. These were held in Vichy and it was a tremendous boost for the new association to have a victory of this nature at a major Championships.\n\nIt was to be another four years before John was to realise his potential over cross-country on the 'home' scene. In 1974 he won the National inter-county Championship, and led the Cork team to the inter-county title. He was on another Cork winning team in the 1981 race, as Tony O'Leary of Leevale swept to the winner's rostrum.\n\nJohn studied at Villanova, where he was on scholarship, and there trained under the guidance of James Elliott, the legendary coach. By 1972, he held the National 5,000 metres record with 13:43, which, of course, was inside the Olympic qualifying standard for the Munich Games. On return from America that Summer, he contested the 10,000 metres at the National Championships, held that year in Banteer. These 1972 Championships rank as among the best ever, as many an athlete still was striving for Olympic qualifying standards.\n\nJohn was among the leaders throughout, as the pace never slackened. In a pulsating finish, he got to the tape first, and returned a very respectable 29:02.4. At the Olympic Games, in Munich, John never ran to his true potential, and trailed in his heat of the 5,000 metres. He duly returned a time of 14:34.6 to place twelfth in that heat.\n\nAt the National Championships in 1973, held in Cork for the second year in succession - this time at the Mardyke, John took the 1,500 metre crown. Again he showed great tactical sense and his time of 3:45.9 was good. This was to prove his second and last individual Championship success.\n\nThe following year, the European track & field Championships were held in Rome, and John was selected to contest the 1,500 metres. Unfortunately he again did not attain the standard he was so capable of, and duly placed seventh in his heat.\n\nMany will remember John in that very year, at the Cork City Sports. John's performance in the mile was outstanding, and, as the MARATHON magazine headlined the report, he was 'The Star of (the) Cork City Sports'.\n\nThat evening in July, John ran the first four minute mile in Ireland for quite some time. It was John's first appearance that Summer at 'home', after taking third place at the American AAU Championships earlier that year. Tony O'Leary set the pace early on, and the quarter was passed in 57.1. Eamonn Coughlan then took over on the second lap. Eamonn himself was looking for a European qualifying time, so the pace was not allowed to slacken, and the half was passed in 1:57.5. Here John drew level with the future World Champion.\n\nAt the bell, passed in 2:56.2, the scene was set for a very fast mile. To quite deafening cheers, the Grange man sped around the last lap, and came home in 3:56.3 - easily the fastest mile on grass and surely equal to a sub-3:50 on an artificial surface.\n\nTop\n\nBarbara JOHNSON (Seoul, 1988)\n\nBarbara has a long interest in athletics, going back to the time when she won gold at the U-ll BLOE All-Ireland Chanpionships, in 1973. This was in the high jump. There then followed something of a retirement, until Fr Liam Kelleher resurrected her career.\n\nShe was now sixteen, and a year later she showed her true potential, when she won the National under-17 pentathlon. Competing in the North Cork colours, she was still coached by Fr Kelleher. She went to UCC, where she continued her athletics training, and competes successfully at Inter-Varsity level. There were many successful forays at County and Provincial level, and indeed, with the UCC team, at Inter-Varsity Championships in the early and mid Eighties.\n\nAt University she also continued with her other main sporting interest - hockey, and indeed played with the UCC team, obviously her fitness for the game was hardly ever in doubt or questioned!\n\nLike the majority of all-round athletes - those that specialize in multi-events that is - she had quite an aptitude for the 400 metre hurdles. It is in this event that all the attributes of a multi-eventer shine forth; strength, agility, power, speed, stamina and technique.\n\nBarbara quickly developed into the best woman quarter hurdler in the country. There followed many successes in this event, among which was the hat trick of wins at the National Championships, from 1987 to 1989 inclusive. By this time it was Billy Oakes who ensured that she kept to training schedules and programmes. Billy himself is a well known sprinter and horizontal jumper. A regular International throughout the 'eighties', Billy is among the best triple jumpers that this Country has seen for many a year.\n\nA regular on the Irish International team, Barbara duly qualified for her first major Championships in 1988. These were the World Athletic Championships, and, that year, Rome were the hosts. Barbara ran in the 400 metre hurdles, clocking 58.72 in her heat. She was also on the 4x400 metre women’s relay team - combining with Michelle Carroll, Patricia Amond and Patricia Walsh. The quartet were eighth in their heat, in a very good clocking of 3:32.56. The following year, Barbara secured the Olympic qualifying standard, at the National Championships, when she crossed the line in 57.93 seconds. That standard had already eluded her on a number of occasions that Summer. She was subsequently nominated as woman athlete of the meet at these National Championships.\n\nBarbara’s consistency and dedication ensured a strong performance in Seoul, and again she ran a great race. She was sixth in her heat of the 400 hurdles in a time of 58.61.\n\nShe retained her National title the following year, and, since then, has maintained a high level of fitness. She still competes, and is a regular at Provincial and County Championships, over distances as varied as the 100 metres to the 400 metres. Her level of fitness is very high, and she is still capable of a respectable time over the ’low’ hurdles.\n\nTop\n\nMike KEOGH (Munich, 1972)\n\nMike was born in Midleton and he was seven when the family moved to New York. Mike Keogh was one of the outstanding schoolboy athletes in the United States, being invited to the all-star meeting in California.\n\nHe ran the fastest three miles by an American first-year University student, with a 13 minutes 33 second clocking. That\n\nsame year, he ran the second fastest indoor prep two miler, when returning 9:08.4. This was good enough for a third placing in the Philadelphia Classic, on a tight twelve lap to the mile circuit! Behind him was Donie Walsh, and there were immediate comparisons with a former Manhattan student - Marty Liquori. There followed further successes in the outdoor season. At the Penn Relays, he clocked 9:13.2 for the two miles, and then, in New Jersey, an 8:57.4 timing. Finally, he defeated the cream of American two milers in the Golden West, with 8:54.0 - the fastest prep clocking of the year.\n\nMike returned to his native Midleton for the first time since emigrating with his parents in 1971. He did not compete then,\n\nbut, nonetheless, he had his eyes firmly set on making Ireland's Olympic team the following year. Despite missing much of the season - some five months due to injury - tendon problems - he did clock 8:57.9 for two miles, and 13:33.8 for the extra mile, at the Freedom Games, in Philadelphia, that year. With another winter's training, he believed he was capable of making the Olympic qualifying time, in the 5,000 metres.\n\nIn the early Summer season of 1972, he defeated Tom Cryan in a 4:01.7 mile, and then finished sixth in the American Collegiate 5,000 metre Championships, in 13:48.4 - four tenths outside the Olympic standard. However the following week he won the American A.A.U. title, in 13:51.4, and, with his confidence boosted, again ran the '5', securing the necessary 13:46.8 at Portland.\n\nHe had realised his life long ambition - that of running for Ireland at the Olympic Games. In his first race in the Irish\n\nsinglet in Basle, Switzerland, he spreadeagled the field with a smashing last lap victory, clocking 13:49.6. Three days later he ran a 3:43 for 1,500 metres.\n\nThat Summer, he was defeated at the National by John Dooley in the 1,500 metres. The National Championships that year were held in Banteer.\n\nThat September Mike toed the line in his heat of the 5,000 metres. He was 5th in a time of 13:57.8.\n\nHis dream had become a reality.\n\nTop\n\nFanahan McSWEENEY (Munich, 1972)\n\nAt his best Fanahan was a brilliant athlete, with a turn of speed often reserved for the 400 metre specialists, in the Indoor American circuit. Relaxed and out of competition, he was very much a realist. After his elimination in the semi-final stage of the European Championships, in 1971, he moved up to the 800 metres. Despite a big programme of distance training, he was found wanting in the final 200 metres of the event, but the background stood to him, when he returned to the 400.\n\nA native of Castletownroche, he excelled in his early years as a hurler, and won minor All-Ireland medals with the County. After some novice successes, he burst into the limelight at the Ballyhooly Open Sports, in 1968. That day, he looked every part the future champion, and that was the view of Billy Nestor, himself a keen observer of the sport, and one who knew a thoroughbred when he saw one. That year, he broke the National 220 yard record with a 21.6 clocking - Fanahan had arrived.\n\nFanahan was to hold Irish National records, at 220 yards, 200 metres, 440 yards, and 400 metres. With John Hartnett having National records from the 1,500 metres up to the 5,000 metres, it must surely be something of a record, that two athletes from the one club could have that many National records. His 400 metre time of 46.3 seconds was, in fact, taken as the record, despite having clocked it for 440 yards. That clocking came in an indoor race, behind Fred Newhouse, a future Olympic multi-medallist, over the quarter and relay, who, that evening, was setting an indoor World record. Fanahan's time was a European record.\n\nA scholarship to McNeese had allowed Fanahan the opportunity to train and compete to a level that was indeed world class. His actual choice of McNeese is a story in itself. The coach there at the time was one Bob Hayes, and when the youthful and impressionable Fanahan was checking the various scholarships on offer, that name rang a very loud bell. Believing him to be the 1964 Olympic 100 metre gold medallist, and among the all-time greats of sprinting, Fanahan's mind was made up, and McNeese it was. It took Fanahan a couple of days to realise the error, and the Bob Hayes he was calling ' coach' was, in fact, his Coach, and not, as he thought, the legendary sprinter.\n\nWhatever of his former capabilities as a coach, Bob Hayes had few peers, and Fanahan quickly settled into something of a celebrity on the indoor circuit. In those years, in the early 'seventies', the sight of an Irishman taking on the best of the South sprinters was something the crowd appreciated very much. The fact that Fred Newhouse was among his main rivals, and that they traded wins, added to the excitement and anticipation of the crowd. Here was a world class white sprinter!\n\nAt McNeese, Fanahan was always among the very best athletes. He was the University Most Valuable Athlete on a number of occasions. On the indoor scene, he was tremendously popular, and invariable gave the crowd what they wanted - a victory in a brisk time.\n\nIt should be added that there were in fact to be three McSweeney brothers to take up athletic scholarships to American\n\nUniversities. Pat and Terry were to follow Fanahan across the Atlantic, and here again the family must have set something of a record!\n\nYet the indoors could be difficult. The continuous stress of running on a curved banked track took its toll on the body, and injuries were common. Fanahan remembers occasionally returning to his 'dorm' and walking up the flights of stairs backwards, due to these re-occurring leg injuries. The leg injury would remain with him throughout his athletics career, and, indeed beyond, after retirement from the track.\n\nYet whatever of early injuries, Fanahan burst onto the world scene, as he had done on the senior scene, in Ireland in 1968. At the 1970 World Student Games in Turin, Italy, Fanahan qualified for the semi-final stages. The European indoor championships followed, in Vienna, and there he missed out narrowly on the medals. A bad start did not help, yet it should be remembered that 400 metre running in Europe at the time was at a very high standard.\n\nThe 1971 European Championships, in Helsinki, saw yet another good performance, as he reached the semi-final stages of the 400 metres. The following year he secured qualification for the Olympic Games in Munich, and duly took his place in the starting line up for the quarter. Yet by now injury was causing some concern; he was quite capable of a one off world class run, but at major championships, with heats and semi-finals before a final, Fanahan found himself at a disadvantage.\n\nBack in Ireland, Fanahan was a regular throughout the county, at open sports, and at the Cork City Sports. He was never beaten over twelve races at the City Sports, and won the Pat Lynch Memorial Trophy for the hundred yards in 1970, 1971 and 1972, thereby laying claim to that particular artifact. At home, like in the American Indoor scene, he was the King.\n\nAt a time, when there were many capable 400 metre runners in Cork, not to mind Ireland - Cashel Riordan, Brendan Mooney, Brendan Crowley, Maurice Power and Mick Dooley, to name a few - Fanahan's supremacy was quite exceptional. The one person he had the greatest respect for was Pat Lynch - the St Finbarr's sprinter who was rather tragically killed in a car crash in the early 'seventies' before his career blossomed to its fullest. Yet even with Brendan O'Regan clocking 10.5 seconds for the hundred metres Fanahan still claimed the spot as premier sprinter in Ireland.\n\nRemembering Fanahan in his sprinting days is to bring back a memory of an athlete that looked every part the world class athlete that he truly was. It was Doctor Pat O'Callaghan who looked upon the Grange/Fermoy athletic clubman as one of the greatest natural talents that this country ever produced. That, coming from one of the all time greats of athletics, does say something of the high regard that anyone who saw Fanahan in full flow holds him.\n\nRetirement followed in the late 'seventies' with the leg still a problem. In subsequent years, Fanahan continues in the form that made him so renowned a figure on the world scene; his battle with illness continues to the present.\n\n[Epilogue: Fanahan McSweeney battled Cancer for several years, and died on July 27th 1995. May he Rest in Peace]\n\nTop\n\nMargaret MURPHY (Munich, 1972)\n\nMargaret Murphy\n\nThe outstanding local woman athlete of the late 'sixties' and early 'seventies' was undoubtedly Margaret Murphy, of the Ovens Athletic Club. Her specialities were sprinting and jumping, hurdling and shot putting, but she was a great all-rounder and a quite natural athlete, who took to any event with great enthusiasm and ability.\n\nAt the close of 1967 season, she was placed second in the shot, at the All-Ireland Women's Championships, in Clanwilliam, County Tipperary. In 1968, she won the County Championship 220 yards, and was second in the triple jump.\n\nShe won the 100 yards at the Cork City Sports, from 1968 to 1972. In 1968, also she won the National shot and triple jump events, was runner-up in the 100 yards and 220 yards, and third in the long jump - quite some achievement. That same year, she also won her first Munster title - the 100 yards. The following year, 1969, she won four gold medals in the County Championships, and six golds in the Munster championships.\n\nAt the All-Ireland Championships, she won the long jump, and the triple jump, and was second in the 100 metre hurdles. She also on the County and All-Ireland Pentathlon Championships. In 1970, she won five gold medals in the County Championships, eight in the Munster Championships, won the All-Ireland long jump and 100 metres hurdles, and was second in the shot, 100 metres and pentathlon. In June of that year, she set a new Irish record of 5.56 metres in the long jump.\n\nThe following year, 1971, she stretched her long jump to 6.06 metres, at the Banteer sports. She later won the National pentathlon title, and the 100 metres hurdles. She secured selection for her first International, in Spain, as well as competing in the European Championships, in Helsinki. There she qualified for the semi-final of the 100 metres hurdles in spite of injuring her ankle in the heats.\n\nIn 1972, she retained her National pentathlon title, and added the long jump and 100 metres hurdles, as well as being runner-up in the high jump, and third in the shot and 100 metres. That year, she competed in Holland, West Germany and London, and in the Olympic Games in Munich. She competed in the high hurdles and pentathlon at these Games. There were two more National titles the following year, before she retired from the sport. Among the many awards she received were Munster Athletics Sports Star in 1970, the Curtin Cup for best all-round athlete at the Cork County Championships, 1969 to 1973, the American Trophy for the best individual performance at the Cork City Sports, in 1971, and the O'Brien Cup for the best all-round athlete at the Munsters, from 1969 to 1972 inclusive.\n\nIn addition to her competitive career, Margaret prepared and printed a coaching guide to the then 'new' and innovative high jump technique, that Dick Fosbury initiated at the 1968 Olympics.\n\nThe full tally of her awards and International, National, Regional and County successes over the few years certainly singles her out as the top woman athlete of her time, and indeed among the very best woman athletes that this country has seen.\n\nTop\n\nLiam O'BRIEN (Los Angeles, 1984)\n\nLiam O’Brien took up athletics in 1966, with the formation of Midleton AC, achieving a moderate degree of success in his juvenile years. Liam won his first National medal at the first BLOE - then of course called Irish Juvenile athletic board - championships, in 1967. Since then Liam has won a National medal of some description, either individual or team, every year, up to the present time.\n\nThe highlights of his juvenile career were winning his first National title, in the under 16 1,000 metre steeplechase, in 1971 and, in the following year, winning the senior boys 2,000 metre steeplechase, at the All-Ireland schools in Santry.\n\nDuring the years at Thomond College, Liam won the Inter-Varsity 1,500 metres, and finished 3rd to Frank Murphy Junior, of Clonliffe Harriers, in the National senior 800 metre championship, in 1976.\n\nTrack and field in Cork at that time was still very much dominated by the Open Sports, with an event held virtually every Sunday. It was in this environment that he served his apprenticeship to the sport, having to graduate out of novice ranks, and work his way down to the scratch mark in all the middle distance events. Here the emphasis was very much on participation and competing, with athletes regularly doubling, or trebling, up for the day. It helped to have sharp elbows and a fast finish to succeed in this environment. Sadly these type of sports have now declined, to the extent that, today, there is no exclusive senior open sports on the athletics calendar.\n\nLiam has figured very prominently in National steeplechase championships since 1978 - not out of the medals any year and securing gold on ten occasions. He was selected for his first senior International in 1977, and has been on most team internationals since then, which include seven West Athletic competitions, and 6 Europa Cups.\n\nThe highlight of his track and field career has to be 1984, when he qualified for the Los Angeles Olympics by finishing 4th in the A.A.A.s 3,000 metre steeplechase, in a personal best time of 8:27.24. Here he advanced to the semi-final of the event. It was at this stage that he was also eliminated in the 1987 World Championships in Rome.\n\nLiam’s results in cross-country over the years tend not to match his track performances. In 1973, he won the County novice title, and had to wait until 1989 before he won his only senior title. He had a little more success at Southern Region level, winning the senior provincial title in 1985 and 1986, and dead heating with Tommy Moloney in 1987. His best position in the National inter-clubs championship was 8th, in 1980. He was also a scoring member on the victorious Cork teams that captured the National inter-counties in 1981, 1983 and 1985. He missed the 1984 success due to illness, the only occasion where he had to drop out of a race.\n\nThe highlights of Liam’s participation on the road are 45 victories in the Ballycotton Summer Series, 4 victories in the Ballycotton 10, and assisting East Cork AC to two national road relay titles.\n\nTop\n\nMarcus O'SULLIVAN (Los Angeles. 1984, Seoul 1988 & Barcelona 1992)\n\n(Left) Marcus O’Sullivan (’seventies) tucked in behind Owen FitzGerald of Togher. (Right) The same pair at the 1989 National Championships, with well known coach Der O'Donovan with the stopwatch. In his early running days Marcus diminutive stature was quite a sensation. He has grown in stature in more ways than one over the years\n\nMarcus has, for some years now, been a dominant force on both the domestic and World middle distance scene. A triple World champion, his level of performance over the past decade is such that he ranks among the greats of middle distance running, and he bears comparison, not in an Irish context but on the world stage, for he has long been on the world rankings in his specialities of the 1,500 metres and its imperial equivalent - the mile.\n\nBeing somewhat small in stature when younger, he was advised at Colaiste Criost Ri on one occasion 'to sit down, before he did himself an injury'. Early efforts to secure a place on the school's cross-country team was equally greeted with the comment to the effect that cross country could well 'be a little too strenuous for someone his size. Nonetheless Marcus' determination, which would be a constant hallmark of his subsequent career on the track, was already very much in\n\nevidence. His PE teacher, Bernard Martin, was also one who believed in full participation, and as such, Marcus had no other choice than to take part in the athletic programme offered at the school.\n\nMarcus joined Leevale at an early age, where his coach was none other than the great Donie Walsh. It was the former Olympian who provided the impetus, and was the instigator of one of the great careers in athletics. At the time, Marcus was more of a cross-country runner - indeed there was a run in the World Championships in Longchamps at the time. Donie believed that this 4:06 1,500 runner was a true miler, and not a cross-country man, so the training for that year was geared towards that end. The outcome was a 3:47.6 clocking for the 1,500 metres, at the National seniors, behind Eamonn Coghlan. He did claim a National title that year, when taking the Junior 5,000 metres, beating Brian O'Keeffe and Brian Roche, the pre-race favourites. Scholarship to Villanova followed, as did Marcus' rise to prominence on the international scene. He became an Olympian in 1984, reaching the semi-finals of both the 800 metres and the 1,500 metres, setting new National figures in the former. There followed a silver in the European Indoors and another National record - still standing - in the 800 metres of 1:45.87.\n\nThat same year, he was a member of the Irish quartet who 'broke' the World best for the 4X1 mile relay. Eamonn Coghlan, Frank O'Meara and Ray O'Flynn were the others on the team, and Marcus did run the quickest of the four - 3:55.3.\n\nThe 1986 European Championships saw a finals placing of sixth in the 1,500 metres as the indoors continued to provide even more successes. Two world championship finals were reached in 1987; the first ever Indoor World 1,500 metre title was secured at Indianapolis, and, later in the year, Marcus placed seventh in the 1,500 metres at the inaugural World Championships in Rome. 1988 was Olympic year and Marcus did better than his first outing at this level - placing eight in the 1,500 metres final in Seoul.\n\nEarlier that season he was a member of the Irish team that won the prestigious New York Ekiden Relay for the Asvcs Cup. His 13:52 time for the 5 kilometre leg ensured that the Irish team were very much to the fore when he passed the baton. The team that day comprised Frank O’Meara, John Treacy, Roy Dooney and John Doherty and with Peter Maher in the Canadian team there was plenty for the Irish spectator to cheer on.\n\nThe indoor season of 1988/1989 saw Marcus’ best form to date. He ran a World Indoor record of 3:35.6, at Meadowlands, and started among the favourites for the World Indoor 1,500 metre title, the Championships being held in Budapest, Hungary. He duly obliged, with a great win in a new Championship record of 3:36.64. Marcus regards this performance as the best of his three World Indoor successes. The atmosphere was second to none, and there was a huge Irish contingent present to cheer him on to his second title on the trot.\n\nOn the subject of times. Marcus' best for the mile is 3:50.9 - set indoors. This was run in 1988 a year before he ran his\n\n1,500 metre World Indoor record time of 3:35.6. However during his 3:50 mile he passed the 1,500 metre mark in a time which was sub-3:34. The timekeepers neglected to stop the watches though. and so Marcus lost out on an even better World Indoor record time.\n\nA brief flirt with the 5,000 metres saw Marcus reach the final of that event at the 1990 European Championships but he was never really at home with the longer distance. He feels that the days of milers 'moving up' to the ’5’ are long gone, as\n\nspecialization has taken over. The degree of training now required to attain world status in these longer events are such that concentration at an early age is required to reach the very top. Yet Marcus’ best for the distance is still a respectable 13:27 clocking.\n\nLast year, he ran a personal best of 3:34.57 for the 1,500 metres in Nice, and also reached the semi-final stages of the 1,500 metres, at Barcelona, his third Olympics, and indeed was most unfortunate not to have made the final. The smallest fraction separated him from this singular achievement.\n\nHis appetite for the ’big time’ did not desert him this past indoor season, and at Toronto, at the fourth World Indoor Championships, he again struck gold in his favourite event. Three successes in four attempts at these Championships - at this level - surely singles Marcus out as among the all-time greats of middle distance running.\n\nOne could continue at length about Marcus' career, indoors and outdoors, recounting various races, canting or records ana achievements. However suffice to say that Marcus’ standing on the world middle distance stage is at the very highest level; it has been there for some time, and the fact that he is currently running in sub-3:36 times for the 1,500 metres, his speciality, suggests that we will be hearing of further successes and achievements from our internationally renowned athletics’ ambassador. Long may he be a feature of the City Sports, which appears very much to be a third ’home' to this great Corkman.\n\nTop\n\nSonia O'SULLIVAN (Barcelona, 1992)\n\nOn a Friday evening last September, Sonia was crowned the IAAF women's 5,000 metre Grand Prix winner for 1992. Her superb victory in the 5,000 metres, at the Grand Prix final, in Turin, guaranteed her overall victory in this particular event. This was the culmination of a glorious year on the track for the Ballymore/Cobh athlete.\n\nAnd what a twelve month period it had been. Whatever success she attained before last Summer had been put in the shade by the tremendous achievements on the tracks of Europe. She thrilled us all with gold and silver at the World Student Games, in the Summer of 1991, before settling to further success over the cross country, in the United States, where she was a student at Villanova University.\n\nSonia is very much a product of the BLOE competitive circuit, having as it were 'come up through the ranks'. Successes at juvenile level were quickly followed by National cross-country championship winning performances, as Sonia quickly developed into an athlete of whom it was felt that great things were in the offering.\n\nHer first medals at Provincial level were won, not in running, but in the walking events. However she quickly added to her tally of Championship medals, and in one memorable season won the National senior, the National junior and the Colleges cross-country Championships. She was on her way.\n\nScholarship to Villanova followed and, with it, more successes - both indoors and outdoors.\n\nAmong the heady achievements of the 1990/91 indoor season was that World Indoor 5.000 metre record, of 15:17.28. Sonia continued to make even greater progress on the track during the following Summer.\n\nHer 1991/1992 winter training was very much in evidence with a superb seventh place at the World cross-country Championships early in Boston. The question then was whether the track fora be as good in the Summer. There was pre-Olympic success at the City Sports and elsewhere in Europe and much was expected of her at the Barcelona Olympic Games.\n\nSonia did not disappoint her growing legion of fans in Cork City and County. Fourth in the 3,000 metres and a semi-final spot in the 1,500 metres, in her first Olympics, was quite some achievement, although Sonia herself may well have been disappointed, such was her own expectations. Yet the experience of running at these Games will surely stand her in good stead for the future, as she appreciates all the more the very narrow divide between winning gold and being placed.\n\nHer post Olympic success on the tracks of Europe ensured a World ranking among the elite of middle distance runners. Irish records fell in such a torrent that the statistician had difficulty in tabulating the new marks for various distances, from the 1,500 metres to the 5,000 metres inclusive. Her Grand Prix, at the end of the 1992 track season, ensured her a command of the attention of the whole athletics world. At such a young age, there is still obviously much to come; no doubt there will be Olympic and World Championship successes and the odd record!\n\nTop\n\nDonie WALSH (Munich, 1972)\n\nThe manner in which Donie Walsh won the Irish marathon Championship in late June, 1972 will always be remembered by those who were fortunate to have been in Athlone on the day. As a result of his winning in 2:15:21.4, he was an immediate and automatic choice for the then forthcoming Olympic Games in Munich. He was also reckoned to be in with a very good chance of a medal.\n\nDonie was by then a graduate of Villanova University. He had earned a very large reputation as a fine athlete on the American Indoor circuit and on the outdoor cross-country scene. There had been many a memorable success in America over these years prior to 1972, and, among the better achievements, was a third place in the National Collegiate 10,000 metres. Donie had also attained a very impressive array of times; 8:40.4 for an Indoor two mile, 13:27 for three miles and 28:52.6 for 10,000 metres.\n\nYet Donie readily admits that his first year at Villanova was something quite unexpected, as he suffered from 'culture shock'; training was intense and exacting. Yet he maintained the effort, and duly was awarded with the success that hard training yields. There is a memory of the NCAA 6 miler in June 1969, when the temperature reached 85 degrees. Donie remembers passing the three mile stage in 14:35 but has no recollection of the rest of the race, and, in particular, the last six laps!\n\nDonie brought with him a most refreshing attitude towards his running, an attitude he still maintains, and all those that come into his orbit will readily appreciate - his keeness and utter commitment to the athlete and for the sport.\n\nIt was back in the mid-'sixties' that Donie first got interested in athletics. He won the half mile at the 'North Mon' school sports, and was subsequently second in the South Munster Colleges 880 yards, and third in the same event at the Munsters.\n\nHe initially joined Montenotte AC, where he fell under the guidance of Brian Murphy and Kevin Barry.\n\nIn 1966 he set All-Ireland College figures of 14:33 in taking the three miles. He had earlier taken the Munster Colleges three miles in 14:57; the first lap he covered in 66 seconds, and the last in 69.2. What the opposition thought of it one wonders! That year he posted personal bests of 2:02 for the 880, 4:21.7 for the mile, and 14:18 for three miles.\n\nSuccess in Ireland quickly followed and with it National medals and International 'caps'. In March 1968, he ran for Ireland in the International cross-country in Tunisia, and so set off an International career which remains unparalleled.\n\nScholarship to Villanova followed, and with it even further successes. At the World Student Games in Turin, in 1970, he finished fourth, in a very good 10,000 metres, before running another personal best for the 5,000 metres. The respective times were 29:31.6 and 14:09.8.\n\nHe ran courageously in the 1971 European Championships, in Helsinki, in what still ranks as among the greatest of all duels at this distance. His National Record performance was quite outstanding, as the top medalists broke the 28 minute mark,\n\nwhich at the time was quite unheard of to run in a Major Championship event. His own time of 28:52.6 was exceptional in the circumstances, as Donie ran his own race, and was not put off by the local hero taking the gold.\n\nThat same year, he ran a 10,000 metres in an International in Spain, in 29:34, immediately after completing the seventeen hour journey from Dublin. He also took in the 5,000 metres, and won that too for good measure, in 14:16.6.\n\nIn early June, 1972 Donie ran a 10,000 metres in Oregan, in the hope of making the Olympic qualifying standard of 28:50. He returned a time of 28:53.6, and so had to concentrate further on a qualifying standard. On his return home he upped his training, and decided to concentrate on the marathon.\n\nPrior to his Athlone marathon, his most memorable International outing came in Switzerland the month before. Here against the Swiss, he combined with team mate Niall Cusack, to annihilate the opposition before the two came 'home' arm-in-arm a hundred metres ahead of the field.\n\nIn Athlone, Donie ran the second fastest time in the World that year for the marathon. He literally scorched away and set a very quick momentum to match the 'scorching heat', as the CORK EXAMINER reported in the review of the race.\n\nHe was regarded as being a potential medalist, and as such had many a reporter coming to him in the Olympic Village. On the day of the Olympic marathon Donie felt confident enough to 'blast' away, and set a blistering pace. Unfortunately he was unable to maintain the impetus.\n\nBack in Ireland, there continued an unending line of Championship medals and 'caps', as Donie dominated the cross-country and distance running scene in Ireland. Between 1973 and 1980 he ran in every World cross-country Championship, quite some achievement. He also won the National 10,000 metre title three times in four years - 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974 and 1975 anc was also second in 1972 to John Hartnett.\n\nOver the cross-country courses of Ireland, he was very much the man to beat throughout the 'seventies. He started every County and Regional cross-country Championship as favourite in this decade, and at National level success followed on success.\n\nThere was individual gold in 1973, 1974, 1976 and 1978. He also won the inter-county Championship in 1973, and remains among the very few to have won both the inter-county and the inter-club Championship in the one season - 1973/74. Donie was also of course on the three Cork County winning teams in the 'seventies, and also collected quite an array of silvers and bronzes, both for individual and team performances.\n\nAs already mentioned, Donie figured on every Irish team at the World cross-country Championships from 1973 until the end of the decade. He was of course on that silver medal winning combination at Limerick, as John Treacy struck individual gold for the second successive year. For Donie, the World silver was the culmination of a lengthy and quite extraordinary career.\n\nHe remains among the best ever distance runners that Ireland has seen, and his experience and expertise are now readily given through his coaching with the Leevale Club.\n\nTop\n\nJoe WEST (Helsinki, 1952)\n\nJoe was born and reared in Carrigaline, in the area where he still lives. He was an accomplished all-round sportsman, and starred in athletics, hurling, football and bowling. His interest in athletics came via the 'Pathe News' film clips that were once such a part of the cinema. The sight of Son and Cabrera winning the 1936 and 1948 Olympic marathons attracted the young Joe West to athletics.\n\nHe was a member of the Owenabui Athletic Club, and won almost every race, from the half-mile to the marathon, through his initial involvement in the sport in the 'forties'. In 1943, he on the Cork Harrier Championship, and also the Cork senior Cross-Country, which he retained in 1945, and won again in 1947. He led his club to team success in 1945, and in 1951.\n\nThat year, he emigrated to England and, joining the Coventry Godiva AC, was equally successful in athletics there. He won several road races, and was a medal winner at Regional and National level, both with his club and Warwickshire. In 1952, he\n\nwas invited, by Billy Morton, to run in the AAAU marathon, which was being classed as an Olympic trial. Joe did not hesitate, even if the furthest he had run to date was a fifteen miler. Despite the presence of favourite John Henning, he duly won the title and below the 2:40 standard.\n\nBack in England, he then took in the Polytechnic marathon, run on the Windsor to London course. He enjoyed his run, and beating John Henning again, was eleventh overall in 2:32. Joe was a nember of the two man Irish athletics squad at Helsinki. Joe accompanied Emil Zatopek, the eventual winner, for half the journey. He duly completed the course, deriving great satisfaction in realizing his dream of Olympic competition.\n\nIn 1954, he returned home to Carrigaline for good, and joined the Rising Sun Athletic Club. There were to be further successes on the roads. He won the 15 mile Irish Championship, in Killarney, in 1954, and retained it the following year, in New Ross, County Wexford. Before the Killarney race, he was approached by one of the Kerry athletes, who asked that, if Joe was leading coming into the town of Killarney, that he would allow the 'local' man to go through the town first. As it so happened, both had shaken off the rest of the field early on, and Joe granted the request! However, on entering FitzGerald Stadium, where the finish was, Joe accelerated away from his Kerry 'friend', and went on to win the gold medal, and the quite magnificent bronze 'Tailteann' shield for his achievement.\n\nHe won the 'marathon' at the City Sports the following year, and, here again, there is another story; the finish was on the track at the 'Dyke, and the athletes, coming from the start at Tivoli, had to run up the Mardyke Walk. Joe passed the entrance, believing it to be further up the 'dyke; he was stopped by a policeman. Donal O'Neill, who told him of his error and, despite the detour, Joe still went onto victory. He was also successful over cross-country, on his return, and won the Cork Senior 1954, helping his club Rising Sun to the team title.\n\nAt the present Joe remains very active and is a regular visitor at 'local' athletic meetings.\n\nLooking Back - 25 Years of BLE in Cork - Chapter 3 - Consolidation and Maturity\n\nLOOKING BACK - 25 Years of BLE in Cork\n\nIndex\n\nChapter 3 - Consolidation\n\n1980\n\nThe 1980 'Horae Countries' cross-country International saw Catherine Hourihan and Fionnuala Morrish carrying the Cork colours. Both figured in the County senior cross-country but were nonetheless behind the winner, Valerie O'Mahoney of Togher. John Hartnett of Grange took his fourth title as runner-up Donie Walsh lead Leevale to yet another club Championship.\n\nAt the George V. Ryan 'meet' in Dublin there were successes for Liam O'Brien in the steeplechase (8:49.3), Dave Murray in the high jump (2.02 metres) and Joy Murphy in the long jump (5.21 metres). The Nationals saw Liam O'Brien win his first steeplechase as Joe Brice and Mick O'Flynn retained their discus and triple titles respectively.\n\nJohn Hartnett of Midleton won the pole vault with a 4.20 metre clearance and at the UCC Decathlon in July he topped the 6,000 points mark, establishing a new county record with 6,011 points. Barbara Johnson, a student at the College, competed in her first pentathlon.\n\nThe same month Frank O'Meara ran a 3:56 mile at the City Sports. There were other World Class performances including a 2.28 metre high but two athletes from the Soviet Union captured the imagination of the crowd. Sergei Litvinov beat his compatriot Yuri Sedykh in the hammer - 82.20 metres / 80.34 metres. This was their first visit to Cork and the City Sports but the link would continue and indeed be reinforced with altogether better distance throwing.\n\n1981\n\nOver the winter Richie Crowley had his first individual gold at the County Senior cross-country. Such was the middle distance talent in the County that Richie had to wait until now for that particular medal. Fionnuala Morrish of Leevale won the women's race and went on to win the National inter-county Championship, leading Cork to silver.\n\nRobin Sykes, the National Coach, travelled to Cork in April and conducted a weekend course for coaches. Among the more memorable achievements was of County Board Secretary, Brendan Crowley, attempting the discus. Brendan's initial efforts were non too technical but Robin eventually enjoyed success as everyone's efforts were finally rewarded with Brendan actually managing a turn and some distance from the subsequent throw.\n\nEamon Coghlan took the mile at the City Sports in some style, breaking the National record in the process. His 3:52.11 underlined his standing in the wider World of athletics.\n\nMichael Kiernan of Leevale and Dolphin RFC made his County debut and enjoyed a sprint double, returning very favourable times. The Irish rugby international took his talent to the National seniors and won gold over 200 metres, recording a personal best of 21.48 in the final. Liam O'Brien (steeplechase) and Joe Brice (discus) retained their National titles.\n\nOne Deirdre Murphy of Ballyvourney competed for Ireland in the 130 metre hurdles in Skopje, Yugoslavia with the hosts and Ireece providing the opposition. It surely was a proud moment for the parents as she maintained the family tradition. For Margaret, Deirdre's mother, it surely brought back memories of past glory, of Helsinki and Munich.\n\nAt the annual County Convention Reg Hayes, the outgoing Chairman, spoke at length on two topics - sport in schools and women's athletics. On the former he urged all clubs in the county to approach local schools in an effort to promote athletics and to inculcate the idea of the necessity of physical education and its place in the all-round education of the individual. Reg also spoke on the state of women's athletics, describing this area as being in a 'sad state of affairs'. Remedial action was necessary to ensure that standards did not fall further.\n\n1982\n\nAmong the motions passed was one sponsored by Leevale which lead to the establishment of a coaching sub-committee.\n\nThe 'Grange' International cross-country was again blessed with a number of World class athletes from overseas. Paula Fudge and Mick McLeod took the individual honours. Valerie O'Mahony of Togher and Tony O'Leary of Leevale in 5th and 16th places respectively were the first Cork runners 'home'.\n\nLeevale enjoyed all-round success at the County senior cross-country providing individual winners in Tony O'Leary and Fionnuala Morrish and also taking both team titles. Fionnuala went on to win the National senior cross-country Championship as Tony led Cork to triumph in the inter-counties. The winning Cork squad included, besides Tony, John Hartnett, Richie Crowley, Pat White, Liam O'Brien and Billy Horgan. At the National seniors during the Summer Joe Brice took his fourth discus title in a row, his winning throw of 50.86 metres being the lowest of his four Championship returns. For Liverpool born John Woods, competing in the Grange colours, there was some disappointment in the 10,000 metres. He won gold but his new personal best time of 28:30.64 was outside the European qualifying standard of 28:30! Yet there was to be a European performance for John and he went on to finish seventeenth in the Athens final in 29:39.88.\n\nBrendan Crowley in his Secretary's report to the annual Convention (1982) spoke on the upsurge in road running which he believed was having a detrimental effect on track & field athletics in Cork. He added that 'road running...(was) the most popular form of athletics within the county (now)' and that one good aspect of this boom was BLE and NACAI athletes running together, something that he hoped would spread to track & field and cross-country. However 'too many events packed into a season could result in events killing each other' - there were some twenty road races that year in the County.\n\nRead more ...\n\nMidleton News Archive\n\nHistorical Athletics Articles & Copies of Midleton News\n\n2008\n\nSpecial Commemorative 'Ballycotton 10' 30th Anniversary Edition\n\nMarathon Magazine Archives\n\nHistorical Copies of Marathon Magazine\n\nArchive copies of Irish Runner Magazine\n\n1984\n\nEast Cork Clubs - Marathon Magazine Annual 1984\n\n1985\n\nInterview with Olympic Hammer Thrower Declan Hegarty - August-September 1985\n\n1986\n\nVALUABLE ROLE of B.L.O.E. - Marathon Magazine, June 1986 - Vol 24, No 4, P26 - 28\n\n1987\n\nMarathon Volume 28 Number 4 - September 1987\n\n1997\n\nNational BLOE Star Awards 1996 - Marathon Yearbook, Volume 35 Number 2, P18 - Christmas 1997\n\n1985\n\nBLE National Intercounty Cross-Country Championship Results - December 1985 - Marathon Magazine, February 1986, Vol 24, No 1, P 10 - 13\n\nArchived Articles\n\nIrish Runner\n\nMarathon Magazine\n\nLooking Back - 25 Years of BLE in Cork\n\nLooking Back - 25 Years of BLE in Cork - Chapter 8 - Personalities\n\nLOOKING BACK - 25 Years of BLE in Cork\n\nIndex\n\nChapter 8 - Personalities\n\nIndex\n\nThe profiles of a number of personalities from the world of athletics are covered in the following pages.

However it was not until 1979 that she joined Mallow AC, and there was coached by Malachy Downey. Terrie remained with Mallow AC until 1989. During that time she progressed very slowly up the age groups. It was in 1985 that she received her first senior International, and she has been on the National Irish senior team since.\n\nFrom 1985 onwards, Terrie had set her sights on breaking the Irish Senior long jump record, which then stood at 6.17 metres. She was jumping in and around the six metre mark for a couple of years. Then, on a wet and cold night, at the Cork City Sports, in 1988, the goal was achieved, as Terrie broke the sand at 6.21 metres. A fortnight later, at the National Championships in Santry, she extended it further - to 6.27 metres.\n\nTerri Horgan Sets Irish Record at 1988 Cork City Sports\n\nTerrie had by now spent a year studying Business Studies Recreation and Leisure, at Waterford Regional Technical College. She returned to College in the September, to begin again the long haul of lectures, practicals and training. The goal for 1989 was to qualify for the World Student Games. But disaster struck in early May, when jumping at the College Sports - she injured the jumping foot on 'take off', 'real damage' was done as she had 'torn' the ligaments in the ankle.\n\nTerrie was out of training, from early May until late June, and the preparation for the National Championships in July was minimal. However she was still selected on the Irish Team for the Europa Cup, in Santry. There she was as surprised as anybody else when she broke the National Record with a leap of 6.39 metres to win. Terrie made the team for the World Student Games, and this was one of the highlights of her very brief athletics career to date.\n\nAt the end of 1989, Terrie moved to Dublin to work, joining Dublin City Harriers. The 1990 season started quite well - she made the Olympic Panel, and had come within a centimetre of her own Irish Record. She was now under the guidance of Oliver Scully, and was to progress steadily to achieve the Olympic Qualifying standard for Barcelona.\n\nBut neither had expected Terrie to run into the problems that occurred in 1991. In January of that year, she complained of a knee problem, and it was not until September that the medical team were able to rect"
