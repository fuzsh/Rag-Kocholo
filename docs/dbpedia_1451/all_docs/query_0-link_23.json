        "text": "The Access to Post-Primary Teaching (APT) Project Launch and Schools’ Event took place at NUI Galway on Tuesday, May 21st 2019. The APT project, funded by the Higher Education Authority under the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH), Strand 1 (Equity of Access to Initial Teacher Education), is a three-year joint initiative between NUI Galway and St. Angela’s College, Sligo, and aims to support the progression and retention of those from lower socio-economic groups in initial teacher education (ITE). The NUI Galway aspect of the APT project is led by Dr Elaine Keane and Dr Manuela Heinz (APT Principal Investigators), and Dr Andrea Lynch (APT Post-doctoral Researcher), in the School of Education, in partnership with the Access Centre and the Career Development Centre at NUI Galway. The project is supported by funding from Galway University Foundation as well as the HEA. Drs Keane and Heinz previously implemented the highly successful Diversity in Initial Teacher Education (DITE) national research project (funded by the Irish Research Council), establishing the first national evidence base in relation to the socio-demographic profile of applicants and entrants to ITE in Ireland. Drs Keane and Heinz published their findings in a range of peer-reviewed journals demonstrating the homogeneity of the ITE population in Ireland and the particular under-representation of those from lower socio-economic and minority ethnic backgrounds and those with disabilities. Dr Keane was subsequently invited to be a member of the Department of Education and Skills Working Group (Diversity in Initial Teacher Education) which led to the establishment of PATH1 funding to diversify ITE. Dr. Heinz has been invited and is currently working on the data working group of the Teacher Supply Data Working Group set up by the Department of Education and Skills. The APT project currently supports 21 participants in the Professional Master of Education (PME) in the School of Education at NUI Galway, and also works with senior cycle school pupils in DEIS schools, through the APT participants’ school placements as student teachers, in relation to higher education progression, and career planning. On Tuesday, May 21st 2019, as part of the celebrations for the 20th Anniversary of Access at NUI Galway, the APT project was formally launched by Professor Gerry MacRuairc, Head of the School of Education. Over 100 senior cycle pupils from schools across the BMW region, teachers from these schools, and the APT project participants, participated in the day-long event, which featured presentations and contributions from Professor Liz Thomas (Director and Chair, Widening Participation Research Centre, Edge Hill University, England); Hannagh McGinley (PhD student in the School of Education); APT Project leads Dr. Elaine Keane and Dr Manuela Heinz; Imelda Byrne (Director of Access); Josephine Walsh (Head of Career Development Centre); Dr Olga O’Mahony (Access Centre); Rachel Konisberry (School of Education); and Owen Mac an Bhaird (PME student), as well as small-group workshops facilitated by the Access and Career Development Centres. The day’s sessions were aimed at supporting school pupils’ higher education and career planning, including in relation to teaching as a career. Also in attendance were representatives from the Department of Education and Skills (Eilish Bergin and Sarah Kearns) and the Higher Education Authority (Neil McDermott, Senior Manager, Access Policy). Quotes:Dr Elaine Keane: It was a privilege for us in the School of Education to host students from many schools in Galway and beyond, including from Donegal, at our Access to Post-primary (APT) project event. Diversifying the teaching profession has long been a core research focus for us here in the School; through the Diversity in Initial Teacher Education (DITE) project, funded by the Irish Research Council, we established a national evidence base regarding the backgrounds and motivations of those applying and entering initial teacher education (ITE). Through the APT project, funded by the Higher Education Authority and Galway University Foundation, we are acting on this evidence base, and working to attract and support those under-represented in the teaching profession into our flagship ITE programme, the Professional Master of Education (PME). We currently have 21 APT participants on the PME. The day was wonderfully inspiring and we were delighted by the response of the school pupils. Dr Manuela Heinz: It was fantastic to see so many second-level students actively participating during lectures and workshops throughout the day and showing an interest in teaching and higher education. The young people asked many thoughtful questions and made a wonderful contribution to this important day. We hope that the students have gained a better understanding of the many routes that are available to them with regard to their future career choices. We would definitely love to see some of them again in the future at NUI Galway and, hopefully, in the School of Education. Teaching is such an important and wonderfully rewarding job and we hope that people from all backgrounds are encouraged to consider it as a career so that we can, hopefully in the near future, see a teaching body that reflects the rich diversity of the population of Ireland. Dr Andrea Lynch: The Access to Post-Primary Teaching (APT) Event & Launch was an exciting and inspiring day for all! Numerous Higher Education students and graduates from under-represented groups graciously shared their stories of overcoming educational barriers, demonstrating that with adequate support, hard-work and determination can pay off in the pursuit of dreams and goals. Additionally, Professor Liz Thomas illustrated the power of Higher Education in changing lives. It is our hope that the post-primary students who participated in our event won't soon forget the great examples they met today, and that the information shared will have truly life changing consequences.

Since 96% of state primary schools in Ireland are denominational, considering religious diversity in teaching is both critically important and a complex undertaking. The study explores the backgrounds, motivations and perspectives on the Irish education system of applicants and entrants to Initial Teacher Education programmes across Ireland. The paper, published this week in the European Journal of Teacher Education, explores the religious backgrounds, religious practice and attitudes towards teaching religion of applicants and entrants to primary teacher education programmes. All three authors of the paper, Dr Manuela Heinz, Dr Kevin Davison and Dr Elaine Keane are lecturers at the School of Education, NUI Galway While there has been much debate about the compatibility of publicly funded denominational schools with growing religious pluralism and secularism in Ireland and internationally, these debates have so far, mostly focused on equity of access to state-run schools and freedom of religion and conscience for children and their families. The position of teachers in a predominantly denominational primary school system has received much less attention in academic and policy discourse. The study interrupts the silence and invisibility of atheist, non-practicing Catholic and minority faith students and practicing teachers, and highlights the need to critically examine teaching and teacher education policy and practice, including access to Initial Teacher Training, the ITE curricular and pedagogical spaces, school cultures and employment legislation, from a social justice perspective that includes a religious diversity dimension. The data gathered suggests low levels of religious practice and religiosity among ITE applicants, many of whom would prefer to teach religion using a non-confessional approach. The study raises critical questions regarding the experiences, constitutional rights and professional practice of increasingly secular and/or non-practicing Catholic teacher cohorts in a predominantly Catholic primary education system that has survived the trend towards the progressive ‘unchurching’ of Europe. Lead author of the study, Dr Manuela Heinz from the School of Education at NUI Galway, said: “Our main data collection method is an anonymous voluntary cross-sectional online questionnaire implemented annually with applicants to all state-funded Initial Teacher Education programmes across Ireland. The diversity in the ITE study addresses the data vacuum with regard to ITE cohorts’ socio-demographic backgrounds in relation to their religious affiliations, religious practice, and attitudes towards religious education in primary schools in Ireland.” Dr Heinz continued, “We noted a high non-response rate (25%) to an open-ended question probing respondents to express their feelings about teaching religion which may indicate that a significant proportion of ITE applicants were reluctant or felt uncomfortable to disclose their personal thoughts regarding the requirement for primary teachers to teach religion in the majority of primary schools in Ireland, even in an anonymous survey. “In addition, we also noted a widespread tendency of complying with, rather than endorsing or rejecting, the teaching of religion with many respondents using language like ‘it’s no problem’, ‘part of the job’, ‘grand’, or ‘doesn’t bother me’ in their responses. It may be that enculturation into Catholic education and possibly positive experiences and memories of ‘no harm’ have led many to uncritically accept the status quo. Or, alternatively, it may be that many of those considering and/or entering the teaching profession feel that they have no choice in the matter, that they need to comply and be prepared to take on the role of religion teacher if they want to succeed, even if they are not religious themselves, do not practice or believe.” Dr Heinz added: “We are hoping that this research will trigger more thinking about the characteristics and qualities we are looking for in teachers. Considering that only 58% per cent of our respondents considered themselves to be ‘a religious person’, we need to ask what about the others? What experiences await them as they pursue careers as primary teachers? In our study, the great majority of respondents indicated a clear preference towards teaching children about different faiths/world views/religions with some respondents stressing the importance of tolerance, equal treatment and/or of children making up their own minds with regard to religious beliefs.” In light of the findings presented in this study, the authors conclude that the prospect and experience of entering a third level learning and future professional space that is permeated by a religious, predominantly Catholic ethos, will cause conflict between personal beliefs and professional requirements for many potential and actual Initial Teacher Education applicants and entrants. This situation will most likely result in some highly motivated and suitable individuals who are atheist, non-practicing Catholics or from a minority religious background deciding against a career in teaching. Those who enter Initial Teacher Education training, despite the considerable religious barriers, may experience significant, and likely unforeseen, difficulties throughout their ITE and professional careers due to tensions between their personal and professional lives. The study suggests that it is time to ask whether it is fair, ethical or moral to put individuals who are committed to the education of our children in this difficult situation. The DITE study was funded by the Irish Research Council and was led by principal investigators Dr Manuela Heinz and Dr Elaine Keane.

The conference takes place on the first anniversary of the publication of Government of Ireland’s National Landscape Strategy 2015-2025, issued as part of its commitments under the European Landscape Convention which Ireland ratified in 2002. Working in association with the Heritage Council of Ireland and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the conference aims to reflect on how values attached to landscape get expressed at local and community level which in turn can be mobilised to shape national and European policy in the future. With 95 papers from 130 international experts, including colleague s from the North America, Japan, China and Australia, the conference will explore innovative ways in which values associated with place are shaped and made. Papers range from landscapes of wellbeing, the material culture of the Galway Hooker, to sustainable food tourism, and there promises to be something of interest to all. Sessions on policy and governance will also highlight new models of spatial planning and decision-making that honour the full suite of values associated with places in which communities live across Europe today. Delegates will also participate in 4 full-day site visits to community-led projects in the west of Ireland, across counties Galway, Mayo, Clare and Offaly as part of the conference programme. UNISCAPE is the European network of universities especially dedicated to the implementation of the European Landscape Convention (Council of Europe, Florence 2000). The aim of its 53 constituent institutions is to support and reinforce interdisciplinary co-operation within and among European universities regarding landscape issues, especially in the areas of research and education. On the importance of hosting the UNISCAPE General Assembly in Ireland, Chairman of the Heritage Council of Ireland, Conor Newman said that: “The presence here of UNISCAPE sends out a strong signal about the role that universities across Europe are playing in the delivery of the European Landscape Convention. UNISCAPE is a key partner of the Council of Europe’s Committee for Culture, Heritage and Landscape. This committee met in Strasbourg last week to sign off on the European Cultural Heritage Strategy for the 21st century, foregrounding the connection between the Landscape Convention and the Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society. This conference is an opportunity to tune in to this wider, international dialogue, to learn from the experience of others, and to showcase the Irish situation.” Responding to the invitation to host the General Assembly and Conference in Ireland this year, Director of UNISCAPE, Professor Bas Pedroli said that ‘We are really looking forward to meeting our international delegates of various disciplinary backgrounds in Galway this summer. The engagement of the Centre for Landscape Studies of the National University of Ireland in Galway promises an excellent working atmosphere both in the university and out on site with the field-visits to community projects in the region. This will certainly enhance a better understanding of the Irish landscape within its own particular parameters while also discussing broader European contexts as well.’ Other events associated with the conference include, a screening of Fís na Fuiseoige, a documentary film exploring the connection between people and place which won Best Cinematography at the San Francisco Earth Day Film Festival and the launch of Gearóid Ó hAllmhúráin’s new work in Irish Music Studies, Flowing Tides: History and Memory in an Irish Soundscape, published by Oxford University Press. The opening night of the conference will also see the launch of Iarsma: Fragments from an Archive, the Artist-in-the-Archive Project at the Tim Robinson Archive now housed in the James Hardiman Library, NUI Galway. Devised by Dr Nessa Cronin at the Centre for Irish Studies, Iarsma is the culmination of the collaborative work of visual artist Deirdre O’Mahony, choreographer Ríonach Ní Néill, and composer Tim Collins. All are welcome to attend the performance at 8pm Wednesday 30 June in the Institute for Lifecourse and Society, NUI Galway.
