Since our last notes, I had the pleasure of spending an afternoon with Gertrude Breen Alfredson at the Weston home of Phyllis Gallinelli Campbell. It was heartwarming to listen to these dear friends catch up on lives, families and other Regis related news. Phyllis hosted a lovely lunch, tea and dessert. More recently, it was a pleasure to chat again with Phyllis when she reminded me “I’m 98 you know! and still living in my home.” She’s grateful for attentive care by family and home care aides who check in on her. In September Gert invited me to join her for lunch at Woodland CC so we could share news about Regis. I told her all about the fabulous Regis on Cape Cod August lunch and the remarkable group of Regis Scholars. Gert had just started a new section of LAARC – the previous day’s topic was the Solar System. And of course, Gert remains the class traveler. In June she enjoyed the Scandinavian cruise, visiting Norway and Copenhagen, stopping first and last in London. In November, it was off again to Lisbon to board a repositioning cruise stopping first at Canary Islands and Madeira before crossing the Atlantic destination St John’s VI before wrapping up in Florida. Gert keeps in touch Eleanor Consentino Feuer, who remains in Atkinson, NH where her 3 sons visit several times a week, and where her grandson and 2 dogs Okie and Asha recently moved into the lower level of Eleanor’s home. “It’s good to have company from time to time,” she advised. Then, she told me all about her newest great grandchild Carter, welcomed by his big brother Jonathan in Wisconsin. From the small world department, Eleanor looks forward to weekly visits of a home care aide who just happens to be a graduate of the Regis/Lowell Hospital program. Rita Rizzo Covelle continues to live independently in Stoneham. To honor 1947 classmate Phyllis Brosnahan Richardson and my Mum, we Richardsons started an annual scholarship for Lexington High graduating seniors. As teacher and mom Phyllis always urged “the girls” to pursue education and career in teaching or nursing. Added joy? When parents of other town scholarship awardees seek me out to say “I remember Mrs. Richardson! She was my math teacher!”\n\nAnd finally, please take a moment to remember another classmate in your prayers – Patricia Morton Donovan who was born into eternal life in February 2023. For years, Patricia lived happily with her husband Victor in Ontario, Canada. It continues to be a pleasure for me to keep up with Regis 1947, women of impact and kindness. Keep happy and healthy. UPDATE. Sadly, right before deadline, I learned that on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving Phyllis Gallinelli Campbell was called to join her husband Joseph in heaven. A remarkable life of volunteering, charity, family, friends and devotion to her beloved Regis College and the Class of 1947. She will be missed.\n\n1948\n\nAnn O'Hare Smith's Daughter, Janet Smith - On a beautiful, sunny day this past May, we, the class of 1948, celebrated our seventy-fifth anniversary of graduation from Regis. We were wined and dined with gusto - music, balloons, and many smiling faces - as we were driven around in golf carts by recent Regis graduates, followed by a delicious luncheon.\n\nIt was a joyous occasion sharing happy memories, laughter, and fun with our classmates: Marie Fisher Lee, Mary Jane Crowley Murray, Jo DeMauro, Jeanne Blackwell Morgan, Barbara Earley Mason (deceased 2024), (and me) Ann O'Hare Smith. A special thanks to all who so kindly made it truly \"a day to remember!\"\n\n1954\n\nPatricia Cronin Huie, Class Reporter - Thank you all for answering my calls. My family tells me that I am relentless, but you are the best source of information and news for the Regis Class of 1954.\n\nRegina Seales Caines thank you for conversing with me while you were visiting with your sister in Rochester, NY. It was great hearing about your family reunion in June at the Punta Cana Resort in the Dominican Republic. Regina flew to Punta Cana with her daughter, and Regina’s son, his wife, and Regina’s grandson flew from California to Punta Cana. Regina’s daughter-in-law’s mother and two sisters also flew to Punta Cana from the Netherlands for the family reunion. It was a wonderful family get-together that took a lot of planning and organization.\n\nMary Roche Sullivan is busy doing her traveling from Waltham, MA to her newly renovated home on the ocean in Scituate, MA. She loves when family members are on vacation and able to visit with her at the beach house.\n\nSandy Sanderson has been residing between East Sandwich and Falmouth, MA. She loves seeing and spending time with her family on the Cape.\n\nNorma McNamara Quinn spends her summers at her home in Saratoga, NY, and her winters in Juno Beach, FL. Norma loves spending time at the Saratoga Horse Races, having lunch, and going to the Performing Arts Center with family and friends.\n\nRita Fichera Fragala resides in North Andover, MA with her husband and they are looking forward to their fall trip in October to their home in Sarasota, FL. It was wonderful catching up with Rita. Thank you for taking the time to converse with me and sharing your appreciation of the Class Notes.\n\nBetty Morrissey Neal, my roommate shared that she loves her lovely retirement home in North Carolina and enjoys playing bridge and having lunch with friends. Betty - it was wonderful talking with you and catching up on everything!\n\nPriscilla Bradford Cronin brought me up to date on the Regis Alumni who visited Pocasset, MA. It was also enjoyable to reminisce about our Regis alumni lunches at Derby Street Shops in Hingham, MA. Priscilla resides in Westwood, MA at Fox Hill Village and has family that live nearby. She enjoys spending time with family during the summer at Pocasset.\n\nJoanne Hickey Johnson, and my daughter Barbara and I were able to share a delightful afternoon at her home in Vero Beach, FL, in April. Joanne shared her plans of moving back to Connecticut for the summer with plans to return to Vero Beach in the winter. I look forward to hearing from Joanne about her Connecticut move.\n\nVivian Lamoureux Duval spends her days with her children and grandchildren at home looking at the “Mount Regis 1954” and other photos of classmates, friends, and family. Her youngest grandchild just graduated from high school and is touring Regis and other colleges. “We are looking forward to attending the 70th reunion in 2024!”\n\nI attended the Regis East Coast Alumni event held at the Palm Beach, FL Yacht Club in March 2023. I met Marie Albiani Buckley’s sister Tish Albiani Carney at the event. Tish told me that Marie was doing well and resides near her in Falmouth, MA.\n\nTo all that I was able to reach – thank you for sharing your special events and family updates with me. I am looking forward to our 70th Reunion in May 2024 to be with you and to see my granddaughter, Elizabeth Stevenson, who graduates from the Regis College Nursing Program. I am very proud to say that Elizabeth will be my 3rd granddaughter to be a Regis College graduate!\n\nAt this time, I have decided to step down from the 1954 Class Reporter role. It has been so wonderful speaking with many of you over the years and hearing about your news and updates. Going forward, please call the alumni office directly at 781-768-7220 or email classnotes@regiscollege.edu to share further updates.\n\nSo, to all – be well and stay safe! Look forward to seeing you in 2024!\n\n– Patricia Cronin Huie '54\n\n1955\n\nJanet Condrey Beyer, Class Reporter\n\nEstelle Ferraro Misto – 90 is not exciting to be entering. For me I will not enter that state until March 2024. For some reason I was admitted to 1st grade because there were some empty seats when I should have entered the following September. You know the nuns would love to fill all the seats! Anyway, as I mentioned before Bridge has been my salvation for keeping my mind working along with the social aspect. I, too, am still driving, and thank God for that. I’m able to stay in my home of 60 years. Many things would have to change if I was unable to drive. That’s probably the same for many of us. I’m not using a walker but I do use a cane to prevent a fall. Wow how things have changed! Always happy to read about our classmates. Stay well. P.S. someone gave me a book to read called the Measure. I’m about halfway thru. My problem is my eyes get heavy when I read and fall asleep!\n\nMary McCarthy Hayes - I still go up to Regis for two classes at the “Life Long Learning Program.” I find it to be very interesting and enjoyable. It was great to be back on the campus after Covid. I also belong to a book club. Presently, we are reading “Tom Lake” by Ann Patchet. I had a fabulous 90th birthday celebration! It was on August 15th. My three daughters took me and seven guests on a limousine ride to La Cuccina Restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island. We enjoyed champagne, games and music of the 50s. It was an amazing experience! Everyone ordered what they wanted for dinner. A beautiful birthday cake was served. Such a day for the memory book!\n\nI’m in touch with Denyse Dunbar Maddaleni. In fact, my daughter Kathy and I visited Denny and Carl in September at the Blackpoint Inn where they joined us for dinner.\n\nI am grateful for the good health, fabulous family and friends that have made my life such a beautiful journey. I wish all 55ers health and peace!\n\nMary McCarthy Hayes on her 90th\n\nMary McCarthy Hayes with Denny (Dunbar) Maddaleni, Carl Maddaleni and her daughter, Kathy.\n\n1956\n\nDear Classmates,\n\nI had intended to send out a class newsletter earlier, but time flies and life happens. As yet I haven’t heard of any more address changes but managed to talk with a few classmates. Carol Settana Scollins is still keeping active at church lecturing, arranging a service at Heritage of Falmouth for those unable to get to Mass and keeping up with her book club. Her grandson was married this summer and Carole is looking forward to a Mississippi River Cruise in November. Speaking of travel, Pat Turner Kelley took a trip to Antarctica – I’m waiting to hear about that! I spoke with Nancy Foley LaDue and Joanne Moloney Fiske. Both, like most of us, stay pretty close to home – Joanne is blessed with a resident chef, her son, who is practicing his culinary skills. Rosemary Porter Lucas still lives in New Bedford and is in her 28th year as a docent at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Sally O’Connell O’Connor can be found in West Concord Mass (usually) with side trips to Cape Cod and to Vermont to renew her friendship with the Menagerie at her daughter’s “farm”. As for me, I keep busy trying to downsize, making frequent trips to Best Buy to learn how to use my new tablet, some volunteering at church, and weekly get together with my quilting friends.\n\nOn a sad note, we have lost three classmates since my last letter. Mary Rose Campbell, Maggie Austin Faneuf, and Carol Bonner Connell. Per usual, Pat Kelley has sent donations from the Sunshine Club to Regis in their memory.\n\nNow to some class business: Back in 2006 at our 50th reunion the Sister John Scholarship was established with the following criteria. 1. Female. 2. Liberal Arts, education, social services. 3. Junior or Senior. 4. 3.0 or higher academic standing. 5. Demonstrated commitment to service and to the Regis Community. Mary Keenan and I recently received the final fiscal report for this scholarship. More than $93,000 has been given to 16 recipients in the past 12-13 years! What a legacy for the class of ’56. Many thanks to Mary Keenan for all her time and efforts in coordinating the scholarship.\n\nTime changes, and as we end one scholarship, I have learned that an endowed scholarship has been established by James Dunn, husband of our late classmate Jane Gallogly Dunn. Jane was a Home Economics major who briefly worked as a dietitian while moving from one post to another and raising 6 children. The criteria for this scholarship reflects the current times – financial need – area of study in the School of Health Sciences especially public health, exercise and an interest in nutrition.\n\nIn my conversations with Carole et al I noticed we are all booklovers – Sally is on a first name basis at her local library, Carole belongs to a book club, Joanne is partial to light mysteries “nothing too deep” – she recommends Lisa Gardiner whose mysteries are located in the Boston area. On my last foray to the library bookstore I found a new author – Carlene O’Connor who has written a delightful series of murder mysteries in Ireland – lots of banter – keeps you guessing. My favorite books are Left Neglected by Lisa Genova (neuroscientist) with a great ending/moral. The Lost and found Bookshop by Susan Wiggs was a delight – light romance-history. And of course I read Lessons in Chemistry!\n\nI hope 2023 has been kind to you – I think we can all attest to the fact that getting old is not easy and definitely not always graceful. I’m grateful that I went to Regis in the 50s where I made good friends – didn’t worry about wildfires, floods, didn’t think about politics and wars breaking out everywhere. We were blessed. Let’s pray for Peace – kindness – tolerance – and especially let’s pray for each other. Please keep in touch – Mary Lou Rawson\n\n1959\n\nAudrey Bowen Criado - Canada will never be the same!! In September, Audrey Bowen Criado, Marilyn Lombardi Nicholas, Kay O'Connor Johnson, and Barbara O'Neil Natale took a Holland America cruise bound for Quebec City to see the Canadian foliage and to reminisce about our good old Regis days. Amazingly, we met a gentleman from Regis University in Denver. What a Small World.\n\nMaureen Palmer - Greetings to all! I recently had a great phone conversation with Ruth Holland Lynch. She recently had adjustments made to her home in Mill Valley, CA so that she can continue residing there comfortably. She often goes to Alaska to visit her daughter. During the summer and fall, some of the 59ers got together for lunch: Gerry Chase, Carol Donovan, Marilyn Lombardi Nicholas, Barbara O’Neil, Audrey Bowen Criado, Liz Russell Bilafer, Janice Canniff McCall, MaryAnne Kennedy Smith, Kay O’Connor Johnson, to name a few. I got a chance to join Brenda Fultz McDonough and a mutual friend of ours from Pembroke. Sounds like a lot of eating out (thank God for Take-out boxes. Brenda Meade Doherty was up from Florida for several weeks this summer and dare I say it….more lunches! Please remember in your prayers our dear classmates who have gone to God: Mary Philbin Gorman (Feb. ‘23), Mary Courtney (April ‘23), and Peggy Nichols, CSJ (Nov. ‘23). Please keep in touch!\n\n1961\n\nJoanne McCarthy Dermont - Short note to let you know that now that the screen actors and writer’s strikes are over my daughter Amber Dermont’s NY Times best-selling book The Starboard Sea is going to proceed to be made into a Netflix TV series by Ben Affleck. I am fairly well waiting for Thanksgiving to visit my son Jared in Greenwich, CT. It will be great to see my grandsons Jasper and Dashiel Dermont and my daughter Amber, who will be coming from Houston, Texas where she is a Professor at Rice University.\n\n1962\n\nDorothy DeNave Rossi - After fifty-plus years of living in the DC suburbs, we have moved to a senior residence in Boulder, CO. Our family really wanted this for us. I fought it the whole way, but it is working out well. AND if your travels take you to CO come to see us. Life is Good.\n\nMaryAlice Bernet Houghton - Considering that we’re in our 80s now, my husband Bill and I are in reasonably good shape. We both retired from our psychiatric practices several years ago, but like a lot of retired folks, we’re busy enough with a variety of interests that we wonder how we ever had time to go to work! Our three children are middle-aged now, and our 6 grandchildren range in age from 10 to 20 years old.\n\n1963\n\nJo Anne Dufort - I am no longer your class reporter. We had our 60th class reunion this year, which was poorly attended. There were a few attendees for the luncheon but none for the dinner. This past year was very sad. My sister, Yvette, and my dog, Zoe, 16 years old, passed away. But on the plus side, I did some traveling to Africa, to Kenya and Tanzania. They were fabulous safaris.\n\n1964\n\nVirginia McNeil Slep, 508-358-2478, virginiaslep@comcast.net\n\nSheila Dineen Queenan, 603-881-8528, saqueenan@comcast.net\n\nThis coming spring, the Class of ’64 will celebrate our 60th reunion! The date is Saturday, June 1, 2024, so please mark your calendar. We hope to see everyone there!! (Wasn’t our 50th reunion just a little while ago?)\n\nHere are some Regis offerings that may interest you. I find each of them a nice way to stay connected to Regis:\n\nRemember Hemetera, the Regis literary magazine? It’s still going strong, and is now online. The Hemetera staff publishes submissions online all during the year, then chooses the best to put into the print edition each spring. You can find all the current offerings at www.hemetera.org.\n\nThe Regis Alumni Book Club meets monthly on a Wednesday evening at 7 pm on Zoom. I first joined a year ago, and I find it a delightful group of intelligent women from all over the country, sharing interesting points of view and ideas, led by the Regis librarian, Jane Peck. There’s no commitment and no charge; you don’t have to attend if you're busy or don’t like that month’s book. Information is available by emailing marsha.johnson@regiscollege.edu.\n\nAnd definitely check out the Lifelong Learning at Regis College (LLARC) program. I’ve been teaching Creative Writing and taking classes in the program since 2009, and I really enjoy the offerings. Many are on Zoom, so you can attend from anywhere. Find out more at www.regiscollege.edu/LLARC.\n\nMary Crane Fahey and her husband John still enjoy their summer home at Lake Winnipesaukee, NH with all their grandchildren visiting. They go to North Hutchinson Island, Florida each winter, where they visit Judy Machaj Susanin who winters nearby at Vero Beach. Mary continues to write and share her poetry, and is hoping for publication of her most recent poem, “Music Uniquely His.” Good luck, Mary!\n\nNobumi (Maria) Matsumura Morishima and her husband continue to spend three months each summer at their summer house in the mountains to get away from the heat in Kobe. Maria watches BBC and CNN on TV and keeps up with all the events here and in Japan, and is hoping for the best for everyone. She wishes her Regis classmates and friends “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and lots of love.”.\n\nMary Carroll Epperlein went to Hawaii last January and to Ireland in October. She and Mary Ann Serra travel to New York City occasionally to attend an opera. This fall, they attended La Boheme and a Spanish opera, Florencia en las Amazonas. Mary is also doing some real estate to keep herself busy, and hopes to see everyone at the reunion in June.\n\nShelley Hackett Phipps stays busy in Tuscon, Arizona: long walks with the dogs, gardening, her book club, and trips to the Southwest, the Midwest, and New England. This past summer had record-breaking heat and drought, and she wrote, “Send water!!” She and her partner look forward to a trip to Costa Rica for bird watching, kayaking, and hiking.\n\nKaren Johnson Celi and her husband John took a 17-day cruise of Eastern Europe on the Danube last spring. They started in Bucharest and Costanza on the Black Sea and went north to Vienna. They happened on the Lipizzaner horses while they were leaving their stables to go to a performance area – an unexpected treat. She and John had a wonderful summer sailing on their boat.\n\nAnisa Shubita Kreitem emailed me in October to say she and her family were safe at their homes in Jerusalem, but I haven’t heard from her since then. She asked for prayers for peace everywhere.\n\nAs for me, Virginia McNeil Slep, I’m still teaching in the LLARC program at Regis, and still serve on their Advisory Board. I was very surprised and honored last May to be named Teacher of the Year. I still write a regular column for the North Reading Transcript, my hometown paper. I enjoy gardening and walking a mile or two every day.\n\nHealth issues seem to be affecting all of us, and I wish all classmates good health. Stay well, Class of ’64, and let me hear from you!\n\n1965\n\n1965 classmates at Regis Memorial Mass in November: Gail Hoffman Burke, Carole Groncki McCarthy, Virginia Flynn Wright, Anne Marie Fontaine Healey.\n\n1965 Home Economics classmates (plus one) enjoying lunch: Anne Marie Healey, Carole McCarthy (chemistry), Barbara Sullivan, Mel Lavenberg, Kathleen Henighan.\n\nAnne Marie Fontaine Healey 1965 revisiting Mount Alvernia High School in Jamaica where she taught as a Regis Lay Apostolate volunteer.\n\n80th Birthday cake at Sagamore Beach.\n\nVenantia Fivawo Malima with 3 of her sons, in Tanzania.\n\nCarol Jewell Hunt. notification from art exhibit\n\nAnne Marie Fontaine Healey, Class Reporter, 54 Stacy Street, Randolph, MA 02368, 617-894-1125, annemariehealey@comcast.net\n\nHappy 80th birthday to us!\n\nWho would have imagined 58 years ago that so many of us would be saying that? A birthday lunch was organized by Carole Groncki McCarthy at the Wayside Inn in October. Classmates present were Janet DeAngelo Nedder, Andrea DeSimone Hallion, Virginia Flynn Wright, Carole, Mary Ellen Lavenberg, Kathleen McCaffrey Ford, and Patricia McCarthy Jacquart. Those of us unable to attend are hoping for another get-together in the spring.\n\nAndrea continues to be a volunteer at visitor services at the Museum of Fine Arts. Ginny remains a driving force in TIARA, the Irish Ancestry group. Ginny also recently welcomed her 14th grandchild, tying with Anne Marie Fontaine Healey in the large family category. Mel, a multiple times Camino pilgrim to Santiago, Spain, regrets she could not walk there this year, but has walked an amazing 1550 miles closer to home this past year. “Once a pilgrim, always a pilgrim.” Mel continues her Spanish language group at the Weston Senior Center. Even though retired, Pat is still very involved with the French Department at Scituate High, which includes planning student trips to France. “Paris is always a good idea.”.\n\nAt the Golden Tower luncheon at Regis in May, Janet shared happy news she had just received. Her granddaughter Victoria, a second-year medical student at Case Western, had just gotten engaged while on a trip to Switzerland.\n\nPatricia Gaumond Kasierski and husband George are looking forward to the April wedding of their grandson Thomas, who will marry the girl he met on their first day of orientation at Trinity University in San Antonio. The couple now live and work in Houston, but are returning to San Antonio for their wedding.\n\nThe Regis Cape lunch in August brought together Katherine Moynihan McGovern, who now divides her time between Florida and Connecticut, Gail Hoffman Burke, who should get an award for coming to multiple Regis events via ferry from her home on Martha’s Vineyard, Sharon Gibbons Reardon, Carole McCarthy, and Anne Marie Healey.\n\nSharon and Tom Reardon celebrated an anniversary on Mackinac Island in Michigan. It was a step back in time with horse-drawn carriages instead of automobiles for transportation on the island. The hotel and food were great, the architecture quaint, and the famous fudge delicious.\n\nCarole Groncki McCarthy and her husband Ken at Regis where they were married 59 years ago.\n\nCarol and Ken McCarthy celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in November with a renewal of vows at a Mass at Pope St. John XXIII Seminary, followed by a family dinner at the Wayside Inn. They also visited the chapel at Regis where their wedding took place.\n\nDespite the sorrow of her husband Jay's passing in April, Carol Jewell Hunt finds herself smiling when reflecting on the many joyful memories that they shared over 63 years. In addition, the family legacy continues as Carol's grandson John represents a third-generation Hunt family member at Boston College. Carol was in four group art exhibits this year, including Heroines of the Abstract Expressionist Era, where her work was displayed among that of many famous women artists.\n\nBarbara Doran Sullivan hosted an 80th birthday party in June, with guests Marie Shatos, Kathleen Henighan, Mel Lavenberg, and Anne Marie Healey. Dessert was a cake that was a feast for the eyes and the taste buds. Kathleen entertained us by singing while playing her ukulele. Marie described a pilgrimage she made to the Holy Land, retracing the journey Jesus took from Capernaum to Jerusalem.\n\nSadly, Marie had a tragic fire several months later that destroyed her house and killed her friend Jackie. Marie has been very active in her church and community in Athol, and her kindness was returned by the support of many friends and neighbors.\n\nAnne Marie Healey traveled to Turkiye and experienced a hot air balloon ride, a genuine Turkish bath experience, many museums and archaeological sites, the wonders of Istanbul, and four days on a yacht in the Mediterranean. She also went to Jamaica and revisited Mount Alvernia High School in Montego Bay, (with a Jamaican alumni group) where she had been a volunteer teacher through the Regis Lay Apostolate program.\n\nThe Regis Memorial Mass, attended by Gail and her husband Walter, Carole, Ginny, and Anne Marie, remembered classmates: Anne Herron Healy, Rosemary Sweeney McLaughlin, Jean Audisio Mantzaris, andPatricia Lamb Pascual\n\nAfter the memorial service, we met with Dr. Gerald Healy (Anne’s husband) and their family. Gerry established the Anne Herron Healy scholarship for Regis students with financial need, with preference given to first-generation female students. To donate, visit: alumni.regiscollege.edu/Healy.\n\nStart planning for our 60th Reunion in 2025!\n\n1966\n\nConstance Alexander Giorgio and Janet Banas Higgins, Class Reporters: Nancy Lewis Hennessey never imagined that she would still be working at this point in her life but she has failed at retirement several times. Three years ago she wrote a book, THE READING COMPREHENSION BLUEPRINT HELPING STUDENTS MAKE MEANING FROM TEXT. This resulted in requests for webinars, podcasts, book studies, and conference presentations. An accompanying activity and practice guide will be published in January 2024. Fortunately she has a co-author who is nowhere near retirement. Her commitment to dyslexia continues and she is currently serving on the North Carolina branch of IDA. Congratulations, Nancy!\n\nSusan Clark Cronin, Connie Alexander Giorgio, Mary McAuliffe and Elaine Falcione Wallace and spouses had dinner together in Hyannis in October, prompted by a Regis 1966 get together in September at the fabulous Cape Cod Bay home of Jane McCarthy Smith. Those attending were Nancy Greene Barry, Eleanor McCarthy Bouvier, Elaine Falcione Wallace, Susan Clark Cronin, Eileen Gaquin Kelley, Mary Lou Collins, Connie Alexander Georgio, Kathy Bailey and Mary McAuliffe. Eleanor McCarthy Bouvier, Nancy Barry, and Susan Clark Cronin, along with Mary McAuliffe, get together on Thursdays for coffee and a chat.\n\nConnie Alexander Giorgio has been busy volunteering at her local public library and welcoming her daughter Suzanne and family to Cape Cod where Suzanne bought a home four miles from Connie and Peter after Suzanne’s recent divorce.\n\nFrancine Bailey Osenton reports that this was a great year to get together with friends. Connie Alexander Giorgio visited in July and Ann Bernson visited in August. Francine herself traveled to Cape Cod in late August to visit Connie and Peter Giorgio. The three of them then traveled to the Jersey Shore for Labor Day weekend with other friends including Carol Batiston O’Connell. Francine concludes that Regis friends are a lifetime of blessings.\n\nNancy Corcoran’s 50th Jubilee as a Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet happened in March of 2020 and then the world locked down! This past May, Nancy did visit Paris, Lyon, Le Pax en Velay and Rome. The highlight of her year has been being asked by the Director of Permanent Deacons in St. Louis to educate the Deacons, their wives, and widows regarding transgender humans and their families. The Missouri Legislature and the Attorney General have chosen to eliminate affirmative care for children who are transgender. Forty families have moved out of MO for that reason. Nancy asks that we support LGBTQIA humans in our area. Connie Alexander Giorgio is IN, Nancy, now that she is the grandmother of Ellie (formerly Andrew)! You go, Nancy!!!\n\nJanet Banas Higgins sends New Year's greetings to everyone. She and Michael continue to enjoy two things in life: family and travels. The past year in February and March, they traveled to New Zealand and Australia. Janet’s biggest achievement on the trip was a three-hour climb with a group of 12 adults to the top of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Cruising Scandinavia was on the calendar for June, which included a favorite spot, the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Finally, in September and October, travels took them to Canada and the eastern seaboard of the United States. At home, in Virginia, they very much enjoy 3 daughters, their spouses, 6 grandchildren and two great grandsons.\n\nEileen Gaquin Kelley had a great summer with lots of family around. Her son and family from Texas were there with her on the Cape. Eileen herself is taking some courses at Cape Cod Community College with the Academy for Lifelong Learning. She is also volunteering at the Dennis Memorial Library every Friday afternoon.\n\nSister M. Ann Christine Flaherty, CSJ was one of two sisters to attend the Golden Tower Luncheon on May 13, 2023. She elates that we are approaching the 100th anniversary of Regis College and the 150th anniversary of the Sisters of St. Joseph. She wants us to be mindful of the early sisters of St. Joseph who founded the college, namely Mother Domitilia and her sisters who thought outside the box!! Sister Ann Christine came to Regis to study in the summer and graduated in 1966.\n\nMary Lou Collins proclaims that it was a good year for travel. She just returned from a Road Scholar trip to Cuba which was fun and intellectually stimulating. For home activities she has been doing volunteer tutoring, she belongs to two book clubs, sees grandchildren, attends exercise classes, and goes to lots of lunches.\n\nCarol Marinelli Auth is still in Westfield, MA helping her son to produce spectrometers despite the sudden passing of his dad and the consequent disappearance of critical engineering knowhow. It is a challenge but since the use of these devices is to analyze exactly the presence of wanted or unwanted substances in the air or in production processes, it is worth the effort She writes that she is a child of nature born of happy childhood wanderings in the lovely Wenham countryside with her fluffy, loving companion Buffy. They are now working on spectrometers used to monitor volcanic activity on Mt. Etna. Felicia, sister to Carole and Linda, is managing her treatment for cancer.\n\nA mini reunion was held on Thursday, Nov. 30 for the class of 1966 at the home of Joanna Rapp Holden. In attendance were Beth Kossuth, Kathy Bailey, Joan O’Leary Foley, Linda and Carol Marinelli and Susan Clark Cronin. The group missed Betsy Burns Griffin, Ann Tracy Guerrero, Beth Lewis Bowen, and Susan Airoldi Kailoch. Unfortunately, Susan lost her husband of more than 50 years on Thanksgiving Day. The attending members of the class could have talked for many more hours.\n\n1967\n\nRosemarie Melloni Dittmer, 93 Altamont Ave., Melrose, MA 02176, 781-665-8172, rmdittom@aol.com\n\nCarolyn Sammartino Moran, 105 Kittredge St.#1, Roslindale, MA 02131, 617-921-5759, cmoran6@comcast.net\n\nThe condolences of the class are offered to the families and friends of the following who have died: Margaret Inness 8-22-2021, of Georgia, who taught in Boston for over 30 years, and was active in Audubon Societies in Georgia, survived by her husband John Galvani; Mary Zoza 4-24-2003, of South Boston, remembered by her sisters, nieces and nephews as an artist, and cat lover; and Margaret Lally Colleran 9-3-2023, of Needham and East Orleans, survived by her husband Paul, 4 children, and 4 grandchildren. Also, we remember Jerome C. Wagner 6-15-2015, husband of Sally Mahoney Wagner, and Leo Chang, PhD 8-31-2022, Professor Emeritus of Political Science. Frances Hogan remembers Dr. Chang as a person who valued her opinions during seminars, and gave her the courage to speak up and share her thoughts. Carolyn Sammartino Moran recalls that when they both lived in Brookline, they drove in a carpool with his son and her daughter who attended the same pre-school. A beloved teacher, and wonderful person! Attending the Cape Cod Luncheon this summer were: Paula Dempsey Beauregard, Marlene Gibbons Wilkey, Carolyn Moran, and Frances Waht Lewis. Paula and her husband also spent time in Florida during several of our coldest days this winter, and continues with her book clubs and craft work. Marlene enjoyed a visit from her son to her new home in Plymouth, and Carolyn enjoyed a visit in Oak Bluffs from her youngest daughter and grandchildren from Genoa, Italy. It was their first visit since 2019. Frances Lewis had a summer visit from her daughter and grandchildren from Brittany, France, and she will again visit them this year. She is chair of the Open Space Committee in Eastham. Patricia McCurry Morley visited Seattle with one of her daughters, and spent other summer time with Don in Maine. She also works on a variety of crafts. Rosemarie Melloni Dittmer continues to do seminars in various schools and churches. Recently, she worked with a parish area team in Boston coordinating a 3 day international retreat with folks coming from various states and countries. Linda Shopes has taught at Goucher College and continues to make periodic visits to family in Connecticut and Massachusetts. She also volunteers at the Catholic Worker House in Baltimore.\n\nMiriam Riley Flecca, mflecca@yahoo.com, continues to gather classmates for lunch and conversation. A cross section of attendees, in no particular order has included: Carolyn Moran, Paula Beauregard, Patti Morley, Rosemarie Dittmer, Carolyn Conway Stack, Cheryl Adkins Boss, Mary McLaughlin, Jane Ryan Wessen, Charlene DeMayo Niles, Margaret Jones Gigante, Rachel Gustina Shea, Marguerite Jones Gigante, Barbara Hunt Madden, Ellen Kearns, Phyllis Carberry Mueller, Patricia Connearney Deveaux, Patricia Driscoll Egan, and others. Contact Mim if you wish to be added to the email list. Among conversations shared at a recent one of those gatherings at the Chateau, Waltham, Jane Wessen celebrated the birth of her first granddaughter, Tessa Jane Wessen born in February to son Chris and his wife Nina, and Barb Madden is a proud first-time grandmother to a grandson. Pam Mueller and Joe were taking a trip to Illinois and Missouri to attend a 50th wedding celebration and visit relatives. They had also enjoyed a Rhine River Cruise with a land tour, and seeing the Passion Play at Oberammergau. Ellen Kearns is now a mediator for labor and employment matters, and was looking forward to a trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and another to the Holy Land in late October. Sally Wagner is retired, has 5 grandchildren from 2 sons, joined Cheryl and others at a Chateau luncheon. She keeps in touch with Rosemary Mark Riley whose husband has also died, and Rosemary now lives in Nevada near her daughter. Martha Donnelly Stay has moved to Georgia near her son and his family, celebrated her 50th anniversary in Florida with her family, and recalls meeting her husband Russ at a Villanova and Regis Glee Club Concert. She has kept in touch with Jack DeMambro, husband of the late Ellen Phalon DeMambro. Paula Murphy Fletcher has moved to El Cajon, CA to be near her son Sam who started a scuba diving business, and she helps. Daughter Bonnie is working as a patent attorney in Washington DC. Paula also plays recorder with a group that meets monthly, and is involved in helping migrants since the border is near and the need great. She misses some things about New England, but not the winter! Charlene Niles and Carolyn Stack share happy grandchildren moments as both have seen the older ones off to college! Charlene and Mike travel between Connecticut where son Michael has 4 sons, and New Hampshire where daughter Michele has a daughter and 2 sons. Carolyn Stack and George spend time on Emerald Isle, NC, and recently spoke with Mary Kenney Burke who also goes there. Congratulations to Janice Settana Bingham, a 2022 recipient of the Archdiocese of Boston Cheverus Award for service to the Church. Janice joins previous honorees from our class: Rose Dittmer 2008, Fran Hogan 2011, Susan Lang Abbott 2013, and Regis '66 alum, Judith Guilfoyle Beatrice 2019. Our thoughts and prayers are with all who have experienced health challenges of their own or those of family members, and know that when we come together and share, the joys are doubled and the sorrows are halved.\n\n1968\n\nTricia Nelson Cross, Class Reporter - Greetings classmates! Thank you Tish Brush for being such a conscientious correspondent, keeping the class connected! Sounds like a busy summer, traveling to make up for lost time during COVID. “Visited Dawn-Marie Driscoll for nine days in the spring, also saw Barbara Bouchard Haggerty. We cruised to Iceland in July, and have returned from a family vacation in Skagen, Denmark. Dawn-Marie Driscoll will arrive in two weeks for a business meeting and sightseeing. Then we go into hibernation! I am officially closing my coaching practice with the end of the calendar year—mixed feelings, but at age 77 it’s time. I handed in the three chapters I have written for a collaboration with colleagues on a leadership book. It is probably my last professional involvement. I got a new knee at the end of last year. It is perfect! It has put me “back in the game! Long walks in the woods behind our house and shopping is once again a joy and not a painful chore. Good for you Tish!!!” Judy Lauch wrote Kate Korzendorfer, Regis CIO, daughter of our late classmate and dear friend Pat Grosz Korzendorfer, and graciously invited us to her home in Adams, MA over the June 10th weekend. We descended upon Kate gradually: Maryanne Burtman, Sandy Diaferio, Mary Beth Cormier, Jeanne Gianturco Jaroszewski, Judy Lauch and Tricia Nelson Cross were joined by Kate's brother, John Korzendorfer, and his daughter, Emily. Such get-togethers are always fun but this was extra special. Kate has transformed her childhood home into a lovely but comfy showcase. Pat must be so proud of her offspring! What a great visit!\n\nMary Beth Cormier caught up to Tricia’s large brood of 6 couples and their 14 children on vacation in Wareham. Thank goodness Mary Beth Govoni Cormier lived in town…so we never got lost! We had to have 2 houses in the woods to accommodate the whole family and had a wonderful week!! Mary Beth and Judy & Bill Lauch also visited on the same day. We were all amazed at how the 9 grandsons have grown. Several of them at or are over 6 feet! A treat for us was having our 2 oldest sons Jay and Jeff and their families from Ohio and California.\n\nIrene “Renie” Shea McGee says, “I just returned from visiting Israel. Fabulous experience. Interesting country, it’s very much like Florida: hot and the Israeli citizens weren’t born there! I’m still Dragon Boat racing. I’d help train a team for a race if students or alums are interested. I have added being a hospital clown to my duties. Also reading to K-3, gigs at nursing homes, local festivals and parades round out the clowning. I added a ukulele music ministry to my Sunday afternoons and do ukulele gigs here and there with 2 different groups and brought my granddaughter Renie. Amazing!!!! Maryanne Skeiber Burtman. “Husband Tim and I were in Florida for January and February this year to get out of the Upstate New York Winter which is always a nice getaway. Last September we traveled to Yellowstone and visited some beautiful and inspiring places in the USA! We started in Badlands National Park and Rapid City, Utah. We got very close to some Bison, fascinating! The trip included Mt. Rushmore, Cody, WY along with Yellowstone, a trip of a lifetime! We ended our trip in Grand Teton National Park with spectacular views of mountains and prairies! Last stop Jackson, WY and a flight home. There's so much to see in this country! I was glad to visit with Regis friends in May and June and look forward to more!” Linda Gaioni Dranchak enjoyed the 55th reunion having had to miss our 50th and so had not seen the campus for many years. The physical improvements were impressive, seeing so many male grads on campus was a bit startling, but it was learning about the massive changes in the academic programs that just blew me away. Regis has survived by changing and addressing some serious societal needs. Husband John and I recently celebrated our 53rd wedding anniversary. Our blessings include daughter Sarah's boys, our three local grandsons, who all play sports. Different sports, age groups, practice days, and different game days, locations and schedules. This requires a detailed spreadsheet and help with driving. Son Mike and children live in Shrewsbury, able to spend time with them. Kate and her husband live in Napa, CA. Sarah and her husband bought a second home just a few miles from us. It is a very busy Airbnb except for those weeks when Kate comes to Maine to work.\n\nSon-in-law Greg, a born and raised California guy, loves Maine and I have hopes that they will retire here. Our world is a bit more limited than it used to be, but we are still grateful for our family, health, and friends.\n\nGrace Previte Meo says, “Seven years into retirement and how the days pass. Peter and I joined the Y and we started in the \"Fit for Life\" program, a great and varied program for physical activity. Great to see Dawn Marie Driscoll who is also in the class! I am also taking a Mediterranean cooking class at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts - lots of fun, introducing new recipes to our menu. After 54 years of marriage, it is about time to have new ideas for dinner menus. Traveling has been minimal except for a trip to Bermuda which was great fun and lovely. My girls live close by so we can attend the grandchildren's games and have drop in visits. I frequently see and Carol Hogan Ford. Not only have Rita, Carol and I been close over the years, our families are also very close. I will be seeing Dr.Gail Gawlinski McGuinness in the next few weeks. Gail has been living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina for several years and retired a few years ago from her position at the American Board of Pediatrics. It seems that book clubs are a key part of retirement and I have enjoyed reading books that my book club recommends - probably books that I would never have considered in the past. All is well with the Meo's. Rita Famiglietti Lash continues to fill time with trips to Pennsylvania (Stephen and family) and DC (Christopher) as well as volunteering and enjoying retirement with friends and family. Grace, Carol Hogan Ford and I got together recently for lunch and it was wonderful to catch up with what’s going on in our respective lives and families. Although we talk often, it was great to be face to face! Also, David and I are celebrating our son, Stephen’s recently earned PhD in engineering. After juggling a full time job, two small kids, and all that goes along with that, he successfully defended his dissertation in August. Congratulation David!! Very Proud parents!!\n\nTo my fellow classmates, I have enjoyed my role as '68 Class Reporter. Thank you for filling in with news and family stories. I truly enjoyed these past years. Burt and I are looking forward to our 40th Anniversary and enjoying our children and friends in Rhode Island! It is a thrill to see them off to colleges and how well they have matured! Burt and I are blessed. Warm regards to all and proud to be a Regis Grad!!! - Tricia Nelson Cross ‘68\n\nMarlena Belviso Santomero - Since our retirement, my husband Tony and I have been happy travelers! Our most recent adventure was to Croatia via a small ship cruise. The Dalmatian Coast is lovely, and we enjoyed both the cuisine and the culture to be found in Dubrovnik, Split, and Montenegro.\n\n1969\n\nLeigh Alogna Duff - In 2013, we moved to Juno Beach, Florida from Miami Beach. Prior to that we lived in Southern California, Northern California, the Washington D.C. area (McLean, Virginia), and Manhattan. It would be wonderful to connect with any Regis classmates who are also living in Palm Beach County.\n\n1971\n\nAfter a long hiatus, we are back! Our class celebrated our 50th reunion in the midst of Covid, but ever determined as we have always been, some of us from Angela Hall (first floor back and fourth floor -yay!) gathered at my home (Chris Fregosi Beagan) for a lunch. Recreating our Regis bonds were: Beth Callahan Hines, Margo Sullivan Delaney, Mary Ann Wolflein Sarbanis, Susan Effgen Gately, Carol Wilson Gallagher, Nancy Kern Haley, Pat Gillson Whitehead, Janet Sullivan McDermott, MJ Curtin May, Ellen Byrne, Ann Kirby, and Pat Funder. The conversation and laughter never stopped, and we set a goal to try to meet once a year.\n\nLast year we planned a trip to the Berkshires and stayed at an Air BnB. Those of us able to attend were: Pat Gillson Whitehead, Carol Wilson Gallagher, Susan Effgen Gately, MJ Curtin May, and myself. It truly was a wonderful trip and a great chance to catch up. Fifty plus years disappeared. This year, some of us were able to meet for lunch in Lynnfield: MJ., Carol, MaryAnn Wolflein Sarbanis, Sue, and I were able to meet up in October. We hope to continue these yearly meetings and hope that more of us can attend despite our still busy schedules. Whether caring for family and grandchildren, volunteering at food pantries, tutoring, working with senior citizens, our class' commitment to service continues. Barbara Quatrocchi Morell continues to inspire students at St. Joseph University in New York, where she is a Professor and Chair of the Criminal Justice Program. Barbara has an interest in Restorative Justice and has planned and taken trips to South Africa, just one of many of her contributions to her students and St. Joseph University.\n\nPat Gillson Whitehead retired from the Holmstead School in New Jersey as the Head of School after a long and dedicated career. She now sits on the Board there, Sue Effgen Gately has been volunteering through the Unitarian Church and has been involved with a family of Afghan refugees, tutoring the nine and ten year old children, and helping the family find housing, And good news: the family just recently moved into a permanent home in Newburyport.\n\nWe remember our classmates who have passed this year, Mary Barry, Nancy Culotta Collins, Janet Sullivan McDermott, and Ann McDermott Miller. We miss them, and we wish their families peace. Please send me any news you would like to share at hcbeagan@gmail.com. Peace in the new year.

Read it here: https://blog.terc.edu/nadine-bonda-tercs-new-board-of-trustees-chair\n\nMary Jane Curtin May - On October 12 Chris Fregosi Beagan, Carol Wilson Gallagher, Maryann Wolflein Sarbanis, Sue Effgen Gately, and I (MJ Curtin May) met for lunch at Market Street in Lynnfield. It was a wonderful afternoon with friends. Some of us met for a Stockbridge getaway last year with Pat Gilson Whitehead, and are planning a spring trip to Connecticut.\n\n1972\n\nAudrey (AJ) Volckmann Leonard, Class Reporter - In the past year, I completed my visit to all 50 states! Hawaii was the last one, and what a thrill to check that off my bucket list! It only took 73 years! Jack and I recently celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary, and traveled to Charleston, SC to celebrate. It was our first time in Charleston, and we loved it! We also welcomed our 8th grandchild into the Leonard clan! I just can't get rid of the Pack 'N Play and high chair yet!! I've kept in touch with several classmates via Facebook, which has been great to see all those wonderful ladies! I'm already looking forward to our next reunion! I'm enjoying retirement, doing a lot of babysitting, since all 8 grandchildren are age 7 and under! What a wonderful time of our lives...many of us have retired, are enjoying our children/grandchildren, taking classes, traveling, and making new memories! I hope you all are well! Cheers from Highland Park, Illinois!\n\n1973\n\nMeg Kenah Holsey - Hi Classmates, John & I love to travel..just came home from France🇾🇪 again! OOH LA LA The countryside is beautiful & so are the VINEYARDS 🍷🥂🍾. Hope all is well with you! Air Hugs & Kisses.\n\nCherylAnn Welch - I have been very busy this year. I'm president of the Belmont Dramatic Club. We do two shows per year. Our first this past April was Ken Ludwig's \"Baskerville\". This zany piece had Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and three immensely talented folks who played over thirty roles! Costuming, set pieces and props kept stage hands busy while I called cues. This Fall we are mounting Man of LaMancha. Fifteen very talented folks will each take on two or three roles as Cervantes tells the story of Don Quixote de la Mancha. The prison is the set. The costumes are period and there are helmets galore. I'm also a trustee for my condo association and facilitate a monthly Gathering for other retirees from Somerville. I attended my 50th reunion this year. I had a fantastic time.\n\nElizabeth (Liz) Johnson - I retired in 2017 and have been relaxing into it — so many projects that aren’t quite proceeding as planned! Last year we moved from our dream house in the woods to Richmond VA, partly to be closer to healthcare (I had a very minor stroke three years ago) but mostly to be closer to my siblings, 4 of whom are also here. I’ve joined a chorale, volunteered at a food bank, and been accepted as a poll worker. In May I went to my first-ever reunion and now I deeply regret blowing off all the others. In June I went with my sister and two friends on a pilgrimage from Winchester to Canterbury — what an amazing route; England is slowly restoring the traditional pilgrim routes. Bob is easing out of his freelance work, which gives him time to travel, so in November we crossed an item off his to-do list: a cruise of the Galapagos. It was an astonishing ten days (I was charged by a tortoise), but it did cut into family Thanksgiving: a week on the Outer Banks with 40 people! We continue with our living history group, even though 15 years ago I told Bob that I couldn’t visualize continuing past 70. There’s still so much to learn and try that now I can’t visualize stopping.\n\n1974\n\nGrace Murphy, Class Reporter - 6 Colony Rd., Lexington, MA 02420, 781-861-3914\n\nCongratulations to Elizabeth Frawley Bagley on being named U.S. Ambassador to Brazil. She was sworn in in January 2023 by Vice President Kamala Harris. Elizabeth has had a long and distinguished career in the State Department. In fact, this is her second stint as Ambassador, having served as Ambassador to Portugal during the Clinton administration.\n\nCondolences to Debbie Mann-MacDonald on the unexpected passing of her husband Bob, in May 2023.\n\nKathy Mason Podoski escorted her mother, Barbara E. Mason, Regis '48, to her 75th Regis reunion. (Yes, you read that right - her 75th reunion)!\n\nThat provides me with a great segue to remind everyone that our 50th reunion is fast approaching. It is a significant milestone and we are hoping for a high turnout. Please clear your calendars for 5/31-6/1. It promises to be a fun weekend. If you have not been on campus for a while - perhaps not since our own graduation - it would be the perfect time to see the many changes on campus. And, of course, it will be great to reconnect with classmates that you have not seen in a while.\n\nOur success in achieving a high attendance rate starts with having accurate contact information for everyone, especially e-mail addresses and phone numbers. If you believe that your information needs updating, please contact the Alumni office at alumni@regiscollege.edu. You can also make updates directly on the website: https://alumni.regiscollege.edu/updateinfo. Here’s hoping for a great turnout!\n\nElise Simard Gebhardt - My husband and I retired after working 45+ years in our own business and decided to move to Colorado to be closer to our two grandchildren. We love it in Denver and especially how active most people are hiking, biking, golfing, and skiing. We have always had a ski home in Steamboat and recently upgraded to a larger unit. Our grandchildren are 5 and 7 and love skiing also. I am fortunate to still have my parents alive and active at 93 and 91. We do return to the Boston area quite often for family events. But we do not miss the humidity! If you are in the Denver area, please get in touch: elisegebhardt1@gmail.com.\n\n1975\n\nJanet Arigo Dygert and Don, St. John, USVI.\n\nCathy Grealy Cohen and family.\n\nClass of 1975 at the Wychemere Beach Club.\n\nJanet Arigo Dygert, Class Reporter: Happy New Year to the Class of ’75. And, Happy 70th Birthday, as I’m sure most of us have passed that milestone in the past year. Don and I had another successful year of retirement. A surprise 70th for me in March, NYC in May, cruise to Bermuda in June, summer on Cape Cod, then 2 weeks in paradise on St. John, USVI in fall. Still staying active with golf, cooking, gardening, Crossfit and a few 5Ks.\n\nI met Cathy Grealy Cohen for lunch during her annual Cape Cod vacation. Cathy also had a big party in DC for her 70th birthday and her 3 children and two grand children came from around the country. She enjoyed a brief retirement learning pickle-ball, mahjong and needlepoint, but it wasn’t enough so she formed an LLC to assist disruptive health technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and remote monitoring devices with payment challenges.\n\nMary Ann Dellea Cronin and her husband spent much of the year doing an extensive home renovation, which required them to live outside of their home for 4+ months. Once back in, there were many more months of fine-tuning, but they are now more or less back to normal. They enjoyed spending Christmas back in their home! Mary Ann’s husband’s health is up and down, but up at the moment, for which she is grateful. Her daughter is doing well and Mary Ann is still working part-time doing social work. She enjoyed seeing so many Regis alumnae at both the Cape Cod luncheon in August and the gala in October. She’s looking forward to more gatherings in the coming year and sends the best to all of her classmates. Wish you all a happy and healthy year.
