        "text": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has had a backroom reshuffle at Manchester United.\n\nUnited boss Solskjaer’s long time assistant Mark Dempsey has stepped back from first team duties to a role with the academy.\n\nDempsey, 56, is one of Solskjaer’s most tried and trusted lieutenants after working with him at Cardiff and Molde and also made headlines after falling ill during the club’s tour to Australia in 2019 when he was off work for a couple of months.\n\nUnited’s first team staff has been heavy with four assistants and three goalkeeping staff so maybe this is way of trimming down.\n\nBut it was noticeable to those in the know that Solskjaer seemed to be talking to Mike Phelan on the touchline during last weekend’s Manchester derby far more than in recent times and maybe he is going down a tried and trusted route.\n\nThe pressure never leaves Solskjaer but while United are still in the title race - and they really are - and in top four contention, then it is hard to see the hierarchy taking action.\n\nMauricio Pochettino is the obvious replacement and he is biding his time for United - but cannot wait forever.\n\nEverton have also had a mini reshuffle with David Unsworth, Joel Waldron, Leighton Baines and John Ebbrell all firmly part of the furniture.\n\nUnsworth will combine being Academy director and an under-23 coach, Baines is expanding to be a professional phase development coach for 18s-23s and young first team players. Ebbrell is head of academy coaching and also an u-23s assistant.\n\n==============\n\nGareth Southgate has long been concerned about a lack of opportunities for English players in the Premier League.\n\nBut the outlook is even worse for English managers in the top flight - and the statistics from the top five leagues over the last ten years reveals the Prem is the worst in Europe at giving homegrown bosses a chance.\n\nDetailed analysis by RunRepeat from 877 different managerial spells in 18,260 leagues game in the Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and Serie A shows that English bosses took charge of just 27 per cent of games.\n\nSerie A is at the opposite end of the scale with Italian managers taking charge of 87 per cent of league games. The Premier League is also the most diverse with managers from 22 different nations during that time while Italy recruited from just 12.\n\nThe report’s author, Vyom Chaudhary, said: “Our analysis proves the old adage that the local managerial talent is not given enough opportunities in the Premier League.\n\n“English managers managed only 27 per cent of all games during the last decade - lowest representation of domestic managerial talent among five leagues by a considerable margin. A total of 29 English managers worked 46 different jobs.\n\n“It’s quite obvious from the above numbers that Premier League clubs are more diverse in their approach when it comes to hiring managers. However, the local managerial talent is given less preference in the Premier League as compared to the other leagues.”\n\nAt least Sam Allardyce getting another chance at West Brom might lift the figures slightly…\n\nFull report here.\n\n==============\n\nTottenham, like many clubs, have security software which flags up any “profanity or credit card information” contained in emails.\n\nIronically, an email from an anti discrimination group to a director at the club containing the word “yid” was blocked as it was deemed to be a profanity.\n\nSeveral pressure groups, including the Action Against Discrimination, are calling for the said word to be banned by Tottenham as it is deeply offensive among some Jewish fans.\n\nTottenham are listening and consulting with their fans - and now even their own software has flagged it up as being a “profanity.”\n\n================\n\nThe timing of West Brom’s decision to sack Slaven Bilic to bring in Sam Allardyce is perhaps the most baffling part of the first Premier League managerial change of the season.\n\nHowever, one theory could be that there is serious interest in the club and it has already been reported that majority shareholder Guochuan Lai has held talks with interested parties.\n\nHaving not backed Bilic in the last transfer window, the writing was on the wall but a Premier League club is a much more attractive proposition than buying a Championship team.\n\nWest Brom blocked some media organisations from attending Allardyce’s virtual unveiling because they were critical of the club. The notion they would not get criticised for sacking a manager who got them promoted and a draw at Manchester City …\n\n==============\n\nBarcelona legend Eric Abidal has sent a wonderful message of support to Norwich youngster Shae Hutchinson after the 20-year-old underwent a kidney transplant.\n\nHutchinson, 20, suffers from a hereditary condition called Alport Syndrome, and is recovering after a second operation.\n\nBut Abidal did his best to lift Hutchinson’s spirits with a social media post: “The road is long and patience will be the key word. Always think positive because that’s 50 percent of the victory. Strength and courage to you Shae.”\n\nFormer France star Abidal, who won 13 trophies during a glorious career at Barcelona, underwent a liver transplant in April 2012 after a tumour was found a year earlier and he recovered to play again."
