        "text": "USMNT defender Tim Ream has completed his move to Charlotte FC from Fulham.\n\nThe Athletic reported on Monday Ream was travelling to the United States to undergo a medical, with talks between Charlotte and Fulham having been at an advanced stage for some time.\n\nReam had a year remaining on his Fulham contract having signed an extension in December 2023. But sources with knowledge of the deal have informed The Athletic his move to Charlotte is a free transfer, with Fulham agreeing to let him go following his years of service to the club.\n\nReam has signed a contract through to 2026 with an option until 2027. He will be eligible to play Charlotte’s next match against New York Red Bulls on August 24.\n\n“I’m really excited to join Charlotte FC and return to the US for this next chapter of my career,” said Ream. “In all my conversations with the people around the club, it was clear this organisation and city were the right places for my family and I to continue our journey.\n\n“I’m here to win, and I’m looking forward to getting to know the team as we prepare for a key stretch of matches that will propel us toward the playoffs as we fight for our first trophy.”\n\nOn Sunday, Fulham confirmed the €6.3million signing of Villarreal central defender Jorge Cuenca, paving the way for Ream to depart.\n\nReam did not travel with the Fulham squad for their pre-season trip to Portugal last week while negotiations continued.\n\nHis move to Charlotte ends his nine-year stay at Fulham and sees him return to Major League Soccer (MLS) for the first time since 2011, having spent two years at New York Red Bulls before moving to England.\n\nReam joined Fulham from Bolton Wanderers in 2015 and made 312 appearances during his nine years with the club.\n\nHe played an important role as Fulham were promoted back to the Premier League in 2021-22 and helped them re-establish themselves in the top flight the following season.\n\nThe 36-year-old defender enjoyed a late-career renaissance under Fulham coach Marco Silva, and his form ensured a place in the USMNT squad for the World Cup in 2022 as well as this summer’s Copa America.\n\n“When I walked through the Motspur Park doors in 2015, I would have never predicted what the following nine years would bring,” Ream added. “The memories made, the connections formed, and the people met along the way have made my time at Fulham more than special.\n\n“I wish I could thank everyone individually for the part they played in shaping me as player, but more as a person. For all of that, I am beyond grateful.\n\n“As of today, I am no longer a player, but I will always be a fan of Fulham Football Club.”\n\nReam was a regular in the Fulham team during the first half of last season, captaining the side in 12 of their first 13 Premier League matches.\n\nHowever, he was sidelined with a calf injury in December and featured just five times in the league during the second half of the campaign, with Tosin Adarabioyo and Calvin Bassey Marco Silva’s preferred central defensive partnership.\n\nCharlotte are coached by former Brentford, Norwich and Aston Villa manager Dean Smith. They are sixth in the Eastern Conference 25 games into the regular season and have the second-best defensive record in the division.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nTim Ream - the USMNT defender who is relatable, resilient and a rock for Fulham\n\nFulham bid farewell to leader Ream in changing of defensive guard\n\nThe departure of Tim Ream marks the end of an era for Fulham.\n\nIn their Premier League years, the west London club have regularly welcomed American representation. From the first in Marcus Hahnemann in 1999 to the exploits of Brian McBride and Clint Dempsey in the Mohamed Al Fayed years, there has always been a USMNT connection.\n\nOf those, Ream stands among the modern greats.\n\nThe Missouri native made his 300th appearance for the club last season, a milestone nine seasons in the making. He was the first player to reach that mark for the club since Simon Morgan 26 years ago. Morgan played for the club in the 1990s, adapting and thriving to play for the club across difficult years and then kept his place as the team rose through the leagues.\n\nReam has previously spoken about how a player wants to make a mark when they sign for a new club, without necessarily thinking about time or accumulating appearances. The central defender has not always been a first choice but that has not changed his character and that sticks with supporters. He has enjoyed standout moments — the two play-off finals, a Championship title under Marco Silva and then his Premier League rejuvenation.\n\nBut his off-field influence has resonated too, becoming a leader by example and an ambassador for the club away from the pitch.\n\nHis presence will be sorely missed. For Fulham, there will be a changing of the guard, with his most recent defensive partner, Tosin Adarabioyo, also departing this summer.\n\n(Hector Vivas/Getty Images)"
