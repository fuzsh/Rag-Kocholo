However, UCD continued to battle until the final whistle sounded, closing the deficit to six points at full-time. A man of the match performance from Darragh Canavan, with significant contributions from brother Ruairí, ultimately sealed the competition for the Belfast side.\n\nIn this year’s Electric Ireland GAA Higher Education Rising Stars 2024 Football Team of the Year, Sigerson Cup Champions, UU, have seven players included on the team. Beaten finalists UCD have five representatives on the team. Beaten semi-finalists, University of Limerick (UL) feature twice on the team while Maynooth University have a single player included.\n\n2024 Electric Ireland GAA Higher Education Rising Stars Football Team of the Year\n\n1.
