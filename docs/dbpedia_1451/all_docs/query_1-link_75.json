        "text": "New Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has added former Red Devils youth coach Mark Dempsey to his backroom staff at Old Trafford.\n\nDempsey worked alongside Solskjaer during his eight months in charge of Cardiff City back in 2014, before briefly assisting him at Molde.\n\nThe 54-year-old then had a brief spell in charge of Norwegian club Start before taking the reins at Kongsvinger in June, where he remained for five months.\n\nDempsey moved back to England in November and was contacted by Solskjaer after the Norwegian was given the role of temporary Man United boss following Jose Mourinho's sacking.\n\nDempsey started his career in football as a player at Manchester United back in 1982, where he made two appearances under Ron Atkinson.\n\nAfter his playing career ended he took on a development coaching role at the club before moving to Norway, and later to join Solskjaer in Wales.\n\nDempsey was highly thought of by none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, who referenced his hard work back in 2008.\n\nFerguson said: \"Les [Kershaw] was followed by people like Jim Ryan, Brian McClair - who's now academy director - Dave Bushell, Mark Dempsey, Tony Whelan, Paul McGuinness.\n\n\"These guys have been here for over 15 years, so when I go I would presume all these lads would still be in place and working hard for United.\"\n\nDempsey follows Mike Phelan back through the door at Manchester United, who returned to the Red Devils' coaching staff last week.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Carrick, Kieran McKenna and goalkeeping coach Emilio Alvarez have all been retained by the new United boss."
