Roosevelt praised \"Irish Presbyterians\" as \"a bold and hardy race.\"[103] However, he is also the man who said: \"But a hyphenated American is not an American at all.

Shunned by Henry II, he offered his services as a mercenary in the 12th-century invasion of Wexford in exchange for power and land. He would die from a festering ulcer in his foot, which his enemies said was the revenge of Irish saints whose shrines he had violated.
