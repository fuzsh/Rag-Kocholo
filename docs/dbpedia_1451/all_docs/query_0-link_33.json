        "text": "George Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (née Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.\n\nAfter his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979); Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988); and Detective James Falconer on Ein Strauß Töchter (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies.\n\nWhile filming \"ER\" (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), and Tage wie dieser... (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Clooney took on the role of Batman in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997). The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Batsuit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh's Out of Sight (1998), Terrence Malick's Der schmale Grat (1998), and David O. Russell's Three Kings - Es ist schön König zu sein (1999).\n\nIn 1999, Clooney left \"ER\" (1994) (though he would return for the season finale) and appeared in a number of films, including O Brother, Where Art Thou? - Eine Mississippi-Odyssee (2000), Der Sturm (2000) and Ocean's Eleven (2001). Collaborating once again with Steven Soderbergh, Ocean's Eleven (2001) received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels: Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's 13 (2007).\n\nIn 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with Geständnisse - Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), an adaptation of TV producer Chuck Barris' autobiography. This was the first film under the banner of Section Eight Productions, a production company he founded with Steven Soderbergh. The company also produced many acclaimed films, including Dem Himmel so fern (2002), Syriana (2005), A Scanner Darkly - Der dunkle Schirm (2006) and Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005). Clooney won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Syriana (2005), and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005).\n\nIn 2006, Section Eight Productions was shut down so that Soderbergh could concentrate on directing, and Clooney founded a new production company, Smokehouse Productions, with his friend and longtime business partner, Grant Heslov.\n\nClooney went on to produce and star in Michael Clayton (2007) (which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor), directed and starred in Ein verlockendes Spiel (2008), and took leading roles in Burn After Reading (2008), Männer, die auf Ziegen starren (2009), Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009), and Jason Reitman's Up in the Air (2009). Clooney received critical acclaim for his performance in Up in the Air (2009) and was nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award. He didn't win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lays in a coma in Alexander Payne's The Descendants - Familie und andere Angelegenheiten (2011). Through his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the Hope for Haiti telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake. In March 2012, Clooney was arrested for civil disobedience while protesting at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nClooney was married to actress Talia Balsam, from 1989 until 1993. After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again. Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman bet him $10,000 that he would have children by the age of 40, and sent him a check shortly after his birthday. Clooney returned the funds and bet double or nothing he wouldn't have children by the age of 50. Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler. In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney, with whom he has two children, twins.\n\nJohn Christopher \"Johnny\" Depp II was born on June 9, 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, to Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells), a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer. He was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. When he married Lori A. Depp, he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film, Nightmare - Mörderische Träume (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.\n\nIn 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street: Tatort Klassenzimmer (1987). In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward mit den Scherenhänden (1990). Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Angst und Schrecken in Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut's Wife - Das Böse hat ein neues Gesicht (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.\n\nDepp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez's \"mariachi\" trilogy, Irgendwann in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Fluch der Karibik (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Das geheime Fenster (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Wenn Träume fliegen lernen (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine - Sex, Drugs & Rococo (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie und die Schokoladenfabrik (2005), and later in Alice im Wunderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012).\n\nOff-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with his former long-time partner, French singer/actress Vanessa Paradis: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and John Christopher \"Jack\" III, born in 2002. He married actress/producer Amber Heard in 2015, divorcing a few years later.\n\nIn 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.\n\nTom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.\n\nWith handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); Die Farbe des Geldes (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview mit einem Vampir (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Tom Cruise's biggest franchise, Mission Impossible, has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing, with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nIn 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.\n\nElegant Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were there on educational visas.\n\nKidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor, and Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite 40 Grad im Schatten (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in Die BMX-Bande (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Todesstille (1989).\n\nKidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Tage des Donners (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting - Spiel mit der Liebe (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate (1991). She reunited with Cruise for In einem fernen Land (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger Mein Leben für dich (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant's To Die For (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James's Portrait of a Lady (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in Projekt: Peacemaker (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.\n\nShe and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's rumored homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.\n\nClinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (née Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he is said to have graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Die Rache des Ungeheuers (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Tausend Meilen Staub (1959) with Eric Fleming. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.\n\nEastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: Für eine Handvoll Dollar (1964), Für ein paar Dollar mehr (1965), and Zwei glorreiche Halunken (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice of Eastwood's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, Hängt ihn höher (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogans großer Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series Ein Sheriff in New York (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Agenten sterben einsam (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Westwärts zieht der Wind (1969). In Ein Fressen für die Geier (1970) and Stoßtrupp Gold (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.\n\n1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in Betrogen (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Sadistico (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Sinola (1972), Ein Fremder ohne Namen (1973) and Der Texaner (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Calahan (1973) and Dirty Harry III - Der Unerbittliche (1976), the action-packed road adventures Die Letzten beißen die Hunde (1974) and Der Mann, der niemals aufgibt (1977), and the prison film Flucht von Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Der Mann aus San Fernando (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, Im Auftrag des Drachen (1975) notwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.\n\nEastwood kicked off the 1980s with Mit Vollgas nach San Fernando (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Dirty Harry IV - Dirty Harry kommt zurück (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \"Make my day.\" He also starred in Bronco billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Der Wolf hetzt die Meute (1984), City Heat - Der Bulle und der Schnüffler (1984), Pale Rider - Der namenlose Reiter (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, Das Todesspiel (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and Rookie - Der Anfänger (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing Weißer Jäger, schwarzes Herz (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).\n\nEastwood bounced back big time with his dark western Erbarmungslos (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire: Die zweite Chance (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next was a love story, Die Brücken am Fluss (1995), where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while Ein wahres Verbrechen (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.\n\nEastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Back in the Game (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012).\n\nBetween acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Der fremde Sohn (2008) (a vehicle for Angelina Jolie), Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter - Das Leben danach (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and 15:17 to Paris (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in The Mule (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed Der Fall Richard Jewell (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of Cry Macho (2021).\n\nAway from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.\n\nHis known children are: Laurie Murray (b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified; Kimber Eastwood (b. 1964) with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. 1972) with his first ex-wife, Margaret Neville Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. 1993) with actress Frances Fisher; and Morgan Eastwood (b. 1996) with his second ex-wife, Dina Eastwood. The entire time that he lived with Locke she was legally married to sculptor Gordon Anderson.\n\nEastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, La Quinta, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in remote northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.\n\nAlec Baldwin is the oldest, and best-known, of the four Baldwin brothers in the acting business (the others are Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin and Daniel Baldwin). Alexander Rae Baldwin III was born on April 3, 1958 in Massapequa, New York, the son of Carol Newcomb (Martineau) and Alexander Rae Baldwin Jr., a high school teacher and football coach at Massapequa High School. He is of Irish, as well as English, French, Scottish, and German, descent.\n\nAlec Baldwin burst onto the TV scene in the early 1980s with appearances on several series, including The Doctors (1963) and Unter der Sonne Kaliforniens (1979), before scoring feature film roles in Für immer Lulu (1986), Beetlejuice (1988), Die Waffen der Frauen (1988), Die Mafiosi-Braut (1988) and Talk Radio (1988). In 1990, Baldwin appeared in the first on-screen adaptation of the \"Jack Ryan\" character created by mega-selling espionage author, Tom Clancy. The film, Jagd auf Roter Oktober (1990), was a box office and critical success, with Baldwin appearing alongside icy Sean Connery. Unfortunately, Baldwin fell out with Paramount Studios over future scripts for \"Jack Ryan\", and subsequent Ryan roles went to Harrison Ford.\n\nBaldwin instead went to Broadway to perform \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", garnering a Tony nomination for his portrayal of \"Stanley Kowalski\" (he would reprise the role in a 1995 TV adaptation). Baldwin won over critics as a lowlife thief pursued by dogged cop Fred Ward in Miami Blues (1990), met his future wife Kim Basinger while filming the Neil Simon comedy, Die blonde Versuchung (1991), starred in the film adaptation of the play, Bodyswitch - Verhexte Küsse (1992) (in which he starred off-Broadway), and made an indelible ten-minute cameo as a hard-nosed real estate executive laying down the law in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He also made a similar tour-de-force monologue in the thriller, Malice - Eine Intrige (1993), as a doctor defending his practices, in which he stated, \"Let me tell you something: I am God\".\n\nDemand for Baldwin's talents in the 1990s saw more scripts swiftly come his way, and he starred alongside his then-wife, Kim Basinger, in a remake of the Steve McQueen action flick, Getaway (1994), brought to life the famous comic strip character, Shadow und der Fluch des Khan (1994), and starred as an assistant district attorney in the civil rights drama, Das Attentat (1996). Baldwin's distinctive vocal talents then saw him voice US-aired episodes of the highly popular UK children's show, Thomas und seine Freunde (1984), plus later voice-only contributions to other animated/children's shows, including Clerks - Die Ladenhüter (2000), Cats & Dogs - Wie Hund und Katz' (2001), Final Fantasy - Die Mächte in dir (2001) and Der SpongeBob Schwammkopf Film (2004).\n\nIn the early 2000s, Baldwin and Basinger endured an acrimonious break-up that quickly became tabloid fodder but, while his divorce was high-profile, Baldwin excelled in a number of lower-profile supporting roles in a variety of films, including State and Main (2000), Pearl Harbor (2001), The Cooler - Alles auf Liebe (2003) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor), Aviator (2004), ...und dann kam Polly (2004) and Departed: Unter Feinden (2006). As he was excelling as a consummate character actor, Baldwin found a second career in television comedy. Already known for his comedic turns hosting Saturday Night Live (1975), he essayed an extended guest role on Will & Grace (1998) in 2005 before taking on what would arguably become his most famous role, that of network executive \"Jack Donaghy\", opposite Tina Fey in the highly-acclaimed sitcom, 30 Rock (2006). The role brought Baldwin two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, and an unprecedented six Screen Actors Guild Awards (not including cast wins).\n\nContinuing to appear in films as 30 Rock (2006) wrapped up its final season, Baldwin was engaged in 2012 to wed Hilaria Baldwin (aka Hilaria Lynn Thomas); the couple married on June 30, 2012.\n\nWilliam Baldwin has distinguished himself as an actor/producer/writer who continues to showcase his multitude of talents in the world of film and television.\n\nBaldwin has a busy year ahead starring in several high-profile upcoming projects. He is currently travelling the world shooting back-to-back productions - most recently wrapping his recurring role opposite Miles Teller in Nicolas Winding Refn's highly-anticipated upcoming Amazon series \"Too Old to Die Young.\"\n\nHe is about to begin production in Canada starring in & executive producing the new Netflix / CBC family drama \"Northern Rescue\" opposite Kathleen Robertson. After the death of his wife, John West (Baldwin) packs up his three children and moves from their hectic urban life to his small northern hometown to take command of the local search-and-rescue service. Once there, the family struggles with their new surroundings, new friends and accepting Sarah's death.\n\nAdditionally, Baldwin will reprise his role as Brian McCaffrey from the 1991 blockbuster \"Backdraft\" in the Universal / Netflix sequel \"Backdraft 2,\" along with Donald Sutherland. The action drama is now shooting in Eastern Europe. He then will return to the United States to begin his recurring role in the USA Network/SyFy series \"The Purge\" (Fall 2018). Based on the popular Blumhouse film franchise about one day each year when murder and mayhem is legalized - the series will be an entirely new chapter in America's 12 hours of annual lawlessness. Baldwin will play David Ryker, the handsome & powerful Managing Partner at an investment firm, who leads his team with confidence & intelligence, but also harbors a Purge night secret. He will also appear in the upcoming Netflix series \"Insatiable.\"\n\nBaldwin made his television series debut starring in the hit ABC series, \"Dirty Sexy Money,\" opposite Jill Clayburgh, Donald Sutherland and Peter Krause. The tongue-in-cheek drama focused on the wealth, power & privilege of the fictional Darling family of New York City. He won rave reviews portraying Patrick Darling, the state Attorney General - who harbored a multitude of scandalous secrets - including an affair with his transgendered mistress. Since then, he has appeared on several acclaimed series including BBC's \"Copper,\" TV Land's \"Hot in Cleveland,\" NBC's \"Parenthood\" & \"30 Rock,\" CW's \"Gossip Girl\" and FX's \"Wilfred.\" He has also guested/recurred on such series as \"MacGyver,\" \"Hawaii 5-0,\" \"Hit the Floor,\" \"Forever,\" and starred in the popular Lifetime telefilm \"The Craig's List Killer.\"\n\nBaldwin has starred in over 30 films of varied genres. In 2005, he memorably starred with Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels in the critical award-winning hit film \"The Squid & The Whale.\" The drama, directed by Noah Baumbach and produced by Wes Anderson, was recognized on over 200 Top 10 Lists that year. He also appeared in the hit comedy \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall,\" with Kristen Bell & Russell Brand, co-starred with William Hurt & Tim Robbins in the independent comedy \"Noise,\" as well as the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival & HBO Comedy Arts Festival entry \"Humble Pie.\" His other film credits include the screen adaptation of Noel Coward's \"Relative Values,\" \"One Eyed King,\" \"The Brotherhood of Murder,\" \"Curdled,\" \"Virus,\" \"Pyromaniacs: A Love Story,\" \"Shattered Image,\" \"Double Bang,\" \"Fair Game,\" \"Sliver,\" \"Three of Hearts,\" \"Flatliners,\" \"Internal Affairs,\" and the \"The Preppy Murder.\" He made his feature film debut in Oliver Stone's \"Born on the Fourth of July.\"\n\nAs a producer, Baldwin co-produced the independent film \"Lymelife\" starring Cynthia Nixon & his brother Alec. He produced & starred in \"Lead with the Heart\" and \"Second Time Around\" for the Hallmark Network.\n\nA native of Massapequa, New York, Baldwin graduated Binghamton University with a degree in Political Science, and politics remains a passion. Baldwin serves on the boards of KCLU radio, The Massapequa Community Fund, The Committee to Preserve Olympic Wrestling, The Los Angelitos Orphanage and The Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Fund.\n\nBaldwin lives in California with his wife, singer/songwriter Chynna Phillips and their three children Jameson, Vance and Brooke. He was also the Executive Producer for Phillips' record \"One Reason\" for her band \"Chynna & Vaughan.\"\n\nAnjelica Huston was born on July 8, 1951 to director and actor John Huston and Russian prima ballerina Enrica 'Ricki' Soma. Huston spent most of her childhood overseas, in Ireland and England, and in 1968 first dipped her toe into the world of show business, taking on the lead role of her father's movie Eine Reise mit der Liebe und dem Tod (1969). However, before it was released, her mother died in a car accident, at 39, and Huston relocated to the United States, where the very tall, exotically-beautiful young woman modeled for several years.\n\nWhile modeling, Huston made sporadic cameo appearances in a couple films, but decided to pursue it as a career in the early '80s. She prepared herself by reaching out to acting coach Peggy Feury and began to get roles. The first notable part was in Bob Rafelson's remake of the classic noir movie Wenn der Postmann zweimal klingelt (1981) (in which Jack Nicholson, with whom Huston had been living since 1973, was the star). After a few more years of on-again, off-again supporting work, her father perfectly cast her as calculating, imperious Maerose, the daughter of a Mafia don whose love is scorned by a hit man (Nicholson again) in his film adaptation of Richard Condon's Mafia-satire novel Die Ehre der Prizzis (1985). Huston won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, making her the first person in Academy Award history to win an Oscar when a parent and a grandparent (her father and grandfather Walter Huston) had also won one.\n\nHuston thereafter worked prolifically, including notable roles in Francis Ford Coppola's Der Steinerne Garten (1987), Barry Sonnenfeld's film versions of the Charles Addams cartoons Die Addams Family (1991) and Die Addams Family in verrückter Tradition (1993), in which she portrayed Addams matriarch Morticia, Wes Anderson's Die Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Die Tiefseetaucher (2004). Probably her finest performance on-screen, however, was as Lilly, the veteran, iron-willed con artist in Stephen Frears' Grifters (1990), for which she received another Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress. A sentimental favorite is her performance as the lead in her father's final film, an adaptation of James Joyce's Die Toten (1987) -- with her many years of residence in Ireland, Huston's Irish accent in the film is authentic.\n\nEndowed with her father's great height and personal boldness, and her mother's beauty and aristocratic nose, Huston certainly cuts an imposing figure, and brings great confidence and authority to her performances. She clearly takes her craft seriously and has come into her own as a strong actress, emerging from under the shadow of her father, who passed away in 1987. Huston married the sculptor Robert Graham in 1992. The couple lived in Venice Beach until Graham's death in 2008.\n\nSean Penn is a powerhouse film performer capable of intensely moving work, who has gone from strength to strength during a colourful film career, and who has drawn much media attention for his stormy private life and political viewpoints.\n\nSean Justin Penn was born in Los Angeles, California, the second son of actress Eileen Ryan (née Annucci) and director, actor, and writer Leo Penn. His brother was actor Chris Penn. His father was from a Lithuanian Jewish/Russian Jewish family, and his mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent.\n\nPenn first appeared in roles as strong-headed or unruly youths such as the military cadet defending his academy against closure in Die Kadetten von Bunker Hill (1981), then as fast-talking surfer stoner Jeff Spicoli in Ich glaub' ich steh' im Wald (1982).\n\nFans and critics were enthused about his obvious talent and he next contributed a stellar performance alongside Timothy Hutton in the Cold War spy thriller Der Falke Und Der Schneemann (1985), followed by a teaming with icy Christopher Walken in the chilling Auf kurze Distanz (1986). The youthful Sean then paired up with his then wife, pop diva Madonna in the woeful, and painful, Shanghai Surprise (1986), which was savaged by the critics, but Sean bounced back with a great job as a hot-headed young cop in Colors - Farben der Gewalt (1988), gave another searing performance as a US soldier in Vietnam committing atrocities in Die Verdammten des Krieges (1989) and appeared alongside Robert De Niro in the uneven comedy Wir sind keine Engel (1989). However, the 1990s was the decade in which Sean really got noticed by critics as a mature, versatile and accomplished actor, with a string of dynamic performances in first-class films.\n\nAlmost unrecognisable with frizzy hair and thin rimmed glasses, Penn was simply brilliant as corrupt lawyer David Kleinfeld in the Brian De Palma gangster movie Carlito's Way (1993) and he was still in trouble with authority as a Death Row inmate pleading with a caring nun to save his life in Dead Man Walking - Sein letzter Gang (1995), for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Sean then played the brother of wealthy Michael Douglas, involving him in a mind-snapping scheme in The Game - Das Geschenk seines Lebens (1997) and also landed the lead role of Sgt. Eddie Walsh in the star-studded anti-war film Der schmale Grat (1998), before finishing the 1990s playing an offbeat jazz musician (and scoring another Oscar nomination) in Sweet and Lowdown (1999).\n\nThe gifted and versatile Sean had also moved into directing, with the quirky but interesting Indian Runner (1991), about two brothers with vastly opposing views on life, and in 1995 he directed Jack Nicholson in Crossing Guard (1995). Both films received overall positive reviews from critics. Moving into the new century, Sean remained busy in front of the cameras with even more outstanding work: a mentally disabled father fighting for custody of his seven-year-old daughter (and receiving a third Oscar nomination) for Ich bin Sam (2001); an anguished father seeking revenge for his daughter's murder in the gut-wrenching Clint Eastwood-directed Mystic River (2003) (for which he won the Oscar as Best Actor); a mortally ill college professor in 21 Gramm (2003) and a possessed businessman in Attentat auf Richard Nixon (2004).\n\nCertainly Sean Penn is one of Hollywood's most controversial, progressive and gifted actors.\n\nBenjamin Géza \"Ben\" Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to mother Chris Anne (Boldt), a school teacher, and father Timothy Byers \"Tim\" Affleck, a social worker. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.\n\nAffleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including In den Fängen eines Fremden (1987) and Auf Kollisionskurs (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Confusion - Sommer der Ausgeflippten (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.\n\nAffleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon - Das jüngste Gericht (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Spurwechsel (2002), Der Anschlag (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Liebe mit Risiko - Gigli (2003) and Wie überleben wir Weihnachten? (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Die Hollywood-Verschwörung (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin' Aces (2006), Er steht einfach nicht auf Dich (2009), State of Play - Stand der Dinge (2009), and Ausgequetscht (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone - Kein Kinderspiel (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town - Stadt ohne Gnade (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win).\n\nIn 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Gone Girl - Das perfekte Opfer (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Suicide Squad (2016), and Justice League (2017). He reprised the role in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and he will next appear as Batman in Aquaman - Lost Kingdom (2023) and The Flash (2023).\n\nRecently he has given praise-worthy performances in Out of Play - Der Weg zurück (2020) as a recovering alcoholic, The Last Duel (2021) (notably he also co-wrote the script), and a scene-stealing golden globe nominated performance in The Tender Bar (2021).\n\nCasey Affleck is a renowned American actor, filmmaker, and producer recognized for his captivating performances and commitment to independent cinema. With an Academy Award under his belt and a reputation as a powerful leading man, Casey Affleck has established himself as one of the most compelling and versatile actors in contemporary cinema. Throughout his career, he has consistently delivered performances of exceptional depth and nuance in a wide range of film genres.\n\nAffleck's breakout role came in Andrew Dominik's critically acclaimed character drama, \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007). His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\n\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007). This gripping neo-noir followed two Boston-based private detectives searching for an abducted young girl. Affleck's performance, showcasing both vulnerability and determination, further cemented his reputation as a rising dramatic force.\n\nThe following decade saw Affleck continue to diversify his roles, venturing outside the realm of independent drama to blockbuster productions. He was seen in Christopher Nolan's ambitious sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" (2014) alongside an ensemble cast including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. Affleck also appeared in Scott Cooper's gritty crime thriller, \"Out of the Furnace\" (2013), where he shared the screen with Christian Bale.\n\nHis versatility continued to shine with his performance in the independent film \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\" (2013), showcasing a quieter, more brooding side to his acting talents. That same year, Affleck turned his attention to production, establishing The Affleck/Middleton Project with John Powers Middleton as a platform to develop and produce a diverse array of film and television projects.\n\nAffleck's directorial work came to fruition with the release of the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here\" (2010), which he directed, wrote, and produced, featuring Joaquin Phoenix in a performance art piece that blurred the lines between fiction and reality. This experimental project demonstrated Affleck's willingness to challenge conventional storytelling formats.\n\nIn 2016, Affleck returned to the spotlight with his career-defining performance in Kenneth Lonergan's profoundly moving drama, \"Manchester by the Sea.\" His portrayal of Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken man coping with immense loss, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. This raw and unforgettable performance cemented Affleck's status as one of the industry's finest dramatic actors.\n\n2016 also saw Affleck star in several other notable films, including the action thriller \"Triple 9\" (2016) and Disney's historical drama, \"The Finest Hours.\" He further expanded his range with roles in independent films like David Lowery's \"A Ghost Story\" (2017), a meditative exploration of loss and the passage of time.\n\nAffleck has continued to take on challenging projects that have pushed his boundaries as an actor. Most recently, he starred opposite Elisabeth Moss in the psychological thriller \"Light of My Life\" (2019), which he also wrote and directed.\n\nHis upcoming projects include a pivotal role in Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated \"Oppenheimer\" (2023), where he portrays theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer himself. Affleck is also slated to star in \"Slingshot\" (2024), a science fiction thriller set in space.\n\nCasey Affleck's talent for embodying complex, flawed characters with profound authenticity has made him one of the most sought-after actors in the industry. With his captivating performances, dedication to his craft, and his discerning eye for unique storytelling projects, the future remains bright for this remarkable actor.\n\nKeanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \"cool breeze over the mountains\" in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patric Reeves, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of Native Hawaiian and Chinese ancestry while Keanu's mother is originally from Essex England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.\n\nAfter a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Bodycheck (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, Das Messer am Ufer (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Gefährliche Liebschaften (1988) with director Stephen Frears.\n\nHis first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan in Bill & Teds verrückte Reise durch die Zeit (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, Eine Wahnsinnsfamilie (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's Ich liebe Dich zu Tode (1990).\n\nOver the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix's narcoleptic male hustler in My Private Idaho (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Viel Lärm um nichts (1993).\n\nIn 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Minnesota (1996) and Wie ich zum ersten Mal Selbstmord beging (1997), and big films like Dem Himmel so nah (1995) and Im Auftrag des Teufels (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Vernetzt - Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and Außer Kontrolle (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure, Matrix (1999).\n\nNow a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them Helden aus der zweiten Reihe (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift - Die dunkle Gabe (2000), Sweet November - Eine Liebe im Herbst (2001), and Hardball (2001) - before Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003.\n\nSince the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Was das Herz begehrt (2003), Das Haus am See (2006), and Street Kings (2008). He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly - Der dunkle Schirm (2006), and Der Tag, an dem die Erde stillstand (2008). And he's waded back into art-house territory with Elli Parker - Schauspielerin (2005), Thumbsucker - Bleib wie du bist! (2005), Pippa Lee (2009), and Henry & Julie - Der Gangster und die Diva (2010).\n\nMost recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013).\n\nIn 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Kapitel 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around."
