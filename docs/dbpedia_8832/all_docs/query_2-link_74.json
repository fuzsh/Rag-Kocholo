        "text": "RNO works diligently to be in compliance with state and federal laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 2010 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504).\n\nIf you are a person with disabilities, please don’t hesitate to request reasonable accommodations by contacting your airline or RTAA’s ADA Compliance Officer directly for any of your airline or airport facility-related needs.\n\nThe Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is a simple tool for airport passengers to voluntarily share that they have a disability or condition that may not be immediately apparent – and that they may need a helping hand, understanding, or more time navigating through airport operations like the security checkpoint.\n\nRNO is one of many airports across the world that participate in the Sunflower program. RNO customers interested in obtaining a Sunflower lanyard or wristband may ask for one at the airport Information Hub or at the ticket counter of your airline.\n\nIf you’re a passenger with a disability traveling with a mobility device, we encourage you to check directly with your airline as wheelchair service at RNO is provided by each airline individually and can vary depending on which airline you’re flying with.\n\nMake requests ahead of travel by dialing the numbers below or visit your airline’s ticket counter upon check-in.\n\nIf needed, there will be a wheelchair service representative to assist our passengers to their flight gate. Should a guest (non-passenger) wish to escort or assist their loved one to the gate, the guest will need to get a “gate/escort pass” from the airline ticket counter. Passes are provided by the airline as long as you have a government-issued photo ID. Wheelchair Assistance and Mobility Offices are located between the Delta and American curbside drop-off areas.\n\nPlease note: Vehicles are not permitted to be left unattended at the curbside."
