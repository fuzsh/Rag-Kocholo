        "text": "Don’t think twice about listening to this one. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.) Lauren Reno’s recent single is a perfect ’90s country throwback: intelligent wordplay, impassioned vocals, luxurious production, and a hook that’ll drag you across the continental divide.\n\nReno is an American country music artist, songwriter, and musician. Born in rural Nevada, a part of the Cherokee Tribe and a gold miner’s daughter. Lauren was raised on country music such as Martina McBride, Patsy Cline, and Johnny Cash. Her father, Eddie Dimock, also a country music artist, was signed to Capital Records in the early 90s. She spent her early 20’s writing songs, performing in church-halls and working long shifts at the local Gold Mine. Lauren is known for her big powerhouse vocals and “old soul” songwriting. Critics have described Lauren’s music as “outlaw” country with Americana-Folk roots. Her fans have said, Reno knows how to blend the “old and the new” perfectly for a sound that contemporary country music has been longing to hear again.\n\nIn 2015, she released an acoustic EP, titled Seasons“= under her maiden name Lauren Dimock. Produced by Adam Palmer, the Seasons EP has been featured in top playlists and performed regionally. These early demos were the start of something great, which would spark a creative flow again after meeting Nashville record producer Ben Reno. The two met on Tinder while Ben was on job out in Nevada composing music for casinos. Long story short, Lauren and Ben ended up falling in love, having two beautiful children, moving back to Nashville, and are continuing their musical legacy together. Lauren and Ben are co-owners of Nashville’s hit-making recording facility, Majestic Ape. Majestic Ape Studio is home to many established songwriters and artists.\n\nCurrently, Lauren has been co-writing and tracking songs in the cracks of raising children, and running the studio.Lauren’s full-length album Gold Rush will be released in early August.\n\nExplain the title of your album?\n\nGold Rush is the title of my upcoming album that will be released in August. The inspiration behind this album is the fact that I grew up as a gold miner’s daughter in rural Nevada. I also worked in the gold mine for two summers in my early twenties. This idea of sharing the reality of the gold rush came to me, and the album took its form quickly and organically. That’s usually when I know I should go ahead with a project. The first single, “Don’t Think,” felt like the perfect start to get people excited about this album. The Gold Rush album feels like an old Western story that happened 100 years ago, but it’s actually a homage to my life and growing up in a small rural town. It came together so perfectly and beautifully, I can’t wait for everyone to hear it.\n\nDo you have any songwriting tips you can share?\n\nHmmm. One of the most important parts of songwriting is being honest, so whenever you’re feeling something, or thinking something, write it down. I have a ton of random notes in my phone or in my journal, it doesn’t necessarily mean I will write a song about what I was feeling or thinking right then and there, but it could be an idea days, months, or years down the road. Another important part of songwriting that I’ve learned is that it may take years for a song to come together, but don’t give up on it, it just might need some time in the “crockpot.”\n\nWho would you love to collaborate with? why?\n\nI would love to collaborate with Martina McBride. Partly because she has been such a huge influence on me vocally, but also because I believe she brought such a unique sound to country music. Her songs have so much meaning behind them, so many can relate. That is something I strive for as a songwriter, to help people feel like they are seen and heard through my lyrics. Martina really captured her fans with the relatability of her songs. It would definitely be a dream come true if I were able to collaborate with her!\n\nDo you have any go-to albums to listen to in the van?\n\nAnything by Tom Petty. Particularly the “Wildflowers” album. His music is timeless, and easy to listen to. It won’t tire your ears out, and it is the perfect soundtrack to any long day in the van. Another wouldn’t necessarily be an album, but a 90’s country playlist can be the best way to pass the time. If I feel like putting on a little show for myself I will definitely turn on some classic Shania Twain.\n\nDo you play covers at your shows? Why or why not?\n\nYES! I love to play a few covers. One of the biggest reasons is because there are so many great songs in country music, how could I not? In all seriousness though, it is not all about me. I want people to hear my music, but I also want those at my shows to hear something familiar. I think it can loosen up the crowd a little bit. A good cover can really get the party started. I’m humble enough to realize that the crowd won’t be singing one of my songs word for word (yet) but there is nothing better as an artist than hearing a crowd sing a song with you. It’s a special moment at any show when the whole audience is belting out a song whether it’s mine or an amazing cover. It makes it feel like we all know each other for a minute.\n\nGold Rush will be released in August."
