        "text": "How Tennis Nation Racquet Sports Began\n\nWhen I started Tennis Nation Racquet Sports back in 2015, my goal was simple: develop the best system of tennis instruction, training and resources to help players improve their game.\n\nWhat I found through all of my research is that their is a ton of talk and information on the internet about tennis technique and mechanics, but not much information on key athletic skills like eye hand coordination, ball judgement, movement, rhythm, timing, and the mental game.\n\nToday, Tennis Nation Racquet Sports is dedicated to helping as many tennis and pickleball players as possible take their existing games to the next level by providing candid advice that cuts through all the noise.\n\nDon’t Worry You’re Not Too Late\n\nIf you haven’t started playing tennis or pickleball yet, don’t worry, you’re not alone and you’re not to late. Spend some time exploring my Start Here page. It’s designed to help you get a sense of what is involved and make good tennis decisions on your own, without having to pay some sketchy “online guru.”\n\nIn fact, I give out all my best advice for free inside my newsletter. I hope you subscribe.\n\nMy goal is to build this site into a resource that not only helps you improve your game and avoid the false promises of “get great quick” schemes, but also helps you find enjoyment in the sport."
