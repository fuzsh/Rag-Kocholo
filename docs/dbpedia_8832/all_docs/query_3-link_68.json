        "text": "HIGH MOUNTAIN ROOFING CONTRACTOR\n\nWelcome to Reno Roof Repair\n\nThis blog, was caused by a review search , I did on our business.Which caused me to write this blog, The Internet reviews,of Reno Roofing Contractors are a farce!\n\nMost all of these business review sites are worthless, and full of lies, and speculation. They no nothing about me. Or the success of our business. There criteria is a bunch of crap. Do not believe these sights. There might be one or two legitimate sights. But the rest are, just causing problems, for innocent businesses.There are to many sights to list, but they are all lazy, uneducated idiots.\n\nWhat do I mean you ask? Well as a business owner for the last 17 years, I have been able to witness the fall of newspapers, phone books, and most media that you can hold in your hands. The majority of our business has come from friends, referrals, and family. It really disheartens me, to see how uniformed the public has become. Every thing on the Internet has to be true right? A billion websites and counting. How much is truth, you ask? You tell me! Come on people, wake up. Everyone, everybody, every living thing that breathes on earth is out to make a buck, on every body else, and or their business on the net. There’s nothing wrong with making money, but at what cost? Boy that’s real creative. Took a lot of brainpower to use somebody elses, right? Get a life; let’s see you start a real business from scratch, not off of somebody elses success. You are all like a bunch of leeches, yes I am talking about these review sites. I probably will even lose business, just because I dare speak my mind. It is what it is. I will always speak my mind.\n\nAnd they don’t care if they destroy somebody’s reputation or not. He’s rated at 78% or whatever, don’t have a clue about the business, should be 98-99%. This was one of the ratings, on a site I reviewed.Or they just drive business away, because people believe these uniformed, dumbed down sites. I could go to everyone one of these suppose accredited sites, and talk up or down about my competitors, and the public would believe it. What a joke. Oh they all say they have their own criteria. They say we have 10 reasons why we rate this company, hogwash. They don’t know my business from (@x**), from shinola. Excuse the french, but truth is truth. Their just out to make money on mine and your name, good or bad.\n\nWe have been in business like I have stated above for 17 years. And we love to be one of Reno’s Roofing Contractor’s. I have had 1-2 small complaints at the Nevada State Contractors Board. Which were proven to be false. I am not saying we have a perfect record; we don’t, and never will. There is only one GOD who is perfect and he is my FATHER JESUS CHRIST, the one and only true perfection, that I aspire to be like, but fall on my face every day, failing him, with a broken heart. But get back up and keep trying, to no avail. It’s hard to survive in such a crazy, anti JESUS world that we live in today.\n\nThe only thing I can do is the right thing. Take care of our customers, and service them with, love and integrity, as CHRIST would have me do. I don’t wear a cross, around my neck; I don’t have a fish on my site. I have a cross, I carry every day in my heart and that’s a workout in it’s self. It’s not bragging that I am a Christian, or putting a fish on my site, or say that the company is a Christian company. Give me a break. It’s how you and I live our lives behind closed doors. Now theirs a struggle. Try doing that. Live your life when no ones watching. Except GOD, and his SON JESUS CHRIST, looking at every breath and step we take. Now there’s a wake up call! And the persecution, which comes from the world, is astounding to me. I never thought just because I love JESUS, my life would be under so much persecution. But JESUS commands me to be the salt and light of the earth. His truth and light must shine, at all costs, including my life. (Matthew 5:14-15) Don’t ask, unless you are Born Again, you will never understand, but I digress (John 14:6), (John 3:3), (John 3:5-7).\n\nI have strived for 17 years to have an A+ rating, because I care. I am not accredited, not because I don’t meet BBB, criteria. They have called me at least 10 times in the past, wanting to accredit my business, plus $ 500.00 bucks. Get it, make a buck, and keep their jobs. It’s because I am not willing to give them $ 500.00 bucks to have them say how great we are. They are a great, company but, the money issue, to have to be accredited, is a joke. If it was, what they say it was, they would do the research for free, and accredit companies for free, if they meet their criteria. Which we always have.\n\nThese website’s that all claim to know me, they don’t. My thousands of happy customers do. They can only conjure up what they can find off of the net, right?And that’s supposed to the be, the be all end all. They are just trying to make the almighty buck, whether they damage your reputation or not. Or they can say good things about you business, and bump your ratings up, if you agree to pay for their services.Get it?And if you don’t whoa unto you, and your business. By the way, I don’t know of any thing good or bad thing’s on the web, about our business. Most of the sites have me with no reviews, that’s OK with me, and don’t care.Unfortunately, a lot of potential customers, might. Also the search engines, are the same. Oh they have their criteria too! According to them, I am not worthy to be searched, because I don’t comply, and or pay for their services. They make it almost impossible, to get on the front page, unless you give them your blood.\n\nI know what kind of business I run, Imperfect, but striving to be. I just don’t like what the web has become. It’s almost considered a crime if you don’t Facebook, or Tweet. And if you don’t belong one of these thousands of supposed other great and honest sites, read (Romans 1: 24-32) nosy, lying, back biting, hate full malicious gross, JESUS hating, supposed family sites. Oh my GOD, call homeland security, somebody will. Take him to mental hospital, something is wrong with him. Oh how I dare speak the name JESUS, whom I so love, and admire. You just can’t be an old-fashioned fellow, who happens to miss the old innocent years, gone by. GTO’s’, Mustangs, Camaro’s, Charger’s, you get the drift. When air bag, meant your mother-in-law. I know. I love my mother-in-law, by the way. It’s just a joke.Who liked the country when it was a free country? Not when every keystroke, web search, you looked at has been logged, categorized or just plain snooped on.\n\nWhat happened to the (2) greatest commandment’s? To love GOD with all your heart, mind and soul. And the second is to love your neighbor, as your self. Not destroy, snitch, gossip, or talk bad on the net about each other. It is hard enough in today’s business climate to just make it through another day. Without, everyone else out there, talking bad, or trashing your company. We all need to step back, and take a long look at where this country is going. And in my opinion, it’s going down the drain. The constitution has all but been used for toilet paper.\n\nI know this is supposed to be a blog about roofing. And in a round about way it is. I just wanted to use my 1st amendment rights, while I am still able to. Which in my opinion is just about gone.\n\nBy the way, I hate Blogs. But I guess, you almost have to have one today.I am being forced to participate in this crazy, medium. If I had my druthers, I would never be on the net. I am way to old fashioned. But please come back. I promise I will continue to have more roofing related stuff, to talk about in the future. Oh by the way, I hope we still are your local Hometown Reno Roofing Contractor, for many years to come.\n\nOh by the way, I love animals. These are my mutt’s.\n\nJust told you something about me! We even roof dog houses.\n\nPlease feel free to comment, good or bad. I can take it\n\nPlease call, if interested; ask for David (775) 322-7003"
