        "text": "Jazmine\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nI am a student at the University of Nevada, Reno, and I am set to graduate with a Bachelor of Veterinary Science degree in the spring of 2025. I have a full house with three dogs: one American Lab, Achilles; one Terrier mix, Venus; and one Belgian Malinois, Andromeda. I enjoy participating in dog sports, cooking, baking, and making arts and crafts in my free time.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to attend veterinary school and become a veterinarian. My whole life has been dedicated to learning about and caring for animals. As a child, I read any animal-related books I could find and brought home sick animals in an attempt to nurse them back to health. I entered the veterinary field in 2020 and have continued to fervently pursue knowledge to ensure I serve patients to the best of my ability.\n\nI joined the Animal Medical Center team in 2023 and have been abundantly grateful for the opportunity. AMC prioritizes continued education of staff, genuine client relationships, and overall quality medicine. I am excited to continue my veterinary journey at AMC and assist in your pet’s care.\n\nBarbie\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nJoined team September 2018\n\nI grew up at the edge of a large citrus grove in Ventura, California, and developed a deep connection to animals at a young age. There were always orphaned kittens and sick or injured cats in need. I found rescuing them simply irresistible, regardless of what I had to crawl into or under to reach them! While working in real estate and seemingly by chance, I was offered a position at the feline-only practice where I took feral cats to be altered and indeed found my calling! Taking part in reducing the feral cat population and bottle-feeding orphaned kittens consumed much of my time for many years. I went on to work in a mixed, small animal practice. I’ve always been active with spay/neuter and release efforts, and even over the past decade, I have chosen to be a stay-at-home wife and mom.\n\nIn 2018, my husband of 30 years and I decided to relocate with our adult sons to be near family, and we are proud to call Reno our new home. I am absolutely thrilled about the unique opportunity to work at both a feline-only hospital and a canine hospital to continue my passion for working with animals. I love the entire staff at AMC & RHC, as there is nothing more rewarding than spending every day with such a devoted team of professional animal lovers and caregivers! My free time is entirely dedicated to my husband, Dan, our sons, and our calico cat, Clover.\n\nSammy\n\nLVT – Practice Manager\n\nPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS:\n\nNAVTA- National Association of Veterinary Technicians of America\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nTruckee Meadows Community College- Applied Science of Veterinary Technology, Graduated in 2009\n\nI joined the team in June 2005. I am a Nevada native. I have worked in the veterinary field since 2005 and graduated with my LVT in May 2009. I started at AMC as a veterinary assistant in 2005 while attending school. I became a licensed veterinary technician in 2009; I love every aspect of my job. In 2011, I became the practice manager of Animal Medical Center and Reno Hospital for Cats; I enjoy this new role in ensuring our patients receive the best care possible and that our clients can rest easy when they leave their pets with us. I spend my free time with my husband and two sons. Our house is complete with our dog, Ashford, and two cats, Sheeba and Izzy.\n\nDr. Don Long\n\nDVM\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nDoctor of Veterinary Medicine- Kansas State University 1968\n\nMILITARY SERVICE:\n\nCaptain in the United States Air Force Veterinary Corps. 1968-1970\n\nPROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS:\n\nAmerican Animal Hospital Association, American Veterinary Medical Association, Western Nevada Veterinary Society, American Association of Feline Practitioners, Alpha Zeta Honorary Society\n\nPERSONALLY…\n\nI grew up on a wheat and cattle ranch outside of Winfield, Kansas, and attended Kansas State University. I have two grown children, Amy, who lives in Florida with her four children, and Chris, who lives in Reno and has four children. My pets include two German short-hair pointers, “Mandy” and “KT,” which take up all my free time. Along with spending time with my wife, my hobbies include woodworking, metalworking, hitting the golf course with my buddies, and spending time on my ranch in Kansas.\n\nDr. Darrin Lewellen\n\nDVM\n\nI was born and raised in Plainview, TX, a small farm town in the Texas panhandle. My upbringing instilled in me a strong work ethic and a sense of ingenuity while being practical. I have loved working with animals since childhood, which inspired me to become their ultimate caretaker, a veterinarian. I studied at Texas A&M University as a biomedical science major. I did not receive a bachelor’s degree, as I was fortunate enough to become part of the class of 2000 at the College of Veterinary Medicine after completing the prerequisites. During veterinary school, I tracked mixed animals with an emphasis on exotic medicine, which gave me a broad understanding of many animal species. Throughout the last twenty-plus years of practice, I have developed a unique combination of skills and passions for small animal internal medicine, soft tissue and some orthopedic surgeries, dentistry, dermatology, avian and exotic medicine, and animal behavior.\n\nI’m an extroverted, fun, and goofy guy who is always ready and willing to teach what I’ve learned in my career. My communication style is direct and to the point, but I also love to make jokes, and I’m a master of “Dad Puns.” In my free time away from the hospital, I enjoy golfing, snowboarding, and the outdoors with my family. I also enjoy practicing and producing music, watching sports, and binge-watching the latest TV series.\n\nDr. Eryn Taormina, Owner\n\nDVM\n\nDr. Taormina was born and raised in New Jersey in the Greater New York Area. She has been a licensed veterinarian since May 2011, when she graduated from Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine in St. Kitts after completing her clinical rotations at Louisiana State University’s School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nBefore starting veterinary school, Dr. Taormina worked 6 years as a veterinary technician at a mixed-animal practice near her hometown in NJ. In December 2013, Dr. Taormina came out to Nevada for a visit and instantly felt drawn to the tranquility of the desert and the mountains. Always ready for adventure, she relocated in February of 2014 and continued building her career here in Reno, Nevada.\n\nIn her free time, she enjoys horseback riding, exercising, camping, and adventures with her daughter, Carmela.\n\nTraveling is another passion of hers. She completed a wildlife externship in South Africa in 2009 and an equine externship in New Zealand in 2011. She lived in St. Kitt’s for veterinary school and traveled around Ireland after graduating. Dr. Taormina can’t wait to travel some more and share her passion with her daughter.\n\nAnd, yes, Dr. Taormina has plenty of pets – 2 dogs – Max and Vincenza; 2 horses – Tess and Walker; 2 Nigerian dwarf goats – Pauly and Christopher; 1 red-eared slider named Loomis, and her newest edition, a kitty cat named Withers."
