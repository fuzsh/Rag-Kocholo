I can't swear to that, but that's what I understand. I sincerely would like to be educated, if I'm wrong about this.\n\nOn a slightly related note, Ralph Stanley has spoken about his service in Europe during WWII, I believe he served more or less in a clerk capacity.\n\nI would DEARLY love to know some of the details of brother Carter's stateside service in the Army Air Force -- something tells me he might have been a rascal! I think Carter served at what is now Fort Lewis in Washington state.\n\nThe Blue Sky Boys, Bill and Earl Bolick both served in combat; Bill with the Marines in the Pacific and Earl was a paratrooper in Normandy for D Day and after!\n\nRed Smiley, shot all to hell in Italy. Paul Warren, prisoner of war to the Germans. Carl Story and Howdy Forrester, US Navy WWII. Grandpa Jones with the Army in Europe during the war too. Ned Cline of the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, KIA.\n\nEdited by - The Old Timer on 12/27/2012 18:20:50"
