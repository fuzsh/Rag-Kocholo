        "text": "Jeremy Renner says he loves Reno, Mt. Rose, and calls himself a Renoite — we asked him\n\nCorrection: Jeremy Renner's divorce with ex-wife Sonni Pacheco was complete in 2015.\n\nJeremy Renner chooses to live in the Reno area for the same reason that a lot of us do: the mountains and the fact that our city is, indeed, the biggest little city.\n\nWhile celebrities frequent the Lake Tahoe area, Renner told the Reno Gazette Journal on Dec. 10 that he's chosen to live in Washoe County for about seven years because of the \"majestic\" mountains and the strong sense of community in Reno.\n\n\"In a big city, it's hard to find community and even know your neighbors in a big city, but with Reno, I find I know quite a few people here. It's just big enough, and it's just small enough for me, and I love it,\" said Renner.\n\nCommunity: Jeremy Renner takes kids shopping at 'Shop with the Sheriff' in South Reno\n\nHis initial introduction to the area was through skiing in his youth in the Sierra on family vacations, said Renner, who grew up as the eldest of five children of divorced parents in Modesto, Calif.\n\nHe teaches all of the children in his family how to ski in the Reno-Tahoe area, though he hasn't been able to hit the slopes himself for about 10 years.\n\n\"I think I might go tomorrow,\" Renner said on Tuesday while volunteering at the Shop with the Sheriff event at the South Reno Walmart.\n\nSheriff Darin Balaam said having Renner, who both shopped with children and signed autographs for them, truly enhanced the experience for the kids.\n\nOn Thursday, Renner posted an Instagram photo with a Sheriff's Office employee from the shopping event, thanking the office for \"another wonderful day.\"\n\nThe actor, best known these days for his role as Hawkeye in the Marvel Studios' Avenger series, is known also for his more serious roles in the \"Hurt Locker,\" \"Arrival,\" and \"Wind River.\"\n\nThough his industry binds him to the Hollywood scene and much travel, Renner finds it refreshing to come home to Nevada, Renner said.\n\nWhile Reno has a history of Hollywood stars, from Marilyn Monroe to Sammy Davis Jr. and Frank Sinatra, stopping and cavorting at hot spots like the old Mapes Hotel, Renner is one of the few celebrities who has ever really called Reno — not Tahoe — home. Ice skater Kristi Yamaguchi and reality show Judge Mills Lane lived in Reno while the formerly married Captain and Tennille, of the 1970s musical duo, used to live in Washoe Valley.\n\nWatch: Sparks fourth grader talks about shopping with Jeremy Renner\n\n\"There's no traffic, clean air, clean water, friendly, smiling faces here. I think it's a majestic place,\" said Renner.\n\nThe actor, who is going through a custody battle with his ex-wife Sonni Pacheco that's attracting publicity, has been visible in Reno in recent weeks.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, the actor brought his daughter, Ava Berlin, to assist with handing out clothes and hot meals to homeless people living in Reno motels and to people living in tent encampments on the Truckee River.\n\nRenoites have welcomed Renner as a special deputy at the Washoe County Sheriff's Office and as a hands-on volunteer at local charity functions.\n\nRenner hasn't considered himself a Renoite until now because he wasn't familiar with the term.\n\n\"I don't know what that means. Is that a good connotation or a bad connotation?\" Renner asked, turning to his friend, Tim Doss, who operates the Reno Hope Bus.\n\nCommunity: Jeremy Renner surprises Reno's homeless, helps Thanksgiving volunteers\n\n\"It means you love Reno, you're part of the community,\" Doss said in return.\n\n\"Oh yes, call me that. Call me whatever you want. I don't care. Call me Kevin,\" said Renner, chuckling.\n\nRenner said his love for Northern Nevada even extends beyond Reno.\n\n\"I've been all around. I went to Fernley and I went out to Fallon,\" Renner said. \"I love it, man. This community reminds me of where I grew up... It reminds me of family, of home.\""
