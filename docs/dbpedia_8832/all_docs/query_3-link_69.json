        "text": "The DC music community is reeling from this morning’s sad announcement of the cancellation of the historic Fort Reno summer concert series headed by Amanda MacKaye. Discovering those shows several years ago was my inspiration to create Hometown Sounds, and I make it a point to attend as many of the shows as I can every summer, no matter who’s on stage. We normally don’t feature live videos for the DC Music Video of the Day, but this exception is more than worth it. Q And Not U were an integral part of DC’s post-hardcore Dischord style, and their final performance at Fort Reno back in 2005 drew a massive and enthusiastic crowd. It’s pretty amazing that such a quality video exists of The Rapture’s Harris Klahr, Title Tracks’ John Davis and Washington Post music critic Chris Richards playing a scorching version of A Line In The Sand from Q And Not U’s 2000 album No Kill No Beep Beep. Here’s hoping Fort Reno isn’t dead yet!"
