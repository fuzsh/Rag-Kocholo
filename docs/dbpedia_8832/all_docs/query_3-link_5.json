        "text": "“Let little Ricky sing! Little Ricky can play!”\n\nIn 1960, Bill Monroe found himself faced with an enthusiastic crowd in Martha, Kentucky. He and his Bluegrass Boys were playing a gig at the local high school.\n\nIn between songs, the crowd implored Bill to “let little Ricky play!”\n\nThis went on and on for some time. Bill finally gave in:\n\n“Well, where is this little Ricky?”\n\nThe audience, mostly family and friends of the boy, pushed a tiny lad to the edge of the stage…\n\nRicky recalled the moment many years later:\n\n“Bill looks down at me… grabs me by the arm and lifts me on to the stage.”\n\n“What do you play, boy?”\n\n“Well, I play mandolin!”\n\n“Oh, you do?!”\n\nBill slipped his full-sized mandolin from his shoulder, wrapped the strap around a couple times so it would fit the boy and put it over little Ricky.\n\n“I sing, too!”\n\n“Oh, you do! What do you wanna sing?”\n\n“I wanna sing Ruby!”\n\nYoung Ricky launched into his version of the Osborne Brothers’s tune, as if he were born to the stage.\n\nAccording to Ricky, Bill pretended to be annoyed, looking around as if he were simply waiting for the boy to finish.\n\nWhen Ricky came to the end of “Ruby,” Monroe retrieved his mandolin, struck the strings about three times, then turned to the mic:\n\n“Now we’re gonna do the Mule Skinner Blues!”\n\nBut the legend of little Ricky Skaggs and Monroe’s mandolin were engraved into the history of bluegrass.\n\nBy the next year he was a guest of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs on the Grand Ole Opry, cementing his branch on the bluegrass family tree.\n\nLittle Ricky went on to become one of the great bluegrass and country musicians of all time.\n\nBut he was not the first, or the last, to add a branch to that tree.\n\nMonroe would be for years, the center of the genre he had created. Countless musicians got their big break in the ranks of his Bluegrass Boys, coming in to fill gaps in the band over the years and decades.\n\nThere are few bluegrass musicians who can’t trace a link back to Monroe. Even if they never played for him, they were all influenced by him, directly, or indirectly.\n\nA Banjo Vacancy\n\nWhen we left the story last, Bill Monroe had unleashed a new style of country music upon the world when he completed the transformation of his Bluegrass Boys, with the addition of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs.\n\nScruggs’s innovative banjo picking style elevated the hillbilly sound to something new, what would eventually be called ‘bluegrass.’\n\nWhen he and Flatt left the band and formed their own, they gave birth to a new genre, even though it still didn’t have a name.\n\nTheir departure left a huge gap in Monroe’s lineup. He quickly filled the spots, except for banjo. Scruggs was a hard act to follow.\n\nDon Reno\n\nOne of the countless musicians who filtered through the ranks of the Bluegrass Boys was a young man named Don Reno.\n\nReno, much like ‘little Ricky’ began playing at the age of five. He started out on the banjo, then went on to master the guitar as well, known for his innovative mix of jazz and blues and a two-fingered banjo technique.\n\nIn 1943, Bill Monroe offered him a job in his band, but Reno enlisted in the army to fight in the Pacific, where he served in the famous Merrill’s Marauders, and was wounded.\n\nSo Bill hired David ‘Stringbean’ Akeman instead.\n\nAfter the war Reno returned home where he played for several different groups in his home town of Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1948, he heard about Earl Scruggs’s departure from the Bluegrass Boys, so he headed to North Carolina, where Monroe and his boys were scheduled to play.\n\nNot unlike ‘little Ricky,’ Reno came prepared to make a splash.\n\nDuring one of the Bluegrass Boys’ sets, Reno jumped on stage and joined in on banjo. The bold move won him the job. He stayed with the Bluegrass Boys until the next year, when he was struck with a case of malaria and had to leave.\n\nThe Tennessee Cut-Ups\n\nLater that year, 1949, Reno got a call from another group, one of his early influences: Tommy Magness and the Tennessee Buddies, from Roanoke, Virginia. He took the offer and that’s where he met Red Smiley.\n\nRed Smiley was the guitar player for the Tennessee Buddies at the time. He and Reno hit it off.\n\nSmiley began playing guitar early, around the age of seven, supposedly after being inspired by the playing of two ‘hobos’ he saw playing one day.\n\nLike Reno, Smiley also joined the army during World War 2. After the war he went to school to learn diesel mechanics in Nashville, Tennessee. That’s where he saw Don Reno on banjo for the first time, playing with Monroe on the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nNow they were in the same band.\n\nWhen in 1951, their boss, Tommy Magness retired, they joined another band, Toby Stroud’s Blue\n\nMountain Boys.\n\nThey recorced one song together, as a duo in 1952, but then took different paths, until in 1955, they were again asked to join together for a live show in Richmond, Virginia. Not long after, they formed their famous Tennessee Cut-Ups.\n\nTheir fame grew throughout the southeast.\n\nSo much so that in 1956 they were recruited for a weekday morning country music TV show in Roanoke, Virginia, called Top o’ the Morning.\n\nThey didn’t tour much during that period, due partly to the TV show schedule and partly to Reno’s health.\n\nOver the next eight years, they racked up a string of hits, including “Don’t let Your sweet Love Die,” “I Wouldn’t Change You If I Could,” and “I’m Using My Bible For A Road Map.”\n\nThey separated in 1964, though Reno kept the band.\n\nThey came together a few times over the following years, until Smiley died in 1972, at only 47 years old, due to complications from diabetes.\n\nMonroe’s Bluegrass Family Tree continued to grow over the years, spawning and influencing other budding musicians, until it was a Smoky Mountain forest.\n\nReno and Smiley, like Ricky Skaggs, were just a couple of branches on that tree. While they were fabulous musicians in their own right, they all took shade under Monroe’s branches.\n\nWant to know more about the history and origins of Bluegrass?\n\nCheck out these resources:\n\nRachel Liebling’s amazing documentary: High Lonesome: The Story of Bluegrass Music.\n\nBill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass, documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqehSh8Y-5o\n\nYoung Ricky Skaggs, on The Grand Ole Opry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh0Py4fNRqc"
