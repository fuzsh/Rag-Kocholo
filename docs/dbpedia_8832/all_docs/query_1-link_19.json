        "text": "We are planning to relocate and are considering options. Two possible areas are Tucson and Reno. I have not spent much time in either location and am doing research to determine if one (or both) would be a good fit. Obviously there is heat and critters; and the taxes and costs have been analyzed. What I seek is an insider's perspective on everyday life in these locations, a pilot's perspective that sheds a bit of light on the lesser known joys and frustrations of living in these places.\n\nIF YOU LIVE, or HAVE LIVED, in either Tucson or Reno, I'd like to get your insight into one or more of the following:\n\nWhat did you find surprising about life there--a good or bad aspect of the city that you did not anticipate?​\n\n​\n\nWhat do you miss about the place/places you have previously lived?​\n\n​\n\nWhat would you miss about Tucson/Reno if you were to move away (or what do you miss if you have lived there and moved away)?​\n\n​\n\nDo you have a recommendation regarding high schools?​\n\n​\n\nWe like cultural activities including music, theater, and art--if you are into these pursuits, how would you characterize the local scene?​\n\n​\n\n*If you own an airplane, where does it live and how is the local GA community?​\n\nYour time and expertise are greatly appreciated.\n\nI haven't lived in either, but I have lived in Napa, and spent lots of time in Reno. Passed through Tucson. I've lived in the Mojave Desert too - as far as Tucson goes, a desert is a desert.\n\nWhy??????\n\nI had the same question. I am trying to understand the calculus that leaves Napa and ends up in either of those two places. But I wanted to wait until OP's questions got answered first before asking\n\nuntil then.\n\nFriends just retired to the Carson City area. They looked at New Mexico, Arizona, and North Carolina.. there must have been some very compelling reason for this as I know they are very thorough in their research.\n\nI had the same question. I am trying to understand the calculus that leaves Napa and ends up in either of those two places. But I wanted to wait until OP's questions got answered first before asking\n\nuntil then.\n\nGuess one would venture to say the cost of living... and/or a job opportunity.. I too will await the response.\n\nI spent 2 years in Tucson (grad school), 5 years in Phoenix 30 yrs or so ago. Now I live in Colorado.\n\nHot & desert don't begin to describe Tucson.\n\nBenefits:\n\nMajor university means a great deal of opportunity for the arts & technology and the med school.\n\nIf you're into big time sports, Phoenix is about 90 min drive north. UA has a pretty good althletic dept for college sports. Cheaper than anything in Phoenix\n\nReally fast trip to Nogales altho from what I understand, not so great anymore. When I was there, it had little or none of the problems the other border towns had. It was very common to drive down for dinner and not worry about safety. Don't think that's true anymore.\n\nThe HUGE aircraft cemetary.\n\nMountains, hiking, camping.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nhot desert - welcome to extreme density altitude!\n\nbeing in the US/Mexico border, the entire border with the exception of the area around Nogales is MOA or R. But that's true of pretty much the entire SW border of the US.\n\nWhat did you find surprising about life there--a good or bad aspect of the city that you did not anticipate?\n\nIt’s scenic. Mountains all the way around. Winters are great and summer is hot but not as hot as phoenix.\n\nWhat do you miss about the place/places you have previously lived?\n\nMosquitoes, tornadoes and humidity I don’t miss. I miss lakes, rivers, trees and green grass.\n\nWhat would you miss about Tucson/Reno if you were to move away (or what do you miss if you have lived there and moved away)?\n\nYear round flying and golf\n\nDo you have a recommendation regarding high schools?\n\nVail school district\n\nWe like cultural activities including music, theater, and art--if you are into these pursuits, how would you characterize the local scene?\n\nNot really into that but from what I’ve heard, it’s pretty good here.\n\nIf you own an airplane, where does it live and how is the local GA community?\n\nIt lives in a hangar at Tucson International. Local crowd is very easy to get along with. Highly recommended\n\nI haven’t lived in either but I have traveled to Reno. The casinos bring in some entertainment and decent food. I flew out of Truckee and found it to be a nice small town. But it is a small town and the Tahoe area is very touristy and subject to a lot of part time residents and tourist traffic. It is beautiful though.\n\nI’d probably also consider Utah Montana Idaho and Colorado, possibly Wyoming too. Some areas that I liked are Park City, Sandpoint, Coeur d’Alene, Flathead Lake, Whitefish, Jackson and Mammoth Lakes. I’d probably lean towards Coeur d’Alene or Whitefish personally, and if looking to get something cheaper than those two, then Flathead Lake. I do like Colorado as well, but just not as familiar with the areas there.\n\nMy thoughts are based upon cleanliness, modern and clean downtown area, modern housing options, decent food and vibes, and outdoor activities (hiking, dog friendly, winter sports). I’m also heavily desired to having a large body of water nearby. I’m a lakes type person.\n\nI've spent a bunch of time in both places. Reno is higher elevation (4400', vs 2600') and is therefore cooler in the summer. That's a real plus for me. Nevada is full of BLM land, so if you are interested in off airport landing and airplane camping, Nevada will be a better choice. Southern Arizona has a lot of MOAs and some Restricted airspace. Reno is close to the Dead Cow dry lakebed that is home to the High Sierra Fly-In if that is your kind of thing. The Truckee River flows through Reno and the city has built a series of parks along the river. Taxes will be lower in Nevada thanks to gambling revenue, but if you have a gambling addiction, it might be best to stay away. If you like snow skiing, Mount Rose just outside Reno has a good ski area. You'll probably never see any snow in Tucson. Tucson also has a high percentage of folks living in poverty and that has lots of ripple effects. Reno was on our short list for retirement life, but we decided we wanted to be closer to salt water and mountain flying options, so we wound up in Washington State. The census bureau has lots of good comparative data for both towns:\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/tucsoncityarizona/PST045222\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/renocitynevada/PST045222\n\nI spent 2 years in Tucson (grad school), 5 years in Phoenix 30 yrs or so ago.
