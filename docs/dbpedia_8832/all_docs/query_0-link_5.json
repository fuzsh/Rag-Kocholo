        "text": "ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Ronnie Reno was already a seasoned musician when his family moved to Roanoke in the late ‘50s, and Don Reno, Red Smiley and the Tennessee Cutups began performing on WDBJ7′s “Top o’ the Morning” program.\n\n“This nine-pound hammer, it’s a little too heavy, just for my size, just for my size,” Ronnie Reno sang in a program featuring Reno & Smiley and the Stanley Brothers.\n\nHe describes that period as the best times of his life, even if it wasn’t always easy to get out of bed.\n\n“I never did like to get up early when you’re young, of course, my mom used to wake me up with a cold washrag. And oh Lord, I would come out of there after that. I was ready to sing,” he said laughing.\n\nReno has had a long and successful career, as a musician, songwriter and television host. He has retired from touring, and his downtime during COVID allowed him to rediscover recordings from the early ‘80s, that also featured his father and his brothers Don Wayne and Dale.\n\n“It just got put on the back burner, and down through the years I lost it,” he said in an interview. “I have a bunch of stuff and when the COVID hit and I retired I started going through all of my archives and library and fortunately I found ‘em.”\n\nThe result is ‘40 Years Late and Right on Time’, an album with 10 tracks of previously unreleased recordings.\n\n“It’s fulfilling I think for our whole family,” Reno said. “We’re just thrilled that we’re able to keep them and once you put them out there, they’re there forever, like anything that’s out on a streaming platform, it’s going to be where everybody can go get ‘em.”\n\nAnd as for those days on “Top o’ the Morning,” Ronnie Reno has fond memories of Roanoke and the musicians who were a big part of his life.\n\n“They were just way ahead of their time. And for the short period of time that Reno and Smiley were together they put together a wonderful, wonderful history of music, and it’s still revered today.”"
