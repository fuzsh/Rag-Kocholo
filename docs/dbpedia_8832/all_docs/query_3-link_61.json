        "text": "Two Mondays ago, a group of Wolf Pack football players made their way to northwest Reno's Sushi Rose for dinner. They were there to celebrate a man who died more than two years earlier, their friend Marc Ma.\n\nMa, the former Wolf Pack defensive lineman who died in a paddle boarding accident at Lake Tahoe in 2016, would have turned 23 on the day his old Wolf Pack friends went to dinner in his honor. They ordered spider rolls. Those were Ma’s favorite. He loved the soft-shell crab in them. It was a crunchy, sweet, delicious.\n\n“Marc was my boy, as he was everybody’s boy,” said Nevada's Korey Rush, one of the half-dozen Wolf Pack players who made the trip to Sushi Rose.\n\nWhen Nevada heads to Hawaii for their game on the islands Saturday, Ma will be on the minds of the Wolf Pack players. This would have been his senior season. It would have been a homecoming, the 6-foot-2, 255-pounder being a native of Honolulu, where Saturday’s game will be played.\n\n“It’s not lip service when we say he was an amazing human being,” Rush said. “He really was that through and through. That’s just why it was so tragic losing him, and that’s why this game is so special to us and everybody involved with him and with this program.”\n\nMa played only one season for Nevada, redshirting as a freshman in 2015, but he left an impact that far exceeded the 12 months he spent in Reno. In June 2016, Ma and some of his Wolf Pack friends visited the west shore of Lake Tahoe. They were paddle boarding when high winds created 3- to 5-foot swells. Ma, who wasn’t wearing a life jacket, was knocked off his board and was presumed to have drowned.\n\nThe Wolf Pack mourned Ma’s loss and held a celebration of life in his honor. They have kept his locker in place at Cashell FieldHouse, made a helmet logo the teams wears in his honor and haven’t handed out his No. 59 jersey number. Although the coaching staff that brought him to Nevada was dismissed after the 2016 season, new head coach Jay Norvell and his assistants have kept him in mind.\n\n“That is a very honorable thing to do, and it’s a correct thing to do, especially with the number of players that he touched when he was here,” said Kalei Meyer, a Hawaiian native who played against Ma in high school and befriended him at Nevada. “There was no way you could come in and take away his locker. You have to acknowledge Marc and you have to honor Marc because of his impact on the team.”\n\nNorvell has done that this week, meeting with the team’s seniors Monday to discuss Ma. The team will honor him before Saturday’s game, with those who knew Ma saying they would play for him this week.\n\n“Honestly, I think all of our seniors since he’s passed have played for him in some way,” Rush said. “I know that before every game – I don’t know if it’s because of his locker – but a thought of Marc Ma comes back to me before every single game, home or away. I just think that’s how it is for all of our guys who came in during that year. It was a rough, and I think we all dedicated our careers to him.”\n\nAfter Ma died, his teammates described him as a fun-loving, humble guy who was known for a mile-wide smile. His position coach, Bill Teerlinck, said Ma was the reason he loved to coach. He was always on time, always put forth full effort and loved the game. Then-Nevada head coach Brian Polian raved about how his positive attitude rubbed off on the team.\n\n“When you look at his headshot, it does him justice,” Polian said prior to Ma’s celebration of life. “He has that huge grin on his face. I always tell people that every day was a great day for Marc. He was one of those guys who decided, ‘No matter what’s going on in my life, I’m going to be a good place and I’m going to be happy.’ That was Marc. He was never in a funk. He was always happy, always pleasant, always fun to be around, always smiling. He had an unbelievable smile.”\n\nMemories of Ma were passed down to Norvell, who said it was important to honor the former Nevada player this week. Twenty-two players on the Wolf Pack's current roster were teammates of Ma’s during that 2015 season.\n\n“Marc was a player who had really strong relationships with most of our older players,” Norvell said. “It’s important we remember Marc and his family. He would have been on this trip. He would have been a senior. We are going to connect with his family Friday when we’re there. I know it’s important to our kids that we remember him on this trip. I didn’t know Marc. I know he was a walk-on and I know he had a tremendous spirit and that our players had tremendous respect for what he brought to this program.”\n\nMa was only 20 when he died and his body was not initially discovered after the accident. But, in July 2017 a body was found in Lake Tahoe after Ma’s family hired a private contractor, Bruce’s Legacy, which is equipped with a specialized robotic camera system. The body was identified as that of Ma and his remains were returned home.\n\n“He was just a great person, probably the most selfless, humble person you’d ever meet,” Meyer said. “He worked extremely hard and I think if the events that happened not happened, he would have found his way on the field and he would have contributed on the field. He just kind of made everyone a better person by being himself and just being a good person.”\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
