        "text": "The Ron Block Banjo Workshop app is up and running! It has plenty of lessons up for your banjo journey, and more will be continually added. Go to the web app to browse at the Learn tab, or sign up and subscribe at the Plans tab.\n\nWeb app: https://ron-block-banjo-workshop.passion.io/learn/products\n\nAfter signing up, go to the App Store and search “Ron Block Banjo Workshop” and you can sign in to your account.\n\nOr - you can download the app and subscribe through Apple.\n\nFor Android phones, go to Google Play and download the Passion.io app. Search in the app for “Ron Block Banjo Workshop” and you'll find it.\n\nGrowth\n\nI've spent decades looking into ways to continually improve my own playing by studying other players, reading, watching instructional videos, transcribing, and even taking online lessons myself. I've taught lessons and workshops for years. The Ron Block Banjo Workshop app will be the place I share my years of learning with you.\n\nCommunity\n\nThere's a community tab where I'll come in every week to chat and answer questions. It's also the place to give feedback on your experience, your progress. I've spent a lot of time in online discussion on the Banjo Hangout and other places, but there's no place I'd rather talk about banjo than right here.\n\nNow Available\n\n1. Beginner Banjo. Even for intermediate and advanced players, there are some of these short videos you won't want to miss. No tab, just old-fashioned attention, observation, and imitation.\n\n2. Hogan's House of Music. Audio files of my bluegrass banjo instrumental album, with bluegrass luminaries like Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Dan Tyminski, Barry Bales, Stuart Duncan, Sierra Hull, Clay Hess, Sam Bush, Byron House, Tim Crouch, and Lynn Williams. I'll be breaking these down in the near future - for now, check out the Clinch Mountain Backstep lesson for my first two breaks from the album.\n\n3. Bending Strings in a Bluegrass Context. In which I talk about and demonstrate string bending techniques. With printable tab.\n\n4. Developing New Licks and Ideas. I use a solo by Earl Scruggs, break it down, and then use his licks to create new ones. With printable tab.\n\n5. Mini-Lessons. Short little informative bits on attention to detail, dynamics, transcribing, backup, expression, and more. This section will grow and grow.\n\n6. Lesson: Clinch Mountain Backstep. My version of Clinch as played on Hogan's House of Music, first two breaks, with printable tab.\n\n7. Lesson: Man of Constant Sorrow. My solo from the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack, broken down, with printable tab.\n\n8. Lesson: Foggy Mountain Special. My second break from the Earl Scruggs tribute album of the same name, with printable tab.\n\n9. Lesson: The Old Hometown. Earl's original break from the recording, with printable tab.\n\n10. Lesson: You Don't Know My Mind. One of my favorite J.D. Crowe breaks, from a live recording. With printable tab.\n\n11. Banjo Music Videos. Fun videos I've made through the years. This will be another section I’ll be adding to.\n\n12. Short Talks On Music and Life. I did this series of videos after I recorded Hogan's. I'll be adding to these at some point.\n\n13. Creating Melody-Based Solos. The videos for this are being put together - the first two are up!\n\nFuture Lessons\n\n1. From AKUS to Irish - a course on my banjo style with AKUS, and my genre-bending bluegrass/Celtic compositional collaboration with Irish tenor banjo wizard Damien O'Kane.\n\n2. AKUS Backup Banjo - lessons on my backup playing with Alison and the boys.\n\n3. AKUS Songs - individual songs and tunes recorded by AKUS. This will be an ongoing project.\n\n4. Banjophonics and Banjophony - individual tunes recorded with Damien O'Kane. Another ongoing project.\n\n5. Hogan's House of Music - tunes from my bluegrass banjo instrumental album.\n\n6. Live courses! The app can do livestreaming.\n\n7. I'm also open to suggestions!\n\nFor now, thanks again for joining!\n\nBest,\n\nRon\n\nHELLO GUITARISTS!\n\nI've got an Online Guitar Workshop (click here!) available now!\n\nLEVEL: Intermediate to advanced\n\nOBJECTIVE: To help guitarists see new ways to move forward - to give you the tools and ideas that I've used to create my style of playing with Alison Krauss & Union Station so that you can take those tools and more fully develop your own styles of playing. Order link is here: Guitar Workshop\n\nTOPICS: Roots and Inflluences - George Shuffler, Larry Sparks, and Clarence White to blues and country players. We'll move on into some of my solos with Alison throughout the course, but at the front end we'll look into some of the players that helped create the guitar style I use with AKUS, and how I change my playing for other situations.\n\nThe Psychology of Playing Well (this is incredibly important)\n\nRight and Left Hand Technique\n\nTone - Timing - Taste\n\nRhythm Playing\n\nHow I Learned and Continue to Learn the Neck\n\nMake Solos More Moving with Expression\n\nMake Solos More Engaging with Intervals (\"doublestops\")\n\nPlaying the Melody: The Many Ways to Vary a Solo.\n\nCrosspicking\n\nAnd I'll add more before the starting date.\n\nPlus these freebies and more: Downloads of A Light So Fair: Peaceful Guitar Instrumentals; my Hogan's House of Music bluegrass instrumental record (I took quite a few guitar breaks on it); a pdf of my Traditional Guitar Workbook with my personal tabs of George Shuffler, Larry Sparks, Bill Napier, Don Reno, Clarence White, and Junior Blankenship. These freebies alone are worth about $47.\n\nThe Workshop will be held on these days at 7pm Central in 2020: Nov 12, 19, 27, Dec 3. (Nov 26 is Thanksgiving, so that day will be done on Friday, Nov 27).\n\nWhen signing up, you'll get a download link for Hogan's House of Music. I'll be putting all email addresses into a file, and in the next week or so when I get everything into Dropbox I'll be sending out the Zoom link, passwords I'll use for the videos, and the Dropbox link with the outlines, tabs, and freebies.\n\nI'm looking forward to it!\n\n(Photo by Russ Carson)"
