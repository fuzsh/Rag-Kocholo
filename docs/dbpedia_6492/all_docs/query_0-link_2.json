        "text": "Grong Sparebank is a Norwegian savings bank based in Grong. The bank is affiliated with the Eika-Gruppen alliance and has branch offices in Grong, Namsos, Steinkjer and Mosjøen.[1] Total assets are NOK 9,5 billion.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sparebank was founded on April 7, 1862, to serve Grong Parish, that included both Grong, Harran, Høylandet and Røyrvik.[2] By 1905, both Høylandet and Harran wanted to have separate banks, and the bank was split into three branches. In 1955, the bank created a separate branch in Røyrvik and Bergsmo, the later being closed in 1997. The year 1975 saw the merger between Grong Sparebank and Lierne Sparebank, though until 2000 there was a separate board of directors for the Lierne branch. In the 2000s, the bank expanded with a branch in Steinkjer and in 2006 it merged with the smallest bank in Norway, Verran Sparebank in Framverran in Mosvik.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website"
