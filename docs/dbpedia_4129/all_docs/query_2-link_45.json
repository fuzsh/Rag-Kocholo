        "text": "A recreation of a typical Commodore 64 gaming scene in the 1980's.\n\nThe Commodore 64 was introduced in 1982 for $595, a price considered low given it's specs and enabled by Commodore's in house manufacturing.[1][2] The manufacturing price of each commodore 64 was about $135[3] giving Commodore about a $460 margin before shipping, advertising, and other costs are considered.\n\nIn time, the price of the Commodore 64 would drop to $200 and the manufacturing costs of the Commodore 64 would drop to $25.[4]\n\nThe Commodore 64 was discontinued in 1994, with 17 million Commodore 64 computers sold.[1][2]\n\nThe Commodore 64 is powered by the 8-bit MOS Technology 6510 CPU, clocked at 1.023 megahertz in NTSC regions or 0.985 megahertz in PAL regions.[5]\n\nThe Commodore 64 has 64 kilobytes of RAM.[4]\n\nThe Commodore 64 can generate three channels of audio via a SID 6581 chip.[4]\n\nThe only type of media that the Commodore 64 accepts without needing external peripherals are ROM cartridges. Cartridges were mostly used for video games and programming languages, but later also saw (and continue to see) usage for hardware enhancement.\n\nThe system was compatible with the Commodore Datasette tape drive, on which many users relied to load software, both retail, pirate or simply custom-written.\n\nMuch of the software was also distributed on 5Â¼-inches floppy disks to be read by Commodore 1541 or compatible drives, connected to the system through its \"Commodore\" bus. Similarly to previous Commodore disk drives, the 1541s worked like computers on their own, running Commodore DOS to load and save data, as well as interacting with the C64.\n\nNotable Games\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nBad Street Brawler / Street Hassle - A beat up up released on multiple platforms. An early example of a game which allowed players to pet dogs.[6]\n\nCommodore 64\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Commodore 64 computer is built into the keyboard.\n\nAudio output\n\n[edit | edit source]\n\n- This is an example of the Audio capabilities of the SID 6581 chip.\n\n- This is an example of Automatic Mouth speech synthesis output from a Commodore 64."
