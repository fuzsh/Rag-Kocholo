        "text": "Went hard last time, may as well go lunatic this time. Just for reference, that means I can't pick anything related to Mario, Mega Man, Castlevania, Dragon Quest, Metroid, Sonic, Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Ridge Racer, Chrono Trigger, Kirby, or Ninja Turtles.\n\nDay 1 Title Screen: Time Trax - Title Screen [GEN]\n\nGaia Gensouki already got Pictionary, so we're going with another Tim Follin OST. The game was completed and reviews can be found in issues of EGM and GamePro, but it never made it to store shelves. ROMs are available for those interested. Tim Follin also has the 1st comment on this video and gives some insight into the project.\n\nDay 2 Desert Area: Desert Strike - Main Theme [GEN]\n\nIt's only day 2 and we're already bending the rules a little. It's not just a desert area, the whole game takes place in the desert. This theme by Rob Hubbard and Brian Schmidt couldn't sound any more like it came from a Genesis, it's ripping and full of 90's 'tude. The rest of the game sounds like the sound chip just shit all over itself, so don't bother. Fun Fact: This is one of the first game Amy Hennig (writer and creative director of the Soul Reaver series and Uncharted 1, 2, 3) was credited on in 1992.\n\nDay 3 Nintendo Exclusive: Winter Gold - Main Theme [SNES]\n\nI believe this is the last SNES release to feature the FX chip and came out only a couple months before the N64. Solid house track from Jereon Tel, another prolific composer who started out working on the Commodore 64. I think at this point, this list's theme will be \"Great Music From Not So Great Games\".\n\nDay 4 >2010: Snipperclips - Retro Reboot D [NSW]\n\nPlaying this game with my son can be infuriating sometimes, but this swingin' jazzy track sounds like it could be coming right out of Pokemon Pinball on GBC (Which has another stellar OST). Composed bt a relatively young artist named Calum Bowen who also did music for Lovely Plant and Pikuniku.\n\nDay 5 Jazz: Persona 3 - Iwatodai Dorm [PS2]\n\nVery Contemporary Rhythmic jazz, something I'd never listen to in real life, but sounds so cool Persona. And frankly, everyone and everything in the Persona Universe is so much cooler than real life. Music by Shoji Meguro, who's been composing at Atlus for the past 25 years and has done practically every Persona game, and much of SMT as well.\n\nDay 6 Underground: Sub-Terrania - Crystal Space [GEN]\n\nThis track quite complex and really highlights what was possible on the Genesis sound chip. This is some early work by Jasper Kyd, who everyone has heard before even if they don't know it.\n\nDay 7 Indoor: The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle - Building [NES]\n\nThis one will get your toes a tappin', provided by Hiroyuki Masuno. He's already been featured on some other lists with games like Shadowgate, Deja Vu, and Uninvited.\n\nDay 8-bit: Gauntlet III - Title Music [C64]\n\nBreak out the laser lights for this epic intro. Another Tim Follin joint, and one of his last compositions for the Commodore 64.\n\nDay 9 Arranged/Remix: Ys III - Morning of Departure [Various]\n\nAlso known as \"Departure at Sunrise\" depending on the translation, this was originally composed by Mieko Ishikawa and arranged by Junichi Kanezaki for the album Super Arrange Version Ys: Wanderers from Ys. This game was released in the west for the Genesis, SNES, and TurboGrafx-CD in 1991.\n\nDay 10 Water: Ristar - Planet Splash Down 2-1 [GEN]\n\nI would have used something from Ecco the Dolphin, but I think my last has had enough from from Tim Follin (for now). Here is Ristar, a late Genesis release developed in house by Sega and composed by Tomoko Sasaki (NiGHTS series, Sonic Adventure series).\n\nDay 11 Funny: Lego Racers - Build Mode [N64/PC]\n\nNot the best song, but it's silly and dopey. Composed by Eric Nofsinger in his early career before focused on game development with his company High Voltage Software.\n\nDay 12 Awful: Terminator [NES]\n\nThis whole OST is awful, so I linked it's entirety if you care to test it. This was one of the first games Paul Wilkinson composed for so I'll cut some slack, but there's no song progression and very little structure. It's just awful music in an already awful game.\n\nDay 13 Sports: Nintendo World Cup - Title [NES]\n\nAnother peppy fun NES track, this one from composer Kazuo Sawa. He did a lot of work throughout the late 80's to today, including over half a dozen River City games.\n\nDay 14 Boss: River City Ransom - A Tough Fight [NES]\n\nSo here's the boss battle from River City Ransom composed by the previously mentioned Kazuo Sawa.\n\nDay 15 Victory: Breath of Fire 3 - Victory Dance [PS1]\n\nIt's certainly not as iconic as FF VII, but this hip little jazz number at the end of BoF3's battles makes me want to dance. Yoshino Aoki and Akari Kaida, two internal sound designers for Capcom, worked together on this.\n\nDay 16bit: Top Gear - Circuit A [SNES]\n\nAnother good game with an even better soundtrack, Barry Leitch nails it with this one. This game was so revered in Brazil back in the day, it inspired Aquiris Game Studios to create Horizon Chase, which Barry Leitch also composed.\n\nDay 17 Sky: Pilotwings 64 - Birdman [N64]\n\nIt's just so fuckin' smooooth. Really chill track from Dan Hess while you play the free flight mode. I believe this is the only game he's ever worked on.\n\nDay 18 Arcade: DDR 3rdMix - Captain Jack - Captain Jack (Grandale Mix) [ARC]\n\nThe only reason my friends and I even knew who Captain Jack was because of DDR at the local bowling alley, so I'm counting it here.\n\nDay 19 Inspired By: Wild Arms - Overworld Theme [PS1]\n\nIt's not surprising that a lot of this RPG with a wild west setting features music \"inspired\" by Ennio Morricone's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This particular track is a rip of Ecstacy of Gold.\n\nDay 20 Sega Exclusive: Mr. Bones - Guitar Solo [SAT]\n\nThis is kind of a weird one. So this level of the game requires to to string together different riffs with each riff tied to a different controller button and this is one of the better ones I've heard. The whole game features music by famed blues rock guitarist Ronnie Montrose.\n\nDay 21 Fighting: Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 - Carnival Stage [DC]\n\nThis is one of the most iconic fighting game songs for me. Composed by Tetsuya Shibata and Mitsuhiko Takano, this whole soundtrack features a horn based jazz mix that was originally panned by reviewers, but I love it.\n\nDay 22 Ambient: Resident Evil 7 - Save Room [PS4/X1]\n\nThis is supposed to be a safe place, but this music is still super unsettling, great job by Akiyuki Morimoto, Miwako Chinone, and Satoshi Hori.\n\nDay 23 Industrial: Brawl Brothers - Rooftop Battle [SNES]\n\nHalf this game takes place in industrial areas, but this is probably the best track, even though it's a bit all over the place. This one was composed by Atsuyoshi Isemura and Hajime Uchida.\n\nDay 24 32/64bit: Goemon's Great Adventure - Edo Castle [N64]\n\nThis game had too many credited composers to list, but this track (as much of the OST) has a real successful mix of eastern and western influences.\n\nDay 25 Techno: Waterworld - Mission 2 Theme [SNES]\n\nAdd another to the \"not great game with great music\" list. Composed by Dean Evans, this track leans more on the chill side of the techno spectrum. This link is to the original composer's youtube posting with lots of interesting comments.\n\nDay 26 Fire/Volcano: The Little Mermaid - Underwater Volcano [NES]\n\nThis track by Yasyuaki Fujita doesn't really have the flavor of a fire/volcano level, I assure you there is red stone and flying fire balls everywhere.\n\nDay 27 Scary: Silent Hill 2 - The Darkness that Lurks in Our Minds [PS2/Xbox]\n\nThis track by Arika Yamaoka is more atmospheric than a structured song, but it's creepy none the less; not surprising coming from a Silent Hill game.\n\nDay 28 Final Boss: Eternal Sonata - Scrap and Build Ourselves [PS3/X360]\n\nChopin is one of my favorite classical composers, and for those who don;t know, this whole game is inspired by and shaped around his life and music. This is an arrangement by Motoi Sakuraba and performed by pianist Stanislav Bunin.\n\nDay 29/30 Ending/Credits: Game Boy Camera: Credits [GB]\n\nKind of a cheat as this was originally a song by Hip Tanaka for Mother (which is a series I used already) on NES, but since North merica didn't get it, this is the first time we heard it.\n\nhttps://www.videogamesage.com/topic/3848-31-day-video-game-music-challenge-june-2020/\n\nEdited November 2, 2020 by Aguy\n\nI decided that I wanted to do something a bit different for this challenge. Instead of picking original songs, I'm going to pick covers and remixes of video game music. This was inspired by having a super long day 19 from the last challenge. Now, a large portion of the remixes I'm familiar with come from the games I'm most comfortable with (your Zeldas, Marios, Undertale, etc.), so I'm going to make my own difficulty rules. To keep the arrangements themselves diverse, I'm not going to reuse any cover artists / arrangers. So without further ado, let's get started.\n\nDay 1 (Title music): The First Look at Gold - RebeccaETripp - The Legend of Zelda (Title), this category was a bit tough. I didn't have a whole lot of remixes that fit. I settled on this song from RebeccaETripp. It's good but not my favorite from her (that would be Divine Princess of Destiny from aLttP). Honorable mention: Heroes Fall - housethegrate - Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (Almost picked this but decided not to because it covers other songs as well), Legend of Zelda Intro Live! - ConSoul - The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario 3D World 8 Bit Remix - Bulby - Super Mario 3D World (My favorite, but I'm saving Bulby)\n\nDay 2 (Desert area): Lullaby of the Desert - Rodok - The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Gerudo Valley), I could not think of a desert area with memorable music with the exception of Gerudo Valley. So, my pick and honorable mentions are all Gerudo Valley remixes. Now I have a high bar for Gerudo Valley remixes and have heard many that I don't like, but this stood out for being a bit different. I really like how they turned it into a haunting ballad. Honorable mention: Gerudo Valley - Orchestral Jazz Big Band Version - The 8-Bit Big Band - OoT (a really good but more standard Gerudo Valley remix), Gerudo Desert Party - Reuben Spiers - OoT (I can't place why this song makes it above the fold for me, it's probably the jazzy accordion)\n\nDay 3 (Nintendo): The Legend of Zelda Suite - Japan Game Music Orchestra (JAGMO) - The Legend of Zelda Series (various), this is a very generic category for me as most of my remixes are Nintendo related. So, I decided I should pick a orchestral series wide suite as those don't fit well into other categories. With that criteria, I picked my favorite video game music orchestra covering my favorite series. JAGMO also has several other great suites. Honorable mention: The Legend of Zelda Suite - Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra (SCORE) - TLoZ (I also like SCORE so here's their Zelda suite), Super Mario Suite - JAGMO, Super Mario Suite - SCORE (JAGMO and SCORE also have Super Mario Suites), All of the music from Symphony of the Goddesses (I've seen them in concert and loved them)\n\nDay 4 (2010s): UNDERTALE Medley - Senzoku Game Music Brass - UNDERTALE (various), I decided to do a similar thing as Day 3. When I think of music from the 2010s, the game that comes first to my mind is Undertale. There are a lot of Undertale remixes (and specifically so many Megalovania covers). But just like Day 3, I decided on picking an orchestral suite. This medley from Senzoku Game Music Brass certainly covers a lot of the soundtrack and the band seems pretty good (recording quality could be a little better but it's not the worst). Honorable mention: Symphonic Gamers 3 - Undertale - JAGMO (another good JAGMO suite), Glitterbomb - LongBoxofChocolate, Philippe Delage - Undertale, Spooktune - LemonDrop - Undertale, Megalovania - ConSoul - Undertale, Fallen Down - Jackson Alexander Parodi - Undertale, Detritus (Ruins) - Sean Schafianski - Undertale, Dummy! - Thomas Kresge - Undertale, La Historia de Abajo - Thennecan - Undertale, The Legend - The Game Brass - Deltarune (and one Deltarune remix for fun)\n\nDay 5 (Jazz): Tetris / Korobeiniki - Fast Ragtime Piano Cover - Dave Wave, another very wide category for me. I love Jazz, so a lot of my remixes are Jazz remixes. I ended up picking this really well done ragtime Tetris cover. I love ragtime and Korobeiniki is a great target for remixes. Honorable mention: Fleaman's Groove - Nostalvania - Castlevania, Frosty Britches - LongBoxofChocolate - Super Mario 64, Bros with Dix - Nase - Super Mario Bros., The Guru - Wiesty, The OC Jazz Collective - Ocarina of Time, several of the Undertale remixes from yesterday\n\nDay 6 (Underground area): Link Goes to New Orleans - Neskvartetten - The Legend of Zelda (Dungeon), similar to the desert day only two songs came to mind. Super Mario Bros' Underground and Zelda 1's Dungeon music. However, most of the songs that use these seem to only use them for part of the song. My pick was the only one I liked that was entirely based on an Underground song. Honorable mention: Big-Band Battlefield - The University of Toronto 10 O'Clock Big Band - Super Mario 64 (only uses SMB Underground briefly), Bros with Dix from yesterday also only uses it briefly\n\nDay 7 (Indoor area): Thelonius Temple - MC - Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (Temple), I had some trouble figuring out what exactly Indoor area means. My first thought was OoT's or Zelda 2's house theme, but I didn't find any remixes I liked. Branching out a bit more, I figured the temples in Zelda 2 are indoor areas. So, with that decided I picked this really nice jazz cover of Zelda 2's Temple music. Interestingly it's one of OCR's first remixes, number 82 from 2000. Honorable mention: \"Luigi's Mansion\" Brass Ensemble with Theremin - The Game Brass (A mansion is indoors I guess. This has an awesome music video btw), While the Wind Fish Sleeps - bGevko - Link's Awakening (the covered song is listed as House by the Bay but sounds like Mabe Village as well (They are very similar))\n\nDay 8 (8-bit): World Bowser 8 Bit Remix - Bulby - Super Mario 3D World, there was two ways I could go with this category: modern covers of 8-bit songs or 8-bit styled covers of any song. I decided the latter would be more fun. With that established, there is only one choice for the artist, Bulby. He is my favorite pure 8-bit cover artist. Honorable mention: Ghost Fight 8 Bit Remix - Bulby - Undertale, Steam Gardens 8 Bit Remix - Super Mario Odyssey (two more Bulby remixes), the rest of my picks are more \"chiptune\" then pure 8-bit, Wicked Chip - Erik Vreven, Jorito - Vampire Killer, Linear Groove - Ben Briggs - Tetris, First Time on Outset - halc - The Wind Waker, Technicolor Thunderstorm - Lemonectric - A Link to the Past, Face Your Nightmares - Lemonectric - Link's Awakening, Thunderstruck - Big Giant Circles, Jeff Ball - Ocarina of Time\n\nI've been trying to figure out what I should do with day 9. I can't think of anything obvious that's a remix of a remix, and inverting to just by an original track is way to wide open. So, I think I'm settling on saving this category as a wild card pick for the end. That will still fit the rules and let me feature someone who I think deserves it, but I wasn't able to find a category that fit right.\n\nDay 9 (Remix): Zelda Twilight Princess - Hyrule Field on Marimba - Mart0zz, so this is a very unusual group. All their songs are three dudes on a marimba (plus some other mostly percussion instruments). They have been putting out songs (mostly Zelda covers) since 2009 at a rate of one per year. Although it's not the type of instrumentation I normally prefer, I do like their songs. TP Hyrule Field is probably my favorite of theirs and is also why it is my favorite Hyrule Field song as well. Honorable mention: Zelda Breath of the Wild - Main Theme on Marimba - Mart0zz (another great Mart0zz), Catch Me - RoeTaKa - Shovel Knight, The Peddler's Legacy - Vurez - Tetris, Dreams of Home - Chris ~ Amaterasu, waltzforluma - Link's Awakening (my top 3 OCR songs that I haven't mentioned elsewhere in this list)\n\nDay 10 (Water area): Waterfall - Charles Ritz (feat. Multiplayer Fusion Ensemble) - Undertale, this a fun Undertale cover written for a charity album. Not much else to say. Honorable mention: Soggy Carousel - worldsbestgrandpa - Ocarina of Time (I almost made this my pick because I love the accordion), Aquatic Interlude - Brad Smith - Super Mario Bros. (a classic), Hoy, Small Fry! - HyperDuck SoundWorks - The Wind Waker, Mega Man 1 \"Ice Man\" Brass Quintet Cover - The Game Brass (I mean ice is just frozen water)\n\nDay 11 (Funny): Undertale - Bonetrousle (Papyrus Battle Theme)... KAZOO'd! - Tsuko G., I couldn't think of anything for this category for awhile (well I did think of one right away, but I'm saving that artist). But then I remembered KAZOO'd. I don't think a kazoo ensemble could possibly not be funny. The same guys has 90+ kazoo covers, but this one is my favorite. Honorable mention: Mii Channel - Otamatone Cover - TheRealSullyG (thought of this one later, was used last challenge by AsteralSoul), \"Bowsette\" New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe Brass Quintet - The Game Brass, Hi, We're the GameCube - The Game Brass, Chrono Trigger \"Wind Scene\" Wind Quintet Cover (not Brass!) - The Game Brass (these three were April fools jokes, I really like them but I'm saving The Game Brass)\n\nDay 12 (Awful): Funk Fiction - Sun's Song - The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I wasn't really sure what to do for this one. There are plenty of songs I don't like, but just because I don't like them doesn't mean they're not awful. At the same time I'm sure there are a bunch of really crappy covers all over youtube (search \"popular song\" + \"recorder\", for example), but I don't think that really fits the spirit of this category. In the end, I just went with a Zelda EDM album that I remembered seeing previously. I don't like EDM much so I could have picked any song in that album, but I just listed the first.\n\nDay 13 (Sports): Dat Yugo - UV Sir J - Indy 500 (Arcade), this category took forever to figure out. I don't play many sports games and had no remixes in my library. Eventually, I realized that racing games could count as sports games. So, my go to was to look for Mario Kart remixes, but I didn't really find anything I liked. Eventually after going through OCR I found an album about Sega Racing games and the song I liked the most was Dat Yugo. Honorable mention: Let's Play LIVE #2 - Mario Kart 64 w/FULL ORCHESTRA! - The 8-Bit Big Band (An interesting concept of playing music over \"live\" gameplay), Out Run \"Passing Breeze\" Brass and Rhythm - The Game Brass (feat. ConSoul)\n\nDay 14 (Boss): Dummy! - Thomas Kresge - Undertale, so this might be a bit of a cheat. I'm planning on using The Game Brass later and there is a lot of overlap between the performers, but it's different enough to not be exactly the same. Either way I really like both the source material and rearrangement of it. I love jazz banjo and clarinet. Honorable mention: Boss Battle Medley - Symphony of the Goddesses - Zelda (Various) (I nearly picked this, but Zelda boss themes are not my favorite), Metal Crusher - David Peacock, Augustine Mayuga Gonzales - Undertale, Spider Dance - David Peacock, Augustine Mayuga Gonzales - Undertale (I usually don't care much for piano only covers but these two are well produced), The World Revolving (From \"Deltarune\") - The Game Brass (Saving The Game Brass for later), Ghost Fight 8 Bit Remix - Bulby - Undertale (Already used Bulby)\n\nDay 15 (Victory): A Timely Victory - Lemonectric - Chrono Cross, literally the only victory theme cover I could find that I somewhat like. It isn't my favorite, but the problem is more with the source material than the actual mix.\n\nDay 16 (16-bit): Come to the Dark Side, It's a Funky Place - Nostalvania - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, for the 8-bit day I picked an 8-bit styled song, but for this category their aren't a whole lot of pure 16-bit styled songs. Instead I went with the other interpretation of a cover of a 16-bit song. Of course my go to was a aLttP song. Honorable mention: Technicolor Thunderstorm - Lemonectric - A Link to the Past (I originally picked this one, but went back on it when I finally found one for day 15), The Triforce of Sorrow - Doc Nano, Denis Bluteau, Jeff Ball, Kristin Naigus - A Link to the Past, Zelda: A Link to the Past \"Hyrule Castle\" Brass Quintet Cover - The Game Brass (another aLttP one for good measure), Super Mario World \"Ghost House\" Brass Ensemble - The Game Brass, Athletic Theme from Yoshi's Island - Big Band Jazz Version - The 8-Bit Big Band\n\nDay 17 (Sky): Lullaby of the Sky - Jillian Aversa, zircon - The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, another hard category. I thought there would be more Skyward Sword remixes that I liked, but I didn't find any.\n\nDay 18 (Arcade): Classic Video Games Medley | Orchestral Cover - VGOScore - Various Arcade Games, I don't have many remixes that feature arcade games, but this one alone features a dozen or so (including pong, lol). My favorite one is at 1:47. Honorable mention: I only found one other I like, but I'm saving it for another category\n\nDay 19 (Samples): Luigi's Mansion Theme - Classic Big Band Swing Version - The 8-Bit Big Band, there are a lot of remixes that reference other video game songs, so for this category I think it makes sense to only include songs that samples or is heavily inspired by a non video game song. I think there are still a lot of remixes that fit this criteria, but I'm horrible at identifying references. The one exception was my pick, it is very obviously inspired by Benny Goodman's \"Sing Sing Sing\". Although I couldn't think of many others, I really like this arrangement. Honorable mention: Wii Shop Channel Music but it's Austin Powers - The 8-Bit Big Band (another 8-Bit Big Band remix), Wii Shop Bling (the previous honorable mention reminded me of this)\n\nDay 20 (Sega): Gotta Start from Somewhere - Jorito, Hank \"The Spank Tank\" Jankerson, Trev Wignall, The Nikanoru - Sonic the Hedgehog, Not my favorite remix. I didn't have a whole lot, and the ones I liked the most are by bands I'm using elsewhere. Honorable mention: Spring Yard Zone - New Jack Swing Big Band Version - The 8-Bit Big Band - Sonic the Hedgehog, Castlevania: Bloodlines \"The Sinking Old Sanctuary\" Brass Quintet (feat. @Doug Perry) - The Game Brass\n\nDay 21 (Fighting): Guiles Theme (from \"street fighter 2\") - ConSoul, by far my favorite fighting game song. Combined with a great jazz arrangement makes for a great remix. There is nothing more to say. Honorable mention: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Menu 8 Bit Remix - Bulby (There are probably more Smash Bros. remixes, but this is the only one I remember of the top of my head), \"Lifelight\" SSBU - 664 Member Orchestra Version - The 8-Bit Big Band Virtual Community Orchestra (jk, I remembered this one as well)\n\nDay 22 (Ambient): Reflecting Pool - JohnStacy - Super Mario Bros., I normally don't care much for ambient music. It's fine to listen to in the background, but it doesn't really do much for me. So, I might as well go for something a bit more weird and avant garde. I'll be honest, the other reason I picked this is it's a french horn choir which is my primary instrument. If you are confused how this matches the source material, try playing it at 2x speed, or better yet listen to it at ~9x speed (posted by the composer in the YouTube comments). Honorable mention: Aquatic Ambiance - Big Band Jazz Piano ft. Smart Game Piano - The 8-Bit Big Band - Donkey Kong Country (I feel like this is a lot of peoples go to ambient song. I don't care much for it, but this is a good arrangement at least)\n\nDay 23 (Industrial): Chemical Blip - Anti-Syne - Sonic the Hedgehog 2, the first games that came to mind were the sonic games (Scrap Brain Zone and Chemical Plant Zone). I didn't like most of what I found, but this one was okay. Honorable mention: Nine Inch Super Mushrooms - bLiNd, Chimpazilla - Super Mario World (for fun I also looked at the industrial tag on OCR. I don't like industrial music, but this one was also okay)\n\nDay 24 (32/64-bit): Village of Shadows - Eric Buchholz - The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, this is a nice orchestral Kokiri village cover. The album that this is from is pretty solid but doesn't have a whole lot of standouts. Honorable mention: Soggy Carousel - worldsbestgrandpa - Ocarina of Time (I nearly picked this one for day 10 and this day), Frosty Britches - LongBoxofChocolate - Super Mario 64 (fun holiday remix), The Guru - Wiesty, The OC Jazz Collective - Ocarina of Time (another good song of storms cover), Termina's Last Hope - Fredrik Häthén - Majora's Mask (an orchestral Majora's Mask arrangement), Zelda: Majora's Mask \"Pirates' Fortress\" Brass Quintet Cover (from Materia Collective's FATE) - The Game Brass (The Game Brass also has a nice Majora's Mask remix)\n\nDay 25 (Techno): First Time on Outset - halc - The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, I'm not great with music genres, so I'm going with anything that's marked as one of the EDM categories in OCR. As I've said previously, I don't like EDM, but this song is enough on the periphery that I enjoy it. Honorable mention: Technicolor Thunderstorm - Lemonectric - A Link to the Past (I almost picked this for a second time, but remembered I couldn't use it on day 16 because I used another Lemonectric song on day 15), Psy Castle - B-laze - Super Mario World (I feel like I should hate this song based on the musical stylings, but I actually kinda like it)\n\nDay 26 (Fire): Sugar, Water, Purple - Shnabubula - Metroid, I wouldn't have thought that this category wouldn't be that hard, but I could not seem to find anything I liked. Eventually, I thought to check for Norfair remixes and found this one. It's a really nice piano solo. Apparently, it was entirely improvised, which blows my mind a little.\n\nDay 27 (Scary): Koopa vs. Kefka - Dhsu - Super Mario World & Final Fantasy VI, I choose to interpret this category more as eerie since I don't think many songs are outright scary on their own. My pick is a mashup of SMW's Sub Castle music mixed with FFVI's Dancing Mad. The song starts of as ominous piano, but shifts to menacing when the organ is introduced. Honorable mention: Monstrous Turtles! - zircon - Super Mario World (another SMW Sub Castle remix), Gaster's Legacy - DS - Undertale (and now some ominous Undertale on piano), Termina's Last Hope - Fredrik Häthén - Majora's Mask (eerie orchestral), Spooktune - LemonDrop - Undertale, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Spooky Skirmish for Wind Quintet - Medllix (I'm not sure how scary the last two are, but they both have spooky in the name so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ), and last but not least the entire album Brasslevania: A Tribute to the Video Game Macabre by The Game Brass (I mean it's a Halloween themed video game album. Here's a few more good songs I haven't mentioned on this list yet: Spirit of Hospitality (From \"Celeste\"), Final Fantasy VI \"Phantom Train\", Grim Fandango Suite (feat. Mariachi Entertainment System))\n\nDay 28 (Final Boss): Symphony of Power - Sam Dillard - The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I like a lot of the remixes by Sam Dillard, but I couldn't find a category that fit. So, I was going to use by wildcard pick. But, after going through his album, Zelda Cinematica: A Symphonic Tribute, I realized that this song was of the ganondorf fight (which I guess is technically the penultimate boss, but let's just say it's the first phase). Honorable mention: Great King of Evil - Eric Buchholz - Ocarina of Time, Megalovania (from \"Undertale\") - ConSoul, Undertale - Megalovania on Marimba - Mart0zz (Of course I had to include a couple Meglovanias)\n\nDay 29 (Ending): Legend of Zelda ending theme \"Brierized\" on piano - Tom Brier, I deemed that any song that plays over the credits and isn't named \"ending\" as a credits theme. So, of course my two favorite ending themes are Zelda 1 and SML1. I couldn't find anything I liked for SML1, and I was struggling to find something I liked for Zelda 1 until I stumbled across the Tom Brier version again. Tom Brier is a brilliant ragtime pianist, and my understanding is a friend of his occasionally arranges video game songs for him to sight read (yes, that song was sight read). In particular the Zelda 1 ending theme lends itself very well to be preformed in ragtime. Honorable mention: Super Mario World Ending Theme sight-read - Tom Brier, Super Mario Land 2 Ending Theme sight-read - Tom Brier (two more Tom Brier ending themes), The Triforce of Sorrow - Doc Nano, Denis Bluteau, Jeff Ball, Kristin Naigus - A Link to the Past (a cover of the Triforce Chamber theme. I nearly picked this one but opted to feature Tom Brier)\n\nDay 30 (Credits): A Happy Ending? (From \"Splatterhouse\") - The Game Brass, If you haven't figured it out already, The Game Brass is probably my favorite video game cover band. Being a brass player, I've always loved brass covers of video game music, and The Game Brass has really well produced and well arranged brass covers. I picked the original song in the last challenge, so I might as well just copy that write-up for the song description. \"I did not know basically anything about this game until very recently (I still haven't played it, but now I want to) when I heard a cover of it (which is great and you should listen to as well). Most of the soundtrack for this game is more along the lines of intense horror. But the ending track subverts this with a very subtle, haunting tune with a melody taken from when you meet Jennifer (see the plot for more context).\" Honorable mention: Epilogue ~ End Credits - Eric Buchholz - Ocarina of Time (a nice orchestral arrangement of the OoT credits)\n\nEdited November 1, 2020 by 0xDEAFC0DE\n\nIT'S FINALLY HERE! Hell yes I'm in!\n\nI'll also go ahead and go with Hard difficulty again, as that felt like a good sweet spot for me last time.\n\nMy 30 Day VGM Challenge List II - Hard Difficulty\n\nDay 1: (Title Screen) | Opening - The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks\n\nI think I'm going to try and make it a pattern to use Legend of Zelda Title Screens on the first days of these challenges until I run out of themes to use, just for some level of consistency among my lists. This one's very nostalgic for me, as Spirit Tracks was the very first game I ever got on launch day.\n\nDay 2: (Desert) | Desert - Terraria\n\nAnother song I'm very nostalgic for, with Terraria being one of my favorite games and all. One of my personal favorite desert themes from any game.\n\nHonorable mention:\n\nTostarena: Ruins - Super Mario Odyssey (I probably would've used this one instead, but I'm trying to avoid re-using too many games from my previous list so I can save them up for later. This one's my secondary pick, though.)\n\nDay 3: (Nintendo Exclusive) | Magmoor Caverns - Metroid: Samus Returns\n\nFigured this would be a good pick, given the semi-recent triumphant return of the Metroid series. I've only ever played Zero Mission and a bit of Super Metroid myself, but I've very familiar with the soundtracks to most of the games.\n\nHonorable mention:\n\nSurface of SR388 - Metroid: Samus Returns (One of my favorite overworld themes from any of the Metroid games)\n\nDay 4: (Recent Game) | Metallic Madness Zone Act 1 - Sonic Mania\n\nFigured I'd go with a song from one of my favorite games in recent years, Sonic Mania.\n\nDay 5: (Jazz) | It's Raining Somewhere Else - Undertale\n\nOne of my favorite tracks from a game I look back on very fondly.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nJump Up, Super Star! - Super Mario Odyssey\n\nStudiopolis Act 1 - Sonic Mania\n\nWhite Collar Crime - Payday 2 (Was very close to selecting this one instead, you should give it a listen)\n\nDay 6: (Underground) | Underground Theme - New Super Mario Bros. Wii\n\nI mean, how could I not? All variations of this theme are classics.\n\nHonorable mention:\n\nUnderground - Terraria (I'm much more nostalgic for this one personally, but I already used Terraria in this list, can't use it again.)\n\nDay 7: (Indoor) | Inside a House - The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\n\nMight as well go for the classic, right?\n\nHonorable mention:\n\nHome - Undertale\n\nDay 8: (8-bit) | Bloody Tears - Castlevania II\n\nHad to sneak some Castlevania music in this list somehow, now seemed like a good time.\n\nDay 9: (Cover) | Woods of Mystery (Lost Woods) by Theophany - The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask | (Original by Koji Kondo)\n\nOne of my absolute favorite covers of all time. In hindsight, I'm glad this was relegated to my honorable mentions last time, since that means I can use it this time around. Plus it gives me an excuse to use another Zelda track.\n\nHonorable mentions go to all of Theophany's work, as well as all the other artists I mentioned last time around. Seriously incredible stuff, check out Theophany's channel if you liked this cover, all of his stuff is absolutely amazing, and he's working on the OST for a brand new game as well. About time too, he's ridiculously talented.\n\nDay 10: (Water Area) | Into the Unknown - Subnautica\n\nThe ultimate water area music, since the entire game takes place in an unexplored alien sea! Seriously fantastic game as well, highly recommend it. One of my favorite survival-type video games, and one of the few that actually has a great story as well.\n\nDay 11: (Funny) | Armogohma Battle Second Half - The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\n\nIt's worth using up one of my game repeats for this song. Absolute classic.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nTemmie Village - Undertale (One of my personal favorites, and what I probably would've used for this day if I hadn't already used an Undertale song)\n\nTem Shop - Undertale\n\nCan You Really Call This A Hotel, I Didn't Receive A Mint On My Pillow Or Anything - Undertale (OK, this one's only funny because of the title, but I mean... c'mon, I had to include it)\n\nChecker Dance - Deltarune\n\nLancer - Deltarune\n\nRouxls Kaard - Deltarune\n\nThose last two are only really funny if you know the characters they're associated with, but... well, if you know, you know.\n\n.....ᵀʰᵒᵘˢᵗ ᶠᵒᵒˡˢᵎ\n\nDay 12: (Music I Hate) | Mappy Medley - Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\n\nI don't care if this is cheating.\n\nDay 13: (Sports) | Main Theme - ARMS\n\nOK, this is probably cheating, but I mean... listen.\n\nIt may be a fictional sport, but it's still technically a sport, so technically ARMS counts as a sports game, right?\n\n...right...?\n\nHonorable mention: (and alternative pick in case ARMS is cheating)\n\nMain Theme - Punch-Out!! (Wii)\n\nDay 14: (Boss) | Gladiator - DOOM Eternal\n\nI guess every one of my lists is going to have a slightly uncharacteristic metal song now.\n\nEh, oh well.\n\nKAR! EN! TUK!\n\nDay 15: (Victory/Clear) | All Clear - Castlevania Chronicles\n\nNot much to say about this one, just a really solid victory theme, and probably my favorite out of all the various stage clear themes in the Castlevania franchise.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nStage Clear - Castlevania Chronicles\n\nStage Clear - Castlevania: Dracula X\n\nEnding - Castlevania: Dracula X (This one I'm super nostalgic for. This plays during a short cutscene right after you beat the final boss, Dracula, but before the credits, so I think this would technically count as a victory theme)\n\nStage Clear - Sonic Mania\n\nGreat Victory! - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\n\nBoss Victory Fanfare - The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds\n\nVictory Fanfare - Final Fantasy VI\n\nAnd there was one more I was thinking of, but I forgot it in the course of making this list of honorable mentions and I'm kicking myself for it. Oh well.\n\nDay 16: (16-bit) | Fear Factory - Donkey Kong Country\n\nI was really spoiled for choice on this day. I would've liked to have used a track from DKC3, but I already plan on doing that on one of the later days. So I figured, what the hell, why not give the original some love.\n\nHonorable mentions: (This one's gonna be a doozy)\n\nHyrule Field - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\n\nHyrule Castle - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\n\nDark World - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\n\nBlack Mist (Death Mountain) - The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\n\nAquatic Ambiance - Donkey Kong Country\n\nLife in the Mines - Donkey Kong Country\n\nGangplank Galleon - Donkey Kong Country\n\nThe entire Donkey Kong Country 2 OST because the entire thing is a masterpiece\n\nTreetop Tumble - Donkey Kong Country 3\n\nRockface Rumble - Donkey Kong Country 3 (One of my absolute favorite DKC tracks)\n\nSimon's Theme - Super Castlevania IV\n\nBloody Tears - Super Castlevania IV\n\nThe entire Castlevania: Dracula X OST, another masterpiece IMO\n\nStage 1 - Contra III: The Alien Wars\n\nStage 2 - Contra III: The Alien Wars\n\nStage 4 - Contra III: The Alien Wars\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 1,\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2, &\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles OSTs, they're all classics\n\nAlso, I remembered the Victory themes I was thinking of yesterday that I had forgotten!\n\nDixie & Diddy Kong's Victory Themes - Donkey Kong Country 2\n\nStage Clear - Contra III: The Alien Wars\n\nDay 17: (Sky Area) | Cloud Tops - The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap\n\nOne of my favorite tracks from one of the most underrated and underappreciated entries in one of my favorite series. Can't really go wrong there I'd say!\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nPalace of Winds - The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap\n\nThe Sky - The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword\n\nCloudtop Cruise - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\n\nSky Sanctuary (Modern) - Sonic Generations (One of my favorite tracks from the whole Sonic series)\n\nDay 18: (Arcade) | Main Theme - Space Ace\n\nTo be completely honest, I know very little about the actual game this theme comes from, I've just heard it a few times offhandedly and I really love it. Never been much of an arcade guy personally, so it took me a little while to come up with a good selection for this day.\n\nDay 19: (Samples/Inspired) | Ice Cap Zone Act 1 - Sonic 3\n\nSampled Song: Hard Times - The Jetzons\n\nCombined version of both songs to show just how similar they are\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of this sort of thing I'd say. Don't even really have to point out the similarities, they're virtually identical. There's a whole story behind this involving Michael Jackson originally working on the soundtrack to Sonic 3, Brad Buxer, MJ's keyboardist was involved in the OST as well, Brad worked on this originally unreleased Jetzons song before working on the OST, there's too much to cover in a short paragraph. Here's a very, very interesting and good video covering the entire topic around the bizarre history of Sonic 3's OST and Michael Jackson's involvement with it.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nStardust Speedway Present JP/EU - Sonic CD (0:55 in particular)\n\nSampled Song: Walk the Walk - Shakatak (0:14 in particular. Very good song, actually)\n\nAs well as pretty much the entire DOOM OST, tons of tracks in that soundtrack are very heavily inspired by other songs. Here's a comparison video that lists the many examples of this throughout DOOM's OST.\n\nDay 20: (Sega Exclusive) | Iron-Blue Intention - Castlevania: Bloodlines\n\nHonestly never been a huge fan of the Genesis' sound engine, but it can definitely produce some gems for sure. Didn't want to go with the obvious pick of another Sonic song, so I decided instead to choose a song from one of the only other Genesis games I've ever really played: Castlevania: Bloodlines, probably one of the least well-known classic CV games. Fun fact, this game is actually very significant in that this was the very first Castlevania game Michiru Yamane ever composed for! Very glad she was picked for this game and all the others after it, Castlevania just wouldn't be the same without her outstanding music.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nReincarnated Soul - Castlevania: Bloodlines\n\nAs well as all 3 of the original Sonic OSTs, as I've already mentioned.\n\nDay 21: (Fighting Game) | Jogging/Countdown - Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\n\nUsing Super Smash Bros for this category is definitely bordering on cheating since there's so many different songs to choose from, but hey, it's one of the only fighting series I've ever really played I would've liked to have used a song from one of the Punch-Out!! games, but I think of fighting games as multiplayer focused games, and the Punch-Out!! series is primarily single player, so I think it doesn't quite count as a fighting game in the traditional sense.\n\nDay 22: (Ambient) | Track 2 - Universe Sandbox ²\n\nSpeaks for itself, really. Absolutely beautiful soundtrack for a beautiful game. Really fits the wonder and beauty of space.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nMesos - Owlboy\n\nAquatic Ambience - Donkey Kong Country\n\nThe Wind Can Be Still - Stardew Valley\n\nDay 23: (Industrial) | Nuts & Bolts - Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!\n\nBeen looking forward to this day for awhile. One of my favorite DKC tracks, I could listen to this track all day and never get bored of it.\n\nDay 24: (32-64-bit) | Requiem for the Gods - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nFigured I might as well go with one of my favorite tracks from one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. Love this song so much.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nDracula's Castle - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nWood Carving Partita - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nCrystal Teardrops - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nRainbow Cemetery - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nLost Painting - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nWandering Ghosts - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nThe Tragic Prince - Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\n(I really like the Symphony of the Night soundtrack, if you couldn't tell )\n\nDay 25: (Techno) | Electrodrome - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\n\nLots of good techno-sounding tracks to choose from, but this is the track that immediately came to mind when thinking about what I should use for this day, personally.\n\nDay 26: (Fire) | Lower Norfair - Super Metroid\n\nDespite the fact that I haven't played very much Metroid, for some reason Norfair is the first place I think of when it comes to lava areas in video games.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nMagmoor Caverns - Metroid Prime\n\nLethal Lava Land - Super Mario 64\n\nFire Temple - The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\n\nLava Reef Zone Act 1 - Sonic Mania\n\nLava Reef Zone Act 2 - Sonic Mania\n\nDay 27: (Scary/Startling) | For this day, I actually have two different selections. 1 for Scary, & 1 for Startling. If I have to stick by the traditional rules of only having one main selection for each day, then consider the Scary selection the main one, and the Startling selection a secondary one.\n\n(Scary) | Children's Room - Fatal Frame/Project Zero\n\n!!! VOLUME WARNING !!! (Startling) | Medical Treatment - Fatal Frame/Project Zero 4: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse !!! VOLUME WARNING !!!\n\nSo, for those that don't know, the Fatal Frame series (AKA Project Zero, or simply Zero overseas) is a survival horror game series in which you exorcise ghosts with a camera. Sounds kinda goofy in concept, but man, in my personal opinion, the Fatal Frame series is one of the most shit your pants scary horror game series in existence. I'm in the process of replaying the first one, and man, playing that game still unsettles me to the core, despite how familiar I am with it (I've known about the series since I was a child.)\n\nSo, now that we have the context for the series out of the way, time for a fun fact! If you listen closely in the Children's Room song, you can hear children faintly chanting some kind of a song. Unless you can speak Japanese, you likely won't underatand what they're saying, and that's because they're singing the lyrics to a Japense children's game. The lyrics are as follows:\n\nKagome Kagome Kago no naka no Tori wa\n\nItsu Itsu deyaru? Yoake no ban ni\n\nTsuru to Kame ga subetta.\n\nUshiro no shoumen dare?\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\nKagome, Kagome, the bird in the cage,\n\nwhen will you come out?\n\nIn the evening of the dawn,\n\nthe crane and turtle slipped.\n\nWho stands right behind you now?\n\nFor context on what this actually means: \"Kagome, Kagome is a popular Japanese children's game, similar to the European games 'Ring Around The Rosie' or 'Poor Mary'. To play, a child who was 'it' (called the 'oni' or 'demon') would stand or sit with their eyes covered, encircled by four or more other children. The children in the circle would then dance around in a circle singing the song. When the song finished, the child in the middle would have to guess the identity of the child standing behind them. If the child guessed correctly, then the person behind them would be the new 'oni'.\" Pretty spooky stuff, I'd say. Especially the part about having to guess who's standing behind you right now\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nMore Ropes - Fatal Frame/Project Zero\n\nKirie's Curse - Fatal Frame/Project Zero\n\nFound Takamine - Fatal Frame/Project Zero\n\nLong-Armed Man - Fatal Frame/Project Zero\n\nThe Tsukimori Song (Pipe Organ) - Fatal Frame/Project Zero 4: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\n\nBroken Neck - Fatal Frame/Project Zero (Fun fact about this song: The faint breathing you hear is what it would sound like if someone were to survive a neck break, and this song plays when you fight a ghost with a severely broken neck, implying this ghost was alive for some time after their neck was initially broken. This likely means this person's death was extremely slow and painful. Fun!)\n\nStrangling Ritual - Fatal Frame/Project Zero\n\nEncounter to Himuro Mansion - Fatal Frame/Project Zero (The song that forever traumatized me and imprinted this series on my brain forever. Good times.)\n\nCheat honorable mention, since this is TECHNICALLY part of the soundtrack to the game, even though I don't think you could classify it as music. Fair warning that I wouldn't recommend listening to this one if you intend on sleeping well tonight:\n\nThe Whimpers of Hell - Fatal Frame/Project Zero 4: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse\n\nAnd now, since using the Fatal Frame series is honestly kind of cheating, here's some non-horror game honorable mentions:\n\nRun Rambi, Run! - Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest\n\nHot Pursuit - Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!\n\nCerberus - Castlevania: Dracula X\n\nDay 28: (Final Boss) | The Gadfly Suite - LittleBigPlanet 2\n\nWell, since I used Battle on the Ice, the final boss theme for LittleBigPlanet 1 on my last list, figured I might as well stay consistent with this list, right? Another one of my all-time favorite final boss themes for sure. Interestingly, this theme doesn't actually originate from the game itself, much like Battle on the Ice. This theme once more comes from a Soviet historical drama film, this time \"The Gadfly\" from 1955. Again, much like Battle on the Ice, the version of this theme that was used in-game was also sped up, the original one has a much slower pace (and, once more like Battle on the Ice, I actually kind of prefer the original slower version.) I dunno where they got the idea to use amazing songs from decades old Soviet historical movies as final boss themes, but whoever came up with that idea is a genius, because both of these songs are absolutely fantastic and work very well as final boss themes in my opinion.\n\nHonorable mentions to all of the final boss themes I mentioned in my previous list.\n\nDay 29: (Ending/Epilogue) | Ending - Castlevania: Dracula X\n\nI thought I would've used up this game by now, but surprisingly, I actually didn't! So, I figured this former honorable mention would fit this day pretty well. Very nostalgic for this song, as this was among one of the first few games I ever beat (and, at the time, probably the hardest too.)\n\nDay 30: (Credits) | Staff Roll - The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (Switch)\n\nAnd once more, the list comes full circle, and we end with the same franchise that began the list...\n\nAs always, this has been incredibly fun @AverageOliver98 and I already look forward to the third iteration of this, whenever that may be. I'll be in Texas for the following week or so to visit family, but I'll get to work on my Day 31 list as soon as I can.\n\nEdited October 30, 2020 by ZeldaFreak\n\nRdRunner's Picks II\n\nDifficulty: Lunatic Custom:\n\nONE game from last time.\n\nGenerally avoiding major franchises.\n\nNES games only (unless otherwise required)\n\nDay 1 Title: Tecmo Super Bowl (NES), Prologue 2 - Right off the bat using a repeat game, but I had promised myself I would use this as my title game this time. Perfect mood setter for this!\n\nDay 2 Desert: The Lone Ranger (NES), Overworld - It helps when the entire game takes place in a desert.\n\nDay 3 Nintendo: Adventures of Lolo 3 (NES), World Map - Sticking up for a series in desperate need of a remake. Was Kirby so popular that HAL had to abandon poor Lolo and Lala entirely? If a name as derivative as King Dedede can survive, surely there must be something they can do.\n\nDay 4 2010's: Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, Stage 1 Boss - Excited to see this awesome game coming back on Switch. Was lucky enough to buy it on Xbox before it was delisted, but missed out on expansions.\n\nDay 5 Jazz: Anticipation (NES), Title - Not a big Jazz Music fan. Not even sure what exactly fits the genre, so here's a random stab. And yes, I actually like this game, just don't get me started on the \"Walkman\" answer.\n\nDay 6 Underground: Battletoads (NES), Turbo Tunnel - This game/stage is better known for other reasons, but the music is still really good.\n\nDay 7 Indoors: Little Nemo the Dream Master (NES), Nemo's House - Haven't done too many Capcom games, but they really do know their stuff when it comes to gaming music. Nice little fun house Nemo dreamed up here too!\n\nDay 8 8-Bit: Mission Impossible (NES), Stage 4 Snow Area - This is one of those ultra-tough games by \"Ultra Games\", but man does it have a great soundtrack. Wish the snow segments lasted longer so you could hear this song more often.\n\nDay 9 Remix: The Adventures of Bayou Billy \"El Lagarto\", by Evil Horde - Easily one of my favorites on OC Remix. Sweetly combines a couple of the main themes, picks up the tempo, and adds a little flair!\n\nDay 10 Water: Blaster Master (NES), Area 5 - This (and Donkey Kong Country) is pretty much what I think of when it comes to water stages. It's about as relaxing as that blasted crab boss is frustrating. Interesting contrast, I always thought.\n\nDay 11 Funny: Cabal (NES), Stage Clear - So big, strong, tough, commando dude finishes blowing up everything in sight and the very next thing he does is run like this...\n\n...okay so that's my official pick (NES and all, blah blah blah). Here's what I think is the funniest track in gaming: BattleBlock Theater, Secret Area! The whole game is a riot too, thanks mostly to this talented/disturbed individual heard here and throughout.\n\nDay 12 Hate: Snake Rattle 'n Roll (NES), Stage 6/9/10 - This song sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise awesome game. All the other songs are catchy and fun, but apparently not enough for Rare, who decided to air this other song THREE times instead of reusing the others even once. I get that the tune was put with the harder levels to create tension, but this was a bit much.\n\nDay 13 Sports: American Gladiators (NES), Title Screen - Not exactly the TV tune everyone remembers, but it's still a really good listen. I was obsessed with this show growing up. Not so much for the juiced-up gladiators but rather the events pitting them against the much smaller contestants. Everyone loves an underdog!\n\nDay 14 Boss: Fester's Quest (NES) - Silly games like this have zero business having music this good, but yet here it is. One of the best boss tracks on the NES!\n\nDay 15 Stage Clear: Legendary Wings (NES) - If I had listened to this song without having played the game, I would have guessed this was for beating the whole game, not just one stage. Game is pretty epic too, despite the whole Gradius syndrome thing.\n\nDay 16 16-Bit: Chuck Rock (SNES), Title - He's not exactly the world's greatest platformer, but Chuck has quite a band! His whole soundtrack is a mainstay in my playlist, with the title screen being my favorite.\n\nDay 17 Sky: Contra Force, Stage 4 - Here we have a game that sold so poorly that modern Contra anthologies don't even mention it as part of the franchise. This aerial battle where you jump from plane to plane is easily the best part.\n\nDay 18 Arcade: Quartet, Main Theme - Coolest game I've barely played. Only place I've ever seen this machine was at Funspot. I feel like it should have been more popular than it was. 4-joystick Contra-ish multiplayer. What's not to like?...\n\n...bonus: Mr. Do's Castle, Main Theme - I said it in another recent thread and I'll say it again: This game is in desperate need of a port on a modern console (along with many others made by Universal).\n\nDay 19 Sampler: Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy (NES), Zak's Castle - SO many fun options here, but I gotta go with this offshoot of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Classic!\n\nDay 20 Sega: Powerball (Genesis), Menu - No, not the lottery drawing, but a futuristic sports game based on football, soccer, and martial arts. Not at all bad for a sports game, plus it has a rockin' soundtrack. I also almost put this song for Day 19, for reminding me of Shakedown by Bob Seger.\n\nDay 21 Fighting: Flying Warriors (NES), Stage Theme 2 - This is one of those games that I keep forgetting about in the massive NES library. Pity, as it's a solid game worth remembering.\n\nDay 22 Ambient: Legacy of the Wizard (NES), Main Dungeon - Took forever to pick a slow, backgroundy thingumawhatzit for this day, but I think I nailed it. I can have this playing while I work and it helps me focus without distracting me. Ambient, no?\n\nDay 23 Industrial: Batman (NES), Stage 2 - I'm actually not a huge fan of Batman's NES adventures. Good thing I am a fan of Sunsoft's NES music! The whole soundtrack does a remarkable job of making this game seem way more fun than it actually is.\n\nDay 24 32/64-Bit: Blast Corps (N64), Simian Acres/Beeton Tracks - Interested to see how many people pick a RareWare game today. I went with Blast Corps mostly to avoid a big name franchise, but there are otherwise sooo many awesome choices!\n\nDay 25 Techno: Silver Surfer (NES), Title - Someone should seriously just do the whole challenge using music by Tim Follin.\n\nDay 26 Fire: Life Force (NES), Stage 3 - Okay final five days deserve a curtain call, so loosening up a bit on the franchises. First up, hard to find more fire from the NES than on this stage! I still remember getting ambushed by the waves of flames for the first time. It used to freak out 10-year-old me! (nice timing with Day 27...) Honorable mentions go to the fire cave from Ninja Gaiden 2 and Volkmire's Inferno (Stage 7) from Battletoads.\n\nDay 27 Scary: Zelda II The Adventure of Link (NES), Great Palace - Trying not to go for the obvious horror game. This tune used to always make me nervous. The final palace in this classic is full of nasty surprises, including little jump scares like this, even if they're mostly harmless. Honorable mention to Wizards and Warriors, for dumping you into a tree full of beehives after you bribe the first knight (why would anyone guard such a thing?!). Had to turn the sound off to brave this scene as a kid.\n\nDay 28 Final Boss: Vice Project Doom (NES) - This was always one of my favorite final battles. It's like Zelda 2 in reverse, fighting the evil twin first followed by the monster (no Thunder spell required). Epic ending to an underrated game. Honorable mentions: The Lone Ranger's locomotive gunfight, Rush'n Attack's poorly-defended secret weapon, and Castlevania III's triple-formed Dracula.\n\nDay 29/30 Endings/Credits - Gauntlet (NES) and Metal Storm (NES). Since the two kinda go hand in hand, I'm going to combine these for the finale. I tried to pick stuff that people may not have heard. Gauntlet's ending is special both for the fact that an ending exists on what's mostly an arcade port and that it's so hard to reach. Metal Storm's \"true\" ending is similarly hard to get to, requiring that you beat the game twice to actually see the credits. The tune is nothing special, but I bet most gamers have only heard the first half of the song. That second loop is rather brutal!\n\nOh right, honorable mentions... (I love this category! )\n\nNinja Gaiden II\n\nExcitebike\n\nStarTropics\n\nMega Man II\n\nUninvited\n\nSolomon's Key\n\nImmortal (stay with it a minute...)\n\nContra\n\nRygar\n\nOthello\n\nCastlevania III\n\nKid Icarus\n\nSuper Dodge Ball\n\nAstyanax\n\nTMNT II The Arcade Game\n\nVice Project Doom\n\nGradius II\n\nSuper Mario Bros 2\n\nWith that, we've reached the end of the month. I hope everyone enjoyed my list as much I enjoyed making it. Great stuff from everyone else as well!\n\nEdited October 31, 2020 by rdrunner\n\nLunatic, baby!\n\nDay 1 (Title Screen): World of Goo - World of Goo Beginning\n\nEven years after this game came out, the haunting title theme still remains one of the most iconic things about it.\n\nDay 2 (Desert Area): Paper Mario The Origami King - Desert Battle Theme\n\nI can't believe I expended the Mario franchise already, but this game's entire soundtrack is just too much of a banger.\n\nDay 3 (Nintendo exclusive): Shadow of the Ninja - Stage 1\n\nSince we're not doing Stage 1 music this time, this will cover for that. One of the most hyped up openers for a classic action game I've tried!\n\nDay 4 (Post 2010): Shantae: ½-Genie Hero - Cape Crustacean\n\n½-Genie Hero was a massive disappointment to me. Not that it was terrible, but making a Kickstarter really sold this game as Wayforward doing the game they dreamt of, but instead they made this super lazy cashgrab.\n\nWell, one guy that didn't faff about was Jake Kaufman who gave it his all with this soundtrack, drawing from inspirations everywhere. I love how much this sounds like 90s-era demoscene tracker music.\n\nDay 5 (Jazzy): The Neverhood - Klaymen Shuffle\n\nI always thought of this soundtrack as incredibly jazzy, but going through it I found there were actually very few straight up \"jazz\" tracks on it. Anyway, I'm not a genre buff, but I think this one qualifies.\n\nIncredibly unique and memorable soundtrack, I wish more games would do something like that.\n\nDay 6 (Underground): Terranigma - Underworld\n\nI love Terranigma's inversion of the trope, starting you in the underground, only letting you lose in the barren overworld after the prologue.\n\nThe music that plays in this underworld is one of the most memorable parts of the game to me.\n\nDay 7 (Indoors): Banjo-Tooie - Banjo's House Blues\n\nThis one was probably the hardest for me. Of course there are plenty of areas in games that take place entirely indoors, which could be an easy copout, but it's hard to think of games that play specific notable tunes when you enter a building, outside of the Zelda series.\n\nEither way, the Banjo series is one of those games that are great at reusing motifs but changing the mood entirely based on where you are on the stage. Entering Banjo's house in the second game gives you a uniquely sad take on a typically happy tune.\n\nDay 8 (8 bit game): Ninja Gaiden III - Stage 4-2\n\nWay way too much to choose from, so I just did the honorable thing and picked a random track that I like.\n\nDay 9 (Cover): Sonic Generations (3DS) - Boss: Big Arms\n\nThe 3DS version of Generations is nowhere near the surprisingly high standards of the console version, but one thing it did have over it is more classic stages missing from the \"real game\". I'm especially disappointed about missing the Big Arms fight, if only because it means missing out this awesome Ys-style cover version of the original Sonic 3 boss theme.\n\nDay 10 (Underwater): Toki Going Ape Spit - Underwater stages\n\nIt's kinda hard for me to pick a game that's not just going to be the most obvious choice here (DKC, Mario, etc.)\n\nFortunately the MegaDrive-exclusive sequel to Toki exists, and has a super catchy theme for the underwater areas that weren't in the original game.\n\nDay 11 (Funny): The Curse of Monkey Island - A Pirate I Was Meant To Be\n\nI love audio gags, but of course it's really hard to think of them once you're put on the spot.\n\nThe Monkey Island series is famous for turning every piece of dialogue into a gag, and this song is a bit of a classic. It's basically a dialogue puzzle where you need to end the song to progress the game, but the only way to do so is by picking a line they can't rhyme on.\n\nOf course, playing the game you'll be sure to pick every line just to enjoy how it affects the song.\n\nDay 12 (Hate/Awful): Evergrace - Buying Goods At Palmira\n\nI couldn't make myself post music that I genuinely dislike, so I'll settle for Evergrace which... definitely is unique.\n\nI think most people will find it grating, and those who don't will at least find it fascinating that it even exists. There's really nothing like this.\n\nDay 13 (Sports game): Daytona USA - Let's Go Away!!\n\nI had to pick the video where the composer/singer performs the song himself to the original backing track, just because of how invigorating it is to witness how much he loves his own work\n\nDay 14 (Boss music): Octopath Traveller - Battle At Journey's End\n\nJRPGs have a tendency to have great soundtracks, but to me nothing has really been as memorable as the genre's 90s heyday... until this game. It's crazy that Yasunori Nishiki isn't getting any more attention, he could easily be the next Uematsu.\n\nEvery battle theme in the game is great, so it's hard to pick just one. Each character has three \"tiers\" of bosses going through their story, and this is the third and final one of them. The game has a \"real\" final boss too, and this one you get to hear eight times.\n\nEach character also has their own brilliant little \"intro\" leading into the boss music, here is an example of how that works.\n\nDay 15 (Victory music): Star Ocean: The Last Hope - Golden Goal\n\nI don't know what to say about this one - I really didn't want to expend fantastic soundtracks like Chrono Cross or Seiken Densetsu 3 just for their victory jingles.\n\nMotoi Sakuraba's Star Ocean 4 soundtrack doesn't get that much love, due to most of what he's doing being very formulaic and somewhat repetitive. But I think it's consistently very good, and Star Ocean 4 is probably one of his better works alongside Valkyrie Profile and Dark Souls.\n\nDay 16 (16-bit generation): Seiken Densetsu 3 - Decision Bell\n\nBack before this game was even released - when everyone still thought we would be getting this as \"Secret of Mana 2\" - I recall reading in magazines about this game, and how Square really wanted every instrument to stand out individually on the soundtrack, which is definitely admirable, compared to the muddled sound that would be the standard for most orchestral SNES music.\n\nConsidering this was only Hiroki Kikuta's second composing job, it's really amazing what a fantastic feat he pulled off with it, and it compliments the incredible pixel art perfectly.\n\nKikuta would, of course, go on to direct Koudelka on the PS1, proving that he had more in him than just music.\n\nDay 17 (Sky area): Etrian Odyssey IV - The Land Beyond The Clouds\n\nI'm too drunk to do into details. But who'd argue against Yuzo Koshiro anyway?\n\nDay 18 (Arcade): Blazing Star - Ascenseur\n\nThis is such a carte blanche it's hard to pick which one to go with. So much great stuff. So I figured the ideal thing to do would be to go with one of the more abnormal examples out there. The stage 3 theme from Blazing Star is very unusual for a shooter, but it's just so god damn groovy.\n\nDay 19 (Inspired by): 3D Dot Game Heroes - Main Theme\n\nI thought the most ideal way to represent this category would be with a game whose entire identity is being derivative of classics like Dragon Quest, and... well, if a single screenshot didn't do the job, the music really gives away its biggest source of inspiration.\n\nThe soundtrack in general is amazingly good, and it's impossible to pick just one track. Shoutouts to the mountain area and wilderness too, for sure.\n\nDay 20 (Sega exclusive): Ranger-X - Stage 6-1\n\nThis really is another carte blanche. So much good stuff. But I feel like this category would be best utilized to highlight some quality FM work, so the fantastic Ranger-X soundtrack is almost a given!\n\nDay 21 (Fighting game): Super Street Fighter II Turbo - Blanka's Theme\n\nI hade to pick such a conventional option, but despite having played like a billion fighting games, I don't really feel any relationship to any music from any of them outside of the classic Street Fighter II (and the only potential unconventional choice I know of was used up back in June)\n\nCan't possibly hate on early Yoko Shimomura.\n\nDay 22 (Ambient): Metroid Prime - Tallon Overworld\n\nIt's hard to make an ambient soundtrack that's still vividly memorable, but Metroid Prime is one of the few games that excels at it.\n\nDay 23 (Factory): Nier - The Wretched Automatons\n\nFinally an excuse to post Nier music. I love how this one manages to mix the traditional industrial mechanical beats with the game's patented sence of melancholy.\n\nFun fact you're probably already aware of - although all the vocals in the game are gibberish, every track in the game is inspired by a real world language, and this is the one that was based on English. So I guess that explains why a lot of it sounds like unintelligible lyrics moreso than just a language you don't understand.\n\nDay 24 (32-bit gen): Mr. Driller G - Go->\n\nI prefer the arcade soundtrack, but the PS1 version of Mr. Driller G has some really awesome tracks that were unique to that version (at least until Drill Land came out), and if this song doesn't communicate start of an adventure, I don't know what does. Even if the adventure is just drilling through a bunch of colored blocks.\n\nDay 25 (Techno): Contra: Shattered Soldier - Battle Train\n\nContra SS has an incredible soundtrack that'll get you pumped like nothing else, and is one of the few soundtracks I actually bought on CD (alongside Nier, SOTN, and Chrono Cross).\n\nIt's hard to pick just one track from it to represent the \"techno\" category, so here are some awesome runner-ups:\n\nJinmen-Gyo\n\nSuper-Powered Robot Yokozuna\n\nDay 26 (Fire): Gradius 2 - Burning Heat\n\nThe firey first stage of Gradius 2 happens to also feature one of the most iconic bangers of the franchise, so why not!\n\nDay 27 (Scary/unsettling): Ecco the Dolphin - Lonesome Search\n\nOne of the first comments you'll usually hear whenever someone brings up Ecco the Dolphin is how creepy and scary they found the game despite feeling it wasn't meant to.\n\nI think it was absolutely intentional. The open sea is a scary place, and the atmospheric music definitely did its part. The amazing CD soundtrack on the MegaCD version went pretty new age'y at times, but it also manages to build the unsettling feeling very well.\n\nDay 28 (Final boss): Lost Odyssey - Roar of the Departed Souls\n\nFeels like someone told Nobuo Uematsu to make the most Nobuo Uematsu final boss theme he could, and then he did.\n\nBesure to stick around for the Japanese rapping at 3:20\n\nDay 29 (Epilogue): Gravity Rush - Douse Shinundakara\n\nLet's end the game with a scene where all the characters get ice cream while an upbeat song in a made-up language goes on about how everything is meaningless because everyone is going to die anyway.\n\nHad this awesome song stuck in my head for days after playing the game.\n\nDay 30 (Credits): Chrono Trigger - Outskirts of Time\n\nDecided to go with a classic for the final day. For a soundtrack as celebrated as this, I find it a little surprising how little attention the brilliant credits theme usually gets.\n\nIt's a perfect ending to an amazing adventure, and I find it impossible not to get a little bit emotional.\n\nEdited October 30, 2020 by Sumez"
