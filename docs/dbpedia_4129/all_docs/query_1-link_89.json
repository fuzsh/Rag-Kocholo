It seems to happen a lot lately and before it does a message on the left side of the game window saying something like the site is experiencing strain or high traffic or something like that? Is there some sort of bug or maintainence going on? It's been happening for several weeks now.\n\nNoxHardigan - 05-26-24 01:41 AM\n\nAnyone know what's going on with the Game Boy games? None of them seem to be working. All I get is a gray screen everytime I try to load one up.\n\nLennoxZero - 01-04-24 02:22 AM\n\nI'm with gogo.
