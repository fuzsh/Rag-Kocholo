        "text": "Thunderbirds was the only title of a 1985 video game published by Firebird Software. It was released on the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum and notably marked the first ever Thunderbirds video game.\n\nPlot[]\n\n[Taken from the back cover]\n\nA team of Egyptologists are trapped in the ancient tomb of Tootnmoughtin. Heavy stone blocks and a highly complex maze bar their exit. Running out of air they transmit one final message. Somewhere in Earth's orbit Thunderbird Five records their desperate S.O.S. — suddenly, THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO!\n\nGameplay[]\n\nGameplay was relatively simple, with the player controlling Thunderbird 1 and Thunderbird 2[1] as they navigated screens of mazes. Various obstacles hampered their progress, including massive vines and variously shaped coloured blocks which could be pushed out of the way or lifted up by the vehicles. Blue blocks could only be moved by TB1 and green blocks by TB2, with red blocks able to be moved by either. Some screens also featured decreased light levels making navigation more difficult while others featured shuriken-like projectiles which damaged the Thunderbirds.\n\nEach piece of treasure collected by the player was worth 100 points.\n\nThe enemies consisted of mummies, jackal-like beings reminiscent of Anubis, and spiders. They were often present in locations which did not require a close encounter if the player had brought certain equipment with them.\n\nEquipment[]\n\n\"YOU START YOUR MISSION WITH 4000 POINTS AND NO CARGO.\n\nTHUNDERBIRD TWO CAN CARRY UP TO 40 TONS OF EQUIPMENT IN IT'S [sic] HOLD.\n\nEACH TON CARRIED WILL LOSE 100 POINTS FROM YOUR STARTING SCORE.\n\nEXPERIENCED PLAYERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO CARRY ANY EQUIPMENT, BUT KEEPING THE POINTS — MAKING THIS SIMULATION MORE DIFFICULT.\"\n\nWeedkiller: 5 tons\n\nHeavy duty acid: 5 tons\n\nEmergency transport: 5 tons\n\nThunderbird 4: 15 tons\n\nGuided missiles: 5 tons\n\nAcme cave sonar: 10 tons\n\nBulldozer: 15 tons\n\nThe Mole: 15 tons\n\nEarthquake bomb: 15 tons\n\nExtra fuel: 5 tons\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThunderbird 2 does not use its ramp to launch from Tracy Island, instead taking off vertically from a standing position.\n\nThe Commodore 64 version of the game featured several colour differences to its ZX Spectrum counterpart, most notably to the landscape and Thunderbird 1.\n\nGallery[]"
