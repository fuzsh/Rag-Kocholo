        "text": "Uninvited (ICOM Simulations) Solution.\n\nPart 1\n\nWhat a night to be out driving! How it happened doesn't matter; but,\n\nboy, are you in a mess. The last thing you remember is that something\n\njumped out in front of you while you and your little brother were out\n\nfor an evening drive -- you swerved the car smack into a tree. The smell\n\nof a ruptured gas tank signals your instinct to survive. You OPEN the\n\ncar door and go out with your first move. As soon as you click your\n\nmouse to get out of the car you hear an explosion -- better get moving.\n\nWith the car gone, you have no choice but to go inside that\n\nhaunted-looking house that looks like it came straight out of a comic\n\nbook.\n\nBefore you go inside the House, it would only be fitting to find out\n\nwhere you are. A good place to check would be the mailbox. OPEN the\n\nmailbox. Guess what? It looks like you're in luck because there's a\n\nletter inside. EXAMINE the envelope. Oh, no! You're at the Crowley House\n\non 666 (sign of the Devil) Blackwell Road, Loch Ness, Scotland. Loch\n\nNess: doesn't that mean monsters? If only you could turn around -- well\n\nit's too late. If you're in this much trouble, you might as well snoop\n\naround some more. OPEN the envelope. EXAMINE the letter. The letter\n\ncontains a clue that the amulet might be good against the undead. DRAG\n\nthe amulet into your inventory. It might come in handy.\n\nNow OPEN the front door and go through it. What a creepy house. The\n\ndoor has slammed shut behind you and it doesn't want to open up. What\n\nkind of trouble are you in now? EXAMINE the various pictures and the\n\nfurniture. After your ordeal, why don't you sit down (OPERATE) and rest\n\nyour feet on either of the chairs. Ouch! One of the chairs hurt you!\n\n(Remember this: You'll want revenge later.) OPEN both doors. First, go\n\ninside the room to your east (all orientation in this game is northern).\n\nYou're in the Library. Notice the book on the table. EXAMINE the book.\n\nOPEN the book then EXAMINE the book again. There are some definitions\n\nthat you would be well advised to write down in your notebook. Go out of\n\nthe Library back into the Entrance Hall. Now go out the door to the\n\nnorthwest to the Hall. There are five exits, including the one you just\n\npassed through. Your best bet is to go upstairs first. Maybe that's\n\nwhere you'll find your little brother.\n\nThe Upstairs Hallway has six exits, including the stairway you just\n\ncame up. OPEN all the doors. Now to check out all of the rooms. First,\n\ngo through the lower right door into the Storage Closet. EXAMINE all the\n\nitems. Pretty mundane stuff, huh? Bet you've never seen a product at the\n\nsupermarket called \"No Ghost.\" DRAG the bottle into your inventory.\n\n\"Spider Cider\" looks interesting, too: DRAG that along into your\n\ninventory, also. By this time, you'll get the first signal that\n\nsomething is really wrong in this haunted house -- the evil is starting\n\nto get to you in very tangible ways. Go back into the Upstairs Hallway.\n\nNow go into the middle right door. Another stairwell! What's this? A\n\nweapon! DRAG the axe into your inventory.\n\nIf you venture upstairs to the Tower, well all I can say is don't open\n\nthe Prison and don't go inside no matter how tempting it looks. It might\n\nbe the last thing you ever do! Go back to the Upstairs Hallway. Go\n\nthrough the door on the lower left side into the Master Bedroom. On the\n\nnightstand is a candle and a book. OPEN the book. DRAG the candle to\n\nyour inventory. EXAMINE the book. Well now you know the name of the bad\n\nguy -- Dracon, huh? \"A key is hidden someplace beyond his stare, a chair\n\nknows where.\"\n\nGo out of the room back into the Upstairs Hallway. Go down the stairs\n\n(south exit). Go through the open door (upper right) back into the\n\nEntrance Hall. Remember the chair that hurt you before? Now is the time\n\nfor revenge! OPERATE the axe on the chair. In the rip is a golden\n\nskeleton key. DRAG the key into your inventory. Take the axe and leave\n\nit in the Entrance Hall -- it's too large to carry for now. Now go\n\nstraight back upstairs.\n\nFrom the Upstairs Hallway go into the first room on the left. OPERATE\n\nthe key on the large chest behind the bed. Now that the chest is\n\nunlocked, OPEN the chest. Take everything from the chest and put it in\n\nyour inventory. OPEN and EXAMINE both scrolls. They contain clues that\n\nwill be very important to finishing the game. OPEN the door in the upper\n\nleft corner. Though everything in the room looks interesting, there is\n\nreally nothing inside here that is worthwhile. Go back into the Master\n\nBedroom. EXAMINE the pictures on the wall. They contain some clues to\n\nthe Master's relationships with others.\n\nGo back into the Upstairs Hallway. Go through the door in the upper\n\nleft corner into the Bedroom. EXAMINE, then OPEN and, once again,\n\nEXAMINE the book on the nightstand. Reading the egomaniacal rantings of\n\nDracon gives you quite a clue into just what you are up against. OPEN\n\nthe nightstand. Aha, another scroll! OPEN and EXAMINE the scroll. The\n\nscroll contains some important magic spells that use words you should be\n\nfamiliar with from the book in the library. Write these spells down on\n\nyour notepad; you will be needing them soon.\n\nOPEN the door in the upper right corner and go into the Bathroom. OPEN\n\nthe hamper. A blood stained towel -- yech! Could the blood belong to\n\nsomeone near and dear, like your little brother? You had better find out\n\nsoon. Go out of the Bathroom through the Bedroom, back into the Upstairs\n\nHallway. There is one last room you haven't explored. Go into the room\n\nin the upper right corner. OPEN the black dresser and DRAG the star into\n\nyour inventory. Go out of the Bedroom, through the Upstairs Hallway, and\n\nback downstairs to the Hall.\n\nRemember that bottle of \"No Ghost\"? You had better OPEN it just in case\n\nyou need it in a hurry. Now OPEN the lower right door. What's this? Out\n\nof nowhere a woman dressed like Scarlet O'Hara has appeared in the Hall!\n\nAnyone dressed in clothes from a century ago must be a ghost. OPERATE\n\nthe bottle of \"No Ghost\" on Scarlet and see what happens. Well, that\n\ntakes care of that as another ghost bites the dust.\n\nUNINVITED\n\nPart 2\n\nOPEN all the doors in the Hall. First, go through the lower right door\n\nthat you first opened before \"Scarlet O'Ghost\" pranced in. That takes\n\nyou into the Parlor. OPEN the outside door and go to the Veranda.\n\nThere's a quick spider going by too fast for you to stop him. OPERATE\n\nthe \"Spider Cider\" on the railing. Go back in the Parlor. On second\n\nthought, go back outside on the Veranda to see if the spider might come\n\naround again. Here it comes, slowing down in its tracks due to the\n\nnumbing effects of the \"Spider Cider.\" Pretty good stuff! DRAG the\n\nspider into your inventory. You never know when a spider might come in\n\nhandy for stirring up a brew or something. Go back through the Parlor\n\ninto the Hall again.\n\nRemove the \"Spider Cider\" and the \"No Ghost\" from your inventory and\n\nleave them in the Hall. Go through the lower left door into the Rec\n\nRoom. OPERATE the gramophone. Pretty neat, huh? Too bad you broke it. It\n\nmust be quite a valuable antique on today's market. But, then again, a\n\nlot of the creepy things you see in this house might fetch a high price\n\nat a graveyard auction.\n\nEXAMINE the cabinet at the back of the room. OPERATE the key on the\n\ncabinet. OPEN the unlocked cabinet and SPEAK to the doll. Say \"SPECAN\n\nHEAFOD ABRAXAS\" (like the scroll in Dracon's room said). The doll tells\n\nyou to speak to her brother. OPEN both remaining doors in the Rec Room.\n\nGo through the right side door into the Dining Room.\n\nDRAG the flowers from the table into your inventory. EXAMINE all the\n\npictures in the room. Be aware that some strange things will float out\n\nof the pictures as if they have a life of their own. OPEN all the doors\n\nin the Dining Room. Go through the upper left door to the Kitchen first.\n\nOPEN both the left and right doors. Go through the room on your left to\n\nthe Bedroom. OPERATE the lamp. Something strange happens. (Actually, in\n\nthis game, everything is strange! So maybe what's strange for the real\n\nworld is normal here at 666 Blackwell Road.) Too bad that \"No Ghost\" was\n\nused up. Neither the amulet nor the star has any effect on the ghost.\n\nMaybe the ghost is frightened by small living animals the same way the\n\nmouse is legend for scaring elephants?\n\nOPERATE the spider on the ghost and it vanishes! EXAMINE, OPEN, then,\n\nagain, EXAMINE the diary that was hidden in the wall behind the picture.\n\nIt contains a clue for whatever is inside the box that was locked in the\n\nlarge chest upstairs in the Master Bedroom.\n\nFire and ice -- where to find either would be helpful right this\n\nmoment. Go out of the Bedroom through the Kitchen to the Pantry (the\n\nroom off the Kitchen's right). DRAG the box of matches from the second\n\nshelf from the top. OPEN the matchbox. OPERATE one of the matches on the\n\nmatchbox itself. OPERATE the newly lit match on the candle you took\n\nearlier from the Master Bedroom. Great! Now that should shed some light\n\non the situation. Everything in the Kitchen, the Pantry, and the\n\ndownstairs Bedroom is interesting but will not help you to complete the\n\ngame. In fact the more mouse clicks that you waste in these rooms, the\n\nmore time you lose. And those mouse clicks become valuable with time.\n\nGo out of the Pantry through the Kitchen back into the Dining Room. Go\n\nthrough the door in the top center of the Exits Box to the Study.\n\nEXAMINE the locked door. Besides being locked, there is something\n\nstrange about that passageway. Hmm! Maybe the key that the creature has,\n\nhuh? You'll have to be patient with that one. You aren't fast enough to\n\nmake a difference in his life.\n\nOPEN the desk. Inside the desk are some files about different elements.\n\nDRAG the file on Gold, Silver, and Mercury into your inventory. Those\n\nelements were all mentioned as being able to make a key when put\n\ntogether. You will have to EXAMINE most or all the files to find all\n\nthree cards.\n\nGo out the open door to the Dining Room. Go through the Hall back into\n\nthe Entrance Hall. OPERATE the LIT CANDLE (that you have been carrying\n\nin your inventory) on the FIREPLACE. Besides taking a chill out of the\n\nair, you now have a big fire. OPERATE the sealed box that you took from\n\nthe cabinet upstairs on the burning fire. The box will dissolve, leaving\n\na pentagram. DRAG the pentagram to your inventory. Without it you cannot\n\nfinish the game.\n\nGo back through the Hall and the Rec Room to the Trophy Room. DRAG the\n\ncage into your inventory. While there are several items that look\n\nhelpful or interesting, they are red herrings.\n\nAT THIS POINT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR GAME because when you\n\nOPEN the door in the upper right corner, you never know what kind of\n\nhell is going to break loose!\n\nUNINVITED\n\nPart 3\n\nOPEN the door in the upper right corner, and go outside to the\n\nBackyard. In the Backyard are three paths to three different buildings.\n\nObviously, you will have to visit each building. Your brother just might\n\nbe inside one of them waiting to be saved! First, go to the Building in\n\nthe center. OPEN the door at the entrance and go inside the Greenhouse.\n\nEXAMINE ALL of the plant pots in the room. One of them is different from\n\nthe others. OPERATE the watering can on the DIRT-FILLED RED-CLAY POT.\n\nDRAG the RED-CLAY POT into your inventory. There isn't much else of\n\ninterest in this building. Go out of the Greenhouse, and return to the\n\nBackyard.\n\nGo to the Domed Building. No matter how you try to OPEN the door at the\n\nMagisterium, you fail. EXAMINE the niche over the Magisterium door.\n\nSomething that should be there, isn't. Pay attention -- be on the\n\nlookout for an object shaped like the emblem on Superman's chest to fill\n\nthat niche. Maybe a jewel? Maybe the same jewel mentioned on the scroll?\n\nSince there is nothing that will be accomplished by just standing\n\naround a building that you can't get inside, you might as well try the\n\nlast building. Go back to the Backyard. From the Backyard, go to the\n\nbuilding on the right.\n\nAt the Chapel entrance are two very rabid-looking dogs. They don't look\n\nvery nice. In fact, if you aren't careful, they might bite your head\n\noff! SPEAK to one of the dogs and be very careful about your spelling.\n\nSay \"INSTANTUM ILLUMINARIS ABRAXAS.\" After the thunder and lightning\n\nstop, the dogs will go away.\n\nThank God! In fact, you might just get a chance to do so once you're\n\ninside the Chapel! OPEN the Chapel door and go inside. There is a bust\n\ninside the Chapel. SPEAK to the bust. Say \"SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS.\" This\n\nmust be the brother to the doll in the rec room cabinet. The statue head\n\nwill open the door in the upper left corner for you.\n\nOPERATE the lit candle on the large standing candleholder in the\n\nChapel. You will need the candleholder to get through the next stage of\n\nthe game, so try to DRAG it into your inventory. If it doesn't fit (and,\n\nif you've been following this walkthru to the letter, it shouldn't),\n\nREMOVE the potted plant. You should note that it has begun to sprout.\n\nIsn't nature wonderful? Now DRAG the candleholder to your inventory.\n\nGo out through the open upper left door to the Church Grounds. A ghost\n\nwill come by. If you have the candleholder he will leave you alone. If\n\nyou don't -- well don't say you weren't warned! Ever get the feeling\n\nyou're being watched?\n\nNOW IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DO A GAME SAVE!\n\nGo to the building in the center of the Church Grounds. Oh, no! A maze!\n\nNow is the time to make a map. Go through the maze with the following\n\ndirections. All of them have a northward facing orientation.\n\nNorth, west twice, and north twice. At this point you'll find the grave\n\nof Doug Dinsdale.\n\nEast twice, north four times, and east four times.\n\nIf you see a lone Zombie (and of course you will), OPERATE the gawdy\n\nchain necklace that you originally found in the mailbox at the beginning\n\nof the game ON THE LONE ZOMBIE. If you run into a group of\n\nzombies...well, nothing works against them, so run away.\n\nContinue east twice and south twice. Here you will find a CROSS marking\n\na grave.\n\nOPERATE the bouquet of flowers on the CROSS as a sign of your respect\n\nfor the dead (which you hope you aren't among soon). The cross will\n\nmove, revealing another Secret Passage. Go through the Secret Passage\n\n(west). You are in a room with three cages. OPERATE the KEY that you are\n\n(hopefully) carrying in your inventory on the LOCK to the cages. OPERATE\n\nthe CAGE on the EAGLE to capture the bird. The snake will eat the cat\n\nand slither away.\n\nGo south twice. You will meet a strange, ugly bouncing creature. Notice\n\nas he bounces that there's an object just underneath him. OPEN the cage\n\nand release the bird. The bird will fly away and the creature will\n\nfollow it. DRAG the gem into your inventory. It looks like it will fit\n\nthe niche in the Magisterium door!\n\nGo north twice, east, north twice, west four times, south twice, west\n\ntwice, south twice and east twice. Here you should find Doug Dinsdale\n\nagain.\n\nSouth twice, east twice and south twice. You should now be back outside\n\non the Church Grounds.\n\nIt would be a good idea to save your game here. You wouldn't want to go\n\nthrough that maze again. Would you?\n\nUNINVITED\n\nPart 4\n\nYipes! It seems you are still being watched by that flying eyeball --\n\nthe proverbial eye in the sky! Go south into the relative safety of the\n\nChapel.\n\nNotice how the plant has thrived while you were away in the maze? Hey!\n\nHow long were in that maze anyway? Return the candleholder to the\n\nChapel. DRAG the potted plant to your inventory. DRAG the CROSS from\n\nabove the altar into your inventory. The altar will move, revealing a\n\nnew entrance. You will be warned about a giant spider. This time it pays\n\nto heed the warning. DO NOT GO DOWN INTO THE SPIDER PIT! Exit the Chapel\n\nand go back to the Backyard.\n\nFrom the Backyard, go to the Domed Building on the left. OPERATE the\n\ngem on the niche above the door. The door will now open. Go through the\n\ndoor to enter the Magisterium. As you enter the room, you will see,\n\nfloating in the center of the room, a creature that wiggles its tongue\n\nand rolls its eyes. It doesn't look friendly; what does in this house?\n\nDRAG the potted plant to the floor. The Creature will dive for it and\n\ntake one of its fruits. Then he will leave you for a while -- better\n\nmove quickly!\n\nThe door on the right leads to the Observatory. Though it looks\n\ninteresting, ignore it. There's nothing but red herrings there, and you\n\ndon't have time for them. The door to the left is locked, and nothing\n\nwill open it. OPEN the center door.\n\nGo into the Laboratory. OPEN the safe. The combination is based on the\n\nelement numbers from the files you took out of the desk. The order of\n\nthe elements is the same as mentioned in the scroll from the cabinet you\n\nfound upstairs in the Master Bedroom: GOLD (#79), SILVER (#47), MERCURY\n\n(#80). The combination is 79-47-80.\n\nInside the safe is a cookie jar. DRAG the COOKIE JAR into your\n\ninventory. The cookie jar is sealed so tight that the only way to open\n\nit will be to break it open. The axe is back inside the House. Go back\n\nout to the Backyard. Hurry! Now re-enter the House. Go through the\n\nTrophy Room, through the Rec Room, through the Hall, back into the\n\nEntrance Hall. OPERATE the axe on the cookie jar. Breaking the cookie\n\njar reveals a -- oh, no! -- a cookie! Just a damned cookie!\n\nAnd after all that running, too! Well, maybe that little creature who's\n\nbeen running around with that key around his neck will be interested in\n\nthe cookie. At least someone will get some pleasure from it. DRAG the\n\ncookie to the floor. The creature will stop and grab the cookie. He will\n\nthen return the favor by leaving the key that he wore around his neck on\n\nthe floor. DRAG the new key into your inventory.\n\nWith the new key, it's time to go back to the Magisterium and see if\n\nthe new key will open the locked door. Go back to Magisterium through\n\nthe Hall, Rec Room, Trophy Room, Backyard, Magisterium entrance to\n\nfinally, the Room. OPERATE the NEW KEY on the door on the left to\n\nunlock, and, ultimately, OPEN the door; and, maybe, find your brother.\n\nWhat? The key doesn't do anything! Go back through the center door to\n\nthe Laboratory. OPEN the Trapdoor that's located under the cauldron.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR, IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SAVE\n\nYOUR GAME!\n\nGo down through the Trapdoor to enter the Cave. You can't go back it\n\nseems. The shaft is too high, and there is a spider in the upper Cave.\n\nGo through the Cave on the left into the Ice Cave. OPERATE the PENTAGRAM\n\non the Ice Cave. A strange creature will engulf the ice mass and melt it\n\nto steam.\n\nThere will be a human figure that will float to the next Cave. The\n\nrobed man prompts you to follow the figure and move quickly. Once in the\n\nnext Cave, OPERATE the figure on the pit at the center of the altar. You\n\nhave just killed Dracon, but that doesn't save your brother. You aren't\n\nout of hot water just yet!\n\nGo beyond the altar to the Stairway. OPERATE the NEW KEY on the door at\n\nthe Top of the Stairs. Now that the door is UNLOCKED, OPEN the door. Go\n\nthrough the door. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! LISTEN CLOSELY! IS THAT YOUR\n\nBROTHER THAT YOU HEAR YELLING FOR HELP UPSTAIRS?\n\nGo out of the Study, through the Dining Room, through the Hall, and up\n\nthe stairs to the Upstairs Hallway. Go into Dracon's Old Bedroom. OPEN\n\nthe door in the upper right. Go into the Bathroom. OPERATE the faucet on\n\nthe bathtub. The bathtub will overflow. EXAMINE the light fixture.\n\nNotice that there are handgrips on it?\n\nToo bad you can't reach it. And nothing you can stand on will move for\n\nyou. Maybe with all that water flowing out of the bathtub you can float\n\nto the top. The water is climbing fast! Keep on trying to OPEN the light\n\nfixture. With each attempt, the water gets higher.\n\nFinally, you can OPEN the light fixture. Go through the hole in the\n\nceiling to the Secret Room. Thank God! There he is -- your brother. But\n\nwait a moment he doesn't look too good. What's wrong?"
