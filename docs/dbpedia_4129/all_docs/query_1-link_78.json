        "text": "Ghosts, ghouls and goblins alike will be coming to your door Wednsday night trick or treating, earlier this week we published lists of films to enjoy between visitors, but if movies aren’t your thing, here are 10 horrifying video games, many of which can still be played on modern gaming consoles.\n\n10. Dead Rising 2 (Playstation 3, Xbox 360, PC)- This is a zombie game, no this is THE zombie game, set in the fictional Fortune City, the game follows Chuck Greene as he fights off zombies while accomplishing goals around the city. Various weapons can be picked up, and even customized to as the play makes their way through the game. Up to 7,000 zombie characters can appear on screen at a time.\n\n9. Resident Evil -(Playstation, Sega Saturn, PC, remade and revamped for GameCube and DS, the latter being known as Resident Evil: Deadly Silence) – As a member of S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And Rescue Service), it’s up to you to go to Raccoon City and fight your way through hordes of infected creatures to find your comrades.\n\n8. The House of the Dead (arcade) -One of the best arcade shooter’s I have ever played, not so much scary as creepy, this is just as the title suggests set in a house filled with ‘dead’ things, or rather the inhuman experiments of one very mad scientist.\n\n7. Ghostbusters (Nintendo Wii, Playstation 2 & 3, Nintendo DS, Xbox 360, PSP, PC) -The movie franchise from my youth became a fantastic game a couple of years ago. The game play is fantastic, the story is wonderful and the voice cast is all the originals from the film, what more could one ask for when hunting down the ghosts and ghouls from the netherworld?\n\n6. Uninvited (Atari, Commodore 64, NES, PC) – Your sibling’s left the car after its crashed in front of an old mansion, and you have to find them. A tricky game, not unlike a choose-your-own-adventure, in which strange and horrifying deaths are not uncommon. Keep your wits about you.\n\n5. Silent Hill (Playstation) – Guide Harry Mason through the mysterious and eerie town of Silent Hill to find his daughter, Cheryl. Armed with little skills and weaponry, you’ll face all sorts of monsters while navigating through the foggy patches of this atmospheric game that focuses more on the more psychological aspects of horror.\n\n4. Zombies Ate My Neighbors (Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis) – The title may say zombies, but you’ll be facing all sorts of creeps including vampires, werewolves, blobs, giant ants and aliens as you survive through at least 48 stages of fright and fun (and don’t forget to save those neighbors!).\n\n3. Maniac Mansion (Commodore 64, PC, Atari, Nintendo) – You play as Dave, an average guy who’s braving his way through the Edison mansion to rescue his girlfriend, Sandy. Pick two other controllable characters and see all sorts of weird things, like green tentacles, and avoid the Edisons, Fred, Edna and Weird Ed.\n\n2. Left 4 Dead (Xbox 360, PC) – Zombies have overrun the city. Fight your way through the undead and get to safety, whether alone or with friends. Fast paced, frantic fun with more zombies than you could poke a stick at.\n\n1. Clocktower (Playstation, Super Nintendo) -Play this game alone in the afternoon and it’s completely laughable, wait until 2 a.m. Turn out the lights, gather a group of friends and it’s one of the scariest experiences of your life, even on the second or third time through the game. The game follows a detective as she searches for clues relating to the murder of a woman in town. She is being pursued by a slasher type villain that carries a giant size pair of scissors known as the scissorman. The various endings based on decisions made during game play make for many hours of replayabillity."
