MNM) is an Indian regional political party in the state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry.[3] The party was founded by Kamal Haasan at Madurai on 21 February 2018.[4] He also unveiled the party flag.[5] The flag is symbolised by six interlocked hands, meant to represent co-operation between the Southern states of india (five States and one UT ). Their election symbol is a battery torchlight.[6]\n\nMakkal Needhi Maiam has also launched a mobile whistleblower application named 'Maiam Whistle', open to the public.[7]\n\nThis party is estimated to have around 5,500 office bearers at present.[8]\n\nKamal Haasan, the President of the Makkal Needhi Maiam party, appointed Mr. A.G.

Despite this, all the candidates lost their deposit.[17]\n\nMakkal Needhi Maiam candidates lost their deposit in all the seats it contested in the 2019 Indian general election[18] but they came third in many urban constituencies through it fell behind the Naam Tamilar Katchi in several rural constituencies and Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam in some constituencies[19][20] behind the DMK and AIADMK fronts came first or second in all constituencies.\n\nOn 13 December 2020, Haasan launched MNM's election campaign for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, running candidates in 142 assembly constituencies and committing that he would not form an alliance with either DMK or AIADMK.[21][22] MNM failed to win any seat in the election, with Haasan himself losing to BJP's Vanathi Srinivasan in the Coimbatore South Assembly constituency by 1728 votes.[23]\n\nLater on MNM chief Kamal Haasan allies with Congress to support by-election candidate EVKS Elangovan[24]\n\nNo. Portrait Name\n\n(LIFE) Term in office Assumed office Left office Time in office 1 Kamal Haasan\n\n(1954–) 21 February 2018 Incumbent 6 years, 153 days\n\nNo. Portrait Name\n\n(LIFE) Term in office Assumed office Left office Time in office 1 Arunachalam\n\n(unknown–) 21 February 2018 25 December 2020 2 years, 308 days (1) Arunachalam\n\n(unknown–) 26 February 2023 Incumbent 1 year, 148 days\n\nList of political parties in India"
