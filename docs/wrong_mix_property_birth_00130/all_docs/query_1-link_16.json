Anybody who thinks selflessly about the nation, my MNM will be part of it.\"\n\n\"However, MNM won't join hands with those doing \"local feudal politics,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he has joined the INDIA grouping, he said, \"no, I haven't.\"\n\nOn his party's possible political alliance, he said \"discussions are on,\" and that any \"good news\" in this regard will be communicated to the media.\n\nThe question was asked in the backdrop of speculations that Haasan's party was involved in alliance talks with Chief Minister MK Stalin-led DMK for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.\n\nMNM had earlier faced the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections but failed to put up an impressive show."
