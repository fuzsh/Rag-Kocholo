        "text": "CHENNAI: When a hit pairing of yesteryear comes together yet again, its bound to generate tons of interest. Now, CE has learnt that Kollywood’s reigning queen Sridevi, who had moved to Bollywood, may be back in a meaty role in a Tamil flick with none other than Kamal Haasan as co-star. The film we are referring to is the Tamil remake of the Malayalam hit, Dhrishyam, which is currently being produced by Rajkumar Sethupathy and Wide Angle Creations.\n\nNow, the team is busy finalising the cast of the Tamil version. Apparently, Sridevi has shown interest in the film. Speaking exclusively to CE, producer Rajkumar discloses, “Boney Kapoor was very impressed with the film. We are in talks with Sridevi for the role of the IPS officer.” A call on the final casting will be taken soon. The other names in the running for the cop role include Ramya Krishnan and Asha Sharat, who played the cop in the Malayalam and Kannada versions. And who will reprise the role of Kamal’s wife in the film? “It may be Gauthami, Abirami or Meena,” reveals Rajkumar. It may be recalled that Sridevi is already making a comeback in Tamil with Vijay’s upcoming flick, directed by Simbudevan. But seeing her sharing screen space with Kamal, will be quite a high for fans of the hit yesteryear pair and a casting coup for the producers.\n\nThe thriller, seems to be a big hit in the South so far. Actor Sripriya has directed the Telugu Dhrushyam, co-produced by husband Rajkumar. Says a jubilant Rajkumar, “Dhrushyam has collected a resounding `22 crore within 10 days, in Andhra and Karnataka. In the latter State, it was released in 65 theatres in Telugu. The film starred Venkatesh and Meena with Nadia as the cop.” The Kannada version, titled Dhrishya, was directed by P Vasu."
