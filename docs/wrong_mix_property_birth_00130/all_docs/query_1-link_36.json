        "text": "Fresh off the success of Kalki 2898 AD, Kamal Haasan is now geared up for his next release, Manorathangal. Ahead of the release of the series, the veteran star took a moment to acknowledge the audience’s love for the Prabhas starrer sci-fi drama. In a video message shared on Instagram, the actor shared his excitement, proclaiming Kalki 2898 AD as a major hit.\n\nIn the clip, Kamal Haasan mentioned that the box office numbers for the film are soaring and the film even touched Rs 1,000 crore. “I have acted in over 250 films, but not many films achieve this milestone. It’s a moment to be celebrated,” the veteran actor added. Commemorating the remarkable performance of the film, the actor called for a celebration.\n\nFurther reflecting on the dedication and effort of the team to bring the character of Supreme Yaskin to life, Kamal Haasan noted that director Nag Ashwin went to Los Angeles to perfect his look. Notably, the actor’s character got only a few minutes of screen time in the first part of Kalki 2898 AD. Assuring fans of an extended role in the second installment of the film, he added in the clip, “You’ll see more of me in the second part. I am not going to talk about it now.”\n\nProceeding forward, Kamal Haasan credited the success of Kalki 2898 AD to its ensemble cast and director Nag Ashwin. He even admitted to having a profound connection with the director despite a brief association when compared to others.\n\nKalki 2898 AD, starring Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, Disha Patani and Kamal Haasan, was released on June 27. Set against the backdrop of a dystopian future, the sci-fi thriller is based on the story of a pregnant woman named Sumathi, carrying a child who is the 10th avatar of Vishnu. While the immortal Ashwatthama has been tasked to protect the unborn child, a ruthless villain named Supreme Yaskin wants the child dead."
