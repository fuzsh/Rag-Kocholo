        "text": "Authorities in India's Tamil Nadu state have lifted a ban on actor Kamal Haasan's film Vishwaroopam.\n\nThe actor-director has reportedly reached an agreement with Muslim groups who had objected to the film, saying it was derogatory to the community.\n\nKamal Haasan says it is \"one of the most Muslim-friendly films in recent times\".\n\nThe big budget film, made in the Tamil, Telugu and Hindi languages, has been cleared by the Censor Board.\n\nReports said Kamal Haasan had reached an agreement with the Muslim groups and agreed to delete a number of scenes from the film.\n\nThe groups have decided to call off their protests and withdraw legal cases filed against the filmmaker, reports say.\n\nLast week, a judge lifted a Tamil Nadu government ban on the film imposed after Muslim groups objected to it. The high court then re-imposed a ban on the movie's release until 6 February.\n\nHaasan is the producer, director and the star of the film, which was released abroad and in some states last week.\n\nThe film is now expected to be released in Tamil Nadu on Friday."
