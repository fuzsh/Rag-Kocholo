        "text": "Writer-director Chidambaram's Manjummel Boys is entering its second week in theatres in Kerala and is about to have a Telugu-dubbed version soon. In the meantime, prominent figures from within and beyond Malayalam cinema are showing their appreciation for the film.\n\nEarlier, actor Udhayanidhi Stalin heaped praise on it, and the latest to acknowledge it is actor Kamal Haasan. The film is a based-on-real-life survival thriller that revolves around a group of youngsters who get stuck in the cave from the Kamal Haasan-starrer Guna.\n\nThe cave in Kodaikanal was once known as Devil's Kitche, but it has been named after Guna ever since the film's release because a major part of it was shot there.\n\nKamal met the cast and crew of Manjummel Boys at his office in Chennai the other day. The official Instagram handle of the film shared a picture of the actor with its cast and crew with the caption, \"And here comes the climax of Manjummel Boys, Kamal Haasan sir.\"\n\nFurther, a part of Manjummel Boys includes the 'Kanmani Anbodu' song from Guna.\n\n(This story originally appeared on Cinema Express)"
