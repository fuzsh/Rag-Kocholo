        "text": "Actor and politician Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) on Saturday joined the DMK-led alliance for campaigning in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the party announced on Saturday.\n\nIt also said it bagged one seat for the 2025 Rajya Sabha polls.\n\nThis came amid speculations that Haasan's party might be allotted seats to contest the Parliamentary polls.\n\nThe deal, between Haasan and the ruling party president and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, was finalised at the DMK headquarters, Anna Arivalayam, in Chennai.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTalking to reporters in Chennai, following the announcement, Kamal Haasan said his party \"joined the DMK-led alliance for the sake of the country, and not with any consideration for the post.\"\n\n\"We are not contesting the Lok Sabha elections, but will extend all support to the DMK-led alliance,\" the actor said.\n\n\"This is not about position, but about the country. So, I'm giving support where I have to,\" he added.\n\nMNM will undertake campaign-related work in the 39 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone Puducherry segment, according to the understanding arrived at by the two leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, the DMK was likely to finalise their seat-sharing deal with the Congress by Saturday evening, sources with Stalin's party said.\n\nIn the 2019 general elections, the DMK and the Congress had agreed on a similar share of seats, and the ruling alliance swept the state, winning 38 of the 39 Lok Sabha seats.\n\nThe Congress bagged 8 of the 9 seats it contested then."
