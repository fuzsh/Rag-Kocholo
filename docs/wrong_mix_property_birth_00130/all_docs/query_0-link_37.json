        "text": "Sankalchand Patel University a State Private University in Visnagar, Mehsana, Gujarat was originally established in 1952 as a institution to cater to the needs of local population soon after independence by a freedom fighter and a social reformer, Shri Sankalchand Patel.

They provide a roadmap for prospective students, offering insights into the prestigious institutions that stand as pillars of #knowledge and #innovation. However, it is imperative to acknowledge the inherent #limitations of these rankings, as they often fail to capture the holistic essence of a university beyond mere numbers and statistics. At #OutlookICARE Rankings, we recognize the need for a more nuanced approach in evaluating academic institutions. Our curated list celebrates #excellence in diverse fields, shedding light on institutions that have demonstrated exceptional #expertise and #dedication to their respective areas of study. By highlighting these 'Exclusive Academies of Exceptional Abilities', we aim to redefine the narrative surrounding university rankings and showcase the multifaceted nature of academic excellence. As we embark on this journey of #redefiningexcellence in academia, we invite you to join us in celebrating the achievements of these exceptional institutions. Let us move beyond the confines of traditional rankings and embrace a more #inclusive and #comprehensive approach to evaluating the #impact and #contributions of universities. Together, we can pave the way for a brighter future in higher education, one that truly reflects the rich tapestry of knowledge and innovation that defines our #academic landscape.\n\n#PowerWithinBook Launch Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya New Delhi June 28, 2024 Judging by its cover, it could easily be written off as yet another attempt on leadership glorifying a political leader. Almost echoing this sentiment, in the preface, Dr R Balasubramaniam beautifully elucidates his intent to help the reader delve into the wisdom of the Indic civilization - as conveyed through puranas, itihasa, folklore and ancient scriptures. Read on and one will discover that the book is not primarily about the person or his personality; it delves into the true potential - each person's capacity - to recognize their inner strengths, engage in the necessary practices for self-evolution and allow this evolution to manifest as a societal good. Shri #AjayPiramal, Chairman, Piramal Group beautifully laid out the four foundational S's of leadership - #Sadachar (Virtue), #Sewa (to serve), #Shiksha (learning) and #Sadhna (practice). Together they collectively embody the fifth S, #Shakti (strength). The launch platform provided us an opportunity to stand amongst tall and stellar leaders who are living examples of: Sadachar: Shri Adil Zainulbhai (Intergrity, Dignity & Morality) Sewa: Smt #SwatiPiramal & Shri Ajay Piramal (Service to Humanity) Shiksha: Dr R Balasubramaniam (A Learner at Heart - A Student for Life) Sadhna: HH Sankaracharya Swamy Narayana Theerth (Sharing the Happiness of Advaita Siddhanta) When viewed as a whole, Narendra Modi's life is indeed a fabulous illustration of all the S's. He has helped India and Indians visualize and realize our identity, our respect and our #Shakti to occupy the centre stage in the world. And to have him occupy the front cover, make him the subject of the case study and walk readers through a well-crafted journey through his lived experience and interpret it through western and indic lenses is a much needed attempt especially for today's generation. Go, lay your hands on a copy now. Discover the #PowerWithin YOU!\n\n#POWERWITHIN Western ideology has long held a deep-rooted belief that #leadership is intrinsically related to one's personal traits. This emphasis on 'being a leader' has dominated their approach to understanding and cultivating effective leadership. However, in stark contrast, Indian leadership showcases a different perspective, one that centers around the 'exercise of leadership'. The insightful work of Power Within delves into this fascinating practice, showcasing the profound #wisdom of #Bharat, as embodied in the remarkable life journey of #PrimeMinister #NarendraModi. Through the meticulous exploration of the past fifty years of his public life, the book unravels the #secrets behind his leadership and examines how he uncovered his true #purpose, a purpose that took root during his formative years. Within these illuminating pages, poignant anecdotes shared by his colleagues shed light on the #extraordinary dedication and unwavering #determination that propelled #Modi to the esteemed position of prime minister. Moreover, they underscore his tireless pursuit of #selfdiscovery and his unwavering commitment to serving others. With a masterful touch, R Balasubramaniam weaves together the threads of Modi's leadership journey, drawing upon both #Western and #Indic perspectives. In doing so, he not only provides readers with invaluable insight into the prime minister's remarkable path but also crafts a comprehensive roadmap for those aspiring to a life of #publicservice. This remarkable work serves as a testament to the power of leadership that transcends boundaries, urging individuals to embrace a holistic understanding of leadership that encompasses both personal qualities and active engagement."
