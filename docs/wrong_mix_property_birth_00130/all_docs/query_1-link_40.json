        "text": "Banijay Asia has been quick to position itself as the leading content creation hub in India and South East Asia following its launch two years ago. After developing successful business partnerships with six brands across genres, Banijay Asia today announces the collaboration with Turmeric Media Networks Private Limited and Kamal Haasan to produce content across screens and languages.\n\nCombining the massive fan base of Kamal Haasan and Deepak Dhar’s expertise in content creation and production, the two parties will join forces to gain a strong foothold in the South. The partnership will also see the two entities come together to create long and short-form content across OTT and television.\n\n“We wanted to partner with someone who knew the crux of the content creation and production business. Hence we were in a conversation with Deepak for a while now. With his extensive knowledge in the field, we could see the potential of venturing into a new space of creating regional content in India with Banijay Asia. His understanding of the craft and network have been invaluable in making it a reality. We are excited to collaborate with them to create revolutionary content across all screens and languages,” signs off Kamal Haasan.\n\nCommenting on the partnership, Deepak Dhar, CEO and Founder of Banijay Asia states: “In less than two years, we have created content across genres which has been widely accepted by the viewers. With this partnership, we are confident we will be able to create material which will suffice demands and be appreciated by vast audiences. Along with the mainstream market, we would also like to target the regional base, creating ground-breaking titles for the masses. We at Banijay Asia are proud to have partnered with a personality like Kamal Haasan, who has been a part of our industry for close to 60 years.”"
