He celebrated his 65th birthday on November 7 by unveiling his late father D Srinivasan's statue in his hometown, Paramakudi.\n\nToday (November 8), as a mark of paying respects to his guru (in films), Kamal Haasan unveiled late legendary director K Balachander's statue at his new office in Alwarpet. It was K Balachander who guided Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth to success.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSo, Kamal and Rajinikanth joined hands in unveiling the statue along with K Balachander's daughter Pushpa and family. The event saw many other celebrities namely, Mani Ratnam, Vairamuthu, Ramesh Aravind, Santhana Bharathi, Nasser, KS Ravikumar and several others.\n\nHere are some of the photos:\n\nFollowing the statue unveiling ceremony, everyone spoke high of K Balachander and how his place can never be replaced in the history of cinema. Speaking at the event, Kamal said, \"Rajini and I are fans of each other's work.\"\n\nAfter the event, Kamal Haasan's team has organised a screening of Hey Ram at the iconic Satyam Cinemas in Chennai. Post the screening, Ulagarnayagan will answer questions related to the film and indulge in an interactive session.\n\nA musical concert headlined by Ilaiyaraaja is in the works as well.
