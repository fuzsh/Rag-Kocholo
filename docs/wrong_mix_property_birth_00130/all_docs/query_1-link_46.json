But we will give all cooperation to this alliance. We have joined hands as this is not just for a position, this is for the nation.”\n\nMNM will campaign for the alliance in the 39 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone Puducherry segment.\n\nDMK has allotted two seats each to the Communist Party of India and CPIM, as well as one each to the Indian Union Muslim League and the Kongu Desa Makkal Katchi.\n\nThe Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi has also been allotted two seats. Sources say Congress is likely to get ten seats."
