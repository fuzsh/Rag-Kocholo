        "text": "Actor-politician Kamal Haasan on Wednesday said he has no plans to join the opposition INDIA bloc in the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, adding that he would like to be associated with those who have selfless thoughts for the nation.\n\nEarlier, there was speculation that the Haasan-led Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) would join the Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), who are also part of the INDIA.\n\nHaasan was addressing the reporters in Chennai after leading the 7th anniversary celebration of the MNM party. He also welcomed Tamil actor Vijay who had recently launched his own party ‘Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam,’ (TVG).\n\nThe MNM president stated, “I have already told you that now is the moment to move on from self-thinking politics and worry about the nation. My MNM will include anyone who thinks selflessly about the nation.”\n\n“However, MNM will not cooperate with anyone engaged in local federal politics,” he added.\n\nConcerning the party’s potential cooperation, the actor-politician stated, “Discussions are ongoing, and any good news in this respect will be disclosed to the media.”\n\nWith this statement, it would be interesting to see whether MNM comes into collusion with DMK or not, as the INDI Alliance looks to strengthen their alliance before the announcement of the schedule.\n\nMNM had earlier fought the 2019 Lok Sabha in alliance with the Republic Party of India and the 2021 Tamil Nadu general assembly elections but could not put up a good show. MNM also fought the Pudhucherry general assembly election but fared badly. The Tamil actor established this party in Madurai on February 21, 2018.\n\nDuring the Erode East bypolls in 2023, MNM supported the DMK-Congress candidate EV KS Elavogan, who won."
