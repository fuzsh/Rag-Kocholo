        "text": "Kamal Haasan and S Shankar’s latest vigilante drama, Indian 2, which was released recently, has been struggling to attract audiences despite the film’s hype. Directed by S Shankar, the movie stars Kamal Haasan, Siddharth, Rakul Preet Singh, and SJ Suryah. The sequel to the 1996 blockbuster Indian, the film revolves around the return of the iconic character Senapathy when the country faces rampant corruption. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the film, it failed to meet the expectations of cine-goers, receiving mixed reception. Here’s how much the film has earned on the third day of its release:\n\nAccording to industry tracker Sacnilk, the Kamal Haasan-starrer sequel made a decent opening of Rs 26 crore at the domestic box office. The tracker website suggests that Indian 2 saw a 17.1 percent decline in numbers on Sunday compared to Saturday. This brings the film's total collection after three days to Rs 58.9 crore, with Rs 41.2 crore from the Tamil version, Rs 13.9 crore from the Telugu version, and Rs 3.8 crore from the Hindi version. The film’s production house claims that the first weekend gross is estimated to be around Rs 110 crore worldwide. The weekend collections so far suggest that the film might hit a huge low and may wind up around Rs 150 crore in its full run, based on first Monday’s advance bookings.\n\nIndian 2, produced by Lyca Productions, was made on a budget of approximately Rs 250 crore. However, recent sources reveal that the leading man, Kamal Haasan, received a staggering Rs 150 crore to reprise his role as Senapathy in the sequel. Kamal had earlier revealed that the team faced several challenges, including the movie’s budget and pandemic woes. He said, “The budget was not just decided by the director and the script. COVID-19 decided our budget. Some of the accidents delayed the budget.”"
