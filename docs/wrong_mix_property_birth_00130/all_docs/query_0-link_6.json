        "text": "Actor Kamal Haasan will begin his political journey in earnest on February 21, with public meetings in Ramanathapuram, Paramakudi, Manamadurai and Madurai city. He will also announce the name of his political party on that day.\n\nAs per the schedule released by the actor’s team, he will begin the day with a visit to former president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s house in Rameswaram.\n\nAfter paying visits to the former President’s school and memorial, he will hold an interaction with fisherfolk. He will then proceed to the Ramanathapuram Palace, where he will address the first public meeting of the day. Similar meetings will be held in Paramakudi, Manamadurai and Madurai later in the day. Ahead of the launch of his political party, the actor met CPI leader R. Nallakannu in Chennai on Saturday.\n\nDescribing the meeting as a courtesy call, he said, “This is beyond party affiliation. The reason why I met him is that he has made sacrifices for the people and has lived a humble life,” he said. “I am meeting people who have inspired me. I am getting into politics, and want to take counsel from people who have excelled in it,” he said."
