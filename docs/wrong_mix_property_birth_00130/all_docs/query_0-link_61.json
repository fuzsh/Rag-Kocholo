Both these Tamil veterans worked with Balachander in over 20 films.\n\nKamal Haasan on Thursday celebrated his 65th birthday with members of his family, in hometown Paramakudi.\n\nOn the career front, Kamal Haasan is currently working on Shankar's \"Indian 2\". The film, a sequel to the 1996 superhit \"Indian\", which marks the return the actor as the nonagenarian vigilante, Senapathy.\n\n\"Indian 2\", which hits the screens in 2021, also stars Siddharth, Kajal Aggarwal, Rakul Preet Singh and Priya Bhavani Shankar.\n\nThe team of \"Indian 2\" recently completed an action sequence shot on a budget of Rs 40 crore in Bhopal. The team also briefly shot in Gwalior before wrapping up the second schedule.\n\nThe next schedule will be in Madhya Pradesh from November third week.\n\nKamal Haasan also has the Tamil political thriller \"Thalaivan Irukkindran\", which is rumoured to be a sequel to \"Thevar Magan\", in the pipeline.\n\nMeanwhile, reports emerged earlier this week that the actor has signed \"Kaithi\" director Lokesh Kanagaraj for a new project, which will take off next year.\n\nIANS\n\nhp/vnc\n\n( 244 Words)"
