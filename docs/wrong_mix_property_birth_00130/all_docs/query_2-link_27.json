(courtesy sidmalhotra)\n\nHighlights\n\n\"Congrats Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani,\" tweeted Kamal Haasan\n\n\"Makes my chest swell with pride for my soldiers,\" he added\n\nKaran Johar thanked the film veteran in his tweet\n\nNew Delhi:\n\nThe recently-released film Shershaah got a big shout out from veteran actor Kamal Haasan. In his tweet, the actor praised the film's actors Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani for their performances as well as the film's director Vishnu Varadhan. He wrote in his tweet: \"Thanks Dharma Movies for promoting a talented director like Vishnu Varadhan. Congrats Sidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani, excellent work.\" In a separate tweet, he added, \"Right from my childhood as a film fan and a patriot's son I resented the way Indian army was depicted in some of our cinemas. Shershaah is that exception that makes my chest swell with pride for my soldiers.\"\n\nThe film's producer Karan Johar, thanking Kamal Haasan in his tweet, wrote: \"Thank you so much Sir! This is such an honour for team Shershaah.\"\n\nSee the Twitter exchange here:\n\nShershaah is based on the life of Captain Vikram Batra, who died in the Kargil War and was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra posthumously. Sidharth plays the role of Captain Vikram Batra while Kiara Advani plays the role of Captain Vikram Batra's fiancee Dimple Cheema."
