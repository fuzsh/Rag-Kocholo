Among those joining the students were Chief Investment Officer Jun Yang, Investment Committee Chairman Sean Gavin ’98, IIAG faculty advisor Leonard Smith, and numerous Oberlin trustees and alumni.\n\nDiscussion included critical topics shaping the future of investment strategies faced by educational institutions such as student leadership and shareholder engagement, impact investment frameworks, and the role of fiduciaries. The roundtable fostered collaborative exchanges and embraced diverse perspectives, offering valuable insights to Oberlin’s students, staff, board, and partners."
