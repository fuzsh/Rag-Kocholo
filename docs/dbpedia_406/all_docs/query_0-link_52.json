Tim organized a generous group of five benefactors to establish the founding fund for Posse Chicago. The site opened its doors in 2000 with DePauw University, Denison University and Carleton College as its first partner schools.\n\nTim died in 2021, but his legacy as one of Posse’s most generous and committed stewards lives on.\n\nWe are grateful to the teachers, counselors and community leaders of Chicago, who help us identify incredible high school students. We especially thank our partner colleges and universities for their investments in the program and belief in the promise of Posse Scholars.\n\nPosse Chicago Staff\n\nJacare Thomas, Director\n\nLucy Abrams, Assistant to the Director\n\nDaisy Ayala, Trainer\n\nSamantha Bahena, Senior Career Program Specialist\n\nJoselyn Campoverde, Senior Trainer\n\nGianna Ferguson, Program Coordinator\n\nAlex Garay, Senior Trainer\n\nSimon Jeffrey, Program Director\n\nMarinda Kennedy, Program Director\n\nBritney Lux, Development Associate\n\nCassandra Panganiban, Program Coordinator\n\nGabriela Pantoja-Cortés, Trainer\n\nAida Shilwa, Senior Career Program Specialist\n\nCecily Smith, Trainer\n\nCaryn Turgeon, Development Director\n\nYliana Velazquez, Senior Trainer\n\nSage Willems, Trainer\n\nChicago Advisory Board\n\nJulie Parsons, Retired Chief Operating Officer, Allstate Insurance Company, Advisory Board Chair"
