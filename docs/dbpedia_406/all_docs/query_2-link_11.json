        "text": "Chapin Lawn Display\n\nThe Chapin Lawn display is an exhibit space for the college community to display various forms of art and program and event materials. Shepherd's hooks with a line to affix exhibits will be set up according to the amount of space required for program materials, which will be determined through an event consultation with OSE administrative staff.\n\nNolen Art Lounge\n\nThe Nolen Art Lounge is a versatile, light-filled gallery space. With its adjustable lighting, moving walls and free-standing pedestals, it allows us to constantly change the look of Nolen as well as accommodate many different artistic mediums, including two- and three- dimensional art, movie screenings and dance performances.\n\nThe Office of Student Engagement is looking for student artists interested in displaying their artwork in a professional gallery space on campus to apply. Applicants who are selected for an exhibition slot will be advised on the installation and curatorial process, as well as supported in two accompanying programs: An opening reception, as well as a workshop or discussion that is open to the public.\n\nProposals will be reviewed by the OSE, and accepted exhibitions will be confirmed over email the following week. Questions regarding Nolen should be directed to ose@smith.edu.\n\nThe Art Wall\n\nReservations may not exceed 16 days and must be reserved for a minimum of four days. Included within the 16-day reservation period are setup and takedown days. This means that an exhibit will be online for viewing for a period of 14 days with the first day of the reservation designated for setup and the final day for takedown.\n\nCampus Center Art Wall Guidelines\n\nAll Chapin Lawn reservations are restricted to the lawn itself and may not breach the \"drip line\" or mulched spaces beneath trees located on the lawn. There are limited electrical/power resources in and around the lawn, although additional power may be coordinated through facilities management after the space reservation has been submitted. Staking into the lawn is restricted to avoid damage to the lawn's sprinkler system.\n\nChapin Lawn Display\n\nChapin Lawn display is an exhibit space for the college community to display various forms of art and program and event materials. Shepherd's hooks with a line to affix exhibits will be set up according to the amount of space required for program materials, which will be determined through an event consultation with OSE administrative staff.\n\nChapin Deck\n\nChapin deck comprises the two large concrete and granite \"steps\" before you enter Chapin Lawn. All Chapin deck reservations are restricted to the deck itself and will not exceed the deck space. There are limited electrical/power resources in and around the deck space, although additional power may be coordinated through facilities management after the space reservation has been submitted. Staking into the lawn is restricted to avoid damage to the sprinkler system.\n\nDavis Lawn\n\nDavis Lawn is the area directly in front of Davis and is surrounded by a fence. Setups are coordinated through the events management office in collaboration with facilities management after the space reservation has been submitted. There is no electrical power on the lawn, although power may be supplied by facilities management after the space reservation has been submitted. Staking into Davis Lawn is permitted.\n\nDecorations & Equipment\n\nThe Campus Center requires advance notice of any non-Campus Center equipment that will be brought into the facility. This includes tables, chairs, rental equipment and decorations. You must provide a list of equipment and decorations to the Office of Student Engagement seven days before the event. Helium balloons are not permitted in the Campus Center as they may interfere with the fire detection system. Tape, nails or any other method of affixing items to any surface are not permitted without prior approval.\n\nFood & Beverages\n\nPer the Dining Services policy, food, beverages and refreshments for events in the Campus Center must be ordered and purchased through the Campus Center Café. If using an outside caterer, you must obtain written permission from the cafe manager 10 days before the event; a copy of the permission must be sent to the Office of Student Engagement, Campus Center 106. If permission is granted, a contract between the outside caterer and sponsoring Smith organization must be on file in the OSE before the event takes place.\n\nFurniture\n\nAll lounge spaces have furniture that is permanent to their locations. Due to limited storage, we are not able to remove furniture from rooms, but we can accommodate requests to adjust the furniture in each room. All reservation setups must be requested with a 25 live space reservation. If you would like to move furniture for your event after the request has been submitted, please seek assistance from the OSE Operations Coordinator or the SET. If we are able to accommodate the request, furniture will be moved.\n\nStorage\n\nThe Campus Center has very limited storage space available for event materials. Storage will depend on space availability and is provided for Campus Center events only. The Office of Student Engagement staff must approve all requests for storage no fewer than seven days before the scheduled event. Event organizers should have materials delivered just before their event and removed immediately upon its conclusion. Event sponsors are responsible for moving stored items to the event location on the day of the event. All materials remaining in the Campus Center will be discarded no later than two days after an event has concluded. The OSE staff and Smith College are not responsible for items stored within the facility.\n\nVending Tables\n\nStudents, faculty and staff may reserve vending tables in the Campus Center during the academic year. Vending table reservations are limited to a maximum of three consecutive days. If you wish to use the wireless OneCard machine, please request this when you register your event on the Social Network. There is a monthly charge of 5% of your total sales to use the machine.

The policy is not intended to infringe on the rights of members of the college as individuals to freely express and exchange views and to associate with others. Rather, the policy is intended to ensure the continuity of college work and operations; to avoid the misuse of college facilities or resources in ways which would impair its nonprofit, nonsectarian, independent and nonpolitical status; and to preserve both the fact and the appearance of the college’s impartiality.\n\nSee also the college's Political & Campaign Activities Policy.\n\nEmployees\n\nCollege employees may not engage in solicitation or canvassing of any kind, including solicitation for membership or subscriptions, during working time. In addition, employees may not distribute leaflets or written materials of any kind during working time or at any time in work areas, or in areas where distribution of such materials disrupts services. Working time means the time employees are actually engaged in work and does not include authorized meal time or break time.\n\nEmployees may not use their college positions or the college’s facilities, letterhead, communications media (including campus or electronic mail) or other resources for purposes of political or other solicitation or canvassing.\n\nThe president may provide an exception to permit the use of college staff time and resources for canvassing for contributions, and the use of voluntary payroll withholding, to collect for charitable, educational, or related programs (standing approval has been given for United Way and Service Organizations of Smith), or for programs directly sponsored by the college.\n\nNon-Employees\n\nNon-college individuals, groups or organizations are not permitted to engage in solicitation of any kind, nor may they distribute written material of any kind on college property, except as provided for in official contractual or purchase order arrangements or as explicitly authorized by the controller's office."
