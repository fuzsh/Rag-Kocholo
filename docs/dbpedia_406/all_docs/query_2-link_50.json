        "text": "Painting the Persianate World: Portable Images on Paper, Cloth and Clay\n\nDespite the mountain range that divides them, Greater Iran and the Indian subcontinent have long been in contact through trade and migration. Painting the Persianate World explores the circuitous histories of painted portable images from these regions across three mediums: paper, cloth and clay. Showcasing manuscript illustrations, dye-painted textiles and decorated ceramics, the exhibition draws primarily from the Smith College Museum of Art’s collection and also includes select key works from other local institutions, and is the first comprehensive project at SCMA to examine the Persianate world from a trans-media perspective.\n\nCloudless Blue Egress of Summer by Sky Hopinka\n\nCloudless Blue Egress of Summer is a two-channel film by artist and filmmaker Sky Hopinka on view in SCMA’s Video and New Media Gallery.\n\nSum of Its Parts: Multi-Panel Works on Paper from the Collection\n\nThis installation includes multi-panel photographs, prints, and collages from the SCMA collection made between the 17th and 21st centuries. This selection highlights the long history and many approaches to making modular works of art.\n\nBrought to Life: Painted Wood Sculpture from Europe, 1300–1700\n\nThis exhibition investigates the materials, techniques and reception of painted wood sculpture in Europe between the 13th and the 18th centuries. Polychrome (multicolored) wood sculptures are today recognized as art objects, but at the time they were made, viewers interacted with the sculptures as if they were alive. Most of the works on view here represent sacred figures from Christianity, and their lifelike appearance was central to their function as objects of prayer and devotion. Whether located in a church or a home, the sculptures were part of a multisensory experience.\n\nDeborah Jack: the water between us remembers, so we carry this history on our skins, long for a sea-bath and hope that the salt will heal what ails us (2018)\n\nHow do memory, place, nature, and the afterlives of slavery and colonialism connect? What possibilities do video (as a medium) and beauty (as an aesthetic approach) offer artists interested in these connections?\n\nMultiplying Power: Image as Protest in Prints and Photographs\n\nThis installation displays a range of prints and photographs from the SCMA collection whose circulation documents and sparks social change.\n\nJennifer Crandall: Whitman, Alabama\n\nJennifer Chang Crandall, Smith College’s Lakes Writer-in-Residence for spring 2022, is the creator of the 52-part film \"Whitman, Alabama.\"\n\nThe Ancient World Gallery\n\nIn 2019, the display of SCMA’s ancient art collection was reimagined to provide a more global view of the ancient world. Previously, this gallery’s scope had been limited to Egyptian, Greek and Roman art. The gallery now includes ancient objects from China, Japan, Korea, Persia and the Americas. Arranged in thematic groupings, these artworks span several millennia and encompass a wide range of media.\n\nBlack Refractions: Highlights from The Studio Museum in Harlem\n\nComprised of nearly 100 works in many media, Black Refractions: Highlights from The Studio Museum in Harlem showcases close to a century of creative achievement by artists of African descent, including Njideka Akunyili Crosby, Maren Hassinger, Norman Lewis, Kerry James Marshall, Faith Ringgold, Lorna Simpson, James VanDerZee, and Kehinde Wiley. Founded in 1968, The Studio Museum in Harlem has built an incomparable collection and become a model for how museums can be sites for exchanging ideas about art and society.\n\nDefiant Vision: Prints & Poetry by Munio Makuuchi\n\nThis exhibition is the first to focus on the work of Munio Makuuchi, with more than 50 prints and poetry examples.\n\nAbdessamad El Montassir Residency\n\nAbdessamad El Montassir is SCMA’s spring 2023 Artist-in-Residence. With a deeply research-based approach, he creates film, photography, and sound installations that address histories outside of official narratives, especially as they relate to the western Sahara and themes of memory, intergenerational trauma, and what he describes as the right to forget.\n\nAgano Machiko: Untitled\n\nTrained as a weaver, Agano Machiko is known today for fiber art installations that capture the invisible forces of nature. In the late 1990s, she began knitting fishing line and steel wire together in garter stitch with oversized needles.\n\nColonial Entanglements: Native American Artwork from the SCMA Collection\n\nThis grouping of fourteen objects highlights the relationship between North American Indigenous artists and artists from the European societies that occupy their homelands.\n\nChien-Chi Chang: China Town\n\nChien-Chi Chang's video \"China Town\" documents the experiences of undocumented workers in New York City's Chinatown and their family members in Fujian, China. An immigrant himself, the artist believes immigration is propelled by both suffering and hope.\n\nRed Hook at Bedford Terrace\n\nDuring the 1980s, Sheila Pepe worked at SCMA in multiple roles, beginning as a gallery guard before working as a preparator’s assistant and a curatorial and administrative intern. In 2008, she returned to SCMA, to make Red Hook at Bedford Terrace. For Pepe, Red Hook at Bedford Terrace is a celebration of intersections and connectivity, of places, people, and their labor.\n\nFX Harsono: NAMA\n\nThis installation focuses on the historical erasure and oppression suffered by Indonesia’s ethnic minority Chinese community, who were forced to change their names. The mournful collective performance indicates the artist’s choice of healing and reconciliation over anger or protest when dealing with injustice and trauma.\n\nMaya Lin: Mappings\n\nThis exhibition showcases art by Maya Lin (American, born 1959). The exhibition brings attention to environmental issues like climate change, species extinction and the relationship between humans and the world we inhabit.\n\nIsaac Julien: Lessons of the Hour\n\nIsaac Julien, CBE RA is one of the most important artists working in film and time-based media. Lessons of the Hour is inspired by episodes in the life of freedom fighter Frederick Douglass (1818–1895).\n\nArts of Africa, c. 1825–1960\n\nThis installation, guest-curated by Dr. Christa Clarke, features a selection of African art from SCMA’s collection. They are displayed prominently on the third floor and in proximity to works from Europe and the United States, with a shared thematic emphasis on tradition and transformation. This framework highlights the entangled histories of these regions and centers African visual culture within a broader art history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, enriching the stories we tell about art.\n\nAmanda Williams: An Imposing Number of Times\n\n“How do you bring closure to something that lingers? How do you memorialize an injustice that is ongoing?” These are two of the questions that artist Amanda Williams asks with An Imposing Number of Times (2020–22), a multipart, site-specific artwork that explores how campus traditions create and transmit forms of belonging.\n\nSCMA Then\\Now\\Next\n\nOn the occasion of SCMA’s centennial, this exhibition asks what it means to make and continually remake a museum. Smith College began collecting art at its founding in the 1870s, but it was not until 1920 that the collection was recognized as a museum. Through strategic purchases and generous gifts, the majority of which have come from Smith alumnae, the collection continues to grow. The development of the museum’s collection over the past century reveals the institution’s evolving vision and values.\n\nA Dust Bowl of Dog Soup: Picturing the Great Depression\n\nIn 1935, in the midst of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt needed to generate enthusiasm for his New Deal. The challenge was to find support for investments into programs and services directed primarily to the recovery of rural America, which most city folk had not experienced firsthand. Roosevelt’s conversational and intimate fireside radio chats brought him into people’s homes. His straight talk promised hope and comfort to an ailing nation and highlighted what the government was doing to remedy the country’s ills.\n\nAlma Thomas: The Light of the Whole Universe\n\nThis gallery installation centers on a recent SCMA acquisition, Alma Thomas' 1973 painting Morning in the Bowl of Night, and features artworks from the permanent collection that are largely from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s."
