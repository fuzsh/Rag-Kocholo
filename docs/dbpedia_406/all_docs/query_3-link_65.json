        "text": "Philander Smith College president Roderick Smothers resigned in May, but not before he announced the Methodist-affiliated HBCU’s first graduate degree program, a masters in business administration. To mark the shift, Philander Smith — under the leadership of interim president Cynthia Bond Hopson — will now be Philander Smith University.\n\nIt’s the first name change for the school since 1882, when Walden Seminary (est. 1877) changed its name to honor the financial contributions of Philander Smith and his widow Adeline Smith. From the Encyclopedia of Arkansas:\n\nFrom 1887 to 1891, money contributed by Little Rock residents and the Slater Fund for Negro Education made possible a building for instruction in printing and carpentry. Resisting the national trend of educating African Americans only in “practical” subjects, Philander Smith combined courses in journalism and advertising composition with vocational classes. While it offered elementary and secondary classes, the school’s charter emphasized that it was to be a four-year college, and it offered both BA and BS degrees. … In the late 1880s and the 1890s, the college offered “classical” and “scientific” degrees with courses in Greek, Latin, algebra, and natural philosophy. Moral and religious education, including prayer meetings and Bible studies, was required. Tuition was free for pre-ministerial students and a dollar a month for everyone else. …\n\nIn spite of the challenges faced by all schools entering the twenty-first century, Philander Smith has continued to grow in size and in reputation. The faculty and the student body of the college remain predominately Black. Notable graduates of Philander Smith include Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former U.S. surgeon general; Rev. James H. Cone, professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York; Lottie Shackelford, Little Rock’s first woman mayor; and professional athletes Elijah Pitts and Hubert “Geese” Ausbie. More than forty percent of Philander Smith’s students are first-generation college students."
