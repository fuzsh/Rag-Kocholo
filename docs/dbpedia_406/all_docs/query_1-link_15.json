        "text": "With easier and faster access to information, many colleges and universities are now focused on improving the student experience by enhancing technology and embracing robust change management. Smith College selected Huron to implement Workday Student to improve efficiency and support strategic operations with a student- and faculty-centric approach.\n\nFounded in 1871, Smith College is a private, liberal arts women’s college located in Northampton, Massachusetts, which serves over 2,100 undergraduate students. Smith offers 49 undergraduate majors along with coeducational master’s and doctoral programs. Smith is part of a consortium known as the Five Colleges Incorporated (FCI), including Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The FCI colleges share resources, facilities, and more than 5,000 undergraduate courses for credit among the five members.\n\nThe Workday Student implementation was crucial in the college’s COVID-19 pandemic strategy due to its cloud hosting structure, routing capabilities, and workflow functionality that provided a way to translate critical workflows to a remote context. After deploying Workday Student, Smith College launched its first remote registration period in the middle of the pandemic. Both students and staff were thrilled with Workday Student’s new features and reported successful registration experiences compared to years past. Student testers were thrilled with the new features and say they wish the functionality had been available in years past.\n\nClick below to access a case study from the Tambellini Group to learn more about Smith College’s successful transition to Workday Student using Huron’s integrated approach and methodology centered on the student experience.\n\nDownload the Case Study"
