Other students hope to avoid Greek life altogether, as they believe that fraternities and sororities create a divide on campus.\n\nKeep reading to learn some of the pros and cons of Greek life, and to get a closer look at 31 of the top schools without Greek life. The listing is broken down by research universities, liberal arts colleges, and women’s liberal arts colleges. It’s more common for liberal arts colleges to not have Greek life, so expect those lists to be longer.\n\nPros and Cons of Greek Life\n\nPros\n\nIf you like being part of a close-knit group, and if you love socializing, Greek life might be a great fit. There’s seemingly always something happening in Greek life; plan on receiving lots of invitations to events and parties. Members of fraternities and sororities are introduced to a lot of people through their groups. This is not only helpful for navigating college, but can also pay dividends even after school, as they provide access to large alumni networks.\n\nJoining a frat or sorority will also likely mean you have the opportunity to live in your pledged house in your junior or senior year—and being surrounded by your brothers or sisters can be super fun, as well as supportive.\n\nGreek life also provides an easy avenue for students to get involved on their campus as philanthropy is a large tenet of Greek organizations. Additionally, there are many opportunities to take on leadership roles in your fraternity or sorority that provide great experience.\n\nCons\n\nPledging is a deterrent to many students’ interest in Greek life, and can also be a distraction for students who are getting accustomed to college life. Stereotypes are also common within Greek life, and your affiliation with a particular fraternity or sorority might lead to people making judgments about you.\n\nGreek life has also been classified as being biased and discriminatory. In recent years, issues involving a lack of diversity have arisen in Greek life. It can also be cost prohibitive, as you have to pay dues to remain a member in the organization. Although Greek life scholarships might be available, the thought of paying to be in a club can be off putting for some students.\n\nLastly, Greek life can be socially limiting, as it is common for students to only associate with members of other Greek organizations. In many cases, it’s even more restrictive, as members of some fraternities and sororities will only socialize with other select Greek organizations.\n\nStill wondering if Greek life is important when choosing a college? If so, check out our blog Should Greek Life Matter When Choosing a College?\n\nStudents who don’t wish to participate in Greek life might want to consider attending schools without fraternities and sororities altogether, as that would eliminate any Greek life/non-Greek life divide.\n\n31 Colleges Without Greek Life\n\nSchool\n\nState\n\nAcceptance Rate\n\nUndergraduate Enrollment\n\nAmherst College\n\nMA\n\n9%\n\n1,900\n\nBates College\n\nME\n\n17%\n\n1,800\n\nBoston College | BC\n\nMA\n\n19%\n\n9,900\n\nBowdoin College\n\nME\n\n9%\n\n1,900\n\nBrigham Young University | BYU\n\nUT\n\n59%\n\n31,600\n\nBryn Mawr College\n\nPA\n\n39%\n\n1,400\n\nCarleton College\n\nMN\n\n18%\n\n2,000\n\nFordham University\n\nNY\n\n9,900\n\n58%\n\nFort Lewis College\n\nCO\n\n3,400\n\n93%\n\nGonzaga University\n\nWA\n\n4,900\n\n76%\n\nGrinnell College\n\nIA\n\n1,700\n\n11%\n\nHampshire College\n\nMA\n\n400\n\n75%\n\nHarvey Mudd College\n\nCA\n\n900\n\n10%\n\nHawaii Pacific University\n\nHI\n\n4,000\n\n85%\n\nKalamazoo College\n\nMI\n\n1,200\n\n80%\n\nLoyola University Maryland\n\nMD\n\n3,700\n\n84%\n\nMiddlebury College\n\nVT\n\n2,800\n\n13%\n\nMount Holyoke College\n\nMA\n\n2,200\n\n52%\n\nOberlin College\n\nOH\n\n2,900\n\n34%\n\nPrinceton University\n\nNJ\n\n5,300\n\n4%\n\nReed College\n\nOR\n\n1,500\n\n44%\n\nRice University\n\nTX\n\n4,200\n\n9%\n\nScripps College\n\nCA\n\n1,000\n\n30%\n\nSmith College\n\nMA\n\n2,500\n\n30%\n\nSwarthmore College\n\nPA\n\n1,600\n\n8%\n\nUniversity of Mary Washington\n\nVA\n\n3,600\n\n82%\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nIN\n\n8,900\n\n15%\n\nUniversity of Portland\n\nOR\n\n3,500\n\n81%\n\nVassar College\n\nNY\n\n2,500\n\n20%\n\nWellesley College\n\nMA\n\n2,400\n\n16%\n\nWilliams College\n\nMA\n\n2,100\n\n9%\n\nResearch Universities Without Greek Life\n\n1. Boston College | BC\n\nLocation: Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 9,900\n\nAcceptance rate: 19%\n\nFounded by the Jesuits in 1863, BC has maintained a religious affiliation with the Catholic Church for over 150 years. Boston College follows the Jesuit tradition, fostering links between Jesuit scholars across the globe, promoting global engagement by connecting with international students, recruiting faculty with international backgrounds, and developing global programs.\n\nBC participates in nearly 30 NCAA Division I varsity sports and has one of the country’s highest graduation rates for student-athletes. Its men’s hockey team is of particular note; it’s won five national championships, in 1949, 2001, 2008, 2010, and 212.\n\n2. Brigham Young University | BYU\n\nLocation: Provo, Utah\n\nEnrollment: 31,600\n\nAcceptance rate: 59%\n\nBrigham Young University was founded and is supported by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Non-church members pay almost twice as much to attend BYU than church members. Religion is at the center of BYU student life and students must adhere to a strict Honor Code, which includes abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee; refraining from sexual relations outside a marriage; avoiding the use of vulgarities; attending church regularly; and adhering to grooming standards.\n\nBYU may not have fraternities or sororities, but it does have over 180 student-run organizations and clubs available to its students. It’s worth noting that BYU is found on Campus Pride’s “Absolute Worst List,” which identifies the nation’s most unsafe campuses for LGBTQ youth.\n\n3. Fordham University\n\nLocation: Bronx, New York\n\nEnrollment: 9,900\n\nAcceptance rate: 58%\n\nWith campuses scattered around New York City, Fordham students live and learn in one of the world’s great cities—and the epicenter of everything from international business to entertainment. As a Jesuit university, Fordham recognizes the dignity and uniqueness of each person and bases its education on close collaboration between students, faculty, and staff. A point of pride for the university is that it has been home to 185 Fulbright Scholars.\n\n4. Gonzaga Univerity\n\nLocation: Spokane, Washington\n\nEnrollment: 4,900\n\nAcceptance rate: 76%\n\nGonzaga is a private Jesuit university in Washington state founded in 1887—two years before Washington received statehood. In recent years, the Gonzaga men’s basketball team has helped make the Bulldogs a household name, thanks to their March Madness success. However, the team is yet to win the tournament. Lesser known is that Gonzaga’s football team hasn’t lost a game since 1941—the sport was dropped that year due to World War II and a lack of men and was never revived.\n\nIn addition to football, another thing you won’t find on campus is Greek Life.\n\n5. Hawaii Pacific University\n\nLocation: Honolulu, HI\n\nEnrollment: 4,000\n\nAcceptance rate: 85%\n\nHawaii Pacific University is the largest private institution of higher education in the state. In 2022, the university was ranked the most diverse school in the U.S. A multicultural student body is at the heart of the university’s mission, and students representing 50 states and 60 countries are found on campus. Speaking of campuses, Hawaii Pacific’s three campuses—set in the city, at the foothills of the mountains, and on the coast—offer its students a variety of opportunities. One thing you won’t find at Hawaii Pacific University is Greek Life.\n\n6. Princeton University\n\nLocation: Princeton, New Jersey\n\nEnrollment: 5,300\n\nAcceptance rate: 4%\n\nPrinceton University is one of the nation’s best, most prestigious, and oldest colleges. The university was founded more than two and a half centuries ago, in 1746. Two U.S. presidents are Princeton alumni—James Madison and Woodrow Wilson—and the school served as the U.S. capital for a few months in 1783 when the Continental Congress met in Princeton’s Nassau Hall.\n\nRather than Greek Life, eating clubs play an integral role in the social life at Princeton. The tradition dates back to the 1870s and began in response to the school’s opposition to fraternities, along with its lack of dining options.\n\n7. Rice University\n\nLocation: Houston, Texas\n\nEnrollment: 4,200\n\nAcceptance rate: 9%\n\nLocated in the heart of the nation’s fourth-largest city—Houston, Texas—Rice University offers an active environment for students both on and off campus. Combining the advantages of a liberal arts college with the resources and facilities of a world-class research university, Rice students are afforded the opportunity to explore a wide range of academic interests. Rice has a well-deserved reputation as one of the best values in higher ed.\n\nThe university does not consider an applicant’s financial situation when deciding admission and meets 100% of all admitted students’ demonstrated financial need. Even better, Rice is a loan-free institution, with financial aid packages consisting of grant and institutional aid—which don’t require repayment—and no loans.\n\n8. University of Notre Dame\n\nLocation: Notre Dame, Indiana\n\nEnrollment: 8,900\n\nAcceptance Rate: 15%\n\nRather than Greek Life, Notre Dame’s 30 single-sex residence halls are at the center of the school’s social life. As a Catholic University, faith plays an important role in the lives of its students, as religious thought intersects with the arts, sciences, and other areas of academics and creativity. Studying abroad also plays a large role in the academic careers of Notre Dame students—over half of the university’s students study abroad.\n\n9. University of Portland\n\nLocation: Portland, Oregon\n\nEnrollment: 3,500\n\nAcceptance Rate: 81%\n\nThe University of Portland (affectionately known as UP) is located just seven miles from Portland’s bustling downtown and offers a variety of urban opportunities while also providing easy access to outdoor destinations such as the Oregon coast, Mount Hood, and the Columbia River Gorge. As a Catholic University, the school strives to create forward-thinking future leaders by teaching students to think critically, communicate effectively, and respond ethically. It also creates global citizens; the university’s study-abroad programs are extremely popular with students.\n\nLiberal Arts Colleges Without Greek Life\n\n10. Amherst College\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 1,900\n\nAcceptance Rate: 9%\n\nNoted for its academics, Amherst College is a member of the Five College Consortium—along with Smith, Mount Holyoke, Hampshire, and UMass Amherst—that allows students to take courses at any of these colleges. Amherst also has a reputation for the affordability of its education; it is one of the few no-loan, need-blind colleges that promises to meet 100% of accepted students’ demonstrated financial need.\n\n11. Bates College\n\nLocation: Lewiston, Maine\n\nEnrollment: 1,800\n\nAcceptance Rate: 17%\n\nThe first coeducational college in New England, Bates College has a long history of inclusivity and believes in the learning potential in our differences—this is one of the reasons why you won’t find any fraternities or sororities on its campus. Learning from other people and cultures is also why more than half of Bates students study abroad. Bates uses a unique 4-4-1 academic calendar that features a five-week spring term, where students can hone in on a single subject or participate in an off-campus program.\n\n12. Bowdoin College\n\nLocation: Brunswick, Maine\n\nEnrollment: 1,900\n\nAcceptance Rate: 9%\n\nBowdoin has not always been a college without Greek life—it abolished fraternities in 1997. In lieu of Greek life, Bowdoin now employs a system of college-owned social houses to encourage students to live together, eat together, and learn from one another. Bowdoin is also home to numerous societies such as the Peucinian Society (one of the oldest literary and intellectual societies in the country) and an outing club that offers 100 excursions a year. Bowdoin is a need-blind school and has replaced loans with grants in their aid packages. The college will even waive application fees for first-generation college students.\n\n13. Carleton College\n\nLocation: Northfield, Minnesota\n\nEnrollment: 2,000\n\nAcceptance Rate: 18%\n\nWith its reputation for academic excellence—18 Rhodes Scholars and 133 Fulbrights awarded to students and alumni since 2000—you might think Carleton College is filled with stuffy scholars, but you’re wrong. The “Carls” is a fun, quirky group with over 200 student organizations including dance groups and comedy troupes along with intramural sports such as quidditch and dodgeball. While education is a priority, the school’s unique traditions help lighten the mood; for example, the “Silent Dance Party” occurs before finals, where students don headphones and dance together in the library.\n\n14. Fort Lewis College\n\nLocation: Durango, Colorado\n\nEnrollment: 3,400\n\nAcceptance Rate: 93%\n\nFort Lewis College was originally an army post before becoming an educational institution for American Indians in 1911. Today, the college maintains a large Native American presence: 180 Native American Tribes and Alaska Native villages are represented on campus, and students of color make up over half of the student body.\n\nFort Lewis College does not have Greek Life, however, it does have a variety of other organizations on campus, including its renowned Fort Lewis College Cycling Team. The team has won more than 20 national championships—in mountain biking, cyclocross, and road racing—and has been USA Cycling’s top Division 1 team five times.\n\n15. Grinnell College\n\nLocation: Grinnell, Iowa\n\nEnrollment: 1,700\n\nAcceptance Rate: 11%\n\nSocial responsibility, cultural awareness, and mutual respect are core values at Grinnell College, and one result of this is the school’s reputation for social activism—it ranks near the top among schools of its size for sending volunteers to the Peace Corps. Likewise, more than half of Grinnell’s undergraduates participate in a study abroad program. Don’t let the remote location—it’s sometimes called “Little School on the Prairie”—or its lack of Greek life fool you into thinking it’s a quiet campus. The school is home to more than 100 student organizations and hosts a wide array of activities ranging from concerts to film festivals.\n\n16. Hampshire College\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 400\n\nAcceptance Rate: 75%\n\nHampshire College is known for its especially unorthodox academic system, where there are no predetermined majors (all students create their own!), and students aren’t given grades, but instead “narrative evaluations.” Another thing you won’t find at Hampshire College is Greek Life.\n\nWhile you won’t find fraternities or sororities on Hampshire College’s campus, the school is home to more than 50 student organizations. It’s also a member of the Five College Consortium, which allows students to take advantage of the resources—including student organizations and activities—at Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n17. Harvey Mudd College | HMC\n\nLocation: Claremont, California\n\nEnrollment: 900\n\nAcceptance Rate: 10%\n\nSmall and distinguished, Harvey Mudd College is one of the nation’s best schools for students studying math, science, and engineering. Despite its small size and lack of fraternities and sororities, Harvey Mudd has an active campus: 99% of students live on campus.\n\nThe college is a member of Claremont Colleges, a collection of seven highly selective schools located in Claremont that make classes, dining halls, libraries, parties, sports teams, and other resources available to one another. On campus, students will find organizations such as the Gonzo Unicycle Madness Club, whose Foster’s Run—a unicycle ride to a local donut shop—is a well-known school tradition.\n\n18. Kalamazoo College\n\nLocation: Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nEnrollment: 1,200\n\nAcceptance Rate: 80%\n\nKalamazoo College is best known for its K-Plan, which provides students with an individualized curriculum. The K-Plan provides a dynamic learning experience—students participate in internships, externships, and service learning projects domestically, while gaining international and intercultural experience through participation in one of its 56 study abroad programs. While students won’t find Greek life on campus, they’ll find fun events like Zoo Flicks (movie screenings) on Friday nights, and Zoo After Dark (free food and games) on Saturday nights.\n\n19. Loyola University Maryland\n\nLocation: Baltimore, Maryland\n\nEnrollment: 3,700\n\nAcceptance Rate: 84%\n\nLoyola University Maryland is a Jesuit liberal arts school and the first institution in the U.S. to bear the “Loyola” name. Loyola is the surname of St. Ignatius, founder of the Jesuits. Like many schools that follow the Jesuit tradition, Loyola University Maryland does not have Greek Life.\n\nDespite the absence of fraternities and sororities, the university is home to an active and social student body—81% of undergraduates live on campus and the school is home to more than 200 clubs, including 17 clubs “that will help you make the world a better place.” In the spring, the university hosts Lollapalooza, an annual concert/carnival/gathering/festival for the entire student body that has featured diverse acts like Blues Traveler, T-Pain, and The All-American Rejects.\n\n20. Middlebury College\n\nLocation: Middlebury, Vermont\n\nEnrollment: 2,800\n\nAcceptance Rate: 13%\n\nMiddlebury students with an interest in skiing are likely to not notice the absence of Greek life on campus when the snow starts to fly. Middlebury has 17 trails on the Middlebury College Snow Bowl ski area and is home to the country’s oldest winter carnival.\n\nMiddlebury uses a 4-1-4 academic calendar, which includes two four-month-long semesters, with a month-long mini-session in between. This mini-session allows Middlebury students to explore a specific class or opportunity. Middlebury is also especially known for its study abroad programs and immersive summer language programs, where students must sign a pledge promising to speak only the foreign language of the program.\n\n21. Oberlin College\n\nLocation: Oberlin, Ohio\n\nEnrollment: 2,900\n\nAcceptance Rate: 34%\n\nOberlin is committed to inclusivity, and while students won’t find Greek Life on campus, they will have ample opportunities to connect with their peers. Students are required to live on campus, in traditional residence halls, identity- and language-based housing, and theme houses ranging from the Sci-Fall Hall (a science fiction and fantasy theme living community) to Roots in STEM (a living-learning community that promotes a sense of belonging and community in STEM amongst underrepresented students). Small, domestic-style houses and college-owned apartments are available to seniors and some juniors, allowing them to get a taste of post-college life.\n\n22. Reed College\n\nLocation: Portland, Oregon\n\nEnrollment: 1,500\n\nAcceptance Rate: 44%\n\nReed College is known for its intellectual vigor and inclusivity. Reed is ranked fourth in the nation in the percentage of graduates who earn PhDs and has produced numerous notable figures—for example, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger graduated from Reed, while Apple founder Steve Jobs attended Reed before dropping out.\n\nResidential life is at the core of the Reed experience and residence halls are part of neighborhoods that are broken down by year: first-year students live in first-year neighborhoods, sophomores live in sophomore neighborhoods, and juniors and seniors live in upper-division neighborhoods.\n\nAll Reed students are governed by the school’s Honor Principle, a non-codified philosophy of behavior that encourages mutual respect and thoughtfulness.\n\n23. Swarthmore College\n\nLocation: Swarthmore, Pennsylvania\n\nEnrollment: 1,600\n\nAcceptance Rate: 8%\n\nA number of characteristics distinguish Swarthmore from other liberal arts colleges, one of which is its undergraduate engineering program—an oddity for a liberal arts school. Another is the school’s traditions; for example, the Crum Regatta, an event where students race homemade boats down Crum Creek. Swarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, along with Bryn Mawr and Haverford College, which allows Swatties to take classes at any of the participating schools.\n\n24. University of Mary Washington\n\nLocation: Fredericksburg, Virginia\n\nEnrollment: 3,600\n\nAcceptance Rate: 82%\n\nAccording to the University of Mary Washington, the school “is not affiliated with single-sex Greek social fraternities or sororities.” However, fraternities and sororities like Zeta Omega Delta, Psi Upsilon, Alpha Mu Sigma, and Kappa Sigma are found off-campus. Additionally, the University of Mary Washington recognizes and is affiliated with a handful of Greek academic honorary societies.\n\nThe university is committed to diversity and inclusion. The school is home to students from 33 states and 22 countries. More than 150 student-run organizations call campus home, ranging from a student newspaper to a Geek Alliance which is dedicated to anime, video games, and Doctor Who. Looking for something more active? You can play on one of the university’s 20+ club sports teams.\n\n25. Vassar College\n\nLocation: Poughkeepsie, New York\n\nEnrollment: 2,500\n\nAcceptance Rate: 20%\n\nVassar might not have Greek life, but the school does possess an active and vibrant on-campus community, with 98% of the student body living in the school’s residence halls and apartments, and 100+ student organizations. Vassar’s distinguishing characteristic is that it does not have a core curriculum; rather, students can declare a major by concentrating in a department, an interdepartmental program, a multidisciplinary program, or an Independent Program. This academic freedom has earned Vassar students a reputation for being free and original thinkers.\n\n26. Williams College\n\nLocation: Williamstown, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 2,100\n\nAcceptance Rate: 9%\n\nOne of the 18 schools that make up the “Little Ivies,” a group of select liberal arts schools in the Northeast. Williams College is notable for many things in addition to its world-class education. The Williams alumni society is the oldest in the world, and its graduating class of 1887 was the first to wear caps and gowns at graduation. Williams eliminated fraternities in the 1960s, but students today will find that camaraderie-building events like a schoolwide trivia contest and Mountain Day (an event where students hike nearby Mount Greylock) solidify school spirit and community.\n\nWomen’s Liberal Arts Colleges Without Greek Life\n\n27. Bryn Mawr College\n\nLocation: Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania\n\nEnrollment: 1,400\n\nAcceptance Rate: 37%\n\nWomen’s-only and sorority-free Bryn Mawr has a host of options for students looking to balance a single-sex education with coed opportunities. The school is a member of the Tri-College Consortium—with Haverford College and Swarthmore College—which allows students to take classes and attend social events at member schools. Bryn Mawr students may also take classes at the University of Pennsylvania. The college’s Praxis program provides students with the chance to put what they learned in the classroom to work in the real world, placing students in a wide variety of organizations in the community.\n\n28. Mount Holyoke College\n\nLocation: South Hadley, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 2,200\n\nAcceptance Rate: 52%\n\nA residential college, almost all of Mount Holyoke’s students live on campus—creating a tight-knit community that is academically rigorous, intellectually adventurous, and socially conscious. While the college is without Greek life, it is rich in collaborative spirit. Mount Holyoke is part of the Five College Consortium—along with Amherst, Hampshire, Smith, and UMass Amherst—which allows students to take courses and attend events at member schools. It’s also part of the Twelve College Exchange Program, where students can study at one of the eleven other member schools for one or two semesters.\n\n29. Scripps College\n\nLocation: Claremont, California\n\nEnrollment: 1,000\n\nAcceptance Rate: 30%\n\nIt’s easy not to notice the absence of sororities on Scripps College’s campus—it’s one of the prettiest campuses in the nation and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Scripps balances their students’ desires for a small college experience with the academic and social resources of a large institution. A member of the Claremont Colleges, the women of Scripps can take classes at any of the other consortium schools. The spirit of the collegiate community expands outside of the classroom as well; for example Scripps, Claremont McKenna, and Harvey Mudd field joint athletic teams that play under the name of the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Athenas.\n\n30. Smith College\n\nLocation: Northampton, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 2,500\n\nAcceptance Rate: 3%\n\nNot only will you not find Greek life on the campus of Smith College, but you also won’t find traditional dorms. Rather, Smith students live in one of 35 separate houses. Ranging from gothic to modern styles, Smith student housing ranges from building capacity for 10 students to 100.

Wellesley College\n\nLocation: Wellesley, Massachusetts\n\nEnrollment: 2,400\n\nAcceptance Rate: 16%\n\nWhile there is no Greek life on the campus of Wellesley College, it does offer one of the most diverse college communities in the nation—students hailing from 60 countries are enrolled at the school.

Although the majority of OSU students aren’t members of a Greek organization, Greek Life is a long-standing tradition at the school—it’s been on campus for over 140 years.\n\nOhio State fraternities and sororities also dispel some common myths (namely, poor grades and partying)—the all-Greek GPA is consistently above the school average and last year OSU fraternities and sororities contributed more than 55,000 hours of community service.\n\n7. Temple University\n\nLocation: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nEnrollment: 25,900\n\nAcceptance Rate: 72%\n\nFraternities and sororities have played a part in the Temple experience since 1903.
