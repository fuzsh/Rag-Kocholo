        "text": "Office of Alumnae Relations and Development\n\nAssociate Director for Strategic Fundraising Initiatives\n\nWhat brought you to Smith?\n\nSmith holds a special place in my heart, as my spouse and best friend are both Smithies, classes of 2010 and 2014, respectively. Hearing, and seeing, how Smith impacted their lives made me want to work for an institution that inspires leaders. In April of 2019, that dream became a reality when I started as the alumnae relations and reunion assistant.\n\nWhat do you do here?\n\nI support the college’s fundraising efforts both internally and externally. Part of my work allows me to engage with the Committee on Regional Participation (CORP), an alum based volunteer group focused on supporting Smith’s fundraising priorities and educating others around philanthropy. Internally, I work to identify the connections between fundraising opportunities, campus partners and our alums. I love the mix of relationship building and analytical thinking in this role!\n\nPlease share something you are proud of about the impact of your work.\n\nI take immense pride in helping alums and colleagues find the tools, resources, and answers they need to be successful.\n\nWhen you’re not working or traveling for Smith, what are you most likely to be found doing?\n\nDuring the summer and fall, you can find me on the softball diamond. I manage and play for two different teams: one is in an inclusive women's modified fast-pitch league, and the other is a co-ed slow-pitch league.\n\nWhat are you reading/watching/digging into these days?\n\nAfter years of listening to podcasts, Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard is one of my all-time favorites, I've recently discovered the joy of audiobooks. I have been on a historical fiction kick lately and been consuming a lot of Kate Quinn’s work.\n\nIf you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?\n\nToo many places! I aspire to visit all 50 states and all 30 Major League Baseball parks. In my junior year of college, I spent a semester on Paros Island in Greece, and I'd love to go back. I'd also enjoy seeing more of Europe; Ireland is at the top of my list.\n\nWhat’s a project you are passionate about?\n\nI'm passionate about projects that create inclusive communities. Growing up, I had the privilege of blending into different groups at school and in my local community, but I never felt like I truly belonged in any of them. The process of starting a feminist club at my college showed me what belonging to a community truly feels like. Now, I seek leadership opportunities that allow me to create spaces for others to feel accepted and included.\n\nWhat’s a fun fact about you?\n\nOne of my cats is named Swag, after the Program for the Study of Women and Gender at Smith.\n\nFavorite Smith tradition?\n\nMountain Day\n\nWhich do you prefer: Bulb Show or Mum Show?\n\nBulb Show"
