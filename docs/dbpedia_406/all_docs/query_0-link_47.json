        "text": "There are good reasons why UC Berkeley is ranked No. 1 Public University and fourth best globally by the U.S. News & World Report. The University of California at Berkeley is one of the most liberal colleges in the United States due to its history of anti-war and anti-racist political activism.\n\nFounded in 1868, UC Berkeley is the oldest institution in the University of California college network and is often considered a public Ivy, meaning it upholds similar academic standards to private Ivy League schools. The student body at Berkley is large, with 35,000 undergrads and roughly 12,000 graduate students.\n\nOut of the 184 academic programs, the most popular majors at Berkeley are in sciences, with engineering, computer science, political science, biology, and economics topping the list. Yet Berkeley itself is an artistic town, and there’s a range of art museums and cultural centers that creative students can peruse.\n\nBerkley is known for its successful athletics department, and students on campus can participate in programs or attend sporting events. Notable alumni include:\n\nSteve Wozniak\n\nJoan Didion\n\nRube Goldberg\n\nChris Pine\n\nGregory Peck\n\nFounded in 1837, Mount Holyoke is a private liberal arts college located in South Hadley, Massachusetts. As a women’s college, Mount Holyoke belongs to the Seven Sisters program, founded by Mary Lyon to provide equal access to education for women.\n\nThe Mount Holyoke student body can take a range of classes across three core categories: humanities, science and math, and social sciences. This college is particularly liberal because it’s rooted in the belief that women can and should make a difference in the world, and they’re taught how to break down traditional structures of oppression by championing equality for all.\n\nMount Holyoke also partners with Amherst College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst (as part of the Five College Consortium), so students can enroll in courses at these institutions as well. Students can get involved in a range of on-campus activities and clubs, including art, club sports, politics, performing arts, and religion.\n\nMount Holyoke is known for having numerous quirky traditions, like other liberal arts schools. Take the Canoe Sing, for example, where graduating seniors decorate canoes with lanterns and sing songs. Famous alumni include:\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\nElaine Chao\n\nFrances Perkins\n\nFounded in 1833, Oberlin College is a liberal arts school and conservatory that emphasizes individualism and creativity. This college was one of the first in the United States to admit African Americans and women, and it continues to lead in equality and activism. Oberlin College is located in Oberlin, Ohio and is known for having liberal students focused on political activism, equality, and LGBTQ rights.\n\nOberlin’s conservatory is the oldest operating conservatory in America and is highly selective. There are many other ways students can pursue musical and artistic passions at Oberlin outside the conservatory. For example, the art department is home to majors like art history, studio art, and visual art. Of the 44+ majors, common areas of study at Oberlin include:\n\nBiology\n\nHistory\n\nEnvironmental studies\n\nLiterature\n\nWith a total undergraduate enrollment of just 2,846, Oberlin is one of the smaller college campuses on our list.

Wesleyan has a low acceptance rate and is known for promoting independent study and interdisciplinary learning.\n\nWesleyan University is known for creative majors like:\n\nPsychology\n\nVisual and performing arts\n\nEnglish literature\n\nGender and culture studies\n\nMore than 70% of Wesleyan students study language, which often leads to studying abroad. In fact, more than 300 students study abroad each year.\n\nThe university part of the Little Three, which is a trio of prestigious regional liberal arts schools (alongside Williams and Amherst). This designation belongs to a greater group of institutions called the Little Ivies, which includes a handful of the most liberal colleges across the Northeast, including Colgate, Middlebury, and Swarthmore.\n\nWesleyan students can join student groups like Artifex Magazine, the on-campus literary magazine, and the Natural Science and Mathematics Coalition, among nearly 300 groups total. Notable Wesleyan alumni include:\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, actor, producer, and musician\n\nJoss Whedon, filmmaker and comic book writer\n\nSantigold, singer and songwriter\n\nMajora Carter, urban revitalization strategist\n\nMatthew Weiner, television writer, director, and producer\n\nBard College is located in Upstate New York, in Annandale-on-Hudson in Dutchess County and is one of the most liberal colleges in America.

Entrepreneurship and policy are additional popular study areas that Bard College encourages students to pursue.\n\nThe campus is within the Hudson River Historic District, a national public landmark, and students have access to thousands of historic documents and volumes at the Charles P.

Students can choose from a wide range of liberal arts majors, including:\n\nEconomics\n\nComparative literature\n\nFilm studies\n\nWomen’s studies\n\nRomance languages\n\nBryn Mawr students are encouraged to choose a niche area of study, but explore different fields and interests for a well-rounded education.

Mills College is also often ranked highly for its value, as it offers a high-quality education at a relatively low price, especially in comparison to other liberal arts schools.\n\nStudents at Mills can choose to create their own individualized major. This path enables undergraduates to explore a range of interests and passions outside the traditional realm of majors. American politician Barbara Lee, radio personality and broadcaster Renel Brooks-Moon, and singer and actress Joanna Newsom are all notable Mills College alumni.\n\nPortland State University (PSU) is one of a handful of public research universities that are considered exceptionally liberal. Likewise, U.S. News & World Report ranks PSU as one of the nation’s most innovative universities.\n\nPortland is one city that’s passionate about doing good in the world, and its university demonstrates this ethos. While Portland’s admissions rate is fairly high, students at PSU will be challenged to think critically in new ways.\n\nPSU is also less of a party school, and both students and faculty members are focused on enacting positive change through environmentalism, social justice, and redefining what it means to be an American university in the current era.\n\nPortland State University is located in the heart of Portland, Oregon, yet students still have access to traditional campus elements like rolling green lawns and elegant libraries. Famous PSU alumni include:\n\nCarolyn Davidson, graphic designer (designed the Nike Swoosh logo!)\n\nHolly Madison, American television personality\n\nClint Didier, American football player and politician\n\nMike Richardson, professional football player\n\nSarah Lawrence College is among the best liberal colleges located outside of New York City in Bronxville, New York.

This makes it a great choice for liberal arts students longing for personalized study and guidance from dedicated faculty members. Students who want to work closely with experts in their fields, especially in the visual and performing arts, will likely succeed at Sarah Lawrence.\n\nSarah Lawrence was at one time a women’s school and continues to maintain more female students than men, but it’s open to all genders.

San Francisco State offers a wide range of majors and has a lower cost than most other schools on this list, making it a solid choice for liberal students who want an interdisciplinary education for a great value.\n\nThe student body is around 25,917, making it considerably larger than most liberal arts schools.
