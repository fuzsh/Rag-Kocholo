        "meta_description": "Hi there! I can definitely suggest a few places that have a vibe similar to Smith College. Look into Wellesley College in Massachusetts—it's another women's college known for cultivating strong leaders with its rigorous academics, especially in the humanities. Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania also stands out for its empowering environment and collaborative approach to learning within the humanities. Mount Holyoke College, part of the Seven Sisters colleges (along with Smith and Wellesley), is another school to consider for its strong focus on women's education and robust humanities programs.\r\n\r\nBarnard College in New York, which is affiliated with Columbia University, is another excellent choice that offers the benefits of a women's college alongside access to the resources of a large, co-ed institution. My advice would be to explore these colleges and try to visit campuses, if possible, to really get a feel for each one's unique atmosphere!",
