These schools offer academic opportunities such as small class sizes and inclusive communities.\n\nWomen's colleges emerged when most colleges and universities barred women from enrolling.\n\nThe Women's College Coalition reports that today, about 5% of women college students attend women's colleges. Women's colleges in the U.S. account for a small section of expanding higher education options.\n\nDr. Gretchen Edwalds-Gilberts, acting vice president for academic affairs and dean of faculty at Scripps College, said, \"Women's colleges afford students a supportive, academically rigorous environment that allows them to develop as leaders in curricular and co-curricular areas.\"\n\nWhat Is a Women's College?\n\nMany women's colleges are liberal arts institutions focusing on educational pursuits such as creative arts, sociology, and literature.\n\nThe first women's college, Georgia's Wesleyan College, opened its doors in 1836. By 1960, 230 women's colleges offered higher education opportunities to women across the country. Since then, many women's colleges have closed their doors — leaving fewer than 50 women's colleges open today.\n\nOver time, decreasing demand for single-gender institutions forced some women's colleges to change their educational focus. Others have changed their admissions policy by welcoming men and nonbinary students. Many institutions, including all on this list, have clarified their admission policies to include transgender women.\n\nWhile some women's colleges experienced steady or increasing enrollment in recent decades, most encountered financial loss due to low enrollment. The Me Too movement and other political actions have helped increase applications to women's colleges, providing a much-needed boost for many institutions.\n\nElizabeth Dion, a senior theater and international studies double major at Hollins University, said, \"I personally wasn't looking explicitly for a women's college during my college search. I just happened to stumble upon Hollins and felt immediately drawn to it, but I am so glad I did find my historically women's college because I don't know who I'd be without it.\"\n\nWomen's colleges offer a unique experience that many women find academically, socially, and financially beneficial. This guide lists some of the top women's colleges in the United States using various ranking criteria. It can help you decide which college might be the best for you.\n\n2023 Best Women's Colleges\n\nRankings compiled by the BestColleges Ranking Team\n\nHow We Rank Schools\n\nAt BestColleges, we believe a college education is one of the most important investments you can make.
