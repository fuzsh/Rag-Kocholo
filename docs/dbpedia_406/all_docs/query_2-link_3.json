As you pack, settle in, and get acquainted with the campus, check out some resources to help you find everything you need.\n\nSJ Senet ’26\n\nPsychology major; Neuroscience minor\n\n“I feel like the Smith community is one of the strongest building blocks of having an amazing college experience. Everyone is so supportive of one another, there is always someone willing to go practice, go to the gym, or go get food. The respect Smithies have for each other is unmatched.”\n\nA Community in Athletics\n\nMegan Nolan\n\nReserves Coordinator, Smith College Libraries\n\n“To me, community is teamwork which moves towards a shared goal. At Smith, these goals involve getting the students the knowledge they need to have success, assisting our faculty in bringing prestige to our institution, and taking care of the staff members so everyone becomes a part of the circle, and nobody feels left out.”\n\nExplore the Libraries\n\nRicha Nagar\n\nGloria Steinem ’56 Endowed Chair in Women & Gender Studies\n\n“I have not yet arrived at Smith but I look forward to committing myself to engaging with, co-building, and nourishing a community where dreaming and working for justice are deeply cherished labors of love by all.”\n\nWho We Are\n\nDariana Guerrero ’17\n\nDevelopment Manager, Groundwork Lawrence\n\n“Being able to see yourself and your narratives—even just a slice of your language and your culture—can mean a world of difference. As an English language and literature major and a creative writing concentrator, I spent a lot of time in the poetry center. Poetry was an avenue that gave me space and a sense of liberation.”\n\nCommunity through Poetry"
