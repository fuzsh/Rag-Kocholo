        "text": "Have an idea for an organization at Smith that would have lasting relevance to the community? Is there enough student interest to support such an organization? How do you get an organization started at Smith College? The SGA Chartering Committee can help.\n\nSubmit a Proposal\n\n1. Gauge interest among your peers. Start a list of interested members for your organization. If the list is greater than 10 people, you can start the process of chartering or recognizing your organization.\n\n2. Decide if you want to charter or recognize your organization. The difference between these two types of student organizations is further explained on the SGA Website under “Chartering Committee”.\n\nA recognized organization is able to have a Smith email address, have space on the Smith Student Social Network, reserve space in campus buildings, and use campus vans for transportation.\n\nA chartered organization has all of the same resources as a recognized organization. In addition, a chartered organization is able to submit funding requests to the Finance Committee for events, projects, supplies and equipment.\n\n3. Start a charter for your organization using the sample charter provided. We encourage building off of the current format and not taking away any of the pieces currently in the sample format. In the charter you must:\n\nFill out organization name and information where it says ‘xxx’\n\nDescribe the goals and purpose of the organization\n\nDescribe the frequency of meetings and specifically what will occur during meetings\n\nChoose to be funded or not funded by the Finance Committee (recognized or chartered)\n\nChoose a nondiscrimination policy (will you allow 5 College Students to join)\n\n4. Schedule a meeting with the Chartering Committee Chair. They will offer advice, explain the chartering process, and answer any questions about the charter that still remain or pertain to your student organization.\n\n5. Share your charter Google Doc with the Chartering Committee for review. The Chartering Committee will help you revise your charter, so that you can be approved. If you want to be a recognized organization, you are now done with the process and are now officially recognized by Smith College. Congrats! Once approved, the Office of Student Engagement will be in touch about the Smith Social Network and Organization Leader Training.\n\n6. If you are looking to be chartered, you will be scheduled to attend a hearing at a SGA Senate meeting; this is your opportunity to present and defend your charter. You can set up an additional appointment with the Chair of rules committee to go over your presentation and answer any last questions about chartering, the hearing, and the process.\n\n7. The week after your hearing, the senate will vote on your student organization. Once approved, the Office of Student Engagement will be in touch about the Smith Social Network and Organization Leader Training.\n\nDownload an Sample Charter\n\nAcademic Honor Board Class Representatives\n\nContact: Alexandra Keller, Dean of the College\n\nOne representative from the Sophomore, Junior, Senior, and Ada Comstock class is chosen by the Academic Honor Board each spring to fill open vacancies on the board.
