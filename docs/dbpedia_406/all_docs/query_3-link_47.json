        "text": "This guide is designed to answer one question for you: How are you going to afford Smith College?\n\nYou probably know that planning for expenses is an important part of the college application process. What you may not know is how many different things you need to keep track of to pay tuition and apply for financial aid.\n\nHere's what we'll cover:\n\nHow much does Smith College tuition cost?\n\nHow much financial aid do students at Smith College usually get?\n\nHow much debt is typical for students at Smith College?\n\nHow much will Smith College cost YOU, and can you actually afford it?\n\nIs Smith College a good value for you?\n\nWhat are other schools that might be a better value than Smith College?\n\nBy learning more about expenses and aid, you’re already on the right path to managing college costs. Let’s get started!\n\nSchool location: Northampton, MA\n\nHow Much Does Smith College Cost?\n\nKnowing what a school costs is Step #1 in managing college costs. There’s more to think about than just the tuition—you also have to factor in where you'll live, what you'll eat, and more while attending Smith College.\n\nThe \"Cost of Attendance\" is the total amount of money the average student has to pay, WITHOUT any financial aid, to attend a particular school. Think of it as a school’s sticker price. It includes not just Smith College tuition and fees, but also room, board, textbooks, and personal expenses.\n\nHere’s the Cost of Attendance breakdown for Smith College:\n\nHow Much Financial Aid Do Students at Smith College Get?\n\nThe Cost of Attendance listed above might be intimidating. The good news is that most students don’t end up paying that full price to attend Smith College. Financial aid helps make up the difference between the Cost of Attendance and what families can actually afford.\n\nHere we'll cover how many students get Smith College financial aid, what types of aid they get, and how much.\n\nA Brief Intro to Financial Aid\n\nAid comes in many forms, including:\n\nNeed-based grants\n\nMerit-based scholarships\n\nStudent loans\n\nThis financial aid comes from a few different places:\n\nFederal aid comes from the federal government, or is subsidized by the federal government.\n\nInstitutional aid comes from your school itself.\n\nGenerally, it’s better for MORE students to receive HIGH amounts of financial aid—this means students pay less for college.\n\nLet’s take a look at how Smith College compares to other schools.\n\nOverall Aid\n\nLet's start with the overall numbers. At Smith College, we know that:\n\n73% of Students Get ANY Aid\n\nThis is 19% LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 92%.\n\nThis could be bad news - fewer students getting aid could mean students are paying more at Smith College than they would at other similar schools. It could also mean students attending Smith College are wealthier and need less aid.\n\nTo break this apart, we'll next look at each type of aid and how much students get from each.\n\nGrants and Scholarships\n\nWe’re focusing on grants and scholarships first because they’re the most important forms of financial aid. Grants and scholarships are better than loans because students don’t ever have to pay them back. The more grant/scholarship aid students receive at a particular school, the better off those students are in the long run.\n\nAt Smith College, we know that:\n\n65% Get ANY Grant Money\n\nThis is 24% LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 89%.\n\nAlthough it’s useful to know how many students get grant aid, it’s also important to know how much grant aid people tend to receive. The bigger the average grant award, the better.\n\nSo how much grant money do students at Smith College tend to receive?\n\nAverage Grant Award: $35006\n\nThis is $18518 HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $16488.\n\nAltogether, this is mixed news - at Smith College, FEWER students get aid, but the ones who do get MORE than average. If you qualify for aid, this can work out well, since you'll get a sizable award. But it might be harder for you to qualify for Smith College financial aid.\n\nHow Generous is Smith College’s Financial Aid?\n\nThe grant dollar amounts we’ve seen so far have included aid from all sources - both federal and institutional. Schools don’t have much control over how much federal aid students can qualify for (like Pell Grants), but they do their own financial aid dollars and how they’re used.\n\nTo figure out how strong Smith College’s own financial aid program is, we’ll look at how they award their own (non-federal) financial aid dollars. The more students receive aid directly from the school (otherwise known as institutional aid), and the bigger the award amounts, the better the financial aid program.\n\nLet’s see how generous Smith College is with its students:\n\n65% Get ANY School Grants\n\nThis is 17% LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 82%.\n\nBecause Smith College gives a smaller percentage of its students institutional grants than similar schools, it may offer less competitive financial aid.\n\nSome schools may claim to offer large amounts of aid to prospective students without advertising that much of this money may come in the form of student loans - money that you have to pay back. To figure out if this is the case, check out our following section on student loan debt at Smith College.\n\nThe amount of money that students actually get is just as important (if not more important) than the percent of students who get grants. If you receive a grant, you’ll want it to be big enough to do you some good.\n\nAverage School Grant: $33241\n\nThis is $19442 HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $13799.\n\nRight away, it seems like Smith College offers more institutional aid than other schools. On the surface, this can mean that students who do receive institutional grants get a competitive amount, compared to other schools.\n\nOn the other hand, this can also mean that the school just costs more than the typical school of its type. If Smith College costs more, it makes sense for the average grant award to be higher.\n\nUp to this point, we've looked entirely at grants for Smith College. Next, we'll do the same analysis for student loans, which is where student debt comes from.\n\nHow Much Debt is Typical for Students at Smith College?\n\nAside from grants, the other major way to pay for college is with student loans. Student loans aren’t free sums of money - you borrow a certain amount to attend Smith College, and then pay it back with smaller monthly payments after you graduate.\n\nThe more student loan money you borrow, the more debt you’ll end up with after graduation. Ideally, you want to minimize your student debt as much as possible. Less debt means less of a financial burden once you leave school.\n\nIt’s generally a bad sign if a school has many students taking out a lot of loans. This indicates that graduates have to worry about paying back big sums of money once they leave school.\n\nTo address the amount and type of debt that students take on, this section will cover:\n\nLoan Overview\n\nFederal Loans\n\nOther Loans\n\nLet’s see what students at Smith College have to deal with:\n\nLoan Overview\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how many students at Smith College actually have to take out any student loans at all. The ideal goal is to graduate with little to no debt.\n\nIt’s very common for college grads in the US to graduate with some debt, but high percentages of students taking on loans at a particular school is a big red flag. In contrast, low percentages of students with loans is a sign that Smith College tuition is affordable.\n\nSo how many students actually end up taking out loans at Smith College?\n\n57% Have ANY Loans\n\nThis is 9% lower than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 66%.\n\nIt’s a good sign that lower numbers of students take out loans at Smith College. It doesn’t necessarily mean that students end up with lower amounts of debt - we’ll get to that question very shortly - but it suggests that Smith College is more affordable for the average student.\n\nNext, we'll look at exactly HOW much debt the average person takes out while in school.\n\nFederal Loans\n\nNow that you have a handle on the basic loan information for Smith College, we’ll get into some more nitty-gritty information on the types and amounts of loans that students typically have.\n\nWe’ll start with federal loans because, in general, federal loans are preferable to private loans. Federal loans tend to have low interest rates, which means they cost less in the long run. They may come with other perks (like subsidization or even options for loan forgiveness).\n\nHigh percentages or amounts of federal loans still isn’t a great sign - again, you don’t want to see students burdened with too much debt. Generally, schools with strong financial aid programs will have students with more federal loans than private loans.\n\nLet’s see how Smith College stacks up:\n\n52% Have Federal Loans\n\nAt Smith College, 52% of all students take out federal loans. This is 13% LOWER than the average percent of students for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 65%.\n\nAverage Federal Loan: $4127\n\nAt Smith College, the average annual federal loan amount is $4127. This amount is $1950 LESS than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $6077.\n\nOther Private Loans\n\nOther loans, or private loans, are the last resource students turn to when paying for college. They’re the least preferable form of financial aid because they have higher interest rates and cost students the most money in the long run.\n\nGenerally, the fewer students who take private loans, and the lower the amount of the loan, the more affordable Smith College is.\n\nLet’s take a look at the percentage of students at Smith College with non-federal loans:\n\n7% Have Private Loans\n\nAt Smith College, 7% of students take out private loans. This is 2% LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 9%\n\nJust as important as the percentage of students with private loans is the average loan amount. The smaller the average loan amount, the better:\n\nAverage Private Loan: $7158\n\nThe average private loan amount at Smith College is $7158. This is $4286 LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $11444.\n\nThe percentage of students getting federal loans is greater than those getting private loans, which is a good sign. This means lower-interest federal loans are usually enough to pay for Smith College.\n\nWhat Would It Cost YOU to Attend Smith College?\n\nFinally, we get to the bottom line: what will Smith College actually cost YOU? Every family has a different situation, and depending on your income level, you'll have to pay more or less to go to college.\n\nWhat is Net Price, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nAbove, we've covered Smith College's Cost of Attendance (tuition, room and board, books, and more). We also covered its typical financial aid in grants, loans, and scholarships.\n\nThe Net Price is the total cost minus the total aid given. In other words, this is the price you have to pay to the school out of pocket. The lower the school's cost, and the more aid you get, the lower the Net Price.\n\nWe'll cover two ways to get your Net Price for Smith College - the fast way, and the precise way.\n\nNet Price: The Quick and Easy Way\n\nIf you want a quick, general idea of your annual Net Price at Smith College, here's a handy chart showing the net price of real students. All you need is your family income.\n\nIf your family makes between... Your Net Price will likely be around... $0 - $30,000 $8438 $30,001 - $48,000 $11641 $48,001 - $75,000 $17617 $75,001 - $110,000 $25241 $110,000 and up $38256\n\nNote that these values may be a few years old, and today's prices may be a bit higher.\n\nAs we'll discuss next, your exact Net Price will depend on other factors like the number of family members and total assets, but this represents the typical Net Price.\n\nNet Price: The Most Accurate Method\n\nMost schools have an updated Net Price calculator available. To find it, just google \"Smith College Net Price Calculator\" - the official tool should be one of the top search results.\n\nOften the school will ask for more information than just income:\n\nThe number of people in your household\n\nThe number of family members in college\n\nParental wages, income, and assets\n\nStudent wages, income, and assets\n\nThis will take 10-15 minutes to complete, and you'll get a specific net price that's more accurate than the table above.\n\nCan You Afford to Attend Smith College?\n\nOnce you have a Net Price estimate, you’ll want to figure out whether your family can afford to pay Smith College tuition and costs. Once again, the Net Price is the total cost of attending, minus the aid you can expect to get (grants and scholarships). It's the amount you'd have to cover yourself.\n\nThe US government has come up with a standardized way to calculate how much a typical family can afford to pay without help. They call this the Expected Family Contribution, or EFC.\n\nAs an example, a family that brings home $80,000 in income before taxes, with no assets and no other children in college, has an EFC of around $7,000. This is the amount the government thinks that family can reasonably pay, and the school will have to step in and cover the rest.\n\nColleges use this number as a guideline to decide how much aid to give you, but it's just a guideline. Some schools will be stingier with aid, and you'll have to pay more than the government's suggested EFC.\n\nSo we're going to calculate your EFC and compare it to Smith College's Net Price. If the Net Price is higher than the EFC, the school will cost more than you can typically afford. It's a simple equation:\n\nNet Price - Expected Family Contribution = Deficit (extra cost you would need to cover)\n\nWe've constructed a simple tool to figure out whether Smith College is affordable for you:\n\nAffordability Calculator\n\nFinally: Is This Price Really Worth It?\n\nChances are, college won't be cheap. Even if you have a few top choice schools in mind like Smith College, it's still useful to explore broadly.\n\nA few questions to ponder:\n\nHow much better off will you be if you attend Smith College as opposed to a similar, but cheaper, school?\n\nHave you considered a range of private and public schools? Big and small?\n\nWhat if you didn't attend college at all? (This is extreme, but just worth considering even for a second.\n\nThese are the big picture questions to consider when we talk about the value of a college education.\n\nHere's our take: college will be a really important stage in your development. Going to a better, more reputable college will usually pay off in the long run. By going to a better college, you'll be surrounded by a more interesting community, find it easier to land a job, and open up opportunities.\n\nTo determine the value of Smith College, we're going to rely on reputable ranking lists. These consider factors like reputation, student selectivity, income after graduating, and more to determine the value of a school.\n\nValue Judgment\n\nSo how does Smith College stack up?\n\nWhat Other Schools Should You Consider?\n\nYour next step should be to get a better idea of costs and aid availability at similar schools. If you’re interested in Smith College, you should check out some other high-value schools that could give you more bang for your buck. Get started here to check both in-state and out-of-state schools that might provide a better value.\n\nBetter Value Schools\n\nFinally, we're going to look at schools that might offer a better value than Smith College. To compile this list, we first find schools at similar academic levels, so you have a similar chance at getting in. Then we select schools that better value for you, by being more affordable or having a higher quality of education"
