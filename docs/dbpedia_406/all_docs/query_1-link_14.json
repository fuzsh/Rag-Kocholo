        "text": "In 1890, the first Smith club—the Smith College Club of New York City—was founded with the goal of providing alumnae an opportunity to socialize and raise awareness about Smith. Today, there are more than 100 active Smith clubs around the world, each powered by the energy and commitment of volunteers. Some clubs are large, well-established and have a robust volunteer structure, while others are smaller with fewer financial and personnel resources. Whatever the size, clubs offer rich and interesting programs in your area. Join your local Smith club and be part of the fabric that weaves together the past, present and future of your alma mater.\n\nClub Club Club\n\nAlabama\n\nSmith College Club of Birmingham\n\nEmail Alumnae Relations for information\n\nArizona\n\nSmith College Club of Phoenix\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of Tucson\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nCalifornia\n\nSmith College Club of Sacramento\n\n(Capital Region)\n\nEmail Alumnae Relations for information\n\nSmith College Club of East Bay\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook | Young Alumnae Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of Los Angeles (includes Pasadena)\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook| Twitter | Instagram\n\nSmith College Club of the North Coast (Sonoma, Napa)\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of Orange County\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of the Peninsula (Palo Alto area)\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of San Diego\n\nWebsite | Email |Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of San Francisco and Marin\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of Santa Barbara\n\nEmail | Facebook\n\nColorado\n\nSmith College Club of Colorado and South Wyoming\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nConnecticut\n\nWestern Connecticut Book Group\n\nBook Club Email\n\nSmith College Club of Fairfield County\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of Greenwich-Stamford\n\nWebsite | Email\n\nSmith College Club of Hartford\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of Southeastern Connecticut (Mystic area)\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook\n\nSmith College Club of New Haven\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook | Young Alumnae Facebook\n\nDelaware\n\nSmith College Club of Delaware\n\nEmail Alumnae Relations for information\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nSmith College Club of Washington, DC\n\nWebsite | Email | Facebook | Young Alumnae Facebook\n\nFlorida\n\nSmith College Club of Central Florida (Winter Park/Orlando area)\n\nWebsite | Email Alumnae Relations for information\n\nSmith College Club of Fort Lauderdale\n\nWebsite | Email\n\nSmith College Club of Gainesville\n\nEmail Alumnae Relations for information\n\nSmith College Club of Jacksonville\n\nEmail Alumnae Relations for information\n\nSmith College Club of Miami\n\nWebsite | Email\n\nSmith College Club of the Palm Beaches\n\nWebsite | Email\n\nSmith College Club of Sarasota\n\nWebsite | Email\n\nSmith College Club of Southwest Florida (Naples, Sanibel, Ft.

The Affinity and Special Interest Program offers opportunities for alumnae with shared interests to establish online and in-person communities.\n\nFor questions or information on affinity group guidelines or creating an affinity group, please contact the OAR at alumclub@smith.edu or call 800-526-2023, extension 4.\n\nWebsites are created by and for the affinity groups of Smith College. Information on these websites is intended for communication among Smith alumnae. Use of this information for any other purpose is strictly prohibited. Smith College and the Alumnae Association of Smith College are not responsible for the content of affinity group websites.\n\nYou may submit proposals to the OAR for short-term projects or programs that may be of interest to a designated group.\n\nGuidelines\n\nAdvances the interests of Smith College, the AASC and alumnae and does not conflict with their mission\n\nOpen to all Smith alumnae\n\nEncourages involvement with local Smith clubs\n\nAffirms support of the AASC by developing volunteer leaders\n\nClubs Events & Programs\n\nPlanning An Event\n\nClubs and groups engage in events that enhance the alum connection with the college and each other. Programs may vary in an effort to provide meaningful experiences for folks with different interests. Examples include:\n\norganizing a book club\n\nsending care packages to students\n\nengaging in community service\n\ncreating theme-based sub-groups for investing, cooking, knitting and crafts, walking/hiking\n\nsocial events such as bowling, after work meet-ups, game night (including Smithopoly!) and museum and sports outings\n\norganizing a panel of alums with similar fields of interest or expertise, such as folks in science, law, education, the arts, or health and wellness\n\ncelebrating Smith traditions such as Mountain Day, Julia Child Day, Christmas Vespers, Cromwell Day and Rally Day\n\nBook clubs are a wonderful way to reinvigorate your club’s membership and keep alums regularly engaged. Smith book clubs have sprung up globally. See Communications for ideas on boosting attendance and celebrating diversity.\n\nSmith College values its alums and provides many tools to help them connect to one another and to the college, whether in person or virtually, as individuals, or as volunteer-led affinity groups and clubs. The college does not govern alum groups nor prescribe content for groups’ events. The selection of a book or other program content by an alum group or club does not imply an endorsement by Smith College or the Alumnae Association of Smith College.\n\nStarting a Book Club\n\nSmith club presidents often find that book clubs attract alums who don’t traditionally affiliate with their Smith clubs but are interested in continuing their education and connection to the college. Book clubs require a few basic ingredients.\n\nA Good Book\n\nIt’s best to let the point person choose the group’s first book and have participants come to the first meeting with their suggestions. Paperbacks are a good first choice for affordability and portability. Independent booksellers sometimes offer book club discounts.\n\nA Little Time\n\nIt is standard practice to have a month to read a selection. Meetings should go for about an hour and a half, with the first hour devoted to discussion and the last half-hour for socializing.\n\nStay connected to current students from your area by sending end-of-semester care packages to them. Students often send warm expressions of appreciation for receiving a box of homemade baked goods, gift certificates for local businesses, cards and other goodies, like warm socks for the winter. Here are some helpful guidelines to follow if your club wants to send care packages.\n\nTiming\n\nCare packages/gifts should arrive at least seven days before the last day of classes to ensure ample time for delivery and pick-up by students. See the Academic Calendar. Please check with your post office to allow enough time for delivery and be sure to use packaging that prevents damage during shipping.\n\nSuggestions\n\nAtkins Farms care packages\n\nCampus Center Café\n\nNorthampton Chamber of Commerce gift card\n\nHerrell’s Ice Cream\n\nLaurel Mountain Gift Baskets\n\nHelp make a difference in your community by volunteering. Community service projects can be fun and rewarding ways to connect with alumnae who might enjoy giving back more than attending other club events. They also enhance Smith’s reputation in local communities. Alumnae can be asked to suggest an organization that might be willing to organize a club’s volunteer time.\n\nChoosing a Project\n\nShort-term or one-time projects are more likely than long-term commitments to attract volunteers.\n\nA program whose mission is to support women and girls or college access might be especially attractive.\n\nProjects that include partners and kids might appeal to alumnae with families (inquire about a minimum age for children).\n\nCommunity service groups or book groups might complement a project with a book that focuses on service, such as Mountains Beyond Mountains, by Tracy Kidder, or The American Way to Change: How National Service & Volunteers are Transforming America, by Shirley Sagawa ’83.\n\nIdeas\n\nFood Banks\n\nSome clubs volunteer one or more times a year at food banks, where they sort or pack canned or fresh food for soup kitchens, shelters, families, schools or day-care centers. A day’s work can begin with a brunch or end with drinks to provide social time. Food donations can be requested at other club events.\n\nDress for Success\n\nDress for Success has affiliates around the country to which club members can donate clothing for use by disadvantaged female job-seekers.\n\nScholarship Fundraisers\n\nFundraising for Smith College was historically one of the primary purposes of Smith clubs and has been an important and appreciated source of financial support for the college. Alums have always been passionate about supporting Smith scholarships, and alum groups and clubs have been doing innovative, effective fundraisers for the cause. There are a variety of ways in which you can help young women enjoy the benefits of a Smith education.\n\nTo add your club fundraiser idea to this page, please email alumclub@smith.edu.\n\nS’mints\n\nThe Smith College Club of the North Shore offers S’mints—handmade dark chocolates imprinted with an image of the Grécourt Gates. Available in original peppermint crunch and orange crunch.\n\nDesk Calendars\n\nFor decades, the Smith College Club of Milwaukee has sold desk calendars across the state.\n\nEnstrom’s Toffee\n\nThe Smith College Club of Colorado offers Enstrom’s gourmet toffee each holiday season. The almond-chocolate toffee is a wonderful treat!\n\nSmith Aprons\n\nThe Smith College Club of Southeastern Connecticut created a wonderful red apron with “Smith Cooks” written on the front.\n\nTote Bags\n\nThe Smith College Club of Fairfield County created a nautical-inspired canvas tote bag with “Smith College” printed on it.\n\nPecans for scholarships started in 1951 with the Smith College Club of Westchester County and has since become an annual fundraising tradition for numerous clubs across the country. Typically sold during the late fall, the pecans now come in a variety of flavors, including chocolate-covered and cinnamon-glazed. The following clubs sell pecans, and many will ship.\n\nNew England\n\nSmith College Club of Belmont | Smith College Club of Cape Cod | Smith College Club of Franklin County | Smith College Club West of Boston | Smith College Club of Greenwich-Stamford | Smith College Club of Southeastern Connecticut | Smith College Club of Southeastern Massachusetts | Smith College Club of Maine\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPrinceton Area Smith College Club | Watchung Hills Smith Club\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh Smith College Club\n\nWashington\n\nSmith College Club of Washington, D.C.\n\nNew York\n\nSmith College Club of New York City | Smith College Club of Schenectady | Westchester Smith College Club\n\nFlorida\n\nSmith College Club of the Treasure Coast\n\nIndiana\n\nSmith College Club of Indianapolis\n\nOhio\n\nSmith College Club of Cincinnati | Smith College Club of Akron | Smith College Club of Columbus\n\nClub Officer Roles\n\nSmith clubs are self-funded organizations chartered through a set of bylaws and governed by an elected set of officers.
