        "text": "No college or university has more motivated and talented students ready to tackle today’s most pressing issues. We need their vision and leadership more than ever to build on the successes that generations of Smithies have already achieved—from shattering glass ceilings to making scientific breakthroughs to leading movements. The Smith Fund is the central force that sustains Smith, ensuring that exceptional students can turn their disruptive ideas into meaningful action, embrace change and transform our world. Your gift drives Smith—and Smithies—forward. When you power The Smith Fund, Smithies power the world. Give today.\n\nTo make a credit card gift or to make a pledge, please use our online giving form or call 800-241-2056, option #1 during business hours, Monday–Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nTo make a gift of securities, please use our Stock Transfer Form or call 800-526-2023, option #2, or 413-585-2036 during business hours, Monday–Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nTo make a gift by check, please send to:\n\nThe Smith Fund\n\nSmith College Gift Accounting\n\n33 Elm Street\n\nNorthampton, MA 01063\n\nSmith College Tax ID: 04-1843040\n\nWe’ve got answers to your questions.\n\nWhat is The Smith Fund?\n\nThe Smith Fund is the way that most alums, parents and friends support the college. It is an annual fund, which means we ask for donations every year. In fiscal year 2022–23, The Smith Fund raised $11.3 million from more than more than 8,500 donors.\n\nDoes this money go to Smith’s endowment?\n\nSmith Fund donations never go to the endowment—the funds are spent in the year in which they are received. This means these funds are immediately put to use to support students today. What’s more, you can choose where to direct your gift: financial aid, diversity and inclusion, sustainability, and more.\n\nDoes my gift really matter?\n\nDonations from alums impact our participation rate, a measurement that affects important outcomes such as college rankings, so your annual gift is vital to the success of the college. And every gift—large or small—truly makes a difference. Each year, the college raises nearly $500,000 from gifts of $100 or less. Your donation helps to educate the changemakers of tomorrow.\n\nCalling all seniors! Are you ready to take part in a giving tradition that’s been happening for decades? Every year, Smith seniors raise money toward a class gift that is presented to the college on Ivy Day. Make your first official gift to the college, even if it’s just $5. If every senior makes a donation of $5, the class will raise over $3,000 for students this year. You can even choose what your gift will support: financial aid, study abroad, sustainability and more."
