        "text": "The Office of the Provost and Dean of the Faculty is the chief academic office of Smith College, ensuring a broad array of outstanding teaching, learning and research experiences for students and faculty. Our team directs and integrates the college’s varied academic efforts to create a thriving community and supports faculty across the arc of their professional lives—through curricular innovation, compensation, professional development and external grants. We’re committed to aligning academic resources with the college’s curricular mission and making Smith a great place to learn and work.\n\nClicking Beyond Mortality\n\nAssistant Professor of Sociology Timothy Recuber’s new book, The Digital Departed: How We Face Death, Commemorate Life, and Chase Virtual Immortality, discusses what happens to our online identities when we die.\n\n“There’s about a decade’s worth of research on the ways that people use the social networking profiles of their dead friends and loved ones to keep a sort of one-sided conversation going,” Recuber says. “What the book really tracks are the more recent ways that people have sought to engage with their own death and dying online, rather than the deaths of others.”\n\nExplore Faculty Research Share Your Projects\n\nAbout Us\n\nName/Title/Contact\n\nBio\n\nCelebrating Faculty\n\nThe annual Kathleeen Compton Sherrerd ’54 and John F.
