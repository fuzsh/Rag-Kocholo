        "text": "Club, CORP & Group Volunteers\n\nSmith clubs, affinity groups and special interest groups around the world host a variety of events—receptions, book clubs, community service projects, museum visits—that provide opportunities to connect with the college, alums, faculty and students. In addition, the Committee on Regional Participation (CORP) is a dedicated committee of volunteers who engage with alums and solicit support of the college on a regional basis. Whether you’re looking for a long-term commitment, to help plan a get-together in your area or to share your story with local students, here’s how to get involved. We are deeply grateful for your commitment of time, effort and energy.\n\nPlanning Events & Programs\n\nPlanning An Event\n\nClubs and groups engage in events that enhance the alum connection with the college and each other. Programs may vary in an effort to provide meaningful experiences for folks with different interests. Examples include:\n\norganizing a book club\n\nsending care packages to students\n\nengaging in community service\n\ncreating theme-based sub-groups for investing, cooking, knitting and crafts, walking/hiking\n\nsocial events such as bowling, after work meet-ups, game night (including Smithopoly!) and museum and sports outings\n\norganizing a panel of alums with similar fields of interest or expertise, such as folks in science, law, education, the arts, or health and wellness\n\ncelebrating Smith traditions such as Mountain Day, Julia Child Day, Christmas Vespers, Cromwell Day and Rally Day\n\nPublicizing Your Event\n\nDoes your club or group have an event you want to publicize? Contact the Office of Alumnae Relations and Development at alumclub@smith.edu for support.\n\nFor tips to increase event attendance and membership, see Communications.\n\nInsurance coverage for all club events is provided under the college’s liability policy. See Volunteer Resources for more information.\n\nFor more ideas, see Additional Resources for Clubs & Groups. We encourage you to connect with fellow club leaders for advice and brainstorming on ideas and best practices. The Office of Alumnae Relations and Development staff can offer you support in planning a program.\n\nBook clubs are a wonderful way to reinvigorate your club’s membership and keep alums regularly engaged. Smith book clubs have sprung up globally. See Communications for ideas on boosting attendance and celebrating diversity.\n\nSmith College values its alums and provides many tools to help them connect to one another and to the college, whether in person or virtually, as individuals, or as volunteer-led affinity groups and clubs. The college does not govern alum groups nor prescribe content for groups’ events. The selection of a book or other program content by an alum group or club does not imply an endorsement by Smith College or the Alumnae Association of Smith College.\n\nStarting a Book Club\n\nSmith club presidents often find that book clubs attract alums who don’t traditionally affiliate with their Smith clubs but are interested in continuing their education and connection to the college. Book clubs require a few basic ingredients.\n\nA Good Book\n\nIt’s best to let the point person choose the group’s first book and have participants come to the first meeting with their suggestions. Paperbacks are a good first choice for affordability and portability. Independent booksellers sometimes offer book club discounts.\n\nA Little Time\n\nIt is standard practice to have a month to read a selection. Meetings should go for about an hour and a half, with the first hour devoted to discussion and the last half-hour for socializing.\n\nA Regular Schedule and a Bit of Publicity\n\nAfter the book list has been created, mail it to participants and include it in the club’s newsletter and web page announcements. Rotate locations and discussion leaders.\n\nPrompting Questions\n\nIt’s good to have a few prepared questions to prompt discussion. Book publishers often offer discussion guides.\n\nThree Willing Volunteers\n\nThe Point Person: This volunteer will field calls from interested members and maintain the book club membership list, book list and location schedule.\n\nBook Discussion Leader: This volunteer position will rotate through the book club. This person will prepare questions and a short biography of the author.\n\nHostess: This position rotates and should not be either the point person or the discussion leader.\n\nThe Perfect Spot\n\nConsider holding your event at a local library at the same time as their “Young Reader’s Circle” or other “Read Aloud” programs. This will allow mothers of small children to attend without arranging for child care. As a bonus, this will also reinforce the love of reading in the next generation.\n\nReading Suggestions\n\nFor ideas, browse current and past selections for entering students, read a faculty book and check out alumnae books featured in WordSmith and the Smith Alumnae Quarterly. The Gate also regularly feature the latest books from faculty and alumnae. Submit your group’s reading list suggestions to alumclub@smith.edu.\n\nStay connected to current students from your area by sending end-of-semester care packages to them. Students often send warm expressions of appreciation for receiving a box of homemade baked goods, gift certificates for local businesses, cards and other goodies, like warm socks for the winter. Here are some helpful guidelines to follow if your club wants to send care packages.\n\nTiming\n\nCare packages/gifts should arrive at least seven days before the last day of classes to ensure ample time for delivery and pick-up by students. See the Academic Calendar. Please check with your post office to allow enough time for delivery and be sure to use packaging that prevents damage during shipping.\n\nSuggestions\n\nAtkins Farms care packages\n\nCampus Center Café\n\nNorthampton Chamber of Commerce gift card\n\nHerrell’s Ice Cream\n\nLaurel Mountain Gift Baskets\n\nShipping\n\nLabel perishable items and consider necessary shipment time.\n\nPut the student name and box number on each package.\n\nInclude the sender’s name, club name and email/mailing address. (Many students send thank-you notes.)\n\nEmail Mail Services to notify them of your shipment. In the subject line put “Smith Club Mailing.” Please do not send notifications to students. Mail Services will send notifications to students via email. All gift bags must be sealed, and it’s best to send them in uniform packaging. Please include:\n\nName of club\n\nNumber of pieces being sent\n\nList of recipients and box numbers\n\nMail to: Smith College, Mail Services, 100 Elm Street, Northampton, MA 01063\n\nIf you are overseas, consider sending gift cards or certificates to local shops or ordering care packages from a local Northampton business to avoid items becoming spoiled or packages getting delayed. It will also save on shipping costs.\n\nHelp make a difference in your community by volunteering. Community service projects can be fun and rewarding ways to connect with alumnae who might enjoy giving back more than attending other club events. They also enhance Smith’s reputation in local communities. Alumnae can be asked to suggest an organization that might be willing to organize a club’s volunteer time.\n\nChoosing a Project\n\nShort-term or one-time projects are more likely than long-term commitments to attract volunteers.\n\nA program whose mission is to support women and girls or college access might be especially attractive.\n\nProjects that include partners and kids might appeal to alumnae with families (inquire about a minimum age for children).\n\nCommunity service groups or book groups might complement a project with a book that focuses on service, such as Mountains Beyond Mountains, by Tracy Kidder, or The American Way to Change: How National Service & Volunteers are Transforming America, by Shirley Sagawa ’83.\n\nIdeas\n\nFood Banks\n\nSome clubs volunteer one or more times a year at food banks, where they sort or pack canned or fresh food for soup kitchens, shelters, families, schools or day-care centers. A day’s work can begin with a brunch or end with drinks to provide social time. Food donations can be requested at other club events.\n\nDress for Success\n\nDress for Success has affiliates around the country to which club members can donate clothing for use by disadvantaged female job-seekers.\n\nHabitat for Humanity\n\nProjects may include home building, trail clearing, knitting for homeless women or delivering cards made by school children to hospital patients.\n\nTitle I Schools\n\nSince 1989, the Washington, D.C., club has had relationships with a Title I elementary school (majority low-income students) where 20 or more volunteers tutor individuals or read aloud to a class, helping to grow grade-level readers by the end of third grade. Alumnae are invited to bring school supplies to the club’s annual tea.\n\nOn the Rise\n\nThe Cambridge, MA, club has an ongoing relationship with On the Rise, a program for homeless women. They have collected socks and other necessities for clients; they invite donations at any club event. They also gathered 450 books in one month to create a library for this women’s shelter.\n\nGirls Schools\n\nLook for opportunities to collaborate with or co-sponsor an event with a girls’ school, with a group that benefits women or girls, or with an organization related to the subject area of a faculty speaker. These events also offer the opportunity to share admission materials with high school girls.\n\nSponsor Events & Lectures\n\nAn innovative example of an event comes from the Maine club, which co-sponsored a faculty lecture by Tom Litwin, the former director of the Clark Science Center at Smith, with Coastal Studies for Girls, a semester school for sophomores from around the country with an interest in marine science and leadership. His presentation, held at a public expeditionary learning high school in Portland where an alumna teaches science, was on climate change in the Bering Sea.\n\nFaculty Speakers\n\nThe Faculty Speaker program is a long-standing tradition utilized by many clubs to engage with Smithies locally. These presentations bring Smithies together and provide the opportunity for alums to participate in lifelong learning. The Office of Alumnae Relations and Development partners with regional Smith clubs to provide financial and marketing support so alums can engage with faculty.\n\nContact alumclub@smith.edu with any questions.\n\nRequest a Faculty Speaker\n\nClubs should expect to:\n\nGather the largest audience possible by committing to and utilizing at least three outreach methods in a coordinated and timely manner (email, website update, social media post, print mailing, word of mouth or personalized individual connection).\n\nWe suggest a target audience of 50 participants and invite you to contact our office if you need support gathering participants.\n\nShare your marketing plan and any published materials with the Office of Alumnae Relations and Development.\n\nIf clubs use their own marketing email system, Smith will also share out a promotional email to the region to ensure all alums receive the notification.\n\nProvide a list of participants, both registered and attended, with the Office of Alumnae Relations and Development.\n\nSurvey event attendees.\n\nThe Office of Alumnae Relations and Development will provide a survey tool for all clubs to utilize.\n\nComplete a post-event survey, recapping the event and overall experience.\n\nWelcome additional Smith staff that may attend this event.\n\nThese staff may be available to assist on the day of the event with any welcoming tasks.\n\nWith 130 clubs worldwide, not all clubs will receive a faculty speaker every year. Requests for speakers will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\nThe availability of faculty members and funding\n\nDate of the club’s last college-sponsored faculty speaker event\n\nThe club’s demonstrated ability and plans to gather the largest possible Smith-connected audience\n\nClub leadership’s participation in volunteer meetings and engagement with the college\n\nHow do these updates benefit my club and fellow volunteers?\n\nThe following updates are intended to provide a streamlined request process, removing some time-intensive responsibilities from the plates of volunteers. A faculty solicitation, managed by the Office of Alumnae Relations and Development, will provide more speaker possibilities for clubs, including a variety of speakers from new and cutting edge to the iconic. Our office will then match club requests to available faculty speakers, eliminating significant groundwork that ordinarily would be undertaken by volunteers.\n\nSince clubs are paired with available faculty, volunteers can submit a rough concept for a speaker event that can take shape once an appropriate match is made. Alternatively, if clubs have a very specific idea and a particular person in mind with their request, we will already know whether or not that person is available to travel. Utilizing the speaker request form will save clubs lost time if we know in advance that a faculty member is unavailable and can suggest an alternative possibility.\n\nThis updated process accompanied by the support of the Assistant Director of Regional Volunteer Engagement makes planning a faculty speaker event more accessible to a club that might not have thought it had the volunteer resources to do it. The resulting event will stimulate new interest in the club.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nUtilizing a Google Form, club volunteers will request a speaker for either the Fall/Winter (November through February) or Spring/Summer period (March through August). You may submit a request at any time. Requests made before the review window begins will receive priority. You should anticipate hearing from staff with an update on your request approximately 10 business days after the review window opens.\n\nWho pays for the faculty member’s travel expenses?\n\nThe Office of Alumnae Relations and Development will cover travel expenses for faculty speakers. Clubs are responsible for any costs associated with the event, these may include a rental fee, food and beverages, or print materials.\n\nWhere can I find the program guidelines and evaluation criteria?\n\nGuidelines and evaluation criteria can be found in the Club Volunteer Toolkit, as well as the Alumnae Relations website.\n\nWhere can I find out which faculty members are available?\n\nWhen you submit your request, we will let you know which faculty member is available to travel to your location. We do not provide a list of available faculty members. Faculty availability fluctuates, and publishing a list would create an opportunity for outdated information to be in circulation. For this reason, we encourage you to list a topic area you are interested in hearing about. Smith has 295 professors in more than 50 academic departments and programs. Rest assured we can help match you with an available professor with expertise in your preferred interest area.\n\nI already know who I want to ask—can I just email that professor/administrator directly?\n\nIn order to support faculty in managing their time, to ensure equitable access to faculty and to best manage our budget for travel, all requests need to be made through our office. It’s possible that your preferred faculty member is unavailable—but by making the request through our office we can help you think about other options.\n\nWhat happens if my request is deferred?\n\nIf your request is deferred your club will be notified via the email you listed on the request form. Your club is still eligible for a faculty speaker in the coming travel period, but it is not guaranteed a speaker during that period.\n\nIf my faculty speaker request is deferred, can I submit a different request?\n\nIf your request is deferred, you are welcome to submit a new request for a different topic or speaker. Clubs may not have more than one in-person faculty speaker per academic year.\n\nWe’d like to hold a faculty speaker event, but we are a smaller club and don’t think we can get 50 alums to attend. Can we still apply?\n\nYes! We recognize that alum population density in certain regions is different than in others and we’ll take that into consideration when reviewing your request. The target of 50 participants is intended to create a substantial audience, and is not a requirement. Participants can come from your local and neighboring Smith communities. Invitations for faculty speaker events can extend to current students, parents of current students and all alums in your local area. You may want to consider connecting with nearby Smith or Seven Sisters Clubs for a broader audience.\n\nCan we connect virtually with faculty members?\n\nYes! Our office will continue to sponsor virtual faculty speaker programs for all clubs. Regardless of whether or not your club has utilized an in-person faculty lecture, they will be able to participate in one of the virtual programs.\n\nWhat should we expect from the virtual faculty lectures?\n\nThe Office of Alumnae Relations and Development will continue to offer virtual faculty speaker programs throughout the academic year. These events are open to all clubs, and interested clubs must register to reserve a spot for their members at the event. The virtual events will have a faculty member lecture, as well as a live Q&A. Virtual lectures will end with breakout rooms for each club in attendance so you can have a private space to connect with your local Smithies.\n\nI have additional questions, who can I talk to about them?\n\nPlease reach out to Emily Fitzgerald, Assistant Director of Regional Volunteer Engagement, with any additional questions. Emily can be reached at ELFitzgerald@smith.edu or 413-585-2040.\n\nScholarship Fundraisers\n\nFundraising for Smith College was historically one of the primary purposes of Smith clubs and has been an important and appreciated source of financial support for the college. Alums have always been passionate about supporting Smith scholarships, and alum groups and clubs have been doing innovative, effective fundraisers for the cause. There are a variety of ways in which you can help young women enjoy the benefits of a Smith education.\n\nTo add your club fundraiser idea to this page, please email alumclub@smith.edu.\n\nS’mints\n\nThe Smith College Club of the North Shore offers S’mints—handmade dark chocolates imprinted with an image of the Grécourt Gates. Available in original peppermint crunch and orange crunch.\n\nDesk Calendars\n\nFor decades, the Smith College Club of Milwaukee has sold desk calendars across the state.\n\nEnstrom’s Toffee\n\nThe Smith College Club of Colorado offers Enstrom’s gourmet toffee each holiday season. The almond-chocolate toffee is a wonderful treat!\n\nSmith Aprons\n\nThe Smith College Club of Southeastern Connecticut created a wonderful red apron with “Smith Cooks” written on the front.\n\nTote Bags\n\nThe Smith College Club of Fairfield County created a nautical-inspired canvas tote bag with “Smith College” printed on it.\n\nPecans for scholarships started in 1951 with the Smith College Club of Westchester County and has since become an annual fundraising tradition for numerous clubs across the country. Typically sold during the late fall, the pecans now come in a variety of flavors, including chocolate-covered and cinnamon-glazed. The following clubs sell pecans, and many will ship.\n\nNew England\n\nSmith College Club of Belmont | Smith College Club of Cape Cod | Smith College Club of Franklin County | Smith College Club West of Boston | Smith College Club of Greenwich-Stamford | Smith College Club of Southeastern Connecticut | Smith College Club of Southeastern Massachusetts | Smith College Club of Maine\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPrinceton Area Smith College Club | Watchung Hills Smith Club\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh Smith College Club\n\nWashington\n\nSmith College Club of Washington, D.C.\n\nNew York\n\nSmith College Club of New York City | Smith College Club of Schenectady | Westchester Smith College Club\n\nFlorida\n\nSmith College Club of the Treasure Coast\n\nIndiana\n\nSmith College Club of Indianapolis\n\nOhio\n\nSmith College Club of Cincinnati | Smith College Club of Akron | Smith College Club of Columbus\n\nClub Officer Roles\n\nSmith clubs are geographically based alum communities that serve to connect Smithies to one another and to the college. There are more than 100 Smith clubs worldwide, varying in size and scope depending on their region. Each club is led by an executive board of officers. These roles can vary by club but often include a president, vice president, program chair, treasurer and secretary. We invite you to join this important part of the Smith community! Whether you are interested in an officer role or helping out with programs from time to time, there are many different ways to be involved.

If a club has the luxury of holding many events each year, it’s inevitable that some of those events will be more narrowly focused.\n\nIf possible, cover a variety of topics over each year. Suggestions include events based around art/cultural, theater/movies, food/wine, wellness/health, intellectual/literary, garden/outdoor, career/life-skills, financial planning, technology, entrepreneurship, college admissions planning, sports, local/city pride—walking tours, visiting landmarks and off-the-beaten path treasures.\n\nWhenever appropriate, include news of the college and an appeal to support it financially.\n\nIf possible, always include enough time for socializing. Smithies love to meet and network with other Smithies.\n\nYour group may want to choose a theme for each year’s series of events. Keep up with campus happenings that might translate into a theme.\n\nOffer events at different price points, always making them as inclusive as possible.\n\nIf your club covers a wide geographical area or a large city, plan events in different areas. You’ll be more likely to see different faces.\n\nSelect the best date: take into account holidays, religious observances and conflicting local events.\n\nCollaborate with other women’s colleges groups, Seven Sister alum groups and Ivy League groups.\n\nPlan events around an alum’s exhibit, concert, lecture, workshop, performance or reading.\n\nCreate a special event to benefit student scholarships if your club awards scholarship monies, or to build awareness and support of The Smith Fund.\n\nSmith in the Community: co-sponsor events with a local girls’ school, organization that supports women and girls, local college or university, or any community organization already planning to sponsor an event related to/focused on women and girls, education, or other issues of interest to alumnae.\n\nNetwork with other club leaders through the Facebook group “Smith College Club Leadership.” Join other clubs’ Facebook pages. Check the Office of Alumnae Relations Events Calendar to see what other clubs are doing.\n\nKeep up with two additional alumnae groups on Facebook:\n\nSmith College – Alumnae is the college’s alumnae group\n\nSmith College Alumnae is the group started by alumnae\n\nNow that you are the leader of an alum club or group, we want to help you implement a smooth leadership transition. We’ve put together a checklist that both the incoming and outgoing leaders should review.\n\nChecklist for Incoming Leaders\n\nSet up a meeting with the outgoing leader to go over questions and topics\n\nCollect club documents from the previous leader\n\nSchedule a meeting of new and old board/leadership committee members\n\nReview the available resources on the OAR Club Resources page\n\nSchedule a call with the assistant director for alumnae engagement\n\nSend a list of current club leaders so that the OAR has accurate records\n\nIntroduce yourself to alums via a newsletter, broadcast email and/or Facebook post\n\nHelpful Discussion Topics\n\nThe following questions and topics are a guide to help you think about your new role.

Awards are not only an excellent way to congratulate students on their academic and personal achievements, but they also increase Smith’s name recognition in high schools and encourage young women to consider Smith as their college of choice.\n\nSmith clubs sponsor the awards and select the high schools. Recipients are chosen by school personnel. The books are awarded to high school sophomores or juniors, usually at a school’s awards assembly in the spring. Recipients receive a book selected by the organization. Smith clubs need only raise money for the purchase of the books presented at the award ceremony.\n\nEach spring the Office of Admission sends a packet of information about book awards to Alumnae Admission Coordinators (AACs). The packet includes:\n\nguidelines for contacting schools\n\na sample letter to send to schools\n\na list of books written by Smith College alums and faculty\n\na book awards recipients sheet\n\nPlease consult the admission office when establishing new book awards to avoid duplicating an award already given by another group. If your club is interested in sponsoring a book award, please contact your NAAC, AAC or the Office of Admission. Affinity groups interested in this program should work with a local Smith club to coordinate efforts.\n\nFinancial Records\n\nOrganization treasurers maintain the treasury for the duration of their term. The Office of Alumnae Relations recommends maintaining records on a computer accounting/spreadsheet system. For treasurers who do not have access to a computer, financial records must be maintained in accordance with standard accounting practices. Organization funds are to be used solely to benefit the organization.\n\nTips for Maintaining a Club Treasury\n\nCaroline Carbaugh ’66, longtime treasurer of the Washington, D.C., club, shares the following tips:\n\nOpen or update a specified checking account; have several authorized signers, but one signature on a check is sufficient.\n\nDevelop a budget to control income and expenses and identify sources of income and categories for expenses.\n\nDocument all treasury transactions.\n\nRecord sources of income and amounts.\n\nAlways get copies of receipts and documentation.\n\nBalance checkbook monthly and produce a monthly or periodic report with starting and ending balances.\n\nNotes on Event Management\n\nTrack responses: name, address, number of reservations, amount of donations, amount paid, when received, when deposited.\n\nMake deposits and pay all bills.\n\nProvide information on tax-deductible amounts to attendees or donors.\n\nProduce a final report for events, including the number of reservations, income, expenses, profits or losses.\n\nSpecial Assistance for Club Treasurers\n\nFinance professional Katie Naughton ’70 has served as treasurer for both the Smith College Club of New York City and the Smith College Club of Hampshire County. She is available for consultation on financial and tax issues. (Please note that up to five hours of consultation are covered by the college; additional time must be paid by the club.)\n\nBank Accounts\n\nThe treasurer should open a bank account in the name of the organization (not a personal account) as the principal signature authority with a second officer, usually the president, also having authority. To open a bank account, the treasurer will need its organization bylaws and the following:\n\nTax number (Employer Identification number (EIN) or Tax Payer Identification Number (TIN)). Go to www.irs.gov and click on the link to apply for an EIN online.\n\nThe organization’s 501c(3) or 501c(7) tax-exempt number, if applicable.\n\nSetting & Collecting Dues\n\nThe treasurer solicits member dues on a regular schedule. It is the general practice to solicit dues in a newsletter, although an organization may also send a separate mailing to alums just for this purpose. The range of dues is $20 to $75 annually. The treasurer maintains records of dues received.\n\nThe AASC suggests the following basic guidelines:\n\nConsider the size of your organization, the financial health of your treasury, and regular and projected expenditures when setting dues.\n\nInclude a personal note with clear instructions and details about the use of dues. Provide an addressed return envelope.\n\nOffer discounts for members at events or for alums who pay dues prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.\n\nRecognize alums who have paid dues in your newsletter.\n\nProvide a complimentary copy of your club directory."
