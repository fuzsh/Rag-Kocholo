In paying homage to those who came before us, Blackappella recognizes our connections to one another. Blackappella came into existence in the fall of 2016 out of the pain and trauma of black students grappling with the current state of anti-blackness in the country. Through music, this club creates a space to talk about faith, healing, community, and activism. Blackappella’s mission is first to empower black students through song, and secondly to use our collective voices to engage the larger community in the fight for black life. #BLACKLIVESMATTER always.\n\n2023-2024 Contact: Zora Danticat, zdanticat@smith.edu\n\nCatholic Club\n\nThe Newman Catholic Club a group dedicated to giving Catholic Smithies the opportunity to worship with their fellow Catholics.
