        "text": "History of the Colleges\n\nFounded as two separate colleges, Hobart for men in 1822 and William Smith for women in 1908, Hobart and William Smith Colleges preserve their own identities while benefitting from a shared campus, faculty, administration and curriculum. Welcoming students of all gender identities, the Colleges provide a truly unique experience and a 21st century construct to address difference and understand commonalities.\n\nHobart College\n\nJohn Henry Hobart, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, visited Geneva in 1818 deeming it the perfect place to build what he called an \"outpost for civilized and learned behavior.\" He founded Geneva College, and its first building, Geneva Hall, was completed in 1822. Geneva College was renamed after its founder in 1852. Among the College's most notable alums is Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell. Blackwell was admitted to Geneva Medical College (the medical college that was affiliated with Hobart College) in 1847 by a student vote and graduated in 1849 as the first woman doctor in the nation.\n\nWilliam Smith College\n\nA philanthropist, nurseryman and women’s rights activist, in 1906 William Smith formalized his intention of founding a nondenominational, liberal arts institution dedicated to educating women broadly. Two years later, William Smith School for Women enrolled its first class of 18 under a coordinate arrangement with Hobart College. The coordinate system allowed Hobart students and William Smith students to share some facilities, faculty and administration although classes were not initially coeducational. Through the establishment of advanced departments in biology, psychology and sociology, William Smith’s gift also enriched the education of Hobart students.\n\nHobart and William Smith Colleges\n\nThe two colleges combined gradually. In 1922, the first joint commencement was held, though baccalaureate services remained separate until 1942. By then, coeducational classes had become the norm, and the curriculum centered on the idea of an across-the-board education, encouraging students and faculty to consider their studies from several points of view.\n\nIn 1943, during the administration of President John Milton Potter, William Smith College was elevated from its original status as a department of Hobart College to that of an independent college, on equal footing with Hobart.Today, HWS is a coeducational campus. Hobart and William Smith students maintain their own deans, athletic departments and student governments. Each college celebrates its history through a series of time-honored traditions beginning when each student matriculates and lasting through graduation. The Colleges celebrate their position as one of the few remaining coordinate systems in the nation, providing students a truly unique experience and a 21st century construct to interrogate gender and difference.\n\nHobart Resources\n\nStatesmen Athletics\n\nH Book\n\nHobart Dean’s Office\n\nHobart College Honor Societies\n\nHobart Student Government\n\nAlumni Association\n\nWilliam Smith Resources\n\nHeron Athletics\n\nWS Book\n\nWilliam Smith Dean’s Office\n\nWilliam Smith College Honor Societies\n\nWilliam Smith Congress\n\nAlumnae Association\n\nCoordinate Traditions\n\nMATRICULATION EXERCISES\n\nUpon arriving to campus for Orientation, students and their families are personally greeted by the president before moving to the Hobart and William Smith tent to sign their name in the matriculation book. On the eve of the first day of classes, new students are invited to attend matriculation ceremonies hosted by the Dean’s Offices.\n\nJohn Henry Hobart Day\n\nDating back to Hobart College’s inception, this ceremony is marked by a roll call of all new students in which each student is called to receive a certificate of matriculation and touch an Oar that marks them as Hobart students.\n\nWilliam Smith Dean’s Welcome\n\nOne of the oldest traditions of William Smith College, new students are welcomed by the deans and current student leaders and celebrate their matriculation with the greater William Smith community.\n\nACADEMIC EXCELLENCE\n\nThe Hobart and William Smith Dean’s Offices recognize the academic and social achievements of their students at celebratory events each spring semester.\n\nBenjamin Hale Dinner\n\nStudents and distinguished alumni come together to recognize the best of Hobart student achievements.\n\nCelebrating Excellence Dinner\n\nThe academic achievements of William Smith students are recognized and new members of the Laurel Honor Society for outstanding sophomores and juniors are inducted.\n\nMoving Up Day\n\nStudents gather by class at the top of William Smith Hill and process down The Hill with the seniors carrying a laurel rope. The event culminates with the passing of the laurel from the seniors to the juniors and all students “Moving Up.” Academic awards are given, new members of the Hai Timiai Honor Society are inducted and the Dean reflects on the year."
