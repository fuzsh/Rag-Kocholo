        "text": "Interlibrary Loan\n\nUse Interlibrary Loan to request...\n\nArticles not available online at Smith\n\nBooks and media not requestable in the online library catalog\n\nFor books and media in the online library catalog, see Five College Library Requests\n\nLogin to Interlibrary Loan\n\nYour interlibrary loan login is your Smith username and password.\n\nLogin to ILL Enter your Smith username and password.\n\nAbout Interlibrary Loan\n\nWhat is Interlibrary Loan?\n\nInterlibrary loan (ILL) provides access to materials owned by other libraries; it supplements the Five College Delivery system by obtaining items that cannot be ordered using \"Place Request\" in Discover Advanced.\n\nInterlibrary loan borrows both in and out of state and overseas when necessary. The loan period is set by the lending library and is usually 3-4 weeks; renewals are usually possible. Generally, however, think of these as short-term loans.\n\nBooks are usually easy to borrow. Scores, videos and sound recordings are more difficult, but we will try to get you what you need.\n\nInterlibrary loan also obtains journal articles and book chapters from materials not available online at Smith. These copies usually arrive as PDFs.\n\nWho Can Borrow\n\nAll currently-affiliated Smith College faculty, staff and students may use the Smith College interlibrary loan service.\n\nAffiliates of the other Five Colleges, alumnae and public borrowers are not eligible to this service. (Use the library of your home institution or your public library, as appropriate.)\n\nTurnaround Time\n\nMost requests are sent out to a potential supplier within 24-48 hours. If you submit a large number of requests on a single day, they may not all be sent out on the same day.\n\nArticles usually arrive within a few days.\n\nBooks, DVDs/videos, etc. can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks to arrive, depending on how far they must travel and what shipping method the supplier uses.\n\nService may be slower during the peak of the semester or during vacation periods.\n\nIf you have special needs, please consult with the interlibrary loan staff.\n\nCost\n\nMost interlibrary loans are provided to you free of charge, since the Libraries subsidize up to $25 per request. For items over $25, you may be asked to pay the balance. (You may cancel the request if you'd rather not pay.)\n\nAn annual per person subsidy is also in force.\n\nRequest Limits & Other Important Reminders\n\nYou may have up to 50 active requests at one time.\n\nThe lending library determines the loan period, options for renewal and any restrictions on use. You must adhere to any conditions placed by the lender.\n\nAll materials borrowed via interlibrary loan are subject to recall by the lender at any time.\n\nYou are responsible for any loss or damage fees.\n\nInformation for Other Libraries\n\nHow to Make a Request\n\nSmith College Libraries accepts interlibrary loan requests in the following ways:\n\nOCLC (preferred)—our symbol is SNN\n\nEmail: snnill@smith.edu\n\nFees\n\nThe following groups may borrow materials free of charge:\n\nOberlin Group libraries\n\nLibraries with a signed reciprocal agreement with Smith College\n\nMassachusetts public libraries\n\nOther institutions are charged $10 per request (both loans and copies). The following payment methods are accepted:\n\nIFM (preferred)\n\nCheck—we will include an invoice with the item\n\nIFLA coupons\n\nCirculation Policies\n\nMaterials are loaned for 4 weeks, and may be renewed once for another 4 weeks.\n\nThe following categories of materials generally do not circulate; exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nArt oversize\n\nArt theses\n\nNewspapers\n\nPeriodicals (bound and unbound)\n\nReference books\n\nSound recordings\n\nSpecial Collections materials\n\nVideocassettes/DVDs\n\nInformation for Outside Researchers\n\nGeneral Collections\n\nIf you are interested in obtaining loans or photocopies from the general collections of the Smith College Libraries, please consult the interlibrary loan service at your own academic, corporate or public library. They can send an interlibrary loan request to the Smith College Libraries on your behalf. With few exceptions (see below), Smith does not provide such service directly to individuals.\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nIf the material you seek is unique to Smith College and is housed in one of Smith's special collections, you may contact Special Collections directly."
