        "text": "Follow your curiosity, deepen your knowledge and expand your circle even further with the Five College Consortium, an alliance between Mount Holyoke, Amherst, Hampshire and Smith Colleges and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. It’s almost like having five schools in one — from a specialized piece of lab equipment to a leading scholar on a specific discipline, you’ll have everything you need to accomplish more than you ever thought possible. And along the way, chances are good that you’ll make more than a few friends.\n\nThe five colleges are connected by a free bus system, which means that through the consortium, you can tailor your experience across collaborating schools and disciplines. But whatever you choose, you’ll learn alongside students and faculty who share your interests and are ready to push the boundaries of knowledge together.\n\n“My film studies advisor pointed me toward specific classes and professors. She was so knowledgeable about the film studies departments at the other colleges, and the information she gave me was absolutely vital,” — Cassidy Anthony ’17"
