‘Pha Chana Dai’ – See the sun rise before anyone else in Siam at Dong Na Tham Forest

About 55 kilometres from Pha Taem National Park, there is a Sumatran Pine tree forest at Pha Chana Dai. It is a place that the Department of Meteorology has calculated as being the first point in Thailand where the sun rays can be seen at sunrise, and it lies at longitude 105? 37’ 17” east. This cliff is just one of a variety of tourist attractions of Dong Na Tham forest. It is a large forest running parallel with the Mekong River; it has the largest number of mushroom-like stone pillars in Thailand, and is a very popular hiking area for adventurers of all kinds. Apart from this, in a nearby area there is the Huai Pork Waterfall, which is a huge waterfall that flows down to and along the base of the cliff for a distance of more than 300 metres. The source of the stream is on Dong Na Tham Mountain. If you look through the forest, you will see a range of mountains on the Laos side of the Mekong River. It is a beautiful scene in which you can see the sky above the mountain and then the Mekong River below.
