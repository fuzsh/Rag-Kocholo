Many variations on the principle are described thereafter, usually with confusion between volume- and weight-percentages of the components. A balance with a graduated beam and movable fulcrum for use in this type of study\n\nASSAYING 67 was described in the poem Carmen de ponderibus attributed to Priscian (sixth century A.D.; printed 1475) and in modified form in Galileo’s first scientific paper\n\nARREARS i ti Al: tj\n\nLEED | 5. \\ ——————— —————\n\n£9WZZM /\\WLF 7pS) / ZB pl , Cf)\n\nON AAI eA) : Pe MiSs AY, TN 7 ANN Wt Lg SB il wn mM itl} es SU lg |\n\naCeBOSSE = See ZL OOK SEES ~~. erm SS = | | SSS SS == ar ee lll ee NZ ra\n\nINN tg A = 2 | SS SS SENSE =\n\n=e Ee =a Ly | : KVZ N: nC we: | ST riba 2aanWhe?

Actually such balances would be hopelessly insensitive to small changes in composition.\n\n: An exact though tedious method is given by Ercker, who adjusts quantities of pure silver and pure gold granules counterpoising the sample to be assayed, until there is no change on immersing the balance in water (figure 41). He describes another method, using silver weights and determining the overweight\n\n68 METALLURGY AND ASSAYING on immersion in water, and a third method involving the comparison of the weights of equal lengths of wires of gold, silver, and the alloy, all drawn through\n\nthe same die. Ercker, however, did not recommend these assays, for he knew that different samples even of a pure metal may differ in density. Porta (1589) [16] has still another variant, erroneously computed, while Boyle developed a simple hydrometer float (1675) for weighing above and below water [59]. He tested coins by direct comparison against standards, and used no assumed relation between density and composition. The weight of a cast ball made in a standard mould was used by pewterers as a method of assay at least as early as the mid-fourteenth century. This was a simple acceptance or rejection test and although, in its actions against fraudulent pewterers, the Pewterers’ Company records the excess weight over the standards, it records no attempt to relate this to actual composition until the comparatively late date of 1710 [32]. Various qualitative assay methods were well known, and are discussed in some detail by Glauber [60]. He uses the colour of both flame and fume as an indicator of metals and makes astute observations on the effect of impurities on the shape\n\nof drops of metals, which we now interpret in terms of surface tension. Eight years earlier Glauber had suggested qualitative assay by observing the colours produced by a sample of ore melted with glass, a method that was later to be\n\nrefined into the borax bead test. . |\n\nMetallurgy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was much influenced by the wide distribution of printed books recording in detail the techniques and\n\n: alloy compositions that had been in use for many centuries, for the subject then became of general interest to scholars and other citizens. The special properties\n\nof metals and their transformations were not ignored in the general spirit of inquiry that now prevailed.\n\nWith the foundation of the great learned societies in the mid-seventeenth century the practical knowledge of artisans attracted the interest of experimental philosophers, but practical knowledge continued far in advance of theory. Not until the eighteenth century was theoretical science in a position to aid practice in any but minor ways. Yet the methods of modern science were being begotten from this conjunction of philosophy with the practical observation and intuitive\n\nknowledge of those who actually handled the materials, and in the next century the increased understanding of the nature of metals and their reactions led naturally to improved processes and to materials better suited for the increasingly stringent demands of a more sophisticated engineering.\n\nMETALLURGY AND ASSAYING 69 REFERENCES [1] PROBIERBUCHLEIN.

U. NEF\n\nI. THE EARLY HISTORY OF COAL : T is impossible to say when coal was first deliberately burned. What is certain\n\n| is that this mineral has played animportant partinthedevelopment ofwestern —_ technology only in comparatively recent times, namely since the Middle Ages. Scientific interest in coal as a source of raw materials, not merely of heat, was a product of the nineteenth century. All the societies that evolved before the Christian era in the Mediterranean basin and 1n the Near East had some recourse to the mineral wealth of the subsoil. But there have never been, at least since the dawn of recorded history, rich\n\ncoal-seams near the surface in Egypt, north Africa, the Balkans, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, or India. If coal, or at any rate lignite, was burned at all in these regions before the birth of Christ (and there is little convincing evidence that it was) it had certainly no part in shaping the technical development of ancient peoples. Here its history has to be distinguished sharply from that of metals such as copper, lead, iron, or even silver and gold, for the ores of all of these metals were dug in ancient times, and the technology of metallurgy has a very ancient\n\nand interesting history (vol I, ch 21; vol II, ch 2; vol III, ch 2). After the Hellenistic era the extension of Roman dominion beyond the Alps into northwestern Europe placed the technology and science of Graeco-Roman societies partly at the disposal both of settlers from southern Europe and other parts of the Roman Empire, and of the inhabitants conquered by the legions of Rome in Gaul and Britain. Both Gaul and Britain are distinguished from other parts of the empire—the Balkans, the Near East, and north Africa—by abundant outcropping coal-seams. Such seams were to be found to some extent at several places in southern and central France, and in much greater numbers along a strip of territory in the Low Countries that begins just west of Mons and runs in an easterly direction to Liege and onwards to Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle).\n\nThe most abundant outcropping coal-seams were in Britain. It has been suggested by one scholar, on the basis of modern archaeological evidence, that after the Roman conquest coal was fairly extensively worked for a time at many\n\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF COAL 73 places in England, particularly during the fourth century a.p. [1]. Such a high importance is, however, not usually allowed to the coal-workings of Roman _ Britain; and even if it were the case that mineral fuel was dug during the Roman occupation in most of those fields where the seams poked their way close to the surface, it is unlikely that coal had anv appreciable influence in Graeco-Roman times upon technological processes—upon the structure of ovens, forges, and furnaces, upon the machinery used in industry, or upon the means of transporting commodities by land and sea in any part of Europe. After the barbarian invasions from the east and north, verifiable historical references to the digging or the use of coal disappear, so far as both the European\n\ncontinent and Britain are concerned. From the sixth to the eleventh century there is apparently no mention of coal in the documents of medieval Europe. Nor have archaeologists, it seems, been able to offer any clear evidence that coal\n\nwas worked during that period. There is nothing for coal comparable to the records we have concerning metallurgy, and iron metallurgy in particular, during these early centuries of medieval history. Foreigners and visitors from the south of Europe and from the Near East sometimes speak, not without awe, of the iron-work of the barbarians, particularly their weapons of war and above all their swords. They never mention the burning of coal. In short, coal remained a closed chapter in western Europe until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries—if indeed, which is rather doubtful, it had ever been anything more than a footnote to a chapter.\n\nFarther west still, across the Atlantic, on the huge continent of which the ancient and medieval peoples seem to have been unaware, no chapter was written by coal, not even a footnote, until after the European settlers began to come in\n\nduring the sixteenth century. The rich early societies of South and Central America, and those particularly of Peru and Mexico, made some use of metal, but apparently none of coal. This is not surprising when we realize how poor these territories were in coal-resources as contrasted with North America, which was still in the hands of primitive tribes. In the Far East the early history of coal was different. Marco Polo (1254?? 1324) was much struck when he discovered that in parts of China the natives were burning black stones as fuel. As an Italian, he had never seen this done before. While he probably would have been less astonished had he come from the Low Countries or from England, it appears that coal had been worked in China much more extensively than in Europe for many centuries. The question is how extensively and for what purposes coal had been burned. On these points the historians’ answer must still be tentative. Joseph Needham has recently\n\n74 COAL MINING AND UTILIZATION , declared, ‘It is certain that coal was used directly for smelting iron at least since the fourth century in China.’ Needham seems to have compelling evidence that\n\n: the smelting of iron ore was common in parts of China a great many centuries earlier than it was in Europe, partly because some Chinese ores could be melted at a considerably lower temperature than any European ones. But it does not necessarily follow that coal fuel was commonly used in the process. It has been suggested, on the other hand, that relevant passages in Chinese literature indicate nothing more than the use of coal in the manufacture of iron objects; such a use of coal in producing crude iron wares, for example horse-shoes, was in other parts of the world frequently that to which coal was first put, coal being mixed with charcoal in the forge [2]. The substitution of coal for other fuels in the working of wrought iron in smithies presented no technical problems commensurable with those involved in the first smelting of the iron from ores. What is certain is that coal has been dug and used as fuel in China for two or three\n\nmillennia. The Chinese made rather more of their coal resources than other peoples until the thirteenth, and possibly until the sixteenth, century. In Europe, from the thirteenth to the middle of the sixteenth century, the coal\n\nresources of the Low Countries, especially those of the small principality of Liége, were those most exploited. Charles the Bold (1433-77), the fiery Duke of Burgundy, in his fury with the Liégeois, is said to have ordered his soldiers to erase the city from the map, and to have vowed that even its name should not be revived. Yet, in the decades following his death, Liége became one of the great European armouries. During the first half of the sixteenth century the output of\n\ncoal in the region tripled or quadrupled [3] to provide fuel for the growing manufactures of iron and other metals into finished wares in the town itself and at many places up and down the wide, gently flowing river Meuse (figure 42). Liége coals were not quite carried to Newcastle; but this fuel from the land of ‘Luick’ did compete at Calais and other Channel ports with sea-coal brought from the Tyne. At Liege, long adits were driven to drain the coal-pits sunk in the hills above the town. They were planned systematically in such a way that the\n\ncontinuous fiow from the underground passages, where the miners worked, provided the main water-supply of the city. The town had a double stake in the careful development of the technique of working coal. By the mid-sixteenth century the mounds of black earth thrown up beside the pits were hardly less\n\nprominent a sight for travellers than the spires of the churches. They were more portentous of the future that awaited the western people than the city halls, the courts of justice, and the merchant palaces that were rising in profusion [4].\n\nars ; ae sy ar cates\n\ngraere io,Ss 3s SS °aS PR de . 1 25 ere | ad “SSS oo S Lad an * eS | SSS SWS as ey; ; jor gf ba) as ~Seas an yehe sour’ . 7|Si?

But the early\n\n~—-Fyeure 44-—Cokecburning. 1773. efforts to coke the coal failed. It was. apparently in connexion with the drying\n\nof malt that success was first achieved, in Derbyshire about the time of the Civil War (1642-8). Beer brewed from malt dried with what were then called ‘coaks’ was pronounced sweet and pure (figure 44). The coke was made from a special kind of hard coal dug near Derby; and, as a result of the new discovery, Derbyshire beer became famous throughout England [15]. The same properties of raw coal that transmitted a disagreeable taste to the\n\nbeer brewed from coal-dried malt caused it when used in blast-furnaces to damage the cast and pig iron, making it brittle and useless. Yet, curiously enough, it seems that haif a century elapsed after coke was used in drying malt before it was successfully tried in a blast-furnace. Meanwhile, at the end of the seventeenth century, the invention of a new reverberatory furnace for smelting the ores of lead, and later those of tin and copper, made it possible to substitute\n\n: raw coal for charcoal in these metallurgical processes. The first recorded | successful experiment in using coke for smelting iron ore was at Broseley, in Shropshire, in 1709 [16], but this experiment did not at once bring about any widespread introduction of mineral fuel into iron metallurgy. The problem of\n\nCOAL MINING AND TRANSPORT SI using something more than driblets of coal at the forges where pig iron was made\n\ninto bars and rods remained to be solved. Until it was solved, the iron-works generally had to be grouped about the forests rather than about the expanding coal-mines. As the ironmasters required charcoal in large quantities for converting pig into bar iron, they may have felt that they might as well use it also in their\n\nblast-furnaces. :\n\nSome seventy years later, about 1784, Henry Cort (1740-1800) invented the so-called puddling process, in which the evolved heat of coal fuel was transmitted by reverberation to make pig iron into bar iron. This invention, combined with Cort’s new method of finishing iron by passing it through grooved rolls, ensured the triumph of coal in iron metallurgy. Puddling made it possible to eliminate the deleterious sulphur from the iron.\n\nSome 200 years elapsed, then, between the time at which the technical problem of substituting coal for wood fuel was first raised in an acute form and the actual effective union of coal and iron. It seems to have been, above all, the advent of a coal-burning economy in Britain, beginning at the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which brought about the union.! The need that arose about 1600 for substituting coal, cheap near the mines and anywhere near navigable water, for wood, cheap only at great distances from the principal markets for iron, provided an unprecedented stimulus for technical inventions of new kinds. The fact that this need was felt at the same time in a host of other industrial processes focused the attention of inventors on the various problems of substituting coal for. wood. In the long run, it provided inventors with a wide range of experience on which they could draw for the knowledge they needed to solve the especially difficult and complicated problems presented by the substitution of coal for charcoal in iron-metallurgy. IV. COAL MINING AND TRANSPORT\n\nThe need for digging and transporting coal in far greater quantities than ever before, caused by the expansion in demand at the juncture of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, made acute two other technical problems, whose eventual solution precipitated the industrial revolution 200 years afterwards. One was the drainage of mines at a considerable depth. Flooded pits had plagued the miners of central Europe even before the first Elizabethan age. During the late fifteenth\n\nand early sixteenth centuries there was a great increase in the demand for * To some extent, however, the advent in seventeenth-century Britain of a coal-burning economy might be represented as delaying the solution of the problems of smelting iron ore with coal. The adoption of coal in so many other industries reduced the pressure on the English forests for wood fuel, and perhaps encouraged ironmasters to persist in the use of charcoal.\n\n5363.8 G\n\n82 COAL MINING AND UTILIZATION copper, and for the silver which was being obtained for the first time from argentiferous copper ores. This led to more intensive mining in central Europe, and ingenious engines for raising water were devised, notably in Hungary. Some of these engines had come into fairly common use in Germany and the adjacent countries to the east and south in the time of Agricola, whose celebrated posthumous treatise on mining and metallurgy, De re metallica, appeared in 1556 (vol II, p 13). The machinery for drainage, like the machinery that moved the\n\n| gl | i> ,|, & =o we ie : it\n\n| | Tbow i AE LW rm = i TENS \\ \\SA a ie Mo. ad ty gay, / 2 st A Ne ae =f | \\f Ma MAA RKSS OS Lo ac: = WE \\ee al = IAae | re Kas aa ad Gases 3 7 oe So a\n\nee ae oe a (2 a Sa Sea Pg Oy ce Signe Sere Eira Soe aE AMR cea seen |, eae WE Cas Neeece ee | aemuiamaain es aoe St ay a ee OR\n\n, FiGuRE 45—Horse-whim haulage machine used at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 177}.\n\nmost powerful bellows and the heaviest hammers in the metallurgical works, and like that which raised salt water from the brine-springs at the principal salt works, was driven by horses or by the force of moving or falling water. Until after the Reformation Britain was backward compared with the leading continental countries in the use of such power-driven machines. During the last half of the sixteenth century Englishmen travelled abroad, especially in Germany, 1n search of technical knowledge that could be used in mining as well as in\n\nmetallurgy. Foreign mining-experts from central Europe came to Britain to instruct the English and the Scots (p 63). Models of the most ingenious engines known hitherto in Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, and the Harz were set up for inspection in some mining centres in Great Britain, notably at Wollaton on the outskirts of Nottingham.\n\nCOAL MINING AND TRANSPORT 83 By the end of the sixteenth century it was becoming plain that the early sources of power for driving machinery—wind, water, and animals—would prove inadequate to meet the special problems of draining flooded coal-pits which the unprecedented growth of coal-mining in England presented. Silver-bearing ores\n\nowed their value mainly to their scarcity. In connexion with these ores, the new horse- and water-driven engines, introduced in mining and especially in metallurgy at the beginning of the sixteenth century in central Europe, proved economical for a time, partly because the silver and copper fetched good prices,\n\nuntil the inflow of American silver during the second half of the sixteenth century depressed the markets. Coal, on the other hand, owed its new-found value mainly to its abundance. Mine-owners in Britain were staggered, as their\n\ncontinental predecessors had never been, by the cost of drainage even when they copied the most advanced continental methods. It was difficult to produce coal for long at a profit when it was necessary to maintain many squads of horses to drive the engines (figure 45), or, in lieu of horses, to divert streams and even rivers from their courses and dam up water to drive such engines. It was more\n\ndifficult in mining than in metallurgy to make this substitution, because the water-power for driving the hammers at metallurgical works could be concentrated, as the water-power for driving drainage-machinery at coal-mines could not, for a fairly long stretch of time at a single place. In short, the costs of the older sources of power for driving machinery were rendered almost prohibitively high in connexion with such a product as coal, widely considered so objection-\n\nable and vile that the greatest English poet made his characters shun Master Seacoal! whenever he appeared on the stage. Consequently, the pressure that a coal-economy exercised for the discovery of a new source of power capable of cheapening the costs of machinery was unprecedented. At their wits’ end to deal successfully with the problems of flooded coal-mines,\n\nmining-experts began to turn to the knowledge which had long existed that power might be generated by a jet of steam. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century in England, and to a lesser extent on the continent, some persons\n\nset about trying to apply this force of steam to solve the new difficulties of draining coal-mines. Attempt after attempt was made throughout the country. As one colliery expert remarked almost a hundred years after the treatises of Sturtevant and Rovenzon were printed, and after experiments with steam were tried, whoever discovered a practical, workable steam-engine to help the mineowners to drain their pits was sure to be rewarded so handsomely that he could\n\nset up in London with his coach and six [17]. | 1 ‘Much Ado about Nothing.’ ,\n\n84 COAL MINING AND UTILIZATION | He had hardly written those words when primitive steam-engines were in fact\n\n) installed in collieries, first in Staffordshire about 1712. They spread thence | quickly to other parts of the British Isles, and to the continent. It was, however, not until seventy-five years later—not until the widespread application of Watt’s invention of a rotary engine in the 1780s—that steam-power began to come into\n\ngeneral use for driving machinery in manufactures. The preliminary experiments at the beginning of the seventeenth century brought about by the early, precocious expansion of the British coal industry, were no less essential a preparation for the invention of the steam-engine than for the union of iron and\n\ncoal. ,\n\nSimilar problems of meeting high costs with a commodity that fetched such a\n\noun Pr ok Sak Pe oN fie Y peg (BEE see RE = te COUNTY of ae ” JAW | : dm tt ACCURATE HAP of Joh Rivemismnr | Wee ff - :\n\n/¥| NORTHUMBERLAND, YS |AOD | : a : Lied down from the brst 4 vw orrvie iA / 4 f Th \\\n\n| yw avd iF s \\.‘.j wal | VIN 2 =A W .

The side-pieces were extended to form handles. As recently as 1850, in Merionethshire, manure was carried to the fields upon these barrows. Each farm in a locality specified a day for dung-carrying, and all the neighbours would congregate at the chosen farm with their barrows. The carrying was performed by means of a shuttle-service, the load changing hands many times before it finally reached the field. Wheel-less sledges were also very common in hilly districts, where they were\n\n, mainly used for short-distance porterage around the farm. In the British Isles they persisted until recent times in Cornwall and Devon, Wales, Cumbria, ScotJand, and Ireland, as well as in the marshy districts of East Anglia. Sledges were of two types, the dorsal-car and the slide-car.\n\nThe dorsal-car (figure 80) consisted of two stout, parallel timbers joined together by a number of cross-bars. The side-pieces extended to form a pair of\n\nAGRICULTURAL VEHICLES I4I shafts, which were attached to the horse high up on the collar. The vehicle was dragged along the ground at a tilt, hence it was necessary to fit a wooden framework, or ladder, at the back, so that the load would not fall out. A smaller ladder was also fitted at the front, while the load could be made more secure by tying it down with ropes—a necessary procedure when carrying hay, corn, or wood on steep mountain slopes. The slide-car (figure 81) differed from the dorsal-car in that the whole base of the vehicle was dragged along the ground like a sledge. Again it consisted of\n\ntwo parallel side-pieces joined by a number of cross-bars that formed the carrying-surface of the car. While the dorsal-car was dragged, with the end of\n\nop ___.__\\) | |\n\n‘waa ee\n\nve eel\n\nFigure 81—Slide-car from Llanbrynmair, Montgomeryshire.\n\nthe side-pieces bearing on the ground, the slide-car was equipped with a pair of wooden runners bearing the weight of the vehicle. Generally the body was tilted forwards on these runners, the angle of tilt depending on the slope of the land on which it was used. The vehicle was attached to the horse by a pair of tracechains rather than by shafts. These forms of transport, well known from very early times (see vol I, ch 26, and II, ch 15), are still occasionally used in upland districts. They are extremely suitable for the topography of such areas, while the fact that they can be made by the farmer himself, from timber growing on the farm, accounts in no small measure for their continued use. Upland farming 1s generally difficult and, since the income of the individual farmer is low, tools and implements are consequently primitive and specialized craftsmen rare. While human porterage and sledge-transport was efficient for short-distance carriage, something more adaptable was required for longer distances. Packhorse teams, common in medieval times, continued to be used in hilly districts; for example, they were very common in Devon and Cornwall until the end of the nineteenth century. In those counties they were used not only for long-distance\n\n142 FARM-TOOLS, VEHICLES, AND HARNESS transport but for carriage around the farm. Pack-horses were equipped with a pair of baskets (panniers) for carrying peat and similar material; or with a pair of boxes (pots) for dung-carrying; or with a pair of wooden frames (crooks) for harvesting. All these were slung over the animals’ backs. In addition, packhorses were sometimes equipped with an arched wooden saddle, the load being usually in a bag slung over it. Carts. In medieval times two-wheeled carts were in general use wherever the terrain was suitable for wheeled transport. The carts were either drawn by horses, as seen in the illustration from the Luttrell psalter (vol II, figure 500),\n\n| or by teams of oxen, and were equipped either with spoked wheels or with primitive solid-disk wheels. Vehicles with solid wheels remained common in\n\nSTON TTT TTT MTU gS A\n\nFicgure 82—Scotch cart, 1813.\n\nmany parts of the world until recently, and may still be seen in a number of isolated districts. In early nineteenth-century northern Scotland heavy carts | with tripartite disk-wheels were numerous, although they were being gradually supplanted by lighter carts designed to be drawn by a single horse. The wheels\n\nof the old heavy carts turned in one piece with the axles, and because the vehicles tumbled along they were known as ‘tumblers’. The Lowlands of central Scotland were, however, the centre of a great agrarian movement in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. English farmers sent their sons as farm-pupils to Scotland, where the most advanced and skilful husbandry was thought to be practised. In that region the design of carts and agricultural implements generally was far in advance of anything then used in other parts of Britain. Through contacts between England and Scotland, the\n\n| Scotch cart was copied by craftsmen not only throughout Britain, but on the continent as well. It was generally light enough to be pulled by one horse (figure 82), in spite of its long capacious body. A typical cart measured 5 ft 6 inches in length, 4 ft 6 inches in width, and 1 ft 7 in deep at the front. The\n\nAGRICULTURAL VEHICLES 143 narrow spoked wheels had a diameter of between 4 ft 6 in and 4 ft 10 in. The body was often made to tip, in which case the cart was known as a coup-cart. The Scotch cart was therefore a general-purpose farm-vehicle, for when it was required for harvesting a wooden framework could be attached to the top of the body, thus considerably increasing its load-carrying capacity. Throughout the nineteenth century one-horse carts of Scottish design replaced the traditional heavy vehicles on the English farm. The Luttrell psalter of the fourteenth century shows the heavy two-wheeled vehicle in general use in England in the Middle Ages. It was drawn by three horses in tandem, and the massive six-spoked wheels were fitted with iron lugs\n\neS a giS\"j Y\n\nce, es\n\naN A OG ae ey a gp\n\nFigure 83—Tumbril from north Essex.\n\nto prevent the vehicle from slipping. The sides of the cart were open rather than boarded, while fore- and tail-ladders were fitted to take the overhanging load. Until the introduction of the Scotch cart in the late eighteenth century, English two-wheeled carts followed this medieval tradition. They continued to be heavy\n\nand clumsy, and required at least two horses, or four oxen, to draw them. In marshy districts the wheels were not even shod with metal, while in other districts crescent-shaped pieces of iron, called strakes, were nailed to the wheel\n\nto prevent wear. One very important development on the English midland plain, however, was that at some time during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries four-wheeled wagons replaced the traditional harvest-cart, especially on the larger farms. On the smaller farms two-wheeled vehicles with open sides\n\nand fore- and tail-ladders continued in use until fairly recent times. Although | these carts were generally light, they were very much in the medieval tradition. . While four-wheeled wagons were used for harvesting on the English plain and ___ the flatter regions of Europe generally, two-wheeled carts of small capacity were\n\n144 FARM-TOOLS, VEHICLES, AND HARNESS | retained for special purposes on the farm. For dung-carting two-wheeled vehicles were invariably used. As early as the mid-eighteenth century, tilt-carts or tumbrils were in use throughout western Europe (figure 83). A tumbril had fairly low wheels, and a body sloping upwards to a very high frontboard, which leaned out over the horse’s back. Two heavy pieces of oak formed the frame of\n\n} the cart, and these projected at the back to rest on the ground when the cart was tipped for unloading. An older version of the tumbril was the box-cart with a fixed body that could not be tipped. Its general shape was that of a tumbril,\n\nbut in order to unload it the horse was unharnessed and the whole vehicle, including the shafts, tipped backwards. In the hilly districts of Europe, where slopes were too steep for the use of wagons yet not so steep as wholly to forbid wheeled transport, two-wheeled carts were used for all farming purposes, including harvesting. Although box-\n\ncarts were often adapted for harvesting by the addition of frames at the top, specialized harvest-carts were nevertheless common. The simplest of these was\n\nthe cart consisting of a flat wooden platform placed on a pair of wheels. The Cornish wain of the eighteenth century and possibly earlier was of this type— a long rectangular platform with arched guards over the low wheels. It had fore- and tail-ladders, while at the back there was a small windlass for tightening the ropes thrown over the load. The Scottish harvest-cart was similar in shape and design, though slightly smaller, while the Welsh gambo differed in that it had a pair of rails to prevent the load spilling over the wheels, rather than arched\n\nwheel-guards. These Celtic harvest vehicles pulled by either horses or oxen\n\n| may be regarded as the British equivalents to the Mediterranean ox-carts. In Scandinavia and north-western Europe generally, the normal harvest-cart was rather different. It had a very long, narrow, rectangular frame. A number of wooden spindles, each approximately 12 in long, was fixed to the frame at such an angle that the spindles overhung the two wheels. The wheels were generally very low, while the cart was again fitted with fore- and tail-ladders.\n\n| Wagons. It is not known at what date four-wheeled wagons were introduced into Britain, but it is almost certain that they were extremely rare until the ‘sixteenth century. In the Middle Ages the lack of contact between one region and another, and the communal nature of farming, meant that elaborate wheeled\n\nvehicles were unnecessary and rare. The long wagon with its canvas cover, illustrated in the Luttrell psalter, was without doubt a vehicle for carrying people rather than goods: a successor of the Roman carruca (vol II, p 540) rather than a predecessor of the carrier’s wagon. Four-wheeled vehicles were, however, in general use on the continent of Europe in the Middle Ages, and haulage firms\n\nAGRICULTURAL VEHICLES 145 competed to some extent on the main routes. For the limited amount of longdistance transport on English medieval roads two-wheeled vehicles carrying no more than a ton were used. The sixteenth century saw the break-down of the localism of the Middle Ages, which meant that more and better vehicles were required to transport the produce of the agricultural regions to the ever-growing towns. The four-wheeled carrier’s wagon became very common in the late sixteenth century, and although at that time the largest wagons carried only four tons, by the end of the seventeenth century wagons able to carry anything up to eight tons were numerous. These large vehicles, each drawn by a team of up to twelve horses, ran on certain routes on days specified beforehand. For example, there was a regular service between some Sussex towns and London, the wagons\n\ntaking loads of wheat and oats to the metropolis. For the return journey to Sussex they loaded up with old, but sound, ships’ timber from London shipbreaking yards. This timber was bought by Sussex landowners for use in building cottages and barns on their estates. The old stage-wagons were well suited for long-distance haulage, but owing to their great weight they were unsuitable for transport around the farm. During the mid-eighteenth century, the whole aspect of British farming was changing very quickly. More than two hundred private enclosure acts were passed between 1727 and 1760, and enclosed farming became the rule rather than the exception. With this release of initiative, there arose a demand for something much larger than the two-wheeled carts hitherto used on English farms. Village wainwrights took as their model the existing stage-wagons, and adapted them to their needs. Three- or four-ton wagons became the rule; loaded with hay or corn-sheaves, they could easily be drawn by two horses on the journey from the fields to the rickyard. The general principle on which wagons were built was uniform throughout the country, despite much variation in detail. Counties and districts favoured their own particular designs, the differences being due to the varying demands of soil and topography. For example, the wagons of East Anglia were heavy and\n\n| box-like, as befitted an area of flat land with large fields. The wagons of the Cotswolds, on the other hand, in use in an undulating region with numerous steep slopes, were much lighter, and excess weight was cut down wherever possible. In general, English farm-wagons may be divided into two distinct types —the box- and the bow-wagon. The box-wagon, as it name suggests, had a deep rectangular body, and where raves or side-boards occurred they were generally narrow (figure 84). This type of vehicle occurred in eastern England, the Mid-\n\n5363.3 L\n\n- Jands, the Welsh border counties, and in south-eastern England.\n\n146 FARM-TOOLS, VEHICLES, AND HARNESS The bow-wagon had a much shallower body, characterized by side-boards arching over the rear wheels. This lowered the bed of the wagon, without lessen-\n\ning the diameter of the wheels. The bow-wagon was common to the west of England, occurring from the Chilterns in the east to Glamorganshire and Devon in the west. In general design the wagons of Lincolnshire, resembling those used in the Low Countries and western Europe generally, may be regarded as the simplest of English box-wagons. The typical Lincolnshire wagon was a large vehicle\n\n(oe\n\n| ee MINS REVERS , AZ Bf? Uf | INCOLY\n\ni) een eS 2 \\ | Jiaaree AE Ig fe iif o4)\n\nSEE Ty jj 07/73, eee.)

The lofty, sloping front-board was usually elaborately decorated, and the name of the owner, his address, and the date of manufacture were written on it. Although the body was generally narrow, measuring no more than 42 in wide, it had the considerable length of 12 ft 6 in. The sides of the vehicle were characterized by a large number of wooden pins or spindles acting as supports for the sides, while the bottom frames\n\nof the body were notched to form a waist. On turning the wagon, the wheels would enter the waist, and the lock was therefore considerable. The wheels themselves were greatly dished and large, the hind wheels with a diameter of 65 in and the front wheels with a diameter of 54 in. The wagon was not usually equipped with side-boards, thus resembling the continental vehicles, but a wooden framework could be fitted on it to take any overhanging load.\n\nAGRICULTURAL VEHICLES 147 The Wiltshire wagon was probably the parent type of all the west of England bow-wagons, for although in shape it was similar to those used in the Cotswolds, Oxfordshire, and Glamorganshire it was much simpler in design. Wagons from the south of the county had narrow-tired wheels for use on the hard chalk-land of Salisbury Plain, while those from the north of the county had broad wheels, up to 8 inches in width, for the clay land of the vale of Pewsey and the vale of the White Horse. Apart from this variation in the width of wheels, the wagons used throughout the county were remarkably uniform in design. The outstanding features of the Wiltshire wagon were the wide side-boards that curved archwise\n\nSS. s Le x > —— ~y — ae Lee| aa NG —_ \\\\pS TSOa ra = Ss —__—«“ area ae wr -=i\n\n‘ \\— a = = ee, mPa Hunan mnaT pha : NJ .\n\n—— e ae 4 LP ~ i om ay:\n\nOE | Me i ea \\\\ Ww | | ome (ee NUS oe\n\nerr Me MED yay ir I N\\\\ y* Lg ' ‘4 NI Lh\n\nao | ff\n\n’ ee” i) \\ yy! | o, - 2 / \\ : PY ils Se\n\n\"~ y\n\nus RES.

Since the bottom frames of the body were straight, the Wiltshire wagon suffered one great disadvantage, in that it required as much as a quarter of an acre to turn in,\n\nfor the wheels soon rubbed against the frames if the vehicle was turned too sharply. The typical Wiltshire wagon had a very shallow body, no more than 15 in deep. On the other hand, the body was as much as 80 inches in maximum width, and 12 ft 6 in long. Although the actual body of the vehicle was small, the overhanging side-boards added considerably to its load-carrying capacity. The wheels were generally smaller than those of the box-wagon, the hind wheels of\n\nthe average wagon having a diameter of 55 in and the front wheels of 45 in (figure 85). All the early farm-wagons were designed for a specific type of soil and country,\n\nand were built by village craftsmen who followed traditional methods and\n\n148 FARM-TOOLS, VEHICLES, AND HARNESS | designs. In this way distinctly regional styles of wagons came into existence. It was not until the late nineteenth century that standardized vehicles produced by\n\nlarge-scale manufacturers came on the market, and these boat-wagons and trolleys with smaller wheels, greater lock, and sprung undercarriages were used alongside the older village-made vehicles. III. HARNESS\n\nInformation about the history of harness between 1500 and 1900 is very scarce,\n\nbut the harness now in use has altered little since 1800 (figure 86).

The imperfections of the lathe itself (p 336) rendered this a difficult art, especially when the radius of curvature required for the tool might be 40 ft or more (figure 1 56). The glass blank had to be\n\npressed hard down upon the tool with the fingers, or with a small handle cemented to it, so that the process was laborious as well as lengthy.\n\n236 GLASS To lighten the labour various machines were proposed, similar in principle to machines sketched by Leonardo for use in working metallic mirrors. A simple device used by Huygens involved mounting the blank on a pivoted lever (figure 157) pressed down on the tool by a movable weight. The next stage was to\n\n, rotate either the tool or the blank—or both—mechanically, as in Huygens’s proposed machine of 1665 (figure 157). This principle is employed today. Some\n\n| seventeenth-century opticians, however, attempted to go farther than this by\n\n: devising machines that would obviate the need for the dish-like tool and work the glass directly in the manner of a lathe.\n\nAll these machines were driven by crank-\n\ny) handles, belts, and gearing, thus requir-\n\n| ing the services of two men.\n\n\" The method of working a number of\n\n_ } small lenses at once was described by { | Hevelius (1611-87) as early as 1647.

A lens without a highly polished surface is quite useless. The lens was still worked in the same manner on a metal\n\ntool—either manually or with the aid of a machine—exactly of the required radius; for grinding, the radius of the tool might be slightly greater than that of the finished lens. In the final stages the tool was often lined with pitch, made very smooth and accurately curved while plastic, or with paper after hardening.\n\nWINDOW-GLASS 237 The abrasives used for polishing were tripoli powder (kieselguhr), jeweller’s rouge (a form of ferric oxide), or tin-putty (tin oxide), levigated to yield various sizes of particle. Towards the end, the polishing was invariably effected by hand; the work must have been exceedingly slow, tedious, and laborious as a heavy\n\npressure was required. Finally, the lens was buffed on a simple form of lathe worked by a treadle—less effort was required, and intimate co-ordination between the hand, foot, and eye of the operator was important. Special problems arose when, after 1671, mirrors to some extent replaced lenses. They were all cast in a white tin-copper alloy, to which were added small\n\nproportions of antimony, arsenic, and other metals supposed to improve the properties of the speculum. Because the alloy was softer than glass, it was easily spoilt by harsh abrasives or excessively vigorous polishing. But the speculum had one important advantage. By considered use of trial-and-error, and repeated examination of the image, it could be brought to a valuable non-spherical curvature. James Short (1710-68) was the first to ‘parabolize’ a telescope speculum successfully, and it was to such skill in polishing large mirrors—a protracted and\n\narduous labour—that both he and Herschel owed their unparalleled success with the reflecting telescope. The technique was in principle exactly the same as that used for figuring and polishing lenses. VIII. WINDOW-GLASS\n\nIn the Roman Empire window-glass was uncommon before the third century A.D., although a very limited number of glazed window-slits have been found in\n\nhouses in both Herculaneum and Pompei. As these cities were destroyed in A.D. 79, its employment must have begun at least as early as the first century of our era. The Roman glass for windows was either cast or rolled, being sometimes polished afterwards. It was thus more nearly related to plate than to sheet glass. The evolution of Gothic architecture, bringing about an enormous increase in the window-area of ecclesiastical buildings, stimulated a considerable develop-\n\nment of the window-glass industry of the district between the Seine and the Rhine. As one might expect, the earliest window-glass used in Britain appears to have consisted of the little pieces of coloured glass inserted in church windows.\n\nThey could be made comparatively easily because of their small size, and be- | cause impure materials would serve when the final result was to be coloured. The first Lorraine makers of window-glass came to work in England in 1567. In Scotland as late as 1661 the windows of ordinary country houses were not glazed, and only the upper parts of those of even the royal palaces had glass, the lower ones having two wooden shutters to open at pleasure and admit fresh air.\n\n238 - GLASS Some advance in the manufacture of plate glass by casting or coulage was made at Venice and afterwards at Nuremberg, but the sheets remained small. By the middle of the seventeenth century there was a demand, especially in France, for large sheets of clear glass for mirrors and the portséres of coaches. Colbert (1619-83), the great minister of Louis XIV, who came into office in 1661, brought glass-makers from Venice, where glass mirrors had been made from early in the fourteenth century. England was not far behind, for mirrors of blown plate-glass were manufactured at Lambeth about 1670, with the assistance at first of Italian workmen brought over by the Duke of Buckingham. Some of the finest surviving examples of this kind of work are in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alternative method of producing plate glass by casting had been developed\n\nin Normandy, and in 1676 Colbert, expressly to encourage it, placed the French royal glass-works under the control of the Norman glass-maker Lucas de Nehou, who was expert in the art. By 1691 the casting process had been so improved that plates of unprecedented size were being turned out. Essentially it consisted of pouring the glass upon a metal table, spreading it evenly by rollers, and later\n\n: treating it by grinding and polishing. The method that de Nehou laid down at the famous Saint-Gobain works was copied elsewhere and soon became standard practice. The main furnace stood in the middle of the glass-house; round it were grouped ovens or annealingkilns, called carquaises, and others for making frit and calcining old pieces of glass before re-melting (figure 141). The furnace seldom lasted more than three\n\n. years, and even then had to be refitted every six months. The melting-pots or crucibles, of the size of large hogsheads, contained about 2000 lb of metal. To assist fusion the charge, consisting of fresh materials mixed with scrap glass, was introduced in a number of stages, a fresh layer being added when the previous one had melted, until the crucible was full. Up to this point\n\nthe furnace had been kept merely at a red heat. There followed the fining or plaining’ stage, during which the furnace temperature was raised. Just the right temperature had to be maintained, for if the heat was too low bubbles remained in the metal, while if 1t was too high the walls of the crucible fused and dripped into the glass. The founding proper took twenty-four hours.\n\nWhen the molten glass was fit for casting there remained the problem of moving it to the casting table. No entirely satisfactory solution was found. One method consisted of ladling out the more or less liquid glass. In another a cistern was filled in the furnace and allowed to remain there for six hours afterwards; it was then withdrawn by means of a hook on an iron chain guided by a pulley,\n\n. To plain glass means to make it clear and free from bubbles, ,\n\nWINDOW-GLASS 239 and placed upon a frame mounted upon a four-wheeled base for transfer to the casting table. Upon reaching the table the removable base of the cistern was slipped off, allowing the molten metal to pour out. Ultimately 1t was found best simply to remove the melting-crucible from the furnace and invert it over the casting table. This drastic procedure was not good for the pot, and demanded strong lifting-tackle, but did result in the maximum amount of glass being delivered to the table in prime condition. A consequence of this method was the use of smaller pots for casting plate glass than the stationary ones used for other kinds of glass, so that their weight could be handled more easily.\n\nUpon the casting table the lateral limits to which the glass could flow were fixed by adjustable iron rulers determining the width of the sheet. On these iron side-rails ran a roller which enabled a man to flatten out the glass to a uniform thickness, this being done within the space of a minute to forestall the effects of rapid cooling. Later, as greater quantities of the molten metal came to be handled,\n\n- the roller was made larger and heavier, so that a crew of three or four men was needed to turn it. After annealing, which took about ten days, the glass plate had to be ground and polished. It was laid horizontally upon a flat bed of very fine-grained freestone, to which it was cemented with lime-stucco to prevent movement. The\n\nstone base of the seventeenth century was changed to a copper one in the eighteenth and to a cast iron one in the early part of the nineteenth. The bed was fitted with a wooden frame having a ledge all round rising up rather more than two inches above the grinding-level. Grinding was effected with a smaller plate of glass—not more than half the size of that to be treated—which was made to slide upon the one being ground.\n\nThe smaller plate was cemented to a plank, which in turn was fastened to a wheel of hard, light wood. Workmen pulled the wheel backwards and forwards, and sometimes turned it round, thus causing attrition between the two glasses. The introduction of the steam-engine to supply power for grinding and polishing did not take place until the closing years of the eighteenth century. This early form of grinding-mill had to be supplied with an abrasive. Water and coarse sand were accordingly poured in, to be followed by finer sand as the work advanced, and lastly by glass powder or smalt. After one side of the plate had been ground, it was reversed and the operation repeated on the other side. It was then ready for the polisher. An ingenious method of polishing plate glass was common to the European continent and England. A board and a small roller, both covered with felt, were\n\n240 GLASS used. The roller was moved by a double handle at each end, and was fixed to the\n\nceiling by a strong wooden hoop which acted as a spring. The action of the workman’s arms was facilitated by the spring, because this constantly brought the roller back to the same point. For many purposes thin blown glass formed into sheets could be used instead\n\nof cast plate, which was reserved for purposes requiring extra strength, like ' coach-windows. Blown glass had the advantage of retaining its original fire~ polish, so that no grinding or polishing was necessary. T'wo specialized methods of making sheet glass were developed, known as the ‘crown’ and the ‘cylinder’ processes. The former was the earlier.\n\n| Crown glass was originally more or less peculiar to Normandy, but later was made in England also. A gathering of molten glass was blown into a hollow sphere on the end of a blow-iron. To the opposite side of the sphere a pontil or solid iron rod was then attached by means of a nodule of the molten metal. The original blow-iron was broken free, leaving an opening in the globe. Rotating the glass rapidly while still in a semi-molten state caused it to open out into the form of a flat disk, adhering to the pontil by the boss in the centre. Crown glass had two characteristics, the small size of the sheet that could be made by this method, and the unavoidable presence of the bull’s eye in the centre. In Lorraine and the German states the hand-cylinder process was employed to make ‘broad glass’, sometimes known as German sheet. The method probably developed from that used for crown glass, but was a marked advance upon it. If a large globe of glass such as was used in the crown method was made to swing freely it extended into a cylinder; in practice, pits were provided to enable the glass-makers to obtain extra length. The weight of glass used was from 20 to 40 Ib according to the size of cylinder required. Cylinders were made from 12 to 20 inches in diameter and from 50 to 70 in long. When blown, their ends were\n\nremoved and they were slit lengthwise. Finally, by the simple device of reheating it in a kiln or flattening-oven the cylinder fell into a flat sheet. IX. STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS\n\nThe making of stained-glass windows is a traditional craft which early achieved results of great beauty. Lethaby has spoken of the window of coloured glass as the most perfect art-form known, and declares that the old glass holds the sunlight as it were within it, so that the whole becomes a mosaic of coloured fire.\n\nThe craft developed in the Mediterranean lands in the twelfth century. One of its chief aims was to keep churches pleasantly cool by excluding excess of\n\nSTAINED-GLASS WINDOWS 241 light. Only small pieces of glass could be produced at that time, but they were\n\nsufficient to build up mosaic windows. The irregular bits of blue and ruby glass were pieced together by means of grooved lead, the whole being held in a framework of stone supported by iron bars. Harmonious patterns were formed\n\nin this way. To soften and subdue the light stll further the glass was often shaded with a monochrome pigment of brown, consisting of powdered glass and\n\noxide of iron, with Senegal gum as an adhesive. In England twelfth-century examples of mosaic medallion windows are to be seen at Canterbury, York, Lincoln, Dorchester (Oxfordshire), Wilton, and Rivenhall. During the next century the glaziers produced larger windows, with freer use of figure subjects. In England, with her grey skies, the need for more light was felt and in consequence the grisaille style was evolved. Grisaille work gave beautiful effects of opalescence and mother-of-pearl, with delicate decoration of foliate designs and geometrical patterns. The Five Sisters window in York\n\nMinster is an outstanding example of this kind of work, and there are other excellent ones at Salisbury. A noteworthy discovery made early in the fourteenth century was that glass could be stained yellow with the oxide or chloride of silver, giving a full range of tones from lemon to orange. As other colours were added to the palette of the glass-stainer, the ‘decorated’ period (¢ 1280 to ¢ 1380) proved a brilliant one in stained glass. Heraldry figures prominently in windows, especially in England, Germany, Flanders, and later in Switzerland. In the course of the fourteenth century magnificent stained glass was made for many of the great churches in France, including Chartres, Evreux, Beauvais,\n\nRouen, Limoges, Carcassonne, and Paris. In England the east window of Gloucester Cathedral is of this period; it 1s the largest in the country, being 72 ft\n\nby 38 ft. Other English cathedrals, and the chapels of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, were similarly enriched at this time. The fifteenth century, in which the distinctively English style of architecture known as ‘perpendicular’ developed, was a most prolific period for stained glass. Colour-schemes grew ever lighter, and shading was kept luminous. Inscriptions were no longer scratched in enamel brown, but were done in dark lettering on a\n\nlight ground. The abrading of ruby and coated blue gave new effects. A more natural way of representing flesh-painting was obtained by using a wash of enamel colour upon white. One of the most brilliant uses made of these improved technical resources was in the introduction of an increasing number of coats of arms and other heraldic devices.\n\n5363.3 R\n\nThe last great period for stained glass was the first half of the sixteenth century,\n\n242 GLASS the age of the Renaissance. Designs spread over the whole window, and large pieces of glass were used without regard to the curbs and discipline of leads and mullions. Landscapes were painted with heavy smeared and stippled shadows. The windows of Fairford, Gloucestershire, and the noble glass of King’s College, Cambridge, belong to the earlier and better part of this period. By 1550 a severe decline had set in, with the technique of oil-painting eclipsing the true nature of stained glass. The introduction of chiaroscuro and similar devices hastened the fall into a dismal period of abasement.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY The books cited in the first two sections deal only incidentally with the techniques of glassmaking.\n\n1.

BRIGGS I, ITALY\n\nHE Renaissance revived interest in the classical learning of Greece and | Rome, largely forgotten or neglected in the preceding centuries. It had its origin in Italy, particularly in Florence. It made itself felt in literature\n\nduring the fourteenth century, but in architecture its beginning is usually associated with the visit of the youthful architect Brunelleschi (1377-1444) to Rome about 1402. He was seeking ideas for the design of a dome for the unfinished cathedral of Florence, then the subject of public competition. He certainly studied the ruins of ancient Roman buildings at first hand, and he won the competition. His dome was duly erected and is still standing; but, despite the popular belief that his antiquarian studies accounted for his triumph, his steeply pointed double dome, the first major work of Renaissance architecture (p 248 and figure 158), cannot have had a Roman origin, for there are no Roman or Byzantine double domes, and its prototype is probably Persian. Brunelleschi acquired an intense interest in Roman architecture, and was among those who spread a fashion for reviving it in Italy, where Gothic architecture had never aroused the keen enthusiasm that marked its development elsewhere in western Europe. In 1414 an ancient manuscript containing the lost text of Vitruvius on architecture and building construction (freely quoted in volume II) was discovered in a Swiss monastery. In 1486 the work appeared in print _ and increased the interest in ancient building construction. By the mid-fifteenth century Gothic architecture had gone out of fashion almost completely in Italy, except at Venice, and the forms of ancient Roman architecture, adapted to suit modern conditions, had taken its place. The movement did not affect the buildings of other countries for at least another fifty years, and even then was confined to minor details of design and ornament. In England, small examples of Italian decoration appeared, here and there, early in the sixteenth century, mainly in and around London in churches and mansions erected by the Crown or by noblemen (for example, in Wolsey’s work\n\nat Hampton Court); but its full effects were not felt until the early seventeenth century. Away from London, traditional Gothic methods of design and\n\n1 | a\\\n\n246 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION\n\nconstruction continued in all smaller buildings, such as manor-houses and cottages, right up to the time of Wren’s entry into architecture about 1662. In this chapter, the buildings of the Renaissance, up to ¢ 1700, will be treated\n\nin the order in which the new movement penetrated into three important countries: Italy, France, and England. The new influence was felt mainly in two\n\ndirections: architectural design and building construction.

In volume II (ch 12) it was explained how the trabeated buildings of the Greeks, with their various ‘Orders’ of columns, and the arcuated buildings of the Romans, with their round arches and domes and barrel-vaults, gradually came to be succeeded during the Middle Ages by ‘Gothic’ structures in which the pointed arch was the characteristic feature and in which thin stone-vaulted roofs were carried by a system of ribs, slender columns, and bold buttresses.\n\nITALY 247 Thus, by about 1500, Gothic churches in England, France, and Germany had become mere skeletons of masonry with intervening ‘walls’ or spaces filled with\n\nglass. During the thousand years that followed the fall of Rome, the classical orders of columns—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, as defined by Vitruvius—had been completely abandoned and forgotten.

The principal houses in the Grande Rue stand almost unchanged, save for the insertion of a shop-front here and there. They are of brickwork, now covered with stucco, with fine limestone dressings. The frontage of each is about 70 ft, the depth from front to back about 30 ft, with a courtyard in the rear and a spacious walled garden behind 11. A good deal of town-planning and town-improvement was also carried out in Paris during the seventeenth century. Henri IV (1589-1610) was the first European ruler since Roman days to undertake building operations on a large scale for political and social reasons, including the provision of employment. Paris in 1600\n\nwas in a deplorable state—ill planned, overcrowded, and insanitary. It could boast of but two bridges across the Seine, and five insignificant squares. In 1600,\n\nand again in 1608, Henri issued ordinances for the widening, alignment, and paving of streets, forbidding overhanging storeys. In 1600, the triangular Place Dauphine was laid out with middle-class houses and shops, incorporating two islets in the site. In 1604 the unfinished Pont Neuf was completed, and the Place du Pont Neuf followed soon afterwards. The charming Place Royale, now the\n\nPlace des Vosges, still remains—a square garden surrounded by aristocratic houses with a continuous arcade beneath their facades. A splendid scheme for a Porte and Place de France on the north of the city [7] was prepared under the king’s personal supervision, but was abandoned after his death.\n\nHis successor, Louis XIII, in 1635 laid out the Ile-Saint-Louis, hitherto occupied by meadows and gardens. The scheme consisted of fine houses and streets arranged on a gridiron pattern. Under Louis XIV, the Portes St-Denis (1672) and St-Martin (1674) were erected, the circular Place des Victoires (1684-6) and the Place Louis-le-Grand, now the Place Vendéme, were laid out\n\nto the glory of the king, and the Quai Malaquais (1670) was constructed. In : 1676, Louis ordered the city architect, Pierre Bullet (1639-1716), to prepare a complete plan of Paris, showing not only existing streets and buildings, but also new works in progress or projected. VII. THE BUILDING OF AMSTERDAM\n\nOne of the most remarkable examples of historical town-planning 1s the inner,\n\nand older, part of the city of Amsterdam (figure 199). The name explains the situation and origin of the city, for it recalls the construction of a castle and a dam on the little river Amstel in 1204, at the point where that stream flows into the Jj or Y, an inlet of the Zuider Zee. At the same time a sea-dike was built to | prevent inundation from the Ij. The first houses were erected east of the Amstel,\n\n294 TOWN-PLANNING FROM ANCIENT WORLD TO RENAISSANCE\n\nthen others followed on the west bank. The earliest defensive ditches (Voorburgwallen) were dug outside the new settlement in 1342 and were connected with the Amstel and the lj by sluices. The western ditch was filled in the nineteenth century, but the street which has replaced it is still called the Nieuwezijde Voorburgwal. A second line of ditches about 60 yd outside the Voorburgwallen, and known as the Singel (girdle), was dug in 1383, and was similarly controlled\n\nby sluices. Houses were then erected along the canals, on timber piles about 4o ft long. Further extensions followed in 1442, monasteries were established, ship-building and other industries appeared, and in 1481-2 the town was fortified\n\nwith towers for the first time. One of these, the Schreijerstoren, remains. In 1593 a more elaborate system of bastions was constructed, and a barrage was erected in the Ij to protect merchant-shipping. In 1610 began the remarkable and ambitious scheme of concentric extension which, in quadrupling the habitable area, produced Amsterdam’s unique plan. The new bastions completed in 1593 were demolished, a new canal (Heerengracht) replaced them, and two more canals (Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht) were dug parallel to it. A fourth canal\n\n(Singelgracht, 1658, 65 miles long) surrounded these three, with a new line of bastions. Small radial canals crossing the main concentric canals created a spider’s-web pattern. The planning of the outermost ring, between the Singelgracht and the Prinsengracht, was not, however, strictly radial. Except for an area reserved for artisan dwellings on the west, all the canals were lined with trees and with the handsome houses of the wealthier people. A park, the Plantage\n\n(since built over), was provided on the north-east; but, except for this public open space, the whole area was filled with houses by 1667. The b"
