Itk considered one of the reproaches of English fudniing that it is limited to few materials. In nms specialties they have great variety. In cooiferods trees for instance, English people noflick the globe, and give long Latin names to trifling varieties, to swell the importance of •reiy little form. So in Bhododendrons, and tbose fibrous rooting plants which thrive only in pofoos soil, and to which they give distinctively the names of \"American plants,\" of which they ^?e many forms under culture. But in decidu- OQs trees, shrubs and hardy border plants, one tees Uie same dozen or so of things over and ofer again. It is not quite so bad here in America. Very much more variety appears; but itin not near to the d^ree there might be. In ■ome grounds of extent we often see a hundred tvtts of one kind, when it would have been just as ^ to have had half a dozen kind», and this is ^ of shrubs and flowers. Much of this lack ^ Uriely in planting, no doubt, comes from 9Mitee that so much variety can be had. ^ftofen have not studied for themselves. I^yliave relied on the '' agent,'' who, in most CHBi^ takes bat a few things in hand, and which ke \"roshes.\" The \" agent\" or \" peddler.\" must Moeswtrily buy very cheap in order to cover the coonnous cost of board bills and traveling ex- penses, and it is only when things are common «umg^ to be raised in large quantities at a ^w figure, that the \" agent\" can take anything in hand. There are hundreds of good things in all the best nurseries which it will not pay to offer through \" agents\", and those who would have these charming things in great variety, should accustom themselves to personal relations with the nurseries, and to reading the best works. We hope that those who wish to have tasteful grounds, have kept notes the past year of the rarer trees and shrubs noted in our magazine from time to time, and that the forthcoming season of planting, will show increased attention to setting out these pretty things. CUMMUNICA TIONS. OARDEN SCIONS. BY CAKTAB, BOSTON, MASS.. m. When liue common goblets as flower^xueSf 1 put a cyme of spirsea, milfoil, elder, or the like, into the mouth of the goblet to fill it up, and into that I stick my bouquet blossoms in any fashion I choose. In this way I can make up a prettier bouquet than I can in a narrow-mouth vase. Sand-filled vases I do not like. Among Lantanas, L, Sellowiana, a squat and small growing species from Brazil, is the freest blooming kind I know of. Its blossoms are self- colored — lilac — and are borne in the greatest pro- fusion all the year round, outside in the sum- mer time and in the greenhouse in winter. Why we do not tue our wild plants in our gardens THE QARDENEK8 MONTHLY [January, more than we do hajs often puzzled me. Juat now the Indian turnips are brilliantly in fruit ; scarlet berries among the bushes are brighter than blossoms. Calceolaria aureoflcribunda has borne up brave- ly, and blossomed gayly with us this summer. The new strain of perennial larktpurs are an ex- cellent acquisition to our gardens; the blossoms are so large, so bright, and when double, so very double, and too they are arranged as densely as those of a hyacinth on the spikes. They are as hardy and as thrifty as the old-fashioned ones. As an August flowering plant, no garden should be without a clump of the white day lily. It is hardy, thrifty, copious, and will grow in shady places. Its flowers are fragrant and of the purest white. OARDEN NOTES AND 0088IP. BY UBB, R. B. EDSON, MELROSE, MASS. The readers of the Monthly may possibly re- member my note in the April number, on a plant bought under the name of Nicotiana sua- veolens, and the disappointment and disgust it entailed. I think it no more than an act of simple justice, both to the dealer who sends it out, and to the plant itself, that I give this year's experience as a sort of sequel — and a very pleas- ing one — to the last. The plant previously de- scribed I bought at the greenhouse, and I now conclude it was through the ignorance of the attendant that this plant, whatever it may have been, was sold to me. I resolved not to give up without another trial, and in March last bought a paper of seed, which was sown on the 17th inst., and was up on the 21st. As soon as the second pair of leaves were developed, I knew they were not like the one previously grown. I transplanted them to the open ground early in May, and the 10th day of June they bc^an dowering, and at this writing, Sept. 28, they are loaded with blooms. I am altogether delighted <with them. I think them by far the most de- sirable new annual which has been introduced for years. They are so easily grown, flower so soon and so continuously, and withal are so ex- tremely graceful in growth, and are so pretty, that I can unhesitatingly recommend them to all amateurs. They are of a peculiar pure, waxy- iwhite, averaging an inch and a quarter across, and the long, greenish-white tube adds to their beauty. At night they have a delicate and ex- quisite jasmine like fragrance, and being borne on long stems are particularly fitted for bouquet work. They combine finely with roses, lilies, fbchsias and other nice flowers, which so very few annuals do. I desire, through the Monthly, to thank W. L. F., Hanover, Mass., for his kind response to my dismal jeremiad, and for the generous thoughtfnlness which prompted the sending of seeds also. I received them May 18th, and sowed them the same day in the open ground. They came up quickly, and began flowering soon after the middle of July. I have a clump of about twenty plants, and I think there are not less than two hundred flowers on them now, and the number I have cut is past all reckoning. So fietr, I have not seen them advertised by any other seedsmen than Hovey & Co., Boston. I have grown this year some of the newer varieties of Cannas, those with large flowen, aa well as flne foliage. Among those particularly good is Imperator, a tall-growing sort, with very large dark red flowers. Ornement du Grand Roue, foliage edged and tinged with garnet and brilliant scarlet flowers ; not quite as large as the former, but more closely set on the spike. Bon- netta excelsa has lovely foliage, veined and shaded with violet, and, in the young leaves, having as decided a \"bloom'' as the grape; flowers orange-red. Princess de Niece and Gloire de Provence have fine canary-yellow flowers of large size. I have, however, left the best for the last, viz. : Iridifolia. This is a mag- niflcent canna. The foliage is ample — the leaves on mine measuring twenty-seven inches long by fourteen broad. But its great glory is its splendid flowers, which are fully equal in size to the best gladiolus. The color is a lovely shade of ca^ mine crimson, and the petals are so broad that the flower is almost round. One spike hss, at this writing, ten of these large, elegant flowers. The plant is not as tall-growing as some, but it the finest in flower I have yet seen. Will not, some other of the Monthly correspondents gi>d> a list of those they have found best in their ex- perience? In this connection I desire also to suggest some of the correspondents who have tried tb new coleus — Dreer's and Henderson's newse — report thereon. Are any of them fit for ding in full sunshine, and are the colors w kept, and do they \" look like their pictures (See Gardener's Monthly for March, 1880. And if any of them are good, what are tbei names. Also, which is best for inside decora tion? Will somebody speak to the question ? i \\m.] AND HORTICULTURIST. 8 Accepting the endorsement of the writer in M&rcb number, I sent to Mr. Saul for Acalypha Mactffeana. I received it early in May. It was tben about four inches high, and had a very con- romptive look. I looked at the description in the catalogue and in the Monthly, and then I looked at the plant! I could'nt make them \"dove-tail.'' It did not rally from the shock of removal for nearly a month, but then it went iteadOy and rapidly to work to redeem itself and it! sponsors. It has done both most royally. Tbe Mage is very bright throughout, and the Uoiches are unique and brilliant. I have now imoved it to my window garden, to which it is 10 odd and altogether charming addition. I Mir,Atthe September exhibition of the Mass. Horticultural Association, a fine specimen of Acalypha moeaica. It is a handsome sort, but not nearly as bright and showy as A. Macafieana. Before closing this rambling article, I desire to say just a word about that charming rose, \"La France.\" It was one among a dozen bought of Dingee & Gonard Co., this spring, and I am joit wild over it I know it is an ** old\" sort, but I greatly doubt if any of the new ones can sur- pm it in delicacy of texture and coloring, in w or form and fragrance. I consider it simply perfect I have picked off many buds, as I know it is a little tender, and I wish it well established for the winter, but it will persist in flowering. Another, as free a flowerer as La France, but of a brilliant velvety-crimson, I had under the name of \" Jean Tbibaud.\" I am not lore it is that It is not as dark as that repre- sented in descriptive catalogues. It is, however, a splendid rose, being fully five inches across, perfectly double to the centre, of globular form, and very fragrant. It has flowered all summer, and is also a good grower. The wood is very thorny, and every shoot forms a bud. I wonder if itcanbe \"JeanThibaud.\" I had not supposed that so ooDtinuous a bloomer. In closing I desire to thank the Monthly correspondents who replied to my inquiries concerning Eucharis amazonica. ^hdortonately they do not quite agree, but I hwi concluded, after weighing the testimony, ^ )f a professional florist does not succeed iu flonring it in a greenhouse, I should not very Hkely succeed with house culture. How very beautiful are the newer sorts of GrotonsI Among these at the Mass. Horticul- ton! Society's exhibition, I was particularly pleased with C. variabilis (Falcatus) and C. Qneen Victoria. The latter is certainly the most brilliantly colored plant I ever saw The ground color of the leaf is a rich golden yellow mottled with green, and the tinting and shading ot magenta and crimson is very beautiful. The first named is also extremely pretty, with its odd shaped leaves and unique coloring. DESTRUCTION OF TREES IN CITIES. BY R. C. POPPBY, POUQHKEEPSIE, N. Y. A year or more ago my attention was attracted to the frequent deaths of trees along our streets and avenues, and since have seen comments on it in our daily papers. These, like the Garden- er's Monthly, are satisfied that gas which es- capes from the main pipes is the cause. As reasonable and satisfactory as this might seem to the casual observer, I could not make myself believe it for several reasons, though I fail to be able to say definitely what the cause is. I am nevertheless convinced that it is not the gas. The lamentable account of Amhem Velperweg, if not exaggerated, is truly a sad one ; but in my opinion it is laughable to lay the cause to the dereliction of gas companies, and more so the remedy that they resorted to. The same, it ap- pears to me, ajB trying to rebuild a house while the old one is still burning. Since all mysteries are explained by theory till facts are reached, I think we have got to satisfy *ourselves with theory on this subject for a while. Whenever a tree dies on some thoroughfare, we wonder and ponder at the cause, but if we go through a woods and see as large and as handsome a tree die there, the cause suggests iteelf,— it simply got sick and now dies, that settles it at once. In my opinion, the gas theory ought to be the last one, until other theories have been tested and (jpund to be wrong. It is the one opinion all over the world, that if one plants a tree it ought to certainly outlive him by at least one hundred years. I asked the question : What right have we to expect every tree that is planted for some pur- pose, to reach the age of two hundred or five hundred years ? Who has assured us that trees which are planted for shade, are not susceptible to diseases the same as fruit trees, or roses? When young transplanted trees die, experience has taught us that it is mostly owing to careless planting, usually that of too deep. My observa- tion on nature leads me to believe that trees die in the same ratio as animals ; and a beautiful maple, or elm, on Fifth ave. is no safer than a shrub in the woods. From my investigation I THE GARDENERS MONTHLY, [January, <K>nclude that it is a kind of blight, a« every tree that died in our city in the last three years, first started by wilting on the top or side branches before going into eternal jcest Now if gas was the direct cause, it would certainly do its work quicker, and not wait until every leaf was de- veloped, and give three or four months grace besides. Who has traced the current of the gas as it leaks out of the pipes, to say positively that it goes just in the direction of one tree, a distance of fifteen or twenty feet, but spares the two trees on each side of it, which are often not more than six or eight feet away? A few years ago I read in some German horti- cultural monthly, that the cause of trees d3ring in cities, was owing to the gas light, which pre- vented them from going to sleep, that the con- tinual wakefulness told so severely on the nerv- ous system, that finally death resulted from it. This IB good logic too, but like the gas theory, it won't bear investigation. [Our correspondent is mistaken in taking the Gardener's Moitthly as a type of those papers which are satisfied gas at the roots is the cause of the \" frequent deaths of trees along our streets and cities.\" The Gardener's Monthly under- itands very well that trees die from various causes ; but that many trees do die from gas at the roots is a fact too welNknown to be disputed. We believe gas to be only one of the causes of the frequent deaths. — Ed. G. M.] GROUPING TREES ON LAWNS. BY PROF. W. A. BUCKHOUT, STATE COLLEGE, CENTRE CO., PA. In one of his \"Rural Essays,\" the late Mr. Downing has called attention to the opportunity which we have of grouping and arranging trees upon the lawn with some reference to their autumn coloring. He has remarked upon the great change which comes over a region of literal \"scrub oak and pine\" when the brightly colored leaves replace the dull green of summer. A recent application from a friend in California to send him \" some real autumn leaves, for we have here nothing to compare with those of the East,\" has called up the matter anew to my mind. Upon grounds of considerable extent, such as those of public institutions, a very pretty efiect can be produced by the difference in color dis- played by difierent trees in the autumn. Where tlie rich yellow, so commonly assumed by the . leaves of many of our deciduous trees, is pro- jected upon the deep green of a well fed lawn or the dark foliage of evergreens, the effect is ex- ceedingly fine, and will call out the admiration of any lover of the beautiful. Where there is a rising background, the variety and intermingling of colors may be very much increased. Our mountain sides would be very hard to excel in this respect^ but they show us something of our capabilities in this direction. Who is there who has traveled down the Susquehanna from Williamsport to Harrisburg during the first or second week of October, and has not marveled at the magnificent picture which is then pre- sented? On a somewhat smaller scale we can reproduce upon our grounds some of the bright spots in this picture. One great difficulty, however, consists in the fact that many of our brightest and most desirable trees retain their leaves but a very short time after they have changed. The purple of the ash is one of the earliest heralds of the change in season, and the color is unique; but the leaves drop and the tree is left quite bare long before many other trees have taken the first hint of the approach- ing winter. The white maple when growing vigorously, often shows the most beautiful lemon- yellow, but a very few days suffice for its display. It disappears as quickly as it came. The sugar maple is considerably better, for it holds its leaves much longer, and, moreover, they often assume a bright scarlet, which makes the tree one of the brightest ornaments of our autumn days. We have a few trees which hold their leaves so persistently, and change so gradually, that the period of conspicuous display is pro- longed late enough to suggest that these qualities should make them of increased value in orna- mental planting. Of such trees I would name the red oaks, which color slowly, but finally take a deep red. which is very effective in contrast with green. As seen naturally, they are very often intermingled with the pitch and white pines, and this suggests that they might be used in planting much more abundantly and efifec- tively than is ordinarily done. Each year I become more and more in love with the Norway maples for large grounds. In- dividual trees vary a good deal in their behavior and in the color assumed (a fact more or lees true and noticeable in all trees), but the general course with them is to hold the deep green of their leaves pretty late; then comes the faint 1881.1 AND HORTICULTURIST. tindog of the tips of the twigs, which spreads more and more until the tree looks like a moun- tain top glistening in the sunshine, while every- thing about ito base lies in shadow ; more and more the gold encroaches on the green, and at length a golden ball it stands out a marked oiject in any company. With favorable weather (which we are apt to have at about this time), it majhold its leaves in this condition for two weeb or more. When the heavy frosts come, we find the leaves dropping rapidly as the cool monuDg air is heated by the ascending sun, and liwBid a strong wind come, they are caught up and scattered in long, streaming lines over the tot forming a very pretty picture to the looker- 00 from a little distance. Thus the beauty of its autumn foliage amply atones for a certain itiffiiesB of outline and habit, and the globular figore which this maple is so apt to assume. I believe this feature in ornamental planting worthy of more attention, especially in those {daces where from the size of the grounds, the rdation of surrounding highland or natural growth, and the variation of the surface, large BomberB of trees are required, and considerable vtriety is needed. DIANTHU8 HEDDEWIOII. BY T. B. PRICE, KINOSBURO, CAL. This is one of the most beautiful of all the perennials. Of this species there are several ▼arieties, of which H. diadematus and H. laci- Biatds are the most important; these are the reniltB of hybridization. H diadematus is a ▼oy prolific bearer of flowers, many times hav- iogfrom thirty to forty flowers upon it at a time ; ^beM flowers usually about three inches in diam- eter, are very rich in color, varying from white V) a very dark maroon. H. laciniatus is also a pKiBflc bearer, and occasionally reaches two feet in height; this flower, like the diadematus, ^\"ieifrom very light to very dark. The plants *• very beautiful, and merit a place in every *Nr-garden ; they may with a little extra care, ^md as a house plant.

ORNAMENTING OUR HOMES. BY JAMES M. HAY£8, DOVKR, N. H. There has been a marked improvement in our country homes within the past few years, al- though there is still abundant room for more. A few years ago no such thing as a flower garden was to be seen on the farms of New England, now they are to he met upon more than one- half the farms, although there are still those that are so penurious that they think that time spent by the farmer's wife or daughter in making and weeding a flower garden, is time thrown away. I have in my mind a farmer's wife who is fond of her flower garden and will work out of season to make it succeed. I know another lady who thinks all such work thrown away, and that it would he much better to have the same garden planted with some vegetable that would yield an income. In fact she believes that every thing should go to increase the bank stock. Our New England poet Wbittier speaks of this class of farmers as they were two generations ago in his prelude to the poem, \"Among the Hills,\" after speaking of their rooms and grounds bare of adornment, he gives them the following sarcastic hit, which is an apt description of the •* close fisted\" Yankee farmer of half a century ago. \"Saving his soul and winter pork with the least possible outlay of salt and sanctity.\" But a change has come over the people since then. The difl*usion of knowledge by means of the agricultural newspaper, and 6uch horticultural works as the GARDBNBa's Monthly, has been felt ; and to day you will find some of as good horti- culturists amongst the farmers as anywhere. And they have only to work on and imitate the example set by such workers as Hovey and the venerable Col. Wilder, and our New England hillsides will be the pride of the whole country. EDITORIAL NOTES. Lily CaLTURE.— It is now believed that the disease of the lily and gladiolus, by which they lose their leaves before they are mature, arises from the hot soil in which they are grown. There is but little doubt that if the soil be well mulched, lily growing would be more of a success. Varibqated C0RCHORU8. — Variegated plants have generally a diseased look, and are not favorites in American gardens ; but some bushes of the Kerria japonica variegata, that we saw 6 THE QARDENER'8 MONTHLY [January, last summer, impressed us very favorably with its value in ornamental gardening. EvEROBEENB IN M188OUIU. — DuHug a receut journey through northeastern Missouri, the writer noted some interesting experiments on the grounds of the University at Columbia, Mo., under Prof. Hussman's care, in r^^rd to ever- greens, and indeed other trees, the result being that trees with numerous surfiace fibres, such as hemlock spruce and Norway maple, did not suc> ceed nearly as well as those species which were deep rooting. Of course this fact will require more care in transplanting, as trees with a few long sprawly roots never move as easily as those with an abundance of fibres. The deep rooting trees seem better able to stand the heats and droughts of summer, and the excessive evapora- tion from high wintry winds than the others. PuBUC Park at Lynchburg. — The citiiens of this beautiful Virginia city are moving in the matter of a public park. Pampas Grass Flowering.— While passing through St. Louis recently, and visiting the Missouri Botanic Garden of Mr. Henry Shaw, the writer was much interested in some Pampas Grass pointed out by Mr. Gerney, the gardener. A quantity had been kept during the winter of 1879-80 rather warm, while the others had been in complete rest. The well rested ones flowered freely the past summer, while the others flow- ered but little. Such facts as these are of great value. Painted Cups— The London Florist and P<h vnologitlf for November, has a beautiful colored plate of Castilleja indivisa, one of the ** Painted Cups \" of the Western States. Though partially a root parasite, they have discovered in England how to grow it. Mistletoe in Nurseries. —Mr. Richard Smith, of Worcester, England, propagates the mistletoe so easily on apple trees, that they are furnished as abundantly from his nurseries as Kilmarnock Willows from others. They are said to be in good demand. N£JV AND RARE PLANTS, The Yellow CLEMATis.—The Amerioixn Agri- ouUuritt says this belongs to the flamula group, and says its flowers — something remarkable among these plants — are vellow. The plant is ra- ther slender and delicate, having less robust stems, than the other climbers. The foliage, of a fresh and pleasing green, is more finely cut than in the other species, each leaf consisting of three to %.ve sharp-pointed leaflets which are themselves cut or lobed. The flowers are solitary, of only four spreading sepals, and are about 1} in. across ; their color is a pale lemon-yellow. This plant, coming from the higher mountains of Chinese Tartary, is a comparatively recent intro- duction. As may be inferred from its origin, it has proved perfectly hardy in the severe climate of New England, and this, together with its delicate habit, it^ very free growth, and the un- usual color of its abundant flowers, will make it very popular when it becomes better known. It blooms in late summer, and its flowers are aoon succeeded by globular clusters of fruits, the long feathery tails to which are of a s&ry pale g^een, and about as showy as the flowers. It is Cle- matis gravedens botanically. Carpenteria Caufornica— Mr. John Saul has sent to the (kvrden specimens of this plant, which says of it : '' It is an extremely rare plants even in its native habitat; so rare, indeed, that Dr. Asa Gray had not seen flowers of it when he prepared the 'Botany of California,' nor do flowers of it exist in the Kew Herbarium. As may be seen by the annexed engraving, drawn natural size, it is a handsome shrub, the flowers being pure white with yellow-tipped stamens. The leaves are broadly lance shaped of thick texture with recurved margins ; they are pale green on the upper surfaces, very glaucous or almost white underneath. Mr. Saul remarks that it grows from six to fifteen feet in height and is very bushy. It grows in dry canons near springs in the Sierra Nevada, probably on the head waters of the San Joaquin. Botanists consider its affinity to be with the Mock Orange (Phila- delphus), but, with the exception of a slight sim- ilarity in the form and color of the flowers, it is very difierent from any. cultivated Mock Orange from a garden standpoint SCRAPS AND QUERIES. Sterculia platanifolia.— H. S., Raleigh, N. C, sends with a specimen of this, the following : \" Enclosed I send you a leaf and a seed from a tree of which I have seen a few growing in thia place.

Window plants suffer much at this season Irom the high and dry temperature at which it is necessary for human comfort to keep our filings. Air can seldom be admitted from the iWneas of the external temperature. Saucers of water under the plants do much to remedy the aridity under which room plants suffer. In soch cases, however, so much water must not be given to plants as to those without saucers. The wster is drawn up into the soil by attraction ; tod though the surface will appear dry, they will be wet enough just beneath. The more freely a plant is growing, the more water it will require ; and the more it grows, the more sun and light will it need. In all cases, those which seem to grow the fastest should be placed nearest the light. The best aspect for room plants is the south-east. They seem like iDimals in their affection for the morning sun. The first morning ray is worth a dozen in the weoing. Should any of our fair readers find W plants, by some unlucky calculation, frozen »the morning, do not remove them at once to Aiirm place, but dip them in cold water, and «t them in a dark spot, where they will barely «cq)e freezing. Sunlight will only help the frwt'g destructive powers. It is not exactly the season for re-potting gen- wrily ; but anything that is about to grow, and ■wms cramped for room may have a shift. This « the rule in plant-growing; for if we re-pot th«i the roots are inactive, the water is not I drawn as rapidly from the soil as it should be, and then it sours, and injures the roots. The best kind of earth to use is the surface soil, containing the spongy mass of surfiace roots, from a wood ; the first two inches of an old pas- ture field, the turfy, spongy mass called peat, from sandy bogs or swamps ; a little well de- cayed hot bed manure ; some sharp sand ; are now about the only \" elements \" that the most skillful gardener cares to have beside him ; and many a good gardener has to find himself minus some of these, and be satisfied. The soil for potting should be used rather dry ; that is, it should be in such a condition that it will rather crumble when pressed, than adhere closer together. Large pots — those over four inches, — should hava a drainage. This is made by breaking up broken pots to the size of beans, putting them in the bottom a quarter or half an inch deep, and putting about an eighth of an inch of old moss, or any similar rough material, over the mass of \" crocks \" to keep out the earth from amongst it. Little benefit arises from draining pots below four inch, the moisture fil- tering through the porous pots quite fast enough ; and the few pieces of \"drainage \" often thrown in with the soil placed right over, is of little or no use. It will still be severely cold in many districts where our magazine circulates; though in the \" sunny South '' the roses are almost in bloom. For the benefit of these belated ones we may remark that it is better to keep in heat in cold weather by covering, where possible, than to allow 8 THE QARDBNEKS MONTHLY [January, it to escape, calculating to make it good by fire- heat, which is, at best, but a necessary evil. Where bloom is in demand, nothing less than 56^ will accomplish the object; though much above that is not desirable, except for tropical hot-house plants. Where these plants are obliged to be wintered in a common greenhouse, they should be kept rather dry, an 1 not be encouraged much to grow, or they may rot away. COMMUNICA 7 IONS. FRAGMENTARY RECOLLECTIONS OF DRAGON TREES. BY WILLIAM T. HARDING, \" OAK HILL \" CBMiSTERY, UPPER SANDUSKY, OHIO. The fine specimen of that rare old plant, Dracsena fragrans, of which the editor gave a pen picture in a late '* Monthly,\" would do one good to see. That it is both rare and old, cannot | be denied. Since its advent in England, in the ' year 1768, it has grown old in the service of or- namentation ; but, is no less beautiful now than | it was in other days. It is much to be regretted it has become so rare, and seldom seen. Whether its gracehil and comely form has been over- looked among the crowds of modern beauties, which fascinate with their newer charms, I hardly know. Yet it seems improbable I should have failed to see and recognize such an old acquaintance, if it had been where it ought to be. So I am led to consider it is a stranger among its more showy, though less odoriferous compeers. Even if out of sight, when in flower, its odor is so sweet and seductive, as ''to lead by the nose,\" and softly decoy willing captives to inhale the sweet breath of its blooms. So exqui- sitely delicious is its rich aroma, as to vie with the sweet olive, the violet, or rose. The last one I remember having seen was at Mr. Buist's. in Philadelphia, several years since. As I confess to being a lover of Dracsenas, the old attachment seems to carry me back to Syd- ney, New South Wales, the land of sunshine and flowers, where many years ago I saw them in all their glory. From the Government domain to the noted Botanic Qarden of Sydney, is a very pleasant stroll, beneath the big gum trees, araucarias and palms. And few there are who having any love for nature, or \" the art of man,\" who will omit the opportunity to wander among and enjoy. To the writer, the aesthetic associations of the v^;e- table kingdom are always pleasing. And while at the antipodes, he duly enjoyed the privilege of inspecting the vast botanical collection, which the intelligent government of that remote and remarkable land so well and wisely cared for. While thus engaged, my attention was drawn to the noble monumental obelisk — sacred to the memory of the unfortunate Mr. Allan Canning- ham, so properly placed among the trees, shrabe and flowers, he sufiered and died for. Alas! poor fellow, his date was a sad one. While par suing his researches in the interest of science, as botanical attache to Sir Thomas Mitchell's ex- ploring expedition in 1835, he was cruelly mur- dered by the treacherous savages, on the bank of the Bogan river. The singular conifera Can- ninghamii lanceolata, named in honor of tbe niartyr, was fittingly planted near by. Among the many curious, useful and beautiful plants he first presented to an appreciative pab- lie, I will mention but three, and which lUl good gardeners ought to know, namely : Araucaria Ounninghamii, Fagus Cunninghamii, and Steoo- carpus Cunninghamii. In good taate, these peculiar trees, with others he discovered, had been planted by loving hands, adjacent to the memento mori of the noble man. But, O ye gods! what are the odors which ascend firom the altar of Flora, and float around the silent monolith in the garden ? Ce- lestial zephyre pervade the atmosphere, and the ethereal balm savored strongly of flowers. Fol- lowing my olfactory guidance, but a few steps from where I stood, I discovered the floral labo- ratory, which distilled the delicate and subtile perfume. A large clump of Dracsena fragrans told the tale of the odorous grove. Dracsenas are all elegant hot-house plants, easily cultivated. They thrive best in good, rich loam, with a little sand and decayed cow-dang added. Occasional applications of manure water decidedly improves them. Of some varieties, the leaf markings are truly magnificent ; while all are in some degree beautiful. The curious old Dragon tree, Dracesna Draco, which was grown in England as far back as 1640, and which used to be one of the eurios of the conservatory, has almost ceased to be seen now- a-days. It makes a good match to mate with agaves, and such like things, to grow in vases, for hall decoration during the winter, and lawn or terrace ornamentation in the summer. At Cape Town Botanical (hardens. South Af- rica, I saw it, with other kinds, growing from 1881.] AND HORTICULTURIST. thirty to forty feet high. From it, D. Draco, the oommercial drug known as gum dragon, is pre- pared ,* while the roots of D. terminalis are said to potMBS medicinal properties. In the island of Tenerifife is a huge and gro- lesqae specimen, supposed to he the oldest tree io the world. This wonderful tree is described bytnvelers as a vegetative monstrosity, whose exktence counts some thousands of years. Taking them all together, they are plants of nohle mien, of gorgeous garb, and stately port, and ought to be found in all choice collections vbere grand and goodly plants are grown. ORCHIDS. BY W. a , CINaNNATI, OHIO. There is now at this date, November 24tb, a q>)eDdid variety of the scarce Orchid, Oncidium Emnmerii, in flower in the new and rare plant boQieiof the Cincinnati Floral Company's es- tabliabmeut. College Hill. Ohio, which is worth a long joomey to see. It resembles a large but* taifly, with its wings expanded, resting upon the «d ef a flower spike, about twenty-four inches long. It is of a dark yellow color, beautifully Notched with brown. The plant is growing in tpot^with rough peat and sphagnum, with plenty of water in its growing season. There is also a fioe specimen growing upon a block of wood n^Moded from the roof, in most robust health. \"Hwre is also a very fine plant of Cypripedium Huriiiannm in flower ; also Oncidium pulvina- tom, with its long spikes of beautiful yellow eolor flowers, quite a charm at this dull season (rf the year. . Also in fine condition good pitnts of the beautiful Dendrobium Wardianum uid Odontoglossum vexillarium ; O. cirrhosum, vith flower spikes; Oncidium incurvum, just (oQUDg into flower ; Lelia anceps, flower spikes <imte three feet long ; also grand plants of the ««ceaiid beautiful Cattleya Mendelii, Cymbid- wn ebomeum. Dendrobium bigibbnm. This »* dwarf-growing plant, producing racemes of ^ porple flowers, and will continue to throw ^i(ikes from the same stem for several sue- 5*** years, and requires plenty of water in ^ffttwing season. I must mention a very fine P^ftod one that should be in every collec- ^»od that is Oncidium macranthum. It is V^*^^ suspended from the roof, and one of ^ most handsome of the Oncidiums. IWe is also in fine condition Cattleya Mos- \"«. C Trian«, C. Leopoldi. C. guttata, Chysis bractescens. the beautiful Disa grandiflora, Sac- colabium Blumei, Oncidium Weltoni. Growing in the same house is a very fine specimen of Nepenthes Dominiana, quite five feet high, fuH| of its beautiful pitchers; also N. Hookeriana,> N. Bafflesiana, N. rubra, N. Sedeni, N. Chelsoni, N. intermedia. These plants are growing in baskets suspended from the' roof. The Cincin- nati Floral Company finds these plants require a liberal supply of water all the year round. This etitablifthment is also noted for its fine col- lection of new plants, in which stands the new Sarracenia crispata and Sarracenia flava ornata, both handsome plants, of the striking form of the side saddle flower. Philodendron Carderi, quite new ; also Diefienbachia Leopol- dii, D. splendens, with a host of new Crotons, and other plants. This enterprising Company is making great additions in all these plant de- partments for the coming year. PETER HENDERSON CARNATION. BY NANZ A NEUNER, LOUISVILLE, KY. In reply to the article published in your last number about \" P. H.*' Carnation, would say that if the flower of the carnation, \" P. H.\" is cut at the proper time and handled correctly afterwards, it will keep five days and longer in a salable condition. We maintain every point we mentioned in our circular issued two years ago. For trial, <&c., we expressed flowers to New York ; had the same box with contents ex* pressed back to us, the flowers being on the road five days, and still they looked well, and could be used. We further claim that this carnation does even better in Eastern States and brings a heav- ier crop than here, owing to difierence in cli- mate. This is our experience. THE OX-EYE DAISY. BY O. J. POPPEY, P0UGHKEEP8IE, N. Y. In one of the back numbers of the Monthly a timely warning was published against Convol- vulus arvensis. It may not be amiss to extend this warning to the Ox-eye daisy, as it is no less a pernicious weed than the Convolvulus arvensis. Besides, it is now destined to rapidly become a general object over our fields and meadows throughout the country, on ac-count of its flow- ers being introduced in the floral trade. I no- ticed that some of our New York seedsmen have 10 THE OARDENER'S MONTHLY [January, upon their seed papere the name \"Ox-eye Baiay,\" meaning the French daisy— a different plant altogether ; this undoubtedly leads many |ieople to the belief that it really means the common wild ox-eye daisy ; the seed of which is also very fine, and can be easily sent in a letter to a friend, and in this way facilitate the speedy distribution 6f this troublesome weed to extraordinary growth they made in so short a time was astonishing ; the roses, however, did not suffer any, as the crop was unusually large and of superior quality.

Ill a recent visit to Tower Grove Park, St. Louis, we were pleased to find the cool boose, erected a few years ago, a great success.

Floriculture in Louisvillk. — The Omrier Journal has recently been giving a history of gardeDing about Louisville. The first profes- lional florist was £dward Wilson. He came ihtm in 1836, and retired in 1860 to Geo. Wal- ker. He has now nine greenhouses and seven acxee of ground. Frank Litchfield commenced in 1865. He has five greenhouses. Henry Nanz is the oldest living florist. His first greenhouse was bailt in 1850. In 1874 he went into partner- ship with Mr. Neuner. They have twenty- eight greenhouses and thirty acres. Francis Morat began in 1856. He has twelve greenhouses. In 1866, Ross & Remper started, who were soon bought out by Anton Lauer. He has eleven greenhouses and fifteen acres. B. F. Rudy thirty years ago was an amateur, but sold out ^ establishment. Recently he has started as a fcriit, and has now three houses. Charles Rom- ptt began again in 1872. He has six houses. bl877, Jacob Schultz commenced. He has now te greenhouses. Mary A. Schwarz is one of tbe oldest flower growers, and has four green- hmiee. The House of Refuge has a commer- <^ greenhouse, worked by the inmates. Thir- teen imall firms are named which have one or more greenhouses. Outside the city limits are Qomerous scattering firms. Those named are George Thompson, 1878, fifteen greenhouses, and W. Allen Richardson, 1877, but now with fourteen houses. Mr. Richardson was the first to build a house for roses exclusively, in Louis- ville. Chrysanthemums akd Roses— At the No- vember meeting of the New York Horticultural Society, Tea roses and Chrysanthemums were the chief articles in competition. The Value of Obchids.— Orchids are so diffi- cult to propagate extensively that large plants bring good prices. At a recent sale by auction of a good private collection in England over $10,000 were realized. The plants brought from $100 to $300 each. Killing Insects by Coal Oil. — A correspon- dent of the Oardeners* Record says: \"Take four gallons of warm water, dissolve in it one ounce of soft soap, add a wineglassful of paraffin, thor- oughly mix by drawing the syringe full and dis- charging it with force into the vessel, and to keep it well mixed while using, discharge two syringefuls into the vessel, fill again as qwiokly as possible and discharge on the plant; paraffin varies in strength, so if this does not prove effec- tual try it stronger. I have not found a quarter of a pint to four gallons of water hurt roses.\" It should be remarked that undiluted oil will injure plants as well as destroy insects, and therefore the directions to \"draw the syringe and dis- charge again '' in the barrel, so as to well mix, is important, otherwise the oil will swim to the surface, and the syringe will draw in too much oil and too little water. NEJV AND RARE PLANTS, Tuberous Rooted Begonias. — There have few more rapid advances in floral progress than in the improvement of tuberous rooted Begonias, since the B.

Many have blossomed, and are promising to make a valuable lot.\" It is so easy a matter to take the pollen from one kind to the pistil of another kind, and the result new varieties, with possibly one that may I make the raiser famous, that it is worth all the I labor to try. 14 THE GARDENER^S MONTHLY IJanuwy, Fruit and Vegetable Gardening. SEASONABLE HINTS. One of the troubles of a beginner in fniit growing is to decide on what varieties to plant. It is just here that no writer of seasonable hints can help him. Varieties which do well in one place will not in another, so that the best kinds are matters of actual experience. It is wise to consult with some fruit grower in the vicinity who has already had experience. But, of course, this will not hold good as to new kinds which few have tried. Somebody has to begin. It is per- haps better to let those make the trial who have already had some experience. They have an instinctive idea as to what '' may do/' and hence rarely make serious mistakes. But after all there has been this knowledge gained of late years, that fruits are not near as local in their preferences as they were once supposed to be. That they are tender, or do not do well in some places, often arises more from diseased or weak- ened plants being used than from constitutional incompetence. It was in this way it once came to be believed that only two or three varieties of grapes could be grown in the United States. \" Plant only the Concord \" came to be an uni- versal cry. Now we know that the steam hatched plants in some established houses which had an immense grape trade, scattered plants with Phylloxera on the roots over the whole country. It was this minute insect, and not the \" tender kind,\" which rendered the grape diseased. Now since grape vines are grown from the start in the open air, and the little pest has not the chance to get everywhere distributed, almost any native kind can be fairly grown. It is the same with the raspberry, strawberry and blackberry. It is minute insects or small parasitic plants which weaken their growth, and these are carried from place to place until fiifally the whole variety is pronounced \" tender '* or \" worthless f and it is this fact which gives a necessity for raising new varieties, as it takes some time for these little foes to get on roots, which start clear of them as a seedling does. It is strange how a disease sticks to a variety after it once gets hold. Let a strawberry bed once have spotted leaves, and it is not safe to take runnen from those beds. If the same kinds are desired, better get them from some one who can warrant them free from spot. If this cannot be done, it is time to raise a new kind from seed. In getting ready for spring vegetables do not fear to pile on the manure. It is the rank rich growth which gives the agreeable tenderness to them, and without an abundance of manure this cannot be done. Deep soil is also a great ele- ment of success. Though we do not favor sub* soiling and underdraining for fruit trees, we re- gard it as very profitable in vegetable growing. Asparagus beds may have the soil raked off them a little, if it was thrown up from the alley- way in the fisill. It allows the sun to get to the roots earlier, and the crop is forwarded thereby. If the beds are poor, they may have a dressing of guano, or superphosphate, which has been found very beneficial to this crop. It has become almost a stereotyped recommendation to have \" salt applied,'' but there is a good deal of the humbug about it In dry, sandy soils it does a little goed, and a little in whatever manure is applied is acceptable to them, but more has been made of the salt theory with Asparagus than it deserves. Asparagus beds may be got ready as soon as the ground is sufficiently dry to admit of working. A deep soil is all-important ; two feet, at least, and a situation should be chosen that is warm, and yet not too dry. The roots should be set about four inches under the surface, twenty inches or two feet from each other, and the rows eighteen or twenty inches apart. Large, fine Asparagus cannot be obtained by crowding the plants ; strong two and three year old plants are the best ; although in good, rich soil, one y old plants will often bear a good crop the y< ailer planting. The length of time Aspangut requires to come into bearing depends much o the soil. It is useless to attempt raising it in ground. This is generally supposed to be the pruni season.

B., FBEDBRIGKTOK, NEW BRUNSWICK. Ihia seems to be the leading topic in recent nomberB. It is true great men and things have had small beginnings. That Indiana English gardener has stirred up a hornet's nest, and some of them may be spiteful enough to sting if he does not look out. Well, I for one rather ad- mire his spirit For let it be known to Mr. HmdeiBon, or any son of American birth, vhen he puts John Bull down as an old fogy, he tOQches every true Englishman's person. We will admit there are plenty there like the one he re- fen to, and I question very much if we could not find some American fogies. Mr. Henderson may »7 1 did not call John a \" fogy,\" but he says whit is equally as bad. John Bull did not bow or had not found out in 1872 how to pul- ▼sriie his soil, yet he says John Bull, No. 2, liQghed heartily at his benighted metropolis DNghbor digging or delving. Well, I say, this \"English gardener,\" by opposing Mr. Henderson ftHttle, caused him to write a better letter than cne might expect, and in a reasonable and gen- tesnly manner. But still let us, as unpreju- fad readers and tillers of the soil, not condemn htmth or fikcts, for the •* English gardener\" ^i^t in saying that American florists cannot bwt everything about gardening in England. I ^Qidantand him to mean that the American is ^^gether opposite to the English climate. The teff is oool and moist, the former dry and hot, so te nature soon prepares the soil for the Ameri- ^ husbandman, while John Bull must wait P>tieiittj and oftentimes work in a different way ^ IMe Sam, cmd tn soim coMn tits different meann. Again, I think John goes in too much for outward appearance, to please the eye rather than fill his pockets. I have reference to horti- culture or floriculture. Sam must do his work in a rougher or quicker way ; labor being high^ must move on faster ; his object, not pleasure but profit. Habit b a wonderful power. It is hard to shake it; any reasonable person will acknowledge this. So with John Bull, or any other Bull. What a man has been educated to has a tendeney to cling to him. Yet we all ought to have common sense enough to be open to conviction or reason. It is not the ob- ject of the readers of the Gabdeneb's Monthly to throw stones at each other, but follow science or facts, which are stubborn things to get over ; I might say we do not want to get over them, but abide by them. We only want to \"get over\" those that are \"married to their own opinion/' in spite of the fia^ts. And if John Bull did not know how to pulver- ize his soil until Mr. Henderson told him in 72, he certainly lived a long time to know very little. MARKET CARDENINO. BY JOHN QUNN, WHITINSVnXE, BCA8S. In an article on page 162, of the June number of the Gabdeneb's Monthly, regarding market gardening by Peter Henderson, the natural in- ference would be that the difference in the cost of products in London and New York was attri- butable to the difference in the mode of cultiva- tion. He says John Bull has not learned in 1872 that the plough and harrow will pulverize the soil better than the spade. I have no de- fence for the spade, as I never did like it, and have not done much with it since my apprentice- ship. I think by a few facts I can throw a little light upon the subject. On page 837, he makes some statements with which I fully concur. He says he found it was the rule rather than the ex- ception, in districts away from London, that the plough was the implement used. When Mr. Henderson was at Edgewiare road, if he had gone about four miles to the south, or to Bainham, Essex county, he would have found the produce being carried to market by highway locomotives, and the ground ploughed by steam ploughs. I have seen at that place a field of ten acrei ploughed, planted, and the field left in fine con- dition, in one day. That the spad^ and fork are used in some small market gardeps is true, but the spade gardeners do not fix or control the 16 THB GARDEnatS MONTHLY [Jftouiiy, price of produce. I think there are other rea- fons than the mode of cultivation for produce being cheaper in New York than in London. I am impressed with the belief that the difference bi rent has an important bearing upon the mat- lier. I know of one man at Ashford, Middlesex county, fourteen mDes from London, who holds one hundred acres, and for each acre he pays £7 per year. He is a spade gardener, the only one that I know of in that vicinity, and I have for- merly known many. This man was amasnng a fortune; his land was set with fruit trees in rows about twenty-five feet apart, and between crop- ped with beans, beets, lettuce, parsley, violets and strawberries. I have endeavored to show that our cousins across the water are not so much behind us in their adoption of improve- ments as many would suppose. But there is ample chance for improvements, both in Eng- land and this country, and probably always will be. FRUIT FOR KANSAS. BY BOBfiBT MnjJKSN, SMFOBU, KANSAS. In the November number of the Momthlt, Just to hand, \"T. R., Chanute, Kansas,*' inquires ^'Whai kind of apples, pears, plums and cherries will thrive beet in this locality?\" Let me say to T. R that he can get a perfectly reliable answer to that question by calling on Mr. James Truitt, Captain 0. W. Ashby, or Dr. Bailey, banker, all old residents and experienced growers of these fruits, in that locality. If T. R. will send one dollar, with his address, to Q. C. Brackett, Secretary Kansas State Horti- cultural Society, Lawrence, Kansas, for a copy of the Society's last report, he will not only find the information he calls for, but much other in- formation upon the horticultural interests of the State worth many times the money to him if he locates in the State. In this report he will find that the Society has given the following list as the one to be relied upon, as far as the experience of orchardists of the State in the past have proved : Apple$'-8\\xmtner, 5 varieties.— Barly Harvest, American Sum. Fearmain, Carolina Bed June, Bed Astracan, Early Fennock. Autumn, 5 varie- ties.—Maiden's Blush, Fall Wine, Fameuse, Bambo, Lowell.

Among the benefits now being realised by the intreduction of the excellent American lawn mowers, is one I wish to call attention to as capable of perhaps a laige extension. I mean the use of the mower among fruit trees and grapevines. I have observed that fruit as well as orna- mental trees, after they are well established, do remarkably well upon lawns frequently mown, so that the grass never becomes long, and the mowings are left to shade and enrich the soil These are the trees which people usually refer to when they claim that fruit trees do beet in graai. Trees so situated, or growing in pastured lands, are under entirely difierent conditions for pro- ducing fine growth and fine fruit from those growing where a hay or grain crop of full sised and mature plants is grown among the trees and over their feeding roots. Acting upon this observation, I have the past season seeded down and mown the grass betweeoi two of my trellises of specimen grape vines; the alternate space is still cultivated. The space, mown gives access upon clean turf to one fide of each trellis, so that all the fruit can be visited^ without soiling a lady's shoe. There is as yet^ not the least sign of deterioration in vigor of vine or quality of fruit from thia treatment^ and^ of course, this one-half lawn might be oon* tinued indefinitely by manuring the other or cultivated fpace. I intend to experiment carefully in this mat* ter and see if it is not practicable to secure the* beauty of the lawn, along with the fertility oH 1881.J AND HORTICULTURIST.

Mr. Rivers' ideas are well appreciated in the transplanting of an oft-removed tree. It is th» root-pruning it has received which makes it so safe to transplant* and this is but one instance off the advantage of root-pruning. Dandklions. — ^There are few more delicious salad plants in early spring than blanched dande* lion leaves, and it is remarkable that they ar» not more used. The roots can be dug in autumi^ and put in boxes of earth. A very little warmth in a partially shady place brings the crisp leavea forward. A correspondent of the Qardener'm Chronicle has recently noted that the roots and growing leaves are much relished by horses in early spring, and that they seem to act medicU nally on them to great advantage. • DiRXcroR Alphand Pbar.— -The Rewue HortU ooU of Paris, figured this Pear in its Sep. 15th issue, where it is represented as of enormous size, five and a half inches long by four and a half wide, larger than the finest Duchess d'Angoulemo. It is said to possess the general characters of the Doyenne d'Hiver, and in aspect to resemble Belle Angevine. It is also said to be \"very sweety with an aroma sui generis^ It \"is good to eat in the month of February, but will keep ta April'' in France. Its origin is not stated. Thb Currant Caterpillar.— The gooseberry and currant caterpillars are great pests to Americ can fruit growers. The following recipe for dealing with these pests is given by a County Down subscriber U^ the \" Garden,\" and which he states he had used there thirty years, and never failed with it until 1879, when the daily rain washed the salt off the leaves before it had time to dry or act on the* young caterpillars. Mix 1 lb. of common salt with 8 gallons of cold water, but be careful nol to exceed that quantity. About the second week in May, or as soon as perforated leaves are ob* served, choose a dry day and syringe the bushes with this mixture. Repeat the syringing in a week or ten days should more perforated leavea appear. This mixture^ though destructive to young caterpillars, will not kill old ones ; these must be hand-picked. Asparagus in France. — Accustomed as we are to simple methods of culture, the trouble some people take in other parts of the world seems almost incomprehensible. Here for instanca 18 THE GARDENER' 8 MONTHLY [Janaarj, ia the aooount which a fiiinous grower in Ar- geuteuil, France, gives of hia method : \" The asparagus plants must he planted near the surfiEuse of the soil, contrary to the general custom ; and, also contrary to the general prac- tice, they should also he planted wide apart They must he earthed up in spring to have them tender and white. Earthing up is abso- lutely necessary, not only from a culinary point of view, but as a natural protection for the shoots, and to prevent the Asparagus from being blown over by the wind. That is the object fulfilled by fthe mound of earth in the culture of asparagus. Afterwards, when the leaves appear, it is neces- sary to tie the asparagus to stakes. This protec- tion is of great importance, for when the wind knocks over the asparagus it breaks and splits their stems, so that there is no hope of saving «them.\" Imagine our people staking up asparagus I We fancy that with all the care g^ven in France, *.Dnr American article will surpass it. Amesicak Apples in London.— The Oardener's HLdgasvM says : — American apples are now being landed at Liverpool in large quantities.

The ruling prices are : Newtown Pippins, 25e. to SOs. ; Greenings, 9s. toll2B. ; Baldwins, lOs. 6d. to 16s. ; Kings, 12s. to 18s., and Spitz, 12b. 6d. to 16s. per barrel. The Napoleon Weepino Cherry. — At a recent meeting of the Fruit Growers' Association of Ontario, Mr. Dougall, of Windsor, exhibited a photograph of a very handsome weeping cherry, 4ind states in his letter that the origin of the weeping variety was a side shoot from the stem •of a Napoleon cherry, that grew out below the ■graft and bent down to the ground. Some trees were budded from the shoot, one of which being worked up high grew to be quite a large tree, the others being budded at the ground never could be got to grow into a tree. The one from which the photograph was taken was budded subsequently at nearly six feet high, and shows a most perfect and beautiful weeping habit-.

American Tomatoes in ENOLAND.--The Lon- don Oarden haa the following to say about American toroatoea, but we are not ao aure of the Oarden*$ conduaion. A tomato ripened under an American aun ia something no English cli- mate can reach. Of course to get them in good condition to the English market, they would have to be gathered here before fully ripe, aoid this will prevent, perhaps, our beet qualities reaching England. We have little douht, how- ever, that with experience, they will be placed on the Engliah market in prime condition, and, if there be no other objection than that referred to by the Chrden, we fancy American tomatoea have a foir chance of the beat Engliah market. \"We have juataeen an importation of freah American tomatoea from New Jeraey. They have arrived in fair condition conaidering the diatance, but although unbroken and very ciue- fuUy packed, some of them were in that half-de- composed atate so eaaily detected by the experi- enced eye. It ia a miatake to aend tomatoes here, for even if they could come in good con- dition they would have to contend with a large aupply of Engliah grown aorta, and moat people would be inclined to purchaae the article that could be had freah, even if dearer.

Stato Board of AgrlcnUure.) BY THOB. MEEHAN, BOTANIST OF THE BOARD. The matters brought to the attention of your Botanist this season have been chiefly in relation to the important subject of forestry. There is a growing feeling of anxiety in regard to the fbtare, and an increasing disposition to encour- ige timber planting, providing anything practical in that direction can be done. The mining and fte railroad interests particularly are concerned for the future of our lumber supplies, and in order especially to study the coming timber question, your botanist devoted two months of the past season, at his own expense, to the ex- tmination of the forests of Virginia, North Carolina and Teimessee, the transportation being kindly furnished through the personal ex- ertions of President Hinckley, of the Philadel- phia, Wilmington and Baltimore Bailroad Com- pany; and later in the season, a short time was q>eQt among the forests of Schuylkill county, throogfa the kind invitation of the Board of Oirard Trusts, of the city of Philadelphia. The nsoH of these investigations is the knowledge tet there is very much more timber in the tomitiythan people generally believe, though It present in localities not convenient, as a pml thing, to market at paying prices ; that Vtt the present sources of supply there is a Saving dearth of timber, and it is this prominent ^ that creates so much alarm, and the pre- valent fear that the whole timber supply will >0OQ give oat ; and, finally, it is apparent from yoor Botanist's investigations that when there •ittB be a real scarcity of lumber, so as to affect the market price seriously, it will pay companies to pbot timber ; and forests so planted will come into use, when properly cared for, in much 1 time than the community has been led to be- lieve. Our forest literature has been mainly made up from European sources, or suggested by Euro- pean experiences. Trees grow in many places there very slowly. The oak in England has been known to live one thousand years, and the writer has seen some five hundred years old, and still with many hundred less cubic feet of lum- ber than many American oaks not two hundred years old. Indeed, it is doubtful whether any timber trees in the eastern Atlantic States reach two hundred years of age without exhibiting signs of decrepitude, in which case the tree makes poor lumber, and is really fit for little more than fire-wood. During the past season a large number of trunks and stumps have been examined, and, by carefully counting an inch where the annual growths are the smallest, and an inch where the annual growths seemed most rapid, and taking an average with which to measure the diameter, very much of the lumber of commerce was found to be from trees less than one hundred years old, and very few trees found with rings showing over one hundred and fifty years. In going through the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, the absence of any remark- ably old trees was very apparent, and Major Jed. Hotchkiss, an able naturalist of Staunton, Vir- ginia, furnished proof entirely satisfactory that when the white man settled in the valley it was wholly clear of timber, and that most of the immense quantity we find there now has grown up during the past one or two hundred years. In like manner the probability is that in all the large valleys of Pennsylvania there was no wood at the early settlement of the State. This is the tradition among almost all who have had family estates for several generations ; and this is con- firmed by the recent investigations of Dr. Joseph 20 THE QARDENEIP8 MONTHLY [jMimry, Leidj. of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, who reported to that body recently the &ding of the bones of the buffalo in caves of northeastern Pennsylvania, an animal which does not exist in wooded countries. Indeed, the tradition is, especially in the Cumberland Valleyt thai these valleys were annually fired by the Indians, chiefly that trees might be kept down «nd food provided for the buffalo inst^. We liaye cut away a great deal, but then we have gained some, and the fact is worth remembering. In the States of Virginia, Tennessee and North Oarolina there are, at the present time, millions t>f acres of magnificent forest trees. Among theee are white oak, chestnut oak, red oak, and the tulip poplar in immense quantities ; with a great quantity of species, usefiil but less known, used in the leading arts, such as beech, birch, «lm, sweet gum, black or sour gum, buttonwood, linden, cucumber, and other magnolias, ash, sugar and other maples, locust, chestnut and liorse chestnut, walnut and hickory, enormous ««gar berry trees, and dogwoods larger than in the north, besides many others interesting to the ^tanist; but for which the special uses have yet to be found. Besides these, there are among the resinous trees, immense quantities of the yellow pine, (Pinu$ tmda,) bull pine, (Pinus nUtis,) •and Post or Jersey pine. (Pinus inopa,) which grows up into forests of straight trees, very dif- ferent from what we find them in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Besides these are hemlock, spruce in some quantity, white pine in less, and in still smaller quantities balsam fir { Abies <FVa«0n), and black spruce (Abies Nigra), (To be oootiaaetL) SASSAFRAS TREES IN MASSACHUSETTS. BY JAMES J. H. GREGORY, MARBLEHEAD, MASS. I recently read an article in some agricultural ^blication, the name of which has slipped my jmemory, where it was stated that while the Sassafras attained to the size of a tree in the South, in New England, owing to an unfavora- ble climate, it was so dwarf in its proportions as oot to deserve the name of a tree. This is a mistake. One of my neighbors a few years ago «utdown several trees which were twenty-five feet in height, and my next neighbor has now one or more on his premises which is from twenty-five to thirty feet in height, and nearly three feet in circumference at its base. On one x>f my farms in Middleton, in the eastern part of .Massachusetts, there stand three Sassafras trees. two of them about thirty feet in heighti while the third measures over fifty feet in height, with a circumference of five feet four inches at its base. The tallest tree, standing alone near s wall, on a hill-side, is yet healthy and in good vigor, though a few years ago while burying cab- bage near its base, some large roots were severely pruned. It is evident, therefore, if the SassafrM is scarce as a tree in New England, it is not by reason of an unfavorable climate. I will hasard the guess that the restless fingers and knives of Yankee boys after its firagrant twigs and roots have proved a hindrance to its tree development far greater than the climate. EDITORIAL NOTES. The Black Walnut.— While there is a grett deal of loose talk about the danger of the United States being without a stick of timber within th« near future, there is no doubt but that it will pay now to plant some kinds of trees in some pa^ ticular situations. There are yet millions of acres of American forests growing up or in de- cadence, and which will not to-day bring $5 an acre. Near some large consuming centres tim- ber has become scarce, and in prairie countriei it has to be planted. But there has really be- come a scarcity of black walnut, and there is little danger of any one \" investing in a desd horse \" who plants it. When traveling through Indiana some weeks ago, the writer saw some logs that had brought $100 each. Even under the ordinary course of nature such logs could be produced in forty years in an Indiana climate ; but with a little careful culture in infancy, sacb as one would give corn, we believe as good logs could be had in half the time. Thousands on thousands of people fiock to the life insurance companies, paying, perhaps, from $100 to $1,000 a year for the future good of their families, starving the present that the future may be mide rich, but which insurance would not yield any- thing like the sum ten acres of black walnut would do, and without all the annual drain on the family revenue. Mr. Nuttall says in the 5i//va, that the next neighbor to the black wal- nut, the butternut, yields as much sugar as the sugar maple. We have never heard of any fur- ther experiments in this direction than those quoted by Mr. Nuttall.

BY THOMAS BfEEHAK, Pnteor of Botany in the Sute Board of Agriculture of Pena- sylvaaia, and Fellow of the Association. Students of nature, who have thoughtfully ob- •enredy must have noted at least two great objects in the creation of sex. The first and leading one ■ evidently to insure variation ; the second to lid and assist reproduction. But our text-books ifty little of the first ; while every behavior of flowers IB regarded as relating to the last, and beDce we have so much said and written on the adrtntagesof crofls-fertilization, as if reproduc- tion were the sole end and aim of sex. That reproduction is not the sole end of sex is apparent from the fact that reproduction by c^ division is more common in v^etation than r^rodaction by seed. Bulbs, tubers, rhizomes ud other subterranean structures, with bulblets, numers and other arrangements above ground are fiuniliar examples. Many plants with color- ed oorollas rarely seed, while some never do. Of these I might name Kanunculus Ficaria, Ifliam dgrinum, the Horse Radish, Goohlearia w&oraica, &c. ; and again are those which de- fttd on insect or similar agency for polleniza- ^ and though apparently as a result bearing <Md abundantly, yet rarely producing plants in Mtftre from these seeds. Of these last, I need ooly refer to Yucca and Orchidesd as the best blown of the class dependent on insect fertiliza- tion. The terrestrial orchidess of the United SUtes BCtitly fruit in great abundance, and there are ■ttny thousands of seeds in each capsule ; yet 0^7 reiearches have rarely been rewarded by plants that I could believe to be seedlings ; while in nearly all cases the relation by ofi&ets firom a parent plant was plain. On the other hand^ orchid locations are declining, and Yucca con- fines its species to comparatively limited loca> tions, apparently raising a crop of seeds more for the sake of feeding the larvss of the Yucca moth, than as an aid in plant distribution. So fiar as reproduction is concerned, it will not be de- nied that millions on millions of seeds are crea- ted in vain, that thousands of millions of fiowers bloom uselessly, that volumes of odor and tons and tons of pollen are given to the winds and to the insects, without any possible benefit to the individual, which could be made to increase without any of these productions of no conceiva- ble benefit to the race, except as might arise from some imaginary good from cross-fertiliza- tion. We see from these simple considerations that sex can have but a very remote relation to the good of the individual or the race ; and we may reasonably look about for some more im- portant service which sex is to render. We find this in variety. This is essential to our present conditions of existence. Imagine the higher order of animals increasing by divi- sion! Each would be exactly like its parent. Mr. Smith could not tell himself from Mr. Brown. But the union of two distinct individuals, and each individual with varying powers of trans- mitting identity, leads to infinite variety, by which each can clearly distinguish that which is his from what is his neighbor's. Variety is a greater necessity to sentient beings than to in- animate things ; hence we see that propagation through sex is imperative among them. But it can, in this respect, make no difference to a plant. It is of no consequence to one blade of grass that another blade should be or not be just like it. But it is of great consequence to THE QARDENBR8 MOlfTHLY [Janoazy, the Animal life that is to feed on them. Each kind is made to prefer some kinds of fruit and vegetables, which must have distinct characters in order to be easily recognized ; and hence we have at once a good reason for form, color, fra- grance and the infinite variety these productions give rise to. If this view be correct, and I can- not conceive that it can be controverted, it puts a new view on modem teleology. In all the dis- cussions on the yarious arrangements of plants and animals, we hear only of what good is to re- sult to the individual or to the race. This is the essential character of the doctrine of natural selection. But on the principle that I have 'sketched out — ^the principle of variation~we see plants and animals not working merely for their own good, although that is incidentally involved, but for the good of generations yet unborn, and in which they can have no interest. Indeed, fol- lowing the inexorable law of variation, plants may be said to be laboring to make themselves distinct from each other so that the various ani- mals may be better able to recognize and con- sume them. They must necessarily be under the control and direction of an outside power, which clearly foresees that there will be mouths, and judgment required to select the food which is to go into them ; all of which would be useless unless plants were forced into a variety, which is thus to enable them to be the more easily sacri- ficed when the proper time arrives. Of course the selfish views embodied in the modem doc- trines of teleology must be incidentally tme. No individual would work unless it supposed it was working for its owo good. Pleasure must be a condition of existence. This also must be a universal law, and \" natural selection\" so far to be conceded. But this law must of necessity be limited. It is not for the geod of a plant that it should be eaten by an animal ; but it is per- fectly consistent with the law of universal good that it should have just enough of thorns, or bit- terness, or some other measures of defence to keep the race from being utterly annihilated. May we not conclude from all this that varia- tion and not reproduction is the one great law to which we are primarily to refer all sexual phe- nomena; that reproduction occupies only a place subservient to this law ; and if so may we not proceed to review the theories which have been established under a mistaken idea of the order of things ? I propose to examine, but I shall confine my- self here to only one subject; indeed to but a part of that sulyect, namely, the relation which odor in flowers bears to modem theories of fertilization.
