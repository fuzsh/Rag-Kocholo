        "text": "In this contribution we describe the nature and impact of our collaborative work as members of the Middle Mekong Archaeology Project (MMAP). We also summarize some of the substantive results of the project and reflect on progress and improvements we hope to make in the future. The MMAP is collaborative research program of Lao, Western, and Thai scholars, students, and heritage management officials codirected by Joyce White and Bounheuang Bouasisengpaseuth. The project has two aims. The first is to investigate the prehistory of the middle reaches of the Mekong Basin, with particular attention to the Middle Holocene (6000–2000 B.C.) during which agricultural societies and later metallurgy came into the region (White and Bouasisengpaseuth 2008). The second aim is to provide archaeological training for Lao, Thai, and Westerners working on mainland Southeast Asian archaeology.\n\nThe Vat Phou complex [fig. 1] is located in Champasak Province in Southern Laos on the right bank of the Mekong River, 100 km north of the Khone waterfalls which mark the border with Cambodia. It stretches to a sacred mountain, the tip of which has a remarkable shape, identified in antiquity as a liṅga, hence the ancient Sanskrit name Liṅgaparvata, meaning “Liṅga Mountain”. The existence of a permanent spring flowing from one of the cliffs most certainly inspired the first hinduised sovereigns to build a Shivaite shrine on the site. The most ancient structures were progressively replaced by a monumental religious complex in the classic Khmer style (11th-13th century), built on the hillside [fig. 2]. The pre-Angkorian (5th-7th century) City is in the plain, 5 km to the east on the banks of the Mekong, the ruins of which are mostly visible on aerial photographs. The ancient road connecting Vat Phou to Angkor region is singularly recognizable.\n\nThe Plain of Jars is a series of archaeological sites located in the Xieng Khouang and Luang Prabang Provinces of north Laos, populated with megaliths attributed to the late Iron Age of Southeast Asia. The thesis combines the historical study of this area in relation to the colonial institutions in Laos from 1893 to the early 1940s, with my new mapping of the jar sites based on extensive original documentation. The historical focus is the French archaeologist Madeleine Colani (1866-1943), author of a two-volume monograph on the Plain of Jars (Mégalithes du Haut-Laos, 1935). The events leading up to the first archaeological mission to the Plain of Jars in May 1931, led by Colani under the auspices of the École Française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), are analysed. Also addressed is academic interaction between Dutch researchers in Indonesia and their French counterparts in Indochina and how these exchanges led to the first Far-Eastern Prehistory Congress held in Hanoi in January 1932. Under-researched or undocumented aspects of jar form are discussed, together with a sequence of carving steps based on my observations at quarries and jar sites. An expanded site distribution is analysed in relation to sources of stone and historical routes. The thesis re-contextualizes Colani's work in her time and with new survey and production matter, redefines jar design and iconography, the spatial distribution of sites and their close relationship to the places and processes of manufacture. Regional comparisons are explored and discussed in relation to megaliths and material culture from archaeological sites in Mainland and Island Southeast Asia, and South Asia."
