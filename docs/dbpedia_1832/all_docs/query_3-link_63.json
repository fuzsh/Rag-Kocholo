Its topography is varied so there are a variety of beautiful natural sites such as Pha Chanadai Cliff at Pha Taem National Park; the cliff is at the end of the east side of Thailand and is the location to calculate the sunrise. For this reason, it is the first location to see the sunrise every day with the stunning scenery of the Mekong River and Laos. Moreover, there is Wat Sirindhornwararam, or the fluorescent temple that outstanding point is the luminous painting of the Pink Shower Tree on the back wall of the ubosot."
