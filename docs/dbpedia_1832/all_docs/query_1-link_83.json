ISU Soldier^g Action Conveys Lesson in Statecraft 'HERE U something strangely moving If there were a little more of that spirit, soldier, who, dying from wounds in the Philippines, bequeathed his $10,000 insur- ance fund to a former JapaneM Kamlkase pilot who is on his way now to Lafayette, in Pennsylvania, to major in the liberal arts. Here, In the quiet Rction of one who had seen battle, is an object lesson in state- craft, in the understanding which trans- cends the human animosity, prejudice and ill will from which the world is suffering. It is interesting to note the reaction of the Japanese pilot who became the bene- ficiary of this strange will. He is reported as saying: **1 wish 1 had known him. If his body has been returned to America I must hasten to his grave. He had so much greater vision than we Jai^anese in the hysterical days of the war ... I want to share my opportunity with others (teaching). I believe that Is what he would have wanted.\" Much Ado About Butter After three months of embittered de- bate as to yrhether or not there would be a butter shortage in Canada this Winter, the Dominion (Government now an- nounces that importations from New Zea- land, Denmark and a third, as yet unnamed, coimtry will assure sufficient butter stocks for the nation's needs. A simultaneous suggestion outside of governmental circles that the celling price should be removed will hardly fit In with the public's temper In the matter. During the debate itself, in which one Cabinet member was saying one thing and another contradicting him flatly, the Im- pression was created throughout the coun- try that there would be a severe butter shortage for the consumera The Govern- ment acted to put a very high ceiling price of the nations at l^c Success and else- where this world would not be in the condi- tion it is at the present time. It would be difficult to Imagine two more outright “enemies\" in war than the testator and his beneficiary would have been, had they come into contact. It would be hard to conceive a finer lifelong settlement of that feud between indivldiii^. Nations at their foundation are indi- viduals, and society will be what they make it. Fear, suspicion, distrust and the arms-length pattern of negotiation have not produced peace in the world. It is easy to point the finger In blame at one nation or at another. It is far more difficult to take the long view, as the dying American doughboy did, and so find a permanent peace which no one would seek to break. His name. Robert Johnstone, of Downlng- ton. Pa., deserves to be remembered. on the commodity, at the peak of its Winter level; and later to put a floor price under it, below which trading would not take place. Meanwhile the counter-debate on mar- garine ran its course, without fliuil action. When ail the shouting Is over, it seems that Canada's butter supply may bt, not must be. some 15.0(X),0(X) pounds below esti- mated consumption. Denmark and New Zealand have undertaken to supply 9,000,- 000 pounds, of which Denmark will ship three-quarters and New Zealand one- quarter of that amount. Negotiations are proceeding to fill in the remaining gap through other importations. Thus the “shortage\" would seem to be disposed of. if not Its effects. The public TrtU be on the alert now to see what will be the next move in artificial stimulation of a product claimed to be in short supply. Redurinfn Police Force Would Be P nor Economy Reducing the numerical strencth of Victoria’s police force as proposed by Police C>>mml88ioner Gadsden is scarcely a practical or commonsense solu- tion to the city’s current financial problem, or one that is likely to commend Itself either to Mr. Gadsden's colleagues on the commis- sion or to the public generally. It is idle to single out the fact that the force has, almost doubled in five years as grounds for retrenchment next year Factors affecting law enforcement have changed vastly in the last half-decade. During the war the civil agencies had service police to assist them and could af- ford to hold their owti forces to a minimum. In five yean, too. the population of Victoria has almost doubled; working conditions of policemen have been ameliorated, largely by statute, and over and above these fac- tors growing traffic problems, likely to be- come worse rather than better, have made increases in the number of police unavoid- able. With a population currently estimated at 65.000, Victoria City has a staff of 77 officers for active police duty, which works out at slightly more than one to every 1,000 popu- lation. As they are employed in three eight-hour shifts, however, that ratio does not present a true picture of the number of men available at a given time. A propor- tion of one to 1.25 police per 1,000 is ac- cepted as the minimum requirement In Canada, rising above the latter figure in thickly populated centres. It cannot be said, therefore, that Victoria is over-policed. On the contrary, there have been time* when the strength of the force has seemed sharply Inadequate. Amalgamation is the key.

Klstory will note that after the World War all tbs democracies turned In greater or leaser degree to thoushts of mutual aid. Germany bad taught no longer a defence against aggression but, on the contrary, almost InvlteA attack. Picking i^ums one by one had become the attacker's practice In two world wara Military hlstohans, too, will note that hurried alliances arising from sudden acts of aggression usually broke down because of lack of eo- ordination and vital dlfXerences In equipment Between the French and the British, in ItSO, there wss ttttle attempt at standardization. The two air forces used different aircraft, fuel grades, and calibre of ammunition tn their guns. The hard-pressed Royal Air Force could get little from the Armee de TAlr, or vice versa. Even engin- eers' spanners were of different alses. It took three years of a Joint Anglo- American war effort to bring even the United SUtes and British air forces into, some sc^ of rough itandardlaa- tlon as to guns, engines and opera- tional techniques. BRITISH CRAFT CHOSEN To avoid a recurrence of the 1039 poslU(m, the nations of Western Europe have now chosen British jet aircraft to re-equlp their fighter squadrons. Three types have so far been picked— the De HavUland Vam- pire, Oloster Meteor and Vickers At- tacker SwlUerland, Sweden and Norway have all taken delivery of Vampires. Holland Is using Meteors, while France and Belgium are inquiring about all three rraft. Inside the British Commonwealth, of course, desired standardisation has already been achieved. Australia U making her own Vampires, Canada buys them from Britain, and the Union of South Africa has her Meteors. Turkey and Iran have recently had Meteor demonstrations and the Shah has been on a tour of aircraft factories in Britain. It is a compliment to Britain’s air- craft Industry that. In all these wide moves for standardisation, only Brit- ish aircraft have been considered. Circumstances have admittedly been on the side of United Kingdom manu- facturers. Only two western countries have any aircraft industry worth speaking of— Britain and the United States— and since most of Europe is suffering from a dollar ertals. the choice might appear a forced one. Nevertheless, had not Brltain'a ]eU been as good as they are 1 doubt that the Scandinavian countries would have choeen them if they had not been 100 per cent reliable, and the other countries also would have cer- tainly postponed spending large sums of money. No state In today's stringent tlmaa can afford to buy blindly. WORLD'S BEST FIOmTHS The truth is that Europe's desire for standardized air defence forces has coincided with the svailablllty of what are currently the world's best fighter aircraft It may. from point of view of world security, be a valuable coincidence even though reculUng standardisation has been concentrated only on defence, which menace* no one. The Royal Air Force squadron of Vaznplraa which has just returned from a North American tour gave the point to Europe's choice by Impress- ing Canadians and Americans alike with their manoeuverabtllty and free- dom from maintenance worries. I spoke to s United State* Army Air Force pilot recently and he sumqsed It «p by saying: \"Our aircraft are faster than Vampires, but are not so handy, while Meteors have It over us on all mints. As for engine hours between checks. I gueu wt have got to hand It to British engines.\" — N.A.N.A.

By HAROLD DINGMAN O'TTAWA. — In the radio world the Indelicate word \"sUnkcr\" was applied to Station CJBC. the key out- let of the Dominion network of th* Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It enjoyed little advertising revenue because it had a listener-rating as close to serO'Zero aa any station could have and still operate. Of course It was financed by your income tax pay- ments and the C-B.C. was not much concerned with revenue. Bui the absence of listeners shamed the man- agement. It was finally decided that all the vexing problems of CJBC could be solved by obtaining a new broadcast- ing channel. That is. CJBC wanted a new and more favorable place on the radio dial. But there were no ehannals available, sot good cmes anyway. The C.B.C. then decided to seise (by doubtful Uw) the best channel In one of the richest advertsing markets In all Canada. CJBC operates in Toronto and covers a big arta of thickly-populated Ontario and parts of the UBA. CJBC was operating at 1010 on the radio dial. It decided to lake over 800. But 880 was operated by CFRB, one of the biggest private radio sta- tions. There was only one way for C3.C. to obtain 880, and that was by using s loaded blackjack and clubbing the private station out of business. Therefore C.B.C. sent s notice to CFRB saying \"get off channel 880. You have no authority to be there It's a good channel and we demand it.\" CFRB protested, but it did no good. The C3.C. controls the licensing of CFRB (and all other stations) This U the loaded blackjack. The private stations do as the C B C. Instructs, or they go out of business. CFRB Tscated channel 860 and moved to 1010. The old swltcheroo. The private station wu sunk into the channel where CJBC had been a com- plete failure. It cost the private station $500,000 to make the move, but the C3.C. gracloualy permitted the management to increase Its power to 50,000 watts. Previously CFRB had operated at 10,000 watts. The CBC. took eonalderablt satU- faction in Informing the private sta- tion that although It waa permitted to go to 60,000 watts, this would not Increase its coverage. Thai is, what It prcvlouily reached with 10.000 power would not be Improved by five times that. Last week the CBC started a shameless series of sdvertlsmeg^ in daily newspapers Turn the dim to 860. the ads urged, for the \"clearer\" channel. For the private station H meant that many years of work and advsr- Using to develop a listening audlcnoo on that channel had all been wuied. Or. not wasted altogether, th* Oov- eniment station would reap the har- vest. As everyone knows, the C3.C. is a Crown corporation and for some rea- son tt has been given absolute power over all other stations. On many pre- rloua occasions Its behavior has been autocratic and dictatorial. The selsure of a developed radio channel reached a new high tn arrogant Indifference to the welfare of private statlona No one argues the right of the Federal Government to expropriate property as It needs It. But never to my knowledge has the Government seised property without making soma compensation If you own a building and the Government takes tt over, you get paid In cash The private radio station got noth- ing. The C B C. claimed, of courae. that when CFRB was originally allowed to operate on 880 it had been notified that eventually U would have to Tacate that channel. The manage- ment of CFRB says no such notlflca- Uon wu ever given, and that year after year the station wu encouraged to spend big money to develop. Would this have been done with prior knowl- edge that the Investment would be wuted? Not likely. Quackery of the Electronic Age Observation By THOMAS R. HENRY Setanee Editor, North Amertesa Newspaper AHlaoee WA8HINOTON. — The electronic ag* hu brought the \"electronic quack.\" The extent to which this quackery hu advanced wu revealed lo the American Congreai of Physical Medicine here by Dr. Irvin Kerlcn. medical ofliotr of the United States Food and Drug Administration.
