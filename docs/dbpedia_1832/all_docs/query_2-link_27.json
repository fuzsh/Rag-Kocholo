        "text": "The levels of variation and genetic diversity of offspring of randomly selected old mother trees in four marginal populations of the Pinus cembra in the Tatra Mountains were analyzed. Twenty-four isozyme loci were analyzed (nine of them were monomorphic). The analyzed offspring of Swiss stone pine showed highly diverse polymorphism at the levels of both provenances and individual families (the offspring of one mother tree). The mean observed heterozygosity was low and very similar to that of other Carpathian populations. The genetic diversity (mean F st = 11%) between the four provenances was higher than that observed for populations from the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. The genetic uniqueness (high genetic richness and diversity) of the analyzed Tatra populations of P. cembra as a whole and particular tree stands requires protection because of their valuable contribution to the species total genetic diversity (gene pool).\n\nRAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) markers were used to reveal genetic variation in 55 geographically distinct populations of Pinus roxburghii of the Himalayan region, covering the entire natural range of distribution of the species in India. Populations vary between the longitude range of 71° 1 N to 92° 23 E, latitude 27° 19 N to 33° 22 N within an altitudinal range of 520 m to 2205 m. A total of 50 decamer primers were used, out of which twenty primers were selected based upon the polymorphism and reproducibility of results. Primers generated a total of 231 amplification products, out of which 191 amplicons were polymorphic. Amplification products obtained per primer ranged from as low as 5 to a maximum of 18, with an average of 11.55. The extent of polymorphism varied with the primer. Divergence in respect of percent polymorphism ranged from 76 to 100% with an average of 84% in the species. The similarity coefficient ranged from 0.36 to 0.78 and the genetic distance varied from 0.23 to 0.53 between the populations. Based on the UPGMA dendrogram and genetic similarity pattern, the populations of P. roxburghii were grouped into five major clusters. Genetic similarity analysis showed considerable variation among the populations ranging from highest similarity between the populations of Una, Badasar (Himachal Pradesh; HP) and Jamta (HP); Una, Badasar (HP) and Manikaran (HP) with 78% similarity. Highest dissimilarity was observed between the populations of Gaucher (Uttarakhand) and Akhnoor (Jammu and Kashmir) with only 36% similarity (64% dissimilarity). The results reveal that there is a fair amount genetic variability in the existing forests of Himalayan chir pine (P. roxburghii) and as such the information is valuable with regard to initiate conservation and genetic improvement efforts in this species.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to determine the level of genetic diversity within and among Ciuc basin, Romania (populations from Mohos and Luci raised bogs in Harghita Mountain and Sumuleu in Ciuc Mountain) Pinus sylvestris populations using molecular markers. Two of populations (Mohos and Luci) seems to be the descendants that survived the continental glaciation. Genetic diversity was analyzed by RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA). Nine primers were selected for analysis, which generated reproducible bands. On base of presence or absence of homologues bands Nei’s gene diversity, the percentage of polymorphic loci and Nei’s unbiased genetic distance were calculated. The level of genetic variation among populations was found to be low. For both populations the variation values among populations were higher than within populations. The fossil records and geological historical data explain the extremely low genetic diversity of this species. Pinus sylvestris experienced str..."
