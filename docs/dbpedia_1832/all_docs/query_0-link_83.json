        "text": "Under the royalist military dictatorship, things monarchical just get madder by the minute.\n\nAny reasonable person who heard a claim by a General that and event that could “lead to an overthrow of the regime of democracy with the King As Head of State or affects the national security, peace and order, and good morality of the people” might think that something significant had taken place. But not in the land of monstrously mad monarchists.\n\nKhaosod reports that Lt. Gen Peerapong Manakit, a member of the regulatory National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC) has declared that the Commission has “launched an investigation into a state-owned TV station after one of its anchors misidentified a member of the Royal Thai Family in a news program.”\n\nObviously a heinous crime has been committed. Anyone who views the nightly royal propaganda that is broadcast knows that newsreaders regularly stumble over the faux ancient names and titles given to themselves by the royals. The ridiculousness of reporting the daily visits by well-fed royals is a ritual demanded by the palace and state.\n\nPPT is always surprised how straight-faced the announcers are as this parade of odd looking curiosities takes place. Yet we know the smallest stumbles and mistakes get the newsreaders into hot water.\n\nThe General claims that “the incident took place this morning when a Channel 3 anchorwoman ‘incorrectly stating the royal name and rank’ of Princess Soamsawali, former wife of Thai Crown Prince, in a news report about Her Royal Highness’ trip to a temple.” As the report helpfully points out, “Princess Soamsawali was married to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn in 1977. The couple divorced in 1991.”\n\nSoamsawali was wife no. 1, and is the prince’s first cousin. Since then he’s had two other official wives, both now kicked out and both disgraced by the prince with charges and attacks. One (Yuvadhida Polpraserth) is in exile and the other languishes in virtual house arrest as her family and associates have all been jailed (Srirasmi). We imagine that burying and disgracing a blood relative was not possible following Soamsawali’s divorce from the prince.\n\nIt is Peerapong who claims that this “mistake constitutes a violation of the 2008 Thai Public Broadcasting Service Act, which forbids airing content that could ‘lead to an overthrow of the regime of democracy with the King As Head of State or affects the national security, peace and order, and good morality of the people’.”\n\nThe report claims that “[r]epresentatives of Channel 3 have been summoned to give testimony to the NBTC ‘urgently’…”, with the General stating that “punishment will be decided after the commission listens to Channel 3’s side of the story.” He referred to the Channel 3 “side of the story” as “testimony in our deliberation of punishment.”\n\nAs usual, guilt in royal matters is assumed.\n\nSo heinous is this “crime” in the land of royal make-believe that the “general also asked media agencies not to publish details about Channel 3’s alleged wrongdoing, or else they will be liable for prosecution as well.”\n\nWe imagine, based on the befuddling use of the lese majeste law of late, that the military dictatorship may make this event another case.\n\nGiven that the king and queen are no longer visible, we can assume that the regime of lese majeste lunacy is a symbol of the forthcoming reign under military dictatorship.\n\nUpdate: Prachatai reports that the news anchor read the formal name and title of Srirasmi Suwadee, the third former wife of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn “who was recently demoted to commoner, instead of Princess Soamsawali’s name.” Given the purge of Srirasmi’s family and the attempt to expunge her prior to succession and the prince’s fourth official marriage, the thundering, huffing and puffing and threats and general ridiculousness is both a sign of the future and an indicator of the depths of feudal decay that Thailand has been dragged by mad monarchists, the military and the palace.\n\nA few days ago PPT posted on Thailand’s big but still murky story. The case involving senior police, including an uncle of Srirasmi (Srirasm) Akharapongpreecha, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn’s then official consort, has widened.\n\nPrachatai reports that:\n\nThree brothers and two more people connected to a network of high ranking police officers charged with lèse majesté are accused of defaming the monarchy, illegal possession of weapons, robbery, and holding others for ransom. A total of seven people involved in this case have now been charged with lèse majesté.\n\nThe investigators on 28 November detained three siblings, Natthapol, Sitthisak, and Narong Akharapongpreecha, and Sutthisak Sutthijit and Chakan Phakphum, who are allegedly criminally associated with Pol Lt Gen Pongpat Chayapan.\n\nThe five suspects are charged with defaming the monarchy, carrying weapons in public, possessing unlicensed weapons, robbery, and unlawful detention. All of them pleaded guilty to all charges.\n\nAccording the ASTV-Manager, Pol Maj Gen Sriwara Rangsiphrammanakul, commander of the Metropolitan Police stated at the press briefing that three of the five, Natthapol, Narong, and Chakan also have also been charged with extortion, unlawful detention, and robbery by Phrakhanong Police Station and Wat Phraya Krai Police Station.\n\nThe report doesn’t state the obvious, but these three brothers have the same family name as the prince’s consort. Clearly, the Akharapongpreecha family is in deep trouble. Some say that the clean-out is part of the succession struggle. Others say it is about bringing down Srirasmi’s “network.”\n\nWhatever is really happening, something significant is happening in and around Vajiralongkorn’s family. Of course, he is seldom around, spending most of his time overseas, mostly in Germany, and it might be suggested that he may not have been aware of the Akharapongpreecha family amassing huge stores of ill-gotten gains. That would seem highly improbable. More likely is that this is a messy separation with a fight over custody and wealth.\n\nWe are guessing, like everyone else, but these events do have some resonances with the prince’s previous separation from earlier wives, all of which have seen murky and often nasty events play out.\n\nIn the 1980s, his separation from cousin Soamsawali for Yuvadhida Polpraserth saw an anti-royal leaflet campaign. As one of our posted documents states (Updated link: clicking downloads a PDF that is probably illegal in Thailand):\n\n… a stunning series of leaflets attacking the monarchy right at the height of the King’s birthday celebrations [were released]. Emerging from the shadows of gossip and hearsay, the pamphlets were suddenly everywhere. The military and police found it necessary to interrupt normal radio and television programming just three days after the King’s birthday to denounce the anonymous authors as ‘… enemies of the nation … bent on undermining the monarchy’ (Far Eastern Economic Review, 24 December 1987). The military and police claimed that the offending literature was from ‘a group of the Kingdom’s enemies’ (Bangkok Post, 9 December 1987); not just of the monarchy, it should be noted, but the whole country.\n\nWhat was expressed in these leaflets to provoke such an extraordinary response? A brief excerpt from one of the offending leaflets will provide the flavour: ‘Sia O is totally besotted by Nang Yu [Yuvadhida]. So much so that he would willingly sniff her feet, or any other part of her body for that matter, since there is nothing he would not do for her.’\n\nWhen the prince got sick of her and wanted Srirasmi, the ditching of Yuvadhida was public and nasty. As one website has it:\n\nWhen Vajiralongkorn was introduced to Yuvadhida Polpraserth, she was an aspiring actress. She became his steady companion and gave birth to his first son, Prince Juthavachara Mahidol, on 29 August 1979. He later had three more sons and a daughter by her. They were married at a palace ceremony in February 1994, where they were blessed by the King and the Princess Mother, but not by the Queen. After the marriage, she was allowed to change her name to Mom Sujarinee Mahidol na Ayudhaya, signifying she was a commoner married to a royal. She was also commissioned as a major in the Royal Thai Army and took part in royal ceremonies with Vajiralongkorn. When she fled to Britain in 1996 with their children, Vajiralongkorn had posters placed around his palace accusing her of committing adultery with Anand Rotsamkhan, a 60-year-old air marshal. The prince abducted their daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him. She was later elevated to the rank of princess, whilst Sujarinee and her sons were stripped of their diplomatic passports and titles. She and her sons later moved to the United States. As of 2007, Sujarinee is known as Sujarinee Vivacharawongse.\n\nThere’s more here. The “problem” of Yuvathida and her sons was mentioned in Wikileaks and is also mentioned at New Mandala.\n\nWith this history, thinking that the prince might be sorting out his family affairs might be a reasonable guess. The prince has seldom sorted these things out quietly in the past.\n\nWe also have to wonder about the treasure trove allegedly unearthed by the police. Was this all stored for illicit wealth in the future? Or was it a collection?\n\nPPT has finished a first cull of the Wikileaks cables, and we have posted commentary on those that seemed of interest. We are now going back through the Cablegate database more systematically, and again we will gradually post comments on those that strike us as revealing. Apologies if we sometimes post on a cable we have had up before; there are a lot of them.\n\nGiven all of the material belching from the international media on England’s jubilee and the post on the Ananda Mahidol idolatry, a cable from 2 February 2005 seems worth some commentary. In it, Ambassador Ralph Boyce writes almost breathlessly about the then “latest news” on the royal family. The Embassy and State Department were eagerly royal-watching. If readers find tabloid-like “revelations” distasteful, read no further, for it is of that style.\n\nBoyce reports on a 27 January 2005 ceremony with the king and Princess Sirindhorn leading to “a private audience” for Boyce and a couple of others.\n\nThe first big news item is that “the King showed great interest in all exchanges.” The second item is that a discussion of “mental health and family stability” animated him. Boyce says: “These issues are obviously near and dear to the heart of the King, and while involved in this free-flowing conversation, he made several notable remarks.”\n\nOn family stability, Boyce states that the king commented:\n\nI understand how important it is to have both a mother and a father in a family unit. I lost my father at a very early age, and was raised by my mother. While she did a wonderful job of raising her children, she could not, alone, replace the role of a father.\n\nSome might read into this the his own search for a father-figure, first amongst the old and senior princes who fought against the 1932 Revolution, followed by his adulation for General Sarit Thanarat, who reciprocated and overturned much that had been done post-1932 to reduce royal power.\n\nOn his kids, he is reported as stating:\n\nI have four children. But she (Sirindhorn) is the only one who ‘sits on the ground with the people.’ She never married, but she has millions of children.\n\nNot really anything new or startling in this reporting, but Boyce then turns to a conversation when he “called on Dr. Chirayu Isarangkul na Ayuthaya, Director-General of the Crown Property, on February 1, 2005.”\n\nFirst, and, Boyce says “most significantly,” Chirayu “said that the Crown Prince’s wife … is pregnant.” PPT isn’t sure why this is significant for he also says that this was widely known. Perhaps the significance is in the unstated hope for a boy that would allow the dynasty a line. Otherwise, the only boys were from the disowned Yuvadhida Polpraserth, who lives in exile in the U.S., with her 4 sons, having been thrown out of Thailand by the prince several years ago.\n\nChirayu mentions “the Crown Prince’s former consort, Mom Yuvathida (aka Mom Benz),” saying that:\n\non the Queen’s last visit to the United States she had agreed to an audience with Mom Benz and her children, but that Mom Benz had not made contact with the royal traveling party. Subsequently, Ambassador Sakthip was asked to travel to Florida to meet with Mom Benz and her children, but Mom Benz declined the meeting. Apparently, there is an issue of medical expenses for Mom Benz’s third son; the Crown Prince reportedly has made it clear that he will cover these expenses and that he does not want his mother or father to be burdened with the issue of his former family.\n\nOn the family itself and the favorite Sirindhorn,\n\nChirayu noted that it said as much about the failings of the King’s other three children as his fondness and respect for Princess Sirindhorn. The other three had tried to carryout their royal responsibilities, but clearly were not as capable or interested as Princess Sirindhorn.\n\nOn the king’s eldest daughter, Chirayu said that:\n\nhe had had to undertake much of the bitter legal mediation between Princess Ubolratana and Peter Jensen. He noted that their separation and divorce had been quite nasty and that Mr. Jensen had not come to Thailand to attend his son’s funeral. Chirayu said that he fended off queries as to where Mr. Jensen was by joking that he was afraid to come to Thailand because the Crown Prince would beat him up.\n\nThis is an interesting comment, for at the time there were rumors that Jensen had arrived in Thailand but had been turned away and the comment about the prince was widely circulated. It seems the palace knows how to score advantages from the rumor mill.\n\nRemarkably, in a diplomatic cable, Boyce then adds his own re-statement of a rumor:\n\nWe have heard that Mr. Jensen borrowed money from several Thais and Thai banks prior to his divorce from Princess Ubolratana and that these funds have never been repaid.\n\nThe rumors usually have it that Ubolratana was a keen borrower.\n\nIt is sometimes commented that the royal family is dysfunctional. However, as the above rather odd diplomatic cable seems to indicate, while there are spats and disappointments, it seems to indicate that accommodations are made and the meatier things of conspicuous consumption and political and economic life probably hold sway over the squabbles."
