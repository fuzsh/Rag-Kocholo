This document provides the proceedings from the \"Parks for Peace International Conference on Transboundary Protected Areas as a Vehicle for International Co-Operation\" held in September 1997 in South Africa. The conference brought together experts in protected areas and international law to discuss how transboundary protected areas can help build relationships between countries while also addressing challenges. Case studies presented focused on how such areas can potentially defuse conflicts or build confidence after tensions, but also their vulnerability during times of war. Key recommendations from working groups focused on legal frameworks, management cooperation, and ensuring protected areas are not negatively impacted by conflicts or political issues between states.",
