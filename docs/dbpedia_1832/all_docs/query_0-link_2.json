BRIEF HISTORY\n\n1940-1950ies\n\nKatang villages move down from the hills in the 40 and 50ies.\n\n1958\n\nPXT (425 km2) was declared Forest Reserve (March 28).\n\n1965-75\n\nThe Americans and rightist Lao maintainan air-base with a 2 km paved runway on a plateau in the southern part (Kang Heuan) of the reserve.\n\n1975-90\n\nInsurgent activity continues until the late 1980ies.\n\n1983\n\nPhou Kang Heuan (117 km2) in the Champassak part of PXT is declared Forest Reserve (June 30).\n\n1992\n\nThe last official logging is carried out\n\n1993\n\nPXT is formally declared a National Reserved Forest in October (1,200 km2).\n\n1996\n\nManagement implementation started (February)\n\nFirst wildlife survey (April).\n\n1999 onwards\n\nSecurity problems trigger periodic closure by the army from early 1999 onward.\n\n3. ECOLOGY\n\nPhysical\n\nFeatures\n\nPXT incorporates the Lao side of the Mekong river and the adjoining hills eastward. In the east its edge is well defined by a steeply rising escarpment to a low sandstone plateau. The dissected plateau drains westward into the Mekong river via numerous small streams. Rocky flats and flat top conical hills are a dominant terrain feature. Vertical cliff faces similar to those found in Pha Taem on the other side of the Mekong river. Bizarre wind carved rock formations. In the north, there is a flat to undulating zone (140 km2) at elevations below 200 m.\n\nSoils are acid and shallow and unsuited for permanent agriculture.\n\nElevation\n\nElevations from 100m on the banks of the Mekong to a maximum 716 m of Phou Nangam of the southern escarpment. Generally, the elevations range from 300-500m in the southern part and from 200-400m in the north.\n\nClimate\n\nTropical monsoon climate with high rainfall (1,250 mm per annum at Khongxedone) during the monsoon and a pronounced 6- month dry season.\n\nMain Forest Types\n\nSemi (dry)-evergreen forest is the predominant forest type. Dry dipterocarp forest, mixed deciduous forest and bamboo are patchily distributed. The semi-evergreen forest in the northern part was subject to commercial logging as late as 1992. Widespread cutting and hand sawing of timber for cash income.\n\nother terrestrial habitat types and resources\n\nThe various forest types and other terrestrial habitats form a complex habitat mosaic. Extensive flats of bare rock or thinly vegetated by grass and shrubs are a prominent terrain feature.\n\nSeasonally exposed Mekong river sand banks and small alluvial fans in good condition despite agricultural use.\n\nSmall caves and sheer cliff faces up to 30m.\n\nAt least three mineral licks .\n\nOther\n\nHabitat\n\nFeatures\n\nWetlands: Some 15 short seasonal streams. 3 sizeable perennial streams. Water remains in the beds of most seasonal streams throughout the year.\n\nAn uninhabited 20 km stretch of the Mekong river.\n\nRecorded\n\nVertebrates\n\nVertebrate Class\n\nNo. of Species\n\nNo. of Key Species\n\nMammals\n\n16 (9)\n\n14\n\nBirds\n\n188\n\n11\n\nReptiles\n\nnot surveyed\n\nAmphibians\n\nnot surveyed\n\nFish\n\nnot surveyed\n\n4. EVALUATION\n\nPrincipal Contributions to the NBCA System\n\nBiodiversity\n\nValues\n\nPXT is the only Lao NBCA on the Mekong river and extends along some 100 km of its course including both rocky and sandy river banks.\n\nExtensive tracts of little disturbed semi-evergreen forest.\n\nIts characteristic rocky flats at elevations of 300-500 m are elsewhere and in similar form only found in PKK.\n\nPopulations of wildlife key species are generally low. Of these, only one bird species (green peafowl) is present in a population considered of high global and very high national significance. Among the mammals, only banteng and leopard are present in populations that are of high significance at the national level.\n\nNo botanical surveys have yet been conducted.\n\nWatershed\n\nValues\n\nSecurity\n\nValues\n\nSensitive border area with current security problems\n\nCultural\n\nValues\n\nnone significant known at present\n\nRecreation\n\nand Tourism\n\nValues\n\nGood potential for nature tourism along scenic stretches of the Mekong river if security problems can be overcome.\n\nPrincipal\n\nThreats\n\nNew settlements and expansion of existing settlements along the Mekong river, road access.\n\nOne small settlement was abandoned due to project intervention. A 'no new settlement' policy is implemented by the security forces. Land and forest allocation is underway for all Mekong side villages. Road access across the reserve to settlements along the Mekong would undermine the settlement policy. Preventing the upgrading of existing roads or of major foot trails to vehicle tracks is a management priority.\n\nDestructive fishing\n\nFishing with explosives and poison affects even remote stretches of the streams. The intensity of traditional fishing in the Mekong is increasing. Evidence that some villages apprehend offenders.\n\nHunting\n\nTraplines and hunting with dogs targeting pangolins, turtles, and monitor lizards are of concern. Several cases of banteng poaching in 1996, but none reported since.\n\nLivestock grazing\n\nA problem in a few locations where herders live off the land, set fire, and where livestock kills by predators occur. Few villages are affected. Complete closure to livestock grazing of some sectors should be negotiated.\n\nTimber cutting\n\nTimber cutting and sawing is an important source of income for many locals. In the Mekong side villages additional value is added by boat construction. Affecting only peripheral areas.\n\nUnrestrained collecting of forest products\n\nA problem where it involves large groups (up to 30 people) spend several days in remote areas living off the land. District issue of quotas for is part of the problem. Management of NTFPs by villages combined with use prohibition in core zone sectors is pursued to solve the problem.\n\nFire\n\nFires are frequent and widespread during the long dry season. Usually associated with other problems and uses as stated above.\n\nReasons for\n\nProposed\n\nExtensions or\n\nExcisions\n\n5.
