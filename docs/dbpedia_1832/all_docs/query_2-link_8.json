        "text": "The Khok Kruat Formation, which is part of the non-marine Mesozoic Khorat Group of northeastern Thailand, is referred to the Aptian on biostratigraphical evidence. It has yielded an abundant and diverse dinosaur assemblage, comprising saurischians and ornithischians. Isolated theropod teeth indicate several forms of different sizes, including a Siamosaurus-like animal. A recently discovered partial theropod skeleton clearly belongs to a spinosaurid. Sauropods are represented by a form with peg-shaped teeth reminiscent of Phuwiangosaurus; no spoon-shaped teeth have so far been found. Ceratopsians are represented by a well-defined species of Psittacosaurus, P.sattayaraki. Ornithopods are abundant, with an advanced iguanodontian reminiscent of Probactrosaurus. Theropod and ornithopod footprints have also been found. The dinosaur assemblage from the Khok Kruat Formation is clearly different from that from the slightly older Sao Khua Formation, which is dominated by sauropods and in which no ornithischians have so far been found. Comparative studies on the dinosaur assemblages from Thailand may lead to a better understanding of the palaeobiogeographical events linked with faunal change during the Early Cretaceous in South-East Asia.\n\nThis first overview of the bony fish record from the Jurassic and Cretaceous continental deposits of Thailand reveals a significant diversity, with 16 taxa in four formations (the Khlong Min, Phu Kradung, Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Fms). Four of these taxa have already been diagnosed and described, and a couple of others are sufficiently well preserved to be diagnosed in the future. The other taxa are represented at present by fragmentary and isolated remains. The highest diversity is observed among ‘semionotids’, which occur in the four formations. Sinamiids are represented by at least three taxa that occur only in the Sao Khua and the Khok Kruat Formations. Pycnodont fishes are known by rare and isolated dentitions and teeth in the Khlong Min and Sao Khua Formations, and lungfishes referred to Ferganoceratodus occur in the Khlong Min and the Phu Kradung Formations. The assemblages provide few palaeogeographical indications at present, except for evidence of relationships with China and Central Asia. However, it is expected than once the phylogenetic relationships of these taxa are resolved, we will be able to reconstruct precise palaeogeographical scenarios.\n\nOxygen isotope compositions of tooth enamel increments in theropod dinosaurs are investigated as potential proxies of climate seasonality. Six teeth of large carnivorous theropods collected from four Cretaceous formations deposited under contrasted climates have been sampled. These teeth have been analyzed for the oxygen isotope compositions of their apatite phosphate (δ 18 O p) through incremental sampling performed along the major growth axis. Significant fluctuations in oxygen isotope compositions along the growth axis of each tooth are observed and interpreted as reflecting seasonality in ingested local surface water δ 18 O w values. Fluctuations in δ 18 O p values of theropod teeth from the Aptian of Thailand and Cenomanian of Morocco vary similarly to meteoric water δ 18 O mw values occurring today in subtropical regions subjected to large seasonal amounts of precipitations. A dinosaur tooth recovered from the more inland and mid-latitude Nemegt Formation of Mongolia shows a seasonal pattern similar to present-day cold temperate and continental climate. Finally, the high latitude and coastal Kakanaut Formation (Russia) experienced strongly dampened seasonal variations, most likely due to the influence of warm Pacific oceanic currents. Such conditions occur today in high latitude regions submitted to marine influence. These results further highlight the potential of using the oxygen isotope compositions of large theropod teeth to reconstruct past seasonal variations of terrestrial climates. Increased knowledge of past seasonality may help to better understand the complex interactions between climate and the dynamics of land biodiversity in terms of ecological adaptations, biogeography and the evolutionary history of organisms."
