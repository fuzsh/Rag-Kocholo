        "text": "May 11, 2022 Edition\n\nBy Mason Clark, Karolina Hird, and Kateryna Stepanenko\n\nClick here to download the report (PDF).\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a guide to the current command structure of the Russian Armed Forces at the General Staff, Military District, and Army/Corps levels. It includes key officers in the Russian General Staff and identifies the commander, chief of staff, and deputy commander for Russia’s four main military districts and their subordinate army and corps-level formations. The current officers occupying each of those roles are included, as well as their biography and verifiable career history.\n\nThis document is not exhaustive, and ISW will update it over time—both to fill information gaps and to expand its coverage to other key structures in the Russian military. This document was assembled using entirely open sources. We have confirmed all of the information herein to the best of our abilities, though there are necessarily gaps—including both unknown officers at different command positions as well as gaps in the biographies of individual officers. We will periodically update this document as new information becomes available and when the occupants of the currently included positions change. We will also expand this document over time to cover other echelons and components of the Russian military. As of now, this document notably does not include Russia’s Northern Military District (previously known as the Northern Fleet), officers at the division echelon and below, the heads of the Russian military’s various Directorates, and branch chiefs.\n\nWe intend this publication as a resource for the military, government, and other researchers. This guide does not include analysis of the implications of Russian career paths, the skills of individual officers, or forecasts of changes in the Russian command structure. We offer it as a resource to policymakers, military researchers, the media, and other NGOs both as a reference and ideally as a springboard for future research – such as identifying the officers responsible for Russian atrocities in Ukraine. We welcome suggestions on use cases or further improvements. We intend to produce updated editions in the future.\n\nAcronyms\n\nCAA- Combined Arms Army\n\nWMD- Western Military District\n\nEMD- Eastern Military District\n\nSMD- Southern Military District\n\nCMD- Central Military District\n\nLNR- Luhansk People’s Republic\n\nDNR- Donetsk People’s Republic\n\nCSTO- Collective Security Treaty Organization\n\nGUR- Ukraine's Main Intelligent Directorate\n\nKIA- Killed in Action\n\nRussian General Officer Ranks\n\nRussian general officer ranks do not align with their US equivalents. Brief notes on each rank and their US equivalents are as follows:\n\nMarshall of the Russian Federation is equivalent to a US five-star general of the Army\n\nNo Russian officers currently hold this rank, and the only post-Soviet officer to hold this rank was Minister of Defense Igor Sergeyev from 1997 to 2006.\n\nArmy general/general of the army is equivalent to a US four-star general\n\nDefense Minister Shoigu, Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov, and Gerasimov’s two most-likely successors—SMD Commander Dovrnikov and Aerospace Forces Commander in Chief Surovikin—hold this rank.\n\nThe title of “army general” is not connected to the ground forces, as evidenced by Aerospace Forces Commander in Chief Surovikin.\n\nColonel general is equivalent to a US three-star lieutenant general\n\nMilitary district commanders and more-experienced army commanders typically hold this rank.\n\nLieutenant general is equivalent to a US two-star major general\n\nArmy commanders and chiefs of staff (typically under colonel generals) typically hold this rank.\n\nMajor general is equivalent to a US one-star brigadier general\n\nArmy chiefs of staff and division commanders typically hold this rank.\n\nRussian General Staff\n\nChief of General Staff: Army General Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov\n\nGerasimov graduated from the Kazan Suvorov Military School in 1973.[1] Gerasimov then graduated from the Kazan Higher Tank Command School in 1977.

In 1996, he was appointed head of the 392nd Pacific Center for the Training of Junior Specialists of Motorized Rifle Troops. He served as chief of staff and then commander of the 35th CAA from 1996 to 2006. From 2006 to 2008, Bogdanovsky served as deputy commander of the Far Eastern Military District.

Rudskoy participated in both the First Chechen War from 1994 to 1996 and the Second Chechen War from 1999 to 2009. Rudskoy commanded the 255th Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1995, but his other assignments are unknown. His exact activities between the Chechen campaigns and 2015 are also unknown. In 2012 he was awarded the rank of lieutenant general. Rudskoy was appointed head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff on November 24, 2015, and reportedly took part in the Russian military operation in Syria in an unspecified role in 2015.[12] Rudskoy has become the Russian Ministry of Defense’s main spokesperson throughout the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, releasing daily video briefings on the Kremlin’s framing of the war.\n\nGround Forces of the Russian Federation\n\nCommander-in-Chief of Russian Ground Forces: Army General Oleg Leonidovich Salyukov\n\nSalyukov began his career moving up the ranks (platoon commander, company commander, battalion chief of staff, and battalion commander) in the Kyiv Military District of the Soviet Union from 1977 to 1982.[13] From 1985 to 1994, Salyukov served as deputy commander of an unspecified training tank regiment, commander of an unspecified tank regiment, and finally deputy commander of the 4th Guards Tank Kantemirovskaya Division of the Moscow Military District, though the exact dates are unknown for these three positions.

Salyukov then commanded the Far Eastern Military District from 2008 to 2010—an unusual change, as Russian officers typically change military districts when moving from chief of staff to Commander. President Medvedev appointed him deputy chief of the Russian General Staff in 2010. Putin appointed Salyukov commander-in-chief of the Russian Ground Forces in 2014.\n\nFirst Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Russian Ground Forces: Colonel General Vasily Petrovich Tonkoshkurov\n\nTonkoshkurov began his career as a platoon commander in an unknown unit of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and then served as company and deputy battalion commander of the 371st Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment from 1983 to 1985.[14] He took part in the Soviet action in Afghanistan with an unknown unit, where he was wounded.

He was awarded the rank of colonel general in 2015 and has been the first deputy commander-in-chief of Russian Ground Forces since May 16, 2018.\n\nDeputy Commander-in-Chief of Russian Ground Forces: Lieutenant General Alexander Anatolyevich Matovnikov\n\nMatovnikov is the son of a former KGB deputy Directorate head.[15] Matovnikov entered service in the anti-terrorist unit “A” of the KGB (now special unit “Alpha” of the FSB) in 1986. He took part in operations in northern Afghanistan from 1986 to 1987. He took part in security operations for political events in 1987 and 1988, including a trip to the US with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and providing security for UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she visited Armenia in 1988. He additionally took part in several operations in the North Caucasus, Chechnya, and North Ossetia.

His other postings in the 1990s are unknown. Zhuravlyov graduated from the Military Academy of the Russian General Staff and became Chief of Staff of the 58th CAA in 2008 and took part in Russian operations in Georgia the same year. From 2010 to 2015, Zhuravlyov commanded the 2nd Red Banner CAA and then became deputy commander of the CMD in 2015. He served as the first chief of staff of Russian forces in Syria from September 2015 to July 2016 before taking over as commander of Russian Forces in Syria from Aleksandr Dvornikov from July 2016 to December 2016.[17] Zhuravlyov became deputy chief of the Russian General Staff in 2017 and then commander of the EMD later that year, during which time he returned to command Russian forces in Syria for a second tour from December 2017 to September 2018.

After his graduation, Zavizion took command of the 136th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade.[19] He served in this capacity until 2014, when he became the Chief of Staff of the 41st CAA.[20]\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reports that Zavizion oversaw Russian military operations in Donbas in 2015.[21] Zavizion reportedly commanded the First Army Corps (the Donetsk People’s Republic’s Armed Forces) of the SMD in 2015 under the pseudonym Alexei Vladimirovich Pivelin in Donbas.[22] Zavizion was also reportedly the deputy commander for the border territories in Khmeimim airbase, Syria, in 2016.[23] Zavizion rose to commander of the 41st CAA of the CMD from 2016 to 2018.

Yershov’s activities between those two graduations are not publicly documented. Yershov commanded the 21st Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade in Totskoye in Orenburg Oblast from 2012 to 2014, lectured at the Russian Military Academy of the General Staff from 2014 to 2017, and served as chief of staff of the 49th CAA from 2017 to 2019.[36] Yershov took command of the 6th CAA in February 2019 and remains in this position as of publication.[37] Ukrainian sources reported that Yershov was dismissed and placed under house arrest on March 22, 2022, due to losses suffered by the 6th CAA during the invasion of Ukraine; the Ukrainian GUR reported on April 22 that Yershov had been removed from his post, but ISW cannot independently confirm these reports.[38]\n\nChief of Staff of the 6th Combined Arms Army: Unknown\n\nInformation about the current Chief of Staff is not publicly available.\n\nDeputy Commander of the 6th Combined Arms Army: Unknown\n\nInformation about the current Deputy Commander is not publicly available.\n\n20th Guards Combined Arms Army\n\nCommander of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army: Lieutenant General Andrey Sergeevich Ivanaev\n\nIvanaev entered military service in 1992 upon his graduation from the Chelyabinsk Higher Tank Command School.[39] Ivanaev began his career as a tank platoon commander in the 409th Motorized Rifle Regiment (part of the Group of Russian Forces in Transcaucasia) and commanded the 27th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade for an unspecified period, and likely rose through the standard Russian promotion path in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Liina commanded a nuclear submarine missile cruiser from the 11th submarine division of the Northern Fleet from 1999 to 2004. He continued to rise through the ranks of the Northern Fleet from 2006 to 2010, serving for unspecified dates as chief of staff, then commander of a submarine division, and eventually deputy commander of the Northern Fleet’s submarine forces. In 2010, he took command of the White Sea Naval Base in Severodvinsk and was promoted to vice admiral in 2012.
