The covers are rubbed and the edges darkened with slight wear to the corners and the head & tail of the spine. 99 & [1] pages, illustrated with a full-page black & white self-portrait as a frontispiece, profuse black & white illustrations and 4 tipped-in color plates. The edges of the endpapers and pastedowns are darkened with some staining to the inner edge of the rear endpaper. A few page corners are bumped. Good.\n\nThe entire text is in Cyrillic with no English translations.\n\nThe Soviet Russian artist Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov (1885-1964) was a student of Konstantin Korovin. After his studies he joined the Makovets group. His early watercolors, which were influenced by modernism, are considered by many to be masterpieces. Although his paintings and posters in the style of Socialist Realism were sympathetic to the Communist regime, he was thought of as a liberal thinker and in aesthetic opposition to those preferred by Joseph Stalin. Demoted from his position as director of the Russian Artists' Union, he and many of the faculty and student body of the Surikov Art Institute were moved from Moscow to Samarkand during the war. An old oriental caravan city, Samarkand served as an inspiration for his paintings of the period. When Krushchev took over after Stalin's death, Sergey Gerasimov found himself back in the good graces of the new regime and re-instated as head of the Russian Artists' Union.\n\nSCARCE."
