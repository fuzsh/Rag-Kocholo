        "text": "Valery Ivanovich Levanidov (Russian: Валерий Иванович Леванидов ) was one of the prominent Russian painters of his era. He was born in Riga, Latvia. The artist received an excellent art education. He studied under Artur W. Fonvizin, Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov and Alexander Osmerkin at the state art school Vkhutemas.\n\nThe foundations of Levanidov’s art included truthful portrayals of nature, clear and innocent compositions and sincere tones. The artist’s early paintings are characterized by an intimate lyricism as well as a wise insight to the innermost beauty of the world. Valery Levanidov brilliantly captured the finest nuances of color using subtones in a poetic manner.\n\nThe painter had a natural gift for seeing unique features in ordinary things. Unassuming subjects like autumnal leaves or a grove of trees could be transformed into the extraordinary as Levanidov could recognize and portray the connection between nature and the spirit world of mankind.\n\nWide inner scale is characteristic in the content of Levanidov's small paintings like those you can see here at etsy.\n\nLevanidov is just not painting leaves, trees, and sky. Instead he is expressing his admiration for their innermost beauty as interpreted by a master of his craft.\n\nMany oil paintings from 1970 however are declarative of this style. Light effects, outright ornamentality, poetics of plastic and colorific generalizations are illustrative of them.\n\nIn 1984 a personal exhibition of Valery Levanidov’s works was held in Moscow. This was the first time the general public had an opportunity to see all his art works - both oils and water colours -collected together. The exhibition was a major success. Representatives from more than 16 state museums of the former Soviet Union wanted to acquire his art works for their collections.\n\nNow more than 20 state museums in Russia as well as private art collection in the states and Europe have the artist's works in their collections. The museums include the state Russian Museum of St. Petersburg, State Historical Museum in Moscow, The Museum of Moscow, the Nizhny Novgorod State Museum of Art and many other prominent state museums.\n\nThe art works origin from Valery Levanidov’s heirs."
