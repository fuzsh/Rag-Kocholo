According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the court “failed to live up to expectations and did not become a truly independent body of international justice”.\n\nResponding to the warrants, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stressed at the time that the documents had “no meaning for Russia”."
