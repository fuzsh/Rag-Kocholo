        "text": "Announcement of the auction ArtSale.info No. 62. Tselkov, AES+F, Kulik, Latyshev, Nemukhin, Steinberg and others. March 10–16, 2021\n\nSubmitted by: Владимир Богданов\n\non Wed, 03/10/2021 - 12:01\n\nOne of the main and most expensive Russian nonconformists. His name has been heard even by those with little interest in fine art. After all, stories about Tselkov can be found several times in the prose of Sergei Dovlatov. One of the most famous is in “Solo on Underwood” — about how the artist set prices for his paintings. He did it in a very peculiar way. And all because one day the artist severely underestimated his painting.\n\nAnnouncement of the auction ArtSale.info No. 23. Silis, Lemport, Ney, Kulik, Nemukhin, Gerasimov, Gintovt and others. May 27 — June 2, 2020\n\nSubmitted by: Владимир Богданов\n\non Wed, 05/27/2020 - 12:01\n\nThe sculpture “Don Quixote” is a programmatic work in the works of Nikolai Silis — the artist of the innovative group of sculptors of the sixties “LeSS” (Lemport-Silis-Sidur). Usually Don Quixote is portrayed as a grotesque character — ridiculous, with a weirdo lost in time. And here is a completely different Don Quixote. Don Quixote is happy. Peaceful, sitting in lotus position and admiring a wildflower. A sort of Zen Quixote. Comprehending the meanings. And the mills? What are mills? Perhaps only part of the game, the role and social camouflage."
