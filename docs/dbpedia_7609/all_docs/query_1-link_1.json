        "meta_description": "Sensation im Zirkus: Directed by Michael Curtiz. With Dolores Costello, Louise Dresser, Rockliffe Fellowes, Jason Robards Sr.. Circus artist Alicia deserts her husband and child to elope with Underwood, her handsome lover. Fifteen years later, Alicia's deserted daughter Annie Martin is a trapeze performer in a Coney Island sideshow operated by Mr. and Mrs. Chubb, and has married Howard Jeffries in spite of opposition by his wealthy parents. Jeffries, Sr., hires a man--Underwood--to separate the young couple. Underwood convinces the newlyweds that each is being unfaithful to the other, and consequently he is threatened by Howard. Driven to fury by Underwood's uncontrollable demands, Alicia shoots him in a quarrel and makes her escape just as Howard enters; despite his innocence, Howard confesses to the crime when subjected to the third degree. Annie, realizing her mother's guilt, claims to be guilty, but Alicia then confesses. Annie is saved from suicide by Howard, and they are united by love.",

        "text": "Among the several good decisions made by the Warners in the 1920s - to employ Daryl F. Zanuck, to recruit Rin Tin Tin in some enduring action adventures, and to get the sound revolution started - a less fanfared decision was to bring then 40 year old director Michael Curtiz over from Hungary. However he was an acquisition that boosted the Warners' fortunes for decades.\n\nCurtiz had a real talent for lighting and the camera, and apparently was just crazy about dissolves, but the New York Times review said that he used them wisely and well. This film in particular involves a circus, a murder, and the titular \"third degree\" that a murder suspect is given where the police are trying to sweat out a confession. Delores Costello was the featured player here - and she got good reviews but remember WB did not have a big budget for big stars at this point in their history.\n\nAlso note that WB continued to put musical numbers as preludes to their film to show off their Vitaphone sound system. Here Paul Whiteman and his orchestra as well as Frank McGlynn reciting the Gettysburg address were featured, hopefully not at the same time.\n\nNothing is more fun than watching Warner Brothers grow up."
