        "text": "First Impressions\n\nHaving heard the title of this film several times by my parents, I was definitely intrigued by what it was about and honestly I did not expect it to be as engaging and entertaining as it actually was as I have never really been a fan of black and white films. However, it definitely exceeded my expectations and offered me an insight into the historical context of Morocco and its influence during World War 2. Prior to watching the film ,I did not have any knowledge on its significance and did not even know where it was situated in the world. What fascinated me the most however, was the style the film was shot. The long takes and movement of the camera across the highly designed sets was significant in creating a sense of realism whilst the institution of Warner brothers flaunted their wealth to the competing pool of filmmakers in Hollywood.\n\nGeneral context of film in the 20th century\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, Hollywood began to dominate the world of film. Whilst lots of countries took film as an artistic medium very seriously sticking to the same styles to deliver political messages to their audiences, American film was had more enjoyed as a past time and was funded commercially in a way in which the directors made the films an used the money from the successful films to fund their next film.\n\nHowever due to the huge economic problems occurring in America, fragmented , independent studios began competing , breeding a a sense of innovation in which catalysed a massive surge of film production across Hollywood. Powerhouses of film were created including the Warner Brothers ,who produced Casablanca in 1942, and audiences could identify which institution made each film as they had little collaboration with each other and took on their own artistic styles.\n\nWith the competitiveness of the institutions, there were strict , aggressive contracts enforced on their actors in which stars were locked in to picture deals of a certain amount of films. This promoted the rise of stars in Hollywood as each film star was recognised and associated with a particular institution and there were paid extortionate amounts of money for their deals; the studio protected their assets this way.\n\nWith the outbreak of the second World War , this star system was disrupted and the contract system inevitably failed. However, this was vital because studios in other countries such as Germany and the soviet Union were not given the funding, due to the funding being given on the war , and therefore, American film boomed during this period.Following the war, tastes obviously changed with the loss of innocence across the states and people began to stop going to the cinema with the introduction of televisions in society in the 1950’s, undermining the powerhouses in Hollywood.\n\nThe social changes of the 1960’s saw an increase in liberal attitudes towards sex, the empowerment of women and teenagers as a significant proportion of the society.This saw a new generation of filmmakers who began making films to suit the new audience’s tastes and interests, taking influence from foreign filmmakers and producing things that had never been seen before in America: American people had never watched foreign films before.Advances in film technology made this possible.\n\nGeneral Context of Casablanca\n\nEveryone today has heard of Casablanca due to the way it has been viewed our time, Although it was not that influential when it was released, it is fairly popular today.It represented the classic , well-known Warner House style that was liked and appreciated by then.\n\nThe American film about WW2 .made during WW2, was watched by people who experienced the war.\n\nJack Warner portrayed a his beliefs in a message that America should join the war and fight.\n\nHumphrey Bogart\n\nBogart was a huge star in Hollywood and pursed a long-lasting career in the film industry.As a cultural icon, his role as Rich Blaine in Casablanca was hugely recognised and appreciated by the Warner House audience. As the character of Rick, Bogart portrayed his role through stylistic performance aspects including his stern ,emotionless expression, characterising him as the expected man in the time of social patriarchy. Despite women getting the vote in America in 1920, there was much more that needed to be done for women’s rights in America at the time that the film was produced particular during the outbreak of the war when women took on the labour roles that men were expected to fulfil. As the main protagonist in the film, Rick is shown to have fallen in love with a woman named … who , when confronted by her presence in his bar at the beginning of the film, completely transforms his character into one that does put himself out for other people, even though he repeatedly says he does it for nobody. This is especially significant in highlighting the social hypocrisies in which men are expected not to show emotion. Despite this interpretation however, Warner still represents him outwardly as “manly” particularly because he expresses his own interests of wanting American men to fight in the war. Under his “facade of cynicism”, we can only explore true character of Rich through his outward actions, particularly at the ed of the film when he chooses to help his lover and her husband escape the Gestapo and flee to America. This is significant in providing a sense of nationalism and viewing America as a safe haven where you are protected from the violence of the war.\n\nIngrid Bergham\n\nThe well-known, Swedish actress Bergham plays the leading role as Isla Lund in Casablanca. As a character she is presented as the stereotypical woman; she is beautiful and therefore good for the audience to look at. Stylistically , Warner uses lighting to highlight her significance, and equally her beauty, especially when she appears at the bar at the beginning of the film. Since the rest of the women in the bar are in the background, Isla is centralised and therefore appears important.Despite fulfilling the typical role of a woman in the film, it soon becomes apparent that despite being married to Victor Lazlo she fell in love with another man , Rick, and was debating running away with him which is definitely unconventional and potentially seen as radical for her to make those prerogative decisions.What’s more, women were expected to be silent and submissive however she speaks her mind throughout the film and will not be lessened by any man. The lighting in her eyes make her eyes look sparkly, emphasising her beauty further. Warner potentially uses the role of Isla as political propaganda for reasons why America should join in the war. Making links to similar methods of propaganda in England at the time ( the posters of women telling their husbands and sons to fight), it is clear that Rick and Victor would both do anything for her, even potentially fight in the war for her.The ending of the film where Rick helps the pair escape shows just how far he is willing to go for her, despite the potential consequences of being arrested or put in a concentration camp by the Gestapo.The role of Isla is a pivotal one since she is the one that pushes forward the narrative.\n\nMajor Heinrich Strasser\n\nThe presentation of Strasser in the film is clearly a significant aspect both stylistically and within the contexts of the film. As a German he is immediately characterized as the “evil” character, since the film was produced at the time of WW2, and is therefore disliked immediately from the audience; he appears as a threat.The performative and mise-en-scene choices are especially key into establishing his role as he wears a smart Nazi uniform and moves around calculatedly and mysteriously; we are distanced from him and our focus turns to Rick and Ugarte. It can be said that Warner highlights the Germans as ” evil” to establish to the America people who the real threat are. When Rick shoots him and essentially saves the day , as the typical Propp hero would,Warner hints that defeating the Germans is the heroic thing to do.\n\nHistorical/Political\n\nThe setting is a really significant part of the film as the Moroccan city was used as a place of refuge for “prisoners of the war” and people seeking safety after their town had been invaded.What I think is particularly significant about the setting is that the American audience ,who were watching the film when it was released, probably would have never been or seen anything about Morocco and Warner potentially highlights its significance through the film to potentially show how the war is affecting different places all over the world and promote the fear that the German’s fascism may eventually take over the world if America do not intervene.\n\nEqually regarding the importance of Casablanca to the war, the film was further released in 1943 in a meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill who ,at the time, were in Casablanca; they believed it would serve as good propaganda for the American people to want to sign up ad fight. Although released after the Americans decided to intervene, it was being made in the time just when the decision to fight was being made.\n\nCasablanca arguably allowed the progression or “trend” of foreign policy in America in which began focusing on interventionism as a way to promote American nationality and be the “world policemen” to resolve European issues. The choice Equally, the economic gains of being part of the war distanced America further economically as the economy boosted when the allied countries began on relying on loans from America to finance the military and stabilize their own economies."
