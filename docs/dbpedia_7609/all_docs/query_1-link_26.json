        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1886–1962). Hungarian-born American motion-picture director Michael Curtiz worked on many solid but run-of-the-mill genre films. He also directed a string of motion-picture classics that included Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), Casablanca (1942), and Mildred Pierce (1945). He was known as well for directing numerous adventure films that starred Errol Flynn, most notably Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), and The Sea Hawk (1940).\n\nLittle is known about Curtiz’s early life. He left no autobiography, and he was seldom interviewed. He frequently gave different accounts of himself, including about when he was born. His birth certificate, however, says that he was born on December 25, 1886, in Budapest, Austria-Hungary (now in Hungary). He was born under the name Mano Kaminer, and he was later also called Mihály Kertész and Michael Courtice.\n\nIt seems likely that Curtiz grew up in an upper middle-class Jewish family and that his mother was a concert singer. He may have joined a traveling circus for a short time during his teens. He attended college and then studied acting at Budapest’s Royal Academy of Theatre and Art.\n\nEarly Work\n\nCurtiz made his stage debut in Budapest in 1910 before starring in (and perhaps directing) the first feature film released by the Hungarian film industry, Today and Tomorrow (1912). After directing some films in Hungary, he spent six months in Denmark. There he starred in director August Bloom’s Atlantis (1913).\n\nCurtiz’s service in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I ended when he was wounded. He made fund-raising documentaries for the Red Cross and then returned to directing commercial films. By 1916, with many silent films to his credit, he had become one of Hungary’s most important directors. However, he left the country in 1919 after the communist government’s brief takeover of the film industry. He then began working in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIn 1926 Jack Warner, the vice president in charge of production at Warner Brothers, invited Curtiz to Hollywood, California. That was the beginning of Curtiz’s 28-year career with the company. After a short time directing silent films, Curtiz made the part-sound films Tenderloin and Noah’s Ark (both 1928). As Warner Brothers scrambled to keep pace with other, better-funded studios, its directors worked often and quickly. Curtiz was no exception. In the early 1930s he directed multiple films each year, including dramas, musicals, romantic comedies, and horror films.\n\nCurtiz made his breakthrough in 1933 with the prison film 20,000 Years in Sing Sing, starring Spencer Tracy as a doomed inmate. Just as impressive was Mystery of the Wax Museum. The other five films that Curtiz directed that year were less memorable, as were many from 1934. Of note, however, was Jimmy the Gent (1934)—the first of several successful collaborations with James Cagney. Films that Curtiz directed in 1935 included Black Fury, starring Paul Muni; the mystery The Case of the Curious Bride; and Front Page Woman, starring Bette Davis. That same year Captain Blood, a classic swashbuckler, was phenomenally successful. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture. It also made a star of Flynn, boosted the fortunes of Olivia de Havilland, and lifted Curtiz’s career to a whole new level.\n\nIn 1936 Flynn and de Havilland were reteamed (as they often would be) in The Charge of the Light Brigade. This big-budget period film was inspired by the poem of the same name by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. However, its setting was transferred from the Crimean War to India. Also released in 1936 was The Walking Dead, a horror film featuring Boris Karloff as an unjustly executed man who returns from the grave to exact vengeance.\n\nAlthough by the mid-1930s Warner Brothers was on much stronger financial footing and had begun to slow its filmmaking pace to include period films, Curtiz remained very busy. Films he directed in 1937 included Stolen Holiday, starring Kay Francis and Claude Rains, and the comedy The Perfect Specimen, in which Flynn portrayed a hard-boiled reporter. Curtiz’s most-notable film of the year was Kid Galahad (also released as The Battling Bellhop), a boxing film with Edward G. Robinson in the role of a promoter.\n\nThe Late 1930s and the 1940s\n\nIn 1938 Curtiz directed The Adventures of Robin Hood. It became the studio’s biggest commercial success of the year. A Hollywood swashbuckler, it combined Flynn’s swagger, de Havilland’s beauty, and Rains’s and Basil Rathbone’s villainy. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold won for best score. That same year Curtiz directed Four Daughters, a drama about the small-town lives and loves of a pianist’s daughters. John Garfield’s performance as one of the suitors earned him an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, and Curtiz was nominated for best director. Curtiz simultaneously was nominated for best director for the gangster classic Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). In that movie Cagney and Pat O’Brien played childhood friends who grow up in opposite directions, one a gangster idolized by the neighborhood ruffians and the other a priest who wants to save their souls.\n\nCurtiz’s efforts in 1939 included the western Dodge City, with Flynn and de Havilland, and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, an adaptation of the Maxwell Anderson play. Also that year he directed Daughters Courageous, a virtual remake of Four Daughters, with a nearly identical cast and plot, and Four Wives, the actual sequel to Four Daughters.\n\nIn 1940 Flynn starred in several Curtiz vehicles, including the western Virginia City and the action-adventure The Sea Hawk, which became a huge hit. Curtiz’s final effort of 1940, Santa Fe Trail, was a fanciful retelling of the story of abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey), with Flynn and Ronald Reagan costarring.\n\nCurtiz was much praised for his haunting 1941 film version of Jack London’s novel The Sea-Wolf, with Robinson starring as the demonic sea captain Wolf Larsen. Another 1941 release, Dive Bomber, marked the last collaboration between Flynn and Curtiz.\n\nIn 1942 two of the films for which Curtiz is best remembered were released. The musical biography Yankee Doodle Dandy starred Cagney as entertainer George M. Cohan. Cagney’s performance earned him his only Academy Award as best actor, and the film was nominated as best picture. Casablanca, the legendary World War II-era romantic drama, became one of the most popular motion pictures from Hollywood’s golden age. Humphrey Bogart delivered one of the cinema’s most-revered performances as Rick, the American owner of a café in wartime Morocco who sacrifices his chance to rekindle his romance with a former flame. Casablanca won the Academy Award as best picture, the writers won the award for their screenplay, and Curtiz won the award for best director.\n\nCurtiz’s Mission to Moscow (1943) was a dramatization of former U.S. ambassador Joseph E. Davies’s memoir about his two years in the Soviet Union. Its pro-Soviet message was politically correct when the film was released, but it drew ire during U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy’s communist witch-hunts a few years later. This Is the Army, also released in 1943, was an all-star revue based on Irving Berlin’s stage musical of the same name.\n\nBy this point in his career, Curtiz had slowed to making only one to three films per year. After a couple of unsuccessful films, he directed Mildred Pierce (1945). A film noir reworking of a novel by James M. Cain, the movie featured Joan Crawford as a mother who sacrifices everything for her spoiled daughter. Mildred Pierce was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture, and Crawford won the award for best actress.\n\nNight and Day, a biographical film that starred Cary Grant as composer Cole Porter, followed in 1946. That film and Life with Father, which was released in 1947 and starred William Powell, were box-office hits. Curtiz made another foray into film noir with his other film of 1947, The Unsuspected. His 1948 musical Romance on the High Seas marked the screen debut of Doris Day. She appeared in another Curtiz-directed musical, My Dream Is Yours, in 1949. That year Curtiz also directed the melodrama Flamingo Road and the romantic comedy The Lady Takes a Sailor.\n\nLast Films\n\nIn 1950 Curtiz directed Young Man with a Horn, starring Kirk Douglas as jazz great Bix Beiderbecke. That same year he worked on The Breaking Point, an adaptation of the novel To Have and Have Not by Ernest Hemingway. Curtiz directed three films in 1951. Force of Arms was a World War II love story. Jim Thorpe—All-American provided Burt Lancaster with one of his best roles as the Native American athlete Jim Thorpe. Finally, I’ll See You in My Dreams was a biography of songwriter Gus Kahn (played by Danny Thomas). The Story of Will Rogers followed in 1952.\n\nIn 1953 Curtiz directed The Jazz Singer, which featured Thomas and Peggy Lee in a contemporary updating of the 1927 film classic of the same name. Also that year was Trouble Along the Way, which starred John Wayne as a football coach. The Boy from Oklahoma (1954) was a western featuring Will Rogers, Jr. Later in 1954 Curtiz made the costume epic The Egyptian for Twentieth Century-Fox, and then he signed with Paramount. His first project with that studio, White Christmas (1954), proved to be the year’s biggest hit. Essentially a remake of Holiday Inn (1942), the film brought back Bing Crosby from the original and teamed him with Danny Kaye (replacing Fred Astaire). Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray played convicts who have escaped from the Devils Island prison in the whimsical We’re No Angels in 1955.\n\nIn 1956 Curtiz directed the musical The Vagabond King, the melodrama The Scarlet Hour, and the biography The Best Things in Life Are Free. He returned briefly to Warner Brothers in 1957 to make The Helen Morgan Story. The next year he was back with Paramount to direct Elvis Presley in King Creole. Also in 1958 Curtiz made The Proud Rebel for Disney, with Alan Ladd as an American Civil War veteran trying to get help for his traumatized son.\n\nIn 1959 Curtiz directed the western The Hangman and worked with Ladd again on The Man in the Net, about an artist blamed for the disappearance of his unstable wife. The next year Curtiz released two films. One was an adaptation of Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The other, A Breath of Scandal, starred Sophia Loren. Curtiz’s last movies were released in 1961: the historical drama Francis of Assisi and the western The Comancheros. Curtiz died on April 10, 1962, in Hollywood."
