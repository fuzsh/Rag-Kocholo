        "text": "The 1942 film Casablanca, directed by Michael Curtiz, has gone down in history as one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema and defines the ‘Golden Age’ of Hollywood movie making. Winning best picture, this Romantic War-Drama boasts legendary stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. It is said to have inspired almost every Hollywood movie since its release as a result of its script and revolutionary cinematography, however; it could be argued that director Michael Curtiz is, in no way, acting as an ‘auteur’ in relation to the stylistic qualities of this film. Instead, Warner Brothers (being the studio to produce the film) is demonstrating more auteur features than the director of this feature.\n\nThe film, taking place in Casablanca, Morocco during the war, follows the characters Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund who had been in love in Paris before they were pulled apart by the effects of the war. One sequence which demonstrates how the studio is, quite possibly, more of an ‘auteur’ than the director comes when we’re introduced to the location of Casablanca after a sequence of non-diegetic narration. This comes in the form of a wide crane shot showing a busy area in Casablanca and the activities that take place in this area. As the camera moves down through the street, the lavish production values of the feature are revealed and a cut doesn’t take place for a considerable amount of time as to immerse the audience in this impressive, exotic environment. The ‘house style’ that the studio Warner Brothers became famous for was, predominantly, based around their pictures consisting of urban, city environments for the action to take place in and the story to develop, therefore; this is an example of how this sequence is defined, not by the director’s artistic intent, but the studio’s previously established aesthetic.\n\nIn terms of the narrative and dialogue within a typical Warner Brothers film, Warner Brothers was known for having fast-paced back and fourth dialogue between characters that would move the plot along at a rapid rate and keep an audience entertained. This can be seen within the climatic ending to Casablanca in which we see characters Eilsa and Rick talking about their complex past, framed within a wide two shot as the camera pushes in quickly to heighten the sense of drama and emphasise the emotional importance of this moment for the audience. Warner Brothers aspired to make sequences energetic, in terms of how the narrative plays out, to keep their audience’s hooked. Their style became very famous for being dark and realistic in comparison to other studio’s productions of that era. This was because of their tendency to make crime films or dramas with realistic dialogue, which can be identified in this scene of Casablanca. This ‘house style’, at the time, was considered to be extremely fast paced and dramatic but in a way that still favoured story and empathetic, admirable protagonists in these gritty political dramas.\n\nDirector Michael Curiz started rising to prominence following his 1938 technicolour feature The Adventures Of Robin Hood which he directed for Warner Brothers. Directors like Michael Curtiz, at this time, had very little creative control in the grand scheme of the medium despite the fact that the role is now considered the most important and requiring the most stylistic decisions within the filmmaking process. However, Michael Curtiz had a lot less control over the ways in which Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) was made in comparison to, for example, Executive Producer Jack Warner. Being the co-founder of Warner Brothers, Jack Warner formed his own style simply from the genre of films he decided to finance and the atmosphere he wanted to convey throughout all of his productions, therefore providing the studio with more clearly identifiable ‘auteur features’. For example, during the final sequence within Casablanca, a hard cut takes place and we get an angled tracking shot as the camera simultaneously pushes into a Nazi driving quickly in his car. Accompanying this, is a sinister non-diegetic score which is indicative not only of whom the audience should be empathising with, but also whom Jack Warner wants the viewer to support during that time in history. This demonstrates just how much influence the studio had on the cinematic techniques utilised for film production at this time.\n\nIt could be argued that, instead of a director displaying ‘auteur features’ as a result of style and vision, the studio is what drives the overall creative vision, enforcing thematic, narrative and aesthetic ideas into Casablanca having attained their own identity over time. Casablanca is therefore a product of this. It epitomises the ways in which Warner Brothers was producing films at this time having become famous for their specific focus on political films (social dramas) and the methods of which they create them. This makes the studio itself an auteur because of this."
