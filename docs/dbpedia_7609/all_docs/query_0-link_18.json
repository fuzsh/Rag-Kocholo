        "text": "One of the most prolific directors in the history of the cinema, Hungarian-born Michael Curtiz thrived in the studio system as the top helmsman at Warner Bros. Studio in the 1930s and 40s. Tirelessly hammering out four or five films a year, Curtiz relentlessly tackled both low-budget pictures and more prestigious Oscar-baiting fare, all the while proving amazingly adept at creating lavish results on minimal budgets in a wide variety of genres. His most famous player, Errol Flynn, appeared in 12 films for him, including swashbuckler classics like \"Captain Blood\" (1935) and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). Curtiz had a knack for detecting and fostering unknown talents, including Flynn, John Garfield - whom he introduced in \"Four Daughters\" (1938) - and Doris Day, among others. His highly developed visual approach combined with his technical mastery could elevate the most mundane material, and three of his finest films - \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), \"Casablanca\" (1942) and \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945) - made a virtue of melodrama and sentimentality. Though he reached the culmination of his creative powers with \"The Breaking Point\" (1950), Curtiz entered a financially successful period with more crowd-pleasing pictures like \"White Christmas\" (1954) and \"King Creole\" (1958). Having tapped out with \"The Commancheros\" (1961), Curtiz was nonetheless a tireless director who left behind a rich legacy, some of which displayed the very best Hollywood had to offer."
