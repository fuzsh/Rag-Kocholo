        "text": "The 1942 film Casablanca, directed by Michael Curtiz, is very much a result of the studio system of the time of its release. The ‘Golden Age’ of Hollywood filmmaking (1930-1960) was defined by lavish sets, beautiful actors lit glamorously and optimistic concise storytelling. Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) arguably epitomises this era and the stylistic qualities a typical film reales by an industry that was, at that time, more of a business than an art form. Casablanca has gone down in history as one of the greatest movies in all of cinema and defines the ‘Golden Age’ of Hollywood movie making. Winning best picture, this Romantic War-Drama boasts legendary stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. It is said to have inspired almost every Hollywood movie since its release as a result of its script and revolutionary cinematography.\n\nThe film, taking place in Casablanca, Morocco during the war, follows the characters Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund who had been in love in Paris before they were pulled apart by the effects of the war. One moment which demonstrates how Warner Brothers was producing films at this time to appeal to the masses and serve the narrative, comes during the opening of the film. The camera slowly pushes into a large globe rotating to the non-diegetic sound of the narrator providing exposition about the story, establishing the main political ideas the film will be exploring. This immediately places us, as the audience, in an environment with depth. Not only does it places what follows in the context of real life but it also provides the audience with a succinct explanation as the basis for the story that follows which is an example of efficient storytelling. This was an element of filmmaking studios at this time very much cared about.\n\nThe political agenda of this opening expository sequence is a result of Jack Warner’s influence. Being the executive producer of Casablanca, his political stance and opinions in relation to the war are extremely prevalent due to the political agenda of this expository narration as he rightfully criticises the Nazis in the film. Many films made during the Golden Age were defined by having political themes and protagonists that are clearly depicted as ‘heroes’ as a method manipulating the audience’s emotions from a narrative standpoint. This opening sequence is a clear example of this as the non-diegetic narration drives the audience’s views of real life events in a particular direction politically.\n\nIn terms of cinematography, the ‘classical Hollywood style’ is often defined by, in terms of lighting, an aim to make the actors appear as glamorous as possible. Another way in which this is achieved, other than well lit sets and 3 point lighting, is using long focal lengths and wide apertures for medium shots, close ups and single shots. This often gives the image a ‘bloom’ effect as more light is being allowed into the lens and therefore making the outlines and features of actors’ faces appear softer. The medium or long focal length means that their facial features also appear less distorted and more aesthetically pleasing in terms of visuals.\n\nA clear example of this within Casablanca comes when the characters Eilsa and Lazlo first enter Rick’s cafe during the film’s first act. As a conversation around a table at the cafe takes place (between the three lead characters), the film cuts back and fourth between various medium shots and close ups at a natural rate. This is to efficiently and objectively document this significant conversation and deliver information to the audience, in favour of the story. Each of these uncluttered single shots emphasise the beauty of each actor through the framing, which tends to be central, and of course the camera work as a shallow depth of field focuses our attention entirely on the characters of Eilsa and Rick and not other subjects in the background.\n\nIt can argued that Casablanca was a film whose elements, in terms of the form of filmmaking during the ‘Golden Age’ of Hollywood, were entirely driven by a system which favours, for the most part, enticing the audience and driving the narrative forward. The ways in which this is achieved is encapsulated in Casablanca as it boasts lavish production values and pleasing, almost superficial, cinematic aesthetics."
