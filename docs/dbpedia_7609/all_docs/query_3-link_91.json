Director <b>Michael Curtiz</b>, <b>Humphrey Bogart</b> and scriptwriter <b>Herschel Daugherty</b> on the set of <i>Passage to Marseille</i>  (Michael Curtiz, 1944).\n\t\n\tHungarian-American film director <b>Michael Curtiz</b> (1886-1962) was born Manó Kaminer but was called Mihály Kertész in 1905. After completing his studies, Kertész became a film director and directed more than 40 silent films in Budapest. He left Hungary in 1919 after the film industry there was nationalised and moved to Vienna. There he directed 19 films including the colossal epics  <i>Sodom und Gomorrha/Sodom and Gomorrah</i> (1922) with Victor Varconi and Lucy Doraine and  <i>Die Sklavenkönigin/The Moon of Israel</i> (1924) with Maria Corda and Adelqui Migliar. In 1926, Curtiz moved to America and adopted the stage name 'Michael Curtiz'. By the 1940s, Curtiz was one of Warner Brothers' best-known directors of such box-office hits as  <i>Captain Blood</i> (1935),  <i>The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex</i> (1939) and  <i>Casablanca</i> (1942).

Bogart and 19-year-old Lauren Bacall fell in love when they filmed <i>To Have and Have Not</i> (1944), the first of a series of films together.
