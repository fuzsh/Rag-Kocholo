He’s not a “style-plus” director and his auteur status can’t match his own filmography (he has the #90 overall ranked filmography) but I also think he’s a stronger candidate for this list than Victor Fleming or Carol Reed. Curtiz has 17 archiveable films but obviously isn’t on this list without Casablanca. Casablanca is one of the best films of all-time and has often been called cinema’s “happy accident” (meaning a great combination of elements: writing, acting, music, etc) and is often brought up as a counter-point to the auteur theory. The problem with that theory is that Casablanca is really well directed! You can’t say it isn’t (as good as the dialogue is with Bogart and Bergman during the final scene if we didn’t have Curtiz’s choice to move the camera I think we lose 50% of the effectiveness. And more than that— it has many of the trademark shots that Curtiz does throughout his body of work. Over the years I’ve watched thousands of old movies and I’ve picked up on a slow forward crane tracking shot as intro to a scene from Curitz that he has in almost all of his films (and often times more than one). It’s an impressive shot and certainly adds to the atmosphere of whatever Warner Brothers film atmosphere he’s trying to establish. It certainly adds to Casablanca. Curtiz’s weakness for the purposes of this list is he has 1 single top 500 film. That plus he’s a style-minus director. However, the 7 films that fall in the top 100 of their specific decade shows an impressive depth!\n\nBest film: Casablanca. I’ve went on about it above so I’ll be brief here but there can be no debate about this as his best film.\n\ntotal archiveable films: 17\n\ntop 100 films: 1 (Casablanca)\n\ntop 500 films: 1 (Casablanca)\n\ntop 100 films of the decade: 7 (Captain Blood, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Dodge City, The Sea Hawk , Yankee Doodle Dandy, Casablanca, Mildred Pierce)\n\nmost overrated: Curtiz doesn’t really have one. He has three films in the TSPDT consensus top 1000: Casablanca, Mildred Pierce, and The Adventures of Robin Hood and they are all in the appropriate spot.\n\nmost underrated: Captain Blood would be my choice here. It should be somewhere in the 800-1000 range on TSPDT and it isn’t. It is the swashbuckler that started it all and really got the career or Curitz, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland going. I have four Errol Flynn films in Curtiz top 10 and you could really go with any of them as they are energetically edited spectacles.\n\ngem I want to spotlight: Mildred Pierce. Skip the Todd Haynes remake and watch the original. I think Curtiz’s direction and photography may even outshine a never-better Joan Crawford.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits: Curitz was the Warner Brothers house director for 20+ years and made great film after great film with expressive writing and nice intro-to-scene crane tracking shots. If you look below and at his entire archiveable filmography (again a very robust 17 films) he did some of the best work with Flynn, Cagney, Bogart, Crawford). It is rare for studio director to have a trademark shot or visual touch so for me to think of Curtiz every time I see an intro into a scene slow (almost imperceptible but certainly effective) crane tracking shot—I think of him.\n\ntop 10\n\nCasablanca\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood\n\nMildred Pierce\n\nCaptain Blood\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy\n\nThe Sea Hawk\n\nDodge City\n\nWhite Christmas\n\nPassage to Marseille\n\nAngels With Dirty Faces\n\nBy year and grades\n\n1935- Captain Blood HR 1938- Angels With Dirty Faces 1938- Four Daughters 1938- The Adventures of Robin Hood HR 1939- Dodge City 1939- The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex 1940- The Sea Hawk HR 1941- The Sea Wolf R 1942- Casablanca MP 1942- Yankee Doodle Dandy HR 1944- Passage to Marseille R 1945- Mildred Pierce HR 1947- Life with Father R 1950- The Breaking Point R 1954- White Christmas R 1955- We’re No Angels R 1961- The Comancheros\n\n*MP is Masterpiece- top 1-3 quality of the year film\n\nMS is Must-see- top 5-6 quality of the year film\n\nHR is Highly Recommend- top 10 quality of the year film\n\nR is Recommend- outside the top 10 of the year quality film but still in the archives"
