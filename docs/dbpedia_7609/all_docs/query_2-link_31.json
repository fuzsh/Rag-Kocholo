        "text": "Research and write about how Casablanca is an example of a product produced by an auteur institution.\n\nDuring the ‘Golden age of Hollywood’ the production companies became auteurs due to their unique and recognisable styles. This differs from the directors as they had little or no auteurship as they had little creative freedom. Casablanca can be shown as a product produced by an auteur institution because of Warner brother’s house style which is resent throughout the film.\n\nCasablanca’s auteurship is first shown during the opening scene where the Warner brothers logo is shown which is an auteur feature in their films. Jack Warner encouraged projects against European fascism and Nazi Germany and critiqued these heavily, which can be shown as prominent within his films. This is especially shown in Casablanca as Jack Warner produced the film in order to promote America into joining the war showing it as a product of an auteur institution.\n\nCasablanca is an example of a product produced by an auteur institution which is shown through Max Steiner as the composer. Max Steiner was an American theatre, film and music composer. He worked in England, in broadway and then he moved to Hollywood. There he became one of the first music composers for film. He composed films for Warner Brothers from 1937 to 1953 therefore developing Warner Brothers auteur style which is present throughout Casablanca showing it’s a product produced by an auteur institution.\n\nHal B. Wallis was a film producer in America who produced Casablanca. He also produced many other major films for Warner Bros meaning he was in control of choosing the cast. This therefore shows Casablanca as a product produced by an auteur institution as the producing and the cast would be very similar for many different Warner Brother films.\n\nCasablanca was directed by Michael Curtiz who was recognised as ‘one of the most prolific directors in history.’ He directed many films in the silent era and many others in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Curtiz was initially a ‘well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros invited him to Hollywood in 1926. Over his Hollywood career he directed 102 films (most of them at Warner Studios). This therefore shows that Casablanca is the product of an auteur institution as Curtiz’s directing style has had a huge influence on Warner Brothers as an auteur institution. Curtiz’s auteurship is shown through his visual style that he introduced into Hollywood using a range of ‘artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles’ showing Casablanca as a product of an auteur institution.\n\nWarner Brothers auteurship is shown as many of there films takes place in exotic locations. Audiences prefer to see films that are located in unknown places and therefore they are shown off by Warner Brothers. This can be shown as Rick’s diner is an expansive set which is common in many Warner brothers films. This therefore shows Casablanca as a product of an auteur institution. Additionally, the streets of Casablanca show a stark contrast to life in America with the camera craning down to show the suburban town in the opening sequence showing Warner Brothers using an exotic location to engage the audience and presenting them as part of an auteur institution.\n\nSteiner’s score can be shown to influence the viewer through his compositions. This can be shown during the opening scene of Casablanca as when the man has been pickpocketed the score turns darker and more dramatic in order to influence the audience and to show Casablanca as a dangerous place. Another example of this is towards the end of the film as when the protagonist is victorious the French National Anthem is played showing a patriotic and hopeful aesthetic. This therefore connects the audience to the film resulting in an engaging film. The repeated use of these techniques by Max Steiner in many films shows Casablanca as a product of an auteur institution.\n\nSecond version –\n\nYou cover all the right material, James, but this feels a bit clunky and formulaic. You mention the name of an individual, give a sentence of explanation, then say “this can be seen in…” and then more or less repeat that for every paragraph. You should be trying to mount a convincing argument that culminates in the conclusion that while individual contributions helped shape the film it is their work together, under the leadership of Jack Warner, that can be considered the “auteur” element. Looks a bit Band 3, right now, but you should be able to whip it into shape…\n\nDuring the ‘Golden age of Hollywood’ the production companies became auteurs due to their unique and recognisable styles. This differs from the directors as they had little or no auteurship as they had little creative freedom.

He worked in England, in broadway and then he moved to Hollywood. There he became one of the first music composers for film. He composed films for Warner Brothers from 1937 to 1953 therefore developing Warner Brothers auteur style which is present throughout Casablanca. Steiner’s involvement in Casablanca creates an aesthetic from the score which suites the film effectively which is shown to be the case in many other Warner Brothers films showing its a product produced by an auteur institution. Steiner’s score can be shown to influence the viewer through his compositions. This is present during the opening scene of Casablanca as when the man has been pickpocketed the score turns darker and more dramatic in order to influence the audience and to show Casablanca as a dangerous place.

He also produced many other major films for Warner Bros meaning he was in control of choosing the casting. Casablanca can be shown as a product produced by an auteur institution because of this as the cast would be very similar for many different Warner Brother films due to the stable of actors that they have. This stable is recognisable to Warner brother and therefore presents Casablanca as part of an auteur institution.\n\nCasablanca was directed by Michael Curtiz who was recognised as ‘one of the most prolific directors in history.’ He directed many films in the silent era and many others in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Curtiz was initially a ‘well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros invited him to Hollywood in 1926. Over his Hollywood career he directed 102 films (most of them at Warner Studios). Casablanca is represented as a product of an auteur institution as Curtiz’s directing style has had a huge influence on Warner Brothers as an auteur institution. Curtiz’s auteurship is shown through his visual style that he introduced into Hollywood using a range of ‘artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles’ presenting Casablanca as a product of an auteur institution.\n\nWarner Brothers auteurship is shown as many of there films takes place in exotic locations.

Additionally, the streets of Casablanca show a stark contrast to life in America with the camera craning down to show the suburban town in the opening sequence showing Warner Brothers using an exotic location to engage the audience and presenting them as part of an auteur institution.\n\nOverall, Casablanca is a product produced by an auteur institution which is shown as many of the elements of filmmaking within Casablanca are representative of the general style of WarnerBrothers studios. Casablanca is extremely recognisable as a product of WarnerBrothers Studios because of elements such as cinematography, sound and the general production of the film and the people involved presenting it as a product of an auteur institution."
