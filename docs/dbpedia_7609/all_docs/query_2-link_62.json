        "text": "Write an exam style answer.\n\n•Consult the course Overview.\n\n•Read through the Component 1a section of this website.\n\n•Plan your response carefully.\n\n•Format your blog post with the following distinct sections:\n\n1.Question (copied carefully from below)\n\n2.Planning (bullet points or a mind map)\n\n3.Version 1 (carefully proof-read)\n\n4.Version 2 (for later use)\n\n•Answer the following question from the Sample Assessment Materials:\n\nCompare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers\n\nIntroduction: what are the films’ differences in how they reflect auteurship. Casablanca produced in The Golden Age of Hollywood: lack of director freedom, vertical integration – in-house expenses. Bonnie and Clyde was made during The New Hollywood Era: Arthur Penn had more creative freedom to have a French New Wave style. Casablanca has little control/freedom, Bonnie and Clyde has narrative and technological freedom\n\nDifferences:\n\n-Signature style – Warner Bros.’s style in the war was pro-American intervention. Institutions became auteurs due to their unique and recognisable styles – directors had little or no auteurship – limited creative freedom. Warner Bros.’s house style is present throughout the film. Warner brothers logo is shown which is an auteur feature. Jack Warner used real news footage in the opening sequence, and in the Paris sequence to show an audience this was real, and not just part of the film. Bonnie and Clyde features depictions of the Depression, but the issue had passed, so the filmmakers are not trying to convey a message. Arthur Penn had no consistent style, because he had creative freedom to make whatever films he wanted.\n\nFrench influence: Bonnie and Clyde took inspiration from The French New Wave. Realist themes. Opening sequence analysis. Closing sequence makes visual reference to Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1960) – a famous French film in the French New Wave style. Michel Pioccard’s glasses lens came out, before meeting an untimely death, like Clyde does\n\nCasablanca: large, exotic sets, intricate details, hundreds of extras, large budget shown off – signature of Warner Bros. style\n\nBonnie and Clyde: shot on-location, extras are locals, smaller budget, no grand spectacles, sets are minimalist – signature of the French New Wave Style\n\nTV: television effected the popularity of cinema. In the Golden Age, few TVs were sold, and new channels were broadcast in the south. Competition between studios and TV. 8 main studios suffered, Anti trust case weakened them, allowed independent and French films to influence independent filmmakers. This began the French influence in cinema: clear contrast between the styles of Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde, reflecting their different auteur signatures and institutional contexts\n\nSimilarities:\n\n-Creative staff\n\n-Max Steiner composed music for Warner Bros. between 1937 and 1953 – helped develop Warner Bros.’s style. Selects and composes music that best fits the film. Does this is other Warner Bros. films, showing it is a signature style. ‘As Time Goes By’ is expertly placed, and goes from diegetic to non-diegetic seamlessly in the Paris sequence. Score is manipulative – end of the Leaving Rick’s sequence when Ilsa leaves with Laszlo: drops an octave to show Rick is sad. Shows Casablanca. Is the product of an institution, as music and scores are a large part of Warner Bros. films. Minimal non-diegetic sound in Bonnie and Clyde, except bluegrass music which represents the time and place the film is set in\n\n-Hall B. Wallis – film producer for Warner Bros. – he was in control of choosing the casting – the cast is a large part of the studios auteurship, as actors were the face of the film. Wallis selected Ingrid Bergman, as she was young, pretty and relatable (after failing to contract Hedy Lamarr). Warren Beatty was the producer for Bonnie and Clyde. He selected actors he knew. Beatty is responsible for the depiction of Clyde as an unconventional male character. He greatly influenced the auteur style for Bonnie and Clyde\n\nMichael Curtiz – Directed 102 films in his career, most for Warner Bros. he introduced many new camera techniques and ways of lighting – for example, using a soft focus for Ilsa to blur her background, giving her a ‘halo’ effect. He used fluid camera movements, resembling the modern SteadiCam. Casablanca reflects the auteur signature style due to Curtiz’s influence. Arthur Penn does not have a signature style. He has the freedom to change his approach to film. Instead, Newman and Benton are the ones who influenced the French Style of the film. They approached Francois Truffaut for input on the film – he did not direct the film, but he influenced the film. The film looks the way it does as a result of his input\n\nCasablanca conclusion: many of the elements of filmmaking within Casablanca are representative of the general style of WarnerBrothers studios. Casablanca is extremely recognisable as a product of WarnerBrothers Studios because of elements such as cinematography, sound\n\nBonnie and Clyde conclusion: very different in all elements of film form. Indicative of a French New Wave style. More creative freedom for the director, but screenwriters has more freedom as a result of the weakening Hays Code, and changing times. Bonnie and Clyde has a clear French influence: New Hollywood featured edgy stories contrasting with Hollywood’s ‘happy endings.’ Independent films are often distinguishable from films produced by a large production company as their style and their content present the filmmaker’s artistic vision and not the production companies vision\n\nOverall conclusion: The films are reflections of the auteur signature features which is shown by the house style in Casablanca, compared to the influence of The French New Wave in Bonnie and Clyde. Purpose of making the films differ due the contexts that they were made: Bonnie and Clyde was made as a representation of the lives of those living in the Depression, and Casablanca for a political agenda. Both films are the products of different goals\n\nCompare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers\n\nThe auteur theory was introduced by Andre Bazin. The theory suggests that the director oversees all aspects of the film, making it fit into a particular aesthetic so that it is easily recognisable as their film. The director would then be considered the ‘author’ of the film. The auteur theory became relevant in 1930-1960, as the ‘Big 5 and Little 3’ were ‘churning out’ stylistically similar films to meet the demands of the audience, rather than creating a film with a personal meaning. Casablanca and Bonnie and Clyde are very different films due to their auteur influences, but also the times in which they were made. Institutional and political contexts influence that auteur’s approach to the filmmaking process. For example, Casablanca aimed to make the American public support American intervention in the war, and Bonnie and Clyde aimed to show an audience what a film should look like by being stylistically and thematically unique.\n\nCasablanca is a romanticised story about the struggle to get to America in late 1941. The film is centrally about Rick and Ilsa who, despite their love for each other, must part for the greater good. It is a film about selflessness, patriotism and supports American intervention in the war.\n\nMichel Curtiz is not an auteur on his own – Casablanca was the product of many different people – but the film still has a distinct style, reflecting the Warner Bros. house style, suggesting it is the product of a studio (or institutional) auteur. During the Classic Hollywood era, the 8 main studios dominated the industry by a process called vertical integration, and essentially oligopolised the industry; each studio (except Columbia) had theatre chains, distribution and exhibition rights, and some even manufactured their own equipment. All costs were ‘in-house’, which cut costs, and maximised profits. All the main studios had a ‘stable of actors’ who they had in ‘unbreakable contracts’, but Warner Bros. did not do this – instead, they had a ‘stable of creative staff’. This ‘stable of creative staff’ is the reason Casablanca has a distinct style.\n\nJack Warner acted as the executive producer – his influence is seen throughout the film, as he wanted to convince the American audience to support American intervention in the war. To do this, Warner used real news footage of refugees in the opening sequence, and during the occupation of Paris – this showed an audience that this was real, and not just a fictitious rendition of war-time events. He used real news footage, and showed the panic in Paris to remind an audience that the allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty and uncomfortable. Hal B Wallis is another important person who helped develop the studio auteurship: he selected the actors for each film, which gave recognisable faces to the patriotic messages Jack Warner was conveying.\n\nMax Steiner was also important in developing the Warner Bros. institutional auteurship. Steiner was one of the first to write musical scores for film – in fact, he was often referred to as ‘the father of film music’. His influences can be heard throughout. He expertly created scores that manipulated an audience, added drama to a scene, and more specifically, made the closing sequence all the more emotional. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson was also crucial in helping to create the distinct aesthetic seen in Casablanca. Edeson began his career as a photographer, giving him a creative advantage in his cinematography career. He experimented with shadows and lighting techniques to give a film more depth and detail, making him stand out at a time where many films were stylistically similar. His creative input as to how Ilsa was lit and framed, made her look innocent and youthful – this had an emotional impact on an audience. This technique is also used at the end with Rick, to show how he has changed from selfish and cynical to selfless and patriotic.\n\nMichael Curtiz introduced new lighting techniques, and more importantly, introduced a fluid camera movement, resembling the modern-day SteadiCam. This can better be seen in Rick’s introductory sequence when the camera almost glides through the cafe, positioning the audience as a guest. This shows off another key feature of Warner Bros. auteurship – intricately detailed sets that accommodated the camera, and showed off the large production budget.\n\nThese men helped to give Warner Bros. a distinct style that stood out. Casablanca is clearly the product of an auteur institution because of the influences from Warner, Wallis, Curtiz, Steiner and Edeson. This differed greatly from Bonnie and Clyde, as at the time, Warner Bros. did not have a ‘stable of creative staff’ due to the collapse of vertical integration; although creative personnel contributed to the distinct style and aesthetic of Bonnie and Clyde, it cannot be said the film is a product of a single auteur.\n\nCasablanca was built on a lot, as is typical of Warner Bros. (and other studios at the time). Films only began to be shot on-location in the 50s and 60s, showing that Casablanca is not only a product of the institution, but also the time it was created in. In addition, the set of Casablanca was large, detailed and emphasised the studio’s wealth. Often, wide shots were used to show the set off, mainly in Rick’s Cafe. The sets give an audience context – the streets of Casablanca are busy and heavily populated with a diverse range of people (showing off the hundreds of extras); Rick’s Cafe is luxurious, well-lit and intricately detailed; and Paris is a stereotypical presentation of France, and is also very detailed. A large, detailed, expensive set that accommodates the camera is a main feature of Warner Bros. auteurship.\n\nIt can be argued that the main reason Bonnie and Clyde was able to be so stylistically different was because of the Antitrust case (Paramount vs America). The Supreme Court ruled that studios could no longer control all stages of filmmaking, and prohibited studios from block booking more than 5 films (later, this was completely banned when the studios failed to obey – the banning of block booking was heavily influenced by SIMPP – Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers). The allowed foreign and independent films to make their way into American theatres, thus influencing American filmmakers to change their film style. Bonnie and Clyde is loosely based off the true story of the duo’s spree across America from 1932-1934 in The Great Depression.\n\nIn the final scene of Bonnie and Clyde, there is a visual reference to Breathless (Jean-Luc Godard, 1960) when one of the lenses of Clyde’s glasses comes out – this happened to Michel Pioccard in the closing sequence before he was shot and killed by police. This isn’t the only similarity Breathless holds to Bonnie and Clyde: Pioccard (who was, ironically, created to resemble Humphrey Bogarts typical brooding cynic character) impulsively shoots and kills a policeman whilst driving a stolen car, leading to his life on the lam; this is similar to when Clyde shoots the bank teller in the botched heist, catalysing their inevitable doom. These similarities are indicative of the influence The French New Wave had on Bonnie and Clyde, greatly helping to develop a distinct style.\n\nArthur Penn cannot be considered an auteur for Bonnie and Clyde for the same reason Michael Curtiz cannot be considered an auteur for Casablanca – many of the visual and technological techniques were adopted from The French New Wave – or in Casablanca’s case, film noir, and other American films that came before it. After 1945, French film hadn’t changed, and French filmmakers continued to make films about a war that most French would want to forget – so, young audiences especially lost interest, creating room for young filmmakers to fill the void in the industry. Post-war attitudes about the world inspired Francois Truffaut and other film critics to disparage the lack of artistic freedom, and visual sameness of films, a sameness that could also be seen in Hollywood films. Some of the most famous French film directors were Jacque Rivette, Claud Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, who wrote The 400 Blows (Francois Truffaut, 1959), which features rebellious youths in trouble with the law, which inspired the filmmakers of Bonnie and Clyde. David Newman and Robert Benton wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde, and because both appreciated The French New Wave, they approached Francois Truffaut, asking him to direct the film. He turned them down, and the two eventually managed to get Arthur Penn to direct the film. Editor Dede Allen embraced the freedom granted by this new French style, and created her own style of editing – a style that can be seen in many films she edited. Warren Beatty was the star and producer, selecting the actors, and oversaw the development of the script. Whilst Penn is not an auteur in his own right, the filmmakers and innovations of the French New Wave meant Bonnie and Clyde had a distinct style that was loved across America, and the world.\n\nThe use of cinematography and lighting in Casablanca is reflective of Warner Bros. institutional auteurship; many Warner Bros. films were reminiscent of film noir (as colour was primitive, and black and white seemed more ‘mature’). Rick is introduced through first his actions (playing chess alone – he’s isolated), then his attire (a white suit and black tie – unconventional), then his face is shown (shadowed and somber-looking). The use of low-key lighting, shadowing, and slowing revealing Rick’s character is typical of Arthur Edeson’s cinematography style. In contrast, Ilsa is well lit, in soft focus, and a catch light is used to make her eyes sparkle to show her innocence. This use of lighting, framing and character-perfection is carefully choreographed, and purposeful to manipulate an audience. It differs greatly from Bonnie and Clyde whose framing is improvised, lighting is minimal due to camera advancements, and characters are deeply flawed to reflect the French New Wave style of minimalism, and realism.\n\nThe French New Wave is characterised by hand-held camera movements, on-location shooting and advanced cameras with faster film stock to allow natural light to be used. In contrast, Casablanca uses a static camera, wide shots and is built on a lot so the set can accommodate the masses of equipment. This is seen in Rick’s introductory sequence, where the doors of the cafe are opened for the camera, and characters move out the way of the camera. Bonnie and Clyde being shot on-location in a Southern state that never recovered from the Depression reflects real life, and is indicative of French influence. This can be seen in multiple scenes; for example, when Clyde chases after Bonnie, a large cloud shadows the scene, making it hard to see the characters in the distance – this lack of control over external factors is typical of on-location shooting, and absent in films shot on a lot, like Casablanca.\n\nIn Casablanca, the characters move to reframe a scene. This is seen when Rick walks over to Ilsa in the cafe. The scene begins in a mid shot of Rick and Ilsa in deep focus, so that when Renault and Laszlo walk into frame, they are in clear view. The scene goes from a four shot, to a close up of Rick, then Laszlo, to a three-shot, and then a two-shot. The characters move within the shot to re-frame the scene – careful choreography is a key feature of Warner Bros. auteurship. In comparison, Bonnie and Clyde is not carefully choreographed, and is much more improvised, consistent with the French New Wave style. This is seen in the opening sequence: Bonnie moves around her room, and the camera follows her movement. At one point, the camera pushes into a close-up, but missed the focus point. Furthermore, throughout the film, the camera is often set further back in a wide shot to allow the characters to move within the scene, and capture everything they do such as at the beginning of the botched heist sequence.\n\nThe two films also use different sound techniques. In Rick’s Cafe, there is often diegetic music low in the mix played by Sam at his piano, or general murmurs from customers. Natural sounds lend verisimilitude to Bonnie and Clyde, reflecting the natural, on-location setting. Often in films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, diegetic sounds are unrealistically loud (such as the characters being heard over the sound of the plane in the closing sequence of Casablanca). The unnatural sounds that are organised perfectly in the mix shows it is a product of being filmed on a lot – typical of the Warner Bros. house style at the time.\n\nEditing is also a big stylistic difference between the two films. This is best seen when putting the two closing sequences side-by side. The editing in Casablanca’s closing sequence is carefully thought-out to optimise the sadness felt by the audience. Continuity editing is used when necessary, consisting of ‘invisible’ cuts, and ellipsis. In contrast, the editing in the closing sequence of Bonnie and Clyde is erratic, and reflects the violence – close-ups and mid shots are edited together to draw out the death sequence, heightening emotion. Multiple cameras were running at different distances, frame rates and angles to give variation to the scene, allowing editor Dede Allen to be creative. This is a huge difference between the films’ style, both styles denoting to their production contexts, and auteurs.\n\nOverall, both films reflect their institutional auteur to an extent, but they more so reflect their production contexts. Of course, had it not been for the French New Wave, Bonnie and Clyde would not have looked the way it did; but had it not been for the collapse of vertical integration, the Antitrust case, and the weakening Hays Code (that forbid violent or sexual imagery), French cinema would not have been able to influence American filmmakers. Neither film conform to the typical definition of an auteur, as the director’s films change style throughout time, but both feature the signature styles of those working on the film. It is the creative staff that contributes to the style of each film. Steiner’s compositions, Edeson’s lighting and cinematography influences, Hal B. Wallis’ selection of creative personnel, Curtiz’s framing and camera techniques and and Jack Warner’s political input shaped Casablanca, adding to the Warner Bros. house style. Put together, these men contributed the Casablanca’s structure and auteur techniques. David Newman and Robert Benton’s script (with Truffaut’s input), Dede Allen’s innovative editing, Beatty’s choice of actors and his use of method acting to present Clyde, Penn’s directorship, and of course, the influence of The French New Wave shaped Bonnie and Clyde. It is because of these people that Bonnie and Clyde can be considered the product of an auteurship, along with the reflection of the French New Wave style.\n\nDate: 24/05/23\n\nWrite a detailed 5-section blog post, in carefully paragraphed prose, identifying notable aspects of cinematography, sound, editing, mise-en-scène and performance in the opening sequence; 00:00:00 — 00:03:57.\n\n1. Write a general descriptive overview of the whole sequence and how it fits into the overall narrative (in terms of both story and characters)\n\n2. Identify and write about multiple examples of each key element\n\n•Describe each example in detail, utilising subject-specific terminology\n\n•Comment on the director’s intentions\n\n•Comment on the effect on audience\n\n•Focus on the most interesting and aesthetically pleasing examples of each key element, not just those relating to context and auteurship\n\n3. Identify and write about notable ways in which this sequence is contextually interesting.\n\n4. Identify and write about how the key elements are used to represent:\n\n•Age\n\n•Culture\n\n•Ethnicity\n\n•Gender\n\n5. Identify and write about how key moments of the sequence support the argument that the film is the work of an auteur studio.\n\nContext\n\nThe film opens with credits displayed over a map of Africa. There is then a cross-fade to a special effects, spinning globe with voice-over narration, explaining the journey of refugees. A line appears on a map to show the long treacherous journey those fleeing Europe had to travel, and that only the lucky ones made it to Casablanca. An audience are then shown the streets of Casablanca, crowded with different people: Europeans, Westerners, natives. An announcer is shown explaining how two German couriers were murdered, and their exits visas were stolen. The police were ordered to round up the usual suspects, and arrest them. A man carrying ‘Free France’ propaganda is murdered, just beneath the ‘Palace of Justice’. This final scene contextualises the oppression.\n\nKey Elements\n\nThe film begins with a grand, non-diegetic composed score to open the film. The music gradually gets more dramatic and exotic. At the time the film was shot, France had been occupied for two years, so to bring attention to their occupation and oppression, the music transitioned into the patriotic, French national anthem. The French had been bullied and oppressed by the Nazis occupying Paris, so playing their national anthem was Jack Warner’s way of reminding American people that the French needed help.\n\nThe first name to appear in the credits is Jack Warner’s to show his connection to the film, and that the ideas and themes present in the film are associated with his own. The next names to appear are the big film stars – Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. This is a technique all studios used to show off their glamorous and most popular actors to hook an audience straight away. This is an example of auteurship, because it could be said that actors ‘carry a film’, so having their names on display shows them off even more. The appearance of these two names may also hint at the underlying romance theme that was becoming so popular throughout the Golden Age of Hollywood. As the music crescendos, Max Steiner’s name appears; Steiner was an important influence in Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942), and many other Warner Bros. films. Steiner contributed to the aesthetic of Warner Bros. films, and helped in making the institution an auteur. Finally, the last name to appear is director, Michael Curtiz. His name being last shows that Casablanca is no more his film than anyone else’s – the film is a product of the institution it was produced in, in conjunction with the actors, composer, director and producer.\n\nAnother notable point is that the film is in black and white, despite the fact that colour had been available for a decade. Not only was black and white cheaper, it was seen as mature and authentic; it became a signature style of Warner Bros. – an element of their auteurship. Additionally, colour was relatively primitive, many coloured films at the time were grainy and poorer quality than black and white films, so using black and white made a film look more expensive, professional and vintage. Warner Bros. is known for dark crime, film noir or gang films, so black and white fits this aesthetic.\n\nAfter the credits end, there is a cross-fade to a map of Africa to establish where the film takes place. This is an immersive technique Warner Bros. used to show an audience that what they are seeing is currently happening in real real life. The narration is paired with a special effects, spinning globe – special effects was relatively new in the film industry, so this would be a novelty for an audience.\n\nAs the globe spins and the camera pushes into Africa, narrations begins. The narration is dramatic and biased towards France to try to make an audience sympathise with the French living in or trying to leave occupied France. There is a second cross-face to a 2D map with an animated trail; as the line progresses south, real news footage is superimposed onto the maps to show the journey to Casablanca – the people in the news footage look tired, desperate and poor. This was an attempt to show American audiences what French and European refugees were going through, and why America should intervene.\n\nThis narration summarises everything an audience needs to know – the treacherous refugee path takes travellers to Marseilles, to Oren and to Casablanca. To add to the emotion, the narrator says that not everyone makes it to Lisbon, fewer make it to Casablanca, and even fewer make it to America. Audiences watching this at the time would be complacent in un-involved America, and wouldn’t know the horrors of war. The film tells audiences that thousands of people were trying to get to America, which highlights how privileged an audience was at the time. This manipulative technique is how Jack Warner tried to get the American public on his side – films under his influence made an audience feel guilty, and that the least America could do is help the allies.\n\nThe next scene is of Casablanca; however, it has just been painted onto a canvas. Studios at the time didn’t shoot on location, instead preferred to construct or paint their own sets, allowing the director to be selective with what was shown, and how their location was represented – this is another feature of Warner Bros.’ auteurship. As the camera tilts down to the crowded, bustling streets of Casablanca, diegetic sounds of loud talking and shouting quickly rises in the mix. As well as diegetic sound, the non-diegetic composed score is exotic, native music to further immerse an audience into the film world. As the camera tilts and pans, an audience are shown more of the streets and the enormity of the set. This was to show off the money spent on construction, and on hiring hundreds of extras to make the streets of Casablanca busy and loud. The characters wear a range of clothes, from Westernised suits to native dress to show the diversity of Casablanca – there are many different ethnicities here, most are refugees trying to get to America, but very few lucky people make it, further emphasising the audience’s privilege.\n\nThe camera cuts to an operator reading an urgent telegram: two German couriers were murdered in Oren, and their exit visas were stolen. The murderer was assumed to be travelling to Casablanca. The ‘suspicious’, usual suspects were to be rounded up and searched for the visas. This is exposition – an audience are told exactly what is necessary for them to understand the film. This makes the film easy to follow for all audiences. The next scenes are rapidly cut together to show the chaos and rush of police trying to arrest their suspects as they try to run. In the next scene, the camera pans to follow the police car through the streets, which in turn shows off the detailed, constructed sets. The rapid cutting and shot reverse-shot give a sense of urgency and chaos. The brutality of the police divides them from ordinary people, and makes an audience sympathise with the men being rounded up – the refugees have escaped prosecution, only to be faced with more oppression from the Vichy French.\n\nBecause Casablanca was shot in a constructed set in Hollywood, all of the actors were American, so the Vichy French police had highly exaggerated accents. The final scene in this sequence shows a refugee being harassed by the police; he hands the police his expired papers and tries to escape custody. However, the man is shot in the back before he can escape. The police pull ‘Free France’ papers from the man’s hand, showing his patriotism, and commitment to his cause. This is clear French propaganda, and a political message that Jack Warner and Michael Curtiz decided to include, to bring attention to the oppressed French, who were desperate to escape Nazi-influence Morocco, or those still trying to get out of Nazi occupied France. By showing the dead man clutching onto this propaganda, it tells an audience that people were dying for their cause, and for their country. Warner and Curtiz showed an audience this to try to garner sympathy for the French. Ironically, this man was killed unjustly under the ‘Palace of Justice’, which was inscribed with the French motto: ‘freedom, equality, brotherhood’ – the Vichy French have strayed far from their patriotic motto.\n\nWhen the man is shot, there is no blood or violence – instead, his death is implicit. This is because of the Hays code: this was a set of guidelines for all studios and their films between 1934 and 1968. It prohibited profanity, graphic violence, or blood and injury detail (among other profane images). This shows that Casablanca is product of the time in which it was made. Despite Warner Bros. being one of the biggest studios of the time, they still had to adhere to rules.\n\nDate: 18/11/22"
