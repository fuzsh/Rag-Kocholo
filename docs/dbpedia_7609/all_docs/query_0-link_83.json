        "text": "Research and write about how Casablanca is an example of a product produced by an auteur institution.\n\nAt the time Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) was made, there were many censors and restrictions studios had to adhere to – this was known as they Hays code. The Hays code forbid explicit language, sexual implications or injury detail, which would explain the lack of injury detail when the ‘usual suspect’ from the beginning, and Major Strasser, are shot. This shows that Casablanca is a product of the institution and time in which it was made.\n\nDuring WWII, Warner Bros. made films that supported American intervention in the war, and Casablanca is no different. Warner Bros. used big stars such as Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid as ‘the face’ of the film to represent these patriotic messages. This is because an audience want to align themselves with these stars, so take on their ideals and values. Throughout the film, an audience are shown how hard it is for the refugees, either by showing real footage, or by recreating historical events – such as the occupation of Paris. An audience are manipulated by the footage and the music to make them feel sorry for the French, and refugees. Viewers are shown the panic in Paris in the days before occupation, to remind an audience that American allies are suffering while America watches; this makes an audience guilty and uncomfortable, as they are reminded of what is going on in the world. The patriotic messages are an example of how Casablanca is a product of Warner Bros..\n\nWarner Bros. is unusual by the fact that they didn’t have a stable of actors. Hal B. Wallis (executive producer) selected the actors and directors for each film, and seemed to have a ‘stable of creative staff’, rather than actors, such as Michael Curtiz, Max Steiner and Arthur Edeson. Along with contextual influences, these individuals helped to make the Warner Bros. style. Usually, studios gave actors ‘unbreakable contracts’ where they were essentially stuck with one studio – Warner Bros. gave actors individual contracts, which made them different from other studios, and also desirable to work with. This is an example of their auteurship.\n\nDirectors during the Golden Age of Hollywood had very little creative influence (no foreign or independent film), and the main influences came from the studio. Although Michael Curtiz isn’t solely responsible for the aesthetic of Casablanca, he greatly helped the development of an auteurship. He influenced the style of many Warner Bros. films by introducing a new lighting style, unfamiliar camera shots and angles, and more fluid camera movement – resembling the modern-day SteadiCam.\n\nMax Steiner was one of the first to write musical scores for film – he was often referred to as ‘the father of film music’. In Casablanca, his influences can be heard throughout, whether he is making a scene more intimate with romance music, more climatic with dramatic scales, or patriotic with the use of the French National anthem. Steiner didn’t compose all the songs in Casablanca, but he placed them expertly to heighten emotion, and convey information to an audience. Steiner did, however, compose the exotic-sounding music that plays in the beginning, telling an audience that the set is foreign.\n\nCinematographer, Arthur Edeson, began his career as a photographer, giving him a creative advantage in his cinematography career – similar to Curtiz, he experimented with shadows and lighting techniques to give a film more depth and detail, making him stand out at a time where many films were stylistically similar. Edeson’s creativity made the film much more, emotional – the way Ilsa is lit and framed to make her look innocent and youthful has an emotional impact on an audience. This technique is also used at the end with Rick, to show how he has changed from selfish and cynical to selfless and patriotic.\n\nThese three men helped to give Warner Bros. a distinct style that stood out. Casablanca is clearly the product of an auteur institution because of the influences from Curtiz, Steiner and Edeson.\n\nCasablanca was built on a lot, as is typical of Warner Bros. (and other studios at the time). Films only began to be shot on location in the 50s and 60s, showing that Casablanca is not only a product of the institution, but also the time it was created in. In addition, the set of Casablanca was huge, detailed and emphasised the studio’s wealth. Often, wide shots were used to show the set off, mainly in Rick’s cafe. The sets give an audience context – the streets of Casablanca are busy and heavily populated with a diverse range of people, Rick’s cafe is luxurious, well-lit and intricately detailed, and Paris is a stereotypical presentation of France. Additionally, an audience are frequently shown hundreds of extras, which is also indicative of Warner Bros. style. An expensive set that accommodates the camera is a main feature of Warner Bros. auteurship.\n\nDate: 05/12/22"
