        "text": "Michael Curtiz\n\nBorn in Budapest, Hungary in 1886, Michael Curtiz became a notable Hollywood director beginning in the early 1930s by working with notable actors such as Errol Flynn. His reputation as a noir director emanated from directing Casablanca and Mildred Pierce. However, Curtiz is also responsible for other films that grace the pantheon of great noir films such as Flaming Road and Angels with Dirty Faces featuring James Cagney, a frequent performer in noir films.\n\nJules Dassin\n\nDassin was a native-born American actor who achieved his greatest success as an expatriate in Paris, France. After being blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, Dassin made a series of films that are foundational works in noir cinema: Brute Force, The Naked City, Thieves Highway, and Rififi. Ironically, these films enhanced his reputation as a great American director.\n\nFritz Lang\n\nAustrian born director Fritz Lang is often associated as one of the founding directors of the noir genre. One of his most influential films, M, is considered a proto-noir masterpieces that fundamentally defined both the substantive visual and thematic vocabulary for subsequent films in the genre. Several of his films such as The Big Heat, Ministry of Fear, and You Only Live once further defined the notion of classical noir for generations of filmmakers.\n\nOrson Welles\n\nWelles is rightfully acknowledged as a cinematic genius buy virtue of Citizen Kane; however, he also directed and acted in two classic noirs: Mr. Arkadin and A touch of Evil. The latter is considered the last true noir. In addition, Welles provided an incredible performance as the infamous Harry Lime in the Carol Reed classic The Third Man.\n\nBilly Wilder\n\nYet another Austrian born director noted for is contributions to a uniquely American form. Billy Wilder is most often associated with comedies such as Some Like It Hot and The Seven Year Itch; however, his reputation as a master of the noir emanates from a trilogy of three perfectly crafted genre films: Ace in the Hole, Double Indemnity, and Sunset Boulevard."
