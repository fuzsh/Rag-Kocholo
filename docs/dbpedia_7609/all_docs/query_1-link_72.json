        "text": "Filmmakers\n\nMichael Curtiz (born Manó Kaminer (December 24, 1886 – April 11, 1962) was a Hungarian-born American film director, recognized as one of the most prolific directors in history. He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood’s Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent. He was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz’s direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for Sons of Liberty and once as Best Director for Casablanca.\n\nCurtiz was among those who introduced to Hollywood a visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles. He was versatile and could handle any kind of picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the “human and fundamental problems of real people” were the basis of all good drama.\n\nCurtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler with films such as Captain Blood (1935), with Flynn, de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, and Ross Alexander; and The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), the latter he shared directing credit with William Keighley. He directed many dramas which today are also considered classics, Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), with James Cagney; The Sea Wolf (1941), with with Edward G. Robinson, Ida Lupino, John Garfield, and Alexander Knox; Casablanca (1942), starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman; and Mildred Pierce (1945), with Joan Crawford, Jack Carson, and Zachary Scott. He directed leading musicals, including Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), with Cagney, Joan Leslie, Walter Huston, and Richard Whorf; This Is the Army (1943), with George Murphy, Ronald Reagan, Leslie, Alan Hale Sr., and Rosemary DeCamp; and White Christmas (1954), with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen; and he made comedies with Life With Father (1947), with William Powell and Irene Dunne; and We’re No Angels (1955), with Bogart, Peter Ustinov, Aldo Ray, Joan Bennett, Rathbone, and Leo G. Carroll.\n\nOther notable performers he collaborated with included Bela Lugosi, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, John Wayne, Boris Karloff, William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Lee Marvin, Sophia Loren, Angela Lansbury, Walter Matthau, Ernest Borgnine, Jean Simmons, Gene Tierney, John Carradine, Lon Chaney Jr., Will Rogers Jr., Nancy Olson, Donna Reed, Jane Wyman, William Holden, Gary Cooper, Lauren Bacall, Kirk Douglas, Elizabeth Taylor, Cary Grant, Doris Day, Fred MacMurray, Edward G. Robinson, Randolph Scott, Vincent Price, Shirley Temple, Jack Lemmon, Leslie Nielsen, Paul Newman.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)"
