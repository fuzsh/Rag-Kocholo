        "text": "What Casablanca does have, however, is heart. Its multinational cast – only three of the 14 credited actors were born in the US – included many members who had fled Nazi Germany, and during the famous defiant rendition of La Marseillaise had genuine tears in their eyes.\n\nIn addition, Casablanca boasted Michael Curtiz in the director’s chair, a fact often overlooked during discussions of why the film came to be regarded as one of the greatest ever made.\n\nHis brusque manner, idiosyncratic grasp of English and relentless work ethic often hid the deep emotion he brought to his productions while the sheer number of films he made – he directed or co-directed an astonishing\n\n178, including more than 100 in Hollywood – tended to hide the skill and vision he brought to the cinema.\n\nHis polymathic attitude to genres and prolific output mean he is rarely spoken of in the same awed tones as a Hitchcock or Capra, but Curtiz was as much of a craftsman as any Hollywood great.\n\nHe moved seamlessly from silent films to talkies, coaxed Oscar-winning performances from a string of great actors, is credited with discovering Doris Day when she was singing with a hired band at a party, transformed Errol Flynn into a swashbuckling screen legend and even managed to direct a critically acclaimed Elvis Presley vehicle in King Creole.\n\nIf this versatility was his strength, however, it didn’t help to earn him a place in cinematic posterity.\n\n“What can one say about a guy who could follow up The Egyptian with White Christmas, and jump immediately from Francis of Assisi to a John Wayne western?” asked Charles Silver, curator of a 2011 retrospective at MOMA in New York.\n\nYet for all his giant leaps in genre Curtiz didn’t just lay a cut-and-paste directorial template over each film he made. He retained some of the German Expressionist techniques he had learned in Europe, yet it’s still almost impossible to identify a Michael Curtiz movie just from watching it. He treated each project on its merits, assessing cast, script and budget and creating the best film he could by demanding the best from everyone involved. Which usually meant a tough time for cast and crew.\n\n“Mike was a pompous bastard who didn’t know how to treat actors,” said James Cagney, who won his only Oscar in Curtiz’s Yankee Doodle Dandy, “but he sure as hell knew how to treat a camera.”\n\nMost famously he clashed with Joan Crawford on the set of Mildred Pierce in 1945, calling the star “Phoney Joany” when he felt she was over-glamourising the title role and wondering aloud, “Why should I waste my time directing this has-been?” Crawford’s career was on the wane, she had barely worked in\n\ntwo years, but Curtiz’s refusal to indulge his star did the trick – Mildred Pierce earned Crawford her only Academy award for Best Actress.\n\nHe may have brought his people success, but Curtiz never learned to accept that not everyone had his extraordinary drive and energy. He slept barely four hours a night and never stopped for lunch, believing that eating in the middle of the day produced fatigue and poor concentration as well as wasting time that could be better spent working.\n\nThis intensity and single-minded determination – one story has it that he was once so gripped by an idea that he fell out of a car while writing it up in a notebook, a car he was driving at the time – sometimes led to incidents that would not be remotely acceptable today. In 1926 the flood scene in his Noah’s Ark was hailed as one of the most dramatic scenes in cinema to date, but it came at the expense of some serious injuries to extras. For the climactic eponymous scene of 1936’s The Charge of the Light Brigade, Curtiz strung trip wires across the set to bring down the horses. Of the 125 animals\n\nused in the scene, 25 were either killed outright or had to be destroyed.\n\nFlynn, a renowned horseman, was so furious at the cruelty he witnessed he\n\nphysically attacked Curtiz on the set and while the pair would make more films together, they barely spoke again. So grievous had Curtiz’s disregard for the horses’ welfare been that the US Congress passed laws protecting animals used in film-making soon afterwards. Some even credit the formation of the Screen Actors’ Guild in 1933 as being a direct response to\n\nCurtiz’s demanding methods.\n\nThere are few clues in his background as to what ignited this relentless drive\n\nand furious work ethic. He was born Manó Kaminer in Budapest, where his father was a carpenter and his mother an opera singer, changing his name to\n\nthe Hungarianised Mihály Kertész in his late teens. In a rare interview he once conceded that despite the family’s apparent middle-class credentials money was tight. “Many times we were hungry,” he said.\n\nHe graduated from a Budapest drama school and joined a troupe of travelling players, touring Europe performing Shakespeare and Ibsen in various languages. In 1912 he joined the Hungarian National Theatre, directed Hungary’s first feature film – in which he also played the lead – and still found time to compete at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm as a fencer (in 1951 he would direct Burt Lancaster in Jim Thorpe – All American, the story of Native American Thorpe’s experiences at the same games).\n\nWounded while serving in the Austro-Hungarian army in 1915, he spent the rest of the war making documentaries for the Red Cross and films for Hungary’s leading studio before moving to Vienna in 1919 after the communists came to power in Budapest. By the mid-1920s he was one of the busiest and most respected directors in Europe, his biblical epics, in particular, convincing Warner Bros in 1926 to bring Curtiz, by then nearly 40 years old and with 60 films behind him, to Hollywood as their answer to Cecil B DeMille.\n\nIf he didn’t actually revolutionise Hollywood, Curtiz was certainly instrumental in turning it into the behemoth we know today, yet for all his\n\nmany talents, achievements and gruelling demands of cast and crew he\n\nremained convinced that the secret to film success was relatively simple."
