        "text": "“Compare how far your chosen films reflect the auteur signature features of their filmmakers”\n\nThe word auteur comes from the French word for author, an auteur refers to a director who is the creative force in their film with a unique and recognisable style. André Bazin is a renowned French film critic and theorist who first theorised about auteurship in the late 1940s and published his thoughts on cinema in the French film magazine “What is Cinema?”. Bazin also believed films should have a deep focus on reality using long takes rather than using rapid cutting and juxtaposition to distort the world of the film.\n\nBazin defined an auteur as a director with a clear recognisable style of filmmaking, arguably a director who couldn’t be classed as a traditional auteur on his own is Michael Curtiz. However, when working with a group of filmmakers in the Warner Brothers House Style which produced qualities of an auteur, A film directed by Curtiz in this style is Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942). Casablanca reignited the war genre of film and was deliberately patriotic to raise morale, this is due to Jack Warner being patriotic and wanting America to join World War Two.\n\nCasablanca was produced in 1942 and was made in the Warner Brothers House Style, which was a variation of the classical Hollywood style developed by Warner Brothers that used similar techniques to the classical style but had some small differences to make Warner films stand out. The Warner house style often included Urban settings and environments, the style is also fast pace and uses quick dialogue to develop the plot. Unlike other studio’s, Warner focused on the personalities of the actors rather than their appearances.\n\nAfter World War Two, audiences got tired of the films coming out of Hollywood. This because they were seen as ‘artificial’ and ‘inauthentic’. French Film Critics challenged these Hollywood ideas and decided to make their own style of filmmaking that would be different and stray away from the ideals of classical Hollywood. Some of these techniques include filming on location and using a much smaller cast and crew. This new style of filmmaking dubbed “The French New Wave” was very popular and inspired some Hollywood directors to try these methods in their own films.\n\nA notable director who took lessons and techniques from the “French New Wave” was Arthur Penn who worked with producer and actor Warren Beatty to produce Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1962). Arthur Penn could be classed as an auteur however the majority of techniques in his filmmaking style come directly from French New Wave directors. One of these directors is Jean-Luc Godard who before becoming a director was a film critic similar to André Bazin. Godard produced many French New Wave films and inspired the scriptwriters of Bonnie and Clyde with his film Breathless (Godard, 1960) due to the relationship between the two main characters.\n\nCasablanca is visually representative of the Warner brothers house style, one of the first shots of Casablanca shows the spinning globe that gradually zooms in to establish the location of Casablanca. This establishing shot is a staple of the Hollywood studio system with the majority of all films at the time starting with establishing shot to give the audience context and back story for the film.\n\nBonnie and Clyde also does this at the beginning of the film when it introduces both main characters using pictures in a slowed slide show. From the first shot of Bonnie in the film you can see the influence that the French New Wave had on Arthur Penn, the first shot is an extreme close up of Bonnie’s lips which immediately sexualised her at the start of the film. Many French New Wave films didn’t start with establishing shots as a method to oppose the filmmaking style of Studio System Hollywood.\n\nIn Casablanca the sound design has clear diegetic dialogue which was a common choice in many films made in the Hollywood studio system. Casablanca uses more diegetic music throughout the film rather than using a non diegetic score, this music is most heard in the sequences at Ricks Cafe. Casablanca does use a non-diegetic score towards the beginning of the film which manipulates the audience through the use of an intense instrumental fanfare as the Warner logo and actors are shown on-screen. The soundtrack for Casablanca was composed by Max Steiner who was described as a ‘child prodigy’. Steiner was one of the first composers to compose music for film.\n\nBonnie and Clyde represents some of the sound techniques used in the French New Wave. The diegetic dialogue in the film is deliberately muffled and naturalistic which adds to the realistic theme in the film. Bonnie and Clyde also uses non diegetic bluegrass music which is a genre of country music that reflects the time the film is set. The film also has a natural sound design which gives the film more energy and is a well-known French New Wave technique that strays from the ideals of the studio system.\n\nIn Casablanca the acting is strictly script orientated with actors delivering their lines clearly to develop the plot for the audience, this was a key element in the Warner Brothers Studio System since it gave the plot of the film further clarity for the audience. The actors in the film speak in mostly British or exotic accents to add to the world of the film and to appeal to a wider audience. At the time Warner Brothers was known as the ‘studio of the working class’ due to its plots often including speaking black characters or characters in poverty, this is one of the things that made the Warner house style unique. The acting during scenes of violence in the film are also deliberately exaggerated and unrealistic.\n\nThis style of acting isn’t in Bonnie and Clyde which keeps the acting realistic even in the violent scenes, this type of acting reflects Arthur Penn’s influence from the French New Wave. Many French New Wave films included realistic violence and nudity as a way to rebel against the ideas of the Hollywood Studio System at the time. The accents in Bonnie and Clyde are all American which reflects the location and time period of the film. From the beginning of the film these accents are used to introduce main characters Bonnie and Clyde as well as to show the audience where the film is set without establishing shots which was another artistic choice used in French New Wave filmmaking.\n\nThe roles in the film Casablanca were strongly defined, an example of this is having a strong male lead; these roles were a key part of the Hollywood Studio System that Casablanca was made in. The major case of this in Casablanca is Rick who is shown throughout the film as being noble and heroic. The actor who plays Rick, Humphrey Boggart was a famous film actor at the film and was owned by Warner Brothers and starred in many detective films with an iconic hat and trench coat.\n\nThis idea of a strong male lead contrasts with Bonnie and Clyde due to Clyde being a much weaker, nervous and generally selfish. This style of main character was used in the French New Wave to experiment and create a more relatable main character to the audience. An example of Clyde’s behaviour is during the first bank heist of the film which goes terribly wrong with Clyde being portrayed as weak and nervous throughout the scene. The ending of each film also reflects both the Hollywood Studio System and French New Wave with Casablanca having a happier ending that has a sad event that the main character rises above and with Bonnie and Clyde being a bloodbath that makes the audience upset and on edge.\n\nCasablanca uses weather to add emotion into the film, this weather is fake and created within the studio the film is produced in. The weather is used as a method to manipulate the audience and to exaggerate a scene. The most prominent example of this is during the end of the film which includes artificial rain that is used to make the scene more dramatic for the audience.\n\nThis is not the case in Bonnie and Clyde which uses natural weather from the filming location. This is another major aesthetic difference between the films with Casablanca being made in a studio and Bonnie and Clyde being filmed on location. An example of the natural weather in the film is during the opening scene where Bonnie meets Clyde and they walk around town, the weather is bright and naturalistic to give the film a sense of realism.\n\nTo conclude, both Michael Curtiz and Arthur Penn can be classed as auteurs however, they are not typical auteurs. Michael Curtiz can be classed as an auteur when working with a team of filmmakers to produce a film in the Warner Brothers House Style that had fast paced dialogue to advance the plot which had a three act structure. Arthur Penn can also be classed as an auteur due to the techniques he took from French New Wave directors like Jean-Luc Godard."
