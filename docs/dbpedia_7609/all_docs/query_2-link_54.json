        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nCHAPTER 13 King Creole: Michael Curtiz and the Great Elvis Presley Industry landon PalmER Alongside Richard Thorpe’s Jailhouse Rock (1957), King Creole (1958) is widely considered by critics, scholars, and biographers as one of the best parts—perhaps the best part—of Elvis Presley’s prolific but largely uncelebrated film career. Upon its release, Howard Thompson of the New York Times observed with wry amusement, “Elvis Presley can act,” and contrasted the film with Presley’s previous features by stating, “Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and he does it, so help us over a picket fence” (“Actor with Guitar,” July 4, 1958). Billboard and Variety echoed such qualified expressions of praise (Bob Bernstein, “Elvis Acts, Songs Are Solid in King Creole,” Billboard, May 26, 1958, 7; Victor 2008, 287). Presley later cited his work in King Creole as his favorite among his screen performances, and the dramatic potential he displayed in it likely informed his continued goal “to progress as an actor” beyond musicals into the early 1960s (James 2016, 84, 93). In tune with these rare lauds for a Presley screen role, Michael Curtiz holds a uniquely prominent place as one of few distinctive filmmakers who directed the rock ’n’ roll star. Thompson’s review describes Curtiz as “a shrewd director” and credits him with “snugly drap[ing the narrative ] around Mr. Presley’s shoulders” in a New Orleans setting “beguilingly drenched with atmosphere.” Even pans of King Creole recognized Curtiz’s talent, as indicated by Phillip Hartung’s review in Commonweal: “It must be said in favor of Director Michael Curtiz that he does succeed in getting Presley to act every now and then” (1958, 68). Reflecting on Presley’s film career as a whole, the biographer Peter Guralnick credits Curtiz with manifesting a Presley “full of jauntiness, assurance, an ease and melodiousness of nuanced approach” that is missing from Presley’s later filmography (1999, 87). The historian Mark Feeney pointedly cites 172 Landon Palmer Curtiz as one of few especially talented filmmakers with whom Presley worked (2001, 55). While Curtiz is credited with developing Presley’s most celebrated film performance, King Creole’s exceptional place within its star’s filmography has hardly extended to its director’s reputation. Sidney Rosenzweig’s book surveying Curtiz’s career through his work across genres is tellingly titled Casablanca and Other Major Films of Michael Curtiz. King Creole is not listed as one of the director’s “major films,” and the author mentions only briefly that the film “retain[s] the distinctive Curtiz look and atmosphere ” (1982, 160). The first published accounts of Curtiz’s career demonstrate critics’ struggle to place the director’s impressive filmography within the auteurist terms that dominated 1960s film criticism of studioera directing, and scholars have instead favored understanding Curtiz as a consummate and prolific professional who thrived within the norms of the studio system. Finding in him a “contract director’s mentality,” James C. Robertson argues that Curtiz’s “individualism was hidden from public view and he could not be associated with any one genre” of the many within which he worked (1993, 2–3).Within this framework for evaluating Curtiz’s body of work, his late-career period, accompanying the disintegration of the studio system, becomes understandably marginalized as less representative of his contributions to film culture as a whole. Robertson notably places King Creole in Curtiz’s post-studio-era “nomadic period,” wherein his declining health coincided with a time in which “the Hollywood studio system was under strain” (117–118). In this respect, it is easy to understand why King Creole is a standout in the rock ’n’ roll star’s otherwise less-than-venerated film career, while the film does not hold a similar place within the overall reputation of its director. A closer examination of King Creole, however, illuminates how Curtiz functioned within the post-studio era. Curtiz played an instrumental role in developing the screen persona of a star who portended a new industrial design of Hollywood performance, an “electronic age” star whose screen image united media commodities and cultural industries.1 This essay considers Curtiz’s reputation as an adaptive creative laborer contributing to King Creole’s important role in structuring the industrial formula that came to define Presley’s screen career. Although King Creole is now commonly considered a rare work of prestige drama within Presley ’s otherwise interchangeable output of candy-colored stake-free musicals , the film was hardly a departure..."
