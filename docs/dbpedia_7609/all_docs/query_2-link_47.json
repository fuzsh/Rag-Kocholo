        "text": "1. Michael Curtiz was born as Manó Kaminer in Budapest, Hungary in 1886. He later changed his name to Mihály Kertész and finally settled on the name Michael Curtiz when he began his career in Hollywood.\n\n2. Despite being known for his successful American films, Curtiz originally wanted to be a painter. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest and had a talent for drawing, but eventually switched to filmmaking.\n\n3. One surprising fact about Curtiz is that he spoke very little English when he came to Hollywood. He primarily directed in German and Hungarian, and relied on translators and assistants to communicate his vision to the English-speaking cast and crew.\n\n4. One of Curtiz's most famous films, \"Casablanca\" (1942), was not initially expected to be a major success. It was made on a limited budget and had a chaotic production, but it went on to become a beloved classic and won the Academy Award for Best Picture."
