        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nCHAPTER 5 Long Love the Queen: Bette Davis, Curtiz, and Female Melodrama david GREvEn Bette Davis made several movies with Michael Curtiz in the 1930s: two in 1932: The Cabin in the Cotton (notable for its famous Davis line “I’d love to kiss you, but I just washed my hair,” delivered in a southern accent) and 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (starring Spencer Tracy); Jimmy the Gent (1934), starring James Cagney; Front Page Woman (1935); Kid Galahad (1937), in which Davis plays the girlfriend of boxing manager Edward G. Robinson ; and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), based on Maxwell Anderson’s play and co-starring Errol Flynn, or, as the Hungarian émigré director famous for his malapropisms and heavy accent called him, “Earl Flint.” While there is much to be said about all these films and about Curtiz and Davis’s relationship, my focus here is on The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. In my view, it has not been given its critical due as one of the major women’s films, a genre that Curtiz brilliantly shaped, as Elizabeth, Mildred Pierce (1945), and Flamingo Road (1949) evince. Front Page Woman anticipates Elizabeth’s showcasing of strong female roles as well as gender play, fluidity, and ambiguity, and I discuss it briefly before moving on to the 1939 film. The Curtiz-Davis Collaboration Born Kaminer Manó Kertész in 1886 in Hungary to a Jewish family, Curtiz made films such as The Charlatan (1917) in his native land before his arrival in Hollywood in 1926, where he thrived and became a prolific studio-system filmmaker until the 1960s. Davis became one of the major stars of classical Hollywood, but she had inauspicious beginnings, as a contract player first at Universal and then at Warner Bros.; she was Bette Davis, Curtiz, and Female Melodrama 69 given lackluster parts before commencing her reign as the studio’s boxoffice queen from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s. Even her breakthrough performance, while on loan to RKO, as the slatternly and manipulative Mildred in John Cromwell’s Of Human Bondage (1934), did not ensure good roles, though she won a compensatory Oscar the following year for Dangerous.1 It took Davis’s 1937 lawsuit against Warners, an attempt to break her contract for being given bad parts, to change the course of her career. Unsuccessful though it was, the suit (which went to trial in England ) inspired a shift in the studio’s attitudes, and Davis finally began to get the top roles she craved. Curtiz’s initial reaction to Bette Davis, whom he did not want for Cabin in the Cotton, emblematized her frustrating early experiences. Rejections for supposedly being unattractive (“a little brown wren”) were frequent. Curtiz was “abusive to Bette personally, barking at and needling her in heavily Hungarian-accented tones,” writes Ed Sikov, though in Cabin, his first film with her, “he lights her with great finesse” (2007, 47). Confronted with the decision to cast Davis as the southern belle Madge in that film, Curtiz exploded: “Goddamned nothing no good sexless son of a bitch!” (47). While Curtiz clearly misjudged both his star’s talent and her beauty (the latter always a controversial point), his initial apprehension haunts her performance—or, better put, his treatment of her performance —in Elizabeth. Davis stated the matter this way: “Mr. Curtiz, I must say, monster as he was, was a great European moviemaker. He was not a performer’s director. I made quite a few pictures with him. You had to be very strong with him. And he wasn’t fun. He could humiliate people, but never me. He was a real baStaRd! Cruelest man I have ever known. But he knew how to shoot a film well” (Chandler 2006, 83). Curtiz may not have been a “performer’s director” in Davis’s eyes, but when he filmed her in Elizabeth, he gave free rein to her artistic impulses, and her perhaps sadomasochistic desire to punish her own appearance (and the audience along with it). Curtiz’s film is notable for several unflinching close-ups of Davis as the aged queen. Her appearance—white plaster face and shock of red hair—is frequently described as ugly.2 As Martin Shingler has argued, Davis’s performances offer ironic pleasures . Her role in Vincent Sherman’s Mr. Skeffington (1944) exemplifies Davis’s gender ambiguity and ironic detachment.The unconventionally attractive Davis plays a woman famed for her beauty..."
