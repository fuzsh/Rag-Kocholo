        "text": "“The director is always the most important influence on a film.”\n\nBoth Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) and Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) can be seen as deviating from this statement and were created through collaborations of multiple auteur based filmmakers. Despite this, Casablanca was also forced to conform to may studio mandates which no longer existed by the time of Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967).\n\nCasablanca (Cutriz, 1942) can be seen as a product of the studio systems that dominated the Golden Age of Hollywood where the 8 major studios were known for making specific genres of film with specific beliefs about how films should play out which gave less room for individual auteurs to make their mark on them. Many of the cinematic elements of across Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942) fall in line with the Classical Hollywood Style. An emphasis is placed upon the top billed actors and giving them a star quality through the use of bloom effects and catch lights to make their faces look smoother and as attractive to the audience as possible.\n\nDespite this, the studios themselves could be seen as being the auteurs in this era of American Cinema as each carved out their own House Styles to distinguish their films from those of studios through the use of common motifs that carried across various productions. Films under Warner Brothers during this time became known for their realism and often being set in urban locations to appeal to the average American audience of the time. Despite this element of realism, their films still relied on large and expansive sets – such as Rick’s café in Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942) – out of a desire to tightly control every part of the production including the weather while also displaying the large amounts of money and influence they had. This control is also displayed in the opening credits of Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942) where there is a fanfare over the studio logo is the first thing the audience sees which indicates that they are about to watch a prestigious production.\n\nEven with the dominance of Warner Brothers, Michael Curtiz was still able to influence his own films during their production given his skills as a director that eventually directed 100 films for the studio in 25 years. Like many of the films he directed, Casablanca (1942) focused upon a grounded story based on the real world and he heavily involved himself with almost every area of the film to keep it on schedule.\n\nDuring this time, executive producers had much more influence over the structure of the films their studios released. As the executive producer of Warner Brothers, Jack Warner was able to push his own political views to audiences in Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942) and placed an emphasis on his belief that America should be more active in WW2 prior to Pearl Harbour. As a way to reinforce this, a majority of characters in the film are based upon stereotypes of the era with a black and white conflict consisting of American characters heroes of the film fighting the German villains.\n\nBy the time of Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967), American Cinema had dramatically changed as the Golden Age of Hollywood transitioned into New Hollywood at the end of the 1950s.\n\nAs the director, Arthur Penn’s interest in anti-hero characters influenced the way he chose to portray Bonnie and Clyde during the film. Despite being the film’s protagonists, the main characters are still presented as being on the wrong side of the law while still being sympathetic to the audience with the Great Depression acting as a justification for their actions. This culminates in the final scene where both Bonnie and Clyde are gunned down violently from a concealed enemy. The combination of both real time and slow motion effects with the emotionless presentation of their killers put the audience in the position of feeling sorry for Bonnie and Clyde. Along with this, Penn used the film to push against sensitive topics in the American film industry at the time and included close up and graphic violence to shock audiences as this was almost never seen in films at the time.\n\nWarren Beatty spearheaded the production of Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) out of a desire to star as Clyde in an accurate portrayal of their story. In order to do this, he collaborated with Penn and several handpicked screenwriters and editors. Similarly to Curtiz, Beatty involved himself in every aspect of the production to ensure that the film was released at the highest standard that it could achieve. Beatty’s role as Clyde also influenced the way the film was created as he pushed for his character to be as authentic as possible even if it meant forcing it against traditional film themes of the time.\n\nIn contrast to Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942), the entirety of Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) was filmed on location in the southern states of America as most were still recovering from the Great Depression and reflected the feel that the director and producer wanted to achieve in the film. Another result of filming on location was that the film was able to make use of crane shots to establish locations and the busy city streets while also bringing in more light from natural sources such as the shadows of passing clouds during the scene where Bonnie talks with Clyde about wanting to see her family which can be seen as foreshadowing their deaths by the end of the film. Along with this, the cinematographers had more space to improvise as a result of not having everything created purely for the benefit of the film which led to western inspired shots of streets during the first robbery scene of the film.\n\nOne of the major inspirations for the editor Dede Allen was the French New Wave which had started in the 1950s to counter classic forms of filming and also spread to influence most European film industries. This led to Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) using rapid cuts to express emotion, especially in the last scene where the characters share a final look with each other which is conveyed through shot/reverse shot. Another major technique used is the jump cut which skips part of a clip of footage cut out of the shot in order to show the passage of time and violate traditional continuity editing which represents Bonnie’s boredom in the opening scene of the film. Tracking shots are a consistent element of the film during casual moments between the characters which allow for them to dictate the direction of their own story as the camera follows them fluidly and is often also hand-held to add a natural tone and feel to the scene. This can also be seen as reflective of how the Hollywood Studios became subservient to their directors and the stories they wanted to tell on screen.\n\nOverall, both Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942) and Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) are examples that directors are not always the most influential part of a film production as both were created through collaborative productions. However, Bonnie and Clyde (Penn, 1967) displays more independence as a film since it placed an emphasis on its story instead of the expectations of American Cinema at the time of its release."
