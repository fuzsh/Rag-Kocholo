        "text": "As previously mentioned, since Casablanca was produced during the Classical-Hollywood period of ‘stars and studios‘, it has a similar feel in tone and look to many other films produced by Warner Brothers at the time. However, the key point to be made is that this Warner Brothers house style was distinct to other studios like MGM, who had their own house styles.\n\nWhat makes Classical Hollywood films, like Casablanca, so successful is that they are produced with one common goal in mind. Although this is seemingly quite dictatorial in principal, in practice what actually happened was a collaborative effort between all facets of the filmmaking process.\n\nThe lead creative vision behind Casablanca was the executive producer, Jack Warner. After being learning of the refugees in Casablanca, Warner felt immediately compelled to produce a film, detailing the horrific aspects of war. Openly critical of the oppressive Nazi leadership, Warner was outspoken in his support for an American intervention in WW11. This probably lead to the allegorical nature of the film.\n\nHal B. Wallis was the most important producer, after Jack Warner. In many respects, Wallis’ work was the most crucial in bring to life Warner’s vision. He was responsible for buying the film rights and setting the budget for the film. He also was the primary outlet for sourcing the correct actors and he lead the editing team. In this regard, Wallis was the key hand in sustaining the distinct hopeless tone, throughout Casablanca.\n\nMichael Curtiz is surprisingly less well-known than most of his compatriots, potentially because he did not have much of an auteur style. Instead, Curtiz was instructed to film the product of Warner and Wallis’ vision and only a few times is he allowed to showcase his style, through a few high crane shots in the opening montage, for example.\n\nIn order to create the distinct film noir style in Casablanca, cinematographer Arthur Edeson and composer Max Steiner had a lot of creative control. Edeson used his expertise in lighting to manufacture an expressionistic low-key style. Whilst Steiner created memorable melodies within scores that accentuated themes in the narrative. Steiner was even able to suggest themes through his own music, known as leitmotifs."
