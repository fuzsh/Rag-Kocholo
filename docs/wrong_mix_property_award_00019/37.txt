Executive summary: Bragg's Law of diffraction

Physicist Lawrence Bragg studied under J. J. Thomson and was the son of physicist William Bragg. Building on Max von Laue's pioneering work in x-ray crystallography, he proposed in 1912 what is now called Bragg's law of diffraction, which explains how crystals diffract X-ray beams at specific angles of incidence. They theorized that the molecular structure of a crystal could be ascertained from observing and analyzing the x-ray interference pattern, and to prove their assertion they designed an X-ray spectrometer and devised a mathematical system for analyzing its data. For this work and their landmark 1915 book on the topic, X-rays and Crystal Structure, the father-and-son team shared that year's Nobel Prize for Physics.

25 years of age when he won the honor, Bragg was and remains the youngest Nobel laureate in history. He was also awarded the Military Cross during World War I, for his work developing technology to pinpoint the position of enemy artillery by analyzing the sound of their weapons firing. He later studied metallurgy, silicates, and the structure of proteins. At the start of his career atomic theory had only recently been accepted, and examining the behavior of individual atoms seemed like science fiction; toward the end of his career he was the director of Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University in the 1950s, as Francis Crick and James Watson used technology largely built on x-ray methodology developed by Bragg and his father to unravel the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
