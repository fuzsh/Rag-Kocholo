ADDRESS OF HON. JEREMIAH CROWLEY MAYOR TO THE CITY COUNCIL January i, 1900. Gentlemen of the City Council: We are assembled here this morning, at the dawn of the new year, to take upon ourselves the duties and responsibilities of conducting the municipal business of the city of Lowell for the current year. Upon you will devolve the chief part of the work. In the transaction of that business, you are bound to exercise the same care and consideration, and on the same principles, as you exercise in the transaction of your own most im- portant private business. We are not -sent here b} - our fellow citizens to deal out favors to our political friends for service performed as partisans in the interest of any political party. Character and efficiency are the only tests to be applied to candidates for 6 mayor’s address. public office, and fidelity to the interests of the whole city and of all classes of our people, are the tests which will be applied to you in regard to your official conduct. In order to meet the approbation of our fellow citizens our administra- tion must be marked by a strict regard for the rights of all classes of our people, and for all sections of our city. A spirit of judicious economy must be exhibited in ever}- municipal act. By economy I do not mean parsimony. As our duties are to a large extent regulated by law, it would be well for us, this morning, to consider some features of the amendment to our city charter, which passed the Legislature, and was approved May 16th, 1896, entitled, “An Act to Amend the City Charter of Lowell.” I would call your attention to section one, section five, sections six and seven of said act, which read as follows : — Section i. All executive powers which .are now by law vested in the city council of the city of Lowell, or either branch thereof, shall hereafter be vested in and exercised by the mayor of said city, except as hereinafter otherwise provided. Sect. 5. The heads of the several depart- ments and offices shall have power to appoint and employ, and to discharge all subordinate officers and employes in their respective depart- ments ; and they shall keep a record, subject to inspection, of all so appointed and employed and of all discharged, and in all cases of discharge the grounds therefor, provided, however, that no removals shall be made upon partisan grounds. 7 mayor’s address. Sect. 6. The heads of the several departments and offices shall have the general charge and man- agement of all matters pertaining to their respect- ive departments, and shall make and execute ail contracts necessary therefor except for the purchase of materials and supplies ; but every contract made as aforesaid in which the amount involved exceeds three hundred dollars shall be approved by the Mayor before going into effect ; provided that noth- ing in this section shall be construed to prevent the City Council by ordinance from transferring any of the duties imposed upon an appointed head of a department by this act or by ordinance except- ing the purchase of materials and supplies, to another head of a department or board or com- mission. Sect. 7. Neither the City Council nor either branch thereof nor any committee or member there- of shall directly or indirectly take part in the employment of labor, the purchase of material, the construction, alteration or repair of any public works or other property, or in the care, custody or management of the same, or in general in the expenditure of public money or in the conduct of the executive or administrative business of the city, except as may be necessary for defraying the con- tingent and incidental expenses of the City Council or of either branch thereof; nor shall they or either of them take part in the making of con- tracts. You will perceive that by the provisions of the first section of the act, the Mayor is vested with all the executive powers which had been before vested in the City Council ; in this, that the power of the City Council to elect heads of departments by concurrent vote of both branches thereof was taken from the Council and vested in the Mayo 8 MAYOR’S ADDREvSS. thereby making the Mayor responsible, by impli- cation, for the heads of the departments, and the manner in which they might discharge the duties of their respective offices. The Legislature in its wisdom saw fit to annul and repeal the first sec- tion of the act in February, 1897, thereby depriv- ing the Mayor of all power to appoint heads of departments, and revesting in the City Council the power to choose the heads of departments by concurrent vote, leaving the remainder of the act as it was originally passed. I will now call your attention to Sections five, six and seven of the act. By the provisions of Section five the heads of the several departments and officers shall have the power to appoint, employ and discharge all sub- ordinate officers and employes in their respective departments. What does this mean? Does it mean that the heads of departments can create such subordinate offices as they may choose to create, and fill them with such persons whom they wish to reward* for services rendered to them or to the party? Some heads of departments have and do contend that that right is conferred upon heads of departments b}* the provisions of Section five. They also contend that they, and they alone, have the right to say what compensation such officers shall receive for services. Then, I say, if their contention is right, the municipal ship is running before the wind without chart or compass. We are nearing the danger point, and the sooner 3*011 take some action to remedy the evil, the better it will be for the municipalit} 7 . mayor’s address. 9 Section six provides that the heads of depart- ments and officers shall make and execute all con- tracts pertaining to their respective departments, except for material and supplies, but every con- tract exceeding the sum of three hundred dollars shall be first approved by the Mayor before going into effect. You are aware, gentlemen, that every head of a department, except the Chief of Sup- plies, is chosen by the concurrent vote of both branches of the government, and a majority vote in each branch is necessary to ensure election. It is fair to assume that the majority know the man for whom they vote ; that they know him to be a capable man, with sufficient ability and knowl- edge to make a contract ; that he would honestly discharge his duty, and would faithfully fulfil every trust and obligation. So that when the head of a department enters into a contract in behalf of the city for a public improvement, which is de- manded by a large number of citizens and tax- payers, and presents that contract to the Mayor for his approval, he acts honestly on his best judgment. When the Mayor finds that the con- tract is well and carefully drawn, in wffiich every provision is made for the fullest protection and security, to guard every interest of the city, and a good and substantial bond is given to secure every obligation of the contract, what then becomes the duty of the Mayor? Here is a contract made by the head of a department, in whom the City Council has had the confidence to elect him to a responsible position. The Mayor has confidence in the majority of the City Council, he approves the io mayor’s address. contract in view of that confidence, and because to his mind, to refuse his approval would be to brand the head of the department with dishonor and dis- honesty. I speak of this for the reason that words of censure and criticism are sometimes spoken in regard to the Mayor, because of his approval of contracts, by persons who fail to study the whole situation, and speak or look at it in a partisan spirit. It is a maxim of the criminal law, that every one charged with crime is assumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty ; so it is fair and right to assume that every head of a department is honest in the discharge of his duty when he enters into a contract in behalf of the cit} r , more espec- ially when the Mayor is of the same opinion that the members of the City Council had when they chose him to fill his responsible position. By the provision of Section seven of the amend- ment to the cit} T charter, 3-011 will see that prac- tically the only power the City^ Council has re- garding the city expenditures, is the power to appropriate the mone}^ to carry on the different departments of the government. You have no con- trol over its expenditure, only to say for what it should be expended. Hence the onl}- way in which 3-011 can exercise economy' is in making the appropriations for the different departments of the cit}\\ The question then arises, Can it be in the Department of Public Schools, which occupies 52 school buildings, which cost $1,588,700, and are attended by 10,872 chil- dren? To instruct these children over 300 teachers mayor’s address. 1 1 are employed, whose salaries reach nearly $195,000. This refers to the day schools. In addition to the pupils in the day schools, we have 2,000 pupils in regular attendance in evening schools, which gives employment to 155 teachers. The salaries of these teachers, with the supervisors, amount to $20,756.84. This sum, added to the salaries of the day teachers, will reach $220,000. During the past year, the sum of $29,500 was appropriated to build an annex to the High School. This annex is to be built on land owned by the city, situated on the corner of Paige and John Streets. You may be called on during the year to appropriate an additional sum to that already appropriated to build and furnish this annex. The question for you to say is, In what way can we economize in our School Department, and keep the schools of Lowell up to the high standard which they have always maintained? “ The preservation of our republic requires that we spare no effort upon the education of its future rulers. The in- struction of our youth gives us a security and peace beyond anything that law or police can give. These are but the external arm of the body poli- tic. Education is its very breath of life. ” SEWERS. A system of sewers is an imperative necessity in cities. Sewers have been built the past year in tliirty-five streets of our city, at an expense of $80,842.57. I scarcely can see where you can economize in appropriating money for sewers, be- cause the people demand them, and the health and 12 mayor’s address. comfort of the communitj' depend upon careful and perfect drainage. STREETS. During the past year thirty-five streets have been macadamized, at a cost of $31,500. Fifty-three streets have been graded, at a cost of $13,904.65. New sidewalks were laid a cost of $10,127.61, and sidewalks were repaired at a cost of $13,904.65. The total cost to December 1st was $62,496.63. Smooth paving was laid during the past year, in Westford Street, 3,382 lineal feet, cost, $27,007.33 ; Suffolk Street, 1,446 lineal feet, cost, $7,120.33; Mammoth Road, 950 lineal feet, cost, $14,469.55 ; total, 5,778 lineal feet; total cost, $48,597.21. There have been during the latter part of the year 1S99, several petitions praying that certain streets be paved with smooth paving. Some of the petitioners have asked for asplialtina, while others have called for Trinidad Lake asphalt. I have 110 knowledge of the relative merits of any kind of smooth paving other than that imparted to me by the Superintendent of Streets in a conversation with me, and by a communication addressed to me, which communication was published in the news- papers of the city. Smooth paving in Lowell is an experiment, and it would be well to make haste slowl}' in regard to using either of them, and I would recommend the utmost investigation and caution before deciding which to use. I would ask you to carefully examine the condition of the asphalt pavement on Aiken Street, and the asplialtina pave- ments on Westford and Suffolk Streets, and the mayor’s address. J 3 asplialtiua pavement oil Mammoth Road, in refer- ence to the time tliejr were laid, and all facts concerning them, or either of them. Yon might, by that examination, gain some knowledge that would lead yon to prefer one before the other, or reject both. WATER WORKS. The citizens now depend upon driven wells for their supply of water. One set of wells are known as the “ Cook wells, ” situated in the vicinity of City Farm. The other set of wells are known as the “ Boulevard wells, ” and are situated on the banks of the Merrimack River. These two systems of wells were put in a few years ago at consid- erable expense, and were expected to yield an abun- dant supply of pure water for domestic purposes. The management of the Water Department so thought, and were happy in the thought, until early last year they were informed by the State Board of Health, that the water from the “ Cook wells ” had such action upon lead pipe that the use of the water was dangerous to the public health. Con- sultations were had between the State Board, our own Board of Health and the Water Board, which resulted in investigations which are still going on, and which it is hoped will result in giving us an abundant supply of pure water, which will be sat- isfactory to the community. The finances of the Department for the year 1899, the month of December being estimated, are: receipts, $203,763.74 ; expenses, $198,055.04. These figures show that the present management, under mayor’s address. 14 tlie direction of the gentlemen who compose the Water Board, still maintain the excellent standing which this Department has always sustained. FIRE DEPARTMENT. It is conceded 011 all hands that our Fire De- partment is in a high state of efficiency ; second to none in the state. Men and equipments are in excellent condition. The number of lofty build- ings in the business and central portion of the city, have been for some time considered a source of danger to life and property, in case of fire. In some degree to obviate that danger, a water tower was purchased for the Fire Department some years ago. It has been seldom used, and was considered by many to be of doubtful utility ; it had 110 permanent abiding place, but it always had friends and supporters, so that in the last da3^s of the year just closed, tlie sum of $14,000 was ap- propriated to furnish a permanent place for the water tower, on Middle Street, in the central part of the city. Let us hope and trust, that if the emergency should ever arise, that the water tower will meet the fullest expectation of its friends. CITY LIBRARY. This institution is now, and for some years has been, under the management of a Board of Trustees, that is appointed by the Mayor, and confirmed by the Board of Aldermen. The Trustees have the sole control of the Library, and the expendi- ture of all moneys appropriated by the City Council for the Library Department. The City Librar} T and mayor’s address. 15 Reading Room are among the most conspicuous places of interest in the city, and we take delight in showing visitors these institutions, in which we take just pride. LIQUOR LICENSE LAW. At the municipal election of 1898, the citizens by a majority of their votes, said that no intoxi- cating liquors could be sold in Lowell from May 1st, 1899, to May 1st, 1900. In my inaugural address of last year, I said that the Mayor and City Council of Lowell had no control over the Police, because by the force of the statutes of the Commonwealth, all the powers that were heretofore vested in the Mayor and City Council of Lowell in regard to the Police Department, were vested in the Police Commission. So that the duty of enforc- ing the law rests with that Commission. Eight months have passed since the first of May, 1899. Has the law been enforced? Have the Police Com- missioners made every reasonable effort to enforce the law? Has the sale of liquor been diminished in Lowell? Has there been less drunkenness in our city for the past eight months? These ques- tions have been already answered by every fair- minded citizen. I would not have alluded to this matter if it were not for the fact that some people have said, “ Why don’t the Maj r or turn out the Police Commissioners ; they don’t enforce the law. ” The answer to that is, where is your evidence that the Commissioners and the Police have not made every reasonable effort to enforce the law, and are still doing so. No evidence contrary to i6 mayor’s address. that has been furnished me — has not even been offered. As my experience as a practicing lawyer for several years in the courts, has given me some knowledge of the many difficulties that are in the way to obtain evidence that will secure convictions for violations of the liquor law, I am of the opinion,' all things considered, that we have had, for the past eight months, the best enforcement of the law we ever had in Lowell. assessors’ department. In the year 1898, previous to the passage of an ordinance of the City Council restricting the number of, and time employed by’ the working force in the Assessors’ Department, there were employed three assessors, six assistant assessors and two clerks, throughout the y’ear; also, some ten temporary’ clerks for varying periods of time, as the varyung neces- sities of the work seemed to require ; also, for short periods, during the months of May’ and June, needed interpreter service was provided for. Under the restrictive requirements of the new ordinance, as affecting 1S99, the assistant assessors have been in service during the months of May^ and June only’, and the temporary’ clerks, their number reduced to six, — have been employed dur- ing the months of May’ to September inclusive, only. It was seen that some revision in methods of work was necessary’, if the statutory’ requirements were complied with under the new restrictive ordi- nance. Such revision being made, the work pro- ceeded, and the end of the active season for mayor’s address. 17 assessing, and for recording the results, found that task completed, the tax lists being committed to the collector, on time, August 31st, 1899. In 1898, the Assessors’ Department expended $20,823.73, of which sum $19,808.82 was pay roll and $1,0x4.91 was supply account, while in 1899 the pay roll account was reduced, under the work- ings of the new ordinance, to $13,789.75, or $6,019.07 less than in 1898 ; the supply account remaining constant. As the new ordinance did not affect the pay roll account until March, 1899, it is a safe prediction that that item of expense will be still further re- duced in the year 1900, unless unforseen contin- gencies should arise. I would recommend to the City Council, as a matter which would be of much assistance to the Board of Assessors, the consideration of legislation in the form of a building ordinance, such as is in vogue in other cities of the Commonwealth. I take pleasure in commending the work of this Department, since the passage of the new ordi- nance. STATE AID DEPARTMENT. The work in this Department has materially in- creased in the past six years, orving to the new laws enacted by the State of Massachusetts in favor of the soldiers of the Civil War and the War with Spain and their families. The expenditures in this office for 1899 are as follows : i8 mayor’s address. Military Aid, (Civil War). $6,131.00 Military Aid, (War with Spain) 1,919.00 State Aid, (Civil War) 14,820.00 State Aid, (War with Spain). 422.00 Soldiers’ Relief. 8,478.29 State Aid, office expenses $3 1,770.29 1 , 730-39 $33,500.68 Of tlie amount paid out for relief under the several laws, about two-tliirds is reimbursed hy the State to the city. Hubert M. Potter, a veteran of the Civil War, is now, as he has been for several years, Super- intendent of State Aid. Miss Maiy C. Brennan, the daughter of a veteran soldier of the War of the Rebellion, is Assistant Superintendent of State Aid. Both are performing the duties of their re- spective offices with abilitv, and are satisfactorj 7 to all concerned. HUNTINGTON AND JACKSON HALES. I am informed by Mr. Gillow, Superintendent of Public Buildings, that the rebuilding of these halls is progressing as fast as could be expected, con- sidering existing circumstances, and he is in hopes that they will be finished and opened for public use about the latter end of April. I am informed from the same source, that an additional appropri- ation of $20,000, which 3^ou will be called upon to appropriate, is needed to finish and furnish these halls. i9 mayor’s address. THE TAX RATE. It is beyond tlie memory of tlie oldest citizen to recall wlien tliere was no fault found with the tax rate. At every municipal election the tax rate is the slogan that is sounded to rally the clans of those who are seeking the votes of fellow citi- zens, to bestow upon them the honors that can be attained in holding an office in the municipal government. The voters get the impression about election time, that the unfortunate who happens to be the Mayor of the city is responsible for the tax rate, and they are made to believe that the Mayor can raise and lower the taxes at his own sweet will. This may be an absurd way to put it, but if those people who find fault would reflect for a moment that sewers and drains are necessary for the public health and comfort, and that streets must be built to keep pace with the march of progress, and get worn out and need repairing. To repair them when necessary is economy; not to do so is discreditable and extravagant. Sidewalks are demanded. What is a luxury in a small town is a necessity in a city numbering nearly 100,000 in population. Some of us can remember our police force when it numbered about thirty men, when a city marshal, a deputy and three warrant officers constituted the whole day force. The night patrol- men assembled in the guard-room at the police station. They were under the charge of a captain, whose headquarters were at the station house, and at stated times during the night he visited each man on his beat. The city marshal was allowed 20 mayor’s address. the use of one horse, and one horse was all that was used in the department. No commissioners, nor commissioners’ clerks ; no police telegraph system ; no hurry-up wagons, nor a thousand and one things that go to make up the costly Police Department of today. The Street and Sewer Departments have grown to magnificent proportions since the time there was a superintendent and assistant who acted as time-keeper and clerk. It is the same with the Fire and all the other Departments. Every- De- partment uses the most modern and improved appli- ances and methods to do the work and business of their respective Departments, and to do all this costs money. It costs money to build your sewers and streets, to pave and repair your streets and sidewalks. In fact, to give you all the necessaries, or luxuries, if you please, of a municipality, it costs money. You must take care of your poor and in- sane; that is charity, but it costs money. To protect our lives aild property- costs money-, and the bills must be paid. But how will y T ou raise the moneys to pay with? There are two way’s to do that: One is by direct taxation, and the other is to borrow, and let posterity- pay- a share of the bills. We have been borrowing for fifteen y-ears, until we nearly^ struck the debt limit a half a dozen times in the y-ear, and we now pay^ nearly- $125,000 a year in interest on the moneys we have borrowed To borrow- more money-, it seems to me, would add. still more to our heavy;- burden. Our only- duty- is to consider where and in what way- can we econo- mize. It is for y-ou to consider if any- or all our Departments can be so conducted as to lessen the mayor’s address. 2 I cost of their maintenance, and then to discharge your duty without fear or favor.

Reports of committees shall be made to the board first meeting after such reports are prepared and signed. 5. No committee shall act by separate consultation, and no report shall be received unless agreed to in committee actually assembled. 6. It shall be the duty of every joint committee (the Committee on Streets excepted) to whom any subject may be specially referred, to report thereon within five weeks, or ask for further time. 7. The by-laws of the city shall be termed ordinances; the enacting clause of which shall be — Be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Lowell, as follows: In all votes by which either or both branches of the City Council express anything by command, the form of expression shall be, Ordered, and whenever either or both branches express opinions, principles, facts or purposes, the form shall be, Resolved. 8. v An ordinance may originate in either board, and shall be considered in three several stages. It shall first be read for information, and the question shall then be on ordering it to the Joint Standing Committee on Ordinances and Legislation, and then sent to the other branch for concurrence. When MUNICIPAL REGISTER. 5 reported back, the recommendations of the committee shall first be acted on. If it shall then be ordered to a second reading, it shall next be examined by a standing committee of that board, who shall see that it is drawn in proper form. When returned by such committee, the question shall be on ordering it to be •enrolled. If so ordered, it shall then be sent to the other board, where the same order of proceedings shall be observed. When it has been ordered by both branches to be enrolled, it shall be enrolled by the Clerk of the Common Council, and shall be by him submitted to the proper committee of that board to ascertain if it has been correctly enrolled. If so reported, the question shall be on passing it to be ordained. If it shall so pass, it shall be signed by the President of the Common Council, and be sent to the Board of Aldermen, where it shall take a like course. If passed to be ordained in that board, it shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board of Aldermen and sent to the Mayor for his approval. 9. An ordinance may be rejected in any stage, but may not pass through all its stages in the same day. Each board shall transmit to the other all papers on which any ordinance, joint resolution, or order shall be founded; and all papers on Iheir passage between the two boards, shall be under the signa- ture of their respective clerks, except ordinances and joint resolutions in their last stage, which shall be signed by the pre- siding officers. If papers come before either board which have been duly acted upon in the other board, the presiding officer shall so state without reading the endorsements of the clerk, unless the latter are called for. 6 MUNICIPAL REGISTER. 10. All enrolled ordinances shall be written in a fair and legible hand, or typewritten, provided a permanent record rib- bon is used, without interlineations or erasures, and no enrolled ordinance or resolution shall be amended. 11. Every joint resolution shall be read in the board in which it is introduced, and the question shall be upon ordering it to a second reading. If so ordered, the question shall then be upon its passage. If passed, it shall be sent to the other board, where the order of proceeding shall be the same. When passed by both boards, the resolution shall be presented to the Mayor for his approval, and when the same shall be in force, shall be enrolled by the Clerk of the Common Council, and when found correctly enrolled as provided in the case of an ordi- nance it shall be signed by the President of the Common Council and the Chairman of the Board of Aldermen, and be presented to the Mayor for his signature if he approved the original. 12. Joint orders shall require but one reading, and when adopted, shall be sent to the Mayor for his approval, except when they relate to a question of a convention of the two branches, or the election of any officer. 13. When either board does not concur with the other in any ordinance or resolution sent from the other, notice of such non-concurrence shall be given by a written message. 14. I11 any case of non-concurrence, each board may appoint a Committee of Conference. Such committee shall con- sist, in each case, of three members who support the vote of MUNICIPAL REGISTER. 7 their own board. These two committees may meet jointly or separately, and a majority of each shall decide its action. 15. All reports and other papers submitted to the City Council shall be written in a fair hand, or typewritten, provided a permanent record ribbon is used, without endorsement, except in case of the introduction of an order or resolution. In such a case, the member introducing an order or resolution shall sub- scribe his name at the bottom of the back of the same. All other endorsements upon the back of papers shall be made by the clerk; and the clerks of the boards respectively, shall, on season- able notice, make copies of any papers to be reported by committees, at the request of the respective chairmen thereof. 16. No business shall be transacted by the City Council in convention, except such as shall have been previously agreed on, unless by unanimous consent. 17. In balloting in joint convention, blanks shall be reported but not counted as votes. 18. When both boards are in session at the same time, neither shall adjourn without giving notice to the other of its intention. 19. All petitions, reports, or other papers of whatever description, relating to business requiring the concurrent action of both boards of the City Council, shall be submitted by com- mittees to the clerk of each board at least twenty-four hours before the time of meeting of either board, and the clerk of each board shall prepare a brief synopsis of all matters to be acted upon, and place the same on the desk of each member of 8 MUNICIPAL REGISTER. the City Council prior to the hour of opening the meeting. No reports or orders not previously furnished as herein described, shall be considered in either branch unless two-thirds of the members present consent thereto. 20. These rules may be suspended for a specific purpose, or amended, whenever twenty-four members of a joint convention of the two branches shall so direct, or whenever a joint order to that effect shall be passed by the votes of six members of the Board of Aldermen and eighteen members of the Common Council. 21. No resolution for the extension and laying out of any street or public highway shall be passed to a second reading by either branch of the City Council until the city civil engineer shall certify to the council that said street or highway is fully completed, and graded to the grades named in the resolution, without expense to the city. 22. A yea and nay vote of the members of the City Council shall be required to pass any order or vote involving the expendi- ture or the appropriation of the public moneys, or involving any debt or liability, and such vote shall be entered upon the records of each branch of the City Council. 23.
