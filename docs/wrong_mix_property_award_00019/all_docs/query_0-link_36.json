Mother: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING (011) (1897-1962) Father: LEWIS SAXTON MOSHER (012) (1896-1973) Spouse: ROBERT LYNN GRISWOLD (002) (1924-1995) Wedding: 6/11/1949, Erie, PA. Child 1: LEWIS LYNN GRISWOLD (004) ( - ) Child 2: FREDERICK ROBERT GRISWOLD (001) ( - ) Child 3: ROGER WALLING GRISWOLD (005) ( - ) Attended Strong Vincent High School in Erie, then majored in English at Allegheny College. This was during the War years, and when she got to college in 1944 there were 300 girls in her class and only 100 boys. She met Dad at a fraternity party. Their wedding was conducted by Rev. Cyrus Moorhead, son-in-law of Uncle Will Walling, in the house on Cherry Street where she grew up. After they were married they moved to Hawaii where she worked in a photography shop. When Dad was in grad school at Berkeley she was a receptionist at a psychological clinic there. She was secretary at Bidwell School for a couple years when I was a student there. After they got divorced in 1968 she moved from Stockton to Palo Alto where she worked for a few years at a hi-tech start-up run by Bill Odell (who was the son of Carey Odell, a Hollywood set designer whose name can occasionally be seen in the credits of old movies). After that went bust, she worked for various other Silicon Valley hi-tech places including as a secretary at Xerox for 10 years, mostly at the Palo Alto Research Center, one of the highest-tech places in the Valley. Currently lives in Menlo Park, Ca. next to Rog and Silvia. She was a kid during the Depression. She says some people didn't have enough to eat and literally froze in their homes during the cold winters right next to Lake Erie. The depression didn't really end until 1939 when the war started, and then there was rationing. Along about 1943 was when it got worse; nobody could get enough gasoline to drive very far, and Mom sometimes had trouble getting back to college at Allegheny in Meadville, only 45 miles away. Sometimes she would stop off with Uncle Ralph in Corry. It paid to know your butcher so maybe he would slip in a little extra meat; you might not even know what it was til you got home. (Mom continued this habit of going to a butcher store years later, she always got her meat from the Yosemite Meat Market in Stockton when I was a kid.) But they got plenty of eggs, they could always get a few dozen from Mr. Crossman out by the farm. Work was easy to find during the war, and she had one job in accounting making out payrolls, right next to the New York Central Railroad station, so at break time she was always treated to the dramatic partings and homecomings of soldiers outside. She said she also had a job modeling clothes in a department store, and another testing bomb warheads for the last 5 or 6 weeks of the war, and then suddenly the jobs were all gone. Mom grew up in Erie with Ann Bradford Davis, the actress who played the housekeeper on the Brady Bunch. Mom calls her Schultzie. We have a kindergarten picture of them. Schultzie had an identical twin sister, Harriet. Mom was practically the only person who could ever tell them apart. They were both good actresses, in fact the whole family were born performers, all you had to do was put a microphone in front of them. Mom says that in a few of the Brady Buch episodes she thinks it's really Harriet playing the housekeeper, not Schultzie. ID: 008 Name: MARY LOU MOSHER Sex: F Birth place: Erie, PA Mother: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING (011) (1897-1962) Father: LEWIS SAXTON MOSHER (012) (1896-1973) Note: Aunt Lulu Worked for years as a textbook editor in New York. Published many history textbooks. She was nicknamed Lulu by Aunt Annie. Like Aunt Annie and some other forbears, she chose a writing-related career. This is the only career choice that seems to have lasted in this family, other things like medicine, the law, and banking having fizzled out. She went to Vassar and majored in English Lit. Mom says she had a job during the war in a factory that made refrigerators. After they were spray-painted excess paint would collect down at the bottom of the box they were painted in, and her job was to clean out the excess. The name Mary goes way back in this family. Her mother, Marietta Marshall Walling, was named after her aunt Mariette Marshall (Aunt Ettie), and in the generation before that, there was Maria Marshall, an unusual name for the daughter of an Irishman. Marietta Marshall Walling also had a great-grandmother named Mary Harringdeen. ID: 009 Name: ROBERT WALLING MOSHER Sex: M Birth date: Dec. 15, 1923 Birth place: Erie, Pa. Date of death: Mar. 14, 2014 Place of death: Clearwater, Fla Age at death: 90 years, 2 months, 27 days. Mother: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING (011) (1897-1962) Father: LEWIS SAXTON MOSHER (012) (1896-1973) Spouse: GERTRUDE HORNER (010) (1912-2008) Wedding: 12/21/1963 Note: Uncle Bob Stock market fan. Lived in Clearwater, Fla. Got his picture in the paper when he was a kid for winning a fox trot competition. Avid golf nut, like his father. He got 2 holes-in-one, just like the old man. He worked midnight shift at an aircraft plant, putting together propellers or something early in the war, then he was in the Army reserves, and studied medicine as an undergraduate for a couple years at places like Cornell and Yale, on the Army's dime. He also had a job once working for a trucking company, planning out routes for the trucks, which he seems to have liked even though he didn't keep that job. He met Aunt Gertrude in New York. She was living in the apartment above Aunt Annie, but she was off in places like Geneva a lot, and having an empty apartment above her made Aunt Annie nervous, so Aunt Gertrude sub-let it to Uncle Bob. That's how they met, and then later they surprised everyone by getting married. As of 1998, they've lived in a condo in Clearwater for 30 years. They were big on charity work for the Salvation Army, especially Aunt Gertrude. Uncle Bob was a Republican, like his father; Mom and Aunt Lulu, on the other hand, are lifelong Democrats like Aunt Annie. He and Aunt Gertrude are buried in Serenity Gardens Memorial Park Cemetery on Indian Rocks Rd. in Largo Fla. In 1961 he drove me all the way across the country to Erie, so I could visit my grandparents. This was after staying with us in the house on Acacia Street for maybe a year, in Lew's room, when he worked at a bank in Oakdale. I still remember a few things about that trip. I remember driving thru the Rockies, with the beautiful rock formations on those tricky, winding mountain roads, and a big thunderstorm there bad enough to make us stop at a rest area at the side of the road until it was over. At my insistence we always at a motel with a swimming pool. The only place name I can remember from that trip is Cheyenne, Wyoming, bound to make an impression on a 7-year-old with its Western-sounding name. We saw Dick Clark on TV there, though I had trouble figuring out what Dick Clark was doing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Uncle Bob came back to California maybe a year later and stayed with us again, and not many years after that he married Aunt Gertrude and they moved to Florida, after which we didn't see them more than once or twice every 10 years or so. ID: 010 Name: GERTRUDE HORNER Sex: F Birth date: Aug. 24, 1912 Birth place: White Plains, N. Y.? Date of death: Jan. 2, 2008 Age at death: 95 years, 4 months, 9 days. Spouse: ROBERT WALLING MOSHER (009) (1923-2014) Wedding: ? 12/21/1963 Note: Aunt Gertrude One-time spymaster. She told me she worked for the OSS (precursor of the CIA) during World War II. Went for 2 or 3 years without ever taking a day off. Came down with pneumonia a couple of times because she worked so hard. She had a ring of spies all over the Pacific. A couple of them were killed and one had his legs shot off. Had access to classified info about the American POW's, so she always knew where her ex-fiance was, since he had somehow fallen into the hands of the Japanese. I got her OSS record from the National Archives. It contains a fair amount of information about her, but it leaves out the cloak-and-dagger stuff. A medical examination done on her in 1942 has her living at 145 W. 12th St. in Manhattan and working in the office of the Coordinator of Information on 5th Ave. She was 5' 9 1/2\", 129 1/2 lbs. (19 pounds underweight - she was always kind of tall and skinny), apparently wore corrective lenses because her right eye was bad, and had an appendectomy scar. On 5/21/1942 she was living at 145 W. 12th St. in Manhattan, starting 11/1940, though her legal residence is listed as 53 Chatterton Ave. in White Plains, her parents' house. She went to White Plains High School, then Lasell Junior College in Auburndale Mass. for 2 years. She lists 2 relatives as employed by the government: Miss Miriam Horner of the Federal Income Tax Dept. in Camden NJ, and Roland Coney, uncle by marriage, of the post office in Bridgeton NJ. She had had a couple of jobs as a stenographer, then a couple more as a secretary, including her present one at the Coordinator of Information office which she started 5/1/1942. No arrests or lawsuit involvements. As references she gives, among others, George Campbell who was a clerk at the Appellate Div., Supreme Ct., Madison Sq., NYC; and R. E. Dougherty, VP of the New York Central Railroad. She had lived at 49 W. 11th St., NYC from 7/1939 to 11/1940, and before that at 5 Prospect Place, NYC (Tudor City). She had hazel eyes, auburn hair, and a freckled complexion; and lists J. M. Horner at the address in White Plains to be notified in case of emergency. She adds this comment: \"The firm of Condit & Hite, which employed me from January 1933 to about April, 1936, did as its main work mortgage foreclosure. When the 'mortgage moratorium' was declared\" - what a concept - \"it was necessary to cut the office staff and I was let out.\" An undated job application in her OSS file says she worked from 2/1940 to 5/1942 for Malcolm A. MacIntyre of Pruitt, Hale and MacIntyre as a secretary \"handling files and confidential government contracts with an aircraft company\", making $200 a month. She left when Mr. MacIntyre went into the army. Before that she was a stenographer for Sullivan and Cromwell at 48 Wall St. at $42.50 a week. At her current job for the Coordinator of Information as secretary for John J. McDonough she took care of confidential reports \"pertaining to the national security of the U.S.\" She graduated high school after 3 years. For a question about the number of words per minute she could type, she said \"Fast\". She lists her father as J. Milton Horner. A Field Classification Sheet dated 5/13/1942 says she's a Principal Clerk Stenographer (right above \"secretary\" which is crossed out) and says that as a part of her duties she \"takes and transcribes difficult techincal and non-technical dictation concerning secret and highly confidential data\". A letter dated 5/21/1942 to Col. William J. Donovan, who was the head of the OSS, informed him that authority was granted for the appointment of Gertrude Horner to the position of secretary. A letter to William H. Sherwood of the OSS dated Jan. 4, 1943 and signed by her reads thus: \"I hereby tender my resignation from the position of Principal Clerk Stenographer at a salary at the rate of $2300 per year in the Special Activities Branch, Special Intelligence Division of the New York office of the Office of Strategic Services, to take effect at the close of business of the 31st day of December, 1942.\" On 10/1/1944 she got a raise from $2600 to $3000 a year. A memo from 10/11/1944 says, \"She handles the funds for the insurance unit in N. Y. and is the administrative officer for the unit.\" Her position corresponded to that of military personnel of company grade, as of 2/5/1954. At the end of the war, she resigned from the OSS, effective 9/30/1945, apparently to take a job with Sullivan & Cromwell. She had been with the OSS for three and a half years, meaning she started in early-to-mid 1942. She told me once she didn't make much money at the OSS, no more than a private in the Army got, but her landlord somehow found out something about her work and gave her a break on the rent. She was a good writer, judging from a couple of coherent and mistake-free things she wrote in her OSS file. After the war, she was a secretary for Arthur H. Dean, an ambassador and lawyer for one of the 10 biggest law firms in the world. She went to places like Geneva with him for international conferences. She knew many politicans and diplomats, including almost all the big players in international affairs of those days. John Foster Dulles asked her to be his secretary when he became Secretary of State, but she turned him down because the Secretary of State doesn't have much job security. She was good friends with Abba Eban. She used to take the elevator with Eleanor Roosevelt at the U. N., who she says was very likeable and friendly. Also at the U. N., she once found Clark Clifford (future Secretary of State under LBJ) working at a desk in a room she thought had been assigned to her boss Arthur H. Dean. She politely informed him of this, and he just as politely informed her he believed she was mistaken. He turned out to be right. I think this was in late 1961. Mr. Dean never did find out. She also knew Lyndon Baines and Lady Bird Johnson, as well as George Ball and Dean Rusk. She met JFK. \"I never met Eisenhower, but I used to talk to him on the phone\", she said. Another thing she said is, \"I'd never trust a politician any farther than I could throw him.\" In her later years she had little interest in her former Washington life. She got uterine and breast cancer in the early 60's, back when chemotherapy was new. (She says Foster Dulles's son got cancer about that time. They did some kind of brain operation on him and it left him basically a vegetable.) She got a hysterectomy, and for a while the doctors weren't sure she should marry Uncle Bob, but eventually they did so, a little after Uncle Bob's birthday in 1963. She kept working for a year or two after that, but then she quit and they were happily married almost 45 years. I went to Clearwater in about 1973. Aunt Gertrude was very helpful in finding me a job and a place to live. Aunt Lulu wrote the following for Aunt Gertrude's memorial service: \"Gertrude and I were introduced by my (and Bob's) aunt Ann Mosher in 1958. We were all living on West 13th St. in Manhattan, right around the corner from the Salvation Army divisional headquarters, although the Army is not part of this story. There were four old red brick houses that had been cut up into apartments and were owned by an Italian family.The wife Caroline was our landlady. \"Gertrude lived at 213, I lived at 215, and Aunt Ann at 217. We socialized from time to time, but Gertrude had very high-powered job as right-hand woman to the managing partner of Sullivan and Cromwell, the Wall St. law firm, so her free time was limited and on weekends she often went to Westchester County to see her mother. She impessed me greatly, a tall red-haired woman beautifully dressed in tailored tweed suits, with a voice you couldn't miss and an infectious laugh. \"In the early 1960s my brother Bob came to New York to work. Our landlady Caroline found him a small basement apartment at 217, and by this time Gertrude had moved from the top floor of 213 to the top floor of 217. Aunt Ann still lived on the third floor of 217. In the course of time Bob and Gertrude began a secret courtship right under our noses. How they kept it from the nosy neighbors I have never known, but when they called in November of 1963 to invite me to their wedding in December I was the most surprised, and pleased, person in New York City.\" Mom says Aunt Annie was the only one who suspected anything. \"They were married in the Methodist church at 7th. Avenue and 13th St. and Bob moved upstairs at 217 to the top floor. \"When I first knew Gertrude she was known as Jackie Horner to most people; because of her height and with the maiden name of Horner, she gained the nickname from the old nursery rhyme about Little Jack Horner. After they married, Bob decided that being known as a couple as Bob and Jack Mosher was a little too much., so Gertrude became Gertrude to us all. \"She was a wonderful sister-in-law, always delighted and welcoming when I would come to Florida for a bit of r and r.And she was the best possible person for my brother to be married to. He was fortunate and we were too when she became a member of the Mosher family.\" ID: 011 Name: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING Sex: F Birth date: July 23, 1897 Birth place: Erie, Pa. Date of death: Dec. 12, 1962 Place of death: Erie, Pa. Age at death: 65 years, 4 months, 19 days. Mother: GRACE ELLEN MARSHALL (029) (1859-1945) Father: EMORY ANDREW SCOTT WALLING (028) (1854-1931) Spouse: LEWIS SAXTON MOSHER (012) (1896-1973) Wedding: 9/26/1922, Erie, Pa. Child 1: ROBERT WALLING MOSHER (009) (1923-2014) Child 2: NATALIE MOSHER (003) ( - ) Child 3: MARY LOU MOSHER (008) ( - ) The engraving plate for her wedding invitations still exists. It was made into a tray. It's made out of brass, and you have to hold it up to a mirror to read it. A hundred people came to her wedding. She was raised more by her Aunt Ettie than by her mother. (One gets the impression that the oldest children got the lion's share of the attention in that family.) Aunt Ettie had sparse hair (just like Aunt Lulu and Grace E. and Uncle Will), and in those days the style was to bundle the hair up on top of the head. So she bought what was called a transformation, or, more colloquially, a \"rat\". It was a small hairpiece she put up on top of her head, and bundled her own hair around it. Grandma was so impressed that she went thru the neighborhood telling about Aunt Ettie's rat on her head. Aunt Ettie didn't appreciate it. She was the youngest of her siblings. They were society folks, and she got her picture in the paper every now and then, for things like being an officer in the Junior League. Mom says it was a bit difficult for her to adjust to her middle-class lifestyle as an adult. Whenever one of her daughters went out with a guy, she would say \"Is he from a good family?\" Grandpa made fun of her for that. She took a year off before she went to Vassar. She graduated just before she turned 23. From an undated article about her engagement from Eric More Marshall, the headline is: \"Miss Walling's Engagement to L. S. Mosher Announced\". It says: \"Of outstanding interest to various social circles will be the announcement made today of the engagement of Miss Marietta Walling, daughter of Justice and Mrs. Emory A. Walling, of 552 West Eighth street... \"Miss Walling is a grduate of Central high school and of Vassar college, class of 1920. She is very popular in the younger social set and club groups.... The wedding will take place in the fall.\" The Walling-Elliot family reunion notes have their wedding date as Sept. 30th, 1922. She went to her sister Marion's wedding in Philadelphia, and wrote back to her family about it, apparently on a train on her way back to Vassar. Written Mar. 10, 1918, the day after the wedding, this letter is in the possession of Anne Crawford Lurie: \"Sunday evening \"En Route from New York to Po'keeps__\" - Poughkeepsie \"Dear Family Who Weren't There: \"Well, it is all over, and I am on my way back to the grind again. It ocurrred to me that you all might like a little 'inside dope' so I am going to write in spite of the jiggle and only having a pencil. The 'powers that be' at school let me go down Thursday afternoon but I will leave out the preliminaries and get down to the real thing. Yesterday, we were all on pins and needles, more or less, because Lee\" - Crawford, the groom - \"did not know when he could get there and we did not hear from him until four. Then, too, he was afraid that he might not have passed his exams and might have to stay another week, but he did, and they were married in the Second\" - ? - \"Presbyterian Church about half passed six. Only nine out of the 106 who entered in Lee's class graduated. Pretty good for him. \"The ceremony was quite short and simple and Dr. McCall was awfully nice. His assistant, Dr. Green,\" - ? - \"assisted him. John\" presumably John Crawford, Lee's younger brother - \"and I stood up with\" - ? - \"them.\" Sounds like she was the maid of honor and John was the best man. \"My duties weren't very arduous there being no bridal bouquet. John kept the ring and payed the minister. The 'consenting parties' conducted themselves very well. Father\" - Emory A. - \"went with them to get their marriage license, and they giggled a good deal. I guess he thought they weren't taking it seriously enough. The City Hall was closed, so they had to take a taxi way out someplace.\" It sounds as if they got the marriage license and got married all after 4:00 on a Saturday. \"Marion thinks that she promised to obey in the ceremony, but John and I were both listening for it, and are sure that she didn't. We had an awfully nice dinner afterwards. The table was all decorated with greens and pink sincet\" - ? - \"peas and roses with vases of pink flowers. In the center was a fountain. Of course we had a private dining room. We had fruit cocktail, celery & olives, tomato bouillon, fish with little round brown potatoes and cucumbers, squah, candied sweet potatoes, salad with cute little crackers, strawberry ice cream in cupid molds with gold bows and darts, little cakes, coffee, mints and salted nuts. I have probably forgotten something and it was just as good as it sounds. Lee looked great in uniform and Marion was so happy she was fairly radiant. She had a lovely blue suit and hat and a beautiful pink\" - ? - \"waist,\" - ?? - \"The bride and groom held hands during most of the meal. It must have made eating a bit inconvenient, but they did not seem to mind. We told them that we supposed that was why they got married, so they could hold hands in public. \"We all, but Mother and Father, went to the station with them. The taxi didn't come so we went in the street car. They said that nothing was usual about their wedding. They just missed their train, the 9:00 to New York, so we all went back to Mrs. Crawford's\" - presumably Mary Lee Crawford, Lee's mother - \"room at the Bellevue, and then John took Margaret and me to the movies. Margaret came so she could tell all the girls at school about it. They were terribly thrilled, and gave a big party for Marion before she left. They had telegrams brought in at all times, such as: Congratulations we are all for annexation \"The Crown Prince \"You are sentrenced to life imprisonment for desertion of the cause \"President McMillan \"Congratulations, I wish your man were in the Navy He is so strong \"Josephus Daniels.\" (Secretary of the Navy) \"I am sorry that I can't remember the funniest one of all, something about going Leewards. They also had a wedding cake (Marion got the icing)\" - probably a rare commodity during the war - \"and gave her a lovely bouquet and a box of little things like toothpaste and everything imaginable.\" Writing on the back of a page: \"Since I am borrowing this paper, perhaps I had better try economizing a little,. Lee has leave until next Friday. I don't know whether they are going to Erie or not. \"Probably you will have heard everything I have written from Mrs. Crawford by the time this reaches you. Father telegraphed the bare\" - ? - \"news to the Dispatch. I am wondering what sort of a story they will make out of it. Probably 'romance from childhood' or something of the sort. \"You may have some trouble deciphering this. Father thinks my writing atrocious. I will admit that it does not bear jiggling. \"Three weeks from to-day will find little sister\" - Marietta - \"in Erie. It seemed too bad for Marion not to be married at home so that you could all be there, but the war does upset things. \"Lots of love to you all \"From Marietta, an eyewitness.\" In the margin: \"P.S. I crossed the big city all alone in a taxi Thursday and today!\" This last sentence is a reference to New York City. The train down from Poughkeepsie came into Penn Station, but the one to Philadelphia left from Grand Central, and in those days there was no rail connection between them, so you had to take a taxi. The reason the marriage was so rushed was because of the war. Apparently no one expected Lee to graduate so early from the officers' training program he was in, and they were about to ship him overseas, and Aunt Marion wanted to marry him before he left, but she couldn't do so without leaving school three weeks before graduation. Colleges were strict about things like that then - no married students - so it was quite a decision, and she never did graduate. She seems to have had her father's approval or at least co-operation, but her mother didn't care for the idea, so says family tradition. She didn't like her kids going off the reservation like that. At Vassar Grandma majored in Poly Sci, and took botany too. She would take her kids out on nature walks at places like the peninsula or Eastwood Farm, half of which was undeveloped then. She would point out all the different plants, the poison ivy and the insect-eating plants and so on. She would take them out under the stars and tell them all about the North Star and the Big Dipper and the Belt of Orion and all they wanted to do was go to bed. None of it got thru to any of them. Aunt Lulu says she was among the first wave of health food nuts, back in about the 20's. Grandma is listed in the 1921/22 Erie City Directory as boarding at 552 W. 8th (her father's house). Aunt Lulu says she died of emphysema and congestive heart failure. She was an athsmatic for much (all?) of her life.

Vice-president of the Second National Bank of Erie. Was offered a bank presidency when he was about ready to retire. Lived for a year in New Mexico as a kid because of his mother's tuberculosis. Was a first lieutenant in World War I, and apparently saw some pretty heavy action, though no one seems to know much about this. Told me once he was a gunner on board a WWI plane, but he may have been joking. Mom: \"He wasn't a gunner, he was a foot soldier, and a 1st Lieutenant. He was trained in a WWI program where they trained officers in 90 days. They called them '90-day wonders.'\" And: \"Dad almost died overseas - in France - in WWI. He was sent to Marseille to recuperate from, I believe, serious pneumonia.\" When he recovered he was sent back home, in early 1919 - he was there about a year and a half, says Aunt Lulu. His first fiancee died in the flu epidemic when he was in Europe fighting. His parents died when he was 18, leaving him with a 9-year-old kid sister to take care of. He was an avid golf nut, getting 2 holes-in-one in his lifetime. He was big on other kinds of athletics too, more so than others in this family. He got his picture in the paper for being on the board of the Family and Child Service group, and the board of the Red Cross, and for being an incorporator of St. Vincent's Hospital, and for when he got promoted to Assistant Cashier at the Second National Bank. During the Depression, there wouldn't be enough work at the bank so he'd come home at 3:00, which meant they could head out to the beach at 3:30. Nice life. Mom: Kenneman's Bakery was \"about 3 blocks away, had wonderful cinnamon rolls that I've never encountered since. They almost went under during the Depression and Dad, the banker, helped them stay in business.\" And: \"When WWII came along Dad tried to enlist. He was too old, had a family, so they didn't take him. When Mom found out what he had done she had a fit.\" She depended on him for emotional support, plus Uncle Bob was already in the Reserves at that point. So he had to content himself with his leadership role at the local Red Cross. He had the same kind of positive attitude Aunt Annie had. I remember he taught me to play Gin Rummy and ride a bike. \"He was generally cheerful and had a good outlook - I think he realized how lucky he was to be alive. He could always cheer up Mom by giving her a hug or kiss or even a whack on the fanny. She'd brighten right up.\" He came down with juvenile diabetes at age 50, the same age his father was when he died. So he could get by with one insulin shot a day, he took a brisk walk every day; this theoretically kept his blood sugar down. (From what we know today, this may have been the wrong strategy. Exercise is probably more likely to bring your blood sugar up.) In an undated article about his engagement that Eric More Marshall has in a old scrapbook, it says, \"Mr. Mosher was a member of the class of 1918 at Cornell University,\" - it doesn't say whether he graduated - \"and during the World war served as a first lieutenant with the 309th infantry. He is now with the Second National bank.\" It also says he lived at 529 W. 8th st, which must have been just down the block from 552 W. 8th where Miss Walling lived. I first find him in the Erie City Directory in 1915/16, the year after his parants died: \"Mosher Lewis S, student, bds 804 Poplar\". Aunt Annie and Grandma Adelia are there too. Aunt Belle also lived in that house in those years. Hard to say where he was attending school, Cornell is in Connecticut. In 1916/17 it's: \"Mosher Lewis S clk Second National Bank bds 804 Poplar\", same bank his father worked at. Aunt Annie's gone this year. In 1917/18 it's the same except he's listed as a bookkeeper. In 1918/19 he's a bookkeeper (and Aunt Annie's back this year), then in 1919/20 he's a clerk, then in 1920/21 he's a teller. This is also the year Aunt Belle died. (For some reason he's there every year in spite of the war and of college.) He's in the 1921/22 Erie City Directory too: they're boarding at 592 W. 8th St.; he's a teller, Aunt Annie's a student. The progression of events seems to be that first his grandfather Orson died, then his parents died, then his grandmother died, then Aunt Belle died. On top of that, his finacee died during the flu epidemic when he was in Europe, and he himself almost died in the War. The 1934 directory says \"Mosher, Lewis S. (Marietta), asst cash Natl Bank and Trust Co and sec Germer Stone Co h 716 Cherry\". In the entry for the National Bank and Trust Co., he is listed as one of 5 men, the others being the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Vice-President, and the Vice-President-Cashier. He was a Presbyterian (the Church of the Covenant), and a lifelong Republican. His obit says he was a member of \"Keystone Lodge 455, F. & A.M., the Scottish Rites Bodies-Valley fo Erie, Zem Zem Temple Shrine, the Lake Shore Country Club and the Erie Maennerchor.\" He retired in 1965, and died 3 days before I was going to fly back to Erie to visit him. They were having dinner at one of the two the country clubs there, and he just slumped over at the table. He was a diabetic, but Grandma didn't have the presence of mind to have an autopsy done so we don't know what he died of. He and his second wife were at 358 W. 9th when he died. (In 1925 he was living at 1023 W. 8th St.) As for his first name, the executor of his great-grandfather's will was named Lewis A. Saxton. The only other person I can find in his family tree named Lewis was Charles Lewis, who married his great-aunt Amanda Miner. Regarding his middle name, Grandpa said that \"Saxton\" came from \"Sexton\". His best friend was named Earl O'Connor. The night Grandpa was married, Earl O'Connor and his girlfriend eloped. She was Catholic and he wasn't, and in those days that meant something. I knew Mr. O'Connor when I was a kid. They had a nice house, almost an estate, out next to the lake. He had been in a wheelchair for many years, and they had an elevator in their house so he could get upstairs. I remember going up in it, it went awful slow. But he was one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet. Much of the info in this part of the family tree was taken from a transcription of the Mosher family Bible that Aunt Lulu did. Like the other family sources, it doesn't seem to contain anything after Grandpa's birth in 1896. ID: 028 Name: EMORY ANDREW SCOTT WALLING Sex: M Birth date: June 11, 1854 Birth place: Farm in Greene, Pa. Date of death: Dec. 29, 1931 Place of death: 552 W. 8th St., Erie, Pa. Age at death: 77 years, 6 months, 18 days. Mother: LAURA ANN ELLIOTT (076) (1820-1895) Father: THOMAS A. WALLING (075) (1793-1863) Spouse: GRACE ELLEN MARSHALL (029) (1859-1945) Wedding: 4/22 (21?)/1880 Child 1: WILLIAM BENSON WALLING (031) (1881-1966) Child 2: RALPH GORDON WALLING (083) (1885-1965) Child 3: LAURA CORDELIA WALLING (032) (1890-1972) Child 4: MARION ELIZABETH WALLING (082) (1896-1979) Child 5: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING (011) (1897-1962) Note: Middle name may have been Arthur. He was a justice on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. \"He would have been the next chief justice of the state supreme court, had he lived.\" says his obituary. This can be read in one of two ways: if the incumbent Chief Justice died, Judge Walling would have succeeded him; or he was set to become Chief Justice soon no matter what. It turns out Robert S. Frazer was Chief Justice from 1930-36, and Judge Walling died in 1931, so the first explanation must be the right one. Thanks to Scott Coyle and politicalgraveyard.com for this info. \"The leading citizen in Erie\", says Mom. Someone tried to get him to run for Governor once. Born in Erie County, Pa. Grew up on a farm in North East Twp., Pa. Took a cold bath every day. Had a memory like an elephant. If you came up before him, he could rattle off all your previous convictions from memory. Died in his sleep the night of 12/29/1931. Aunt Lulu says he was \"owned\" by some railroad. Aunt Lulu also says he set a precedent on a case where some elderly person signed their name BELOW the dotted line on some document, rather than ON it. He ruled the signature was still valid, since the intent was clear. The precedent stands today. The poem \"By-Gone Days\" by Mrs. Abraham A. (Babcock) Oppenheimer refers to Roby's \"long-legged brother Emory\" who \"Would spell the whole school down\". Maybe this helps explain the lanky appearance of the Wallings of the next generation. My mom says at Christmas he would give a dime to each of his 14 grandchildren. One Christmas she lost her dime, while playing the piano, between two of the white keys. So she asked one of her cousins what to do, who said maybe Grandpa Walling would give her another. Which he was happy to do. \"Early in his first judicial term he presided over the famous murder case of Commonwealth vs. Heidler which resulted in execution by hanging (only the second of this county) after the case had been carried to the Supreme Court (191 Pa. 375). In this case the Supreme Court adopted, in ipsissimis verbis,\" - in the same wording - \"Judge Walling's charge on insanity which then stood out as the standard on this subject matter in criminal law. On the Supreme Court, Justice Walling substantially held up his end of the appellate work as referenced to Supreme Court Report (251 Pa. through 305 Pa.). He was seen by his contemporaries as a 'lawyer's lawyer' and 'a legal genius possessed of the common touch.' \"He was a most companionable and charming associate, and an exceedingly useful member of this Court, an industrious, careful worker, as his many opinions testify, always prompt in disposing of matters referred to him. As an example of his industry, he had written opinions in all cases assigned to him during our last session, and at the time of his death left no unfinished Court work.\" From \"Memoirs of the Erie County Bench and Bar\", v. 2; this last paragraph is from a memorial of him from the minutes of the Supreme Court of PA after his death. \"History of Erie County\", 1925: \"Emory A. Walling's educational training was obtained in the public schools, State Normal School, Edinboro, and Lake Shore Seminary, North East.\" Edinboro is in Washington Twp.; some of Grace E. Marshall's relatives seem to have lived there once. Ralph Hartley's \"Old Day in North East\" column from the North East Breeze, Feb. ?12 1989, says he \"enrolled at the Lake Shore Seminary at age 19. He had no schooling until age 12 and only went to Davis School because a teacher called on his mother and said the law required attendance. She was widowed. \"Emory learned rapidly and was able to meet Seminary entrance requirements. He lacked proper clothes and money, but was permitted tp pay expenses by tending the furnace and other janitorial duties. He chose the Scientific course. He drew some ridicule for his ill-fitting, scruffy clothing. Most students came from well-to-do families, the 'upper crust'.\" His Testimonial says he graduated high school at age 21, on 6/3/1875. His wife, by contrast, according to Hartley's column of 3/1/1989, made the honor roll there 9/13/1877, when she was 18; it doesn't say she graduated that year, but if so she was considerably younger at graduation time than he was. Maybe it's because Emory started school so late. \"History of Erie County\" again: \"In 1878 he successfully took the bar examination and began professional work in Erie County, Pa., there gaining a degree of legal prominence and public favor that resulted in his election as district attorney of that county.\" E. A. Walling of North East is listed as being elected D. A. in 1881 on p. 416 of the \"History of Erie County\", 1884. He was admitted to the Erie Bar on 9/4/1878. He didn't go to law school - in those days most law students read law in the office of an established lawyer, like an apprentice. Got elected D. A. in 1881. (1881 was also the year the first open revolt was made against the power structure of Sen. Simon Cameron, a corrupt Civil War figure in the Pennsylvamia Republican party.) Served til he got elected as a Republican to the State Senate in 1884. Served four years, then went back to private practice. In Nov. 1896 got elected as, and in 1897 became, President Judge of the 6th Judicial District. Got re-elected in 1906. Was named to the supreme court in Philadelphia on 1/3/1916. Was in the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, the Grange, the Elks, etc. Eric Marshall says he was one of the two or three most important Masons in the state, and helped to build the Masonic temple in Erie. An announcement of his death put out by the Masons says he was crowned an Active member of the Supreme Council in Atlantic City on 11/16/1928. The Supreme Council is the governing body of the Masons, so he was really one of the most important ones in the country. Was a lifelong Republican, and a Methodist. Got an honorary L. L. D. degree from Allegheny in 1920. He rated a paragraph in the Who's Who for 1930. His death of a heart attack got a front-page banner headline in the Erie Daily Times, 12/30/1931, Night Final Edition, price two cents. Was buried in Erie Cemetery. There were about 40 honorary pallbearers at his funeral. All his associate justices attended except one who was ill. Note that the dates above, which came from his obit, don't match up too well with the info from the Erie City Directories. 1878 seems to be his first appearance: \"Walling E A, law student with Benson & Brainerd, rooms 31 North Park\". He doesn't show up again til 1882: \"Walling E A, of Simon (?) & Walling, h 400 (?) W 7th\". 1883: \"Walling E A, district attorney, h n w cor 10th and Chest\". 1884/85: \"Walling E A, district attorney, o s s\" - office south side - \"fifth app Court House, h n w cor 10th & Chestnut\". 1885 is the same except he's called an attorney-at-law. Ditto 1886. 1887: \"Walling E A, of Vincent & Walling and State Senator, h 407 Chestnut\". 1888 is the same. 1889: \"Walling E A, atty at law, o 714 State, h 407 Chestnut\"; and he had $2000 of property in Ward 4 that year. His listing is the same in 1890 thru 1893; and in 1891 he's assessed $1700 in Ward 4. By 1894 he's on the executive committee of the Erie Bar Association, and in 1894 and 1895 he's \"Walling E A, of Lamb and Walling, h 407 Chestnut\", and in 1896 it adds that they're in rooms 6, 7, and 8 of the Penn Bldg. In 1895 E A Walling of Ward 4 had $3,300 property, so he was quite affluent by that time. In 1897 the Hon Emory A Walling is an Erie County Judge, at 552 W. 8th now. Wm B Walling, student, boarder, is also listed. Ditto 1898, and Marshall, Marietta, Miss, dept. register and recorder, is boarding there too (this is Aunt Ettie). There are also two servants. And in 1898 he was assessed $7,725 (still in Ward 4). By 1901, he was up to $8,023, and Ralph G., student, is boarding with him, too. In 1902/03, he's listed as President Judge of Erie Co. Court House, still on W. 8th. Ditto next year. In 1904, he was assessed $8023. In 1906/07 it also lists his office as on the 2nd floor of the courthouse, and he's got Mutual Phone. In 1907, on 8th near Cherry, he was assessed $7,831. By 1907/08 he seems also to have Bell phone. The next year his office is at 8 Court House where he's got Bell, and at home he's got Mutual. In 1909/10 he's \"Presiding Judge Erie Co. Courts, 552 W 8th, Mutual\". In the same year there's an Orpha Soper, domestic, listed there; also, he's listed as a member of the executive committee of the Erie County Bar Association. Next 2 years his address and title are the same; and in 1911 his property assessment was $8,345. I didn't do as thorought a search of the later directories, but in 1921/22 he's \"Walling, Emory A, Hon\" - that's in big letters - \"Justice of the Supreme Court of Pa 552 W 8th Mutual Phone\". The info sent me by the Pa. Senate Library differs in a couple of particluars from the above, notably that he served there \"1885, 1888\", implying that it was two separate terms (The 1947-1948 Pennsylvania Manual). Also, he \"was district attorney of Erie County for three years, commencing January, 1882; elected to the Senate, 1884.\" (Smull's Legislative Handbook, 1888.) Jane Moorhead Luschwitz sent me a typewritten version of what's apparently an article from the North East Breeze, 7/28/1966, which describes how a \"testimonial\" (diploma?) granted by Lake Shore Seminary to Emory A. in 1875 was given by Aunt Laura to the museum in North East. Probably it was written by Ralph Hartley who was a historian of sorts in North East and who wrote Aunt Laura a letter on the subject 7/22/1966 (e-mailed me by Scott Coyle 2/4/09), in which he indicates the diploma was displayed in the front window of the National Bank on W. Main St. in North East for a couple weeks; and he had a couple of photostats made. Karen Michaelis finally tracked it down in the hands of Dick Tefft of the NE Historical Society and it can now be found on my website. \"He started life in Greenfield Township\", says the 7/28/1966 article. \"Never attended school until age 12, when a visiting school teacher inspired him to get an education.\" The 1860 census, though, lists him as being in school, at age 7. Maybe he stopped out for a while. \"His father died when Emory was nine leaving the mother with five small children and many difficulties. \"After grade school in a typical old-time, one-room affair, Emory enrolled at Lake Shore Seminary where he was janitor to pay his expenses. After graduation he attended Edinboro Normal, then studied law with a prominent Erie lawyer and was admitted to the bar in 1878. \"He became District Attorney for Erie County at age 42, defeating the prominent Democratic attorney who had taught him law.\" This appears to be a mistake. He was 42 in 1896, but that was the year he was elected President Judge; he was elected DA in 1881. His teacher William Benson was in fact in a messy election but that was in 1876 against Wiliam Galbraith. \"After 20 years on the county bench, he was elected to the State Supreme Court where he served 15 years to his death in 1931. He was in line to be Chief Justice and would not retire even at age 77. \"Allegheny College awarded him an honorary LLD in 1920; He was married to a North East girl, Grace Marshall and had his summer home at 'Eastwood' in West Sidehill Road for 42 years. \"Five of the six children born in the log cabin lived to old age.\" They must be talking about Thomas Walling's second family. \"Their descendants are numerous and prosperous in today's world.... \"As for the diploma or testimonial it shows Emory was enrolled in a scientific course. Somehow he decided in favor of the law. \"Lake Shore Seminary had both a principal and a preceptress. Penmanship and music and drawing were featured so that cultural attainments were available, in addition to more down to earth subjects like history, commerce, higher English, mathematics and geography.\" Eric More Marshall sent me an article, from an old scrapbook kept by his mother Jessie Pettit Marshall, written apparently some months before he was inaugurated to the Supreme Court. It's full of praise, but does contain some real information. \"The bar of Erie county has endorsed Judge Emory A. Walling as successor to Chief Justice Fell\" - though this contradicts what it says below. He \"has been mentioned for the Supreme court several times before this.... He has held court in almost every county of Western Pennsylvania... He has been among the foremost of those who have labored to save boys and girls from the disastrous effects of evil associations. He was the prime mover in the establishment of Elmwood Home, and its companion institution, the Elmwood Home for Girls.... Judge Walling is in the prime of life. Should he win the election next spring he would be placed in a position to give the state of Pennsylvania the most disinterested and efficient service in its highest tribunal of justice.\" That's the only mention I've seen about an election for this office. Also from Eric's scrapbook is another article about Judge Walling's appointment to the state supreme court. \"Rossiter Becomes President Judge--Two Inaugurations Here January 3\" is the headline. \"Judge Emory A. Walling, for nineteen years presiding judge of the common pleas court of Erie county, will be sworn in as a member of the state supreme court January 3, 1916, at Philadelphia. He was appointed yesterday morning by Governor Martin G. Brumbaugh to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Justice John P. Elkin, Justice Elkin's term expires December 31, 1916. \"The announcement was also made yesterday morning that Captain Edward Lyman Whittelsay had been appointed law judge of Erie county. Judge Uriah P. Rossiter is automatically promoted to the position of presiding judge. \"In view of the fact that Judge Walling's appointment is but for one year it is quite likely that he will run for office next year. If he is elected by the people he will serve a twenty-one year term.\" This article includes a picture of him. Also from Eric's scrapbook is an undated, unattributed article, apparently from the Erie Daily Times, titled \"Walling Supreme Court Judge\". It's full of praise - he's \"one of the most distinguished common pleas jurists in this commonwealth\" and an \"ideal Christian citizen.... Governor Brumbaugh remarked that he was looking for the very best equipped man in Pennsylvania for the position, that there was no politics in it, although the man selected would have to be one whose fidelity to the Republican party had never been questioned.... In his nineteen years of continuous service he has been reversed only ten times and during the past five years he has not been reversed at all. For fifteen of the nineteen years he was the only judge we had in this county. \"He is one of the best known as well as one of the most popular jurists in the state and no citizen in any of the walks of life in the entire commonwealth possesses higher ideals than does he. The judge is a brilliant and rapid thinker and an eloquent speaker, always helpful and always practical.... he was not a candidate for such a great honor.\" I guess that means the governor approached him and not the other way around. It goes on to call him Erie's \"leading citizen. Judge Walling is the best known and by far the best liked man in this county.\" Another unattributed newspaper article from the same scrapbook is titled, \"Sketch of Hon. Emory A. Walling\". It reads: \"Judge Walling was born and raised on a farm in Greenfield Township, Erie County, PA. He has one brother and three sisters. \"When his brother was thirteen and he was eight years of age their father died. The mother and children remained on the farm and managed it as best they could. As the boys grew older, they also did work in the woods, peeling bark, cutting wood, making maple sugar, etc. And the judge worked with a threshing machine two seasons. \"The opportunity for schooling was limited, but he obtained a good common school education and after being away at school one term, taught district schoool. Then attended the State Normal School at Edinboro and later the Lake Shore Seminary at North East Pa., where he paid his expenses by his own work. After graduating from the last named institution, he taught school one term, then studied law and was admitted to the Erie Bar in 1878. \"For a time he had his office at North East, and while there married Miss Grace Marshall, a school teacher and the daughter of a North East Township farmer. They have five children. \"He was elected District Attorney of Erie County in 1881, and since that time has resided in Erie, but usually spends the summers on his farm at North East, where he is engaged in fruit growing and general farming. \"He was elected State Senator in 1884, serving one term, but continued the practice of law until elected judge of Erie County in 1896. He took such high rank at the Bar that durin those years, from 1884 to 1896, he was engaged in the trial of a large percentage of the important cases brought before the Erie County Courts, and also practiced in other counties and before the State Supreme Court and the Federal Courts. He was re-elected Judge of Erie County in 1906 by the unanimous vote of the Republican, Democratic and Lincoln Republican parties. \"As District Attorney, he tried his cases with marked ability and fairness, and with as little expense as practicable to the county. \"As State Senator, although at one time the youngest member, he was noted for ability, industry, and the conscientious discharge of duty. \"As Judge, his work has been highly satisfactory to the profession and the public. The cases before him have been tried with such care and accuracy as to seldom require a retrial or an appeal, and when appealed, the decisions have usually been affirmed.\" Another article from Eric's collection, titled simply \"Judge Emory A. Walling\", is full of effusive praise but not too long on information. One thing it does say is, \"He would enter just as heartily into umpiring a baseball game for the benefit of the Boys' club as he would preside over the most important and dignified gathering that could be conceived.\" Another such article from Eric's scrapbook describes a reception for Judge Walling a few days before he was elevated to the Supreme Court. \"People of all classes were present\", including quite a few local luminaries. \"Despite the weather hundreds of men and women were present.\" Some of them \"had stood before him in the quarter sessions courts of Erie county and had heard from his lips sentences pronounced upon them. But they too joined in congratulating him upon his advancement.\" It sounds like Judge Waloing was vacating two positions: \"Judge Rossiter will begin his ten years' term on the bench of Erie county, succeeding Judge Walling as president judge and Captain E. L. Whittlesley will take the oath of office as a judge of the Erie county courts...\" Anyway, both of these successors were at the reception. \"In the receiving line with Judge and Mrs. Walling were Harry L. Moore, president of the Erie county bar association, State Senator Henry A. Clark and former Congressman Milton W. Shreve.\" Also present were Hugh C. Lord, president of the Board of Commerce; Guy T. Justis, secretary of the Social Service Federation; Matthew Griswold (!) of the board of education; Leonard Pasqualicchio, court interpreter, representing the Italian community; Attorney Frank McClintock of Union City; \"Squire\" L. T. Becker of North East; and Dr. Spaulding of Albion. There is a picture of Judge Walling in Eric's collection of newspaper clippings which says \"Honor Guest\" above, and in the caption below it says, \"EMORY A. WALLING, justice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, formerly president judge of Erie county courts, was an honor guest Saturday night at the annual banquet of the Erie County Bar association.\" From the Wattsburg Sentinel, Thursday, Nov. 10, 1892: \"On Friday night of last week, Hon. E. A. Walling made one of the finest speeches we have ever listened to on the issues of the campaign from the Republican stand point. If his argument had contained nothing more than his eulogism of Abraham Lincoln and the honor paid to the boys in blue for their service to their country and homes, everyone who lived in the troublous times of '61 to '64, with hearts that beat with patriotism, must have honored the man and many who were present said, 'I have known him from boyhood up, and if you had you would have known he would be a great man some day.' The only draw back was to have a place for him to speacd. (sic) 'Tis true the people from this end of the state has (sic) always felt as though the Senate chamber at Harrisburg was honored when Erie county's distinguished son, E. A. Walling was a member of the Senate. The carpets of finest Brussels, and seats of upholstered plush, and desks of polished walnut, never rebelled on account of his presence, not even the carving around the speakers desk or the rare pictures of Pennsylvania's greatness objected to him, nor do we know that the clapboards, or seats, or railing around the alter (sic) or little cabinet organ, or even the steeple of the sacred edifice in Lowville objected to Mr. Walling talking upon the great issues of the day. Only the keyholder to the entrance to the only building convenient for a gathering, where such vital interests were at stake, said No Sir! Such sacrilege will never be allowed. But thanks to the Knights of Honor, or at least a part of them, a suitable place was obtained in their hall in the school building....\" Wattsburg and Lowville are just south of Greenfield, which is just south of North East. There's an article from the Erie Daily Times, 1/1/1908, where it says that at 11 AM that day members of the Erie County Bar Assoc. called upon the venerable former Judge Vincent and exchanged their best New Year's greetings, then \"called upon Judge E. A. Walling afterwards and shook hands with the honored and esteemed incumbent of the high office of president judge. \"Judge Walling had a hearty hand-shake and a kindly word of good will and fellowship for each one.\" There's a picture of a youngish Judge Walling there too, which might be worth scanning from the original article someday since I don't believe we have it from any other source. Columnist Jay James in the Erie paper: \"Justice Emory A. Walling had a most remarkable memory for names and faces. He developed this during his many years of presiding in the local courts.

Age at death: 85 years, 10 months, 7 days. Mother: LAURA CORDELIA EDGERTON (533) (1836-1921) Father: ROBERT WILLIAM MARSHALL (041) (1838-1899) Spouse: EMORY ANDREW SCOTT WALLING (028) (1854-1931) Wedding: 4/22/1880 Child 1: WILLIAM BENSON WALLING (031) (1881-1966) Child 2: RALPH GORDON WALLING (083) (1885-1965) Child 3: LAURA CORDELIA WALLING (032) (1890-1972) Child 4: MARION ELIZABETH WALLING (082) (1896-1979) Child 5: MARIETTA MARSHALL WALLING (011) (1897-1962) Note: Her death certificate and the Edgerton Bible both agree on Note: the birthdate. Saw the train carrying Lincoln's body when it came through Erie. They held her up above the crowd so she could see it. She is said to have had a memory like an elephant, just like her husband. She grew up on a farm in Northeast Twp., not far from the one her husband grew up on. The farm was later owned by her nephew Roger Marshall and his wife Adelaide. From my mother, 9/1/12: \"Mom\" - Marietta Marshall Walling - \"remembered as a little girl being told to run to the livery stable to ask them to saddle up the horses because her mother\" - Grace Ellen Masrshall - \"wanted to go shopping. They were living at 552 when this happened.\" She actually had six kids, not five. There was also a daughter who didn't live - stillborn, says Mom - and was buried in the backyard without being named. This was the scene of great consternation later when they had to move into the big house. She may have been in the gap in the birth order between Uncle Ralph and Aunt Laura, or between Aunt Laura and Aunt Marion. My mom says (9/1/12): \"Uncle Will was born first, then Uncle Ralph, then Aunt Laura, then there is a gap in dates, then Aunt Marion, then Marietta (mom), the last child. Presumably the gap in dates accounts for the stillborn daughter.\" Now, from the Erie City Directories, they seem to have built the big house at 552 W. 8th about 1896. My grandmother Marietta, who was born in 1897, on the other hand, remembered the earlier house rather dimly, according to Aunt Lulu, which implies they may have moved away from it about 1899. In any case, the earlier address was 407 Chestnut, at the northwest corner of 10th and Chestnut, where they first appear in 1883. Here's Mom's recollection of where it was: \"At that time she and Grandpa Walling were living in Erie in Erie in the neighborhood near Fourth Street, though I don't know know whether the house actually was on Fourth or on a cross street - maybe Myrtle, Chestnut or Walnut. Anyway, it was a few blocks nearer to the lake than 552 W. Eighth.\" Now, in the death register for the Erie city directory, 1883/84, I find an Etta Elviron Wallin who died of pneumonia at 1 year 7 months on 6/3/1882. That means she would have been born about December 1880. There was only one Walling family in Erie then, and the Etta makes it very possible that she was named after Aunt Ettie like Grandma was. Now, the Erie Cemetery has a child who died 6/3/1882 at 19 months; but the name is Ebba E. Wallin, not Etta; and she's buried in a lone grave, not on a family plot. Another problem: Uncle Will's birthdate was 2/12/1881, only about 3 months later. The Erie library has no obituary for her. I've checked all the death registers up thru March 1898, and there are no other likely-looking candidates. Whoever has the Walling Bible could probably clear this up. Another approach would be to go to 407 Chestnut St. and see if her grave is still there. Grandma Walling was a teetotaler, in contrast to the alcoholism elsewhere in her family. In those days you either drank too much or you didn't drink at all. One of Eric Marshall's friends on the Grahamville Cemetery board went to a party at the Walling house once. \"The girls were all pretty\", he says. (E-mail, 11/27/2000.) Grace E. is 1 year old in the 1860 census, and 10 in 1870. She was bedridden for 8 or 10 years after she broke her hip. Mom says she could be difficult. She always enjoyed visits from Grandpa (he was an easy guy to like) but sometimes Grandma (her daughter) would come and visit her and she wouldn't even remember it. Her death certificate says she died of apoplexy (stroke). She was buried two days later in Erie Cemetery. ID: 031 Name: WILLIAM BENSON WALLING Sex: M Birth date: Feb. 12, 1881 Birth place: North East, Pa. Date of death: June 11, 1966 Place of death: Erie, Pa. Age at death: 85 years, 3 months, 30 days. Mother: GRACE ELLEN MARSHALL (029) (1859-1945) Father: EMORY ANDREW SCOTT WALLING (028) (1854-1931) Spouse: ANNA MARIE BOSTWICK (042) (1881-1960) Wedding: 11/30/1909 Child 1: HENRIETTA GRACE WALLING (550) (1910-1992) Child 2: ELLEN ELIZABETH WALLING (551) (1912-1985) Child 3: JEAN KIRKPATRICK WALLING (552) (1918-1987) Note: Uncle Will. One of the first students to graduate from Stanford, in 1903. He wanted to be an English professor - he would go around the halls at school quoting Shakespeare - but his father talked him into being a lawyer, so I'm told by Kathy Moorhead. He may have gone out to California because of his health - he was always kind of sickly and skinny. He takes some ribbing about it in the Stanford yearbooks. 1902: \"And a great big fat man said : 'Oh golly ! For heaven's sake, just look at Wally !'\" And this limerick appears in 1904: There is a young fellow named Walling Whose thinness is fairly apalling ; His angles, alas ! Cut his friends as they pass , A circumstance really most galling ! The other Wallings of that generation had that angular-elbowed appearance, too. He was admitted to the bar 10/28/1907 (from \"History of Erie County\", by Reed, at Sutro). \"He was a Gridley Volunteer serving in World War I.... His hobbies included the study of and speaking engagements about the derivations of Anglo-Saxon surnames.\" From Memoirs of the Erie Count Bench and Bar, vol. 2, 2000, from the Erie County Bar Foundation. He had a memory like his parents'. Was a law librarian, but he didn't keep a card catalog, he kept it all in his head, according to a newspaper article we have. Aunt Lulu says that after his eyes went bad (serious myopia, which probably could be corrected today) his father got him a job at the law library. Seems like a strange job for someone with bad eyes, but he knew what was in the law books so well he could just rely on his memory. I knew him when I was a kid and he was a little old man with a cane. He was a likeable old guy. The article, apparently from the Erie Daily Times: \"Members of the Erie County Bar Association are proud of their new library in the county courthouse--one of the most extensive collections of legal tomes in the country. \"They are also very glad to have available as librarian William Benson Walling, son of the late Judge Emory A. Walling. \"Always Ready to Help \"The law librarian, better known as 'Will', is as modest and self-effacing as they come, but he has legal knowledge surpassed by none of his association brothers, and he's always ready and willing to furnish help to practically anyone who seeks it. \"Will's legal library now contains about 13,500 volumes, valued at around $50,000, and and he not only can locate any of the tomes at a minute's notice, but he can tell you what's in them. He does all this without the aid of an index of any sort. All Will needs is the index he carries in his head. \"Younger attorneys find Will especially helpful. \"'Will', they may ask, 'where can I find something in a hurry on the protection of domestic water supplies in the state?' \"Digs Out Information \"Will will probably dig out the Laws of Pennsylvania, Volume Two, 1937, where the required information can be found. \"The library contains many rare volumes, oldest of which is the Report of Cases in Pennsylvania Courts, printed in Philadelphia back in 1806.... \"Will not only makes himself valuable to many a lawyer who needs some facts to iron out a case, but he'll go out of his way to aid the general public. He recently spent most of the afternoon digging through an encyclopedia to get the detailed information on the history of American railroads for a gentleman preparing a magazine article. \"Will is the son of the late judge Emory A. Walling, who died Dec. 30, 1931, while serving his 16th year on the bench of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. \"Will was born in North East on Feb. 12, 1881, and was graduated from old Erie High School in 1899 and from Stanford University in 1903. He entered the law office of T. A. Lamb after leaving college and, in 1907, was admitted to practice in Erie County courts. Faulty vision subsequently moved Will to give up active legal practice, and on Jan. 1, 1931, he was appointed librarian...\" The \"History of Erie County\", 1925, says he graduated from Erie High School in 1899, then went to Stanford and graduated in 1903. \"He then read law in the office of T. A. Lamb, Erie, and was admitted to the bar in 1907.... \"In 1909 Mr. Walling was married to Miss Anna M. Bostwick, of Erie, the daughter of Charles F. and Henrietta (Riblet) Bostwick. The Riblets were one of the pioneer families of Erie County, having settled here in 1806.\" Their kids Henrietta and Ellen went to Gridley High School, and Jean Kirkpatrick was in kindergarten. \"Mr. Walling is a Republican, a member of the University Club and belongs to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He is secretary of the Optimist club and belongs to the Chamber of Commerce.\" Cousin Barbara Brookes-Harris of Los Gatos, CA has a letter Uncle Will wrote to his Aunt Cora Marshall Greenman and Uncle Will (James Wlliam) Greenman on their 64th anniversary. (We have a picture of this event). It's typewritten on Erie County Law Library stationary, dated Feb. 20, 1946. It starts out with an excerpt from an old newspaper: \"ITEM FROM THE NORTH EAST SUN of February 25, 1882. \"Mr. and Mrs. Robert William Marshall of the Findley's Lake Road announced the marriage of their daughter, Cora Edgerton, to Mr. James William Greenman, the son of Mrs. Clarissa More Greenman of Greenman Hill. The ceremony was performed at the home of the bride on Wednesday, February 22, at 8 o'clock, with the pastor of the Little Hope Baptist Church officiating. The bride has been employed as a teacher at the Frog Pond School, and Mr. Greenman is an orchestra leader, having but recently returned from a nation-wide tour with the Greenman Melody Boys. The young couple will be at home in their new house at Grahamville after March the first. - - - - - - - - - - - - - \"Mr. and Mrs. James W. Greenman \"11124 South Hoyne Avenue \"Chicago, Illinois \"Dear Aunt Cora and Uncle Will: \"If this notice or a similar one did not appear in the North East paper of sixty-four years ago it must have been the fault of your publicity agent. It is a far cry from 1882 and the Findley's Lake Road to 1946 and South Hoyne Avenue, and equally far from the little red schoolhouse at Bird's Corners to the swank Morgan Park Military Academy, but you both have bravely bridged the gap and have been happy and successful at both ends of the line. And so from all of us here go congratulations and felicitations to all of you there -- a 64th wedding anniversary is a momentous and rare occasion, especially so when it finds both principals in such good health and spirits. \"I very much appreciated your letter which arrived on my birthday anniversary. The number 65 reminds me that much more of my life is in the past than in the future and that, in truth, I am hitting the Sunset Trail, as they used to say in the old West. Personally I am very well satisfied to have lived the greater part of my life at the time in which I have, as I believe the last fifty years a far more desirable period than the next fifty will be -- it seems to me there are stormy seas ahead. I was very much interested in what you wrote about the million dollar baby arriving on time. I still persist in being on time and that is one of the few virtues I can claim for myself. I understand that I arrived on a Saturday at the propitious hour of high noon, and that the merry hand of the dial was on the very point of twelve as I made my advent in this vale of tears and sadness. All the information I have ever received on the subject indicates that I was an exceptionally cross baby, but I am sure that the amiableness of my later years has more than made amends. Anna and the rest of our household join me in wishing for you the most enjoyable of anniversary celebrations. \"Sincerely, \"Wm. B. Walling Uncle Will is listed in 4 of the early Palo Alto directories. In the 1899-1900 Stanford University and Palo Alto Directory, under New Students, is: \"Walling, William Benson, Encina 76\". Encina is a hall near Hoover Tower. In the Palo Alto City Directory for 1900/1901, is \"Walling, W B, student, 405 Emerson st\". 405 Emerson is a parking lot now. In the Palo Alto City Directory for 1901/1902, it's \"Walling, W B, student, 405 Emerson street\". In the Directory of Palo Alto and Stanford University, Jan. 1903, in the On Campus section, is \"Walling, W. B., student, 4 Salvatierra St.\" That's in the residential south part of the campus. The Stanford student directories mostly corroborate the above. They say he majored in English. The 1st semester 1899/1900 dir says he lived at 56 Encina. 405 Emerson was the Kappa Sigma fraternity house. By Oct. 1902 he was at 132 Encina. In Feb. 1903 he's back at Kappa Sigma, but it's at 12A Lasuen now; and he seems to be behind in his progress toward his degree by 7 hours. By Oct. 1903 he's not listed. The 1901 Stanford yearbook lists him as the only member of the class of '03 in Kappa Sigma. There were only about 10 people there total, maybe the chapter was just getting started. He's alwas an English major in the yearbooks, no mention of the law. In 1904 he's a graduate with his degree in English. There are pictures of him in 1902 and 1904, and two in 1903. Uncle Will is nonetheless listed in the Erie City Directory for 1897 and for 1902/03, 03/04, & 05/06 as a student boarding at his father's house. In 1907 he was taxed $705, listed at 5th near Parade, ward 1. Maybe that's where he worked, since in 1907/08 he's still boarding with his parents, a law student in the office of T. A. Lamb. In 1909/10 he's an \"attorney-at-law, 9-11 Wayne Blk 725 State, Mutual, bds 552 W 8th\". Ditto 1910/11 except now he boards at 431 W 11th. 1911/12: \"Walling Wm B (Anna B), lawyer, 708 State, Mutual phone, bds 431 W 11th, Mutual\". The T. A. Lamb he studied law with must be the one who was his father's law partner. And Uncle Will must be named after William Benson whith whom his father studied law, though neither of these things is mentioned in Judge Walling's book. His death certificate confirms the death date and says his mailing address was 1214 W. 10th in Erie, his SSN was 188-36-3125 (and ancestry.com's SSDI confirms the birthdate, as does his granddaughter Jane Luschwitz), he died of heart disease with Chronic Brain Syndrome as a contributory factor, and the arragements were done by the Burton Funeral Home. The informant was Mrs. Cyrus Moorhead of 6722 Buffalo Rd., Harborcreek, which is the address where he died. His obit says he was survived by three daughters, Mrs. Cyrus W. Moorhead, Ellen Walling, and Mrs. Lindley R. McClelland. Lindley McClelland was a conservative judge in Erie whose name I heard on TV once when I was there at age 14. Uncle Will lived at 1214 W. 10th when he died. Uncle Will was a good writer as the above letter demonstrates. He wrote a poem for me when I was born, which Mom pulled out and showed me on my twenty-fifth birthday, though it seems to have been misplaced in the intervening years. Now Mom doesn't even remember it. Jane Luschwitz sent me three poems he wrote, full of imagery about fall and winter: September In fair September's pleasant days, With ripened fruit and golden maize, The flowers now reach their highest peak, And grow more brilliant week by week. The purple grapes on leafy vine Perfume the bracing air like wine, As lake-borne breezes sweep ahead, And over all their freshness spread. The fruit of which the poets sang Must be the apple with its tang, Of all aromas known, this wins, The smell of apples stored in bins. The trees are laden to the top, With peaches as their luscious crop, While squash and pumpkins, plums and pears, Take prizes at the County Fairs. The horn of plenty overflows, As nature's finest hand she shows, With ripened fruit and golden maize, In fair September's mellow days. November In cool November's dull gray light, With fallen leaves and birds in flight, Neath bluish haze and hazel shade, The drowsing landscape is displayed. Like an inverted bowl of gray, Low hanging clouds obscure the day, And filter through a mellow glow, That softens all the world below. In lessened song and sober tone, (The brilliant songbirds all have flown), The winter birds sound muted note, As through the leafless trees they float. When southern winds and warmer days, Bring Indian Summer's deeper haze, Then standing still seem earth and sky, As if afraid to live or die. Late autumn brings its brooding spells, And every year the tale retells, With fallen leaves and birds in flight, In cool November's dull gray light. Winter Woodland The winter woodland seems austere, Yet magic beauty lingers here; This photograph with rare success Has reproduced this loveliness. The sun through mingled tree-tops sifts Its light on alabaster drifts And lacy shadows etched in gray Set fresh designs each sunlit day. While winter birds here softly sing, As through the frosted air they wing, The summer birds majestic paeans Float o'er the farthest Caribbeans. The northwest wind sweeps to a gale And stormy petrels lose the trail, Then clouds and snow and tossing trees In one cold gray all seem to freeze. The sunset colors tinge the snow With gold and blue in mingled glow, And when the night on day intrudes Then come those purple solitudes. He also wrote the following poem, entitled \"The Lake\", which must be about Lake Eire, sent me by Scott Coyle in an e-mail dated 2/8/2009. Esther Lennertz and Harriet Sawdey found it in a box with a treasure trove of pictures, documents, letters, etc. No line can trace, no verses show The beauty of her sunset glow, As cheerful days to night unfold, Mid bright patines of shim'ring gold. Her summer hues of tender blue That gently beckon me and you, In autumn storms become deep gray, As leaden skies hold back the day. Then surging billows pound the sand, And crush the work of man's frail hand. In wintry cold her spray will freeze On rocks and piles and poplar trees, And iridescent suns will glow In winter's jewels of icy snow. A lake that answers human needs As hungry, thirsty man she feeds, A lake upon whose bosom floats A mighty caravan of boats, A freighter of ten thousand tons, A birch canoe that swiftly runs. Across whose white-capped waters ply Huge coal boats with a year's supply, Whose sylphlike yachts and snow-white sails Dip low before September's gales. A lake whose rippling waters flow Round jutting point and crescent bow, And, uncomplaining, sweeps away The refuse of each human day. I've sailed the lake, swam o'er its bars, And from its beaches watched the stars. In boyhood days it seemed a friend, And more so now at life's far end. If anyone knows about any more of his writings, please let me know. Kathy Moorhead says some of his poems and artwork were published when he was at Stanford, maybe in the Stanford Quarterly publication, but I couldn't find anything when I went down to the Stanford library. She thinks Jane Luschwitz may have them. ID: 032 Name: LAURA CORDELIA WALLING Sex: F Birth date: Dec. 11, 1890 Birth place: Erie, Pa. Date of death: Mar. 29, 1972 Place of death: Erie, Pa.

Was a photography nut. Lived around the corner from my grandparents (the L. S. Moshers) at 943 W. 9th Street in Erie when I was a kid. In Eric More Marshall's grandmother's scrapbook are three newspaper clippings with pix of Aunt Laura, all concerning the Girl Scouts. The caption of one says she was a commissioner of the Erie Girl Scouts. Another says she was going to represent the Erie Girl Scouts at the national Girl Scouts convention in Milwaukee, Oct. 11-13 (what year?). Aunt Laura's daughter Anne Elizabeth Sawdey Coyle wrote a short book called \"A Family on Cherry Street\" about growing up in Erie. Their house was two doors down from Grandma's on Cherry then. Her basement \"contained a washing machine and a washboard\". I remember a washboard in Grandma's basement, too. \"Because there were no electric clothes dryers back then, the wet clothes hung in the cellar drying with the heat of the furnace in winter, and in the backyard drying with the heat of the sun in summer.\" They used those old springless clothespins then. \"The kitchen in our house was Mother's domain. To say that mother was a good cook is putting it mildly. She was an excellent coook!\" Even today her cookbook is still passed around in her family. I remember when we went to Erie, she came over to visit, and when she was leaving, she asked Rog, who was about 9 then, what his favorite food was. He said turkey. When we went over to her house for dinner, she had cooked him a turkey. \"Mother always had help with the housework. (Maids were paid five dollars a week with Sunday and Thursday afternoon off.) Our family always went out for dinner on Thursdays because there was no maid to help in the kitchen. Can you imagine that with four daughters there was no one to do the work! \"Anyway we always looked forward to these meals out. We all got dressed up and met Dad downtown where there were numerous good restaurants. I can still remember being allowed to order ice tea when we ate at the restaurant. At home it was milk, milk, milk to fatten us up.\" Everybody on that side of the family is skinny. \"Of course, we never drank pop. It just wasn't available the way it is now. \"Mother, with Dad's help, or the other way around, made grape juice, root beer, and birch beer. I remember when one of Jane's friends was in our kitchen (this huge room was always a great gathering place). Before this friend opened his bottle of home made grape juice, he shook the bottle. When he took the cap off, the grape juice splattered all over the ceiling. We lived with a purple ceiling until spring when the painters returned it to its original color.\" In the spring they would clean the whole house. Everybody would pitch in, and it would take a day to clean one room. \"A room was emptied down to its bare walls\". \"At our house breakfast and lunch were eaten in the kitchen. Dinner, supper as we called it, was eaten in the dining room. All meals were eaten on the screened back porch when it was warm enough. Meal times were family times. No matter where we were, we came when we were called. If we were outside, Mother would whistle and we would come running. Even if we did not hear the whistle, some friend or friends of Mothers would say 'Your mother wants you.' Everyone knew the whistle. My mother was very much the lady but her loud, distinctive whistle was known all over the neighborhood.\" \"Mother went to the now Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts.\" She spent a couple of years there. \"In those days it was a finishing school. Young ladies were taught to be proper young ladies. There was no future of a career for most girls.... They were stay-at-home mothers. Two car families were almost unheard of. Fathers drove to work; mothers stayed at home and let the world come to them.\" And the world did come to them. It was a very neighborhood-oriented society then. \"Milk in glass quart bottles was delivered to your back door between five and six in the morning. Fresh fruits and vegetables were sold by Susie from her push cart which she pushed around the neighborhood daily. \"The ice man made his rounds every other day. A large card with the numerals 25, 50, 75, and 100 in the corners of it was put in the front window so the ice man would know what size chunck of ice to put in your ice box. Nobody had to be home when he came. Doors were not locked. The ice man walked in your back door, deposited the ice, and left. On a hot day it was a big treat for us when we would go to Harvey's ice truck where he would chip off generous hunks of ice for all of us. Not the white ice that is made by today's refrigerators. This ice was so clear that you could see through it. In winter Presque Isle bay would freeze over. Ice companies would saw the ice and store it in the ice house until it was needed for deliveries.\" They would go down to the corner store for meat and stuff like that. No supermarkets then. \"We even had a rag man who came around the neighborhood. He was Charlie, a little man almost as old and run down looking as his push cart. Mother would hear his 'rags, rags, any old rags' which would sound like 'regs, regs, eneoregs.' Mother would send one of us to the rag bag to get something to give to Charlie.... \"Mail was delivered to our house twice a day. And just a two cent stamp was needed for each letter! Christmas mail was delivered at least four times a day including Sundays.\" \"Mother had many hobbies. She loved to garden and was such a successful gardener. Her rose garden was a delight to see!\" Grandpa grew roses out in the backyard, too. \"I remember pansies as being her favorites. Every morning the pansy vases throughout our house were refilled with fresh pansies. \"When her daughters were older, Mother became relly involved with photography. She not only took pictures, but also developed, printed, and enlarged them. How proud we all were of her when a photograph she had taken won a prize in a contest!\" She took really good pictures, close-ups of birds in flight and things like that. She knew her husband way back in elementary school. \"It was at Central High School that they became a pair. According to Dad's diary, most of the days he 'walked Laura home from school.'\" Aunt Laura is in some of the early Erie City Directories. In 1906/07 she's listed as a student boarding at her parents' house. Ditto 1908/09, 1909/10, 1910/11, 1911/12. Scott: Aunt Laura lived at \"941 W. 9th St. Laura and her family resided in the upper flat at 943 W. 9th St. beginning in the mid 1930s. Laura moved to the downstairs flat at 941 W. 9th St. in the early 1950s. After Laura died in 1972, Denny & Becky Coyle Himrod purchased the house and resided there until selling it in 1978.\" Her last residence was in Erie, zip code 16502. Her obit from the Erie Daily Times says she was a Methodist, and she was survived by four daughters: Mrs. Esther Lennertz of Orchard Park, N. Y., Miss Harriet Sawdey of L. A., Mrs. James (Anne) Coyle of Erie, and Mrs. Gerald (Jane) McCarthy of L. A.; a sister, Aunt Marion of Lantana Fla.; ten grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren; and she was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery.
