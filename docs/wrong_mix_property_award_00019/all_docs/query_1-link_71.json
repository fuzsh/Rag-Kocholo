        "text": "Photos of the Month — October 2014\n\nThis month, the Nobel Prize in Physics will be announced October 7th and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the day after. Did you know that there have been five sets of families who have won the Nobel Prize in Physics, either together or separately? We are celebrating the upcoming announcement by highlighting these familial ties. The Curies — Marie and Pierre — won in 1903. Father and son teams include William & Lawrence Bragg (1915); Niels Bohr (1922) & Aage Bohr (1975); Manne Siegbahn (1924) & Kai M. Siegbahn (1981); J. J. Thomson (1906) & George Paget Thomson (1937). Thanks to the photographic donation from William F. Meggers given to the American Institute of Physics in 1958, we’re able to display all of these winners and many more in our online gallery. Every year we add photographs of newly announced winners to our 25,000+ historical image collection. To see them, type the word “Nobel” in the search engine."
