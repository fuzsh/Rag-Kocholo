        "text": "The new Integrated Campus for Engineering and Physical Sciences is the University of Leeds’ largest single investment for over half a century. The complex project involved constructing the new Sir William Henry Bragg Centre for Materials and Imaging – a multidisciplinary research and teaching campus – as well as creating a bridge to link the new building to the adjacent Old Mining Building, which has been entirely rebuilt and extended behind a perfectly preserved Grade II Listed façade.\n\nThe team faced a series of challenges when it came to building on a tightly constrained city centre site, during the Covid-19 pandemic. During in 2020 and 2021, work continued on site at reduced capacity, with BAM implementing a number of safe working protocols in line with the UK government’s social distancing advice.\n\nThe art deco façade of the Old Mining Building was retained and restored, but behind the 1930s exterior BAM constructed an entirely new building with a bridge connecting the upper floors with the new-build research and teaching block.\n\nInside the shell of the old building, new floor layouts and services were needed to make the building fit for purpose in the 21st century. Additional teaching and research spaces were added with the two-storey roof extension.\n\nAcross the new bridge, a brand new five-storey building houses a wide range of high-end research and engineering facilities. BAM used a precast concrete panel frame for the lower levels, with a lightweight steel construction on the upper two levels, to accommodate plant and services.\n\nThe precast panels were delivered flat packed and installed on site by just 25 people. Pouring concrete in-situ – as originally envisaged – would have involved closer to 100 workers. This approach not only also saved up to 12 weeks on the programme, but also reduced costs considerably.\n\nMany of the mechanical and electrical services in the building are visible, so the team ran ‘photo realistic’ workshops with the modelling team and users to make sure that architectural considerations were effectively balanced with practical operational and maintenance requirements.\n\nThe main plant room was built off site in six sections, then craned into place and connected in just three weeks. Carried out using a traditional approach, this work would typically have taken around ten times longer!\n\nThe team created a series of plinths in the basement for key items of specialist equipment; with under-floor services connected to each of them via the plinth and closely managed airflow circulating through the space where they are contained.\n\nSome pieces of equipment are also housed in sealed rooms lined with ‘Mu-metal’, a specialist ferromagnetic alloy used for shielding sensitive electronics."
