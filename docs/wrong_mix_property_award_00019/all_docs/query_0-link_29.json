Here, we show that it grows according to the famous Fibonacci numbers when cis/trans isomerism is neglected. Since the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the Golden section, 1.618, organisms can increase fatty acid variability approximately by that factor per carbon atom invested. Moreover, we show that, under consideration of cis/trans isomerism and/or of modification by hydroxy and/or oxo groups, diversity can be described by generalized Fibonacci numbers (e.g. Pell numbers). For the sake of easy comprehension, we deliberately build the proof on the recursive definitions of these number series. Our results should be of interest for mass spectrometry, combinatorial chemistry, synthetic biology, patent applications, use of fatty acids as biomarkers and the theory of evolution. The recursive definition of Fibonacci numbers paves the way to construct all structural formulas of fatty acids in an automated way.\n\nAn Adventure into Applied Mathematics with Fibonacci Numbers.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJean, Roger V.; Johnson, Marjorie\n\n1989-01-01\n\nDescribes properties of Fibonacci numbers, including the law of recurrence and relationship with the Golden Ratio.

This phenomenon has competing biomathematical explanations, and our core premise is that observation of both Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci structure is informative for challenging such models. We collected data on 657 sunflowers. In our most reliable data subset, we evaluated 768 clockwise or anticlockwise parastichy numbers of which 565 were Fibonacci numbers, and a further 67 had Fibonacci structure of a predefined type. We also found more complex Fibonacci structures not previously reported in sunflowers. This is the third, and largest, study in the literature, although the first with explicit and independently checkable inclusion and analysis criteria and fully accessible data. This study systematically reports for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, seedheads without Fibonacci structure. Some of these are approximately Fibonacci, and we found in particular that parastichy numbers equal to one less than a Fibonacci number were present significantly more often than those one more than a Fibonacci number. An unexpected further result of this study was the existence of quasi-regular heads, in which no parastichy number could be definitively assigned.\n\nNovel Fibonacci and non-Fibonacci structure in the sunflower: results of a citizen science experiment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSwinton, Jonathan; Ochu, Erinma\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis citizen science study evaluates the occurrence of Fibonacci structure in the spirals of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seedheads.

By this natural numbers emerge as Fibonacci 'atoms' and 'molecules' consistent with the notion of Zeckendorf sums. Here, the sub-set of prime numbers appears not as the primary numbers, but as an epistructure from a deeper Fibonacci constitution, and is thus targeted from a 'positive approach'. In the Fibonacci reconstitution of number theory natural numbers show a double geometrical aspect: partly as extension in spacemoreÂ Â» and partly as position in a successive structuring of space. More specifically, the natural numbers are shown to be distributed by a concise 5:3 code structured from the Fibonacci algorithm via Pascal's triangle. The paper discusses possible implications for the more general relation between number theory and geometry, as well as more specifically in relation to hadronic mathematics, initiated by R.M. Santilli, and also briefly to some other recent science linking number theory more directly to geometry and natural systems.Â«Â less\n\nIdentities for Generalized Fibonacci Numbers: A Combinatorial Approach\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPlaza, A.; Falcon, S.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis note shows a combinatorial approach to some identities for generalized Fibonacci numbers.

The focusing properties and the evolution of transverse diffraction pattern for the Fibonacci-like zone plates have been analytically investigated both theoretically and experimentally and compared with the corresponding Fresnel zone plates of the same resolution. The results demonstrate that the Fibonacci-like zone plates possess the self-similar property and the multifocal behavior. Furthermore, the Fibonacci-like zone plate beams are found to possess the self-reconstruction property, and would be promising for 3D optical tweezers, laser machining, and optical imaging.\n\nMagnons in one-dimensional k-component Fibonacci structures\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCosta, C.

S.\n\n2014-05-07\n\nWe have studied the magnon transmission through of one-dimensional magnonic k-component Fibonacci structures, where k different materials are arranged in accordance with the following substitution rule: S{sub n}{sup (k)}=S{sub nâ1}{sup (k)}S{sub nâk}{sup (k)}â(nâ¥k=0,1,2,â¦), where S{sub n}{sup (k)} is the nth stage of the sequence. The calculations were carried out in exchange dominated regime within the framework of the Heisenberg model and taking into account the RPA approximation. We have considered multilayers composed of simple cubic spin-S Heisenberg ferromagnets, and, by using the powerful transfer-matrix method, the spin wave transmission is obtained. It is demonstrated that the transmission coefficient has amoreÂ Â» rich and interesting magnonic pass- and stop-bands structures, which depends on the frequency of magnons and the k values.Â«Â less\n\nAlgebraic independence results for reciprocal sums of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStein, Martin\n\n2011-09-01\n\nLet Fn and Ln denote the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively.

I.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe Golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence are used as proportions in design as symbols of beauty and harmony. That symbolism is a result of the strong connections in their mathematical nature. The Golden section is a number, introduced with Greek letter Ï, which is found by dividing a line into two parts as the longer part divided by the smaller part is equal as the whole length of longer and smaller parts divided by the longer part. Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every number is equal to the two numbers before it. An investigation of application of proportions based on the Golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence in the fashion design and pattern making of ladiesâ clothing is the main aim of the paper. Based on the study it may be concluded that in fashion design and pattern making the Golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence can be used in creation of beautiful and harmonic forms directly or with the help of geometrical figures as: In directly use the Golden and Fibonacci numbers proportions can be in one and the same or different directions. In the application with the help of geometrical shapes the Golden and Fibonacci figures combine proportioning and form creation. The Golden and Fibonacci shapes can be used directly as forms or as frames of forms creation of elements and pieces. Its application can be in different directions and location according the bodice. The Golden section and Fibonacci sequence can combine proportions with other principles of design as symmetry, rhythm, etc.\n\nFibonacci Identities, Matrices, and Graphs\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHuang, Danrun\n\n2005-01-01\n\nGeneral strategies used to help discover, prove, and generalize identities for Fibonacci numbers are described along with some properties about the determinants of square matrices.

Different from periodic structures, the reciprocal lattice and the dynamical properties of Fibonacci lattices depend strongly on the lengths of their lattice parameters, even if the sequence of long and short segment, the Fibonacci string, is the same. In this work we show that by exploiting a self-similarity property of Fibonacci strings under a suitable composition rule, it is possible to define equivalence classes of Fibonacci lattices. We show that the diffraction patterns generated by Fibonacci lattices belonging to the same equivalence class can be rescaled to a common pattern of strong diffraction peaks thus giving to this classification a precise meaning. Furthermore we show that, through the gap labeling theorem, gaps in the energy spectra of Fibonacci crystals belonging to the same class can be labeled by the same momenta (up to a proper rescaling) and that the larger gaps correspond to the strong peaks of the diffraction spectra. This observation makes the definition of equivalence classes meaningful also for the spectral and therefore dynamical and thermodynamical properties of quasicrystals. Our results apply to the more general class of quasiperiodic lattices for which similarity under a suitable deflation rule is in order.\n\nOn the sum of generalized Fibonacci sequence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChong, Chin-Yoon; Ho, C.

The Harper and Fibonacci crystals at fixed frequency are connected by an interpolating one-parameter Hamiltonian. As the parameter is varied, one observes topological phase transitions, i.e., changes in the Chern integers of two bands due to the degeneracy of these bands at some parameter value. For small frequency, corresponding to a semiclassical regime, the degeneracies are shown to occur when the average energy of the two bands is approximately equal to the energy of the classical separatrix. Spectral and topological features of the Fibonacci crystal for small frequency leave a clear imprint on the corresponding Hofstadter butterfly for arbitrary frequency.\n\nFibonacci-Pell Hybridities\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKoshy, Thomas; Gao, Zhenguang\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe develop a recurrence satisfied by the Fibonacci and Pell families.

DNA damage by host-derived reactive oxygen/nitrogen species is hypothesized to be critical for the mutagenic process in Mtb thus, highlighting an important role for DNA repair enzymes in maintenance of genome fidelity. Formamidopyrimidine (Fpg/MutM/Fapy) and EndonucleaseVIII (Nei) constitute the Fpg/Nei family of DNA glycosylases and together with EndonucleaseIII (Nth) are central to the base excision repair pathway in bacteria. In this study we assess the contribution of Nei and Nth DNA repair enzymes in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm), which retains a single nth homologue and duplications of the Fpg (fpg1 and fpg2) and Nei (nei1 and nei2) homologues. Using an Escherichia coli nth deletion mutant, we confirm the functionality of the mycobacterial nth gene in the base excision repair pathway. Msm mutants lacking nei1, nei2 and nth individually or in combination did not display aberrant growth in broth culture. Deletion of nth individually results in increased UV-induced mutagenesis and combinatorial deletion with the nei homologues results in reduced survival under oxidative stress conditions and an increase in spontaneous mutagenesis to rifampicin. Deletion of nth together with the fpg homolgues did not result in any growth/survival defects or changes in mutation rate. Furthermore, no differential emergence of the common rifampicin resistance conferring genotypes were noted. Collectively, these data confirm a role for Nth in base excision repair in mycobacteria and further highlight a novel interplay between the Nth and Nei homologues in spontaneous mutagenesis.

The nth-NND functions, W(n,r) (for n=1,2,3, em leader) in a fluid are obtained hierarchically in terms of the pair correlation function and W(n-1,r) alone. The radial distribution function (RDF) profiles obtained from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid is used to illustrate the results. It is demonstrated that the collective structural information contained in the maxima and minima of the RDF profiles being resolved in terms of individual NND functions may provide more insights about the microscopic neighborhood structure around a reference particle in a fluid. Representative comparison between the results obtained from the formalism and the MD simulation data shows good agreement. Apart from the quantities such as nth-NND functions and nth-nearest-neighbor distances, the average neighbor population number is defined. These quantities are evaluated for the LJ model system and interesting density dependence of the microscopic neighborhood shell structures are discussed in terms of them. The relevance of the NND functions in various phenomena is also pointed out.\n\nnth-nearest-neighbor distribution functions of an interacting fluid from the pair correlation function: A hierarchical approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBhattacharjee, Biplab\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe paper presents a general formalism for the nth-nearest-neighbor distribution (NND) of identical interacting particles in a fluid confined in a Î½-dimensional space.

However, T. cruzi is able to resist oxidative stress suggesting a high efficiency of its DNA repair machinery.The Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway is one of the main DNA repair mechanisms in other eukaryotes and in T. cruzi as well. DNA glycosylases are enzymes involved in the recognition of oxidative DNA damage and in the removal of oxidized bases, constituting the first step of the BER pathway. Here, we describe the presence and activity of TcNTH1, a nuclear T. cruzi DNA glycosylase. Surprisingly, purified recombinant TcNTH1 does not remove the thymine glycol base, but catalyzes the cleavage of a probe showing an AP site. The same activity was found in epimastigote and trypomastigote homogenates suggesting that the BER pathway is not involved in thymine glycol DNA repair. TcNTH1 DNA-binding properties assayed in silico are in agreement with the absence of a thymine glycol removing function of that parasite enzyme. Over expression of TcNTH1 decrease parasite viability when transfected epimastigotes are submitted to a sustained production of H2O2.Therefore, TcNTH1 is the only known NTH1 orthologous unable to eliminate thymine glycol derivatives but that recognizes and cuts an AP site, most probably by a beta-elimination mechanism. We cannot discard that TcNTH1 presents DNA glycosylase activity on other DNA base lesions. Accordingly, a different DNA repair mechanism should be expected leading to eliminate thymine glycol from oxidized parasite DNA. Furthermore, TcNTH1 may play a role in the AP site recognition and processing.

Based on an analysis of the Majorana zero-energy mode, we find the critical p-wave superconducting pairing potential separating a topological phase and a non-topological phase. The topological phase diagram with respect to Fibonacci potentials follow a self-similar fractal structure characterized by the box-counting dimension, which is an example of the interplay of fractal and topology like the Hofstadter's butterfly in quantum Hall insulators.\n\nSurface electromagnetic waves in Fibonacci superlattices: Theoretical and experimental results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl Hassouani, Y.; Aynaou, H.; El Boudouti, E.

R.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nWe study theoretically and experimentally the existence and behavior of the localized surface modes in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic photonic band gap structures. These structures are made of segments and loops arranged according to a Fibonacci sequence. The experiments are carried out by using coaxial cables in the frequency region of a few tens of MHz. We consider 1D periodic structures (superlattice) where each cell is a well-defined Fibonacci generation. In these structures, we generalize a theoretical rule on the surface modes, namely when one considers two semi-infinite superlattices obtained by the cleavage of an infinite superlattice, it exists exactly one surface mode in each gap. This mode is localized on the surface either of one or the other semi-infinite superlattice. We discuss the existence of various types of surface modes and their spatial localization. The experimental observation of these modes is carried out by measuring the transmission through a guide along which a finite superlattice (i.e., constituted of a finite number of quasiperiodic cells) is grafted vertically. The surface modes appear as maxima of the transmission spectrum. These experiments are in good agreement with the theoretical model based on the formalism of the Green function.\n\nInduction of base excision repair enzymes NTH1 and APE1 in rat spleen following aniline exposure\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMa, Huaxian; Wang, Jianling; Abdel-Rahman, Sherif Z.; Boor, Paul J.; Khan, M. Firoze\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMechanisms by which aniline exposure elicits splenotoxicity, especially a tumorigenic response, are not well-understood. Earlier, we have shown that aniline exposure leads to oxidative DNA damage and up-regulation of OGG1 and NEIL1/2 DNA glycosylases in rat spleen. However, the contribution of endonuclease III homolog 1 (NTH1) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in the repair of aniline-induced oxidative DNA damage in the spleen is not known. This study was, therefore, focused on examining whether NTH1 and APE1 contribute to the repair of oxidative DNA lesions in the spleen, in an experimental condition preceding tumorigenesis. To achieve this, male SD rats were subchronically exposed to aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water for 30 days), while controls received drinking water only. By quantitating the cleavage products, the activities of NTH1 and APE1 were assayed using substrates containing thymine glycol (Tg) and tetrahydrofuran, respectively. Aniline treatment led to significant increases in NTH1- and APE1-mediated BER activity in the nuclear extracts of spleen of aniline-treated rats compared to the controls. NTH1 and APE1 mRNA expression in the spleen showed 2.9- and 3.2-fold increases, respectively, in aniline-treated rats compared to controls. Likewise, Western blot analysis showed that protein expression of NTH1 and APE1 in the nuclear extracts of spleen from aniline-treated rats was 1.9- and 2.7-fold higher than controls, respectively. Immunohistochemistry indicated that aniline treatment also led to stronger immunoreactivity for both NTH1 and APE1 in the spleens, confined to the red pulp areas. These results, thus, show that aniline exposure is associated with induction of NTH1 and APE1 in the spleen. The increased repair activity of NTH1 and APE1 could be an important mechanism for the removal of oxidative DNA lesions. These findings thus identify a novel mechanism through which NTH1 and APE1 may regulate the repair of oxidative DNA\n\nInduction of base excision repair enzymes NTH1 and APE1 in rat spleen following aniline exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Huaxian; Wang, Jianling; Abdel-Rahman, Sherif Z; Boor, Paul J; Khan, M Firoze\n\n2013-03-15\n\nMechanisms by which aniline exposure elicits splenotoxicity, especially a tumorigenic response, are not well-understood.

Moreover, it is important to integrate quantum solutions with classical secret sharing schemes with low computational cost for the real world use. This paper proposes a novel hybrid threshold adaptable quantum secret sharing scheme, using an m-bonacci orbital angular momentum (OAM) pump, Lagrange interpolation polynomials, and reverse Huffman-Fibonacci-tree coding. To be exact, we employ entangled states prepared by m-bonacci sequences to detect eavesdropping. Meanwhile, we encode m-bonacci sequences in Lagrange interpolation polynomials to generate the shares of a secret with reverse Huffman-Fibonacci-tree coding. The advantages of the proposed scheme is that it can detect eavesdropping without joint quantum operations, and permits secret sharing for an arbitrary but no less than threshold-value number of classical participants with much lower bandwidth. Also, in comparison with existing quantum secret sharing schemes, it still works when there are dynamic changes, such as the unavailability of some quantum channel, the arrival of new participants and the departure of participants. Finally, we provide security analysis of the new hybrid quantum secret sharing scheme and discuss its useful features for modern applications.\n\nTheoretical scheme of thermal-light many-ghost imaging by Nth-order intensity correlation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiu Yingchuan; College of Mathematics and Physics, University of South China, Hengyang 421001; Kuang Leman\n\n2011-05-15\n\nIn this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme of many-ghost imaging in terms of Nth-order correlated thermal light. We obtain the Gaussian thin lens equations in the many-ghost imaging protocol. We show that it is possible to produce N-1 ghost images of an object at different places in a nonlocal fashion by means of a higher order correlated imaging process with an Nth-order correlated thermal source and correlation measurements. We investigate the visibility of the ghost images in the scheme and obtain the upper bounds of the visibility for the Nth-order correlated thermal-light ghost imaging. It is found that themoreÂ Â» visibility of the ghost images can be dramatically enhanced when the order of correlation becomes larger. It is pointed out that the many-ghost imaging phenomenon is an observable physical effect induced by higher order coherence or higher order correlations of optical fields.Â«Â less\n\nHybrid threshold adaptable quantum secret sharing scheme with reverse Huffman-Fibonacci-tree coding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLai, Hong; Zhang, Jun; Luo, Ming-Xing; Pan, Lei; Pieprzyk, Josef; Xiao, Fuyuan; Orgun, Mehmet A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWith prevalent attacks in communication, sharing a secret between communicating parties is an ongoing challenge.

Classroom Notes\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFalcon, Sergio\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIt is reasonably well known that the ratios of consecutive terms of a Fibonacci series converge to the golden ratio.

Jung speculated that because these incredible events are like the random sparks of a firefly they cannot be pinned down. However, doubting Jung's doubts, the author provides a possible method of elucidating these seemingly random and elusive events. The author draws on a new method, designated the Fibonacci Life-Chart Method (FLCM), which categorizes phase transitions and Phi fractal scaling in human development based on the occurrence of Fibonacci numbers in biological cell division and self-organizing systems. The FLCM offers an orientation towards psychological experience that may have relevance to Jung's theory of synchronicity in which connections are deemed to be intrinsically meaningful rather than demonstrable consequences of cause and effect. In such a model synchronistic events can be seen to be, as the self-organizing system enlarges, manifestations of self-organized critical moments and Phi fractal scaling. Recommendations for future studies include testing the results of the FLCM using case reports of synchronistic and spiritual experiences.

To improve the modelling of new nuclear reactors, the OECD/NEA initiated a nuclear data High Priority Request List (HPRL) entry for the major isotopes (235U, 239Pu). In response to that HPRL entry, we executed a dedicated measurement program on prompt fission Î³-rays employing state-of-the-art lanthanum bromide (LaBr3) detectors with superior timing and good energy resolution.

It has been shown that such an omnidirectional photonic band gap originates from Bragg gap in contrast to zero-n gap or single negative (negative permittivity or negative permeability) gap, and it is insensitive to the incidence angle and the polarization of electromagnetic wave. From the numerical results, the frequency range and central frequency of omnidirectional photonicmoreÂ Â» band gap can be tuned by the thickness and density of the plasma but cease to change with increasing Fibonacci order. The bandwidth of omnidirectional photonic band gap can be notably enlarged. Moreover, the plasma collision frequency has no effect on the bandwidth of omnidirectional photonic band gap. It is shown that such new structure Fibonacci quasiperiodic one-dimensional ternary plasma photonic crystals have a superior feature in the enhancement of frequency range of omnidirectional photonic band gap compared with the conventional ternary and conventional Fibonacci quasiperiodic ternary plasma photonic crystals.Â«Â less\n\nWhy the nth-root function is not a rational function\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDobbs, David E.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe set of functions ? is linearly independent over ?

In our first application we estimate the spreading rates of quantum walks on the line with time-independent coins following the Fibonacci sequence. The estimates we obtain are explicit in terms of the parameters of the system. In our second application, we establish a connection between the classical nearest neighbor Ising model on the one-dimensional lattice in the complex magnetic field regime, and CMV operators. In particular, given a sequence of nearest-neighbor interaction couplings, we construct a sequence of Verblunsky coefficients, such that the support of the Lee-Yang zeros of the partition function for the Ising model in the thermodynamic limit coincides with the essential spectrum of the CMV matrix with the constructed Verblunsky coefficients. Under certain technical conditions, we also show that the zeros distribution measure coincides with the density of states measure for the CMV matrix.\n\nFibonacci Grids\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSwinbank, Richard; Purser, James\n\n2006-01-01\n\nRecent years have seen a resurgence of interest in a variety of non-standard computational grids for global numerical prediction. The motivation has been to reduce problems associated with the converging meridians and the polar singularities of conventional regular latitude-longitude grids. A further impetus has come from the adoption of massively parallel computers, for which it is necessary to distribute work equitably across the processors; this is more practicable for some non-standard grids. Desirable attributes of a grid for high-order spatial finite differencing are: (i) geometrical regularity; (ii) a homogeneous and approximately isotropic spatial resolution; (iii) a low proportion of the grid points where the numerical procedures require special customization (such as near coordinate singularities or grid edges). One family of grid arrangements which, to our knowledge, has never before been applied to numerical weather prediction, but which appears to offer several technical advantages, are what we shall refer to as \"Fibonacci grids\". They can be thought of as mathematically ideal generalizations of the patterns occurring naturally in the spiral arrangements of seeds and fruit found in sunflower heads and pineapples (to give two of the many botanical examples). These grids possess virtually uniform and highly isotropic resolution, with an equal area for each grid point. There are only two compact singular regions on a sphere that require customized numerics. We demonstrate the practicality of these grids in shallow water simulations, and discuss the prospects for efficiently using these frameworks in three-dimensional semi-implicit and semi-Lagrangian weather prediction or climate models.\n\nGolden Proportions for the Generalized Tribonacci Numbers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShah, Devbhadra V.; Mehta, Darshana A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIt is known that the ratios of consecutive terms of Fibonacci and Tribonacci sequences converge to the fixed ratio.

The presence of three stress responsive elements (STREs, CCCCT) in the NTH1 promoter suggested that the transcriptional activator proteins Msn2 and Msn4, as well as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), control the stress-induced expression of Nth1. Here, we give direct evidence that Msn2/Msn4 and the STREs control the heat-, osmotic stress- and diauxic shift-dependent induction of Nth1. Disruption of MSN2 and MSN4 abolishes or significantly reduces the heat- and NaCl-induced increases in Nth1 activity and transcription. Stress-induced increases in activity of a lacZ reporter gene put under control of the NTH1 promoter is nearly absent in the double mutant. In all instances, basal expression is also reduced by about 50%. The trehalose concentration in the msn2 msn4 double mutant increases less during heat stress and drops more slowly during recovery than in wild-type cells. This shows that Msn2/Msn4-controlled expression of enzymes of trehalose synthesis and hydrolysis help to maintain trehalose concentration during stress. However, the Msn2/Msn4-independent mechanism exists for heat control of trehalose metabolism. Site-directed mutagenesis of the three STREs (CCCCT changed to CATCT) in NTH1 promoter fused to a reporter gene indicates that the relative proximity of STREs to each other is important for the function of NTH1. Elimination of the three STREs abolishes the stress-induced responses and reduces basal expression by 30%. Contrary to most STRE-regulated genes, the PKA effect on the induction of NTH1 by heat and sodium chloride is variable.

To describe the nonlinear interactions we employ the discrete nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger (DNLS) equation. Using a single-site localized state in the lattice as our initial condition, we evolve the wavepacket numerically using DNLS equation. We compute the root-mean-square width of the wavepacket as it evolves in time and show how the ``global location'' of initial wavepacket affects the dynamics. We compare and contrast our results with earlier studies of related but distinct models.\n\nProperties of Cordonnier, Perrin and Van der Laan Numbers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShannon, A.

Two models, namely the attractive Hubbard model and the Penson-Kolb model, have been investigated at half-filling at zero temperature by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in real space within a mean-field approximation. The competition between 'disorder' and the pairing interaction leads to a suppression of superconductivity (of usual pairs with zero centre-of-mass momenta) in the strong-coupling limit while an enhancement of the pairing correlation is observed in the weak-coupling regime for both models. However, the dissimilarity of the pairing mechanisms in these two models brings about notable differences in the results. The extent to which the bond-ordered wave and the Î·-paired (of pairs with centre-of-mass momenta = Ï) phases of the Penson-Kolb model are affected by the disorder has also been studied in the present calculation. Some finite size effects are also identified.\n\nAssessing the Pedagogical Impact of the VaNTH Engineering Research Center on Faculty and Postdoctoral Professionals\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCox, Monica; Cawthorne, James; McNeill, Nathan; Cekic, Osman; Frye, Matthew; Stacer, Melissa\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, the Vanderbilt-Northwestern-Texas-Harvard/MIT (VaNTH) Engineering Research Center focused on improving bioengineering education through the applications of learning science, learning technology, and assessment and evaluation within the domain of bioengineering.

N.; Bushnell, D. M.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe-state-of-the-art for the application of linear stability theory and the e to the nth power method for transition prediction and laminar flow control design are summarized, with analyses of previously published low disturbance, swept wing data presented. For any set of transition data with similar stream distrubance levels and spectra, the e to the nth power method for estimating the beginning of transition works reasonably well; however, the value of n can vary significantly, depending upon variations in disturbance field or receptivity. Where disturbance levels are high, the values of n are appreciably below the usual average value of 9 to 10 obtained for relatively low disturbance levels. It is recommended that the design of laminar flow control systems be based on conservative estimates of n and that, in considering the values of n obtained from different analytical approaches or investigations, the designer explore the various assumptions which entered into the analyses.\n\nThe Mean Distance to the nth Neighbour in a Uniform Distribution of Random Points: An Application of Probability Theory\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBhattacharyya, Pratip; Chakrabarti, Bikas K.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe study different ways of determining the mean distance (r[subscript n]) between a reference point and its nth neighbour among random points distributed with uniform density in a D-dimensional Euclidean space.

C.; Gkasios, M.; Tselikas, N. T.; Drakatos, G.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe FDL method makes use of Fibonacci, Dual and Lucas numbers and has shown considerable success in predicting earthquake events locally as well as globally. Predicting the location of the epicenter of an earthquake is one difficult challenge the other being the timing and magnitude. One technique for predicting the onset of earthquakes is the use of cycles, and the discovery of periodicity. Part of this category is the reported FDL method. The basis of the reported FDL method is the creation of FDL future dates based on the onset date of significant earthquakes. The assumption being that each occurred earthquake discontinuity can be thought of as a generating source of FDL time series The connection between past earthquakes and future earthquakes based on FDL numbers has also been reported with sample earthquakes since 1900. Using clustering methods it has been shown that significant earthquakes (<6.5R) can be predicted with very good accuracy window (+-1 day). In this contribution we present an improvement modification to the FDL method, the MFDL method, which performs better than the FDL. We use the FDL numbers to develop possible earthquakes dates but with the important difference that the starting seed date is a trigger planetary aspect prior to the earthquake. Typical planetary aspects are Moon conjunct Sun, Moon opposite Sun, Moon conjunct or opposite North or South Modes. In order to test improvement of the method we used all +8R earthquakes recorded since 1900, (86 earthquakes from USGS data). We have developed the FDL numbers for each of those seeds, and examined the earthquake hit rates (for a window of 3, i.e. +-1 day of target date) and for <6.5R. The successes are counted for each one of the 86 earthquake seeds and we compare the MFDL method with the FDL method. In every case we find improvement when the starting seed date is on the planetary trigger date prior to the earthquake. We observe no improvement only when a planetary trigger coincided with\n\nTerahertz surface plasmon-polaritons in one-dimensional graphene based Fibonacci photonic superlattices\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNamdar, Abdolrahman; Feizollahi Onsoroudi, Rana; Khoshsima, Habib; Sahrai, Mostafa\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe surface plasmon-polaritons in one-dimensional graphene-based Fibonacci photonic superlattices in the terahertz frequency range have been theoretically investigated. Our numerical study shows that surface plasmon-polaritons can be realized in both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations. It is shown that these modes are manageable by varying the quasi-periodic generation orders which play a critical role in the occurrence of surface modes. In addition, the effect of thickness of cap layer and chemical potential of graphene sheets on surface plasmon-polaritons and their electric field distribution are studied. We have verified the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons by using the attenuated total reflection method. This inspection confirms that all the predicted surface modes in the dispersion curves are actually excitable with this method.\n\nClassical simulation of quantum error correction in a Fibonacci anyon code\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurton, Simon; Brell, Courtney G.; Flammia, Steven T.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nClassically simulating the dynamics of anyonic excitations in two-dimensional quantum systems is likely intractable in general because such dynamics are sufficient to implement universal quantum computation. However, processes of interest for the study of quantum error correction in anyon systems are typically drawn from a restricted class that displays significant structure over a wide range of system parameters. We exploit this structure to classically simulate, and thereby demonstrate the success of, an error-correction protocol for a quantum memory based on the universal Fibonacci anyon model. We numerically simulate a phenomenological model of the system and noise processes on lattice sizes of up to 128 Ã128 sites, and find a lower bound on the error-correction threshold of approximately 0.125 errors per edge, which is comparable to those previously known for Abelian and (nonuniversal) non-Abelian anyon models.\n\nCombinatorial Proofs of Honsberger-Type Identities\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPlaza, A.; Falcon, S.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this article, we consider some generalizations of Fibonacci numbers.

This paper employs a 5-year period TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) stock price data and a 13-year period of TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) stock index data as experimental datasets. By comparing our forecasting performances with Chen's (Forecasting enrollments based on fuzzy time-series. Fuzzy Sets Syst. 81 (1996) 311-319), Yu's (Weighted fuzzy time-series models for TAIEX forecasting. Physica A 349 (2004) 609-624) and Huarng's (The application of neural networks to forecast fuzzy time series. Physica A 336 (2006) 481-491) models, we conclude that the proposed model surpasses in accuracy these conventional fuzzy time-series models.\n\nSome efficient methods for obtaining infinite series solutions of n-th order linear ordinary differential equations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAllen, G.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe use of the theta-operator method and generalized hypergeometric functions in obtaining solutions to nth-order linear ordinary differential equations is explained. For completeness, the analysis of the differential equation to determine whether the point of expansion is an ordinary point or a regular singular point is included. The superiority of the two methods shown over the standard method is demonstrated by using all three of the methods to work out several examples. Also included is a compendium of formulae and properties of the theta operator and generalized hypergeometric functions which is complete enough to make the report self-contained.\n\nElectronic and optical properties of GaAs/AlGaAs Fibonacci ordered multiple quantum well systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAmini, M.; Soleimani, M.; Ehsani, M.

In our calculations, two different methods, including transfer matrix and finite-difference have been used. It has been illustrated that with three types of the FO-MQWs, presented here, localization of the wave-function in any position of the structure is possible. Therefore, managing the electron distribution within the system is easier now. Finally, using the presented structures we could tune the position and amplitude of the ORCs.\n\nQuasi-periodic Fibonacci and periodic one-dimensional hypersonic phononic crystals of porous silicon: Experiment and simulation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAliev, Gazi N., E-mail: g.aliev@bath.ac.uk; Goller, Bernhard\n\n2014-09-07\n\nA one-dimensional Fibonacci phononic crystal and a distributed Bragg reflector were constructed from porous silicon. The structures had the same number of layers and similar acoustic impedance mismatch, and were electrochemically etched in highly boron doped silicon wafers. The thickness of the individual layers in the stacks was approximately 2âÎ¼m. Both types of hypersonic band gap structure were studied by direct measurement of the transmittance of longitudinal acoustic waves in the 0.1â2.6âGHz range. Acoustic band gaps deeper than 50âdB were detected in both structures. The experimental results were compared with model calculations employing the transfer matrix method. The acoustic propertiesmoreÂ Â» of periodic and quasi-periodic structures in which half-wave retarding bi-layers do not consist of two quarter-wave retarding layers are discussed. The strong correlation between width and depth of gaps in the transmission spectra is demonstrated. The dominant mechanisms of acoustic losses in porous multilayer structures are discussed. The elastic constants remain proportional over our range of porosity, and hence, the GrÃ¼neisen parameter is constant. This simplifies the expression for the porosity dependence of the Akhiezer damping.Â«Â less\n\nCharacteristics of persistent spin current components in a quasi-periodic Fibonacci ring with spinâorbit interactions: Prediction of spinâorbit coupling and on-site energy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPatra, Moumita; Maiti, Santanu K., E-mail: santanu.maiti@isical.ac.in\n\nIn the present work we investigate the behavior of all three components of persistent spin current in a quasi-periodic Fibonacci ring subjected to Rashba and Dresselhaus spinâorbit interactions. Analogous to persistent charge current in a conducting ring where electrons gain a Berry phase in presence of magnetic flux, spin Berry phase is associated during the motion of electrons in presence of a spinâorbit field which is responsible for the generation of spin current. The interplay between two spinâorbit fields along with quasi-periodic Fibonacci sequence on persistent spin current is described elaborately, and from our analysis, we can estimate the strengthmoreÂ Â» of any one of two spinâorbit couplings together with on-site energy, provided the other is known. - Highlights: â¢ Determination of Rashba and Dresselhaus spinâorbit fields is discussed. â¢ Characteristics of all three components of spin current are explored. â¢ Possibility of estimating on-site energy is given. â¢ Results can be generalized to any lattice models.Â«Â less\n\nAnalysis of the Relationship between the \"n\"th Root Which Is a Whole Number and the \"n\" Consecutive Odd Numbers\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKwenge, Erasmus; Mwewa, Peter; Mulenga, H.

The problem proceeds in n rounds, where each round consists of traveling around the circle from the current position, and selecting the kth remaining element to be eliminated from the circle. After n rounds, every element is eliminated. Special attention is given to the last surviving element, denote it by j. We generalize this popular problem by introducing a uniform number of lives â, so that elements are not eliminated until they have been selected for the âth time. We prove two main results: 1) When n and k are fixed, then j is constant for all values of â larger than the nth Fibonacci number. In other words, the last surviving element stabilizes with respect to increasing the number of lives. 2) When n and j are fixed, then there exists a value of k that allows j to be the last survivor simultaneously for all values of â. In other words, certain skip values ensure that a given position is the last survivor, regardless of the number of lives. For the first result we give an algorithm for determining j (and the entire sequence of selections) that uses O(n 2) arithmetic operations.\n\nFission fragment yield distribution in the heavy-mass region from the 239Pu (nth,f ) reaction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGupta, Y.

Three independent experimental campaigns were performed, allowing a significant reduction of the uncertainties compared to evaluated nuclear data libraries. The long-standing discrepancy of around 10% for the relative yield of A =134 reported in JEF-2.2 and JEFF-3.1.1 data libraries is finally solved. Moreover, the measured mass distribution in thermal neutron-induced fission does not show any significant dip around the shell closure (A =136 ) as seen in heavy-ion fission data of 208Pb(18O, f ) and 238U(18O, f ) reactions. Lastly, comparisons between our experimental data and the predictions from Monte Carlo codes (gef and fifrelin) are presented and discussed.\n\nOn Fibonacci Numbers Which Are Elliptic Carmichael\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-12-27\n\nd|p) = â1, where (a|p) denotes the Legendre symbol of a with respect to p.

The TrueNTH Global Registry project was established as an international registry monitoring care provided to men with localised prostate cancer (CaP). Sites with existing CaP databases in Movember fundraising countries were invited to participate in the international registry. In total, 25 Local Data Centres (LDCs) representing 113 participating sites across 13 countries have nominated to contribute to the project. It will collect a dataset based on the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measures (ICHOM) standardised dataset for localised CaP. A governance strategy has been developed to oversee registry operation, including transmission of reversibly anonymised data. LDCs are represented on the Project Steering Committee, reporting to an Executive Committee. A Project Coordination Centre and Data Coordination Centre (DCC) have been established. A project was undertaken to compare existing datasets, understand capacity at project commencement (baseline) to collect the ICHOM dataset and assist in determining the final data dictionary. 21/25 LDCs provided data dictionaries for review. Some ICHOM data fields were well collected (diagnosis, treatment start dates) and others poorly collected (complications, comorbidities). 17/94 (18%) ICHOM data fields were relegated to non-mandatory fields due to poor capture by most existing registries. Participating sites will transmit data through a web interface biannually to the DCC. Recruitment to the TrueNTH Global Registry-PCOR project will commence in late 2017 with sites progressively contributing reversibly anonymised data following ethical review in local regions. Researchers will have capacity to source deidentified data after the establishment phase.

Often medium sized reactors with power less than 700 MWe are also grouped into this category. Internationally, the development of a variety of designs for SMRs is booming with many designs approaching maturity and even in or nearing the licensing stage. It is for this reason that a generalized yet comprehensive economic model for first of a kind (FOAK) through nth of a kind (NOAK) SMRs based upon rated power, plant configuration, and the fiscal environment was developed. In the model,moreÂ Â» a particular projectâs feasibility is assessed with regards to market conditions and by commonly utilized capital budgeting techniques, such as the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), Payback, and more importantly, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for comparison to other energy production technologies. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effects of changing debt, equity, interest rate, and conditions on the LCOE.Â«Â less\n\nUpdated level scheme of 172Yb from 171Yb(nth, Î³) reaction studied via gamma-gamma coincidence spectrometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNguyen, Ngoc Anh; Nguyen, Xuan Hai; Pham, Dinh Khang; Nguyen, Quang Hung; Ho, Huu Thang\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThis paper provides the updated information on the level scheme of 172Yb nucleus studied via 171Yb(nth, Î³) reaction using the gamma-gamma coincidence spectrometer at Dalat Nuclear Research Institute (Viet Nam). The latter is used because of its advantages in achieving the low Compton background as well as in identifying the correlated gamma transitions. We have detected in total the energies and intensities of 128 two-step gamma cascades corresponding to 79 primary transitions. By comparing the measured data with those extracted from the ENSDF library, 61 primary gamma transitions and corresponding energy levels together with 20 secondary gamma transitions are found to be the same as the ENSDF data. Beside that, 18 additional primary gamma transitions and corresponding energy levels plus 108 secondary ones are not found to currently exist in this library and they are therefore considered as the new data.\n\nStudies On Particle-Accompanied Fission Of 252Cf(sf) And 235U(nth,f)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKopatch, Yu N.; Tishchenko, V.; Speransky, M.; Mutterer, M.; GÃ¶nnenwein, F.; Jesinger, P.; Gagarski, A.

H.; Wollersheim, H.-J.\n\n2005-11-01\n\nIn recent multi-parameter studies of spontaneous and thermal neutron induced fission, 252Cf(sf) and 235U(nth,f) respectively, the energies and emission angles of fission fragments and light charged particles were measured. Fragments were detected by an energy and angle sensitive twin ionization chamber while the light charged particles were identified by a series of ÎE-Erest telescopes. Up to Be the light particle isotopes could be disentangled. In addition, in the 252Cf(sf) experiment, gammas emitted by the fragments were analyzed by a pair of large-volume segmented clover Ge detectors. Here the main interest is to study the Î³-decay and the anisotropy of gammas emitted by fragments and light particles. On the other hand, the high count rates achieved in the U-experiment performed at the high flux reactor of the ILL, Grenoble, should allow to explore fragment-particle correlations in very rare events like quaternary fission. At the present stage of data evaluation, yields and energy distributions of light particles are available. For the present contribution in particular the yields of Be-isotopes for the two reactions studied are compared and discussed. For 252Cf(sf) these isotopic yields were hitherto not known.\n\nRandom number generators for large-scale parallel Monte Carlo simulations on FPGA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLin, Y.; Wang, F.; Liu, B.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThrough parallelization, field programmable gate array (FPGA) can achieve unprecedented speeds in large-scale parallel Monte Carlo (LPMC) simulations. FPGA presents both new constraints and new opportunities for the implementations of random number generators (RNGs), which are key elements of any Monte Carlo (MC) simulation system. Using empirical and application based tests, this study evaluates all of the four RNGs used in previous FPGA based MC studies and newly proposed FPGA implementations for two well-known high-quality RNGs that are suitable for LPMC studies on FPGA. One of the newly proposed FPGA implementations: a parallel version of additive lagged Fibonacci generator (Parallel ALFG) is found to be the best among the evaluated RNGs in fulfilling the needs of LPMC simulations on FPGA.\n\nMAL62 overexpression and NTH1 deletion enhance the freezing tolerance and fermentation capacity of the baker's yeast in lean dough.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Xi; Zhang, Cui-Ying; Wu, Ming-Yue; Fan, Zhi-Hua; Liu, Shan-Na; Zhu, Wen-Bi; Xiao, Dong-Guang\n\n2016-04-04\n\nTrehalose is related to several types of stress responses, especially freezing response in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). It is desirable to manipulate trehalose-related genes to create yeast strains that better tolerate freezing-thaw stress with improved fermentation capacity, which are in high demand in the baking industry. The strain overexpressing MAL62 gene showed increased trehalose content and cell viability after prefermention-freezing and long-term frozen. Deletion of NTH1 in combination of MAL62 overexpression further strengthens freezing tolerance and improves the leavening ability after freezing-thaw stress. The mutants of the industrial baker's yeast with enhanced freezing tolerance and leavening ability in lean dough were developed by genetic engineering. These strains had excellent potential industrial applications.\n\nLarge-Capacity Three-Party Quantum Digital Secret Sharing Using Three Particular Matrices Coding\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLai, Hong; Luo, Ming-Xing; Pieprzyk, Josef; Tao, Li; Liu, Zhi-Ming; Orgun, Mehmet A.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn this paper, we develop a large-capacity quantum digital secret sharing (QDSS) scheme, combined the Fibonacci- and Lucas-valued orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement with the recursive Fibonacci and Lucas matrices. To be exact, Alice prepares pairs of photons in the Fibonacci- and Lucas-valued OAM entangled states, and then allocates them to two participants, say, Bob and Charlie, to establish the secret key. Moreover, the available Fibonacci and Lucas values from the matching entangled states are used as the seed for generating the Fibonacci and Lucas matrices. This is achieved because the entries of the Fibonacci and Lucas matrices are recursive. The secret key can only be obtained jointly by Bob and Charlie, who can further recover the secret. Its security is based on the facts that nonorthogonal states are indistinguishable, and Bob or Charlie detects a Fibonacci number, there is still a twofold uncertainty for Charlie' (Bob') detected value.

These issues are especially crucial in medical applications. The most commonly adopted solution is the encryption of both the image and the patient data in separate files that are then linked. This practice results to be inefficient since, in order to retrieve patient data or analysis details, it is necessary to decrypt both files. In this contribution, an alternative solution for secure medical image annotation is presented. The proposed framework is based on the joint use of a key-dependent wavelet transform, the Integer Fibonacci-Haar transform, of a secure cryptographic scheme, and of a reversible watermarking scheme. The system allows: i) the insertion of the patient data into the encrypted image without requiring the knowledge of the original image, ii) the encryption of annotated images without causing loss in the embedded information, and iii) due to the complete reversibility of the process, it allows recovering the original image after the mark removal. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n\nThe fast decoding of Reed-Solomon codes using number theoretic transforms\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nReed, I. S.; Welch, L. R.; Truong, T. K.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nIt is shown that Reed-Solomon (RS) codes can be encoded and decoded by using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm over finite fields. The arithmetic utilized to perform these transforms requires only integer additions, circular shifts and a minimum number of integer multiplications. The computing time of this transform encoder-decoder for RS codes is less than the time of the standard method for RS codes. More generally, the field GF(q) is also considered, where q is a prime of the form K x 2 to the nth power + 1 and K and n are integers. GF(q) can be used to decode very long RS codes by an efficient FFT algorithm with an improvement in the number of symbols. It is shown that a radix-8 FFT algorithm over GF(q squared) can be utilized to encode and decode very long RS codes with a large number of symbols. For eight symbols in GF(q squared), this transform over GF(q squared) can be made simpler than any other known number theoretic transform with a similar capability. Of special interest is the decoding of a 16-tuple RS code with four errors.\n\nEuclid, Fibonacci, Sketchpad.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLitchfield, Daniel C.; Goldenheim, David A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDescribes the solution to a geometric problem by two ninth-grade mathematicians using The Geometer's Sk"
