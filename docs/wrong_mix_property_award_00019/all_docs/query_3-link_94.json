The new sculpture is next to that of his son William Lawrence Bragg.\n\nTogether, father and son were awarded the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics, the only time that such an awards has been made, for the discovery and development of X-ray crystallography.\n\nThe official unveiling was by the Governor of South Australia, the Honourable Hieu Van Le AO, and other speakers included W. H. Bragg's granddaughter Lady Lucy Adrian and Dr. Paul Willis, Director of the Royal Institution Australia.\n\nRob Robinson and Paris Constantine attended from the Bragg Institute, which is named in honour of William Henry and William Lawrence Bragg, Australia's first Nobel Prize winners."
