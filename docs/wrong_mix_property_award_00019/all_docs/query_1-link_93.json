        "text": "AKA William Lawrence Bragg\n\nBorn: 31-Mar-1890\n\nBirthplace: Adelaide, South Australia, Australia\n\nDied: 1-Jul-1971\n\nLocation of death: Ipswich, Suffolk, England\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge University, England\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Physicist\n\nNationality: Australia\n\nExecutive summary: Bragg's Law of diffraction\n\nMilitary service: British Royal Horse Artillery (1915-19, to Major)\n\nPhysicist Lawrence Bragg studied under J. J. Thomson and was the son of physicist William Bragg. Building on Max von Laue's pioneering work in x-ray crystallography, he proposed in 1912 what is now called Bragg's law of diffraction, which explains how crystals diffract X-ray beams at specific angles of incidence. They theorized that the molecular structure of a crystal could be ascertained from observing and analyzing the x-ray interference pattern, and to prove their assertion they designed an X-ray spectrometer and devised a mathematical system for analyzing its data. For this work and their landmark 1915 book on the topic, X-rays and Crystal Structure, the father-and-son team shared that year's Nobel Prize for Physics.\n\n25 years of age when he won the honor, Bragg was and remains the youngest Nobel laureate in history. He was also awarded the Military Cross during World War I, for his work developing technology to pinpoint the position of enemy artillery by analyzing the sound of their weapons firing. He later studied metallurgy, silicates, and the structure of proteins. At the start of his career atomic theory had only recently been accepted, and examining the behavior of individual atoms seemed like science fiction; toward the end of his career he was the director of Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University in the 1950s, as Francis Crick and James Watson used technology largely built on x-ray methodology developed by Bragg and his father to unravel the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\nFather: William Henry Bragg (physicist)\n\nMother: Gwendoline Todd Bragg (artist, b. 1869, m. 1889, d. 1929)\n\nBrother: Robert Charles Bragg (d. 2-Sep-1915 World War I)\n\nSister: Gwendoline Bragg Caroe (b. circa 1907)\n\nWife: Alice Grace Jenny Hopkinson Bragg (m. 1921, four children)\n\nSon: David William Bragg (engineer)\n\nDaughter: Margaret Alice Bragg\n\nDaughter: Patience Mary Bragg\n\nSon: Stephen Lawrence Bragg (engineer)\n\nHigh School: St. Peter's College, Adelaide, Australia (1904)\n\nUniversity: BS Mathematics, University of Adelaide (1908)\n\nUniversity: MA Physics, Trinity College, Cambridge University (1911)\n\nProfessor: Langworthy Professor of Physics, Victoria University of Manchester (1919-37)\n\nProfessor: Cavendish Professor of Physics, Cambridge University (1938-53)\n\nAdministrator: Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University (1938-53)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1915 (with William Bragg)\n\nMatteucci Medal 1915 (with William Bragg)\n\nMilitary Cross 1918\n\nOfficer of the British Empire 1918\n\nHughes Medal 1931\n\nRoyal Medal 1946\n\nKnight of the British Empire 1941\n\nRoebling Medal 1948\n\nCopley Medal 1966\n\nOrder of the Companions of Honour 1967\n\nRoyal Institution of Great Britain Director (1953-61)\n\nRoyal Society 1921\n\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n\nU.K. National Physical Laboratory Director (1937-38)\n\nAustralian Ancestry\n\nEnglish Ancestry\n\nAppears on the cover of:\n\nTime, 3-Oct-1938, DETAILS: Science, BYLINE: Fifth Director (of Cavendish Lab)\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nX Rays and Crystal Structure (1915, non-fiction, with William Bragg)\n\nThe Structure of Silicates (1930, non-fiction)\n\nThe Crystalline State (1934, non-fiction)\n\nElectricity (1936, non-fiction)\n\nAtomic Structure of Minerals (1937, non-fiction)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Lawrence Bragg\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
