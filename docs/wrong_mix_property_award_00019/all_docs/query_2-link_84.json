        "text": "Biography\n\nRi positions\n\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy, 1938-1953\n\nFullerian Professor of Chemistry, 1954-1966\n\nSuperintendent of the House, 1954-1966\n\nDirector of the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory, 1954-1966\n\nDirector, 1965-1966\n\nEmeritus Professor, 1966-1971\n\nThe son of William Henry Bragg, William Lawrence was born in Adelaide where he attended St Peter's College. He later studied science at the University of Adelaide. When his family moved to England in 1909, he studied mathematics and physics at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nAfter moving to Leeds he and his father worked out how to determine the molecular structure of crystals using X-rays, for which they jointly received the Nobel Prize in 1915. At the age of twenty-five he remains the youngest ever Nobel Prize winner. He served as an officer in the Army in France throughout the Great War where he worked on using sound to determine the location of enemy guns.\n\nIn 1919 he succeeded Ernest Rutherford as Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester where he continued his work on crystallography. Between 1937 and 1938 he was briefly Director of the National Physical Laboratory before again succeeding Rutherford as Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Cavendish Laboratory.\n\nDuring the 1939-1945 war he served on a number of government scientific committees. At the Cavendish he established the Unit for the Study of Molecular Structure of Biological Systems funded by the Medical Research Council where Max Perutz, John Kendrew, Francis Crick and James Watson carried out much of their groundbreaking work on the structures of proteins and of DNA."
