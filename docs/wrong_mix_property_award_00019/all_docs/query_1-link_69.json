        "text": "The material in this Series was stored by John Jenkin in filing cabinets, with labelled suspension files used for high-level subjects and manila folders within these titled at a more granular level. Many of these folders primarily contain photocopies drawn from a variety of sources, often accompanied by research notes and related correspondence. The suspension files have been discarded for preservation reasons, with the labelled tabs retained with the first item from that file. Inventory item titles have been taken from John JenkinÂ’s own manila file titles where available, with the broader suspension file tab recorded as the title qualifier, which appears directly beneath each title.\n\nSeries 3 consists of material relating to William Henry Bragg's later life following his return to the United Kingdom from South Australia.\n\nWilliam Henry Bragg returned to the UK in 1909, taking up a position as Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Leeds. He continued his own research and in 1915 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, along with his son William Lawrence Bragg, for his work on X-ray Crystallography. He continued to be a prominent figure within the scientific community until his death in March 1942.\n\nThis Series can loosely be divided into three main subjects:\n\n1. Research\n\n2. WWI\n\n3. Nobel Prize and Later\n\n1. Consists of material collected by John Jenkin relating to William Henry Bragg and the University of Leeds. Includes contextual material relating to Bragg's appointment and his residences in Leeds. Also includes material relating to his research, largely on X-ray Crystallography, for which he would win a Nobel Prize, as well as material relating to his contempories Norman Campbell, Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley and George Howard Darwin.\n\n2. Consists of material relating to William Henry Bragg during the First World War, particularly in relation to his work attempting to detect German submarines by listening underwater for the sound of their engines. Also includes both contemporary and retrospective articles on science and scientists during the war.\n\n3. Consists of material relating to awards given to William Henry Bragg, including the 1915 Nobel Prize for Physics and Order of Merit in 1931. It also includes material relating to his later life, his work at University College London and his election to the Royal Society."
