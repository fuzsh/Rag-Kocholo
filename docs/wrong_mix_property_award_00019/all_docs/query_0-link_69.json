He died on March 4, 1873 leaving Exine with five small children, ages one year to ten years old. Just two years prior in August 1871, the ir oldest child, James Shelton Nuckolls, had died at the age of nine years . September 23rd, 1872 My dear wife, I have written the foregoing will in order to expedite the settleme nt of my estate, believing my estate to be insolvent. I have no proper ty to will. You must collect from my estate the $8.000.00 due you. In or der to do this, you will probably be compelled to sell off my property, and in order to save yourself from loss, you will perhaps be compelled to buy the place we live in (here). There is also a life insurance poli cy of $5,000.00 in favor of our children. These two Life Policies and t he $8,000.00 due you from my estate will be all that you and the children will have to live and be educated on, and consequently I do not think y ou can afford to undertake to pay off any of the debts, that remain unpaid, with your money. It will take all of the income that you can derive fr om the amount of money that you will have to provide for your family. I can only recommend to you economy and avoidance of debts. I leave to you a heavy burden, my dear wife; may God help you in this unfriendly world . I should have remembered that I have a third Life Policy for $5.000.00, wh ich I transferred to Dr. Copes of N.O. (New Orleans) to secure a debt, a nd it will take quite all of it to pay the debt. This is written for your individual guidance. Most affectionately yours,J. M. Nuckolls Less than six months later in March 1873, Dr. Nuckolls died. After his de ath, his wife Exine bought and operated the plantation for several years before moving to Bell Buckle, TN in about 1890. Her older sister, Elizabeth Olivia Wyche Sandidge lived with her husband, James Shelton Sandidge nearby in Wartrace, TN. Moving to Bell Buckle with Exine were her daughters, Exine, Mary Fletcher and Adele. Exine Wyche Nuckolls died in Bell Buckle January 6, 1896 at the age of 54.\n\n[DI5104] Died at Bellbuckle, Tenn on the morning of the 6th inst, Mrs E W nuckolls, mother of Mr S O Nuckolls, and sister of Major J F Wyche. Mrs Nuckolls once lived in New Iberia and has many friends here who will regret to learn of her death. Source TN State Libary and Archives papers of Maddie Webb Mrs Exine Nuckolls, (Wyche) was born near Huntsville, Ala Oct 17, 1841. Orphaned in early life, she removed to Louisiana and at nineteen years of age was married to Dr John M Nuckolls. Their home was for a time in Bossier Parish, near Shreveport; in 1867 they removed to New Iberia, where Dr Nuckolls died in 1873, leaving her a widow with five children. She came to Tennessee, and died at Bell Buckles, Jan 6, 1896. She knew both sides of life-ease and affluence on the one hand, and struggle and adversity on the other. Her Christian life had its beginnings so far back in childhood that we find no date to attach to them. In reply to our question, one who knew her best said-\"She never knew anything else than to be a Christian.\" Of gentle, resolute nature, she cheerfully filled to the full every place in life that was given her; in prosperity ind and considerate of others, in adversity cheerful and helpful. Home was her paradise, and care for childhood for her chiefest labor and her highest joy. Every curve in her face told of gentle, kindly, and charitable emotions. The tones of her voice vibrated with genuine sympathy. Her illness was protracted, but borne with the utmost patience. She might have remained longer had she not been too willing to go away, to battle for her stay. Others were beckoning her, and she had no fear. We celebrated her entrance into the paradise above at the Methodist Church in Bell Buckle, Jan 7th with softest music and many tears, while we talked of her and prayed for those she loved left behind.

Funeral Services were conducted Thursday afternoon for Samul O Nuckolls, who died after a long inllness at the Touro Infirmary, New Orelas. Services were conducted from the Dauterive Funeral Home with interment in Rose Hill Cemetery. Rev R R Diggs of the Episcopal church, of which Mr Nuckolls was a member, conducted the funeral services. Mr Nuckolls was buried with Masonic honors and the service was conducted by Acting Worshipful Master G O Pharr. Mr Nuckolls was the son of the late Dr J M Nuckolls and Mrs Nuckolls, ne Exine Wyche. He was born in Bossier Parish 67 years ago and moved to New Iberia in early childhood. He was married ti his widow, the former Miss Blanche Romero, 48 years ago. Mr Nuckolls always took an active part in politics and for a number of years was the city judge for New Iberia, and president of the Iberia Parish School Board. Besides his widow, the deceased is survived by two sisters, Mrs mary Fletcher Webb and Mrs Adelle Erwin of Jeanerette. Pallbearers at the funeral were Leon J Landry, P A Landry, Landry T Mixon, Ed LaSalle, Oswald Patout, Joe ReDouen. They are getting fewer and fewer in number-and their number is now negligible-those who became participitants in and helped to mold the life of New Iberia in that generation following the other that derived its tone and character from the sociel and cultural fabric of a South of secession and slavery. This latter generation was made, in many ways, the victimsof the general collapse anddisintregration that followed as an aftermath of the Civil War. Higher educational edvantages were denied them and work with scant renumeration was their lot. But the heritage of fathers of heroic mold and of mothers of rare womanly graces entered into the fibre of the personalities of the young men of this latter generation and gave to them qualities of heart and mind that rendered them equal to the task of reconstructing, along enduring lines, the new civic and social structure of the South. Lapses and falterings and weaknesses bred by the times and conditions and hardships obtaining, marked many of the young men of that generation; but, by and large, these lapses and falterings and weaknesses are dwarfed by the many evidences afforded by them of devotion to exalted principles and of acts reflecting manly and patriotic virtues. Sam O Nuckolls was of this latter generation and he reflected its temper and tempo but withal, the chivalry of the old South was a part of him and loyalty to a cause and to friends marked him through life. He was courteous; he was brave; he was kindly. He possessed a brilliant mind and through wide and select reading and study, he had attained a liberal education. He played an active and militant part in his early manhood in the restoration of white government in the Parish of Iberia and through life, he was found aligned with those who sought good government for Louisiana. He has now passed on to join most of the others of his generation who sleep the eternal sleep. He played his part and made worthy contributions to his generation and his times.....----- A FRIEND\n\n[DI5106] Name: ï¿½tabï¿½Adele Mrs. Nuckolls Erwin Event: ï¿½tabï¿½Death Event Date: ï¿½tabï¿½12 Oct 1949 Event Place: ï¿½tabï¿½Wartrace, Bedford, Tennessee Gender: ï¿½tabï¿½Female Marital Status: ï¿½tabï¿½ Race or Color: ï¿½tabï¿½ Age: ï¿½tabï¿½77 Estimated Birth Year: ï¿½tabï¿½1872 Birth Date: ï¿½tabï¿½ Birthplace: ï¿½tabï¿½ Spouse: ï¿½tabï¿½ Father: ï¿½tabï¿½J.
