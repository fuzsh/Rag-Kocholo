        "text": "London: G. Bell and Sons Ltd 1915. First Edition. vii, [1], 228 pages., [2 index, blank], [2 advertisements].

[17696]\n\nThe Braggs (father and son) were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915 'for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays'. Their experiments showed that X-rays could help identify the atomic structure of materials. 'the work of Bragg and his son Lawrence in 1913-1914 founded a new branch of science of the greatest importance and significance, the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays. If the fundamental discovery of the wave aspect of X-rays, as evidenced by their diffraction in crystals, was due to von Laue and his collaborators, it is equally true that the use of X-rays as an instrument for the systematic revelation of the way in which crystals are built was entirely due to the Braggs. This was recognized by the award of the Nobel Prize jointly to father and son in 1915.' (from the Nobel Prize Biography of WH Bragg). This work is also recognized in an extensive write-up (with Max Von Laue) on X-Ray Crystallography in Printing and the Mind of Men (406b).\n\nProvenance: From the library of Martin J. Buerger (an MIT Professor who did much work in crystallography and has written many books and papers on the subject.) with his ink stamp on front flyleaf.\n\nITEM SOLD"
