        "text": "A tour through Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania\n\n(Some links in this post are affiliate links. If you click through and take action, I'll be compensated.) If you are also interested in any PRINTS from any of my posts, be sure to check out my store where you can buy prints as posters, in metal/wooden frames or on canvas.\n\nWhen you consider Lithuania, it is usually grouped together as a triumvirate with the other Baltic States of Latvia and Estonia as all gained their independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. When you have spent time in their capital cities (Riga, Latvia and Tallinn, Estonia) however, you will realize just how subtly different each one is.\n\nVilnius was my last Baltic capital to visit and I had been wanting to go there for quite some time. Its Old Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site back in 1994. Furthermore, Vilnius itself is a Gamma Global City, meaning that it plays a large role as an economic link among other countries. As the 2009 Capital of Culture, Vilnius is starting to emerge as a modern, forward thinking European city.\n\nI have written other blog posts on Riga (Post here - Riga, Latvia: a look at the largest city in the Baltics) and Tallinn (Post here - Why Tallinn, Estonia is a hidden gem in the Baltics) and I can honestly say that Vilnius is my favorite Baltic city to visit, for reasons that will become clearer in the entirety of this post. The city was packed with stuff to see and do, it was VERY cheap, and I found the people to be very endearing (the trifecta).\n\nCheck out my drone video of Vilnius, Lithuania below!\n\nUnfortunately, the weather was not on my side as the rain was nearly constant during my entire trip. The optimist in me brushed it off (literally) and toured the city anyway, looking for small breaks in the weather to send Toby (my drone) up into the skies to get some great aerial shots.\n\nNestled on top of a hill sits the Monument of the Three Crosses (originally known as Bald Hill, in Kalnai Park). The origin of the crosses date back to a story about the beheading of seven Franciscan friars atop the hill. Wooden crosses were installed in their memory and over time, the crosses were replaced with more robust materials, culminating in the three white crosses you see today. Getting here requires just a short 5 minute hike uphill from the river below and gives you great views of the city (for those who don’t have a drone).\n\nAnother great viewpoint over Vilnius happens to be at Bastion Hill (long name = Bastion of the Vilnius Defense Wall). From here you can see buildings old and modern and bears a museum showcasing the military history of the country over the centuries. The wall actually formed an entire 2.5 km circle around the city, replete with 10 gates. During a war with Russia in the 17th century, the bastion was heavily damaged. It wasn’t until 1987, that the bastion was turned into a museum.\n\nThe Church of St. Theresa is located in Vilnius Old Town and was completely in 1650.\n\nIf you want to experience the Old Town feel of Vilnius, head on over to Pilies Street. Here you can find the storybook cobblestone streets, lined with restaurants and shops, centrally located in the city. Also, take a turn off into a small alleyway and do some exploring if the main street gets too crowded. It runs from Cathedral Square to Town Hall Square and is often the venue for city festivals.\n\nKitas Kampas is both a theater AND a bar that I found to be particular cozy on my trip to Vilnius. This improv theater was founded in 2009 and is situated in the charming Uzupis area of Vilnius. Highly Recommend!! Speaking of Uzupis, it means \"the other side of the river\" in Lithuanian and is the Bohemian part of town. It is a self-declared independent republic (The Republic of Uzupis) and even has many plagues displaying translations of its constitution within the area limits (You can read the constitution here). Head on here for great food, boutique style shops, and great bars.\n\nThe Church of St. Peter and St. Paul is a Baroque Roman Catholic Cathedral located next to the Neris river in the Antakalnis neighbourhood. There are many churches in Vilnius, but if you have to choose just one, this would be it. Unfortunately, it is located a little further away from the city center but if you fancy a nice 30 minute walk, go for it. The inside is gorgeouslly ornate with a pure white facade, completed in 1701.\n\nGediminas Avenue, named after the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, is the main street in Vilnius that houses most of the parliamentary and governmental institutions of Lithuania. The street constantly changed names depending on what period of history you are looking at. It’s been known as St. George Avenue, Mickiewicz Street, Adolf Hitler Street, Stalin Avenue, and Lenin Avenue until its final name now.\n\nThe Vilnius Cathedral, also known as The Cathedral Basilica of St Stanislaus and St Ladislaus of Vilnius, is a Neoclassical church built in 1783, located in the Old Town. Grand Duke coronations have occurred there and it is the resting place of many famous Lithuanian and Polish figures. Artworks and Frescoes from centuries ago currently adorn the walls. The outside to me is the most grand, looking more like a Greek building facade than a cathedral.\n\nThe Gediminas Castle Tower is the most recognizable building in the entire city. It is the remnant of a castle fortifications with origins dating back to 1409. As the center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the tower discusses the history of Vilnius. The tower itself is a source of national pride, presented on Lithuanian currency, a subject in folk songs, and the site of the newly hoisted flag of Lithuania shortly after their independence.\n\nThe legend of the tower, as well as greater Vilnius is as follows:\n\nThe Grand Duke of Lithuania, Gediminas, took down a wild bull after a successful hunt in the woods. He grew tired carrying the bull and spent the night on the hill. He then dreamt that he saw an iron wolf whose howl was as loud as 100 wolves. When trying to make sense of this, the Duke asked a court magician named Lizdeika what the dream meant. The Magician told Geidminas that is was merely an omen saying that Gediminas should build a city there. Upon hearing this, Gediminas build a castle upon this hill and the city of Vilnius around it.\n\nSt. Anne's Church is an absolute rockstar of a church in Vilnius. It is just gorgeous. It is considered to be built in a ‘flamboyant gothic’ and ‘brick gothic’ style. The church is part of a larger complex, with the St. Francis of Assisi (Bernardine) Roman Catholic Church and a monastery. Fire had destroyed the church many times throughout its history but was refurbished in 2009, after being consecrated first in 1500.\n\nThe Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos is one that I hadn’t seen until I flew my drone over it, then I managed to see it up close. It was built for the Orthodox 2nd wife of Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas. Before the Christianization of Lithuania, it was a prominent church. It was protected after the acceptance of Roman Catholicism by the country however. It sits near the bohemian area of Uzupis.\n\nThe Church of St. Johns, St. John the Baptist and St. John the Apostle and Evangelist is located in Old Town Vilnius and a former place of worship for Jesuit faculty and students of the nearby University. It is most recognizable by its tall bell tower.\n\nMy first time in Vilnius will most certainly not be my last. I liked the city enough to know that there is much more I want to discover about it and learn.\n\nFurthermore, since Lithuania is rather small, I also hope to take more day trips to places outside the city, like the 2nd city of Kaunas and the peninsula of Nido on the coastline.\n\nI did a small day trip to the city of Trakai and loved it at as well. Stay tuned for a post on my time there! In the meantime, also consider planning a trip to see Riga and Tallinn in neighboring Latvia and Estonia, respectively.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nFeatured"
