        "text": "Briefing No 11\n\nLithuania and the Enlargement of the European Union\n\nThe opinions expressed in this document do not necessarily reflect the formal position of the European Parliament.\n\nI. POLITICAL SITUATION\n\na) History\n\nIn the time of Vytautas Magnus, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, Lithuania was one of the largest countries in Europe, at its greatest extent, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. In 1569, to counter the threat from the Russian state of Muscovy, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (established in the mid-13th century) united with Poland in the Union of Lublin, forming a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1795, at the third Partition of the Commonwealth, Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. Uprisings against Russian rule were suppressed in 1830-1831 and in 1863, and a policy of \"russification\" was conducted.\n\nIn 1915 Lithuania was occupied by German troops. Despite the occupation, a \"Lithuanian Conference\" was convened in September 1917 and independence was declared on 16 February 1918. The first democratic constitution was adopted in August 1922, but in December 1926 Antanas Smetona seized power and established an authoritarian regime which lasted until 1940. According to the \"Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact\", signed on 23 August 1939 by the USSR and Germany, Lithuania was to be part of the German sphere of influence. However, the Nazi-Soviet Treaty on Friendship and Existing Borders, which was agreed in September, allowed the USSR to take control of Lithuania.\n\nIn March 1990, a new pro-independence parliament elected Vytautas Landsbergis as de facto President of Lithuania and declared the restoration of the independence on 11 March 1990. Lithuania thus became the first of the Baltic States or members of the CIS to make such a declaration of independence. The Soviet military intervention in January 1991 strengthened popular support for Lithuanian independence and a referendum took place in the republic on 9 February 1991. In mid-August 1991 the seizure of power in Moscow by the State Committee for the State of Emergency prompted fears in Lithuania that there would be a renewed attempt to overthrow the Landsbergis administration and to re-impose Soviet rule. Although Soviet military vehicles entered Vilnius, the Lithuanian government ordered the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the republic and reiterated the strong desire of the Lithuanian people to be reintegrated into western Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the coup was followed by the long-awaited recognition of Lithuanian independence by other states. On 6 September 1991, the USSR Council recognised the independence of Lithuania, along with that of Estonia and Latvia.\n\nb) Institutions\n\nAfter independence, Lithuania applied a modified version of the Soviet constitution until the approval of a new constitution by referendum in October 1992. The legislature is the 141 member unicameral Seimas, which sits for a four-year term under a mixed system. 71 MPs are elected in single-member constituencies, while 70 are elected by party-list proportional representation, with a 5% threshold. All Lithuanian citizens over the age of 18 are entitled to vote. Executive power is vested in the Council of Ministers (government), headed by a Prime Minister who is appointed by the President and approved by the Seimas.\n\nThe President is directly elected for a period of five years, and for a maximum of two consecutive terms. Under the Lithuanian constitution, the President is head of state, and has a relatively broad range of powers that include the appointment and removal, subject to confirmation by the Seimas, of the Prime Minister, individual ministers and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The President also has certain powers in relation to foreign policy.\n\nLithuania's judiciary operates through a tiered system of district and administrative (regional) courts. The highest court is the Supreme Court, whose judges are appointed by the Seimas. There is also a Court of Appeal, whose judges are appointed by the President. The Constitutional Court, whose nine judges are appointed by the Seimas, ensures that laws do not conflict with the constitution and has the right to impeach judges and the President. The courts and the Prosecutor's Office have a high degree of independence.\n\nc) Recent Developments\n\ni) Parliamentary Elections of 8 October 2000\n\nPARTY% VOTESEATS 2000SEATS 1996 Social Democratic Union31.0851N/A Liberal Union (LS)17.25341 New Union (NS/SL)19.6429N/A Homeland Union8.62970 Farmers Party4.1442 Christian Democrats3.08216 Christian Democratic Union4.21111 Modern Christian Democratic Union2.011N/A Others9.971041\n\nTurnout: 58.63%\n\nParliamentary elections took place on 8 October 2000. The results followed the pattern of the local election in March which saw a crushing defeat for most of the country's established political parties, and a shift to parties of the so-called 'new politics'. The electorate's desire for change was underlined by the fact that only 37 incumbents were re-elected. The Social Democratic coalition of the former communist Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDDP), the Social Democrats and two minor parties (the New Democracy Party and the Union of Russians) were the largest grouping, winning 51 of the 141 parliamentary seats. The voting highlighted the exceptional popularity, particularly in rural areas and among the elderly, of former President Algirdas Brazauskas, who headed the coalition's list.\n\nThe parties of the 'new politics' which triumphed in the municipal elections - the New Union/Social Liberals (NS/SL), the Liberal Union (LS), the Central Union, and the Modern Christian Democrats - won sufficient support to form the basis of the new government. This was expected, although the distribution of votes among these parties contained several surprises. The NS/SL, which dominated pre-election opinion polls, won 29 seats but did poorly in single-mandate districts, as the popularity of its leader Arturas Paulauskas was not enough to offset the results of most of the party's other candidates. The LS performed better than expected, taking 34 seats, as its candidates did exceptionally well in the single-member districts of Lithuania's three largest cities, winning 15 of the 22 seats there.\n\nOf the larger parties in the old parliament, the Central Union, which had ridden high in the polls in 1998-99, suffered a bad defeat, failing to clear the 5% threshold, although three of its members won single-mandate constituencies. The Homeland Union/Lithuanian Conservatives (TS/LK) failed to rally its traditional supporters, winning just nine seats, in contrast to the 70 it gained in 1996. Moreover, it won only one seat in the single-member constituencies. The party's former voters transferred their support to the LS. The Conservatives' erstwhile partner, the Christian Democratic Party, suffered an even more crushing defeat, winning 3.05% of the vote. Once Lithuania's third most popular party, it seems to be in serious decline.\n\nii) New Coalition Formed\n\nOn 12 October 2000, the LS, NS/SL, Central Union and Modern Christian Democrats, which together have 67 seats, signed a coalition agreement. They will be joined by four members of the Farmers Party, all elected in single-mandate districts. Even then, the coalition will have only the barest majority. Under the terms of the coalition agreement, LS chairman Rolandas Paksas will become Prime Minister, while Paulauskas will become parliamentary chairman. The LS will have with seven ministerial posts, including finance, economics and defence. The NS/SL will be in charge of six ministries, among them internal affairs and foreign affairs. At least two Centrists and Modern Christian Democrats will be appointed deputy ministers, while the head of the Farmers Party, Ramunas Karbauskis, will be a deputy parliamentary chairman.\n\nThe government's programme has not yet been announced, but it is likely to include a commitment to balanced budgets, reduced bureaucracy, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, support for the socially disadvantaged and continuity in foreign policy. This corresponds to the expectations of international financial institutions, the EU, NATO and key foreign investors. Underlining this, Mr Paulauskas asserted that, contrary to popular perception, his party favoured Lithuanian membership of NATO and the EU. He also said that the new government would not cancel the controversial sale of the Mazeikiai oil refinery complex to US firm Williams International, although efforts would be made to increase the efficiency of the refinery's operation.\n\nAt this stage, the consensus among analysts is that the coalition may find it difficult to implement its programme, since its parliamentary majority is vulnerable to defections by individual MPs, but that the coalition should not collapse in the near future.\n\niii) Ignalina nuclear power plant\n\nOn 20-21 June 2000, there was a Donor Conference, co-chaired by the Lithuanian government and the European Commission. The Donor Conference had four aims. First, to highlight Lithuania’s decision to decommission Unit 1 at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant before 2005. Second, to investigate the consequences of decommissioning and of the foreseen liberalisation and restructuring process of the Lithuanian energy sector overall. Third, to solicit the assistance of the international community in helping to bear the expense involved in the decommissioning process itself, as well as in the consequent restructuring of the energy sector. And fourth, to draw the attention of especially private investors to current and future investment opportunities in Lithuania’s energy sector.\n\nThe Conference welcomed the establishment of the International Decommissioning Support Fund, to be managed by the EBRD and containing contributions made available by the European Union and a number of countries represented at the Conference. The grant-based Fund has been established for an initial period of ten years and will be financed in successive increments. The indicative cost of the projects which were suggested by Lithuania amounts toEUR200m for the first five years. In the event, over EUR200m was pledged, the bulk (EUR150m) coming from the European Commission, while EU member states, the Nordic Countries, Switzerland, Poland and the US pledged the balance. It was reported that the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy had offered to lease the plant for $300m per year, having argued that there were no technical grounds for decommissioning as their view was that it was safe. This view was not, however, accepted by others at the Conference.\n\nThe background documentation, including the Lithuanian Economy Ministry position paper, can be found at the Ignalina website, http://iae.lt\n\niv) Law recognising the Declaration of Lithuanian Independence\n\nOn 12 September 2000, the outgoing parliament approved a declaration recognising the Act of 23 June 1941 on the Restoration of Lithuanian Independence. This was not an uncontroversial act, however, since the Lithuanian government during World War II had expressed \"gratitude to Adolf Hitler for liberation of the country from Bolsheviks\" and supported \"a new order in Europe\", which envisaged the physical extermination of the Jews. The June 1941 rebellion is also widely seen as the starting point of the persecution of Lithuanian Jews during the war.\n\nThe decision to recognise the validity of the 1941 Declaration caused uproar and prompted a host of protest both within Lithuania and from abroad. One MP from the then governing Homeland Union resigned his party membership, while the then Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said that adopting the law had been a mistake. The parliament quickly reversed its decision, suspending the act on 19 September and revoking it on 26 September. However, a great deal of damage was caused in the meantime.\n\nv) Forum on looted cultural assets\n\nFrom 3-5 October, Vilnius hosted an international forum on looted cultural assets from the Holocaust-era, which was held under the auspices of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The Forum was seen as a follow-up to a Washington conference that was held last year. The USA announced that it would grant US$500,000 to Russia to register looted Holocaust assets.\n\nAt the forum, the problem of Lithuanian Jewish property was also raised, within the context of the assets that were looted from Jews before the Second World War and have not been returned. According to some estimates, compensation could amount up to LTL 4 billion (US$ 1 billion). Under current Lithuanian law, only Lithuanian citizens permanently residing in Lithuania have a right to have their property restored. Jewish interest groups have protested that persons have a right to their property regardless of their place of residence.\n\nII. ECONOMIC SITUATION\n\na) Economic Overview\n\nAfter independence, the government embarked on a policy of rapid market reforms and macroeconomic stabilisation, which initially had mixed results. The government has been on an IMF-sponsored stabilisation programme since 1994 (1).\n\nLithuania has not yet recovered completely from the negative external shocks, which hit the economy in the aftermath of the Russian financial crisis of August 1998.\n\nIn June 1999, the Government of Lithuania approved a medium term economic strategy, presenting its policy objectives until 2005. Fiscal targets are a more effective revenue collection and more rational expenditure management, so that in the medium term public debt will not exceed 30 percent of GDP. A more precise framework is elaborated in the Memorandum of Economic Policies, presented to the IMF in late February 2000 (2). Concerning macroeconomic conditions, the Memorandum expects a continued export growth to western markets combined with a bottoming-out of the decline in exports to CIS markets and a modest recovery in domestic demand. On an annual base, GDP growth is foreseen to reach 2.2 percent in 2000 and 3.4 percent in 2001. Inflation is expected to remain low, between 2-3 percent in 2000-2001, due to monetary policy restrictions and fiscal tightening. As exports pick up and domestic demand is seen to remain low, the current account deficit is expected to decline gradually.\n\nb) Forecast Performance\n\nAfter a rather sharp contraction in 1999, economic prospects are seen to improve during this and next year. Economic growth will largely be driven by private investment, connected with privatisation and the need to further restructure the Lithuanian economy. In addition, exports should benefit from stronger growth in the EU and the expected recovery in the CIS area. In order to maintain international price competitiveness, wage moderation will limit the growth of real disposable income, keeping the growth of private consumption on a rather low level as well. As a result, GDP growth will probably remain moderate at about 2.2 percent this year. For next year, stronger growth of private consumption and investment is expected to support a further stepping up of GDP growth to about 3.4 percent. However, this is still well below the growth potential of the Lithuanian economy (3).\n\nDue to economic decline and restructuring, the registered unemployment rate rose to 14 percent at the end of 1999. Unemployment is expected to remain relatively high this year, but the Commission forecasters expect it to decline somewhat when the economy is growing faster next year.\n\nc) Current Situation\n\ni) Budgets and Prices\n\nThe general government deficit (including the Social Insurance Fund, the Health Insurance Fund and most extrabudgetary funds) is expected to decrease to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2000, having been 7.8 percent of GDP in 1999. The main focus of the budget is on reducing and streamlining expenditures. The wage bill for civil servants has been frozen. Purchases of non-essential goods and services as well as subsidies for public transportation, postal and telecommunication services and agriculture have been reduced and public investments have been cut back. There are no major tax increases envisaged. However, the payroll tax rate will be raised from 31 to 34 percent. Excise taxes on heavy fuel have been introduced in January 2000 and excise taxes on tobacco have been increased since March from 29 to 34 per cent. Other excise taxes are envisaged this year and the taxation of personal income and enterprise profits might be modified during the year. The budget for 2000 foresees an increase of defence expenditures from 1.5 percent of GDP to (4) 1.8 percent in view of the prospective NATO membership.\n\nThe success of the budget programme largely depends on the exact execution of intended expenditure cuts. The government has to stay firm against requests from suffering enterprises, which might be difficult in the present circumstances, especially with parliamentary elections coming up.\n\nAt the end of August, Lithuania asked the IMF to accept an annual budget deficit higher than the 2.8 percent of GDP promised in its standby agreement. The deficit has widened more than expected, in particular, owing to non-planned spending by the social insurance fund. While Vilnius does not draw IMF credits, agreement with the Fund unlocks other aid and boosts investor confidence.\n\nInflation has fallen drastically, reflecting weak domestic demand, the appreciation of the national currency Litas, the surplus supply of agricultural goods on the domestic market and global trends in commodity prices.\n\nThe effective exchange rate appreciated markedly, not only due to the devaluation of the Russian rouble but also due to the peg of the Litas to the US dollar, which appreciated significantly against the European currencies. In mid-October 1999, the Bank of Lithuania announced that it would shift the peg of the Litas directly to the Euro in the second half of 2001. Previously, a more gradual change, involving a basket of currencies, had been envisaged. This decision had positive effects on the financial markets. However, the Lithuanian interest level is significantly higher than in comparable countries, impeding economic restructuring. The high interest rate level reflects higher economic volatility and the considerable financing needs of the public sector in a narrow and underdeveloped capital market.\n\nAnnual average inflation in 1999 was only 0.8 percent, compared to 5.1 percent in 1998. Excise taxes and some of the regulated prices were raised, but falling food prices, which account for some 40 percent of the consumer price index, offset any inflationary pressure.\n\nIncreased demand in 2000, imported inflation and the need to liberalise regulated prices will lead to a stronger rise in consumer prices.\n\nii) Privatisation\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, privatisation revenues were an important source of finance for the high current account and increasing public sector deficit. In 1998, it was mainly the privatisation of Telekomas, the telecommunications operator, which led to the sharp increase in privatisation revenues from 0.3 percent of GDP in 1997 to 5.3 percent in 1998. In 1999, privatisation revenues amounted to about 1.1 percent of GDP, covering about 13 percent of the public sector deficit.\n\nIn the budget programme for the year 2000, further privatisation revenues are expected, mainly coming form the privatisation of the two remaining state-controlled banks, the Agricultural Bank and the Savings Bank, and further sales of shares from the telecommunications company, Telekomas. Privatisation revenues are estimated to be about 3.5 percent of GDP, which would allow a marked reduction in the relatively expensive domestic financing of the public sector deficit.\n\nOn 3 April, Lithuania announced the launching the privatisation tender for the Agricultural Bank. On 3 May, the Government approved the timetable for the sale of the remaining 35 percent stake of the Telekomas. With respect to the restructuring of infrastructure facilities, the government approved on 26 April a plan for the Lithuanian railways, creating 6 different entities.\n\nAt present, the sale of state assets to western investors is unpopular (5). The unpopularity is to a substantial degree a consequence of the sale last year of the Mazeikiai oil refinery complex to US firm Williams International, a transaction condemned by an overwhelming majority of Lithuanians as contrary to the country's interests. The sale unleashed an unprecedented outburst of anti-western sentiments and calls for a moratorium on the privatisation of so-called strategic assets to foreign firms. The still popular former President, Algirdas Brazauskas, has led the criticism. In early May, he asserted that restructuring and privatisation would cause the oil and gas industry, the energy sector and the railway network \"irrevocable harm\".\n\nThe government hopes that its concerted effort to facilitate the sales will generate a momentum that cannot be reversed by a change of government. Despite the calls for retaining state ownership of vital sectors of the economy and for granting preference to local investors, these sectors are currently unprofitable and local investors do not have access to the large sums of money needed for their restructuring and revitalisation. Pressure from the IMF will likely ensure that the privatisation of the banks will proceed uninterrupted, while the requirements of EU membership will push along the restructuring of the energy and gas sectors.\n\niii) Trade\n\nA small open economy, the Lithuanian economy was hard hit by the sharp decline in export markets. In 1998, exports declined by nearly 4 percent, largely resulting from a 26 percent decline in exports to the CIS. At the same time, imports remained relatively high. In 1998, imports expanded by 2,6 percent due to strong growth in private consumption in the first three-quarters. During 1999 this pattern changed, as imports were increasingly affected by shrinking domestic demand. In 1999 the EU share of Lithuania's exports was about 42 percent, whereas the EU represented almost 45 percent of Lithuania's imports.\n\nTraditional export markets in the CIS countries have faded away and the continued appreciation of the Litas vis-à-vis the Euro have impeded Lithuania's competitiveness on Western markets. In addition, moves connected to the privatisation of the region's only oil refinery led to a temporary shut-down of supplies with a impact on the output of the manufacturing sector. The refinery's share in GDP is about 10 percent.\n\nThe situation of the balance of payments in 1999 was not much different from 1998. Both, the current account deficit and the trade account deficit remained largely on the same level as the year before. However, during the second half of 1999 the trade deficit started to improve as exports improved and imports decreased.\n\nIt is expected that the current account deficit will decline in 2000-2001. This deficit needs to be reduced in order to be sustainable in the medium-term.\n\nLithuania's main trading partners are Germany, Russia and Latvia.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) flows have remained relatively unaffected by the Russian crisis. During 1999 FDI inflows were in line with the trend during recent years, covering a large part of the country's rising external financing needs. Official reserves continue to cover nearly three months of imports of goods and services.\n\nd) Main Economic Trends and Forecast Summary\n\n19981999(e)2000(f)2001(f) Real GDP growth rate (percent)5.1-4.12.23.4 Inflation (CPI, annual average percent)5.10.81.82.5 General Government budget balance (% of DGP)-5.0-7.8-2.8 Current Account balance (% of GDP)-12.7-12.1-10.9-9.0 Unemployment rate (end-of-year, ILO definition)13.314.0\n\n(e) estimate.
