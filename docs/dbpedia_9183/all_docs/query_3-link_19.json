        "text": "Vilnius has always been known as a city of literature, where famous authors have written in various languages and captured its beauty in their internationally renowned works. Literary genres have developed here, and the whole city is marked by literary symbols.\n\nVilnius is home to a number of independent bookshops, it hosts international literary festivals, book launches, readings, and other events. The vast majority of publishing houses in Lithuania are also located in Vilnius. The Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania has been actively running in Vilnius for more than 100 years, and the International Vilnius Book Fair, the largest book fair in the Baltic States, will be held for the 24th time in 2024.\n\nVilnius is deemed a literary city by a number of representatives of other literary cities who have visited Lithuania, and who have attended the International Vilnius Book Fair and/or other literary events and organisations. In fact, even the history of our city coincides with literary signs as we celebrate the birthday of Vilnius on the 25th of January. On this day, in 1323, for the first time ever, Vilnius was mentioned in a letter written by Gediminas, the Duke of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the letter, Vilnius is described as an open city to all nations, all languages, and all creative people. Thereby, as a UNESCO City of Literature, Vilnius invites you to “Read the Other”.\n\nKotryna Zylė and Miglė Vasiliauskaitė have designed a logo to represent the literary status of Vilnius, drawing attention to the multi-cultural history of Vilnius, to the inherited mission to read the other as well as the neighbour. The letter V with the symbol of an ellipsis is meant to emphasise the city’s openness, the dialogue between cultures, writers and readers, between different nationalities and social groups, between creators, between the city’s inhabitants and its visitors.\n\nWe hope that this status will spread the message to Europe and the rest of the world about Vilnius’ achievements in and contributions to literature. We hope that by becoming one of the UNESCO Cities of Literature, Vilnius will be able not only to learn, but also to share its experience."
