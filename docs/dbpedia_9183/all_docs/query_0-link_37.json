        "text": "Between Presence and Memory. Historic Images of the Vilnius Castles\n\nYear of release:2024\n\nPrice:25.00 â¬\n\nThe catalogue of the exhibition \"Between Presence and Memory. Historic Images of the Vilnius Castles\", held at the National Museum – Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, presents a comprehensive exploration of the rich iconographic and historical material collected alongside research findings about the residence of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania and other structures within the Vilnius Castles ensemble. Serving as the pivotal political, economic and cultural centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since the Middle Ages, the Vilnius Castles hold profound significance. Despite the demolition of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, its historic essence was revived through the works and research of artists, photographers, architects and other authors spanning the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nMore details\n\nAn UNtroubled age. Childhood in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania\n\nYear of release:2024\n\nPrice:25.00 â¬\n\nThe catalogue of the international exhibition “An UNtroubled age. Childhood in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania” presents nearly 300 objects: portraits, medals, graphic works and drawings, children's clothing and accessories, toys and weapons, and other artefacts related to childhood. Readers of the catalogue will recognise the universal items that are important in children's lives, regardless of the era: baby care items, furniture, toys, books, without which no generation grew up.\n\nÂ\n\nMore details\n\nThe Tapestries of Sigismund Augustus in Vilnius\n\nYear of release:2023\n\nPrice:25.00 â¬\n\nThe catalogue of the international exhibition \"Tapestries of Sigismund Augustus in Vilnius\" presents the priceless collection of tapestries of Sigismund Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, from the Royal Palace of Wawel. The cultural value of the tapestries of Sigismund Augustus is staggering, and the historical legacy of this collection is of great symbolic significance. The Augustus collection is world famous for its biblical tapestries, the earliest set of which was first mentioned in 1553. By the end of the 16th century, the collection had grown to 160 pieces, making it the largest collection of tapestries ever commissioned by a single individual.\n\nMore details\n\nThe Dawn of Gediminasâ City. The Oldest Preserved Wooden Building in Vilnius and its Most Unique Artefacts\n\nYear of release:2023\n\nPrice:5.00 â¬\n\n„The Vilnius Castle Hill, along with the Lower Castle with the rulers’ residence at its foot at the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia rivers, is one of the most valuable historic and archaeological complexes in Lithuania. The special geological constitution of this location and the high groundwater level have meant that particularly rare, organic artefacts, otherwise sensitive to the passage of time, have been preserved quite well, making this territory a true treasure trove of artefacts made from organic materials. Vilnius traces its origins to this very place, in the Vilnius Castles territory, its history as the centre of the Lithuanian state, its eternal capital, whose beginnings are evidenced by unique archaeological artefacts that have survived into our days.“\n\nÂ\n\nMore details\n\nGreetings to Vilnius from Lviv. European Art Masterpieces from the Borys Voznytsky Lviv National Art Gallery\n\nYear of release:2023\n\nPrice:20.00 â¬\n\nCatalogue of the international exhibition \"Greetings to Vilnius from Lviv. European Art Masterpieces from the Borys Voznytsky Lviv National Art Gallery\" is clear testimony of the shared historical and European bonds existing in the Central and East European region, which are further confirmed by the rich cultural and artistic heritage in Lviv and Vilnius.Â\n\nMore details\n\nSecrets of the Vilnia riverside\n\nYear of release:2023\n\nPrice:4.00 â¬\n\nThis is a historical detective story that introduces young readers to the history of the oldest surviving wooden building in Vilnius. The book is aimed at children aged 5-8 who like stories about people who lived long ago and want to learn about their everyday life. The story will take young readers back to the time when the children of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas played on the banks of the Vilnia, to the distant past, when the brick towers of Vilnius castles had not yet been erected, and people lived in small wooden houses on the banks of the Vilnia. The story is a work of writers' imagination, but it mentions many historical figures and facts. The little detectives will have to find out what is real and what is fictional, and the historical artefacts found by archaeologists in the book will help them understand who and how these objects speak.\n\nÂ\n\nMore details\n\nTo keep the homeland. Lithuania and Poland in the epoch of the 1791 Constitution\n\nYear of release:2022\n\nPrice:20.00 â¬\n\nThis catalogue is dedicated to the international exhibition \"To keep the homeland. Lithuania and Poland in the epoch of the 1791 Constitution\", marking the historical fate of the united Polish and Lithuanian state, the hope for the rebirth of the nation and the state that shone out in the second half of the 18th century, and the tragic outcome, which was determined by the exclusively aggressive intentions and interests of the neighbours. The year 2021 marks the 230th anniversary of the promulgation of the Constitution of 3 May and the adoption of the Act of Mutual Obligation, or the Act of Mutual Pledge, between the two nations. Each anniversary provides an opportunity and an incentive to take a closer look at the facts of history and to reflect on the meanings, causes and consequences of the events of that time.\n\nMore details\n\nBrick latrines of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania and other Vilnius Lower Castle structures in the 16th-17th centuries\n\nYear of release:2022\n\nPrice:5.00 â¬\n\nThis book presents the archaeological research material of the 16th-17th century stone latrines that were investigated in the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania and other buildings of the Vilnius Lower Castle. For the first time, an attempt has been made to systematize and summarize the extremely rich data from different scientific fields. On the basis of their analysis, the time of construction, functioning and filling of the latrines was specified, their construction was discussed, and the complexes of finds found in the latrines were presented. The artefacts found in the latrines illustrate the palace's more than a century-long period of prosperity and present the interiors, exteriors and everyday culture of the manor in different periods.\n\nÂ\n\nMore details\n\nA Spiritual Shield. The Munich Prayer Book of the Chancellor of Lithuania Albertus Gastold\n\nYear of release:2022\n\nPrice:12.00 â¬\n\nThe international one-work exhibition \"The Spiritual Shield: a Prayer Book from Munich by Lithuanian Chancellor Albert GoÅ¡tautas\" accompanying catalogue presents an altar commissioned by the eminent statesman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, defender of the independence of the Lithuanian state, Grand Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Count Albert GoÅ¡tautas, Grand Duke of Vilnius, and commissioned by the monk Stanislaus SamostÅ¡elnik of the Cistercian Abbey of Mogila (pol. Stanislaw Samostrzelnik, Lot. Stanislaus Claratumbensis, c. 1480-1541). It is a book with masterly miniatures and other elements, published in Cracow in 1528, and clearly stands out from the large collection of manuscripts from the Middle Ages and the early modern period.\n\nÂ\n\nMore details"
