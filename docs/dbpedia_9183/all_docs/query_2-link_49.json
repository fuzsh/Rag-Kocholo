        "text": "The capital of the Republic of Lithuania is Vilnius. The Vilnius city municipality is one of 60 municipalities in Lithuania. It is in the south eastern part of country, in Vilnius County and consists of the city of Vilnius, the town of Grigiskes and some rural areas.\n\nVilnius is a hard city to pin down. Its not quite Eastern European, not quite Scandinavian, not Russian, and not German. Its not even quite Lithuanian. This ambiguity, the diversity of influences, actually gives the city its unique character and charm.\n\nAll major Lithuanian institutions of higher education and culture are situated in Vilnius. They include the Academy of Sciences, Art Academy and Music Academy, Vilnius University, the University of Technology, the Pedagogical University, and over 40 research institutes. Among the many museums are the Lithuanian National Museum, Lithuanian Art Museum, and Museum of Applied Arts. In Kernave, a State Museum of Archaeology and History has been founded.\n\nIn the modern rapidly developing city, there is a medieval Old Town with classic narrow streets, small yards, red tiled houses, gothic churches and magnificent baroque buildings. The Old Town of Vilnius is not only one of the most beautiful, but one of the biggest in Europe.\n\nThe only national gem of Lithuania is amber found on the Baltic Sea shores. Baltic amber, often called the Lithuanian Gold, is famous and highly treasured all over the world. Now there is even a museum of this precious stone in Vilnius.\n\nVilnius has a few clubs and discos. Theres a growing range of eateries offering everything from Lithuanian to Lebanese cuisine although the majority of places serve the standard meat and potatoes. Theres little difference between eating and drinking venues bars and cafes invariably serve snacks and meals and often represent better value for money than restaurants. The beer is very good, but this is a country with a rich culture and many beautiful things to see. There is much more to it than cheap beer.\n\nVery pleasant and very beautiful, thats what comes to ones mind when talking about Vilnius. The city displays a variety of both architectural expression and willpower. This is perhaps due to the interesting history that rests in this attractive town, which not always has been the capital of Lithuania. Take a trip and see for yourself. Vilnius is the kind of beautiful, unspoilt city that is certain to attract a lot of tourists.\n\nTourism is certain to be a major growth area for Lithuania when Ryan air or Easy jet begins offering flights to Vilnius."
