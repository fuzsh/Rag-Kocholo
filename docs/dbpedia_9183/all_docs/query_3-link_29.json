        "text": "Despite being the capital of Lithuania, the city of Vilnius is sometimes overlooked in favour of its neighbouring Baltic capitals. You might be wondering – is Vilnius worth visiting? In this short guide, we’ll help you answer that all-important question.\n\nBrief History on Vilnius\n\nVilnius is located in the Baltic country of Lithuania, just west of Minsk, Belarus. It is the second-largest city of the Baltic states. Vilnius was supposedly founded in the early 14th century, by the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Gediminas.\n\nWhere to stay in Vilnius\n\nLithuania’s capital has a range of great hotels to choose from. We’ve handpicked the best choices for you, broken down by budget.\n\nBudget: Old Town Trio Hostel Rooms\n\nLocated squarely within Vilnius’ Old Town, the Old Town Trio Hostel Rooms provides the perfect budget accommodation for those looking for cleanliness and comfort without the hefty price tag.\n\nYou can take a closer look at Old Town Trio Hostel Rooms by clicking here.\n\nMid-Range: Hotel Vilnia\n\nThis four-star hotel packs some serious style into its rooms, and yet it’s somehow still so affordable. Don’t ask why, simply take advantage when you can! Hotel Vilnia has almost-perfect ratings and location-wise, it doesn’t get much better.\n\nYou can take a closer look at Hotel Vilnia by clicking here.\n\nLuxury: Hotel PACAI\n\nSet in a Baroque palace dating back to 1677, the Hotel PACAI effortlessly combines old-world charm with modern interior design touches. This hotel is located firmly in the center of Vilnius Old Town.\n\nYou can take a closer look at Hotel PACAI by clicking here.\n\nWhere We Stayed: Hilton Garden Inn Vilnius City Centre\n\nWe chose to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Vilnius City Centre and this hotel was absolutely perfect to us. Conveniently located near restaurants, public transport and even bubble tea (our favourite), the Hilton Garden Inn hotel was stylish, immaculate and amazing in every way. Plus, the hotel had some of the friendliest staff at the hotel I’ve ever met.\n\nWhy Should I Visit Vilnius?\n\nAlthough more and more tourists are coming to Vilnius, this gem is still relatively unknown. Vilnius doesn’t feature in a lot of European itineraries, but I think this is a huge missed opportunity.\n\nI travelled throughout Europe across 2 months in December 2021 and January 2022, visiting countries such as Ukraine, Switzerland, Latvia, Finland, Spain, Luxembourg and more. In all these travels, Vilnius was my favourite city.\n\nSo why did I love Vilnius so much? Well, Vilnius is something that has to be experienced for yourself. I truly think this is a magical city. The architecture is so beautiful, the streets are well-kept, the people are friendly, and the culture is brimming.\n\nOn my walking tour of Vilnius, I learnt that the capital city of Lithuania has a lot of education to its history. It’s a city of scholars, university students and teachers. Lithuanians are constantly learning, and are a pretty sophisticated bunch of people.\n\nOther attractions such as Cathedral Square, St Anne’s Church and the Three Crosses Monument were all unforgettable as well. You can read more about my visit to these destinations in my other blog post about my time in Vilnius.\n\nIf you’re a lover of architecture, arts, scenic views and great food, then Vilnius is perfect for you. If you love an incredibly affordable capital city that isn’t too crowded, and has just the right amount of activity and excitement, then I would recommend visiting Vilnius.\n\nVilnius is also surrounded by other worthwhile destinations. Beautiful attractions in Kaunas and Trakai are just a short distance away, and can be enjoyed in a half-day trip from Vilnius. I particularly loved Trakai Castle Island – seriously so beautiful! I would also definitely recommend visiting Trakai, if you’re visiting Vilnius.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that if you’re a person who loves bustling capital cities with epic sweeping views, crowds of people and lots of choices in regards to food, accommodation and nightlife, then perhaps Vilnius wouldn’t be your first choice. You might want to consider visiting larger and busier cities such as Budapest, Vienna or Prague.\n\nAlthough Vilnius encapsulates around 500,000 people, the city isn’t the liveliest at night. There is nightlife around, but the bars and nightclubs probably pale in comparison to other megacities in Europe.\n\nIf you’re a luxury traveller, you might not be in awe of Vilnius and its surrounds. While impressive, the architecture here isn’t adorned with gold decorations or anything like that – it has more of a pretty, modest appeal.\n\nFinally, if you’re not already in the area, visiting Vilnius can be ‘quite out of the way’. For example, the capital city of Poland, Warsaw, is some 6.5+ hours away by car.\n\nFinal Verdict – Is Vilnius Worth Visiting?\n\nYes, Vilnius is absolutely worth visiting. In my opinion, Vilnius is one of Europe’s most underrated cities, and deserves even more praise than what it’s getting now. You may not see Vilnius’ beauty upfront straight away, but its special quality seeps in subtly, moment by moment, until you find yourself wanting to come back."
