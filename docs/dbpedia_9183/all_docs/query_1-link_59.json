In 1219, twenty princes and dukes, and one duchess, from Auktaitija concluded a peace treaty with the Romanovichi of Galich-Volynia, the earliest agreement involving Lithuanian leaders which survives. The leaders of three Lithuanian clans (see Chapter 1) were recognised as senior by the other princes and between them created the office of Grand Duke or rex de Owsteiten, the term used by the Teutonic Knights. emaitija remained divided among many different lords, who acknowledged the overlordship of the Grand Duke. Lithuania became an indissoluble union after 1422 .\n\nThe main sources for Lithuanian history are the three redactions of the Lithuanian Chronicles, all written in Old Church Slavonic. The first was compiled in the 1420s but exists today only in later transcriptions and compilations. A Latin translation of the first redaction, \"Origo regis Jagyelo et Witholdi ducum Lithuaniæ\", was made in the 15th century . A transcript of this document is available in a Russian language website on the web . Extracts from this have been included in the present document (\"Origo regis Jagyelo\"), but the transcript is surprisingly short and it has been impossible to judge its completeness or accuracy because of lack of Russian language skills. The second redaction was compiled in the first half of the 16th century, adds a legendary story relating to the alleged foundation of the Lithuanian state in the 1st century, but ignores Mindaugas first king of Lithuania and other early historically attested dukes in its narrative of subsequent Lithuanian history . The third is known only from the 16th century Bychowiec Chronicle, discovered in 1830 and considered one of the least reliable sources of the epoch but also the most complete redaction of the Lithuanian Chronicle . It was published in 1907 in the Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles . A collection of Lithuanian charters of a political character was published in the mid-19th century by Raczyński, but this includes no private donations to religious foundations .\n\nA genealogy of the descendants of Gedymin Grand Duke of Lithuania is included in Europäische Stammtafeln . Presumably it is based on extracts from different redactions of the Lithuanian Chronicle but this is not known with certainty as the bibliography lists only Polish and German secondary sources, published between 1959 and 1976, which have not been consulted. This Europäische Stammtafeln version has been used as the basis for the structure of the present document but, considering the unreliability of the original primary sources, it should be viewed with caution.\n\nThe primary sources which confirm the parentage and marriages of members of these Lithuanian families have not yet been identified, unless otherwise indicated in this document.\n\nChapter 1. 13th Century LITHUANIA\n\nA. DYNASTY of RINGAUDAS [1219]-1285\n\nRINGAUDAS, son of --- (-after 1219). He was recognised [after 1219] as RINGAUDAS first Grand Duke [didysis kunigaiktis/velikii kniaz] of Lithuania.\n\nm ---.

The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. He succeeded in [1282] as DAUMANTAS Grand Duke of Lithuania. He died on campaign in north-east Rus .\n\n2.MINDAUGAS [Mindovg] (-murdered 1263). The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. He succeeded his brother in 1238 as MINDAUGAS Grand Duke of Lithuania. In response to pressures from the Knights of the Teutonic Order, he unified, defended and expanded Lithuanian territory . The Lithuanians attacked Polotsk from [1240/45], and by the early 1250s the western part of Polotsk was recognised as Lithuanian territory under the terms of a truce concluded by his son Vaivilkas . The Catholic baptism of Mindaugas was organised by Andreas von Stirland, Master of the Livonian order of the Teutonic Knights, in 1251. In 1253 Pope Innocent IV sent him a royal crown, and he was crowned by Bishop Heinrich, the papal representative, styling himself thereafter \"Myndowe Dei gratia rex Lettowie\" . \"Myndowe Rex Lettowie\" confirmed the privileges of the Christian church in Lithuania by charter dated 12 [Mar or May] 1254 . He entered an alliance with Daniil King of Galich to fight the Mongols, sealed by their marriage of his daughter with Daniil's son. However, Mindovg abandoned Daniil when relations with the Mongols deteriorated and arrested his son Roman who had been installed at Novgorodok, whereupon Daniil launched an attack against Lithuania with the Mongols . \"Myndowe Rex Lettowie\" granted his kingdom to the Teutonic Order in Livonia if he died without heirs, by charter dated Jun 1260 . He repudiated Christianity in 1261 and expelled Christians from Lithuania. He was murdered by Daumentas of Nalia, acting for Treniota, nephew of Mindaugas . The murder is reported in the Novgorod Chronicle which says that Grand Duke Mindaugas was \"killed by his own relatives who conspired without anybody's knowledge\" .

He captured Novgorodok by 1254, was baptised, became a monk and founded a convent outside the city. According to the Novgorod Chronicle, he went to Mount Sinai where he was \"shorn into the monastic order\" and remained three years before returning to Lithuania and his father who tried to persuade him to renounce his faith . After his father was murdered, he abandoned the religious life to avenge him . The Novgorod Chronicle says that Voyshelk \"vowed himself to God for three years when he should resume his gown but did not leave the monastic order\" . He succeeded his cousin in 1265 as VAIVILKAS Grand Duke of Lithuania. He returned to monastic life in 1267, appointing his brother-in-law as his successor. He was murdered by Lev King of Galich, brother of his successor, because he had not been named ruler of Lithuania . The Annales Polononum record that \"dux Leo filius Danielis regis Rusie\" killed \"Woyslaum filium Mendogi ducis Lithwanonum\" in 1267 .\n\nb) daughter .

Implicated in the murder of Grand Duke Mindaugas, he fled to Russia where he settled at Pskov in 1265 . He was baptised as TIMOFEI. In 1266, he was installed as Prince of Pskov , from where he attacked Polotsk, then ruled by the Lithuanian Erden whose wife (who was the aunt of Daumantas) he captured . The Novgorod Chronicle says that he \"took Gerden's Knyaginya\" but does not refer to her relationship to Daumantas. It also does not specify that the expedition was against Polotsk, merely \"against the pagan Lithuanians\" . He built up the defences of the city of Pskov against the Teutonic knights and founded several churches to commemorate his victories. After his death he was revered as a saint at Pskov . m (after 1282) MARIA Dmitrievna of Vladimir, daughter of DMITRY I Aleksandrovich Grand Prince of Vladimir & his wife --- (-1300). The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not yet been identified. According to the Novgorod Chronicle, Prince Dmitry's \"two daughters\" were taken to Novgorod from Koporya as hostages in 1282, which dates Maria's marriage to after this date .

ORIGINS, GRAND DUKES of LITHUANIA 1282-1315\n\nThis family originated in Auktaitija, but its origins are unknown. Two manuscripts of the Russian prose-poem Zadonshchina refer to the grandsons of Grand Duke Gediminas as great grandsons [pravnuki] of SKOLOMEND/Skoldimer, and Rowell speculates that this could refer to a more remote ancestor. A 16th century genealogy alleges that the family originated in Ukmergè [Vilkmergé/Wilkomierz], a fortified centre in eastern Lithuania .\n\nTwo brothers, origins unknown.\n\n1.BUTIGEIDAS . 1289.\n\n2.PUKUVERAS [Budividas] (-1295).

He succeeded his father in 1295 as VYTENIS Grand Duke of Lithuania. The war between Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights intensified in the 1290s after the Prussian and Livonian tribes had capitulated. The Chronicon Terræ Prussiæ of Peter von Dusburg records that \"rex Vithenus cum multitudines copiosa Lethowinorum\" invaded \"terram Lyvonie\" in 1296 . In 1298, Grand Duke Vytenis sent Lithuanian troops to defend Riga against attacks by the Teutonic Order, at the request of the Archbishop of Riga . He acquired Polotsk 1307 on the extinction of the Riurikid princes there. By this time, Lithuanian territory also encompassed Minsk, Pinsk and Turov . The Chronicon Terræ Prussiæ of Peter von Dusburg records another invasion of \"terram Prussie\" by \"Vithenus rex Lethowie\" 3 Apr 1311 which ended in his defeat by the Teutonic Order . His last recorded appearance is in an account of a Lithuanian raid against Prussia in Sep 1315 . m ---. The name of Vytenis's wife is not known.

He succeeded his brother in 1315 as GEDIMINAS Grand Duke of Lithuania. He styled himself \"Gedeminne Dei Gratia Letwinorum et multorum Ruthenorum Rex\". He transferred his main residence to Vilnius before Jan 1323, building two castles there as well as Catholic and Orthodox churches to serve foreign merchants and artisans . He expanded Lithuanian hegemony over large parts of western Rus, acquiring Viterbsk in 1318 by marrying his son Algirdas to the heiress of the last prince, Volynia and Kiev by conquest in 1323, Minsk in 1326, and later Turov and Pinsk . Conflicts with the Teutonic Knights continued from the start of Gediminas's reign with frequent attacks on emaitija, until Gediminas offered peace in 1322, a four year peace treaty being signed 2 Oct 1323 at Vilnius and ratified by the pope 31 Aug 1324 . Although he wrote to Pope John XXII in 1322 announcing his readiness to welcome the Catholic faith to Lithuania, he refused baptism when the papal legates arrived in Vilnius in 1324 . \"Gedeminnen deme Koninge van Lettouuen\" agreed a peace agreement with Estonia, Livonia and Curland by charter dated [Oct] 1323 .

According to Rowell, \"the tradition that Gediminas had two wives, one of whom was Orthodox (Eva, mother of Grand Duke Jaunutis) has no solid basis\" . Her date of death is suggested by an interpolation in the third redaction of the Lithuanian Chronicle .]\n\nGediminas & his [---] wife had [fourteen] children:\n\n1.MANVIDAS [Montovid] (-[1342]). The Origo Regis Jagyelo records that \"ducem magnum Lithuanie Gediminum\" had seven sons, of whom \"primus et senior Montiwid\" to whom his father gave \"Bernow et Slonym\" .
