        "text": "Location and site\n\nVilnius, an inland Baltic city, is in the midst of a region of wooded hills and ravines. It is at the junction of the Neris and the Vilnia Rivers and occupies their shared terraces.\n\nUrban morphology\n\nThe area of the three castles of Vilnius (upper, lower, and curved) is the heart of the historic city, which also includes the zone once enclosed within its walls as well as the older, contiguous suburban blocks. Narrow medieval streets radiate outwards from the central node, and more recent squares, dating to the 16th century, have been integrated into the ensemble.\n\nThe city is dense with monuments. In addition to the Midininkai Gate, which is the only surviving gate, the urban fabric is made up of palaces, the city hall, the new arsenal, and numerous religious buildings, including 20 Catholic churches, 4 Orthodox churches, a Lutheran church, a Reformed Evangelist church, an Oriental Catholic church, numerous synagogues, and monasteries. The combination of styles – Gothic, Renaissance, Classical, Modern, and, especially, Baroque – gives this reconstructed landscape a rich sense of harmony.\n\nRegistration criteria\n\nCriterion (ii): Vilnius is an outstanding example of a medieval foundation that exercised a profound influence on architectural and cultural developments in a wide area of Eastern Europe over several centuries.\n\nCriterion (iv): In the townscape and the rich diversity of buildings that it preserves, Vilnius is an exceptional illustration of a Central European town that evolved organically over a period of five centuries.\n\nHistorical reference\n\nAround 1000 A.D., a wooden castle was erected on a hill that had been fortified in the 5th and 6th centuries. Castles and dwellings were constructed on the surrounding hills.\n\nVilnius, which was founded by Prince Gediminas (1316-1341), became the capital of the Grand Principality of Lithuania in 1323. The Church of Saint Nicholas and the Franciscan church were constructed.\n\nThe Christianisation of the country and the attribution of the Magdeburg City Rights to the city led to the opening of Vilnius to the West in 1387. It became the seat of the first Bishop of Lithuania. A new cathedral was erected on the site of the 13th-century cathedral and the pagan temple.\n\nThe victory over the Teutonic Knights at Tannenberg in 1410 put an end to their destructive attacks, particularly in 1377. The urban growth that followed entailed the construction of the lower castle, Gothic churches, and monasteries. New streets were laid out after the fire of 1471. A fortification wall with five gates was erected between 1503 and 1522 to protect the city from the Mongol threat.\n\nThe influence of Vilnius spread throughout both Western and Eastern Europe. A university was constructed in 1579, and the city became a major cultural center for the Jews of Eastern Europe.\n\nVilnius suffered during the Russian occupation (1655-1660), the Swedish occupation (1702-1706), and various fires. It was annexed to Russia in 1795, and its wall and lower castle were demolished. The majority of its major monuments survived despite the destruction caused by the Second World War."
