Some were complex, as we traveled from Tallinn to Riga to Vilnius using their service, with luggage transfers, and tours in between the cities for our group of 4. Every single thing was perfect, and Eva-Maria arranged things for us that were not on their web site. We were also lucky enough to get Eva-Maria herself for our tour of Tallinn. Every guide was excellent, every driver was professional, and every bit of logistics was perfect. City tours? No problem. Riga-Hill of Crosses-Vilnius? No problem. Just use them.\n\nWe arranged 5 tours and transfers via email with Eva-Maria.
