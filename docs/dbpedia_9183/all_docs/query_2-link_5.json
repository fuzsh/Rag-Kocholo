        "text": "The legend of Vilnius\n\nToday Vilnius is 700 years old. Legend has it that the city started with a dream Grand Duke Gediminas had on a hunting trip. In his dream, Gediminas saw a huge iron wolf standing on a hill howling as if hundreds of wolves were trapped inside it. When the Grand Duke consulted the court magician Lizdeika, he was told that the wolf was a symbol of a great capital that would one day stand atop that hill. By 1323, Gediminas was already sending letters to European cities inviting merchants and craftspeople to visit the city.\n\nFacts about Vilnius\n\nVilnius is the capital of Lithuania and thus home to the country’s President, Seimas, Government and Supreme Court. Diplomatic missions, as well as educational, cultural, financial, research, and healthcare institutions are based here.\n\nWeather in Vilnius\n\nThe rainy season begins in October and gradually turns to snow by December. Winters in Vilnius are usually mild, but you might come to Vilnius when it’s truly freezing. Good news: there’s still plenty to do despite the cold. The end of January and February are usually the coldest months. You might be lucky and enjoy snow during Christmas, but you can expect even more snow after the New Year.\n\nSpringtime is lovely with flowers blooming, but you should also expect some rain. It might get hot (25-30°C) in June, but summer kicks into high gear in July. Summer weather is a mix of hot temperatures and sun, or rain showers and colder wind. Don’t worry too much; the weather is always perfect to explore Vilnius.\n\nPublic Holidays in Vilnius\n\nJanuary 1 (New Year’s Day)\n\nFebruary 16 (Restoration of the State Day (Independence Day, 1918))\n\nMarch 11 (Restoration of Independence Day (from the Soviet Union, 1990))\n\nApril 12-13, 2020 (Easter)\n\nMay 1 (International Labour Day)\n\nJune 24 (St. John‘s Day)\n\nJuly 6 (Day of Statehood (Crowning of Lithuanian King Mindaugas))\n\nAugust 15 (Assumption)\n\nNovember 1 (All Saints‘ Day)\n\nDecember 24 (Christmas Eve)\n\nDecember 25-26 (Christmas)\n\nCulture in Vilnius\n\nThe magical Old Town of Vilnius holds many secrets and a long history. The cobblestone streets lead you on a romantic walk through the UNESCO World Heritage site. But Vilnius has more tricks up its sleeve. Vilnius is home to many talented contemporary artists, which means you can attend a play or a film by a world-famous Lithuanian director, listen to the best opera singer in the world, or visit the exhibition of an acclaimed contemporary artist.\n\nDozens of free events take place daily in Vilnius, and every month there’s a theatre, film, dance, or a culture festival going on. Vilnius is also a hot destination for touring artists, so plan ahead and you might get to see them up close and personal while in town. At night, Vilnius turns into a different city where people dance until sunrise amid a booming club and bar culture.\n\nOutside Vilnius\n\nThere’s plenty to see in Vilnius, but if you have more time on your hands, a day-trip will open up new horizons. There are various daytrip options depending on your interests, but one common feature is that they’re all relatively close by and easily accessible.\n\nJust a 30-minute trip from Vilnius, the Town of Trakai is home to a stunning fairy tale view of a castle in the middle of a lake. The KernavÄ Archaeological Site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the valley of the Neris River, will transport you to prehistoric and medieval ages.\n\nYou can also visit the geographical centre of Europe, which is near Vilnius, and then check out Europos Park, an exquisite open-air contemporary art museum. Ready for a bigger road-trip? Take a day-trip to Kaunas, the Hill of Crosses, or even go to the Baltic Sea."
