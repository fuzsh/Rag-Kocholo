        "text": "Known for its rich history and picturesque Old Town, Vilnius is quickly building a reputation as a fresh destination with dynamic arts and culture scenes, seemingly endless culinary delights and a packed events calendar.\n\nVilnius’ UNESCO-listed Old Town is one of the largest and best-preserved medieval old towns in Central and Eastern Europe. Needless to say, many of the city’s most popular attractions can be found in the Old Town, which makes for an easy, pleasant walk. In fact, most of the city’s landmarks and facilities are within walking distance.\n\nVilnius is beautiful from every perspective, but for a truly alternative view, visitors should admire it from above. The city is one of the few capitals in the world that allows hot air balloons to fly over it, which has become a popular activity that offers unique views.\n\nOne of the top European capitals with the best air quality, Vilnius is also one of Europe’s greenest capitals – it often seems like part of a huge lush forest. Vingis Park, the city’s largest, has a network of walking and cycling paths that lead through a forest, leaving everyone wondering if they’re still in a city. Moreover, Vilnius’ two rivers are perfect for water sports or a leisurely boat ride. Lovers of the outdoors and active people are happy in Vilnius.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Vilnius is currently in the midst of a delicious culinary revival. Many often characterise the city as a crossroads between the past and present, and this is evident in the local food culture. Visitors can still head to the traditional markets to buy cured meats and freshly picked berries from the same people who have been working the stalls for the last few decades, or dine in a more contemporary setting where traditions are challenged and new culinary paths are constantly being forged.\n\nThe city can also be found on the silver screen, and has been used as the backdrop for HBO hits like Chernobyl and Catherine the Great. Guests can now take themed tours of the sets to learn more about the films and TV shows that have come together in Lithuania’s capital."
