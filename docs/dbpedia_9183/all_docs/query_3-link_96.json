        "text": "Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park is the first and only industrial park in the capital of Lithuania, dedicated exclusively to the development of innovative business.\n\n24 ha VCIIP territory is surrounded by national forests and already has a fully developed infrastructure. It is dedicated to Lithuanian and foreign companies that want to build research centres, laboratories or factories, as well as to business and science collaboration; nearby are some of the best universities in Lithuania, as well as main science centres.\n\nIn 2015, VCIIP was granted the status of a national importance economic project.\n\nRead more\n\n“The biopharmaceutical market is a dynamic and rapidly developing field, where several important trends are observed: the growth of biological therapy and genetic engineering, personalised medicine, innovations in bioprocess technologies, etc. All these innovations require high bioprocess flexibility, precision, and high-class risk management – all of which we can offer in the development and supply of single-use products. And VCIIP was selected because of a focus on innovative industry development. This reflects our mission to support innovative biotech industry companies, allows us to be in an innovative environment and seek valuable collaborations with companies based at VCIIP.”\n\n“Currently, the main sweetener in the world is traditional sugar, but its popularity in the world has been declining for 10 years in a row. The main reasons for this are the trends of healthy lifestyle and well-being, the intervention of governments in the form of taxes and the recommendations of global organisations such as WHO, CDC, OHID to limit the consumption of sweeteners (including sugar). We see that the place of ordinary sweeteners is little by little being taken by artificial sweeteners of high intensity without calories. Here at VCIIP “Pentasweet” will develop a natural (not artificial) sweetener that will be able to compete with both ordinary sweeteners and artificial ones, while maintaining the best qualities of being sweet, being virtually calorie free and inexpensive. And we chose VCIIP because of the location, availability of resources, convenience, logistics and land lease terms.”\n\n„The world is undergoing rapid developments, technological changes and an increasing pace of life. People encounter much stress and tension, which affect their emotional environment and physical condition. A healthy diet, which nowadays is hardly imagined without food supplements, is one of the major means to stay healthy and active. So racing to satisfy the daily needs of a modern human being, we keep studying the composition of contemporary food supplements and their functional elements to offer innovative solutions. That’s why we are planning to built a modern research laboratory and food supplement plant in the VCIIP territory, that will allow us to expand the range of provided products and services.”\n\n„Most life sciences companies face similar challenges as they grow: first and foremost, the R&D and production infrastructure meeting GMP and GLP standards. In recent years, “CMB medicina” together with partners, have been carrying out R&D and production activities in the field of health technologies and biotechnologies quite intensively, therefore the need for infrastructure capacity has increased, and the possibility of concentrating activities in one place in Vilnius seemed appropriate. Therefore, in order to make better use of networking and synergy opportunities for faster development of “CMB medicina” and other companies in the sector, we chose VCIIP.”\n\n„We have never had any doubts about the development of “CMB medicina” in Vilnius. And the choice to plan the development at VCIIP was determined by several important factors: first of all – the developed transport infrastructure and possibility to establish relatively quickly, as well as the strong core of biotechnology companies already established at VCIIP and the neighbourhood of Vilnius University and Vilnius Tech. These are important conditions that, with the development of the company’s R&D and production infrastructure, will enable the growth of both the company and the cluster of advanced therapy medicinal products and other health technologies and biotechnologies research coordinated by “CMB medicina”.”\n\n„To continue offering Lithuanian and foreign families a world-class education with the infrastructure that meets its needs, we have planned the development of our new campus in Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park. We have chosen VCIIP not only because of its special location surrounded by nature, but also because of the strong scientific and business community that is emerging in the innovation industrial park, with which we expect strong synergies. We employ the latest technology to enhance children’s learning experience and therefore this is an extraordinary opportunity to integrate experiential education into the learning process and to give students a chance to observe closely how scientific discoveries and innovations are born.”\n\n„The Stem Cell Research Centre has reached the point for development. We chose a place for it in Vilnius, because the largest biotechnology competencies in Lithuania are concentrated here. For us, Vilnius is a strategic place for development due to employees, logistics and interaction with other companies in our group. We chose Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park because of the convenient territory for business development and important communications. In addition, a unique concentration of life sciences companies and research institutions is forming in this area, with which we expect high synergy. This will be a great place to work for our existing and new employees. We have already envisaged opportunities for further development of the company – we have left room for the second stage of the company’s development. When the company will need larger biotechnology production facilities, we hope to establish a 15,000 m2 biotechnology plant here in the future.”\n\n„The ability to establish and adapt infrastructure to our needs comes rarely, especially in such a convenient location. We see the proximity of creative companies and research institutions in the park as an opportunity to strengthen business-business and science-business synergies, which will help to implement complex projects more efficiently. No less important reason – we believe in Vilnius as a city where the highest-level professionals would like to live and create, we believe in the vision and mission of the Park. Therefore, the decision to settle at VCIIP was very simple.”\n\n“Our decision to settle at VCIIP is based on several reasons – it is a convenient location with developed infrastructure, rapidly growing VCIIP life sciences community, and of course – the value proposition itself, which allows us to plan the rapid development of the company. In preparation for the expansion of the production of immunological diagnostic tests and their components, we are going to set up a factory and laboratory to develop new products at VCIIP by the end of 2023. It’s an important move which will help us to grow the company’s scientific and innovative potential in the future.”\n\nThe construction of the Technology Development Center began in Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park (VCIIP), and a symbolic time capsule was buried at the construction site on April 9th. A unique technology development centre dedicated exclusively to the life sciences industry with a laboratory complex for specialised work with microorganisms, viruses and bacteria is the first building of its type and scope in Vilnius in the last decade. The area of the future modern, modern, economical, environmentally friendly science and high-tech building will reach more than 4,000 square meters, most of the building area will be occupied by specialised life sciences laboratories, and office premises.\n\nThe building will be adapted for scientific research and applied activities and most of the building’s area will be occupied by specialized life sciences laboratories, and office premises. “The Technology Development Center is a very important part of the ecosystem of the Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park. It will allow VCIIP to attract sustainable companies operating in the field of life sciences and create physical conditions for the faster development of innovations and technologies developed by them”, says the CEO of Northtown Vilnius, operator of VCIIP Dr Gediminas Pauliukevičius.\n\nAnother biotechnology company – Pentasweet, carrying out research and experimental development activities in the fields of biotechnology and agro-innovation, is starting its establishment at the Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park. The company developing innovative food products and supplements plans to establish at VCIIP by 2026. It is expected that the investment in Pentasweet’s R&D and production infrastructure, meeting the requirements of good production and laboratory practice, in the innovation park will reach 18 million Euros.\n\nThis project is particularly important for our community at VCIIP. The demand for high-quality, internationally recognised educational services in Vilnius is growing, and the fact that the British School of Vilnius’ education model is oriented towards STEAM only reinforces the school’s connection to the VCIIP community. Soon, VCIIP will become a city within a city, where about 1000 people working in Lithuanian and international companies and research centres located here, will circulate daily.\n\nVCIIP visited BIO International Convention in Boston with the Lithuanian delegation from June 5th to 8th, 2023. VCIIP has been participating in the world’s largest biotechnology exhibition for several years now, aiming not only to establish connections but also to develop VCIIP in line with global biotechnology trends and practices, and to gain experience on how to strengthen innovation and the biotechnology ecosystem in Lithuania.\n\nIn April 2018, the municipality of Vilnius established Vilnius City Innovation Industrial Park and in August appointed Northtown Vilnius as its operator.\n\n5 years after the establishment of the Park, the attracted investments already exceed 73 million euros, 20 companies and 6 clusters are located in the territory, more than 500 high added value generating new job openings have been created, and a business incubator established."
