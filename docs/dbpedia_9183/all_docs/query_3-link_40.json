Vilnius palms are prepared from willow branches and catkins. As palm trees are not indigenous to Lithuania, willow branches serve as symbolic substitutes for them. Vilnius palms can be very different, from very short and small to long and thick, usually, they are about 50 centimetres long, colorful, with different patterns from various dried flowers and herbs. Traditional Vilnius Easter palms were made by combining intense coloured flowers in winding patterns, but now, palms are made simpler, in calmer colours and patterns, usually in grey and pastel. The tradition of Vilnius Easter palms reaches the times of prince Casimir. These palms are unique all over the world. They became popular and were added to minor folk art creations thanks to a famous artist, painter – Ferdinandas Ruščicas (1870 – 1936). This tradition has to be cherished. The cradle of Vilnius palms is in Zujūnai parish, Kriaučiūnai village, even today almost all of it‘s villages have famous palm makers. In the year 2000, in Čekoniškės, a palms and appliances house has been opened for visitors.\n\nVilnius district is charming because of its cultural space – monuments of architecture, ethnographic villages, folklore ensembles, creative works of folk and proffessional artists. If you visit Vilnius district – memories of its picturesque places, amazing nature and objects of cultural heritage will stay in your mind for a very long time."
