Abstract

The genus Zizyphus showed a high degree of polyploidy. Chromosome number of cultivar Umran (Z. mauritiana Lamk.) was found to be 2n=48 whereas in the other cultivar Illaichi of same species it was 2n=96. The chromosome number of two wild forms viz. Gola ber and Boradi was also recorded as 2n=96. Another wild form Jhar ber (Z. rotundifolia Lamk.) showed variation in chromosome number. The chromosome number was either 2n=48 or 72. The association of chromosomes to nucleolus during meiosis and formation of multivalents was also noticed. The evolution of polyploid forms and its impact have also been discussed.
