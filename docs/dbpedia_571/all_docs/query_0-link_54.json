        "text": "Herbs have always been the natural form of medicine in India. Medicinal plants have curative properties due to presence of various complex chemical substances of different composition which contain secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponin and phenolic compounds distributed in different parts of the plants. Ziziphus jujuba Mill, a member of the family Rhamnaceae, commonly known as Bor, is used traditionally as tonic and aphrodisiac and sometimes as Hypnotic-sedative and Anxiolytic, anticancer (Melanoma cells), Antifungal, Antibacterial, Antiulcer, Anti-inflammatory, Cognitive, Antispastic, Antifertility/contraception, Hypotensive and Antinephritic, Cardiotonic, Antioxidant, Immunostimulant, and Wound healing properties. It possesses allied compounds viz. Ascorbic acid, thiamine, riboflavin-bioflavonoids and Pectin A and various chemical substances like Mauritine-A; Amphibine-H; Jubanine-A; Jubanine-B; Mucronine-D and Nummularine-B. Sativanine-E. Frangu...\n\nZiziphus oxyphylla (ZO) is distributed mainly in tropic and warm temperate regions in the world. Pakistan owns six (06) indigenous species of genus Ziziphus out of which ZO is widely used for traditional treatment of different ailments such as diabetes, jaundice and liver diseases. The present review aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive literature overview, regarding botanical, chemical and biological characteristics of the plant alongwith phytochemical isolation and mechanistic studies to support its folklore and traditional uses. The literature search and relevant information were collected through authentic resources using data bases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct, peer reviewed articles, books and thesis. The phytochemical characterization as well as color tests confirmed the presence of diverse chemical groups presents in the plant such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds and tannins. In-vivo and in-vitro pharmacological...\n\nMedicinal plants are the primary raw materials used in the production of medicinal products all over the world. As a result, more study on plants with therapeutic potential is required. e tropical tree Ziziphus spina belongs to the Rhamnaceae family. Biological reports and traditional applications including management of diabetes and treatment of malaria, digestive issues, typhoid, liver complaints, weakness, skin infections, urinary disorders, obesity, diarrhoea, and sleeplessness have all been treated with di erent parts of Z. spina all over the globe. e plant is identi ed as a rich source of diverse chemical compounds. is study is a comprehensive yet detailed review of Z. spina based on major ndings from around the world regarding ethnopharmacology, biological evaluation, and chemical composition. Scopus, Web of Science, BioMed Central, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer Link, and Google Scholar were searched to nd published articles. From the 186 research articles reviewed, we revealed the leaf extract to be signi cant against free radicals, microbes, parasites, in ammation-related cases, obesity, and cancer. Chemically, polyphenols/ avonoids were the most reported compounds with a composition of 66 compounds out of the total 193 compounds reported from di erent parts of the plant. However, the safety and e cacy of Z. spina have not been wholly assessed in humans, and further well-designed clinical trials are needed to corroborate preclinical ndings. e mechanism of action of the leaf extract should be examined. e standard dose and safety of the leaf should be established.\n\nCurrent studies were performed to overview the phytochemistry, nutritional and medicinal value of Ziziphus mauritiana (commonly known as Ber in Pakistan). The leaves of Z. mauritiana are comprised of proteins, amino acids, alkaloids, terpenoids, fibers, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, and phenolic compounds. The leave majorly demonstrate the presence of α-linolenic acid, plamitic acid and methyl stearate in n-hexane, chloroform and methanol extracts. The seed contains the highest content of carbohydrate (63.24%) and calorific value (411.61 kJ) while its fruit shows the highest quantity of moisture. Its fruit is slightly acidic (pH around 4.77) and rich in nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates vitamin C and minerals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Na, K, Ca, P). The fruit provides energy of 1516-1575 kJ per its 100 g. Z. mauritiana displays antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Its leaves are used for treating tuberculosis, small pox, burning sensations, dysentary asthma, ...\n\nZiziphus nummularia, a small bush of the Rhamnaceae family, has been widely used in traditional folk medicine, is rich in bioactive molecules, and has many reported pharmacological and therapeutic properties. Objective: To gather the current knowledge related to the medicinal characteristics of Z. nummularia. Specifically, its phytochemical contents and pharmacological activities in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, are discussed. Methods: Major scientific literature databases, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Chemical s, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Abstracts, Henriette’s Herbal Homepage, Dr. Duke’s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases, were searched to retrieve articles related to the review subject. General web searches using Google and Google scholar were also utilized. The search period covered articles published between 1980 and the end of October 2021.The search used the keywords ‘Ziziphus nummul...\n\nDespite tremendous progress in human medicines infectious diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites are still a major threat to public health. Their impact is particularly large in developing countries due to relative unavailability of medicines and emergence of widespread drugs resistance (Zampini 2009).The aim and objectives of this research work was designed to carried out the Phytochemical analysis, proximate composition and evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the Ziziphus jujube and Ziziphus spina christi leaves against clinical bacterial isolates (Escherichia coli, Staphloccoccus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae) as they were found out that since ancient times to date, they are used in treating various antimicrobial, ailmentand disorders etc. The results of the research shows that, the effect of antibacterial activities of both aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Ziziphus jujube (e extract conc. aqueous; F=119.37, Bacterial extract conc. aqueous; F=1.00 an..."
