        "text": "Summary\n\nAll Essential Benefits/Effects/Facts & Information\n\nZiziphus Jujuba is a fruit used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for purposes related to gastrointestinal health and digestion, as well as being a combination sedative/anxiolytic/pain-killer. It has apparently potent benefits according to Traditional Chinese Medicine, but there is limited human evidence and evidence in general on the benefits of Ziziphus Jujuba.\n\nIt appears to be pro-motility in regards to the intestines, speeding up transit time and encouraging defecation. This is associated with an increase in intestinal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and an increase in fecal moisture content, so it may be 'healthier' than other laxatives (to stretch the usage of the term 'healthy').\n\nIn rats fed high doses of Jujube, the sedative and Anxiety-reducing effects appear to actually be quite potent with at least one study noting that there is similar potency to Diazepam, and the sedative properties may be synergistic with 5-HTP. There are currently no human studies on the sedative or anxiety-reducing effects of Jujube.\n\nTraditional usage suggests Jujube may be anti-fertility for females, and a single rat study appears to find similar effects (although did not measure actual conception rates, just uterus size and estrus); it would be prudent to avoid usage of Jujube if trying to conceive a child.\n\n1.1. Sources\n\nZiziphus Jujuba (Chinese Date) is a fruit-bearing plant belonging to the Rhamnaceae family and theZiziphus genus, with the species of Zizyphus.[1] The botanical name for this plant is Ziziphus zizyphus, and commonly referred to as either Jujube or Jujuba (with the former being technically correct but as common); other names for the fruit of this plant are Chinese Date, Korean Date, Indian Date, or Red Date.\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (where it is called Suan Zao Ren), Jujuba is used for anodyne (pain-killing), antitumor, pectoral, refrigerant, sedative, stomachic, styptic and tonic medication; in Japan, Jujuba is used to treat chronic hepatitis or fullness in the chest and ribs.It also appears to have antifungal and insecticidal properties,and in some areas it is also reported to be antidiarrhoeal.\n\n1.2. Composition\n\nJujube tends to contain as its terpenoid and saponin profile:\n\nJujubosides such as Jujuboside A (0.126-0.476mg/g), Jujuboside B (0.106-0.506mg/g)as well as D and E as well as the amine compound Jubanine E\n\nZizyphus saponin I and II (2.59-7.24mg/g and up to 3.05mg/g with some undetectable samples in the leaves; respectively) and zizybeoside II at 130-410mcg/g\n\nCeanothic acid (0.48-5.77mg/g in the leaves; 2.6-4.3mg/100g in berries), epiceanothic acid (0.57-7.63mg/g leaves; 13.8-19.6mg/100g berries), and ceanothenic acid (0.26-0.32mg/g but usually undetectable in leaves)\n\nMaslinic acid (0.44-1.66mg/g, sometimes undetectable in leaves; 41.5-66.3mg/100g berries), oleanolic acid (0.59-1.47mg/g in leaves; 18.3 -41.7mg/g berries) and Oleanonic acid (37.5-110.5mg/100g in berries)\n\nBetulinic acid (1.13-4.35mg/g in the leaves; 7.8-48.7mg/100g usually with one sample reaching 362.2mg/100g) and zizyberanalic acid (1.13-2.37mg/100g, sometimes undetectable)and Zizyberenalic acid\n\nUrsolic Acid (6.5-26mg/g berries) and 2Î±-hydroxyursolic acid (0.69-4.02mg/g in leaves)\n\nAlphitolic acid (0.89-3.99mg/g in leaves; 20.6-41.3mg/100g in berries),Colubrinic Acid,and Ursonic acid (22.3-95mg/100g)\n\nCoumaroyl compounds 3-O-cis-p-Coumaroylalphitolic acid and 3-O-trans-p-Coumaroylalphitolic acid (aka. Coumaroylmaslinic acid)\n\nPomolic acid, Pomonic acid (10.7-175.4mg/100g in berries; highly variable), and Pomolic acid methyl ester\n\nPalmatic (1.5-2.4mg/g), Palmitoleic (0.3-1.7mg/g) and Oleic acids (8-50mg/g), no Lauric acid appears to exist in Jujuba\n\nLinoleic Acid (6-28mg/g), Myristic acid (0.1-0.8mg/g), Stearic acid (0.6-2.8mg/g), Arachidic acid (0.1-0.9mg/g), and Docosanoic acid (2.7-7.7mg/g)\n\nOleanolic/Ursonic acid\n\nVarious aromatic oils\n\nWhereas the flavonoid and polyphenolic profile contains:\n\nApigenin and its diglucoside Isovitexin\n\nSwertish and Puerarin as monoglucoside flavonoids\n\nSpinosin and Isospinosin as diglucoside flavonoids, 6'''-feruloylspinosin and 6'''-feruloylisospinosin as related molecules and 6'''- sinapoylspinosin\n\n(-)-epiafzelechin\n\nRutin (Quercetin-3-O-Rutinoside)at 15.78-32.74mg/g of the leaves\n\nProtocatechuic acid, Chlorogenic Acid, Gallic Acid, and Caffeic Acid\n\nWith various other compounds including:\n\nNucleosides and Nucleobases, at 420-550mcg/g and mostly cAMP and Uridine\n\nDietary minerals such as Selenium (0.242mcg/g), Zinc (13.8mcg/g), and Iron (38.2mcg/g)\n\nWith some bioactive polysaccharides (totalling 5.1-6.76% total weight in these two studies,reporting a third (not available online) citing 4.42 to 7.91%;these are 77.1% of dry weight, since the fruits have a high water content) consisting of:\n\nNeutral polysaccharide (arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose at 0.3:0.2:0.2:1:0.7 ratios)which appears to have anti-oxidant properties\n\nAcidic polysaccharides containing rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose and galactose in a ratio of either 0.3:9.6:0.1:0.4:1:12.1 or 3:16.8:1.2:0.2:1:12.2 that are also anti-oxidant in nature\n\nAcidic polysaccharide with rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, glucose and galactose at 21:24:2:1:20\n\nMany compounds are structurally similar to Apigenin, as Swertish is an Apigenin molecule with a methoxy (-OCH3) group at the 7-carbon instead of a hydroxy (-OH) group and a single glucose bound to it; Puerarin is an isomer of Swertish with the glucose bound to the 8 carbon rather than the 6 carbon.\n\nSpinospin and Isospinosin have a second glucose molecule bound to the first via an oxygen bridge at 4'', with the only differences being that Spinosin is built off of Swertish and Isospinosin off of Puerarin (with a molecule called Isovitexin built off of Apigenin).Adding 6'''-feruloyl- to these structures is due to adding a ferulic acid molecule to the 6''' carbon on the second glucose.\n\nAlthough bioactives tend to vary in concentration depending on cultivar, growing conditions, and soil conditions; the pulps tend to have more amino acids on a per gram basis when compared to the seeds and vice versa when it comes to flavonoid content, with the seeds posessing more than the pulp.\n\nReferences"
