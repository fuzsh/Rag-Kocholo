However, it is affected by many serious diseases like powdery mildew, sooty mold, leaf spots (Alternaria, Cercospora, Septoria, Cladosporium, Pestalotiopsis etc.) and rust among the fungal infections and witches broom caused by MLOs. Powdery mildew (Oidium erysiphoides var. zizyphi Yan & Wang) is economically important disease, which results in 50-60% loss in fruit yield and reduces market value of the produce. The disease is known to be severe in early pruned crop (April first fortnight) and generally favoured by rainfall, warm humid conditions proceeding to its appearance on fruits during September to December. The disease can be effectively managed by alternate sprays of triadimefon at 0.1% followed by wettable sulphur at 0.3% at an interval of 12-15 days. Among many genotypes, Jogia and Mundia were found resistant while, popular cultivar Umran was highly susceptible and another cultivar Kadaka was moderately resistant to powdery mildew. Among the other diseases, sooty mold caused by Isariopsis inidica var. zizyphi that causes sooty/black spots on leaf surface covering large area of leaves, often resulting in defoliation and reduced yields. The leaf spots caused by Cercospora zizyphi and C. jujube cause circular oval spots on leaves whereas Alternaria chartarum forms small irregular brown spots resulting in defoliation. These diseases can be managed by carbendazim at 0.2% spray. The rust (Phakopsora zizyphi-vulgaris Diet.) causes small irregular reddish brown pustules covering entire leaves resulting in drying and defoliation. The disease can be managed by spraying mancozeb at 0.2% or zineb at 0.2% or wettable sulphur at 0.2%. Witches broom, a MLO disease causes phyllody of plants producing auxillary bud proliferation giving bushy appearance and transmitted through grafting.\n\nCitation\n\nJamadar, M.M., Balikai, R.A. and Sataraddi, A.R.
