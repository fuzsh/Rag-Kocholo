        "text": "The root bark of Zizyphus nummularia (Rhamnaceae) is traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory agent. The current study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory activity (in vivo) of a crude ethanolic extract (EE) and the pure identified octadecahydro-picene-2,3,14,15-tetranone (IC) in the root bark of Z. nummularia. IC was further subjected to suitable in vitro and in silico studies to find out the mechanistic pharmacology. EE (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) and (IC) (400 and 600 μg/kg, p.o.) were subjected to in vivo anti-inflammatory assays to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity and predict the probable mechanism(s) of action. Suitable acute (carrageenan-induced paw edema, arachidonic acid-induced ear edema, xylene-induced ear edema) and chronic (cotton pellet granuloma) models were employed to investigate in vivo the anti-inflammatory activity. Based on in vivo observation, IC was further subjected to in vitro assays to estimate the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin-E2...\n\nMedicinal plants are the primary raw materials used in the production of medicinal products all over the world. As a result, more study on plants with therapeutic potential is required. e tropical tree Ziziphus spina belongs to the Rhamnaceae family. Biological reports and traditional applications including management of diabetes and treatment of malaria, digestive issues, typhoid, liver complaints, weakness, skin infections, urinary disorders, obesity, diarrhoea, and sleeplessness have all been treated with di erent parts of Z. spina all over the globe. e plant is identi ed as a rich source of diverse chemical compounds. is study is a comprehensive yet detailed review of Z. spina based on major ndings from around the world regarding ethnopharmacology, biological evaluation, and chemical composition. Scopus, Web of Science, BioMed Central, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer Link, and Google Scholar were searched to nd published articles. From the 186 research articles reviewed, we revealed the leaf extract to be signi cant against free radicals, microbes, parasites, in ammation-related cases, obesity, and cancer. Chemically, polyphenols/ avonoids were the most reported compounds with a composition of 66 compounds out of the total 193 compounds reported from di erent parts of the plant. However, the safety and e cacy of Z. spina have not been wholly assessed in humans, and further well-designed clinical trials are needed to corroborate preclinical ndings. e mechanism of action of the leaf extract should be examined. e standard dose and safety of the leaf should be established.\n\nThe antioxidant activity of the leaves and fruits of Ziziphus jujuba and contribution in some phytochemical characteristics was obtained. Phytochemical analysis was found that Ziziphus jujuba leaves and Fruits were loss on drying 0.85%, 0.65%, total ash values were 5.3%, 7.6% , Acid insoluble ash value were 2.9%, 4.4%, Water soluble ash value were 0.7%, 1.1% and Foaming index were 13ml, 12ml. Phytochemical screening was found that carbohydrate present in JFE and JFA, alkaloids were present in JLE, JLA and JFE, glycosides were present in JFA, flavonoids were present in all type of extracts, steroids were present in only JLE and protein and amino acids were present in JFE and JFA. JFE possessed higher antioxidant activity with IC50 value of &lt; 300 µg/ml among all extracts for both methods and higher inhibition found in DPPH method 96.32% and in ABTS method it is 98.68 %. Aqueous extract of Ziziphus Jujuba fruit (JFA) was exhibited excellent anti-inflammatory activity against COX-1...\n\nContext: Ziziphora clinopodioides Lam. (Lamiaceae) is an annual or perennial herb or subshrub widely distributed from the Mediterranean to central Asia and Afghanistan. In Xinjiang, China, the whole herb has been used in traditional Kazakh and Uygur medicines as anti-febrile and detoxicating drug. Aims: To characterize macroscopical, microscopically of the overground part of the Z. clinopodioides, explore and establish the macro-morphology, micro-morphology, quality and physicochemical parameters standards for this plant. Methods: Pharmacognostical and phytochemical investigations were conducted in terms of macroscopic, microscopic and preliminary phytochemical parameters. Results: The vegetable material can be identified by structural features of the flowers, structural characteristics of the stem, specific pale brown hesperidin can be regarded as identification character. This crude drug showed the characteristic physicochemical values like total ash (7%), insoluble ash (1.3%), water soluble ash (3.7%), moisture (7.5%). The ethanolic extract contained flavonoids, organic acids, alkaloids, and glycosides. Conclusions: Various pharmacognostical characters that observed in this study can be an effective supplement to further research of this ethnomedicinal plant. Meanwhile, the results of this paper deal with pharmacognostical studies on the Ziziphora clinopodioides in an attempt to mitigate the adulteration to the crude drug."
