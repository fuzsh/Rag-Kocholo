        "text": "The correction of ‘Zizyphus’ to Ziziphus has a curious consequence. The combination Zizyphus zizyphus (L.) Karsten would be illegitimate under present-day rules of botanical nomenclature, since the specific epithet would then ‘exactly repeat the generic name’. (Such ‘tautonyms’ are permissible in zoological nomenclature but not in the naming of plants.) However, Ziziphus zizyphus is legitimate, since the specific epithet is then not ‘exactly’ identical to the generic name."
