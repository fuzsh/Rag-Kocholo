Liu\n\nAbstract\n\nZiziphus Mill. is an economically important genus of the family Rhamnaceae having nearly 170 species with worldwide distribution whereas this genus is represented by 6 species (Z. rugosa Lam., Z. mauritiana Lam., Z. nummularia Burm.f., Z. spina-christi (L.) Desf., Z. oxyphylla Royle., and Z. jujuba Mill.) in Pakistan. Production figures are not existing for each species of this genus. Among all members of the genus, Chinese jujube and Z. mauritiana are of supreme economic importance followed by Z. nummularia. The Z. jujuba is native to China and is also found in adjoining Pakistan. The Chinese jujube (jujube hereafter) is believed to have originated directly from sour jujube and thus it represents a valuable source for the introgression of a wide range of useful traits for jujube improvements. Moreover, the jujube is one of the oldest cultivated fruit trees with evidence of its domestication dating back to ca. 7,000 years. Whereas Z. mauritiana is native to the subcontinent (India and Pakistan). In Pakistan, these species are distributed and are mostly found in every part of the country. Z. mauritiana is found in three provinces such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh province, and is grown on an area of around 5,425 ha with an annual production of 28,000 t. Whereas the Z. jujuba is mainly cultivated in northern areas including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, AJ & K, and Gilgit Baltistan, on around about 2,000 ha area with 10,000 t produced annually. Whereas, Z. spina-christi L., Z. nummularia, and Z. oxyphylla are found in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan Province. While Z. rugosa Lam. is mainly found in Sindh (Hyderabad). Ziziphus has a lot of promise as a cash and/or food crop, especially in the desert parts of northern and southern Pakistan, and its cultivation needs to be supported by national policy.\n\nCitation\n\nMuhammad, N., Zhao, Z.H., Yang, M. and Liu, M.J.
