These photographs were taken on a Ziziphus mauritiana [Bor] tree.\n\nTussar Silk Moths belong to the group of Emperor Moths which feature some of the larger moths including the largest – the Atlas Moth, my photographs of which are available at this link\n\nHere a female Tussar Silk Moth [the largest of the 3 seen in the photographs] has recently emerged from her cocoon loaded with unfertilised eggs. To attract males to fertilise her eggs, she secretes pheromones which the males detect with their sensitive feathery antennae from even a few kilometers away. Two males have arrived to mate with her.\n\nAlso seen is the nest of a Scaly-breasted Munia.\n\nZizyphus for ID : Mumbai : 250912 : AK-1:\n\nPictures taken on 14 November,2011 in Maharashtra Nature Park, Mumbai.\n\nA medium sized tree with small round green fruits.\n\nId please.\n\nZiziphus mauritiana Lam.

Hence Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. should be based on Mauritius.\n\nIpomoea mauritiana was described by Jacquin who again was a French and worked in South Africa too. I assume both name comes from Mauritius.\n\nLogically Mauritania should have been changed to latin as Mauritaniana!!\n\n… many thanks your thoughts; it helped me know mauritiana is based on Mauritius.\n\n“Logically Mauritania should have been changed to latin as Mauritaniana” … is the logic true in case of Mauritius? 🙂\n\nWhat I found:\n\nThis species was first described by the French biologist J. B. Lamarck, from a specimen in a botanical garden in Paris, but he did not state why he decided to name it after Mauritius Island. … Wildflowers of Israel.\n\nIpomoea mauritiana has following names:\n\n1) Mauritanian convolvulus … NPGS / GRIN\n\n2) Mauritiana Morning Glory … Plantilus … though Mauritiana here is just the epithet, not name of any place in world.\n\nand,\n\nmauritiana => refers to ancient Mauritania … V I R B O G A\n\nhowever,\n\nType Specimens\n\nT: ; ; Cultivated in Vienna from material collected in Mauritius … Tropicos\n\nThanks once again … taking it as based on Mauritius.\n\nSir Lamarck didnt colelct all plants from wild. People colelcted from different parts of the world and were transfered to Paris during French rule. Same as Linnaeus who never came to India but described plants from India. And same as Jacquin.\n\nDont mind my collect please. I am trying to find the second protologue !!! cant find anywhere…….\n\nindeed some authors described plants far from where the plants were found.\n\nThe gist of my query is knowing the place(s) on which the epithet mauritiana is based.\n\nWhile I was attempting to find it on the internet, I got mixed results and got confused.\n\nNow your thoughts helped me somewhat convinced that the epithet is based on Mauritius.\n\nIt actually doesnt state anything from where it went to Lamarck. Interestingly the first sentence says, Isle of France…. I imagine which Island it point towards!!!\n\nMany many thanks dear …\n\nAt least mention of “isle” of France.\n\nWhile Mauritius is, Mauritania is not.\n\nI hope we have similar clarification for Ipomoea mauritiana.\n\nYou may dig only during leisure.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius\n\nPlease check this. It mentions that “In 1598 a Dutch squadron under AdmiralWybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island Mauritius, in honour of Prince Maurice van Nassau, stadhouder of the\n\nDutch Republic. Later the island became a French colony and was renamed Isle de France.”\n\nWOW …. Excellent search. Thank you very very much. Thus epithet of Ziziphus mauritiana is very well confirmed to be based on Mauritius.\n\nA check on epithet of Ipomoea mauritiana to have some relation to Mauritius would be fantastic. Please help at your leisure.\n\nIt is interesting to read the discussions. Some unknown facts emerge….\n\nHave attached a relevant paper by the French botanist Louis Bouton (1799 – 1878) who worked extensively in Mauritius. It was published in William Jackson Hooker’s Journal of Botany, vol. I, in 1834. In his concluding remarks on the last page, he inferred that the name mauritiana is incorrect because no plant of the genus Ziziphus is indigenous to Mauritius.\n\nThanks for sharing the article.\n\nJust because a plant is not originally from a place on which the name is described, as in this case, Z. mauritiana not being originally from Mauritius, doesnt make the species epithet incorrect according to\n\nICBN, now called as ICN. Yes the only thing incorrect is the interpretation that it is indigenous to Mauritius. Same thing goes to all species named as indica or chinensis doesnt mean that it is indigenous to India or China.

In the context of the plant sexuality of flowering plants (angiosperms), there are two forms of dichogamy: protogyny—female function precedes male function—and protandry— male function precedes female function.] .\n\nZizyphus had protoandrous flowers, i.e., androecium develops to maturity first and after sometime gynoecium attains maturity, in simple words, there is a distinct delineation of male and female phase in the same flower as both anther and stigma dont mature at one time hence inhibiting self pollination.\n\nIn the flower above, the anthers mature first (during erect position as in the picture, which has white pollens on the anthers] but stigma remains immature, hence the insect will come collect pollens from the erect anthers but pollens wont be able to get deposited on the stigma of the same plant because the stigma will not be mature enough to let the pollen stick to it. Hence if and when the insect will visit another flower which has mature stigma, pollen gets deposited. In other words, pollen from one flower is avoided from getting deposited on the stigma of the same flower.\n\nThere are some other terms here which are useful: Geitonogamy: In this pollination of a flower with the pollen from another flower on the same flowering plant.\n\nXenogamy: In this pollination of a flower takes place by pollens from a different plant .\n\nRead following links for more knowledge:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herkogamy\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichogamy\n\n– I am sending some photos of the tree, flower and unripe fruits.\n\nPlace : Dombivli\n\nDate : 31.12.2010\n\nHabitat : Cultivated\n\nFruits & Vegetables Week: Ziziphus mauritiana, Indian Jujube:\n\nZiziphus mauritiana, Indian Jujube, Common jujube, fruits are eaten fresh, dried, candied or stewed.\n\nLocal names:\n\nHindi: Baer, ber\n\nBeng: Kool, ber, borol\n\nMar: Bor, bera\n\nGuj: Bor, bordi\n\nTel: Reegu, gangareegu\n\nTam: Elandai\n\n-Just out of curiosity.

There is another variety of Bor, and the fruits are much smaller and round.\n\nTree ID for SeasonWatch needed..One of two species sending..:\n\ncould you please help me to identify this tree for seasonwatch?\n\nIts very twiggy at base and leaves cover only the top. But it seems to be a\n\nnative variety, and birds love it in fruiting season..\n\nto me it look like Z. mauritiana\n\nIt is Ziziphus mauritiana (= Z. jujuba) of Rhamnaceae family. Called as ‘ilandhai’ இலந்தை in Tamil.\n\nThe fruits are edible (but beware of large, stone-like seed :).\n\nZiziphus jujuba Mill is not synonym of Ziziphus mauritiana as per theplantlist.org\n\npls see http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2470699\n\nTo me this tree is BER\n\nZiziphus jujuba\n\nDuring our Pre Commissioned Training in OTA Kamptee (Nagpur) its fruits were the only thing available to us to eat during short breaks. More than 10 varities of BER were there. These were the main food of Monkeys and Langoors residing there.\n\nPerheps attached key from eflora.org may help\n\nBut I meant Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. for which *Z. jujuba* (L.) Gaertn. is a synonym, as per GRIN.\n\nPlease check http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?42285\n\nHere are some contrdictions in theplantlist and GRIN\n\nDoes the plant has thorns? If the tree is unarmed (no thorns) then it is Z. glabrata and if the tree is armed then it is Z. mauritiana (Syn. jujuba). ( We have to clarify the contradiction on the synonym). I couldnt see thorns\n\nin the branch close up picture hence I reached a conclusion that it could be Z. glabrata (Z. trinervia). Please see the attachment.\n\nAccording to the plant list there are 2 genus; Zyzyphus and Ziziphus (http://www.theplantlist.org/browse/A/Rhamnaceae/) in Rhamnacae family jujuba kept under Ziziphus whereas, mauritiana kept under Zizyphus. Both are accepted as well. Any one has any clarification on this?\n\nLet us not banish ‘The Plant List’ like that. It is for the first time we have complete list of all plant species with accepted names and synonyms. Agreed, there are still a large list of unresolved names and few controversial conclusions, but I think trained taxonomists can sort these out, and moreover, the list is being continuous improved and we may have improved version soon.\n\nI agree … that we shouldn’t completely depend on the plant list. But, as … pointed out that is a great effort and we cannot totally ignore the same. I had gone through what ever literature available in our library and got to know that Z. mauritiana has stipular thorns whereas, Z. glabrata doesn’t have hence I reached my conclusion.\n\nTo clarify, the contradiction on synonym I referred the same flora books from our library and most of the flora says Z. jujuba is a synonym of Z.mauritiana (Flowering Plants; Biodiversity Documentation for Kerala,\n\nSasidharan KFRI, 2004 & Flowering Plants of Kerala, India, Nayar, T S et al (TBGRI), 2006 ).\n\nI had mentioned the link for The plant list because that is the* *best source available online now ( I proudly make a statement that when we compile our data ours would be certainly become the best source of flora reference online). The plant list is compiling by a group of taxonomists who are working from leading botanical gardens in different parts of the world, including Kew Botanical Garden where herbaria from world around is kept and well maintained for a long time, I believe. Further, I beleive that they are updating the database with several new publications.\n\nIf we feel that there are contradictions or corrections let us write them.\n\nZiziphus jujuba is a classical example of later homonymy often cited in the text books.\n\nThe common Indian Ber plant, Chinese-date or Indian jujube was first described by Linnaeus under the name Rhamnus jujuba a species with leaves glabrous above and velvety beneath. Linnaeus also described Rhamnus ziziphus a species with leaves having glabrous under surface, As it turned out to be Millers (1768) gave the name Ziziphus jujuba for this species, so that when Gaertn. (1788) or Lamarck (1789) made the combination Ziziphus jujuba based on Rhamnus jujuba of Linnaeus, it turned out to be a later homonym of a different species Z. jujuba Mill. The name Z. jujuba (L.) Gaertn. or (L.) Lam. for Indian Jujube had to be rejected and next available name Z. mauritiana Lam., continued to be used for this species.\n\nAgreed The Plant List does not list Z. mauritiana but lists both Rhamnus ziziphus L. as well as Rhamnus jujuba L. as synonyms of Ziziphus jujuba Mill., implying that latest (2010) taxonomic judgement treats the two species as synonyms. We may like it or not the whole World is going to follow this List, and I think we have no choice.\n\nThank you sir for the detailed clarification.\n\nBut the plant list have listed Z. mauritiana in the list, but as I have mentioned earlier the spelling is different for the genus ( http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/tro-50137113) here it is Zizyphus and then they mention that Zizyphus mauritiana doesn’t have any synonym. Further, there is yet another genus with a spelling Ziziphus in which they have included jujuba as Ziziphus jujuba with R. jujuba and R. zizyphus as synonym (http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl/record/kew-2470699).\n\nZizyphus is perhaps biggest goof up by The Plant List. Ziziphus and Zizyphus are same genus with correct spellings as Ziziphus now. Perhaps we will have to write to them about these mistakes.\n\nThe bark of this tree has irregular cracks on almost black trunk. After seeing this mail I read the account of Zizyphus/Ziziphus jujuba. it says jujuba has irregular cracks on almos black trunk.\n\nI never said that ignore The Plant List, no doubt they are doing the best they can do for the biodiversity of the plants of the world. I like the statement by .. written few days back that get the correct knowledge\n\nfrom wherever you get.\n\nI just wanted all of us to refer the literature and herbariums too, instead just depending on The Plant List.\n\nI also feel that there should be some Indian Taxonomists Group on The Plant List group to deal with Indian Plants.\n\nThanks Dear … for sharing yr views. What i understand is that there are two things, one is the plant list and second one is the regional flora.\n\nI would like to share one of my observation w.r.t. Ehretia sp..\n\nWhile we were discussing Ehretia sp. posted by …, …. has mentioned that “Kew Plant List treats E. aspera as synonym of E. laevis“.\n\nWhere as “Flora of Bombay– T.Cooke” treats these 2 differently, Ehretia laevis as E.laevis Roxb. and Ehretia aspera as E.aspera Roxb. Flora has also provided the keys for both.\n\nSo my understanding is, along with plant list, regional floras should also be reffered and it becomes all the more necessay when we are reffereing to some endemic sp.\n\nEarly flowering and fruiting of Ziziphus mauritiana was noticed during Oct. and November, from NBNP Garden, Anaikatti, Coimbatore.\n\nUsual season will be during summer (March to June). Any thought about the unusual flowering?\n\nIs this Zizyphus mauritiana:\n\nIs this Zizyphus mauritiana or different variety? Pl confirm\n\nFruits will be like this.\n\nWikitionary\n\n.\n\nAffirmative. This is Bor / Ber [Z. mauritiana] often seen with Tussar Silk moth cocoons.\n\nefloraofindia:”For Id 24072012MR1’’ shrub with thorns at Pune:\n\nJuly 2012 at Pune Kothrud\n\nKindly help Id this shrub ht about 4 feet, growing along the fence of a private society.
