        "text": "Introduction\n\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) include two parts, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC affected the superficial layer of all parts of the large intestine specially descending colon and rectum.11 Lutgens MWMD, van Oijen MGH, van der Heijden GJMG, Vleggaar FP, Siersema PD, Oldenburg B. Declining risk of colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: an updated meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2013;19:789-99. Incidence of UC is 1.2-20.3 cases and its prevalence is 7.6-240 cases per 100 000 peoples in each year.22 Economou M, Zambeli E, Michopoulos S. Incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease and its etiological influences. Ann Gastroenterol. 2009;22:158-67. The basis of the UC is genetically susceptibility to inflammation and also environmental triggers.33 Heydarpour P, Rahimian R, Fakhfouri G, Khoshkish S, Fakhraei N, Salehi-Sadaghiani M, et al. Behavioral despair associated with a mouse model of Crohn's disease: role of nitric oxide pathway. Progr Neuro-Psychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2016;64:131-41. These environmental factors include microbiological,44 Peterson J, Garges S, Giovanni M, McInnes P, Wang L, Schloss JA, et al. The NIH human microbiome project. Genome Res. 2009;19:2317-23.,55 Andreoli TE, Fitz JG, Benjamin I, Griggs RC, Wing EJ. Andreoli and Carpenter's Cecil essentials of medicine.

Elsevier Health Sciences; 2010. So, some treatments can be applicable to overcome these environmental factors. In addition, besides the cost of treatment, the impact of UC on quality of life is staggering.77 Cromer WE, Ganta CV, Patel M, Traylor J, Kevil CG, Alexander JS, et al. VEGF-A isoform modulation in an preclinical TNBS model of ulcerative colitis: protective effects of a VEGF164b therapy. J Transl Med. 2013;11:207. Therefore, finding effective and cost benefit treatment for UC is necessary.\n\nBefore each study for finding good therapeutic agents for UC, it is necessary to simulate the conditions similar to human UC in animal models. There are several models for induction of UC in animals such as use of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (7), dextran sodium sulfate,88 Jiang X, Zhong L, Sun D, Rong L. Magnesium lithospermate B acts against dextran sodiumsulfate-induced ulcerative colitis by inhibiting activation of the NRLP3/ASC/Caspase-1 pathway.

Inflammatory bowel disease: cause and immunobiology. Lancet. 2007;369:1627-40.\n\nUse of medicinal plants and their derivatives has an ancient basis. Ziziphus jujube is a herbal plant belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is one of the most important Ziziphus species.1212 Huang Y-L, Yen G-C, Sheu F, Chau C-F. Effects of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrate from Chinese jujube on different intestinal and fecal indices. J Agric Food Chem. 2008;56:1734-9. The jujube fruit contains many bioactive compounds, including triterpenic acids, flavonoids, cerebrosides, phenolic acids, α-tocopherol, β-carotene, and polysaccharides. Each constituent of the jujube presents some health benefits, thus making it a healthy food choice and also as therapeutic agent.1313 Tahergorabi Z, Abedini MR, Mitra M, Fard MH, Beydokhti H. Ziziphus jujuba: a red fruit with promising anticancer activities. Pharmacogn Rev. 2015;9:99-106. The beneficial effects of administration of Z. jujuba as alternative treatment in oral mucositis (OM) has been reported previously.1414 Koohi-Hosseinabadi O, Andisheh-Tadbir A, Bahadori P, Sepehrimanesh M, Mardani M, Tanideh N. Comparison of the therapeutic effects of the dietary and topical forms of Zizyphus jujuba extract on oral mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil: a golden hamster model. J Clin Exp Dentist. 2015;7:e304-9. The objective of present investigation was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Z. jujuba in experimentally induced UC in male rat as an animal model for human studies.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthical statement\n\nThe protocol of the presented study is approved by the Ethical Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. All efforts were made to prevent the harmful handling of the animals and also the lowest but statistically significant number of the animals was allocated in each group.\n\nFruit and extraction\n\nZ. jujuba fruits were purchased from local market and after genus and species confirmation by Botanist affiliated to Agriculture School of Shiraz University, were finely grounded by mixer. The hydroalcoholic extraction was performed according to previous report.1515 Mardani M, Afra SM, Tanideh N, Andisheh Tadbir A, Modarresi F, Koohi-Hosseinabadi O, et al. Hydroalcoholic extract of Carum carvi L. in oral mucositis: a clinical trial in male golden hamsters. Oral Dis. 2016;22:39-45. The antioxidant content of this extract was evaluated using ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) test as described previously.1616 Kazemipour N, Nikbin M, Maghsoudlou MT, Sepehrimanesh M. Antioxidant properties of extracts of Scutellaria lute-caerulea in vitro. Online J Vet Res. 2014;18:75-81.\n\nAnimals\n\nIn this study, 80 male Sprague Dawley rats with mean and SD of weigh of 200 ± 20 g were purchased from the Center of Comparative and Experimental Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. They kept under conventional conditions include 22 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 5% relative humidity, and 12/12 h light/dark cycles before the onset of the study for acclimation and during the study period. All rats were fasted for 24 h and then UC was induced by rectal administration of 1 mL of 3% acetic acid. Animals were randomly allocated into 8 equal separated groups and received different treatment after 24 h, based on the Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\nExperimental setup and treatments which used in this study.\n\nAt the end of the 7th day, all rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and samples from colon tissue were obtained and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue processing and histopathological slide preparation were performed according to previous procedures.1717 Panahi M, Karimaghai N, Rahmanifar F, Tamadon A, Vahdati A, Mehrabani D, et al.

Dietary Berberis vulgaris extract enhances intestinal mucosa morphology in the broiler chicken (Gallus gallus). Comp Clin Pathol. 2013;22:611-5. The histopathological sections were evaluated for severity and extent of inflammation, crypt damage, percent of involvement and regeneration.\n\nMeasurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) level\n\nBriefly, 500 mg of tissue was homogenized in 5 mL of 1.15% cold KCl. Then, 3 mL of 1% phosphoric acid and 1 mL of 0.6% tiobarbitoric acid were added to 500 µl of homogenate and shake well. After indirect heating at 100 °C for 45 min, the centrifugation was performed at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured in 532 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer.\n\nMyeloperoxidase (MPO) activity\n\nTwo mL of phosphate buffer contain 0.5% hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) was added to 100 mg of colon tissue and homogenized on ice for six times of 45 s. Then, 10 s of sonication and freeze by liquid nitrogen were applied for three times. Centrifugation at 3000 rpm and 4 °C for 30 min was performed and supernatant was harvested. 2.9 mL of phosphate buffer contain o-Dianisidine and 0.005% hydrogen peroxide was added to 0.1 mL of supernatant and after 5 min, 0.1 mL of 1.2 M HCl was added to tube to orange color was appeared. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 460 nm by UV-visible spectrophotometer and the activity of MPO was calculated using a standard curve.\n\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities\n\nThe activities of these two antioxidative enzymes were assessed using commercial kits (Biorexfars, Iran).\n\nInterleukin (IL)-1β\n\nThe colon tissue content of IL-1β determined by commercial quantities enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Biosource, USA) according to the manufacturer instruction.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData were expressed as mean and SD and analyzed using SPSS version 21. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with using Tukey as Posthoc test were used to find statistical significant differences (p < 0.05). GraphPad 6 was used for drawing the charts.\n\nResults\n\nEvaluation of damage and regeneration in the colon tissue showed that the severity and extent of inflammation, crypt damage, percent of involvement and regeneration in NC1 and NC2 were significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.05) but not statistically significant together (p > 0.05). No significant differences were detected between other 6 groups in all pathological indices include inflammation severity and extent, crypt damage, percentage of involvement and regeneration (p > 0.05) ( Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1\n\nComparison of histopathological indices of damage and regeneration between different groups. Significant statistical differences between groups in each index are indicated by different superscript letter (p < 0.05).\n\nComparison of MDA level as oxidative stress index and activities of two antioxidative enzymes, SOD and GPx, in colon tissue are presented in Fig. 2. As shown, the colon tissue MDA concentration in NC1 and NC2 were significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.05) but not statistically significant together (p > 0.05). The tissue MDA concentration in gel 20% was significantly higher than gel 40% and oral 3000 groups and significantly lower than all other groups (p < 0.05). Despite of the NC1 and NC2, the MDA level in oral 1500 group was significantly higher than all other groups (p < 0.05) but not significantly differ with PC2 (1.85 ± 0.04 µnol/L vs. 1.83 ± 0.06 µnol/L, p > 0.05). Lowest MDA level was detected in gel 40% group (0.86 ± 0.03 µnol/L) followed by oral 3000 group (1.07 ± 0.04 µnol/L) ( Fig. 2A). Changes in the activities of both SOD and GPx showed approximately similar pattern. This included higher activities of enzymes in all groups in comparison to both NC groups, highest and lowest activities of both enzymes between treatment group in gel 40% and PC2, respectively, and highest activities of both enzyme in response to oral mesalazine in comparison to enema asacol. Other differences and their significances are shown in Fig. 2B and C.\n\nFig. 2\n\nComparison of mean and SD of A, malondialdehyde level; B, glutathione peroxidase activity and C, superoxidase dismutase activity in colon tissues of different experimental groups. Significant statistical differences between groups in each index are indicated by different superscript letter (p < 0.05).\n\nComparison of inflammatory biomarkers of IL-1β and MPO activity in colon tissue of different groups are presented in Fig. 3. As shown, these two inflammatory indices were decreased in response to treatments in comparison to both NC groups (p < 0.05). The most declines were belonged to the gel 40% group (210.00 ± 22.47 pg/mL for IL-1β and 1.19 ± 0.05 IU/L for MPO) followed by oral 3000 group (318.20 ± 31.49 pg/mL for IL-1β and 1.37 ± 0.03 IU/L for MPO). Other values and their significances can be seen in Fig. 3A and B.\n\nFig. 3\n\nChanges of inflammatory indices in colon tissues of rats in different groups. A, IL-1β level; B, myeloperoxidase activity. Significant statistical differences between groups in each index are indicated by different superscript letter (p < 0.05).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Z. jujuba in 4 doses of 20% and 40% in gel form and enema route and 1500 mg/kg and 3000 mg/kg in oral route in acetic acid induced UC in rat model were investigated. Overall, stimulatory effects on the activities of SOD and GPx, decreasing effects on IL-1β and MDA level plus MPO activity and healing and regenerative effects in histopathological features were detected in response to use of plant extract. Also, enema route is better than oral administration in all effects and dose-dependent response was detected in both routes of administration.\n\nIn previous studies, different plants and derivatives were explored for treatment of UC. It has been reported that hydroalcoholic extract of Teucrium polium could increase healthy cells in the colon tissue, decrease the inflammation severity and resolve the inflammation of colon tissue.2020 Mehrabani D, Bahrami F, Hosseini SV, Ashraf MJ, Tanideh N, Rezaianzadeh A, et al. The healing effect of Teucrium polium in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in the dog as an animal model. Middle East J Diges Dis. 2012;4:40-7. Effects of different doses and routes of administration of hydroalcoholic extract of licorice for 7 day in treatment of UC in rat were investigated. It is found that these treatment decreased the intestinal epithelium damages, TNF-α, IL-6 and NO and increased SOD activity in dose-response pattern.2121 Allizadeh-Naeini M, Tanideh N, Zargari-Samadnejad A, Mehrvarz S. Healing effect of Licorice extract in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rat. Res Pharmaceut Sci. 2012;7:S837. Improving of pathological conditions of colon, increase of weight and decline in MDA level were seen in rat suffered from UC in response to strawberry extract in dose-response type.2222 Tanideh N, Akbari Baseri F, Jamshidzadeh A, Ashraf MJ, Kuhi O, Mehrabani D. The healing effect of strawberry extract on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rat. World Appl Sci J. 2014;31:281-8. Similar findings are reported by our group and other scientists for Berberis vulgaris,2323 Tanideh N, Afaridi E, Mehrabani D, Azarpira N, Hosseinzadeh M, Amini M, et al.

However, the reports about the beneficial effects of using of Z. jujuba in inflammatory diseases are scarce. Hydroalcoholic extract of Z. jujube can reverse oxidative stress induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and electroshock in experimental models of epilepsy in rats.2828 Pahuja M, Mehla J, Reeta KH, Joshi S, Gupta YK. Hydroalcoholic extract of Zizyphus jujuba ameliorates seizures, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment in experimental models of epilepsy in rats. Epilepsy Behav. 2011;21:356-63. Also, the beneficial effects hydroalcoholic extract of Z. jujuba as alternative treatment in OM as another inflammatory diseases was reported by our group previously.1414 Koohi-Hosseinabadi O, Andisheh-Tadbir A, Bahadori P, Sepehrimanesh M, Mardani M, Tanideh N. Comparison of the therapeutic effects of the dietary and topical forms of Zizyphus jujuba extract on oral mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil: a golden hamster model. J Clin Exp Dentist. 2015;7:e304-9.\n\nThere are several possible mechanisms for these observations. The most important of them is the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of UC. In UC, primary increase of free radicals and secondary hypoxic conditions and chemokines production induced neutrophils and mast cell migration to the colon tissue and increased inflammation and oxidative stress in this organ by help of arachidonic acid metabolites, cytokines and other chemokines.2929 Pravda J. Radical induction theory of ulcerative colitis. World J Gastroenterol. 2005;11:2371-384.Z. jujuba contains several polyphenolic compounds such as gallic acid, catechins, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, coumarin and coumaric acid.3030 Mahajan RT, Chopda MZ.
