        "text": "Ziziphus rivularis is drought-resistant and has attractive, glossy, olive-green foliage with variable venation, as well as an attractive grey stem. This is the only South African Ziziphus without thorns. It was quite sad for me, that when I was looking for specimens in Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, I found that one of the trees was defaced because some people had carved their initials into a branch. Unfortunately, what this kind of tree carving does, is to destroy the treeâ€™s beauty for as long as the tree lives. It also makes the tree vulnerable to harmful diseases and infections that enter the tree via the carving, so this is just a plea to people to not carve anything on our beautiful trees.\n\nZiziphus rivularis is a fast-growing, small tree or large shrub that grows up to 7 m tall, with a spread of up to 4 m. It is an evergreen to semi-deciduous, multi-stemmed tree. The bark is smooth and whitish, becoming dark grey in colour.\n\nThe leaves are glossy, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, with sparse hairs on younger leaves, but becoming hairless at maturity. They are simple, alternate and spirally arranged.\n\nThe leaves have distinctive parallel venation on both upper and lower surfaces of the leaf.\n\nThe inconspicuous flowers are small, yellowish and come in small, compact axillary heads that do not have peduncles (a stem supporting an inflorescence). The flowers appear in early to midsummer, from November to January.\n\nThey are followed by shiny, spherical, yellow fruits that ripen to dark brown. The fruits are solitary on each leaf axil, containing up to 3 seeds, in late summer, from January to May."
