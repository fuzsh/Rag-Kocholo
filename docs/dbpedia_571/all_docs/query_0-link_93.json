Locality not informed in Rossetto et al. (1969); ( Robbs & Peracchi 1972), Minas Gerais; throughout the Baixada Fluminese ( Robbs & Peracchi 1972), Rio de Janeiro; locality not informed ( Robbs & Peracchi 1972; Rossetto 1972), Piracicaba (in this paper, specimens deposited at the mite collection in ESALQ, USP), São Paulo.\n\nRemarks. Robbs (1953) reported symptoms associated to those caused by A. esculentus in Brasília , Distrito Federal, and referred to the causal agent as Eryophyes sp. (sic); Braga (1957) mentioned that infestation on this host plant was caused by Eriophyes hibisci Nalepa 1906 ; Robbs (1960) revised specimens, identified them as belonging to the genus Aceria and sent material to Keifer who described this species in 1966 as Aceria esculenti . This author emphasized that specimens were very close to E. hibisci ( Robbs & Peracchi 1972) .\n\nRelationship to host plant. Infestations cause irregular erineum pockets, resulting in deformed leaves ( Keifer 1966b). The galls, which appear on the green organs, sometimes obtain intense reddish pigmentation, peculiar to the variety of okra involved. The attacked fruits become useless for commercialization and, when the galls are located in the terminal sprouting, the plant growth stops. There is also the emission of lateral sprouting, which is also attacked, plants becoming unproductive. The damage observed in winter is greater, possibly due to less development of the plant in the coldest time of the year ( Robbs & Peracchi 1972). Rossetto (1972) did not consider this mite as a pest in the State of São Paulo.\n\nType host plant status in Brazil. Exotic, widely cultivated as vegetable ( Filgueira 2008; Flora do Brasil 2020).\n\n026 Aceria ficus ( Cotte, 1920) : 28.

( Moraceae ), Valinhos ( Carvalho & Rossetto 1968), locality not informed ( Paschoal 1971), São Paulo.\n\nRelationship to host plants. Mites can be found on both leaf surfaces, on the buds and on the sepals. They cause injury to the buds and leaves. Infested leaves can be rusted, chlorotic, or distorted ( Zaksevskas 1973). These mites transmit the Fig mosaic virus ( FMV), that causes as main symptoms: a leaf mosaic pattern, vein banding, ringspots, defoliation, yellow spotting on fruits, reduced growth and premature fruit drop ( Acikgöz & Döken 2003; Ishikawa et al. 2012).\n\nTransmitted virus in Brazil. FMV was reported in São Paulo in early 1970’s (A.S. Costa, in Rossetto, 1972; Zaksevskas 1973; Zaksevskas & Costa 1974; 1975).\n\nType host plant status in Brazil.

Locality not informed ( Rossetto et al. 1969).\n\nRelationship to host plant. Infestations cause leaf edge roll-upward giving an appearance of a thick border of the lamina ( Amrine & Stasny 1994).\n\nType host plant status in Brazil. Exotic fruit tree, widely cultivated in the country ( Lorenzi et al. 2006) .\n\n028 Aceria guerreronis Keifer, 1965a: 7 .\n\nPrevious genus assignment.\n\nEriophyes .\n\nType host. Cocos nucifera L.

On Cocos weddelliana H. Wendl. , presently referred as Syagrus weddelliana (H.Wendl.) Becc. ( Soares 2020) (Arecaceae) : Indaiatuba ( Flechtmann 1989), São Paulo.\n\nRelationship to host plants. In C. nucifera numerous colonies develop on the meristematic zone of coconut fruits covered by the perianth (bracts), causing physical damage that leads to necrosis ( Moore & Howard 1996). Mites can be found on coconut inflorescences during the dispersion process. Early damage caused by A. guerreronis infestations becomes progressively more visible as a triangular white patch next to the margin of the perianth; as infested fruits grow, the damaged tissue turns necrotic and corklike, sometimes with deep fissures. Area damaged may cover half or more of the fruit surface ( Howard et al. 2001). Infested fruits later become distorted and stunted, due to uneven growth, leading to reductions in copra yield ( Howard et al. 2001; Moore & Howard 1996). Aceria guerreronis infestations can also cause extensive premature fruit drop ( Doreste 1968; Wickramananda et al. 2007). A review on the status of A. guerreronis around the world and of bioecological aspects of this pest is presented by Navia et al. (2013a). In S. weddelliana mites develop in the apical bud of young plants ( Flechtmann 1989).\n\nType host plant status in Brazil. Naturalized palm tree ( Vianna 2020c), widely cultivated or disseminated in coastal and tropical areas in Northeast, North, Southeast and Mid-West Regions ( Lorenzi et al. 1996; 2006).\n\nAdditional host plant status in Brazil.

On Syagrus cocoides Mart. (Arecaceae) : “Fazenda Santa Elisa, Instituto Agronômico de Campinas”, Campinas (24°36’41”S, 47°53’23”W) ( Navia & Flechtmann 2002), São Paulo; on Syagrus oleraceae (Mart.) Becc. (Arecaceae) , Olimpia (20°43’53”S, 49°03’38”W) ( Bellini et al. 2005a), São Paulo.\n\nRelationship to host plants. Vagrant mites on the lower surface of S. flexuosa leaves and S. cocoides fruits, causing no apparent symptoms ( Navia & Flechtmann 2002). On S. oleraceae symptoms were not informed.\n\nRemarks. Slight variations in morphological characters were observed in specimens collected from S. oleraceae ( Bellini et al. 2005a) .\n\nType host plant status in Brazil. Native palm tree, endemic, occurring in Caatinga and Cerrado biomes ( Soares 2020) .\n\nAdditional host plant status. S. cocoides —native palm tree, endemic, occurring in Amazônia and Cerrado biomes ( Soares 2020); S. oleraceae — native palm tree, endemic, occurring in Caatinga and Cerrado biomes ( Soares 2020).

(2008: 2).\n\nType host. Caesalpinia echinata Lam. (Caesalpiniaceae) , presently referred as Paubrasilia echinata (Lam.) Gagnon, H.C. Lima & G.P. Lewis, considered as belonging to Fabaceae family (Lima 2020).\n\nType locality. Recife , Pernambuco, Brazil (8°01’10”S, 34°56’53”W) GoogleMaps .\n\nAdditional localities in Brazil. Brasília (in this paper, specimens deposited at the Collection of Plant Mites, Embrapa Genetic Resources and Biotechnology), Distrito Federal.\n\nRelationship to host plant. Colonies are found under a “patch of webbing” on the upper surface of leaves ( Britto et al. 2008). Infestations cause silvering on the upper leaf surface.\n\nRemarks. This species was described from protogynes and deutogynes and two forms of males (one resembling the protogyne and the other one the deutogyne) were found in the colonies under the patches of wax. This is the first example of a deutogynous eriophyid mite in tropical regions with two forms of males. Behavioral and social aspects in this species are remarkably interesting; only deutogynes build the nests, and were considered as the dispersal form ( Britto et al. 2008).\n\nType host plant status in Brazil. Native tree, endemic, occurring in Mata Atlântica biome ( Flora do Brasil 2020) .\n\n031 * Aceria jussieuae ( Corti, 1910) : 95.

Piracicaba , São Paulo, Brazil (22°42’30”S, 47°38’08”W) GoogleMaps .\n\nRelationship to host plant. Small erineal galls on leaves and leaf distortion ( Flechtmann & Moraes 2002a). It causes the formation of small hairy and whitish galls (erinea galls) on both sides of the leaves. Apparently, the damage is greater in shaded plants ( Moraes & Flechtmann 2008).\n\nRemark. Only known from the type host/locality.\n\nType host plant status. Exotic herb, commonly cultivated as an ornamental ( Lorenzi & Souza 2001).\n\n034 Aceria lantanae ( Cook, 1909) : 144. ( Amrine & Stasny 1994: 57).\n\nPrevious genus assignment.\n\nEriophyes .\n\nType host. Lantana camara L. ( Verbenaceae ).\n\nType locality. Central Agronomy Station , Cuba .\n\nRelationship to host plant. The mites cause large galls, consisting of very small green leaves, distorted flower buds and flowers ( Cook 1909; J.W. Amrine Jr., personal communication). Mites can also produce leaf galls ( Flechtmann 1973; Moraes & Flechtmann 1981).\n\nReports in Brazil. Nova Lima ( Moura et al. 2009), Minas Gerais ; Belém do São Francisco , Petrolândia and Petrolina ( Moraes & Flechtmann 1981), Pernambuco ; Piracicaba ( Flechtmann 1973), São Paulo.\n\nRemarks. Moura et al. (2009) conducted a detailed comparative study of histological and histometric characteristics during the ontogenesis of leaves and galls of L. camara followed by the infestation of A. lantanae . This mite is used as a biological control agent in countries where lantana is a noxious weed, e.g. South Africa ( Craemer 1993; 1996; Smith et al. 2010; Mukwevho 2015).\n\nType host plants status in Brazil.

Litchi chinensis Sonn. (Sapindaceae) .\n\nType locality. Pensacola , Honolulu, Hawaii, United States of America .\n\nRelationship to host plant. Mites cause a fine red brown erineum on the undersurface of the leaf, oftencurling the whole leaf ( Keifer 1943). In addition to shoots and young leaves, fruits and flower buds can also be infested and present erineum ( Alam & Wadud 1963). New shoots on the entire tree can be infested and premature defoliation has also been associated with dense populations ( Paul & Duarte 2011; Waite 2012).\n\nReports in Brazil.

Symptoms in Brazil have been observed on leaves, stems and young fruits ( Rossetto 1972) and were referred to as “tomato white fluff” ( Costa & Gonçalves 1950), which can be confused with powdery mildew infection. Young plants can be affected and decline; infestations frequently occur during the rainy season ( Rossetto 1972).\n\nType host plant status.

Mite infestation usually occurs in association with Fusarium mangiferae fungal infection ( Gamliel-Atinsky et al. 2010) and this interaction can cause shoot and flower deformation. Infested buds result in arrested growth and severe deformation in young trees ( Navia & Flechtmann 2000b). An excessive proliferation of leaves or flowers forms from attacked buds (overgrowth) and is more severe in young plants ( Moraes & Flechtmann 2008). For a long time symptoms were considered as caused by mite infestation, however it has been shown that they are not the causal agents ( Gamliel-Atinsky et al. 2010).Actually, A. mangiferae can vector F. mangiferae spores into the buds and the frequency and severity of infection increase in the presence of mites. Indeed this eriophyid species plays a role in the fungal epidemiology, however further research is needed to understand direct and indirect interactions ( Gamliel-Atinsky et al. 2010).\n\nRemarks. The male was described for the first time in Navia & Flechtmann (2000b).\n\nType host plant status. Exotic fruit tree, widely cultivated especially in tropical areas ( Lorenzi et al. 2006). Mango is of great economic importance for Brazil, due to high domestic consumption, as well as the high export rate. This fruit is still the most exported fruit by Brazil, and is consumed both fresh and processed in the form of pulps and juices. Though being produced in the entire national territory, mango plantations are mostly concentrated in the Northeast ( Kist et al. 2018).\n\n039 * Aceria megalops Flechtmann & Moraes, 2002 a: 3 .\n\nType host.

Colonies develop in the terminal buds of the cacao tree branches, causing atrophy, premature fall of the leaves and shortening of the internodes ( Nuzzaci 1973; Doreste et al. 1975; Nakayama 2019).\n\nRemarks. A redescription of A. reyesi based on type females from Venezuela and on specimens collected in different Brazilian states (Amazonas, Bahia and Rondônia) and other Latin American countries ( Costa Rica and Ecuador) is presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The intensity of the symptoms appears to be greater in unshaded cacao tree plantations or after a long period of drought, which can lead plants to death in more severe cases ( Doreste et al. 1975; Soria et al. 1991; Trevisan et al. 2008; Oliveira & Navia 2013; Nakayama 2019). The mite has been reported recently causing serious damage and plant death in cacao plantations in the state of Bahia ( Oliveira & Navia 2013) and in the bank of germplasm of cocoa, CEPLAC, state of Rondônia ( Trevisan et al. 2008).\n\nType host plant status. Native tree, not endemic, occurring in Amazônia and Mata Atlântica biomes ( Lorenzi et al. 2006; Colli-Silva & Pirani 2020).

Colonies develop at the leaf base, causing discoloration, curling or rolling, abnormal development of leaves and plant stunting ( Keifer 1969c; Jeppson et al. 1975). This species can transmit at least four viruses to a range of cereal crops- Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), Wheat mosaic virus (WMoV) (formerly known as High plains virus [HPV]), Brome streak mosaic virus (BrSMV) and Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) (see details in the review by Navia et al. 2013b).\n\nRemarks. On taxonomic assignment. This species was originally described by Keifer (1969c) from wheat collected in the former Yugoslavia. It is morphologically very similar to Aceria tulipae (Keifer) , which was first described from tulip bulbs originating from The Netherlands and collected during 1937 in California, USA ( Keifer 1938; 1969c). For many years, A. tosichella had often been misidentified as A. tulipae , been considered as a junior synonym; the latter species was supposed to also infest wheat (in addition to the Liliaceae ) and was considered to be the vector of WSMV (e.g. Keifer 1953; Slykhuis 1955). Further studies clarified that the species infesting grasses (described as A. tosichella ) is undoubtedly different from that infesting Liliaceae ( A. tulipae ) and the two taxa are considered as valid. However the name A. tulipae continued to be erroneously used for the eriophyid species associated with wheat until at least 1996.\n\nOn the complex of cryptic species. Based on molecular characterization presently A. tosichella is recognized as a complex of closely related species and in Brazil two well differentiated genetic lineages are present, including that one reported in other countries as an efficient virus vector ( Skoracka et al. 2012; Miller et al. 2013).\n\nOn the status in the world and in Brazil. Mites and their associated viruses can cause significant economic impact and these pathosystems have been of concern to cereal growers and researchers for decades around the world, especially in North America and Australia, and they continue to represent a challenge. In South America serious impact has been reported in Argentina (see review by Navia et al. 2013b). Among A. tosichella transmitted virus only WSMV was already reported in Brazil ( Mar et al. 2013), however no serious infections have been observed in the field. Up to now the main damage caused by A. tosichella is direct (leaf curling and plant stunting) and has been observed in wheat seedlings grown in greenhouses in breeding programs and/or seed production.\n\nType host plant status.

( Keifer 1944: 22).\n\nPrevious genus assignment.\n\nEriophyes .\n\nSynonyms.\n\nAceria tosichella Keifer, 1969c .\n\nEriophyes tosichella ( Keifer, 1969c) .\n\nType host. Tulipa sp.(Liliaceae) .\n\nType locality. Sacramento , California, USA (on bulbs imported from Holland) .\n\nHost plants and localities reports in Brazil. On Allium sativum L. ( Amaryllidaceae ): occurring in all regions where garlic is cultivated in the country ( Moraes & Flechtmann 2008); sub-middle São Francisco valley, Northeast Region including part of Bahia and Pernambuco States (Moraes 1981); Barbalha ( Santos & Lima 1976),\n\nCeará; locality not informed ( Arruda & Arruda 1976), Pernambuco; Campinas ( Chiavegato et al. 1968), Piracicaba (Vasconcellos & Barbin 1966), Tietê (Guirado et al. 2012), Botucatu (Oliveira et al. 2014), São Paulo.\n\nRelationship to host plants. In the type host the mite feeds between the bulb layers, scarifying and drying the surfaces ( Keifer 1938). Mites are also commonly detected on young garlic leaves, causing leaf rolling and chlorotic striae after which plants become stunted. Colonies can also feed and develop on bulbs, under the scales and on plump cloves on which withering and matt brown spots may appear ( Scalopi et al. 1971; Jeppson et al. 1975; Keifer et al. 1982). This species constitutes the only vector of Allexivirus in garlic (see Dabrowska et al. 2020), which commonly occurs in mixed infections; a total of eight species have been described in this genus: Garlic mite-borne filamentous virus (GarMbFV), Garlic virus A (GarV-A), Garlic virus B (GarV-B), Garlic virus C (GarV-C), Garlic virus D (GarV-D), Garlic virus E (GarV-E), Garlic virus X (GarV-X), and Shallot virus X (ShVX) (The ICTV Online (10th) (Report on Virus Taxonomy 2016).\n\nRemarks. Type species in the genus Aceria . On taxonomic assignments, see Aceria tosichella . On the economic importance, this eriophyid mite is considered one of the most dangerous pests of garlic mainly due to its action of transmitting allexiviruses, which can reduce yields significantly ( Dabrowska et al. 2020). Damage can occur during the storage of garlic bulbs ( Larrain 1986). Allexivirus spreads via propagation material and through this vector. The high rate of infection by allexivirus may be related to the greater difficulty of removing the species of viruses belonging to this genus, and also based on the infection and transmission of the virus by the mite during the storage of bulbs from one year to the other (Oliveira et al. 2014). On transmitted virus status in Brazil. according to Kitajima (2020) six of the eight known garlic allexivirus were found in Brazil by molecular detection- GarMbFV, GarV-A, GarV-B, GarV-C, GarV-D and GarV-X in at least six states ( Bahia , Distrito Federal, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo) ( Melo Filho et al. 2004; Fayad-André et al. 2011; Oliveira et al. 2014). Although this mite has not been reported in some of these states, taking into account allexiviruses presence, it probably occurs in these states. This pathosystem constitutes a key phytosanitary problem to garlic production in Brazil particularly if in mixed infections with other viruses, however losses have not been estimated ( Fernandes et al. 2013).\n\nType host plant status. Exotic herb, cultivated as an ornamental ( Lorenzi & Souza 2001; Flora do Brasil 2020).\n\nAdditional host plant status in Brazil.
