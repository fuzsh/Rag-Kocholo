        "text": "Zizyphia cleodorella Chrétien, 1908: 167; Meyrick 1925: 36; Mück 1985: 20, 163; Báez and García 2005: 87.\n\nExamined material.\n\nSpain, prov. Almeria , Sierra Alhamilla, 400 m, 1♀ 3/ 4.x.2022, leg. Tx. Revilla (TxR); prov. Almeria, Retamar, 25 m, 1♀ 3/ 4.x.2022, leg. Tx. Revilla (TxR); same locality but 15 m, 3♂, 4/ 5.x.2022, 4♂, 2♀, 16.x.2022, P. Skou leg. (MZH, ZMUC) .\n\nDescription (Fig. 1 View Figures 1, 2 ).\n\nForewing brown, costal side broadly grey. Along basal 1/3 of wing length at centre, grey spot varying from small, dark grey and distinctive to indistinctly delineated grey area blended with the costal grey area. Along fold white, longitudinal stripes, irregular in number and strength. Near apex from costa to apex, oblique, white stripe; before apex black spot. In the male genitalia (Fig. 3 View Figures 3–6 ) sacculus of valva separated from the rest, and terminating in a curved, sclerotized hook. Phallus short and broad, pistol-shaped with broad and bent caecum, with one long and another shorter cornutus, and near base comb-like dense group of spines. Female genitalia (Fig. 4 View Figures 3–6 ) characterized by broad ductus bursae, with short and broad, sclerotized antrum, ductus bursae otherwise membranous; on ventral side of ductus bursae a conspicuous sclerotization, three times as long as broad. Ductus seminalis basally bulbous and situated in posterior end of corpus bursae; corpus bursae with one small, star-shaped signum.\n\nBiology.\n\nThe larva and pupa were described in detail in the original description ( Chrétien, 1908), but the life history was only briefly summarized. The larva feeds during May on Ziziphus (probably Z. mauritiana Lam. or Z. lotus Lam.) ( Rhamnaceae ), afterwards descending to the ground to pupate. The adults emerge in June ( Chrétien 1908) and October. Mück (1985: 20, 163) lists Z. cleodorella from Ziziphus mauritiana in the Cape Verde Islands, without a detailed locality, but it is unclear if this was based on personal observation.\n\nThe biotope where this species occurs in Spain is a sandy area with narrow, mobile dunes (Fig. 7 View Figures 7, 8 ), within the semi-arid thermo-Mediterranean climatic zone with high atmospheric humidity, where extensive formations of Ziziphus lotus ( “azufaifo” in Spanish) occur, together with patches of annual grassland. Tamarix sp., Ephedra sp., Ononis sp., Thymelaea sp. etc. complete the markedly African botanical character of this landscape, distinctive of the Retamar area where Z. cleodorella occurs.\n\nDistribution (Fig. 8 View Figures 7, 8 ).\n\nAlgeria, Cape Verde Islands and Spain.\n\nRemarks."
