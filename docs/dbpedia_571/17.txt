Zizyphia cleodorella Chretien, 1908 is reported as new to Spain and Europe. The genus Zizyphia and the species Z. cleodorella is diagnosed and its separation from the closely related Z. zizyphella Amsel, 1935 is elaborated. The adult habitus and genital structure, and the species' habitat are illustrated. The systematic position of the genus is discussed. Because Orophiinae Lvovsky, 1974 is a secondary homonym of Orophiini Thomson, 1863 (Coleoptera: Ciidae), and Cryptolechiinae is considered here as being unrelated to it, the name Cacochroini Leraut, 1993 is reinstated as a valid family -group name as Cacochroinae within Depressariidae (Gelechioidea), with Eutornini Lvovsky, 2019, syn. nov. as a subjective junior synonym of Cacochroini.
