Emma Thompson, the double Oscar-winning actress, has married Greg Wise, her long-term lover and the father of her only child. The couple married during a downpour at their holiday home in Scotland.

Thompson wore a white dress and Wise wore a kilt. Despite the rain they laughed and joked after the ceremony at which their daughter Gaia, three, acted as a flower girl.

The 44-year-old actress once said that she did not see "the point" of marrying again after her divorce from Kenneth Branagh in 1994. But after her marriage to Wise, 37, she said: "This for me is heaven. It has been a wonderful day."

She then joked: "We'll need to get inside, Greg has got no knickers on." The wedding had been kept secret from everyone but their families and guests, who included Sir Derek Jacobi. Newlyweds Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes were invited but were forced to cancel at the last minute.

Villagers were given champagne as the couple arrived at the 17th-century Coylet Inn on the shores of Loch Eck, in Argyll, west Scotland. Sophie Thompson, the bride's sister, said: "There wasn't a dry eye in the house." A month ago the actress told of the couple's anguish at not being able to have more children.

Thompson, who won an Oscar for her role in Howards End and for her screenplay for Sense and Sensibility, the production where she met her husband, had been hoping to provide a brother and sister for Gaia but IVF treatment over a number of years had failed.

The actress, who has had two miscarriages and suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal imbalance that can cause infertility, admitted that she had given up hope.

"I would have desperately liked to have had more children and it's been a great agony for me. There's been an awful lot of grief to get through in not being able to get pregnant again, but there are thousands and thousands of women like me who can't have children."
