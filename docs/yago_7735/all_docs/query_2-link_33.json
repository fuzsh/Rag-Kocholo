        "text": "Strictly Come Dancing contestant Greg Wise revealed his wife Emma Thompson played a brilliant prank on him before sending him to do the show – by packing condoms in his suitcase in case of the ‘Strictly curse’.\n\nThe actor and producer, 55, wo is currently paired up with Karen Hauer on the show, was left red-faced when he was asked about Emma’s cheeky prank on Good Morning Britain on Wednesday.\n\nAlastair Campbell, who was hosting alongside Susanna Reid, asked him: ‘Greg, can we talk condoms?’, as Susanna held her head in her hands and Karen cracked up.\n\nGreg rolled his eyes and smiled as he responded: ‘If you must!’, as Alastair pressed: ‘Your wife helped you pack and put a couple of condoms in your luggage.’\n\nExplaining why Emma, 62, had packed those for him, Greg revealed: ‘My wife, as you know, is a great gag-master. As you know, the whole “Strictly curse.”’\n\nAlastair cheekily probed: ‘Is she going to count them out and count them in just to make sure they’re there when you go back?’\n\nThe term ‘Strictly curse’ was coined after several celebrity contestants ended their relationships during or after appearing on the show, with some of them even going on to date or marry some of the professional dancers they’d met while competing.\n\nGreg explained: ‘The whole Strictly curse thing, to put it into some form of perspective, send it off with a really good gag. What’s most bizarre about it, she said it off the cuff to someone that we didn’t even know on the way into production a few weeks ago.\n\n‘Because we are not on social media and we don’t do any of that, we’re sort of children in the forest in terms of all of this – you can’t say anything, ever, to anyone. That’s what we’ve learned!’\n\nEmma had told The Sun: ‘I am worried about the Strictly curse, very much so. I have put a packet of Durex into Greg’s good luck card. Just two.\n\n‘But you don’t know, do you? They haven’t got time for a lot of sh**ging, I hope, they’ll be so exhausted.’\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Tom Fletcher celebrates freedom with dad duties as he confirms Strictly return after testing positive for Covid"
