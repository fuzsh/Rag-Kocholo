In my case it’s pillows thrown on the bed, Amazon deliveries (which I am invariably not there for) and my pathological inability to remember to buy milk.\n\nAnd there’s something else: what if there were some grenade hurled during a routine marital flossing session? While I might be able to deal with generalised critiques such as “you can be profoundly selfish,” how do you get over: “I hate the way you chew”?\n\nNot only would you never be able to eat in front of your husband again, but that would stay with you to your deathbed.\n\nWith husbands, or indeed any close family member, isn’t the healthiest approach to keep day-to-day irritations buried, to allow them to mushroom like tumours within you, until some deeply inappropriate (usually public) moment when, out of nowhere and with a disproportionate level of vitriol, you’ll blurt them out?\n\nIf therapy works for Wise and Thompson, more power to them."
