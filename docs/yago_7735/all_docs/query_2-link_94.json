        "text": "Strictly Come Dancing fans have loved watching The Crown's Greg Wise shake his stuff alongside pro Karen Hauer over the past few weeks – however, if you're hoping that his wife, star of stage and screen Emma Thompson, might follow in his footsteps and take part next year, then we have some bad news for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWise, who became the third celebrity to be eliminated from the Strictly Come Dancing line-up this evening, has said that Cruella star Thompson is \"categorically\" uninterested in signing up for the 2022 show after watching him take part.\n\nWhen asked whether Emma Thompson was tempted to compete in Strictly Come Dancing after stopping by to watch him in rehearsals, Wise told RadioTimes.com in an exclusive interview: \"I can categorically say no.\"\n\nDon’t miss anything special.

They have performance anxiety but there's nothing they can do about it. It's a really hard thing to do if your partner or child or parent or whoever is out there doing it, it's terribly anxious-making.\"\n\nThe remaining 11 Strictly contestants will return to the dance floor next weekend for their Week Four performances, however Robert Webb's journey on the show came to an end a few days ago after the comedian pulled out due to ill health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues this weekend on BBC One.
