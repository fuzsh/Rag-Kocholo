        "text": "We asked the actor Greg Wise, 52, what his younger self would make of him today...\n\nI still feel like I’m having a rather lovely childhood. I spend a good chunk of the year at my cottage on the west coast of Scotland where I climb trees, kayak and swim in the river. I’ve built a treehouse, there’s a pool table, and because I’m over 18, I have built myself a bar.\n\nI recently had to go to the Edinburgh book festival and I realised I hadn’t had a shower for seven weeks; I built a sauna on the side of the river and on the last jump into the river you take a bar of soap with you.\n\nI spent a lot of time in the Northumberland countryside as a child, so my idea of bliss is great, wide-open space. Both my parents were architects and my older sister Clare and I were brought up with design around us all the time. On both sides of the family were fine artists; every space was filled with sculpture and paintings. I grew up with the idea that you could create. Today I love playing with bits of wood; I’ve got a lathe and I love turning things, making bowls and candlesticks. I like to be let loose on a big piece of machinery too but, just like when I was a kid, I still can’t read an instruction manual.\n\nWe lived in Newcastle and when it rained all the local kids would come around and play in our big dressing-up box – cowboys and Indians, going to the moon, and so on. Theatre is an extension of that. The work I’m paid to do as an actor is really play. An awful lot of people who work in any form of arts have to have a childlike quality. A lot of us are quite childish as well.\n\nMy parents wanted me to get a degree, so I studied architecture in Edinburgh for three years first. Although I never really wanted to be an architect, I’m thrilled I did it. I think everyone should do a year of architecture; it opens your eyes up to what is mainly really shoddy design.\n\nEarly in my final year I auditioned for drama school and ended up moving to Glasgow. I didn’t start earning until I was 25 – then after 18 months I decided to retire from acting. My closest friend, Simon, had drowned. I remember sitting opposite my agent, who was in tears, as I said I was giving up. I took myself off to Australia for six months and got my head together. I came back and I’ve loved working since.\n\nI’ve never worked a great deal. It’s not been a career so much as a series of choices that you make for the best reasons at the time. Although if I don’t say Sense and Sensibility [written by and starring Emma Thompson, Wise’s wife] stands out in my career, I’ll get divorced. That was an amazing piece of work and I met the love of my life. I wasn’t paid very much, though.\n\nMy parents didn’t have a terribly successful marriage and as a child I always thought “I’m not going to do this. It’s just horrible”. But we’ve been together 23 years, the Dame and I.\n\nAs parents we’re always told that the nuclear family is the best way to go, but Gaia, our daughter, has been brought up with so many people around all the time, of all ages. We also have an adopted son, Tindy, who has just married.\n\nThere’s really no justice or fairness in the world. You can make your own luck, but you could also be struck by a bus or get a life-shortening disease.\n\nIf the acting police came round tomorrow and demanded my Equity card I would gladly give it up. I’ve never been able to do one thing at the expense of others. I’m finding now that so many other things interest me, and these things take time.\n\nI tend to get up most mornings at half past four because I’m excited by every day. I’m thrilled when I wake up and think about what I can do. I’m sure that will change at some point, but I’m still able to climb mountains as well as I did in my 20s. In fact, I’m even better at it now because I rush less.\n\nI’ve got a lot of things wrong over the years, too, and I’m actually very proud of that. You develop a bit of wisdom from messing up.\n\nNot That Kind of Love by Clare Wise and Greg Wise (Quercus £8.99) is available for £7.99 plus p&p at books.telegraph.co.uk"
