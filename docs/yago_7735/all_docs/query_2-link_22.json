She was later admitted to rehab in 2017.\n\nShe spoke out about her illness for the first time with The Sun on Sunday, saying: \"Anorexia makes you really good at gaslighting people, making it sound like they're insane.\n\n\"My ­parents would say, 'Gaia, we heard you working out at 3am.' And I'd say, 'No you didn't, it was just the house moving. I was asleep'.\""
