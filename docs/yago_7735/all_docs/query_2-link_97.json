        "text": "SUPERSTAR actress Emma Thompson cheered on her Strictly star husband Greg Wise alongside their lookalike daughter.\n\nGaia Romilly Wise, 21, joined her mum in the studio as Greg made his live debut on the BBC show in honour of his late sister.\n\nAfter impressing the judges - aside from Shirley Ballas - Greg and his dance partner Karen Hauer headed upstairs to catch up with host Claudia Winkleman.\n\n\"Your wife and daughter are in the audience,\" said `Claudia as they appeared on-screen.\n\nEmma pulled a funny face as she mouthed: \"She's the wife and I'm the daughter.\"\n\nGaia threw her head back laughing as the audience cheered.\n\nClaudia added: \"Your wife is the one who persuaded you to do it. Are you grateful?\"\n\nGreg Greg, 55, who starred as Lord Mountbatten in Netflix drama The Crown, replied: \"Pathetically grateful, my love.\n\n\"I mean come on, what's not to love?\"\n\nEmma cheekily told how she'd given Greg condoms in case he succumbs to the Strictly “curse” and cheats with his dance partner.\n\nSpeaking tongue in cheek, the Oscar-winning actress, 62, who married Greg 18 years ago, said:\n\n“I am worried about the Strictly curse, very much so.\n\n\"I have put a packet of Durex into Greg’s good luck card. Just two.\n\n“But you don’t know, do you?\n\n\"They haven’t got time for a lot of shagging, I hope, they’ll be so exhausted.\n\n\"I am not going to the show every week."
