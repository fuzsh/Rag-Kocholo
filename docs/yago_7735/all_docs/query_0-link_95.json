        "text": "Actress Emma Thompson has hilariously broached the subject of her husband Greg Wise succumbing to the notorious 'strictly curse' by gifting The Crown star condoms ahead of his stint on the show.\n\nIt was revealed in Strictly Come Dancing's launch show Saturday night that Greg, 55, would be with partnering up with professional Karen Hauer, 39, as he arrived to greet her on horseback at a plush country estate.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nHowever, despite the curse causing countless past contestants to break up with their partners after taking part in the competition, it seems Emma has no fears of her hubby falling for his dancing partner.\n\nInstead, Emma has made light of the situation, telling The Sun: 'I am worried about the Strictly curse, very much so.'\n\n'I have put a packet of Durex into Greg’s good luck card. Just two. But you don’t know, do you? They haven’t got time for a lot of sh**ging. I hope, they’ll be so exhausted,' she added.\n\nThe actress noted that she will not be at the show every week adding that Karen is, undeniably, 'gorgeous.'\n\nEmma and Greg's love story began 26 years ago when the two first met on the set of Sense and Sensibility. The movie stars have now been married 18 years and share 21-year-old daughter Gaia together.\n\nGreg will officially step into his dancing shoes next week when he takes to the ballroom floor to perform his first routine of the contest, as the live shows kick-off.\n\nThe actor will be facing off against 14 other celebrity competitors and their partners before eliminations begin the following week.\n\nSpeaking on the launch night, Greg told the crew: 'My partner is the gorgeous Karen, which I’m thrilled about. Secretly I was hoping I would get her.'\n\nHe also spoke of his 26-year relationship with Emma, joking 'that’s why I walk like this now,' while he hobbled."
