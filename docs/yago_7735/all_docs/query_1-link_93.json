        "text": "IT'S fair to say that Emma Thompson and her husband Greg Wise are household names, thanks to their incredible Hollywood careers.\n\nBut they are also proud parents to their adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba, who has a remarkable back story.\n\nWho is Greg Wise's son Tindyebwa Agaba?\n\nTindyebwa Agaba is the adopted son of Greg Wise and Emma Thompson.\n\nEmma first met Tindy at a refugee council event where she offered to help after all his unimaginable experiences.\n\nAt the time, Tindy wasn't sure whether to trust Emma but she eventually tracked him down and invited him round for a Christmas Eve dinner.\n\nThe dinner, that took place in their £15million West Hampstead, North London home, eventually turned into regular stays.\n\nGiven his own room, Tindy would stay for weekends which would eventually turn into weeks.\n\nEventually, the Hollywood couple decided to \"informally\" adopt him - at the time when Tindy was eligible to make his own legal decisions.\n\nTindy shares Greg and Emma with their biological daughter, Gaia.\n\nWhat happened to Tindyebwa Agaba?\n\nTindy tragically lost his biological father to Aids when he was just nine years old.\n\nWhen he was 12, soldiers turned up to his village in Rwanda with machine guns to kidnap its children.\n\nThe militia rounded up Tindy and nine other children and marched them across unfamiliar bush for days.\n\nAs a result he was separated from his three sisters.\n\nHe then arrived at a prison camp where he would remain for three years - being radicalised, brainwashed and trained as a child soldier.\n\nAt 16, Tindy eventually escaped Rwanda after a charity worker from Care International helped him board a flight to London to claim asylum.\n\nAfter months of sleeping rough on the streets of Trafalgar Square, Tindy finally met Emma at the refugee council event.\n\nWhen did Greg Wise and Emma Thompson adopt Tindyebwa Agaba?\n\nIn 2003, Greg and Emma informally adopted Tindy - the same year the pair got married.\n\nHe is the eldest child of the pair and brother to their daughter Gaia.\n\nTindy's mum Emma previously revealed how she credited her son with her own personal transformation, claiming that he has “been part of the healing”.\n\nSpeaking to the New Yorker, she said: “I’ve been told I was a fierce and restless octopus.\n\n\"But they have three hearts and only live for two years.\n\n\"So now I’m in search of a more peaceful existence where I’m not so angry and my one heart will last a bit longer.”\n\nWho are Tindyebwa Agaba's siblings?\n\nSadly as Tindy was separated from his three sisters in Rwanda, he never saw them again.\n\nIt is not known if they are alive or dead.\n\nHis adopted mum Emma previously revealed he has a strong bond with his adopted sister Gaia, and the pair are very close.\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian she said: \"Gaia was nearly three when he arrived.\n\n\"He became her big brother very quickly – she adores him.\"\n\nEmma also revealed how Tindy had previously been to Gaia's school to teach her class Rwandan songs, and they love spending time together.\n\nSpeaking about her own relationship with her son, the actress said: \"It's complete bliss. He's serious-minded but very funny too.\n\n\"We laugh a lot. And we talk a lot – we go for long walks to chat, which is lovely.\"\n\nWhat does Tindyebwa Agaba Wise do now?\n\nIn 2009, Tindy obtained British citizenship.\n\nSince then, he also got married to his wife He Zhang.\n\nTindy has worked as a detective in London's Criminal Investigation Division and has a Master's degree in human rights law.\n\nHe spent over a decade working for human rights activism."
