        "text": "Strictly Come Dancing is officially in its second week as the celebs take centre stage on Saturday night (October 2).\n\nAmong the list of this year's contestants hoping to win the prestigious glitterball is Greg Wise.\n\nThe 55-year-old actor is famed for his role in Ang Lee’s 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility . He played John Willoughby opposite Emma Thompson, whom he later went on to marry.\n\nGreg has gone on to make a name for himself in the period-drama genre, starring in The Moonstone, The Buccaneers, The Riff-Raff Element and Cranford .\n\nHe played Lord Louis Mountbatten on The Crown in 2016 and most recently appeared in Military Wives in 2018.\n\nBut away from the big screen, he's married to Hollywood star Emma Thompson.\n\nThe couple initially met in 1995 while filming Sense and Sensibility , alongside Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman and wed eight years later in 2003.\n\nBut it wasn't exactly love at first sight.\n\nSpeaking on The Graham Norton Show last year, Emma, who's from Paddington, revealed that when the pair first met on the set of the Jane Austen period drama, Greg actually pursued Kate as he believed that they were meant to be together.\n\n\"Before he did the job, he went to see a friend of his who was a bit witchy and she said he would meet his future partner on the film,\" she explained.\n\n\"He assumed it wasn't me because I was married and quite a lot older than him so he thought it might be Kate.\"\n\nEmma continued: \"He took her to Glastonbury, and she was so bored, and he thought, 'This isn't going to work, who can it be?'\"\n\nShe added: \"Then things happened that probably shouldn't have happened, and it's been 25 years in May.\"\n\nIn fact, it was Kate who encouraged him to look towards Emma after they realised the two of them were not best suited.\n\nGreg said: \"[Kate] pointed out that we were right for each other and told me that Emma’s marriage was over.\n\n“It was all meant to be, just as my friend Helen had predicted.\"\n\nEmma was previously married to Kenneth Branagh for five years before they split, citing conflicting work schedules as the reason the relationship broke down.\n\nOscar-winner Emma, 62, is famed for her roles in movies including Cruella, Bridget Jones's Baby. Men in Black 3, Harry Potter , and Love Actually, among many more.\n\nGreg and Emma tied the knot in a small Scottish town of Dunoon after an eight-year relationship.\n\nThe happy couple is proud parents to two grown-up children.\n\nIn 1999, they welcomed their first child, a daughter called Gaia.\n\nEmma struggled to conceive again naturally which led to the couple’s decision to adopt their second child, a son called Tindyebwa Agaba Wise.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing fans were stunned last Saturday night as they spotted Emma Thompson in the audience with her daughter Gaia.\n\nThe actress was there to support her husband Greg who is competing in this year's series with professional partner Karen Hauer.\n\nAs the pair took to the dance floor to perform the American Smooth to Frank Sinatra's That's Life, the camera panned to Emma and her daughter as they cheered Greg on.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing airs tonight from 6:45pm on BBC One"
