        "text": "“We’ve written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film,” Emma told Mandrake at the premiere of Brideshead Revisited, at Chelsea Cinema.\n\n“It’s about his very peculiar marriage with Effie Gray.”\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress says the film will be an antidote to modern attitudes.\n\n“I think you need to go into the past to examine sexual mores to get clues about our behaviour now,” she says. “The so-called sexual revolution was probably inevitable, but with many revolutions mistakes are made."
