        "text": "Emma Thompson has laughed off the idea of husband Greg Wise succumbing to the ‘Strictly curse’ by chucking him condoms in a good luck card.\n\nThe iconic actress, 62, has been married to fellow actor Greg for the past 18 years after first meeting on the set of Sense and Sensibility.\n\nGreg - who played the young Lord Mountbatten on The Crown - was partnered up with Karen Hauer for this year’s Strictly Come Dancing series last night, arriving to greet her on horseback at a plush country estate.\n\nBut now that rehearsals are officially under way, Emma has no issues with Greg spending time with the Venezualan beauty. In fact, she’s fully in on the joke when it comes to the notorious ‘Strictly curse’.\n\n“I am worried about the Strictly curse, very much so,” Emma said according to The Sun .\n\n\"I have put a packet of Durex into Greg’s good luck card. Just two. But you don’t know, do you?”\n\n\"They haven’t got time for a lot of shagging,” she added. “I hope, they’ll be so exhausted.”\n\nGreg and Karen will perform their first routine next week as the Strictly competition officially kicks off.\n\nThey’ll be facing off against the 14 other celebrity competitors with their first routine, with the eliminations beginning the following week.\n\nSpeaking on the launch night, Greg told cameras: “My partner is the gorgeous Karen, which I’m thrilled about. Secretly I was hoping I would get her.”\n\nHe later spoke about his 26-year relationship with Emma, joking “that’s why I walk like this now” while hobbling.\n\nIn order to secure the show and keep it Covid safe, a number of adjustments have been put in place for the cast and crew.\n\nThis includes pre-recording all professional dance routines - which open each show - and limiting audience numbers.\n\nHowever, there’s already been trouble with one of the pros testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nA BBC spokesperson told The Mirror: \"A professional dancer has tested positive for COVID-19 however this didn’t affect recording of the launch show which airs this Saturday.\n\n\"We are following government guidelines to ensure the safety of all on the show.”\n\nStrictly Come Dancing airs Saturdays at 7.45pm on BBC One."
