        "text": "Dame Emma Thompson’s husband Greg Wise took Kate Winslet on a date to Glastonbury after he was once convinced by a psychic that they might end up together.\n\nThompson, appearing on The Graham Norton Show, explained how before they got together, Wise had been told by a psychic friend that he would meet ‘the one’ on the set of Sense and Sensibility, in which he starred alongside Winslet and Thompson.\n\n“Before he did the job, he went to see a friend of his who was a bit witchy and she said he would meet his future partner on the film,” Thompson said.\n\n“He assumed it wasn’t me because I was married and quite a lot older than him so he thought it might be Kate.”\n\nThompson was then married to her now-ex-husband, actor Sir Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor continued to tell then how Wise had taken Winslet on a date to Glastonbury.\n\n“She was so bored, and he thought, ‘This isn’t going to work, who can it be?’,” Thompson explained.\n\n“Then things happened that probably shouldn’t have happened and it’s been 25 years in May.”\n\nThe couple married in 2003 after eight years together and have two children: Gaia, 18, and Tindyebwa, 31.\n\nWhile Wise has told this story before, his version did not mention Winslet. In December, he said: “Before I started filming Sense and Sensibility, a witchy friend of mine said you are going to meet the love of your life and 25 years later, I am still with Em!”\n\nMeanwhile, Winslet married Jim Threapleton from 1998 to 2001 and Sam Mendes from 2003 to 2001 before marrying her now-husband Edward Abel Smith in 2012."
