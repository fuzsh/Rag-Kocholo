        "text": "Award-winning actress Emma Thompson has revealed that before she got together with her husband Greg Wise, he had a date with an A-List star that didn’t quite go to plan.\n\nEmma said her husband of 19 years took Oscar-winner star Kate Winslet out for the evening, but Kate was less than impressed with Greg’s choice of venue.\n\nThe Love Actually actress revealed: “He thought he was supposed to fall in love with Kate.\n\n“I think he took her somewhere spooky and wibbly-wobbly, like where there were lots of crystals, thinking, ‘Something is going to happen’ and it so didn’t. Kate was completely bored.”\n\nThe couple - who started dating after appearing in Sense and Sensibility together - wed in 2003 after eight years of dating and share two children, Tindyebwa Agaba, 36, and 22-year-old Gaia.\n\nEmma, 63, reveals that wanting to continue sleeping with the same person after 25 years is a “really great” thing.\n\nShe said: “I think to have slept with the same person for 25 years and still want to sleep with them is really great,” laughs Emma, who’s currently starring as Miss Trunchbull in the new musical adaptation of Matilda.\n\n“I think that is marvellous. My mother once said, much to my amusement, ‘I think the first 20 years are the hardest.’ When people talk about long-term relationships, I do tend to repeat that and say, ‘Look, it’s going to be up and down, OK?”\n\nEmma - who was previously married to actor Kenneth Branagh for six years between 1989 and 1995 - said watching Greg on BBC One show Strictly Come Dancing last year took years off her life.\n\nWhen asked if Greg - who was partnered with professional Karen Hauer on the BBC One show - had “inspired” her to “get herself on the dancefloor”, Emma firmly replied: “No, he took years off my life. Just the terror. Oh my gosh he worked so hard, he has no weight to lose and he lost weight.\n\n“Every time I was there I was just chewing the furniture when I wasn’t on camera. So it was quite a thing, it’s a big old thing.”\n\nGreg previously insisted Strictly fans would never get to see Emma on Strictly. He said: “I can categorically say no. No, she knows what it entails and I think that it’s enough that one of us has done it really.\n\n“I don’t think you’d even get her in for the Christmas special.”\n\nMeanwhile, it’s been 20 years since director Richard Curtis’s hit romantic comedy Love Actually was filmed and Emma says the movie owes its enduring popularity to the fact we can all relate to its themes of love and loss.\n\n“I think that we forget, time and time again, that love is all that matters,” Emma - who plays Karen whose husband Harry, played by Alan Rickamn, cheats on her in the film - said.\n\n“[It’s about] love and all its messiness and its unexpectedness, in that you’ll find love in the weirdest places.”\n\nREAD MORE:"
