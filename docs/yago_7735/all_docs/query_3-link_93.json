        "text": "Strictly star Greg Wise was gifted condoms by his wife Emma Thompson for a very funny reason as he begins competing in Strictly Come Dancing 2021.\n\nGreg Wise and Karen Hauer are one of the fifteen Strictly Come Dancing 2021 couples that were introduced on Saturday's Strictly Come Dancing launch show 2021.\n\nAlthough fans are delighted to see the actor compete in the show, many are worried that Greg Wise and Emma Thompson's relationship will fall victim to the Strictly curse.\n\nThe Strictly curse is the name that has been given to numerous celebrities who have fallen in love with their Stricly dance partner and left their real-life partners after competing in the show. This 'curse' has ended many long-term relationships and even a few marriages.\n\nEmma Thompson joked to The Sun, “I am worried about the Strictly curse, very much so. I have put a packet of Durex into Greg’s good luck card. Just two. But you don’t know, do you?\"\n\n\"They haven’t got time for a lot of shagging, I hope, they’ll be so exhausted,\" said Emma in a typically witty comment.\n\nEmma also went on to compliment her husband's dance partner and said, \"Karen’s gorgeous, she’s from Venezuela and is only 39.”\n\nThis 'curse' has affected Youtuber Joe Sugg who fell in love with dance partner Diane Buswell, Countdown star Rachel Riley who married and had children with Pasha Kovalev, and journalist Stacey Dooley and her dance partner Kevin Clifton.\n\nDespite there being many couples who have ended their relationship after their partner found love with their Strictly dance partner, Emma Thompson has made it clear that she is not at all worried about the curse.\n\nAlthough Emma isn't concerned about her 18-year relationship being in jeopardy, her husband revealed that he did have one major concern about competition in the show—his feet.\n\nThe actor told The Sun that he has been preparing his dance shoes after being advised by Bill Bailey to take care of his feet.\n\n“Bill was very useful. One of the things he told me is to get my patent leather ballroom shoes ready and wear them around the house,\" said Greg.\"He had a problem with blisters on his heel over the run.”"
