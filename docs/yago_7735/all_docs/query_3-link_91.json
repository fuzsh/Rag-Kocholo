        "text": "Emma Thompson has described the \"terror\" she felt while watching her husband Greg Wise perform on Strictly Come Dancing last year.\n\nWhile appearing on The One Show last night (Wednesday 25), the Matilda the Musical actress was asked by hosts Jermaine Jenas and Zoe Ball if Wise's stint on Strictly had encouraged her to take up dancing.\n\n\"Emma, your husband Greg was on the show last year,\" said Jenas. \"You were there as a regular watching him, cheering him on. Did he inspire you to get yourself on the dance floor?\"\n\nRelated: Why these pro dancers quit Strictly Come Dancing\n\nHowever, it seems it did quite the opposite, as Thompson went on to joke: \"No, he took years off my life. Just the terror. Oh my gosh he worked so hard, he has no weight to lose and he lost weight.\n\n\"Every time I was there I was just chewing the furniture when I wasn’t on camera. So it was quite a thing, it’s a big old thing.\"\n\nGreg was paired up with professional dancer Karen Hauer and was the third celebrity to be eliminated from the competition after he found himself in the dance off with Judi Love and her partner Graziano di Prima.\n\nThis year on the BBC dance competition, Hauer was part of a same-sex partnership with comedian Jayde Adams. Despite their huge entertainment factor, the duo were eliminated over the weekend from the 20th series.\n\nRelated: Strictly judge Anton Du Beke hits back at claims the show is a 'box-ticking exercise'\n\nSpeaking about her exit on It Takes Two earlier this week, Jayde admitted that she predicted that they'd be voted off the show.\n\nShe explained: \"I sort of knew. Craig [Revel Horwood] was quite deflated, which is always the kiss of death on this show.\n\n\"As soon as he was deflated, I just had a feeling and in between the main show and… the results, I just had this feeling this whole time.\"\n\nStrictly Come Dancing airs on Saturdays and Sundays on BBC One, while spin-off show Strictly: It Takes Two airs on weeknights on BBC Two. Both shows also stream on BBC iPlayer."
