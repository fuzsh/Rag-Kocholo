        "text": "Emma Thompson, 62, was married to fellow actor Kenneth Branagh when she met Greg on the set of the film Sense and Sensibility in 1995.\n\nThe couple’s marriage was reportedly on the rocks, and they separated the same year.\n\nEmma and Greg began dating, while Kenneth was seen with Helena Bonham Carter shortly afterwards.\n\nThe 62-year-old actor from north London is known for a slew of successful films such as Nanny McPhee, Love Actually, Harry Potter, and Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nREAD MORE: The Royal with most beautiful smile - and it's not Kate or Meghan\n\nBut of both actors, who has accumulated the most money over the years?\n\nThe eldest of the two, Emma is the richest.\n\nThe Tall Guy star has a whopping net worth of $50million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nThat’s currently equivalent to around £37million.\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nMeanwhile, Greg has a much lower net worth, having amassed anything from around $2million to $3million, according to celebrity sites.\n\nThis is equivalent to anything from around £1.5million to £2.2million.\n\nEmma’s net worth is huge compared to her husband’s, thanks to her successful career as an actor, producer, and screenwriter.\n\nA British icon, Emma was born in London to a Scottish mother and an English father.\n\nReceiving rave reviews for her role as Sally Smith, this proved to be Emma’s breakthrough role.\n\nBy the time Emma starred in Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of Henry V in 1989, the pair were an item.\n\nEmma continued to experiment with Shakespeare, appearing in stage productions of both Midsummer Night’s Dream and King Lear.\n\nAn incredibly talented actor, Emma won both the Golden Globe and BAFTA Best Actress awards for her performance in the period drama Howard’s End in 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Emma made her Hollywood debut in the blockbuster Junior alongside Arnold Shwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, and her success continued with the 1995 film Sense and Sensibility.\n\nEmma was hired to write the Austen classic, as well as acted in it, and was awarded a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress.\n\nSince then, Emma has made a name for herself as one of Britain’s greatest actors, with a career highlight being a part of Richard Curtis’ award-winning 2002 romantic comedy Love Actually.\n\nEmma’s most recent film was Cruella, released earlier this year, in which the actor plays the titular villain alongside Emma Stone.\n\nThe actor shares a £15million home with Greg in West Hampstead, north London.\n\nThe couple have two children – a daughter, Gaia, who was born in 1999, and an adopted son, Tindyebwa Agaba, who is a former Rwandan child soldier."
