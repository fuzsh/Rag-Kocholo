        "text": "Gaia Wise, named after the Greek goddess known as the personification of Earth, clearly inherited her mum’s sense of humour – but what else do we know about her?\n\nWhat does Gaia Wise do for work?\n\nRecently, Wise was cast as the English-language voice actress for Héra in the upcoming anime film, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim. “What I loved about Hèra is she’s fierce, she’s complex, she’s rebellious”, Wise told Entertainment Weekly about her upcoming role.\n\nShe was homeschooled\n\nAt 15, Wise revealed that she started homeschooling after her mum withdrew her from her public school because her peers at London’s Highgate School labelled her a “green hippy”, per British media. This was after Wise came back from a Greenpeace expedition to the Arctic Circle with her mother and started speaking out against climate change. Thompson said her daughter didn’t like the environment of a formal education that is much like a “sausage factory”, and she has “no argument with that”.\n\nShe struggled with anorexia\n\nIn 2021, Wise opened up on Instagram about her battle with anorexia and her health journey to spread awareness and offer support to others who may be going through something similar. She called anorexia “the most deadly mental illness that exists in humans” and gave herself a pat on the back for her dedication to recovery. She also told The Sun that at one point her parents had gathered all those she loved most to stage an intervention.\n\n“Anorexia makes you really good at gaslighting people, making it sound like they’re insane,” the young actress said. “My ­parents would say, ‘Gaia, we heard you working out at 3am.’ And I’d say, ‘No, you didn’t, it was just the house moving. I was asleep.’” Wise eventually agreed to go to rehab in 2017 after her dad said to her during the intervention that he didn’t “know where my child is any more”, which she said she’ll always be grateful for because “it saved my life”.\n\nShe is involved in breast cancer awareness\n\nOn top of being a climate change advocate, Wise is the ambassador of the Pink Ribbon Foundation, which supports those affected by breast cancer. In 2023, she designed a clothing collection with her stylist bestie Steve Vyse for the foundation under the label Mad Love London, the profits of which supported those who are battling the disease.\n\nPerhaps Wise’s devotion to bringing attention and help to this cause is because she had watched her beloved aunt, Clare Wise, battle breast cancer and later die from bone cancer. It was a traumatic experience that Wise told The Sun contributed to her anorexia.\n\nWho is Gaia Wise dating?\n\nWise is reportedly dating The Witcher actor Basil Eidenbenz. They were first linked in 2022 when they were pictured showing PDA at the opening night of Tango After Dark at the Peacock Theatre in London.\n\nEidenbenz is 31 and was born in Zurich, Switzerland. He was still appearing in cute pics posted by Wise to her Instagram earlier this year, so it seems the adorable couple is still going strong."
