        "text": "Emma Thompson married husband Greg Wise in 2003, after the pair first met on the set of Sense & Sensibility in 1995 (though Emma was married to her now-ex-husband, actor Sir Kenneth Branagh at the time). And though the couple got a happy ending to challenge those in any Jane Austen novel, it didn't always look like it might turn out that way.\n\nThe Nanny McPhee star has revealed that she initially thought he would marry Kate Winslet.\n\nEmma Thompson with husband Greg Wise\n\nDuring her appearance on The Graham Norton Show last Friday (24 Jan) she explained how – before they got together – Wise had been told by a psychic friend that he would meet ‘the one’ on the set of Sense and Sensibility, in which he starred alongside Winslet and Thompson.\n\nBefore he did the job, he went to see a friend of his who was a bit witchy\n\n'Before he did the job, he went to see a friend of his who was a bit witchy and she said he would meet his future partner on the film,' Thompson said. 'He assumed it wasn’t me because I was married and quite a lot older than him so he thought it might be Kate.'\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor then revealed that Wise had taken the Titanic star on a date to Glastonbury.\n\n'[Kate] was so bored, and he thought, \"This isn’t going to work, who can it be?\",' Thompson explained. 'Then things happened that probably shouldn’t have happened and it’s been 25 years in May.'\n\nWise has also previously opened up about the start of their relationship, telling the Express that it was actually Kate who suggested he should date Emma instead of her: '[Kate] pointed out that we were right for each other and told me that Emma’s marriage was over. It was all meant to be, just as my friend Helen had predicted.'\n\nLike this article? Sign up to our newsletter to get more articles like this delivered straight to your inbox."
