While reading a biography of the great Asa Buchanan, Jared first appeared on the scene, from a prison cell, as a mysterious man who stated an interest in looking up an old friend once he was released! We later found out that while Jessica was Tess, she set Jared up and sent him away to the big house!

Jared was involved in nothing but drama since the moment he arrived in Llanview! While pretending the be Asa's long lost son, he fell in love with Natalie Buchanan. Before they could come clean with his deception, Dorian Lord let the cat out of the bag, which lead to a confrontation with Nash Brennan, who later died as a result!

While attempting to rescue Natalie from being locked in Llanfair's secret room, by Tess, Jared found himself locked behind the soundproof walls as well. However, Charlie rescued them then the family pulled together to help Jessica deal with the past.

Not wanting to wait, Jared and Natalie married, and did their part to take care of Jessica's children while she was in St. Anne's. They later uncovered the fact that Jessica had switched the babies - and that Chloe was in fact Starr's baby Hope!

Just when life appeared to be calm again, after helping Jessica rebuild her life, and deal with yet another loss, Chloe, Jared and Natalie had a stalker on their hands, who was blaming them for Nash's death. Jared was even attached and beaten at Buchanan Enterprises - and made to look like the stalker!

In the end, the truth came out that Jared was being blackmailed to help stalk Jessica by Wayne Landers, through Mitch Laurence, who shot Jared in cold blood - and left Charlie feeling the guilt of Jared having covered up the fact that Charlie inadvertently killed Jared's stepfather while drunk.
