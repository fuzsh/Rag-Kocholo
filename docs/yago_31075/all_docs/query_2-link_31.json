I love it when people do weddings \"out side of the box\" and small weddings allow space for that. Tara and Jared invited all their family to spend the weekend on the Outer Banks with them to witness them exchanging their vows on the beach. They will have a big reception-like party with friends later.\n\nBefore the ceremony and dinner, Tara and Jared met me in Manteo for some pictures alone. They had a GORGEOUS day on the cost. These two are so much fun! The whole day was light hearted and full of love.\n\nHELLO! Tara's bouquet was super bright and beachy.\n\nOne of Tara's close friends from college surprised the couple by having leis sent from Hawaii for them to wear during the ceremony- Tara had always wanted to get married in Hawaii.\n\nMarried!\n\nEvery bride needs a bunch of cousins and a brother to watch out for them.\n\n\"I be at the cake\"...\n\nTara and Jared, thank you so much for having me come down to the OBX to be a part of your wonderful wedding day. I loved getting to know your families. Here's to an awesome first year married!"
