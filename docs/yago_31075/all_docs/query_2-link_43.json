        "text": "Brian Stacy Banks was born September 5, 1958, in Houston, Texas. He moved on from this life on November 11, 2023, in Austin, Texas surrounded by his family. His exuberant life will forever be cherished by those he loved.\n\nBrian moved to Lampasas in 1977, where he met Marianne Landers. They were joined in marriage on August 18, 1984, at First Baptist Church by their pastor, Mike Barnard. During his career they lived in Waco, College Station, Georgetown and Springfield, MO, before returning to Lampasas. Through their lives together they were blessed with four children and three grandchildren.\n\nBrian grew up in San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley, where his father served as a high school coach and administrator. He attended high school in Harlingen and Weslaco, where he played basketball and golf, and moved to Lampasas when his father became the superintendent of schools. He graduated from Lampasas High School in 1977. He continued to play basketball at Cisco Junior College and Tarleton State University, before transferring to The University of Texas at Austin when Marianne started college. Brian worked as a waiter and a bank teller during college. He graduated from UT in May 1982 with a Bachelor's in Business Administration in management.\n\nBrian enjoyed a career in human resource management, compensation, and information systems in university and hospital systems at The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Hillcrest Baptist Medical System in Waco, HCA Greenleaf Hospital and Texas A&M University in College Station, Scott and White Hospital and Clinic in Temple, and Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Missouri. Brian also worked as a human resource information systems consultant traveling to other states installing compensation systems software and assisting in payroll management.\n\nBrian continued learning throughout his life. He became a certified human resource professional, and received Master's Degrees in Health Care Management from Mary-Hardin Baylor University in Belton and Public Management from Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nFaith was always an important part of Brian's life. He participated in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at his high school, and rededicated his life his sophomore year. He was active in his local church in cities where he lived throughout the years. He served as a deacon and a member of the choir at First Baptist Church in Georgetown, where he and Marianne enjoyed participating in Christmas Dinner Theatre. He also served as a deacon, Bible study teacher, and Upwards Basketball coach at South Haven Baptist Church in Springfield, Missouri. He is currently a member of First Baptist Church, Lampasas. He remained a devout Christian his entire life.\n\nBrian played golf much of his life, until he decided it took away too much time from his family. He loved helping his daughters learn and encouraging them throughout their lives. Although he tried, none of them became golfing buddies, and instead he spent much time in ice rinks, on soccer fields, at basketball and volleyball games, dance recitals, cheerleading competitions, and many choir, band and orchestra concerts.\n\nBrian also had fun fixing up MGBs and owned one most of his life. In order to accommodate the family, he also owned several Suburbans, with the favorite one being driven over 450,000 miles between Missouri and Texas to keep connected with extended family while living away.\n\nHe enjoyed spending time with his family, cooking food, watching football, traveling, discussing history, and befriending anyone with spare time to talk. Friends and family have many stories of time spent with Brian while he was grilling, and enjoying the delicious food he prepared. Most of all he enjoyed sharing life in his kind and gentle way, and caring for the family he loved dearly.\n\nBrian is survived by his wife, Marianne Landers Banks of Lampasas, TX; daughters, Brianna Marie Barksdale and husband Steven Barksdale of Round Rock, Marissa Beth Banks Hardin and husband Dr. Casey Hardin of Iowa City, IA, and Aubrey Brooklyn Banks of Lampasas; grandchildren, Norah Marie Barksdale, Marlow Jane Barksdale, Crosby James Barksdale; mother, Margaret Jane Banks, of Austin; sister, Allison Johnson and husband Dan Johnson, of Pearsall; brother, Dr. William \"Bill\" Banks and wife Dr. Cheryl Banks, of Billings, Montana; brother-in-law, Glenn Landers, of South Pointe Vedra Beach, FL; sister-in-law, Paula Cantrell Landers, of Houston; nieces and nephews, Julie (Danny) Hubbard, of Jarrell, Tyler (Mackenzy) Landers, of Houston, Dr. Kristen (Dr. Jared) Beaver, of Billings, MT, Austin Banks of Cedar Park, Haley (Christian) White, of Grand Prairie, Jessica (Jose \"Gomer\") Rodriguez, of Dilley, and Emily Banks of Wake Forest, NC; great-nieces and nephews, Colton Hubbard, Hoyt Hubbard, Julia Rodriguez, Banks Beaver, Jayce Rodriguez, Jensen Rodriguez, Deacon Beaver, Aspen White, and Sunny Landers, and numerous cousins and friends. He was preceded in death by his daughter, Heather Elise Banks, and his father William \"Bill\" Eugene Banks, and his grandparents.\n\nVisitation will be held Friday, November 17, from 5-7 pm at Sneed-Carnley Funeral Chapel. A Celebration of his Life will be held at First Baptist Church in Lampasas at 2 pm Saturday, November 18, with burial to follow at Naruna Cemetery.\n\nDonations can be made to Lampasas County Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Naruna Cemetery Association, or the charity of your choice."
