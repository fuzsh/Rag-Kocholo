        "text": "When Bridget Davis got started in the familyâs payday lending business in 1996, there was just one Check ân Go store in Cincinnati. She says she did it all: customer service, banking duties, even painting walls.\n\nThe company had been established two years earlier by her husband, Jared Davis, and was growing rapidly. There were 100 Check ân Go locations by 1997, when Jared and Bridget (nÃ©e Byrne) married and traveled the country together looking for more locations to open storefront outlets. They launched another 400 stores in 1998, mostly in strip malls and abandoned gas stations in low-income minority neighborhoods where the payday lending target market abounds. Bridget drove the supply truck and helped select locations and design the store layouts.\n\nBut Jared soon fired his wife for committing what may be the ultimate sin in the payday lending business: She forgave a customerâs debt. âA young woman came to pay her $20 interest payment,â Bridget wrote in court documents last year during divorce proceedings from Jared. âI pulled her file, calculated that she had already paid $320 to date on a principle [sic] loan of $100. I told her she was paid in full. [Jared] fired me, stating, âWe are here to make money, not help customers manage theirs. If you canât do that, you canât work here.â â\n\nItâs a business philosophy that pays well, especially if youâre charging fees and interest rates of 400 percent that can more than triple the amount of the loan in just five monthsâthe typical time most payday borrowers need to repay their debt, says the Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit organization focused on public policy. Cincinnati-based Check ân Go now operates more than 1,100 locations in 25 states as well as an internet lending service with 24/7 access from the comfort of your own home, according to its website. Since its founding, the company has conducted more than 50 million transactions.\n\nWhat the website doesnât say is that many, if not most, of those transactions were for small loans of $50 to $500 to working people trying to scrape by and pay their bills. In most statesâincluding Ohio, until it reformed its payday lending laws in 2019âborrowers typically fork over more than one-third of their paycheck to meet the deadline for repayment, usually in two weeks. To help guarantee repayment, borrowers turn over access to their checking account or deposit a check with the lender. In states that donât offer protection, customers go back again and again to borrow more money from the same payday lender, typically up to 10 times, driving themselves into a debt trap that can lead to bankruptcy.\n\nJared and Bridget Davis are embroiled in a nasty court battle related to his 2019 divorce filing in Hamilton County Domestic Relations Court. Thousands of pages of filings and 433 docket entries by April 26 offer the public a rare glimpse into the business operations of Check ân Go, one of Cincinnatiâs largest privately-owned companies, as well as personal lifestyles funded by payday lending.\n\nThe company cleared $77 million in profit in 2018, a figure that dipped the following year to $55 million, according to an audit by Deloitte. That drop in revenue may have something to do with the payday lending reform laws and interest rate caps passed recently in Ohio as well as a growing number of other states.\n\nThe day-to-day business transactions that provide such profit are a depressing window into how those who live on the edge of financial security are often stuck with few options for improving their situations. If a borrower doesnât repay or refinance his or her original loan, a lender like Check ân Go deposits the guarantee check and lets it bounce, causing the borrower to incur charges for the bounced check and eventually lose his or her checking account, says Nick DiNardo, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati. After two missed payments, payday lenders usually turn over the debt to a collection agency. If the collection agency fails to collect the full amount of the original loan as well as all fees and interest, it goes to court to garnish the borrowerâs wages.\n\nThat devastating experience is all too familiar to Anthony Smith, a 60-year-old Wyoming resident who says he was laid off from several management positions over a 20-year period. He turned to payday lenders as his credit rating dropped and soon found himself caught in a debt trap that took him years to escape.\n\nTwo things happened in 2019, Smith says, that turned around his financial fortunes. First, he found a stable manufacturing job with the Formica Company locally, and then he took his motherâs advice and opened a credit union account. GE Credit Union not only gave him a reasonable loan to pay off his $2,500 debt but also issued him his first credit card in a decade. âI had been a member [of the credit union] for just two months, and I had a credit rating of 520. Can you imagine?â he says. Smith says he is now debt-free for the first time in 10 years.\n\nConsumer advocates say Check ân Go is one of the biggest payday lending operations in the nation. But knowing its exact ranking is difficult because most payday lending companies, including Check ân Go and its parent company CNG Holdings, are privately held and reluctant to disclose their finances.\n\nBrothers Jared and David Davis own the majority of the companyâs privately held stock. David bought into the company in 1995, but CNG got its game-changing infusion of capital from the brothersâ father, Allen Davis, who retired as CEO of then-Provident Bank in 1998. Allen sold off $37 million in stock options and essentially became CNGâs bank and consultant.\n\nBy 2005, however, the sons were part of a public court battle against their father. Allen accused Jared and David of treating his millions in CNG stock as compensation instead of a transfer from his ex-wife (and the brothersâ mother), sticking him with a $13 million tax bill. In turn, the brothers accused Allen of putting his mistress and his yacht captain on the company payroll, taking $1.2 million in fees without board approval, and leading the company into ventures that lost Check ân Go a lot of money. Several years of legal fighting later, the IRS was still demanding its $13 million. CNG officials did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nJared and David split $22 million in profit from CNG in 2018 and, according to the Deloitte audit, CNGâs balance sheet showed another $42 million that could be split between the two brothers in 2019. Jared, however, elected not to receive his $21 million distribution âin order to create this artificial financial crisis and shelter millions of dollars from an equitable split between us,â according to Bridgetâs divorce filing.\n\nWorse, she claims, Jared said they would be responsible for paying taxes out of their personal accounts rather than from CNGâs company earnings, making her personally responsible for half of the $5.5 million in taxes for 2019. She believes it wasnât happenstance that $5.5 million was wired to Jaredâs private bank account in December of that same year. Bridget has refused to sign the joint tax return, and Jared filed a complaint with the court saying a late tax filing would cost them $1 million in penalties and missed tax opportunities.\n\nâFor the duration of our marriage and to the present, Jared has full and complete control of all money paid to us from various investments we have made in addition to our main source of income, CNG,â Bridget wrote in her motion. She suspects that Jared, without her knowledge or consent, plowed the money for their taxes and from other sources of income into Black Diamond Group, the fund that invests in the Agave & Rye restaurant chain. Beyond the original restaurant opened in Covington in 2018, âthey have opened four other locations in one year,â she wrote, including Louisville and Lexington. (The ninth location opened in Hamilton this spring.) Agave & Ryeâs website touts its Mexican fare as âa chef-inspired take on the standard taco, elevating this simple food into something epic!â\n\nIn his response, Jared wrote, âWe have very limited regular sources of income.â He says he isnât receiving any additional distributions from CNG, the coupleâs primary source of income, âand this is not within my control. The company has declared that we would not make any further distributions in 2020 given economic circumstances. This decision is based on a formula and is not discretionary.â Agave & Rye helped produce $645,000 in income for Black Diamond in 2020 but has paid out $890,000 in loans, he says. Through August 31, 2020, he wrote, the coupleâs âexpenses have exceeded income from all sources.â\n\nThe divorce case filings start slinging mud when the couple accuses each other of breaking up their 22-year marriage and finding new partners. Jared claims Bridget began an affair during their marriage with Brian Duncan, a contractor she employed through her house flipping business. Bridget, he says, paid Duncanâs company $75,000 in 2018 as well as giving him a personal gift of $70,000 that same year. Jared says she also bought Duncan at least one car and purchased a house for him near hers on Shawnee Run Road for $289,000, then loaned money to Duncan. Jared says Duncan has been late in repaying the note.\n\nWhile Bridget says Duncan has been drug-free for several years, he has a rap sheet with Hamilton County courts from 2000 to 2017 that runs five pages long. It lists a half-dozen counts of drug abuse and drug possession, including heroin and possession of illegal drug paraphernalia; assaulting a police officer; stealing a Taser from a police officer; criminal damaging while being treated at UC Health; more than a dozen speeding and traffic violations; a half-dozen counts of driving with a suspended license; receiving stolen property; twice fleeing and resisting arrest; three counts of theft; two counts of forgery; and one count for passing bad checks.\n\nBridget has fired back that Jared not only is hiding his money from her but spending it lavishly on vacations, resorts, and high-end restaurants with his new girlfriend, Susanne Warner. Bridget says Jared gifted Warner with $40,000 without Bridgetâs knowledge, then declared it on their joint tax return as a âcontribution.â Bridgetâs court filings include photocopies of social media posts of Jared and Warner globetrotting from summer 2019 to summer 2020: vacation at Beaver Creek Village in Avon, Colorado; cocktails at High Cotton in Charleston, South Carolina, and dinner at Melvynâs Restaurant and Lounge in Palm Springs, California; getaways at resorts in Nashville and at a lakefront rental on Norris Lake ($600 per night); in the Bahamas at a Musha Cay private residence ($57,000 per night), at South Beach in Miami, and at a private beach at Fisher Island; in Mexico at Cabo San Lucas; in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Magenâs Bay and on a private yacht ($4,500 per night); in California at Desert Hot Springs, the Ritz-Carlton in Rancho Mirage, and Montage at Laguna Beach; and in the Bahamas at South Cottage ($2,175 per night).\n\nFor her part, Bridget has gone through some of the top lawyers in town faster than President Trump during an impeachmentâsix in all, two of whom sheâs sued for malpractice. She sent four binders of evidence to the Ohio Supreme Court, asking for the recusal of Hamilton County Judge Amy Searcy and claiming Searcy was biased because of campaign donations from Jared and his companies. Rather than deal with the list of questions sent to her by Chief Justice Maureen OâConnor, Searcy stepped down. Two other judges have since stepped into the fray, and in March Bridget filed for a change of venue outside of Hamilton County, arguing she canât get a fair trial in her hometown. At press time, a trial date had been set for June 28 in Hamilton County.\n\nThe poor-mouthing in the divorce case has reached heights of comic absurdity. Jared claims heâs âilliquidâ because he didnât get his distribution from CNG in 2019. Bridget has received debt collection notices for the nearly $21,000 owed on her American Express card and a $735 bill from Jewish Hospital. Thereâs no sign yet that anyone is coming to repossess her Porsche, which according to her filings has a $5,000 monthly payment. Each party has received $25,000 a month in living expenses, an amount later reduced to $15,000 under a temporary legal agreement while the divorce case is being sorted out. Court filings show that Jaredâs net worth is almost $206 million and Bridgetâs is $22.5 million.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Allen Davis was raising eyebrows at Provident Bank (later bought by National City), and not only because of his very unbanker-like look of beard, ponytail, and casual golf wear. He was leading the company into questionable subprime home loans for people with bad credit and a frequent-shopper program for merchants, though the bankâs charter barred him from getting involved in full-blown predatory lending practices. With guidance and funding from his father, Jared, at age 26, launched Check ân Go in 1994 and became a pioneer in the payday lending industry. Jared and his family saw there were millions of Americans who didnât have checking or savings accounts (âunbankedâ) or an adequate credit rating (âunderbankedâ) but still needed loans to meet their everyday expenses. What those potential customers did have was a steady paycheck.\n\nConventional banks share a big part of the blame for the nationâs army of unbanked borrowers by imposing checking account fees and onerous penalties for bounced checks. In 2019, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated there were 7.1 million U.S. households without a checking or savings account.\n\nThe Davises launched Check ân Go on the pretext that it would âfill the gapâ for people who occasionally needed to borrow money in a hurryâa service for those who couldnât get a loan any other way. But consumer advocates say the real business model for payday lending isnât a service at all. The majority of the industryâs revenue comes from repeat business by customers trapped in debt, not from borrowers looking for a quick, one-time fix for their financial troubles.\n\nOhioâs payday lending lobbyists got a strong hold on the state legislature in the late 1990s, and by 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray could rightfully claim in a campaign ad that âOhioâs [payday lending] laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans.â His statement was based on a 2014 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThe frustration for consumer advocates was that Ohioans had been trying to reform those laws since 2008, when voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative placing a 28 percent cap on the interest of payday loans. Butâsurprise!âlenders simply registered as mortgage brokers, which enabled them to charge unlimited fees.\n\nThe Davis family and five other payday lending companies controlled 90 percent of the market back then, an express gravy train ripping through the poorest communities in Ohio. The predatory feeding frenzy, especially in Ohioâs hard-hit Rust Belt communities, prompted a 2017 column at The Daily Beast titled, âAmericaâs Worst Subprime Lender: Jared Davis vs. Allan Jones?â (Jones is founder and CEO of Tennessee-based Check Into Cash.) In 2016 and 2017, consumer advocates mustered their forces again, and this time they werenât allowing for loopholes. The Pew Charitable Trusts joined efforts with bipartisan lawmakers and Ohioans for Payday Loan Reform, a statewide coalition of faith, business, local government, and nonprofit organizations. Consumer advocates found a legislative champion in State Rep. Kyle Koehler, a Republican from Springfield.\n\nIt no doubt helped reform efforts that former Ohio Speaker of the House Cliff Rosenberger resigned in spring 2018 amid an FBI investigation into his cozy relationship with payday lenders. Rosenberger had taken frequent overseas tripsâto destinations including France, Italy, Israel, and Chinaâin the company of payday lending lobbyists. In April 2019, Ohioâs new lending law took effect and, since then, has been called a national model for payday lending reform that balances protections for borrowers, profits for lenders, and access to credit for the poor, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. New prices in Ohio are three to four times lower for payday loans than before the law. Borrowers now have up to three months to repay their loans with no more than 6 percent of their paycheck. Pew estimates that the cost of borrowing $400 for three months dropped from $450 to $109, saving Ohioans at least $75 million a year. And despite claims that the reforms would eliminate access to credit, lenders currently operate in communities across the state and online. âThe bipartisan success shows that if you set fair rules and enforce them, lenders play by them and thereâs widespread access to credit,â says Gabe Kravitz, a consumer finance officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nOther states like Virginia, Kansas, and Michigan are following Ohioâs lead, Kravitz says. Some states, such as Nebraska, have even capped annual interest on payday loans. As a result, Pew researchers have seen a reduction in the number of storefront lending opÂ­erations across the country. Even better, Kravitz says, thereâs no evidence that borrowers are turning instead to online payday lending operations.\n\nCincinnati is one of five cities chosen for a grant to replicate the success of Boston Builds Credit, an ambitious effort that city launched in 2017 to provide credit counseling in poor and minority communities by training specialists at existing social service agencies. The program also encourages consumer partnerships with credit unions, banks, and insurance companies to offer small, manageable loans that can help the unbanked and underbanked improve their credit ratings. âRight now, local organizations are all kind of working in silos on the problem in Cincinnati,â says Todd Moore of the nonprofit credit counseling agency Trinity Debt Relief. Moore, who applied for the Boston grant, says heâs looking for an agency like United Way or Strive Cincinnati to lead the effort here.\n\nAnthony Smith is thankful that heâs escaped the downward spiral of his payday loans, especially during the pandemicâs economic turmoil. âIâm blessed for every day I can get paid and have a job during these difficult times, just to be able to pay my bills and meet my responsibilities,â he says. âIâve always kept a job, but until now Iâve had crappy credit. That doesnât mean Iâm a bad guy.â\n\nCan others worth millions of dollars say the same?"
