        "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between joint banking and relationship satisfaction. However, a recent study published in the Journal of Consumer Research in December 2023 is the first to show evidence that increasing financial interdependence can have a positive effect on relationship quality among couples. In other words, it revealed that joint banking can actually be good for a marriage, not just that joint banking and marriage satisfaction are related.\n\nThe paper, “Common Cents: Bank Account Structure and Couples’ Relationship Dynamics,” studied the banking practices of more than 500 married individuals over a period of two years and provided some enlightening insights into those practices, as well as how adopting a joint banking model affects relationships.\n\nDr. Jenny Olson of Indiana University, who led the study, told the MarketWatch Guides team that her research provided clear evidence of the impact of joint banking. Her researchers followed couples for two years, measuring relationship quality and financial harmony at six different time points.\n\nCouples who maintained separate bank accounts showed the normal decline in relationship quality over time, Olson said. But couples with joint accounts did not.\n\n“The differences in trajectories were so pronounced that by the end of two years, couples in the joint condition were significantly happier than those in the other two conditions,” Olson said.\n\nAs to why joint banking has such a measurable effect on relationships, Olson said that it mostly comes down to communication.\n\n“Having joint accounts affords an opportunity for communication,” she said. “Specifically, joint accounts come with greater transparency, meaning that both partners can see — and potentially comment — on account activity. Partners can set goals and monitor progress toward achieving them.”\n\nTo get better insight into why joint banking can be beneficial, we spoke to several financial experts from universities around the country. These experts were in unanimous agreement that merging finances is a healthy practice for couples in most cases.\n\nIn general, the consensus was that joint banking is a powerful tool for helping couples deal with financial issues that can make or break a relationship. Most also agreed that merging finances can have benefits beyond just practical financial issues.\n\nMoney Is a Common Source of Arguments Among Couples\n\nDr. Megan McCoy, assistant professor of personal financial planning at Kansas State University, told us that choices around money are often substantial issues among couples. Major points of conflict she’s seen include:\n\nHow much can we spend without asking one another?\n\nShould we have joint accounts?\n\nHow should we handle debt repayments?\n\nHow much should we spend on kids or other family members?\n\nWhat are our credit scores and what they should be?\n\nHow much should we devote to charitable giving each year\n\nHow much is “enough”?\n\n“Long story short, all big financial decisions have a big impact on relationships,” McCoy said.\n\nAnd any conflicts here can and often do have a detrimental effect on relationships, said Dr. Megan Ford, director of the ASPIRE financial clinic at the University of Georgia.\n\n“Ongoing financial conflict can definitely have a significant and eroding impact for intimate relationships,” Ford said. “Financial conflict is a reason often linked to why relationships end.”\n\nIn fact, financial conflict is responsible for the vast majority of divorces, said Dr. Edward Horwitz, Mutual of Omaha Endowed Chief Risk Officer at Creighton University. He said that research indicates that 80% or more of marriage dissolutions are due to money stressors.\n\nDr. Victor Harris, Associate Professor and Extension Specialist at the University of Florida, said that this stress boils down to issues of trust within a partnership.\n\n“Trust includes being able to depend on a partner to be dependable, responsible, and accountable,” he said. “When trusts are broken through financial irresponsibility or mismanagement, it harms the overall relationship.\n\nBut Ford points out that the outsized impact that financial issues have on relationships can also provide an opportunity for couples to align more closely.\n\n“On the flip side, when couples feel in sync about financial issues, this can actually serve to strengthen a relationship,” she said.\n\nExperts Tend To Recommend Joint Banking for Most Couples\n\nThese benefits – especially partners feeling in sync with one another on financial matters – are why the experts we spoke to all recommend joint banking as a practice, or, at least, having a discussion about it.\n\nJoint banking has some immediate practical benefits, like holding each other accountable for wasteful spending, McCoy said.\n\n“Joint account holders are less likely to buy wasteful items, such as a second fancy frappe in one day, that may be holding you back from reaching your goals,” said McCoy.\n\nJoint banking also allows couples to better share the responsibility of making financial choices around budgets and spending, said Dr. Jeff Dew, associate professor at Brigham Young University.\n\n“For married couples, one of the best financial decisions they can make to help their relationship grow is to decide to share financial decision-making power equally,” he said. “For example, when both spouses have equal say as they create a household budget, they will feel that things are more fair in their relationship. Also, when both spouses have equal power in making the budget, they will feel that they have an equal stake in making the budget work.”\n\nJoint Banking May Not Work For Everyone\n\nBut while academic research and the experts we interviewed agree that joint banking is often a beneficial move for couples, that isn’t always the case. Dew said that complicated finances and other circumstances within some relationships could mean that keeping finances separate is the more manageable banking setup.\n\n“There are always exceptions,” he said. “For example, if one spouse has some type of addiction — such as a substance abuse addiction or gambling addiction — then keeping finances separate would be important. Also, there is some research that suggests that those entering a second or higher marriage do better by keeping at least some of their finances separate.”\n\nEven in this scenario, Ford said that it’s important for couples to discuss it as an option, even if couples decide that it isn’t the right move for them.\n\n“Ultimately, this decision is not one-size-fits-all,” she said. “I encourage partners to weigh the pros and cons and land where they feel most comfortable.”\n\nOlson said that simply having a candid discussion about joint banking and other financial decisions can have a positive impact in itself, whether joint banking ends up being the choice couples make eventually or not.\n\n“I suggest that couples still have a conversation about whether merging is right for them and their joint financial goals,” she said.\n\nJoint Banking Helps With More Than Just Finances\n\nMerging bank accounts offers financial benefits for partners, such as improved financial discipline. However, the benefits of joint banking can also extend beyond a couple’s finances. One of the main areas in which that happens is in trust between partners, according to Horwitz.\n\n“Sharing the account information by reviewing the monthly statements can help provide transparency and can help to avoid feelings that one spouse or partner is keeping a separate account and hiding money from the other,” he said.\n\nIncreasing trust and transparency in the financial realm can lead to an increase in trust between partners overall, said Jared Hawkins, home and community extension professor at Utah State University Summit County Extension.\n\n“Mutually agreeing upon financial goals and staying faithful to those goals can signal commitment and trustworthiness to each other, which can enhance relationship security,” he said. “Additionally, couples who make wise financial decisions can better help each other achieve personal ambitions and work toward shared goals.”\n\nTo get a better understanding of how joint banking as a practice impacts relational health, our team conducted an extensive study into the topic. We looked at previous academic research, talked to some of the country’s foremost experts on personal finance and relationships and carried out a 2,000-person survey about banking practices and attitudes among married individuals. Survey responses were collected on January 22, 2024. The margin of error for the 2,000-person sample size was +/- 3%, with a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe information sources we used for this study include:\n\nCommon Cents: Bank Account Structure and Couples’ Relationship Dynamics; Jenny G Olson, Scott I Rick, Deborah A Small, Eli J Finkel, Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 50, Issue 4, December 2023, Pages 704–721\n\nInterviews with subject matter experts from major American universities (listed in the “Our Experts” section below)\n\n2,000-person survey of married individuals, comprised of 14 questions and conducted via Pollfish on Jan. 22, 2024\n\nOur Experts\n\nDr. Jenny Olson, Assistant Professor of Marketing at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business\n\nDr. Jenny Olson is an assistant professor of marketing at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business.
