        "text": "West Ridge won 13 of 15 matches and split the two others in claiming the Sullivan County Cup in a two-day event this week at Tri-Cities Golf Club and Warriors Path Golf Course.\n\nFor the Wolves and Lady Wolves, itâs a solid step for the young programs.\n\nâWe are just building,â said West Ridge coach Lacie Lowe. âEverybody is getting better, itâs fun to watch.â\n\nSenior Wyatt Cochran, an all-conference selection who missed a state tournament berth by two strokes last season, is back to lead the Wolves along with Jayden Foster, Bo McGee, Fletcher Henritze and Cale Creech.\n\nâTo beat the better teams you have to have a good four and a good fifth helps, too,â noted Lowe. âThey are all getting better and we are going to depend on them.â\n\nOn the girlsâ side, promising freshman Daisy Kizer leads the way with vastly improved Ashlyn Chesser.\n\nâDaisy is legit and Ashlyn has gotten a lot better over the winter and summer,â Lowe said.\n\nThe conference golf tournament looms in just three weeks (August 28), back at Warriors. Then itâs nearly a month before the District Tournament at Crockett Ridge (September 23) and Region Tournament at Ridgefields (September 30)."
