        "text": "CEDAR CITY — A vehicle fire near Brian Head on Wednesday afternoon prompted the closure of state Route 143 for approximately 90 minutes, authorities said.\n\nDeputy Marshal Jared Burton of Brian Head Public Safety said the initial call about the incident came in at noon.\n\nResponders arrived on scene, which was near mile marker 13 on the ridge just below the “S” curve, to find a black Dodge Ram pickup in flames.\n\nBrian Head Fire personnel were able to extinguish the blaze. Although the fire completely destroyed the truck, it did not spread to the attached flatbed trailer that was loaded with construction materials.\n\nBoth men inside the truck were reportedly able to exit and get away safely. No injuries were reported, Burton said.\n\nThe incident, which was handled entirely by Brian Head Public Safety personnel, caused the closure of SR-143 in both directions until just after 1:30 p.m., when the scene was cleared and the road was reopened again.\n\nBurton said it marked at least the fourth such incident that has occurred this summer. Each of the fires have involved pickup trucks pulling trailers up the steep incline, which ranges from 11-13% in grade in the area surrounding the “S” curve about a mile or so north of town.\n\nBurton said there have also been a few other recent incidents involving larger trucks, including one involving a semi pulling a double trailer that got stuck on the tight bend of the “S” curve and another one where a construction vehicle tipped over just above the “S” on July 25.\n\nBurton recommended that drivers check to make sure their vehicles are not overloaded before attempting to navigate any steep incline. It’s also a good idea to check to see if any safety recalls have been issued by the manufacturer. Over the past couple of years, certain late-model Ram pickup trucks have been recalled due to potential fire hazards involving the transmission dipstick and/or ​​electrical connector issues.\n\nThis report is based on information provided by law enforcement and may not contain the full scope of findings. Also, note that the vehicles involved in any of the incidents mentioned may or may not have been included in a recommended recall.\n\nCopyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2024, all rights reserved."
