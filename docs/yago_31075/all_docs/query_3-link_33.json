        "text": "Natalie Buchanan\n\nEvent + wedding planner,\n\nWedding + funeral celebrant\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHi there! I'm Nat, and I wear a few hats—I'm a wedding and event planner, as well as a wedding and funeral celebrant. With 18 years of wedding and event planning and 6 years of celebrant experience under my belt, I've had the joy of guiding many couples through their big days and helping families honor their loved ones.\n\nI have a passion for organising, thinking outside the square, and bringing creative and exciting ideas to life. There is nothing more fulfilling than seeing my clients have the best day of their lives and knowing that I had a hand it making that happen for them!\n\nI am a warm, open and compassionate person with a calm approach to life. I’m partial to a good chat, a to-do list, and a nice glass of red. I’m a Mum to two awesome little people, and through EventZen I am following my dream of running a business from home that allows me to create amazing events for wonderful people.\n\n​\n\nI am all about connection, authenticity and communication! ​Organising any event can be completely overwhelming, especially if being organised isn’t your forte or if you are really busy with other responsibilities.\n\nThe stress we can put on ourselves is remarkable!! I think it’s awful for people to feel such huge levels of stress or worry while trying to create an experience that is fun and interesting! I want to take that stress away from my clients and help them to actually enjoy and be present in the process.\n\n​\n\n​I am committed to helping people and believe that big life moments are what truly matter. As a funeral celebrant and a funeral director in association with wonderful Picaluna Funerals, I aim to guide people through difficult times with love and compassion, honoring and celebrating their loved ones.\n\nAs an wedding and event planner, with a corporate event background, I have over 18 years experience managing a range of events including weddings, birthdays, warehouse parties, incentive events, festivals, fundraisers, conferences, awards ceremonies and gala dinners for hundreds of people.\n\n​\n\nI love what I do, I’ve been doing it a long time now and I’m on a mission to help people to enjoy life by creating long lasting memories! Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to possibly working with you to create something truly special.\n\n​\n\nWarmest Regards,\n\n​\n\nNat\n\n​"
