        "text": "BLOUNTVILLE, Tenn. â For the first time in the three-year history of the revamped Tri-Cities Christian football program, the Eagles pass the eye test.\n\nPerhaps not in terms of overall numbers, but certainly in strength and physicality.\n\nâSince last season, weâve been able to play a lot of 7-on-7 all over the East coast,â said Jeremy Bosken. âWeâve spent a lot of time in the weight room. A lot of those kids have been on the powerlifting team this offseason that sent several to nationals in Baton Rouge. Weâve physically different and we are very excited about it.â\n\nBosken has overseen the program from square one when the slate was clear. The third-year coach says itâs taken a world of trouble, a world of tears and a long time to get here.\n\nâProfessionally, itâs probably the hardest thing Iâve ever done in my life,â Bosken explained. âWe started three years ago and we didnât have a helmet, didnât have shoulder pads. That first year we played six games and went 1-5. With 14 kids on the roster, we took our licks but we battled and finished the season and that was part of the goal.â\n\nLast year, the roster nearly doubled and the Eagle win total soared to six, including a four-game regular season-ending four game winning streak that sent the program to its first-ever national playoff.\n\nâWe went down to Alabama and got a great experience, but lost in the first round to the Freedom Cowboys (56-32),â noted Bosken.\n\nAlabama was one of several states visited by the nomadic Eagles as part of their challenging 2023 slate.\n\nâWe spent a lot of time in hotels,â smiled Bosken. âA lot of walkthroughs in Cracker Barrel parking lots. It was a good time, those road trips together.â\n\nTri-Cities Christian figures to log only 900 miles this season as the schedule includes six home games as well as a game against rival Providence Academy at ETSU, one of three 11-man contests on the schedule.\n\nThe Eagles defeated the Knights, 41-14, in its only 11-man contest last year.\n\nBosken says Tri-Cities Christian is still on track for full TSSAA membership in 2026-27, but there is momentum to classify eight-man football as an emerging sport next year.\n\nâWeâve just kind of been a guinea pig for them to show them that this is a great option for programs that are building from scratch or rebuilding because numbers are low, or theyâre just a small school,â explained Bosken.\n\nAlready, all the eight-man programs in the state have formed a conference and the Tennessee Athletic Coaches Association (TACA) is sponsoring a state championship playoff for the first time.\n\nâWe are excited to compete for a state championship,â added Bosken. âThatâs clearly our goal.â"
