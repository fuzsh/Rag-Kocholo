        "text": "Friday, January 16, 2009 1:26 AM ET | By Errol Lewis\n\n(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — While America gets ready for a change on Tuesday, January 20, when Senator Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th President of the United States of America, fans of daytime drama shifted this weeks Top 10 results into anyone’s favor.\n\nIn its second week out, the SON Top 10 recorded a record 1,350 total votes. This is a 40% increase in votes over last week. Additionally, 2,579 votes were cast for 124 daytime actresses and 2,509 votes were cast for 117 daytime actors. 2,554 votes were cast for daytime’s most popular couples.\n\nHolding onto the Top Actor title for the second week in a row, “General Hospital’s” Steve Burton (Jason Morgan) held a commanding lead over his nearest competitor, “All My Children’s” Thorsten Kaye (Zach Slater). The actor had a 352% vote lead over Kaye. As one-half of two popular pairings, it’s no surprise that Burton is well worth the airtime he receives on the daytime drama series.\n\nJumping from 2nd place to first, “General Hospital’s” Rebecca Herbst (Elizabeth Webber) unseats co-star Kimberly McCullough (Robin Scorpio) as Top Actress. McCullough fell to fourth place. Also on the rise, “Guiding Light’s” Kim Zimmer (Reva Shayne Lewis) rose from 5th to 3rd. This is the highest ranking for a non-“GH” actress. “The Young and the Restless'” Sharon Case (Sharon Newman Abbott) delivered a powerful punch as the actress jumped to 7th place from 21st last week. The actress received an 81% spike in votes week-to-week. By comparison, “One Life to Live’s” Susan Haskell (Marty Saybrooke) fell from 10th to 26th place week-to-week.\n\n“General Hospital’s” Elizabeth Webber and Jason Morgan are daytime’s Top Couple for the week after placing third the week prior. Fellow “GH’ers” Maxie Jones and Damian Spinelli received a significant spike in ranking as they placed 10th. Previously they ranked just out of the Just Missed list in 23rd place. Showing the largest gain in any category, “One Life to Live’s” Natalie Buchanan and Jared Banks jump 24 spots from 33rd place to 9th. Last week’s top couple, Robin Scorpio and Patrick Drake, fell from the top to 6th. Rounding out the list was Sharon Newman Abbott and Nicholas Newman of “The Young and the Restless,” who went from 13th to 7th and “Days of our Lives” duo Sami Brady and EJ Wells who fell a notch to place 8th.\n\nAfter fighting it out with “The Young and the Restless” in last week’s Top 10 chart, ABC’s “General Hospital” was able to hold a solid lead over the CBS drama series this week and claim the Top Soap title. The series held a 54% advantage over “Y&R.” “All My Children” rose a notch to place third, while “Days of our Lives” jumped from 6th to 4th.\n\nVoting for the Week of January 12 – 16, 2009 opens Friday at 4:00 PM, ET/1:00 PM, PT.
