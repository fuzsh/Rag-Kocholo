        "text": "There is a footnote at the bottom that states that tickets may be obtained at various NSDAP (Nazi Party) Offices. General admission was 50 pfennigs for the public, 40 pfennigs for Nazi Party members.\n\nOperation Bernhard\n\nGerman counterfeit 5 pound note\n\nWe should very briefly mention what has been called the greatest counterfeiting operation of all time, Operation Bernhard. This was not a propaganda campaign, although the very same people who prepared the banknotes were also involved in a PSYOP campaign to parody British postage stamps with Communist and Jewish symbols. Operation Bernhard was instead, a secret German plan devised during World War II to destabilize the British economy by flooding the country with forged Bank of England £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes of 1934.\n\nThis was not the first wartime attempt to counterfeit the money of Great Britain. In 1939, Reinhard Heydrich decided to destroy the economy of Britain by flooding it with fake banknotes. He authorized Operation Andreas, commanded by SS Major Alfred Naujocks, who was given a budget of 2 million Reichsmarks. His technical director was Dr. Albert Langer. In April 1940, the never-patient Reinhard Heydrich ordered Naujocks to counterfeit Norwegian currency, and when told that the effort would at least four months, he fired Naujocks.\n\nThe plan was code-named Operation Andreas because the British flag bore the Cross of St. Andrew. The Germans thought that it looked like an X. In the same way they wanted to strike through the value of the pound, thus making it worthless.\n\nHeydrich did not want to use criminals to make the banknotes, and as a result the plan never went into full production. By early 1942, Langer claimed that his Operation Andrew unit had produced 200,000 five-pound notes and 200,000 ten-pound notes. The project lacked the skilled labor force necessary to go into mass production, and as a result of internal squabbling among Nazi SS officials, Operation Andrew sputtered to a halt. It is probably just as well. Reichsbank Minister Funk stated that the plan was untenable and he could see no way to deliver the banknotes to England. Operation Bernhard also refused to use criminals preferring to use Jewish concentration camp inmates until the need for a counterfeit U.S. banknote eventually brought a professional counterfeiter into the fold.\n\nThe paper for the counterfeits was originally prepared at the Hahnemuhle paper mill near Dassel.\n\nSS Major Bernhard Kruger\n\nThe second and far more successful plan was directed by, and named after, SS Major Bernhard Kruger, who set up a team of 142 counterfeiters at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The Germans scoured the Concentration Camps for Jewish printing experts. A memorandum to Camp Commanders said:\n\nRecruitment of Jewish Prisoners\n\nPrisoners in the camp who are qualified in the printing trade such as paper manufacturing printers or suitable craftsmen are to report to me immediately.\n\nIn Krugers Men, Malkin mentions Kruegers preconceived notions about Jews, possibly from his SS indoctrination. The Jews who were brought to him were not counterfeiters. They were people with some knowledge of printing. He tells August Petrich that he will have to teach these prisoners all he knows about printing. Then he admits:\n\nAre there really artisans among Jews? I thought they were traders, brokers, capable stock market and businessmen, experienced doctors, and lawyers. I find it a unique story, Almost like an Aprils Fool joke Imagine, graphic artists, engravers, repro-photographers and so on from Jewish inmates.\n\nMurray Teigh Bloom tells us a bit about Kruger, (edited for brevity):\n\nIn September 1940, Kruger was assigned to the 6th Directorate of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). In the same year, he was sent to France with a special assignment. He was tasked with obtaining American, Canadian, English, and other passports, identity cards and other documents, which were then used as samples Kruger was later appointed as a head of the 4th Department engaged in photography and the production of forgeries.\n\nOn 8 May 1942, Kruger was appointed the head of the Nazi British banknote counterfeiting operation. He immediately confiscated took all the machinery and products from the earlier Andreas banknote Operation.\n\nAn Operation Bernhard printing plate can be seen at the International Spy Museum in Washington D.C\n\nThe research on, and production of the British banknotes began in 1942. The major problem was the engraving of the complex printing plates and the breaking of the British code used to generate valid serial numbers. One of the experts on the team was Salamon Smolianoff, a Russian who had been forging British 50-pound notes since 1927 and who had been arrested and jailed in Amsterdam for counterfeiting. Another was Adolf Burger, a Slovakian Jew who had been trained as a printer. According to Burger, who wrote two books about his experiences, the forgers at Sachsenhausen also successfully copied the U.S. $100 bill.\n\nAt least five of prisoners who took part in Operation Bernhard published their memoirs. Moritz Nachstern was the first. His book was published in Norway, in 1946, and in 2008 was republished and translated into many languages of the world.\n\nNumber 64401 Remembers\n\nIn Uncle Krueger's Money, Dmitriy Litvak tells us about other authors:\n\nCounterfeiter Adolf Burger returned to Czechoslovakia after the war. The first version of his memoirs was recorded in 1945 by Czech journalists Silvia and Oskar Cresci under the title Number 64401 Remembers and was published only in Czechoslovakia. The book cover drawing for the first edition was done by Leo Haas. Later, in the 70s, Burger wrote his own memoirs. This memoir was translated and republished in the DDR (in 1983), under the title The Devil's Workshop. The film The Counterfeiter, based on Burger's book, won the 2008 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\nIn The Devil's Workshop Burger says in part:\n\nIn September 1944 Kruger appeared in his forgery workshop and announced. Gentlemen from today we are going to produce dollars too.\n\nThere were special rooms set aside for the dollar group. New machines and different paper arrived from Berlin. Soon after Kruger brought in real $50 and $100 bills and gave them to Jacobson the foreman.\n\nThe eight of us worked in isolation from the other prisoners. No one else was allowed to enter the three rooms in the back part of that block.\n\nThe last project in the forgery workshop was production of $50 and $100 bills. Only two hundred $100 bills were printed.\n\nKruger told Himmler of the success by phone and assured his boss that everything was ready now for the production of forged dollars.\n\n\"A million forged dollars a day are to be produced working in two 19-hour shifts.\" It was then 12 February 1945.\n\nBut before production could start Berlin was being attacked by the Allies.\n\nBurger says that an order from the Reich Security main office ordered the work to stop the machinery to be dismantled\n\nSS Major Bernhard Kruger in Postwar British Captivity\n\nMost references to Bernhard Kruger tell of him driving away from the concentration camp with a satchel full of counterfeit money at wars end. In fact, Kruger was arrested first by the French who held him for about two years trying to convince him to forge for them, and then by the British who questioned him in depth about his wartime counterfeiting.\n\nWhen I interviewed Kruger in the 1950s he was a very bitter man who felt he had been mistreated by the allies. In fact, as a former SS officer, he probably got off much lighter than he should have. We talked about many subjects. Some of his comments on the counterfeit currency were:\n\nMy duties within the context of psychological and economic warfare were limited to the currencies of the British Pound and the US Dollar. Both currencies take the lead in international payments. Therefore, the numerous other currencies were not interesting enough. You certainly know that the allied secret services also forged currencies but in a lesser degree than Germany. For instance, the German Reichs credit certificates Reichskreditkassenschein)) that circulated as a means of payment in the territories that were occupied by German troops.\n\nIf I dont err, your knowledge is based on the book Unternehmen Bernhard by Dr. Wilhelm Höttl of Oberaussee, Upper Austria who publishes under the pseudonym Walter Hagen.\n\nThe press as well as the TV stations reproduced, without verifying the truth, the related passages of the above-mentioned book. The same did the journalists who were interested in the subject. That went well until some forgers of Operation Bernhard who lived in Vienna took legal action against these allegations. The two accused journalists tried to justify themselves by referring to the passages in Dr. Höttls book. Therefore, the author Dr. Höttl aka Walter Hagen was heard as a witness before the court of Vienna. This resulted in Höttls admission that he had never and at no time had anything to do with the Operation Bernhard. This admission and the statements of the accusing forgers led to the fact that there were never medals, awards, or prizes for the forgers. Furthermore, another result of the judicial proceeding in Vienna was the conclusion that the forgers were not criminals, like Dr. Höttl absurdly and untruthfully had stated in his book. According to Hitlers order only individuals of Jewish descent were allowed for the work who were not imprisoned due to criminal activities but only (imprisoned) because of their religious confession. There is only one exception, a forger who was not a Jew but a criminal. He was a professional forger of US dollar notes and became known only in 1944 with Operation Bernhard. Your question how the Jewish prisoners got along with the others is therefore obsolete, although there were problems among themselves.\n\nI pulled the Höttl book out of my library to what so angered Kruger. Höttl says in part:\n\nKruger rang me up in my office in Berlin to ask for my help in an application for military decorations. He had applied to Schellenberg for some, as a reward for good work on the part of his staff and had been refused although it was only a question of the most modest awards. To the best of my recollection, it was 12 good service medals and six good service crosses of the 2nd class Naturally I was glad to do Kruger this service. Kruger was delighted, but it did not turn out so well for me. Only some of the decorations were for the members of the SS and the civilians employed by Kruger. The good service medals were bestowed on deserving prisoners in the Concentration Camp Three of them were Jews. The Commandant of Oranienburg almost had a stroke when he was confronted by the proud display of decorations during an inspection Kaltenberger had a sense of humor, He congratulated me on having been the first to award military decorations to Jews.\n\nI asked Kruger if he has saved any of his products, the stamps, and banknotes of Great Britain, as all the Allied Propagandists had done.\n\nYour question as to why I dont have a collection like this is easily explained. I was in French captivity until May 1949. After my release I was ill for a long time due to the conditions during captivity. Afterwards I had no income for quite a while. I therefore had neither the time nor the financial resources to build up a collection of this kind. Later, it was not worth the trouble because of the high costs due to the rising demand.\n\nAn Operation Bernhard British 100-pound plate\n\nWe catch Kruger in little lies here and there. For instance, every reference we read about the counterfeiting operation says that the Germans just did four notes with the highest denomination being 50 pounds. And yet, a diving club of Lake Toplitz called Tauchclub Dachstein-Salzkammergut said in 2012 that they found a plate for a 100 pounds banknote. They also found the dateline that was to be added to the counterfeit note.\n\nThe 50 Franc banknote of France Plate\n\nKruger also seems to have been involved in the printing of French currency. We dont see any actual notes at the bottom of Lake Toplitz, but there are numerous printing plates, so the project was undertaken, but perhaps never completed. Some of the French plates in the denomination at the bottom of the lake are 50, 100, and possibly 500 francs.\n\nThe 500 Korun banknote of Slovakia\n\nThe Germans also counterfeited the 500 Korun banknote of Slovakia of 1941. Some bags of these forgeries were found floating in the Hallstätter See in 1970 and on later occasions. Others were found at the bottom of the lake. This is another of the Austrian lakes the Nazis used to hide incriminating material. It is situated a few miles west of the Toplitz lake. There enough of these banknotes found that they can be bought in Europe for 200 Euros plus VAT tax.\n\nAn undated article in the newspaper Oberösterreichischen Nachrichten, mentions the find of a bag full of Slovakian fake banknotes in the Hallstätter lake by schoolboys. Their find was not the first, because the article started:\n\nIn the summer of 1970 fake banknotes of about 30 million Kronen that were discovered floating in bags on the Hallstätter See caused a great sensation. The Ministry of the Interior investigated It is confirmed that the banknotes were left at Hallstatt by members of the Slovakian secret service, who were there at the end of the war. One of the most prominent members of the Slovakian party who sought shelter in the Alpenfestung Salzkammergut [An Alpine fortress of the Salzkammergut district] in the last days of the war was the Slovakian chief of government, the priest Josef Tiso, who was killed in 1947 as Hitlers ally in WWII. The keepers of the fake banknotes threw them into the lake to get rid of them. The Austrian police did not pursue the matter because the banknotes were completely worthless, and it was not worth employing a diver.\n\nGerman specialist Wolfgang Baldus and I had a conversation about these forgeries. He said:\n\nCounterfeit money for Slovakia would make sense. The Slovakian fascist priest Jozef Tiso could do with it the same as the Germans did: pay agents, buy gems or gold or art paintings abroad, sell the stuff in Switzerland or wherever in exchange for genuine currency or other unsuspicious valuables such as the Germans did, but all for the benefit of the Slovakian treasury. After several bags were found in the Hallstätter lake in the 1970s, some people offered to tell the story to the police as well as to some magazines, provided they would remain incognito. None of the organizations wanted to grant that secrecy and thus the story is still untold.\n\nTiso was a Slovak politician and Roman Catholic priest who served as president of the Slovak Republic, a client state of Nazi Germany during World War II, from 1939 to 1945. Tiso collaborated with Germany in deportations of Jews, deporting many Slovak Jews to extermination and concentration camps in Germany and German-occupied Poland, while some Jews in Slovakia were murdered outright. Deportations went on between 25 March 1942 until 20 October 1942. An anti-fascist partisan insurgency was waged, culminating in the Slovak National Uprising in summer 1944, which was suppressed by German military authorities with many of its leaders executed. Consequently, on 30 September 1944, deportations of Jews were renewed, with additional 13,500 deported. In 1947, after the war, Tiso was executed for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Bratislava.\n\nSo, the Slovakian fake banknotes were found both in the Hallstätter and the Toplitz lakes.\n\nSome of the boxes discovered in the salvage operation\n\nThe German magazine Stern received a permit from the Austrian government to conduct a salvage operation in the Toplitzee in July 1959. They brought boxes of counterfeits and items to the surface. This salvage went on both legally and illegally for years afterwards leading to some deaths. In 1963 and 2000 the salvage returned. Besides the banknotes, gold, jewels, and other Nazi stolen booty was brought up from the deep.\n\nI want to take just a moment to mention that the Germans were in full retreat. The Bernhard counterfeiters and their machinery and crates of banknotes and other treasures were racing through the mountains and valleys trying to keep a step ahead of the advancing enemy troops. As time seemed to be running out, the enemy got closer, the SS troops panicked, and vehicles broke down or were abandoned, there were many places that the items were dumped in rivers and lakes with the idea of possibly bringing them back to the surface at some future time when the Allies were gone, and it was safe to do so. I was never very interested in the various places, but researcher Kenneth Pugh did list them so perhaps I should mention them to my readers. He mentions the Bernard group first reaching Mauthausen concentration camp, then Redl-Zipf concentration camp, then Ebensee and finally scattering in the rugged mountainous terrain of Traunsee and Toplitzee. He adds:\n\nSome trucks made it only as far as Lake Traunsee where their cargo was dumped into the lake. SS Obersturmfuehrerr Hansch received assistance from Wehrmacht Marine troops stationed at a U-boat equipment and torpedo testing base at Toplitzee and dumped his entire cargo into the cold, deep waters of the lake. One of SS Officer Hanschs trucks transporting counterfeit notes and printing plates broke down. The items in that truck were dumped in the Enns and Traun Rivers.\n\nThese are the places we know about. How many more Nazi records and treasures were dumped in other places and forgotten? I think there might be many more such treasures hidden away in forgotten and hidden lakes. Now, back to the story.\n\nBurger also says regarding to the dollar project that the inmates selected to counterfeit the U.S. dollar were Solomon Smolianoff, Norbert Levy (chief of the photographic department), Abraham Jacobson (director of the copy department), Adolf Burger (typographer) and Leonard and Roger Weill (retouchers). The painters Leo Haas and Peter Edel would assist them as needed.\n\nIn a top secret interrogation after the war Jacobson stated that he started forging U.S. dollars in May 1944. He claims they planned to print $50 and $100 bills, and although 5000 pieces were made, they were never numbered or left the plant. It seems that every one of the counterfeiters told a different story after the war and since there probably was some compartmentalization, it may be that they are just telling us the rumors that they heard from each other.\n\nThe main problem was to find an adequate printing method. Genuine dollar notes were printed in what Burger calls tiefdruckverfahren, which can be translated as engraved (intaglio) printingbut the inmates did not have the correct type of printing press. It was decided instead to print the notes in the Lichtdruck process. This method uses a glass plate that is covered with light-sensible gelatin layer on which the film negative is exposed. No screening is necessary to reproduce halftone pictures, but only up to 1.000 copies can be printed from one plate. A typical feature of this seldom used printing process is the wrinkled grain that is seen instead of screen dots under a magnifying glass. Burger claims that they attempted to counterfeit $50 and $100 banknotes with the Lichtdruck process. He says that only two-hundred copies of the $100 note were printed.\n\nI probably should not editorialize since this article is entirely factual, but I feel that I must make some comments here. The vast majority of the information about this operation comes from former Jewish concentration camp inmate counterfeiters. They lived in relatively good conditions while all around them their fellow inmates died of starvation, disease and ill treatment. There probably is survivor guilt. In addition, the inmates were helping their sworn enemies win the war. We understand why they acted as they did, but they were by definition, collaborators. As a result, many of the inmates now talk about how they fought the Germans and sabotaged their efforts, and Burger, in his autobiography, becomes practically a one-man sabotage machine. I think we need to be very critical when we read these reports and ask ourselves if they are totally reliable. In the various interviews you will read that no $100 bills were printed, the backs of some $100 bills were printed, One-hundred or two-hundred $100 bills were printed, and perhaps even $20 and $50 bills were worked on. It is difficult to know what really happened.\n\nThe German-language movie Die Falshers (The Counterfeiters) based on Burgers book depicted the inmates handing Major Kruger forged American banknotes.\n\nThe Czechoslovakian Report on the Berhard Forgeries\n\nThis is probably the first published report on the German counterfeits; the classified Secret booklet is dated 15 December 1945.\n\nBy the time Sachsenhausen was evacuated in April 1945, according to Chief Inspector (later Chief Superintendent) William Rudkin of the London Metropolitan Police, the printing presses there had produced 3,945,867 £5 pound notes, 2,398,981 £10 pound notes, 1,337,335 £20 pound notes and 1,282,902 £50 pound notes for a total on £134,610,945 pounds. The Germans used them all over Europe for espionage and covert operations, purchased weapons with them from partisan bands, and even paid their spy \"Cicero\" in the British embassy in Turkey with the counterfeits. The notes are considered the most perfect counterfeits ever produced, being extremely difficult to distinguish from the real thing. The best grade was used by German spies in enemy countries and for purchases in friendly or neutral countries. The second best grade was for collaborators and informers. The third grade would have been dropped over the British countryside to destroy its economy. This never happened because it was impossible to produce enough notes to destroy an economy, and worse, it would tip off the British that their notes were being counterfeited. The last grade was destroyed.\n\nNazi Counterfeiting of British Currency during WWII\n\nThe most detailed examination of the German propaganda notes is probably Nazi Counterfeiting of British Currency during WWII, written by Bryan Burke in 1987 in a limited edition of 100 books.\n\nDid the Germans really counterfeit U.S. currency? Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp inmates were interviewed at the end of the war at the Seventh Army Interrogation Center. Two Jewish prisoners, Jacob Goldglass and Henrik Fajermann stated on 20 May 1945 that the counterfeiting team that had produced millions of fake British pounds had planned to counterfeit American banknotes late in the war. The secret report stated:\n\nThe camp had thirteen machines for the production of British pound notes and two machines for the production of American dollar bills. The latter could not be produced because of the lack of suitable paper.\n\nHans Walter, one of the original Bernhard forgers spoke of his experiences in 2009. There was not much new in his comments, but it is nice to have facts verified by one of the forgers. He said that barracks 19 was sealed off from the remainder of the camp and there was no contact with the other prisoners. The Camp Commandant was not even aware of the work being done there.\n\nHis job was to inspect the forged notes and to put them into one of five categories (not four as mentioned elsewhere in this article). Has believed that the best notes, category one, were for shipment to England (through Chicago and Switzerland). The next grade was to be sent to the English colonies. The third grade was to be used in sabotage operations at the front and in Africa and Egypt. Grade four notes were to be dropped over England to disrupt the economy and the poorest of the forgeries were discarded.\n\nHans said that Bernhard Kruger would come to visit once or twice a week. The hardest portion of the British note to copy was \"Britannia\" because of the large amount of details in the figure. There were no secret marks applied to the notes and none of the prisoners ever got any of the forgeries out of the camp.\n\nAfter successfully forging the English notes, Hans said that his fellow prisoners set about to make U.S. one hundred dollar bills. The green color of the ink created a problem but that was overcome. To complete the process would have resulted in the gas chamber so the prisoners decided to slow the project. Hans said that in mixing the ink he added a little machine oil to the mixture so that when the green ink dried some of it would come off when rubbed by a finger. Kruger took notes to a German printer to try to solve the problem but they could not.\n\nA declassified report entitled Counterfeiting Activities of Section 6-F-4 in the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (German Main Security Office) agrees:\n\nIt was also planned to produce American dollars. Section 6-F-4 already possessed the necessary engraving plates but had not been able to produce a satisfactory paper. The paper on hand was much too stiff and had other failings.\n\nWe know that part of the block 18 dormitory was cleared for the dollar workshop in May 1944. There is a theory that Kruger was willing to have the project linger on since a successful ending or total failure meant his inmates would be executed and he might find himself on the Eastern Front facing the Russians. As a result, the dollar project stretched on and on. Anthony Pirie says in Operation Bernhard, William Morrow and Company, NYC, 1961:\n\nEarly in January 1945, Kruger received a phone call from Sachsenhausen. Soon afterwards, in Block 19, he was minutely examining the first run of the new dollar notes  a hundred samples of the hundred-dollar bill.\n\nBurke adds in Nazi Counterfeiting of British Currency During World War II, The Book Shop, San Bernardino, CO, 1987:\n\nOn the 6th of January 1945, a selection of notes was shown to Himmler in which, it is said, he could not separate the genuine from the copies. The engraving was much harder than for the simple Bank of England notes, but the numbering system proved to be quite easy to break Some of the prisoners involved thought that about 200 of the $100 notes were printed. McNally [a U.S. Army major who had served in the American Secret Service and was appointed to Germany after the war to protect the occupying forces from counterfeit currency], in his investigation, estimated about 6,000\n\nLawrence Malkin says in Krugers Men, Little, Brown and Company, NYC, 2006:\n\nWithin two days they had printed what Smolianoff [the one true criminal counterfeiter in the group  known by a dozen aliases] judged a pretty fair copy of the back of a hundred dollar bill. Across a table the Dollar Group spread fifteen genuine greenbacks with their fake demonstration bill. Without a magnifying glass, it was hard even for the forgers themselves to distinguish the counterfeit.\n\nThe group then started work on the front of the $100 note and after a week they had a suitable $100 counterfeit note. The inmates were ordered to produce one million dollars of U.S. currency a day.\n\nArlie Slabaugh says in Prisoner of War Monies and Medals, Hewitt Brothers, Chicago, Il, 1965:\n\nLate in 1943 it was decided to counterfeit U.S. currency By late fall 1944the reverse of the $100 bill was finished, approved and retouching began on the face. Twenty $100 bills were produced which passed inspection except for the U.S. date and serial number which had not yet been solved. The paper had finally been imitated but due to the bombings the factory could not produce the quantity needed. The U.S. $100 bill never went into production. The plates were destroyed.\n\nThe Counterfeit specialist Murray Teigh Bloom, author of seven books on currency, wrote in an International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence article entitled Uncle Sam: Bashful Counterfeiter that the Germans attempted to counterfeit a U.S. $20 note. He says that the operation proceeded so slowly that it was never completed. I have seen no other evidence of this denomination being counterfeited.\n\nSo, although there is no evidence of the German counterfeits ever being put into circulation, there are numerous written references to them being printed.\n\nThe Money Game\n\nThe artist Mort Kunstler painted a scene of the counterfeit currency workshop of Sachsenhausen concentration Camp entitled The Money Game. The scene is explained in advertisements as:\n\nIn the dark recesses of Barracks 19 at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, a German SS officer examines a sample of counterfeit U.S. currency being manufactured for distribution in an effort to undermine the economy of the United States. Unbeknown to Hitler and his cohorts, the scheme would never reach fruition as the conspiracy would be thwarted by an allied victory in Europe.\n\nWhat is interesting about the painting from the artist known for his historical accuracy is that it depicts a counterfeit $50 banknote, one that may have never been counterfeited by the Jewish inmates in the camp. Most written references state that only the $100 note was counterfeited, as reported in the classified Secret December 1945 Czechoslovakian Ministry of the Interior Report on Forgery in Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp. Translated to English it says in part:\n\nKruger brought in about fifty 100 dollar bank notes For whole months the work did not produce satisfactory results Faults could be seen in the application of color. At other times they filed to achieve the right tone of green for the reverse side of the 100 dollar notes. 220 experiments were made altogether until at the end of December 1944 they were able to begin on the production of the bank notes But although the prisoners had an ultimatum from Himmler to manufacture dollars, the actual production was never carried out Altogether about 200 one hundred dollar bank notes were printed. These were left in the camp.\n\nA $100 Bernhard Forgery?\n\nResearcher Kenneth Pugh depicted what is alleged to be a Bernhard Kruger $100 counterfeit Bernhard banknote in a discussion with the British Empire Stamp Group. He did not recall where he first found it. I have never seen such a note in my research so if it is as advertised this is very interesting and rare.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of confusion about the American counterfeit dollars, although most comments seem to agree that two hundred $100 dollar bills were produced. Some of the many comments we find in print are:\n\nPrisoners engaged in the production of dollars testified that 200 pieces of 100-dollar bills were issued...McNally, by contrast, points out 6,000 in his report...At the end of 1943, it was decided to start issuing American dollars... At the end of 1944, the reverse side of the 100-dollar bill was completed, and work began on the front side. 200 pieces of one-hundred-dollar bills were produced, which were checked, except for the numbering system.\n\nJohn K. Cooley says in Currency Wars, Skyhorse Publishing, NYC, 2008:\n\nKruger turned over some genuine $50 and $100 notes to copy The SD leadership had originally demanded that the team produce 200 perfect $100 specimens On the two hundred and fiftieth attempt The result was twenty-four perfect $100 counterfeits. During the same night, the team printed the required 200 bills, face value $20,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Wilhelm Hottl says in Hitlers Paper Weapon, Rupert Hart-Davis, London, 1955:\n\nKruger had enlisted one of the worlds outstanding experts in forging dollars. A Bulgarian gypsy named Solly Smoljanoff; he was also known by many other names to the police of all nations. Smoljianoff assured Kruger that he could make first-class plates for fifty- and hundred-dollar notes and produced the first examples by the end of 1944 when the first dollars were delivered in early 1945, they were turned down because of defective paper\n\nMoritz Nachtstern talks about his experiences as a forger in Sachsenhausen and says that there were $50 bills produced in Counterfeiter  how a Norwegian Jew survived the holocaust, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, U.K., 2008. The counterfeiters talk about their work at different times:\n\nWe will soon begin the manufacture of 50-dollar bills en masse. I swear old Uncle Sam is going to be so bloated with dollar bills that he will burst\n\nIt wont be long and youll see a 50-dollar bill that beat everything in the industry. It will be my lifes masterpiece\n\nAre you completely finished with it? Does it look good? You should have seen Kruger. He embraced me and carried on like a maniac. I can tell you this men; if anyone has produced a better 50-dollar bill than mine, he has not been discovered.\n\nSo, at least three authors believed that the Germans attempted to counterfeit a U.S. fifty dollar bill. Perhaps Mort Kunstler got the idea from Hottl.\n\nMort Kunstler and Author\n\nIn 2006 the author was asked to display and explain American and foreign weapons and uniforms as part of an exhibition of Mort Kuntsler's military paintings.\n\nOperation Bernhard seems to be the story that lives on forever. On 18 August 2011 a set of the four counterfeit notes was auctioned in Great Britain. The four banknotes were recovered from Lake Toplitz in Austria and estimated at 2,000 pounds. That seems rather steep because generally a set can be bought for less than half that amount. I assume the auctioneer thought that the Lake Toplitz provenance made them more valuable.\n\nMany experts have stated that the British did not know that their banknotes were counterfeited by the Germans until after the war. In fact, the British did know because they were regularly arresting Nazi spies and the Germans had paid some of them with Bernhard counterfeits. In February 2012 the British National Archives released documents on the discovery of counterfeit banknotes found in the possession of Nazi spies. The documents say in part:\n\nAccording to information given by Alfred Naujocks, who gave himself up in November 1944, the Germans started to forge these notes in 1940 with the object of scattering them over the country from the air at the time they were invading the British Isles, in order to cause a loss of confidence and general confusion.\n\n[These are clearly the early attempts and not the later Bernhard counterfeits].\n\nIn September 1943, the German spy Tricycle arrived with 500 five pound notes, 152 of which were counterfeits. In March 1944, the spy Treasure was found with 30 ten pound notes, 23 of which were counterfeits.\n\nThe Bernhard 10 Pound Forgery\n\nWhen I collected the German counterfeits I liked the ones that had been identified and stamped by banks. The Germans liked to think that they were never caught but I had many such notes with different handstamps showing that the notes had been recognized as fakes by various European banks. The Poles have stamped this note FALSZYWY (False). I also have notes stamped by the British FALSIFICATION.\n\n[It appears that in some cases one section of German intelligence was selling counterfeits in Lisbon to raise funds and another section was buying the counterfeits that they believed were genuine and paying spies with that currency. We cannot be sure if the Germans intended to give the spies the fake money or not. We also notice that the British watched every banknote in foreigners hands and traced them back to the point of origin trying to decide if the banknote had somehow come into German hands and was being used to pay spies].\n\nOn Veterans Day 2021, I was asked to take part in a Zoom discussion on the German counterfeit banknotes by the 400-member British Empire Study Group of New York. I was described as a special guest, and acted as a reference source for Kenneth Pugh, to answer questions and make comments as needed. Kenneth did a very detailed report and I thought it might be worthwhile to add some of his comments to this article, even though 20 years has passed since I wrote it. I found these comments particularly interesting. I had shortened my report to make it brief but some of the things Ken discussed deserved adding to the article.\n\nHe pointed out that Operation Andreas was from 1939 to 1941 and they only prepared 5- and 10-poind notes. After Heydrichs assassination, Ernst Kaltenbrunner took over and Bernhard Kruger who had proven himself very capable in the production of British banknotes in Operation Andreas, was placed in charge. Operation Bernhard ran from 1942 to 1945 and the 20- and 50-pound notes were counterfeited then. In 1943 the Germans started work on the U.S. $100 bill.\n\nThe headquarters for Operation Andreas was the Reichssicherheits Hauptamt (RSHA - Amt VI) counterfeiting factory in this classic mansion at Delbruckstrasse 6A, Schloss Charlottenberg district, Berlin. The building was called The Devil's Workshop for all the secret espionage documents created there. The second floor contained the photographic section, first floor was administration, and the basement held the 200-ton printing press. The printing plates were engraved onto copper in the Schloss Friedenthal building near Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The Spechthausen paper factory in Eberswalde was selected by to research and develop the special linen paper for the banknotes.\n\nThe counterfeiters at Sachsenhausen, now numbering 140, up from the original 39 Jewish prisoners, came from fifteen nations and represented fifty-five trades or professions. Most were Jewish, but others were career criminals that had special skills useful to the operation.\n\nThe 50 Pound Bernhard Forgery signed Peppiatt\n\nCuriously, Sir Kenneth Oswald Peppiatt, the Bank of Englands chief cashier, refused to believe the counterfeits existed, stating that:\n\nHe could not imagine anyone clever enough to match any piece of paper with his signature on it.\n\nSir Kenneth Oswald Peppiatt\n\nWhen Mussolini was arrested the German S.S. agent was given permission to use 50,000 operation Bernhard pounds to bribe Italian officials in Naples. Mussolini quickly located on the island of Maddalena. Approximately 25,000 pounds of Operation Bernhard currency was used in bribes to conduct the rescue. The British and Americans were dropping weapons to the partisans in Yugoslavia, and the Germans used Bernhard counterfeits to buy the guns from the guerrillas and use them against the Allies.\n\nSurprisingly, in November 1939, Paul Chourapine, a Russian spy operating in Athens, Greece, uncovered the details of the counterfeiting plan; Bank of England Governor Sir Montagu Norman and the other directors were informed of the plan. Their reaction was to mostly ignore it. Even when the French Police offered an informer who knew of the existence of a factory producing five- and ten-pound counterfeits, Sir Kenneth Oswald Peppiatt, the Bank of England's chief cashier, ignored the information. The Bank of England first obtained examples of Operation Andreas counterfeits on 1 March 1941, when a German agent tried to pass them in a Reichsbank in Switzerland.\n\nThis concludes our discussion of German propaganda aimed at the United States and Europe. There are other banknote-leaflets allegedly produced, but none has been seen at present. For instance, Murray Teigh Bloom states in The Brotherhood of Money, BNR Press, Port Clinton, Ohio, 1983, that \"the Germans planned to take French currency plates with them when they retreated.\" Allegedly this plot was foiled when the French gave the Germans deformed and faulty plates. Bloom says: \"The Germans used the deformed plates to make propaganda notes - a seeming French note on one side and on the other a message urging French soldiers and 'maquis (Partisans)' to surrender.\" These alleged surrender passes are unknown and it is probable that the leaflets in question are those that pictured the 5-franc AMG note we mention above.\n\nBurger claims that his Counterfeiting team forged Soviet currency and NKVD papers:\n\nWe made almost everything; Soviet rubles, and in a smaller quantity, Soviet documents. I remember once we had to falsify 200 identity cards of the Soviet Peoples Commissariat Security employees.\n\nJacobson adds that the Germans intended to counterfeit French 25 franc notes but they never produced any. He was ordered to counterfeit currency of the Netherlands but convinced his bosses that it was too difficult.\n\nHow do I end this little look at Bernhard Kruger? Perhaps we should see his own unrepentant words spoken to my old friend Murray Bloom:\n\nUnder my supervision and direction $600,000,000 worth of the finest British pound notes ever made outside the Bank of England were made by me and 140 involuntary assistants. The counterfeiting experts of Scotland Yard, the French Surete and even the U.S. Secret Service assured me, in tone of grudging admiration, that I was responsible for more counterfeit notes in a two-year period than all the known bogus money makers in those countries had turned out in the previous century.\n\nChinese Pro-Japanese Propaganda\n\nThe Japanese Army regularly produced propaganda leaflets in an attempt to sway the patriotism of the Chinese National Army and the guerrillas. The pro-Japanese Chinese collaborationist government took part in a series of propaganda operations against the legitimate Chinese government and the guerrillas that helped it.\n\nGenuine Central Bank of China 1 yuan note of 1936 (front)\n\nParody of Central Bank of China 1 yuan note of 1936 (back)\n\nThe first parody of a Chinese banknote was a lithographed full-color replica of the Central Bank of China 1 yuan note of 1936 with a safe conduct pass in brown on the back. The serial number 558829 N/E appears on both front and back. The pass is dated 1936 in Arabic numerals on the back and the date in Chinese on the front is MK25 (1936). This was the original safe conduct pass. This note is also known with a slightly modified text and different serial number.\n\nThe safe conduct message appears as nine vertical lines of Chinese text in a central boxed area, flanked on the left by a circular area containing one vertical line of six Chinese characters and on the right by a circular scalloped area containing one vertical line of six Chinese characters. Above the central boxed area is a horizontal arced banner line of five Chinese characters; below the central area is a horizontal straight line of eleven characters. The text is:\n\nSafe conduct pass for military troops\n\nWelcome to the forces of peace Guarantee of safe passage\n\nPrior to the Official Announcement of the Military Committee, this Safe Conduct Pass has been made for those who intend to join the peace reconstruction movement of the New Central Government. There has been an understanding with the front-line troops of the Japanese Army. Please show this Pass to the sentries of the Japanese Army to obtain protection and the means to join the New Central Government.\n\nMilitary Committee, National Government, Nanking\n\nThe note is described in World War II Remembered, C. Frederick Schwan and Joseph E. Boling, BNR Press, 1995.\n\nThe Nanking Nationalist Government with Wang Ching-wei as President was a collaborationist carbon copy of the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek. The Japanese puppet government in Nanking copied the names of bureaus and agencies in an attempt to appear legitimate. However, the genuine Chinese government did not have a Military Committee. The term \"peaceful reconstruction movement\" was a direct counter-propaganda slogan to the nationalist \"reconstruction through the war of resistance movement.\"\n\nThe second variety of this note was described in Oriental Affairs, March 1941. The text is mostly the same with some variation perhaps caused by translation but the propaganda text at the sides of the note is described as:\n\nWelcome to take part in peace - To safeguard your life.\n\nThe article states that the note was produced by The Headquarters of the Pacifying Forces in Kiangsu, Chekiang and Anhwei Province. In addition:\n\nThe forged notes are stated to have been freely distributed among villagers in the countryside\n\nGenuine Central Bank of China 5 Fen\n\n5 Fen parody\n\nThe Japanese collaborationists then proceeded to take the propaganda message on the back of the original banknote and reproduce it on the currency of other banks. The first copy is a green replica of Central Bank of China 5 fen (5 cents) note of 1939 with a safe conduct pass in green on the back, reduced in size to fit the smaller size of this note. Curiously, they copied the serial number along with the text so this note is also 558829 N/E on the back with no serial number on the front. The pass is dated 1936 in Arabic numerals on the back; the date in Chinese on the front is MK28 (1939).\n\nThe Ward D. Smith and Brian Matravers book Chinese Banknotes, Shirjieh Publishers, Menlo Park, CA, 1970, is the Bible of Chinese numismatics. They say in regard to the 5 fen note:\n\n[The 5 cents] also exists with a slightly larger but otherwise identical obverse, but with a reverse dated 1936. It was issued by the Nanking Government Military Affairs Committee as a form of safe conduct pass to encourage defections from the Chinese nationalist military.\n\nGenuine Farmers Bank of China 1 chiao (10 cents)\n\nA Safe Conduct Pass Parody of Farmer's Bank of China 1 chiao (10 cents)\n\nThe Chinese also parodied the Farmer's Bank of China 1 chiao (10 cents) note of 1937 with safe conduct pass in blue on the back. The serial number appears on both front and back. The pass is dated 1936 in Arabic numerals on the back; the date in Chinese on the front is MK26 (1937). The text is identical to the preceding two banknotes.\n\nA Second Parody of Farmer's Bank of China 1 chiao (10 cents)\n\nThere are two versions of the Farmer's Bank of China 1 chiao (10 cents) note of 1937 with safe conduct pass in blue. Once again the serial number appears on both front and back. This pass is a modified reprint of the preceding item. The pass is dated 1942 in Arabic numerals on the back; the date in Chinese on the front is MK26 (1937). Besides the difference in date, there is a slight difference in the text in the central box: the last (leftmost) line has only five Chinese characters rather than six, and the two references to the \"New Central Government\" have been changed to \"Nanking Government.\"\n\nAs stated earlier, there is a second pro-Japanese safe conduct pass on the Bank of China 1 yuan note of 1936 that we depict above. This note is dated 1936 in Arabic numerals on the back and the date in Chinese on the front is MK25 (1936). This second variety has the serial number 267355 N/H on the front and back. The front is identical to the genuine banknote,\n\nThis version has the serial number 267355 N/H on the front and back. The front is identical to the genuine banknote, and once again the safe conduct message is on the back. This pass has the same structure as those in the preceding listing, and bears similar texts with some minor changes and additions. The central boxed area in this pass now contains ten vertical lines and translates to:\n\nSafe conduct pass for military troops\n\nWelcome to the forces of peace Guarantee of safe passage\n\nPrior to the Official Announcement of the Military Committee, this Safe Conduct Pass has been made for those who intend to join the peace movement of the New Central Government. There has been an understanding with the front-line troops of the Japanese Army and the Pacification Army. Please show this Pass to the sentries of the Japanese Army or the Chinese Army to obtain protection and the means to join the New Central Government.\n\nPacification Army of Kiangsu, Chekiang, and Anhwei Provinces\n\nThis second variety is illustrated and discussed in Oriental Affairs 15, 3 (March 1941).\n\nIn Battle Hymn of China, Knopf, NY, 1943, Author Agnes Smedley mentions a banknote safe conduct pass dropped over the north bank of the lower Yangtze River, an area occupied by the Communist New Fourth Army:\n\nAnother handbill looked like a banknote except that the reverse side explained the procedure for desertion. It urged guerrillas to bring their rifles. Halt at least 200 feet away from a Japanese garrison and wave a white flag. Next all should lay their rifles on the earth, then, with arms uplifted, approach the Japanese sentry one by one to be searched for concealed weapons. After that a life of ease would be theirs!\n\nJapanese Overprint on Malaya Currency\n\nThe Japanese defeated and occupied British Malaya in 1942 and printed occupation currency for their use. For some unknown reason they placed a propaganda message on the back of this 1944 $100 dollar banknote.\n\nAt the right there is a red circle hand-stamp that means: verified.\n\nThe text is read from top to bottom, right to left, written in a poetic style where it rhymes, with five characters per line.\n\nIt is easy to catch a tiger in the jungle [can also be high mountain]\n\nIt is hard to find someone to lend you money.\n\nIf you have no savings\n\nYou will have a big problem.\n\nGreater Japan [can also be Empire of Japan]\n\nMalayan Finance Department\n\nA square red chop at left is: Showa ___ year The hand-stamped date is difficult to read, but it certainly was applied during the occupation of Malaya by Japan. There was no Greater Japan after their surrender in 1945.\n\nJapanese pornographic banknote parodies\n\nThe Japanese also used pornographic photographs on their banknote parodies to catch the attention of the Chinese soldiers and patriots. Two are reported to have been disseminated in Chekiang Province. They were first reported in The China Weekly Review, April 13, 1946 which identified them as \"Army Return certificates.\" The photographs and the text are inconsistent. The first propaganda banknote appears to be imitations of the Farmers Bank of China 1 chiao (10 cents) note of 1937 depicting a nude girl from the waist up. The second note may be the Central Bank of China 1 yuan note of 1936 or 5 fen (5 cents) note of 1939 showing a nude girl sitting on a floor.\n\nThe text is identical on both notes:\n\nI am constantly looking forward to your return. You are still fighting the war of resistance. If you continue to fight, you will die in the field! Come back and listen to my heart.\n\nBan Shigeo, a technician at the Japanese Army's 9th Technical Research Institute wrote a slim history of the Japanese WWII Noborito Research Institute entitled: Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu (The Truth About the Army Noborito Research Institute), in 2001. It was reviewed by Stephen C. Mercado.\n\nThe institute was commanded by Lt. Gen. Shinoda, and was involved in projects to develop poisons, biological agents, and the balloon bombs sent to drift over the western United States to set forest fires near the end of the Second World War.\n\nOf the Japanese Army's ten numbered institutes, only the 9th Army Technical Research Institute came under the covert operations section of the Army General Staff's Second Bureau (Intelligence). Noborito's main customers were the covert operatives trained at the Army's Nakano School and the counterintelligence officers of the Kempeitai. Noborito developed equipment for the men of Nakano, where the institutes equipment was often tested before deployment.\n\nOne wartime project was the counterfeiting of the currency used by Chiang Kai-shek's regime with the idea of flooding the area held by Nationalist China, causing economic upheaval, undermining confidence in the Nationalist regime, destroying the economy and ending the Chinese resistance. The Noborito Research Institute printed the currency, members of the Nakano School took the counterfeit notes to China, and then Imperial Japanese Army intelligence units worked with Shanghai's notorious crime gangs to distribute the currency.\n\nOne Type of 5 Yuan Chinese Banknote Counterfeited by the Japanese\n\nMore information about this counterfeiting operation became known in 2015. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the Imperial Japanese Army used a private company to produce counterfeit banknotes of China. 279 sheets, each about 30 centimeters square, were found at the Tomoegawa Companys paper mill in Shizuoka. The armys Noborito institute in Kawasaki had placed an order for the sheets with the Tokyo-based company. The sheets showed watermarks of a profile of Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese revolutionary and founding father of the Republic of China. They also contain silk fibers. These features are identical to those of a 5-yuan banknote that was widely circulated in the Republic of China at that time. Other sheets found at the mill had watermarks of the Temple of Heaven, a historic structure in Beijing, that appeared on a different kind of 5-yuan bill back then.\n\nA former Imperial Japanese Army officer who was in charge of the counterfeiting project claimed that Japan had created fake bills worth 4 billion yuan starting in 1939. It is believed that the private company was used because the Army institute was unable to make the banknotes in the bulk required. The civilian-made sheets were produced between August 1940 and July 1941. The workers ensured the bills looked authentic by checking the sophistication of the watermarks and the amount of silk fibers used.\n\nOriginally, authentic banknotes used in the Republic of China were printed in Hong Kong using technology from the United States and Britain. The machines and original plates to print the bills in Hong Kong were confiscated and taken to the institute after Japan occupied Hong Kong in 1941.\n\nA second version of what is apparently the same story says that the Japanese forged the currency of Nationalist China during 1941 to 1945 using inks and plates (and presumably paper) seized from Chinese banks in Kowloon. The inspiration for this ploy came from Lieutenant-Colonel Iwakuro Hideo, 8th Section, Army GHQ, who was a graduate of the Nakano School for espionage according to Louis Allen, \"Nakano School for spies,\" World War Investigator, Vol. 1, No. 12, 1989.\n\nAt the end of the war, the United States secretly employed some of the counterfeiters and installed them at the Yokosuka naval base. They continued to forge currency and documents to support American agent operations in Communist China, North Korea, and the Soviet Far East. This story first came to light when Ariga Tsutao, a former member of the current Japan Defense Agency and a noted authority on the Imperial Japanese Militarys intelligence community, made the allegation.\n\nThere were reports in 1943 of the Japanese flooding China with large sums of counterfeit Bank of China currency notes. Reports from Kweilin indicate that 10 billion dollars in forged currency were introduced into China. It is interesting to note that American agents thought the report was exaggerated and recommended that a figure of 100 million dollars be specified instead. In a later letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, the sum is further reduced to 10 million dollars. The same letter reports that the Japanese have counterfeited US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and British sterling. Other experts such as C. M. Nielsen told me that the Japanese government did not always sponsor the counterfeiting, but they would often stand by and allow private counterfeiters to wreak havoc on the Chinese economy."
