        "text": "Who We Are\n\nThe Nevada National Security Sites (NNSS), part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), is an enterprise of special-purpose, multi-mission, high-hazard experimentation facilities delivering technical and service solutions in partnership with the National Laboratories. Our collaborative work supports the government’s most important national security missions.\n\nA Premier National Security Resource\n\nNNSS locations are preferred for experiments supporting the NNSA’s nuclear weapons Stockpile Stewardship Program, as well as nonproliferation, counterterrorism, intelligence, emergency response, and national security research, development and training programs, including the vital programs of other federal agencies.\n\nTen locations spanning the U.S. comprise the NNSS:\n\nThe Site in Mercury, Nevada\n\nNorth Las Vegas Facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nRemote Sensing Laboratory – Nellis at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada\n\nLivermore Operations in Livermore, California\n\nSpecial Technologies Laboratory in Santa Barbara, California\n\nSandia Operations in Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\nLos Alamos Operations in Los Alamos, New Mexico\n\nDC Office in Washington, D.C.\n\nRemote Sensing Laboratory – Andrews at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland\n\nCounter Terrorism Operations Support (CTOS) Program in Edgewood, New York\n\nNNSS scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technicians partner with colleagues from across the Nuclear Security Enterprise, including the National Laboratories and the defense and intelligence communities, to execute a multitude of high-level experimental, research and training activities in support of national security.\n\nOperational Areas\n\nNuclear Weapons Science is experimental support for the Stockpile Stewardship Program to ensure the nation’s remaining nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe, secure, and effective. These activities include breakthrough nuclear experiments, the use of world-class diagnostic measurement systems, high-tech computer simulations, and detailed engineering analysis.\n\nGlobal and Homeland Security programs include chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) activities; nuclear nonproliferation and counter-proliferation; weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threat reduction; nuclear and radiological emergency response; treaty verification and monitoring; sensor development; and cybersecurity.\n\nEnvironmental programs includes environmental protection, compliance, and monitoring of the air, land, water, plants, animals, and cultural resources at the NNSS; investigation and implementation of appropriate, cost-effective corrective actions to address legacy contamination from historic nuclear weapons testing at the Site; and permanent disposal of low-level and mixed low-level radioactive waste generated by environmental clean-up activities at the NNSS and other sites across the nuclear weapons complex.\n\nOur organization\n\nOffice of Environmental Management – Nevada Program\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 to address the nation’s Cold War environmental legacy resulting from five decades of nuclear weapons production and government-sponsored nuclear energy research. The Environmental Management Nevada Program completes investigations and implementation of appropriate, cost-effective corrective actions to address legacy contamination from historic nuclear weapons testing at the Site and permanent disposal of low-level radioactive waste, mixed low-level radioactive waste, and classified waste generated by environmental clean-up activities at the NNSS and other sites across the nuclear weapons complex.\n\nMission Support and Test Services, LLC\n\nMSTS is a limited liability company consisting of Honeywell International Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., and HII Nuclear, Inc. With some 2,400 employees, MSTS manages operations at the NNSS and at its related facilities and laboratories for the NNSA’s Nevada Field Office. The company has satellite offices in Los Alamos and Albuquerque, New Mexico; Santa Barbara and Livermore, California; Long Island, New York; and Washington, D.C., along with a small number of employees located in nine other states.\n\nInformation about the MSTS prime contract is below:"
