The lab is located approximately 10 miles for the main campus within the Animal Science Research and Education Center (ASREC). Founded in the early 1990’s, the labs primary focus was aquaculture research and extension but has diversified in the 2000’s to include multiple disciplines.\n\nIndoor Facilities consist of the following: Large Wet Lab – Approximately 4000 square feet, four environmental chambers, hot and cold water drops with mixing capabilities, central air blower system, analytical lab, feed prep room/lab, and a conference/small classroom. Outdoor facilities include 12 quarter acre ponds and twenty 200-gallon pools for mesocosm work. There are also two large equipment storage barns.\n\nExamples of research directed by Purdue University faculty includes:\n\nFish nutrition, primarily for aqua cultured species of interest to the region\n\nFish genetics of Brook trout (“Coasters”)\n\nToxicology studies with fathead minnows and other freshwater fishes such as lake whitefish and largemouth bass. Conducting studies with endocrine active compounds, flame retardants, herbicides, pesticides, and nanoparticles\n\nFisheries studies using lake sturgeon and lampreys, lake whitefish and brook trout\n\nThere is on-going production of fish for demonstration purposes at the lab as well.\n\nResearch faculty users and disciplines"
