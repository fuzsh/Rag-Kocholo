This extensive network of laboratories houses state-of-the-art science and technology capabilities that the Homeland Security Enterprise leverages to support long-term and day-to-day operational requirements. More about ONL\n\n5 in-house laboratories\n\nONL capabilities are spread across five states (AL, FL, MD, NJ and NY). These laboratories and sites are national assets to DHS operational components and partners, and anchor a science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) presence in the areas in which they reside. Whether the mission need requires applied research supporting requirements definition, threat characterization, detection, mitigation or response, S&T’s lab network provides technologies and knowledge to help prevent terrorism, secure the homeland, and strengthen national preparedness and resilience.\n\nImage"
