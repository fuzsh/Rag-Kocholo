        "text": "You know you have potential. So do we.\n\nEmpowering students to achieve their fullest potential and live lives of purpose—this has been the core of Garrison Forest School since 1910.\n\nWhat was an innovative educational mission for girls at the turn of the 20th century remains so in the 21st century. Garrison Forest was founded in 1910 as an all-girls’ day and boarding school with a coeducational primary program (now preschool).\n\nThroughout our history, our mission has been to prepare young women for a rewarding college experience and for a purposeful life well beyond. Guided by our motto, Esse Quam Videri—To Be Rather Than To Seem—Garrison Forest’s curricular and co-curricular program balances exceedingly high standards within a welcoming, spirited atmosphere.\n\nHere, students flourish intellectually and individually. Find their voice. Discover their passions. And embrace their potential."
