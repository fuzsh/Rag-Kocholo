        "text": "The division accomplishes its mission on the main NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland as well as at other sites, including the Bayview campus in Baltimore, Maryland and the Twinbrook complex in Rockville, Maryland. The Division is led by the Scientific Director, with input from its Board of Scientific Counselors - a group that provides expert external oversight for all research and training ongoing in the NHGRI Division of Intramural Research. Clinical research is overseen by the Clinical Director, who provides guidance and support for all NHGRI investigators involved in patient-based research.\n\nEach of the more than 50 NHGRI investigators are assigned to one of nine branches - although these boundaries are artificial in many ways, since there are significant interactions among investigators and trainees in different branches, as well as considerable overlap in their respective areas of research. NHGRI investigators have appointments similar to those at most academic research departments. About half are Senior Investigators; these individuals have tenured positions at NIH. Individuals currently in the tenure-track (but not yet tenured) are called Investigators. All Senior Investigators and Investigators lead sections, which are individual laboratories within the branches. Associate Investigators are akin to research and clinical-track faculty at universities, serving a variety of critical roles within NHGRI (but are not part of the NIH tenure system). Some Associate Investigators head units, which are their research laboratories. Finally, there are Adjunct Investigators, individuals with significant scientific interactions with NHGRI but whose primary appointment resides in another NIH institute. The NHGRI Division of Intramural Research also is supported by a number of other scientific and administrative entities, including a series of cores, centers, and offices.\n\nTogether, all of the elements of the Division of Intramural Research share a common aim - to deliver on the promise of genetics and genomics by connecting the base pairs of the Human Genome Project to the bedside of those afflicted with a genetic disease."
