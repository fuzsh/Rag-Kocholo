        "text": "In a funding renewal that underscores its status and the significance of its work, UC Santa Barbara’s Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) has received its seventh consecutive major grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to operate as an NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC). Widely regarded as one of the top five materials research facilities in the world, MRL, which obtained its first MRSEC award in 1994, was one of nine centers selected by the NSF this year to receive $18 million over six years.\n\n“This renewal serves as validation that the choices we have made have been correct,” said Ram Seshadri, UCSB’s Fred and Linda R. Wudl Chair in Materials Science and director of the MRL. “Our focus on collaborative research and shared facilities has contributed to the center’s collective success, in which we take tremendous pride.”\n\nMaterials science is an interdisciplinary field in which knowledge from several disciplines, including physics, chemistry, life science and engineering, is incorporated in pursuit of understanding how the properties and structure of materials influence their function and performance. Materials research enables significant advances in electronics, communications, transportation and health-related fields, among many others.\n\n“NSF’s Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers will help us seize new opportunities in semiconductors, biotech, quantum information and more, addressing the needs of our society and advancing critical emerging technologies,” said NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan. “They will do so by expanding and enriching the ecosystem of innovation across our country.”\n\nand materials. “Nobody involved with the MRSEC is in it for any other incentive than they want to be in the same room with experts in their fields who are generating novel and exciting ideas as a team. The MRSEC provides that intellectual space.”\n\nAdded Seshadri, “I believe that the MRSEC doesn’t just help us in our research, it helps all of us be better researchers.”\n\nThis cycle includes nine faculty who are new to the MRSEC, including two data scientists whose expertise in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning methods will facilitate data-driven discovery across both interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs).\n\n“We love bringing new investigators into the MRL family who take the research in new directions. We want this center to be ever expanding to make the greatest social impact,” said Bates, who added that other faculty will be able to apply for two-year seed grants, funded by the MRSEC, to pursue smaller projects.\n\nShared Facilities\n\nA key component of the grant is to support and sustain the MRL’s world-class characterization facilities — where materials are synthesized and analyzed — which are accessible not only to everyone at UCSB, but to the local community as well. Seshadri said that more than 100 faculty groups from UCSB and other universities, as well as nearly 60 companies, have used the facilities supported by the MRSEC. Numerous startup companies that have sprung from research carried out at UCSB also rely on these facilities to refine their products and prepare them for market.\n\nThe impact of the state-of-the-art graphics processing unit computer cluster reaches far beyond faculty — it also powers the training of the next generation of scientists and engineers. The shared resource is commonly used by undergraduate and graduate students, as well as by high school and community college students and teachers who participate in MRSEC-supported programs.\n\nThe latest renewal establishes two new interdisciplinary research groups to conduct research into electrostatically mediated polymer processing and bioinspired plasticity.\n\nIRG1: Electrostatically Mediated Polymer Processing\n\nElectrostatic interactions are forces between nearby atoms and molecules, where like charges repel each other and opposite charges attract. Much is already known about ions, especially in water and aqueous solutions, which are environments that significantly reduce the attraction and repulsion between ionic charges. However, not as much is known about how and why ions interact in dense polymer systems, where water is not present.\n\n“The interactions in these systems are strong because water is not there to shield the forces between ions,” explained M. Scott Shell, a chemical engineering professor and co-leader of IRG1. “As a result, we believe these kinds of interactions can be used to produce new properties in materials that have yet to be explored. It is a beautifully simple, but potentially powerful and underexplored materials design approach.”\n\nComprising nine faculty from five departments, IRG1 features researchers whose areas of expertise range from polymer synthesis and design, to electrochemistry, multi-scale modeling, polymer field theory, advanced structural, mechanical and property characterization, and data science. In one project, the team will investigate the ability of electrostatic interactions to solve a major problem associated with plastics, namely the recycling and upcycling of plastic waste. For example, polyethylene and polypropylene, two of the most common types of plastics, are chemically very similar, yet they do not mix.\n\n“You end up with useless properties, and that’s the problem with recycling plastic, you have to separate all of these chemicals from each other,” explained Segalman, co-leader of IRG1, adding that it may be possible to force the polymers to mix by placing a positive ion on one chemistry and a negative one on the other. “We will investigate if this technique can be used to drive the miscibility of commercial plastics for recycling.”\n\n“This is a unique capability because it overcomes many of the challenges in simulating dense polymer systems with chemically specific interactions.”\n\nThe knowledge gained on using electrostatic interactions in polymer systems could result in breakthroughs. Beyond the development of new chemistries and processing for recycling plastic waste, IRG1 will also pursue projects to develop new high-performance polymer ion conductors and design high-performance printable polymeric materials that could be used for 3D electronics and wearable technologies.\n\nIRG 2: Bioinspired Plasticity\n\nBiology has evolved for billions of years, creating unique types of materials having exotic mechanical responses that can be coupled to other functions. IRG2 researchers will seek to learn from biological organisms and how they create such mechanical structures, which are typically hydrogels, or polymers infused with water and connected in a network.\n\nIRG2 includes nine primary faculty members from six departments, including three faculty who are new to the MRSEC. The collaboration includes experts in rheology, biopolymer hydrogel mechanics, macromolecular assembly and mechanics, atomistic simulations, multiscale modeling, fluid dynamics and photochemistry.\n\n“UCSB encourages this type of multidisciplinary project, it’s part of our DNA,” said Angela Pitenis, an assistant professor of materials and co-leader of IRG2. “With so many people from so many different areas of soft matter, we can do things together that no single group can do, and our work could lead to some important findings.”\n\nIRG2 research could result in a stronger fundamental understanding of the structure and mechanics of bio-inspired and composite hydrogel materials, the creation of new characterization tools and instruments, and the development of new interpretive schemes for data-driven models.\n\nOutreach and educational activities\n\nThis award also supports a wide variety of outreach activities and educational programs with a history of improving access to science for diverse audiences and increasing public awareness of materials science. Events such as Family Science Night and hands-on workshops reach nearly 4,000 K–12 students annually, more than 60% of whom are underrepresented minorities. Dozens of teachers also participate in MRSEC-funded research opportunities and workshops, building relationships with UCSB researchers and developing their science curricula. The center leverages collaborations with other institutions that benefit undergraduate and graduate students, including the Partnerships for Research and Education in Materials, which provides student exchanges and research opportunities between UCSB and two minority-serving institutions, Jackson State University in Mississippi, and The University of Texas, El Paso; and another student-exchange partnership with Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.\n\nThe MRSEC also supports more than 50 undergraduate interns who conduct research at UCSB each year. A survey of former interns showed that 65% of them went on to attend graduate school, 48% were female, and 39% were underrepresented minorities. Hundreds of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers also participate in the outreach activities, as well as benefiting from travel awards, workshops and internship opportunities facilitated by the MRSEC.\n\n“I received an email the other day from a student who completed a summer program and recently graduated from college. She described the experience as ‘life changing’,” said Dorothy Pak, the MRL’s director of education. “Our programs open doors by introducing participants to research experiences and to our research community. Feeling like a part of a supportive community is extremely important for everybody, especially underrepresented minority students.”"
