        "text": "Research\n\nA long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand the fundamental pathways that dictate how our bodies make, store, and degrade fats or lipids. Most chronic diseases that we are faced with today like coronary heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and even infectious disease are driven by underlying alterations in lipid metabolism. Our research is focused on lipid metabolic metabolic alterations driven by our commensal bacteria as well as our own human cells. All of our projects aim to translate basic discoveries into new therapeutic regimens for cardiometabolic disease.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Brown is Associate Staff in the Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Sciences and Director of Research in the Center for Microbiome & Human Health.\n\nEducation & Professional Highlights\n\nAppointed\n\n2013\n\nEducation & Fellowships\n\nFellowship - Wake Forest University Bowman Gray School of Medicine\n\nLipid Atherosclerosis\n\nWinston-Salem, NC USA\n\n2009\n\nMedical Education - University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nCellular & Molecular Nutrition\n\nGreensboro, NC USA\n\n2004\n\nUndergraduate - University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nNutrition/Diabetes\n\nGreensboro, NC USA\n\n2000\n\nResearch\n\nMy research is focused on the interrelationship between the diets we eat, microbe and host metabolism, and the development of chronic disease. We have three active research programs, and we are always looking for highly motivated young scientists to participate in our multidisciplinary training program.\n\nResearch Focus 1) Metaorganismal Endocrinology: Gut Microbe-Derived Hormones in Human Health & Disease.\n\nMicrobes resident in the human intestine represent a key transmissable factor contributing to a wide variety of human diseases. Here we are studying how gut microbes generate an array of small molecule metabolites that impact host physiology and disease. This line of investigation is studying the role of diet-microbe-host interactions in the context of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n\nResearch Focus 2) Diet and Gene Interactions Driving the Progression of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) & Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (AALD).\n\nThe progression of AALD and NAFLD to advanced fibrosis and end stage liver disease is driven by a combination of dietary and genetic factors. Here we are studying the interaction between metaorganismal nutrient metabolism (i.e. microbe and host metaboism) and host genetics (i.e. common and rare genetic variants), with the hopes of identifying new therapeutic strategies for those suffering from advanced liver disease.\n\nResearch Focus 3) Mechanisms by Which Nutrition & Obesity Drive Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancers.\n\nSeveral common malignancies are associated with poor nutrition and obesity, particularly GI malignancies. In this series of projects, we are beginning to understand how metaorganismal nutrient metabolism impacts obesity and how this can be mechanistically tied to malignancies in the gut, liver, and kidneys.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nView publications for J.
