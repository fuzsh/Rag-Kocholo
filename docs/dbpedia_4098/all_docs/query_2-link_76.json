At SVI, our mission is to produce world-class science with the aim of transforming lives through medical discovery.\n\nWhen racehorse trainer Jack Holt died in 1951, leaving 200,000 pounds to establish SVI, he could not have imagined the impact of his generosity.\n\nIn 2023, SVI celebrated 65 years since our lab doors first opened. This Research Review celebrates the achievements of our dedicated staff and highlights their drive to make a difference â€“ inspired by discovery and driven by purpose."
