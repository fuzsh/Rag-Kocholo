        "text": "Appalachian State University is the only UNC System institution to operate two lab schools — the Academy at Middle Fork, in Walkertown, NC, and the Academy at Elkin, in Elkin, NC.\n\nThe Academy at Middle Fork is a literacy-focused lab school. The school uses a workshop approach that improves and enriches literacy via immersive reading and writing instruction. Academy students, referred to as scholars, are actively engaged in adaptive, guided, small group instruction where teachers model effective reading and writing strategies.\n\nScholars have the opportunity to read a wide variety of texts featuring characters and themes that are identifiable to them. They also participate in a variety of literacy-based activities, including author visits, special programming, and field trips. For example, Literacy Casts, hosted by App State’s Anderson Reading Clinic, provide online collaborative and interactive experiences where students build community and develop literacy skills.\n\nLiteracy is the foundation of the school’s balanced curriculum and the ongoing partnership with the university provides opportunities for collaboration with faculty and students to develop new and engaging models of instruction.\n\nVideo: Academy at Middle Fork students discuss their school pledge and what it means to be a Mountaineer\n\nThe Academy at Elkin opened in August 2022 as a “school within a school” at Elkin Elementary, with an anticipated enrollment of 100 students in second through fourth grades. The school engages students in exploration-based learning.\n\nLearn more from The Board Table podcast: School Boards and Educator Preparation Programs.\n\nSean Gaillard named principal of App State’s Academy at Middle Fork lab school\n\nAppalachian Today | May 27, 2022\n\nEmma Hatfield-Sidden named principal of App State’s Academy at Elkin\n\nAppalachian Today | April 21, 2022\n\nN.C.’s 7th lab school opens in Elkin this fall\n\nSpectrum News 1 | February 15, 2022\n\nApp State to open lab school at Elkin Elementary\n\nAppalachian Today | January 10, 2022\n\nThe mission of East Carolina University’s Community School is to educate the whole child through a web of support that thrives through our partnerships.

At D.C. Virgo, the staff strives for a whole child, whole school, community approach.\n\nThe Catamount School (TCS) is a middle school learning community where all students are valued and care for themselves and others. We promote health and wellness and a commitment to learning through experience in a caring, collaborative, and socially just environment. We recognize that students have a variety of learning differences, and we work to identify an individualized approach so that each student has the opportunity to succeed.\n\nAll TCS educators take collective responsibility to increase the academic growth and achievement of each student. We work to maintain a safe and supportive learning environment for students and staff, and are committed to developing a diverse group of highly qualified leaders who empower others. TCS fully engages families, the community, and staff to work together for the success of each child. The culture reflects the collaboration with Western Carolina University and Smoky Mountain High School. By accessing resources and personnel, students have access to a multiplicity of learning experiences which influence their overall academic achievement, including daily health and physical education, music, arts, and other enrichment activities, clubs and electives, leadership experiences, and mentorship from experts in a variety of academic fields. These academic and enrichment activities encourage students to learn more about themselves and others, increase achievement, and contribute to the school community. Finally, integration of pre-service teacher professionals at the Catamount School is immersive and widespread with undergraduate and graduate clinical placements in middle grades education to principal preparation, school counseling, clinical psychology, nursing, and other health professions."
