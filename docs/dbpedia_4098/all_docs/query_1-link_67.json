They must mirror what we want and how we relate to Earth and each other. They require, in other words, a profound shift in our perception of reality—and that shift is happening now, both as cognitive revolution and spiritual awakening.”\n\n— Joanna Macy\n\nTaking the next step…\n\nYou may have attended one or more of the Dialogues or Immersion Sessions.
