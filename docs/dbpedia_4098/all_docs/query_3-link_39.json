        "text": "Harlem, NY Campus\n\n230 West 125th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10027\n\n(646) 981-4500\n\nBuilt in 2007, our Harlem campus provides 75,000 square feet devoted to state-of-the-art medical education. All nine labs are fully equipped for innovative research and our classrooms, lecture halls, and library boast advanced computing capabilities. We also have support and clinical training facilities on site, like our OSCE and Sim Labs, where students can begin applying and honing their practical skills.\n\nGetting to our Harlem Campus\n\nWe're easily accessible by mass transit, with parking available if you drive.\n\nSubway\n\nTake the A, C, B, D, 4, 5, or 6 to the 125th Street stop. The A, C, B & D subway stop is two blocks away on 125th & St. Nicholas.\n\nTake the 2 or 3 to 125th and Malcolm X Blvd./Lenox Ave. The stop is one avenue block away from the school.\n\nTake the 4, 5, 6 to 125th and Lexington Ave. From this stop you can walk the five avenue blocks, or take the M100, M101 or Bx15 bus.\n\nDriving\n\nShould you decide to drive in, there is metered parking on 124th Street between Frederick Douglass Blvd. and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd. and parking garages nearby.\n\nMiddletown, NY Campus\n\n60 Prospect Avenue\n\nMiddletown, NY 10940\n\n(845) 648-1000\n\nThe Middletown Campus opened its doors on July 21, 2014. It's housed in the former Horton Hospital building, which underwent a $25 million renovation to become a high-tech medical schoolâ€”complete with 85 dorm rooms, a state-of-the-art holographic and plastination lab, and our medical library is open 24/7. We also have support and clinical training facilities on site, like our OSCE and Sim Labs, where students can begin applying and honing their practical skills.\n\nGetting to the Middletown Campus\n\nBus/Train\n\nThe Coach USA/Short Line Bus Network can get you here from the city in as little as an hour and a half. If you prefer to travel by rail, the MTA Metro North Port Jervis line goes right to Middletown. Either way once you arrive it's just a short cab ride to the campus.\n\nDriving\n\nThe easiest way to get here is by car and there are free parking lots on campus for students, faculty, staff, and visitors.\n\nGreat Falls, Montana Campus\n\n2801 18th Avenue South\n\nGreat Falls, Montana 59405\n\n(406) 401-8100\n\nThe Great Falls, Montana campus welcomed its first class in July 2023. With 100,000 square feet devoted to state-of-the-art medical education, students receive interactive, skills-based learning. We have an onsite research laboratory, osteopathic manipulation lab, anatomy, holographic, plastination, and cadaver lab. Class time is dedicated to critical thinking and problem-solving and our approach meets most students' learning styles. At TouroCOM Montana students learn to treat the patient as a whole: mind, body, and spirit. The new facility was designed for students of the future while considering the unique community and learning atmosphere of Great Falls. TouroCOM Montana is located in the medical corridor, within walking distance to Benefis East Health System and McLaughlin Research Institute.\n\nGetting to the Great Falls Campus\n\nGreat Falls is set up on a grid system, so navigating the community is easy. We are located on the west end of Great Falls, directly south of Benefis Health System. From 10th Avenue South, turn south on 26th Street South. Drive two blocks and TouroCOM Montana will be on your left side. Take a left onto 18th Avenue South and the main entrance will be your next left. We are located right across the street from Great Falls Central Catholic High School.\n\nOn-site parking, and street parking, are available, as well as Uber and taxis. Great Falls, and our campus, are most easily accessible by car, though there is bus service. Great Falls International Airport is a short 15-minute drive from campus."
