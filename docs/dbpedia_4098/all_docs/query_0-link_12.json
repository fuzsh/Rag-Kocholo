        "text": "In the late 1890’s Kanō’s experiment in training Chinese students met with so much success that the program expanded beyond the capacity of the large house he had rented at Ushigome Nishigoken-chō. Starting in 1896 with 13 Chinese students urged on him by Prince Saionji Kinmochi (1849-1940), his long term acquaintance and then Foreign Minister, after a couple of years of experimentation, Kanō developed then continued to refine a preparatory school approach: the Chinese students spent a year learning Japanese and the basic skills to enable them to comprehend subjects at extended, regular technical school and university programs taught in Japanese that they might attend if successful. The latter programs typically extended for three or four years. In all Kanō inducted 7192 Chinese students into what eventually he named the Kōbun Gakuin (Chinese; Hóngwén xuéyuàn, often cited in English as the Hongwen Academy).\n\n[See a longer explanation of its program here. Note that it includes a discussion of the pioneering work of the Kōbun Gakuin staff in developing an organized, standardized Japanese language instruction pedagogy, the first of its kind anywhere]:\n\nhttps://kanochronicles.com/2020/08/30/the-kano-chronicles-kano-and-the-kobun-gakuin\n\nThe goal:\n\nmodernizing Chinese education\n\nSome 3818 Chinese graduated and most (and even some of the drop outs) entered a range of advanced university programs, notably including Waseda University and even Kanō’s own Tokyo Higher Normal School, the premier teachers’ college for the Empire. For at its core, the program was primarily to build a strong, Chinese teacher cadre to modernize Chinese education, and the program graduates were obligated to serve in education positions for some years after returning to China.\n\nWho paid for all this?\n\nThe Kōbun Gakuin preparatory program was entirely funded by the Q’ing Chinese government, paid by agreement in Chinese solid silver ingots called tael. A single tael is about 40 grams (1.3 ounces) of high grade silver, and they were minted in multiple tael weights (1, 5, 10, 100 etc). When paid out for this program, the silver was credited against the massive war reparations owed by the Chinese to Japan as part of the peace agreement for the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895).\n\nWhy Japan? Why Kanō?\n\nIt might seem strange for the Chinese to put so much trust in a Japanese program only scant years after the disastrous Sino-Japanese War, but both governments agreed that Chinese education must be modernized to help it withstand encroachment from Western powers and that Japan was in a unique position to help. Not only was Japan closer than Western alternatives, it was cheaper, and the cultural differences not as pronounced. In turn, Kanō shihan was in a unique position within the Japanese education system and the Chinese education effort that he became so personally, intimately entwined with the program to the point that he was awarded a high Q’ing Imperial court award by the Empress Cixi in recognition of his valuable service in modernizing Chinese education. One key source described him as the coordinator of the entire massive effort which resulted in tens of thousands beyond the 7000 Kōbun Gakuin students studying in Japan and scores of Q’ing Dynasty officials visiting to observe the system, often met by Kanō himself, who took the opportunity to introduce untold numbers of them to jūdō, a factor in later developments in China.\n\nWhile other countries’ war reparations debt from the later Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) were eventually forgiven by other combatants, including the United States and Britain, the Japanese simply added their Boxer Rebellion reparations due to the Sino-Japanese War reparations already due and being paid out to fund the overseas study program in Japan. Stacks of silver were shipped to the Chinese legation in Tokyo and distributed to the Chinese students for their living expenses and to the Japanese government for Kanō Jigorō (or at least to his school’s administrative staff).\n\nWhere was the land?\n\nAnd just how many Fujimi-chō are there in Tokyo?\n\nKanō arranged for the purchase of several parcels of adjoining land in the neighborhood of the then Koishikawa ku (ward) called Sakashita-chō. (The attached presentation includes detailed maps.) That small neighborhood was adjacent to a hill then called Fujimi-chō (“Fuji view town”, as one of several high ground areas of Tokyo were and are still called today; this is particularly confusing since from 1886-1889 the Kodokan was based in another Fujimi-chō on the estate of Kanō patron and arch conservative Shinagawa Yajirō.\n\nSee the tale of that other Fujimi-chō dōjō here):\n\nhttps://kanochronicles.com/2020/03/24/the-kano-chronicles-count-shinagawa-yajiro-and-the-fujimicho-kodokan/\n\nSakashita-chō, meaning “the neighborhood below the hill” referred to the small, adjacent neighborhood’s position below the crest of the hill then called Fujimi-chō. Kanō eventually had three classroom and administrative buildings erected for the Kōbun Gakuin, and at its peak they accommodated more than 1300 students at once plus instructors and support staff. Those hundreds of students drudged up the steep Kaiunzaka slope daily, and Kanō apparently named it “Fortune Opening Hill” to encourage the Chinese to focus on the opportunities afforded them by this education. As was his wont, Kanō proselytized physical education in general and jūdō specifically to his new students and had a small dōjō built for them; the Ushigome bundōjō or branch dōjō promoted 33 Chinese students to shodan 1st degree black belt before the school moved to Kaiunzaka in 1903, and untold others likely practiced there, too.\n\nBut by 1909, the program and studying in Japan in general had fallen out of favor with Chinese students for reasons we’ll explore separately later, enrollment dropped precipitously, and the Kōbun Gakuin was closed. But by then Kanō had built a large house on the estate and arranged his life around it. The Kodokan had expanded dramatically over the years, and after some 27 years of managing it personally, at 47 years of age Kanō arranged for it to be made a foundation in 1909. Its first managing directors were Kanō, who also served as the Foundation’s first head (kanchō), and his close friends Inukai Tsuyoshi (1855-1932), an avid Japanese archer and future Prime Minister when he was assassinated in 1932, and a graduate of his Kanō juku private school. On the steep slope below Kanō’s house and the defunct Kōbun Gakuin, the new Kodokan Foundation headquarters and an adjoining 107-mat dōjō were built, where they remained until 1933.\n\nAfter apparently leasing the land for several years, Kanō eventually bought the entire estate for his private use. At its largest it covered more than 3000 tsubo, a traditional Japanese land measurement, well over 100,000 square feet or about 9300 square meters. But he began to parcel it out, first to the Kodokan, next to close associates including Yamashita Yoshitsugu, who built his home there, then in sales that continued for years.\n\nWhy that neighborhood?\n\nKaiunzaka was only 1.5km (~1 mile) from Kanō’s primary official position at the Tokyo Higher Normal School as its principal and about 3km from the older Shimotomizaka Kodokan dōjō which was redesignated as Daiichi Dōjō, the Number One dōjō. Also, around 1900, the area of north Koishikawa-ku was still sparsely populated with few roads, only recently absorbed into Tokyo proper, and finding such a large parcel of land was still possible. There Kanō could build a large home with a large garden and stable his horses; he kept up to 5 at once. Later new roads nearby supported a rapid increase in the local population as Tokyo expanded. Inside the city, most available large areas had been the Edo era residences of high ranking daimyō, the retainers of the shogun, which reverted to Meiji government control after the 1867 Restoration.\n\nIndeed, the Ōtsuka area occupied by the Tokyo Higher Normal School had been such an Edo daimyō residential compound that reverted to the Meiji government after the Meiji Restoration. The school eventually evolved to become Tsukuba University’s Tokyo Campus (3-29-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo), joined with other schools to form the new Tsukuba University; Kanō’s role in its development is memorialized by a statue of him in the Senshunen Park adjacent to the university. The statue itself is a duplicate of his statue outside the Kodokan.\n\nhttp://soutairoku.com/07_douzou/06_ka/kanou_zigorou.html\n\nI hope you enjoy the presentation.\n\nAs usual, please sign up at the link below to get notices of updates, and all constructive comments will be read and probably answered.\n\nThis weekend I was mentioned by someone in a Judo Facebook group about an unattributed #blackbeltmagazine article citing the most influential women in judo that provided a list of those women and their accomplishments. I suspect being mentioned was to elicit a comment, and, being interested in the best history of judo, I bit.\n\nI don’t read Black Belt magazine regularly but the clamor got me to read that article. Clearly the purpose if not the stated intent of it was to identify living female judoka who competed at the top tier of international competition for years and had an impact on what I call “sport judo”. In other words, today’s top winning competitive female sport judoka. But the first comment was a riposte of sorts to the original article, asking why wasn’t Fukuda Keiko sensei included in that list!?!\n\nThat seemed to be the sense of the majority of the posts thereafter – that any such list must include Fukuda Keiko!!! with lists of claims as to why she should be included.\n\nOne reason oft given claim is one that has always puzzled me:\n\n• She was a direct student of Kanō shihan!!!\n\nIt’s an odd but precise construct that as far as I know has only one meaning in English, implying that she had some special teacher-student relationship with Kanō shihan. But I cannot find evidence of it.\n\nWhile I’m not interested in post Occupation sport judo (particularly the arcane organizational mess that my fellow Americans have made of it) I do have a collection of 21 Japanese essays by Fukuda sensei written for Japanese audiences (I live in Tokyo and try to use only original Japanese sources for my research). After just scanning for 10-15 minutes I found one, written in 1985, in which she makes much of her jūdō education history explicit.\n\nAs background, Kanō shihan was very interested in women’s education and training, including physical education. But little was known in the 19th century or even the interwar years about the impact on the female body of hard physical training, continual impact from ukemi breakfalls, and in part because of that, Kanō, a man with five daughters of his own, took a very conservative yet innovative approach to women’s jūdō training. His solution was to develop a separate Kodokan Women’s Division program and hold all women’s training in a special, dedicated dōjō near his own office. One of the reasons for the later founding of the Association for the Scientific Studies on Judo was to promote medical research into the impact of potentially hazardous jūdō techniques like chokes and throws on young male bodies and, less obviously and unadvertised, female bodies. Access to that special dōjō was granted only with his personal confirmation, and he put his own then 41-year-old daughter, Watanuki Noriko, as the first director of the program overseeing its two senior, older professional male Kodokan jūdō instructors, Handa sensei and Uzawa sensei (see more about them below).\n\nInstruction was initially solely provided by a number of senior male Kodokan instructors, supplemented by Watanuki sensei and later other female instructors as they matured through their own practice and promotions. The instruction was kata and randori training, with the instructors focused on their own specialty kata. Randori was only performed with other females. Kanō instituted the women’s obi belt, which had a white stripe overlaying the base colored belt, to signify that the women were separate. Kanō wrote that as women did not have the brute strength of men, they had to depend upon technique alone, which made their jūdō more pure.\n\nIn her 1985 essay, Fukuda sensei wrote she joined the Suidobashi Kodokan as a student in the Women’s Division. This was in 1935 or 1936. (Also, it sometimes cited that Kanō shihan personally invited her or opened the Kodokan to women because of her. The latter claim is clearly not true. Regarding the former, I have been told by participants who trained under Fukuda sensei that she said Kanō shihan personally invited her to join the Kodokan; I find that entirely believable, as in his incessant proselytization of jūdō he invited untold numbers of young people to join, so certainly the young grandchild of his sensei would be offered the same!)\n\nShe described traveling daily to the Kodokan from Noborito, a station south south east of Tokyo near Kawasaki, on the Odakyu Railroad (a one hour, one-way commute today, perhaps 90-120 minutes then?). The rail line was damaged in World War II air raids, so for some time during the war she stayed with the wife of a Kodokan instructor who lived closer.\n\nIn describing her Kodokan training in the women’s dōjō mentions several famous (and others not well known today) Kodokan instructors, some of whom she studied under, some she wished she had engaged earlier (as she and her sensei had all aged during her near 50 years of her Kodokan membership when she wrote the essay), but she wanted to remember and honor all her sensei, including,\n\n– Nagaoka Shuichi 10th dan\n\n– Kotani Sumiyuki 10th dan\n\nShe had “daily” instruction in the Women’s Division for years from\n\n– Handa Yoshimarō, main instructor\n\n– Uzawa Ariya, instructor\n\nThe late Prof. Kano’s ideal for women’s judo was to study randori in parallel with kata. This randori must be done between women. I was instructed only in this manner for the first ten years of my judo study. Judoists in general spend many hours on randori. Although it is also true in women’s judo, its characteristic is not to neglect kata while placing the importance on randori. This leads to the realistic methods of self-defense. This results in the increase of confidence in their everyday lives. Those who seriously study judo and master a higher degree of kata, may reach the point of acquiring “satori”, comparable to that concept of “spiritual enlightment” in Zen Buddhism, possessing a highly trained physique.*\n\nKeiko Fukuda – Born for the Mat, a Kodokan Kata Textbook for Women, 1973\n\nHanda became a Kanō favorite uke after the retirement of his lifelong partner Yamashita Yoshitsugu 10th dan (1865-1935). Perhaps writing of the very staged kata photos above (I think this likely as the dates roughly align), Fukuda sensei wrote that one day Handa sensei told her he had to pose for photos with Kanō shihan and seemed somewhat exasperated by the request, perhaps as he was then about 65 years old and the choking kata that Kanō demonstrated above are not at all pleasant for uke the person being choked (Kanō was about 75 years old; these are probably the very last photos of Kanō in his keikogi practice uniform, performing any sort of jūdō).\n\nPostwar, Fukuda sensei’s “senpai” (senior) Noritomo Masako returned to practice, apparently after not attending for some time (perhaps because she fled Tokyo after the air raids began, as many other residents of the ravaged city did to avoid the death, destruction, and lack of food).\n\nFukuda sensei wrote of the impact of the WWII fire raid on the Kodokan, including her personally helping fight the fire with buckets of water, the relocation of the dōjō due to fire damage, etc.,\n\n(See my description of the 1945 firebombing of the Kodokan here:\n\nKanō Chronicles: 1945 Firebombing of the Kodokan\n\nI may rewrite it later to add Fukuda sensei’s account, the only firsthand account I know)\n\nIn the 1950s after things had settled down after the Occupation, she approached Mifune Kyuzō (later 10th dan) to teach Kodokan women the same techniques as men.\n\nShe mentioned Kanō shihan twice in this essay:\n\n– He occasionally dropped by the Women’s Division dōjō, and she had the honor of having her practice being watched by him (written in a very specific Japanese idiom to make the honor implicit, but clearly her role was passive: she was being watched practicing, not interacting with Kanō shihan)\n\n– He voiced the desire that judo be promulgated around the world\n\nOne would think if she had been “the direct student” of Kanō shihan, this was the time to point it out. But she did not. Her description was that of any other female Kodokan student of her day and situation, unremarkable from the standard program of a highly dedicated student. This is not a slight against Fukuda sensei – from my research, Kanō shihan simply didn’t ever teach much after his 20s, and from his 30s or so less and less all the time. Certainly into his 60s and 70s he didn’t teach much at all, if any. The professional instructors of the Kodokan attended daily, taught the students daily, and their descriptions of practice sometimes record the increasingly rare appearances, occasional comments, corrections and lectures by Kanō shihan.\n\nBut, as my judo bud Dr. Mike Callan, Professor, University of Hertfordshire points out, there are multiple ways to teach jūdō:\n\n• kata\n\n• randori\n\n• mondō (question and answer)\n\n• kyōgi (lecture)\n\nIf Fukuda sensei attended a particular Kanō lecture or participated in some particular class, she didn’t mention it here. But I’ll keep looking.\n\nThe photo below gives an idea of the scale of Kanō’s formal Kodokan lectures, hardly a special one on one event. But hard to forget.\n\nI’ve never understood trying to gild this particular lily – Fukuda sensei devoted her life, effort and passion to judo, and that should be recognized, commemorated and celebrated, but I really doubt she was a “direct student” of Kanō shihan in any reasonable sense of the term.** She was a dedicated Kodokan student, and the instructors she named were exactly those that taught her and every other female student in the Kodokan Judo Institute of those days.\n\nWhat is much more interesting to me is the series of international trips she took abroad to teach and proselytize judo before she settled down in America.\n\nThat would be interesting history.\n\nNOTES:\n\n* “Those who seriously study judo and master a higher degree of kata,\n\nmay reach the point of acquiring “satori“,\n\ncomparable to that concept of “spiritual enlightment” in Zen Buddhism,\n\npossessing a highly trained physique.”\n\n– Fukuda Keiko, Born for the Mat: A Kodokan Kata Textbook for Women, 1973\n\nThis quote is consistent with otherwise long forgotten comments by Kanō shihan 100 years ago in which he claimed that the embodiment of philosophy in jūdō is so enlightening that faithful, regular practice of its precepts in the dōjō and throughout life outside the dōjō would lead to the same ultimate level of enlightenment, satori, as practicing zazen seated Zen meditation for years cited in my long paper regarding the evolution of Kanō’s jūdō philosophies, an early version of which I presented to the American Philosophical Association in 2021 and can be read here: https://kanochronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gatling-apa-paper-2021-origins-of-the-principles-of-judo-final.pdf ).\n\nIn my experience, only a handful of Kodokan students knew of this concept\n\n** Kanō shihan did have “direct students” but only noted when he was much younger; we know what that looked like. Outside of the Kodokan, in the late 1800s in self-designed experiments to test the abilities of female students, he taught his wife Sumako, some of her friends, and a couple of female cousins and nieces.\n\nKanō also in secret taught the very interesting Shimoda Utako, a pioneering female educator and long term colleague. Around 1891, Kanō and Shimoda were rumored to be linked romantically (in fact, in the most diplomatic terms possible, the young widow and proto-feminist Shimoda was rumored by political opponents to be particularly sexually promiscuous, accused of having slept with most key members of the conservative government, men with whom Kanō was closely aligned). Once a major newspaper reported that the two had married without notice – only to issue a retraction days later. (I cannot determine if the news was in error or if Kanō and Shimoda married then divorced.)\n\nIn fact, it was a student of Shimoda sensei that in 1906 taught jūdō to the first US Embassy Tokyo jūdō students (my dōjō carries on that 120 year old tradition: US Embassy Judo Club http://www.usejc.org, Facebook http://www.facebook.com/usejc ), one the daughter of a diplomat, and another the wife of then US Army Captain John “Blackjack” Pershing, the US Army military attache to Tokyo. Pershing was later General of the Armies and commander of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I.\n\nKanō became increasingly frail in his 70’s (1930-1938) as old age and decades of chronic diabetes took their toll. By 1936, when Fukuda Keiko entered the Kodokan, Kanō, suffering from advanced diabetes and only able to walk with difficulty, was hardly in physical condition to teach jūdō in any conventional sense. He was also incredibly busy with his duties as an influential Emperor-nominated, lifetime member of Japan’s House of Lords, and supporting Tokyo’s bid and preparation for the 1940 Olympics. By the 1930s his visits to the Kodokan were so sporadic that they were typically noted in the Kodokan Diary column in Judo magazine, indicating, at least to me, such visits were not at all regular events, much less daily.\n\nThe photo below was taken in Vancouver, Canada, April 1938, just hours before Kanō embarked upon the Japanese ultra-luxury NYK passenger liner Hikawa Maru bound for Yokohama, upon which he died days later of pneumonia, almost certainly brought on by his 40 year affliction with diabetes (which, if so, that ice cream cone certainly would have exacerbated).\n\nIn embarking on his last exhausting around the world trip in early February 1938, Kanō ignored advice from his doctor not to travel at all, and even refused to allow a traveling companion, thus traveling alone. One issei first generation Japanese immigrant to America who met him during the last weeks of that trip and personally spent days driving Kanō sightseeing and to various meetings wrote in a letter to Japan that he was enraged and embarrassed that his own people, the Japanese, would treat the aged, clearly ill, seriously weakened Kanō so callously as to send him around the world on a grueling months long trip alone, and was concerned the trip would kill him.\n\nIt did kill him.\n\nDespite rumors that Kanō was poisoned by political enemies for his antiwar stance, his last days on the Hikawa Maru, the pride of the Japanese Pacific Ocean luxury fleet, are fairly well documented. He was the personal guest of the ship’s captain invited to dine at the prestigious captain’s table at every meal (most attendees rotate every meal through the elite of the passengers), a signal honor which placed him squarely in the public eye at least three times a day for the entire voyage; the captain was also later interviewed by the Japanese press about his VIP guest’s time on the ship and death. Also, a young Gaimusho Foreign Ministry diplomat returning to Japan on the same voyage observed, spoke with and dined with Kanō several times wrote of Kanō’s apparent illness, increasing frailty but continued characteristic stubbornness – Kanō insisted on dressing for every meal and joining the table of the captain, who time and again urged Kanō to remain in his cabin and rest instead, offering the ship’s crew and the steward to assist him and serve him any meals he wanted in the comfort of his cabin.\n\nThe morning of Wednesday, May 4, 1938, (local ship time: May 5 in Tokyo time, which is the date of death noted today) he died, attended by a steward and the ship’s medic, death confirmed by the captain. Cause: pneumonia.\n\nThe captain radioed the sad news to Tokyo:\n\nRegretfully (he) entered eternal sleep this morning 6:33\n\nWhen the Hikawa Maru arrived at Yokohama Friday, May 6, its normal quarantine was cut short and the ship was allowed to dock immediately.\n\nThe Emperor Hirohito dispatched the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, his personal secretary, to meet the ship and escort Kanō to his home in his massive compound in Ōtsuka, Bunkyō-ku, his casket draped in the Olympic flag.\n\nToday his cabin is marked with a brass plaque noting his name and the date of his death on the Hikawa Maru, which is on permanent display as a museum ship in Yokohama at Yamashita Park, near Yokohama Station.\n\n##\n\nPlease type your email in the block below and hit Subscribe to be notified of new material.\n\n– I have a number of new essays in draft and there may be something of interest among them.

Note that all 3 links start at different times in the same video, so you can just start with the first and watch all the wary through; the entire video is 7:33 minutes long. It was apparently filmed in Tokyo, and almost certainly during the early to mid 1950s, when Mr. Mel Bruno made several trips to Tokyo to coordinate then monitor the Strategic Air Command (SAC) Combatives Course coordinated, hosted and taught at the Kodokan that introduced jūdō, karatedō, aikidō and police taihōjutsu (arresting techniques) to the US Air Force and from there to the world.\n\n• Shimizu Takeji sensei blocking armed and unarmed attacks by Mr. Mel Bruno of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command with jōjutsu, circa mid-1950s.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhvQMWxu1yk\n\n• Shimizu sensei demonstrating the basic Shintō Musō ryū jōdō kata (“forms”) against an attacking opponent armed with a sword. (NOTE: in this usage either Shintō or Shindō is correct; both are commonly used.)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IhvQMWxu1yk?t=156\n\n• Unnamed members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police demonstrating police jō techniques. Note that they are demonstrating both crowd control (holding or guiding crowds) and attack / defense techniques.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IhvQMWxu1yk?t=301\n\nThe jō staff is a common weapon in many Japanese ryūha martial art schools, and ubiquitously wielded by Japanese riot police and police guarding police stations or other facilities, in uniform or in plain clothes.\n\nStaffs come in a near infinite variety of lengths and thicknesses with a bewildering number of names, but in the past several decades their various names have become more or less standardized through the popularity of Shintō Musō ryū jōdō (literally “The Way of the Gods-Dream Inspired School Staff Way”, abbreviated SMR by its aficionados.) There are some vague conventions that can be proposed regarding the terms. Here is a list for casual reference, which should certainly not be considered authoritative.\n\n• Tsue, sutekki, or tanjō – in the early Meiji era, the term tsue came to be used for a cane, a ステッキ sutekki was a “walking stick”, while tanjō means “short jō”, usually around 1 meter / 39 inches in length. The near ubiquitous Victorian gentleman’s walking stick was adopted by many Japanese, particularly former samurai recently deprived of their traditional right to carry the daishō two-sword set. In those times of political and criminal violence, the legal-to-carry cane became a useful weapon for self-defense, and also not infrequently used to conceal highly illegal sword cane blades. Minister of Education Mori Arinori’s assassin, Kanō’s jūdō student Nishino Buntarō, was nearly decapitated by Mori’s bodyguard using an illegal sword cane. (The former samurai bodyguard was tried for the murder of Nishino but exonerated.)\n\nKanō was almost certainly aware of the use of canes in martial arts self defense in the later 1800s. The famous swordsman and ultranationalist Genyōsha member Uchida Ryōgorō developed an entire series of tsue versus sword techniques eventually called Uchida ryū tanjōjutsu using a 90 centimeter long straight stick; supposedly he was set upon by two political opponents armed with illegal swords and he barely survived, and developed the techniques to defend himself from such an attack. Years later his art was absorbed into the SMR jōdō curriculum and is still taught today to advanced students.\n\n• Jō – an alternate reading for 杖 tsue, meaning stick or staff. Because of the prevalence of SMR jōdō, the definition used by multiple SMR jōdō associations describe a standard 127 centimeter / 50 inch round staff, traditionally made of Japanese white oak. The traditional Japanese length is 4 shaku 2 sun 1 bu (127 cm / 50 inch) with an 8 bu (24 mm) round diameter. Some schools use thicker jō of the same length.\n\nSMR jōdō associations make allowances for shorter practitioners to shorten their jō to accommodate the full length techniques in the kata repertoire, but there are no longer jō for taller practitioners. In some classic jō schools, the proper length is measured from the floor to the armpit of each individual practitioner, while in other schools jō are as long as 180 centimeters or more.\n\n(Just to confuse things further, the staff used in the modern Kodokan Goshin Jutsu “Self Defense Techniques” series compiled in the 1950s is 1 meter / 39 inches long, but is called a jō by jūdōka.)\n\n• Bō – while less specific, this is often taken to mean a roku shaku bō, a 6 shaku or 182 centimeter / 6 foot 1 inch long staff or cudgel. In modern days these are usually round, but may be hexagonal, which focuses the force of strikes into a smaller, sharper angle. Some of the larger bō and other staffs may be bound with shrink-fit iron rings to strengthen the wooden shafts and add mass for more destructive blows.\n\nThe legendary origin tales of bō schools sometimes entail some warrior’s losing the blade of his yari spear or naginata halberd in battle and having to fight with just the remaining wooden staff.\n\nThe primary introduction of SMR jōdō to Tokyo was by Fukuoka martial artist Shimizu Takaji 清水隆次 (1896–1978). Shimizu sensei was a senior Shintō Musō Ryū jōdō instructor, closely associated with the Genyōsha ultranationalist group and its dōjō, the Genbukan, where a number of koryū bujutsu ancient martial arts, including jūjutsu and jōjutsu, and, later, jūdō were and are still taught.\n\nDuring the long Tokugawa era, the city of Fukuoka was the crown jewel of the Kuroda han feudal domain / fiefdom. While almost all han had a range of martial arts taught to its young samurai as part of their education as professional warriors, many of those schools were common across Japan and there was substantial cross training and exchanges between the different sites of the same schools, in particular in the dōjō of Edo. But in some instances the han would designate a particular martial arts schools as its 御留流 otome ryū, a martial art designated for the sole use of the han that was never to be shown to outsiders. Normally those designated as otome ryū were kenjutsu sword arts, as a surprise, proprietary, novel technique could win a desperate battle against a more conventionally trained swordsman opponent, but, according to the lore imparted (without evidence, it appears) by Shimizu sensei and other Shintō Musō ryū instructors since, uniquely the Fukuda han designated Shintō Musō ryū jōjutsu as an otome ryū. So, while many koryū bujutsu ancient martial arts included jō or bō techniques, there is no other known example of a jō school being so designated. (It is beyond the scope of this essay to explore the claim, but it is fun to convey the unique tale.)\n\nShimizu sensei studied other arts but focused on SMR jō and its associated minor arts: kusarigama sickle and weight on chain or rope, juttejutsu small cudgel, and hojōjutsu rope binding. Beyond the basic one-man drills, the paired SMR kata pits a jō armed practitioner defending against a series of complex attacks from an opponent armed with a sword. The longer jō allows a skilled user to check or attack the swordsman at will, using its longer reach to block the sword (or even to bend or break inferior blades), to inflict precise blows to fracture wrist, ribs or collarbones, to thrust to blind the eyes, to stun or kill with deadly blows to the temple, or, in the specialty of the school, exert hard thrusts and checks to the solar plexus to create a temporary paralysis of the attacking swordsman’s diaphragm and thus render him unable to breathe.\n\nShimizu sensei was invited to present SMR jōdō at a March 1926 Tokyo Metropolitan Police enbu martial arts demonstration given in honor of comrades fallen in service. His demonstration, given with another Fukuoka martial artist, was an immediate sensation, and he was asked to move to Tokyo to teach SMR jōdō. Some time later, he moved to Tokyo and began teaching SMR jōdō. Within a short time he was teaching multiple groups from the Boy Scouts and soon to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, (Morikawa T, 1961) one of the most influential martial arts body in Japan.\n\nShimizu caught the attention of Kanō shihan who hired him to teach at the Kodokan beginning 1931; Shimizu sensei mentions teaching “year to year” until the end of World War II, apparently meaning he was engaged as an outside, contracted instructor rather than joining the Kodokan staff like Heki sensei. (Morikawa T, 1961)\n\nBy the mid 1930s, for several years Kanō had explored the jō as an auxiliary weapon to fill the deficiencies of how jūdō can counter armed opponents. Beyond its practicality in exercise and self-defense, jō is also an excellent training in the judgement and use of maai, spacing between antagonists. In 1935, Kanō shihan introduced the new “Kodokan bōjutsu department” in Judo magazine.\n\nIn later issues of Judo magazine in 1936 and 1937, the Heki Ryusuke (EN1), Kanō mentioned was an “instructor with the Kodokan Bōjutsu Kenkyū Bu” (bō technique research division). He wrote a series of essays on Kodokan bōjutsu published every two months or so, beginning in March, 1936 with the essay Bōjutsu no Shugyō Hōhō (“Methods of Intense Study of Bō Techniques”). Essentially that series provides an introduction to Kodokan bōjutsu courtesies, then solo techniques and paired kata; overall it looks very similar to the modern SMR jōdō seitei kata standard forms, which can be seen in the Shimizu sensei video above.\n\nKagoshima native Heki sensei studied Kagoshima’s classic Jigen ryū Kenpō sword style as a child. He joined the Imperial Japanese Navy as an enlisted man and became a combat veteran, leaving the service in 1923. Kodokan managing director / jūdōka / former IJN Rear Admiral Honda Chikatami, who apparently knew Heki from his days in the Navy, recruited him into the administrative department. Heki graduated from the Kodokan’s elementary school jūdō instructor development training program, and somewhere along the way learned jōdō. (Honda C, 1944)\n\nLeading by personal example, Kanō shihan was noted to be an early and enthusiastic practitioner of jōdō, but by 1935, the 75 year old’s chronic diabetes and subsequent circulation problems in his legs severely limited his mobility.\n\nIn March 1936, Kanō invited Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, the third International Olympic President and a number of other IOC members, in Japan to study Tokyo’s bid for the 1940 Games, to the Kodokan, where the demonstrations provided included bōjutsu. (Yokoyama K, 1943)\n\nAfter Kanō’s death in May 1938, the Kodokan’s 1943 five year memorial service featured a large group of Kodokan students and instructors demonstrating Kodokan bōjutsu.\n\nHeki sensei died February 1944. During the Occupation and efforts to overturn the school budō ban, which put all public school jūdō instructors out of work, without fanfare Kodokan bōjutsu was abandoned.\n\nEarly in the Occupation police jō instruction was suspended as General Headquarters authorities directed the Japanese government to limit its use, as some of the GHQ staff, many of whom were civilian, liberal academics and lawyers before joining the war effort, were concerned about the injuries inflicted on some of the many leftist and rightist demonstrators and rioters in the postwar chaos by jō-wielding police. Despite that suspension, in 1949 the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Guard Force of around 300 fit, accomplished police martial artists trained by Shimizu sensei and armed with jō and keibō police batons was deployed against a large group demonstrating against the new Public Safety Ordnance that limited public assembly and protests. The Special Guard Force wielded their jō with particular enthusiasm that day, injuring many demonstrators and arresting 46.\n\nGHQ responded by directing the Japanese government to outlaw the use of the jō completely, limiting the police to wield much shorter keibō police batons only. (Japan Wiki, keijo). But those soon proved unsuitable for controlling large crowds of rioters, some armed with cudgels and bats much longer than the police batons. Eventually the decision was made to allow the police to train correctly in more detailed and disciplined jō techniques, leading to the crowd control and measured, controlled strikes and thrusts shown in the video above. After better training, a number of reorganizations, and better integration with the police command and control, in 1957 a portion of the Police Reserves were redesignated as Kidōtai, Mobile Force units. Those highly trained, disciplined public safety force, organized as nine units based in Tokyo, Osaka, and other key cities, still occasionally carries the jō today along with more modern crowd control equipment. (Japan Wiki, Keishichoyobitai) But in reality, today the jō is more of a training device or symbol of authority hinting of potential violence more than used as mainstay riot control equipment.\n\nDespite the Kodokan dropping jō training, Shimizu sensei went from strength to strength. He was soon busy teaching the postwar Tokyo Metropolitan Police and civilians all over Japan in the art of Shintō Musō ryū jōdō, now practiced around the world. After his death in 1978, jōdō splintered into several organizations as he never designated a successor or had a viable organization that could survive on its own.\n\nOne of the organizations that incorporated jōdō was the All Japan Kendo Federation, the kendō counterpart to the new All Japan Judo Federation. The AJKF was established in 1952 in the vacuum left by the banishment and dissolution of the Dainihon Butokukai, the Greater Japan Martial Virtues Society, which had been the pre-Occupation, national level capstone martial arts and kendō organization, which used its broad base of kendō aficionados (perpetually some 4-5 times more numerous than jūdō players in Japan) to introduce the ancient art of the jō to new generations.\n\nKanō shihan had been proven right; like him, but decades later, one of Japan’s largest budō organizations in Japan also recognized the value of jōdō, absorbed it, and taught it throughout Japan, and later, the world.\n\nLater in a separate essay we’ll disclose the ultimate plan of Kanō shihan – to absorb not only jō but also kendō into the Kodokan as subsidiary arts of jūdō, and how close he actually came.\n\n##\n\nEnd notes:\n\nEN1 – The jōdō instructor’s name in Japanese is 日置隆介. His family name can be read Heki or Hioki, but as is commonly the case, how it is properly read is not specified in scores of appearances of his name in Judo magazine. The author chose to use the pronunciation Heki to coincide with the Heki ryū martial archery school that uses the same kanji.\n\nBibliography –\n\nHonda C, 1944, “Heki kun wo Tsuisosu”, in Judo, vol. 15, no. 4, Tokyo, Kodokan Bunka Kai.\n\nKano J, 1935, “Kodokan ga Yushi ni Bojutsu wo Renshu Seshimuro ni Satta Riyu”, in Judo vol. 6, no. 4, Tokyo, Kodokan Bunka Kai.\n\nMorikawa T, 1961, “Shintō Musō Ryū o Tazenete”,\n\nin Sho Daimyō Hatamoto Okumuki Hisshi, special edition of\n\nKengō Retsudenshū No. 66, Tokyo, Futabasha, October 1961.\n\nWiki Japan, Keijo, Police Jo, https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AD%A6%E6%9D%96 accessed March 22, 2023.\n\nWiki Japan, Keishicho Yobitai, Police Reserve Force, https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AD%A6%E8%A6%96%E5%BA%81%E4%BA%88%E5%82%99%E9%9A%8A, accessed March 22, 2023.\n\nYokoyama K, 1943, Nihon Budo Shi, Tokyo, Sanshodo.\n\n________\n\nMany thanks to Mr. Robert Gruzanski and his great True-Flyte Martial Arts Memorial Website commemorating the pioneering Japanese martial arts research of his father, Mr. Charles Gruzanski and for featuring the above article by Morikawa Tetsurō, which was very enlightening regarding Shimizu sensei’s history.\n\nhttp://www.robertg.com\n\nAsian philosophy budo china Chinese philosophy Chinese students dojo dracula education history japan japanese history jigoro-kano jiujutsu judo judo jujutsu japanese history japan jujitsu kano kodokan budo bushido kano jigoro judo philosophy jujutsu Kano Jigoro keiko-fukuda Kobun Gakuin Kodokan Kodokan judo land use martial arts martial arts philosophy meiji japan history most valuable martial art philosophy principle of flexibility Seiryoku Zenyo Jita Kyoei Three Strategies tokyo womens-judo 三略 哲学 嘉納治五郎 柔の理 柔術 柔道 柔道哲学 武術 武道 講道館柔道 黃石公三略\n\n## ##\n\nKanō Jigorō’s calligraphies are well documented. He was fairly prolific, writing various sayings he adopted for jūdō instruction, usually in a very distinct hand with a block-type script.\n\nRecently I found a heretofore a calligraphy unmentioned by Kanō scholars and archivists in an obscure book published in the 1920s. I found it interesting enough to research it a bit and translate it from the original Chinese over two millennia old.\n\nWhile Kanō wrote top to bottom / right to left, the original text can be grouped left to right top to bottom as:\n\n道雖近\n\n不行不至\n\n事雖小\n\n不為不成\n\nEven if the Way is near,\n\nnot going –\n\nyou cannot arrive;\n\neven small matters,\n\nnot doing –\n\nremain incomplete.\n\nA possible alternate translation:\n\nAlthough the Dào is near,\n\nit cannot be traveled without traveling;\n\nalthough a matter is small,\n\nit cannot be done without doing.\n\nMy interpretation is that Kanō creates an admonition to action – to move, to do, to practice in pursuit of self-cultivation. Don’t just consider the Way, move yourself to travel it despite the hardships involved (the chapter cites many hardships).\n\nThe text is an extract from the writings of Xunzi 荀子 (JA: Junshi, 3rd century BCE), one of the most famous Confucian philosophers. The specific context is the book 脩身 Xiūshēn “Self Cultivation”, which emphasizes that a “gentleman” (i.e., a well-educated, moral, upstanding person) should act according to 礼 rei (CH: li).\n\n“Wing-tsit Chan explains that 礼 rei / li originally meant “a religious sacrifice, but has come to mean ceremony, ritual, decorum, rules of propriety, good form, good custom, etc., and has even been equated with natural law.”[1] (English Wiki: “Li” Confucianism )\n\nXunzi 荀子 脩身 Xiūshēn “Self Cultivation”, Chapter 8 complete:\n\n夫驥一日而千里，駑馬十駕，則亦及之矣。將以窮無窮，逐無極與？其折骨絕筋，終身不可以相及也。將有所止之，則千里雖遠，亦或遲、或速、或先、或後，胡為乎其不可以相及也！不識步道者，將以窮無窮，逐無極與？意亦有所止之與？夫「堅白」、「同異」、「有厚無厚」之察，非不察也，然而君子不辯，止之也。倚魁之行，非不難也，然而君子不行，止之也。故學曰遲。彼止而待我，我行而就之，則亦或遲、或速、或先、或後，胡為乎其不可以同至也！故蹞步而不休，跛鱉千里；累土而不輟，丘山崇成。厭其源，開其瀆，江河可竭。一進一退，一左一右，六驥不致。彼人之才性之相縣也，豈若跛鱉之與六驥足哉！然而跛鱉致之，六驥不致，是無它故焉，或為之，或不為爾！\n\n道雖邇，不行不至；事雖小，不為不成。\n\n其為人也多暇日者，其出入不遠矣。\n\nIn the middle of the text for Chapter 8, Xunzi cites the Dàoist binaries\n\n「堅白」、「同異」and「有厚無厚」.\n\n「堅白」Jiān bai – hard / white.\n\n「同異」Tóng yì – Alike / unalike\n\n「有厚無厚」Yǒu hòu wú hòu – Profound / superficial\n\nJiān bai hard / white is a strange couple, one that is not the normal statement of opposites (e.g., Yin / Yang, hot / cold, hard / soft). It is a couple used in earlier Mohist, Dàoist (including Zhuangzi) and even ancient School of Names texts to both introduce sophistry and to criticize sophists who would argue what is hardness, what is white? What is sameness and not sameness? But it apparently over the ages it eventually became a sort of shorthand for “Speaking directly and clearly / speaking to obfuscate” or wasting time and effort in sophistry.\n\nSubscribe above with your email to get automatic updates of new material!\n\nComments welcome! See entry block at the end of Notes.\n\nNotes:\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/xunzi/ accessed 2023/06/22\n\nXunzi 荀子 (third century BCE) was a Confucian philosopher, sometimes reckoned as the third of the three great classical Confucians (after Confucius and Mencius). For most of imperial Chinese history, however, Xunzi was a bête noire who was typically cited as an example of a Confucian who went astray by rejecting Mencian convictions. Only in the last few decades has Xunzi been widely recognized as one of China’s greatest thinkers.\n\nWhile Xunzi is not included in the normal, basic Chinese classics education that Kanō began at 6 or 7 years of age, which focuses on the 四書五経 Shisho Gokyō The Four Books and the Five Classics, he later studied at what is today Nishogakusha University, at the time a juku private school focused on ancient Chinese texts. (The Five Classics: Book of Odes, Book of Documents, Book of Changes, Book of Rites, and the Spring and Autumn Annals. The Four Books: the Doctrine of the Mean, the Great Learning, Mencius, and the Analects, the core books of the Confucian canon.)\n\nAs always, I use the fabulous Chinese Text Project http://www.ctext.org to research the ancient texts. “The Chinese Text Project is an online open-access digital library that makes pre-modern Chinese texts available to readers and researchers all around the world. The site attempts to make use of the digital medium to explore new ways of interacting with these texts that are not possible in print. With over thirty thousand titles and more than five billion characters, the Chinese Text Project is also the largest database of pre-modern Chinese texts in existence.”\n\nOn this calligraphy, Kanō shihan’s pen name is written by the three small vertical characters on the far left of the scroll, 進乎斎 followed below by two seals stamped in black ink (this may be a black and white photo with the original seals in red, the normal convention).\n\n「進乎斎」Shinkosai, used in this calligraphy, was Kanō’s pen name in his 60’s, namely 1920 to 1930. 進乎斎 Shinkosai is thought to be a reference to certain writings of 莊子 Zhūangzi (Chinese for “Master Zhūang”, Japanese: Sōshi), one of the most influential philosophers of the Dào (Chinese: Dào 道 , Japanese: Dō, often earlier in the West as Tao), “The Way”, active during China’s Warring States period [350 BC-250 BC]. Shinko 進乎 (progress) appears in two noted passages of his most important text, the Zhūangzi, one of the two foundational Daoist texts along with the Dào De Jing. The sai 斎 of Shinkosai is an old Japanese variant of the traditional Chinese character 齋 zhāi (simplified today as 斋) which means “to fast” or “study”, so Shinkosai means something like “progress through fasting”. In this sense “fasting” means the Dàoist discipline of focusing the spirit to learn the Way and the true nature of things by isolating the spirit from the distractions of perceptions of the physical world (represented by “hearing”), emotions and thought. (Handler S, 2022 communication).\n\nThe Zhūangzhi chapter thought to be the source of Kanō’s pen name is the 2500 year old Dàoist tale of a master butcher. Lord Wen-hui, captivated by the evident skill of the Butcher Ding (in some translations Ting), asked how Ding can so effortlessly butcher entire oxen.\n\nCook Ding replied that he only cared about the Way, which exceeded skill. But when he first began butchering oxen, all he could see was the ox. After three years he no longer saw the whole ox. Finally, he said, he proceeded by spirit alone and didn’t even look with his eyes. His skill was so effortless and insight so powerful that he never even had to sharpen his blade, using the same one for years, and the ox carcasses simply fell apart under his blade. Perception and understanding had stopped and he had proceeded to the point that his spirit moved where it wanted (Watson B, 2013), meaning it was in accordance with the Way of the Dao.\n\nWhat I think Kanō meant by adopting such a pen name in his 60’s was that he was proclaiming he, too, had progressed beyond mere perception and thought and had learned to only seek the Way through his spirit. Even though Kanō paid tribute to Japanese tradition and nearly 2500 year old Dàoist thought by his choice of a pen name rooted in an ancient text, for Kanō the Way he sought to follow was not the Way of the Dào, but rather the Way of jūdō, which means “The Way of Flexibility.” Kanō defined that Way in part through the phrases 精力善用自他共栄 Seiryoku Zenyō Jita Kyōei, Best Use of Energy / Mutual Benefit, the modern jūdō philosophies he derived from the late 19th century writings of Herbert Spencer and other English Utilitarian philosophers he studied at the then new Tokyo University in his youth. (Gatling L, 2021)\n\nKanō was saying that he no longer needed perception of the physical world (hearing or seeing) or thought (knowledge or emotion) to employ the techniques that initially guided his pursuit of his Way, but now sought to proceed through the understanding and learning of his spirit alone. Having practiced for so many years, he could proceed simply by keeping his spirit focused on the Way. Without conscious thought he could accomplish the smaller things addressed by his perceptions and mind, honed by years of constant training and attentive practice of the Way of jūdō. He no longer saw people and situations, but looked beyond them to see the Way. In this he equated his understanding and skills with that of the estimable Butcher Ding.\n\nThis is not a surprise, given Kanō’s belief that dedicated study of jūdō could provide a level of 悟 satori enlightenment equal to that to be gained through intensely practicing 座禅 zazen seated Zen mediation for a decade or more. (Gatling L, 2022)\n\n##\n\nMany times I have been asked about ki 気 (pre World War II old style character: 氣) in jūdō 柔道 and other Japanese martial arts. In no way am I an expert on the matter, having practiced aikidō 合気道 only intermittently for a few years. My quest to understand it seemed pretty much hopeless when I tried seriously to learn later in life, at least given the typically amused reaction of my last instructor, the marvelous Inoue Kyōichi (井上 強一, 1935-2017, 10th dan Aikido, retired chief of instruction at the Yoshinkan), who often laughed aloud and said “Use aiki!! aiki to defeat them, not jūjutsu!!! None of your jūdō here, please!!” in response to my frustrated attempts to micmic his magic on the mats with opponents. They usually ended up off-balanced and thrown one way or the other, aiki or not, but it wasn’t necessarily a decent replica of his superb technique.\n\nMy early attempts to read up on ki from typical English language aikidō aficionado sources were bewildering. They ranged from frankly disjointed, unintelligible esoterica to serious attempts to describe something that seemed seriously indescribable.\n\nYears later I began to read Confucian and Dàoist texts, first in English, then increasingly in modern Japanese, then in classic Chinese (with the assistance of excellent English translations by scholars whose works will live forever; thank you, Mr. Legge!)\n\nEventually, ki began to make some sense once I had some context for it. I asked myself, was explaining ki without some background simply too foreign a concept for an Arkansas farm boy from the 1950s? My first brush with Eastern philosophy was an all-too brief introduction in West Point, then a more serious dive in an East Asia area studies master’s program. There I realized that the basic philosophic underpinnings of China, Korea and Japan were truly foreign, and if I wanted to understand them, I had to get serious about reading up on them. A lot.\n\nBut later, far later than I wished, I found a remarkable text that I recommend to anyone interested in Japanese culture.\n\nJapanese economics professor Dr. Michio Morishima (1923-2004) lectured at the London School of Economics, including introductory courses on the Japanese economy. According to his book Why Has Japan ‘Succeeded’? Western Technology and the Japanese Ethos (Morishima M, Why Has Japan ‘Succeeded’?, Cambridge University Press, 1982), as his (presumably primarily non-Japanese, non-Asian) students could not understand his economic lessons because of their complete lack of background regarding Japan’s philosophical and cultural milieu. He began to give short cultural and philosophical introductory lectures, and finally combined them into this remarkable book. Its cultural / philosophical historical introduction of Japan is the best I’ve seen in decades of reading, and is well worth the price despite it being only a small portion of the book, which is primarily an economic history (in fact, I can’t recall ever reading the entire book). A copy of it is available on the internet.\n\nThe book became my Rosetta Stone for Japanese culture, deftly explaining its melange of ancient Confucianism 儒教, Dàoism 道教 and Buddhism 仏教 with a modern constitutional monarchy and a representative democracy. Many people have thanked me for introducing it. But it works because Professor Morishima was knowledgable in multiple disciplines and able to present them to his students in a coherent, intelligible text, a man who could carve out a cultural Rosetta Stone using elements from multiple diverse sources – history, understanding of the impacts of ancient Eastern philosophies and their collisions with Western culture, and modern Japan’s unique history.\n\nUchida Ryōhei was such a man for jūdō.\n\nUchida Ryōhei 内田良平 (1873-1937) was an ultranationalist political theorist, Pan-Asianist, and martial artist, active in the pre-war Empire of Japan. (Wiki)\n\nHe was also an accomplished jūdōka, a favorite of Kanō shihan 師範 (master), one of the three most senior 5th dan rank holders in Kodokan history, and a noted street brawler. At the time of his prime, the early 1900s, there was a saying in the Kodokan:\n\nWhen it comes to real fighting,\n\nno one stands to the right of Uchida Ryōhei!\n\n(Meaning: there was no one superior to Uchida in real fighting because in jūdō courtesies, senior students stand to the right.)\n\nUchida was born in 1873, the 6th year of the new Meiji era in Fukuoka, son of former samurai Uchida Ryōgorō who was a noted martial artist (teaching Shintō Musō Ryū jōdō 神道夢想流杖道and the inventor of Uchida Ryū tanjōjutsu 内田流短杖術), political hardliner and brawler, and ultranationalist organization Genyōsha founding member. When he was merely a teen, Uchida likely met Kanō shihan in the middle of the biggest political riot in Japanese history (a tale told herein later).\n\nUchida begin his classic education from childhood, studying the Chinese classics, the Four Books and the Five Classics 四書五経 , the foundational texts of Confucianism 儒教, in their original classic Chinese over 2000 years old. He learned a number of martial arts, most notably Jigō Tenshin Ryū Jūjutsu in Fukuoka’s Meidokan dōjō, an art in which he was notably successful. In 1893 he moved to Tokyo to live with his wealthy coal mine owner uncle Hiraoka Kōtarō, a supporter of the Genyōsha, and began to study Russian at a Tokyo school and jūdō at Kanō Jigorō’s Kodokan.\n\nOver the next 20 years Uchida, moving throughout East Asia from Singapore to Shanghai to Seoul to Vladivostok, acted as spy and spymaster, cartographer, correspondent with Kanō shihan, agent provocateur and supporter of Korea’s 1894 Donghak Rebellion and China’s 1911 Xinhai Revolution, and supporter of Japanese forces in the Russo-Japanese War. As an Imperial Army reservist, he was recalled to active duty in 1894 for the Sino-Japanese War but because he was already in Korea agitating and assisting Korean revolutionaries’ combat against the Korean regime and Chinese garrison, by the time he returned weeks later to his assembly point in Fukuoka in accordance with his orders, his infantry regiment had already deployed to Manchuria, so he after a couple of weeks of sitting around doing nothing (something soldiers everywhere know very well!) he was released from active duty. In 1901 he established the Kokuryūkai, literally, the Black Dragon Society, which became the bête noire of half-informed Western intelligence and lurid press accounts that assessed it as the most dangerous and influential ultranationalist organization in the Imperial Empire, even exceeding his father’s Genyōsha.\n\nOver four decades Uchida became one of the most influential voices on Japan’s far right, a key leader of one of the ultranationalist, expansionist, Imperialist political pressure groups that propelled Japan on its ultimately doomed mission to control East Asia and suicidally confront the most powerful national forces around the planet. Well before his death in 1937, few men on the ultra-right were held in higher regarding, notably including his mentor and senior Genyōsha member and close friend of his father, Tōyama Mitsuru, the ultranationalist éminence grise, ultimate behind-the-scenes fixer and assassin – and Kanō patron (another tale to be told later).\n\nBut Uchida was also a very dedicated martial artist. Because of his prowess as a young man, he was quickly promoted, becoming the third most senior 5th dan in Kodokan history. He wrote one of the two earliest jūdō books, in which Kanō provided a foreword praising Uchida’s fighting prowess and understanding of jūdō and its history. Later he wrote other books on other Japanese budō.\n\nIn 1925 he published his magnum opus on the martial arts, Budō Gokui, 武道極意 The Secrets of Martial Arts. (Uchida R, Budo Gokui, Tokyo: Kokuryukai Shuppanbu, 1925.) In Chapter 24, entitled 柔能く剛を制す Jū yoku wo Gō Seisu, The Flexible Controls the Rigid, Uchida launched his discussion of ki from the heart of the very definition of jūjutsu.\n\nTo understand the background, the legend taught for hundreds of years in Japan even until today is that the term jū 柔 in jūjutsu 柔術 comes from an ancient Chinese military strategy text, The Three Strategies of Huang Shigong, 黄石公三略 (Chinese Pinyin: Huáng Shígōng Sānlüè – “The Three Strategies of Duke Yellowstone”) one of China’s Seven Military Classics, thought to date from around 200 BC to 0 CE.\n\nThe primary saying that is used to describe the core philosophy of jūjutsu is the four-character idiomatic phrase that is the first line of the Upper Strategy 上略 of the Three Strategies.\n\nJū nō sei gō 柔能制剛\n\nThe flexible controls the rigid.\n\n(More often seen today in English is the term “Softness overcomes strength”, but the author prefers flexibility – see Endnotes).\n\nThe original classic Chinese complete text of the Upper Strategy reads:\n\n「軍識曰、柔能制剛、弱能制強。柔者徳也、剛者賊也。 弱者人之所助、強者怨之所攻。\n\n柔有所設、剛有所施、 弱有所用、強有所加。兼此四者、而制其。」\n\nThe Three Strategies text is a masterpiece of early Dàoist thought. This section provides a list of dualities, Yin Yang 陰陽 (JA: In’yō) binaries that compromise its “strategy”; flexible / rigid, weak / strong, assistance / opposition, virtues / faults, and the admonition to use each in the appropriate measure and time. It quotes an apocryphal, even more ancient text is calls the 軍讖曰 The Military Wisdom.\n\nDivided into phrases and translated into English, it reads:\n\n軍讖曰 The Military Wisdom cites:\n\n柔能制剛 Flexibility controls hardness,\n\n弱能制強 weakness controls strength.\n\n柔者徳也 The gentle have virtues also,\n\n剛者賊也 the unyielding also have faults.\n\n弱者人之所助 The weak attract assistance,\n\n強者怨之所攻 the strong attract opposition.\n\n柔有所設 At times be flexible,\n\n剛有所施 at times have hardness,\n\n弱有所用 at times use weakness,\n\n強有所加 at times add strength.\n\n兼此四者 One using all four\n\n而制其冝 will then prevail.\n\nTo understand Uchida’s text and the it may help to ponder the nature of the Dàoist binaries that describe the duality of nature. In essence, this primary Dàoist concept is that a thing, or the nature or characteristics of a physical thing or phenomena, cannot exist alone; there must be and always is a paired, opposite nature. Some examples? Darkness has no existence, no way to be compared without light. Summer has no meaning without winter. Heat must acknowledge and be affected by cold. The dualities of phenomena are endless: elder / younger, male / female, Heaven / Earth, parent / child, weakness / strength, movable / immovable, static / moving, on and on, finite / infinite.\n\nThe famous Taijtu (Ja: Taikyokuzu) is a symbolic representation of the duality of nature.\n\nTo give a notion of how important these concepts are in East Asian cultures, take a look at the Republic of Korea (South Korea) flag:\n\nUchida mentions the seasons often. Even in the deepest part of winter, the most Yin time of the year, the Yang of summer must inevitably come, blending Yin Yang in the spring. He urges the cultivation of the body to true flexibility to be able to move best when the time is right, and the cultivation of the mind to maintain vigilance and the knowledge that such a time must come. In this manner, he says, the weaker can overcome the stronger, using the “power of the heavens”, not in somehow collecting and directing those powers but rather in adding all too frail human power in the right direction at the right time to take advantage of the natural transitions.\n\nFrom the chapter title itself, Uchida proceeds to describe how ki 気 fits into the practice of martial arts, using Dàoist and Confucian concepts up to 2500 years old.\n\nNote: This translation of Uchida’s text is provisional, as I am not satisfied with certain sections. Portions of the original text are very complex and draw on obscure, perhaps even otherwise completely lost texts, so I expect I’ll make changes as I puzzle through those sections a bit more.\n\n******Uchida Ryōhei’s Budō Gokui, Chapter 24: Jū Yoku Gō wo Sei Su *******\n\nKi 気 (EN 1) is the reason how flexibility 柔 (EN 2) can control hardness 剛 (EN 3).\n\nThis is the spirit that Mencius (孟子 372-289 BCE)(EN 4) said to foster in self-reliance and open-mindedness.\n\nThe kanji character for ki is synonymous with seasons and occasions,\n\nand has important significance in mastering the secrets of martial arts.\n\nKi is the ki of heaven –\n\nthere are people born with that ki.\n\nIt is breath.\n\nIt is will.\n\nTherefore, it should be said that\n\npeople must live by ki\n\nand move by ki.\n\nA season is the time of the four seasons when ki appears,\n\nand it is said that the character for season means the end.\n\nThe end is a shifting thing.\n\nThe periods of such as the seasons are fixed.\n\nBut even things that are fixed are bound to change when the time is right.\n\nChange is the law of nature, and opportunity arises here.\n\nOpportunity is always in ceaseless motion according to ki,\n\nas there are shades in the sky, the wind and rain.\n\nFollowing the movement of opportunity is in order,\n\ngoing against it is the opposite.\n\nIf things are in order, you will win,\n\nbut if things are in not in order,\n\nyou will lose.\n\nIn short, it is through the sublime use of heavenly principles that the flexible conquers the hard.(But) flexibility is not always superior to hardness.\n\nHardness does not necessarily win over flexibility.\n\nThe common difference between either winning and losing is that which lies in the skill of one’s changing movement.\n\nThe ancients explained that\n\n“The flexible is Yang, the hard, Yin“\n\nbecause flexibility is the Yang of the Yin;\n\nthe utmost Yin\n\nis the innermost Yang that becomes Yang.\n\nThe hard is the Yin inside Yang;\n\nthe utmost Yang\n\nis the Yin that becomes Yin.\n\nIt was also said by the ancients:\n\n“The utmost Yin becomes Yang,\n\nthe utmost Yang becomes Yin,\n\nas we know the flow of the four seasons.”\n\nBut\n\nspring is the time when winter’s utmost Yin turns to Yang;\n\nthen the growth force of new shoots of plants and trees seems superficially weak,\n\nbut it is impossible to suppress them.\n\nIn the summer, everything grows in the sun / Yang /\n\ntheir shapes grow strong and hard;\n\nbe that as it may,\n\nautumn falls / Yin /\n\nthe season about to change –\n\nit cannot be stopped.\n\nAs you can certainly see, events always turn –\n\nwhenever there is a change of momentum,\n\nwhenever there is a change of direction;\n\nif we apply our wills in accordance with the time and place of the change,\n\nthe weak will conquer the strong.\n\nCertainly,\n\nthe Way 道 (EN 5) to ride energy / spirit / life is\n\nto be firm in mind\n\nand flexible in body.\n\nIn the Jigō Tenshin Ryū Jūjutsu (EN6) densho scroll of transmission (EN 7), it is written:\n\nYou must have a strong spirit\n\nto perceive large and small matters\n\nwith keen insight.\n\nIf you attain a flexible body,\n\nyou can move quickly.\n\nTherefore, it is said,\n\nbe not only flexible,\n\nalso be firm and true.\n\nThe Kenchō (“The Precise Sword”) (EN 8) explains it as follows:\n\nWei Liaozi – Wuyi Hen, Section 12 (EN 9)\n\nVictory is like water –\n\nwater is the softest and weakest thing,\n\nbut at its touch,\n\nthe very hills must crumble;\n\nthere is no difference –\n\nfocused, sincere.\n\nThe heart of what is said\n\nis that an army that overcomes an enemy is like water.\n\nEverything it touches will crumble.\n\nThose who follow such water,\n\neven the weakest people,\n\nthe land it touches are the summits of hills,\n\nand those tumble down;\n\nthe nature of water\n\nis as a single-minded person –\n\ntouching becomes one.\n\nYou should be enlightened by the warriors. (EN 10)\n\nThose who practice the arts today –\n\nas soon as he meets the enemy –\n\nshows his right and strikes left,\n\nshows his lower hem and strikes the head.\n\nEverything\n\ndepends on cunning and deception.\n\nTherefore,\n\nclearly, before penetrating the enemy’s gut,\n\nthe enemy is not thinking at all –\n\nconsequently – my murderous ki – I will do it at will.\n\nSad, so sad.\n\nIt is as if, suffering frost and snow all our lives,\n\nas a matter of living to no purpose after all,\n\nthere is no chance of success.\n\nBut…..\n\nPlease sincerely touch the true nature of water;\n\nby virtue of righteousness the hills crumble before it;\n\nawaken (EN 11) with detachment,\n\nact sincerely;\n\nwhen you reach the sublime state of independence,\n\nlight shoots from your eyes –\n\nenemies cannot face it.\n\nIt’s almost like the dazzling morning sun.\n\n******** END of Uchida’s Chapter 24********\n\nSo we have Uchida’s sense of the origins and importance of ki. He saw it in the changes, in the moments of movement and momentum. Not in some energy somehow cultivated from within a person, but in the inevitable, natural moments found in the fullness of things. The challenge to him was to achieve a flexible body able to move quickly and an attentive, focused, firm mind prepared for the inevitable change opportunities.\n\nUchida was not the first to note the importance of moving in accordance with the opportunity, in accordance with ki, to develop the best budō. Later we’ll examine the poem contributed by an Imperial Prince describing jūdō that used similar language; his poem still hangs in the Kodokan today.\n\nKanō shihan himself was certainly aware of traditional notions including ki but developed jūdō as a scientific martial art and means of physical and character education. He was more concerned with the developing field of early 20th century biomechanics rather than 2000 year old Confucian and Dàoist philosophies, even though his own social ideas were strongly affected by those same philosophies. He also provided several forewords to martial arts books that espoused theories of ki and seika tanden, writing of the importance of the maintenance of traditional budō martial arts without commenting on the details.\n\nHe did, however, publish articles on the importance of ki and how to develop the tanden in his Judo magazine in the early Taishō era, just before 1920. After he fully formed his own jūdō philosophies Seiryoku Zenyō Jita Kyōei around 1920, Kanō established the Kodokan Culture Club in 1922 and focused on proselytizing them to the world.

Qi is frequently translated as life energy, lifeforce, or energy flow. Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. The literal translation of “qi” is breath, air, or gas.”\n\nKi is the middle character in aikidō 合気道 and while greatly stressed and studied in that art, is not commonly thought to be a factor in modern jūdō.\n\nPre World War II there was more interest in the study and use of ki in traditional jūdō, particularly among classically educated jūdōka such as Uchida who studied multiple budō martial arts and the Chinese classic texts.\n\n2 – Flexibility 柔 (JA: jū in compounds, yawara in a single word) is often translated as softness, gentleness, or weakness.It is the initial kanji in the word 柔道 jūdō, “Flexible Way”.\n\nKanō shihan,who spoke and read English well, cited both gentleness and flexibility on different occasions over decades to translate the jū in jūdō into English.\n\nThe author prefers flexibility to capture the totality of the term, as jūdōka should respond to force by giving way flexibly yet with control and appropriate tension, not with softness or weakness.\n\n3 – hardness 剛 (JA: gō) Hardness, or stiffness, is the opposite of 柔 jū flexibility, as evident in the binary jūgō 柔剛 flexible/hard, flexibility/hardness.\n\n4 – Mencius (孟子, JA: Mōshi, 372-289 BCE) Wiki: Mencius was a Chinese philosopher who was arguably the most famous Confucian after Confucius himself.\n\n5 – Way 道 (JA: dō in compounds, michi as a single character word)\n\nWiki: Dō is the go-on vocalization of the Japanese kanji 道, corresponding to Mandarin Chinese (pinyin) dào, meaning “way”, with connotations of “philosophy, doctrine” (see Tao).\n\n6 – Jigō Tenshin ryū Jūjutsu 自剛天真流柔術. A Japanese jūjutsu school prominent in the Fukuoka area and the Meidōkan dōjō associated with the Genyōsha 玄洋社 “Dark Ocean Society” ultranationalist organization. Uchida himself, son of a founding member of the Genyōsha, practiced the art as a young man and later at the Tenshinkan dōjō he founded in Fukuoka.\n\n7 – “Scroll of transmission” is an English translation of 伝書 densho, which are traditional scrolls used to record budō techniques, traditions, and lineage, given to senior practitioners upon their promotion to various senior positions including full license to teach independently.\n\n8 – Kenchō\n\nHirayama Heigen and Takai Kunimoto, Kenchō, unpublished manuscript, 1870.\n\n9 – Wei Liaozi – 尉繚子 This text is known as one of China’s Seven Military Classics. Master Wei Liao is thought to have written the Wei Liaozi during the Warring States period (475 – 221 BC).\n\nThe Uchida citation is a portion of the Wuyi Hen 武議篇 – Military Commentaries Chapter, Section 12, which in its entirety reads:\n\n勝兵似水、\n\n夫水至柔弱者也、\n\n然所以觸、\n\n丘陵必爲之崩、\n\n無異也、\n\n性專而觸誠也。*\n\n今以莫邪之利、\n\n犀兕之堅、\n\n三軍之衆、\n\n有所奇正、\n\n則天下莫當其戰矣。\n\n* Uchida stops here….\n\n10 – Warriors 武人 (JA: bujin) Although Uchida was born the son of a samurai, the traditional, hereditary warrior caste was abolished around his birth. (His father Ryōgorō, a political activist / former samurai, stopped carrying the traditional dual sword set of the samurai when it was outlawed in 1870, and almost paid for it with his life; he was attacked one day by political enemies, two men wielding highly illegal swords. He barely escaped with his life, and was inspired to develop Uchida Ryū tanjōjutsu 内田流短杖術, a series of cane or short staff drills used against an attacker armed with a sword. Today it is taught as a part of today’s Shintō Musō Ryū jōdō 神道夢想流杖道 curriculum).\n\nMost of the men that followed Uchida were not former samurai, but many practiced martial arts, at least in their youth, and urged its practice upon young Japanese to forge their minds and bodies to be effective ‘warriors’ for the Emperor.\n\nThe ‘arts’ mentioned in the next line are the warrior arts.\n\n11 – Awaken. The term Uchida uses is the Chinese word 醒悟 xǐngwù, meaning realization, awakening, awakening from hesitation (to action).\n\nIt could be understood as a form of “reaching enlightenment”.\n\n##\n\nThank you for reading this far – it’s a bit long. I should probably reduce the introduction.\n\nIf you’d like to subscribe to get notices of new material, please enter your email below.\n\nYou can send comments and feedback to Contact@KanoChronicles.com\n\nOne episode of the life of Kanō shihan (master) not generally appreciated by jūdōka is his extended effort to educate Chinese students. This effort saw him undertake a Meiji government sponsored months’ long, thousands of kilometers official trip through Q’ing dynasty China in which he met mandarins, had secret conversations with overlords, visited the tomb of the founder of orthodox neo-Confucianism, contacted future revolutionaries, and dodged pirates.\n\nBeginning with a small private juku in a rented facility Kanō developed a purpose built school that inducted almost 8,000 Chinese over years, hundreds enrolled at any given time. He first named it 亦楽書院 Jiraku Shoin, a name derived from an ancient Confucian classic text, then again changed the kanji for the new name after being informed by some of his students that such a name violated an obscure ancient naming taboo by using the name of a Chinese Emperor, an affront to traditional Chinese. Today in Japanese we know it as the 弘文学院 Kōbun Gakuin, in Chinese history it is known as the Hongwen Academy.\n\nIt was essentially a preparatory school, primarily intended to bring the diverse group of polyglot Chinese students to an acceptable level of comprehension and communications in spoken and written Japanese and a foundation in other topics so the students could later enroll in regular advanced education in Japanese higher education institutes, including Kanō’s own 東京高等師範学校 Tōkyō Kōtō Shihan Gakkō Tokyo Higher Normal School, Japan’s highest teacher training academy. There they would study to become the new teaching cadre that backwards China so desperately needed to modernize its education system. They were joined by a number that went on to study at military or police training facilities until the Japanese government banned the practice.\n\nIn teaching Japanese to so many foreigners at once, almost inadvertently the school became one of the foremost working laboratories of teaching the Japanese language, which Kanō himself helped to codify. In mid-Meiji, the school developed a Japanese language training program which it published; the book, Nihongo Kyōkasho, A Japanese Textbook and its training program was so well regarded that it stayed in print for over thirty years.\n\nThe school remained in operation for years until political propaganda fostered by Europeans and Americans fueled anti-Japanese sentiment to the point that enrollment fell off sharply. Kanō, who lived on the school compound bought for the project in a large house he had built, acquired the huge plot of land years after the school closed and lived there until his death in 1938, when his eldest surviving son and future Kodokan president Kanō Risei inherited the compound.\n\nIn the years of the Kōbun Gakuin, Kanō met many men and women who would become key figures in the future of China. Some became founders and political leaders of all three rival Chinese governments vying for power in World War II and its subsequent Civil War, contributing to the deaths of tens of millions of Chinese, as well as teachers and businessmen desperately trying to bolster the faltering China. Some stayed in touch with Kanō for decades afterwards.\n\nThe students included future Communists, Nationalists, collaborators with the invading Japanese, soldiers, artists, authors, and even Mao’s father in law. They included: 陈天华、黄兴、李待琛、杨度、胡汉民、牛保才、杨昌济、张澜、朱剑凡、胡元倓、李琴湘、方鼎英、许寿裳、鲁迅、沈心工、陈幼云、陈师曾、陈寅恪、劉勳麟、鲍贵藻, 李四光、侯鸿鉴、郑菊如、李书城、林伯渠、邓以蛰、趙戴文、and 程鴻書.\n\n********\n\nKanō wrote a forward to the Japanese Textbook in classic Chinese that would be understandable by the Chinese despite their different spoken dialects and varying levels of Japanese skills. It reads:\n\n近時中華文運方興。\n\nRecently there is a Chinese cultural movement.\n\n斯講新学者。\n\nThese new scholars.\n\n多資於我日本語日文。\n\nSkilled in our Japanese language and grammar.\n\n而日語文實為中華士子今日必須之学者日増月盛。\n\nAnd Japanese is actually getting more and more important every day for Chinese scholars。\n\n而教科之書。\n\nHowever, educational books.\n\n未見其善者。\n\nI have not seen good ones.\n\n定為憾耳。\n\nI regard that as regrettable.\n\n顧言語文字之為学。\n\nThe study of speech and writing.\n\n如容易其然。\n\nAs easily as possible.\n\n而其實不然者存焉。\n\nBut what else?\n\n我宏文学院。**\n\nOur Kōbun Gakuin.\n\n教養中華学生有年。\n\nEducated Chinese students for many years.\n\n我邦語文教授之方。\n\nOur national language professors.\n\n講究已久。\n\nStudied how for a long time.\n\n其成績頗有可觀者。\n\nMen of considerable achievements.\n\n因使教授松本氏編纂日本語科書。\n\nAs a result, Professor Matsumoto* compiled this Japanese language book.\n\n諸教授賛助之。\n\nVarious professors supported it.\n\n其口語法用例先成。\n\nIts colloquial use cases are established first.\n\n皀以刊行。\n\nAnd is published with.\n\n而會文法讀本等。\n\nGrammar and a reader, etc.\n\n亦已就諸\n\nIt is complete.\n\n其訖助之日\n\nFinally the day of its release!\n\n興此書相待\n\nWe welcome this book!\n\n而教授日語日文之資料。\n\nAnd its teaching material for Japanese and Japanese literature.\n\n庶乎其備矣。\n\nIt is almost ready.\n\n抑是書也。\n\nThis book.\n\n為華人而作。\n\nIs thus made for Chinese.\n\n然而教授我邦語於一般諸外国人之典型。\n\nTeaching of our Japanese to typical foreigners.\n\n亦不出於此。\n\nNor is it for this reason.\n\n則是書之所裨益\n\nThe benefit of this book.\n\n盖不小也。\n\nis not small, after all.\n\n明治三十九年四月\n\nApril Meiji 39 (1906)\n\n宏文学院長嘉納治五郎\n\nKōbun Gakuin head Kanō Jigorô\n\n– translation ©Copyright 2020 by Lance Gatling, The Kanō Chronicles\n\nEndnotes:\n\n* Matsumoto was the Kōbun Gakuin vice principal and a principal Japanese instructor.\n\n** The first name of the school was 弘文学院 Kōbun Gakuin later changed to 宏文学院 which is also pronounced Kōbun Gakuin in Japanese; not accidentally both are pronounced Hongwen Xuéyuàn in Mandarin, usually rendered as Hongwen Academy in English.
