Answers to the most challenging questions about the fundamental physics of the universe will come as Fermilab’s scientific program pushes forward with world-leading research at all three interrelated frontiers. Particle accelerators at the Energy Frontier produce high-energy collisions that signal new phenomena, from the origin of mass to the nature of dark matter and extra dimensions of space. Fermilab is the U.S. host laboratory for the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland. Scientists use intense beams from particle accelerators for Intensity Frontier experiments that explore neutrino interactions and ultra-rare processes in nature. At the Cosmic Frontier, astrophysicists use the cosmos as a laboratory to investigate the fundamental laws of physics from a perspective that complements experiments at particle accelerators. Experiments at Fermilab can involve hundreds of scientists from all over the world who work for years designing and constructing large detectors and then taking and analyzing data. Read about our frontiers of discovery and intern program information.\n\nThe frontier is the quintessential symbol of Fermilab. The Laboratory’s founding director, Robert Wilson, born in Frontier, Wyoming, incorporated the frontier imagery of his western heritage in a site designed for discovery at the frontiers of science. Wilson’s introduction of American bison, the restoration of hundreds of acres of native tall-grass prairie, and a frontier spirit of adventure and resourcefulness helped to establish Fermilab’s unique character. Located in Batavia, Illinois, Fermilab is 30 miles west of Chicago's Loop. While at Fermilab you can enjoy a range of outdoor activities or take advantage of the cultural resources of a large metropolitan area.\n\nIdaho National Laboratory\n\nIdaho National Laboratory is home to over 6,000 researchers and support staff, focusing their expertise toward innovative advancements in nuclear research, renewable energy systems, and security solutions with global impact.\n\nFrom pioneering discoveries in advanced nuclear energy to the development of carbon-free energy alternatives and safeguarding critical national infrastructure, INL continuously push boundaries to redefine what's achievable.\n\nINL promotes workforce development through internship opportunities pertaining to scientific research for undergraduate student interns and participating college and university educators in a multidisciplinary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-focused environment.
