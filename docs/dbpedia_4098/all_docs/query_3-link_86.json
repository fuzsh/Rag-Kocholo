        "text": "Physics Fellowship Program\n\nThe RIKEN BNL Research Center offers a Fellow system at Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) allowing joint appointments with universities and research laboratories throughout the world, enabling talented researchers to hold tenure track positions at their home institution as well as a Fellow position with the Center.\n\nThis system was established to increase the research potential of the Center and to disseminate its research activities and results. To date, nine RHIC Physics Fellows have received the U.S. Department of Energy Outstanding Junior Investigator Award and over 50 Fellows have received tenure at their home institutions since the inception of the program.\n\nInstitutions interested in initiating a new RHIC Physics Fellow position may obtain details on how to proceed by contacting Maureen McNeill-Shea, 1(631) 344-2758.\n\nRBRC Research Groups\n\nTheory\n\nY. Hatta, Group Leader\n\nThis group conducts QCD related research that includes heavy ion physics, the quark gluon plasma, color glass condensate and hard QCD/spin physics.\n\nComputing\n\nT. Izubuchi, Group Leader\n\nThis group's mission is to solve the dynamics of QCD from first principle lattice simulations using in-house computer resources.\n\nExperimental\n\nY. Akiba, Group Leader\n\nThis group studies the spin structure of the proton via polarized p+p collisions at RHIC as well as the properties of quark gluon plasma.\n\nBrookhaven Science Associates\n\nBrookhaven Science Associates manages and operates Brookhaven National Laboratory on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. BSA is a partnership between Battelle and The Research Foundation for the State University of New York on behalf of Stony Brook University. | More"
