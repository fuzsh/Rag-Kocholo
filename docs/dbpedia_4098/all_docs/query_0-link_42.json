Conventional means for vengeance were lacking: no bases and no long-range bombers were being designed.

Thus, the Japanese had to resort to unusual means. BB090 Ensign George “Tex” Gay’s TBD Devastator of Torpedo Squadron 8 attacking carrier Kaga painting (Reynolds, Clark G.

Retaliation : Japanese attacks and Allied countermeasures on the Pacific Coast in World War II (Corvalis: Oregon State University Press,1976), 66.\n\n6 RESEARCHERS OF THE NINETH MILITARY TECHNICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT NOBORITO\n\nJapanese military researchers then convinced their superiors to adopt a novel form of attack: unmanned bomb-carrying balloons. Submarines and battleships were initially considered for launching them, but more vital tasks had priority. Thus, the \"FU-GO\" weapons were to be launched from the Home Islands. BB004 SOURCE: Smithsonian Institution Photo #\n\n7 THE “FU-GO” WEAPON “FU\" is the thirty- second character in the Japanese syllabary (alphabet). \"GO\" was the Japanese equivalent for \"Number” \"FU-GO\" was Weapon No. 32 of the Japanese Military Scientific Laboratory. \"FU\" also happens the first part of \"FUSEN\", the Japanese word for balloon. SOURCE: Mikesh, 3-5\n\n8 TOP: TYPICAL FLIGHT PROFILE BOTTOM: TYPICAL JET STREAM IN WINTER\n\nPrewar research in Japan revealed the existence of the jet stream: strong currents of air that move at high altitudes. This research indicated that the jet stream could carry an explosives-laded balloon 6200 miles from Japan to the Pacific Coast of North America. Destination - The Pacific Northwest. Real target - morale of the American and Canadian civilian populations. Yo-yo physics.

Key component was a battery that provided the power to activate the sandbag-release circuits. This battery was protected by an antifreeze solution that would prevent it from freezing at high-altitude temperatures.\n\n12 U.S. NAVAL AVIATORS EXAMINING CHANDELIER\n\n13 CHANDELIER, BOMBS & SANDBAG FROM BOUNDARY BAY, B.

Slow burning fuses set off explosives on both the balloon and altitude control mechanism. When 19,000 cubic feet of highly flammable hydrogen ignited, a blinding flash would appear in the skies. This balloon weapon would be difficult to counter. It would be unseen and unpredictable BB009 SOURCE: Mikesh, pg. 57\n\n15 NEW YORK TIMES (MARCH 17, 1995) NYT (3-17-95) Kristoff JPN BW article\n\nThe FU-GO researchers initially wanted to use biological weapons. Their plan was approved along the chain of command to Army CoS, General Tojo. In the early fall of 1944, he refused to sanction the use of these weapons; he feared retaliation from the U.S. This information was revealed in a March 1995 article in the New York Times by Nicholas Kristoff. Prior to this article, there was only nebulous reports of meetings between\n\n16 PAPER MAKING Crash program. Competing wartime priorities demanded use of non-strategic materials. Centuries-old expertise paper-making expertise developed a special laminated mulberry paper that, when shellacked with a persimmon juice sealant, could withstand the rigors of a high-altitude transoceanic crossing (paper umbrellas).

Compulsory civilian war work. Pilfered the paste since it was a compound of edible arum root; the temptation to steal the paste was compelling since Japanese civilians were on short food rations. BB013 SOURCE: Smithsonian\n\n20 TEST INFLATION OF FU-GO ENVELOPE\n\nFU-GO construction went well: 10,000 balloons were made under tight secrecy. Steps were also taken to insure that no obvious traces of the balloons' origin were present. Strange nature of the effort ensured that most Japanese would disbelieve the intended use of the balloons. Other rumors seemed more credible. BB015 SOURCE:\n\n21 LAUNCH CREW MANHANDLING TEST BALLOON\n\nBB017 SOURCE: Mikesh, 12\n\n22 LAUNCH SITE WITH THREE PADS IN OPERATION\n\n--Most dangerous parts of the launch were the filling of the balloons with hydrogen gas and the actual release. The first few launches had faulty electrical circuits explode the balloons before lift-off. Quickly corrected, but the likelihood of mishaps remained. --Crews remembered the launches as strangely beautiful. The FU-GO weapons resembled giant jellyfish since they were only partially inflated. The hydrogen would expand and fill the balloon when it reached cruising altitudes. BB016 SOURCE: Mikesh, 21\n\n23 FU-GO AIRBORNE AFTER LAUNCH\n\n--As they silently rose, the rising or setting sun would color the craft in reds and yellows. Quickly they gained altitude until they resembled daytime stars. --Security broke down in the launching of the balloons. The authorities took great pains to leave no traces of the balloons' origins and evacuated the launch sites and surrounding ocean area, they had not counted on Japanese martial traditions. Launch troops left good luck charms in the folds of the balloons. They followed a military tradition that had a warrior leaving home for battle, carry a samhara, an amulet that protected him from harm. Fighting customs of past centuries foiled painstaking security measures. BB019 SOURCE: Smithsonian\n\n24 FU-GO OVER THE PACIFIC --The Special Balloon Regiment launched 9300 FU-GO weapons in the five months from November 1944 to April Japanese hoped that 1,000 balloons would get across the Pacific (roughly 9%), but it would be enough. If only one forest fire could approximate the damage of the 1932 Tillamook, Oregon, fire or if Americans or Canadians were killed, then the effort would be worthwhile. --Japanese assumed that the American news organizations would not ignore such an important story and thus give the FU-GO directors valuable information. Americans, in their view, were an undisciplined and gossipy people. Their newspapers and broadcasts would provide detailed coverage on this unusual weapon. --Little news filtered back to Japan. There were only two stories in December 1944 of balloon incidents in Montana and Wyoming, By mid-April 1945 the Japanese high command concluded that the balloon campaign had failed. Moreover, American B-29 raids were destroying hydrogen-producing facilities. The warlords consequently abandoned the FU-GO effort. BB021 SOURCE: Mikesh p. 23 (Signal Corps SC226132)\n\n25 BATTERY BOX What the Japanese didn't know was that the balloon design had a major flaw: battery that powered the altitude control mechanism. The antifreeze solution was too weak and didn't prevent the battery from freezing. With no power to activate the dropping of sandbags, most of the FU-GO weapons descended into the Pacific.

CHANDELIER (MAY 31, 1945)\n\n--Winter seemed a weird time to set the Western forests ablaze, but authorities kept finding scores of incendiary-equipped balloons. Thus, officials concluded that the forests were a prime target. FU-GO weapons would be very effective during the 1945 fire season due to a number of factors (work on the potential). The civilian fire-fighting agencies had lost their most experienced personnel to the war effort. What was available was in low numbers and poorly trained. Wartime cutting practices had produced large amounts of combustible slash in the forests. Finally, the precipitation in the threatened areas was \"substantially below normal.\" --Researchers estimated that half the “bombs which fall in western Canada south of the Barrens will fall in wooden areas”. April was expected to be the beginning of increased fires. There was concern that fires could easily get started in remote areas and that the reduction in visibility would exacerbate the situation by hindering fire patrols. There was concern that more BBs could reach Canada in the warmer months than the U.S. Also, it was suspected that more BBs had arrived than had been found. --B.C. Provincial Forester, E.E. Gregg, requested that BBs be downed in “green timber” instead of slash areas. Due to limited resources, RCAF assistance would be transport of personnel and equipment in emergencies as well as doing fire recon in the course of other duties. There was concern the JPN would use “incendiary leaves” in the BBs. --Fortunately, no fires were started by the balloons in the West. With hindsight, these countermeasures were unnecessary since the Japanese could only launch balloons during the winter months when high-altitude winds were at their peak. However, the authorities lacked this knowledge and had to prepare for the possibility of forest fires.
