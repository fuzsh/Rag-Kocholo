On the Texas A&M University campus, our faculty, staff and students have additional research space in the Entomology Research Laboratory, the Biological Control Facility and the Texas A&M University Insect Collection. Just off campus, select groups of our faculty and research scientists work in the Rollins Urban and Structural Entomology Facility.\n\nAcross the state, we have faculty located at nine modern, well-equipped regional research centers located in major agricultural areas in the state that enable our students to carry out research programs.\n\nThe facilities include specialized greenhouses, walk-in and individual-temperature/photoperiod programmable chambers, federally-approved, maximum quarantine facilities, an NIH-approved P3 containment facility for virology research and equipment for a full range of biochemical, physiological, and toxicological investigations."
