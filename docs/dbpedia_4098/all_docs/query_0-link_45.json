(1) Clandestine, unconventional activities of the Japanese who fought a long and occasionally inspired attack on the Allies have been even less publicised. While many Japanese records were destroyed at war's end and material available in translation is restricted, this paper seeks to begin the process of understanding. The focus is on the work undertaken by graduates of the intelligence agency known as the Nakano School, or Nakano Gakko.\n\nThe long history of the Japanese in intelligence gathering is well known, with the involvement of secret societies, research institutions and the very effective system known as the mass method of gathering information where the entire community was expected to contribute. This produced a duplication of functions and information, as well as a greater capacity for controlling those providing the information. All forms of intelligence-gathering were intertwined: it was \"difficult to differentiate, for example, between those organisations designed for the collection and collation of economic intelligence, and those engaged in purely military, naval or political matters\". (2)\n\nSome intelligence was obtained by Japanese agents in New Guinea before the war, but it was inconsistent at best and depended on the ability of the agent or contact involved. There was, for example, great detail such as stocks held in individual sheds, although there was a lack of information on vital issues including food supplies or the state of the Kokoda trail. (3)\n\nNakano School agents were involved with the Army and Navy, with both forces demonstrating an ongoing commitment to undercover activities. The Army's Second Division incorporated the Kempeitai (the police responsible for security and counter intelligence); the Special Service Agency known as Tokumu Kikan (espionage); and the Central Special Intelligence Department (code breaking). (4) The Navy's General Staff had its Department of Naval Intelligence and Special Service Organisations (5), and importantly, it was the Navy that was given responsibility for civil administration and the maintenance of public order on New Guinea.\n\nThe Navy was the most active of the services in its clandestine activity pre-war. In the Pacific area it gathered intelligence by working with commercial bodies such as the South Seas Development Company (6) while its Special Service Organisation obtained information from sailors employed on shipping in the waters around New Guinea and Australia. (7) Submarines were known to have visited the north coast of Australia and occasionally contacted remote aboriginal communities in their search for possible landing places. (8)\n\nUntil 1940 the Army had focussed on China and was not concerned with the south, but with the emerging possibility of a war in the Pacific, it made three decisions to boost intelligence capability. First, the Nakano School was formally established in Tokyo. This had been operating since 1938 as an intelligence academy, and it was to train more than 2500 operatives by the end of the war. Secondly, the process of sending out trained operatives across the Asia Pacific area was accelerated. The third decision was to establish the Dora Nawa Unit, which became famous as the research organisation that assessed all data for the invasion to begin the Pacific War. (9) When war began, the Japanese not only drew on the intelligence developed over years but undertook a further deliberate dispersal of agents. (10)\n\nThe Nakano School provided a rigorous introduction to the life of an agent. Extended courses were provided on a wide variety of topics including languages, philosophy, history, current events, martial arts, propaganda, counter intelligence and the facets of covert action. On graduation, some agents remained in Japan to monitor subversion, although more commonly they were sent overseas to infiltrate established institutions. Agents often posed as \"immigrants, students or businessmen\". (11) They gathered information and acted as intermediaries, usually operating through the integrated Japanese network of the consular service network, banks, industrial houses, shipping companies or the commercial bodies such as the South Seas Development Company. They worked closely with the Kempeitai, the notorious Japanese military police, and in many cases the roles of the agents and the Kempeitai dovetailed to the extent that programs were indistinguishable. The agents often arranged themselves into special service agencies or kikans that were involved in undercover intelligence work, including espionage, propaganda and subversion, fifth column activities, internal security and pacification of the native populations. (12)\n\nSpecial service agencies were present in almost every country occupied by the Japanese, including Java, Burma, Brunei, the Philippines and Malaya. (13) Establishment of an agency aggregated the activities of the individual agents, allowing a concerted effort to be made on a particular project--such as undertaking anti-colonial activities in India and undermining ties to the Army. Of Australian interest, in late 1943 a unit known as the Pine Kikan or the Pinetree was established in the Dutch East Indies to conduct long-distance reconnaissance on Australia. Japanese Navy intelligence indicated considerable Allied activity on roads and airfields on the coast of Western Australia. Lieutenant Koko of the Pine Kikan wanted to test whether the reports were accurate. On 23 January 1944 a group of four Japanese and (25) Malays set sail from Kupang on Timor and landed some days later at a point assumed to be some 540 km southwest of Darwin at Admiralty Bay. The group stayed four days and took photographs to show there was no Allied airfield or other activity there. The film was sent to Tokyo where it perished in an air raid. (14)\n\nActivities in New Guinea\n\nUndercover activities of the Japanese in New Guinea differed according to the location of the Japanese (that is, whether they were in the east or west of the island), the extent to which the occupation was in an area previously settled by the Japanese, and the distance from the Allied advance. In general, garrisons in Dutch New Guinea were established where there had been a strong pre-war presence of the Japanese, usually by the South Seas Development Company, and the focus was then on long-term work with the natives. In the east of the island, the Japanese had no strong presence pre-war and with the inevitability of battle there, the focus was on stemming the Allied advance. (To take one example, coast watching and observation posts were set up on the north coast to monitor the presence of Allied aircraft.) As is well known, the Japanese occupied a number of settlements particularly on the northern coast of the island where they established or expanded facilities such as ports and airstrips as well as establishing garrison units. (15)\n\nThe Japanese utilised the Naval Minseibu civil system for administering New Guinea, along with the actions of the feared Kempeitai; the coordinating 8th Navy Development Department was installed at Wewak by February 1943 and Hollandia by March 1944. (16) Natives were incorporated in their administration, in setting up schools, by being recruited into the militia unit known as the Native Police Force, and in the utilisation of the native hierarchy in pacifying or controlling the community.\n\nGarrisons were established in the west at Manokwari, Fakfak, Babo, Nabire, Hollandia, and Sorong. It is likely there was a kikan or at least a Kempeitai unit established in the Manokwari area and the far west of the island from the time the Japanese first landed there in April 1942. Nakano agents undertook four main activities: training the natives in military activities; establishing spying operations; guerrilla operations; and establishing special agencies in Dutch New Guinea.\n\nNatives were being used by the Japanese from the early months of the war, not just in standard military training but for undercover purposes. One report said:\n\nIn 1942 there existed at Manokwari, Dutch New Guinea, a special training school known as Hirata Tai, after its commanding officer, Hirata ... In September 1943 this school was transferred to Kaimana (also in Dutch New Guinea). The school trained Papuans in secret police methods. Graduates were to ascertain the allegiance among the natives, whether they were passing around Allied pamphlets, spreading false rumours, etc. (17)\n\nThere were other reports that indicated the military use of the natives. One report of 6 December 1943 said that \"The enemy is reported to train Papuans in the use of rifles at Iworep village..\" (18) (that is, near Dobo, the largest settlement in the Aroe Islands off the west coast of Dutch New Guinea). According to a diary entry for 9 December 1943 for Lieutenant G B Black who was sent on the Inter-Allied Services Department (ISD) Locust mission from Bena Bena to Aitape: \"Natives being trained at Aitape in use of firearms, grenades etc\". (19) The latter suggests that similar training exercises might have been quite widespread by extending into the eastern part of the island as well.\n\nWhere it was possible, the Japanese incorporated the natives into a spy system, regardless of whether it was in the east or west of the island. In part the pacification activities were oriented to this end--the natives were urged to help the Japanese forces, to bring in any downed airmen, and to let the soldiers know of any useful intelligence. As one Allied intelligence report said, the \"Japanese have organised an extensive native intelligence system for reconnaissance and espionage purposes.\" (20) Where the Nakano agents were not active it was the Kempeitai that operated the spy system. Schools for potential spies were held and one report noted that \"at present there about 100 receiving education\" at Lae. (21)\n\nSpies were paid for their services. The total number of paid spies is not known, although natives bringing advice were likely to have been compensated so the potential number must have been many thousands. Certainly the life of Allied troops or patrols was made difficult and many were betrayed by willing natives. Even if the natives did not betray their presence, the likelihood of food or shelter being given to an Allied soldier was markedly reduced.\n\nWith a multitude of spies and helpers, the Japanese were able to cover a large amount of territory at any time, thus: \"Native spies were sent out to investigate the conditions in the vicinity of the Nako River ...\". (22) Also, \"Spy squads in about three groups (organised with a CO who is an officer competent to gather intelligence and some NCOs plus natives) will infiltrate into villages and gather intelligence ...\" (23) An uncorroborated report exists on the possibility of agents being active far from base during the Kokoda operations. (24)\n\nReferences to guerrilla tactics occur frequently in the Japanese writings on New Guinea, and it was the agents of the Nakano School who created an effective fighting force. There were four stages of development. To begin, standard guerrilla activities were used in Guadalcanal and New Guinea. (25) In December 1942 at a time of desperation at Buna, infiltration tactics were recognised as being the only means of silencing American artillery. Volunteers were split into groups of twenty, the units penetrated the lines around Soputa in December 1942 and January 1943, blowing up at least one 25 pounder but not succeeding in silencing the guns. (26)\n\nRealising the potential impact of such activities, as a second stage it was decided to train special units to undertake infiltration and guerrilla activities. Some fifteen Nakano agents were sent to eastern New Guinea in early 1943 to demonstrate and a camp to train troops was established 50 km east of Lae. The 200 recruits were from the Takasago tribes of Formosa, and these men distinguished themselves in all subsequent actions. Instruction was given by Nakano squad leaders in means of attack, the study of topography of an area, as well as in the pacification of natives. Known as the Saito Unit, the initial team left in early September to attack an Australian camp in the Kainantu area in the Eastern Highlands Province. Their role was to destroy installations using special incendiary devices (capable of producing heat of over 2000 degrees) developed by the Noborita Institute. The first raid produced over 60 Australian casualties, considerable arms and material were confiscated, and much of the camp destroyed. (27) This success was followed by over 60 raids on Allied positions, notably in the Ramu Valley, at the Driniumor, and an attack on Dagua airfield. (28)\n\nThe third stage was a tribute to the work of the Nakano agents: because of the perceived value of the work, there was a commitment from Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo that more irregular forces were required. This led to the opening of a section of the Nakano School devoted to guerrilla training--the Futamata branch accepted its first intake on 1 September 1944. (29) So the Nakano impact in eastern New Guinea was significant not only on tactics but future training of Nakano agents.\n\nThe final stage occurred in early 1945 when the 18th Army realised that it could no longer operate as a normal fighting force, so it was decided to launch wide scale guerrilla actions. (30) Accordingly the original Saito unit was broken up and dispersed throughout other units with the aim of instructing the 18th Army generally in the performance of infiltration activities; the Nakano agents assisted in the instruction. Not surprisingly, perhaps, not all the reports on the wider use of infiltration and guerrilla activities were complimentary. (31)\n\nSpecial Agencies in Dutch New Guinea\n\nThe final area of Nakano activity concerns the use of the special service agencies in Dutch New Guinea. The 8th Naval Construction Department landed at Wewak and established its headquarters (32) while a field branch of the Kempeitai was also established. As of February 1943, Captain Michiaki of the Japanese Navy was in charge of the unit that set about the development of military and agricultural projects, working with civilian firms, Mitsui and the South Seas Development Company. Numerous Nakano agents were attached to this unit. (33) The Department was split into four sections--General Affairs, Development (agricultural projects), Intendance (supply), and Medical. The General Affairs area concerned itself with investigation of political conditions, morale and loyalty of the natives, propaganda and recruitment of labourers. Any disciplinary actions were turned over to the Kempeitai and important findings were sent to the Naval Special Service Department in Soerabaya. This latter location was the home of the Kana Kikan under Naval Captain Hanada, and was the headquarters for western New Guinea operations.\n\nA number of small agencies or kikans was established in the area from Hollandia (near the border of Dutch New Guinea) west, under the cloak of the 8th Naval Construction Department. They were known by different titles, including 'Kikans', 'Agencies' or 'Agents', 'Pacification Units', and 'Construction Agencies'. They covered the north and west of the country with some presence in the north-central area. They were:\n\n* Kami Kikan, headed by Captain (later Major) Niiho Satoru in February 1944 and stationed in Hollandia.\n\n* Taka Kikan, sited in the Wissel Lakes area (in the west) and led by Lieutenant Ogawa.\n\n* Tatsu Kikan, headquartered at Goai (in the north between Sarmi and Hollandia) and led by Lieutenant Uchiyama. This was also known as the Goal Pacification Unit or the Ryu Agent.\n\n* Wani Kikan, near Lake Habbema (in the central area), led by Captain Hidaka. It was also known as the Hatsubema Pacification Unit.\n\n* Tora Kikan, headquartered at Sarmi in the north, and known as the Sarmi Agent.\n\n* The Jin Agent was led by Major Niiho in June 1944.\n\n* Ume Kikan, based in Biak (an island off the north coast). (34)\n\nEach kikan was headed by an officer up to Major level with 30 to 40 men. The Tatsu Unit, to take an example, led by Lieutenant Uchiyama, had 36 men under him including 5 in intelligence, 8 on wireless duties, 11 men on defence, five men on medical duties, six Military Police, and one interpreter. The leader of the Taka Kikan, Lieutenant Ogawa, entered Australia in May 1941 posing as a cabin boy on board the Canberra Maru. His task was the systematic reconnaissance of Sydney Harbour, and it is suggested his work was used by the submarines attacking the area in 1942. (35) When Captain Hidaka of the Wani Agent was killed in an attack on a seaplane base, Major Niiho was ordered to take command of all units in the area from mid-1944. On a less cheerful aspect, Major Niiho, who led the Kami, Jin and Wani agents, had brought to him any Allied airmen who were downed in the area. Niiho had them executed (and in turn after the war he was executed after trial by the Allies). (36)\n\nThe purpose of the kikans included the establishment of native espionage networks, collection of intelligence, military exploration such as gathering information on the topography and resources of an area, and control and administration of the natives. When an area was considered sufficiently friendly, a 'guard' of natives was formed to act on behalf of the kikan and collect information. Similarly, the Ume Agency, stationed on Biak, \"will, in close liaison with the Naval Pioneer Unit, establish an indirect intelligence organisation composed chiefly of natives\". (37)\n\nOther units (drawn from existing kikans) were delegated for specific purposes, including the Mamberamo Expeditionary Force, the Hirose Exploration Unit and the Tatsu Exploration Unit. (38)\n\nAs an example of the material sent by the Kami Agency from the Hollandia area to Soerabaya, a report on the Topographical Description of Hollandia was included as part of Intelligence Report No 1 sent on 27 December 1943, with sections devoted to geography, climate, natural features, population, education, administrative organisation, and so on. (39) An explanation was included with the lengthy report, saying \"The original investigation of this area was made by the 8th Naval Construction Section in May 1943, but the records were lost in the enemy bombing attack on the district government office. The information given here consists of recollections of the former staff of DEI [Dutch East Indies] and persons familiar with the area\". (40)\n\nThe kikans treated the natives as willing conscripts, and orders directing their life-changing activities were issued on a constant basis. One example was entitled 'Plan for Carrying Out Special Intelligence Against the Natives By 36th Division', which listed their objectives: \"a. First period: To win the native's confidence and establish bases, b. Second period: To organise natives to assist in gathering intelligence, and to extend the main position\". (41)\n\nSimilarly the Tatsu Kikan issued a Proclamation to the natives in the Goai area urging cooperation. The charter contained a series of points beginning \"The object of the Japanese Army penetration into the Goai area is to protect the natives and to crush the advance of the enemy and seize his agents. It is not for the purpose of obtaining coolies or provisions\". Other items on the Proclamation included claims of support for the Japanese from natives at Manokwari, Sarmi and Hollandia, the dominant position of the Japanese Army (\"Rest assured of that\"), the need for the natives to grow food for soldiers, and the importance of the natives seeking out the Japanese to obtain medical attention. (42) Kikans were also used to build group villages and instruct the guard units in their undercover activities.\n\nThese agencies were required to fill complex roles and some examples of their work are of value. First, as part of an investigation into the possibility of finding areas suitable for airfields, the Kami Kikan suggested that the best locations were occupied by two plantations under the control of the 8th Naval Construction Section--and each farm had approximately 50 acres under crops and vegetables. (43) Thus the unit working on agricultural projects was important in the provision of foodstuffs, and would have controlled a sizeable proportion of the labour force (in conjunction with the South Seas Development Company). Secondly, they conducted routine police investigations, so the Kami unit was involved in the apprehension of natives espousing a mystic cult as well as the prevention of rumours among natives, while the Tatsu unit investigated the murder of policemen. (44) Thirdly, a special subjugation unit, part of the Army Intelligence Squad, engaged in battle with Allied troops. (45) And fourthly, in December 1943 natives on neighbouring Biak and Japen Islands arose in mutiny against the Japanese Army, and were pacified by the Biak Detachment (presumably with the assistance of the Ume Kikan). (46)\n\nTwo other uprisings from the native people were recorded in opposition to the Japanese presence, including the Tablasoefa village chief, who in 1944 wrote on behalf of 13 villages to the 8th Naval Construction Section and complained about the Japanese presence. Some 34 villagers were arrested following the complaint. Also, the chief at Armopa and his villagers fled into the hills in protest at Japanese recruitment practices. At the conclusion of their reports, the Japanese were keen to attribute blame, and if the Allies were not responsible (as in these cases they clearly were not) it was assumed that the natives alone deserved punishment. (47) In one report from the Kami Unit, there is a comment on some natives not complying: \"They have no wish to engage in work, because they do not understand the Imperial Army's holy war\". (48)\n\nPerhaps the most important work undertaken by the kikans was that of pacification. This is to be understood as keeping the natives under control in any way, whether by bribery and giving trade goods such as salt or knives, or by more active measures such as arrest as indicated above. In one representative exercise, the Kami unit conducted a wide-scale pacification program lasting from early February until the middle of May, 1944. In this time the unit marched from Hollandia to Arzo, Ampasu, Hollekang, and thence to the upper reaches of the Sepik before returning to Hollandia. In each case the process was the same: the units went from one village to the next, conducting military intelligence and pacifying the natives along the way: \"special stress was laid on the district leader, the village and tribe chiefs\". (The aim was to convince the head man to accept the Japanese teachings and then the villagers would follow his lead.) An area with a radius of 25-30 km around the main centre was pacified. After achieving this, the unit moved to the next centre and repeated the process, again pacifying all natives in a 25-30 km radius around the centre. It was noted in the Ampasu sector \"We have fully succeeded in the pacifying plan by various methods both mental and physical. The natives have offered us their devotion, labour, material and information and further have cooperated in our operations\". (49) In the same manner, the Tatsu Unit sent a report that stated \"about 4000-5000 natives within 60 km radius of Manokwari are regarded as friendly to Japan\". (50) The most active units from the information currently available, seems to have been the Kami and Tatsu Kikans, both of which submitted lengthy reports on their area of occupation.\n\nReflecting the often overlapping style of intelligence gathering as used generally by the Japanese, a similar approach applied in New Guinea. Agencies or kikans were but part of an extensive and conflicting intelligence operation where special units worked alongside regular service units: the collection included the Ikoi unit or 2nd Army Intelligence Section, the Kempeitai, the Civil Administration or Minseibu, 36th Division units, and the Propaganda Department. In addition, there were eight \"intelligence units\" around Goai under the control of the 36th Division (likely to have been the Tatsu agency). (51) To complete the picture, an intelligence operative revealed in his diary that he had attended a lecture at Sarmi from a representative of the Nanyo Development Company, a commercial enterprise promoting Japanese economic activity as well as intelligence gathering. (52) Again demonstrating close links, tactics and field manuals relating to intelligence activities of a range of personnel ranging from the commandos to the Kempeitai, were remarkably similar. (53)\n\nThe kikans were also active in deceptive activity, not surprising when the list of fellow collaborators above is viewed. For example, the Kami Kikan after being advised of an Allied push, stated that it would step up pacification of the natives in the path of the advance (thus denying the Allied troops an easy passage) and would prepare for \"dispersed combat\". In the field manuals, suggestions were given on the use of devices such as deceptive movements and deceptive flight, exploitation of false information, and use of radio propaganda. (54) Fifth column activity also featured in their instruction manuals but seems not to have been applied too readily under the New Guinea conditions: suggestions included the use of bacterial agents, plus military, diplomatic and economic activities (such as disruption of the currency system and sabotage of natural resources), creating terror among the population, and employing \"feint attacks and other various types of tactics to threaten the enemy's rear and confuse him\". (55)\n\nImpact of the Japanese Activity\n\nThe effectiveness of the undercover approaches is open to question. A report written during the war said:\n\nThe available evidence indicates that none of the Activities Agencies (Kosaku Kikan) produced any significant volume of intelligence-type information. Although many reports from operational units in New Guinea are available, only a few scattered references to 'native reports' as a source of intelligence have been noted. (56)\n\nThis comment, while probably true, misses the point that it is likely there was little intelligence of value to be revealed, and the contribution of the natives was substantial in reporting the presence of downed airmen or any infiltrating patrol activity.\n\nThere was no pattern of 'left-behind' units in the over-run areas of New Guinea, and anyway, performance was likely to be poor owing to the straitened circumstances of the Japanese especially after mid-1944 when the main challenge was keeping a starving army in some sort of fighting condition, and their lack of capacity to act on intelligence.\n\n(Significantly, the original name for the Nakano School in 1938 was the 'Training Unit for Rear Duties Agents'. (57))\n\nMembers of the Allied missions into the New Guinea wilds were occasionally caught and tortured, and some radios and cipher books were captured. Certainly natives disclosed information that harmed the Allies on many occasions. The extent to which the Japanese were able to obtain any information of relevance that significantly impacted on the Allies in New Guinea using these sources must remain a matter of speculation. When one looks at the traditional undercover methods, there is only limited evidence in New Guinea. The use of double agents, for example, with which the Japanese elsewhere were very familiar, was unlikely to be high given the lack of information available and the lack of a sophisticated populace seeking to traffic in technical or military information. So where did the Japanese get their intelligence? Their most productive methods overall were claimed to be intelligence gained from agents and information obtained from POWs. (58) In New Guinea, the work of the Nakano agents was important along with the natives; men such as Major Niiho were active in interrogating POWs; while code breaking and diplomatic channels might have assisted.\n\nThere is no valid means of determining the success of the agencies, the raiding parties or the pacification exercises: it was done to achieve an end and that end was not realised. Nor did the Japanese have the capacity to parachute agents behind the lines or to undertake significant acts of subversion or create panic by the use of explosives--what did one blow up in New Guinea? The raiding units did what they could with camps, bridges and airfields but one needs to remember the sad state of the retreating forces before one speculates on major achievements using subversion.\n\nAllen summed it up well when he suggested that \"much of Nakano's work was rendered nugatory by the surrender in any case\". (59) Impressive as the feats of the Nakano agents may have been, they were simply unable to turn the tide of battle.\n\n(1) For the purposes of this paper New Guinea is taken as the island mass comprising the areas of Dutch New Guinea, New Guinea and Papua, and adjacent islands.\n\n(2) Peter Elphick, Far Eastern File: The Intelligence War in the Far East 1930-1945, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1997, pages 34 and 35.

This company was established in 1921 and became very successful in agricultural enterprises--and especially so in assisting the Japanese Navy in intelligence gathering. Its founder, Matsui Haruji, convinced of the importance of the southward expansion, proposed in the 1930s that the Japanese acquire Dutch New Guinea. Matsui's company was well established there, with a focus on mining and plantations.\n\n(7) Richard Hall, The Secret State: Australia's Spy Industry, Cassell, Sydney, 1978, page 28, says that prior to the war, Australian intelligence services had spies on luggers so they could watch the Japanese, and that agents were in New Guinea to study Japanese shipping movements.\n\n(8) See Archives A 8911/1/266, 'Detection of Japanese Espionage, Northern Australia and Contacts with Aboriginals'\n\n(9) Mark Peattie, 'Nanshin: The Southward Advance, 1931-1941 as a Prelude to the Japanese Occupation of Southeast Asia', in Peter Duus et al (eds) The Japanese Wartime Empire 1931-1945, Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, 1997, page 227 and Elphick, op cit, page 38. Also see Stephen Mercado, The Shadow Warriors of Nakano: A History of the Imperial Japanese Army's Elite Intelligence School, Brasseys Inc, Washington DC, 2002, page xi--note that he almost invariably uses any synonym other than kikan when referring to these units.

Also see Stephen Mercado, 'An Insight Into Japanese CI', International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, Volume 15 No 4, Winter 2002-2003, pages 628-632 for the use of agents in Japan. Note that kikans or agencies were not only the work of Nakano agents: Elphick, op cit, page 38, said that such agencies had been established from the late 1920s in China, Manchuria and Mongolia.\n\n(12) WB Simpson, Special Agent in the Pacific, World War II: Counter Intelligence--Military, Political and Economic, Rivercross Publishing, New York, 1995 at page 46 says the Kempeitai served as an agent for the Tokuma Kikan\n\n(13) Archives A8911/1/11, 'Espionage (Japanese) Includes Reports of Japanese Associations and Activities', and see attached 'Notes on Tokumu Kikan', pages 5-6. Also see Mercado, Shadow Warriors, op tit, passim and AWM 54 423/4/115, 'Notes on the Tokuma Kikan, and Japanese Intelligence Organisations, 1944', page 7 for more examples\n\n(14) Louis Allen, 'The Nakano School', in Proceedings of the British Association for Japanese Studies, Volume 10, 1985, pages 9-18 at pages 14-17. There is some level of disagreement over where the boat landed and what boat was actually used, but the basic facts remain: see Allen, ibid, page 17 for some options and Alan Powell, The Shadow's Edge: Australia's Northern War, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, 1988, page 224 where he gives a new boat name and new place of landing for the same operation. Powell extends the long list of sightings and landings made by the Japanese over that given in Archives A 8911/1/266, op cit.\n\n(15) See www.info-indo.com/indonesia/history/eastindies19.htm\n\n(16) See AWM 55 12/28, 'Kempei', page 5 for an example of natives being used as soldiers in the Markham River area in June 1943, and Iwamoto Hiromitsu, 'Japanese Occupation of Rabaul, 1942-1945', http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/1542365201/1999symposiumpaper/iwamoto.html Interestingly, establishment of civil administration lagged months behind both the occupation and the establishment of kikans, indicating that the existing forces were considered most capable administrators.\n\n(17) AWM 54 627/1/8, 'Japanese Intelligence Collecting Agencies--Their Organisation and Function in Peace and in War, 29 May 1945', page 33. (There are quite surprising similarities between the work of the Allies and the Japanese in the undercover tactics they used in New Guinea, including the establishment of spying operations with the natives.)

Dobo was the place where Reverend Leonard Kentish was executed--Kentish was taken from the wreck of the HMAS Patricia Cam by the pilot of a float plane on 22 January 1943 and executed at Dobo on 4 May 1943--www.ozatwar.com/japsbomb/kentishaffair.htm\n\n(19) Diary of Captain G B Black MC, relating to Locust mission, on loan to author.\n\n(20) AWM 55 12/43, 'Intelligence Gathering', page 30\n\n(21) ibid, page 21\n\n(22) ibid, page 21\n\n(23) ibid, pages 23-24\n\n(24) Robert Piper, The Hidden Chapters: Untold Stories of Australians at War in the Pacific, Pagemasters, Carlton, Victoria, 1995, pages 77-82 has the story of three aircraft that landed at Table Bay, east of Port Moresby, in September 1942 and the men proceeded to walk inland--but to contact agents or seek another Kokoda trail is unknown\n\n(25) See Kengoro Tanaka, Operations of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces in the Papua New Guinea Theater During World War II, Japan Papua New Guinea Goodwill Society, Tokyo, 1980, page 169 for the example of the Oba Raiding Party\n\n(26) Small parties of four men were active on Guadalcanal--Japanese Monograph No 34, 17th Army Operations, Volume 1, Department of the Army, Washington DC, page 144\n\n(27) No evidence was found in David Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, Canberra, Australian War Memorial, 1961, of any attack of this style near the dates mentioned. For a history of the guerrilla activities and the Saito group, see Japanese Night Combat, Japanese Monographs, Department of the Army, Washington DC, Part 3, pages 529-535. Most Japanese official histories of the New Guinea land war contain some mention of the Saito group. See Japanese Monograph No 41, 18th Army Operations, Volume 5, Department of the Army, Washington DC, pages 13-14 which describes a commendation to Lt Sato of the Salto unit and details all operations.\n\n(28) Mercado, Shadow Warriors, op cit, page 119\n\n(29) ibid, page 87\n\n(30) Japanese Night Combat, op cit, at page 534 says it was in the spring of 1945 that a decision to establish wide-scale raiding units was taken.\n\n(31) Japanese Monograph No 40, 18th Army Operations Volume 4, Department of the Army, Washington DC, page 230. The Japanese author of one history suggested that the claims made by raiding units might have been exaggerated--See Japanese Night Combat, op cit, page 535. Also, Japanese Demobilisation Bureau, Reports of General MacArthur, op cit, page 349 refers to the establishment of formalised parties--the 1st Raiding Party was established in January 1944 and added to the Order of Battle for the 2nd Area Army, and other units were sent to Dutch New Guinea but arrived too late to take part in action. (Some 40 Nakano agents led the 1st and 2nd Raiding Units in battle.) Raiding parties under different terminology were active all through the war in New Guinea, and the 2nd Raiding Units were most effective on Moratai--see Japanese Monograph No 13, North of Australia Operations Record 1943-1945, Department of the Army, Washington DC, page 41; Japanese Monograph No 136, North of Australia Operations, Supplement, Department of the Army, Washington DC, page 43a; and GH Fearnside, Half to Remember: Reminiscences of an Australian Infantry Soldier in World War II, Haldane Publishing, Sydney, 1975, page 191\n\n(32) Not surprisingly, perhaps, an Allied intelligence report dated 29 March 1945 indicated that natives were well disposed toward the Japanese in the area surrounding the \"8th Naval Construction Station ... who have been cooperative in matters such as billeting, supplies and transport\"--AWM 55 12/43, op cit, page 47.\n\n(33) The total number of Nakano agents here is unknown although it is assumed that, as in the east where guerrilla actions were led by Nakano agents, the leaders and squad leaders at least would have been Nakano graduates. The usual practice was for the Nakano agents to act as leaders then recruit the men, and natives, required. In the official reports, terms such as \"special intelligence units' and \"pacification units' were commonly used but not 'kikans'--see AWM 55 4/4/6,' Allied and Japanese Operations Among Natives of Dutch New Guinea'.\n\n(34) For a review of the activities of the agencies, see AWM 54 627/1/8, op cit, passim. Stephen Robinson, 'What Role did Propaganda and Spying Play in New Guinea', http://airp.awm.gov.au/airp/remember/nsf/pages/NT0005112 says at page 2 that the Tatsu organisation \"infiltrated teams into New Guinea by parachute and flying boat\" which sounds unnecessary given that Tatsu was based in the Sarmi area which the Japanese controlled. Late in the war, the Sato Construction and Repair Unit (another title for a kikan) was assigned to pacification duties--Japanese Monograph No 40, op cit, page 238. It is worth noting that Allied patrols were in the Wissel Lakes area (400 miles NW of Merauke) for 14 months in 1943-44 and in the Hollandia area for extensive periods in 1944-45--see Gavin Long, The Final Campaigns, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, 1963, page 620, and GB Courtney, Silent Feet: The History of Z Special Operations 1942-1945, Slouch Hat, McRae, Victoria, 1993, Chapter 8\n\n(35) Elphick, op cit, page 226\n\n(36) Mercado, Shadow Warriors, op cit, page 235. The Tatsu unit was involved with the interrogation of LG Siffleet, a member of the Whiting party captured in October 1943. He was later beheaded at Aitape--AWM 55 4/4/6, op cit, page 5\n\n(37) Japanese Monograph No 136, op cit, pages 5,8,13,29,33,37,38,39,42,43\n\n(38) AWM 55 4/4/6, op cit, pages 12, 16\n\n(39) AWM 55 5/26, Enemy Publications, 'Intelligence Report File of the Kami Organisation (Special Service Organisation), 25 January 1945, Intelligence Report No 1', page 7\n\n(40) ibid\n\n(41) AWM 55 4/4/6, op cit, page B\n\n(42) ibid, page 19\n\n(43) AWM 55 5/26, op cit, page 49.
