In response, we apply the lens of climate change, gender equality and First Nations to all our work, engagements and partnerships to ensure we donât lose sight of the inequity these areas face.\n\nView our strategy\n\nOur impact and reach\n\nAt our core we are driven to âgive backâ and resolve problems at the root cause.\n\nOver our history, Minderoo has established ground-breaking programs and research that has and continues to create positive change within society. We maximise our impact by focusing on our beneficiaries, consistent geographies and key stakeholders.\n\nAustralia is our home and will always be our top priority and proving ground.\n\nAs our projects mature, we will prioritise the needs of our Asia Pacific neighbours.\n\nRecognising that some issues require global solutions, we maintain a global outlook, collaborating with partners who understand local contexts to solve global problems and bringing the best ideas back to Australia to improve outcomes for the beneficiaries we serve at home."
