Other educational centers reach across California and beyond.\n\nAll UC campuses offering undergraduate education use the same application for undergrads.\n\nUC’s statewide network of researchers and educators delivers science-based solutions to California’s most pressing problems in agriculture, natural resources, economic growth, nutrition and youth development. Their mission is to improve the lives of all Californians.\n\nUC Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR) brings research and education to all 58 California counties through UC Cooperative Extension and 13 statewide programs such as 4-H, UC Master Gardener, and CalFresh Healthy Living, UC, along with nine Research and Extension Centers across the state."
