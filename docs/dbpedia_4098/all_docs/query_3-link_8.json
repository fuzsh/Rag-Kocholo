        "text": "A Compatible Use Study, formerly referred to as a Joint Land Use Study, represents a community-driven, cooperative, and strategic planning process to protect and preserve military readiness and defense capabilities while supporting continued community growth and economic development. The study is based upon technical information the military service provides to describe current military operations. The compatibility analysis results in a series of recommended actions included in an implementation strategy to guide compatible community development in support of continued military operations.\n\nCharles County, with financial support from the Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (formerly known as Office of Economic Adjustment), Department of Defense, completed the Blossom Point Joint Land Use Study (JLUS), in April 2012. The JLUS represents a collaborative effort among BPRF, Charles County, local elected officials, planning commissioners, local military base command staff, community business leaders, including the Charles County Chamber of Commerce, homebuilders, real estate interests, landowners, and neighboring residents. The JLUS includes an analysis of compatibility factors that may adversely impact the installation and military operations and subsequent recommendations to address the identified concerns.\n\nThe specific objectives of the Blossom Point JLUS included Charles County working with the U.S. Department of the Army and Naval Research Lab to:\n\nProvide an environment in which, to the extent possible, land uses in proximity to Blossom Point remain compatible with the operations of the Blossom Point Research Facility;\n\nFacilitate the ability of Blossom Point Research Facility to achieve its mission, maintain military readiness, and support national defense objectives; and\n\nPromote health, safety, and welfare of military and civilian personnel living and working near Blossom Point Research Facility. 9​\n\nThe most significant compatibility issues identified in the Blossom Point JLUS include frequency interference, noise, vibration, vertical obstructions, and trespassing. To address these issues, the JLUS includes a series of recommended actions for Charles County, the U.S. Army, and other agencies and stakeholders to implement. The six primary recommendations include changes to the Charles County Comprehensive Plan that incorporate BPRF, review of special exception applications to include BPRF involvement, when appropriate, updates and expansions to real estate disclosures so that potential buyers are made aware of potential issues related to BPRF, acquisition of target properties to prevent incompatible development, review of the zoning ordinance, and periodic reviews of the JLUS.\n\nCompleted implementation actions of JLUS recommendations include adding the Federally owned lands - military installations section to the comprehensive plan, and including figures to illustrate the Military Awareness Area and other areas of potential concern for BPRF. Charles County staff forward any land use development applications within the Military Awareness Area to BPRF staff for review and comment. However, given that BPRF is bounded on the west, east, and south by water and to the north by the Cedar Point Wildlife Management Area, Charles County receives few development applications. A fence has been installed along the north property boundary to address potential hunter trespass on BPRF property.\n\n​"
