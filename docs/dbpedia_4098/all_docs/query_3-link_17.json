        "text": "The Wood Research Laboratory​ is located in the Forest Products Building located on the Purdue University main campus.\n\nThis laboratory addresses timely research and technology transfer topics in the areas of product and process engineering of wood based products; wood composites; and the use, reuse and care of wood in historic preservation and restoration.\n\nTake the tour of the Hardwoods of the Central Midwest and find descriptions and images of each species of wood along with grad, history, color and strength.\n\nFacility features\n\nModel 40 Thermwood CNC router\n\nControlled environment room housing\n\nAn electro-hydraulic, computer controlled 55-kip MTS testing system\n\nA 30-kip universal testing machine with computer-based data acquisition capability\n\nA 60-kip universal testing machine\n\nComputer simulation facility for process engineering of furniture\n\nStructural performance tester of furniture and cabinets\n\nComputer-based NDE facility\n\nMany one-of-a-kind testing and test support apparatuses, e.g., computer-aided dimension measurement Station and linear variation measurement instrument\n\nWalk-in, controlled environment chambers\n\nZeiss light microscope and access to electron microscopes\n\nComplete specimen preparation shop.\n\nFacility Use\n\nStudents, staff, and faculty must go through safety training to use the Wood Research Lab (WRL). We use a website called OpenPassport for the initial training. You can watch the following Instructional WRL Video to learn how to use OpenPassport. Then go to OpenPassport to begin the training process. Once there use the Purdue log in and open the The Wood Research Lab group. Then you will need to join The Wood Research Lab group. Watch the General Safety video and take the challenge. Then you need to accept the pending badge. After receiving the General Safety badge, you may work on the tool badges. After receiving the General Safety and tool badges, come to the lab and take a “use” test with Dan Bollock (the WRL manager). By earning the badge and passing the “use” test you will gain access to that particular tool in the WRL.\n\nResearch faculty"
