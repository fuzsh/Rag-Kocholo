For example, search both \"microscope\" and \"microscopy,\" or \"mass spectrometer\" and \"mass spectrometry.\"\n\n*This database of core facilties is in development, with the majority of shared facilities entered as of 9/1/2018. Completion is expected in the summer of 2018. If you have a new shared research facility (with approved external rates) and would like to include the instrument or service in the database, please email osvpr@psu.edu.\n\nInnovation Gateway is designed to connect Penn State researchers to the technical challenges and needs of industry. This framework was created by Penn State and has resulted in efficient and successful research partnerships across the University. Industry partners are able to capture a variety of proposals from world-class experts, and researchers are able to quickly translate their work from idea to impact.\n\nClick here for an overview of Innovation Gateway process (PDF) for researchers and companies. Penn State researchers may view current opportunities at innovation.psu.edu.\n\nPenn State's more than 700 industrial research partnerships are supported by a streamlined intellecutal property (IP) policy. To learn more about IP at Penn State, contact the Office of Industrial Partnerships at researchpartnerships.psu.edu.\n\nPhoto: Barbara Hackman Franklin Atrium, Pattee Library.

The index provides a yearly snapshot of the size of each research library's collections and its capacity to provide services to students, faculty and staff, as well as to visiting researchers. The University Libraries consistently rank among the top 10 among more than 110 peer institutionsâ€™ libraries surveyed."
