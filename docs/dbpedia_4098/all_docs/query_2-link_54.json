        "text": "In September 2023, a team of scientists quantified, for the first time, all nine processes that regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth system.\n\nThese nine planetary boundaries were first proposed by former centre director Johan Rockstr√∂m and a group of 28 internationally renowned scientists in 2009.\n\nSince then, their framework has been revised several times.\n\nNow the latest update not only quantified all boundaries, it also concludes that six of the nine boundaries have been transgressed.\n\nCrossing boundaries increases the risk of generating large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes. Drastic changes will not necessarily happen overnight, but together the boundaries mark a critical threshold for increasing risks to people and the ecosystems we are part of.\n\nBoundaries are interrelated processes within the complex biophysical Earth system. This means that a global focus on climate change alone is not sufficient for increased sustainability. Instead, understanding the interplay of boundaries, especially climate, and loss of biodiversity, is key in science and practice.\n\nSince its first conceptualization, the planetary boundaries framework has generated enormous interest within science, policy, and practice.\n\nKey publications\n\n2023\n\nAll boundaries are finally assessed in the third major update to the framework which is published in Science Advances. Six boundaries are now transgressed and pressure is increasing on all boundary processes except ozone depletion.\n\nNew scientific evidence now enabled the team to quantify the boundary of Atmospheric Aerosol Loading, which according to the study is not transgressed yet despite rising pressures.\n\nThe team behind this paper used a new approach to assess Biosphere integrity and concluded that this boundary was transgressed during the late 19th century.\n\nRead \"Earth beyond six of nine Planetary Boundaries\" here ¬ª\n\n2022\n\nIn January 2022, 14 scientists concluded in the scientific journal Environmental Science and Technology that humanity has exceeded a planetary boundary related to environmental pollutants and other ‚Äúnovel entities‚Äù including plastics.\n\nIn April 2022, a reassessment of the planetary boundary for freshwater indicated that it has now been transgressed. This conclusion is due to the inclusion of ‚Äúgreen water‚Äù ‚Äì the water available to plants - into the boundary assessment for the first time.\n\nThe assessment, published in the journal Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, is based on evidence of widespread changes in soil moisture relative to mid-Holocene and pre-industrial conditions and green-water driven destabilization of ecological, atmospheric, and biogeochemical processes.\n\n2017\n\nSince 2017, Johan Rockstr√∂m‚Äôs ERC Advanced Grant Earth Resilience in the Anthropocene funded a new phase in this work. Centre researchers including Sarah Cornell, Tiina H√§yh√§, Ingo Fetzer, Steve Lade, Andrea Downing, Jonathan Donges, and Avit Bhowmik have all been actively involved in advancing these frontier areas, and building collaborative research links among a growing international community of scientists.\n\n2015\n\nThe second update of the whole framework was published in Science. It stated that society‚Äôs activities have pushed climate change, biodiversity loss, shifts in nutrient cycles (nitrogen and phosphorus), and land use beyond the boundaries into unprecedented territory.\n\nRead \"Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet\" here ¬ª\n\n2009\n\nThe orignial conceptualisation of the Planetary Boundaries was first published in Ecology & Society and late in Nature.\n\nEcology & Society: Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity\n\nNature: A safe operating space for humanity\n\nPolicy and practice\n\n2018\n\nOperationalizing the concept of a safe operating space at the EU level ‚Äì first steps and explorations. Stockholm Resilience Centre Technical Report, prepared in collaboration with Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University, Sweden.\n\n2017\n\nStockholm Resilience Centre became the scientific partner in a research project with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Swedish clothing retailer H&M group, working to integrate the planetary boundaries framework and the circular economy concept.\n\n2013-2016\n\nA report to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency Pdf, 901.8 kB. (Pdf, 901.8 kB) assessed Sweden‚Äôs responsibility, and a 2016 study for the European Environment Agency assessed the contribution to global boundaries both of activities within Europe‚Äôs territory and of effects of its citizens‚Äô consumption. Increasingly, companies are asking for guidance on putting the planetary boundaries into business practice.\n\nThe World Business Council on Sustainable Development, a forum for 200 companies including some of the best-known brands in the world, used the planetary boundaries framework to shape their Action 2020 strategy. Since then, there has been further engagement with companies in financial investment, food, textiles, building, technology, and household goods sectors.\n\n2011\n\nFormer UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged global society to ‚ÄúHelp us defend the science that shows we are destabilising our climate and stretching planetary boundaries to a perilous degree.‚Äù\n\nCentre researchers kept planetary boundaries in the forefront of policy-advisory processes leading up to the agreement of the global Sustainable Development Goals. Policy-makers working at national and European levels are also interested, catalysing a research network, PB-net.org, which links scientists involved in translating the global framework to operational decision-making scales."
