        "text": "Ervan Garrison is Professor of Anthropology and Geology and former Head of the Department of Anthropology at UGA. He serves as a member of the Steering Committee of INAS.\n\nDr. Garrison is the author of several books, including Geological Methods for Archaeology, A History of Engineering and Technology: Artful Methods, and Techniques for Archaeological Geology. He pioneered the use of non-invasive techniques, such as ground penetrating radar, that permit the exploration and mapping of sensitive archaeological sites without disturbing or excavating them. He is a recognized expert in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in the state of Georgia. In 2008, Dr. Garrison led the UGA team that located the footprint of the Cherokee Female Seminary, a school in Park Hill, OK, which burned in 1887.\n\nDr. Garrison notes, \"With the recent breaking of the 'Clovis Barrier', New World archaeology has been freed to examine a new paradigm of earlier settlement of the Americas. The possibilities these present are immense, particularly for the potentially rich locales for evidence of coastal maritime groups. American archaeology has entered a new era of enhanced awareness of the rights of Indians to their ancestors' remains and patrimony. The use in the U.S. by less destructive means to locate and characterize the remains of human habitation is a hopeful sign of better archaeology practices. UGA has led in this area, using both digital radar and magnetic sensors in portable and laboratory settings to characterize archaeological finds. Having been lucky enough to have grown up in a rich Indian cultural setting, I am excited to participate in new and respectful ways in the study of the history and humanity of that part of our heritage.\""
