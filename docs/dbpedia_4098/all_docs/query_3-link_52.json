BSRP has a strong record of success in helping students to nurture their passion for research and succeed in graduate school and scientific careers. Students spend the summer performing original computational or experimental-based research in labs across the Broad's research areas, from cancer to infectious disease to computational biology. At the program's conclusion, students deliver oral and poster presentations on their research projects.\n\nBSRP features a rich curriculum outside the lab that emphasizes communication, collaborative problem-solving, graduate school preparation, and demystifying scientific careers. Our curriculum includes an intensive scientific communication course, seminars with leading scientists from Harvard and MIT, and weekly workshops focused on the graduate school application process, professional and personal development, and diversity and inclusion in the sciences.\n\nBenefits\n\n$5,400 stipend\n\nFree housing at partner university housing facilities\n\nAir or ground travel to and from Boston\n\nTravel sponsorship to present summer research at a national scientific conference\n\nMentored, cutting-edge research guided by leading scientists\n\nAcademic and career development seminars\n\nScientific communication course\n\nTeam-building and social activities in the dynamic, historic Boston area\n\nEligibility\n\nBSRP is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to help increase diversity in the genomics workforce.
