        "text": "Research\n\nWe are interested in the biology of maligant brain tumors, namely glioblastoma. We have active projects in cell adhesion mechanisms, cell-cell communication, and the interaction between tumor cells and the immune system. We also investigate sex differences in glioblastoma.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Justin Lathia leads a translational cancer stem cell research laboratory and is Vice Chair and Professor in the Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Sciences at the Lerner Research Institute (LRI), part of the Cleveland Clinic and also serves as the Director of Faculty Development for the LRI. Dr. Lathia is also the Scientific Director of the Rose Ella Burkhardt Brain Tumor & Neuro-Oncology Center at the Cleveland Clinic and the Melvin Burkhardt Endowed Chair in Neuro-Oncology Research. He is also the Reza Khatib MD Professor, and Co-Leader of the Molecular Oncology Program at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nDr. Lathia is a native of central Pennsylvania and received a B.S. and M.S. from Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA in 2003. While at Drexel, he developed targeted ultrasound contrast agents which preferentially bound to newly formed vessel in breast cancer models. After graduation from Drexel, Dr. Lathia completed his Ph.D. as part of the NIH-Cambridge Graduate Partnership Program. His work focused on the role of cell adhesion molecules during the development of the nervous system. After completing his Ph.D. in 2008 he completed post-doctoral fellowships at Duke and the Cleveland Clinic where he focused on the role of cell adhesion in regulating cancer stem cells in brain tumors. In 2012, Dr. Lathia moved to the Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences as an independent investigator and the work in his lab focuses on how the stem cell state is regulated in advanced cancers. Projects in the Lathia laboratory involve understanding how cancer stem cells interact with their surrounding microenvironment as well as one another with the goal of identifying unique pathways for therapeutic development. Work in the Lathia laboratory has resulted in a Phase 1 clinical trial aimed at targeting myeloid-derived suppressor cells that interact with cancer stem cells to suppress the immune system in glioblastoma.\n\nDr. Lathia has co-authored over 250 publications and work in his lab is currently supported by multiple National Institutes of Health grants and foundation grants. Dr. Lathia also contributes as a peer reviewer to over 155 journals, serves on the editorial board for Cell Reports, Cancer Research, and Neuro-Oncology, has served on multiple grant review panels for the National Institutes of Health and private foundations. He recently served as a co-editor for a cancer stem cell textbook. Dr. Lathia also serves as a co-organizer for the cancer stem cell meeting held in Cleveland in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2022. At each meeting, the three-day event drew over 300 attendees from over 25 states and 15 countries.\n\nEducation & Professional Highlights\n\nAppointed\n\n2010\n\nEducation & Fellowships\n\nFellowship - Cleveland Clinic\n\nNeuro-Oncology\n\nCleveland, OH USA\n\n2009\n\nFellowship - Duke University\n\nNeuro-Oncology\n\nDurham, NC USA\n\n2008\n\nGraduate Education - University of Cambridge (via NIH-Cambridge Graduate Partnership Program)\n\nPh.D., Stem Cell Biology, Neurology\n\nCambridge, UK\n\n2008\n\nGraduate School - Drexel University\n\nM.S., Biomedical Engineering\n\nPhiladelphia, PA USA\n\n2003\n\nUndergraduate - Drexel University\n\nB.S., Biomedical Engineering\n\nPhiladelphia, PA USA\n\n2003\n\nResearch\n\nOur main area of interest is understanding interactions within the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment that drive tumor progression. Currently, we focus on adhesion and cell-cell communication mechanisms utilized by cancer stem cells to promote their maintenance, tumor cell-immune cell interactions that drive tumorigenesis, and the contribution of metabolites, including those derived from the gut microbiome, to GBM progression. Our laboratory studies range from basic, mechanistic studies on cancer stem cell pathways and tumor microenvironment interactions to translational studies that interrogate patient samples\n\nAdhesion and cell-cell communication\n\nCells are driven by two main cues, an intrinsic and extrinsic program. Within the extrinsic programs, we are interested in how tumor cells interact with one another and the specialized extracellular matrix present in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we have projects focused on the adhesion protein junctional adhesion molecule A and the connexin proteins that mediate cell-cell communication through gap junctions. These interactions drive stem cell maintenance and may represent a new therapeutic angle for tumors.\n\nTumor-immune cell interactions\n\nAttempts to alter immune activation have been successful in other advanced cancers, but a series of diverse strategies has yet to markedly increase glioblastoma patient survival. We have shown that immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) correlate with poor GBM prognosis, drive cancer stem cell function, and interact with the tumor through multiple signaling networks that can be neutralized to increase immune activation.\n\nSex differences in glioblastoma\n\nWithin our study of MDSCs, we also interrogated MDSC subsets to reveal differences in localization and function in a sex-specific manner and identified sex-specific MDSC subset signaling programs that can be altered to increase immune activation and decrease GBM growth. We are currently investigating sex differences in other immune cell compartments.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nView publications for Justin Lathia, PhD\n\n(Disclaimer: This search is powered by PubMed, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
