Many of the knowledge and skills learned here are valuable for both perusing continued education (doctoral degrees in various academic or applied fields) and job market preparation.\n\nResearch\n\nConcussion Research\n\nThe primary line of concussion research is related to identifying and understanding the lingering deficits which appear to persist well past recovery on standard clinical testing. Research includes quantitative eye tracking and the monitoring of repetitive head impacts. With the inclusion of new technologies such as the Applied Science Laboratory head mounted and mobile eye tracking system as well as the Helmet Impact Telemetry System, faculty are attempting to answer a myriad of research questions regarding longitudinal recovery post-injury.\n\nResearch Team\n\nDedicated to the scientific understanding of sports-related concussion and their resulting consequences. The interdisciplinary research team is lead by Department of Health Sciences and Kinesiology faculty, Barry Munkasy, Ph.D., who works closely with a diverse array of faculty and students at Georgia Southern University as well as collaborative relationships with the University of Florida and the University of North Carolina – Charlotte.\n\nThe research team has received extensive coverage for the addition of the Helmet Impact Telemetry System (HITS) into the research from major newspapers including the Miami Herald, San Francisco Chronicle, Seattle Post, and the Charlotte Observer, among others. The team was profiled on WTGS FOX 28 , WMAZ in Macon, GA and Macon CBS, as well as NBC Nightly News.\n\nFunding Sources\n\nGeorgia Southern faculty have received funding from the National Institute of Health/Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Army Research Office Life Science Division, and the National Athletic Trainers’ Association Research and Education Foundation to support their research studies. Faculty and students have published multiple research papers in high impact peer-reviewed journals and presented at local, regional, and national sports medicine conferences.\n\nConcussion Information\n\nWhat is a Concussion?\n\nThe 4th International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport defines a concussions as, “a brain injury and is defined as a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces.”\n\nWhat is this 4th International Consensus Statement on Concussion?\n\nThe 4th International Consensus Statement on Concussion (or 4th CIS) was a gathering of leading experts, both clinicians and researchers, in Zurich, Switzerland which occurred in November 2012. This meeting occurs approximately every three years and the experts update the current knowledge and best-practice patterns for the medical management of concussions. The 4th CIS is freely available online from the Journal of Athletic Training.\n\nDo you have to get knocked unconscious in order for a concussion to have occurred?\n\nNo! In fact, the vast majority, probably over 90% of concussions do not involve loss of consciousness and 75% do not involve memory loss. A large scale study of NCAA athletes found that the most common symptoms of a concussion include: headache, blurred vision, feeling in a “fog” or just not feeling right, dizziness, feeling slowed down, concentration problems, sensitivity to light or noise, fatigue, drowsiness, and memory problems.\n\nCoaching Education Lab\n\nThe Coaching Education Lab supports teaching, service, research, advisement and employment opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and faculty in one of four nationally accredited university coaching education programs. The facility located on the Statesboro Campus in Hollis 1110 is staffed by coaching graduate students and includes personal computers, educational software, internet access, digital video and editing equipment and software, texts, CDs, videos, journals and identified websites. The Department of Health Sciences and Kinesiology Coaching Education Lab also hosts the national peer-reviewed electronic Journal of Coaching Education.\n\nNutrition and Food Science Lab\n\nIn Advanced Food Science, students investigate the chemical, physical, and biological properties of food ingredients. Particular focus is placed upon exploring the relationship between preparation methods, proportions of ingredients, and final product quality. Laboratory experiences include investigating the effects of time and temperature on egg deterioration, the manufacturing of cheese, the feasibility of using alternative sugars as sweeteners in baked products, the thickening abilities of various forms of plant starch, the role of gluten in baked products, the effects of temperature and pH on fruit and vegetable colorants and textural properties, the melting points of various commercially available lipids and their performance in pastry, novel meat alternatives, and other experiences. Students use objective and sensory techniques to evaluate food product quality in structured laboratories and then chart their results in laboratory reports.\n\nIn the Experimental Food Science course, students use research methodology and food science theory learned in Advanced Food Science to develop a new food product as well as objective and subjective measures to evaluate its quality. Students also evaluate and develop advertising materials for their food product and present their research in both formal and informal settings. Additional research opportunities in food science are available under faculty supervision. Upon completion of Experimental Food Science, students are prepared to assume entry level food development and evaluation positions in industry and government. Current and former employers of Nutrition and Food Science graduates include MasterFoods (M&M Mars), Crider Poultry, Braswell Food Company, Publix Supermarkets Development Kitchens, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPedagogy Lab\n\nThe Pedagogy Laboratory, located on the Statesboro Campus in Hollis 1109, is a resource and meeting center for students and faculty.
