Carskadon [MAC] 2023 Sleep and Circadian Rhythms Summer Research Fellowship\n\nApplications for the 2023 MAC Fellowship close December 31, 2022. See application details below.\n\nProgram of Research\n\nLight is the strongest environmental signal to the internal circadian (biological) clock of humans. Although the biological response to light has been investigated in adults, very little is known about how light influences the circadian clock of young children. The primary goal of this summer's study is to understand how light can advance the timing of the circadian clock of preschool-age children.\n\nWhat Research Apprentices Do\n\nThis summer study involves creating dim light conditions within a child's home for 3 days. On the first and third evening of the in-home assessment the child remains in dim light, and on the second morning the child is exposed to light during the hour before their usual waketime.\n\nApprentices will carry out multiple facets of data collection including saliva collection, setting up dim light conditions, training subjects, data entry, assisting with light exposure, and entertaining subjects. Data collection will be done in teams, and each team will be assigned to work certain days of the week - not always Monday through Friday, often Saturday and Sunday - in research protocols that involve working unusual schedules (early shifts may start at 5:00 AM and late shifts may end at 12:00 AM).\n\nCommitment\n\nBootcamp: There will be an all-day training on April 22 on main campus that apprentices are required to attend. There are no exceptions.\n\nSummer: The apprenticeship runs from May 15 - August 25. Apprentices are expected to devote the summer entirely to this academic research experience and not have other jobs or take course work.\n\nRetreat: Each apprentice will complete a presentation based upon library research, presented to the group at the end-of-summer retreat at YMCA Snow Mountain Ranch from August 22 - August 25. Additionally, invited scientists in the areas of sleep or circadian rhythms research will give presentations describing their career paths and their scientific research.\n\nStipend and Other Benefits\n\nEvery apprentice will receive $4000. The UROP Assistantship covers $2000, and those who receive the award will be paid an additional $2000 by the lab. Those who do not receive the UROP Assistantship will be paid $4000 directly by the lab. Stipends are subject to taxes and fees, and payments will occur every 2 weeks across the summer starting 2 weeks after the program begins.\n\nApprentices are required to submit a UROP Assistantship application by February 17, 2023. Any funds not covered by UROP will be covered by the lab.\n\nPaid travel and lodging for YMCA Snow Mountain Ranch retreat.\n\nApplication\n\nApplications for the Summer 2023 Research Fellowship are now CLOSED.\n\nWe will be accepting applications until December 31, 2022. Interviews will be held on a rolling basis. The earlier you submit your application, the earlier it will be reviewed by our team.\n\nThis research opportunity is open to all CU Boulder undergraduate students. A preview of the application questions can be found here. Please fill out the MAC Fellowship Application. It will ask you to attach your current resume or CV, and unofficial transcript. Candidates will be interviewed in person. Upon acceptance into the program, apprentices will be required to pass a background check.\n\nRecent / Key Publications\n\nHartstein, L.E., Wong, S.D., Abbas, L., Choubai, S., Wilson, J.N., Jablin, T., LeBourgeois, M.K.
