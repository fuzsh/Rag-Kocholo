        "text": "The powerMAX Power Management and Control System uses hardened computing and communications, including adaptive relaying and cybersecurity, to provide high-performance control and reliability.\n\nOur control algorithms and demand response operate quickly and accurately to preserve the balance between load and generation, maintain system stability and, most importantly, make sure the base is operating at all times.\n\nUnlike many other microgrid control systems, powerMAX is modular and scalable; you can purchase and build your system in blocks over time as funding permits.\n\nKey Benefits\n\nSeamless and automatic islanding from and reconnection to the bulk power grid as needed.\n\nElimination of single points of failure by sharing the load between generators.\n\nEnhanced cybersecurity with software-defined networking (SDN).\n\nMIL-STD-TMS compliance and full interoperability with other power system components.\n\nMicrogrids have low inertia compared to the larger macrogrid. The powerMAX system is ideal because the SEL Real-Time Automation Controller (RTAC) makes automated control decisions at near-relay speeds, allowing the system to maintain the balance between generation and load in response to fast-developing adverse conditions.\n\nIf a generator or communications are lost, the system automatically reroutes power. If generation doesn’t meet the load requirements, powerMAX prioritizes loads and minimizes load shedding to maintain power.\n\nFor military installations that use backup diesel generation, powerMAX can parallel existing diesel generators. The benefits of paralleling include wet-stacking correction and fuel savings, which increase resiliency and prolong mission capability.\n\nAdditionally, the powerMAX control system doesn’t rely on proximity to any given generation source or load; it can be located anywhere within the base, allowing for a more strategic base layout.\n\nFlexible Integration and Retrofits\n\nSEL’s TMS-MIL-STD-compliant microgrid is unique in that it works with all makes and models of generators, inverters, and loads. You can easily retrofit existing commercial off-the-shelf and tactical microgrid system (TMS) generators in the field with an SEL control system. If a generation device communicates, we can connect, control, and parallel it.\n\nSEL microgrid systems use a defense-in-depth approach to guarantee information assurance and secure operation. We apply cybersecurity in a layered approach that maximizes reliability and minimizes the intrusiveness of controls on existing critical processes.\n\nIn addition to physical security, SEL implements four digital zones of defense in our systems.\n\nThe cybersecurity structure in SEL microgrid controls ensures resilient power to critical facilities and protects not only against malicious attacks, but also against internal errors, with the ability to control user access to different information throughout the system.\n\nIn 2017, SEL powerMAX was recognized as the top-performing control system at a microgrid symposium hosted by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center and the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.\n\nLater that year, a powerMAX microgrid control system won a rigorous, 21-week procurement competition held by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\n\nSEL outperformed the competition by achieving economical operation and superior stability under a wide array of difficult operating conditions. A powerMAX microgrid control system is now installed at the NREL Energy Systems Integration Facility, where it is used to test emerging microgrid technologies."
