The Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) delivers evidence-based solutions that enhance undersea warfighter health and performance. Located at the Submarine Base New London, NSMRL researchers have local access to Submarine Squadrons 4 and 12, the Naval Submarine School, the Naval Submarine Support Center, the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, the Undersea Warfighting Development Center, the Submarine Learning Center, and an important center of submarine design, construction, and lifecycle support: General Dynamics Electric Boat.

The laboratory ensures the superiority of submariners and divers by conducting research in nine core research areas: undersea warfighter health and performance, submariner psychological fitness and resiliency, human systems integration, submarine atmospheric monitoring, bioeffects of underwater sound and blast, hearing conservation, diving and hyperbaric research, disabled submarine survival, escape, and rescue, and undersea health epidemiology.

Mission: To sustain the readiness and superiority of our undersea warriors through innovative health and performance research.

Vision: To lead the world in delivering science solutions to ensure undersea warrior dominance.
