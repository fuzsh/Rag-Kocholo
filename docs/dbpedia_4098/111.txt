History

It was founded by a scientist named Garrison Slate, who wanted a nationwide chain of research laboratories unconnected to the government or any business interests.[1] He succeeded not only on a national scale, but an international one as well: S.T.A.R. Labs maintained facilities in Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan, as well as in the United States, with the total number of facilities numbering between twenty and thirty in the last recorded count.

Lex Luthor has attempted to buy out S.T.A.R. on at least one occasion. The technology used to maintain Cyborg's cybernetic parts comes from S.T.A.R. Labs. These parts were also used to create cybernetic enhancements for Ron Evers.

The central branch in Metropolis is most likely one of the more recognizable branches, due to its connections to Superman and the various supervillains they hold. During the Armageddon 2001 event, the Metropolis branch was destroyed in the fight between Captain Atom and Monarch, but has since been rebuilt. Also, S.T.A.R. Labs offered help during the time when the Sun-Eater extinguished the sun.
