    "text": "As Rochefoucault his Maxims drew\n\nFrom Nature, I believe 'em true:\n\nThey argue no corrupted Mind\n\nIn him; the Fault is in Mankind. This Maxim more than all the rest [5]\n\nIs thought too base for human Breast;\n\n\"In all Distresses of our Friends\n\nWe first consult our private Ends,\n\n\"While Nature kindly bent to ease us,\n\nPoints out some Circumstance to please us. [10] If this perhaps your Patience move\n\nLet Reason and Experience prove. We all behold with envious Eyes,\n\nOur Equal rais'd above our Size;\n\nWho wou'd not at a crowded Show, [15]\n\nStand high himself, keep others low?\n\nI love my Friend as well as you,\n\nBut would not have him stop my View;\n\nThen let him have the higher Post;\n\nI ask but for an Inch at most. [20] If in a Battle you should find,\n\nOne, whom you love of all Mankind,\n\nHad some heroick Action done,\n\nA Champion kill'd, or Trophy won;\n\nRather than thus be over-topt, [25]\n\nWould you not wish his Lawrels 3 cropt? Dear honest Ned is in the Gout,\n\nLies rackt with Pain, and you without: 4\n\nHow patiently you hear him groan!\n\nHow glad the Case is not your own! [30] What Poet would not grieve to see,\n\nHis Brethren write as well as he?\n\nBut rather than they should excel,\n\nHe'd wish his Rivals all in Hell. Her End when Emulation misses, [35]\n\nShe turns to Envy, Stings and Hisses:\n\nThe strongest Friendship yields to Pride,\n\nUnless the Odds be on our Side. Vain human Kind! Fantastick Race!\n\nThy various Follies, who can trace? [40]\n\nSelf-love, Ambition, Envy, Pride,\n\nTheir Empire in our Hearts divide:\n\nGive others Riches, Power, and Station,\n\n'Tis all on me an Usurpation.\n\nI have no Title to aspire; [45]\n\nYet, when you sink, I seem the higher.\n\nIn Pope, 5 I cannot read a Line,\n\nBut with a Sigh, I wish it mine:\n\nWhen he can in one Couplet fix\n\nMore Sense than I can do in Six [50]\n\nIt gives me such a jealous Fit,\n\nI cry, Pox take him, and his Wit. Why must I be outdone by Gay,\n\nIn my own hum'rous biting Way? Arbuthnot 6 is no more my Friend, [55]\n\nWho dares to Irony pretend;\n\nWhich I was born to introduce,\n\nRefin'd it first, and shew'd its Use. St. John, as well as Pultney 7 knows,\n\nThat I had some repute for Prose; [60]\n\nAnd till they drove me out of Date,\n\nCould maul a Minister of State:\n\nIf they have mortify'd my Pride,\n\nAnd made me throw my Pen aside;\n\nIf with such Talents Heav'n hath blest 'em [65]\n\nHave I not Reason to detest 'em? To all my Foes, dear Fortune, send\n\nThy Gifts, but never to my Friend:\n\nI tamely can endure the first,\n\nBut, this with Envy makes me burst. [70] Thus much may serve by way of Proem, 8\n\nProceed we therefore to our Poem. The Time is not remote, when I\n\nMust by the Course of Nature dye:\n\nWhen I foresee my special Friends, [75]\n\nWill try to find their private Ends:\n\nTho' it is hardly 9 understood,\n\nWhich way my Death can do them good;\n\nYet, thus methinks, I hear 'em speak;\n\nSee, how the Dean begins to break: [80]\n\nPoor Gentleman, he droops apace, 10\n\nYou plainly find it in his Face:\n\nThat old Vertigo in his Head, 11\n\nWill never leave him, till he's dead:\n\nBesides, his Memory decays, [85]\n\nHe recollects not what he says;\n\nHe cannot call his Friends to Mind;\n\nForgets the Place where last he din'd:\n\nPlyes you with Stories o'er and o'er,\n\nHe told them fifty Times before. [90]\n\nHow does he fancy we can sit,\n\nTo hear his out-of-fashion'd Wit?\n\nBut he takes up with younger Fokes,\n\nWho for his Wine will bear his Jokes:\n\nFaith, he must make his Stories shorter, [95]\n\nOr change his Comrades once a Quarter:\n\nIn half the Time, he talks them round;\n\nThere must another Sett be found. For Poetry, he's past his Prime,\n\nHe takes an Hour to find a Rhime: [100]\n\nHis Fire is out, his Wit decay'd,\n\nHis Fancy sunk, his Muse a Jade. 12\n\nI'd have him throw away his Pen;\n\nBut there's no talking to some Men. And, then their Tenderness appears, [105]\n\nBy adding largely to my Years:\n\n\"He's older than he would be reckon'd,\n\nAnd well remembers Charles the Second. 13 \"He hardly drinks a Pint of Wine;\n\nAnd that, I doubt, 14 is no good Sign. [110]\n\nHis Stomach too begins to fail:\n\nLast Year we thought him strong and hale;\n\nBut now, he's quite another Thing;\n\nI wish he may hold out till Spring. Then hug themselves, and reason thus; [115]\n\n\"It is not yet so bad with us.\" In such a Case they talk in Tropes, 15\n\nAnd, by their Fears express their Hopes:\n\nSome great Misfortune to portend,\n\nNo Enemy can match a Friend; [120]\n\nWith all the Kindness they profess,\n\nThe Merit of a lucky Guess,\n\n(When daily Howd'y's come of Course,\n\nAnd Servants answer; Worse and Worse)\n\nWou'd please 'em better than to tell, [125]\n\nThat, God be prais'd, the Dean is well.\n\nThen he who prophecy'd the best,\n\nApproves his Foresight to the rest:\n\n\"You know, I always fear'd the worst,\n\nAnd often told you so at first\": [130]\n\nHe'd rather chuse that I should dye,\n\nThan his Prediction prove a Lye.\n\nNot one foretels I shall recover;\n\nBut, all agree, to give me over. Yet shou'd some Neighbour feel a Pain, [135]\n\nJust in the Parts, where I complain;\n\nHow many a Message would he send?\n\nWhat hearty Prayers that I should mend?\n\nEnquire what Regimen I kept;\n\nWhat gave me Ease, and how I slept? [140]\n\nAnd more lament, when I was dead,\n\nThan all the Sniv'llers round my Bed. My good Companions, never fear,\n\nFor though you may mistake a Year;\n\nThough your Prognosticks run too fast, [145]\n\nThey must be verify'd at last. \"Behold the fatal Day arrive!\n\nHow is the Dean? He's just alive.\n\nNow the departing Prayer is read:\n\nHe hardly breathes. The Dean is dead. [150]\n\nBefore the Passing-Bell 16 begun,\n\nThe News thro' half the Town has run.\n\nO, may we all for Death prepare!\n\nWhat has he left? And who's his Heir?\n\nI know no more than what the News is, [155]\n\n'Tis all bequeath'd to publick Uses. 17\n\nTo publick Use! A perfect Whim!\n\nWhat had the Publick done for him!\n\nMeer Envy, Avarice, and Pride!\n\nHe gave it all: â€” But first he dy'd. [160]\n\nAnd had the Dean, in all the Nation,\n\nNo worthy Friend, no poor Relation?\n\nSo ready to do Strangers good,\n\nForgetting his own Flesh and Blood? Now Grub-Street 18 Wits are all employ'd; [165]\n\nWith Elegies, the Town is cloy'd:\n\nSome Paragraph in ev'ry Paper,\n\nTo curse the Dean, or bless the Drapier. 19 The Doctors tender of their Fame, 20\n\nWisely on me lay all the Blame: [170]\n\n\"We must confess his Case was nice; 21\n\nBut he would never take Advice:\n\nHad he been rul'd, for ought appears,\n\nHe might have liv'd these Twenty Years:\n\nFor when we open'd him we found, [175]\n\nThat all his vital Parts were sound. From Dublin soon to London spread,\n\n'Tis told at Court, the Dean is dead. 22 Kind Lady Suffolk 23 in the Spleen, 24\n\nRuns laughing up to tell the Queen. [180]\n\nThe Queen, so Gracious, Mild, and Good,\n\nCries, Is he gone? 'Tis time he shou'd.\n\nHe's dead you say; why let him rot\n\nI'm glad the Medals were forgot. 25\n\nI promis'd them, I own; 26 but when? [185]\n\nI only was the Princess then;\n\nBut now as Consort of the King,\n\nYou know 'tis quite a different Thing. Now, Chartres 27 at Sir Robert's Levee, 28\n\nTells, with a Sneer, the Tidings heavy: [190]\n\n\"Why, is he dead without his Shoes? 29\n\n(Cries Bob 30 ) I'm Sorry for the News;\n\nOh, were the Wretch but living still,\n\nAnd in his Place my good Friend Will; 31\n\nOr, had a Mitre 32 on his Head [195]\n\nProvided Bolingbroke 33 were dead. Now Curl his Shop from Rubbish drains;\n\nThree genuine Tomes of Swift's Remains. 34\n\nAnd then to make them pass the glibber, 35\n\nRevis'd by Tibbalds, Moore, and Cibber. 36 [200]\n\nHe'll treat me as he does my Betters.\n\nPublish my Will, my Life, my Letters. 37\n\nRevive the Libels born to dye;\n\nWhich Pope must bear, as well as I. Here shift the Scene, to represent [205]\n\nHow those I love, my Death lament.\n\nPoor Pope will grieve a Month; and Gay\n\nA Week; and Arbuthnott a Day. St. John himself will scarce forbear,\n\nTo bite his Pen, and drop a Tear. [210]\n\nThe rest will give a Shrug and cry,\n\nI'm sorry; but we all must dye.\n\nIndifference clad in Wisdom's Guise,\n\nAll Fortitude of Mind supplies:\n\nFor how can stony Bowels 38 melt, [215]\n\nIn those who never Pity felt;\n\nWhen We are lash'd, They kiss the Rod;\n\nResigning to the Will of God. The Fools, my Juniors by a Year,\n\nAre tortur'd with Suspence and Fear. [220]\n\nWho wisely thought my Age a Screen,\n\nWhen Death approach'd, to stand between:\n\nThe Screen remov'd, their Hearts are trembling,\n\nThey mourn for me without dissembling. 39 My female Friends, whose tender Hearts [225]\n\nHave better learn'd to act their Parts.\n\nReceive the News in doleful Dumps,\n\n\"The Dean is dead, (and what is Trumps?)\n\nThen Lord have Mercy on his Soul.\n\n(Ladies I'll venture for the Vole 40 ). [230]\n\nSix Deans they say must bear the Pall.\n\n(I wish I knew what King to call.)\n\nMadam, your Husband will attend\n\nThe Funeral of so good a Friend.\n\nNo Madam, 'tis a shocking Sight, [235]\n\nAnd he's engag'd 41 To-morrow Night!\n\nMy Lady Club wou'd take it ill,\n\nIf he shou'd fail her at Quadrill. 42\n\nHe lov'd the Dean. (I lead a Heart.)\n\nBut dearest Friends, they say, must part. [240]\n\nHis Time was come, he ran his Race;\n\nWe hope he's in a better Place. Why do we grieve that Friends should dye?\n\nNo Loss more easy to supply.\n\nOne Year is past; a different Scene; [245]\n\nNo further mention of the Dean;\n\nWho now, alas, no more is mist,\n\nThan if he never did exist.\n\nWhere's now this Fav'rite of Apollo?\n\nDeparted; and his Works must follow: [250]\n\nMust undergo the common Fate;\n\nHis Kind of Wit is out of Date.\n\nSome Country Squire to Lintot 43 goes,\n\nEnquires for Swift in Verse and Prose:\n\nSays Lintot, \"I have heard the Name: [255]\n\n\"He dy'd a Year ago.\" The same.\n\nHe searcheth all his Shop in vain;\n\n\"Sir you may find them in Duck-lane: 44\n\nI sent them with a Load of Books,\n\nLast Monday to the Pastry-cooks. 45 [260]\n\nTo fancy they cou'd live a Year!\n\nI find you're but a Stranger here.\n\nThe Dean was famous in his Time;\n\nAnd had a Kind of Knack at Rhyme:\n\nHis way of Writing now is past; [265]\n\nThe Town hath got a better Taste:\n\nI keep no antiquated Stuff; 46\n\nBut, spick and span 47 I have enough.\n\nPray, do but give me leave to shew 'em;\n\nHere's Colley Cibber's Birth-day Poem. 48 [270]\n\nThis Ode you never yet have seen,\n\nBy Stephen Duck, 49 upon the Queen.\n\nThen, here's a Letter finely penn'd\n\nAgainst the Craftsman 50 and his Friend;\n\nIt clearly shews that all Reflection [275]\n\nOn Ministers, is disaffection.\n\nNext, here's Sir Robert's Vindication, 51\n\nAnd Mr. Henly's 52 last Oration:\n\n\"The Hawkers have not got 'em yet,\n\nYour Honour please to buy a Set? [280] Here's Wolston's Tracts, 53 the twelfth Edition;\n\n'Tis read by ev'ry Politician:\n\nThe Country Members, 54 when in Town,\n\nTo all their Boroughs send them down:\n\nYou never met a Thing so smart; [285]\n\nThe Courtiers have them all by Heart:\n\nThose Maids of Honour (who can read)\n\nAre taught to use them for their Creed.\n\nThe Rev'rend Author's good Intention,\n\nHath been rewarded with a Pension: [290]\n\nHe doth an Honour to his Gown,\n\nBy bravely running Priest-craft down:\n\nHe shews, as sure as God's in Gloc'ster,\n\nThat Jesus was a Grand Impostor:\n\nThat all his Miracles were Cheats, [295]\n\nPerform'd as Juglers do their Feats:\n\nThe Church had never such a Writer:\n\nA Shame, he hath not got a Mitre! 55 Suppose me dead; and then suppose\n\nA Club assembled at the Rose; 56 [300]\n\nWhere from Discourse of this and that,\n\nI grow the Subject of their Chat:\n\nAnd, while they toss my Name about,\n\nWith Favour some, and some without;\n\nOne quite indiff'rent in the Cause, [305]\n\nMy Character impartial draws: \"The Dean, if we believe Report,\n\nWas never ill receiv'd at Court:\n\nAs for his Works in Verse and Prose,\n\nI own 57 my self no Judge of those: [310]\n\nNor, can I tell what Criticks thought 'em;\n\nBut, this I know, all People bought 'em;\n\nAs with a moral View design'd\n\nTo cure the Vices of Mankind:\n\nHis Vein, ironically grave, [315]\n\nExpos'd the Fool, and lash'd the Knave:\n\nTo steal a Hint was never known,\n\nBut what he writ was all his own. \"He never thought an Honour done him,\n\nBecause a Duke was proud to own him: [320]\n\nWould rather slip aside, and chuse\n\nTo talk with Wits in dirty Shoes:\n\nDespis'd the Fools with Stars and Garters, 58\n\nSo often seen caressing Chartres: 59\n\nHe never courted Men in Station, [325]\n\nNor Persons had in Admiration; 60\n\nOf no Man's Greatness was afraid,\n\nBecause he sought for no Man's Aid.\n\nThough trusted long in great Affairs,\n\nHe gave himself no haughty Airs: [330]\n\nWithout regarding private Ends,\n\nSpent all his Credit for his Friends:\n\nAnd only chose the Wise and Good;\n\nNo Flatt'rers; no Allies in Blood;\n\nBut succour'd Virtue in Distress, [335]\n\nAnd seldom fail'd of good Success;\n\nAs Numbers in their Hearts must own,\n\nWho, but for him, had been unknown. \"With Princes kept a due Decorum,\n\nBut never stood in Awe before 'em: [340]\n\nHe follow'd David's Lesson just, 61\n\nIn Princes never put thy Trust. 62\n\nAnd, would you make him truly sower; 63\n\nProvoke him with a slave in Power:\n\nThe Irish Senate, if you nam'd, [345]\n\nWith what Impatience he declaim'd!\n\nFair LIBERTY was all his Cry;\n\nFor her he stood prepar'd to die;\n\nFor her he boldly stood alone;\n\nFor her he oft expos'd his own. [350]\n\nTwo Kingdoms, just as Faction led,\n\nHad set a Price upon his Head;\n\nBut, not a Traytor cou'd be found,\n\nTo sell him for Six Hundred Pound. 64 \"Had he but spar'd his Tongue and Pen, [355]\n\nHe might have rose like other Men:\n\nBut, Power was never in his Thought;\n\nAnd, Wealth he valu'd not a Groat: 65\n\nIngratitude he often found,\n\nAnd pity'd those who meant the Wound: [360]\n\nBut, kept the Tenor 66 of his Mind,\n\nTo merit well of human Kind:\n\nNor made a Sacrifice of those\n\nWho still 67 were true, to please his Foes.\n\nHe labour'd many a fruitless Hour [365]\n\nTo reconcile his Friends in Power;\n\nSaw Mischief by a Faction brewing,\n\nWhile they pursu'd each others Ruin.\n\nBut, finding vain was all his Care,\n\nHe left the Court in meer Despair. 68 [370] \"And, oh! how short are human Schemes!\n\nHere ended all our golden Dreams.\n\nWhat St. John's Skill in State Affairs,\n\nWhat Ormond's Valour, Oxford's Cares,\n\nTo save their sinking Country lent, [375]\n\nWas all destroy'd by one Event.\n\nToo soon that precious Life was ended, 69\n\nOn which alone, our Weal depended.\n\nWhen up a dangerous Faction starts,\n\nWith Wrath and Vengeance in their Hearts: 70 [380]\n\nBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound, 71\n\nTo ruin, slaughter, and confound;\n\nTo turn Religion to a Fable,\n\nAnd make the Government a Babel:\n\nPervert the Law, disgrace the Gown, [385]\n\nCorrupt the Senate, rob the Crown;\n\nTo sacrifice old England's Glory,\n\nAnd make her infamous in Story.\n\nWhen such a Tempest shook the Land,\n\nHow could unguarded Virtue stand? [390] \"With Horror, Grief, Despair the Dean\n\nBeheld the dire destructive Scene:\n\nHis Friends in Exile, or the Tower,\n\nHimself within the Frown of Power;\n\nPursu'd by base envenom'd Pens, 72 [395]\n\nFar to the Land of Slaves and Fens; 73\n\nA servile Race in Folly nurs'd,\n\nWho truckle 74 most, when treated worst. \"By Innocence and Resolution,\n\nHe bore continual Persecution; [400]\n\nWhile Numbers to Preferment rose;\n\nWhose Merits were, to be his Foes.\n\nWhen, ev'n his own familiar Friends\n\nIntent upon their private Ends;\n\nLike Renegadoes now he feels, [405]\n\nAgainst him lifting up their Heels. \"The Dean did by his Pen defeat\n\nAn infamous destructive Cheat. 75\n\nTaught Fools their Int'rest how to know;\n\nAnd gave them Arms to ward the Blow. [410]\n\nEnvy hath own'd it was his doing,\n\nTo save that helpless Land from Ruin,\n\nWhile they who at the Steerage stood,\n\nAnd reapt the Profit, sought his Blood. \"To save them from their evil Fate, [415]\n\nIn him was held a Crime of State.\n\nA wicked Monster on the Bench,\n\nWhose Fury Blood could never quench; 76\n\nAs vile and profligate a Villain,\n\nAs modern Scroggs, or old Tressilian; 77 [420]\n\nWho long all Justice had discarded,\n\nNor fear'd he GOD, nor Man regarded;\n\nVow'd on the Dean his Rage to vent,\n\nAnd make him of his Zeal repent;\n\nBut Heav'n his Innocence defends, [425]\n\nThe grateful People stand his Friends:\n\nNot Strains of Law, nor Judges Frown,\n\nNor Topicks brought to please the Crown,\n\nNor Witness hir'd, nor Jury pick'd,\n\nPrevail to bring him convict. [430] In Exile 78 with a steady Heart,\n\nHe spent his Life's declining Part;\n\nWhere, Folly, Pride, and Faction sway,\n\nRemote from St. John, Pope, and Gay. His Friendship there to few confin'd, [435]\n\nWere always of the midling Kind: 79\n\nNo Fools of Rank, a mungril Breed,\n\nWho fain would pass for Lords indeed:\n\nWhere Titles give no Right or Power,\n\nAnd Peerage is a wither'd Flower, 80 [440]\n\nHe would have held it a Disgrace,\n\nIf such a Wretch had known his Face.\n\nOn Rural Squires, that Kingdom's Bane,\n\nHe vented oft his Wrath in vain:\n\nBiennial Squires, 81 to Market brought; [445]\n\nWho sell their Souls and Votes for Naught;\n\nThe Nation stript go joyful back,\n\nTo rob the Church, their Tenants rack, 82\n\nGo Snacks 83 with Thieves and Rapparees, 84\n\nAnd, keep the Peace, to pick up Fees: [450]\n\nIn every Jobb to have a Share,\n\nA Jayl or Barrack 85 to repair;\n\nAnd turn the Tax for publick Roads\n\nCommodious to their own Abodes. \"Perhaps I may allow, the Dean [455]\n\nHad too much Satyr in his Vein;\n\nAnd seem'd determin'd not to starve it,\n\nBecause no Age could more deserve it.\n\nYet, Malice never was his Aim;\n\nHe lash'd the Vice but spar'd the Name. [460]\n\nNo Individual could resent,\n\nWhere Thousands equally were meant.\n\nHis Satyr points at no Defect,\n\nBut what all Mortals may correct;\n\nFor he abhorr'd that senseless Tribe, [465]\n\nWho call it Humour when they jibe:\n\nHe spar'd a Hump or crooked Nose,\n\nWhose Owners set not up for Beaux.\n\nTrue genuine Dulness mov'd his Pity,\n\nUnless it offer'd to be witty. [470]\n\nThose, who their Ignorance confess'd,\n\nHe ne'er offended with a Jest;\n\nBut laugh'd to hear an Idiot quote,\n\nA Verse from Horace, learn'd by Rote. \"He knew an hundred pleasant Stories, [475]\n\nWith all the Turns of Whigs and Tories:\n\nWas chearful to his dying Day,\n\nAnd Friends would let him have his Way. \"He gave the little Wealth he had,\n\nTo build a House for Fools and Mad: 86 [480]\n\nAnd shew'd by one satyric Touch,\n\nNo Nation wanted it so much:\n\nThat Kingdom 87 he hath left his Debtor,\n\nI wish it soon may have a Better."
