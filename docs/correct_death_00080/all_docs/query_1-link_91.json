Jonathan Swift was an Irish author, clergyman and satirist born in 1667 in Dublin, Ireland. He received his bachelor's degree from Trinity College before working as an assistant to an English statesman. His most famous work, Gulliver's Travels, was published anonymously in 1726 and became an immediate success. Throughout his life, Swift maintained a close relationship with Esther Johnson, whom he met as a child, though the nature of their relationship is ambiguous. He suffered a stroke in 1742 and died in 1745 in Dublin.",
