    "text": "Jonathan Swift was a famous author who combined humor and politics to create many prominent works. He was born in Dublin, Ireland on November 30, 1667. Swift was born prematurely and with Menieré’s Disease, a condition in the inner ear that causes nausea and hearing problems. Because his birth mother couldn’t provide for him, she gave him over to a relative named Godwin Swift. As a child, Jonathan Swift went to Kilkenny Grammar School, which was the best school in Ireland. During elementary and middle school, Jonathan was friends with William Congreve, a future poet and playwright. At the age of fourteen, Swift entered Trinity College in Dublin. Because he didn’t have financial support, he had to drop out after four years, but he still received a bachelor’s degree. After college, Swift moved to his mother’s home in Leicester, England, and it was there where he received his first job. He became Secretary to a retired diplomat, Sir William Temple, staying with him at his home in Moor Park. This was an important event for Swift where he gained some power as a politician. He only obtained this job because he had many family connections, and his relatives had good reputations. At his job at Moor Park, he met Esther “Stella” Johnson who was 8 years old at the time. They had a long-lasting friendship, and he became a tutor, mentor, and a great friend to her. Soon, Jonathan Swift sought a new occupation, and in 1694, he worked for an Anglican priest. After he worked with the church for about a year, Swift returned to Moor Park and had his old job back. When Sir William Temple grew old, Jonathan Swift was instructed to publish William’s work after his death. Soon, Sir William passed away, and he left Swift £100 and his unpublished books th...\n\n\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n\n\n...s. Gulliver is able to sail to Japan, and from there, he travels back to England. On his fourth and final journey, Gulliver becomes a victim of mutiny and lands in a mysterious land populated by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule the Yahoos, savage humanlike creatures. He becomes great friends with the Houyhnhnms, but when they realize that he physically resembles a Yahoo, they banish him from the island.\n\nJonathan Swift was an Irish satirist, essayist, poet, and cleric who turned political writing into something more riveting and humorous. Although his works were aimed towards the political audience, his writings impacted everyone in Europe in many ways. His combination of genres created a new theme that was admired by many groups of people. Though his work may not be remembered forever, he will remain a distinguished author in all of his reader’s hearts."
