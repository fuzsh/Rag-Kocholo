        "text": "Each year we celebrate one of Ireland’s greatest figures, Jonathan Swift. He is best known as the author of Gulliver’s Travels, which he wrote in 1726, however Swift was a man of many talents. He attended both Trinity College Dublin and Oxford University and for a short time in his younger years he served as a secretary to the diplomat Sir William Temple. Swift maintained a keen interest in politics throughout his life but in 1694 decided to make a career change. He trained to become a protestant clergyman and served in parishes in Carrickfergus, Co Antrim and later in Laracor near Trim. Swift hoped to eventually rise through the ranks of the church to a become a bishop or even archbishop. However, his outspoken nature had earned him enemies which stunted promotion.\n\nIn 1713 he was appointed Dean of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral. He would have preferred a post in England and was not initially welcomed by the people of Dublin either."
