    "text": "Swift was a prolific writer throughout his life. He often published his work anonymously, perhaps as it gave him scope to write and comment more freely. In his early career he published \"A Tale of a Tub\" and \"The Battle of the Books\". He was a founding member of the Scriblerus Club, whose members included some of the greatest writers of the age such as Alexander Pope, William Congreve, John Gay and John Arbuthnot. In 1720 he began work on his most famous work “Gulliver’s Travels”, which became one of the greatest novels in English literature. In 1729 Swift published \"A Modest Proposal\" which caused huge controversy. In the book he suggested that 1 year old children in poor families should be sold to the rich so that they could be eaten. James Joyce later described Jonathan Swift as the greatest satirist in the English language. Swift understood the power of satire, sarcasm and comedy which he used to make political and social commentary."
