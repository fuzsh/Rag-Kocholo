        "text": "Paragraphs 1-7\n\nThe essay begins by describing the all too familiar sight of women and children begging on the streets of Ireland. Swift notes that mothers are unable to work as they must spend their time begging in order to feed their children. He explains that the children will, in turn, grow up and turn to crime or leave the country to support themselves. Swift then writes that everyone can agree that anyone who thinks of a viable solution to this problem would be worthy of a national statue in their honor.\n\nSwift introduces his own proposal, claiming that it will be superior to others because it will not only alleviate parents of their burden of feeding children, but that the children themselves will \"contribute to the feeding, and partly to the clothing of many thousands.\" It also has the benefit of preventing women from ending their pregnancies or resorting to killing \"bastard\" children.\n\nNext, Swift launches into a detailed review of the number of impoverished women, childbirths, and infants remaining after possible miscarriage or infant death due to disease. He arrives at the number of 120,000 children that must be cared for. At this point, Swift has not yet revealed his plan.\n\nParagraphs 8-18\n\nIt is here that Swift makes his plan clear. Poor Irish babies could be sold as food. He assures the reader that an American friend told him that these young babies would be \"a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food.\" He moves on to tell us of different ways the children could be cooked. Swift again gives detailed numbers: 120,000 children with 20,000 being reserved for breeding. He tells the reader that a child well-nursed for a year may be 28 pounds. One child could be two meals when entertaining and last longer when a family dines alone. Swift suggests the skin may also be useful for gloves or boots and recommends that children be purchased alive. He then considers the sale and consumption of older children, but explains older children would not be as tasty. Swift also concedes that there remains many adults already in poverty and with disabilities, but they are \"rotting away\" from cold and malnourishment fairly quickly anyway.\n\nParagraphs 19-28\n\nIn these paragraphs, Swift outlines six specific advantages:\n\nIt would reduce the overall number of Catholics, who do the majority of breeding\n\nIt will give the poor a thing of value to sell for money so that they may pay rent\n\nThe profits will enrich the whole nation\n\nBreeders will collect money and be rid of the responsibility of caring for children after one year\n\nThe new dishes will be a great benefit to taverns\n\nand it will be great for Irish families because it encourages marriage, increases mothers' fondness for children and husbands' fondness for their wives.\n\nSwift concludes this section by suggesting other benefits such as trade and a reduction in eating pigs, as children would be more delicious.\n\nParagraphs 29-33\n\nAs Swift starts to conclude, he concedes people may object to his proposal because it will greatly reduce the number of people in the country. However, he states that this plan is uniquely suited for Ireland and no other place. He also dismisses other proposals that are not as sincere or helpful as his approach. Swift explains that his proposal is also unlikely to anger England, which is another benefit. Finally, he explains the proposal is given in sincerity without conflict because his children are too old for him to profit from the idea.\n\nSummary of 'A Modest Proposal'\n\n'A Modest Proposal,' written by Jonathan Swift in 1729, begins by deploring the sad fate of the poverty-stricken Irish who have to spend all their time trying to feed their large families. As a solution to the poverty in which these families are forced to live, by virtue of having so many mouths to feed, Swift suggests that these poor Irish families should fatten up their children and sell them to the rich English land owners.\n\nHe argues that children could be sold into a meat market as early as the age of one, giving poor families some much needed income, while sparing them the expenses of raising so many children. With 100,000 Irish children out of the population being set aside for dinner, his solution, he reasons, will also help to resolve the issues of overpopulation and unemployment in Ireland, giving the Irish economy a much needed boost, while making it easier for England to deal with its unruly Irish subjects.\n\nSwift then goes on to offer statistical support for his proposal and specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected eating patterns of their consumers. He even suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, reasoning that, with innovative cooks generating ever more and delicious new dishes, it will expand and improve the culinary experience of the wealthy, resulting in a healthier and happier population as a whole.\n\n'A Modest Proposal' ends with the argument that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on Irish family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways as yet unknown. His proposal, he argues, will, if implemented, do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political and economic problems than any other measure that has yet been proposed.\n\nAnalysis of 'A Modest Proposal'\n\n'A Modest Proposal' uses an approach called satire to make its point, which is the use of irony, humor or exaggeration to criticize the ideas of others. Swift obviously doesn't sincerely want the people of Ireland to sell their children as food, but he's using the outrageous concept to deliver a message.\n\nWith 'A Modest Proposal,' Swift makes fun of similar pamphlets that were being circulated at the time. His word choice throughout the piece, including the word 'modest' in the title, highlights this by mocking the false modesty in the tone of many of the pamphlets of his contemporaries. Their style may have seemed reasonable, but their proposals displayed an arrogance only too common among the British ruling class toward their Irish subjects.\n\nIn his proposal, Swift vents his growing aggravation at the incompetence of Ireland's politicians, the hypocrisy of the wealthy, the tyranny of the English and the squalor and degradation in which he saw so many Irish people living. But, while 'A Modest Proposal' bemoans the bleak situation of an Ireland almost totally subject to England's exploitation, it also expresses Swift's contempt for the Irish people's seeming inability to stand up for themselves. It is not only the English, but the Irish themselves, he declares, who are responsible for their nation's poverty-stricken state."
