    "text": "What strange being could have produced the most caustic, lucid, perplexing satires in the English language? Jonathan Swift has always both attracted and nettled biographers. Soon after his death in 1745, memoirists were jostling to unpuzzle the private life of this censor of his times. Modern biographers have followed their lead, trying to diagnose his misanthropy. All Swift's satires were written in some invented first person – the clever economist with A Modest Proposal to make the Irish eat their babies, the up‑to-date hack who narrates A Tale of a Tub, gullible Gulliver, tumbling from pride to self-disgust; all were published anonymously. Swift is not \"there\" in any of them. All the more reason for trying to find the author, whom none of us can quite detach from Gulliver in his final dark enlightenment, realising that he is but a Yahoo: sly, vicious and lecherous.\n\nLeo Damrosch, a Harvard academic and veteran of 18th-century scholarship, has returned to the often-sifted evidence, and is prepared to wrangle with previous biographers. In particular he is at odds with Irvin Ehrenpreis's vast, three-volume biography, which has loomed over Swiftians since its completion in 1983. Ehrenpreis is incontrovertible on the minutiae of ecclesiastical politics but, as Damrosch rightly says, curiously offhand in his assertions about Swift's private feelings and his sexuality. When it comes to the politics, Damrosch sounds like a translator of other scholars' findings, uncertain how to make the controversies to which Swift dedicated himself seem engaging to any general reader. When it comes to Swift's private affections and appetites, he is far more convincing and vivid.\n\nSwift came late to satire. Born in Ireland to an English family (he would always refer to \"the Irish\" as if he did not belong to them), he had few worldly prospects. He became secretary to a civilised retired diplomat, Sir William Temple, who furthered Swift's career hardly at all. He sought advancement in the Church, but spent many years as a vicar in rural Irish parishes, encircled by Catholics. When he did sniff success, it was as a political combatant rather than a satirist. In his early 40s he had five heady years in London under the patronage of the Lord Treasurer, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, the most powerful and subtle politician of the day. He wrote in support of his Tory ministry and consorted with the Tory wits. He became friends with Alexander Pope and John Gay, fellow members, with Queen Anne's witty physician John Arbuthnot, of the Scriblerus Club. The cleverest men in London, they wrote witty squibs and drank with the most powerful men in the land; they heard the chimes at midnight.\n\nSwift expected to get a bishopric for his efforts, but his friends fell from power when Anne died in 1714 and the best appointment on offer was Dean of St Patrick's in Dublin. It was a kind of exile. Damrosch believes his prospects were also fatally weakened by his earliest masterpiece, A Tale of a Tub, which had apparently appalled the Queen herself. Swift was a stern, devout man of the Church, but this dizzying satire treats Christian doctrine as the expression of human prejudice. Its irresponsibility, as Damrosch sees, is its brilliance. Irresponsibility was Swift's literary gift.\n\nWhen Swift returned to Dublin he took with him his \"friend\" Hester Johnson, whom he dubbed \"Stella\". Swift had first met her when he was Temple's secretary. She was the daughter of Temple's housekeeper. When Swift arrived he was 22 and she was nine. Yet she had some higher status in the household and the austere, brilliant young man served as her tutor. Damrosch believes that she was Temple's \"natural\" daughter – a possibility all the more beguiling because Ehrenpreis loftily dismissed it. The puzzle of her paternity becomes more significant when one considers the rumours that Swift, too, might have been Temple's child. Damrosch thinks it \"not impossible\", but can go no further.\n\nStella moved with a female companion to live close to (but not \"with\") Swift in Dublin. We still find it impossible to judge their relationship, though he addresses her in surviving letters and journals with a charged intimacy. \"Ah! You're a wheedling slut, you be so.\" Some have thought they were secretly married, many have supposed that she was his mistress, fewer and fewer have thought their relationship platonic. Damrosch displays the contradictory evidence but, beyond thinking Swift in love with her, cannot reach a decision. Our sense of their relationship is shaped by the fortuitous survival of some of his Journal to Stella, a bundle of dispatches he wrote to her when he was in London and she was in Dublin. Babbling in their infantile private language (\"ourrichar gangridge\"), punning and gossiping and muttering endearments, it has eternalised their relationship. Here Swift records the enlivening minutiae of daily life and the discomforts of being a permanently ailing man in an age before analgesics (\"Urge, urge, urge, dogs gnawing … The pain increased with mighty violence in my left shoulder and collarbone and that side my neck\"). Damrosch relishes the Journal, less embarrassed than previous Swift biographers by its puerilities, finding its \"gangridge\" \"almost Joycean\".\n\nYet even as he was cooing to Stella, Swift was engaged in a complicated flirtation (or was it an affair?) with an even younger woman, Esther Vanhomrigh, whom he dubbed Vanessa. An extraordinary autobiographical poem, \"Cadenus and Vanessa\", charts the early course of the relationship. Damrosch disagrees with previous biographers who have thought the affair unconsummated, but inevitably can only appeal to our knowledge of human nature in support of his conviction that this was eventually a sexual relationship. That and the fact that their continual references to brewing coffee seem to have acquired a secret meaning in their surviving correspondence. \"It is impossible to tell you how often I have wished you a cup of coffee,\" she told him. \"I wish I were to walk with you 50 times about your garden, and then – drink your coffee,\" he replied.\n\nDamrosch cannot solve the age-old mystery, but his account of this relationship is particularly convincing. It seems a sexual passion – but then we have some of Vanessa's letters, while Swift's surviving correspondence with Stella is one-sided. Vanessa came to live in Ireland, in a grand country house 10 miles west of Dublin, where she also had a townhouse. Swift would meet her and write to her, and seems to have been torn between her and Stella, who was evidently displeased by, perhaps distraught at, Swift's other passion. It has been easy to think Swift sexually twisted (he has been subject to much biographical psychoanalysis). The scatological poems written late in his life have often been taken as evidence of misogyny, but Damrosch emphasises Swift's many friendships with women and his sane, playful pleasure in female company – whatever the secrets of his sex life.\n\nSwift's final years saw his descent into dementia. Dr Johnson thought that this was the misanthrope's condign punishment: \"At last his anger was heightened into madness.\" A better judgment is TS Eliot's: \"Real irony is an expression of suffering, and the greatest ironist was the one who suffered the most – Swift.\" Damrosch has at least managed to let us glimpse the human roots of Swift's sometimes inhuman irony."
