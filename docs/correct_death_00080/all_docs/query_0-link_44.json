        "text": "Jonathan Swift was an Irish priest and satirist during the late 1600s and early 1700s. His works are known for their sharp wit and eloquently bitter political metaphors. He used his Anglican knowledge and political fierceness to wield his literary pen and effect positive change within the poorer demographics of Ireland within England, until being forced to flee England after a new government took power. Once in Ireland, he found great positivity in response to his work from the poor people living there.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJonathan Swift began life in Dublin, Ireland, in 1667 after his family fled England to find relief from the civil war. His family was of wealthy means, many having a strong literary career or distant relation to nobility. Swift attended school in Dublin and became an ordained priest in 1695. During his attendance at school, Ireland was going through an anti-catholic cultural movement called the Glorious Revolution in response to the injustices most felt the established Roman Catholic church not only got away with but enabled. The Glorious Revolution, and episodes of extreme dizziness, led him to flee Ireland multiple times to work for a distant maternal relative, the esteemed nobleman Sir William Temple, a man who introduced Swift to high nobility. Today, his episodes of extreme dizziness would be diagnosed as Ménière's disease, an inner ear imbalance.\n\nWhile working for Sir Temple, Swift began to write poetry, but he found his actual skill in prose satire. He wrote a response to his mentor, Temple, \"The Battle of the Books,\" along with other famous publications in 1705, to defend Temple and his conservative standpoint and further critique the situation of his day. During his time with Sir Temple, he formed a close relationship with a woman named Esther Johnson, whom he nicknamed Stella. In 1699 Sir William Temple passed away, and Swift returned to Ireland as the chaplain to Sir Berkley.\n\nSwift was a very rational Anglican; he believed that, on one side, the Roman Catholic church was indeed abusing its power and that, on the other side, the Nonconformist churches were also fanatic and untrustworthy. This left him quite disenchanted with both sides of a warring country, namely the Whigs and the Tories. \"The Sentiments of a Church-of-England Man,\" published in 1708, states this rather explicitly. Appointed to different stations in Ireland within the Church of England, Swift felt they were bitter disappointments. He dreaded leaving England and missed the power his position afforded him and the closeness to the action his writing could be.\n\nWhile working for Sir Temple, Swift was working and writing under the Whig party and their good graces. Although he became the chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, an esteemed Whig, after Temple passed, his good graces began to falter, and his promotions within the Whig party began to cease. This, and the Tory leaning to end the war with France, led him to become an editor in 1710 for the new Tory government and to write \"A Description of a City Shower.\" In 1714, the Scriblerus Club came to be. The club comprised Swift and other famous writers at that time that found friendship within Swift and his political commentary, such as John Gay. This same year, Queen Anne died, as did the Tory ascension to power and his dream of living in England.\n\nMature Years\n\nIn his mature years, Swift lived, almost in exile, in Ireland. For a decade, he halted his writing, but in 1718 he turned his scholarly attention to Irish political issues and found a great resonance within the Irish people and their plight. His works became more dark and misanthropic or disliking of humankind. However, the Irish people took in the staunch darkness and intense satiric sarcasm with joy- for someone was finally speaking in their interest, highlighting their issues. Around 1725, Ireland saw the publication of \"The Drapier Letters\" which criticized Britain for making a private deal and introducing what he considered an inferior quality of copper halfpence and farthings into Ireland.\n\nThis essay, along with many others, would be his primary writing career: writing about an establishment that neglects its people and benefits itself. He later writes \"A Modest Proposal\" and Gulliver's Travels his most famous works critiquing the slave trade, colonialization, abuse of power, and more staunch issues within English society. Sadly, after publishing Gulliver's Travels his close confidant, Esther Johnson/Stella, passed away, and this led Swift to mental and physical decline. Eventually, after a stroke in 1742, he was declared mentally unsound and passed from this decline in 1745.\n\nThe Rowdy Reverend: A Brief Biography of Jonathan Swift\n\nReverend Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), Irish priest and satirist\n\nAs if being born in 17th-century Ireland weren't hard enough, Swift never knew his father, an attorney who died two months before Jonathan's birth in Dublin on 30 November 1667. In their intense poverty, Swift's mother was unable to provide for them, so he was sent to live with his uncle Godwin Swift. Also an attorney and member of a prestigious legal organization, Godwin enrolled Jonathan in the Kilkenny Grammar School, one of the best schools in Ireland at the time.\n\nAfter his primary schooling, Swift entered Trinity College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1686. The Glorious Revolution of 1688, however, hindered his study for his master's degree, so he instead left for England. Here, he was employed as the secretary to the famous political essayist and statesman Sir William Temple. During the decade he worked for Temple, Jonathan engaged in researching and publishing his employer's memoirs and essays, some of which heralded what he saw as a necessary Anglo-Dutch alliance achieved during the Glorious Revolution. The highly charged political atmosphere surrounding Temple also led to Swift's own interest in the political arena, and he began to write his own short essays and began the manuscript for a later book.\n\nJonathan joined the Anglican priesthood during a visit to Ireland in 1695; however, that did not prevent him from maintaining a close relationship with Esther Johnson, whom he called 'Stella' and had met while working for Sir William. Following Temple's death in 1699, Swift returned home and took over a tiny congregation outside Dublin. Over the next decade, Jonathan spent his time preaching, gardening, and conducting home improvements. He also continued to write, and in 1701 Swift published his first political pamphlet: A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome.\n\nThree years later, Jonathan produced his first book, A Tale of a Tub, which was met with both popular acclaim and official condemnation. The reputation he built on this work secured Swift a job with the Tories back in England in 1710 as the editor of their official newspaper, the Examiner. Sensing that their regime would soon fall, however, Jonathan returned to Ireland for good in 1713, where he accepted the post of dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. During his tenure as dean, Swift continued to write and in 1726 finally finished the manuscript for Gulliver's Travels.\n\nUnfortunately, Jonathan hardly had time to celebrate his success, since his beloved Stella died shortly thereafter in January 1728. Many more of his closest friends began to pass not long after Stella's death, and Swift became increasingly reclusive and mentally disturbed. As his health deteriorated, he continued to turn away friends, but he was forced to rely on them when he reportedly had a stroke in 1742, losing his ability to speak. He was soon declared mentally unsound and would never recover from his maladies before his death on 19 October 1745. Though plagued with illness and disenfranchisement, Jonathan Swift proved to be not only one of the greatest authors of Ireland, but also one of the most distinguished writers of the English language whose works (like those below) have been a staple of English literature for centuries.\n\nSome Books by Jonathan Swift\n\n1704: A Tale of a Tub\n\nAlthough a big hit with the general public, Jonathan's first book was strongly condemned by the Church of England and even Queen Anne herself. They saw A Tale of a Tub as a parody of religion; however, Swift intended the work to satirize the overwhelming pride involved with the intricately intertwined worlds of Church and State at the time. With his parodic representations of the three main branches of Christianity, though, Jonathan realized that his work would adversely affect his advancement in the Anglican Church, even though it was originally published anonymously.\n\n1726: Gulliver's Travels\n\nPerhaps Swift's most popular and cherished work, Gulliver's Travels is thankfully known to us today by its shortened title. First published as Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts - By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain on Several Ships, Jonathan's timeless classic is a rollicking satire of many of the political situations that the author experienced in his own lifetime. For instance, the Lilliputian's plan to subjugate the island nation of Blefuscu clearly demonstrates the strained relationship between England (Lilliput) and Ireland (Blefuscu). Since its first printing in 1726 (which sold-out in one week), Gulliver's Travels has been immensely popular and not once ever out of print."
