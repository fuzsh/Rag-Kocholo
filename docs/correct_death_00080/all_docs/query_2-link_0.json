    "text": "Jonathan Swift Anglo-Irish author and clergyman Also known as: Isaac Bickerstaff\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop Questions Why is Jonathan Swift an important writer? Jonathan Swift was an Anglo-Irish author who is regarded as one of the foremost prose satirists in the history of English literature. He wrote essays, poetry, pamphlets, and a novel. He often published anonymously or under pseudonyms, including Isaac Bickerstaff, and is noted for his use of ironic invented personas. What was Jonathan Swift’s family like when he was growing up? Jonathan Swift’s father, Jonathan Swift the elder, was an Englishman who had settled in Ireland after the Stuart Restoration and become steward of the King’s Inns, Dublin. He married Abigail Erick in 1664 and died in 1667, leaving his wife, baby daughter, and unborn son—the younger Jonathan—to the care of his brothers. What is Jonathan Swift best known for? Jonathan Swift is best known for Gulliver’s Travels, which is a parody of a travel narrative. Published in 1726, it mocks English customs and the politics of the day. Swift is also well known for “A Modest Proposal,” a satiric essay published in 1729 that suggests living conditions in Ireland could be improved by butchering the children of poor Irish citizens and selling them as food to wealthy English landlords.\n\nJonathan Swift (born November 30, 1667, Dublin, Ireland—died October 19, 1745, Dublin) was an Anglo-Irish author, who was the foremost prose satirist in the English language. Besides the celebrated novel Gulliver’s Travels (1726), he wrote such shorter works as A Tale of a Tub (1704) and “A Modest Proposal” (1729).\n\nEarly life and education Swift’s father, Jonathan Swift the elder, was an Englishman who had settled in Ireland after the Stuart Restoration (1660) and become steward of the King’s Inns, Dublin. In 1664 he married Abigail Erick, who was the daughter of an English clergyman. In the spring of 1667 Jonathan the elder died suddenly, leaving his wife, baby daughter, and an unborn son to the care of his brothers. The younger Jonathan Swift thus grew up fatherless and dependent on the generosity of his uncles. His education was not neglected, however, and at the age of six he was sent to Kilkenny School, then the best in Ireland. In 1682 he entered Trinity College in Dublin, where he was granted his bachelor of arts degree in February 1686 speciali gratia (“by special favour”), his degree being a device often used when a student’s record failed, in some minor respect, to conform to the regulations. Swift continued in residence at Trinity College as a candidate for his master of arts degree until February 1689. But the Roman Catholic disorders that had begun to spread through Dublin after the Glorious Revolution (1688–89) in Protestant England caused Swift to seek security in England, and he soon became a member of the household of a distant relative of his mother named Sir William Temple, at Moor Park, Surrey. Swift was to remain at Moor Park intermittently until Temple’s death in 1699.\n\nYears at Moor Park Temple was engaged in writing his memoirs and preparing some of his essays for publication, and he had Swift act as a kind of secretary. During his residence at Moor Park, Swift twice returned to Ireland, and during the second of these visits, he took orders in the Anglican church, being ordained priest in January 1695. At the end of the same month he was appointed vicar of Kilroot, near Belfast. Swift came to intellectual maturity at Moor Park, with Temple’s rich library at his disposal. Here, too, he met Esther Johnson (the future Stella), the daughter of Temple’s widowed housekeeper. In 1692, through Temple’s good offices, Swift received the degree of M.A. at the University of Oxford. Britannica Quiz Famous Poets and Poetic Form Between 1691 and 1694 Swift wrote a number of poems, notably six odes. But his true genius did not find expression until he turned from verse to prose satire and composed, mostly at Moor Park between 1696 and 1699, A Tale of a Tub, one of his major works. Published anonymously in 1704, this work was made up of three associated pieces: the “Tale” itself, a satire against “the numerous and gross corruptions in religion and learning”; the mock-heroic “Battle of the Books”; and the “Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit,” which ridiculed the manner of worship and preaching of religious enthusiasts at that period. In the “Battle of the Books,” Swift supports the ancients in the longstanding dispute about the relative merits of ancient versus modern literature and culture. But “A Tale of a Tub” is the most impressive of the three compositions. This work is outstanding for its exuberance of satiric wit and energy and is marked by an incomparable command of stylistic effects, largely in the nature of parody. Swift saw the realm of culture and literature threatened by zealous pedantry, while religion—which for him meant rational Anglicanism—suffered attack from both Roman Catholicism and the Nonconformist (Dissenting) churches. In the “Tale” he proceeded to trace all these dangers to a single source: the irrationalities that, according to Swift, disturb humankind’s highest faculties—reason and common sense."
