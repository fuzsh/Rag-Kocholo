    "text": "This is just a taste of a mordantly witty much longer poem by the great satirist Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), for my money one of the brighter sparks to illuminate a fairly dull period in English verse. In it he contemplates his demise and looks back with some satisfaction on his combative life. It was written in 1731, so well before his sad last years much troubled by illness and dementia, and his final interment in St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin, next to his beloved ‘Stella’, the name he gave to his lifelong friend and possible lover Esther Johnson. His epitaph can still be seen there, with its famous words ‘ubi saeva indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit’ (where fierce indignation can no longer injure the heart).\n\n‘But not a traitor could be found’ – this refers to Swift’s involvement in undermining a plan by the English government to grant a monopoly to a certain William Wood to mint copper coins for use in Ireland. Swift was against this plan, fearing that it savoured of corruption and would lead to debasement of the coinage, and attacked it in a series of pseudonymous pamphlets, the ‘Drapier’s Letters’, in which he posed as a shopkeeper, a draper. In retaliation the government offered a sizeable reward to anyone exposing the true identity of the author, but Swift was a hero to the people of Ireland and there were no takers.\n\nFrom ‘Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift’\n\n\n\nHe never courted men in station,\n\nNor persons held in admiration;\n\nOf no man’s greatness was afraid,\n\nBecause he sought for no man’s aid.\n\nThough trusted long in great affairs\n\nHe gave himself no haughty airs:\n\nWithout regarding private ends,\n\nSpent all his credit for his friends;\n\nAnd only chose the wise and good;\n\nNo flatt’rers; no allies in blood:\n\nBut succour’d virtue in distress,\n\nAnd seldom fail’d of good success;\n\nAs numbers in their hearts must own,\n\nWho, but for him, had been unknown.\n\n‘With princes kept a due decorum,\n\nBut never stood in awe before ’em.\n\nHe follow’d David’s lesson just:\n\n‘In princes never put thy trust’;\n\nAnd, would you make him truly sour,\n\nProvoke him with a slave in pow’r.\n\nThe Irish senate if you nam’d,\n\nWith what impatience he declaim’d!\n\nFair Liberty was all his cry,\n\nFor her he stood prepar’d to die;\n\nFor her he boldly stood alone;\n\nFor her he oft expos’d his own.\n\nTwo kingdoms, just as faction led,\n\nHad set a price upon his head;\n\nBut not a traitor could be found\n\nTo sell him for six hundred pound.\n\n\n\nJonathan Swift\n\n\n\n"
