It is equally impressive inside with an array of carvings, statues, stained glass details, an organ, altars and a plethora of historical monuments and references. Prominent among these is the bust as well as grave of writer Jonathan Swift who was also a dean of the cathedral. Interestingly, his grave lies adjacent to that of Esther Johnson, known as Stella in his writings; Swift was her tutor and mentor but their relationship was ambiguous and never clearly established. Round the corner from the church, a series of municipal flats also bear reliefs depicting scenes from Swift’s iconic work Gulliver’s Travels.\n\nend of article\n\nNext story\n\nDolmens\n\nAlso Read"
