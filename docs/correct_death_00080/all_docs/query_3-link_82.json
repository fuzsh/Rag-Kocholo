Related Link First Chapter: 'Jonathan Swift' By ANGELINE GOREAU JONATHAN SWIFT\n\nA Portrait.\n\nBy Victoria Glendinning.\n\nIllustrated. 324 pp. New York:\n\nHenry Holt & Company. $35.\n\noltaire, who was Jonathan Swift's younger contemporary, may have come closest to understanding him. ''Whoever sets up for a commentator of smart sayings and repartees is himself a blockhead,'' he noted, predicting that the ''ingenious Dean Swift'' would never be understood in France, presumably because of his countrymen's well-known fondness for explication de texte. The ingenious dean, who was not known for suffering blockheads gladly, did not generally choose to explain his wit -- or, when he did, offered explanation in the form of parody. Swift ''rarely indicates with any reliability what he might consider 'the truth' on any issue,'' Victoria Glendinning observes in her new biography. ''If you insist on reading Swift in pursuit of 'real' propositions, you frequently sink deeper into the bog of paradox.'' The Swift who tap-danced so engagingly around meaning grew out of a remarkably long and complicated life, played out over nearly fourscore years and encompassing the politics of six royal reigns. The product of what he afterward termed a marriage ''on both sides very indiscreet,'' Swift was born in Dublin in 1667, some months after his father's death. He came of age with the political tumult that ushered in the reign of William and Mary. Like many other Protestants, he left Ireland for England, where he spent much of the next decade as secretary to the writer and former diplomat Sir William Temple. Ambitious to rise in the world, Swift hoped Sir William would obtain some ''preferment'' for him but in the end was forced to accept what he regarded as a humiliating defeat -- a position as a country vicar in Ireland. He was now, however, beginning to come into his own as a writer, with the composition of a satirical treatment of the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns, ''The Battle of the Books,'' as well as with the brilliantly articulated ''Tale of a Tub,'' an antic reductio ad absurdum of learned discourse, culminating in ''A Digression in Praise of Digression.'' It was here that he developed the satirical technique that was to inform his style -- impersonating his targets, layering irony upon irony. A second chance for preferment came in 1710, when Swift was sent to England to negotiate on the Irish Anglican bishops' behalf. He entered London life at full tilt, writing propaganda for the Tories and carrying on ''pun-ic'' wars with the London wits Steele, Addison, Pope and others. But Swift's fortunes faded with the triumph of the Whigs in 1714, and he slunk off to Ireland to serve as dean of St. Patrick's. Remaining there for the rest of his life, he thought of himself as an exile. ''I reckon no man is thoroughly miserable unless he be condemned to live in Ireland,'' he once wrote. The years in Ireland, from 1714 to his death in 1745, nevertheless saw the writing of Swift's best-known work, ''Gulliver's Travels,'' as well as his entry into Irish politics with the publication of ''The Drapiers' Letters'' and ''A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People From Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick.'' This last, in which Swift puts forward the suggestion that Ireland's difficulties could be considerably abated by the eating of babies, is his most famously ''monstrous'' proposition. Swift's long career as a satirist left him with a great many enemies, but, ironically, his posthumous reputation was to suffer most from friendly fire. The Earl of Orrery, who had been the dean's friend, set the tone by writing of Swift's ''intolerable'' misanthropy: ''The representation which he has given us of human nature must terrify, and even debase the mind of the reader who views it.'' Nineteenth-century readers continued to confuse the author with his writings, characterizing Swift, in the words of Thackeray, as ''filthy in word, filthy in thought, furious, raging, obscene.'' BOOK EXCERPT\n\n\"Perhaps it is just a modern fad to regard a man who steers clear of intimate relationships as inadequate or in some other way problematic. In which case, we should just accept as the simple truth Swift's throwaway remark that 'he never yet saw the woman for whose sake he would part with the middle of his bed.'\" -- from the first chapter of 'Jonathan Swift' Critics in our own century have attempted to disengage Swift from the bogy of misanthropy. Irvin Ehrenpreis's monumental ''definitive'' biography simply omitted many of the stories of dubious provenance that had accreted to Swiftiana. But Ehrenpreis's Swift may have come out of the laundry a little too starched and clean. Glendinning, freed from the necessity of telling all by Ehrenpreis's thoroughness (and perhaps freed as well from the necessity of extensive exegesis by David Nokes's more recent critical biography), proposes to give us a Swift distilled to the essentials. She focuses here on the most interesting questions in Swift's long and eventful life, cutting away any material that does not offer the kind of insight she is looking for. She succeeds admirably, as well, in her ambition to bring the tricky dean palpably to life, giving us approximations of the sound of his voice, his ''manner in company,'' even his handling of wigs -- adding, in passing, an interesting exposition of the general problems involved in keeping one's wig tidy. And in the guise of letting Swift describe himself, she gives us one of the most delicious stories of Swift lore: Responding to a rather puffed-up poet's characterization of Julius Caesar as a man ''of a lean make, pale complexion, extremely neat in his dress; and 5 feet 7 inches high'' (a perfect description of the poet's own appearance), Swift wickedly countered with a Julius Caesar fitting his own dimensions: ''I . . . should take him to have been a plump man, just 5 feet 5 inches high; not very neatly dressed, in a black gown with pudding-sleeves.'' Not surprisingly, Glendinning is particularly good at getting to the heart of Swift's notoriously inscrutable relations with the two women in his life, whom he called Stella and Vanessa. Lord Orrery more or less implied that they both died as a result of his cruelty, but the truth was a good deal more complicated. Swift had known Stella since she was 8 and he the newly arrived 22-year-old private secretary to Sir William Temple. Stella was the daughter of Temple's housekeeper, but as the pet of the family soon became Swift's pupil. After Temple's death, Swift urged Stella to come live near him in Ireland, accompanied by a female friend (who was always present, it appears, whenever the two met). For the next quarter-century, they created their own version of a mariage blanc: never living together, probably (Glendinning surmises) never having sex, but still linked in a close relationship resembling nothing so much as that between husband and wife. Their happy -- at least apparently happy -- connection was deeply challenged by the appearance on the scene of Vanessa, with whom Swift became involved during his sojourn in London. Like Stella, she was intelligent and witty, but she was unwilling to accept the terms of endearment Swift was prepared to offer. She followed him to Ireland and made increasingly urgent demands -- demands the dean alternately responded to and fled. Finally, a crisis erupted and she died not long after. Glendinning wisely and carefully excavates each of these relationships, dealing in turn with the rumors that Swift was secretly married to Stella, that Vanessa suspected it and provoked the final crisis, that Swift may have been impotent, that Stella and Swift may have both been the natural children of Sir William Temple and therefore prevented from marrying. She toys with the idea that ''the Yahoo in Vanessa was calling out to the Yahoo in him, and he responded in spite of himself before he left her on the further shore.'' But it also seems possible, she suggests, that we are making more out of Swift's reticence than we need to. ''Perhaps it is just a modern fad to regard a man who steers clear of intimate relationships as inadequate or in some other way problematic.'' She points out, further, that it was not at all uncommon for men and women of the era to remain single, citing statistics that nearly 20 percent of the aristocracy never married. Swift's highly reluctant progress toward Irish patriotism is dealt with carefully as well. The dean of St. Patrick's, who once characterized his native land as ''a wretched, dirty dog-hole and prison,'' ended by becoming its defender, rallying the first national protest in the famous Drapier Letters of 1724: ''Am I a freeman in England, and do I become a slave in six hours by crossing the Channel?'' But, in a sense, Ireland created Swift as much as he did Ireland, for it was the daily encounters with shoeless, starving women and children that defeated his early resolution never to involve himself in local politics. Glendinning is particularly good at articulating the ways in which Swift still haunts the city of his birth. ''Dublin is alive with her dead,'' she writes. ''The electric energy of Swift's manner still runs, if less fiercely, in the wit and savagery of Dublin's literary and political life -- in the insult disguised as a compliment, the compliment disguised as an insult, the outrageous joke delivered deadpan, the hyperbole, the telling anecdote, the irony that spancels the enemy.'' The author of five previous biographies, Glendinning has kept her footnotes to a minimum in the interests of bringing Swift to life as vividly as possible. In some circumstances, however, a few more scholarly caveats might have been in order. Some contemporary witnesses are cited without the customary grain of salt one might wish to have. For example, Glendinning makes substantial use of Laetitia Pilkington's memoirs, including the story of Swift's ordering Laetitia to eat gingerbread (which gave her heartburn) and drink rum for breakfast. When she refused, the dean forced the liquor down her throat. Glendinning does note that Pilkington is remembering events that happened a quarter-century before, but nevertheless claims that the ''pettiness and inconsequentiality of the scenes she describes lend them verisimilitude.'' This seems an odd argument to make in view of the fact that the editor of the memoirs, A. C. Elias, has called Pilkington's reliability into question. But these flaws are more than counterbalanced by the judicious weighing of evidence elsewhere. For the most part, Glendinning is careful to remind us of the liberties she is taking, and we would not have her do otherwise. The speculation she engages in serves to bring Swift closer to us without letting us lose sight of the historical context he belonged to. If her biography succeeds in getting at the truth about Swift, however, it is because Glendinning has the good sense to suggest rather than insist, to wonder rather than conclude, to leave the contradictions and paradoxes just as they are -- and fall in with the dean's godson, Thomas Sheridan the younger, who thought that ''perhaps there never was a man whose true character was so little known.''\n\nAngeline Goreau is the author of ''Reconstructing Aphra: A Social Biography of Aphra Behn.''
