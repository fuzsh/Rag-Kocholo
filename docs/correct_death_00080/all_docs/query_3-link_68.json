He promoted their causes in a weekly newspaper column and by writing a number of pamphlets, and was courted by numerous politicians due to the influence his writings gained him.[1]\n\nClerical Appointments\n\nAfter Temple's death, Swift obtained the position of private chaplain to Charles, 2nd earl of Berkeley and Lord Justice of Ireland, and accompanied him back to Ireland.[1] The following year (1700) he was appointed to the vicarage of Laracor and Rathbeggan, in the diocese of Meath, which included the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick's Cathedral.[7] In the spring of 1713, Jonathan Swift was named Dean of St Patrick's, much to his own dismay.[2][7] He had hoped to live permanently in England and had lobbied for both the deanery of Wells and the prebendary of the royal free chapel of Windsor, but these ambitions were thwarted by the queen, whose enmity he had earned by lampooning one of her ladies in waiting (the whig duchess of Somerset).[2]\n\nStella and Vanessa\n\n\"Stella\" was Swift's nickname for Esther Johnson, daughter of Edward Johnson and his wife Bridget (a waiting woman to Sir William Temple's sister, Lady Giffard).[5] Her father died when she was quite young, and Stella and her widowed mother lived in Temple's household. She was eight years old when Jonathan Swift (then aged twenty-two), acting as Temple's secretary, became her tutor.[5][8] Their relationship remained both very close and very private for the remainder of their lives.[5] At the age of seventeen when she was staying in town with Lady Giffard, Swift described her as \"one of the most beautiful, graceful, and agreeable young women in London, only a little too fat.\"[9] On his death, Temple bequeathed Stella a substantial independence and Swift helped oversee its investment, arranging for Stella and a female companion to move to Ireland \"where living was much cheaper\" and where it would be more convenient for him to visit.[5][10]\n\nIn 1703 the Rev. Wiliam Tisdale, younger, wealthier, and more established in the church hierarchy than Swift, asked Swift to present him to Stella's mother as a suitor for Stella's hand in marriage.[10] Swift's response was satirical and sharply critical, discouraging any such marriage, but then admitting that he too would choose Stella above all others if only his own financial position were stronger.[11] Stella spent the rest of her life in Ireland living with her companion, staying primarily in the deanery during the long periods of time that Swift spent in England and, whenever he returned to Ireland, renting rooms close by.[12] She and Swift maintained an intimate correspondence/friendship until her death in 1728, and he referred to her as \"the fairest Soul in the World.\"[13] There has been considerable debate over whether Swift and Stella were secretly married in 1716 [for more on this, see Research Notes below].\n\n\"Vanessa' was Swift's nickname for Esther Van Homrigh, the daughter of an influential Irish businessman, Bartholomew Van Homrigh, and his wife Esther Stone.[14] While Stella was tucked away at the deanery in Dublin, Swift was such a frequent visitor to the Van Homrigh residence in London that they set aside a room there for his use.[14] In his letters to Stella he described this room as nothing more than a \"closet,\" but in messages exchanged with Vanessa he referred to it as \"their private space\" which he called the \"...Sluttery, which [I have] so often found to be the most agreeable Chamber in the World.\"[15] Vanessa was seven years younger than Stella and completely infatuated with Swift, who enjoyed her company but was anxious to avoid any appearance of impropriety.[14] Independently wealthy, when Swift returned to Ireland she followed him there, taking up residence in a house not far from Dublin despite Swift's warning that he could not see her often because of the risk to both their reputations.[14] In 1723 Vanessa became aware there was another woman in Swift's life and demanded he choose between them. She wrote a letter to Stella asking if it was true that she and Swift were married and Swift, when he found out about this, was so furious that he ended the relationship with Vanessa. [16] She died shortly after this incident (likely from tuberculosis caught while nursing her sister) but not before writing Swift out of her Will.[14]\n\nWritings\n\nSeparate from Swift's political opinion pieces and pamphlets, all of his major satirical writings were published anonymously or under a pseudonym. He wrote prolifically and his published works include prose, essays and pamphlets, poetry, correspondence, and sermons/prayers. A few of his major works were:\n\nA Tale of a Tub' written for the Universal Improvement of Mankind. (1704)\n\n(1704) An Argument against abolishing Christianity. (1708)\n\n(1708) The Drapier's Letters. (1724)\n\n(1724) Gulliver's Travels by Lemuel Gulliver. (1726)\n\nby Lemuel Gulliver. (1726) A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on their Parents or Country... (1729)\n\nA complete bibliography of the works of Jonathan Swift can be found here.\n\nDeath\n\nJonathan's Swift's last years were marred by declining health and depression. He suffered a series of strokes which left him with an impaired memory, experienced weight loss and the inability to sleep at night, had excruciating pain in one of his eyes, and eventually suffered from aphasia and was unable to speak.[2][3] In May, 1742 a committee of guardians (composed mostly of fellow clerics) was appointed by the court of chancery to oversee his affairs.[1] He died on 19 October 1745 and was buried (by his own direction) in the south side of the middle aisle of St Patrick's, beside Stella.[1][3]\n\nSwift's parting gift was a bequest of £12,000 to establish and maintain St Patrick's Hospital for the Mentally Ill in Ireland, which officially opened one year after his death.[1]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nA number of Swift's biographers, including John Boyle,[17] Patrick Delany,[18] Deane Swift,[19] and Thomas Sheridan,[20] have endorsed what appears to have been a popularly circulated story that Swift and Stella were married in secret sometime after the end of July, 1716 and before 4 October 1716 by Swift's old tutor, St George Ashe, at either Clogher or Dublin.[2] This same story also suggested the marriage was never consummated because Stella was actually a natural daughter of her mother and Sir William Temple, and Swift a natural son of Sir John Temple (and therefore the natural half-brother of Sir William Temple), giving them a close degree of consanguinity. Neither of these theories is supported by any evidence whatsoever.\n\nWhat is known beyond any doubt is that: 1) no record of a marriage between Swift and Stella has ever been found; 2) they never lived together as man and wife; 3) Swift's physician, Dr John Lyon, and his housekeeper at the Deanery, Mrs Brent, both disbelieved any such marriage had ever taken place;[3] 4) Stella's lifelong companion, Rebecca Dingley, laughed at the very idea;[3]; and on 30 December 1727 Stella signed her own Will as \"Esther Johnson, Spinster.\" Accordingly, the profile of Esther Johnson which was originally attached to this profile as Jonathan's wife has been removed until any reliable sources can be found to substantiate their relationship.
