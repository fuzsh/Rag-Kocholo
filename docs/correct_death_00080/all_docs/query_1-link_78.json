        "text": "Biographical note\n\nJonathan Swift, the son of an English lawyer, Jonathan Swift (1640-67), and his wife Abigail, n√©e Erick (1640-1710), was born in Dublin in 1667. He was educated at Kilkenny College and in 1682 entered Trinity College, Dublin. After graduating, he moved to England and became secretary to the retired diplomat Sir William Temple (1628-1699). The daughter of Temple's housekeeper, Esther Johnson (1681-1728), was the addressee of his \"Stella\" poems. Swift pursued a career as a clergyman, he obtained an MA from Oxford and a DD from Trinity College, Dublin, and held various posts in Ireland throughout his life. Swift also began editing Temple's writings after his death in 1699 and edited several volumes of his works. His anonymous early prose works and political pamphlets brought him into contact with Addison, Steele, and Ambrose Philips. Some of his early poems were published in The Tatler. He made the acquaintance of the members of the Scriblerus Club before returning to Ireland as Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin, in 1714. Swift continued to visit London regularly to meet with Pope, Gay, Congreve, and others. This led to a joint publication with Pope of their Miscellanies (1727/8). Swift left England for the last time in 1727 and resumed his political and literary writing. After the death of \"Stella\" in 1728, and the loss of his good friends Gay and Arbuthnot in 1732 and 1735 respectively, Swift's mental health began to deteriorate. His poetic writing of this period has been regarded as voyeuristic and misanthropic. From 1741 his affairs were managed by guardians, and he was relieved of his duties in 1742. Swift died in 1745 and was buried in St. Patrick's."
