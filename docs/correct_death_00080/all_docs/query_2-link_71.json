        "text": "Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was a 17th-century Irish writer best known for his humorous writings. His satires and pamphlets made him a famous Dublin writer, still celebrated today in the Irish capital where he was born.\n\nJonathan Swift biography\n\nJonathan Swift was born in Dublin on November 30, 1667, and was taken in by his uncles following the death of his father. As soon as he was old enough, he entered the prestigious Trinity College, where he studied from 1681 to 1688. He discovered a passion for literature, and lived in a rather tense climate in Dublin, where Protestants and Catholics clashed.\n\nSince childhood, Swift has suffered from a then-unknown illness, with nausea, dizziness and tinnitus that would follow him all his life. Although handicapped by these symptoms, Swift manages to overcome all these drawbacks. Today’s medicine seems to think it’s Menière’s disease.\n\nOn completing his studies, Jonathan Swift left Ireland for England, in the county of Leicester. There he reunites with his mother, and takes a job as secretary to the politician Sir William Temple. He also became tutor to Esther Johnson, Temple’s illegitimate daughter, and fell in love with her for many years.\n\nThe money he earned from his work enabled him to finance his theological studies, which he completed in 1692. During this time, he joined Freemasonry, and continued to associate with Esther Johnson.\n\nAs soon as he finished his theological studies, Jonathan Swift officially became pastor in Kilroot. He didn’t stay there long, and joined Sir William Temple at Moor Park. Here he wrote “La Bataille des Livres” (The Battle of the Books), followed by “Le Conte du Tonneau” (The Tale of the Barrel), a satirical text attacking the stupidity and ignorance of society at the time. Queen Anne expressed her displeasure.\n\nBy 1701, Swift was once again inspired to write his first pamphlet: “A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome”. The following year, he returned to Ireland with Esther Johnson, and began writing for a number of local newspapers, including the Examiner.\n\nIn it, he sharply criticizes the government’s inability to govern peacefully, and to stop the war with France. While he was writing, he joined St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin, but failed to gain access to the archbishopric: Queen Anne refused to forgive him for his early writings.\n\nIn 1728, Jonathan Swift lost Esther Johnson, and engaged in a number of political writings whose arguments were of a rare virulence. Many of his readers both appreciate and fear his texts, so cynical and implacable are they.\n\nJonathan Swift died in Dublin on October 19, 1745 and was buried in his cathedral, alongside his wife Esther Johnson. His tombstone reads: “Here lies the body of Jonathan Swift, D.D., Dean of this Cathedral, whose heart will no longer be torn by fierce indignation. Go your way, traveler, and imitate if you can the man who defended liberty against all odds”.\n\nHis works\n\nPamphlets and satires, (1703-1735)\n\nThe Battle of the Books, (1704)\n\nThe Barrel Tale, (1704)\n\nMeditation on a broom, (1710)\n\nThe Draper’s Letters, (1724)\n\nCadenus and Vanessa, (1726)\n\nGulliver’s Travels, (1726)\n\nModest proposal, (1729)\n\nThe Polite Conversation, (1738)\n\nInstructions to servants, (1745)\n\nDiary to Stella, (1762-1766)\n\nHolyhead diary (1727)\n\nŒuvres, (ed. La Pléiade 1965)\n\nThe Art of Political Lying (1733)"
