    "text": "Description This collection contains 74 pieces related to Anglo-Irish writer, satirist and cleric Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), chiefly representing his later life in Ireland from the 1720s to the late 1730s. Documents include manuscripts in Swift's hand, or contemporary copies, as well as letters and verse to and from Swift and his friends, and documents endorsed by Swift or once in his possession.\n\nBackground Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer, satirist, and cleric known for his satirical works including Gulliver's Travels (1726) and A Modest Proposal (1729). Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, on November 30, 1667. He received a BA from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1686, an MA from Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1692, and a Doctorate of Divinity from Trinity College in 1702. Swift was ordained as a priest in the Established Church of Ireland in 1695. In the early 1700s, Swift was frequently in London, England, and was an active political writer and Tory propagandist. Following the fall of the Tory government, Swift returned to Ireland and became Dean of St. Patrick's Church in Dublin, serving from 1713 until his death. Swift died on October 19, 1745.\n\nExtent 74 items in 1 box and 1 volume\n\nRestrictions The Huntington Library does not require that researchers request permission to quote from or publish images of this material, nor does it charge fees for such activities.
