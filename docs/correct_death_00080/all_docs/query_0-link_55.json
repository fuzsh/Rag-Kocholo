        "text": "Jonathan Swift was born in Dublin in 1667. His father died before he was born, and he and his mother moved to England shortly after his birth. Swift returned to Ireland for his education. He received a Doctor of Divinity from Trinity College, Dublin in 1702.\n\nFollowing his education, Swift preached, wrote, and involved himself in Irish politics. However, he frequently visited London, where he kept company with influential writers and politicians. In 1710, he moved there for a job with England’s Tory government. He hoped the job would be a stepping stone to a bishopric at an English church.\n\nUnfortunately for Swift, Queen Anne did not like his writing, being particularly annoyed by A Tale of a Tub and The Windsor Prophecy. Her dislike of Swift was a reason why he never received a bishopric in England. Instead, Swift was sent back to Ireland in 1714 to be the Dean of Dublin’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral.\n\nAt first, Swift was disappointed. Ireland was viewed as a colonial backwater. However, the move ultimately worked to Swift’s advantage. Being slighted by English colonial rulers opened Swift’s eyes to the dark side of power and authority."
