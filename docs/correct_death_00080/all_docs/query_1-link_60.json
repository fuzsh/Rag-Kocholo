        "text": "- THE BATTLE OF THE BOOKS (1697), exploring the merits of the ancients and the moderns in literature.\n\n- A TALE OF A TUB (1704), a religious satire.\n\n- ARGUMENTS AGAINST ABOLISHING CHRISTIANITY (1708), also a religious satire, where the narrator argues for the preservation of the Christian religion as a social necessity.\n\n- DRAPIER'S LETTERS (1724), against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to provide the Irish with copper coinage.\n\n- GULLIVERÂ´S TRAVELS (1726) Defoe's novel about Robinson Crusoe had appearared in 1719 and in the same vein Swift makes Lemuel Gulliver, a surgeon and a sea captain, recount his adventures. In part one, Gulliver is wrecked on an island where human beings are six inches tall. The Lilliputians have wars, and conduct clearly laughable with their self-importance and vanities these human follies only reduced into a miniature scale. Gulliver's second voyage takes him to Brobdingnag. He meets giants who are practical but do not understand abstractions. In the third voyage contemporary scientist are held up for ridicule: science is shown to be futile unless it is applicable to human betterment. Gulliver travels to the flying island of Laputa and the\n\nnearby continent and capital of Lagado. There he meets pedants obsessed with their own special field and utterly ignorant of the rest of the life. He also meets Struldbrughs, who are immortal and, as a result, utterly miserable. In the fourth part Gulliver visits the land of Houyhnhnms, where horses are intelligent but human beings are not. The horses are served with degenerate creatures called Yahoos, demonstrating that human race would destroy itself without divine aid.\n\n- A MODEST PROPOSAL (1729), where the narrator with horrifying logic recommends, that Irish poverty can solved by the breeding up their infants as food for the rich. When Peter O'Toole read it -for some reason - in the reopening of the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin in 1984, several members from the audience departed."
