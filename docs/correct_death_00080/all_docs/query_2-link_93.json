B-10 1813 Fisher Rare Book Library (Toronto).\n\nDans l'adversité de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons quelque chose, qui ne nous déplaît pas.\n\n[\"In the hard times of our best friends we find something that doesn't displease us.\"]\n\n1 As Rochefoucauld his maxims drew\n\n2 From Nature, I believe 'em true:\n\n3 They argue no corrupted mind\n\n4 In him; the fault is in mankind.\n\n5 This maxim more than all the rest\n\n6 Is thought too base for human breast:\n\n7 \"In all distresses of our friends,\n\n8 We first consult our private ends;\n\n9 While Nature, kindly bent to ease us,\n\n10 Points out some circumstance to please us.\"\n\n11 If this perhaps your patience move,\n\n12 Let reason and experience prove.\n\n13 We all behold with envious eyes\n\n14 Our equal rais'd above our size.\n\n15 Who would not at a crowded show\n\n16 Stand high himself, keep others low?\n\n17 I love my friend as well as you\n\n18 But would not have him stop my view.\n\n19 Then let him have the higher post:\n\n20 I ask but for an inch at most.\n\n21 If in a battle you should find\n\n22 One, whom you love of all mankind,\n\n23 Had some heroic action done,\n\n24 A champion kill'd, or trophy won;\n\n25 Rather than thus be overtopt,\n\n26 Would you not wish his laurels cropt?\n\n27 Dear honest Ned is in the gout,\n\n28 Lies rack'd with pain, and you without:\n\n29 How patiently you hear him groan!\n\n30 How glad the case is not your own!\n\n31 What poet would not grieve to see\n\n32 His brethren write as well as he?\n\n33 But rather than they should excel,\n\n34 He'd wish his rivals all in hell.\n\n35 Her end when emulation misses,\n\n36 She turns to envy, stings and hisses:\n\n37 The strongest friendship yields to pride,\n\n38 Unless the odds be on our side.\n\n39 Vain human kind! fantastic race!\n\n40 Thy various follies who can trace?\n\n41 Self-love, ambition, envy, pride,\n\n42 Their empire in our hearts divide.\n\n43 Give others riches, power, and station,\n\n44 'Tis all on me a usurpation.\n\n45 I have no title to aspire;\n\n46 Yet, when you sink, I seem the higher.\n\n48 But with a sigh I wish it mine;\n\n49 When he can in one couplet fix\n\n50 More sense than I can do in six;\n\n51 It gives me such a jealous fit,\n\n52 I cry, \"Pox take him and his wit!\"\n\n53 Why must I be outdone by Gay\n\n54 In my own hum'rous biting way?\n\n56 Who dares to irony pretend,\n\n57 Which I was born to introduce,\n\n58 Refin'd it first, and show'd its use.\n\n60 That I had some repute for prose;\n\n61 And, till they drove me out of date,\n\n62 Could maul a minister of state.\n\n63 If they have mortify'd my pride,\n\n64 And made me throw my pen aside;\n\n65 If with such talents Heav'n has blest 'em,\n\n66 Have I not reason to detest 'em?\n\n67 To all my foes, dear Fortune, send\n\n68 Thy gifts; but never to my friend:\n\n69 I tamely can endure the first,\n\n70 But this with envy makes me burst.\n\n71 Thus much may serve by way of proem:\n\n72 Proceed we therefore to our poem.\n\n73 The time is not remote, when I\n\n74 Must by the course of nature die;\n\n75 When I foresee my special friends\n\n76 Will try to find their private ends:\n\n77 Tho' it is hardly understood\n\n78 Which way my death can do them good,\n\n79 Yet thus, methinks, I hear 'em speak:\n\n81 Poor gentleman, he droops apace!\n\n82 You plainly find it in his face.\n\n83 That old vertigo in his head\n\n84 Will never leave him till he's dead.\n\n85 Besides, his memory decays:\n\n86 He recollects not what he says;\n\n87 He cannot call his friends to mind:\n\n88 Forgets the place where last he din'd;\n\n89 Plies you with stories o'er and o'er;\n\n90 He told them fifty times before.\n\n91 How does he fancy we can sit\n\n92 To hear his out-of-fashion'd wit?\n\n93 But he takes up with younger folks,\n\n94 Who for his wine will bear his jokes.\n\n95 Faith, he must make his stories shorter,\n\n96 Or change his comrades once a quarter:\n\n97 In half the time he talks them round,\n\n98 There must another set be found.\n\n99 \"For poetry he's past his prime:\n\n100 He takes an hour to find a rhyme;\n\n101 His fire is out, his wit decay'd,\n\n102 His fancy sunk, his Muse a jade.\n\n103 I'd have him throw away his pen;--\n\n104 But there's no talking to some men!\"\n\n105 And then their tenderness appears,\n\n106 By adding largely to my years:\n\n107 \"He's older than he would be reckon'd\n\n108 And well remembers Charles the Second.\n\n109 \"He hardly drinks a pint of wine;\n\n110 And that, I doubt, is no good sign.\n\n111 His stomach too begins to fail:\n\n112 Last year we thought him strong and hale;\n\n113 But now he's quite another thing:\n\n114 I wish he may hold out till spring.\"\n\n115 Then hug themselves, and reason thus:\n\n116 \"It is not yet so bad with us.\"\n\n117 In such a case, they talk in tropes,\n\n118 And by their fears express their hopes:\n\n119 Some great misfortune to portend,\n\n120 No enemy can match a friend.\n\n121 With all the kindness they profess,\n\n122 The merit of a lucky guess\n\n123 (When daily \"How d'ye's\" come of course,\n\n124 And servants answer, \"Worse and worse!\")\n\n125 Would please 'em better, than to tell,\n\n126 That, \"God be prais'd, the Dean is well.\"\n\n127 Then he who prophecy'd the best\n\n129 \"You know I always fear'd the worst,\n\n130 And often told you so at first.\"\n\n131 He'd rather choose that I should die,\n\n132 Than his prediction prove a lie.\n\n133 Not one foretells I shall recover;\n\n134 But all agree to give me over.\n\n135 Yet, should some neighbour feel a pain\n\n136 Just in the parts where I complain,\n\n137 How many a message would he send?\n\n138 What hearty prayers that I should mend?\n\n139 Inquire what regimen I kept,\n\n140 What gave me ease, and how I slept?\n\n141 And more lament when I was dead,\n\n142 Than all the sniv'llers round my bed.\n\n143 My good companions, never fear;\n\n144 For though you may mistake a year,\n\n145 Though your prognostics run too fast,\n\n146 They must be verify'd at last.\n\n147 Behold the fatal day arrive!\n\n148 \"How is the Dean?\"--\"He's just alive.\"\n\n149 Now the departing prayer is read;\n\n150 \"He hardly breathes.\"--\"The Dean is dead.\"\n\n151 Before the passing-bell begun,\n\n152 The news thro' half the town has run.\n\n153 \"O, may we all for death prepare!\n\n154 What has he left? and who's his heir?\"--\n\n155 \"I know no more than what the news is;\n\n156 'Tis all bequeath'd to public uses.\"--\n\n157 \"To public use! a perfect whim!\n\n158 What had the public done for him?\n\n159 Mere envy, avarice, and pride:\n\n160 He gave it all--but first he died.\n\n161 And had the Dean, in all the nation,\n\n162 No worthy friend, no poor relation?\n\n163 So ready to do strangers good,\n\n164 Forgetting his own flesh and blood?\"\n\n166 With elegies the town is cloy'd:\n\n167 Some paragraph in ev'ry paper\n\n169 The doctors, tender of their fame,\n\n170 Wisely on me lay all the blame:\n\n171 \"We must confess his case was nice;\n\n172 But he would never take advice.\n\n173 Had he been rul'd, for aught appears,\n\n174 He might have liv'd these twenty years;\n\n175 For, when we open'd him, we found\n\n176 That all his vital parts were sound.\"\n\n178 'Tis told at Court, the Dean is dead.\n\n179 Kind Lady Suffolk in the spleen\n\n180 Runs laughing up to tell the Queen.\n\n181 The Queen, so gracious, mild, and good,\n\n182 Cries, \"Is he gone! 'tis time he should.\n\n183 He's dead, you say; why, let him rot:\n\n185 I promis'd them, I own; but when?\n\n186 I only was the Princess then;\n\n187 But now, as consort of a king,\n\n188 You know, 'tis quite a different thing.\"\n\n190 Tells with a sneer the tidings heavy:\n\n191 \"Why, is he dead without his shoes?\"\n\n193 O, were the wretch but living still,\n\n195 Or had a mitre on his head,\n\n198 Three genuine tomes of Swift's remains!\n\n199 And then, to make them pass the glibber,\n\n201 He'll treat me as he does my betters,\n\n203 Revive the libels born to die;\n\n204 Which Pope must bear, as well as I.\n\n205 Here shift the scene, to represent\n\n206 How those I love my death lament.\n\n207 Poor Pope will grieve a month, and Gay\n\n208 A week, and Arbuthnot a day.\n\n209 St. John himself will scarce forbear\n\n210 To bite his pen, and drop a tear.\n\n211 The rest will give a shrug, and cry,\n\n212 \"I'm sorry--but we all must die!\"\n\n213 Indifference, clad in Wisdom's guise,\n\n214 All fortitude of mind supplies:\n\n215 For how can stony bowels melt\n\n216 In those who never pity felt?\n\n218 Resigning to the will of God.\n\n219 The fools, my juniors by a year,\n\n220 Are tortur'd with suspense and fear;\n\n221 Who wisely thought my age a screen,\n\n222 When death approach'd, to stand between:\n\n223 The screen remov'd, their hearts are trembling;\n\n224 They mourn for me without dissembling.\n\n225 My female friends, whose tender hearts\n\n226 Have better learn'd to act their parts,\n\n227 Receive the news in doleful dumps:\n\n228 \"The Dean is dead: (and what is trumps?)\n\n229 Then, Lord have mercy on his soul!\n\n231 Six deans, they say, must bear the pall:\n\n232 (I wish I knew what king to call.)\n\n233 Madam, your husband will attend\n\n234 The funeral of so good a friend.\n\n235 No, madam, 'tis a shocking sight:\n\n236 And he's engag'd to-morrow night:\n\n237 My Lady Club would take it ill,\n\n238 If he should fail her at quadrille.\n\n239 He lov'd the Dean--(I lead a heart)\n\n240 But dearest friends, they say, must part.\n\n241 His time was come: he ran his race;\n\n242 We hope he's in a better place.\"\n\n243 Why do we grieve that friends should die?\n\n244 No loss more easy to supply.\n\n245 One year is past; a different scene!\n\n246 No further mention of the Dean;\n\n247 Who now, alas! no more is miss'd,\n\n248 Than if he never did exist.\n\n249 Where's now this fav'rite of Apollo!\n\n250 Departed:--and his works must follow;\n\n251 Must undergo the common fate;\n\n252 His kind of wit is out of date.\n\n254 Inquires for \"Swift in Verse and Prose.\"\n\n255 Says Lintot, \"I have heard the name;\n\n256 He died a year ago.\"--\"The same.\"\n\n257 He searcheth all his shop in vain.\n\n259 I sent them with a load of books,\n\n260 Last Monday to the pastry-cook's.\n\n261 To fancy they could live a year!\n\n262 I find you're but a stranger here.\n\n263 The Dean was famous in his time,\n\n264 And had a kind of knack at rhyme.\n\n265 His way of writing now is past;\n\n266 The town hath got a better taste;\n\n267 I keep no antiquated stuff,\n\n268 But spick and span I have enough.\n\n269 Pray do but give me leave to show 'em;\n\n271 This ode you never yet have seen,\n\n273 Then here's a letter finely penn'd\n\n275 It clearly shows that all reflection\n\n276 On ministers is disaffection.\n\n279 The hawkers have not got 'em yet:\n\n280 Your honour please to buy a set?\n\n282 'Tis read by every politician:\n\n283 The country members, when in town,\n\n284 To all their boroughs send them down;\n\n285 You never met a thing so smart;\n\n286 The courtiers have them all by heart:\n\n287 Those maids of honour who can read\n\n288 Are taught to use them for their creed.\n\n289 The rev'rend author's good intention\n\n290 Hath been rewarded with a pension.\n\n291 He doth an honour to his gown,\n\n292 By bravely running priestcraft down:\n\n294 That Jesus was a grand imposter;\n\n295 That all his miracles were cheats,\n\n296 Perform'd as jugglers do their feats:\n\n297 The church had never such a writer;\n\n298 A shame he hath not got a mitre!\"\n\n299 Suppose me dead; and then suppose\n\n301 Where, from discourse of this and that,\n\n302 I grow the subject of their chat.\n\n303 And while they toss my name about,\n\n304 With favour some, and some without,\n\n305 One, quite indiff'rent in the cause,\n\n306 My character impartial draws:\n\n307 \"The Dean, if we believe report,\n\n308 Was never ill receiv'd at Court.\n\n309 As for his works in verse and prose\n\n310 I own myself no judge of those;\n\n311 Nor can I tell what critics thought 'em:\n\n312 But this I know, all people bought 'em.\n\n313 As with a moral view design'd\n\n314 To cure the vices of mankind:\n\n315 His vein, ironically grave,\n\n316 Expos'd the fool, and lash'd the knave.\n\n317 To steal a hint was never known,\n\n318 But what he writ was all his own.\n\n319 \"He never thought an honour done him,\n\n320 Because a duke was proud to own him,\n\n321 Would rather slip aside and choose\n\n322 To talk with wits in dirty shoes;\n\n323 Despis'd the fools with stars and garters,\n\n325 He never courted men in station,\n\n326 Nor persons held in admiration;\n\n327 Of no man's greatness was afraid,\n\n328 Because he sought for no man's aid.\n\n329 Though trusted long in great affairs\n\n330 He gave himself no haughty airs:\n\n331 Without regarding private ends,\n\n332 Spent all his credit for his friends;\n\n333 And only chose the wise and good;\n\n334 No flatt'rers; no allies in blood:\n\n335 But succour'd virtue in distress,\n\n336 And seldom fail'd of good success;\n\n337 As numbers in their hearts must own,\n\n338 Who, but for him, had been unknown.\n\n339 \"With princes kept a due decorum,\n\n340 But never stood in awe before 'em.\n\n341 He follow'd David's lesson just:\n\n343 And, would you make him truly sour,\n\n344 Provoke him with a slave in pow'r.\n\n346 With what impatience he declaim'd!\n\n347 Fair Liberty was all his cry,\n\n348 For her he stood prepar'd to die;\n\n349 For her he boldly stood alone;\n\n350 For her he oft expos'd his own.\n\n352 Had set a price upon his head;\n\n353 But not a traitor could be found\n\n354 To sell him for six hundred pound.\n\n355 \"Had he but spar'd his tongue and pen\n\n356 He might have rose like other men:\n\n357 But pow'r was never in his thought,\n\n358 And wealth he valu'd not a groat:\n\n359 Ingratitude he often found,\n\n360 And pity'd those who meant the wound:\n\n361 But kept the tenor of his mind,\n\n362 To merit well of human kind:\n\n363 Nor made a sacrifice of those\n\n364 Who still were true, to please his foes.\n\n366 To reconcile his friends in pow'r;\n\n367 Saw mischief by a faction brewing,\n\n368 While they pursu'd each other's ruin.\n\n369 But, finding vain was all his care,\n\n370 He left the Court in mere despair.\n\n371 \"And, oh!
