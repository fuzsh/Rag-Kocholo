fantastic race!\n\n40Thy various follies who can trace?\n\n41Self-love, ambition, envy, pride,\n\n42Their empire in our hearts divide.\n\n43Give others riches, power, and station,\n\n44'Tis all on me a usurpation.\n\n45I have no title to aspire;\n\n46Yet, when you sink, I seem the higher.\n\n48But with a sigh I wish it mine;\n\n49When he can in one couplet fix\n\n50More sense than I can do in six;\n\n51It gives me such a jealous fit,\n\n52I cry, \"Pox take him and his wit!\"\n\n53 Why must I be outdone by Gay\n\n54In my own hum'rous biting way?\n\n56Who dares to irony pretend,\n\n57Which I was born to introduce,\n\n58Refin'd it first, and show'd its use.\n\n60That I had some repute for prose;\n\n61And, till they drove me out of date,\n\n62Could maul a minister of state.\n\n63If they have mortify'd my pride,\n\n64And made me throw my pen aside;\n\n65If with such talents Heav'n has blest 'em,\n\n66Have I not reason to detest 'em?\n\n67 To all my foes, dear Fortune, send\n\n68Thy gifts; but never to my friend:\n\n69I tamely can endure the first,\n\n70But this with envy makes me burst.\n\n71 Thus much may serve by way of proem:\n\n72Proceed we therefore to our poem.\n\n73 The time is not remote, when I\n\n74Must by the course of nature die;\n\n75When I foresee my special friends\n\n76Will try to find their private ends:\n\n77Tho' it is hardly understood\n\n78Which way my death can do them good,\n\n79Yet thus, methinks, I hear 'em speak:\n\n81Poor gentleman, he droops apace!\n\n82You plainly find it in his face.\n\n84Will never leave him till he's dead.\n\n85Besides, his memory decays:\n\n86He recollects not what he says;\n\n87He cannot call his friends to mind:\n\n88Forgets the place where last he din'd;\n\n89Plies you with stories o'er and o'er;\n\n90He told them fifty times before.\n\n91How does he fancy we can sit\n\n92To hear his out-of-fashion'd wit?\n\n93But he takes up with younger folks,\n\n94Who for his wine will bear his jokes.\n\n95Faith, he must make his stories shorter,\n\n96Or change his comrades once a quarter:\n\n97In half the time he talks them round,\n\n98There must another set be found.\n\n99 \"For poetry he's past his prime:\n\n100He takes an hour to find a rhyme;\n\n101His fire is out, his wit decay'd,\n\n102His fancy sunk, his Muse a jade.\n\n103I'd have him throw away his pen;--\n\n104But there's no talking to some men!\"\n\n105 And then their tenderness appears,\n\n106By adding largely to my years:\n\n107\"He's older than he would be reckon'd\n\n108And well remembers Charles the Second.\n\n109 \"He hardly drinks a pint of wine;\n\n110And that, I doubt, is no good sign.\n\n111His stomach too begins to fail:\n\n112Last year we thought him strong and hale;\n\n113But now he's quite another thing:\n\n114I wish he may hold out till spring.\"\n\n115 Then hug themselves, and reason thus:\n\n116\"It is not yet so bad with us.\"\n\n117 In such a case, they talk in tropes,\n\n118And by their fears express their hopes:\n\n119Some great misfortune to portend,\n\n120No enemy can match a friend.\n\n121With all the kindness they profess,\n\n122The merit of a lucky guess\n\n123(When daily \"How d'ye's\" come of course,\n\n124And servants answer, \"Worse and worse!\")\n\n125Would please 'em better, than to tell,\n\n126That, \"God be prais'd, the Dean is well.\"\n\n127Then he who prophecy'd the best\n\n129\"You know I always fear'd the worst,\n\n130And often told you so at first.\"\n\n131He'd rather choose that I should die,\n\n132Than his prediction prove a lie.\n\n133Not one foretells I shall recover;\n\n134But all agree to give me over.\n\n135 Yet, should some neighbour feel a pain\n\n136Just in the parts where I complain,\n\n137How many a message would he send?\n\n138What hearty prayers that I should mend?\n\n139Inquire what regimen I kept,\n\n140What gave me ease, and how I slept?\n\n141And more lament when I was dead,\n\n142Than all the sniv'llers round my bed.\n\n143 My good companions, never fear;\n\n144For though you may mistake a year,\n\n145Though your prognostics run too fast,\n\n146They must be verify'd at last.\n\n147 Behold the fatal day arrive!\n\n148\"How is the Dean?\"--\"He's just alive.\"\n\n149Now the departing prayer is read;\n\n150\"He hardly breathes.\"--\"The Dean is dead.\"\n\n151Before the passing-bell begun,\n\n152The news thro' half the town has run.\n\n153\"O, may we all for death prepare!\n\n154What has he left? and who's his heir?\"--\n\n155\"I know no more than what the news is;\n\n156'Tis all bequeath'd to public uses.\"--\n\n157\"To public use! a perfect whim!\n\n158What had the public done for him?\n\n159Mere envy, avarice, and pride:\n\n160He gave it all--but first he died.\n\n161And had the Dean, in all the nation,\n\n162No worthy friend, no poor relation?\n\n163So ready to do strangers good,\n\n164Forgetting his own flesh and blood?\"\n\n166With elegies the town is cloy'd:\n\n167Some paragraph in ev'ry paper\n\n169 The doctors, tender of their fame,\n\n170Wisely on me lay all the blame:\n\n171\"We must confess his case was nice;\n\n172But he would never take advice.\n\n173Had he been rul'd, for aught appears,\n\n174He might have liv'd these twenty years;\n\n175For, when we open'd him, we found\n\n176That all his vital parts were sound.\"\n\n178'Tis told at Court, the Dean is dead.\n\n180Runs laughing up to tell the Queen.\n\n181The Queen, so gracious, mild, and good,\n\n182Cries, \"Is he gone!
