        "text": "Chris Evert Edit Profile\n\nalso known as Christine Marie Evert, Chris Evert Lloyd\n\nTennis player athlete\n\nChris Evert is an outstanding retired American tennis player who dominated the sport in the mid- and late 1970s and remained a major competitor in the late 1980s. She was noted for her consistency, precision, poise, and grace and for popularizing the two-handed backhand stroke.\n\nBackground\n\nChris Evert was born on December 21, 1954, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States; the second child of Jimmy and Colette Evert. Jimmy Evert was a decent tennis player in his day, winning as a junior and in some single men's tournaments. He was employed as a teaching tennis professional and tennis park manager in Florida. Colette was a homemaker active in local charities.\n\nEducation\n\nEvert began playing tennis at the age of six at Holiday Park Tennis Center where her father was the teaching pro. Her two brothers and two sisters also played, though only her younger sister Jeanne became a ranked professional player.\n\nEvert was a good tennis player from an early age, and her father, who served as a coach for much of her career (late in her career she turned to Dennis Ralston), had her practicing every day from the time she was a young child. She primarily played on clay courts, a surface on which she would dominate as an adult.\n\nBy the time Evert was ten years old, she was winning local junior tournaments. Evert's style of play already had many of the trademarks of her adult game. She played from the baseline, focusing on groundstrokes that were carefully placed and strongly hit. Because she was such a small child (and only 5'5\" and 115 lbs as an adult) and did not have the strength to use a one-handed backhand, she developed her own two-handed backhand. Because of her success with the stroke, her father/coach did not change it. It became the trademark of her game. She later became a better volleyer than she was often given credit for, but she had to learn to like coming to the net.\n\nBecause Evert was not a very athletic person, she practiced hard, working especially to enhance her mental focus and great concentration so she could outwit her competition. This focus also gave her the ability to outlast her opponents.\n\nBy the time Evert was a teenager, she competed in a number of junior tournaments in singles as well as doubles and did well. At the age of fifteen, Evert defeated arguably the best female tennis player at the time, the number one ranked Margaret Smith Court (who had just completed the Grand Slam), during a ladies' clay-court tournament in North Carolina, the Carolinas, in the semifinals. Evert lost to Nancy Richey in the finals.\n\nWhen Evert was sixteen, she began playing on the women's tennis circuit as an amateur. Though tennis was her focus, she continued to attend high school at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, from which she later graduated. She had no social life outside of school and tennis. Before she played in the U.S. Open in 1971, she won forty-six straight singles titles. Her first victory came in the Virginia Slims Master's Tournament in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1972.\n\nIn 1971, when Evert was only sixteen, she played in her first Grand Slam, appearing in the United States Open.\n\nCareer\n\nIn December 1972, Evert turned professional; she won her first professional tournament in March 1973. Victories in the 1974 French and Italian championships and at Wimbledon highlighted a remarkable 56-match winning streak. She retained her Italian and French titles in 1975, and that year she also won the first of four consecutive United States Open titles (1975-1978), becoming the first woman since Helen Hull Jacobs to do so. In 1976, she won her second Wimbledon title. Despite having had occasional troubles on grass courts, she compiled one of the most spectacular records in tennis in clay-court competition; as of April 1978, she was undefeated on clay in 118 matches in 24 tournaments.\n\nIn 1980, Chris was the number one ranked player in the world, winning both the French and United States Opens. In 1981, she was again the number one player in the world and won Wimbledon. But there was a fall-off in the early part of the 1980s after this. She lost in the third round of Wimbledon in 1983, the first time she had lost before the semifinals in her thirty-four Grand Slam appearances as a professional. Though she had a stomach virus, her game was not as potent this time period as the players she faced were more athletic. At that time, Evert changed her training to work on the weak parts of her game (second services, attacking short-balls) and included weight work and aerobics. Her game soon improved. Even during this transition, however, Evert did win at least one Grand Slam, including three French Opens in 1983, 1985, and 1986.\n\nBy 1988, Evert was nearing the end of her playing career. That year, she also played for the United States Olympic tennis team, though she did not medal. Evert did not play well during her last two years on the women's tennis tour. She even skipped the French Open in 1989 because she was not playing up to her standards.\n\nEvert's last official tournament was the 1989 United States Open. She lost in the quarterfinals to Zina Garrison. Evert found it to be mentally tiring to play through early rounds, though physically, she was fitter than ever. By this point, she had wanted to retire for the two previous years, but could not.\n\nAfter the United States Open, she played for her country in the Federation Cup competition. The United States won the Cup, and Evert won all the singles matches she played. After this, the only tennis she played in were some exhibition matches with Navratilova.\n\nChris Evert retired from professional tennis in 1989 and became a television commentator, a special adviser to the United States National Tennis Team, and president of the Women's Tennis Association (1975-1976 and 1983-1991). With her family, she cofounded the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton. In 2015, Evert launched a line of tennis and active apparel in collaboration with Tail Activewear called Chrissie by Tail. She was also a member of the Athlete Advisory Committee for the 2019 Aurora Games.\n\nAchievements\n\nWorks\n\nbook\n\nChrissie: My Own Story\n\n(A top tennis player describes the personal and profession...)\n\nLloyd on Lloyd\n\n(Chris Evert and John Lloyd discuss the pressures of life ...)\n\nReligion\n\nEvert was raised in a staunchly Catholic family and wore a crucifix around her throat.\n\nViews\n\nChris Evert started Chris Evert Charities soon after her retirement from professional tennis in 1989. She established the charity to fight drug abuse and assist neglected and abused children in South Florida. It has raised more than $24 million, including $800,000 in 2017.\n\nQuotations: \"You've got to take the initiative and play your game. In a decisive set, confidence is the difference.\"\n\n\"If you can react the same way to winning and losing, that's a big accomplishment. That quality is important because it stays with you the rest of your life, and there's going to be a life after tennis that's a lot longer than your tennis life.\"\n\n\"Find something that you're really interested in doing in your life. Pursue it, set goals, and commit yourself to excellence. Do the best you can.\"\n\n\"Whatever your goal in life, be proud of every day that you are able to work in that direction.\"\n\n\"You can't give up! If you give up, you're like everybody else.\"\n\n\"Competitive toughness is an acquired skill and not an inherited gift.\"\n\n\"If you're a champion, you have to have it in your heart. You can have the greatest coaches in the world, all the opportunities to play, and the greatest equipment, but if you don't have it inside, you're not going to make it. On the other hand, if you don't have any of those luxuries but you have heart and courage and the guts to go out there and grind it out, then you'll make it.\"\n\n\"I realized that with hard work, the world was your oyster. You could do anything you wanted to do.\"\n\n\"Training the body to obey the mind as I have done differs from the more conventional method of getting the mind to obey the body.\"\n\n\"The difference is almost all mental. The top players just hate to lose. I think that's the difference. A champion hates to lose even more than she loves to win.\"\n\n\"There were times when deep down inside I wanted to win so badly I could actually will it to happen. I think most of my career has been based on desire.\"\n\n\"To be a tennis champion, you have to be inflexible. You have to be stubborn. You have to be arrogant. You have to be selfish and self-absorbed. Kind of tunnel vision almost.\"\n\n\"If I win several tournaments in a row, I get so confident I'm in a cloud. A loss gets me eager again.\"\n\n\"Single-mindedness. I hate to say it because I don't think it's the best thing for developing a person, but the single-mindedness - just concentrating in the one area - that's what it takes to be a champion.\"\n\n\"Don't let a first-set victory lead into a second-set slump.\"\n\n\"After being at the top, I don't think I could play senior tournaments, because you know how good you were. I don't know if I would enjoy that, being half of what I was.\"\n\n\"You pay a price for everything in life.\"\n\n\"Ninety percent of my game is mental. It's my concentration that has gotten me this far. I won't even call a friend on the day of a match. I'm scared of disrupting my concentration. I don't allow any competition with tennis.\"\n\n\"The great high of winning Wimbledon lasts for about a week. You go down in the record book, but you don't have anything tangible to hold on to. But having a baby - there isn't any comparison.\"\n\n\"Being famous before you've formed your personality, before you have that self-esteem, is dangerous.\"\n\nPersonality\n\nEvert was very insecure when she was young. She was shy and introverted.
