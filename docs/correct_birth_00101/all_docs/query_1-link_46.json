        "text": "One would expect a backyard tennis court if purchasing a house owned by Chris Evert. But throw in a backyard golf hole as well? Talk about a lifetime sport oasis.\n\nRELATED: Photos of the best backyard golf holes in the country\n\nSuch is the case with the tennis legend's Boca Raton home that has been put on the market. According to the Wall Street Journal, in addition to a tennis court (Again, a must for a Chris Evert house), the property also has a \"short par-3 golf course.\" Judging by this photo from Siemens Group Realty -- a co-lister with Douglas Elliman -- the phrase \"golf course\" seems like a bit of a stretch, but still, it's a sweet spread:\n\nIn addition to being able to play golf and tennis, the 5-acre spread in Horseshoe Acres has a pool, soccer field, a nine-car garage, and two guesthouses. There's also a horse barn that was converted into a gym and home theater. Unless you plan on training the next Kentucky Derby contender, we recommend keeping it that way. Here's a look at a few other photos of the six-bedroom main house from Siemens Group Realty, including one of Evert's office filled with career memorabilia:\n\nUnfortunately, those cool collectibles don't come with the $4.999 (how precise) price tag. But who needs mementos when you can say you own a tennis court that was played on by an 18-time major champ and a golf hole that was (probably) used by Greg Norman?\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Evert, 63, bought the house with another ex-husband, Andy Mill, in 2003 for $2.8 million. Apparently, the Olympic skier didn't insist on building a backyard ski slope. That probably would have thinned the pool of potential buyers.\n\nRELATED: A day at the backyard golf hole of a backyard golf hole builder"
