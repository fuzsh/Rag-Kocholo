        "text": "Update: In an article she wrote for ESPN.com, tennis great Chris Evert says doctors have told her she has no evidence of disease after being treated for stage 1C ovarian cancer. “I held my breath while I waited for my pathology results,” she wrote in the Jan. 17, 2023, article. “Luckily, the report came back clean and clear.” Evert’s sister, Jeanne, died of ovarian cancer in 2020. Chris Evert was diagnosed after a genetic test showed she shared the same BRCA1 gene variant as her sister. “My sister's journey saved my life,” she wrote, “and I hope by sharing mine, I just might save somebody else's.”\n\nTennis pros Chris and Jeanne Evert were as close as sisters can be. Growing up as part of a famous tennis family in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the sisters traveled the world competing in the sport’s most prestigious events. Chris ascended to the top of the tennis world in the 1980s, winning 157 titles and 18 grand slam events. Jeanne never matched her older sister’s achievements but was the No. 1-ranked junior at one point and retired playing to become a respected coach.\n\nJeanne Evert passed away from ovarian cancer in 2020 at the age of 62. And even with all the sisters achieved and shared together in the decades before, it was perhaps Jeanne’s death that permanently bound the two sisters together in a way Chris Evert could never imagine.\n\n“My sister’s death saved my life,” Chris Evert said in a recent interview in which she opened up about her own battle with cancer and how her sister’s genetic test led to her diagnosis. The Everts’ case also underscores the potential importance of genetic counseling and testing, especially when a relative is diagnosed with a cancer, such as breast or ovarian, that may be linked to inherited mutations.\n\n“There definitely are a lot of people in the United States who have an inherited risk for cancer, such as a BRCA gene mutation, and don’t know it,” says Eric Fowler, Licensed Certified Genetic Counselor at Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), Chicago. “They may not have any idea until they are diagnosed with cancer or cancer is diagnosed in a family member.”\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore:\n\nWhat is ovarian cancer?\n\nJeanne Evert’s cancer diagnosis\n\nGene variants of unknown significance\n\nChris Evert’s cancer diagnosis\n\nOvarian cancer treatment options\n\nBRCA mutations and cancer risk\n\nGenetic testing at CTCA\n\nIf you’ve been diagnosed with ovarian cancer or another gynecologic cancer and are interested in getting a second opinion on your diagnosis or treatment plan, call us or chat online with a member of our team.\n\nWhat is ovarian cancer?\n\nOvarian cancer is a disease of the ovaries, which produce eggs during a woman’s reproductive years as well as the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cancer is also an umbrella phrase for cancers of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and peritoneum.\n\nOvarian cancer is not very common, especially relative to other cancers: It’s the 18th most common cancer diagnosed in the United States, accounting for fewer than one-10th of new female breast cancer cases and one-third of uterine cancer diagnoses.\n\nThe exact cause of a specific case of ovarian cancer may never be known, but several factors increase the risk of the disease, especially family history. Women who have an inherited breast cancer gene mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2) or who have an inherited genetic disorder, such as Lynch syndrome, are at higher risk.\n\nIn fact, it was the discovery of a BRCA mutation that led to Chris Evert’s diagnosis."
