        "text": "Tennis Hall of Famer Chris Evert says she was diagnosed with an early stage of ovarian cancer.\n\nThe 67-year-old Evert, who grew up in Fort Lauderdale and has spent most of her adult years living in Palm Beach County, revealed the illness in a story posted Friday on ESPN.com; she is an on-air announcer for ESPN.\n\nShe learned of the cancer last month and began chemotherapy treatments this week.\n\n“I’ve lived a very charmed life. Now I have some challenges ahead of me,” Evert said. “But I have comfort in knowing the chemotherapy is to ensure that cancer does not come back.”\n\nEvert won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, reached No. 1 in the WTA rankings and was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nHer sister, Jeanne Evert Dubin, died from ovarian cancer in February 2020 at age 62.\n\n“Be your own advocate. Know your family’s history. Have total awareness of your body, follow your gut and be aware of changes,” Evert said in the ESPN story. “Don’t try to be a crusader and think this will pass.”\n\nEvert, who was born in 1954 in Fort Lauderdale, attended Central Catholic High School, which became St. Thomas Aquinas High School. She recently sold a large property west of Boca Raton that she had owned since 2003. Evert owns the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca, and she has lived in south Palm Beach County for more than 30 years."
