        "text": "Tennis legend Chris Evert is a winner—an 18-time Grand Slam champion. She also knows how to lose with grace. Playing in the same era as Martina Navratilova, Billy Jean King, Margaret Court, Yvonne Goolagong-Cawley and Steffi Graf—you’re going to lose your share of tough matches. But this time, the sense of loss is personal.\n\nBy choice, the tennis legend is parting ways with her Boca Raton, Florida home, the beloved sanctuary where she raised her three tennis-playing sons. Evert is moving on, listing her 5-acre estate for nearly $5 million—cashing in precious memories for the next chapter of her life.\n\nIt’s not everyday that a house comes to market with a championship pedigree. The eight bedroom, seven-and-a-half bathroom property on Horseshoe Lane spans five tropical acres with a six-bedroom main house, two guest houses, putting greens, a nine-car garage, and a well-heeled tennis court touched by greatness. The gated 12,000-square-foot estate includes a maid quarters, library, office, home theater, formal living room, dining room with butler’s pantry, and high-end appliance gourmet kitchen.\n\nThe home features custom woodwork, hardwood and tile flooring, fireplace, and wet bar. But the relaxing outdoors is what distinguishes the estate, highlighted by an expansive wrap-around veranda, a resort-style pool, outdoor kitchen, par-3 golf hole, a barn and horse trail. The property is co-listed by Katia Reisler of Douglas Elliman and Rebecca Spooner of Siemens Group Realty.\n\nThe International Tennis Hall of Famer, who purchased the home in 2003, says the private estate is secluded and an ideal match for an active family.\n\n“What made it special for me is the love we shared in this home throughout the upbringing of my three children,” says Evert. “The backyard is big enough to play soccer or a game of football—so we added a soccer field, par-3 golf green, tennis court, gym, and movie theater. The kids were always entertained and active. I taught my sons how to play tennis on that court.”\n\nTeaching tennis is a tradition in the Evert family. Her father “Jimmy” Evert, a former champion himself, taught Chris (beginning at age 5) and four siblings the game as director of tennis at what’s now the Jimmy Evert Tennis Center at Holiday Park in Fort Lauderdale (a title he held for 49 years).\n\nHis daughter “Chrissie” would become an international tennis phenom, and eventually, the No. 1-ranked singles player in the world from 1974-1978, and 1980-1981. Evert won 90 percent of her professional matches (a 1,209-146 record) and reached the finals in 76 percent of her tournaments (a feat unequaled by woman or man). At one time, her epic matches verses Martina Navratilova were dubbed “sports greatest rivalry.”\n\nHer former professional foes are now friends who participate in Evert’s tennis academy or socially visit her house to shoot the Florida breeze. While Navratilova, Pam Shriver, and current superstar Serena Williams have visited Evert at Horseshoe Lane, they relive the good ol’ days via reminiscing, not rackets. Intense matches on this tennis court was a family affair. Now, her sons are grown men.\n\n“My kids all played on the high school tennis team so there would be regular practice and some competitive matches between me and the boys on that court,” she says.\n\nIn those matches, the smart bet would be on “Chrissie”, who won 57 career singles titles in her illustrious professional career, including a record seven French Opens, six U.S. Opens, three Wimbledons, and two Australian Opens. Once, when her diamond bracelet fell onto the court during a match, she coined the term “tennis bracelet,” a moniker that still exists today.\n\nToday, she keeps the game as close as a three-set tiebreaker—as an ESPN announcer of Grand Slam tournaments, publisher of Tennis Magazine, and chairing the Evert Tennis Academy (with her brother John), which promotes excellence, resilience, integrity and leadership among student athletes.\n\n“Tennis is still a big part of my life and it is still fun for me,” she says. “I run my Evert Tennis Academy which is seven minutes away from the home.”\n\nEvert is still winning—at love…with tennis, family and life."
