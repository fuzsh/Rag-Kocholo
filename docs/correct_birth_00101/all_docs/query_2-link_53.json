        "text": "ESPN tennis analyst Chris Evert announced she is stepping away from her work at the network due to a recurrence of ovarian cancer. She first was diagnosed with cancer in December 2021.\n\n“While this is a diagnosis I never wanted to hear, I once again feel fortunate that it was caught early,” Evert said in a statement through ESPN. “Based on a PET CT scan, I underwent another robotic surgery this past week. Doctors found cancer cells in the same pelvic region. All cells were removed, and I have begun another round of chemotherapy.”\n\nEvert was a star tennis player in the 1970s and ’80s, winning 18 grand slams, a total which ranks fifth in women’s tennis history. She joined ESPN’s tennis coverage in 2011 and has been a staple on the network’s Grand Slam broadcasts for over a decade.\n\nThe 68-year-old said she will miss the Australian Open in January as she undergoes treatment, but she hopes to return to ESPN’s Grand Slam coverage later in the year. She also hopes her diagnosis helps raise awareness for early cancer detection.\n\n“I encourage everyone to know your family history and advocate for yourself,” she said. “Early detection saves lives.”"
