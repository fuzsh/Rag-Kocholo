        "text": "Synopsis\n\nTennis legend Chris Evert faces a renewed battle with ovarian cancer, sidelining her from the 2024 Australian Open broadcast. Despite this setback, the 18-time Grand Slam winner vows to tackle chemotherapy head-on, determined to continue her legacy in the upcoming Grand Slam season.\n\nChris Evert, the tennis icon turned commentator, will be absent from the 2024 Australian Open broadcast as her ovarian cancer has reappeared. This marks the latest development in her two-year-long struggle since the initial diagnosis, with Evert confirming her inability to travel to Australia for the tournament in a released statement.\n\nEvert shared that a PET scan detected cancer cells in her pelvic region, leading her to undergo robotic surgery this week. Subsequently, she is scheduled for chemotherapy. Despite missing the upcoming Australian Open broadcast, the 18-time Grand Slam winner assured she'll be prepared for the rest of the Grand Slam season.\n\nEvert, celebrating her 69th birthday on December 21, received a Stage 1 ovarian cancer diagnosis in December 2021, as revealed in her January 2022 statement.\n\nJeanne, Evert's sister and a former professional tennis player, succumbed to ovarian cancer in February 2020 at the age of 62. Evert, the older sibling, retired from a nearly two-decade-long playing career in 1989 and was honored with induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nEvert achieved the top spot in global rankings and secured 18 major singles titles during her career.\n\nEvert achieved a historic milestone by becoming the inaugural player, regardless of gender, to secure 1,000 singles victories. She amassed the second-highest career match wins, totaling 1,309, trailing only Martina Navratilova with 1,442 victories. Additionally, Evert's remarkable career includes 18 major Championships, placing her tied for the fifth-best in women's history. Notably, she claimed at least one major singles title for an unprecedented 13 consecutive years.\n\nEvert also holds the record for the second-most singles titles in history, having 157 wins, surpassed only by Navratilova's 167, and notably being the first to exceed the 150-plus mark.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 18,500 cases of ovarian cancer in women, with more than 13,400 fatalities. The Mayo Clinic notes that the likelihood of ovarian cancer rises with age, and a family history also elevates the risk.\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ1: When was Chris Evert born?\n\nA1: December 21, 1954.\n\nQ2: How many Grand Slam singles has Chris Evert won?\n\nA2: 18.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
