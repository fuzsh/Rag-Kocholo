        "text": "Tennis great Chris Evert just got herself a classy new house in Boca Raton.\n\nOn Tuesday, the seven-time French Open winner Evert closed on a $4.9 million three-bedroom, 4-bathroom pad at 674 Tern Point Circle in the yachting community of The Sanctuary.\n\nThe 6,500-square foot Regency-inspired deep-water estate is a study in pure Florida understated luxury, white, on beige on white.\n\nThe home boasts 94 feet of south facing waterfront and, according to a MLS description of the home, “rows of blueberry trees line the double-door entry to the seamless living spaces with finishes of French washed oak, honed French Vanilla marble and matte Venetian plaster, all in a palette of soft muted tones.\n\n“Walls of retractable glass doors line the open great room and morning room, joining these spaces to the outdoor lounge areas featuring a canvas covered pergola by the artfully designed pool.\n\n“Also opening to the pool terrace, the private master suite features an exquisite bath that combines with an open dressing room to create a voluminous salon-like retreat.”\n\nEvert hasn’t given up her old house at 8563 Horseshoe Lane in the Polo Club of Boca Raton yet, though she’s put it on the market last month for $6 million.\n\nThe 61-year-old bought that place back in 2003 for $2.8 million. She got to keep it as part of a settlement with ex-husband Andy Mill when she divorced him in 2006 so that she could marry golf legend Greg Norman. Evert divorced Norman in 2009 and is officially single."
