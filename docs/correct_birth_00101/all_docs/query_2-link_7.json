        "text": "Chris “Chrissie” Evert won the first of her 18 Grand Slam titles in 1974 on the way to becoming one of the most decorated female athletes in history. With a game born on the courts of Fort Lauderdale’s Holiday Park and honed by her father, the late Jimmy Evert, she would go on to win at least one Grand Slam title over the next 13 years, piling up 157 Tour titles.\n\nIn any tennis discussion, Chris Evert is one of the greatest players of all time. She won 90 percent of her matches (1,209-146), a feat that has never been equaled by any player—male or female. Evert reached the finals in 76 percent of the tournaments in which she played and the semifinals or better in 52 of her 56 Grand Slam singles appearances. She advanced to the semifinals or better in her first 34 Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nIn 1976, Sports Illustrated named her “Sportswoman of the Year” and in 1999, she was named by ESPN as one of the “Top 50 North American Athletes of the Century.\n\nIn 1995, Chris received tennis’ highest honor as the sole inductee into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, becoming only the fourth player in tennis history to be unanimously selected.\n\nChris co-owns the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton publishes Tennis Magazine and serves as a tennis analyst for ESPN’s Grand Slam coverage."
