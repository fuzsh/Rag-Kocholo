        "text": "(born 1954). Unflappable, and nearly flawless on a clay court, Chris Evert had a mental toughness that brought new intensity to women’s tennis. When 15-year-old Chrissie (her nickname then) beat the 28-year-old reigning champion, she set the style for dozens of teenaged phenoms to follow.\n\nChristine Marie Evert was born in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Dec. 21, 1954. Her father, a tennis instructor, began to teach her the game when she was about 6 years old, and from the age of 10 she was always the champion in her amateur age group.\n\nShe entered the limelight in 1970 when she beat the top-ranked player, Margaret Court, in a minor event. In 1971, at the age of 16, she became the youngest player to reach the semifinals of the United States Open. By 1972, before she turned professional, she had already been forced to turn down more than 50,000 dollars in prize money. In 1976 she became the first million-dollar woman player.\n\nEvert was the first woman since Alice Marble in the 1930s to be ranked number 1 for five consecutive years (1974–78). She again held the top ranking in 1980 and 1981. She won 157 singles titles (18 of them in Grand Slam events), setting a record for both men and women professionals. Her 1986 French Open win marked the 13th consecutive year in which she won at least one Grand Slam singles title. She won the United States Open six times (1975–78, 1980, and 1982) and Wimbledon three times (1974, 1976, and 1981).\n\nBetween 1973 and 1979 Evert won a record 125 consecutive clay-court matches. Her accomplishments included winning the women’s singles title in the United States Clay Court Championships from 1972 through 1975 and in 1979 and 1980. She won the French Open on clay in 1974, 1975, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1985, and 1986—the only seven-time winner.\n\nEvert was engaged to Jimmy Connors in the mid-1970s, when both were ranked at the top of the game. From 1979 to 1987 she was married to the English tennis professional John Lloyd. She married Andy Mill, an American skier and television commentator, in 1988. In late 1989, after she had retired from circuit play, she won five matches to bring another Federation Cup to the United States."
