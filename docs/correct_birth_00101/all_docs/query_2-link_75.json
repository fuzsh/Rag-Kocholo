All cells were removed, and I have begun another round of chemotherapy.\"\n\nEvert, 68, won 18 Grand Slam tournaments, was a former No. 1 in the WTA rankings and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nShe has been an analyst for ESPN since 2011 but will be unable to be on the call at the Australian Open in January.\n\n\"I will be unable to join my colleagues when ESPN makes its return to Melbourne for the Australian Open next month,\" Evert’s statement continued. \"But I’ll be ready for the rest of the Grand Slam season!\"\n\nEvert’s sister, Jeanne Evert Dubin, died from ovarian cancer in February 2020 at age 62.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEvert announced that she was \"cancer-free\" in an op-ed for ESPN in January 2023 and that there was a \"90% chance that the ovarian cancer will never come back.\"\n\n\"I encourage everyone to know your family history and advocate for yourself,\" Evert said. \"Early detection saves lives.
