        "text": "Tennis Hall of Famer Chris Evert said Friday her cancer has returned and she will not broadcast the Australian Open for ESPN while undergoing treatment.\n\n“While this is a diagnosis I never wanted to hear, I once again feel fortunate that it was caught early,” Evert said in a statement released by ESPN. “Doctors found cancer cells in the same pelvic region. All cells were removed, and I have begun another round of chemotherapy.”\n\nThe 68-year-old Evert was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer in December of 2021.\n\nEvert is an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion. The Australian Open begins next month.\n\n“I'll be ready for the rest of the Grand Slam season!” Evert said."
