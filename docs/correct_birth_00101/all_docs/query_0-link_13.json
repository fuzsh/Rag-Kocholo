Between 1974, with her first French Open championship, and 1986, with her record seventh, she collected eighteen Grand Slam singles titles, including two Australian Open, three Wimbledon, and six U.S. Open. Evert was one of the last major champions to use a wooden tennis racquet; her one-time fiancé Jimmy Connors had switched to metal, and her greatest rival, Czech star Martina Navratilova, was swinging a graphite model. Known as “America’s Sweetheart” for her on-court femininity, Evert also became known as the “Ice Maiden” for her steely nerves. Even in defeat, which was rare, Evert was always the gracious competitor. In 1995 she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nCredit Line\n\nNational Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of Al Satterwhite\n\nObject number\n\nNPG.2009.29\n\nRestrictions & Rights\n\nUsage conditions apply\n\nCopyright\n\n© 2008 Al Satterwhite\n\nType\n\nPhotograph\n\nMedium\n\nInkjet print\n\nDimensions\n\nImage: 31.8 x 21.3 cm (12 1/2 x 8 3/8\")\n\nSheet: 35.6 x 27.9 cm (14 x 11\")\n\nPlace\n\nUnited States\\Florida\\Broward\\Fort Lauderdale\n\nSee more items in\n\nNational Portrait Gallery Collection\n\nLocation\n\nCurrently not on view\n\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\nTopic\n\nEquipment\\Sports Equipment\\Tennis racket\n\nChris Evert: Female\n\nChris Evert: Sports and Recreation\\Athlete\\Tennis\n\nPortrait\n\nRecord ID\n\nnpg_NPG.2009.29\n\nMetadata Usage (text)\n\nUsage conditions apply\n\nGUID (Link to Original Record)\n\nhttp://n2t.net/ark:/65665/sm40ae34e35-8699-40a6-9cb5-0911b48ef73b"
