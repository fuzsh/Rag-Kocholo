Doctors found cancer cells in the same pelvic region.\n\n\"All cells were removed, and I have begun another round of chemotherapy.\"\n\nEvert won a women's record seven French Open singles titles and a joint-record six US Open titles, along with three Wimbledon titles and two at the Australian Open.\n\nThe former world number one has worked as a pundit since retiring in 1989.\n\nEvert's sister, Jeanne, died of the same disease in 2020.\n\n\"I encourage everyone to know your family history and advocate for yourself,\" Evert added.\n\n\"Early detection saves lives. Be thankful for your health this holiday season.\""
