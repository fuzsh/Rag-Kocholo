        "text": "- Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova are all-time greats in the tennis world, and their rivalry is the greatest in sports history.\n\nOver a magical golden era, in the '70s and '80s, women's tennis exploded in popularity, thanks in part to the two fierce competitors, Chrissie Evert and Martina Navratilova, who played 80 times, and staged, in my opinion, the greatest rivalry in the history of sports.\n\nI was at the 1971 US Open when I faced 16-year-old newcomer Chrissie Evert, in the semifinals.\n\nSince I was representing professional tennis, and she was still an amateur, the stakes were high.\n\nBut I was no stranger to pressure.\n\nI defeated Chrissie and ultimately won the US Open title.\n\nI've never seen it so exciting.\n\nShe made the US Open.\n\nShe was a superstar from childhood.\n\nAfter the match, I said to everyone, \"You guys, that kid is our next superstar.\n\nShe's it.\n\nShe's the one.\"\n\nThen the rising star, Martina Navratilova entered the US Circuit from Eastern Europe.\n\nShe was a powerhouse.\n\nI remember how angry she got when announcers would mangle her name, and I told her \"Don ' t worry.\n\nJust keep winning.\n\nThey'll learn to pronounce your name.\"\n\nChrissie took center court, capturing her first Slam at the 1974 French Open and another singles title at Wimbledon.\n\nAs Chrissie's popularity soared, Martina stepped up, challenging her at the 1975 French Open.\n\nTwo young women at the peak of their careers set the stage for an epic rivalry.\n\nWe were constantly waiting for the next big Chrissie-Martina match.\n\nIn 1984, Chris and Martina faced off in three of the four Grand Slam finals... Martina capturing all three titles.\n\nThe following two years, they battled it out in four more Grand Slam Finals, breaking even with two wins each.\n\nIn 1985, Chrissie beat defending champion Martina to reclaim the French Open title.\n\nIt was a fearless and tight match that could have gone on forever.\n\nSpectators on the edge of their seats until the very last moment.\n\nThey played 80 times.\n\nHave you ever heard of anybody playing 80 times?\n\nIn the end, Martina won 43 matches to Chrissie's 37.\n\nTennis fans were drawn to this rivalry because these two could not be more different from one another.\n\nChrissie came from sunny Florida and had the nickname of \"Cinderella in Sneakers\".\n\nShe knew how to keep her cool on the court, was unflappable, and had a sensational shot placement that was hard to match at the time.\n\nChris Evert, with a two-handed backhand, revolutionized the game.\n\nAll the kids started using that.\n\nAnd then Martina Navratilova took it to a new level because of her fitness.\n\nMartina was a full court drama, complete with emotional outburst.\n\nWatching these two on the court was like watching fireworks on the 4th of July.\n\nIndividually, Martina won the most singles titles in history with 167, while Chrissie trailed close behind at second place with 157 titles.\n\nThey took it to a whole new level.\n\nThis is our first generation of real pros.\n\nWhen they started, they made money.\n\nThey're like, all-time greats.\n\nWhen Martina and Chrissie joined the Virginia Slims tour with us, they amplified its popularit through their notorious rivalry, shining a brighter light on the tour and ushering in a new generation of stars.\n\nThey left an indelible mark on the sport and the road to gender equality.\n\nBoth Chrissie and Martina are my friends for life.\n\nI helped coach Martina to win her ninth Wimbledon singles title in 1990 by allowing her to reconnect to the joy of playing, and I convinced Chris to become president of the WTA after I stepped down, because I knew she could do it.\n\nAnd then we were both so proud when Martina followed in our footsteps by serving as the WTA president after us.\n\nRelationships are everything, and I'm grateful to hav Chrissie and Martina in my life."
