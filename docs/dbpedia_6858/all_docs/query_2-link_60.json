        "text": "Akira Kurosawa’s film Seven Samurai is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. But despite its age, the vitality and fleet-footed movement of Kurosawa’s epic is still breathtaking.\n\nTo watch it again is to be swept along, all over again, by its flowing action and breadth of vision.\n\nSeven Samurai moves just as swiftly as Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), the noble samurai leader of the seven, sprints this way and that in the climactic battle, the film flying through rice fields and down wooded pathways.\n\nKurosawa’s camera does not anticipate where the action is running so much as chase headlong after it.\n\nFor many of its admirers, Seven Samurai has likewise been a kind of pursuit. It is not that Kurosawa’s movie is so elusive – it is a fairly straightforward tale that states its meaning plainly.\n\nIts mystery is more the kind reserved for a grand monument whose existence seems as unfathomable as it is undeniable.\n\nThe film, a 207-minute epic about a 16th-century farm community that turns to a band of samurai to defend itself from marauding bandits, has seemed to always be here. It is about as lodged in movie canon as is possible.\n\nAny beginner list for world cinema probably includes it. In British magazine Sight and Sound’s decennial The Greatest Films of All Time poll of critics and filmmakers, it has slid slightly but not much.\n\nIn 2022, it ranked No 20, fittingly right alongside Apocalypse Now, whose director, Francis Ford Coppola, is one of Kurosawa’s most devoted acolytes.\n\nCoppola and his contemporaries, including Martin Scorsese and George Lucas, worshipped Kurosawa. Scorsese once described “the shock of that level of mastery” when he encountered Kurosawa’s movies in the 1950s.\n\nLater generations of filmmakers have had similar reactions. Alexander Payne called Seven Samurai a thunderbolt that changed his life. After seeing it as a young man, he said to himself: “I will never climb a mountain that high but I want to be on that mountain.”\n\n“No one has come near it,” American film critic Pauline Kael wrote years ago – a judgment that still holds.\n\nAffection, of course, is not universal for Seven Samurai. Kurosawa’s appeal in the West has always been in part because he, himself, was steeped in Hollywood genre films. The director, who made Seven Samurai after the masterworks Rashomon (1950) and Ikiru (1952), was influenced by John Ford’s films.\n\nWesterns, in turn, took after Kurosawa’s masterpiece, beginning with the 1960 John Sturges remake The Magnificent Seven, a film that took the American title from the initial US release of Seven Samurai, for which Japanese production and distribution company Toho Studios cut 50 minutes.\n\nThe enduring influence of Seven Samurai can be seen everywhere from the sideways wipe transitions of Star Wars to Pixar’s A Bug’s Life.\n\nAnd, given how many movies since have taken more superficial approaches to its band-of-warriors-assemble narrative, a pessimistic view of Seven Samurai could lament it as a forerunner to today’s spectacle-first big-budget movies.\n\nShot in 148 days spread out over an entire year, Seven Samurai was at its time the most expensive Japanese film ever made, and one of the most popular domestically.\n\nBut Seven Samurai should not have to pay for its paler imitations. Watching Kurosawa’s masterpiece again, it is startling just how much it remains in a class by itself.\n\nOne could point to particular elements – the choreography, the rain, the actor Toshiro Mifune – but it goes deeper than the vast sum of its many parts.\n\nWhen Kurosawa decided to make what would be his first samurai film, Japan was just emerging from post-war American occupation. The samurai genre had gone somewhat dormant during that period, and Seven Samurai would help re-establish it.\n\nBut Kurosawa’s film, which was written by him with Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni after a lengthy period of research, juggles themes of individualism and sacrifice for the common good that resonated in post-war Japan.\n\nSeven Samurai is closer to movie myth than local legend. Its ultimate battle is not between the samurai-assisted villagers and the bandits but lies in the tension between the samurai and the villagers, who anxiously hide their women from the hired warriors and who, in the end, celebrate a victory different than that of the samurai.\n\n“In the end, we lost this battle, too,” a surviving samurai says.\n\nSeven Samurai, at once hopeful and tragic, is less about a battle of good versus evil than it is a timeless soldier truth. The samurai do not, as the villagers do, return to normal life.\n\nAnd for those that perish face down in the mud – moments that Kurosawa pauses to linger on, and a perspective Michael Mann would later adopt for the deaths in Heat – destiny is particularly cruel.\n\nIn this eternally kinetic film, its moments of stillness are often the most profound."
