        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe name Akira Kurosawa immediately invokes cinema. If the name is not familiar, his work often is. Chances are everyone has at least heard of one of his film titles, including: Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Ikiru, The Bad Sleep Well, Rashomon and High and Low, not only because these films are all masterpieces, but many of them have been remade into a variety of properties. Additionally, he was the first to use certain filmmaking techniques and storytelling choices that have all become standard. There is no modern or post-modern film without the work of Akira Kurosawa. For that reason, Kurosawa, and his work, will be the next subject for this blog’s sociological analysis and review. However, given that Kurosawa made 30 films over his near 60-year career (which would take me two and a half years to complete at my current pace) it would take too long to complete. Instead, over the coming months I will be doing a deep dive into Kurosawa’s Jidaigeki Chambara films.\n\nJidaigeki and Chambara films\n\nJidaigeki loosely translates into English as “period piece”, what we might think of in western cinema as a “costume drama”. The Japanese conceive of a period in their history far earlier than the Victorian era often depicted in western “costume dramas”. In Japan, Jidaigekis usually take place during the Edo period of Japan that spans 1603-1868, as well as the Meiji period between 1868-1912. Chambara translated to mean “Sword Fight” is a sub-genre of the Jidaigeki films that focuses on the Samurai class and usually takes place in the Tokugawa period of 1600-1868; when the Samurai class was fading due to western influences. A lot of Samurai films center on the “Ronin” or masterless Samurai, who have been jobless and homeless since their retainer and lord (called a Daimyo) lost his land and status due to the socio-political changes in Japan. These “Roaming Ronins”, who still retained the status of Samurai, would farm out their martial skills to survive.\n\nChambara films gained prominence in a post-World War II era. Allowing Japanese directors to reinforce the “spirit” of the Samurai into the culture, and as if modeling after reality, would often feature psychologically and physically scarred warriors (usually from previous battles or wars) as their protagonists. Many of the post war Chambara films were darker in tone and significantly more violent. Given this particular effect/purpose, most of the Chambara films produced were between 1950-1980. While there are some outliers, few Chambara films are made today. Instead, “The Samurai Spirit” is imbued in modern genre pictures (Sci-fi, Fantasy, Crime Noir) and motivates the actors that have a lineage in the Samurai class.\n\nBRIEF HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nKurosawa got his directing career off the ground with a job as an assistant director for PCL (Photo Chemical Laboratories) a company that would later become Toho Pictures in 1936. To get the job, he had submitted an essay in which applicants were asked to identify the fundamental deficiencies in Japanese film. To which Kurosawa answered that the flaws were fundamental, and that there was no way to fix them. This intrigued examiner and director Kajiro Yamamoto who became a mentor to the young Kurosawa. Yamamoto pushed Kurosawa to write for the screen. It was his belief that a good director was also a screenwriter; something that Kurosawa would do for the rest of his life.\n\nKurosawa’s directing career and trajectory was greatly hindered by Japan’s involvement in World War II. The censorship board rejected his first major studio film, Sanshiro Sugata. They considered the work to be too “western” (A criticism that would be consistent throughout Kurosawa’s career). The film was permanently stalled until famed director Yasujiro Ozu, threw his artistic reputation and clout behind the film. The meteoric success of Sugata, and the structure of the studio system contract, forced Kurosawa to make an unintended sequel which is regarded as the worst film in his career. While several of his films became successful during this period, Kurosawa did not “become Kurosawa” until well into the post war period of Japan, when he first began his collaboration with the Cinematic force of nature Tashiro Mifune and the steady and consistent power of Takashi Shimura.\n\nThe collaboration between Takashi Shimura, Akira Kurosawa and Tashiro Mifune is a cinematic Triumvirate that is unparalleled. All three working together a total of 13 times over their respective careers (and additionally with Kurosawa separately), Kurosawa’s work and Chambara films in general, would not be what they are, without the work of these two men. Shimura and Mifune star (or are featured) in 7 out of the 8 Kurosawa Samurai films I will be covering in this series. One essay, in discussing the two actor’s collaboration, compared Shimura and Mifune, to DeNiro and Pacino in their approach, screen presence and captivation. Additionally, both lent their talents to other films in the genre. The image of Tashiro Mifune in Samurai garb, became the basis for how a traditional Samurai should look in the medium.There is no modern Chambara films without these three men. Their commitment to the craft of the genre can never be understated.\n\nOne of the many reasons Akira Kurosawa became such a famed director, was for his western influences. It was his thinking that Japanese cinema at the time was fundamentally flawed that got him his first job. But over the course of his career, Kurosawa began to show these western foundations. Directors like Fritz Lang and John Ford, to Writers like Shakespeare and Dostoevsky, all became apparent influences in Kurosawa’s work. Yet, because Kurosawa was coming into film when Japanese cinema was waning, His style became the foundation of a lot of Japanese Cinema moving forward.\n\nKurosawa not only revolutionized Japanese Cinema, but his name became synonymous with Japanese Cinema in the west. Starting with Rashomon, most of his films had a wide release and therefore a wide influence, especially in the United states during the 1970’s. The directors coming out of US film schools in the late 1960’s- 1970’s, “borrowed” heavily from Kurosawa, Scorsese, Milius, Spielberg, Coppola and especially George Lucas, cite Kurosawa as a major influence on their work . This influence was so strong that these directors worked together to not only get Kurosawa a lifetime achievement Oscar, but they also helped to both produce and distribute some of his later films including: Kagemusha, Dreams and Ran.\n\nSEEDS OF SOCIAL ANALYSIS\n\nBecause Kurosawa’s Chambara films are usually taking place at the tail end of the Edo Period, he is consistently dealing with issues of class dynamics; often juxtaposing the status of the Samurai class, with many of his characters being both penniless and homeless. He may localize this by telling the story through the two lowest status characters, as he does in The Hidden Fortress, or challenge the status stereotypes between peasants and samurai in Seven Samurai, or the retention of honor in the face of poverty in the Sanjiro duology. Kurosawa has a lot to say when it comes to poverty, social class and how those things play out in a feudal society but reflect the social issues of the time.\n\nA lot of the other thematic elements Kurosawa plays with are those found in western literature. Specifically for this series, Kurosawa’s Shakespearian Chambara adaptations are important. Thus, the thematic elements in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, and King Lear, are shown through a Japanese cultural prism with Kurosawa’s Throne of Blood and Ran respectively.\n\nUnlike Miyazaki, the focus of the previous series, Kurosawa does not have a strong track record when it comes to inclusive cinema. Many of his roles for women are under written and stereotypically one dimensional. He does not discuss social issues involving race, gender, or disability. As I will discuss, part of this is the historical context in which he was living and the socio-political environment in which he was working, and part of it was his own enculturated ideas about gender.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nKurosawa is a master filmmaker and one of the 5 greatest directors in history, that without him, cinema would not be the same. His process, themes and understanding of the power and importance of cinema, have allowed film to continue after his death. All of Kurosawa’s work is spectacular, and everyone should watch all 30 of his films at some point. But I am of the opinion that, excluding Ikiru, which is devastatingly powerful on its own, his Samurai films are my favorite, and the films that are most digestible to a western audience, as many of them mirror the actual genre of the Western itself.\n\nPersonally, I have always been fascinated with Japanese culture, especially the Samurai class. Kurosawa’s Chambara films are a big part of why and how that interest became so important to my identity. To be able to break Kurosawa’s work down including my favorite film of all time sociologically, using sociological theories and ideas, is the quintessential reason I continue to write these reviews. It is my hope, that through this series, I will add a sociological dimension to the criticism of Kurosawa, and I get some readers interested in going back and (Re) discovering the greatness that is, Akira Kurosawa."
