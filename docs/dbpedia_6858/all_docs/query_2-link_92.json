        "text": "Profession: Film Director and Screenwriter\n\nBiography: Akira Kurosawa was a Japanese filmmaker and painter regarded as one of the all-time greatest directors. Over a career of more than fifty years, he directed 30 films and became synonymous with innovative storytelling and technical mastery in film.\n\nKurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, beginning as an assistant director and later moving on to screenwriting. He made his directorial debut with the judo saga Sanshiro Sugata in 1943.\n\nA significant turning point in Kurosawa's career came when he started working with actor Toshiro Mifune, their first project together being Drunken Angel in 1948. This marked the start of 16 cinematic collaborations between them.\n\nHis film Rashomon in 1950 was especially pivotal as it won the prestigious Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival and introduced Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to a wider international audience. Kurosawa's subsequent films of the 1950s and 60s—such as Ikiru in 1952, Seven Samurai in 1954, and Yojimbo in 1961—firmly established his reputation as a director.\n\nIn his later years, Kurosawa continued to produce films like Kagemusha in 1980 and the epic Ran in 1985. He was honored with the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1990 in recognition of his profound impact on filmmaking.\n\nFollowing his death in 1998, his contributions were further celebrated when he was proclaimed \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN. His legacy continues through his works, as well as the Akira Kurosawa School of Film and the Kurosawa Production Company.\n\nBorn: March 23, 1910\n\nBirthplace: Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Dog\n\nStar Sign: Aries"
