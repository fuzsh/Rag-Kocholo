        "text": "Inspire\n\nWho better to recommend you a list of great films than this master Japanese director?\n\nFor a real film lover, perhaps the most complicated task of all is to pick your favorite films. Having generated deep emotional and esthetic links with hundreds of films and for all of which one is grateful, having to rule out the majority of them to leave just a handful must be a tough and even agonizing call.\n\nWhen, at the end of his life, Akira Kurosawa sat down to list his 100 favorite films, he no doubt had a hard time of it. The sensibility that characterized the career of the acclaimed Japanese director, together with his cinematographic skill as a result of having seen thousands of films must have made such an exercise an epic one. And perhaps for that reason Kurosawa decided to set himself a guide: Only include one film from each director, obligating him to leave out masterpieces by certain directors who produced more than one brilliant work during their careers.\n\nKurosawa’s list contains certain peculiarities, the most surprising of which is perhaps the failure to include Orson Welles (‘Citizen Kane’ is a notable absence, without a doubt). But the inclusion of Jim Jarmusch’s Stranger than Paradise (1984) is another surprise, as is Luis Buñuel’s Un Chien Andalou (1928) in sixth place, and Hana-bi (1997), the gentle comedy by fellow Japanese director Takeshi Kitano which was released just one year before Kurosawa’s death."
