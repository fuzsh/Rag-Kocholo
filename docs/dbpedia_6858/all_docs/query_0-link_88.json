        "text": "Director: Akira Kurosawa\n\nEntertainment grade: Aâ€“\n\nHistory grade: B+\n\nMori Motonari was a daimyo in western Honshu, Japan, during the turbulent Sengoku period in the 16th century.\n\nRan (meaning discord) is based on his life and on the Celtic-Shakespearean story of King Lear.\n\nFamily\n\nHidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai), the film's version of Motonari, has decided to divide his kingdom between his three sons: the dutiful Taro and Jiro, and the rebellious Saburo. Saburo throws a strop. \"You are either senile or insane!\" he shouts. Hidetora explains that the three brothers will have to ally in the face of a threat and illustrates this by giving each of them an arrow. One arrow alone is easy to snap. But if you put three together, it is much harder to snap them as a bunch. Saburo strains, grimaces, and petulantly snaps all three. Hidetora glowers. There's just no impressing some people with your picturesque paternal wisdom. The arrow proverb is indeed attributed to Motonari, so this scene gives a nod to history, even if it is written for dramatic effect.\n\nMurder\n\nTaro, the eldest brother, is installed in the most important castle; with him goes his scheming wife Kaede (Mieko Harada). If you like your King Lear spiced up with plenty of Lady Macbeth and a hint of the woman who crawls out of the telly to kill people in Ring, Kaede is the real star of this movie. Years before, Hidetora killed her family. Now she plans an elaborate revenge. Kaede is a fictional character but, in a real-life parallel to her backstory, Motonari did murder most of the house of Amako.\n\nSociety\n\nCast out by his own son, Hidetora wanders the countryside, accompanied by his loyal fool, a topknotted irritant who alternates between platitudinous observation and the striking of poses commonly seen in a Year 10 drama class. He's enough to drive anyone mad, and soon poor Hidetora is losing his marbles all over the place. Some kindly peasants take pity on him. \"Don't take charity from peasants!\" cries a vassal. \"A samurai would rather starve than beg!\" \"That's right!\" exclaims Hidetora. \"The peasants are presumptuous. Burn their villages!\" This is all Ran has to say about the lot of early modern Japanese peasants, but it's probably right in suggesting they couldn't really win.\n\nRomance\n\nThere's a storming battle scene, and Taro is killed. The widowed Kaede immediately transfers her terrifying attentions to Jiro, who is already married to another woman whose entire family was killed by Hidetora back in the day. (Motonari, like Hidetora, made a habit of this sort of thing: in addition to his slaughter of the Amako family, he ravaged the house of Ouchi. A prequel to Ran would be thrilling stuff.) After seducing Jiro, Kaede bursts into tears, because she's so jealous of his wife. The bewildered Jiro offers to dump his wife, whereupon Kaede sobs even more. \"That's not what I want!\" she bawls. Ah, thinks the viewer: so she is morally honourable at some level. \"Such a woman should not remain alive!\" Oh. Maybe not.\n\nWar\n\nEveryone hates each other, most people are dead, and the deranged Hidetora is living rough. His long, white beard has gone all straggly, and in his red and white robes he looks like a sad, defeated Father Christmas. The fool makes him a pointy hat out of reeds, with two daffodil horns. This cheers him up a bit. Finally, there is an epic battle sequence, which is the most beautifully and accurately recreated sequence of early modern Japanese warfare you're ever likely to see. Based meticulously on the stunning panel and scroll paintings of the era, it includes gorgeous reproductions of contemporary armour, hundreds of charging horses ripping up great clods of earth, and great blasts of pink gunpowder. Sensational.\n\nVerdict\n\nRan expands the historical story of Mori Motonari into the realm of fiction, but as an evocation of Senguko Japan it is a knockout."
