        "text": "For Christ the Lord hath risen,\n\nOur joy that hath no end.*\n\nHow was your weekend? We had a glorious (but windy) Saturday, followed by a rainy Sunday–par for the course this spring. Daughter #1 came home and we went to the Sappington House Country Craft Festival where we walked around their lovely grounds, checked out their library and perused the craft booths.\n\nWe moved on to a couple of estate sales. Daughter #1 found a nice little “brown” table and when one of the guys helped us move it to my car, he asked, “Which car is yours?” I said, “The little green car over there.” “Oh, the Mini Coop!” he replied. “I remember you ladies! Have a blessed day.” Yes, we are that Mother-Daughter pair in the Mini Coop. My day was made.\n\nWe spent the remainder of the afternoon on the patio soaking up the vitamin D under the umbrella, which, thankfully, did not blow over.\n\nWe went to church on Sunday and heard a good sermon on shame from the text, Genesis 18:9-15. After church we celebrated my birthday (again) with a breakfast casserole and cake…\n\nand more presents…\n\nWe played inside…\n\n…but we also managed to spend some time outside…\n\nWe found a good spot for my new elephant…\n\nThen everyone went home and I caught up with daughter #2 on FT.\n\nAre those baby Crocs not the cutest?\n\nMeanwhile, continuing on my theme of watching Akira Kurosawa films, I watched The Hidden Fortress (1958) last week, which stars Toshiro Mifune and Misa Uehara as the princess. The story follows two unlucky and rather stupid peasants who seemingly cannot do anything right. Bickering constantly, they end up in the middle of a war and become pivotal in helping a princess get over the border to safety in Hayakawa. Of course, Toshiro Mifune is there as the general tasked to escort the princess and do all the heavy lifting and thinking. The princess herself is a very interesting character–smart, dignified, courageous, kind, and beautiful. The bond forged between her and the bondswoman she saves is quite touching. (Boy, you can have all your Disney princesses–this is a great princess.)\n\nThere is a lot of action and we get to see Toshiro do some great stunt riding– standing in the stirrups and wielding a sword with both hands while screaming the Japanese version of a rebel yell. It doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nA lot has been written about George Lucas being heavily influenced by this movie when developing Star Wars. This is not surprising since everything he has ever done is derivative of something else. (He has said that R2D2 and C3PO are based on the two peasants.) You can argue that Kurosawa was derivative of John Ford–okay. But the bottom line is that this is a very entertaining and insightful film. It also has something significant to say about kindness (what an overworked word these days) and friendship. The princess learns a lot and she isn’t ashamed to say so. Even on the verge of being beheaded, she can say:\n\nI have enjoyed the journey. The happiness of these days, I would have never known living in the castle. I’ve seen people as they are, without pretense. I’ve seen their beauty and their ugliness with my own eyes.\n\nGreat, great movie–check it out. You can rent it on Amazon Prime or watch it here.\n\nP.S. We also watched Paul Blart: Mall Cop II (2015)–one of our low-brow favorites. The OM was riveted, but apparently unamused. Sorry (not sorry) Kevin James is a laugh riot.\n\n*The Day of Resurrection, John of Damascus, 749, tr. by John M. Neale, 1862\n\nSince I started watching postwar Akira Kurosawa films earlier this week, I have continued down that trail. I watched Scandal (1950) with a young and very handsome Toshiro Mifune.\n\nIt is the story of Ichiro Aoye, an artist, who meets a famous young classical singer while painting in the mountains. They share an innocent encounter and are photographed by the paparazzi who spread a lie to sell their trashy magazine. The artist takes the magazine to court and drama ensues.\n\nLike the director John Ford, Kurosawa had a “stock company” of his own, and many of the actors are included in this movie to great effect, especially Takashi Shimura, who plays Aoye’s lawyer.\n\nYou probably remember him from more than twenty appearances in his films. He is the Ward Bond of Kurosawa films.\n\nAfter Scandal I watched The Idiot (1951), Kurosawa’s monumental adaption of Dostoevsky’s novel. Filmed originally as a two-part production running 265 minutes, it was released in a truncated 166 minute version. The movie, heavily edited by the studio, was a failure at the box office, but I have to say, I loved it.\n\nKurosawa follows the events of the novel, but he changes its setting from 19th century Russia to post-war Japan. Dostoevsky’s Christlike Prince Myshkin, returning to St. Petersburg after being treated at a clinic in Switzerland, becomes Kurosawa’s Kameda, returning home from the war after being saved at the lat minute from being executed (by mistake) as a war criminal. Masayuki Mori as Kameda (the Idiot) and Toshiro Mifune as his friend Akama are both wonderful in this tale of “the destruction of a pure soul by a faithless world.” Setsuko Hara and Yoshiko Kuga, the female leads, are wonderful too. There is no rain in this film, but the snowstorm which rages throughout deftly conveys the storm within each of the principal players.\n\nI don’t know what exactly it is about these movies, but they speak so eloquently to the human condition. The characters all seem so real. All the actors give 100% unselfconsciously. There is so much feeling without any melodrama. I was riveted.\n\nAyako: How did it feel when you were facing certain death?\n\nKameda: Everyone in the world suddenly seemed so dear to me.\n\nAyako: Everyone in the world?\n\nKameda: Each and every person I’d ever known. Everyone I’d ever passed on the street. And not just people – the puppy I’d thrown a rock at as a child. Why hadn’t I been kinder?\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend you watch these terrific movies!\n\nIn other news, daughter #1, the OM and I are getting ready for our big car trip next week. Leaving on Sunday, we are driving to Oklahoma City, then on to Fort Worth and Waco, Texas. Then we’ll head home by way of Tulsa. We are going to check out some great museums along the way.\n\nDaughter #2 will be blogging for us while we’re gone next week, so be sure to check in for what’s new with the toddler set and for travel updates!\n\n*Akama in The Idiot (1951)\n\nWell, there is bound to be a big let-down after a big event that you have planned for so long… …and I am in the middle of it. Good grief, two weeks of non-stop socializing with family and friends and people staying in your house…\n\nBut c’est la vie. This past weekend I did very little but straighten up the house and do laundry. I still have more straightening to do, but I made a lot of progress.\n\nI also spent a good amount of time with my new best friend Walt Longmire, who has joined the ranks of my small club of Best Fictional Characters Ever (Holden Caulfield, Philip Marlowe, Dick Summers…). The book (NOT to be confused with the television show) I just finished was As the Crow Flies, which ends with Walt’s daughter getting married in a traditional Cheyenne ceremony.\n\n…the two birds I’d noticed were crows circling right above the meadow, the primaries of their wing tips spread like fingers as they rode the thermals that lifted them into the cloudless sky.\n\nMaybe it was an omen, but I decided to take it as a good one. I’d heard that crows mate for life and are known to raise their young for as long as five years.\n\nSometimes you don’t get that long.\n\nI thought about Audrey Plain Feather and how her life hadn’t turned out the way she’d hoped–maybe nobody’s did.\n\nMy wife Martha’s hadn’t. Mine hadn’t. Even Henry’s hadn’t.\n\nMaybe Cady’s would.\n\nIt’s hopes like this that you cling to at major turning points in your life and, more important, the lives of your children. You keep going, and you hope for the best, and sometimes, maybe not very often, your hopes come true.\n\nI also watched Red Beard (1965) directed by Akira Kurosawa and starring Toshiro Mifune. I had read about this film on the Mockingbird website and knew it was a favorite movie of the Rev. John Zahl, but had never seen it or really heard much about it. Indeed, the British Film Institute’s 2015 list of “10 Essential Kurosawa Films” did not feature Red Beard. But there is a Criterion Films DVD and so I got it from Netflix.\n\nAnd let me tell you, this is a great, great movie! It poses the question, “Why is there so much suffering in the world?” The answer is illusive, as we know, but there is solace to be found in knowing that there are, indeed, good people in the world. This is the lesson learned by several characters in the movie including the protagonist, a young, arrogant doctor played by Yuzo Kayama. Red Beard, Toshira Mifune, is one of the good people. He has learned to overcome his own arrogance in order to love people where they are and to help them. It reminded me of Sunday’s Gospel, where Jesus says, “Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matthew 11: 30)\n\nIndeed, the movie is about love and grace and is absolutely amazing. There are so many great scenes–I tear up just thinking about them!–such as the scene where the clinic serving women scream the name of the dying child (“Chobu!”) down the well to pull his soul back from the dead. Do not put off seeing this great movie because it is three hours long and you think you are not in the mood for a “downer” movie. It is inspiring. Also, I was struck by the acting in this movie, which is so, so good and rather subdued by Japanese standards.\n\nAnyway, I just loved it and highly recommend it to you. I watched it alone, of course. The OM left after half an hour to water the shrubs. I guess he wasn’t in the mood.\n\nBut, hello. Someone left this “toast prop” at my house!\n\nIt’s the simple things, right?\n\n*Cheyenne motto"
