A reinterpretation of King Lear, it focuses on a 16th-century ruler (Tatsuya Nakadai, High and Low) who announces that he will divide his kingdom equally among his three sons. In his dotage, he falls prey to the false flattery of the two oldest brothers, while banishing the other (Daisuke Ryu, Kagemusha), the only member of the family who loves him enough to speak the truth. Presented in a stunning 4K digital restoration courtesy of Rialto Pictures."
