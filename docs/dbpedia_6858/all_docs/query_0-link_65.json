        "text": "Roger Ebert observed in his original review of “Ran,” this epic tragedy might have been attempted by a younger director, but only the Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, who made the film at age 75, could bring the requisite experience and maturity to this stunning interpretation of Shakespeare’s “King Lear.” It’s a film for the ages–one of the few genuine screen masterpieces–and arguably serves as an artistic summation of the great director’s career. In this version of the Shakespeare tragedy, the king is a 16th-century warlord who decides to retire and divide his kingdom evenly among his three sons. As familial tensions rise and betrayal sends Lord Hidetora into the throes of escalating madness, “Ran” (the Japanese character for “chaos”) reaches a fever pitch through epic battles and a fortress assault that is simply one of the most amazing sequences on film."
