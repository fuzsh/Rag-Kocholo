I bet hardly anyone's gonna respond here since you're all busy with your anime to do something worthwhile with yourself. Now, I'm not saying anime's bad, don't get me wrong. What I am saying is that it's pitiful when people won't recognize true art and obsess over petty entertainment (I know not all of it's like that, but most of it is, like everything else) and like all things pathetic, they're gonna hid behind the word 'opinion' without even trying to defend themselves, and therein they loose the battle. It kinda says something about the community when the name 'Radiohead' isn't taken.\n\nNo offense, of course. )\n\nNo, not Akira, the Japanese cartoon, but Akira Kurosawa, the respectable film director who's directed Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Ran and Yojimbo among others films.

It kinda says something about the community when the name 'Radiohead' isn't taken.\n\nNo offense, of course. )\n\nYou do realize that movies ARE entertainment, you love those movies, therefore you're obsessed with petty entertainment as well. Stop judging everyone like we're shut off from the world because we're fans of Pokemon. It's pretty obvious you're trolling, and as cautious as you're trying to be it isn't working. To simply insult a whole forum and then say \"no offense, of course. \" is not going to fly. Very little of your post even talks about the director, you simply mention it about twice in the first two or so sentences, and the rest is simply bashing the forum and people you know nothing about.\n\nAs for the director, I've never seen his movies nor am I a fan of those types of movies.\n\nRadiohead, I can see you're new here, but at the risk of mini-modding... you're kinda being an ass. Yes, it's a shame when classics get ignored, but by that same token, you're greatly under-mining today's entertainment and the people who enjoy it. I enjoy a lot of said entertainment, especially anime of the past twenty years (several of which ARE quality and are not mindless blow-up fests as you're making them out to be), but I'm sure as hell not so close-minded that I'll completely shrug off something just for being in black-and-white. Simply being aware of the fact that movies from half a century ago exist does not make you better than everyone else, stop talking down on others as if you're tough shit.\n\nNow, concerning this actual thread, yes, I saw some of his films. I've checked out Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Ran from my college library last year. They were all pretty enjoyable.\n\nPersonally, it was never Kurosawa's name that got me interested in most of his movies, bur rather, I only watched his movies because of Toshiro Mifune, who I've been a huge fan of ever since I first saw The Sword of Doom when I was a kid. I know he was only a side character, but he was still completely awesome. In fact, it was Mifune that got me interested in Japanese culture to begin with, including anime and manga.\n\nAnd Radiohead, they're right. You're being a troll. You're trying really hard to pretend that your not, but anyone who actually read that first post can tell.\n\nIf you were genuinely \"better than [us] plebians\", not only would you have realized the correct spelling is actually \"plebeians\", but you'd have also felt no need to create this ridiculous thread.\n\nI'm a fan of Kurosawa's work, and have most of the Criterion Collection releases of his films... but honestly dude, you're coming off as just another pseudo-intellectual jackass.\n\nThere's a difference between appreciating classic films, and doing so in a vain attempt to paint oneself as more intelligent than one truly is. What you're doing is the latter, and most people find it irritating as heck."
