        "text": "It's taken Criterion awhile, but the movie that made Japanese director Akira Kurosawa a recognizable name in the west has finally arrived on DVD. With The Hidden Fortress, Seven Samurai, Sanjuro, Yojimbo, and High and Low already out, Rashomon is the sixth Kurosawa film to receive the Criterion DVD treatment -- and it's another keeper. Released theatrically in 1950 by Daiei, Rashomon is a product of Kurosawa's short-lived Motion Picture Art Association during his stint away from Japanese movie giant Toho from 1949 to 1951. Although many of Kurosawa's early films starting with his directorial debut Sanshiro Sugata have won critical acclaim, it was Rashomon that really introduced Kurosawa to western audiences. Based on the suggestion of Italiafilm's Guilliana Stramigioli, Daiei reluctantly submitted the film to the Venice Film Festival -- where it won first prize and shocked the Japanese film industry. Though successful in Japan, Rashomon had been deemed too convoluted and \"Japanese\" to be compatible for export. But the mystery-style storyline and imaginative visuals of the title struck a chord with European and American audiences alike, and Rashomon is remembered by many as their first exposure to the world of Japanese filmmaking.\n\nThe Movie\n\nRashomon is based on two short stories by Ryonosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927). Even though the movie takes its name from the story Rashomon, most of its narrative is actually based on Akutagawa's Yabu no Naka (In a Grove), which tells the story of a crime through seven different testimonials. Kurosawa took the heart of the short story and framed it with a background story about a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), a priest and a commoner who seek shelter from a rainstorm under a decrepit Buddhist temple gate (Rashomon). As the three wait for the rain to stop, the woodcutter starts to talk about a murder trial that both he and the priest testified at. The crime involves a samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his beautiful wife (Machiko Kyo), as well as the accused, a boisterous bandit named Tajomaru (Toshiru Mifune) and the woodcutter himself. Kurosawa then presents us with four different accounts of the crime. I don't want to give anything away, but as you watch the crime unfold again and again, you will notice subtle (and not so subtle) differences in each version of the story until you can't be sure anymore what really took place. Every time you think you've heard the truth, a mysteriously missing dagger reminds you that all truth is relative.\n\nAkutagawa's In a Grove is often seen as a joke on the then popular \"I novel,\" enticing you to doubt and discount every story told in the first person -- there is no truth -- and thus echoing the teachings of Buddhism. Kurosawa takes the story, mixes in the setting and some of the irony from Rashomon and adds a glimmer of hope to make it a slightly more upbeat experience. It's a credit to Kurosawa's ability as a director that he can pull off a more positive ending without altering Akutagawa's message. Rashomon is entertaining to watch from the beginning to the end, thanks to its unpredictable and compelling storytelling, but also to its impressive visuals.\n\nWatch American movies from the '50s and you'll find plenty of unconvincing stage settings complete with hokey rear projection and the like. To really drive its point home, Rashomon had to look and feel real -- and Kurosawa pulls it off perfectly. Most of the movie is shot outside under a real sky and in a real forest. Using fast camera moves and often filming directly into the sun, Rashomon is a lively mix of light and shadows that, just like its story, hides just as much as it shows out in the open. The shots of the crumbling gate obscured by the torrential downpour remain some of the most amazing black and white images put on film. You could literally freeze-frame this movie, take a random picture of any scene and end up with something you can proudly frame and hang from your wall. But the movie just wouldn't work without a competent set of actors. Modern viewers may feel that some of the acting comes across as overly stylized, which is no surprise since Rashomon mostly adheres to the conventions of Japanese jidaigeki samurai films. But the acting complements the setting and the story perfectly. While it may not be the perfect vehicle to show off actor Toshiru Mifune's range, Rashomon shows Kurosawa's favorite leading man in top form in the role of bandit Tajomaru. Essentially a precursor of Mifune's later performance as Kikuchiyo in Seven Samurai, Mifune is clearly having fun as the rowdy, scratching, always-sweaty robber. Fans of the Seven Samurai will also enjoy Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter (he played the leader of the samurai) as well as Daisuke Kato and Minoru Chiaki.\n\nTo sum it up, Rashomon is a delightful movie that remains as poignant as it was 50 years ago. If you stumbled into this review expecting an action picture with plenty of swordplay, the later Kurosawa films like Seven Samurai or Sanjuro will better serve you. But if you're into Japanese films and you want to see one of many fantastic movies that cemented Kurosawa's reputation as the greatest Japanese filmmaker of our time, then Rashomon is not to be missed. Just like Hidden Fortress inspired Star Wars, Seven Samurai was remade as The Magnificent Seven, and Yojimbo was reconstructed shot by shot as A Fistful of Dollars, Rashomon left a profound influence on western cinema. Remade as The Outrage (starring Paul Newman), Rashomon has served as the inspiration for countless movies and TV show episodes, including The X-Files and Star Trek.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nAccording to Criterion, the DVD uses a new high-definition transfer, created from a 35mm fine-grain master positive on a high-definition Spirit Datacine (the original negative still exists, but was apparently in terrible condition). The black and white picture is sharp, well defined, and free of artifacts, but the master positive must have been riddled with plenty of tiny little specks and scratches. Though Criterion used the MTI Digital Restoration System to remove \"thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches,\" there are still thousands more and the resulting video isn't nearly as clean as Criterion's Seven Samurai DVD, for example. In addition to the scratching, the film is also rather unsteady, with the image jumping up and down in many scenes. This becomes especially apparent during tight and static close-ups of the characters' confession sequences and should have been corrected during the restoration efforts.\n\nThe film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:33:1 (full frame).\n\n5 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nKeeping in mind that Rashomon was shot more than 50 years ago, the Dolby Digital mono audio track is surprisingly clear. The last time I saw Rashomon, I had rented it from a video store in Tokyo and it was hard to hear some of the sequences. Criterion did a great job removing clicks, pops, hisses, and crackles from the audio. Though there is still some background noise, it's consistent and doesn't detract from the actors' deliveries and Hayasaki's interesting Bolero music.\n\nThe movie is subtitled in English, but an optional English soundtrack is also available. While the English audio is clear, the dubbing is terribly cheesy so be sure to stick with the Japanese original.\n\n6 out of 10\n\nExtras\n\nPast Criterion releases of Kurosawa movies have traditionally been light on the extras (quite a disappointment considering the number of documentaries that exist about Kurosawa and the many movies his films have inspired), but Rashomon is a step in the right direction. In addition to Rashomon-specific excerpts from the documentary The World of Kazuo Miyagawa (Rashomon's cinematographer), the DVD also includes an introduction by Robert Altman and feature-length commentary by Donald Richie, Japanese-film historian and author of The Films of Akira Kurosawa. Richie makes for an entertaining narrator who not only provides background info on the making of the film but also points out major plot points and puts Rashomon in perspective with other Japanese movies of its time. Considering Kurosawa's turbulent career, it's too bad there is no definitive making-of feature or biographical documentary on the disk. Luckily, the high quality booklet, complete with introduction by film critic Stephen Prince, excerpt from Kurosawa's biography and both Akutagawa short stories in full help paint a better picture of the director and the literature that inspired his movie.\n\n7 out of 10\n\nOverall, Criterion's Rashomon DVD is the best looking and sounding version of the movie on the market. Sadly, time hasn't been kind to the film -- and considering the bad condition of the original negative, this transfer is likely going to be the best you'll ever see. Fans of Japanese cinema shouldn't think twice about adding Rashomon to their collection."
