        "text": "Akira Kurosawa is unquestionably the best known Japanese filmmaker in the West. This can perhaps be best explained by the fact that he is not so much a Japanese or a Western filmmaker, but that he is a \"modern\" filmmaker. Like postwar Japan itself, he combines the ancient traditions with a distinctly modern, Western twist."
