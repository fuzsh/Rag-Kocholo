New PS Series EqualLogic Storage Solutions

Expanding on the Fluid Data Architecture Dell introduced the EqualLogic PS6100 and PS4100 family of virtualized, IP-based storage offerings. Additionally a new EqualLogic 5.1 firmware will enable storage solutions to integrate into existing environments without downtime. With the new product offerings, Dell will begin using 2.5 inch drive support for the EqualLogic product line, which the company says will provide the PS Series arrays a 60 percent performance improvement over the previous generation.

The PS4100 Series is aimed at small to medium businesses and supports up to 36TB in a single array and 72TB in a single group. The PS6100 Series will provide mid-sized customers with a scalable storage environment and will support up to 72TB in a single array and 1.2PB in a single group. Dell also started shipping the new EqualLogic FS7500 NAS solution that works with EqualLogic PS Series arrays.

“With the latest release of the Dell EqualLogic PS Series platform, Dell is expanding on the mid-market storage standard it has set in terms of ease of use, reliability and performance,” said Steve Bishop, Chief Technology Officer, Atlanta-based VeriStor Systems, a Dell PartnerDirect reseller. “This new series of storage arrays continues to integrate seamlessly with VMware and builds on the innovative Dell EqualLogic platform we trust for our mid-market virtual infrastructure implementations as well as our growing cloud-based disaster recovery services.”
