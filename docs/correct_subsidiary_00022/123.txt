NASHUA (AP) — EqualLogic Inc., a provider of data storage systems, has agreed to be acquired by Dell for $1.4 billion in cash.

The deal was announced today, just as EqualLogic prepared for an initial public offering.

EqualLogic’s software lets a single computer function like several machines, which means companies can spend less on hardware and energy to run data centers.

Research firm IDC estimates spending on so-called virtualization software and services will exceed $15 billion worldwide by 2011, up from $6.5 billion last year.

EqualLogic has more than 3,200 customers in 30 countries.

The deal is expected to close early next year.
