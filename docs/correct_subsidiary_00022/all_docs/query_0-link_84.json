        "text": "Head in the clouds, check. Feet on the ground? Well.\n\nDell said Monday it agreed to acquire 3PAR, a virtualized storage provider, for $1.15 billion in cash, or $18 a share, an 86% premium to 3PAR's closing price on Friday. That's a hefty price for 3PAR, a company that is unprofitable but had $194.3 million in revenues in fiscal 2010.\n\nThe acquisition will also make a competitor out of Dell's storage partner EMC. Dell claimed there is no \"overlap\" between 3PAR and EMC in an analyst call shortly after the announcement. But others are not so sure.\n\n\"We expect EMC to move even quicker to diversify itself further away from Dell,\" Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes said in a report.\n\nSo why did Dell do it? For one, it's after 3PAR's high-end product line and high gross margins.\n\n\"What 3PAR brings is the gross margin structure that really allows us to make the kind of the sales and investments in that space that you just can't have through a reseller agreement,\" said Brad Anderson, senior vice president of Dell's Enterprise Product Group.\n\nThis purchase is also in line with Dell's overall thrust to diversify its offerings beyond PC sales, which account for about half of its revenue, and into data center and cloud computing services for enterprise customers. Competitors in this area, like Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Oracle, have been able to tap into this market for new sources of growth.\n\nThis isn't the first time Dell has made a big purchase in information storage. In 2007, the company purchased storage provider EqualLogic for $1.4 billion. Last month, Dell acquired Ocarina Networks, a company that uses compression and de-duplication technologies to optimize storage. Dell's enterprise ambitions were also seen in its purchase in 2009 of Perot Systems, an IT services provider.\n\nIt's a smart move for Dell to pursue this new market, but the company will have to act quickly in order to catch up to its rivals. During the call, Dell said it was keeping \"an eye out\" for future acquisition opportunities in the storage market, particularly intelligent data management companies."
