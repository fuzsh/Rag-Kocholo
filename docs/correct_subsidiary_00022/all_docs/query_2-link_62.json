By eliminating complex tasks and enabling fast and flexible storage provisioning, these solutions dramatically reduce the costs of storage acquisition and ongoing operations.\n\nPS Series Storage SANs provide a peer storage architecture comprised of one or more independent arrays. Each array contains its own controllers, cache, storage, and interface ports. Grouped together they can create one or more single instance storage pools that are based on the IETF iSCSI standard. The capabilities of the PS Series solution are provided through a unique set of software and hardware capabilities that, when used cooperatively, can provide a full featured SAN solution. The following sections provide additional insight into specifications and functions of PS Series arrays.\n\nThe Dell EqualLogic PS100E array is ideal for virtualization and business applications where capacity, performance and low cost are all equally important. The PS100E, ideal for small-to-medium iSCSI protocols, provides outstanding value with a low TCO, improved chassis design, more memory, advanced data protection and a high performance option. The series is built on advanced peer storage architecture and features perpetual self-optimization with automated load balancing across disks, RAID sets, connections cache and controllers. Whether you need to improve productivity, performance and capacity or streamline your IT infrastructure with unified block and file storage, the Dell EqualLogic PS100E delivers powerful, intelligent and simplified management with enterprise scalability — and without the need for fork-lift upgrades. Enhance the value of your small data center or remote office and meet constantly changing workloads with the Dell EqualLogic PS100E storage array. EqualLogic makes data storage systems that radically simplify the way mid-size and large businesses store and protect information. EqualLogic’s award-winning PS Series storage area network (SAN) solution provides sophisticated management capabilities that reduce the time and money IT staff spend on storage.\n\nDell EqualLogic PS100E Controller Redundancy\n\nThe EqualLogic PS100E can be configured with either a single controller, or dual redundant controllers. The single controller configuration will provide the same level of I/O performance as a dual controller configuration. The dual controller configuration provides for redundancy. Redundant controllers will prevent volume connections between hosts and SAN from being dropped in the event of an active controller failure.\n\nThe Active Controller is the controller which is processing all disk and network I/O operations for the array. A second controller in dual controller configurations will always be in a “passive” operating mode. In this mode, the secondary controller will exhibit the following characteristics:\n\nEach of its Ethernet ports are electrically inactive (active lights are off)\n\nThe passive controller cache mirrors the cache of the active controller\n\nDell EqualLogic PS100E Controller Failover\n\nTo support redundant controller fail over, each Ethernet port on the active controller that is connected to the EqualLogic PS100E SAN must have its corresponding port on the passive controller also connected to the same SAN network. In the event of a controller failure, the passive controller will immediately activate and continue to process all data requests to the array. The following changes occur during fail over:\n\nThe backup controller automatically enables each of the corresponding Ethernet ports that were enabled on the failed primary controller\n\nThe IP addresses that were assigned to each of the failed controller Ethernet ports are reassigned to the corresponding ports on the second controller\n\nA link failure on one or more of the Ethernet ports on the active controller does not constitute a controller failure. For this reason, it is important to ensure that ports from each controller are connected to at least two different switches. This will prevent a switch failure from also disabling all paths between a host and its connected volumes.\n\nDell EqualLogic PS100E Data Services\n\n[twocol_one]\n\nAuto-Replication\n\nAutomatic Load Balancing\n\nAuto-Snapshot Manager\n\nAuto-Stat Disk Monitoring System\n\nVolume Consistency Sets\n\nMulti-Path I/O\n\nPS Group Manager\n\nPooled and Tiered Storage\n\nRAID Load Balancing\n\n[/twocol_one] [twocol_one_last]\n\nSnapshot and Auto-Replication Scheduler\n\nE-mail Home\n\nRoles-based Administration\n\nStorage Virtualization\n\nThin Provisioning\n\nVolume Cloning\n\nVolume Management\n\nVolume Snapshot\n\n[/twocol_one_last]"
