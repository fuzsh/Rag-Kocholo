        "text": "Managing Strategy\n\nSection 1\n\nDell\n\nDell is a multinational company that makes, sells and supports computer based products and services as a merchant. Founded in 1984, the company has come a long way and is one of the biggest computer suppliers in the world. The company has made a total of 10 acquisitions and 2 divestures in the time period 2002-2010. Of the ten acquisitions, the most notable ones are the Alienware, ASAP, EqualLogic and Perot Systems.\n\nThe Alienware deal, 2006 enabled dell to venture into the high performance gaming computers industry. The company produced high performance computer products to be used for gaming and other high performance tasks. After the deal, the company was added as a subsidiary and has been functioning as a separate company ever since.\n\nMoreover Alienware benefited from this deal as it could then access the Dell’s huge supplier network and enjoy on the massive economies of scale. There were some problems that came with the deal. One of them was that after some time after the deal went through, Dell fired off a number of employees from the Alienware in the name of cost restructuring (CALLAHAM, John, 2009).\n\nASAP was a leading software solution company and thus the deal enabled Dell to reach as a leading supplier of commercial technology and services. Moreover this also enabled Dell to increase its grip on the software market and thus to offer customized software solutions bundled with its existing hardware portfolio. The deal also helped Dell to merge the existing software business with ASAP and helped it to reinvent and simplify the final solution for the customers. ASP employed 600 employees which were retained by Dell. The deal helped dell solidify its hold in the software market and thus Dell emerged as a big player and also enabled it to change its image to a solution provider. The EqualLogic was a data storage solutions provider firm. Dell acquired this firm in 2007 and thus it enabled it to increase its market share in the rapidly growing internet storage market.\n\nMoreover as cloud computing was gaining momentum back then, this deal was an excellent choice on part of Dell to enter into online storage market (RILEY, Duncan, 2007). Dell retained most of the EqualLogic’s service and support staff as well as channel partners. This increased the overall staff motivation within the EqualLogic and thus helped to allay the fears of the employees as during acquisitions, layoffs are a regular feature. The cultural factor did not play its part in this deal as both of these companies had a similar culture (RAFFO, dave, 2007).\n\nParot System was a technology based firm which offered technology services in a range of sectors, from health care to government, as well as software and consulting. Dell acquired Parot System for $3.9 Billion. The deal enabled Dell to offer broader range of IT services, and a built-in market for its hardware among Perot Systems’ existing customers. Perot Systems had a strong footprint in the health care and government, which provided 48 percent and 25 percent of its revenues, with the remainder in the enterprise sector.\n\nThe deal also helped Dell to represent a $16 Billion company with $8 Billion on technology services. It also had a long term impact and thus so in the short run the revenue’s for Dell decreased (GAYLORD, Chris, 2009).\n\nBy acquiring different strategic companies, Dell managed to increase its product diversification and also its market reach. Moreover these acquisitions helped the company to enter into new markets and thus to overcome the patents and license barriers which stop new entrants into entering an existing market.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft is the world leader in computer software products. The company was founded in 1975 and since then it has taken the computer world by storm. The company has been aggressive in its acquisition spree and thus has taken a lot of companies during the period 2002-2009. The acquisitions were very much helpful for the company as they helped it to maintain a certain level of competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover such acquisitions helped the company to acquire ready made products which could be marketed through the company’s existing marketing and distribution functions.\n\nApart from this such acquisitions helped the company to acquire new technologies from those companies. This proved to be a beneficial form of investment for the company both in terms of monetary and non monetary forms. The company’s acquirement of e-Business developer firm Navision enabled Microsoft to enter into the small and medium business market for ERP systems which was previously being served by SAP AG and Oracle Corp (MICROSOFT, 2002). Other than this, such a deal helped the company to directly enter into the ERP market without any sort of time delay.\n\nMicrosoft’s acquisition of GeCad software in 2003 and GIANT Company in 2004 enabled the company to enter into the antivirus and security related products market. Before such a deal the company was lagging behind in this category (LEMOS, Robert, 2003). The deal enabled it to offer these products and compete against the current players of the antivirus market. The acquirement of aQuantive, 2007 for $6 Billion enabled Microsoft to have a company specialized in advertising and thus to add more muscle to its advertising strategies. The notable acquisitions were successful in a sense that Microsoft was able to integrate the knowledge capital from the individual companies to its own pool and also to transfer the technologies that these companies had developed. The eventual result was Microsoft offering new products or services under its own brand and was thus able to successfully increase its market reach. The company added over 8500 workforce due to these acquisitions. These employees had to learn the Microsoft way of doing business and eventually proved to be an asset for the organization.\n\nMoreover as most of the companies acquired by Microsoft were much smaller in size as compared to the parent company, Microsoft was in a commanding position to apply its culture and impose its policies and thus was able to mould those companies to work in its favor. Apart from that some of the acquisitions like NAVISION were only technology based transfers and did not involve total employee transfer to Microsoft.\n\nThe company also divested many of its assets and companies in order to reduce losses and increase revenues. Expedia and DreamWorks Interactive and MSN Money Central are the notable names which were divested by Microsoft. These divestments also enabled Microsoft to get rid of loss bearing companies and thus to focus on new opportunities that were coming in its way.\n\nSection 2\n\nNokia\n\nNokia is a Finland based company which makes mobile devices and its related products. The company is the largest manufacturer of mobile phone. The company has been active in forming strategic alliances and joint ventures with different companies which enabled it to enter into new markets and also to expand its current product range. Some of the notable strategic partnerships and joint ventures that Nokia has entered into during the time period 2002-2010 are Nokia-Siemens Networks (Joint Venture), Nokia – New Alliance (Joint Venture), Nokia – Intel (Strategic Partnership), Nokia – Alpine Electronics (Strategic Partnership), Nokia – France Telecom (Strategic Partnership) and Nokia – Skype (Strategic Partnership).\n\nNokia entered into a strategic alliance with France telecom in 2004. The objective of this alliance was to jointly develop rich media solutions on mobile terminals encompassing rich media hardware, services, applications and contents by using various standards technologies. Nokia had a technical edge and thus a large in house setup to develop such media solutions. On the other hand France telecom had the large user base and the distribution system through which it could push the media solutions to its customers. Thus together it was a win-win situation for both the parties. The deal proved successful and Nokia was able to enter a new market and thus got hold of valuable experience (NOKIA, 2004).\n\nNokia entered into a joint venture agreement in 2006 with Siemens. The new company Nokia Siemens Networks was made to offer telecommunications equipments in different parts of the world. By 2010 it was one of the largest telecommunications equipment suppliers in the world. The joint venture enabled Nokia and Siemens to both jointly use their technical expertise to offer and supply equipments to major telecom networks. This was a very successfully joint venture for both the companies and thus proved to be an excellent example of synergy and team effort.\n\nNokia also entered into a strategic alliance with Intel in 2009. This alliance would enable both the companies to develop mobile computing devices and chipset architectures which will combine the performance of powerful computers with high-bandwidth mobile broadband communications and ubiquitous Internet connectivity. This partnership was called a long term agreement as both of these companies shared the common belief and thus wanted to take this shared vision into the future. This partnership is expected to bring several innovations and technological advancements into the arena. Nokia being an expert in mobile technology and Intel being a chipset wizard would prove to be a good combination.\n\nNokia also entered into a joint venture agreement in 2009 with New Alliance Company. New Alliance was a China bases investment company. The 50-50 joint venture was expected to aim at the delivery of a series of mobile services in China as well as providing support for the developer ecosystem. China being a large market for Nokia and thus in order to gain entrance into China, Nokia needed such a venture to secure its entrance. Moreover Nokia would be able to use the local knowledge from the New Alliance to its own use and also to develop localized software solutions to capture the interests of the local market.\n\nPepsi\n\nPepsiCo is a Fortune 500, American Multinational Corporation. The company manufactures and markets a wide variety of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, as well as salty, sweet and grain-based snacks, and other foods. During the time period 2002-2010, the company ventured into a number of strategic alliances and joint ventures. The most notable ones include Pepsi – Starbucks, Pepsi – Unilever and Pepsi- Almarai.\n\nPepsi entered into a strategic alliance with Starbucks in 2002 in the name of North America Coffee Partnership (NACP). This deal enabled Pepsi to offer joint products along with Starbucks that would suite both the brands. They launched a number of brands under this partnership agreement. Some of them include Starbucks Double Shot, Frappucino. This strategic alliance enabled Pepsi to come into the coffee and ready to drink market. Starbucks was already a famous name in the coffee circles and the brand had a high repute for offering good quality coffee and its related drinks. Thus this partnership enabled both the companies to jointly develop new products which would benefit both the companies.\n\nStrategic partnerships help both the companies to use the technical expertise and market experience of the other partner. In this case Pepsi has a vast experience and technical expertise in the bottling line. On the other hand Starbucks had a vast experience in making coffee based drinks. Thus a partnership between these two enabled them to make coffee drinks they could sell. The partnership proved to be highly successful and even after its start in 2002 the partnership is going strong with new products being launched under the umbrella.\n\nIn 2003 Pepsi entered into a joint venture with Unilever. Under this agreement, Pepsi would market and distribute Unilever’s range of Lipton ready to drink teas (BUSINESS EDITORS, 2003). The 50-50 joint venture – Pepsi Lipton International will enable both of the manufacturers to use each other expertise in their respective areas to reach a common goal. The joint venture enabled Pepsi to venture into the healthy drinks category which it was trying to enter.\n\nAs the worldwide cola drinks had been receiving a negative press due to health concerns, coming into a healthy drinks market was a right step for Pepsi. The joint venture proved to be a success as Pepsi successfully positioned itself from the previous carbonated drinks manufacturer to a healthy drinks manufacturer. As both of these companies had joined together for a common goal, they were able to push that through and thus made it a success.\n\nPepsi entered into a joint venture agreement in 2009 with Almarai, the gulf’s largest dairy company by market value. Under the agreement both these companies would invest in dairy and juice processors in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The deal helped Pepsi to benefit from the Almarai’s vast experience in dairy food products. Moreover Almarai’s dairy and non-carbonated fruit juice product line proved to be a compelling complement to Pepsico’s current product lines.\n\nOn the other hand, Almarai benefited from the Pepsico’s distribution channel and market insights in countries outside the Gulf area. The joint venture enabled Pepsi to offer more health based drinks and thus could further increase its healthy drinks portfolio. The worldwide move towards a more healthy diet also compelled Pepsi to take such a decision. The joint venture is running well with it acquiring more companies and thus further increasing its product range.\n\nSection 3\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe key threat currently facing Microsoft is “Cloud Computing”. Cloud computing is an internet based computing whereby shared resources are provided on the internet on demand. This is a paradigm shift and is the way where things would move on in the near future. Any company which is in a business related to the internet has to adopt the cloud computing factor in its strategic planning. Microsoft currently has more than 90% in the operating system market. Its flagship Windows product sells like hot cakes and thus is generic name for operating system.\n\nThe Windows operating system is totally reliant on locally based resources. This means that hard disk, graphic card, RAM attain central importance in Windows and thus the overall experience varies greatly if one of these things are changed. Even in its recent most versions (Windows 7), Microsoft is still focusing towards the local desktop resources. It is high time that Microsoft needs to shift its focus from the local desktop to the cloud computing concept. Microsoft needs to change its philosophy and needs to shift in time as the competitors have aimed their guns and are ready to fire. Google is all set to launch its GDrive product (SMITH, David, 2009). The product will enable anyone to make a free account and thus save all of his/her data online which could be accessed anywhere in the world.\n\nMoreover Google is in the process of making its own operating system known as Chrome OS. This operating system would be fully built on the principles of cloud computing. This means that it could be used on minimum resources and the client pc would only need to have the bare minimum specification in order to just connect the computer to the internet (KELLNER, Mark A., 2009).\n\nSuch developments pose a direct threat to the future of Windows. The entire current Windows concept is fading away and if proper measures are not taken Windows will become a small thing in the near future.\n\nThe recommended strategy for Microsoft is to modify its Windows operating system platform to include the cloud computing element. This could be done by making separate editions of Windows. One edition could be fully focused towards the cloud computing concept and thus would be a scaled down version of windows with bare minimum applications. All the focus of that edition would be towards internet where one could access all the relevant applications and storage space.\n\nThe other edition could be the normal Windows that is currently in use. Moreover these two editions would clearly enable Microsoft to directly enter a new market while keeping its old trusted user base in place. As Microsoft cannot directly shift its focus towards the cloud computing thus these two editions would clearly help Microsoft to make its mark and to thwart the competitors to play on its turf. Moreover by offering a separate edition focused towards cloud computing, Microsoft can increase the product life cycle of Windows and thus could eventually take it into the next horizon.\n\nDell\n\nThe key threat currently faced by Dell is “the reduced price difference among competing brands”. As the prices of computers are going down with each passing day, the price difference between the competing brands is getting smaller. Dell’s model of direct selling attracts customers because it saves cost. Since other companies are able to offer computers at low costs, this could threaten the Dell’s low cost user base (KRANGEL, Eric, 2009).\n\nWith almost identical prices, price difference is no longer an issue for a customer. They might choose other brands instead of waiting for Dell’s customized computers. Moreover with the overall growth rate in the computer industry slowing down plus the overall price increase in computer related parts, Dell would have to work in both managing increasing costs and differentiating itself from the competition.\n\nOther than this, with a lot of low cost pc manufacturers coming into the arena and offering the same kind of hardware and software, Dell is having a hard time in managing these challenges. These challenges are threatening to grab the market share from Dell and also putting more pressure on Dell to be able to differentiate and come up with innovative solution to these problems.\n\nThe recommended strategy for Dell is to put emphases on its brand. This means that it should come up with aggressive marketing campaigns in which the main objective is to differentiate its brand from the rest. These campaigns should be high budgeted so that they could make their mark and reach their objective. These campaigns should inspire the consumers to know that when they buy a Dell it automatically means they will be getting the highest possible customer service and the highest quality product that the market can offer. Moreover these campaigns could also focus on the innovation factor and how Dell uses innovative techniques and processes to build the state of the art machine.\n\nMoreover as the world is getting more informed about the e-waste and its consequences, Dell could position itself to be an environment friendly company and thus include this segment in the marketing campaigns. Other than this it could offer a buy back program which could enable a customer to send its computer back to dell after some years so that Dell could recycle it and thus save the environment. These kinds of options will enable Dell to clearly distinguish itself from the rest of the competition and thus would help the company to compete on a non price competition basis. Other than this Dell should increase its research and development budget. This would enable the company to come up with innovative technologies and original ideas which could in turn help the company to offer something extra and beyond the normal market offerings.\n\nList of References\n\nBUSINESS EDITORS. 2003.
