        "text": "RAID 4 utilizes a single disk for redundancy, while RAID 5 and RAID 6 distribute redundancy across all drives in the RAID. It offers high read performance, as data can be read from multiple disks simultaneously, and all parity information is centralized on a single disk, making it easier to manage.\n\nHowever, RAID 4 has limitations: the parity disk can become a bottleneck during write operations, as it needs to be updated each time data is written, and, most importantly, RAID 4 can only tolerate one disk failure.\n\nRAID 4 is very rare these days. Today, RAID 5 is generally chosen over RAID 4 because RAID 5 distributes parity across all disks, avoiding the write bottleneck of a dedicated parity disk and offering better storage efficiency and fault tolerance. This results in improved overall performance and reliability compared to RAID 4.\n\nThe photographer’s data was stored on four 20TB Toshiba SATA drives, configured in a soft RAID 4 with one drive parity running on a Mac operating system. The system, housed in an 8-bay unit, originally used only four of the bays.\n\nThe issue arose when the photographer attempted to add four new drives to create a second volume. Unfortunately, during this process, two drives from the original volume were accidentally removed and incorporated into the new configuration. This left the original volume with a compromised RAID configuration, as only the parity drive and one other drive remained untouched.\n\nAdditionally, many of the files were compressed JPEGs, which complicated the RAID reconstruction. The RAID 4 configuration, though rare nowadays due to RAID 5’s increased redundancy and similar capacity, added to the complexity.\n\nFaced with this complex scenario, DriveSavers data recovery engineers worked together to develop a custom recovery solution.\n\nData recovery starts by making a clone of each drive involved in the recovery process and a second clone as a backup so all data is preserved and backed up in the original failed state. Once these steps were complete, the engineers used advanced data recovery techniques to extract the needed data."
