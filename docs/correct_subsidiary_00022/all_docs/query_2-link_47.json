        "text": "Personally I’ve had terrible support from EMC, great support from Nimble, and no experience with Pure. EMC is more complicated in that it has more features that may or not be used. Nimble is very simple, integrates well with VMware (if you’re a VMware shop), and has great analytics and support. It may also come down to your size. If you’re a very large company then you may need a Dell/EMC to scale. In that scenario you would compare it to HPE 3PAR instead of Nimble (owned by HPE).\n\nHi Richard,\n\nI have no experience with Nimble or Pure so I cannot provide any comparison but I’ve been using Dell SANs for nearly a decade.\n\nMost of the Dell SANs I’ve worked with have been the MD3xxxi variety. Those are reliable, cheap SANs if you just need a basic iSCSI box sharing a limited number of dedicated LUNs. They aren’t very flexible and certainly have their quirks but if you have Dell Pro Support 24x7x4hr then knowledgeable help is only a phone call away.\n\nI also used an Equal Logic SAN that a former employer purchased shortly after Dell acquired the company. Much more flexible, particularly when expanding, than the MD series. Again the support was quite good. I’m sure the EQL support would be a bit different now since at that time it was only supported by the team that Dell acquired with the company. Again, Pro Support is essential when dealing with Dell.\n\nGood luck. Be sure to post back and let us all know what you decide on.\n\nEric Q.\n\nWhich product lines are you evaluating? HPE Nimble has 3, though they’re basically all the same in terms of operation (main difference is speed and primary use case). Pure has 1 or 2 main lines for block storage. Dell EMC has something like at least 5, and probably closer to 10 completely products that can be called SAN.\n\nBased on what you’re looking at from HPE Nimble and Pure, stay away from Dell MD series and PS (EqualLogic) series.\n\nI own 3 Nimble units, two new ones and an older one that is 3 years old. Really no complaints from performance, ease of use, use case, or support standpoint. It is super hard to find any really negative experience with them.\n\nHPE Nimble Storage hands down wins support and probably availability. The Nimble team has improved the HA across the installed base from 5 nines to greater 6 nines based on finding and resolving issues before they become problems. That’s the heart of InfoSight. A few numbers that I think are impressive:\n\n86% of issues are opened, resolved, and closed before the customer is aware of it.\n\nWith InfoSight and Nimble cross-stack analytics, over 50% of the problems that are diagnosed aren’t a storage problem but because we are gathering lots of analytics from other parts of the infrastructure, InfoSight helps to find and resolve those issues too.\n\nWhen you do have a support call, the call is with an L3 engineer who already has a pretty good idea of what is going on with your system. You don’t have to call a response center and work through L1 and L2 engineers. And of those calls that are with an L3 (meaning the 16% that aren’t opened, resolved, and closed), the average time to resolve is about 46 minutes.\n\nI’ve been on an HPE InfoSight blogging kick lately. You can see all of our InfoSight-related posts on my blog with this link . I’ve posted a few demos in those more recent posts if you like checking out demos (they’re all fairly short). The post I’d recommend you listen to is the one that has a podcast with the “inventor” of InfoSight and it’s predictive analytics. We talked about the AI driven management that is new and the podcast does a good job talking about what sets InfoSight apart.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.\n\nI will add some more of my Nimble experience. They will open a case when a volume hits a warning level on capacity…I think that gooses their case resolution statistics. If there is anything going on with your array that would be a problem if you try to upgrade, they block it. This is a good thing. My most recent case was when my Hyper-V cluster went offline, and I thought maybe it was the array as it threw an error around the same time. Turns out that the error was just in the UI process, and that the issue was diagnosed by Nimble as being caused by another member of my team doing something stupid in SCVMM that they didn’t tell me about. The Nimble team diagnosed it. They seem really good at looking at the entire ecosystem, and will help you find issues in the network and host side of things. Even though the problem wasn’t actually in the storage array, they never tried to blame another vendor for the issue.\n\nWhat’s your timeline? For Dell I suspect some rationalization and new generations will get announced at the upcoming Dell Technology World. While I don’t expect them to cease being Baskin robins swim lanes might become clearer.\n\nHPE Nimble beyond being well liked as one of the most adopted vvols implementations.\n\nPure just launched vvols. I generally see it competitively price/positioned against 3PAR not Nimble and used by FC shops. They don’t offer hybrid or anything like Nimble secondary flash for a backup target so you would need to pair them with secondary storage. (Then again A certain large VAR is pitching pure everywhere this quarter due to channel spiffs so that may explain it).\n\nDo you have any capacity, performance, server, app stack, fabric hypervisor information about what this is being used for/with?\n\nThis is kind of like telling a meat eater that they should only eat ground beef. If you want chicken or steak, why would you say “only eat ground beef”. Well, that’s a very simplistic analogy that breaks down pretty fast but saying ditch disk arrays for software-based storage is too. Ditching a SAN-based array is a good option for some but not for all. There are use cases where they each make sense. There are use cases where there is overlap and pick what you are most comfortable with makes the most sense. And I can trot out hundreds of customers who would counter “it’s a liability these days”.\n\nAnd I feel pretty confident in saying this because we don’t just have disk arrays but as you pointed out HPE VSA, hyper-converged (HPE SimpliVity), and lots of array-based options. We even have VMware vSAN ready nodes. I’m a big fan of software-defined storage but its a bit premature to ditch everything else.\n\nI feel like making a joke about FiCON here but It’s too easy, and it would (point out that maybe I think everything is a nail) and negate a very valid point about shifts in the market.\n\nThere are still legitimate uses for even mainframes today and as a market, the revenue for mainframes isn’t really going up or down.\n\nAs it stands now Enterprise external storage is still viewed as “the safe choice” and is still most of the market.\n\nIDC’s tracking External storage in Q4 last year showed it still a huge part of the market grew only 1.8% (HPE being one of the few gaining market share to note), while server-based storage (which feeds SDS among other things) grew 23.8% and is ~2X that of the external enterprise storage market. HCI (one subset of that market) is growing 100% YoY.\n\nIt is often the guys that the guys who market the hardest, and focus on the superiority of one design over another (Scale Out over Scale up) or one feature (NAS services), or a magic IO layout or movement path (That will eventually have it’s advantage become a disadvantage as hardware changes and need to be refactored) only have one product. It’s why mature storage players have multiple options (hell even Pure has the NAS blade thingy now).\n\nI view SDS options considered because of the same reasons people bought one array over another.\n\nAgility (Flexibility and speed of deployment vs. needing a special install team and hardware). I can move some servers around or rack/stack them with standard opts teams. The last time I deployed a VSP it took 2 weeks and involved 6 people (that said, HPE has proved their OEM versions are bullet and explosion proof).\n\nCost (Flexibility in the supply chain, and the ability to adopt the newest drives, controllers, interconnects and IO devices helps control capital costs). Arrays tend to be a bit slower than the servers on adopting new devices and capabilities (Be it 100Gbps NIC’s, RDMA, NVMe etc) as they have longer engineering and validation cycles. (That said I hear the 3PAR ASIC was forward designed for NVMeOF).\n\nRisk mitigation. SDS options can generally bring things like active/active controllers and stretched clusters into markets that wouldn’t have been able to consume them. Shifting to HCI, in general, reduces the number of teams and “things” involved in provisioning and reduces options for errors from the Human side."
