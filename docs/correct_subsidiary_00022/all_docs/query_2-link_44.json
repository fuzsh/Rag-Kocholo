Anybody remember Spinnaker? Dell has made very rapid progress with EqualLogic and now Netapp is desperate to find ways to compete.\n\nBut I should really thank Alex for reminding me to post about our partnership with Exagrid for de-duplication functionality. Exagrid has excellent technology and they are fast gaining recognition and traction with their products – including their ExaGrid iSCSI De-duplication Gateway™."
