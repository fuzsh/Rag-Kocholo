        "text": "Simple, Affordable, Automated Disaster Recovery\n\nNew Solutions for Automated Site Recovery from Dell and VMware: The virtual infrastructure enabled by Dell EqualLogic and VMware VI3 technologies now automate disaster recovery planning and execution by natively integrating the PS Series Auto-Replication feature directly into VMware's Site Recovery Manager software.\n\nVMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) is a new product that is tightly integrated with Dell EqualLogic PS Series to offer centralized disaster recovery management, automation, and testing for the entire virtualized datacenter. Using the PS Series' native Auto-Replication feature integrated directly into Site Recovery Manager using specialized storage adapter software.\n\nDell EqualLogic for Cost-Effective SRM Deployments: Site Recovery Manager leverages SAN-based replication to move virtual machines and their datasets between the production and disaster recovery sites. In traditional SAN environments, the cost and complexity of SAN-based replication is cost and resource prohibitive for many businesses. PS Series includes a complete suite of data protection tools for simplified protection of the virtual datacenter and an affordable SRM deployment. With the PS Series, Auto-Replication between data centers can be easily implemented without requiring the purchase of additional software licenses or complex configurations. Auto-Replication includes flexible scheduling capabilities to save time and network bandwidth.\n\nAutomated Site Recovery over Existing WAN Infrastructure: SRM enables non-disruptive, automated testing of recovery plans and automates the recovery process, while the PS Series provides affordable and easy-to-configure replication over any distance using existing IP networks. iSCSI connectivity allows organizations to leverage their existing Ethernet infrastructure for disaster recovery instead of a complicated and expensive Fibre Channel network.\n\nVMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) is integrated with VMware Infrastructure 3, VMware VirtualCenter, and PS Series Auto-Replication software from Dell. It guides users through the process of setting up and configuring recovery plans for their virtualized IT environment. At the time of failover, SRM automatically runs the recovery plan- starting virtual machines in the proper order with updated networking configurations. Testing disaster recovery plans is also made easy by executing the failover in an isolated test environment, then cleaning-up the environment for non- disruptive testing.\n\nAuto-Snapshot Manager and Fast-Failback Capabilities: The easy-to-use Auto-Snapshot Manager (ASM) brings Smart Copy capability to VMware deployments running windows based applications, providing consistent data copies to your disaster site during failover for additional protection. Within an intuitive, simple to use GUI, you can easily make quick snapshots, clones, and replicas of complete virtual storage volumes to ensure fast restores of applications when a site failover has been completed. Once you' re ready to failback to the production site, PS Series includes a Fast-Failback capability to save time, bandwidth and storage capacity. ASM and Fast-Failback capabilities in advanced SRM deployments enable you to protect IT assets more effectively and with greater ease."
