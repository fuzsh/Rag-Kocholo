        "text": "What does the massive acquisition of EMC by Dell mean for the IT infrastructure market? In short, not much. Let’s start by turning that question around. It is the market that is having a huge impact on EMC and Dell – and HP and IBM and NetApp for that matter.\n\nThe storage market is undergoing a major shift\n\nThe architectural landscape for storage is rapidly changing with new options that are disrupting traditional approaches.\n\nInfo-Tech Research Group has been advising on the shift in storage over the past four years\n\nA series of developments are coming together to displace the traditional disk storage array from its central and foundational role in the IT infrastructure.\n\nWhat does this mean for Dell? Dell is bucking a trend in acquiring EMC\n\nWhile other industry giants (HP, IBM, and Symantec) are moving toward breaking into smaller, more-focused pieces, Dell is going the other way.\n\nWhat does this mean for EMC? EMC products get to live on for the time being\n\nEMC was under pressure from activist investors to sell-off less productive parts of its portfolio. By selling to a privately-held company, EMC gets cover while the investors get their payday.\n\nBottom line: Disk arrays are not dead but rather the role of the disk array is changing; Dell and EMC are in survival mode"
