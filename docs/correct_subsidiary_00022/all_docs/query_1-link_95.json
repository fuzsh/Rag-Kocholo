        "text": "I remember presenting to an audience some time ago and asking the question of them of how much data they had. I was a little surprised to find two organisations had over a Petabyte and one had over two Petabytes. In the global scheme of things that may not be much but here in Ireland where the average large organisation has 20 to 40 Terabytes it was quite a revelation.\n\nWhat is not surprising is the number of organisations who use Dell Equallogic for their storage. Equallogic combines ease of deployment with simple management and all the enterprise class features that you expect from a best of breed storage solution. However a lot of organisations will not think of Equallogic when it comes to thinking about storing very large amounts of data. With the release of the PS6610 that is going to change. The base unit can store half a Petabyte and it can expand to 16 units capable of storing 8 Petabytes of data.\n\nSureSkills has a long history of delivering successful and productive solutions on Equallogic. Our team can help address your long term storage needs coupled with the I/O needs of live production systems in one solution.\n\nTo find out more about how SureSkills can support your operations contact me today. peter.trevaskis@sureskills.com"
