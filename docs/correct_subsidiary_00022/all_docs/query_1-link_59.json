        "text": "I purchased a refurbished EqualLogic PS6000XVS and tried to obtain some configuration documents from the Dell website, that is when I discovered you could not access those without an account, I was able to find what I needed on the open web so all was good. But now I wanted to download the VMware MEM drivers for the unit (supposed to give better performance). Again I ran into the restrictions on the Dell site, so I tried to obtain a login and was refused by Dell because there is no active support contract on the unit.\n\nI can understand Dell’s logic in restricting access to certain things (firmware, support), similar to how HP does it, but if you can’t even download basic drivers and view documentation for things, what happens when an original owner needs to obtain this information after the support agreement expires?\n\nIs anyone aware of user groups or other sites where this information is still exchanged on older equipment?\n\nHello Bonder,\n\nAs you have found, when your EqualLogic is out of warranty you lose access to all technical documents, install guides, drivers, & firmware. The only way to gain access to that again is if the system still can be put back under a warranty contract again. If even if the original owner that registered the PS6000XVS didn’t have an active warranty on the system they would not be able to get the drivers, updates or documentation.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions.\n\nI really feel this is a horrible position for a company to take on support. If you bought a TV, its warranty expired then you required the users manual for it. You would be livid if the manufacturer said sorry, you can’t have a copy because you don’t have any warranty left. Or lets say you bought a Dell PC a few years ago, needed to re-install Windows on it and needed a driver. If Dell told you, sorry the warranty expired so you can’t have access to download drivers there would be an outcry.\n\nAgain like I said in my original post, all I really wanted was the VMware drivers. I found an older version online, but I can’t even open the compatibility document for the drivers because it is behind the Dell paywall.\n\nAt least with my HP Storage I can see what is available and view documents related to it regardless of if I am logged in or not.\n\nPeople don’t find that acceptable at the consumer level, it should definitely not be tolerated at the Enterprise level.\n\nIf I call RCA and ask for a manual on a 15 year old TV that I bought from someone else I would actually expect them to not waste time trying to get me one. This example is actually quite unreasnable. If I bought the TV (as is) withotu a manual why would I expect RCA to provide one?\n\nI’ve got an old OS-2 box in the DC, and you know what. If It dies, I’m screwed because I can’t expect IBM to provide me a driver on it. It’s funny you mention drivers, because Dell and OEMs in many cases have to…\n\nPay the Hardware vendors for continued development and access to said driver.\n\nSometimes pay licensing on a per download, or user basis.\n\nTo make sure they can afford to keep doing this they restrict access only to paying customers. It wouldn’t shock me at all if MEM involves non-Dell IP and they may not be allowed to redestribute it freely. I will point out that custom PSP’s (like MEM) while handy, are not required to connect to vSphere.\n\nThis is kinda also a terrible example. HPE will not give me driver or firmware for a server that is out of support. At least Dell will let me download PERC firmware on a incredibly out of support R720 in my lab.\n\nAhhh, something I can be useful on here! The vSphere Storage VCG includes MEM and Equallogic firmware version numbers. (look for PSP Routed version #).\n\nhttps://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/detail.php?deviceCategory=san&productid=1383&releaseid=369&deviceCategory=san&details=1&partner=32&releases=369&isSVA=0&page=1&display_interval=10&sortColumn=Partner&sortOrder=Asc\n\nI’d like to remind people that used storage arrays are in general a terrible idea to purchase. Legally in many cases you are not entitled to the license for basic features (like using ANY protocal on a VNX or a Netapp)."
