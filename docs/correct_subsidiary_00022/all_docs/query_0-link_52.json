        "text": "Dell and EMC have officially divorced. But everyone knew they would.\n\nOn Monday, Dell revealed that after ten years of reselling EMC storage hardware, it has parted ways with the Massachusetts-based IT giant. The announcement came a full two years before the end of the companies' latest pact -- but it was still entirely expected.\n\nAfter acquiring multiple storage vendors over the last few years -- including EqualLogic in 2007 and Compellent earlier this year -- Dell now has its own stable of storage hardware, and though it continued to sell EMC kit with the EMC name it, even EMC acknowledged that the end was near.\n\n\"This has been in the works ever since Dell acquired EqualLogic way back when,\" said Jerome Wendt, an analyst with research outfit DCIG, \"and when it acquired Compellent, that was the nail in the coffin.\"\n\nDell is responding to the inexorable rise of server virtualization. As the world's data center move their application to virtual servers, reducing their need for good old fashioned physical servers, Dell's traditional business takes a hit. But as the need for physical servers drops, the need for storage only rises. Typically, companies will support their virtualized servers storage arrays that run alongside their physical servers.\n\n\"As servers get virtualized, there goes Dell's profit margin. That's just money going up in smoke. But the amount of storage is going up because most people are putting their virtualized servers on these external storage arrays,\" said Wendt. \"And that's where all the profit margin in.\" Dell is moving to where the profits are. And it doesn't want EMC taking a slice of the pie.\n\nDell and EMC declined to comment. But as far back as January 2010, EMC does publicly discussing its relationship with Dell as \"mainly competitive.\"\n\nIn recent years, HP -- Dell's primary rival -- has built up its own storage business in similar fashion, and though it continues to \"OEM\" storage hardware from Hitachi Data Systems (HDS), HP storage senior vice president and general manager David Scott says this is rather different from Dell's (ex-)relationship with EMC. \"A couple of our product lines are based on technology we OEM rather than resell. We use our brand, rather than theirs,\" Scott told Wired. \"Our relationship with Hitachi is very strong.\"\n\nDell actually OEMed some EMC kits as well. But yesterday, it put an end to that too.\n\nThe Metaverse Was Supposed to Be Your New Office. You’re Still on Zoom\n\nTech founders painted a vision of employees clocking into virtual workplaces. But the adoption of VR at work has been slow.\n\nThe Hidden Ties Between Google and Amazon’s Project Nimbus and Israel's Military\n\nA WIRED investigation found public statements from officials detail a much closer link between Project Nimbus and Israel Defense Forces than previously reported.\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nTiny Texas Village Seeks Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Miner to Pave Potholes, Scare Dogs Away\n\nIn a roundabout bid to win public opinion (and a juicy tax abatement,) Riot Platforms is preparing for its prized bitcoin mine to be annexed by a minuscule village in rural Texas.\n\nAmazon Ramps Up Security to Head Off Project Nimbus Protests\n\nFormer Big Tech workers intended to disrupt Wednesday’s AWS Summit in New York to protest the company’s $1.2 billion contract with Israel.\n\nElon Musk Says He’s Moving X and SpaceX Headquarters to Texas\n\nThe tech mogul cited California’s new transgender rights law as “the final straw” for moving out of the state.\n\nCraig Wright Faces Perjury Investigation Over Claims He Created Bitcoin\n\nBy order of a UK judge, Craig Wright can no longer claim he is the creator of bitcoin and now faces the prospect of criminal charges.\n\nActivists Disrupt Amazon Conference Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n\nMembers of the activist group No Tech for Apartheid interrupted a senior Amazon executive's speech at a conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday over the company's Project Nimbus cloud contract."
