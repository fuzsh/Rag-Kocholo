        "text": "Description\n\nAn intuitive management interface allows System Administrators to easily manage the Dell EqualLogic PS6500e Storage Array. It offers seamless, and simplified automation with fault tolerance and the ability to be rapidly deployed. The chassis has a high-degree of fault tolerance with redundant, hot swap components combined with dual controllers, triple fan arrays, triple redundant power supplies, and disk drives with hot spares. Storage controllers also feature battery-backed write-back cache mirrored across controllers for even greater data protection. HP says this system is very easy to set up and can be integrated with your network, straight out of the box in about an hour.\n\nStorage\n\nThe chassis can support from 24TB minimum to 144TB maximum. With SATA drives you can install 48 1TB or 2TB drives, or using NL-SATA or NL-SATA Self Encrypting Drives up to 3TB. This system is an excellent addition to datacenters and large enterprises that require a high degree of fault tolerance and the ability to quickly replace redundant, hot-swap components. The HD controllers feature battery-backed, write-backed cache that is mirrored across the controllers for additional fault resiliency.\n\nA full array of Dell PS6500E storage enclosures can scale up to 1.5PB under a single management interface SAN group. RAID 5, 6, 10 and 50 are supported for resiliency and redundancy and the virtualized architecture means System Administrators only buy what they need to prevent over-provisioning and underutilization.\n\nManagement\n\nThe system comes with support software including the PS Group Manager that, as the name suggests, can support multiple groups of chassis. The system also features individual drive slot power control so youâ€™re not wasting money powering an empty slot. The system also sports a number of automation features and can automatically build RAID sets and system health checks. Each of the two network controllers also features quad port 1GbE.\n\nSummary\n\nThe EqualLogic family, including the Dell EqualLogic PS6500e Storage Array, supports several unique features including load balancing, and data pooling. Load balancing distributes the data across the available storage platforms for greater system performance, while data pooling allows for tiered configurations that ensure your data can be accessed as fast as possible. The Dell EqualLogic PS6500e also supports scale-out with more performance from additional memory and controllers plus expanded capacity. The PS6500e provides excellent flexibility for your network while also lowering your total cost of ownership over the short-haul. It can also be combined with other EqualLogic PS arrays in the same SAN group with up to 16 members per group."
