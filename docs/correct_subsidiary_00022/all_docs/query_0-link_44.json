        "text": "While a student of the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nHis intuition says something that something isn’t just right about the price of personal computers.\n\nWhile looking for a competitive edge the biggest question he faced is (positioning), how do he going to compete with well-established competitors who not only have name recognition but also a network of retailers to push a product. While working on this basic concept he noticed the Best buy or Radioshack would help the shoppers find the right computers and on return for their services these middle man would get 10, 20 or 30 percent so raise prices by 10 %, 20% or 30% directly.\n\nSo He finds a solution and a greatest competitive edge that why not sell directly to consumers, so 10%, 20%, 30% less prices compared to its established competitors that mean he wanted to innovate the supply chain.\n\nHe believed he could provide customers with more powerful technology at a better value by rethinking how computers were manufactured and delivered.\n\nPursuing his interests in computers, at the age of 21 He registered his company named \"PC's Limited\".\n\nThe dorm-room headquartered company sold IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components. He then dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business. After getting $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family. In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the Turbo PC, which sold for $795.\n\nAnd He first time introduced the term called “Direct model of selling”.\n\nThe second competitive edge he devised is the choice he going to offer offers to his customers. The choice of customization according to the user needs. Its called the “built to order” plate form so by product of this is to eliminate the markup.\n\nAnd the direct end users 24/7 support.\n\nThe company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its \"build-to-order\" or \"configure to order\" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.\n\nIf we talked about the early marketing strategies the company advertised its systems in national computer magazines to approach the direct consumers and each customer assembled unit according to user selection options available.\n\nAs the founder and CEO has almost zero infield experience so he brought in Lee Walker, a 51 year old venture capitalist, in position of president and Chief operating officer to serve as a mentor and to implement CEO’s ideas of the fast growing company.\n\nHe helped founder and CEO in the management and the other decision he has to make is to go public to collect some funds to support his visions in 1988.\n\nThe next step in front of CEO is to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise and this could be achieved by targeting and expanding their businesses to Institutions and Enterprises globally so for that to implement he hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Electronic Data Systems. Even Company changed its name to become Dell computer corporation to indicate horizontal integration of products.\n\nThe company market evaluation goes from almost $30m to $80m in 1988. In 1992, Fortune magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies.\n\nOriginally CEO did not focus on consumer market due to higher cost and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to households and individuals. But in 1996 and 1997 the internet boom, the industry average selling prices to individuals was going down, while this company was going up as second and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing this company. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Dell expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers, starting with low-end servers. The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition\n\nIn 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2004, this company enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett-Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett-Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead. Dell grew the fastest in the early 2000s.\n\nDell attained and maintained the top rating in PC reliability and customer service/technical support, according to Consumer Reports, year after year, during the mid-to-late 1990s through 2001 right before Windows XP was released.\n\nIn 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins’s attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation.\n\nIn 2003, the company was rebranded as simply \"Dell Inc.\", to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.\n\nIn 2004, Michael Dell resigned (because of Rollins background and investors pressure as sales dropped Mr. Dell had to resign. For 12 years prior to joining Dell, Mr. Rollins was employed by Bain & Company, an international strategy consulting firm, most recently serving as a director and partner. Mr. Rollins is the Co-Chairman of the President’s Leadership Council at Brigham Young University, where he founded and continues to sponsor the Rollins Center for E-Commerce. In April 2003, Mr. Rollins was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiation, offering counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative on matters of policy affecting national interests. Mr. Rollins is also active in the American Enterprise Institute) as CEO while retaining the position of Chairman, handing the CEO title to Kevin Rollins, who had been President and COO since 2001. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.\n\nUnder Rollins, Dell acquired Alienware, a manufacturer of high-end PCs, targeted mainly towards the gaming market.\n\nIn 2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that year. By June 2006, the stock traded around US$25 which was 40% down from July 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era. Dell was considering to buy Alienware from 2002 but due to considerable slow growth in PC market Michael Dell made the decision to buy Alienware in 2006 to expand the PC market in gaming division and operate separately in gaming industry under Dell supervision.\n\nAs the PC market get matured so it slow down the growth of which was 66% of the company sale. And at that time the analysis suggested to steer its business model to non-PC such as storage services and servers. Dell… competitive advantage of price due to ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop PCs but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price differentiation. As the entire PC industry reduces the prices along with commensurate increase in performances so in result the opportunity for dell goes shrinks down to upsell their customers.\n\nAs a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit margins. The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores. CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.\n\nDell then instead of taking route in non-PC industry and taking account the other product segments still was heavily focused on corporate PC market because 32% of its revenue come from commercial and corporate Pc market. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's Windows Vista (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008. Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from suppliers. The battery recall in 2006, and returning PC from government and corporates due to faulty capacitor causes the customers to start a slogans called “Dell is hell”… To regain the image Dell tried by spending $100 million in just a few months and rolled out Dell Connect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional \"bloatware\" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%.\n\nDell 2.0\n\nAs Michael Dell regain the position of CEO announces a change campaign called Dell 2.0\n\nMichael Dell announces the number of initiative and plans to improve the financial conditions of a company that includes elimination of bonuses and awards for employees and reduction of managers and diversifying the number of products.\n\nOn April 2008 Dell announces to close one of its biggest call center in Kanata, Ontario so in result reducing a total of 1100 employees. The company had also announced the shutdown of its Edmonton, Alberta office, losing 900 jobs. In total, Dell announced the ending of about 8,800 jobs in 2007–2008 — 10% of its workforce.\n\nDell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in Austin, Texas (original location) and Lebanon, Tennessee (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, received US$280 million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010. Dell's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions, and they sold the North Carolina plant to Herbalife. Most of the work that used to take place in Dell's U.S. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's own factories overseas. The Miami, Florida, facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation, while Dell continues to produce its servers (its most profitable products) in Austin, Texas. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in Limerick, Ireland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in Lodz in Poland. This all is due to Dell’s manufacturing approach of “Configure to order”, delivering individual PCs customized for customers no longer works as PCs became powerful low value commodity.\n\nIn 2008 Dell acquired EqualLogic to gain a foothold in the iSCSI storage market. Because Dell already had an efficient manufacturing process, integrating EqualLogic’s products into Dell drove manufacturing prices down.\n\nIn Dell 2.0 Michael Dell introduced many new plans and made the decision to expand its services to non-PC market. Dell has made the number of acquisitions from then onwards with the plan of its expansion in non-PC market. Dell has made some of the largest transaction in history to follow that plan and tried to expand vertically in the industry. Dell plan to expand its services in Workforce Management, Digital IT and Security services.\n\nSo according to that plan Dell Acquired KACE Networks. KACE Network was a leader in systems management appliances. In the cloud integration Dell Acquired Boomi in 2010.\n\nFrom the effect of slowing the growth of PC market and in the effect of CNET and analysis reports that dell need to expand into non-PC market in 2009 Dell bought Perot Systems helps Dell in applications development, systems integration, and strategic consulting services through its operations in the U.S. and 10 other countries. In addition, the acquisition of Perot brought a variety of business process outsourcing services, including claims processing and call center operations\n\nTo increase some further services in storage line dell bought Compellent in 2011.\n\nTo increase the network portfolio dell Acquire Force10 Networks. By acquiring this company Dell now has the full Intellectual property for their networking portfolio, which was lacking on the Dell PowerConnect range as these products are powered by Broadcom or Marvell IM.\n\nIn 2012 Dell acquired the backup and disaster recovery software solution provider out of Reston, VA. AppAssure delivered 194 percent revenue growth in 2011 and over 3500% growth in the prior three years. AppAssure supported physical servers and VMware, Hyper-V and XenServer. The deal represents the first acquisition since Dell formed its software division under former CA CEO John Swainson. Dell added that it will keep AppAssure's 230 employees and invest in the company.\n\nOn 2010 the release of Apple’s iPad tablet computer had a major negative impact on personal computers from Dell and all the other personal computer vendors as the trend shifts from computers and PCs to tablets.\n\nIn 2012 Dell acquire SonicWall to support their fourth pillar that is Security system. A company with 130 patents, SonicWall develops security products, and is a network and data security provider. And Wyse, A global market-leader for thin client systems. And Clerity Solutions, Clerity, a company offering services for application (re)hosting, was formed in 1994 and has its headquarters in Chicago. At the time of the take-over approximately 70 people were working for the company. Quest Software, an IT management company. Gale Technologies, A provider of infrastructure automation products. Gale Technologies was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. And Credant Technologies, A provider of storage protection solutions. Credant is the 19th acquisition in four years, as Dell had spent $13 billion on acquisitions since 2008 and $5 billion in the past year alone.\n\nIn the shrinking PC industry, Dell continued to lose market share, as it dropped below Lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world. Dell and fellow American contemporary Hewlett Packard came under pressure from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, for instance Lenovo's ThinkPad series was winning corporate customers away from Dell's laptops, Dell's customer service and reputation had been slipping. Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45 percent, seven percent at Hewlett Packard, six percent at Lenovo and Asus, and one percent for Acer.\n\nAfter several weeks of rumors, which started around January 11, 2013, Dell announced on February 5, 2013, that it had struck a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal that would have delisted its shares from the NASDAQ and Hong Kong Stock Exchange and taken it private. Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners( a private equity firm), and 2 billion aided by Microsoft a leveraged deal at a share price of $13.65 was the largest private buyout ever. Lenovo on Michael Dell’s statement “I believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members” acted “the financial actions of some of our traditional competitors will not substantially change our outlook”.\n\nIn March 2013, the Blackstone Group and Carl Icahn expressed interest in purchasing Dell. In April 2013, Blackstone withdrew their offer, citing deteriorating business. Other private equity firms such as KKR & Co. and TPG Capital declined to submit alternative bids for Dell, citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures, so the \"wide-open bidding war\" never materialized. Analysts said that the biggest challenge facing Silver Lake would be to find an \"exit strategy\" to profit from its investment, which would be when the company would hold an IPO to go public again, and one warned \"But even if you can get a $25bn enterprise value for Dell, it will take years to get out.\"\n\nIn May 2013, Dell joined his board in voting for his offer. The following August he reached a deal with the special committee on the board for $13.88 (a raised price of $13.75 plus a special dividend of 13 cents per share), as well as a change to the voting rules. The $13.88 cash offer (plus a $.08 per share dividend for the third fiscal quarter) was accepted on September 12 and closed on October 30, 2013, ending Dell's 25-year run as a publicly-traded company.\n\nAfter the buyout, the newly private Dell offered a Voluntary Separation Program that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent. The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that Dell may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Dell, alongside ARM Holdings, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft, and Princeton University, founded the OpenFog Consortium, to promote interests and development in fog computing.\n\nAnd in 2014 Dell acquire StatSoft, A global provider of analytics software, in order to bolster its big data solutions offering. And lastly the biggest tech deal in history of buying EMC by Dell in 2016.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1) Dell had long stuck by its direct sales model. Consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales from 1988 till 2005 yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift. Lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3 players. Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York. But in vision if you choose this path even you have already make a fortune with this model so nothing wrong with the model instead to cooperate this model you need the kind of thing with your products, and you need to convey the value proposition to gain trust and need to keep that trust with your product or service, then it doesn’t matter whether you apply direct model or whatever, the customer would definitely come to gain value.\n\n2) Dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an innovator. By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on R&D relative to its revenue (compared to IBM, Hewlett Packard and Apple Inc.)—which worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile devices. Increasing spending on R&D would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized. Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.\n\n3) On 2010 the release of Apple’s iPad tablet computer had a major negative impact on personal computers from Dell and all the other personal computer vendors as the trend shifts from computers and PCs to tablets, Dell didn’t realize the need. Dell didn’t innovate in smartphone or in tablets whether operating in windows or Android. The Dell Streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated OS, numerous bugs, and low resolution screen. InfoWorld suggested that Dell and other OEMs saw tablets as a short-term, low-investment opportunity running Google Android, an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers. Dell has responded by pushing higher-end PCs, such as the XPS line of notebooks, which do not compete with the Apple iPad and Kindle Fire tablets. The growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of PCs drove Dell's consumer segment to an operating loss in Q3 2012. In December 2012, Dell suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years, despite the introduction of Windows 8.\n\n4) Till 2013 whatever they have done is for time being, didn’t focus on long lasting value. Biggest of them is to rely on PCs sale. They always make on time plan and they just acted on that and whenever they thought they just act on the new path, this seems another problem in the in leadership, the company doesn’t have a solid vision. First the pcs, then in laptops, then changing the names and leadership, and making many other decisions like going public and then private then again public. The greatest problem I believe Dell has faced the lack of solid plan, actually a vision. The culture of acquisition the dell has set is also a point to think, if think about the organization as a whole, the managers, and other leaders and even workers whenever they faced a major problem, they tend to acquire some big industries instead of pivoting themselves to a vision, or focus on available resources.\n\n5) All the great companies has one thing in common that they paved their own way to success, the next Steve Jobs never going to build Apple Inc. the next bill gates not going to build Microsoft, the next Mark Zuckerberg never going to build a social media plate form. Every successful company is different from inside. The difference is the new path, it’s the leaders job to give a path, they just follow that vision, they enjoy the process while staying on that vision. I think the leadership lacks in case of Dell technologies. As Peter Theil says “I think every moment in the history of business happens only once in the next Mark, Zuckerberg won't be starting a social networking site. The next Bill Gates won't start operating system. You know, the next Elon Musk won't start a Tesla, an electric car company. So what I always push back on really strongly is that there's some kind of straightforward formula because we're always looking for some sort of scientific formula in a science starts with the number two, with things that are sort of experimental and repeatable, but great businesses are 0 to 1. It's always one of a kind and so there is always this anti formulaic quality. Formula out of this one-of-a-kind nature of great. Businesses is, is this need for differentiation? What are you doing that nobody else is doing? What ideas do you have nobody else has? What great business are you working on that no one else is working on?” Dell is different in its supply chain management, but in today’s world innovation only in process doesn’t work.\n\n6) I think there definitely are things that one can iterate on. But the, the core thing is to have a great product, and then you can always improve and iterate on that all sorts of ways. And even in the tech industry on what's striking is, how weak on a quantitative basis so many of those successful companies were it was just, they had a great product and then years after they were able to optimize it, and all sorts of ways. Whereas, if you're just trying to optimize and you don't have a great product, I think that that rarely works. I think it's always worth asking, where you're going to go with this business. And so I think Dell was always focused on very short time arises because you have to figure out a way to get through the next month the next quarter, how do you get some customers? How do you track? But it's always worth thinking it ahead five to ten year, why will this be a really valuable is this in 5 to 10 years? And how's the competitive landscape going to develop? How technology going to develop how the world that I develop? These are hard questions to answer, but I think, the great entrepreneurs that, I know always have some perspective on it and it might be wrong, but it's just, this is what's going to happen and a sort of well-reasoned, and until you have a plan. I think this was missing at Dell technologies. As a famous saying goes “a bad plan is still always better than no plan at all”. And so, have a plan, you can always change it, but don't just pretend that that you have no clue about what's going to happen and that everything about the future is random. If you sort of say that everything is random and out of your control that's why you set yourself up for failure, and we have seen this in the history of dell as it goes with its name, then same with its CEOs position and same with its decision of public or private.\n\n7) After 2000s the company is like competing or struggling to exist, when you compete you get better at that things that you beat them on and it often comes at very hard price of losing site of what truly valuable and meaningful, that what dell get better in those years till 2013.\n\n8) Michael Dell is a creative person. But there is a difference between CEO and COO. Usually it seen in the industry that a good leader is not an operational manager and a good operational manager is not a good leader, he lacks a long time vision.\n\n9) Dell has made many big decisions like acquisition of EMC. As Peter Thiel goes “acquisition occur only in two ways either undersold or oversold” and if leaders of a company being acquired know what they would do in future so it would be undersold, and vice versa. Dell focus on acquiring companies instead focus on what they have, so they end up with over $50b debt and majority of this debt is due to acquisitions. It’s one of the reason you lose control over the decision and handed over to investors, as in case dell to go public to fill the investor’s apatite.\n\n10) Even in the management decisions. The Michael Dell and others management highly rely on others. They set the kind of organizational culture, the organizational design that all kind of employees never even try to innovate. The organizational design and the leadership model plays an important role in innovation.\n\n11) And in 2,000, they should focus on long lasting value, instead of sales, but they continue to focus on sales. Till 2005 sale was high, the sale was from personal computers, they didn't focus on product development and consumers demands to match the industry needs.\n\n12) Dell computer is well-known for its innovation in Supply Chain management. In today's world, the organization doesn't work only on operational Innovation or a process Innovation but the product Innovation also required. As it lacks product innovations because of the organizational culture so they keeps acquiring the big giants.\n\n13) The R&D culture was not there as till 2005, the process development alone works due to less conscious of consumers, as the consumers get little bit more conscious so the sale drops. They just rely on PCs sales. But one thing is great about Dell that Dell was adoptive, they were adoptive to change, change in environment, change in culture, and even change in technology, actually this is the thing they choose their new path after 2013 even after 2008.\n\nDell New Business Model:\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the \"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\".\n\nThe announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business. It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then. EMC was being pressured by Elliott Management, a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual \"Federation\" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core \"EMC II\" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. The Wall Street Journal estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3 billion from personal computers and $8.9bn from servers, while EMC had $16.5bn from EMC II, $1bn from RSA Security, $6bn from VMware, and $230 million from Pivotal Software. EMC owns around 80 percent of the stock of VMware. The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new tracking stock, while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell. Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.\n\nThe combined business was expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture, converged infrastructure and private cloud computing, playing to the strengths of both EMC and Dell. Commentators have questioned the deal, with FBR Capital Markets saying that though it makes a \"ton of sense\" for Dell, it's a \"nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies\" for EMC. Fortune said there was a lot for Dell to like in EMC's portfolio, but \"does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package? Probably not.\" The Register reported the view of William Blair & Company that the merger would \"blow up the current IT chess board\", forcing other IT infrastructure vendors to restructure to achieve scale and vertical integration. The value of VMware stock fell 10% after the announcement, valuing the deal at around $63–64bn rather than the $67bn originally reported. Key investors backing the deal besides Dell were Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners.\n\nOn September 7, 2016, Dell completed its acquisition of EMC. Post-acquisition, Dell was re-organized with a new parent company, Dell Technologies; Dell's consumer and workstation businesses are internally referred to as the Dell Client Solutions Group, and is one of the company's three main business divisions alongside Dell EMC and VMware\n\nIn July 2018, Dell announced intentions to become a publicly traded company again by paying $21.7 billion in both cash and stock to buy back shares from its stake in VMware.\n\nThat is still yet to come that I like to call the digital Renaissance. This Renaissance is comprised of four macro trends that are poised to change the world. As it exists today. These Trends are the following\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nBlockchain\n\nInternet of Things\n\nIn machine or deep learning\n\nSo first, let's start with artificial intelligence. This has been projected by mckinsey that, in the future, 60% of Wall Street jobs will in fact be replaced by artificial intelligence Next, we have block chain in the Internet of Things collectively, they are providing trust transparency in the ability to capture data anywhere, which is predicted, to see Investments, over 10 billion dollars by 2025. Lastly, Dell have machine / deep learning where robots have already been developed at proved, to be smarter than the human brain, and this is only just begun. So, now, more than any point in history, you need a technology partner that you can rely on to help you on your transformational journey and Dell Technologies are there to be your trusted guide on the path ahead. Making business transformation happen and making it real for you that's why Dell Technologies exists today. That's why it combined the innovation of Dell, Dell EMC, Pivotal, RSA, Secureworks, Virtustream and VMware to have seven strategically aligned business units in one family. That each Act independently but working closely in better together.\n\nThis unique structure allows Dell Technologies to innovate like a start-up but with the scale of a global powerhouse. To succeed companies must transform all aspects of their business and now more than any point in history, you need a technology partner you can rely on to help you on your journey.\n\nDell Technologies see the transformation journey following four strategic in parallel paths.\n\nFirst, it has\n\nDigital Transformation.\n\nDigital transformation, which is not where you have to start but it certainly is a good place to start so you can embrace a customer first or customer-centric mindset, which is how Enterprises are seeing the most success in the current Marketplace. The reason why is the concept of an iterative, closed-loop feedback model which enables Dell and you to leverage data from applications that are close to your customers especially with the surge of wearable and social media, data is everywhere. We've seen over 90% of the world's data derived, in the last two years and this is only going to grow exponentially. Dell take this data, that's close to your customers in this closed loop feedback model, and analyze it. And Dell have the ability to make non-destructive changes to the application that customers never ever know about in real time. A great example of this would be the Tesla vehicle if you are a Tesla owner, you may have noticed your car scraping on the pavement as you pull into your driveway because how low of the cars design is from a suspension perspective. Tesla was able to update just a suspension, everything functionality known as containerized applications. This allowed them to make a non-disruptive update to the car without shutting down the rest of the vehicle or customers ever even knowing.\n\nThis type of methodology is accomplished through leveraging functionality that Dell provide to their customers through Pivotal.\n\nPivotal is leading the intersection of Big Data platform as a service or known as PAAS and agile software development.\n\nThey are helping customers deliver traditional and Cloud native applications on one Cloud independent platform. This is exactly how companies similar to Netflix operate and how they disrupted the media industry themselves. For example, when you log onto Netflix, it is constantly analyzing your viewing habits. So it knows what you want to watch. Pivotal helps companies operate in this manner and remain relevant through the closed-loop, iterative feedback model as mentioned above. The digital transformation that I've been discussing today requires transformation in three, additional key areas to make it real. The three key areas are\n\nIT transformation\n\nIn additionally to it transformation, Dell have Workforce transformation.\n\nAnd lastly, most importantly, everyone need everything to be secure so they have Security Transformation.\n\nLet's start with IT Transformation and what that is all about is making sure the applications that are close to your customers and generating you Revenue, are protected and powered by hardware, that will essentially fund your digital transformation. We talked about through the green economics of all flash, technology, and operational efficiency, and scalability of converge and hyper-converged systems, which are the fastest way to make this transformation happen. This is where within the Dell Technologies Portfolio Dell EMC steps in.\n\nDell EMC steps in with their industry-leading, portfolio of storage servers, converged and hyper-converged Solutions. What Dell EMC does is provides customers, like yourself with peace of mind knowing that Dell Solutions are designed and built on five key pillars,\n\n(i) All flash technology\n\n(ii) Flexible scale\n\n(iii) Software-defined\n\n(iv) Cloud enabled and having everything be trusted\n\nAdditionally, Dell portfolio infrastructure solutions is tightly integrated with VMware.\n\nVMware is the most trusted virtualized solution for Data Center and applications. Delivering core infrastructure services on premise or in the cloud as well as providing virtualization management and Security Solutions for end users, their devices in the IOT edge. Also remember, before I mention cloud enablement is one of the five key pillars, not only are Dell’s Solutions cloud enabled for thousands of public clouds, they integrate with our own cloud Virtustream.\n\nSecurity:\n\nVirtustream is the leading Enterprise class, Cloud software and solution provider with a focus on Mission critical applications in application ecosystems. This provides you, the flexibility to embrace a hybrid Cloud Model where you have the ability and flexibility to move workloads on and off Prem, to and from the cloud.\n\nLastly, one more way Dell help businesses is by enabling their employees, to have the ability to work from anywhere. As we now see, that 60 percent of people were are working outside of normal business hours and Dell do this through the Dell Client Solutions portfolio.\n\nWork Force Management:\n\nThe Dell Client Solutions portfolio focuses on Work Force transformation. What this enables you to do is make your employees as effective as possible, all while having ultimate flexibility as to when and where they can work. This is very important when you look at the current landscape of hiring talent. Because currently today, Millennials have new demands that Legacy HR companies aren't used to. Dell steps in, providing these cutting-edge client portfolios to Attract Millennials and also allow them to work anywhere. Dell do this additionally with VMware VDI Solutions, and Dell manage one. So employees can always securely be logged into the network anywhere at any time. Like I said before, the new cutting-edge Dell client portfolio has received multiple Awards and these are countless tools to make your employees effective. So ultimately, you can see Dell Technologies has the ability to help. Dell do so in a few different ways. First, you can develop that next destructive application. Like we talked about through pivotal and your digital transformation. When you develop this app, you also need a safe place to store it that does so and efficient and flexible manner. Dell do that with Dell EMC and IT transformation also powered by VMware, and lastly like I just was talking about, Dell need you to be able to empower your employees with flexibility and powerful IT edge client and that's what they are doing today, with Dell. Lastly, they can't forget about the most important thing with all the ransomware. We see today in the world and all these data breaches and attacks security is more important. That's why you can see the circle of trust wrapped around these four Transformations and your organization. It's focused on security and security transformation. Dell do that through the last to strategically align business units of Dell Technologies, which are RSA and Secureworks.\n\nRSA and Secureworks starting with RSA is a premier provider of security risk, compliance and governance Solutions solving most complex challenges. And Secureworks is an offering that offers Elite and trusted intelligence. A team that Dell bring to you so you can not worry about doing it yourself but let Dell do it for you. This team and this Consulting team of security experts is going to strengthen your security and reduce risk in a dynamic multi-cloud IT landscape.\n\nThis is all supported in wrapped in with Services, specifically service offerings that are here to help you get the most from your investments.\n\nFrom Myclub Consulting and deployment to the global power of pro support and pro deploy to maintenance and training to manage services. They have the ability to install consult and maintain this new environment that you have created, as you walk through these four transformations. And with this no longer is it required to go to a big three strategy consulting firm to devise your roadmap and also hire a tech consultant to go ahead and implement it. Dell Technologies had seven strategically align business units can do it all with their own best-in-class consulting services from Del EMC. This eliminates one more vendor in house, which decreases complexity in the various contractual agreements companies find themselves stuck in that eat up budgets. Lastly, to make this affordable and make sense financially. Dell Technologies has Dell Financial Services who has been helping customers make financial sense of their information technology for over 20 years. Dell Financial Services is the global in-house financial services provider for Dell EMC distributors, channel partners and customers that offers a broad range of innovative payment solutions engineered to help you choose the best technology for your specific needs, as well as the right consumption model where you pay only for technology as you consume it which would be something like Op X.\n\nIn addition to op ex they still have traditional procurement models like capeX and ultimately, either way, you want to do this, Dell help you thrive in today's digital economy. Together the family of strategic aligned businesses from Dell Technologies is a force multiplier, bringing you everything you need in one place and leadership in every category that matters to you and only Dell Technologies offer solutions that span the full IT ecosystem from the edge to the core to the cloud. This is critical because each of these components from IT ecosystem are more closely interconnected than ever before. Together they are a digital leader that is best positioned to gain and maintain competitive advantage, a destructive and transformative force for change in your industry and a winning company that is poised to better serve customers in innovative and exciting ways. This is how Dell Technologies 7 strategically align business units can help walk you through their four strategically defined transformations to ultimately help you transform.\n\nSo you don’t need to go to 25 different companies, instead have a good relation with dell, Peter Thiel said everything is done once in business, going from zero to one, nobody has ever done this before, providing such a vast majority of services to customers but the point is whether dell can handle it well.\n\nFirst we have the internet revolution, but now the 5G, block chain, and autonomous computing and all kind of new things that are being explored out there. One thing is for sure that Dell technologies is highly adoptable and flexible. I can’t imagine how they manage the merger in every year, how the culture effects, and how they manage the cultural change to adjust with new normal.\n\nLiterally there is no company on the planet that has the capabilities that Dell Technologies has across all the transformations in workforce management, Digital, IT and Security sector.\n\nAnd now they are in the change business, they adoptive to change. Helping companies in transformations in any of these sectors.\n\nAgain in 2018 the dell changed its decision to go public. And due to its vast range of field of services to its clients and have these four major fields within one administration so they changed their named to Dell Technologies. And as of 2020 they marked the revenue of over 92 Billion dollars first time in history but the question left to history is that whether they can retain and manage their growth rate for longer period or it’s just again the time based solution to survive and remain in the market? The more important is that the company is still going to be around a decade from now with the same revenues? I believe it’s not enough to have a monopoly for just a moment, the critical thing is to have one that lasts over time. Either you wanted to be the first mover or the last mover?"
