        "text": "Dell EqualLogic storage systems are discovered using SNMP. When an SNMP discovery of an IP address finds a storage entity, a storage device (SAN Group) instance is created. The creation or confirmation of the storage device triggers the appropriate storage discovery pattern. The storage discovery pattern continues discovery of the storage entity using further SNMP requests to discover the associated storage components. Once discovered, the storage entities are modeled in BMC Discovery.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nProvide valid SNMP credentials for the Dell EqualLogic storage device, and add the Dell EqualLogic array SNMP community string, as configured in the Dell EqualLogic Group Manager. We recommend a 30 seconds timeout.\n\nBMC Discovery must be on a network that can access the Dell EqualLogic storage device.\n\nSupported Platforms/Versions\n\nRuns SNMP queries for Dell EqualLogic PS Series.\n\nDiscovered Storage Information\n\nDell EqualLogic Storage Discovered Information\n\nVendor Specific Information\n\nNo known vendor specific information.\n\nLimitations\n\nNo known limitations.\n\nDistributed Storage Model - Concept and Principles\n\nDiscovering Storage\n\nDiscovering SNMP devices\n\nConfiguring SNMP credentials\n\nWas this page helpful? Yes No Submitting... What is wrong with this page?\n\nConfusing\n\nMissing screenshots, graphics\n\nMissing technical details\n\nNeeds a video\n\nNot correct\n\nNot the information I expected\n\nYour feedback\n\nContact information\n\nSend Skip Your feedback\n\nContact information\n\nSend Skip Thank you\n\nLast modified by Veronique Delarue on May 22, 2019"
