        "meta_description": "SSoundway Records reissues a limited 1000 copy run of Nenad Jelic and Laza Ristovskis seminal new age album Opera from 1986. Combining percussion-laden rhythms with synthesisers, vocal samples, and at times unexpected acoustic instruments, the album became a cult classic amongst fans of fourth world and avant garde music. Nenad Jelic is one of the most original artists to appear on the Serbian music scene, a percussionist obsessed with melody and silence, a multidisciplinary instrumentalist. A member of the line-up of musicians which released the cult album Balkan Impressions, he was one of the originators of the World Music movement in Serbia.\r\n\tTracks:\r\n\r\nA1: Rhinoceros II\r\nA2: Gajeiro\r\nA3: Lamentation\r\nA4: Sometimes At Nine\r\nB1: Rumba Balcana\r\nB2: Gitanes\r\nB3: In The Sky",
