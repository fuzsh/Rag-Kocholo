A member of the line- up of musicians which released the cult album Balkan Impressions, he was one of the originators of the World Music movement in Serbia.\n\nFor fans of: Jon Hassell and Brian Eno (Fourth World), Michal Turtle, Harold Budd, Boards of Canada, Gigi Masin and Actress.\n\nTracks: Rhinoceros II / Gajeiro / Lamentation / Sometimes At Nine / Rumba Balcana / Gitanes / In The Sky\n\nMore From This Artist:"
