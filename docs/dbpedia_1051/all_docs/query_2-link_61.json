        "text": "Like an oily cardamom tea staining pristine linen tablecloth there were so much clever words spilled about this generative meisterstück. Some people went as far as to publish academic treatises enclosing transcriptions and formal, harmonic, spectral and all other kinds of analyses that go on and on for many wise and thrillingly impenetrable pages about those two chords in a smudged A♭ major. But no one ever discussed how this music might perform applied to farming. Or maybe someone did?\n\nAnyhow, Eno was always so proud of various functionalities of his musiques d’ameublement. Well, now he could add herding the sheep at the end of the day. I enclose a video illustration within the clips above. I tried to play a fragment to goats resting at the top of Kedrodasos hill. They seemed to like it. Didn’t run away from me and even stood up to chew some grass despite the heat. Which leads me to the idea that farmers might consider adopting the score throughout the facilities producing …\n\nRead More\n\nThe third in the Holy TrinTity of issues focusing on Hellenic mythologies. Really can’t promise it won’t become Tetralogy next year. But yeah, it became a tradition to do Grecian olive-hued melange before heading to Crete each June. This season won’t be an exception. There’s always a moment during a rather long flight to Greece when you can no longer binge on unwatched TV, impersonate working on your laptop or solve puzzles. These selecciones are for that moment. As well as for subsequent imbibing of tsikoudia while taking in Aegean vistas and car rides to the ancient Aptera or one of the Lefka Ori’s gorges.\n\nThis time around I was triggered by the story that one Heraklion-dwelling historian once told me. A hypothesis that the myth of Atlantis might have been inspired by the catastrophic volcano eruption and subsequent tsunami around 1500 BC. The one that destroyed most of the cities and villages on Crete and Ancient Thera (modern Santorini). Effectively precipitating the decline of the Minoan civilization. Long story short, that's a tiny fraction of diverse music that has to do with lost islands/continents, sea-bound mythology, civilization-destroying natural cataclysms and yes, the ever-terrifying story of …\n\nRead More\n\nEvidently, this one is in Ivo’s all-time 4AD Top 10 and a cult favourite among devotees of the label’s gilded age. A project of Pieter Nooten. At the time freshly departed from the Clan of Xymox and in search of more refined sonic palettes. Ultimately landing with a sort of companion to (or even continuation of) “The Moon & The Melodies” - Cocteau’s collab with Harold Budd one year prior.\n\nAll with mandatory Eno collaborator implicated. This time around “infinite guitar” inventor Michael Brook. Most known for engineering classic Editions EG sound of the ‘80s. The aesthetic that Ivo was proactively transplanting (imposing even) on his roster of guitar bands. Perhaps the main reason behind downsized Xymox’s departure to PolyGram. Although as it often happens in the world of indie rock there were many bitter grievances and mutual accusations which are now hard to untangle. For those of you interested Martin Aston’s label chronicles in “Facing The Other Way” re-aired all this gossip in gaudy detai.\n\n“Sleeps With The Fishes” is a strange record. There are amazing moments on it. Like “Searching” - a glorious slice of moody, minimal dream pop à la A.C. Marias. Or similarly Wire-esque …\n\nRead More\n\nRevisiting MTM staples. Here’s a few more by Ben. No Brown this time, but there are other Tuxedomoon alums - violinist Blaine L. Reininger (Nebka) and bassist Peter Principle (When God Was Famous). The above + label boss Mark Hollander populating Lew’s globalist synthetic assemblages with dabs of acoustic colour.\n\nThere’s no denying “Nebka” has a bit of the fourth world thing going. Deeply indebted to Eno & Co it opens with an undisguised pastiche of Harold Budd. Perhaps unnecessary, but accomplished. And where else would you hear Budd with clarinet? Plus, Reininger’s haunted processed violin. As if copy/pasted from one of Zoviet France’s abstractions. “Les Traces d’un pont” is more singular - an assemblage of plucked strings and percussive noises shaped into lopsided quasi-minimalist pattern. Like some sort of proto-glitch made with skipping pitched-down CD of mbira. The next one grows out of something resembling micronized shards of Bolero obliquely strategized by Eno and Hassell. There’s obvious homage to the latter in the parallel fourths arabesques of “Depart”. Thus, the album proceeds until the end alternating veiled exoticisms, sepulchral etherealia and minor-key’ed postminimal keyboards. A sort of stuff that would work wonders as incidental music for dance or experimental theatre - repetitive and tonally/dynamically static. Talking about theatricality there’s …\n\nRead More\n\nThere’s a gap in between Jarman’s published diaries. “Modern Nature” ends in Aug 1990 and “Smiling In Slow Motion” picks up in May ‘91. The former coincides with very complicated production of “The Garden” and Jarman’s struggles with real-world garden at Prospect Cottage, Dungeness (as well as his failing health). “Smiling” restarts well into the post-production of “Edward II” - Jarman’s playfully anachronistic, postmodern repurpose of Marlowe’s pioneering 16th century historic play into an allegory of modern-day homophobia and public health crisis around AIDS epidemic. Then in its cruelest phase. Universally lauded as the pinnacle of greatly missed New Queer Cinema (see B. Ruby Rich coverage of the topic in Sight & Sound) and perhaps Jarman’s most critically successful piece apart from Caravaggio.\n\nSadly, not many notes on production. I remember reading somewhere that it was filmed on unheated soundstage somewhere around Jarman’s loft in Docklands. With a giant shallow pool of water for the floor. One of the art dept tricks to produce dreamlike imagery on a shoestring budget. The skill sharpened during Jarman’s days doing production design for Ken Russell. The extant reviews all mention the film’s unusual score, but mostly focus on Annie Lenox’s admittedly iconic take on Porter’s “Ev’ry time we say goodbye”. Although when watching …\n\nRead More\n\nCarola Baer “The Story Of Valerie” Concentric Circles\n\n…mountains dreaming under their woollen blankets… there’s no better post-NYE Friday brainmelt music than Carola Baer. Synth accompaniment of “On Top Of The Mountain” sounds like maddened Omar Souleyman summoning the spirit of Klaus Schulze.\n\nWill Powers “Adventures In Success” Island\n\nLest we forget that winter celebrations are not over. Not yet! Here’s something groovy for the Orthodox Christmas Eve. All with tongue in cheek self-help cassetes stylisation. Although the irony will inevitably be lost on Gen Z. Anyhow, I think it’s one of the best Chris Blackwell era Island dance 12”s in existence. Concocted by the celebrity photographer Lynn Goldsmith. Probably the least cringy thing that …\n\nRead More\n\nContinuing the EOY music summary bonanza. Now let’s look at the most delicious and impressive archival undertakings of 2023. Continuing the trend of the last 15 to 20 years there was no shortage. Which saddens many contemporary musicians (of all kinds and levels of popularity) and specialist publications that write about or promote them. Which, I guess, is understandable. The looming suspicion of AI, ever-shrinking funding opportunities and audiences, hostile or disinclined publishing platforms. Then add an unbearable weight of acclaimed catalogues on top of it and it seems like there’s not many viable creative pathways that new music can forge.\n\nStill, I don’t think that archival projects in this list are the culprit of this crisis. What we have here is for the most part music that never made it in the first place. Small run and private press records, impossible to find self-released tapes, vanished art gallery issues, unpublished music by obscure composers, avantgarde records that haven’t ever been on plastic and/or haven’t seen repress in many decades, vintage radio essays… More than anything else I feel like these statements should impress and stimulate new generations to stop copying and start fighting for individual ways of musical expression. Let’s have a …\n\nRead More\n\nThe Shining via Cries & Whispers with a sprinkle of Rollin's \"Fascniation\". Restaged in West Yorkshire. I'm imagining Mark Fell wouldn't be especially pleased with imagistic references, but that's exactly what this mega-collage of possessed domestic malaise stimulates.\n\nOn par with Akira Rabelais's \"Context In the Moment\" this father-son entry into Documenting Sound is perhaps the series' only moment that's truly reflective of the pandemic era's distortion of time. Not in the way that it's 'time-stopping'. It's abstract alright and there's many exquisitely filigreed textural layers phasing on top of each other in seemingly random fashion. Glassy electronic percussion, field recorded sound fashioned into unmetered percussive patterns, ghostly reverberations of piano and TV, outdoorsy ambiances, chiming clocks, buzzy static etc. One would be hard-pressed to discern the form behind the fluid changes, fades and blends of all these noises. But the softly percolating, everchanging rhythmic components - a continuous feature - always suggest a structure. Or at least semblance of …\n\nRead More\n\nThe weather gets cozier. Now one needs a blanket to sit out a porch-bound glass of wine. Spiders tirelessly weave their enormous nets and people overdo latte'ed pumpkin drinks. And I think I've settled on a pitch-perfect soundtrack for all these activities - \"Learning To Be Silent\" by C.W. Vrtacek. Granted, not a household name. He was a guitarist from NY state. Played in obscure avant rock outfits. Biota is the more interesting one. They were a large, ever-changing bunch with a few curious records up their sleeve. Published by Chris Cutler's post-Henry Cow imprint ReR Megacorp. Vrtacek was also in Cuneiform-signed trio Forever Einstein. A sort of artsy disjointed post-Beefheart prog. As tiresome as such description might imply, but with some graceful bits on Henry Cow/Art Bears tangent. Perhaps Cutler's overbearing influence?\n\nIn the spare time from all this collective music-making Vrtacek pursued more esoteric muse. Most of it self-published and ranging between rough DIY concrète with post-punk sensibility, synth miniaturism, field recordings, tape loops and milder remembrances of psych folk. If I can compare it to anything I'd think along the lines of Robert Cox's Rimarimba or various experimental offshoots …\n\nRead More\n\nThis month attempting to \"capture glamour without falling into it\". This is my loving tribute to the great Canadian conceptual art pranksters General Idea. Recently I dreamt I was attending their Miss General Idea Pageant of 1971. As far as I know there are no full video renderings of the event apart from a few grainy clips and staged photographs. Neither there is footage of the one they planned for 1984 in the imaginary ziggurat-shaped Miss General Idea Pavilion. Basically, I'm trying to resound the event by grafting the music (narratively, if you will) onto General Idea's various TV cues, forgeries, and mystifications. Or \"framing devices\" in the trio's own wording …\n\nRead More\n\nSadly, there's no information on who Colette Roper was. Certainly, no other music credits to talk about. Perhaps there are more references in visual art catalogues? Perhaps it was a pseudonym? All we have is this set of four pieces set in what sounds like simple D Dorian with modulations down a tritone. Material barely changes. Kind of rotating in the range of a minor third, with occasional step down to subtonic. The accompaniment texture is as basic as can be. Alberti bass patterns and triadic broken chord arpeggiation with infrequent sequences harmonised in thirds. Reminiscent of Tom Johnson's \"An Hour For Piano\". Albeit less metronomic. In its rubato'ish tentativeness this feels improvised on the fly. Like Johnson's work \"Piano Pieces\" achieves its potency through accumulation of natural harmonic resonance and stoic…\n\nRead More\n\nIn hindsight Jelinek turned out to be the most consistently innovative producer to come out of fin de siècle glitch electronica cohort. The aesthetic quickly derailed into creative cul-de-sac, but not before giving us a few brilliant records. Including Jelinek's early run on Stefan Betke's ~scape as well as “(Personal_Rock)” (as Gramm). All the above incessantly carbon copied to this day.\n\nWhile producers like Oval and Ryoji Ikeda stubbornly gnawed at the progressively less fertile set of ideas Jelinek proved more restless. Taking glitch's fundamental techniques on aesthetic wild ride. Including armchair-bound ambient techno of Gramm, slowed-down krautrock hommages in Kosmischer Pitch, Matmos-like micro-collages on \"Zwischen\" as well as tape loops and forged radiophonics as Ursula Bogner. Not all of it was uniformly brilliant. I for instance couldn't fully engage past those…\n\nRead More\n\nRainy Monday down here. Perfect time for Harold Budd. There's a bunch of classics to attend to, but sometimes it's more rewarding to investigate neglected corners. It's assumed that 1990s was a time when Budd and his fellow furniture ambiance auteurs were on a struggle bus creatively. Zeitgeist shifted to new kind of mood music concocted by dance and electronica producers. Meaning less abstraction and more cheeky sci-fi retrofuturism and samples.\n\nOld guard's reaction was interesting. Initially some tried to adapt, with varying degree of success. Hassell with 808 State, Eno remixing Massive Attack. But mortgage had to be paid, so the latter moved on to producing stadium rock bands and soundscaping oligarch-sponsored art galleries. His former companions retreated to 'musique savante' venues and rarified jazz institutions - Bryars and Hassell come to mind. Budd seemed the only one unmoved. Instead opting for collaborations complimentary to his pensive brand…\n\nRead More\n\nWhat REALLY happened to agent Dana Scully when she was abducted by aliens? The question preoccupied me for a longest time… I was secretly hoping X-Files big boss Chris Carter would take cues from David Lynch and create some sort of bizarre Black Lodge stream-of-consciousness episode about it. You know, a sci-fi take on dancing midgets, people talking backwards and malicious doppelgängers. Perhaps something along the lines of final sequence in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"?!\n\nAlas, Carter was less risk-taking than Lynch or Kubrick, so it never happened. I can’t make a TV episode, but I can imagine how it would have sounded. And here is the result. I’ll call it Agent Scully’s Abduction Hallucinations. A jumble of Mark Snow's X-Files cues mangled, reassembled, and fused with contemporary (and not so contemporary) electronica and percussion music. Tracklist and streaming inside…\n\nRead More\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space'. This Jostein Gaarder's quote is more existential philosophy than sci-fi in its original context. Still, it feels more appropriate in relation to this music rather than overwritten 1997 space rock opus by Spiritualized. Coincidentally Detroit native Rod Modell started his recording career right about the same time as the British band was recording its pompous 3rd album. Similar to the ongoing socio-political movements I'm a bit hazy with how to number 'the waves' of American techno past the 2nd gen of Drexciya and Robert Hood. Let's just say Modell can be considered in the same lineage, but later. His aesthetic is thought to pick up on the thread of initially Berlin-centric…\n\nRead More\n\nLast remaining survivors of Throbbing Gristle. Both perennially busy with new projects. Especially Cosey with her newfound literary career and scoring BBC Four documentary on Delia Derbyshire. No wonder the duo's archival programme remained neglected since Carter's pre-pandemic presses on Mute. Perhaps horrified by shambolic handling of Coil reissues, these two decided to restart the campaign while they still can call the shots.\n\nOut of all post-TG extensions I find C&C's catalogue to be the second most interesting after Coil. Perhaps less consistent quality-wise and less voraciously experimental, but similarly poly-stylistic. In hindsight the duo's stubborn, but oddly rendered engagement with the populist…\n\nRead More"
