        "text": "It would be comforting to imagine that “The Optimists,” Goran Paskaljevic’s viciously funny gloss of Voltaire’s “Candide,” was a site-specific satire of this Serbian director’s homeland in the post-Milosevic era. The film’s five vignettes, whose characters cling to irrational optimism in the face of poverty, injustice and hatred, are all set in an unidentified Eastern European wasteland of bleak farming villages, one of which has been inundated by a flood.\n\nBut if you subtract those geographic indicators, these cynical stories of humble people embracing absurd illusions illustrate the universal impulse to believe in a better future, no matter what. People as desperate as these are easy marks for snake-oil peddlers, mad men and predators of every stripe. A phrase from Shakespeare echoed in my head as I watched the movie: “Lord, what fools these mortals be.” The smile on my face was a Puckish leer curdled by the knowledge that I’m just as much a potential sucker as any of them.\n\n“The Optimists,” which opens a weeklong engagement on Thursday at the Museum of Modern Art, isn’t as relentlessly savage as “Cabaret Balkan,” Mr. Paskaljevic’s excoriating portrait of late-20th-century Belgrade, which won awards at several European film festivals in 1998. Although “The Optimists” portrays a fairly graphic rape and the slaughter of a pig, its vision of a society in disarray isn’t as starkly Hobbesian as that of “Cabaret Balkan.”\n\nThe stories are unrelated except for the formidable presence in all five of Lazar Ristovski, a stocky 58-year-old actor whose multiple roles add up to a grotesque composite Serbian everyman. The screenplay is blunt and to the point, and the performances are subtly tinged with a surreal comic edge.\n\nIn the first, Mr. Ristovski plays a charismatic stranger who appears in a village ravaged by flood at a warehouse where the townspeople have gathered for shelter. Promising to help them via hypnosis, he lulls one woman into a stupor from which he promises she will emerge feeling wonderful and full of hope.\n\nHis spell is successful, and he is on the verge of hypnotizing the entire village to be happy and work together, until the woman complains that her wallet has been stolen. He is summarily arrested and later found to be an escapee from a mental institution.\n\nIn the second story he plays the owner of a slaughterhouse and the father of a porcine pre-adolescent sociopath who has to be locked up at home to keep him from gleefully slaughtering any animal in sight. He has a smaller role in the third story, about compulsive gambling. In the fourth he is the father of young woman who is raped by his boss, the bigwig owner of the local foundry in which all the men in the town work. That episode, which illustrates the power of a dictator to act with impunity, is the most acutely political of the tales.\n\nThe final story sums up the movie’s smirking nihilism. A busload of sick and disabled people whose tour guide leads them in happy singalongs lurches through the countryside on the way to a spring with waters, their host promises, that will cure all their ills. Shortly before arriving at this miracle spa he abandons the vehicle and is whisked away by fellow con men, leaving them to straggle toward what turns out to be a muddy pond at the bottom of a quarry.\n\nIn the final tableau, which shows these pilgrims blissfully splashing themselves with mud (or worse), they resemble nothing so much as superannuated nursery school children paddling around in filth and devouring mud pies of their own making. Lord, what fools. ..."
