        "text": "Factory workers who have not been paid for six years stage a protest by lying across the access road to their workplace. Gruja, an unemployed filmmaker who makes videos of weddings and funerals for a living, is trying to save up enough money to propose to Bela, his girlfriend. Bela is an unemployed opera singer who earns her living by singing opera arias in people’s homes. Gruja’s father Dile, an unemployed factory worker, comes up with the idea of organizing a 'game' in which he, Gruja and Bela are supposed to rob gold and diamonds from rich kids... Disgruntled workers go on a march, carrying placards that express their desperation. Dile performs a rap song about revolution. A close-up of one of the marcher’s placards closes the scene and the film.\n\nLazar Ristovski (1952) is an actor, director, producer, musician and writer.
