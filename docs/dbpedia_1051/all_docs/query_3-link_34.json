        "text": "Let’s stay with LM, Ltd. for the moment. Here’s one by Jill Kroesen. Her only full-length, but some people might recognize her distinctive nasal-to-mutter’y deadpan from Dinosaur L‘s “24→24” classics. Cutting like a knife through Arthur Russell’s thick, lubed-up disco arrangements. Su Tissue battles Alan Vega in one throat. Although, as far as can be deduced from “Honey, You’re So Mean”, she could also do raspy Marianne Faithfull with Cher-like sliding warble bookending verses. Very odd and not particularly well-controlled type of voice, but memorable. Not for nothing Ashley casted Kroesen as Isolde in “Perfect Lives”.\n\nWhat a dirty shame she left music so soon. They say to pursue videography… Judging by “Stop Vicious Cycles”, Krosen was a bonafide entertainer. Overall, her pieces –arranged in collab with her sometime bandleader in Love Of Life Orchestra Peter Gordon - oscillate between artsy torch song and energetic pastiche of ZE Records. Their self-conceptualised “mutant disco” (Christina, James Chance, Kid Creole). A fun microgenre that was absolutely ruined in the early 00s via hipster reissues and inept stylisations. Somehow Kroesen was spared, apart from her Russell contributions. Perhaps she wasn’t pop enough or because her stuff was published on avant classical label. Most people run the other way when someone is associated with avantgarde opera. Talking about …\n\nRead More\n\nDeep summer classic no.2. We are now in Miami. There’s a fashion shoot on the beach. Fancy cars and catering trucks in the parking lot. Must be Vogue Paris! Or perhaps Marie Claire? But they are shooting something very American. Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger? Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs are thankfully not yet a thing. There’re underwear models frolicking about. Young Linda Evangelista? Clothes are recognizably 1980s, but hair and accessories are throwback to the ‘60s. They are playing strange dubs of Beach Boys to get people in the mood. The ocean behind the proceedings is the same hue as Yves Klein’s “California”. Wait, that’s not Beach Boys. No vocal harmonies to be found. On a side note, I can never understand when people breathlessly admire Wilson’s “complex chord progressions”. What’s so intricate about incessant V-ii-V-I or basic I-IV-V with occasional sprinklings of suspensions and major/minor 7ths? Anyhow, that’s not Steely Dan either. Even if their sometime guitarist Elliott Randall (like Mme Abramovic’s ‘Artist’) IS present. Perhaps it’s an extended balearic edit of Fleetwood Mac’s “Albatross”. Nah. Maybe those are unpublished instrumental tracks for John Martyn’s “One World”? Or is it young Viny Reilly? …\n\nRead More\n\nBrain-melting heat. Feel woozy, like transitions in the clip above. Dome 2 feels illustrative. Especially the Coil-like first part of “The Red Tent”. Second partition is just Gilbert’s annoying bleating over metallic industrial chug. Sounds like exhausted slowed-down Warm Leatherette. No wonder Mr. Miller backed Gilbert’s projects on Mute. Many people think it’s “experimental”. “Long Lost Life” renders like an odder precursor to Sonic Youth if only they weren’t so American and excruciatingly boring. “Breathsteps” goes a bit 20 Jazz Funk Greats. I could almost imagine Genesis P.Orridge doing a cover version. Savouring the intoning over that prickly mechanoid rhythm. “Reading Prof B” has balafon’ish feel to it. I always thought Dome worked out better in their quieter, vocal-less fragments. With bravado guitar screeching traded for gentler discordant texture. “Ritual View” could have been Dome’s new wave chart-topper if only it wasn’t smothered with static patina of foregrounded synth pulses and out-of-tune guitar. “Twist Up” has a bit of Germanic vibe to it. Beate Bartel’s CHBB tapes come to mind. “Keep It” starts out like an outtake from some obscure video nasties soundtrack. A slasher set in …\n\nRead More\n\nTwo aural pharmaceuticals. The former for revving up, the latter for winding down. Took these out to distract myself from their author’s late-career forays into self-promoting brand of climate change ‘activism’ and designing LED-lit novelty products. The other day I saw Eno’s new advertorial promoting some odd music-publishing platform. Fast like a (streaming) riverflow and ‘elaborately slow’ - probs implying vinyl with limited edition rugs and designer incense. Sounds about as innovative as Neil Young’s Pono. All I was thinking is that most musicians can’t figure out existing ‘platforms’ while the overwhelming majority of potential audience couldn’t care less how to consume it. As long as it’s free and plays on their screens.\n\nOnce upon a time Eno was implicated in producing music. “My Life...” and “No Pussyfooting” are among his most successful blends. Making thorny, overcomplicated concepts of unloved avantgarde instantly agreeable to people who never cared for ‘experimental’ art. And there were as many haters as there were admirers. The latter thinking him pop music’s John Cage. While the former condemn the theft of ideas and pop art’ing the niche. On my part, I can’t help but admire the audacity of Eno’s undertaking. Transmogrifying impenetrable and acquired taste into mass-market is not easy. Synthesizing arcane, conflicting philosophies into …\n\nRead More\n\nWhat unites these very different records? The answer is the producer. Craig Leon - a celebrated in-house studio wizard for Sire and preeminent engineer of new wave sound. See his oft-cited work with populist stratum of mid-70s NYC Downtown (Talking Heads, Blondie, Suicide). Coincidentally Blondie was a Chrysalis signee and Chrysalis co-owned John Fahey’s Takoma. And Cassell Webb - a fellow music biz professional with roots in Texan psych (various Lelan Rogers projects like Red Krayola, Children and 13th Floor Elevators) - was already in the picture in those years. Working with Leon since his late ‘70s relocation from East Coast for fancy LA postings with Polygram.\n\nBoth could be considered music industry’s veterans, by the time of Leon selling Fahey and his manager Denny Bruce (ex-assistant to Phil Spector’s associate Jack Nietzche) the outlandish concept of Nommos. The latter is a synth-tempered ‘imaginary folk music’ of mythical extraterrestrial visitors to Malian Dogon tribe. The latter’s actual music is available through terrestrial field recordings by Ocora’s ethnomusicologists. Despite Takoma’s pre-existing Moog projects with Bernie Krause the album still feels like a catalogue outlier. And Webb was instrumental in procuring …\n\nRead More\n\nNear perfect pop album and the final in Grace Jones’s unimpeachable run through the first half of the 1980s. And of course one of Trevor Horn’s finest productions. Sometimes I wonder what he’d do if hired to produce some of today’s generic starlets. In many ways one could say that his over-the-top approach and ‘widescreen’ sound prefigured today’s studio indulgences. But whereas modern pop is suffocatingly overproduced (and over-compressed) his is airy and sweepingly cinematic in gaudy technicolour. Packed with dynamic contrasts, spatial effects and arousing nuance. Arousing is actually the qualifier that feels à propos of all his productions, whether it’s due to the material he was asked to work on or an outcome of production style. Perhaps both. And “Slave To The Rhythm” is a fine example of it.\n\nPeople wrote a lot about this record and there’s mistaken belief that recurs in regard to it being a precursor of remix albums. On my part I was under the impression dub producers, including the ones who worked with Jones at Compass Point, made a lot of those throughout the ‘70s. Regardless, “Slave To The Rhythm” is an interesting brew. Spinning rather flimsy sole seed of songwriting into a crazed symphony of immoderate …\n\nRead More\n\nThe first and the final by this Tel Aviv via Amsterdam unit. Originally a quartet of Malka Spigel (also check out her poly-stylisitc late ‘90s solo run on ~swim), vocalist Samy Birnbach (future curator of Freezone - Crammed’s influential ambient electronica series) and guitarists Berry Sakharof and Ramy Fortis. Plus, rotating cast of invited guests (including Wire members) post-relocating to Holland. The last two were a bit like punk era’s experimental rock pioneers back in their own country. This is according to Regev/Seroussi’s unyielding UCLA publication “Popular Music & National Culture in Israel” which I cruelly subjected myself to while reading up on Arabic-derived Musiqa Mizrahit.\n\nMC’s self-titled EP of the ‘81 starts out like a carbon copy of A Certain Ratio’s “Do The Du”. Birnbach delivering pitch-perfect Ian Curtis’s greyscale monotone over funked-up post-punk beats. It’s openly derivative - a variation on the early Factory bands, concurrent NY hipsters (99 record roster like ESG and Liquid Liquid) and more lyrical takes aligning with 154-era Wire. Mark Hollander’s guest turn on clarinet/sax imbues this offering with je-ne-sais-quoi colouristic …\n\nRead More\n\nThese days our local Québécoise Danielle Boutet is a psychology prof. Residing in the Atlantic facing north-eastern town of Rimouski - a popular destination for oceanography students and whale watching types. But in the ‘80s she dabbled in music and fine arts. Channeling it into two self-released collections of DIY melancholic Francophone chansonettes with off-kilter trappings of new age’y synth pop. Emphasising poésie and muted theatricality. Listening to it I wish Boutet would have sent it to Hector Zazou. I’m sure he’d flesh it out into a bonafide genre-bending confectionary. Fit for hallowed catalogues of Crammed Discs. But it was not to be, and the thing is a thrillingly obscure self-published cassette.\n\nWith cascades of stylistic name-droppings press notes enthusiastically suggest wide-ranging eclecticism. Going as far as “jazz noir” and minimalism. All I can say is you’d have to be very imaginative to hear that. With the latter it’s as if any record featuring a few modulating arpeggios and marimba is now a fair candidate. Although I must admit that on rare occasion (specifically the “tone poems” of both Hivers pieces) the ever-present blend of xylophones and synths create fleeting aural impression of something off early Midori Takada if one would remove virtuosity and rhythmic invention. As to the jazz tangent it’s even less plausible considering Boutet’s unadorned …\n\nRead More\n\nContinuing the EOY music summary bonanza. Now let’s look at the most delicious and impressive archival undertakings of 2023. Continuing the trend of the last 15 to 20 years there was no shortage. Which saddens many contemporary musicians (of all kinds and levels of popularity) and specialist publications that write about or promote them. Which, I guess, is understandable. The looming suspicion of AI, ever-shrinking funding opportunities and audiences, hostile or disinclined publishing platforms. Then add an unbearable weight of acclaimed catalogues on top of it and it seems like there’s not many viable creative pathways that new music can forge.\n\nStill, I don’t think that archival projects in this list are the culprit of this crisis. What we have here is for the most part music that never made it in the first place. Small run and private press records, impossible to find self-released tapes, vanished art gallery issues, unpublished music by obscure composers, avantgarde records that haven’t ever been on plastic and/or haven’t seen repress in many decades, vintage radio essays… More than anything else I feel like these statements should impress and stimulate new generations to stop copying and start fighting for individual ways of musical expression. Let’s have a …\n\nRead More\n\nGardens are still lush outside, pollinators still buzzing over surviving echinacea. But in a silent reminder that this won't last for much longer (especially in our Canadian climes) people start to put out buckets of chrysanthemums and strange-looking compositions of ornamental grass and kale. Never understood the attraction of the latter in flower arrangements (even less so as food). This longwinded sidenote is to say that Astley's sweet and daydreamy 'pastoralias' for piano, woodwinds and field recordings are pitch perfect for this transitional moment when golden-lit end of summer segues into savoury comforts of autumn.\n\nRight after this one Astley went on to become 'big in Japan'. Recording minor synth pop classic with Ryuichi Sakamoto. Even featuring David Sylvian cameo. \"Gardens\" seems like an outlier in her discography. Most likely it has roots in Astley's earlier collaborations with ex-Skids lead singer Richard Jobson. The ones where the latter intones heavily accented poetic streams over melodious French modernist piano accompaniments. It only makes sense that Astley's gardens are perfumed with the airs of Giverny. Coloured with …\n\nRead More\n\nIn the mood for dance music as of late. Goes well with the relentless heat, which is seemingly everywhere I go this summer. So, here's something apropos - the Heatwave mix. I'll call it Radiation Ruling The Nation (the Mad Professor reference). So yes, I was a bit nostalgic for the old-school beatmatching I guess, so it's a fully mixed thingy. Like in the olden days. As well as silly samples and homemade mashups. No other rules, but to keep it as unserious and silly as possible. The first part is in sexy Balearic booty-swaying tempo - works well with the rosé and bubbles, second is a bouncy house hour, so you'll need something stronger. Streaming and the tracklist inside.\n\nRead More\n\nSpending some quality time with Wally Badarou. A perfect soundtrack for a long lazy weekend in the humid heat.\n\nBadarou is probably the most distinctive of synth pop / new wave era keyboardists. His sound is basically all over Island catalogue in the 1980s, which says a lot. Most importantly Grace Jones’s best stuff, but also Marianne Faithful, Talking Heads, Level 42, Manu Dibango, The Tom Tom Club… The list can go on and on. Despite adapting to each of those distinctive artists I think Badarou always brought this very specific colour to any material. Now I know he is a French guy with Benin ancestry, but I can’t help but feel various vernacular musics of Africa in his playing. The curlicues of Ethiopian music, the sweetness of Wassoulou, the groove of Nigerian funk. But also the spaciousness of Jamaican dub, which I think was …\n\nRead More\n\nPicking up the intermittent thread of wild musical brews concocted deeply behind the Iron Curtain. This one came out on state-owned PGP (imprint of Radio Television Belgrade) in the final years of Socialist Yugoslavia. As with Perestroika era in simultaneously unravelling Soviet Union this was politically and culturally milder period, hence the tolerance for weirder music that wouldn't necessarily find state sponsorship earlier. An easier era of growing socio-cultural liberalism preceding disastrous ethnic conflicts and civil war of the 1990s. Or so it seems on the outside. I'm sure the reality was much more complicated...\n\nBut let's not dwell on politics. This feels like a Serbian answer to Trevor Horn's larger-than-life production for various Zang Tumb Tuum acts of the 1980s. Super-producer's tool of choice Fairlight CMI is not used on this one (most likely due to budgetary…\n\nRead More\n\nContinuing the travelogues of world record stores. Here is my stop in Chicago. If you ask me, one of the best places to dig in United States. As with other mini-guides that I’ve did for Athens, London and Paris I’ll keep this one updated on repeated visits. Even though record store maybe an endangered species there are still some new places that pop up and obviously there are the ones that sadly close their doors. For now what’s included are overviews of Dusty Groove, a few Reckless Records locations, Shady Rest, Dave’s (now sadly closed), 606 Records and Shuga.\n\nRead More\n\nWas reorganising my Spanish records and found this pleasingly obscure synth gem from the late 1980s Barcelona. Imagine if Roedelius played a blend of Weather Report, late 1980s TV ident muzak and Philip Glass keyboard études with manic intensity of Conrad Schnitzler and synth timbres of Telectu. If it sounds too much it’s because it is, but in a very endearing way. Miraculously this is not in Chee Shimizu’s ‘Obscure Sound’ , but would have been right at home in fancifully entitled “Accidental Music in Spain”.\n\nI couldn’t find a lot of information on the author Conrad Setó, but he is listed as “jazz pianist”. Although brash digital synth textures permeating this record make the relationship to jazz hard to pinpoint at first. But then when you listen closer…\n\nRead More\n\nLast summer I was on extended stay in Greece. It was a great opportunity to learn about the country’s rich musical heritage. Some of it I knew prior to the trip, but a lot was entirely new. To coincide with my trip I prepared a few entries on my favourite Greek music. At the end of my travels I also made a Hellenic-themed radio program for Bristol-based Noods Radio merging ‘field ambiences’ collected on the trip with some of those selections. Additionally mixing in some of the music discovered or recommended in various record stores around the country. Talking about record stores I also made a parallel series on Athens-based joints selling vinyl which can be found here.\n\nAt the time I couldn’t post it online other than in sporadic social media entries, but now I decided to compile all these entries into one compact resource. Perhaps someone will find it useful as an entry point to Greek music. I have to admit that aesthetically it’s really far from traditionally recognized canon of Greek popular aesthetics - in this way you won’t find any laïko, rebetiko or pre-1980s pop in my selections. Instead I was more interested in exploring Greece’s small, but storied avantgarde, synth music, experimental pop, some idyosincratic folk traditions and its sacred music. It will be a work in progress and I’ll get back to expand it some more on my upcoming trips. Without further ado here are my Greek Music Travelogues…\n\nRead More"
