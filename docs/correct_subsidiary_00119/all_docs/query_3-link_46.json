Chief executive William Scott said he could not discuss the options, one of which was understood to include the sale of a controlling shareholding in CommQuest - which owns 11 marketing services businesses - to a new investor. \"We are still looking at two major but very different options,\" Mr Scott said. \"I would expect to have something to announce less than a month from now. Right now we are flat out considering each option.\" In late February CommQuest, which lost $46.4 million in the December 2008 half, said it would sell some of the companies it owned, close others and cut costs in all businesses to help reduce its $23.8 million debt. Since then it has sold mobile-phone marketing company Impulse Business Solutions for $2.35 million to Dominet Digital, an investment firm run by Domenic Carosa, the founder and chief executive of the failed digital marketing and media business, Destra. Shares in CommQuest, which listed in November 2007 at an issue price of $1, were trading at 1.5Â¢ when they were placed in a trading halt on March 23 ahead of an update of its restructuring plan. Its shares were suspended on March 25. At the time CommQuest said it thought the shares would resume trading by mid-April, but they remain suspended. In February CommQuest said Australia and New Zealand Banking Group had agreed to extend its banking facility until December 31 and provide a short-term funding facility to help cover its working capital requirements to June 30. Mr Scott said the company would sell or close some of its advertising and public relations businesses - which had been hit by the downturn in marketing budgets since late last year - but keep its digital, direct and mobile marketing firms. Impulse was one of the companies it was expected to keep. The float of CommQuest raised $30.2 million, $24.1 million of which was used to buy the eight companies that were part of the group at the time. Some of the companies were owned by Mr Scott, including the direct-sales business The Smart Group and a related public relations firm. In early April CommQuest said ANZ had agreed to vary some of its borrowing conditions to \"provide further, limited financial support to the company as it proceeds with [the] divestment program\". The bank set several conditions for its support. CommQuest reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $1.4 million for the December 2008 half, 33 per cent lower than the $2.1 million it had forecast in early February. A $45.3 million impairment charge and $691,361 of bad debt write-downs pushed it to a $46.4 million loss for the half.\n\nEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebook\n\nSubscribe to gift this article\n\nGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.\n\nSubscribe now\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\nLatest In Companies\n\nFetching latest articles\n\nMost Viewed In Companies"
