        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Dec. 13 -- MIPS Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: MIPS) today announced that ESS Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: ESST - ), a leading supplier of audio, digital video and communications semiconductor solutions for the PC and consumer markets, has acquired a license from MIPS Technologies for the MIPS32 4Kc(TM) synthesizable processor core. ESS Technology, Inc. will integrate the core into high performance system-on-chip (SOC) solutions. ``ESS Technology's roadmap of silicon solutions for Internet, E-commerce, digital video, education, entertainment and other related applications requires high-performance and high integration,'' points out Fred Chan, ESS's Chairman of the Board. ``The power of the MIPS architecture and the flexibility of MIPS Technologies' IP business model allows ESS to develop system-on-chip ICs that will power the next generation of consumer entertainment appliances.''\n\n``MIPS Technologies' 32- and 64-bit processor IP has become the preferred choice of OEMs developing advanced digital entertainment devices such as digital and Internet-enabled set-top boxes, game consoles and personal video recorders,'' says Brian Knowles, vice president of marketing at MIPS Technologies. ``With ESS as a licensing partner, we have a well-positioned silicon supplier who can help proliferate the MIPS architecture into the digital consumer and Windows® CE appliance marketplace.''\n\n``This license agreement contributes to the leadership of the MIPS architecture in high performance digital entertainment,'' points out Tony Massimini, senior analyst at Semico Research Corp. ``MIPS Technologies already has a strong position with game console OEMs such as Sony. This gives them the inside track with fabless semiconductor makers supplying a wider range of digital entertainment systems.''\n\nThe MIPS32 4Kc is a 32-bit synthesizable processor core that is compatible with the new MIPS32 and MIPS64 architecture standards. Because of its flexibility and a wide range of support tools that enable easy integration, it has become a popular solution for SOC designs. It includes a set of 32 general purpose 32-bit registers, a five-stage instruction pipeline optimized for system-on-chip implementations, four simultaneous execution units, power management features, a programmable cache controller and a Windows® CE-compliant memory management unit. It features a fully static design and is optimized for integration into a 0.18 or 0.25 micron CMOS manufacturing process. Featuring a die size of under 3 mm2 in a typical 0.25 micron process, the MIPS32 4Kc is ideal for applications requiring high integration, low cost and low-power dissipation. With 16Kbytes of instruction and data cache, the MIPS32 4Kc consumes less than 2 mW/MHz.\n\nThe MIPS32 4Kc is available in easily synthesized ``soft'' electronic file formats and in process-specific ``hard'' formats. It is fully supported with a wide variety of tools including simulation tools, hardware/software co-simulation models, verification scripts, user guides, and test chip data sheets and specifications. In addition, the MIPS architecture is the most widely supported of all embedded processor architectures. There are over 60 development tool vendors and 150 products available for use with the MIPS32 4Kc processor core.\n\nAbout ESS Technology\n\nESS Technology, Inc., a leader in Internet, communications, PC audio and digital video, provides advanced products enabling the convergence of communications, computer, consumer, and Internet markets.\n\nESS's wholly owned subsidiary, ViAlta.com, Inc. plans to introduce advanced, user friendly products and applications for the Internet. Products will include multi-media appliances, applications and content for the Internet, which enable the user to experience new levels of entertainment and e-Commerce. ESS, headquartered in Fremont, California, has R&D, sales, and technical support offices worldwide. ESS Technology's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol ESST. ESS's web site address is: http://www.esstech.com.\n\nAbout MIPS Technologies, Inc.\n\nMIPS Technologies, Inc. is the world's primary architect of embedded 32- and 64-bit RISC processors. The company drives the broadest architectural alliance that is delivering 32- and 64-bit embedded RISC solutions.
