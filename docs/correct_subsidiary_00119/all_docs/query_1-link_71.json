In addition, MIPS Technologies has recruited a Technical Director for Europe to complete its European management team.\n\n\"Our business is conducted at very high levels within customer's organisations - frequently at board level,\" explained John Hall, MIPS Technologies' Vice President of European Operations. \"We have therefore sought out some of the most knowledgeable high technology business managers in Europe who have many years of experience at developing high level business relationships. Because ours is a very technical industry, they all have the education and business experience in high technology to enable them to talk with authority about our products. This experience also means that they have excellent relationships throughout the European electronics industry that are already starting to bear fruit in the shape of new license discussions with leading companies in Europe. They are all team players and have managed sales or engineering teams - experience which will be invaluable as we continue our expansion into Europe with the addition of more staff and Field Application Engineers (FAEs).
