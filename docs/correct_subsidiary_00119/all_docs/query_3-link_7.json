        "text": "CANTON, Ohio (July 29, 2021) – CommQuest Services is pleased to announce the election of Mike Marino as the agency’s new board chair, along with a slate of officers, and two new board members. Marino succeeds George Urban as CommQuest’s board chair.\n\nMarino, managing partner at AA Hammersmith Insurance, is joined by officers: Vice-Chair Aimee Belden, executive vice president & COO at Schauer Group; Treasurer Eric Schreiber, director at 415 Group; and Secretary Jeff Dafler, vice president of economic development and public policy at the Canton Regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe board also elected two new members: Hilary Rossi, brand manager at the J.M. Smucker Company, and Brian Shaughnessy, administrative director of performance improvement/project management at Cleveland Clinic Mercy Hospital.\n\n“We have a strong board of community leaders who are committed to the mission of bringing hope through addiction recovery, mental health and social support. As a group, we’re working to support the charge that we’ve given to our new CEO, which is to improve organizational performance and sustain this important mission for years to come,” said Marino. “We welcome Hilary and Brian to the board, as they each bring both the commitment and expertise that will further strengthen the CommQuest board.” (Elaine Russell Reolfi was named CEO of CommQuest in April 2021.)\n\nRossi has more than a decade of experience in consumer-packaged goods marketing, including four years at a Fortune 500 company. She specializes in brand strategy and has a passion for turning strategy into reality and creative problem-solving. Rossi believes open communication is critical for success and diversity of thought makes teams stronger. She is a Walsh University graduate with degrees in Marketing & Finance.\n\nShaughnessy is the administrative director of performance improvement/project management at Cleveland Clinic Mercy Hospital. He brings deep knowledge of continuous improvement through process optimization and has worked with CommQuest and other nonprofits to improve operational performance.\n\nTo learn more about CommQuest Services, please visit CommQuest.org or call 330.455.0374."
