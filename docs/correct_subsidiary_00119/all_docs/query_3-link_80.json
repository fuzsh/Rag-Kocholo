        "text": "Alcoholism\n\nThe goal of treatment for alcoholism is abstinence. Those with poor social support, poor motivation, or psychiatric disorders tend to relapse within a few years of treatment. For these people, success is measured by longer periods of abstinence, reduced use of alcohol, better health, and improved social functioning. Recovery and Maintenance are usually based on 12 step programs and AA meetings.\n\nDrug Addiction\n\nDrug rehab in Ohio provides comprehensive treatment to address the physical and psychological needs of those struggling with substance use disorders. This may involve inpatient and/or outpatient care.\n\nDual Diagnosis\n\nMany of those suffering from addiction also suffer from mental or emotional illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or anxiety disorders. The Co-Occurring Disorders Program provides services for adults and adolescents with both mental health and substance use disorders.\n\nOpioid Addiction\n\nOpioid rehabs specialize in supporting those recovering from opioid addiction. They treat those suffering from addiction to illegal opioids like heroin, as well as prescription drugs like oxycodone. These centers typically combine both physical as well as mental and emotional support to help stop addiction. Physical support often includes medical detox and subsequent medical support (including medication), and mental support includes in-depth therapy to address the underlying causes of addiction.\n\nSubstance Abuse\n\nSubstance rehabs focus on helping individuals recover from substance abuse, including alcohol and drug addiction (both illegal and prescription drugs). They often include the opportunity to engage in both individual as well as group therapy.\n\nOutpatient\n\nCommQuest offers outpatient counseling services at five locations in Stark and Carroll Counties. All services are individualized and based on a comprehensive assessment, performed by either CommQuest or a referring agency. Outpatient services are available for both adults and adolescents by contacting CommQuest directly. The treatment is 1-2 times per week at any of their five locations, and they offer a group or individualized setting.\n\nIntensive Outpatient\n\nIntensive Outpatient programs are for those who want or need a very structured treatment program but who also wish to live at home and continue with certain responsibilities (such as work or school). Each session is 3 hours in length, they meet 3 or 5 days per week. The treatment runs for 4-5 weeks.\n\nAftercare Support\n\nCompleting a drug or alcohol rehab program shouldn't spell the end of substance abuse treatment. Aftercare involves making a sustainable plan for recovery, including ongoing support. This can include sober living arrangements like halfway houses, career counseling, and setting a patient up with community programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA).\n\nFamily Therapy\n\nResearch clearly demonstrates that recovery is far more successful and sustainable when loved ones like family members participate in rehab and substance abuse treatment. CommQuest offers a family support group for those seeking help and guidance with a loved one who is battling addiction to drugs and alcohol or currently going through a recovery program.\n\nGroup Therapy\n\nGroup therapy is any therapeutic work that happens in a group (not one-on-one). There are a number of different group therapy modalities, including support groups, experiential therapy, psycho-education, and more. Group therapy involves treatment as well as processing interaction between group members.\n\nIndividual Therapy\n\nIn individual therapy, a patient meets one-on-one with a trained psychologist or counselor. Therapy is a pivotal part of effective substance abuse treatment, as it often covers root causes of addiction, including challenges faced by the patient in their social, family, and work/school life.\n\nLife Skills\n\nLife skills trainings involve all the skills a person must have in order to function successfully in the world. These include time management, career guidance, money management, and effective communication. Truly successful addiction recovery is based on the ability to not only live substance-free, but to thrive. Life skills teaches the practical necessities of functioning in society, which sets clients up for success in life, and therefore sobriety.\n\nMotivational Interviewing\n\nMotivational Interviewing (MI) is a clinical approach to helping people with substance abuse issues and other conditions shift behavior in positive ways. It is more goal-oriented than traditional psychotherapy, as MI counselors directly attempt to get clients to consider making behavioral change (rather than wait for them to come to conclusions themselves). Its primary purpose is to resolve ambivalence and help clients become able to make healthy choices freely.\n\nTrauma Therapy\n\nTrauma therapy addresses traumatic incidents from a client's past that are likely affecting their present-day experience. Trauma is often one of the primary triggers and potential causes of addiction, and can stem from child sexual abuse, domestic violence, having a parent with a mental illness, losing one or both parents at a young age, teenage or adult sexual assault, or any number of other factors. The purpose of trauma therapy is to allow a patient to process trauma and move through and past it, with the help of trained and compassionate mental health professionals."
