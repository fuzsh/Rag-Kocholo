(Nasdaq:MIPS) aimed at expanding market acceptance of Linux in embedded systems by providing embedded Linux support for the MIPS architecture. As a result of this cooperative agreement, Lineo will optimize Embedix, Lineo's line of embedded Linux system software, for MIPS Technologies' MIPS32 and MIPS64 processor architectures and compatible embedded processor cores. Lineo will work to ensure that the related layers, operating system and tools of Embedix will support the MIPS Technologies processor architectures . This will give MIPS Technologies licensees and their customers a full-feature d, highly optimized embedded Linux solution. Additionally, Lineo joined the MIPS Alliance Program. \"With this agreement, MIPS Technologies and Lineo are positioned to drive growth in the embedded device market,\" said Bryan Sparks, CEO of Lineo, Inc. \"We see tremendous demand for embedded Linux, a low cost, highly reliable and well-supported operating system in embedded applications using MIPS-based processors.\" \"Our customers and licensees include some of the world's leading digital consumer, handheld PCs and communications and networking systems makers,\" said Brian Knowles, vice president of marketing at MIPS Technologies. \"Linux is becoming a more attractive option for them because it is robust and low cost. Lineo will help make this powerful operating system more readily available for developers of MIPS-based systems.\" The MIPS Alliance Program consists of premier third-party development tool and application vendors who have ported their specific value-added tools and/or applications to MIPS Technologies processors. \"This program gives users of the advanced MIPS32 and MIPS64 processor architectures and the processors that conform with those architectures, the development tools and software environments they need to create high performance, state-of-the-art embedded systems in record time,\" said Mark Otto, MIPS Alliance Program manager at MIPS Technologies.
