        "text": "A new drug-and-alcohol detox center opened Monday at Alliance Community Hospital.\n\nThe CommQuest Alliance Detox and Recovery Unit more than doubles the number of publicly funded in-patient detox beds in Stark County. Backers envision the unit as a treatment hub for surrounding counties facing an opioid-fueled overdose crisis that killed 4,050 Ohioans last year.\n\n\"You're adding capacity to the entire county system, and it allows people to get treatment closer to home,\" said John Aller, executive director of Stark County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery, one of the agencies funding the project.\n\nDetox is the first step in addiction treatment, during which a person withdraws from drugs or alcohol under medical supervision. The process can be unpleasant in the case of opioids or life-threatening when it involves alcohol or benzodiazepines, a class of drugs that includes Xanax, Valium and Klonopin.\n\nThe CommQuest Alliance Detox and Recovery Unit is in a secured section of the hospital's third floor. The unit has 16 detox beds and two 23-hour observation beds, where intoxicated clients can stay until they are ready for evaluation.\n\nCommQuest President and CEO Keith Hochadel said he hoped having the detox in a hospital setting makes it more comfortable for some clients.\n\n\"We're treating this as a medical condition, and we really believe it will encourage folks to go,\" Hochadel said. \"They can tell someone, 'I'm going to the hospital to get some help,' as opposed to, 'I'm going to go to detox.'\"\n\nClients may contact CommQuest by phone for admission to the detox unit or come in through the hospital's emergency department. The unit accepts clients with private insurance, Medicaid or who qualify for a Stark MHAR subsidy.\n\nThe detox unit doesn't treat medical issues, but the unit's doctor can see patients in the regular part of the hospital until they are stable enough to enter the unit, said Christy Loeffler-Augustine, a registered nurse, licensed counselor and director of CommQuest's opioid treatment program expansion.\n\nThe minimum length of stay in the detox unit is three to five days, but some clients could stay for up to two weeks, depending on the substance they were using, said Dr. Thomas Gibbs, medical director for the Alliance detox unit and CommQuest's Regional Center for Opiate Recovery in Massillon.\n\nThe unit has group and individual counseling sessions for clients and weekly education sessions for their families to dispel myths related to detox.\n\n\"Some family members may think someone comes to detox and, 'All right, great, they're fixed now,'\" Loeffler-Augustine said.\n\nA big focus of the unit is connecting clients with further treatment through CommQuest or other agencies when they're released.\n\n\"What we don't want to do is detox people and throw them out to the street,\" Gibbs said. \"That just leads to a revolving door-type of situation.\"\n\nCommQuest Services is leasing space for the detox unit from Alliance Community Hospital. The hospital had extra space after it closed its obstetrics unit last year, but the detox isn't in the same location, said Harry Paidas, the hospital's director of public relations and marketing.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services gave CommQuest $300,000 and Stark MHAR gave $200,000 for the unit's start-up costs, such as renovation, equipment, furnishings and medication.\n\nThe detox unit is located to serve clients from Alliance, Minerva, Malvern, Carrollton, Sebring, Damascus, Salem and southern Portage County.\n\nBefore the Alliance detox unit opened, eastern Stark residents had to travel to Canton or Massillon for detox services, and there were only 11 in-patient detox beds at county-funded agencies.\n\n\"It gives us another tool as a community to get them help that day, that night, whatever time it is,\" Hochadel said.\n\nThe Stark County Coroner's Office investigated 103 opioid-related deaths last year, and the need for treatment is high in the Alliance area.\n\nAlliance Municipal Judge Andrew Zumbar hears cases from the eastern side of the county. In the past three to five years, he said, there has been an increase in the use of heavier drugs, such as heroin and methamphetamine.\n\n\"I would say 20 years ago it was very, very rare to see a case involving heroin possession or heroin use, and now it is rare that we don't have a case or cases each day involving some degree of opioid use,\" said Zumbar, who welcomed additional detox resources in his community.\n\nThe crisis doesn't stop at the county line. Portage, Mahoning and Columbiana counties all have higher overdose fatality rates than Stark, according to the latest Ohio Department of Health statistics.\n\nGenerally, individuals without insurance coverage can get publicly subsidized treatment only in the county where they live. But with more people covered through Medicaid expansion, it's easier for them to cross county lines to get addiction treatment.\n\nThat's important in communities such as Sebring, which is a 40-minute drive from detox centers in eastern Mahoning County, but a 10-minute drive from Alliance Community Hospital.\n\n\"Transportation is the largest barrier for services to the western part of Mahoning County,\" said Brenda Heidinger, associate director of the Mahoning County Mental Health and Recovery Board.\n\nAddiction treatment officials in Portage and Columbiana counties anticipated their residents also would want to use the Alliance detox unit, and Aller said Stark MHAR was working with its counterparts to open the unit to out-of-county residents without insurance coverage.\n\n\"We really see that as an opportunity to provide regional access for people needing opiate treatment,\" Aller said.\n\nShane Hoover is a staff writer with The Canton Repository."
