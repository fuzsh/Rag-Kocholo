        "text": "MASSILLON A new residential center in the city means women who once waited weeks for drug and alcohol treatment can get help within hours.\n\nCommQuest Services opened its 17-bed Deliverance House II in April, and The Canton Repository recently toured the facility.\n\nDeliverance House II expands on treatment services offered by CommQuest’s Deliverance House in Canton, which has 16 residential treatment beds and eight beds for women transitioning from treatment to society.\n\nBefore Deliverance House II opened, local women had to wait a month or longer for residential treatment at CommQuest, the only such provider in Stark County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery’s network of care. Now, women can get a bed within 24 hours.\n\n“We’ve needed this really badly,” said April Pryor, director of Deliverance House II.\n\nNew home for recovery\n\nDeliverance House II is located in a former hotel at 412 Lincoln Way E that had been a homeless shelter and outpatient mental health clinic since 2011. The homeless shelter is still on the top floor, but the lower two floors have been converted into the treatment center. The mental health clinic moved down the street.\n\nCommQuest President and CEO Keith Hochadel said Massillon was a good place for Deliverance House II because the agency already owned the building and the location increased the geographical footprint of residential treatment in the county.\n\nWomen in the facility have to be at least 18 years old. The women in the current group of clients ranged in age from 20 to their late 40s, and were being treated for addiction to substances such as opioids, alcohol, meth and crack, Pryor said.\n\n“Primarily we’re looking for Stark County folks,” Hochadel added.\n\nMost of the women at Deliverance House II share their room with a fellow client, but there is one room that can hold a mother with a child younger than 5 years of age.\n\n“Having that child under the age of 5 is more incentive for the mom to come in because a lot of time the barrier to women getting into treatment is, ‘Who’s going to watch my children?’” Pryor said.\n\nDeliverance House II also has a group therapy room; a common room with desks, couches and soon to be a television; a laundry area; a chapel; a dining room and a commercial kitchen.\n\nThe rooms are sparsely decorated, but Pryor said she planned to use therapeutic art projects to lighten the space.\n\nThe Paul & Carol David Foundation, Massillon Community Charitable Fund and The Aultman Foundation contributed a total of $56,000 toward the project, and Stark MHAR provided another $125,000.\n\nProgram outline\n\nTreatment at Deliverance House II lasts 90 to 120 days. During the first 30 days, the staff takes the women everywhere, including medical appointments, court hearings or other places. They also are drug tested throughout treatment.\n\nAs the women make progress on their recovery and begin to build a network that will support their sobriety when they leave Deliverance House II, they earn more freedom.\n\nAfter residential care, the women get daily outpatient treatment Deliverance House II or at an agency closer to where they live.\n\n“It’s a step down without putting them just back on the streets,” Pryor said.\n\nDepending on the client, the cost of treatment is paid for by Medicaid, private insurance or Stark MHAR in the case of county residents who don’t have insurance.\n\nStark MHAR Executive Director John Aller estimated the agency would pay for 30 to 40 percent of Deliverance House II clients, which CommQuest estimated would surpass $200,000 next fiscal year.\n\nIncreasing capacity\n\nHaving Deliverance House II brings the number of treatment and transitional beds for adults and children in the county to around 135, and Stark MHAR will monitor demand to see if more beds are needed, Aller said.\n\n“When folks make a decision after being in their addiction for a period of time, to go into residential treatment, you have a window of opportunity to get them access,” Aller said.\n\nStark MHAR also is working to fund a sober house for women who finish residential treatment at Deliverance House II but are still getting outpatient services.\n\nReach Shane at 330-580-8338 or shane.hoover@cantonrep.com\n\nOn Twitter: @shooverREP\n\nTo reach Deliverance House II, call 330-452-9807.\n\nIf you or a family member are in crisis, call:\n\nOpiate Hotline at 330-454-HELP (4357) anytime\n\nCrisis Hotline and Mobile Response Team anytime at 330-452-6000\n\nDomestic Violence Help Line anytime at 330-453-SAFE (7233)\n\nHomeless Hotline at 330-452-4363\n\nCrisis Text Line, Text 4hope to 741 741 anytime\n\nTrevor Project Lifeline for LGBTQ youth anytime at 866-488-7386\n\nMilitary & Veterans Crisis Line anytime at 1-800-273-8255, press 1\n\nMilitary & Veterans Crisis Text Line anytime at 838255\n\nTo find mental health and addiction treatment resources, visit StarkMHAR.org/CareNetwork\n\nWhere to get help"
