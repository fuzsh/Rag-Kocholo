        "text": "CANTON With a new owner, the Metropolitan Centre building is getting a second chance to fulfill its potential as a viable complex in downtown.\n\nCommQuest, a Canton-based nonprofit social-service agency that specializes in substance-abuse treatment, took ownership of Metropolitan Centre earlier this year. The building, in the 600 block of Cleveland Avenue NW, has an array of tenants ranging from a nightclub to an outreach of Mercy Medical Center.\n\nIt was renovated in a swank fashion by its previous owner, Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority, which acquired the building in 2002 from a local Knights of Columbus unit.\n\nDespite the housing authority's efforts to rehabilitate and upgrade what had been a neglected complex, the effort struggled. Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority was not able to cover the expenses of maintaining the building with tenant fees. And the authority was rebuked by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for using money intended for housing to refurbish a commercial building.\n\nIt gives CommQuest three operating sites in or near downtown. The other two are in the 1300 block of Market Avenue N and next door to Metropolitan Centre, also in the 600 block of Cleveland Avenue NW.\n\nGrowing into new building\n\n\"This location allows us to grow our program. This is about expanding to meet the need for care,\" said Michael Garcar, director of strategic communications for CommQuest. \"Basically, that will allow us to expand our medication-assisted recovery clinic. That program is for individuals who are trying to recover from opiate addiction.\"\n\nMetropolitan Centre, which is about 60,000 square feet, is a union of what had been two side-by-side buildings. One portion is two stories while the other has four stories. CommQuest paid $1.75 million for the facility.\n\nCommQuest has moved some of its operations into the Metropolitan Centre.\n\n\"We were looking for space before this became available,\" said Keith Hochadel, president and chief executive officer for CommQuest. \"We have a commitment to here (downtown).\"\n\nCommQuest was created with the merger of Community Services and Quest Recovery & Prevention Services. It receives much of its funding support from Stark County Mental Health & Addiction Recovery. And presently, CoomQuest is the largest service providing agency receiving support from the Stark County funding board, according to Hochadel.\n\nThe tenants leasing space inside Metropolitan Centre now are Mercy Medical Center, Beyond Boundaries, Community Building Partnership, Stark County Vet Center. The Auricle night club operates in the basement level.\n\n\"The only tenant that is scheduled to leave is The Auricle,\" Hochadel said. \"We need the space for some programs and services. Originally, they were going to leave at the end of August. Where the Auricle is we will probably put some clinical work there. I am just not quite sure what we will put there.\"\n\nLooking for a partner\n\nMetropolitan Centre also has a banquet hall, or events center.\n\n\"We are still working out some details on what we will do with the events center,\" Hochadel said. \"We are actively seeking somebody that will help us lease and maintain that space.\"\n\nThe fourth floor was not fully renovated while Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority owned the complex. But CommQuest officials say they will find use the vacant fourth floor to house the agency's information technology, finance and compliance departments.\n\nWhen the Stark Metropolitan Housing Authority acquired Metropolitan Centre, Herman Hill was not the agency's executive director as he is now. Hill pointed out the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General did not approve of SMHA's use of the Metropolitan Centre.\n\n\"It didn't fit into my goals as executive director,\" said Hill, who became SMHA executive director in 2013. \"It served absolutely no purpose for residents. They had to subsidize it with public housing and capital funds. We were experiencing losses each month at the Metropolitan Centre.\"\n\nSo the decision was made to put the complex on the market.\n\n\"Proceeds from the sale are being held until we receive approval from HUD on how those funds should be used,\" Hill said. \"We cannot use it for any purpose until we receive approval from HUD.\"\n\nAnd Hill expects SMHA will wind up sending some or all the sale proceeds to HUD.\n\n\"They gave us those funds for public housing,\" Hill said. \"But we used those funds to rehab the Metropolitan Centre.\"\n\nDespite the financial drain Metropolitan Centre became for SMHA, CommQuest officials do not anticipate problems maintaining the complex.\n\n\"It is a sustainable building for us,\" Hochadel said.\n\nCommQuest received support from the following philanthropic organizations: Timken Foundation, Hoover Foundation, Sisters of Charity Foundation, Deuble Foundation and Stark County Foundation.\n\n\"We had considerable support from those foundations,\" Hochadel said. \"We couldn't have done this on our own. We wouldn't even have tried.\"\n\nReach Malcolm at 330-580-8305\n\nor malcolm.hall@cantonrep.com\n\nOn Twitter: mhallREP"
