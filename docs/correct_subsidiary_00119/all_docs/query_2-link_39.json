        "text": "JACKSON TWP. — The third annual Family-Friendly Workplace Awards presented Thursday by the United Way of Greater Stark County honored MAC Trailer, CommQuest Services and The Karcher Group.\n\nThe award-winning companies competed in business categories based on size.\n\nMAC Trailer won for companies with more than 500 employees, CommQuest Services won among companies with fewer than 500 but more than 50 employees, and The Karcher Group won among companies with fewer than 50 employees.\n\n“You lead by example every day, and we thank you for that,” said Maria Heege, president and CEO of the United Way of Greater Stark County.\n\nAbout 100 people attended the United Way’s Women United awards luncheon Thursday at Kent State University at Stark. Keynote speaker Meghan Cummings, executive director of the Women’s Fund of the Greater Cincinnati Foundation, congratulated the winners and discussed the importance of family-friendly policies.\n\nCummings summarized the foundation’s Employer Toolkit, which was provided to attendees. It covers the benefits and practices found to decrease employee turnover and increase retention and engagement — which in turn improves the greater community.\n\nShe encouraged companies to invest in the immediate needs of employees, providing upfront benefits rather than reimbursements or “regressive perks.” Such actions cost money, Cummings said, but they help employees be more productive and usually are similar to turnover expenses.\n\n“Those costs really add up,” she said.\n\nCummings ended with a question-and-answer session. Gary Conny, director of organizational development at MAC Trailer, asked how she would structure a position related to retention. Cummings said it should be centered on building trust with the workforce.\n\nMAC Trailer, an Alliance-area manufacturer of hauling trailers, was chosen for its “holistic” environment that includes a new employee assessment. The company also partners with Aultman Hospital for an on-site health clinic and with Alliance for Children Families for support services. The United Way’s awards announcement also noted the hiring of women in nontraditional roles.\n\nDennis Postiy, corporate vice president, said much of what Cummings said sounded familiar. There were a few new ideas, such as buying school supplies for employees’ children, that he might try to implement.\n\nMAC Trailer already offers to buy a pair of work boots for employees once a year, which lessens the burden for people who might have to choose between boots and other necessities. Postiy said helping employees maintain a work-life balance helps them be better employees.\n\n“We literally do preach it from Day One,” Postiy said.\n\nConny agreed and encouraged other businesses to examine their practices “to strengthen Stark County; to strengthen their business.”\n\nCommQuest Services was commended for offering flexible working schedules, and paid time off benefits, including a program allowing employees to donate their time to others. United Way also noted The Karcher Group’s flexible schedules, paid maternity and paternity leave, three-day company camping trip and other benefits.\n\nConference visits Alliance\n\nAlliance’s MAC Trailer and Trilogy Plastics were highlighted during a session of the Ohio Community Development Corporations’ annual conference in Stark County.\n\nConference attendees on Thursday took a bus tour to Alliance and visited MAC Trailer and heard from officials who led an extended meeting on job retention strategies.\n\nThe visit followed a session with Mark Plaster of Markwood Partners, who discussed how to engage employees and involve them more in the business.\n\nDuring the bus trip, and afterward at MAC, participants heard examples of the programs area businesses have launched and how to keep the momentum going."
