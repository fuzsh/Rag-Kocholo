        "text": "JACKSON TWP. — A new treatment center specializing in opioid addiction is open and looking for patients.\n\nCanton Comprehensive Treatment Center is in the back of an office building at 2520 Wales Ave. NW, just north of the Massillon city limits.\n\nThe center’s location is safe, discreet and accessible by bus, said clinic Director Pat Mason.\n\nCanton Comprehensive Treatment Center is offering counseling and buprenorphine prescriptions while it awaits a license from Ohio Mental Health and Addiction Services to operate as an opioid treatment program\n\nAn opioid treatment program, or OTP, provides medication-assisted treatment and counseling, and the multi-agency certification process takes several months to complete.\n\nThe only OTPs in Stark County are CommQuest Services facilities in Alliance, Canton and Massillon, according to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nOnce Canton Comprehensive Treatment Center is certified as an opioid treatment program, it will offer medication-assisted treatment using methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone. Methadone and buprenorphine will be dispensed on site. Naltrexone, known as the brand name Vivitrol, is a monthly injection.\n\nA software program called Methasoft allows the staff to track doses, medical records and whether a patient has been compliant with weekly counseling.\n\n“If they don’t show up for counseling, they’re not going to get their medication,” said Ruth DeLillo, the center’s nursing supervisor.\n\nThe center plans to become a Medicaid-approved provider, but it is operating on a cash basis for now: $150 for the first visit, including all assessments, and $100 a week thereafter.\n\n“We can extend a financial waiver for anyone who may not be able to afford it,” Mason said. “We don’t want finances to be a barrier to patients receiving treatment.”\n\nThe center is designed to treat as many as 650 patients. New patients get a physical, including testing for HIV and hepatitis. They also are assessed to determine the level of treatment they need.\n\n“It’s not cookie-cutter,” DeLillo said. “Everyone does not have the same plan.”\n\nThe clinic is looking to draw patients from Stark and Summit counties, as well as underserved rural counties to the south.\n\n“If you look at the map, there’s not a lot down there,” said Dr. Amy Shannon, the medical director.\n\nCanton Comprehensive Treatment Center is one of two clinics in Ohio run by Acadia Healthcare, a publicly traded company based in Franklin, Tenn. The other clinic is in Cleveland, and Acadia has plans to open a third in Mansfield, said Ronda Kearns-Strawser, the company’s regional director for Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nAcadia’s Comprehensive Treatment Center division operates 114 clinics in 28 states, serving 58,000 patients a day, according to the company.\n\nCanton Comprehensive Treatment Center accepts walk-ins from 7 to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nFor more information, call 234-262-1112 or 877-691-2366.\n\nReach Shane Hoover at 330-580-8338 or shane.hoover@cantonrep.com.
