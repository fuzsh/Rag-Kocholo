Utility assistance programs offer monetary assistance designed to help low-income individuals and families with getting caught up on utility payments. These organizations may provide financial assistance and grants for people who received shut off notices from their gas or utility companies. Funds for utility assistance may be limited, so contact these services if you’re struggling."
