For $25, participants can run or walk the gorgeous course which starts and ends at Glamorgan Castle, located at 200 Glamorgan St., Alliance, and traverses the University of Mount Union campus. A community resource fair will be held at Glamorgan Castle as part of the event, and participants are able to tour the castle at no additional cost.\n\nThe uplifting, family-oriented community event will benefit both organizations which share a dedication to build and maintain a healthy community.\n\n“We are thrilled to bring this event to Alliance this year to show the community how much support and how many resources are truly available to them so they can thrive and live their best lives,” said CommQuest CEO Elaine Russell Reolfi.\n\nCommQuest’s mission is to provide collaborative care and advocacy for people through three pillars of service: Mental Health, Addiction Recovery & Social Support. The Rotary Club of Alliance is dedicated to “Service Above Self” and the organization brings together business and professional leaders in order to provide community service, promote integrity, and advance goodwill, peace, and understanding in the world.\n\nBoth organizations would like to extend thanks to all the event sponsors this year: Aultman Alliance Community Hospital, Coastal Pet Products, Consumers National Bank, Huntington Bank, NAMI, New Day Counseling, Pauli Electric, Q-92 (WDJQ), The Repository, Robertson Heating Supply, SARTA, Stark County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery, Tanner Real Estate, Roy’s Wash and Lube, and United Way of Greater Stark County.\n\nAnyone who would like to be a 5k sponsor should call 330-994-1455 for information. Anyone in need of mental health, addiction recovery, or social support services, should visit CommQuest.org or call 330-455-0374."
