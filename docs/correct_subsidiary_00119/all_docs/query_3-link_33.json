        "text": "Please note that the Massillon Museum does not hold any archives related to patient records. You must contact the Ohio History Connection. We cannot help you acquire those records, as you must go through their research department directly. Learn more about the Ohio History Connection Archives and Research Library here.\n\nThe Massillon Museum preserves a small collection of photos of the Massillon State Hospital, which may be viewed here. Reproductions of these images are available upon request. Prices may be found here.\n\n*UPDATE 2016: The Massillon State Hospital admission records do exist in the collection of the Ohio History Connection, but are sealed to the public and may only be accessed by close relatives, but are available after that person has been gone for 50 years. Here is what their research department has to say:\n\nThe Ohio History Connection holds some records from some of Ohio’s state institutions. Please be aware that Mental Health records in the collections of the Ohio History Connection that relate to patient records are restricted by state law. As per Ohio Revised Code 5122.31, these collections can be accessed by the staff of the Ohio History Connection at the request of the closest living relative of a deceased patient, or if the patient has been deceased for 50 years or more. All restricted collections in our holdings carry a restriction notice in our catalog records. These record books and files are restricted from public review, even by the closest living relative. For this reason, we would prefer that you refer potential researchers directly to us.\n\nThe following collections from the Massillon State Hospital are restricted:\n\nIndex to Admissions, 1898-1911 (call#: State Archives Series 654)\n\nRecord of Treatments, 1920-1923, 1926-1927 (call#: State Archives Series 663)\n\nSuperintendent’s Correspondence, 1927-1930 (call#: State Archives Series 667)\n\nCase Record Books, 1898-1919 (call#: State Archives Series 697)\n\nOther Resources available online: For a full WorldCat listing of records related to the Massillon State Hospital, click here.\n\nHistory clippings, articles, and book excerpts are available on our website here.\n\nMassillon State Hospital 1908 Annual Report by the Board of Trustees and Officers of the Massillon State Hospital to the Governor of the State of Ohio.\n\nThe former State Hospital grounds are owned in part by the City of Massillon, Quest Recovery Services (CommQuest), and by Heartland Behavioral Center. Heartland only holds patient records for the last 10 years, and are not available to the public. The Massillon Museum does not have any records of residents. You may wish to read the Mental Health Records: An Introduction for Researchers by the Ohio History Connection.\n\nIf you are interested in the history of mental hospital facilities in the United States and Ohio, this is a great article from the Ohio Department for Mental Health.\n\nAnother way to track down your relatives' information is through the Stark County Recorder's Office. There is a complete listing of places to obtain vital information, including birth certificates, death certificates, and marriage certificates.\n\nPhotographs of the State Hospital: The Massillon Museum preserves a small collection of photos of the Massillon State Hospital, which may be viewed here. Reproductions of these images are available upon request."
