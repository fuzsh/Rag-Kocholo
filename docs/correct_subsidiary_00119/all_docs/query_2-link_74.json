        "text": "6. Common Questions:\n\n6.1. How does the licensing work?\n\nThe software is licensed on a per CD/DVD or USB media storage device basis. Each license allows you to use the program from a separate CD/DVD or USB device. For example, if you want to use the program to wipe five computers concurrently, you would need five CDs or DVDs or USB devices (or combination of the three not exceeding five), and therefore need a five-user license.\n\n6.2. How is the data erased?\n\nHard disk eraser Active@ KillDisk communicates with the system hardware device directly. The Free version erases data by overwriting all addressable locations on the drive with zeros.\n\nHard disk eraser Active@ KillDisk Professional version suggests several methods for data destruction. For example, in US DoD 5220.22-M method it overwrites all addressable storage and indexing locations on the drive three times: with zeros (0x00), complement (0xFF), and random characters. It then verifies all writing procedures. This complies with the US DoD 5220.22-M security standard.\n\n6.3. What is the difference between the Site and Enterprise license?\n\nA Site License allows for unlimited usage of the program at one physical location, whereas an Enterprise License allows unlimited usage at any of the purchasing companies locations worldwide.\n\n6.4. Which operating systems are supported by Active@ KillDisk?\n\nHard disk eraser Active@ KillDisk for Windows can be launched and work under all Windows operating system family, includint Windows Servers.\n\nHard disk eraser Active@ KillDisk for Windows can be also launched from the pre-installed on media storage device operating system (WinPE).\n\nActive@ KillDisk for Linux can be launched and work under different Linux versions (OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora, Oracle, â¦). Required Linux graphical environment: KDE or Gnome, Linux Kernel 2.x or higher, and shared libraries for Qt v.4.x to be installed.\n\nAs it can be installed easily onto a bootable CD/DVD or USB card, it does not matter which operating system is installed on the machine's hard drive. If you can boot from the boot CD/DVD/USB, you can detect and erase any drives independent of the installed operating system. This way you can easily erase UNIX, Linux and MacOS X partitions and disks.\n\n6.5. Is Active@ KillDisk compatible with Macintosh computers?\n\nYou cannot run Active@ KillDisk in the old Mac OS environment (based on PowerPC architecture). However, the most recent Apple computers (iMac running MacOS X) are based on the Intel architecture. In this case, it is possible to boot from Active@ Boot Disk using a CD, DVD or USB device. To do so, hold the Option key down when starting the computer.\n\n6.6. What to do if I cannot boot from a USB?\n\nThere are many possible reasons that you cannot boot from a USB / floppy. Please consult this troubleshooting chart:\n\nTroubleshooting Floppy Disk Problems\n\nRead here\n\nProblem Solution Error message \"bad command or file name\" You can use our KillDisk Bootable Floppy Creator to make a bootable USB: www.killdisk.com\n\nTo use KillDisk USB / floppy creator:\n\nFrom the link, save \"killdiskfloppysetup.exe\" file to your Desktop.\n\nInsert an empty USB / floppy disk in the USB / floppy drive.\n\nOn your Desktop, double-click killdiskfloppysetup.exe and follow all instructions.\n\nWhen you purchase Active@ KillDisk Professional version, you receive the file \"kd-setup.zip\".\n\nDouble-click this file and copy all the extracted flies to the USB / floppy disk. Make sure that you overwrite the file \"killdisk.exe\" with the registered version.\n\nRestart your PC using the bootable USB / floppy.\n\nUSB / floppy disk is not bootable or damaged With the USB in drive A:, verify whether or not system files (COMMAND.COM, etc.) are located on USB / floppy.\n\nIf the disk directory can be read and system files appear by name, some files on the USB / floppy may be damaged, or the surface of the USB may be damaged.\n\nOn a DOS or Windows PC, run SCANDISK.EXE to check for damaged areas on the USB / floppy surface.\n\nAlternately, prepare and test another bootable USB / floppy disk.\n\nFor more instructions, see chapter 3: Running Active@ KillDisk. Machine has boot priority for Hard Disk Drives, or another device set higher than for USB / floppy Drives. Parameters that are set in low-level setup are written to the machine's BIOS.\n\nTo change the boot priority:\n\nOpen the low-level setup utility, usually by pressing F1 or Escape on the keyboard during PC startup.\n\nUse the arrow keys to locate the section about Boot device priority. This section will allow you to set the search order for types of boot devices. When the screen opens, a list of boot devices appears. Typical devices on this list will be Hard Drives, CD ROM drives, USB / floppy Drives and Network Boot option.\n\nIf the USB / floppy device has been disabled, enable it (provided you have a USB disk installed).\n\nThe priority should indicate that the USB device is the number one device the BIOS consults when searching for boot instructions.\n\nIf USB Drives is at the top of the list, that is usually the indicator.\n\nSave and exit the setup utility.\n\n6.7. Will I be able to use my Hard Disk Drive after Active@ KillDisk erase operation?\n\nYes. To be able to use the HDD again you need to:\n\nRepartition the hard drive using a standard utility like FDISK.\n\nReformat partitions using a standard utility like FORMAT.\n\nReinstall the Operating System using a bootable CD/DVD-ROM.\n\n6.8. I cannot boot from the CD/DVD. What should I do next?\n\nYour computer may have boot priority for Hard Disk Drives, or another device set higher than boot priority for CD/DVD device.\n\nParameters that are set in low-level setup are written to the machine's BIOS.\n\nTo change the boot priority:\n\nOpen the low-level setup utility, usually by pressing F1, F2, F10 or ESC on the keyboard during startup.\n\nUse the arrow keys to locate the section about Boot device priority. This section will allow you to set the search order for types of boot devices. When the screen opens, a list of boot devices appears. Typical devices on this list will be hard drives, CD or DVD devices, floppy drives and network boot option.\n\nIf the CD or DVD device has been disabled, enable it (provided you have a device installed). The priority should indicate that the CD/DVD device is the number one device the BIOS consults when searching for boot instructions. If the CD/DVD device is at the top of the list that is usually the indicator.\n\nSave and exit the setup utility.\n\n6.9. Does KillDisk shorten SSD lifetime by overwriting several times?\n\nNo, because:\n\nWindows OS writes to HDD much more than KillDisk (DoD 3 passes are nothing, comparing to Windows caching activity)\n\nThis applied mostly to old-style flash memory-based SSD which almost not manufactured anymore\n\nAny storage media (SSD, HDD, Flash Card, etcâ¦) has limits on usage (writes number), and the more you write, the more chances that, for example HDD Head touches the plate and thus producing bad sectors\n\n6.10. I need to DOD a fiber channel san and I am wondering if you support that and if there is some info around the process to do it.\n\nIf your BIOS and Operating System (DOS or Windows) detect a SAN device and display it properly in BIOS (for DOS) or Computer Management Panel (Windows), KillDisk is able to see such devices as well and to erase them properly.\n\nHow to store certificate and log file to a network location?\n\nIf you mapped a network share before launching KillDisk using operating systemâs standard dialogs, this network share should be accessible in the list of locations in Save As dialogs.\n\nAnother option is to map a network share when operating the KillDisk:\n\nClick Map Network Shareâ¦ from the File menu\n\nType connection parameters: drive letter (or mount point on Linux), network share full path, user account and password for the account\n\nClick Connect button.\n\nIf all parameters are correct, network share should be mapped and available in Save As dialogs. All typed parameters stored to KILLDISK.INI file, and network share mapping will be restored when you launch KillDisk the next time."
