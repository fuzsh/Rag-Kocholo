        "text": "By Robert Keenan, Managing Editor\n\nAfter years of R&D, silicon germanium (SiGe) process technology has become a viable solution for developing ICs for the wireless market, such as cellular handsets. Therefore, manufactures, such as IBM (Armonk, NY), CommQuest (Encinitas, CA), and Harris Semiconductor (Melbourne, FL) have started to release solutions that employ this process technology.\n\nLate last week, Temic Semiconductors (Heilbronn, Germany) joined IBM, CommQuest, and Harris in the SiGe market with the release of a new power amplifier for GSM applications.\n\nTemic's TST0912 IC is a +3 VDC solution specifically designed for applications operating in the 900 MHz band. Therefore, it is well suited for GSM manufacturers developing handsets for the European market.\n\nAccording to Domink Winau, Temic's vice president of communications ICs, the SiGe process provides three main benefits to power amplifier designs. The first is cost. SiGe can be developed using standard CMOS fab equipment. By using standard equipment, manufacturers can reduce manufacturing cost and, in turn, reduce overall chip cost.\n\nIntegration is another benefit of the SiGe process. By using a SiGe process, manufacturers can integrate more passive functionality on chip. This reduces overall pin count on the overall system PCB and overall system cost.\n\nThe final benefit is output power. By turning to a SiGe process, manufacturers can develop products that offer higher output power levels. For example, the TST0912 delivers a +35 dBm maximum dBm output power. This increased power total can lead to better service quality and less dropped calls in a wireless handset.\n\nThe specs\n\nIn addition to offering a +35 dBm maximum output power, the new amplifier is equipped with a 50% power-added efficiency (PAE) and +30 dB dB gain. It also offers a power down mode that cuts power consumption to under 10 ÂµA.\n\nThe TST0912 is supplied in a PSSOP-16 package with a heat slug. It is available now for $6.20 in 1,000 unit quantities."
