Chairman Thompkinsstated that he was perfectly fine with hearing from bothfirms and did not hear anything to deviate from thecurrent agenda. Chairman Thompkins reminded theboard that our Investment Consultants and our Actuaryleft the organization they used to work with and theBoard decided to continue the relationship with them at anew organization because they believed it to be in thebest interest of the Trust. All Board members agreed thatboth firms should be heard. Chairman Thompkins statedthat they will each have 15 minutes for a presentation,followed by 10 minutes for questions and answers. Aftera brief break, the Board heard a presentation from bothfirms. Trustee Simmons arrived prior to thepresentations. After some discussion, Chief AccountantEnrique Mesa stated that he would lean towards the teamof Mr. Anthony Brunson because he has dealt with Mr.Brunson and his staff not only as presenters but they havesat with the GESE staff and reviewed the paperwork. 3\n\nP:24\n\nThey know the GESE accounts and how they operate sothere would be no learning curve. Treasurer, ChrisRecicar stated that he agreed with Mr. Mesa. Mr. Recicaradded that the city wanted to implement GASB 67 and68 this year, although they do not have to implementGASB 68 until next year. Trustee Sharpe stated that thedeadline to give the information to the city was in earlyDecember.

Ms.Elenberg replied that they were about to start their 10thGESE audit. Trustee Fernandez moved that based onwhat he heard from staff and questions from other trusteemembers and whereas the Sharpton Group describedthemselves as being evaluators the Brunson Group wereauditors. If the job that we have in front of us requiresauditors I move that we terminate the Sharptoncontract and enter into a contract with AnthonyBrunson, P.A. Group for the reasons I have given.Vice-Chair Cox seconded the motion. Some discussiontook place. Chairman Thompkins asked that in as muchas the Sharpton Group no longer exists do we have toterminate Sharpton and Brunson. Mr. Silver replied thathe did not think that we had to terminate them basedupon his opinion that the contract has self- terminatedand is no longer in existence by virtue of the fact thatthere has been a change. Mr. Silver suggested 4\n\nP:25\n\namending the motion to state that we are entering intoa contract with Anthony Brunson, P.A. TrusteeFernandez and Vice-Chair Cox agreed to theamendment.

Whatwe owe Anthony Brunson, P.A. is $16,500 less than the$62,000 total cost for the audit. Mr. Silver stated thatone of the elements in the engagement letter or contractwould be the cost. We also want to make sure they havean errors and omission insurance policy.

The U.S. economyrebounded smartly from a surprising contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and the fragile economic recovery showed signs of renewedstrength. U.S. real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 4.6% in the second quarter, a stunning reversal from the -2.1%rate seen in the first quarter. The unemployment rate has fallen from 6.7% in December to 6.1% in August, a level last seen in mid-2008.Home prices have pushed higher for five straight months while the S&P CaseSchiller 20-city Home Price Index was up 2.7% for the threemonths ending July, 2014.Equities: The Standard & Poorâs 500 Index, with its large-company bias, was up 1.1% for the quarter. Large capitalization stocks dramatically outperformed smaller shares with the Wilshire Large-Cap Index up 0.8% versus a loss of -6.2% for the Wilshire US Small-Cap Index. The Wilshire US Micro-Cap Index was down -7.3% for the quarter. Results for growth stocks versus value during the third quarter were mixed as growth led in the large-cap segment (Wilshire US Large-Cap Growth, 1.5%; Wilshire US Large-Cap Value, 0.3%), but trailed value stocks within small caps (Wilshire US Small-Cap Growth, -6.7%; Wilshire US Small-Cap Value, -5.8%). Not surprisingly, sector performance in the Wilshire 5000 was mixed during the quarter, with exactly five sectors up and five down. Health Care and Technology were the clear winners, up 4.2% and 3.8%, respectively. Telecom Services (1.7%) and Consumer Staples (1.5%) also produced solid gains. Energy was the primary laggard, down -8.7% for the quarter after leading all sectors during the second quarter. Utilities (-4.7%) and Industrials (-2.5%) were other notable weak performers.Fixed Income: The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened somewhat over the third quarter; yields on paper below one year in maturity as well as rates beyond ten years moved lower, while rates on intermediate-term securities rose slightly. The yield on two- year U.S. Treasuries rose 0.1% to 0.6%, while the bellwether 10-year Treasury yield barely nudged downward to 2.5%; at the long end of the yield curve, 30-year Treasuries drifted 0.1% lower to 3.2%. Longer-term bonds got a performance boost over the third quarter relative to shorter paper (Barclays 1-3 Year Treasury, 0.0%; Barclays Long Treasury, 2.7%).Alternatives: The hedge-fund industry managed a record $2.82 trillion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $18 billion according to HFR. Many pension-fund managers across the US are rethinking their investments in hedge funds in the wake of a retreat by the California Public Employeesâ Retirement System.
