        "text": "What is the “Better Way to Give” Initiative?\n\nThe City of Canton recognizes that many individuals who ask for money in public places, such as intersections, sidewalks and in front of businesses, can be facing significant challenges like hunger, unemployment, substance abuse, homelessness and other issues. These issues are complex and require smart, holistic solutions. Giving directly to individuals can provide temporary relief, but that does not address the root cause of their struggles. Instead, giving to community organizations that provide structured support can help these individuals move toward a brighter and better future.\n\nThe “Better Way to Give” initiative tackles the issue of panhandling and gives some assurance to anyone that donates that their donations are contributing directly to local charities. Any funds donated will be used to provide vouchers for meals, tanks of gas, or other financial assistance to individuals within the City of Canton that genuinely need help. The City of Canton and Stark County have a number of highly reputable organizations that work every day to meet the needs of those in crises throughout our area, making a positive and long-lasting impact on the lives of those individuals.\n\nSay No to Panhandling - There’s a Better Way to Give!"
