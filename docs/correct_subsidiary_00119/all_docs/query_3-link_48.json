        "text": "Meet Olivia, a resilient and determined woman whose unwavering spirit and strength inspire those around her. In the face of significant health challenges and the devasting loss of her beloved mother, Olivia refused to let adversity define her. Instead, she embraced her grief and health struggles as catalysts for growth, propelling her to reclaim her life and career.\n\nAfter getting treatment for her depression, Olivia was eager to get back to work and sought out assistance from CommQuest Services, Inc. in 2010. She met with Phillip Paschal, an Employment Specialist at CommQuest Services, Inc. Together they worked on preparing to get Olivia back to work.\n\nThroughout the years, Olivia worked at various jobs despite blindness in one eye, diabetes, and throat cancer. Her jobs included cleaning, working in fast food, and holding a position at a retirement village. When her mother passed away, Olivia became depressed and was temporarily unable to work.\n\nIn 2017, Olivia had quadruple bypass surgery and was unable to work. However, throughout her recovery, she continued to work with Phillip. Eventually, Phillip connected Olivia with Christine Crine, who was a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor with Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities (OOD). Christine helped Olivia find a job at Coastal Pets Products in January 2020. However, Olivia became ill with COVID and was hospitalized for five weeks. Costal Pets Products held her job for her, but Olivia decided to resign due to a long recovery period, including a stay in a nursing home and outpatient physical therapy.\n\nThrough all her struggles, Olivia was determined to go back to work. “Olivia never gave up,” said Phillip. “She is a great client and great to work with. She has a great sense of humor that makes time pass quickly on the job,” he added.\n\nIn October 2022, Olivia began working with Erika Salewsky, OOD Senior Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor. Olivia was hired as a pizza prep at Little Caesars Pizza in North Canton, Ohio a few months later, working three days a week. Phillip helped Olivia become acclimated to the job. Erika provided bus passes to help Olivia get back and forth to work.\n\n“Olivia is very reliable,” said Jermain Davenport, Manager at Little Caesars Pizza. “She outworks the younger people.”\n\nOlivia said, “Work is recovery. You get to meet different people and learn new things.” “I’m still learning at the age of 72,” she added.\n\n“It has been my pleasure to work with Olivia,” said Erika. “She is a very motivated woman, and her outlook on life is nothing short of inspiring. While she has had her past struggles, we can all learn from her sense of humor and optimism toward the future.”\n\nIf you or someone you know has a disability and would like to work, visit OODWorks.com or call 800-282-4536.\n\nNational Rehabilitation Awareness Week\n\nIn recognition of the benefits of rehabilitation and the successes of those who have received treatment through all forms of rehabilitation, the National Rehabilitation Awareness Foundation recognizes National Rehabilitation Awareness Week during the third full week in September every year. This year, National Rehabilitation Awareness Week is September 18-24.\n\nOOD is proud to celebrate National Rehabilitation Awareness Week to highlight the positive impact of rehabilitation. During this week, we reflect on the remarkable outcomes that individuals achieve through the power of rehabilitation, and we reaffirm our commitment to transforming lives through Vocational Rehabilitation.\n\nVisit our website to learn more about OOD’s services for individuals with disabilities.

His willingness to problem-solve shone brightly when he partnered with OOD to lead an effort to create a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) program tailored for individuals who are Deaf. Through his unwavering commitment and advocacy, Jack broke down barriers and opened new doors of opportunity for the Deaf community to pursue careers in the trucking industry.\n\n“Jack carved a path of profound impact and lasting influence within the Deaf community,” said Kevin Miller, OOD Director. “We celebrate the legacy he leaves behind as a reminder to all of us to be passionate about our work with individuals with disabilities.”\n\nIn addition to his family and friends, Jack will be missed by TRAID staff, the Deaf community, OOD, and many more. His leadership will continue to inspire perseverance in creating positive change.\n\nAll About Accessibility: Deaf Services\n\nSeptember is Deaf Awareness Month, and the International Week of the Deaf begins September 20, providing an opportunity to foster understanding, inclusivity, and communication for the Deaf community.\n\nFor more than 30 years, OOD has served Ohioans who are Deaf, DeafBlind, or hard of hearing through partnerships with community entities throughout the state, often referred to as Community Centers for the Deaf.
