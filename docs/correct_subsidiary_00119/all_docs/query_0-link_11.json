        "text": "A joint development effort between CommQuest Technologies and Hewlett-Packard Company yielded what is being called the wireless industry's first turnkey solution for in-line production testing. This production process combines HP's TS-5500 test platform and handset-fixture solution with CommQuest customized test software to reduce the time required to ramp production. By bundling custom test software optimized for its chipsets with an HP test platform, CommQuest eliminates the costly and time-consuming software-design process for its handset manufacturing customers.\n\nAt the heart of the HP TS-5500 is a set of optimized GSM or CDMA tests, measurements and utilities that work with Microsoft Windows NT-based software test executive. The software, integrated with system-level hardware integration, allows test departments and systems integrators to leapfrog the test-system development process.\n\nThe CommQuest production test solution is an enhancement to CommQuest's Total System Solution, which allows handsets to be designed, produced and brought to market faster and more cost-effectively than ever before. Among those benefiting from CommQuest's Total System Solution are OEMs with limited in-house wireless systems design capabilities and expertise.\n\nCommQuest Technologies is a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM specializing in the development of Total System Solution chipsets and software for digital communications applications."
