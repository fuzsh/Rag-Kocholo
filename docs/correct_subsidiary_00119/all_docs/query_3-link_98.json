        "text": "CANTON, Ohio (March 19, 2024) – CommQuest Services is thrilled to announce the third annual Taste of Hope, a remarkable event dedicated to supporting its mission of saving lives through mental health, addiction recovery, and social support services. This year’s event is held at the Metropolitan Centre (601 Cleveland Ave NW, Canton), on Thursday, April 25 at 6 p.m., and it promises to be an unforgettable evening featuring Food Network Champion, Culinary Olympian, and 3x ACF Chef of the Year recipient Chef Stephan C. Baity, delectable offerings from some of the finest local restaurants, live entertainment, and an exciting auction.\n\n“We invite the community to both celebrate and fuel this mission, which is a lifeline to tens of thousands of people in our community,” said Sue Grabowski, Desidara CEO and event co-chair.\n\nHighlighting the evening will be the recognition of community advocates, The Timken Foundation of Canton and Donna (Francis) Shadle for their exceptional efforts in supporting those in need and furthering the mission of CommQuest.\n\n“We are continuously impressed by the passion the CommQuest team has for the mission,” said Roger Duffy, CommQuest board member and event co-chair. “Their empathy fuels this important work and allows us to continue serving the community.”\n\nTickets for Taste of Hope are priced at $125, with only 200 spots available. Tickets can be purchased starting today at www.commquest.org or by calling 330.994.1455. Additionally, an online auction will be held beginning on April 11th and conclude at the end of the event. This auction will be open to the general public whether they have a ticket to the event or not.\n\nCommQuest Services is dedicated to building a community where all people can thrive. Taste of Hope is their largest fundraiser of the year, and the community’s support last year was truly remarkable.\n\n“We’re here for the pregnant woman fighting addiction, the man with bipolar disorder who is trying to maintain steady employment, and the parents with little ones who are seeking stable housing,” said Elaine Russell Reolfi, CommQuest CEO. “Our team of more than 300 professionals save lives and help people live their best lives, and we thank the community members who help make that possible.”"
