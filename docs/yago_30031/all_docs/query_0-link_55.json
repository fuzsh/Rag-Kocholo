        "text": "Rich in heritage, the luxurious hotel is located in the grounds of the Sra Pathum Palace – a former residence of Her Majesty Queen Savang Vadhana, consort of King Rama V and grandmother of the late King Rama IX. Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok provides every celebrating couple with a complete sense of nobility, gracing every engagement and wedding occasion with a wealth of amazing memories to be treasured for a lifetime.\n\n“We work hard to ensure that every couple receives a genuine royal welcome and that this special feeling is maintained throughout their stay,” explains director of Groups and Events Lalidapun Chavananand. “We have a very experienced team that specialises in engagement and wedding parties of all sizes and for all religious denominations, ensuring that every celebration is truly unforgettable. They understand the importance of crafting the dream wedding for each couple and this includes ensuring that they appreciate and enjoy the sense of exclusivity and graciousness which is present throughout Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok,” she adds.\n\nThe hotel’s majestic entrance ensures a graceful and grand arrival. The lobby, with its dramatically high ceiling, luxury fittings and majestic spiral staircase, enhances the sense of grandeur with delightful European music playing softly in the background to create an elegant feel. The staircase is a popular location for photographs as the bride and groom make their way to the grand setting of the Chadra Ballroom. Every wedding day is an occasion to be remembered by family and friends as well as the bride and groom.\n\nThe Sra Pathum Palace is now the home of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and was previously home to Her Royal Highness Princess Srinagarindra Boromarajajonani, the Princess Mother. The Palace has hosted two glorious royal weddings. The first wedding was the marriage of Princess Srinagarindra Boromarajajonani and Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla Nagarindra in 1919. The second occasion was in April 1950, when the Palace was the venue for the magnificent wedding of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit."
