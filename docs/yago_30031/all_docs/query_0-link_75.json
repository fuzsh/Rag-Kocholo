        "text": "King Chulalongkorn intended to give his son, Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, a plot of land on Pathumwan Road for the building of a private residence. As the prince was still a student abroad the plan was not realised until the reign of King Vajiravudh, when land was granted to the prince in 1914.[1]\n\nQueen Savang Vadhana the prince's mother moved out of the Grand Palace and built a residence on the land. Under the queen's supervision the palace design and construction was undertaken by the Italian Paolo Remidi. The design of the palace was European, the exterior was painted in bright colours to protect the building from heat.[2] The construction was completed in 1916."
