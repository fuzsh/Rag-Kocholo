He was the ninth monarch of the Chakri dynasty and thus had the official title of King Rama IX. From 1987 he was known as King Bhumibol the Great.[1]\n\nBiography\n\nBhumibol was born on 5 Dec 1927 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.[2]\n\nFollowing the short reign and early death of his brother, King Ananda Mahidol, Bhumibol restored the power of the Thai monarchy and became deeply respected. He was known for his interest in rural development, and was almost always seen with a camera which he used to record the conditions he found.[3]\n\nBumibol died on 13 Oct 2016 in Bangkok[4] but was not laid to rest until 26 October 2017, when he was cremated in a Buddhist ceremony in the capital.
