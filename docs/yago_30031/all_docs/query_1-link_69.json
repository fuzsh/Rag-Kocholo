King Ananda Mahidol, who has succeded to the throne as a 9-year old, died under very mysterious circumstances in 1946, at the age of 20. The cremation ceremony was long delayed, as Thailand suffered political turmoil and King Bhumibol Adulyadej finished his education in Switzerland, but was celebrated with much aplomb before the equally lavish Coronation of the King weeks later."
