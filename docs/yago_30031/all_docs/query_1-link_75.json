        "text": "Asunrise stroll through Klongsan’s maze of inter woven lanes, sois, and khlongs lures you deep into the heart of Thailand. In the historic communities between Icon Siam and Memorial Bridge, Bangkok’s soul unfolds, step by step.\n\nIn fact, Thonburi is Bangkok. Some say the name ‘Bangkok’ refers to a village near Bangkok Noi and Bangkok Yai, where almost 500 years ago, it was the logistical stop for ships en-route to the capital Ayutthaya.\n\n‘Bang Ko’ translates as ‘island village,’ a settlement almost completely surrounded by water, recalling when the Chao Phraya river followed a completely different course than today. The Ayutthaya Kings re-engineered and short-cut the lower Chao Phraya river course to accelerate trade and improve tax and defense efficiency.\n\nIn 1538 King Chairachathirat (1534-1546), renowned for his early modern warfare technology and Portuguese trade, dug the first ‘Khlong Lat’ (short cut canal), reducing the sailing time to Ayutthaya by almost one day. The powerful currents soon widened the short cut to become the new main channel.\n\nSo successful was the operation, that future kings followed with more Klong Lats in 1542, 1636, 1722, and 1874. As Chao Phraya sailing times quickened, and Siam connected with foreign trade, Thonburi became a powerful tax collection port and customs office.\n\nWhen Ayutthaya was razed to the ground in 1767, Thonburi was the obvious choice for King Taksin to rebuild the nation’s capital. The 280- year-old Gong Wu Shrine, the oldest of its kind in Thailand, is said to be where King Taksin prayed before battle. Today it is a bright, wonderfully decorated temple bordered by My Grandparents House café, and Thang Nguan Hah Vintage House, the first fish sauce factory in the country.\n\nFrom 1768 Khlongsan evolved with communities of Portuguese, Siamese, Chinese, Indian and Muslim merchants who supported King Taksin’s exploits. Indian Muslim spice and goldsmith traders are located around Changnak Alley, the scene of James Bond’s 1997 ‘Tomorrow Never Dies’ epic motorcycle chase.\n\nHere too are the Wanglee family’s Lhong 1919 trading wharf and Mazou Temple, Huok Li House, and Lanthong Salt Production Warehouse. Step into the smallest lanes of Chiang Mai Rd. Intersection Community, Tha Din Daeng Soi 14/16 Community, Soi Chang Nak Sapan Yao Community for a special glimpse into Khlongsan’s people and heritage.\n\nThe riverside Kuwatin Islam Mosque tells the story of two of Thonburi’s most significant families: the Bunnag’s of Persian origins, and The Nana’s of Indian decent.\n\nBy the nineteenth century, the House of Bunnag was perhaps the most influential family in Siam. Favored by Chakri monarchs, the family monopolized high-ranking titles and developed much of Thonburi’s economy and culture. ​"
