        "text": "A distinguished lineage\n\nBhumibol Adulyadej was not born in Thailand. He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 5, 1927 at 8:45 am. Many years later, in 1960, Dr. W. Stewart Whittemore would confess to the Boston Globe that he was, indeed, “a very good baby.”\n\nAnd in October 1948 the king suffered a serious car accident in Lausanne, Switzerland, which led to him losing his right eye. He recovered from the accident at the University Hospital of Lausanne, (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois), but this accident changed his life: during his stay in the hospital, he received frequent visits from Sirikit, who at that time was a young noblewoman close to the family. These visits were essential to cement their relationship, and love was born. Their wedding, performed by Bhumibol’s elderly grandmother, Savang Vadhana, was described by The New York Times as “the shortest and simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of golden elephants and white umbrellas.\n\nThis decision, made by many Buddhist men after the loss of a close relative, culminated in his ordination by the Supreme Patriarch on October 22, 1956 at the Royal Chapel of the Emerald Buddha, located within the Grand Palace. During her spiritual retreat, Sirikit assumed her responsibilities, being named regent. In recognition of her role, she was honored with the title of Queen Regent (Somdej Phra Boromarajininat).\n\nBhumibol Adulyadej’s saxophone, exhibited at the National Museum in Bangkok\n\nDuring his youth, Bhumibol showed a deep interest in firearms. He had a collection that included a carbine, a Sten pistol and two automatic pistols in his bedroom. Together with his elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, they used to use the palace gardens for shooting practice. And when it came to music, Bhumibol was a talented jazz saxophonist and composer, exploring styles such as Dixieland and New Orleans jazz. He also mastered the clarinet, trumpet, guitar and piano. He composed a total of 49 works, including popular pieces such as “Candlelight Blues,” “Love at Sundown” and “Falling Rain.”"
