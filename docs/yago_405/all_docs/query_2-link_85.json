        "text": "From long red capes to creatures of the night. From sadistic leather clad demons to timeless lovers stuck in the past. Vampires have danced across the silver screen time and time again; so many times it’s been combined with just about every genre under the sun (rather moon.) One of the least combined genres with vampires however, is the western. This is a true shame in my opinion because it is one of the genre’s that has the most in common with vampire films. A lone outcast with nothing in common with society, lots of long coats and wide brimmed hat imagery. One of my favourite films under both these paradigm (and in fact one of the only 4 Vampire Westerns I could find) is the film From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) by the filmmaker without a cause, Robert Rodriguez. I will be delving in to the bone and gristle of what makes this film a perfect blend of both genres.\n\nThe film actually lulls you into a false sense of security, fooling you into thinking it’s a modern outlaw film, following two gun toting brothers traveling across Texas to the Mexican border as they transport an unknown bounty to be exchanged for a large amount of cash. It’s made perfectly clear as the film progresses that one of these brothers (Quentin Tarintino) has a severe mental problem and is constantly the shortcoming of the older brother (George Clooney) as he fulfils his bloodlust, killing and raping several of their hostages. At the same time you follow a father and his two kids traveling across Texas in a motorhome. You come to learn the father is an ex-priest who stopped believing in God after his wife died. Ultimately, as two narratives in films often do, the characters meet at the half hour mark. The brothers need them as hostages again to get across the border and they take them at gunpoint. The real twist comes at the forty-five minute mark where the film suddenly turns on its head as they arrive at a Mexican biker stripper joint hilariously named ‘the titty twister’ and discover they’ve wandered into a hive of vampires. The vampires seduce bikers into their bar then lock the doors and feast on the catch from dusk till dawn.\n\nAt this point the film turns into a B movie survival film among the likes of Evil Dead as our heroes and anti-heroes have to put aside their differences and work together with several classic grindhouse movie bikers to fight the hordes of vampire strippers pouring from the depths of the stripclub. Including such ridiculous characters as a mountain of moustachioed man and a biker with a gun for a phallus named ‘Sex Machine.’ Dripping with neon imagery literally layered over gothic imagery this is where the movie really takes off into the genre hybrid despite being only twenty-five minutes away from the end of the film.\n\nThe film is strange in this timing that it actually only launches into the final act of the three act structure in these last twenty-five minutes. It starts with the two groups traveling separately across Texas, one on a happy family trip, the other on a trail of carnage and rape. The film is launched into act two when the two groups happen to meet at a seedy motel and the two brothers decide to hold them at gunpoint through the Mexican border. This act starts to show a distrust between the two brothers as Clooney’s character has to knock out Tarintino to calm him down at an intense moment as the Mexican border patrol inspect their vehicle. They make it over and get into the ‘titty twister’ as this leads to the scene that kick starts the last act; a stripper transforming into a scaly vampire and ripping out Tarintino’s neck. His death starts the literal bloodbath that is the third act, with vampires and bikers melting and tearing apart left and right. This final act shows the redemption for Clooney’s character as he protects and fights with the ex-priest and his son and daughter. Fixing the mess he got them in to. He also has to finally face his brother’s inner demon as he is forced to kill the monster his brother has become. Tarintino transforms into a vampire and Clooney is forced to kill him with the line “Here is the peace in death, I could not give you in life.” The film ends off finally with only Clooney and the Kate (the daughter) alive; left to grieve their losses as dawn finally kills the remaining vampires. However the film alludes to a sequel as the camera pans outward in a final shot to show the ‘titty twister’ was simply the tip of the iceberg and there is in fact a pyramid running under the bar into the side of a cliff most likely containing thousands more vampires to be fought. There were unfortunately several sequels and a TV series to follow which in my opinion is a terrible shame as the quality drops off considerably due to them being directed by several other directors.\n\nThe film combines genre elements of a gangster film, spaghetti westerns and, of course, vampires. The film includes many elements of all three such as two outcasts being on the run, a paradigm of gangster films; in which gangsters go on the run after a hit or robbery; western films; in which outlaws, literally outside the law go on the run and vampire films in which the creatures of the night are literally outside the law.\n\nThe film also features obvious motifs of grindhouse movies a la Rodriguez. This is obvious in the way the film continuously escalades the ridiculous factor of the way the heroes kill the monsters, especially in the last twenty-five minutes. Including a water pistol of holy water, a road drill with a stake sticking out of it and bullets with crosses carved into them (all of which work because in grindhouse rules the more ridiculous a solution is, the more likely it is to work.) When it comes to elements of the vampire genre the film takes just about every stereotype in the book. The vampires are seductive and sadistic, appearing sexy to the bikers until they lure them into their home, like a spider luring flies into its web. Appearing like this until the moment they devour their victims at which point their faces warp to appear more monster-like.) They melt from crosses and holy water, explode in sunlight, have super human strength and can climb up walls and on the ceiling. And most stereotypical of all, they can transform into bats, one even transforms into a rat. The film features many elements of the western too in long black dusters and revolvers, cowboy hats and outlaws. With the settings being only lonely dusty desert roads and not much civilisation. And finally the film wraps up how it starts, with a gangster style deal being done between Clooney and his dealer. Clooney goes back to his old thieving job, parting ways with Kate and giving her some money to make up for the loss of her family.\n\nSeveral points in the film are set up in the first act and fleshed out then pay off in the second or last act. Harvey (the ex-priest) is shown to have fallen from God. To be beyond redemption. Something his son, Scott, voices concern about several times in the first act. This is shown to be even more of a truth in the final act as Harvey turns into a vampiric demon and Scott is forced to kill his father whilst praying to God. Harvey falls so far from God he becomes a demon. Seth (Clooney) also has to go through a revelation throughout the course of the film as his brother Richard (Tarintino) becomes increasingly more and more sadistic and unhinged. Maiming and raping women on their trail of death across Texas. Seth is always shown as the superior of the two, the boss of the Gecko brothers as Rickard is often shown as having a childlike mind. This can be seen in him watching cartoons and having to wear a mouthpiece as he grinds his teeth. In the final act of the film Richard transforms into a vampire, going full demon, and Seth is forced to confront the problem he refused to throughout the course of the film and most likely their whole life. He shoots his brother giving him ‘the peace he could not give him in life.’ This shows Seth has grown as a character; he starts to confront his fears rather than shy away from them. However at the end of the film he is shown to have not changed his ways at all. He’s still a gangster; he’s just grown more as a person. This is also shown in Harvey and Seth’s relationship. When the two meet for the first time Seth makes it perfectly clear that Harvey means nothing to him and his brother and that he doesn’t care as long as they make it over the border. However, after Harvey stands up to Seth for losing his cool in the ‘titty twister’ calling him a loser for not knowing he’s already won, Seth gains respect for Harvey. Stating Harvey is the “man he most wants to have a drink with.” Seth also shows compassion and anguish later on after learning Harvey has been bitten and will turn into a vampire.\n\nOverall I think this is the best example of the western, vampire genre hybrid. The music, full of country songs about pain and darkness, is perfectly chosen. The fact that is saves all the vampires for the very last act of the film also brings it as a bloody nice surprise, pacing the plot points incredibly well and sucking the audience in with each melodramatic episode. Even making the audience start to like Seth and showing them the compassionate side of him and the darker side of Harvey. However, the points where I feel this film truly shine is the mise en scene and the acting. Each performance and each sleazy neon sign or gothic arched doorway is truly dripping with a western and horror feel. You aren’t sure half the time which genre you’re watching as they’re all slathered on top of each other and the performance of both Clooney and Tarintino suck you in, making you invested in each and every twist in the tale.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
