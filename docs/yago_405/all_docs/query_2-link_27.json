        "text": "\"From Quentin Tarantino. From Robert Rodriguez. From Dusk Till Dawn\"\n\n\"One night is all that stands between them and freedom. But it's going to be a hell of a night.\"\n\nThis movie is about the mass-murdering bank-robbing Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who kidnap a minister and his son and daughter, and force him to drive his motor home to Mexico. They wait overnight (for someone who will take them to \"El Rey\" the fictional Mexican kingdom from \"The Getaway\") in a nightclub/whorehouse called the Titty Twister that's open from dusk till dawn. Hey - that's where they got the title.\n\nThe most memorable part of the movie for me is the snake scene, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n\nIt starts when the bartender gets up to announce the next act. He describes her as \"The epitome of evil, the most sinister woman to ever dance on the face of this earth. Bow your head. Kneel and worship at the feet of Santanico Pandemonium!\" Then we see a woman wearing a giant feather headdress like an ancient goddess (Salma Hayek) and a cape. She opens the cape to show that she's wearing only a tiny bikini. Then she wraps the cape around herself and fire shoots up on either side of her. She opens her cape and we see a large albino python wrapped around her nearly-naked body, as if it appeared there magically. Santanico then writhes around on stage with the snake for a while, accompanied by some sultry guitar rock music, until her also nearly-naked assistants remove the snake and she walks downstairs and onto a tabletop. Then she does something that made me very thirsty. She lifts her bare leg, stuffs her toes into Quentin Tarantino's mouth, opens a bottle of booze, and pours it down her leg until it drips into his mouth. Sure, it's a wasteful and unsanitary way to serve alcohol that probably violates several restaurant codes, but I didn't see anybody in the club rushing to call the Health Department. (Tarantino wrote the screenplay, so you know this scene inspired thousands of screenwriter/actors to write similar scenes for themselves.)\n\nThen things start to get weird. A fight breaks out and some men are shot to death. Tarantino is stabbed in his hand which drips with blood. When Santanico sees the blood she gets a crazy look in her eyes then turns into a snake woman vampire and attacks Tarantino. Her whole body doesn't turn into a scaled reptile, only her head but she does have a few reptilian markings on her body, so I have decided that she's a snake woman vampire. We see everybody else in the bar turn into vampires, including the topless dancers. They all have large fangs, but none of them have a snake-woman head, so that helps to support my idea. After all, she is \"the epitome of evil\" and she has a way with snakes.\n\nSantanico, who has changed back into a woman, tells Clooney that she's going to feed on his blood and make him her slave, but one so lowly that he will have to feed on the blood of stray dogs. She changes back into a snake woman and tells him \"welcome to slavery\" but he tells her \"no thanks, I already have a wife\" and kills her. I hope I'm not the only one who was sad to see her burst into flames and turn into a puddle of goo."
