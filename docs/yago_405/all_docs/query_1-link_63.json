        "text": "Food in Tarantino Movies\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nReservoir Dogs may not have as extensive a menu as Quentin Tarantino’s later films, but this doesn’t mean food doesn’t play a big role. Take, for example, Mr. Orange and Holdaway getting late-night eats at a diner (a favorite location of Tarantino’s, as we’ll see).\n\nIt might not seem like the food here is a big deal, but in his script, Tarantino seems to indicate otherwise. We imported the script into StudioBinder's screenwriting software. Click the image below and take a look at his description at the beginning of the scene.\n\nNotice just how much space Tarantino gives to describing the food. We can see this as a prime example of how he uses food for characterization. This is our introduction to Holdaway, and Tarantino’s in-depth description of how he eats tells us intricacies about his character.\n\nEating in the middle of the night like this indicates Holdaway is probably not someone who works a conventional 9-to-5. Pouring out a whole bottle of ketchup tells us this isn’t a man who abides by moderation.\n\nWe can also see how the consumption of food allows Tarantino to pace his dialogue. This is a great example that proves Tarantino is thinking about how food will play a role in the scene, especially in terms of performance.\n\nFood in Tarantino Movies\n\nTrue Romance\n\nEven when Tarantino isn’t directing, his food-philia is ever-present. Tony Scott took the reins on this Tarantino screenplay, which is filled to the gills with a variety of meals.\n\nOne scene in which food is particularly important is the introduction to Gary Oldman’s Drexl, the pimp of Clarence’s lover, Alabama.\n\nHere, the Chinese food Drexl is chomping down on works to color the dynamic between Clarence and the pimp.\n\nAt first, the food gives Drexl something else to focus on other than Clarence; it’s a way for him to show that the kid means nothing to him. Then, once he hears that Clarence is married to Alabama, his interest is piqued. He offers Clarence some of his food as a way to draw him into his web. Usually, this type of offer is a sign of friendship. Here, however, it’s a sign of domination.\n\nDrexl also emphasizes just how much food he has, flexing the decadence in which he lives: “We got everything here from a diddle-eyed joe to a damned-if-I-know.”\n\nWhen Clarence turns the food down, both characters clock this as a sign of aggression. Clarence won’t back down, and neither will the pimp. Drexl tries to corner Clarence by calling him a coward for not eating.\n\nTake a look at his monologue.\n\nFood acts as a lens through which Drexl can insult Clarence’s character. Declining food is an act of weakness.\n\nBut Clarence flips Drexl’s rhetoric on its head. He reiterates his position, this time with an air of open hostility: “I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin.' I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago.”\n\nThus, in this True Romance scene, Tarantino uses food to deliver relational subtext. The characters are talking about the meal in front of them, but the meaning of conversation is much deeper.\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nBeer\n\nPopcorn and Soda\n\nChinese Takeout\n\nChampagne\n\nHamburgers\n\n7-Up\n\nYoohoo\n\nFritos\n\nAnimal Crackers\n\nCoke\n\nCoffee\n\nPulp Fiction Milkshake\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nAs you can see, Tarantino’s most influential film is also one of the most food-heavy. Pulp Fiction has multiple scenes which revolve around food, many of them iconic. Take Jules and Vincent’s conversation on the way to a job. Their bickering about a \"Royale with Cheese\" has become one of the most quoted scenes in cinematic history.\n\nPerhaps the most important use of food in the film, however, is Jules and the Big Kahuna burger.\n\nThe burger appears when Jules and Vincent enter the apartment of Brett, a business associate of their boss, from whom they’re supposed to retrieve a briefcase. Brett is in the middle of eating the Big Kahuna, and Jules takes note.\n\nThe beginning of their conversation revolves almost exclusively around the burger. It’s clear Brett is terrified, giving timid, monosyllabic answers as Jules nonchalantly interrogates him about his breakfast.\n\nThen, Jules takes a bite out of the burger. It’s a sign of ultimate disrespect and domination – he can take whatever he wants, whenever he wants it. And the burger does more than just inform the power differential between Jules and Brett. Take a look at this exchange on the page.\n\nIn this exchange, Brett inadvertently oversteps his bounds. He guesses correctly as to why the Royale with Cheese has that name, and it clearly irks Jules, who gives a sarcastic reply. This back and forth tells us a bit more about Brett – he’s educated, perhaps a college kid who’s gotten in over his head.\n\nTo reassert his dominance, Jules drinks the rest of Brett’s Sprite. Samuel L. Jackson uses this action to really punctuate his character’s distaste for Brett– instead of a “sip,” as directed in the script, he takes a very, very long gulp.\n\nThe rest, of course, is movie history.\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nCoffee\n\nRoyale with Cheese\n\nBig Kahuna Burger with Sprite\n\nBeer\n\nWhiskey on the Rocks\n\nVanilla Shake\n\nCoke\n\nCheeseburger and Fries\n\nSteak and Fries\n\nFruit Brute Cereal\n\nPancakes with Syrup\n\nBlueberry Pie with Cheese\n\nBloody Mary\n\nPop Tarts\n\nBacon\n\nMuffin\n\nIn this exchange, being denied a drink is a sign of aggression. Who gets to consume alcohol and who doesn’t tells us who has the power. When Razor drinks his whiskey, Seth feels slighted, saying, “Are you telling me that I’m not good enough to drink here?”\n\nThe act almost leads to a physical altercation until Jacob steps in and resolves the misunderstanding. Sure enough, by the end of the scene, Seth is enjoying a drink — he’s been accepted.\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nCoffee\n\nBig Kahuna Burgers\n\nBeer\n\nWhiskey Shots\n\nNotice how differently the presence of coffee is handled in comparison to the whiskey in the last scene. Here, it’s a beverage to be shared, and, crucially, it isn’t being demanded. Instead, Max accepts the offer, but only if Jackie herself is having some.\n\nWe also get to see the easy-going nature of Max on full display. When Jackie laments that the milk has gone bad, Max is perfectly content with black coffee.\n\nThe making of coffee also gives the scene some dynamic blocking. While Max is trying to figure out this mystery woman, she is obscured by kitchen cabinets in the other room while she makes the beverage. When she reenters with the coffee, their conversation is less business-oriented, and more intimate.\n\nMax and Jackie’s relationship is one of the warmest of Tarantino’s filmography, and it’s this scene over a cup of coffee that makes that possible.\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nWhiskey on the Rocks\n\nCoffee\n\nEvian Water\n\nVodka on the Rocks\n\nWhite Wine\n\nRoscoe’s Chicken and Waffles\n\nScrewdriver\n\nNoodles\n\nShake\n\nTeriyaki and Soda\n\nSteak and A1 Sauce\n\nFood in Tarantino Movies\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 2\n\nIn Kill Bill: Vol. 2, the Bride is pushed to her limits, and Tarantino emphasizes this with food. The climax of his over-the-top training montage between Pai Mei and the Bride boils down to a simple meal.\n\nThroughout the montage, we see the Bride getting overworked in a variety of ways: punching thick wood, carrying massive jugs of water, getting hit with a cane. But it isn’t until she sits down to eat a bowl of rice when we see just how big of a toll the training has taken on her.\n\nInterestingly, this is a rare example amongst Quentin Tarantino food scenes for not giving the food as much attention in his script as much as he does in his film. What Tarantino sums up as “she does” in his screenplay, his film spends nearly a minute (usually a page of a script) depicting.\n\nIt was a good call. By spending time showing just how difficult it is for the Bride to eat, we can see two things: 1) just how close she is to her breaking point and 2) the first note of sympathy in Pai Mei’s eyes.\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nWhiskey\n\nPeanuts\n\nRice\n\nMargaritas\n\nPoisoned Fish Heads\n\nHam and Cheese Without the Crust\n\nThe strudel is a pastry most often associated with Germany and Austria, and so Landa ordering the dish in France shows his belief in German superiority over all else. He can’t even bring himself to say the French can do the pastry justice. All he can say is, “It’s not so terrible.”\n\nLike so many other of Quentin Tarantino food scenes, the meal in the sequence is used to highlight a power dynamic. Landa orders for Shosanna, and even goes so far as to tell her when she can eat.\n\nPerhaps most threatening of all, however, is what he orders as her drink. Take a look at how Tarantino describes it in the film’s screenplay.\n\nTarantino is explicit in what the milk represents to Shosanna: it is a reminder of the murder of her family, and a reminder that their murderer is sitting right before her.\n\nEven though the scene itself is tense, Tarantino goes out of his way to make the strudel look delicious. As Tarantino puts it, “I do like the fact that when you see my movies, there might be one drink or one piece of food that the audience fixates on… I defy anyone to not want strudel when you see Inglourious Basterds. It’s not just Nazi guys eating it, it’s like ‘Man, that strudel looks good!’”\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nMilk\n\nRed Wine\n\nSandwich\n\nChampagne\n\nStrudel\n\nEspresso\n\nBeer\n\nWhiskey\n\nFood in Tarantino Movies\n\nOnce Upon A Time… In Hollywood\n\nOnce Upon A Time… In Hollywood contains one of the most effective characterizations through food Tarantino has ever done, which, as we’ve established, is saying a lot.\n\nWhen we are introduced to Cliff’s dog, Brandy, Cliff is still a bit of an enigma. But as we see Cliff prepare dinner for the both of them, we learn a lot more about him.\n\nFirst, we see that Cliff really loves this dog. He’s got an entire cabinet dedicated to the burly pooch’s food. And there’s a lot of food. Cliff makes an overflowing plate for his pet, and we see how well-trained his canine friend is as Brandy waits for Cliff to finish preparing his own meal.\n\nCliff’s dinner is one you might expect a hungry adolescent would make: a pot of mac ‘n’ cheese… eaten out of the pot. It’s a meal that represents Cliff’s lifestyle as a whole — this is someone in arrested development.\n\nThe two then both devour their respective suppers simultaneously. This intercutting encourages the audience to notice the similarities between the dog and the man. Both are loyal, and both are not to be messed with.\n\nWithout giving anything away, these similarities are crucial to the film’s climax, and they’ve all been established with barely a word. In Tarantino’s dialogue-heavy films, food often speaks for itself.\n\nAdditional Food/Drink:\n\nBloody Mary\n\nWhiskey on the Rocks\n\nDog Food (Wet and Dry)\n\nMac ‘n’ Cheese\n\nBeer\n\nWhiskey Sour\n\nFrench Press Coffee\n\nBLT\n\nChili\n\nFrozen Margaritas\n\nUp Next\n\nTarantino’s Favorite Movies Ever\n\nQuentin Tarantino didn’t create his distinct style in a vacuum. Perhaps more than almost any other filmmaker, Tarantino fills his movies with references to other films. Take a look at a list of films that he has said have influenced him.\n\nUp Next: Tarantino's Favorites →"
