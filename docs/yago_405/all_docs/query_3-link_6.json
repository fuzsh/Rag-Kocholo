It had kick ass action and seemed like it was gonna be great. Then Came out the Vampires, this is where the movie got all WINDTALKERS on me. Why would quentin do such a movie, he knew what has gonna happen???\n\nI know this topic has “sort of” come up before. but what i am asking is, why would such a great director have anything to do with this. If he hated the Matrix reloaded so much then what’s with this.\n\nTarantino actually wrote FDTD way back in the late 80’s/early 90’s as a favor to Bob Kurtzman from KNB FX. I believe Tarantino was paid like $1,500, plus Kurtzman agreed to do the effects for “Reservoir Dogs” in return.\n\nAs to why the movie gets crappy toward the end, I don’t know. A lot of the silly stuff kinda ruined it for me too. Although I have to admit that some of the one liners are the best Tarantino’s written.\n\n“You’re dealin’ with a coupla real mean motor-scooters.”\n\n\"…I will turn this place into the fucking ‘Wild Bunch’ if I think that you are fucking with me.\"\n\n\"Don’t you ever try and fucking run on us, because I got six little friends and they can all run faster than you can.\"\n\nAnd, of course, so good that we included it in one of my band’s songs…\n\n\"Kill 'em ALL!\"\n\nEtc., etc., etc.\n\nAs to why Tarantino would even bother acting in the movie…Q.T. has this misconception that he’s a decent actor. If I recall, there was a heated debate around Hollywood as to whether or not the man actuallly COULD act. I suspect he took the role to bring an end to all the trash-talking. Did it work? No. People still say he’s a shitty actor. I’ve posted here before that he’s no DeNiro, but he’s definitely better than Keanu Reeves or Vin Disel, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, some of your points DO beg rational answers. I did my best to shed what little light I could. Hope it helped. Later.\n\nM.W.\n\n[quote]The second part of FDTD was a homage to all those horror cult movies QT loves so much. It had gore, violence, nudity, black humor, cheesy special effects etc.; all essential elements which one would normally find in a cult movie made in the Ã‚Â 70’s or 80’s. If you’re not into cult movies, you will not enjoy the second part of FDTD. Period.[/quote]\n\nI could understand if the entire movie was a homage to cult films but why the suddon twist. I like homage films in a different way then i like my other movies. The start of the film seemed like it would be all about crime and things that could happen in real life. But the movie just changed and went from realistic to vampires, like the entire rest of the film had nothing to do with the begining. It just left me unsatisfied.\n\nit’s just that there didn’t have to be a begining part. The second part has nothing to do with the begining. There could have been a totally different begining and the second part could would still make sence. But the story was moving along so well and could have been so cool then all that character development ment nothing because the ending had nothing to do with the begining.\n\nI’m glad the movie wasn’t all of QT’s style, because it wouldn’t be fair to Robert Rodriguez, who is, I don’t know, the DIRECTOR of the movie! If QT directed it, then yeah, I would’ve expected more of his style. But he didn’t.\n\nThe horror film is exactly what it should’ve been. B-movie grade horror with blood and guts…QT didn’t get Tom Savini (the guy with the cock gun) for nothing. That guy is a legend in horror. I don’t know how many other ways you can film B-movie horror. I think Rodriguez did it the only way he could.\n\n[quote]Ok then, let’s just forget the vampire thing for a moment. Let’s just say Seth and co. have just reached the Titty Twister and sexy Salma has just finished that jaw-dropping dancing scene. Where would you personally go with the story from there? It would be interesting to hear some of your opinion. Just don’t say they should have sex for 45 minutes before Carlos shows up.[/quote]\n\nIf its Selma Hayek\n\nYes\n\nYes I’d like to see 45 minutes of sex."
