        "text": "I’d led silently in my bed watching the beams from car headlights spill across the ceiling through my bedroom window, desperately willing myself not to fall asleep. It must’ve been around one o’clock by the time I was certain my mum was in bed and it was safe to sneak downstairs to the living room to pop the video into the player. I was around eleven or twelve years old, and Quentin Tarantino had fast become my favorite filmmaker. I had only seen Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction at that point — the former I’d caught on TV, the latter I’d somehow managed to convince my Nan to buy me on VHS (‘It won the Palm D’Or, Nan! That’s French! It’s artsy!’) — but I knew I loved his work. As is likely the case for so many budding film enthusiasts of my age, Tarantino’s movies made me feel almost academic; it was like a kind of “hey! I get that reference! I must be a film buff!” enjoyment that no other writer/director (bar maybe Kevin Smith, but I came to his films wayyy later) could quite capture. Watching Tarantino’s films made me feel cineliterate, and I loved it! I may have been a fervent horror fan, but I made an exception for good old Quentin, and just because my mum said I couldn’t watch his latest offering, that wasn’t about to stop me. So, in the early hours of the morning, in the pitch black of the living room, I took the bulky video cassette from its rental box and slipped it into the machine. From Dusk Till Dawn began, and it was about to blow my fucking mind!\n\nFor me, there is a time before From Dusk Till Dawn and there is a time after. Something changed in me that night. As a person who writes about movies, I’m prone to a lot of hyperbole — sometimes just because it’s funny — but it really isn’t an exaggeration to say that watching this peculiar little movie totally altered my perceptions of what cinema could be. Evil Dead 2 had done something similar a few months earlier, but while that film certainly made me very aware that cinema could be so much more than a sort of ‘point the camera and shoot’ set-up, nothing could quite prepare me for the total insanity that was about to unfold on the screen that night. As I already said, I loved horror, it was the genre closest to my heart (still is!), but, and this is the really important bit, I didn’t actually know From Dusk Till Dawn was a horror movie!\n\nIn fact, all I knew was that it had something to do with Quentin Tarantino. I didn’t know who Robert Rodriguez was, I’d never heard of George Clooney, and I certainly wasn’t in a position to recognize the likes of Tom Savini, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, Julliette Lewis, or Fred Williamson. When the film began, I was actually surprised to discover that Tarantino was in it beyond a mere cameo role! I knew him from Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction — indeed, one of my proudest show-off trivia pieces was telling my friends ‘that’s the director!’ whenever the Jimmy scene would play out on screen — but I didn’t know he would ever appear in anything outside of small parts. I was confused that his name didn’t appear as director, but kept watching because whatever else was going on, this seemed to be in line with the other two movies of his I was familiar with. It was a crime caper, violent and dark (in fact, at that point it probably seemed to be the darkest; the bit with the hostage woman and Tarantino’s Richie was… unsettling, and I even briefly considered turning the whole thing off at that moment), and filled to the brim with the kind of stylish dialogue I had come to expect from his output. When Harvey Keitel showed up I think I probably squealed (quietly, can’t wake mum!) with glee, because the mother-fucking Wolf had just arrived on screen.\n\nNow that I think back on it, though, I suspect I knew something was up. Something wasn’t quite right. Even before we get to the whole twist of it all (and it’s a mega-twist, folks!), the film felt a little weird. All of this getting-across-the-border nonsense seemed to be leading… somewhere, but fuck knows if I could figure it out. Nonetheless, I do distinctly remember sitting on the floor in front of the TV — close enough that I could have the volume turned right down — wondering where all this was going. And everything had an undeniably… discomforting edge. Looking back on it now, having rewatched the movie well into double-digits, I reckon it was probably because of the music. Not the cool as fuck track that plays over the opening titles, but the music that plays over the more tense and suspenseful moments. It’s a sort of low drone, and it fills the scenes — most of which are already filled with nasty content — with a sort of unknowable dread. Something bad is coming, and we can tell this is the case from the very start.\n\nOf course, that moment where Clooney’s Seth returns to the motel to find his brother, Tarantino’s Richie, has violently raped and murdered their hostage — who, we are told through a news segment seen earlier, is a wife and mother of four — doesn’t help. The way Rodriguez splices in shots of the bloody bedsheets, the phone off the hook, etc. really amps up the horror of what has happened, and it leaves a horrible taste lingering over the film. These are not nice people, and I’m scared of them. I’m scared of them. And I’m scared for the family they have just taken hostage in their RV, led by Keitel’s ex-preacher, Jacob. I’m… scared.\n\nThat’s the real trick From Dusk Till Dawn plays. It’s more of a horror movie in its violent crime-caper first half than it is in its vampire-centric gorefest second. While the latter leans into goofy practical effects and cartoonish violence, the former revels in subtle tension, an uncomfortable real-world nightmare slowly unfolding in carefully paced, dialogue-heavy sequences. In the full-length behind-the-scenes documentary Full Tilt Boogie (which is on the second disk of my DVD copy of the film), Tarantino says something about the film following a traditional horror story structure; his claim is that in the opening of a horror film you get to know the characters before the threat enters. The only difference between traditional horror and his movie, Tarantino claims, is that his characters are ‘a bunch of jerks’. I think there's an element of truth to this, and the batshit insanity of everything that takes place inside the infamous Titty Twister bar is, despite its appearance, perfectly in keeping with the trajectory the film is already on.\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn is about plans being thwarted by outside circumstances. It’s about life getting in the way. It’s about how, no matter how prepared, how clever, and how sure you are, things ain’t ever gonna go like you imagined, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re a ‘bastard’ or a ‘fucking bastard’, ultimately life doesn’t care. Bad shit is gonna happen no matter what, and sometimes it really is just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nMichael Parks’ ill-fated Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (who, as a character, also appears in Kill Bill vol. 1, Planet Terror, and Death Proof), is in the wrong place at the wrong time. As was Branda Hillhouse’s tragic hostage, Gloria. Jacob and his family certainly were. And, eventually, so were Seth and Richie Gecko. Even the vampires, who have been carrying out their diabolical plan successfully for, as it transpires, centuries, ultimately find themselves unable to contend with the random and violent nature of life throwing them a curveball! And while the first half of the film may be far more ‘realistic’ in its approach to this theme, the sudden tonal shift and blood-soaked, practical effects heavy massacre that follows mid-way through perfectly encapsulates it. The way characters are picked off at random following this only furthers the idea.\n\nBut enough beating around the bush, let’s get to it, shall we? For those of you who don’t know — and if you’ve not seen the movie and are reading this article then… shit! I’m so sorry I spoiled it for you, but you really shoulda watched it first! — From Dusk Till Dawn turns out to actually not be the violent, grim, gritty crime caper eleven or twelve-year-old me assumed it was (and that the film’s entire first hour — I checked! — convinces us it is), but is rather a fucking gonzo, Evil Dead-infused, over-the-top vampire flick that features a band playing instruments made out of body parts, a decapitated corpse turning into a gloopy, Thing-esque rat creature, Harvey Keitel’s Jacob blowing vampire’s heads off with a DIY shotgun/baseball bat come cross, and a rag-tag band of ‘heroes’ killing off the monsters with condoms filled with Holy Water! And, as if that wasn’t enough to hammer home just how abruptly, whiplash-inducingly sudden and seemingly incoherent this sudden change in not just tone, but style and genre is, the entire thing happens within the space of like… a second, before suddenly unraveling in a fifteen-minute-long sequence of vampires killing people and people killing vampires in the most grizzly, insane, slapstick fashion you could possibly care to imagine.\n\nI remember the moment so vividly, watching it all those years ago at one o’clock in the morning, that every subsequent viewing drags me back to my eleven or twelve-year-old self, sitting on the floor, staring wide-eyed at the TV, trying to work out if I’d somehow accidentally switched off the VHS and changed channels, and had just happened to land on an entirely different movie that featured the same cast in the same sets wearing the same costumes. If Evil Dead 2 taught me the camera could be as important as the actors and the mise-en-scene, then From Dusk Till Dawn taught me that everything I thought I knew about genre was bullshit, all the ‘rules’ for scriptwriting I had devoured from books in the library were meaningless, and a movie could, and potential would pull a total fast one on me and scramble my brain while doing it! This is 100% true, but I sat there for a moment, composed myself, and rewound the video to watch it again, just to make sure I hadn’t missed something.\n\nI hadn’t, though. The film really does do just that. And much like Psycho has lost its power now we all know Janet Leigh is gonna die, it’s probably impossible for many people to really get the full experience of From Dusk Till Dawn like I did back then. I cannot make this clear enough; I. DID. NOT. KNOW. THERE. WOULD. BE. VAMPIRES! It was baffling and exciting all at the same time. For me, the rest of the film was basically a blur, I was so absorbed in the sheer madness of what had happened and what was continuing to happen that I didn't really take all of it in until years later.\n\nI might have been clued in had I recognized Tom Savini, or had I been aware enough to know that the fact that his character, inexplicably named Sex Machine, has a cock and balls shaped gun hidden in his groin is totally out of place within the seedy, hyper-real crime thriller I’d just been watching, but I didn’t and I wasn’t. If I’d been aware enough, or versed enough in cinema to recognize that the Titty Twister bar itself looks like something out of a Hammer-era Gothic horror, complete with monstrous gargoyles built into the stone, castle-like walls, then maybe it would have triggered some sense of expectation for what was to come. Bur, again, I wasn’t. Since then, having watched it many, many more times, I’ve come to appreciate the way the film actually does kinda hint at what's to come; the frightening tale Earl McGraw tells in the opening, the aforementioned horror of the earlier sequences, the font used on the title — and, indeed, the title itself — all subtly lay the groundwork for this left-field turn into batshit, Peter Jackson-like horror. But all of that went way over my head on first viewing, and I was left pumped! I don’t think I slept, and I went to school the next day and promptly spoiled it for absolutely everyone! I just had to talk about it. I mean, what the actual fuck had I just watched!?\n\nThese days I find my enjoyment for the film comes more from the little winks and nods to other movies — the aforementioned Savini and Williamson, the excellent line “Peter Cushing does that all the time” and so on — and the hilarious notion that Tarantino popped himself into the movie solely so he could suck of Selma Hayek’s foot (and also the fact that Vampiretino looks more like Tarantino than Tarantino). But there is still a lot of fun to be found in the incredible use of practical effects present throughout the latter half of the movie, and, as I already said, I have found time to appreciate the cleverer elements of the screenplay during its earlier moments. Perhaps the most interesting facet of From Dusk Till Dawn, though, is that it sits at the tail-end of the low-budget practical effects extravaganza, and could potentially be viewed as the swansong of that kind of gloopy, celebratory, practical effects madness in cinema. If Jurassic Park’s release three years earlier signaled the end of practical effects and the true dawn of the digital era, then perhaps From Dusk Till Dawn is something of a last hurrah! A joyously silly, delightfully over-the-top excuse to throw around fake blood, prosthetic heads, and weird rat monsters for one last time. And if that is the case, then they definitely went out with a bang!\n\nI went back to bed after watching, but as I already said, I didn’t sleep. I led there playing what I had just seen over in my head, those car headlights still bouncing off the ceiling above me. But something had changed. Cinema was different and I was different. A movie was no longer certain to be a predictable, obvious narrative, but rather could take me anywhere, do anything, and genuinely surprise me in ways I could previously never have imagined! I wasn’t sure what to think then, but now I know that actually I was rewiring my mind, putting this thing into place, and allowing my new understanding to come clearly into view. Only two movies since then have ever had a similar impact, but I don’t think either of them come close to the magnitude and shock that From Dusk Till Dawn unleashed upon impressionable young me. I never told my mum I watched it. She doesn’t read this blog. So I think I’m safe."
