        "text": "Quentin Tarantino is deemed by many fans as an eccentric filmmaker because of his out-of-the-box ideas and movies which often execute scenes that are too bold for the general viewers. Take, for instance, his screenplay of From Dusk Till Dawn helmed by Robert Rodriguez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt boasted several acclaimed actors such as George Clooney and Salma Hayek, whose careers back then weren’t as stellar as they are now. In fact, Quentin’s film helped propel them to stardom.\n\nSalma Hayek Reveals Quentin Tarantino Purposely Cast Himself In From Dusk Till Dawn\n\nOne of the most unforgettable scenes in 1996’s From Dusk Till Dawn was Quentin Tarantino’s Richard ‘Richie’ Gecko performing a sensual act opposite Salma Hayek’s Santanico Pandemonium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sequence in question was when Hayek’s character would pour down tequila on her leg while she forces a man to s*ck her toes. The man is no other than Tarantino’s Gecko. In an interview via The Free Library, the actress shared:\n\nQuentin wrote that scene for himself. George was complaining because I get to beat him up. I abuse him and call him my slave. He asked Quentin: ‘How come I get beaten up and you get to s*ck her toes?’\n\nThe famed filmmaker apparently used his own credentials as the screenwriter to secure the role. For quite some time, fans have been speculating on Tarantino’s personal fixations, the reason why there were a lot of feet shown in his movies.\n\nIn his interview with GQ Magazine, he nonchalantly said: “There’s a lot of feet in a lot of good directors’ movies. That’s just good direction.” Sure, fans will take his word for it. Meanwhile, Hayek also shared that starring in the film helped overcome her fear of snakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree months before we shot the scene, I would freak out if I saw a snake. I’d start screaming and crying. Eventually, I could touch the snake with one finger.\n\nWhat made the actress conquer her fear was the necessity to pay rent. Apparently, Tarantino threatened to replace her with Madonna if she didn’t dance with the snake.\n\nWith the help of several cures such as hypnotism and meditation, her phobia was gone. “When we came to film I actually enjoyed the dance a lot,” added Hayek.\n\nFans Are Still Not Over Quentin Tarantino’s Controversial Scene With Salma Hayek\n\nFans are still making fun of Tarantino for casting himself in the role of Richie Gecko, or the guy who gets to be intimate with Hayek’s Santanico Pandemonium. Check out fans’ hilarious reactions below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s common knowledge that Tarantino often gives himself exposure in his own films, but specifically choosing the role that gets up close and personal with Hayek’s character has become the subject of jokes over the years.\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn is available to watch on Prime Video."
