        "text": "GENERAL INFLUENCES\n\nA Better Tomorrow II: John Woo’s 1987 shoot-’em-up movie made a big impression on Tarantino when it came to orchestrating the climaxes of his own films: “I was watching it with a buddy of mine, and it’s all building to this big climax. We hadn’t seen this movie before, so we didn’t know they were going to have the biggest shoot-out in the history of film. My friend turns to me and goes, ‘If they don’t get naked and boogie at the end of this movie, this has been for nothing.’ He was right! Doesn’t matter that we enjoyed everything leading up to the end, it had to end in like a big way or it was all nothing!”\n\nAll My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers: In a 2004 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Tarantino referred to this 1972 Larry McMurtry book as “one of my favorite books of all time.”\n\nAssault on Precinct 13: In a 1996 interview with Don Gibalevich, Tarantino cited the classic John Carpenter film from 1976 as something he’d see “wherever the hell it was playing” when he was younger.\n\nBande à Part: Classic 1964 film from Jean-Luc Godard (with an incredible credits sequence) that gave Tarantino’s production company, A Band Apart, its name.\n\nBlow Out: Tarantino described Travolta’s performance in this 1981 Brian De Palma classic as “one of my favorite performances of all time” in a 1994 interview with Manohla Dargis.\n\nBreathless: “I love Breathless,” Tarantino told Michel Ciment and Hubert Niogret in a 1992 interview in French film magazine Positif, naming it as one of two Godard films that influenced his taste in cinema (along with Bande à Part, obviously).\n\nCage, Nicolas: One of Tarantino’s favorite actors of his generation: “I don’t think I’ve seen another actor in the history of film that made a career of being miscast and rising to the occasion,” he told The Village Voice’s J. Hoberman in 1996.\n\nCaged Heat: In a 1992 interview with Positif, Tarantino cited this 1974 Jonathan Demme movie as a film that left an impression on him when he was younger, “When I started to develop … my aesthetic.”\n\nCarlin, George: In a 1996 interview with J. Hoberman, Tarantino cited the late comedian as one of his favorite stand-up acts.\n\nCoffy: This 1973 Pam Grier film was the first of hers that Tarantino saw when he was younger, according to a Jackie Brown press conference in 1997.\n\nCorbucci, Sergio: In a 2009 interview with Screencrave, Tarantino referred to this Italian filmmaker as “the other master,” alongside Sergio Leone: “I think my films are closer to his than to Leone’s.”\n\nDe Palma, Brian: In a 1992 interview with Positif, Tarantino described his early acting lessons (including six years under James Best, who starred in several Samuel Fuller films) before admitting, “I didn’t fit in with the rest of the actors in [Best’s] school … my idols weren’t other actors. My idols were directors like Brian De Palma.”\n\nGriffith, Charles B.: In a 1993 interview with Graham Fuller, Tarantino described himself as “a fan” of this screenwriter, who contributed to several Roger Corman films.\n\nEnter the Dragon: 1973 Bruce Lee classic that was a formative influence on Tarantino’s younger self when it played at Carson Twin Cinema, a favorite childhood hangout, according to a 1996 interview with Don Gibalevich.\n\nFive Fingers of Death: 1972 kung-fu film that was a formative influence on Tarantino’s younger self when it played at Carson Twin Cinema, according to a 1996 interview with Don Gibalevich.\n\nLe Doulos: In a 1994 interview with Gavin Smith, Tarantino referred to Jean-Pierre Melville’s 1962 film as “my favorite screenplay of all time … I know when I go see a movie and I start getting confused, I’m emotionally disconnected, I check out emotionally. For some reason I don’t in Le Doulos.”\n\nLeone, Sergio: “I never felt gypped when Sergio Leone ended every Western he did with a showdown,” Tarantino told Roger Ebert in a 1994 interview about the massively influential spaghetti Western director, after being asked about how Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and True Romance all essentially conclude with gun-brandishing face-offs. “That’s just the way they ended. But every single one was different.”\n\nMarty: When a pre-filmmaking Tarantino was taking acting classes, he rewrote a scene from the Paddy Chayefsky–scripted classic from memory to perform as a monologue in his class; he told told Fresh Air host Terry Gross in 2009, “[I]t was the first time somebody complimented me [on my writing].”\n\nMorricone, Ennio: Legendary film composer who contributed to Tarantino’s forthcoming The Hateful Eight, as well as provided a substantial influence throughout Tarantino’s career — to wit: His music appears all over Kill Bill. “To me it sounds like rock and roll, even Morricone music,” he’s quoted as remarking about surf music in Jeff Dawson’s 1995 book Quentin Tarantino: The Cinema of Cool.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West: In a 1992 interview with Positif, Tarantino claims that it was Leone’s 1968 Western that appeared on the TV when he decided to “become a director.”\n\nParks, Michael: Tarantino once referred to the actor (who appears in From Dusk Till Dawn) as “one of the greatest actors that has been produced in our lifetime!” in a 1996 interview with J. Hoberman.\n\nPenn, Sean: One of Tarantino’s favorite actors of his generation, for his “sheer sexual-violence charisma,” he told J. Hoberman in 1996.\n\nPolanski, Roman: Tarantino cited Polanski’s brief appearances in his own films — specifically, The Fearless Vampire Killers and The Tenant — as inspiration for his inclination to appear in his own films in a 1992 Positif interview.\n\nPryor, Richard, That Nigger’s Crazy: In a 1994 interview with J. Hoberman, Tarantino cited this comedy album as “the closest to a perfect comedy album ever. It’s the Great American Novel done as a comedy routine.”\n\nRide in the Whirlwind: One of two films from director Monte Hellman (who was also a producer for Reservoir Dogs) that Tarantino described in a 1992 interview with Positif as “[one of the] most authentic Westerns.”\n\nRolling Thunder: “Whenever I’d read it was playing at the Palace Theater in Long Beach on a triple feature with The Howling, and something else, I’d take the bus to Long Beach to see it,” Tarantino said in a 1996 interview with Don Gibalevich regarding the 1977 revenge film.\n\nRoth, Tim: One of Tarantino’s favorite actors of his generation, for “his versatility and ferociousness,” he told J. Hoberman in 1996.\n\nScott, Tony: Besides penning True Romance’s script for him, Tarantino has gone on record many times as an avowed fan of the late director, citing 1990’s Revenge as a particular favorite in a 1993 interview.\n\nShadow Warriors: Tarantino referred to this 1980s Japanese cartoon as “the best cartoon I’ve seen on the screen” in a 1994 interview.\n\nThe Shooting: One of two films from director Monte Hellman (who was also a producer for Reservoir Dogs) that Tarantino described in a 1992 interview with Positif as “[one of the] most authentic Westerns.”\n\nSpeed: Tarantino cited the 1994 Jan de Bont actioner as “a totally fun movie” in an interview from that year: “Situation filmmaking at its best, because they really went with it.”\n\nTowne, Robert: Tarantino referred to this screenwriter in a 1993 interview as “[deserving of] every little bit of the reputation he has.”\n\nWhen the Lights Go Down: Tarantino read New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael’s 1980 book at 16 and, according to a 1992 interview with Positif, “[I] thought, ‘Someday maybe I’ll be able to understand a movie like she does.’”\n\nWitney, William: In an interview with Henry Louis Gates, Tarantino referred to this late film-and-TV director as “one of my Western heroes.”\n\nRESERVOIR DOGS\n\nAli, Muhammad: One of the legendary boxer’s many famous quotes (“If you even dream of beating me, you better wake up and apologize”) is paraphrased by Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) in the opening moments of the film: “You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.”\n\nAu Revoir les Enfants: How could Louis Malle’s classic, brutally sad 1987 drama about children attending a private school in Holocaust-era occupied France bear any specific influence on, of all things, Reservoir Dogs? According to a 2013 Variety interview, the title of Reservoir Dogs itself was inspired by patrons at the video store a pre-fame Tarantino worked at — Manhattan Beach’s Video Archives — mispronouncing Au Revoir les Enfants’ title at the counter. Inspiration comes from the strangest places!\n\nBedlam, “Magic Carpet Ride”: Cover of Steppenwolf’s original recorded specifically by this Nashville band for Reservoir Dogs.\n\nThe Big Combo: 1952 crime noir featuring a scene where a police officer is tortured and interrogated by a few of the film’s criminals. In other words, inspiration for the film’s infamous ear-cutting torture scene.\n\nBlue Suede, “Hooked on a Feeling”: This Swedish pop group’s 1974 cover of B.J. Thomas’s 1968 single plays in the car as the criminals drive to the scene of the heist.\n\nBrando, Marlon: “Undercover cops gotta be Brando,” LAPD force member Holdaway (Randy Brooks) tells Mr. Orange (Tim Roth). “To do this job, you gotta be a great actor, naturalistic. You gotta be naturalistic as hell.”\n\nBreathless: The 1983 American remake of Godard’s original, specifically — where, according to a 1992 interview, Tarantino got the inspiration to put a Silver Surfer poster on Mr. Orange’s wall.\n\nBronson, Charles: The legendary tough guy’s role in the 1963 classic The Great Escape is referenced in the “Like a Virgin” conversation featured in the film’s opening scene.\n\nChan, Charlie: Harvey Keitel, in his role as Mr. White, snidely tosses out the name of novelist Earl Derr Biggers’ fictional, heavily stereotypical Chinese-American detective character while riffling through mob boss Joe Cabot’s (Lawrence Tierney) old address book.\n\nCity On Fire: This one’s a tricky one, since Tarantino publicly dismissed claims made by movie mag Film Threat in the early ‘90s that Reservoir Dogs borrowed heavily — almost to the point of plagiarism — from Chinese director Ringo Lam’s 1987 actioner.

Look no further than “Who Do You Think You’re Fooling” (above), a 1995 short made by writer/filmmaker Mike White examining shot-by-shot comparisons between the two films.\n\nDay, Doris: The popular 1950s and ’60s actress who’s name-checked by Cabot in conversation with Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen).\n\nDelon, Alain: In a 1992 interview, Tarantino said he likes Reservoir Dogs’ title because “it sounds like something in an Alain Delon movie of Jean-Pierre Melville … I could see Alain Delon in a black suit saying, ‘I’m Mr. Blonde.’”\n\nThe DeFranco Family, “Heartbeat, It’s a Lovebeat”: The 1973 single name-checked by Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) as one of the songs he heard during “K Billy’s Super Sounds of the ’70s Weekend.”\n\nThe Duellists: One of a few movies Tarantino saw Keitel in as a teenager that eventually led him to cast the actor in Reservoir Dogs.\n\nFantastic Four: Mr. Orange pulls out a (quite timely — for 2015, anyway) comic-book reference to the superhero team that features “that invisible bitch” and “‘flame on’ and shit” while describing what Joe Cabot looks like: “Motherfucker looks just like the Thing.”\n\nFingers: One of a few movies Tarantino saw Keitel in as a teenager that eventually led him to cast the actor in Reservoir Dogs.\n\nFrancis, Ann: One of two actresses incorrectly identified as the actress in the title role of Get Christie Love! in Reservoir Dogs.\n\nThe George Baker Selection, “Little Green Bag”: 1969 single from Dutch curios the George Baker Selection that plays over the opening credits of Reservoir Dogs. Fun fact: The original title of the song was “Little Greenback,” which is for sure relative to the interests of Reservoir Dogs’ protagonists.\n\nGet Christie Love! 1974 detective TV show discussed in one of several pop-culture-loaded conversations featured in Reservoir Dogs.\n\nGrier, Pam: The other actress (and future Tarantino collaborator) incorrectly identified as the actress in the title role of Get Christie Love! by Nice Guy Eddie in Reservoir Dogs. “I’ve been a big fan for a long time,” Tarantino said in a 1997 interview, citing The Big Bird Cage, Coffy, Fort Apache, the Bronx, and Black Mama White Mama as some of his favorite films of hers.\n\nHolmes, John: Deceased ’70s porn star mentioned during the “Like a Virgin” conversation featured in the opening scene of Reservoir Dogs.\n\nKansas City Confidential: 1952 crime-noir film about a bank heist gone wrong that served as an influence for the plot of Reservoir Dogs.\n\nKarina, Anna: The jewelry store the criminals attempt to knock over is named Karina’s, after the Danish-French actress who was once married to French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard.\n\nThe Killing: Stanley Kubrick’s 1956 noir that Tarantino claims was a major influence on Reservoir Dogs: “I didn’t go out of my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did think of it as … my take on that kind of heist movie,” he told the Seattle Times in 1992.\n\nLawrence, Vicki, “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia”: Another one from “K Billy’s Super Sounds of the ’70s Weekend,” a murderous country song from 1972 brought up by Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn): “I thought it was the cheating wife that shot Andy!”\n\nLaws of Gravity: In a 1993 interview with Graham Fuller, Tarantino cited Nick Gomez’s 1992 crime drama as inspiration for Reservoir Dogs’ “guerrilla-style” status.\n\nThe Lost Boys: The 1987 teen-vampire film mentioned by Mr. Orange as part of his “commode story.”\n\nMadonna, “Like a Virgin”: Perhaps the first reflection of Tarantino’s pop-culture-addled lens comes in the opening scene of Reservoir Dogs, in which the film’s aspirant heist participants discuss the finer points of Madge’s catalogue over breakfast, centered around a theory delivered by Tarantino himself about how “Like a Virgin” is about “big dicks.”\n\nMadonna, “True Blue”: As Nice Guy Eddie admits, “Even I’ve heard ‘True Blue.’” (Have you?)\n\nMarvin, Lee: “I bet you’re a big Lee Marvin fan, aren’t you?” Mr. Blonde says, referencing the late actor to Mr. White as the two characters (along with Mr. Pink) endeavor to find out who botched the heist.

A bunch of guys are trapped in one place that they can’t leave.”\n\nWhere Eagles Dare: While addressing Reservoir Dogs’ debt to The Killing in a 1992 interview, Tarantino stated, “… if I was going to make a war movie where a bunch of guys get blown up by a Nazi gun, that would be my Where Eagles Dare. If I was going to do a Western, it would be my One-Eyed Jacks … The Killing is my favorite heist film, and I was definitely influenced by it.\n\nTRUE ROMANCE\n\nChiba, Sonny: “Bar none, the finest actor working in martial arts movies today,” or so says protagonist Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) in the film’s opening minutes while unsuccessfully trying to convince a woman at a bar to see a Chiba triple feature with him — specifically, The Street Fighter, Return of the Street Fighter, and Sister Street Fighter, all from 1974. (Tarantino would later cast Chiba in Kill Bill, too.)\n\nThe Deer Hunter: Right before the final shoot-out, Clarence compares film-producer-cum-drug-pusher Lee Donowitz’s (Saul Rubinek) Coming Home in a Body Bag to this 1978 dramatic epic by Michael Cimino.\n\nDr. Zhivago: This 1965 romantic epic serves as one of a few slang words for cocaine used between Clarence and Donowitz.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly: One of a few films Clarence rattles off as canon to Donowitz.\n\nHamlet: Paraphrasing the famous quote from one of Shakespeare’s oft-referenced plays, Clarence tells Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), “I knew something was rotten in Denmark,” after discovering she’s a call girl.

You know why we’re here?” So says hitman Jules Winnfield (Samuel L.

Nelson.\n\nAmos ’n’ Andy: A long-running radio and TV show originating in the 1920s, featuring two black characters voiced by white actors. It’s the other milkshake option provided to Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) at Jack Rabbit Slim’s.\n\nThe Aristocats: Tarantino told The Village Voice’s J. Hoberman in 1996 that he wanted Mia’s dance moves in Jack Rabbit Slim’s to be inspired by “this moment” in the 1970 Disney film “where Eva Gabor’s cat dances.”\n\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman: One of a few 1950s movies featured in poster form on the walls of Jack Rabbit Slim’s.\n\nBerry, Chuck, “You Never Can Tell”: This one’s easy: the song that soundtracks Mia and Vincent’s iconic dance at Jack Rabbit Slim’s.

He named his production company A Band Apart after the French New Wave iconoclast 1963 film Bande à Part, and he also claims on the Pulp Fiction DVD’s special features that Godard’s work inspired that film’s iconic dance scene between Mia and Vincent: “My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard because they just come out of nowhere. It’s so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it’s not a musical but he’s stopping the movie to have a musical sequence makes it all the more sweet.”\n\nGreen Acres: 1960s sitcom referenced in the film’s final section, during a conversation between Vincent and Jules.\n\nGreen, Al, “Let’s Stay Together”: The song that plays during the fixed-fight conversation between Butch and Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).\n\nThe Green Lantern: In a 1994 interview, Tarantino compared Jules’ Bible quote he recites before killing someone as similar to what this comic book character typically does, “saying his little speech.”\n\nThe Guns of Navarone: Or, as Jules incorrectly refers to the 1961 Western, “The Guns of the Navarone,” during a heated conversation with Vincent.\n\nGunsmoke: Winston Wolfe’s utterance to “get the hell out of Dodge” is a famous catchphrase associated with this long-running Western TV show.\n\nHappy Days: Jules references Fonzie from the 1970s/’80s retro-fixated sitcom during the final moments of the film.\n\nHis Girl Friday: The first page of Pulp Fiction’s script describes Pumpkin and Honey Bunny as conversing in “rapid-fire motion,” à la this 1940 Howard Hawks classic.\n\nHolly, Buddy: Mia and Vincent’s waiter at Jack Rabbit Slim’s is dressed to ape the mannerisms of the late singer.\n\nJoe Palooka: 1930s comic-strip-cum-multimedia-franchise (radio series! feature films! board games! wristwatches!) referenced by Vincent when he refers to Butch as “Palooka.”\n\nKarate Kiba (The Bodyguard): 1976 Sonny Chiba film that was the source for the mostly fabricated Bible quote (specifically, Ezekiel 25:17) that Jules recites several times throughout the film.\n\nKirby, Durward: The host of 1950s TV shows The Garry Moore Show and Candid Camera, as well as the name of the burger Mia orders at Jack Rabbit Slim’s.\n\nKiss Me Deadly: 1955 noir in which the lead, Ralph Meeker, served as inspiration for Butch as a character: “I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich’s Kiss Me Deadly.
