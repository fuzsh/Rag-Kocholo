        "text": "I’ve never really understood the appeal of George Clooney. I can look at him and objectively note that he is a nice-looking man, but I’ve never really found him personally appealing. Watching him in From Dusk Till Dawn, I finally “got” it and found him attractive. Very attractive. What can I say? Give a man a tattoo on his neck and I will be allllll over him.\n\nStick a tattoo on anything’s neck and I will instantly pay attention.\n\nI’ve also never been a particularly big fan of Tarantino, and tend to avoid projects that he’s involved with. His name for me conjures up movies with style over substance: the flashiness seems to be more important than character or plot, and I’m all about characters. I don’t get as much enjoyment out of a film if there isn’t character depth to it. I know that other people look for stylishness or artistic value in a film, so for people who prefer that kind of film he’s probably a great director. For me personally, it’s not my cup of tea.\n\nThe majority of pictures I found when googling this movie involved George Clooney pointing guns.\n\nBut From Dusk Till Dawn has vampires, and Juliette Lewis, and Salma Hayek, and that was definitely enough to make me determined to put it on my list for watching. I ended up really enjoying it. It does suffer from the same flaws as other Tarantino films, in that the characters seem too flashy to connect with and the plot is all over the place. There are a lot of interesting segments that remain simply unexplored – for example, the relationship of the two brothers at the heart of the piece is really interesting, especially the uncontrolled psychosis of the brother played by Tarantino himself. Yet this plot-strand is never allowed to go anywhere. It is played with and alluded to, but ultimately dropped.\n\nThe fight scenes in the Titty Twister are of course fabulous once they get going. They are so wonderfully over-the-top and playful with the genre. Lewis’s character gets the chance to shine, with a multi-bolt crossbow and some kick-ass lines. The “vampires” themselves are largely disappointing. I’ve seen in previous posts that I prefer my vampires to be charismatic and deadly: this film’s creatures are anything but that. If it was touted as a monster movie instead of a vampire one, it wouldn’t have been such a disappointment. Words have meanings – if I’m told a film is a vampire movie, I expect to see creepy pale people sucking blood rather than weird pig-faced creatures biting anything that moves.\n\nFor me, Salma Hayek could play all vampires ever.\n\nAside from the no-vampires disappointment, I had a fun time with this movie. The cast are all a lot of fun, even if Salma Hayek is criminally underused (and, predictably, completely sexualised the entire time that she’s on screen). There’s a lot that I would have liked to see further developed, but nonetheless it’s a decent film.\n\nThis post didn’t have any pictures of Juliette Lewis, so I decided it needed one.\n\n[3/5]"
