        "text": "Spike Lee once stated \"It's in my observation that parents kill more dreams than anybody\". Spike Lee is now known as one of the best film directors ever let me explain to you how as i show you the struggle of young spike to the great director he is today. Lee was born on March 20,1957, Atlanta Georgia, and moved to Brooklyn several years later. Spike lived in a broken home where his family was poor and Struggled to make money.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is well known and often criticized for his depiction of violence in his films. Although at times graphic, Tarantino’s violence holds a purpose. This paper will look at two films, Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction, and their depiction of violence and the aesthetics used. It will also look at classic film conventions and ultraviolence aesthetics used by Tarantino.\n\nMartin Charles Scorsese was born November 17, 1942. Suffering from asthma, he spent most of his time watching movies and by the time he was eight, he was already drawing his own storyboards that were directed/produced by himself. Although he considered going into priesthood, making movies was Scorsese’s true calling and he went on to make some of Hollywood’s most memorable films. Incorporating themes from his Italian American roots into his visceral, cinematic storytelling that has influenced generations of filmmakers. He is an American director, producer, screenwriter, actor, and film historian, whose career spans more than 53 years. Scorsese 's body of work addresses such themes as Sicilian-American identity, Roman Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, machismo, modern crime, and gang conflict. Many of his films are also notable for their depiction of violence and liberal use of profanity. Part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinema history. For three decades Scorsese has been at the forefront of American cinema. Its most avid champion and often its most electrifying practioner. The most cinematic of directors, he has also been among the most formally restless and exploratory, evolving an obsessive-compulsive mise-en-scene based on dynamic, agile camerawork and radical editing rhythms.\n\nThe classical Hollywood narrative is one of simplicity, linear continuity, and comprehensive storytelling, something typical American audiences were used to for most of films history. Quentin Tarantino, however, is not one to abide by the rules of cinema. The arguably auteur director reconfigures this narrative style with his 1994 classic Pulp Fiction. This film not only presented itself as a completely new and innovative take on what a film could be, but also created a foundation for which many films since have built their narratives from.\n\nMovie have always been a huge part of American culture. Moreover, we should all know that the United States of America is a culturally diverse nation. So, you would think that writers should attempt to make movies that are ethnically correct. For example, filmmakers play off of archetypes, and tropes, because Hollywood believes that we are incapable of understanding, and we could not possibly fathom a Latina women being anything other than the spicy Latin lover. It is also shocking to see that not many films focus on other cultures, beyond the “majority” white culture in the United States.\n\nStephen King is a contemporary writer who has written many books in his lifetime. In his novel Misery, he discusses the consequences or bad sides of being famous. This normal average man, other than being a world famous author, acts as a regular individual in his daily life. In Stephen King’s Misery, King uses Paul Sheldon, as a doppelganger of himself to describe the horrors of being a famous person in the worst situation, showing readers that it is not so bad to be a regular person.\n\nBoth of these writers have been influenced by 'The Godfather', its stereotypes, plots and gangster families, and although both writers have both influenced the genre in their separate ways, neither of them have made quite the impact that 'The Godfather' did. However, 'Pulp Fiction' adopted a large cult status, it became increasingly popular and became a Hollywood blockbuster, it did in its own re-invent the gangster genre regarding the association of humour and the subversion of the original 'Godfather' genre. Tarantino made 'Pulp Fiction' in 1994 and it was regarded as innovative and different, he plays around with the timeline of the three inter-connecting storylines that leaves you dazed and confused, but strangely satisfied. Tarantino manages this by introducing the protagonist of each story in the previous story, either as a minor character or a stock character.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino is an infamous director known for such beloved films like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs and many more. What sets Tarantino apart from other directors is his unique style. He frequently includes meaningless and innocent dialogue in his films, at least one dance scene, there is loads of blood and gore, and finally, the POV trunk/hood shot from a car. His unique style has allowed many people to fall in love with his films and patiently await the next one.\n\nNext, Tarantino, in regards to Sarris’ second premise of auteur criteria: the directors “distinguishable personality”. Must prove (which he does) that he has sustained and developed his own unique and identifiable signature, or as Sarris’ states “distinguishable personality”, throughout his whole movie career as a director. By examining all of Tarantino’s major films that he has directed, one can most definitely and undoubtedly find similar stylistic tendencies and motifs that make his films recognisable as a “Tarantin-esque” type film. And it is these specific stylistic qualities that make the audience view a film and say: “This is definitely a Tarantino film, I can just see it.”. While there are many characteristics that suggest a certain film carries the mark of Tarantino’s\n\nThere is no straightforward answer when one asks the question of: “What exactly makes a great director?”. The truth is that it can be an array of different factors, from the director having a distinctive or original way of shooting scene, to him or her having a well-written script. But what separates a great director from an iconic one, is how their films inspires not only the current, but also the new generation of filmmakers. The well-known Quentin Tarantino is one of those iconic directors. Born Quentin Jerome Tarantino on 27 March, 1963, he is arguably one of the most famous/influential modern directors of our generation to such an extent, that his name alone can sell a movie. Just as recognisable as his name, is his directing. Renowned\n\nThe movies that Tarantino makes are not just violent, but have a great storyline, which he writes. His most famous movies include: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, and the newest one, Inglourious Basterds (IMDb). Other, less famous ones are: Jackie Brown and Grindhouse (a double-feature consisting of Planet Terror, and Death Proof) (IMDb). To this day, people still talk about how great of a movie Pulp Fiction is. These movies are well known for their graphic violence, and sometimes profanity."
