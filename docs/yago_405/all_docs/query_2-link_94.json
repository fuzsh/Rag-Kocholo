Tensions rise as Jakob the father, a former priest, and his two children Kate and Scott, have to reluctantly support the gangsters. Once in Mexico they are to spend the night at the Titty Twister, a biker bar and strip club, until the next morning, where the Gecko brothers are to meet with Carlos whom they buy refuge from.
