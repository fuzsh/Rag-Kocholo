        "text": "1996\n\nCity Locations\n\nWashington: Redmond, Seattle, various locations throughout California\n\nLocation Types\n\nAmerican, Modern, House, Clubs/Bars, NatureScapes\n\nLocation Styles\n\nAmericana/Anywhere America, Camper, Motorhome, Parking Lot\n\nAbout From Dusk till Dawn\n\nIn the opening From Dusk till Dawn film scene, bank robbers Seth and Richie Gecko rob a liquor store, murdering two people. They take refuge in a hotel, and Seth goes to purchase food for them. He returns to find that Richie has murdered their hostage.\n\nA widowed pastor named Jacob Fuller takes his kids on a trip in the familyâs RV. When they make a stop at the motel, the Geckos kidnap them and force them to help them get across the border. When in Mexico, the brothers visit the Titty Twister, a popular strip joint in the heart of the desert. The Geckos are supposed to meet Carlos, their contact here at dawn. He committed to taking them to a safe place at a place called âEl Rey.â\n\nA bar fight occurs, and the brothers discover the employees are vampires whose goal is to kill the customers. Richie is attacked by Santanico Pandemonium, sustaining a bite. After he dies, Seth delivers a fatal blow to her by shooting a light fixture that falls and kills her. Scott, Kate, Jacob, Seth, and two others named Frost and Sex Machine are the only people to escape the bar.\n\nThe people killed in the bar are reincarnated as vampires, and the survivors end up having to kill them again. A group of vampires appears as a bat, forcing the survivors to barricade themselves indoors. Sex Machine is attacked and bitten. He transforms and bites both Jacob and Frost. Frost pushes Sex Machine through a door, and the other vampires descend upon the others. Frost becomes a vampire.\n\nScott, Kate, and Seth take refuge in a storeroom. Jacob, injured, chases after them with a gun. The trio creates weapons from cargo stolen from previous victims. They assemble an arsenal that includes holy water, a drill, and a crossbow. Jacob makes Kate and Scott promise to murder him when he converts to a vampire. The trio attacks the vampires. Sex Machine turns into a rodent and tries to take out Seth but is murdered instead. Jacob transforms into a vampire, and Scott struggles to kill him. Jacob bites him. Scott throws holy water on him and then shoots him, ending his life. Scott is surrounded by vampires who eat his flesh as he begs to be killed. Kate kills him. Vampires encompass Seth and Kate as light penetrates the building through the bullet holes. The vampires retreat. Carlos arrives on the scene, letting in light with the opening of the door, and the remaining vampires die.\n\nSeth rants to Carlos about the horrible place he chose to meet and insists on paying less for his entrance to El Rey. Seth gives Kate some money, and she leaves in the RV.\n\nA Texas Ranger stops by the convenience store and is chatting with the cashier of the store. He asks for permission to use the bathroom, and the cashier tells him yes. Seth re-enters the convenience store with a hostage, holding a gun to her head. The following dialogue takes place.\n\nSeth: You think Iâm fing playing with you, sshole? Do you want this little girl to die, or that little girl, or yourself, or your bosom buddy with the badge? Now I donât want to do it, but I will turn this place into the fing wild bunch if I think that you are fcking with me!\n\nCashier: What do you want from me? I did what you said.\n\nSeth: You let him use the bathroom. No store does that.\n\nCashier: He comes in here every day, and we bullsh*t. Heâs used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, heâd know that something was up.\n\nSeth: I want him out of here, in his car, and down the road, or you can change the name of this place to Bennyâs World of Blood.\n\nA building that has now been abandoned, the outside of this former From Dusk till Dawn film set is now encased by a fence. You will find this iconic site in Lancaster just off 14oth East Street, a main thoroughfare that leads directly into this town.\n\nThe Texas ranger exits the bathroom and begins conversing with the cashier again. He looks down at his wallet and is shot in the head by Richie. Blood spatters the cashier who becomes upset and begins shouting at the brothers. Richie tells Seth that when the men were talking, he mouthed the words âHelp usâ to the Texas ranger, and that is why Richie had to kill him. The brothers argue then Richie shoots the cashier, wounding but not killing him. Seth yells at him, âAye! You stop it! What the fck is your problem? Gdd*mnit!â\n\nRichie tells him that he clearly saw the cashier mouth the words when Seth had his back turned. Seth tells Richie to go start the car, and the cashier kicks over a display of pop cans. He tries to break into a safe as the men argue. He removes a gun and takes aim at Richie, hurting him. Seth returns fire, shooting rapidly at the cashier. Seth asks Richie if he is okay, and Richie says, âHe shot me in the f*ing hand. I told you he said, âHelp us!â\n\nIn a morbidly funny scene in From Dusk till Dawn, the cashier and Seth share this exchange.\n\nCashier: I never said, âHELP US!â\n\nSeth: Well, it doesnât matter now cause youâve got about two f*ing seconds to live. This From Dusk till Dawn scene also takes place in the former Bennyâs Liquor World. Though there is no public transit to this particular former film set, you can easily reach it by car."
