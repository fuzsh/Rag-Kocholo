        "text": "By Kate Karr\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuentin Tarantino is an outstanding filmmaker, known for his unique films and his passion for directing. Famed by his distinctive usage of elements within film, such as tense dialogue and the use of sound, Tarantino has grown into one of the most recognized directors of our time, and for good reason.\n\nAccording to, Quentin Tarantino — Awards, he’s earned himself numerous awards for his recognizable works.\n\nTo name a few… Pulp Fiction & Django Unchained won “Best Screenplay” for the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Critics Choice awards.\n\nPulp Fiction and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood won, “Best Motion Picture” for the Golden Globes.\n\nInglorious Bastards won “Best Director” for the American Film Critics, “Best Writing” and “Best Original Screenplay” for the Golden Globes.\n\nBackground Information\n\nWith hit films such as Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, and Inglorious Bastards, Tarantino has made a name for himself within the film industry, despite the fact that he only started as an indie filmmaker with his debut film, Reservoir Dogs.\n\nHis rise to fame is a unique one compared to other present-day, successful directors, as he was actually a high school dropout who didn’t go to film school. Instead, he learned what he knows about cinema through his job at a Blockbuster- where he’d spend his time watching movies and analyzing what he likes and dislikes from them.\n\nTennessee born but Los Angeles raised, living so close to the Hollywood scene also played a role in his interest and love for cinema.\n\nTarantino’s Unique Usage of Film Elements\n\nTense dialogue\n\nOne of the most mesmerizing aspects of Tarantino’s films is his incredible, captivating use of dialogue. His scripts are one of the most recognized elements of his works, and play a huge role in building up tension within his movies. In a VICE interview Samuel Jackson, a recurring actor in Tarantino’s films, states that,\n\n“The average movie script you look at is one third dialogue and two thirds action, Quentin’s work is pretty much the opposite”.\n\nFor example, in the opening scene of Inglorious Bastards, Tarantino created a twenty-minute clip of a Nazi interrogating a French farmer in his home, as he suspected that the farmer was hiding a Jewish family. The conversation is very laid-back and relaxed throughout, as they drink milk and smoke out of their pipes casually. The slow pace of this scene only added onto the tension that Tarantino was trying to build up for the rest of the movie due to the fact that what was at stake was anything but casual.\n\nThis scene could have set up the plot of the movie in less time, but Tarantino works with enchanting dialogue to keep the audience engaged and feeling the suspense.\n\nNonlinear storytelling\n\nTarantino has a pattern of telling his stories in a non-chronilogical order in his movies. It is seen in The Hateful Eight, Django Unchained, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and more. This style of presenting the narrative makes for a more engaged audience, as we are imposed to slowly put the pieces together as the movie plays. Bouncing around from different events also just makes for an overall more rewarding watching experience as it keeps us at the edge of our seats until the movie is completely done and all of the different storylines have come together to tell one big, interconnected story.\n\nUnfiltered scenes of language and violence\n\nOne of the many aspects that make Tarantino’s movies stand out compared to other directors is the raw, unfiltered nature of his movies. He’s been under a lot of fire because of how controversial his films are. While this stirs the pot when it comes to discusssions that cover topics like his portrayal of historic events such as slavery and the Holocaust, the crudity of his films is what makes an audience member feel while watching his movies. His intent with this is to purposely shock the audience and get them to feel a range of emotions, as he has mentioned in this interview.\n\nPopularizing the Trunk Shot\n\nOne of the components that Tarantino has popularized within film is the famous Trunk Shot. Depicted in most of his movies, the trunk shot simply consists of the camera recording from a lower angle, recording upwards.\n\nThis shot has added a little bit of a fun, and almost interactive experience for the audience when watching his films.\n\nPop Culture References\n\nAnother element that is greatly appreciated within Tarantino’s films is his references to pop culture, especially from the sixties to the eighties. One of the ways that Tarantino pays homage to older films is through his arguably most popular scene; the dancing scene between Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction. This scene is inspired by the dance contest shown in Jean-Luc Godard’s 1963 film, Band of Outsiders.\n\nPutting His own Twist on Older Movies\n\nTarantino’s hit movie series, the Kill Bill collection, is actually inspired by the French movie, Le Mariee Etait En Noir (The Bride Wore Black), a film in which a widowed bride hunts down the five men that killed her husband on her wedding day. Similarly, Kill Bill deals with a former assassin trying to find the man who put her into a four year coma after attempting to kill her on her wedding day.\n\nGenre blending\n\nWesterns, action, crime, and even comedy are all categories that Tarantino’s films can fall under because of his amazing blending of genres. He is able to take serious storylines that deal with violence or crime and also throw comedy into the mix.\n\nFor example, the KKK members arguing and complaining about not being able to see through their masks when they’re riding their horses at night in Django Unchained, is a way that Tarantino has incorporated comedy into a movie that deals with serious themes such as slavery and violence.\n\nConclusion\n\nTarantino’s brilliant usage of film elements within his movies has gotten him to where he is today, leaving a lasting impression within in the film industry. From his unfiltered scripts to captivating dialogue, he has surely made himself one of the most influential and respected filmmakers of our time. Tarantino isn’t afraid to go against the typical expectations in film, and because of that boldness he has truly become a one-of-a-kind director who’s films continue to stand out and thrive.\n\nTarantino’s talent has encouraged other directors to also break down walls and try new ways of storytelling. Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Night and Oppenheimer, has talked about how Tarantino is one of his inspirations for his own works. He is one of many to credit Tarantino as an inspiration for their own projects.\n\nBelow I’ve attached a list of movies that pay homage to Quentin Tarantino’s style or films.\n\nBest Movies Inspired by Quentin Tarantino\n\nQuentin Tarantino will continue to remain relevant in the world of cinema, and he will forever be appreciated by many thanks to the amazing stories he’s written. Not only has he earned himself a secure place in the film industry, but he has also earned himself an honorable word in the Oxford Dictionary:"
