        "text": "K. and me are still watching the occasional vampire movie, just in case you were wondering. The last ones we saw were \"The Lost Boys\" (goofy but fun) and \"The Lost Boys II\" (not as bad as I had expected it to be). \"The Lost Boys III\" is still pending (I heard that it is surprisingly fun thanks to a great performance by Corey Feldman). Anyway, last night I was like \"Hey, how about one of those two?\", presenting her with \"John Carpent's Vampires\" and \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", two I had previously watched (multiple times) and liked. Well, the title of this post should tell you which one was chosen.\n\nSo \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", eh? Directed by Robert Rodriguez, written by Quentin Tarantino (based on a story by renowned makeup artist Robert Kurtzman), starring George Clooney in a rather uncharacteristic role... It has become kind of a cult-classic ever since its (relatively modest) debut in 1996, spawning two sequels, a video game continuation and a remake in the form of a TV-show (that I haven't seen so I can't comment on its quality). So it has to be good, right? Well, just yesterday, I would have told you that it is. I mean, I had watched it four or five times or so (although the last time was twelve years or so ago) and for a while had a poster of it hanging on my bedroom wall, so... yeah, figures.\n\nThe thing is... I really didn't enjoy it very much last night. I can't say whether it has aged poorly, whether my recent viewing-habits (mostly TV-shows nowadays) have had an impact on my taste or whether it was kind of bad altogether even 24 years ago. Perhaps a bit of all of those things. Oh, sure, it does have its moments. The central twist of the movie (which I kind of have already given away, but it's no big secret anyway by now, everybody and their friggin' dog seems to know that this is a vampire movie) is executed with aplomb, most of the effects hold up to this day, Harvey Keitel does an excellent job (especially considering what he has to work with) and so is George Clooney, who - as said - plays a role that differs wildly from his usual on-screen-personas.\n\nBut I'm sorry to say, the rest of the movie is kind of crap. While the central idea (make half of a gritty gangster-movie and then out of the blue and without warning smash it head first into an action-splatter-horror-movie) is sound, both halves of the resulting movie are neither strong enough by themselves nor in combination with each other to help the venture overcome its obvious flaws. Characters are flat and one-dimensional, their arcs not only kind of come out of but also lead nowhere, everything feels rushed and meaningless and the tone is all over the place. The first half is especially jarring, because a lot of elements that feel like they've been ripped right out of something like a 70's Italian terror movie clash badly with the script's constant need to exude coolness and incorporate humor. I've said it before, I'm not a big fan of Tarantino. His script here is absolutely painful, for every semi-deliberate line there's five or six that just come off as pretentious and forced. The characters are terrible, because not only are they tired stereotypes par excellence, they are presented in such a slapdash way that every bit of potential interest evaporates quickly. \"But that's just a means to an end to reach the glorious splatter-half of the movie\", I hear people say. Yeah. That's what I thought as well throughout the first half of the movie last night.\n\nThe problem is, the second half isn't very good either. There's a couple of fun moments and good effects in there, sure, but the action-sequences are absolutely terrible, unattractively shot, badly edited, just really boring, static and toothless in general. And while there's a couple of decently bloody FX, the whole thing isn't half as gory as I thought that I remembered it to be. No squibs, no fountains of blood, just a bit of claymation-explosions and quick cutaways to not show anything too interesting on screen. Yes, it wasn't a very high budgeted production, but Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, (the late) Stuart Gordon and David Cronenberg for example did so much more with so much less years before Rodriguez tried his hand.\n\nAnd that's a good peroration altogether. Everything that Rodriguez and Tarantino (who's an abysmal actor, by the way) tried with \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" has been done far better elsewhere before. It kind of pains me to say that, but I honestly can't recommend the movie anymore. It's a tonally awkward, shoddily scripted, just altogether not very interesting mess of a movie that pales in comparison to its peers. If you want a tense siege-movie, go watch Carpenter's \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (huge influence on \"From Dusk Till Dawn\"). If you want a wonderfully shlocky gorefest, go watch \"Braindead\" (that's \"Dead Alive\" if you're American) or \"Evil Dead II\". If you want an interesting gangster-roadmovie, perhaps go for \"Natural Born Killers\", which is actually a pretty good movie. If you want all of the things at the same time, then yeah, there's probably only \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" out there for you. But as I expressed on multiple occasions, \"the best at what it is\" isn't that useful if it's still crap.\n\n[+] Dice rolls"
