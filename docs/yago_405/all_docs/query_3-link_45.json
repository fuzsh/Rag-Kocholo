        "text": "Here's the problem that From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series has, and it's only gotten worse as the season's gone on: If you've seen the movie the show's based on, you know what's coming.\n\nFull Review | Oct 3, 2018\n\nThere's a more pronounced supernatural edge to the show than the film ever had, which could be a great thing if Rodriguez and co. take the time to properly flesh out the extensive Aztec mythology that the original film merely hinted at.\n\nFull Review | Oct 3, 2018\n\nStarting from right before the original movie's storyline gives them the time to get us used to the new faces of the Gecko brothers, and to give us the backstory that the film didn't have time to do anything more than hint at.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Oct 3, 2018\n\nWhat's the point of remaking something if you can't do it better than the original?\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Sep 30, 2014\n\nIt's hard to say how the show will develop as it gets into the bulk of the actual story from Tarantino's script or as Rodriguez abdicates the director's chair to other filmmakers but this is a solid set-up installment.\n\nFull Review | Sep 30, 2014\n\nThe characters, the sympathetic ones, are rounded enough so that you feel for them a little when things threaten to go or go bad. It has more of a moral center.\n\nFull Review | Mar 12, 2014\n\nOn this evidence, From Dusk Till Dawn has made a healthy transition from big screen to small.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7.8/10 | Mar 12, 2014\n\nRodriguez turns [the] pattern upside down so frequently that, of course, we quickly anticipate the opposite ending for various characters. That's probably fine with Rodriguez because he knows he already has our attention.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 11, 2014\n\nThe problem is the movie's mashup of two genres worked precisely because it was so compact and silly, whereas stretching it out over 10 episodes, as Rodriguez and company have done, can't help but look pompous and flabby.\n\nFull Review | Mar 11, 2014\n\nI suppose you could save time by just going back and watching the original movie (which starred George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the script), but if you liked that one, you'll almost certainly dig this.\n\nFull Review | Mar 11, 2014\n\nFans of the film will devour the TV series, and nonfans might give it a shot. Just be forewarned that it's not Blue Bloods. It's more like cold blood.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Mar 11, 2014"
