        "text": "Texas Ranger Earl McGraw engages store clerk Pete Bottoms in conversation inside Benny’s World of Liquor. McGraw mentions the ongoing manhunt for criminal brothers Seth and Richard Gecko, currently on a crime spree locally. When McGraw goes to the bathroom, Seth and Richie emerge from the shadows with their hostages and remind Pete to keep cool. McGraw returns and Richie shoots him in the head, prompting a gunfight with Pete that results in the Gecko brothers blowing up the store.\n\nSeth and Richie bring their bank teller hostage Gloria Hill with them to the Dew Drop Motel. While Seth is out getting food, Richie rapes and kills Gloria.\n\nSince the death of his wife Jenny, former pastor Jacob Fuller has suffered a crisis of faith. Driving an RV with his son Scott and his daughter Kate, Jacob pulls into the Dew Drop Motel where they are taken hostage by the brothers. Seth and Richie force the Fullers to sneak them across the border into Mexico.\n\nThe Geckos have the Fullers drive them to a strip club called Titty Twister where Seth is to meet his contact Carlos before he and Richie can move on to El Rey. Outside the club, Seth beats up the emcee/bouncer Chet Pussy and Richie kicks Chet in the ribs after he falls.\n\nBartender Razor Charlie refuses to serve the quintet since the Titty Twister caters exclusively to bikers and truckers. Jacob shows Razor his Class 2 license for the RV and the group takes a table where they enjoy the burlesque performance of Santanico Pandemonium dancing with an albino python.\n\nChet Pussy enters and confronts the Gecko brothers with Razor Charlie and another thug at his side. Seth and Richie pull their guns and a fight breaks out. At the sight of spilled blood, Santanico, Razor, and many of the other club patrons turn into vampires and begin attacking the humans. Santanico bites and kills Richie. A biker named Sex Machine and a truck driver named Frost emerge as the only surviving humans to fight alongside Seth and the Fullers. Sex Machine stakes Razor with a broken pool cue. Seth kills Santanico by dropping a chandelier that pierces her chest.\n\nRichie reanimates as a vampire and Seth is forced to kill him. Seth and the others then barricade the front door as they vanquish the remaining vampires. Sex Machine succumbs to a bite wound suffered earlier and he bites Frost. Frost throws Sex Machine through a wall that releases vampire bats into the room and the battle is renewed.\n\nSeth and the Fullers hide in a storeroom where they arm themselves with weapons and prepare to make a final stand against the vampires. Having been bitten earlier, Jacob makes his children promise to kill him when he turns. Jacob becomes a vampire during the subsequent melee and he bites his son Scott. Scott is then torn apart by a pack of the creatures.\n\nSeth and Kate are surrounded as the last two survivors. Shafts of sunlight from holes in the walls enter and force back the vampires. Kate shoots more holes as Carlos arrives outside and breaks down the barricade. The resulting blast of sunlight kills the remaining vampires inside. Seth plans to go to El Rey with Carlos. Kate asks to go with him but Seth insists that they go their separate ways after giving Kate several stacks of money. As everyone leaves, the camera reveals the back of the Titty Twister and shows that the club is actually the top of an ancient Aztec pyramid.\n\nReview:\n\nQuentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez make for a likely pair of bedfellows. Like-minded with similar interests as cinephiles, both men have deep passions for the grindhouse era of exploitation film, graphic novel pulp fiction, and hyperstylized cinematic sensationalism. As filmmakers, both men had their breakout successes in 1992 with “Reservoir Dogs” and “El Mariachi” respectively, and subsequently vaulted along nearly identical trajectories of film nerd superstardom as independent multi-threat mavericks (Quentin as writer/director/actor, Robert as writer/director/everything-else-except-actor).\n\nSeparated only by five years of age and completely different bloodlines, the parallels in their imagination inspirations and professional backgrounds have otherwise bound them as brothers whether they are working in tandem on set or palling around in civilian life. With so much in common, it is odd how readily their collaborations shine a light on what makes them so different. Their “Grindhouse” double bill a decade later would capitalize on their contributions to a shared project being fully separate entities, but 1996’s “From Dusk Till Dawn” was first to show that when Tarantino and Rodriguez get together, they create something of two visions instead of a singular one.\n\nFrom a story by Robert Kurtzman, the “K” in KNB EFX, Quentin drafted a script missing the staccato pep characteristic of his other 1990’s screenplays, but still very much rooted in the typical Tarantino tropes of diners, Big Kahuna burgers, and people trapped in car trunks. Verbal and nonverbal nods to pop cult references including “Gidget,” John Carpenter’s “Assault on Precinct 13,” and king of all vampire slayers Peter Cushing round out other trademarks identifying “From Dusk Till Dawn” as the unmistakable offspring of Tarantino’s pen.\n\nCool hand conversation between John Hawkes and Michael Parks lights a fuse of quiet intensity before George Clooney and Tarantino himself burst on scene for gunplay action like only QT can write and RR can direct. And so it is that writer and director grin at each other while knowingly setting the stage for a midpoint carpet pull when their crooks on the lam crime thriller turns into something else entirely.\n\nCharacter-driven, dialogue-oriented drama creates the initial expectation of a “True Romance” and “El Mariachi” hybrid. Clooney and Tarantino are incorrigible criminal brothers on a terror spree towards Mexican sanctuary that leaves a trail of bodies, hostages, and blown up liquor stores in their wake. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis are two of the three unlucky family members compelled by a gun to mule the siblings over the border. Keitel is a pastor suffering a crisis of faith, making the serendipitous arrival of almost certain to come tragedy a test from God like no other. The Gecko brothers have their own figurative demons to battle too, although everyone’s battle is about to become more literal.\n\nThat one hour prologue is basically a complicated smokescreen to catch the audience off guard when punchy wordplay and complex character arcs give up the limelight to pointed fangs, pointed stakes, and pointed fingers at a viewer who may be getting more than s/he bargained for. “From Dusk Till Dawn” is two movies in one, or maybe just one and a half. Pulling the switcheroo of an abrupt genre change is a gutsy call with the potential for plenty of fun. It is also a choice that carries a fair share of risk that pays off for some, but not necessarily for others.\n\nEver pour yourself a “suicide” at a soda fountain? “From Dusk Till Dawn” is a little bit like that. Orange soda and Dr. Pepper taste great on their own, so wouldn’t they go down even better when mixed together with Sprite, root beer, and Cherry Coke too? Much like the movie, it is an overloaded taste experience that dilutes what is best when enjoyed separately and can only be digested by those with strong stomach linings for excessive corn syrup and artificial colors.\n\nThe crime thriller appeals to one sensibility, the mindless vampire violence appeals to another, and the whole shebang appeals to anyone with no preference towards either one of the two. Those reeled in by that first half are prone to disappointment when the developing backstories and deepening relationships stall in their tracks, as though Tarantino wrote in complexities without payoff knowing that he would never resolve those threads. It is a convenient out that an eruption of madcap murderous mayhem and crackling special effects interrupts having to come up with a proper conclusion for that half of the story.\n\nThose suckered in just as equally by the second half mania of decapitated heads, digital bats, and Salma Hayek dancing with an albino python might not mind much. Chapter two of “From Dusk Till Dawn” has less of a story than “Three Little Pigs” and is arguably just as childish. But how much of a problem is that supposed to be when that was Rodriguez and Tarantino’s intention from the outset? That is for the viewers to decide if they want their genres delivered in different cups or splashed together into one combined sea of sloshing, sugary, unashamed cinema.\n\nReview Score: 75"
