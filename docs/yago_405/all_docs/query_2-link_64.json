        "text": "Whether or not you have been to QFT, we want to hear from you about your film habits and what you think of our programme. Take this short survey and be in with a chance to win Â£50 of high street vouchers.\n\nSurvey closes Fri 15 Mar at noon.\n\nThe Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), two dangerous outlaws on a wild crime spree, kidnap a father and his two kids and head south to a seedy Mexican bar to hide out in safety. Soon they realise that they're not in a typical bar, as the entire place begins to teem with vicious, blood-sucking vampires. With the odds stacked greatly against them, the Geckos are forced to team up with their hostages in order to make it out alive.\n\nDirected by Robert Rodriguez and written by Tarantino, From Dusk Till Dawn is everything you’d want in an all action horror vampire movie. Sexy vampire queens? Check. Dirty jokes and deadly monsters? Check, check. Harvey Keitel as a bow-wielding pastor who lost his faith? Check. Now all you need is a ticket."
