        "text": "Super cheesy movie, definitely a cult (that I'm not apart of) classic. It's not awful, it's just not great. Don't get me wrong, I love Tarantino movies AND vampire movies, but the the two together do not work for me. Also, the pedo vibe from Taratino's \"character\" makes me very uncomfortable!\n\nAwesome cult classic This is an awesome movie. It has everything you would expect from a Quinton Tarremtino classic! Probably don't want to watch this one with the kids.\n\nWhen you say cult-classic, it means cult-classic. I love George Clooney and the story in this, it doesn't get old and super cheesy. It's vampires and heroes winning, which is a ultimately a feel good. It is pretty adult with lots of nudity like any horror movie you watch, borderline softcore in this case. It exhibits much of the female subservience, which doesn't appeal to my senses but this is a whole different area trying to go kind of rogue and wild-west-y. A must watch for any horror enthusiast.\n\nThis film is in one of my Top Five Favorite Vampire Movies of all time. Quintin Tarrentino and Robert Rodriguez's combined work proves to be both profitable and enjoyable. For first time viewers, the first half an hour does not give off the vampire vibe. That is, until the main characters reach Mexico. If you are a fan of vampires and haven't seen this film, why? Add this to your personal collection. You will not be disappointed.\n\nThe story line was good to be, but it had way to much nudity for my taste and he language was off the chart, I was so disappointed for I was get into the start of the movie, but it just to nasty of a movie\n\nI think this movie is awesome! I love vampire movies and this was one of my favorites... just behind interview and queen of the damned :D the 2nd and 3rd tie in well but aren't as good in my opinion.\n\nI love vampires. I love vampire movies. I love hot vampire slayers. Can you guess that I love this movie. This is one of those movies I will watch over and over. I love the characters, the interaction, the pace, the suspense and the intrigue. Only thing I'd change is the end when they go their separate ways. What can I say? I'm a sucker for happy endings. Or should I say, happier endings???"
