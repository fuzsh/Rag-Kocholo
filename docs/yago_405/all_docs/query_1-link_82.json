        "text": "The role of a producer in the filmmaking process involves financial and technical responsibilities, as well as creative responsibilities. As the industry evolved, producers were typically associated with the financial and technical side of filmmaking, more so than the creative side. However, in the last three decades, more and more producers are being recognized for their creative involvement (Pardo 2). In 1997, David Heyman, a British film producer, discovered the book Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by J.K. Rowling (McNary). Almost immediately, Heyman began working to secure the film rights, having no idea that he was embarking on a project that, according to IMDb, would become the highest grossing film franchise in history (IMDb). His creative involvement, on the production of the films, stems from the fact that he truly loves the Harry Potter book series. The success of the franchise had much to do with what can be referred to as the “Potter formula”: Heyman’s direct involvement in the novel to film adaption process, his decision to work with a team of Potter fans, many of which returned to work on all 8 installments, and his careful selection of directors who shared his vision. This “Potter Unit” of returning cast and crew members included writer Steve Kloves, production designer Stuart Craig, the majority of cast members, as well as many more. Having produced all\n\nThey say there are no rules in filmmaking but some may see it otherwise. Having these features involved in movies go along with the genre and tonality. Some of the greatest and iconic films over the course of history involve technical editing and directing skills that are all put together strategically. There are several key aspects that include the plot, characters, and especially the theme because it lingers the entire film. The film “Pulp Fiction” directed in 1994 by Quentin Tarantino is based on the life of hitmen starring Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta.\n\nAt a very young age of eight, David Fincher’s passion for cinema grew when he was inspired by the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Born in 1962 Denver, Colorado, David Fincher moved to Ashland, Oregon in his teens, where he graduated from Ashland High School. During high school, he directed plays, designed sets, and managed lighting after school. One summer, he and a friend attended the Berkley Film Institute’s summer program, where he hoped to learn film as a true art form but instead was taught the technical production. Either way he was happy to engage is this and as his early film industry career started, he was a production assistant at his local television news station. Years went by as he directed propaganda films followed by becoming a well-known music director until his first movie feature debut Aliens 3 in 1992. However, the American director David Fincher didn’t become a modern 21st century visionary until his creation of the film Se7en (1995). The huge success from this film started Fincher’s popularity in the film industry. From there he continued to make ironic movies we know today such as: Fight Club (1999), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010), Gone Girl, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nHere in this scene of Pulp Fiction, we see John Travolta & Samuel L. Jackson as duo-ed hitmen with deep and philosophical conversations throughout the film. I think this scene after Travolta's character accidentally shoots a man, an intense scene, best displays Travolta and Jackson's contrasting styles as they clean up the bloody mess. Travolta, who studied method acting for years, always plays an easy-going and laid back type of character in his films (\"Grease\", anyone?). Samuel L. Jackson on the other hand, is famous for playing a very rumbustious character with colorful language in many of his films, and Pulp Fiction is no different. I feel that such differing styles, as both are playing main characters, works because it brings balance to\n\nThe director is a storyteller first, claims Scorsese. He quotes Raoul Walsh: “If you haven’t got the story, you haven’t got anything.” Documentary style films were always a secondary to fiction. This has improved as the industry matured, but still holds true today. “For better or for worse, a Hollywood director is an entertainer. He is in the business of telling stories,” Scorsese tells us. He outlines the birth of the classic American genres, ones that moviegoers take for granted today. Directors, producers, and fans alike love familiar tropes and genres. Similar themes pervade all movies, recycled and reworked into new\n\nThe auteur theory first began in the 1950s by a group of young French scholars who wrote for the journal Cahiers du Cinema. Most significant of these scholars was Francois Truffaut who wrote an article that served as the touchstone for auteurism. The auteur principle is used as a descriptive method that focuses not on whether a director is a great director but rather on the fundamental composition of a director’s work. This principle therefore focuses on a director’s thematic and stylistic uniformity, established filming method, personal artistic vision, recurring themes and most significantly his control over a film’s production. Auteur films are distinctive due to the unique artistic vision of its director and the fact that it imbues his personality. The auteur term is consequently used to distinguish directors whose works are distinguishable from others. It is important to note that not all directors can be auteurs. Only certain directors were able to express their personality through their works with the use of themes and style and would therefore to continuously produce the same types of stories. Looking at all of a director’s work was the only way to identify their individuality and to be able to place their mark on a film suggested the strength of the director as an artist.\n\nPulp Fiction is a classic crime film that put writer and director Quentin Tarantino at the forefront of modern filmmakers. Pulp Fiction was released in 1994 and was only the second of Tarantino’s films. Pulp Fiction was a huge success and put him on the map early in his career. Since Pulp Fiction’s release in the earl 90’s Tarantino has written and directed many other notable movies. Most of Tarantino’s movies are centered on violent subject matter and criminal activity.\n\nPulp Fiction is a cult classic. Released in 1994 by co-writer and director, Quentin Tarantino, this movie is a neo-noir crime drama/dark comedy that revolves around several seemingly independent stories that intertwine as the film progresses. The way this film came together was a bit of an intentional accident. The two writers for the film, Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary, weren’t planning on writing this at all. Originally, they were going to do a short film then decided that wouldn’t get studio funding so they set out to create a trilogy with a different director writing each part, Tarantino writing one, Avary writing another, then a third director would do the final part. They never found a third director and Tarantino decided to make\n\nThere is no straightforward answer when one asks the question of: “What exactly makes a great director?”. The truth is that it can be an array of different factors, from the director having a distinctive or original way of shooting scene, to him or her having a well-written script. But what separates a great director from an iconic one, is how their films inspires not only the current, but also the new generation of filmmakers. The well-known Quentin Tarantino is one of those iconic directors. Born Quentin Jerome Tarantino on 27 March, 1963, he is arguably one of the most famous/influential modern directors of our generation to such an extent, that his name alone can sell a movie. Just as recognisable as his name, is his directing. Renowned\n\nThe movies that Tarantino makes are not just violent, but have a great storyline, which he writes. His most famous movies include: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, and the newest one, Inglourious Basterds (IMDb). Other, less famous ones are: Jackie Brown and Grindhouse (a double-feature consisting of Planet Terror, and Death Proof) (IMDb). To this day, people still talk about how great of a movie Pulp Fiction is. These movies are well known for their graphic violence, and sometimes profanity.\n\nAn art director is typically the overseer of the other works by designers and artist who produce images for television, films, live performances, advertisements, or video games. He or she determines the overall style or tone desired for each project and articulates their vision to artists who submit images. These images include illustrations, graphics, photographs, charts and graphs, or stage and movie sets. Art director’s work with both the client and the design team to find the right looks for whatever project or set they are working on."
