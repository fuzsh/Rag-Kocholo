        "text": "It’s a warm January Monday just outside of Austin, Texas, and Robert Rodriguez is revisiting the past. He’s at a roadside flea market off of Highway 290—the sort of access-road swap meet that dots highways throughout Texas—and at the moment, there are no old copies of Texas Monthly or collections of Cowboys memorabilia for sale. The flea market’s closed on weekdays, and the dusty exterior has been converted into something more useful, at least to a filmmaker busy trying to expand on a story he told once before: it’s a border crossing, and the infamous Gecko Brothers, Richie and Seth, are attempting to sneak into Mexico while hiding in the back of Jacob Fuller’s mobile home. It’s one of the tensest moments in From Dusk Till Dawn, the 1996 film that Rodriguez directed off of a Quentin Tarantino script.\n\nBack then, Richie and Seth were Tarantino and George Clooney—who had yet to take a leading role in a movie at that point—but now, they’re played by Zane Holtz and D.J. Cotrona, two young actors who carry some bank-robber cool as they hide in the back of the truck. That truck is driven, in the episodic television remake of the original film, premiering on March 11 on Rodriguez’s El Rey Network, by Robert Patrick, who replaces Harvey Keitel in the role of the faithless preacher who learns, when things get ugly on the other side of the board, to become “a mean motherfucking servant of God.” Also being replaced, in the version of From Dusk Till Dawn Rodriguez is filming in and around Austin: California, where he shot the original film in 1995—the only theatrically released feature that the director ever shot in Los Angeles.\n\n“The whole time, I was just wanting to come back to Texas and shoot there,” Rodriguez recalls from his office at Troublemaker Studios, which is built on a patch of land that once housed the aircrafts that former governors George W. Bush and Ann Richards used to fly in and out of Austin. “I mean, From Dusk Till Dawn took place in Texas, and it was being shot in L.A.—we were trying to find Texas-looking locations. We were driving around, trying to find areas that look like Texas, and there was nothing, and I just thought, ‘We’d find these locations so quickly down there in Austin.’ It was ridiculous how long we were going, and it still all looked like Candyland.”\n\nRevisiting From Dusk Till Dawn is obviously a passion for Rodriguez, who’s betting that the series helps attract viewers to the cable network he launched, in partnership with Univision, at the tail end of 2013. But it’s nothing compared to his passion for working in his hometown.\n\nRodriguez’s first feature film, El Mariachi, was shot largely in Mexico, and it turned him into a sensation in the indie-film boom of the early 90s; the film was picked up by Columbia Pictures, who magnified the $7,000 budget by a factor of one hundred for Rodriguez’s next film, the sequel Desperado. Rodriguez intended to edit Desperado himself, in Austin, but found resistance from the studio.\n\n“I wanted to edit it in my studio, but they would only allow me to edit it if it was close by, so they could watch me to make sure I knew what I was doing—because they have never had a director edit his own stuff before,” Rodriguez laughs. “They were like ‘One, in Texas, two, editing?’ That’s just unheard of.”\n\nEventually, the studio compromised. Because he had edited El Mariachi, he would be allowed to edit Desperado—but only if he moved to Los Angeles to do it. While he was there, the famously prolific filmmaker (18 films in 22 years) made time to shoot a movie for Showtime called Roadracers, a segment in the anthology film Four Rooms (along with Quentin Tarantino), and From Dusk Till Dawn.\n\n“I was only up there for, like, six months,” he says. By the time he’d finished From Dusk Till Dawn, he was determined to return to Austin and make his films in his hometown. “We rented an empty warehouse in downtown L.A. that had been a Lawry’s spice factory, and we built our set in there,” he recalls. “I thought, ‘Wow, I could do this in Texas—I could find a big empty warehouse and build my sets in there and shoot.’”\n\nRodriguez returned to Austin for his next film—1998’s body-snatcher horror picture, The Faculty—and began assembling homegrown talent. “It was a good warm-up to start building up crews,” he says. “My crew really had to have their stuff together, and I wanted to pull it off in Austin. I did The Faculty here, met a lot of the crew for the first time then, and started working with them and exposing them to this new guerrilla way of movie-making that I figured out on Mariachi, which is just getting a lot of production value out of very little money.”\n\nGetting a lot of production value on a low budget quickly became Rodriguez’s stock in trade—something, he suggests, the Austin crews picked up very quickly. Following The Faculty, he made a dozen other features—including four films in the Spy Kids franchise, two in the Machete franchise, and two adaptations of Sin City (the second of which will be released this summer)—while only exceeding a budget of $40 million once. His crew learned how to shoot digitally years before Hollywood picked up the trend (“We literally opened up the box to our digital cameras when they first came in and didn’t even know how to use them,” he says); learned to transform the land and hangars from a former airport that George W. Bush’s gubernatorial administration offered to Rodriguez and fellow Austin filmmaker Richard Linklater (whose Austin Studios is down the block) into a fully functional movie studio; and learned how to make movies that Hollywood desperately wanted for a fraction of the cost, all in his own backyard.\n\nThese days, Austin is very much a crew town, but it’s an everything-else town, too. Since 1992, when Rodriguez made El Mariachi, the town’s population has spiked by 75 percent, from a relatively sleepy college town of 482,000 to a booming metropolis of 843,000. Crews can work on productions at Troublemaker, or Linklater’s Austin Studios, on the steady array of projects—which, as Rodriguez’s El Rey Network enters its next phase of creating original scripted programming, will only grow. They can work on other television productions that occur in the city, like NBC’s Revolution. They can work on any number of countless indie productions happening at any given time, often by filmmakers who cite Rodriguez (and Linklater, who Rodriguez is careful to point out has also played a huge role in the development of Austin’s film culture) as an inspiration.\n\nTim League, founder and C.E.O. of the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema chain of movie theaters (and its associated distribution house, Drafthouse Films), has been a keen observer of the Austin film scene—and Rodriguez’s career—since he opened his first theater in 1997. “Without people making bigger budget movies and television series in Austin, then you don’t get as many film professionals gravitating here,” says League. “If there’s no business, then there’s inherently no film scene—so by staying local and by making his movies here, and creating jobs in the industry, he’s ostensibly built the foundation of the industry here.”\n\nLeague suggests that there’s more that could be done to develop Austin as a film town—he names various tax incentives that states like Louisiana and New Mexico, or cities like Vancouver, offer that Texas fails to match—but the fact that there’s as much film business happening in Austin without those incentives speaks to how desirable the scene that Rodriguez helped build has become.\n\n“Everybody would rather be here than anywhere else,” Rodriguez laughs. “If you had to film anywhere, where would you rather film than [Austin]? Shreveport? Vancouver? Bulgaria? You literally get tax benefits, but you have to go to the weirdest places. Actors are like, ‘I didn’t become an actor so I could drive around Wasserstadt!’\"\n\nThese days, Rodriguez has no trouble attracting talent to Austin. His forthcoming Sin City sequel stars an embarrassment of riches, in terms of the actors involved—Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Lady Gaga, et cetera, et cetera—and, of course, there’s From Dusk Till Dawn, a series which has involved eight grueling months of seven-days-a-week production, from August to mid-March, for its 10 episodes.\n\nRodriguez himself has directed four of those episodes (he was originally slated only to handle the first two), which speaks to the fun he’s having, and the pace he’s able to maintain by continuing to work on his own terms. Troublemaker’s lot looks like an extended backyard; its massive green screen, which he uses for films like Sin City, runs the entire length of one of the airport hangars. In many ways, despite the budgets, technology, and talented cast and crew, Rodriguez is still running around with a camera, shooting movies in his garage.\n\n“I’m still in my backyard,” he says. “I’m still shooting at home with my family. My crew’s my extended family. I started my first films, and they starred my brothers and sisters, because there were 10 of us, and they were the crew. I love working at home—I still edit all of these movies at my house. I literally would shoot in my backyard still for some of my features. And my crew and my cast are just an extension—even my office is painted like my house, because I’m at home here. When your personal life and your work life are one and the same, then it all just goes up together.”"
