        "text": "Remember in the 90s when nosferatu were scary and menacing, before Twilight (2008) and The Vampire Diaries (2009)? Works of art like Coppola’s Dracula (1992) paid tribute to the gothic tradition of 1930s Universal monster movies. Bloodthirsty creatures of the night weren’t played out yet on every media platform. This was an era when hardcore fans kept the mythos alive and true to its demonic roots.\n\nAudiences were lucky that some of the biggest monster movie buffs also happened to be the best storytellers in Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino – who had won an Oscar for his Pulp Fiction (1994) screenplay – would write a genre-bending vampire tale and his friend, Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado) would come on board to direct the project. From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) was fueled by a real passion for horror and it showed. It would give the vampire film a facelift with a sharp 90s edge.\n\nDusk begins with our two leads, Ritchie and Seth Gekko (Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney) on the run for various crimes: bank-robbery, kidnapping, arson, rape and murder. Hiding in a Texas motel, the Gekko brothers run into preacher, Jacob Fuller and his teenage children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). At this point, the new plan becomes to evade the law by using this family and their RV to get across the border into Mexico. They all end up at a seedy roadhouse bar called the “Titty Twister”, where the occupants turn into vampires.\n\nI saw From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) about ten years ago and since then, I have been amazed at the movie’s rewatchability! Not only have I become a bigger fan of the horror genre, but – as a filmmaker and critic, myself – I was astonished at the production value! The DVD I own comes with a documentary called Full Tilt Boogie which shows the making of the film along with tons of behind-the-scenes footage! If you are interested in horror make-up and practical special effects this is the doc for you.\n\nSpeaking of make-up, one of the characters in the film, “Sex Machine,” is played by a horror special effects pioneer. Tom Savini did the zombie effects in the original Dawn of the Dead (1978) as well as many revered monster classics. Other actors have also been plucked from B-movies, like Fred Williamson , who appears as “Frost”. He was a star of retro blaxploitation films that Tarantino and Rodriguez certainly have in their personal film libraries – maybe even celluloid prints.\n\nAll in all, From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) is one half road movie and one half action gore-fest! See it if you’re not squeamish about explosive fluids and dismemberment. Moreover, if you can appreciate the work that goes into making a creature feature, the experience will be thoroughly entertaining. Dusk is essentially the 90s appetizer to the Tarantino and Rodriguez collaboration, Grindhouse in 2007."
