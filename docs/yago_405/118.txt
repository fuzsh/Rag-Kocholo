Story

Two brothers, Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and Ritchie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) are criminals on the run in Texas. They take one hostage, a bank teller named Gloria Hill (Brenda Hillhouse) and take off for the Mexican border. Before they get there, they stop at Benny's World of Liquor and hold two more women hostage before making their presence known to Pete, the clerk. Sheriff Earl McGraw (Michael Parks) arrives and tells Pete about The Gecko Brothers and how he's aiming to get them, dead or alive. While Sheriff McGraw takes a leak in the bathroom, Seth warns Pete about making any false moves. Ritchie gets highly paranoid and in a frenzy, he shoots Sheriff McGraw. This causes the situation to get really out of control and suddenly Seth and Ritchie find themselves in a minor standoff with Pete who is armed as well. Pete then shoots Ritchie in his hand. Seth tells Ritchie to shoot the bottles of liquor behind the front counter and Ritchie complies, spilling alcohol all over Pete. Seth then lights several toilet paper rolls on fire and tosses them over the counter setting Pete ablaze.

Seth and Ritchie exit the store as it goes up in flames behind them. They hop in their car and continue to make their way towards the Mexico.
