        "text": "We think that the Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona will hold on to their recent gains and appreciate further next year. Following significant volatility recently, a combination of fading domestic risks and favourable external developments will provide support for both currencies. Data surprises present the key risk.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nThe depreciations earlier this year reflected upside surprises to US activity and inflation, leading to repricing in rates markets which negatively affected the Nordic currencies. More recently, US data has come in softer, while the Nordic central banks struck a hawkish tone due to concerns about the impact on exchange rates. Synchronised policy easing should ease external pressures.\n\nSources of instability for the Norwegian krone are fading. A more stable European energy market is helping Norges Bank effectively sterilise krone-denominated petroleum revenues. A prolonged pause by Norges Bank that widens interest rate differentials will support the krone, but its high illiquidity and close ties to global energy prices means its recovery won’t be smooth.\n\nAlthough the Riksbank cut rates in early May before the European Central Bank or the Federal Reserve, the Swedish krona has rallied since. Domestically, headline inflation is close to the Riksbank’s target and the economy is weak, meaning high real rates now weigh on activity. But the Riksbank will proceed with policy easing at a cautious pace, as the policy rate remains its main tool to steer the exchange rate. We think an appreciating krona will bring the currency closer to its fair value over the medium term.\n\nTags:\n\nShare:\n\nBack to Resource Hub\n\nRelated topics\n\nNordics: Growth to pick up this year, but it will diverge\n\nThe Nordic economies will have a better 2024 than last year, but growth rates will diverge across the region. The main growth drivers will be improving domestic demand, higher confidence, and easing financial conditions amid lower inflation and policy easing. A pharma boom will make Denmark outperform, while a weak finish to 2023 will weigh on growth in Finland and Sweden.\n\nFind Out More\n\nNordics: Key themes 2024 – Light at the end of the tunnel\n\nThe rapid surge in interest rates will continue to weigh on the Nordic economies next year with little external support, but it's not all gloom with inflation easing and some pockets of strength. We think four themes will be key in charting the outlook for Nordic economies in 2024:\n\nFind Out More\n\nNordics: Climate policies will have an uneven impact across regions\n\nThe growing impact of climate change means that mitigation policy is becoming more prominent across the Nordic region. The transition policies that governments enact will have significant economic consequences, and their impact will be felt unevenly across regions. To help organisations understand the implications of different policies, we have developed a range of scenarios which plot potential pathways towards net zero.\n\nFind Out More\n\nNordics: Key themes 2023: A year of two halves\n\nFollowing a hard winter, we expect the Nordic economies to rebound from mid-2023 as falling inflation turns real incomes positive, alleviating uncertainty, boosting confidence, and allowing central banks to end policy tightening.\n\nFind Out More"
