        "text": "Imagine walking around royal palaces, getting lost in amazing scenery, relaxing on beaches, feeling tempted yet? It is the \"city of smiles\" that is calling you.\n\nDenmark is a small country consisting of 406 islands, of which only 70 are inhabited. This island country has a rich culture and several UNESCO heritage sites.\n\nBefore you visit the country, check about what currency is used in Denmark to plan your travel expenditures ahead. Keep reading, and you will get to know all about the official currency of Denmark.\n\nHistory of the Danish Krone\n\nAccording to historical sources, the currency system in Denmark was established in the 17th century. However, the oldest Danish coins, known as the korsmønter or \"cross coins\", were minted in the 10th century.\n\nIn 1619, the Danish crown minted this currency, and some suggested honouring this incident. It also got its name, \"Krone\", meaning \"crown\" in English. Throughout history, the medium of the DKK kept changing from silver standard to gold and finally to paper currency.\n\nDenmark decided to cease the printing of Krone, and the National bank printed the last note on 20th December 2016. At present, it outsources the work from Oberthur Fiduciaire SAS, a currency printing company that supplies notes to 70 different countries.\n\nNote denomination of the Danish Krone\n\nEarlier, the Danish Krone was minted on silver. But with time, the metal value of the minted coins reduced, which did not correspond to its minimal value. Eventually, the population lost their trust in the coins. This disruption resulted in reconsidering the Danish currency a couple of times, changing the medium of DKK from metal to paper currency at the end.\n\nThe Danish Krone is denoted as Kr. or DKK, subdivided into 100 øre. It is pegged to Euro via ERM II since 13th March 1979 at 1 EUR = 7.46038 DDK.\n\nIt is interesting to note that DKK became the national currency of Denmark in 1873 by replacing \"rigsdaler\". And today, the Danish Krone denominations in circulation include 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 kroner. And coins include half-a-krone, one, two, five, 10, and 20 kroner.\n\nWhat countries use the DKK?\n\nAlong with Denmark, Greenland and Faroe islands also use the Danish Krone as their official currency.\n\nNevertheless, the Faroe Islands use a localised and non-independent version of DKK, known as Faroese krona. Even Greenland launched an act to introduce different Greenlandic banknotes in 2006. However, in 2010 project was ceased. Therefore, Greenland uses the Danish kroner as its only national currency.\n\nWhere can you buy the Danish Krone?\n\nTraditionally you can buy DDK from any bank or bureau de change. But these sources come with many disadvantages, such as:\n\nThe exchange rates in a bank are fixed for the day. So even if the rates become more favourable, you will not get to exchange on it.\n\nThese institutions generally add various hidden margins on GBP to DKK exchange rate. Hence, you will not get the most out of your money.\n\nAnother drawback of banks or bureau de change is that you need to visit these institutions physically. This makes exchanging through them a bigger hassle and highly time-consuming.\n\nIf you have an online alternative to these, won't it be better in every way?\n\nHaving an online option to exchange currency is very beneficial because:\n\nIt doesn't require any physical visits, saving your time.\n\nThe processes are also not complicated, making them much quicker.\n\nHowever, it is essential to research online organisations before choosing one properly. It is advisable to look for cheaper and more transparent organisations.
