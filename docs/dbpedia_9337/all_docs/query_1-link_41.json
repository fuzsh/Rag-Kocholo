Based on the analysis presented here, we've decided to go with the solution proposed by Ludin.\n\nDKK Denmark\n\nSEK Sweden\n\nNOK Norway\n\nISK Iceland\n\nExamples\n\nOn job search\n\nOn job details pages\n\nOn job ads\n\nThe grammatically correct way would rather be 480k - 600k kr. The krona currency in all the nordic countries is always written after the digits, not before them as in US dollar $480k.\n\nAs a side note, in Sweden the term \"SEK\" is more common for professional use, meaning \"Swedish krona\". Just to avoid confusion with Danish and Norwegian currencies. If I would apply to a Danish job from Sweden, I wouldn't know if the site showed Swedish or Danish krona.\n\nThe best idea seems to be changing to:\n\nDKK Denmark\n\nSEK Sweden\n\nNOK Norway\n\nISK Iceland"
