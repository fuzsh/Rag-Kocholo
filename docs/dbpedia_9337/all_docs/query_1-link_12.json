        "text": "What Is the DKK (Danish Krone)?\n\nDKK is the currency code in the foreign exchange (forex) market for the Danish krone. The krone is the official currency of Denmark as well as the provinces of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The krone subdivides into 100 øre and is currently pegged to the euro. The local currency is denoted as \"kr\", as in kr100, meaning 100 kroner (plural).\n\nUnderstanding the DKK (Danish Krone)\n\nFirst introduced in 1619, the Danish krone was minted in honor of and by the Danish crown, as \"crown\" is the literal translation of krone. At this time, Denmark replaced the former Danish rigsdaler with the Danish krone as its official currency and tied the krone to the gold standard.\n\nAs modern international trade grew, the demand for a paper currency grew. Denmark created the second Danish krone as part of the dissolution of the country's participation in the Scandinavian Monetary Union with Sweden and Norway. The union dissolved in 1914, and the three participating countries chose to keep their currencies. The krone was pegged to the German Reichsmark mark briefly, then to the British pound, and later to the German Deutschmark.\n\nDKK is currently pegged to the euro at 7.46 DKK per EUR and is allowed to fluctuate in a small band of +/- 2.25% against it. Between 2009 and 2019 the EUR/DKK rate has largely stayed between 7.45 and 7.47, well within the 2.25% threshold it is allowed to move.\n\nBanknote denominations in circulation today include 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 kroner. Coins include half-a-krone, one, two, five, 10, and 20 kroner.\n\nDenmark and the Euro\n\nDenmark first applied to be a member of the European Union’s (EU) predecessor community, the European Economic Community, in 1961 but did not join until 1973. Despite the long-term participation of Denmark in the European Community, the Danish people have earned a reputation for being relatively skeptical of the now European Union as the result of failed referendums related to increased integration into the European community. In 2000, the population voted not to replace the krone with the euro.\n\nThe first failed referendum took place in 1992 when Danish voters rejected a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, one of the two treaties that form the constitutional basis for the European Union. After the failure of the 1992 referendum, amendments to the treaty satisfied some Danish concerns, and a second referendum ratified it in 1993.\n\nBut skepticism of the euro has lived on in Denmark, even after it joined the EU. On the 28th of September 2000, 53.2% Danish voters deciding again not to adopt the euro.\n\nThe Danish Krone in the International Economy\n\nThe Danish Krone is part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, aimed at reducing exchange rate volatility among EU nations. It pegs to the Euro at a ratio of 7.46 krone to one euro, and is required to stay within 2.25% of that level.\n\nDespite Danish attachment to their currency, independent analyses have argued that Denmark is a de facto user of the euro since the National Bank of Denmark tracks European Central Bank policy so closely. Former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has characterized this status as being a part of the eurozone without having a seat at the decision-making table.\n\nAccording to World Bank data, Denmark experienced a 0.7% annual inflation rate and had gross domestic product (GDP) growth of a 2.85% in 2019. Denmark exports more than it imports, with major exports including machinery, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nExample of DKK in Forex Markets\n\nIf the rate is 7.4725, that means it costs kr7.4725 to buy one euro. To find out how many euros it takes to buy one krone, divide one by the EUR/DKK rate. This provides the DKK/EUR rate, which is 0.1338. That means it costs €0.1338 to buy one krone. These rates are useful if exchanging currency.\n\nFor example, converting €1,000 to kroner will mean the person gets kr7,4725 (7.4725 x 1,000). When converting cash (digital or physical) banks or currency exchange houses will typically charge a fee for the conversion. These can range between 1% and 5%. Therefore, the actual amount of currency recieved could be reduced by 3%, for example."
