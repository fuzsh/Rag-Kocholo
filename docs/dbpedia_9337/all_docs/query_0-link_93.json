        "text": "Description\n\nThe Swedish krona (SEK) has been the currency of Sweden since 1873. It is issued by the Swedish central bank, Sveriges Riksbank. The symbol of the currency is kr. One krona is subdivided into 100 öre. In English, the currency is sometimes referred to as the Swedish crown (‘krona’ means ‘crown’ in Swedish).\n\nCoins currently in circulation are 1 krona, and 5 and 10 kronor. Banknotes are in denominations of 20, 50, 100, and 500 kronor.\n\nEconomy\n\nSweden has achieved an enviable standard of living, due to high-tech capitalism, extensive social benefits, a modern distribution system, and a highly skilled labor force.\n\nThe economy is heavily oriented to foreign trade, utilizing a resource base of timber, hydro power, and iron ore.\n\nThe global economic crisis of 2008 reduced export demand and consumption, causing the Swedish economy to slide into recession despite its strong finances and underlying fundamentals. Strong commodity exports contributed to a strong rebound in 2010-2011.\n\nHistory"
