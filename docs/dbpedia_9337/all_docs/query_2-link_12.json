        "text": "Short answer: Before being sold to the United States in 1917, the Danish West indies used a dual monetary system of 100 cents equal to 1 daler, and also 100 bits equal to 1 franc, with 5 francs to the daler.\n\nBelow: 1815 Map of Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and the Danish West Indies (leftmost 3 green islands) Image is out of copyright. Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe West Indies were colonized by Denmark starting in the late 1600s. The three largest islands are St. Thomas (annexed 1672), St. Jan/John (annexed 1718) and St. Croix (purchased from French West India Company 1733). Like many small possessions without significant metal mining, they did not have their own coinage at first. A mix of coinage from nearby colonies and European money probably circulated. The first Danish coins marked specifically for use in the West Indies were the copper 1 and 2 skillings, under King Christian VI. Like many Scandinavian coins, they have an elaborate monogram of the king on the obverse.\n\nThe monetary system was 96 skillings to the rigsdaler, based on a comparable system in use in Denmark at the time. (Why 96 skillings? 12 penning = 1 skilling, 16 skillings = 1 mark, and 6 marks = 1 rigsdaler. So 16 x 6 = 96 skilling to the rigsdaler.) By the time the Danish West Indies had its own money, the penning was too small a denomination to be in use, so the skilling was the smallest monetary unit. Denmark’s money was actually even more complicated that that. In the 1700s, Denmark had two separate daler currenceies. One was based on paper money which became devalued, and a separate silver daler was known as the rigsdaler specie. (Here’s Wikipedia on the Danish rigsdaler history.) Anyway, in the 1700s Danish West Indies, only a few denominations were actually minted for local use: 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 skillings. These were only minted occasionally and in relatively small quantities. To make thinks even more confusing, the Danish West Indies skilling and rigsdaler were not equal to the Danish homeland ones, being worth 20% less.\n\nIn 1849, the West Indies rigsdaler was replaced by the daler. A strange variety of countermarked coinage was produced from 1849-1859, including on some US copper and silver coinage. In 1859, the daler was decimalized, with 100 cents equal to 1 daler. Denmark itself only decimalized in 1873-5, as part of joining the Scandinavian Monetary Union and placing the currency on a gold standard. In Denmark proper, the new decimal system had 100 øre = 1 krone. Meanwhile, the Danish West Indies kept the daler unit.\n\nIn 1905, the Danish West Indies introduced a separate, parallel decimal system worth one fifth of the daler/cent. 100 bits equalled 1 franc, with 5 bits to the cent and 5 francs to the daler. Coinage was minted with both denominations listed, as shown below.\n\nImages: 5 and 10 bits, Danish West Indies, both 1905\n\nWhy would a Danish colony name one of its currency units after the French franc? I don’t know for certain, but the French colonies in the Caribbean such as Haiti (before its independence in 1804) and Martinique were some of the most economically significant in the region, with profitable sugar and coffee plantations. After decimalization, the franc seems to have been used informally as a denomination, equal to 20 cents, even though no coins labeled as francs were issued at first. With the 1905 monetary reform, a gold 4 daler/20 franc coin was issued, with the exact same weight (6.4156) and fineness (0.900) as the French gold 20 franc coins of 1802-1914.\n\nThe Danish West Indies were a money-losing colony, and Denmark had been looking to sell them for a number of years by the early 20th century. World War I provided the impetus, and in 1917 the islands were sold to the United States, and renamed as the US Virgin Islands. The Danish West Indies were strategically important, and the US bought them in part to keep them out of German hands. No need for a potential hostile U-boat base in the New World which could target shipping from the Panama Canal. Denmark was neutral in World War I, but the wartime disruption of trade and the difficulty of defending its overseas possessions probably gave additional reasons for the sale.\n\nAs a US colony, the Virgin Islands kept the daler denomination for 17 years. In 1934 they switched from the daler to the dollar, at a rate of 1 US dollar = 1.0363 daler.\n\nRegarding the symbolism on the reverses of the 5 and 10 bit coins shown above, I haven’t found a specific reference. They don’t appear to be from the Danish coat of arms, so I imagine they are specific to the Danish West Indies. There are 3 crossed symbols: a trident, a sickle and a caduceus staff. I interpret these to represent the basis of the economy: fishing (trident), agriculture (sickle) and trade (caduceus, the symbol of Hermes, patron god of commerce, and of confused health insurance companies)."
