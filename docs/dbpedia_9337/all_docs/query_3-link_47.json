        "text": "Until 31 May 2025, there will be no changes to the banknotes of the Danish currency, so the current (summer) season is not affected by the cash revision. However, the majority of pleasure boaters who are also travelling in Denmark are likely to have Danish kroner in their on-board cash box.\n\nWhich banknotes will become invalid in 2025?\n\nAll banknotes older than the current 2009 series will no longer have any value after 31 May 2025. Bridges and antiques are depicted on these notes. Although the use of cash is much less popular in Denmark than in Germany, for example, the Danish National Bank still states on its website that there will always be a need for cash in Danish kroner in Denmark. There are therefore no plans to abolish the non-digital payment method - at least for the time being.\n\nThis is not the case with the current 1000 Danish kroner banknote, which is actually being abolished for good. However, this is primarily due to the fight against financial crime. According to the Danish police, the highest-value banknote is used much more frequently by criminals than the other notes. In addition, according to the Danish National Bank, many transactions involving smaller amounts are carried out with cash. Accordingly, a banknote over 1000 Danish kroner is not so important for the population.\n\nDanish kroner according to the will of the people\n\nAccording to the Danish National Bank, there will be new banknotes from 2028. For three weeks from 13 May, the citizens of Denmark had the opportunity to express their opinion on the motives behind the new banknotes in an online survey. The results and responses of the almost 75,000 people who took part in the survey are now being analysed.\n\nWhy are there new banknotes?\n\nThe Danish National Bank has now been commissioned to develop the new banknote series. According to the bank, the new series is necessary in order to remain \"at the cutting edge of technology\". This applies to the format of the banknotes as well as the technical aspects of preventing money laundering. In addition, many banknotes from the pre-2009 series of Danish kroner are no longer accepted in some shops anyway. The Danish National Bank explained that it is not expedient to have valid banknotes in circulation that cannot be used in the same way everywhere. The new regulation is intended to make paying with cash in Denmark easier for everyone.\n\nThe Danish Crown\n\nThe Danish krone is the official currency of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Introduced in 1875 to replace the Danish Rigsdaler, it consists of coins and banknotes issued by the Danish National Bank. Although Denmark is a member of the EU, the euro was rejected as a currency following a referendum. Danish kroner therefore remains in use. One euro is equivalent to around 7.4 Danish kroner, depending on the daily exchange rate."
