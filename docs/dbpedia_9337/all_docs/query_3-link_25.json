        "text": "A rix-dollar, or rigsdaler, references the currency used at the time.\n\nIn 1819, when Andersen arrived without a single rigsdaler in Copenhagen (having left his widowed mother behind in Odense), he \"was quite calm because [he] trusted blindly in Our Lord.\" Yet that faith, however genuine, was perhaps a less reliable buoy than his observation about \"the heroes in all the tales,\" that \"things always went well in the comedies and stories.\"\n\nThe currencies of the three countries in fact already circulated at a simplified fixed exchange rate of 1 Norwegian speciedaler = 2 Danish rigsdaler = 4 Swedish rigsdaler, since the public generally ignored differences of less than 1 per cent (Garelli, 1946).\n\nHe is given a rigsdaler, a paper bill worth about a German mark, by the local parson for writing a letter for him, and he copies it by hand for practice in drawing the ornate lettering."
