        "text": "The Vikings of Iceland bartered once the normal confines of life were settled in their new land. For a time they were an independent colony with what I believe little interference from the monarchy until the Kalmar Union was established in (1397–1523), giving Eric of Pomerania sovereignty over Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. There were circulated coins of past rulers making their way throughout Scandinavia and I have no doubt that with trade and mobility some of those coins made it to the shores of Iceland because although they were a bartering society who would turn away coin? If you think about it you could find so many uses for coins even if you couldn’t trade them for goods.\n\nA common currency in use during that period was the Scandinavian Penning. The “penning,” was minted in various denominations, and its usage extended beyond Denmark to other parts of Scandinavia and Europe as well as in some of the neighboring territories. It was a silver coin which was subdivided into smaller units called “ørtugar” or “øre” (plural: “ører”). It was a relatively small and thin coin, often round in shape, with varying weights and fineness depending on the specific region and period.\n\nOver time, the penning was gradually replaced by larger silver coins, such as the mark and the rigsdaler, which became more prevalent in the later medieval period. The Rigsdaler was a large silver coin that had significant influence in the economies of the Danish-Norwegian union and later the Kalmar Union. It was subdivided into smaller units such as the “skilling” or “øre,” which were also minted in silver. I must also mention that the currency systems and specific coins used during this period can be complex and varied but feel free to check out the links I have included for additional information about the Riksdaler and penning. They’re both beautiful representations of Scandinavia’s history.\n\nhttps://adventures.is/blog/iceland-currency/\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Iceland/History"
