Greenland (Kalaallisut: Kalaallit Nunaat) is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark, located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and later Denmark) for more than a millennium. In 2008, the people of Greenland supported a referendum on greater autonomy by 75%. Greenland by area is the world's largest island, consisting almost entirely of an ice-shelf, miles thick in some places. Capital and largest city:Nuuk (formerly Godthåb).

The European settlement there was gradually cut off from contact owing to increasingly dangerous seas; additionally, the communities came under attack from nomadic Inuit, travelling southward off the polar sea. 1410 was the last year that any record survives of contact with the colony. In 1500, King Manuel I of Portugal sent Gaspar Corte-Real to Greenland in search of a Northwest Passage to Asia which, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, was part of the Portuguese area of influence. In 1501, Corte-Real returned with his brother, Miguel Corte-Real. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in Labrador and Newfoundland. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to the Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The Cantino planisphere, made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland. When the weather moderated again, and Europeans once more discovered the place (in the 16th century), the only humans present were scattered bands of Inuit. King Christian IV's Expeditions to Greenland was a series of expeditions in the years 16051607 to Greenland and Arctic waterways in order to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions.\n\nDenmark.....................................03 Jul 1721 - date with...\n\nOrganized into two separate colonies, North Greenland and South Greenland, 1782-1950. In 1910 a third region, Thule, or Northwest Greenland was established as a semi-autonomous district - it became a fully dependent colony in 1931 (effective from 1933), but was absorbed into North Greenland in 1937.\n\nNorway......................................12 Jul 1932 - 05 Apr 1933 and with..\n\nIn 1921 a fourth region, East Greenland emerged - it was briefly occupied by Norway 1932-1933.

The Danish Krone (plural: kroner; Sign: kr.; Code: DKK) has been the official currency of Denmark, Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, since 01 January 1875. During 1863 to 1932 the following companies produced token coinage in Greenland:\n\nTOKEN ISSUES as ØST GRØNLAND by A. GIBBS & SONS (British trading and mining company located in eastern Greenland). Denomination of Skilling, 6 Skilling, 12 Skilling and 1 Daler, all in Brass were produced dated 1863.\n\nØRESUND (Danish company for mining cryolite located in Ivigtut, southwest Greenland). Denomination of Skilling, 4 Skilling, 16 Skilling, 48 Skilling and 1 Rigsdaler, all in zinc were produced undated (1859-1865).\n\nIVIGTUT CRYOLITE MINING & TRADING CO. The Cryolite Mining and Trading Company at Ivigtut at the southwest coast of Greenland issued its own tokens since 1873. The uncommon mineral Cryolite (Na3AIF6, Sodium Aluminum Fluoride) was used in the aluminum industry. In large quantities it was only found on the west coast of Greenland.\n\nSeries I, 1875-1882: Ore, 5 Ore, 10 Ore, 70 Ore, 85 Ore and 100 Ore, all in Zinc undated.\n\nSeries II, pre 1882: Ore, 5 Ore (two types), 10 Ore, 50 Ore, 85 Ore and 100 Ore, all in Zinc undated.\n\nSeries III, 1892: Ore, 5 Ore, 10 Ore, 50 Ore, 100 Ore (two types), 500 Ore, 1000 Ore and 20 Kroner, all in Zinc undated.\n\nSeries IV, 1922: 10 Ore, 50 Ore, 2 Kroner and 10 Kroner (two types) in Copper-Nickel dated 1922.\n\nROYAL GREENLAND TRADE (COMPANY) - (Den Kongelige Grønlandske Handel). Located on Angmagssalik Island off the east coast of Greenland just below the Arctic Circle. Denomination of Ore, 5 Ore, 10 Ore, 25 Ore, 50 Ore (two types), 100 Ore (two types) and 500 Ore (two types) produced, all in Zinc undated (probably 1890-1900). Another 500 Ore Aluminum coin was issued undated in 1905.\n\nGREENLAND MINING LTD at Josva (Innatsiaq). A place in southwest Greenland, where the Grønlandsk Minedrifts Aktieselskab ran a copper mine from 1907-1914 yielding little more than 60 tons of copper. As a minor bonus, it got over 50 kg of silver and half a kg of gold. Denomination of 10 Ore, 25 Ore and 100 Ore, all in Nickel plated Zinc were produced in 1911.\n\nTHULE-KAP YORK. Trading station founded by Knud Rasmussen in 1910. The money circulated from 1914 to 1937, but they bear the date of the founding year. They were produced by L. Chr. Lauer, Nürnberg, Germany in 1913. 5 Kroner (two types) dated 1932 were struck at H. Th. Neergaard Gravør-og Stempelfabrik, engraving and stamp factory. Denomination of 5 Ore (with and without hole in center), 25 Ore, 100 Ore and 500 Ore dated 1910. 5 Kroner (two types) dated 1932. All coin were produced in Aluminum.\n\nIn 1926, cupronickel 25 øre (with and without hole in center), aluminum-bronze 50 øre and aluminum-bronze 1 Krone were issued. The coins were the same size and composition as the corresponding Danish coins. However, the 25 øre was not holed, although some were withdrawn from circulation, holed and then reissued. In 1944, brass 5 kroner coins were produced by the Philadelphia Mint in the United States. Coins produced in 1926 and 1944 are known as Danish Colony coins. A second issue of aluminum-bronze 1 Krone was made in 1957 by Royal Greenland Trade Company, followed by cupronickel versions in 1960 and 1964. The later issues are known as Danish State coins. The last Greenlandic coins were withdrawn on July 01, 1967, and since then, Danish coins have been used. GREENLAND MINING LTD at Josva (Innatsiaq) THULE-KAP YORK DANISH CROWN COLONY (1924-1953) DANISH PROVINCE (1953-1979) Greenland Rigsdaler Banknotes: The rigsdaler was the currency of Greenland until 1874. It was equal to the Danish rigsdaler which circulated in Greenland alongside distinct banknotes from 1803. Before 1813, the rigsdaler courant was subdivided into 96 skilling. In 1813, the rigsdaler courant was replaced by the rigsbanksdaler at a rate of 6 rigsdaler courant = 1 rigsbanksdaler, with the rigsbanksdaler subdivided into 96 rigsbank skilling. In 1854, the names were changed to the rigsdaler and skilling rigsmønt. In 1874, the kroner was introduced, at a rate of 2 kroner = 1 rigsdaler. Grønlandske Handel introduced notes in denominations of 12 and 24 skilling, ½ and 1 rigsdaler courant. The next year, the Handelsstederne i Grønland took over the issuance of paper money and introduced notes for 6 and 12 skilling, ¼, ½, 1 and 5 rigsdaler courant. In 1819, following the currency reform, notes were introduced in denominations of 6, 12 and 24 skilling and 1 rigsbankdaler. These were replaced in 1856 by notes for the same amounts but in the new denominations of skilling rigsmønt and rigsdaler. Greenland Krone Banknotes: In 1874, Handelsstederne i Grønland issued 50 øre and 1 krone notes, followed by 25 øre notes the next year. In 1887, 5 kroner notes were introduced. The Handelsstederne continued to issue notes until 1905. In 1911, the Kongelige Grønlandske Handel began issuing paper money, with notes in denominations of 25 and 50 øre, 1 and 5 kroner. In 1913, colonial notes (marked Styrelse af Kolonierne i Grønland) were introduced in denominations of 25 and 50 øre, 1 and 5 kroner. From 1926, colonial notes were marked Grønlands Styrelse, the denominations below 5 kroner ceased production and 10 and 50 kroner notes were introduced. In 1953, the Kongelige Grønlandske Handel resumed note production with 5, 10 and 50 kroner notes, whilst credit notes (Kreditsedler) for 100 kroner were also issued. These notes were produced until 1967. Greenland adopted the Act on Banknotes in Greenland in 2006 with a view to introducing separate Greenlandic banknotes. The Act entered into force on 1 June 2007. In the autumn of 2010, a new Greenlandic government indicated that it did not wish to introduce separate Greenlandic bank­notes and Danmarks Nationalbank ceased the project to develop a Greenlandic series. Still, Greenland continues to use Danish kroner as sole official currency. Historically, Greenland under the colonial administration issued distinct banknotes between 1803 and 1968, together with coins between 1926 and 1964. Countries / Territories"
