Referred to as the ‘danish crown’ in England.\n\nPronunciation of the monetary “ore” (scroll to second definition): a bronze coin of Norway, the 100th part of a krone.\n\nIn 2019:\n\n8.56 Kroner (NOK)= $1 USD\n\n5,000 NOK= $584.15\n\n4,800 NOK = $560.78\n\nIn 1880\n\n$560.78 (1880 USD) = $13,812.40 (2019 USD)\n\n$13,812.40 (2019 USD) = 4,800 (1880 NOK)\n\n1,000 kroner (1880) = $2,877.60 (2019 USD)\n\nInflation of $13,251.62 over 139 years.\n\nOther payments/metals\n\nCupronickel any of various alloys of copper containing up to 40 percent nickel.\n\nSkilling is the Norwegian equivalent to a shilling in England.\n\n48 skillings= 1 rigsdaler= 2 kroner\n\nbanknotes: term for money, cash, dollar\n\nHistory of the Norwegian Money\n\nBy 1813 the Danish State was bankrupt and a new monetry system was establised introducing the riksbankdaler. One riksbankdaler equaled 6 marks equals 96 skilling. Or the riksbankdaler was equal to a half riksdaler.\n\nAfter Norway was separated from Denmark in 1814, the old skillemynt was used up to 1816 when the specidaler replaced the riksbankdaler. The Specidaler was given the value of 5 riksbanksdaler in silver, or 1 specidaler equals 5 ort (mark) equals 120 skilling. The new speciadaler had the same silver content as the old riksdaler specie.\n\nThe Danish coins, the riksbankdaler equaled to 96 skilling, were used in Denmark to 1873 and circulated in Norway in part of this period.\n\nIn 1875, coins were introduced in denominations of 10 and 50 øre and 1 and 10 kroner. These coins also bore the denomination in the previous currency, as 3, 15, and 30 skillings and 2½ specidaler. Between 1875 and 1878, the new coinage was introduced in full, in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 øre and 1, 2, and 10 kroner. The 1, 2, and 5 øre were struck in bronze; the 10, 25, and 50 øre and 1 and 2 kroner, in silver; and the 10 and 20 kroner, in gold. The last gold coins were issued in 1910; silver was replaced by cupro-nickel from 1920."
