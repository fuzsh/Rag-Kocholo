Although they sound almost the same, note that Iceland's currency differs from the countries mentioned above.\n\nAside from being called the Icelandic krona, the currency of Iceland is not pinned to another currency. For example, the Danish krone used by Greenland and Denmark is tied to the Euro. As a result, Iceland's currency is better controlled by its nation.\n\nHistory of the Currency of Iceland\n\nIceland was a territory of Denmark from the 14th century to the 19th century.

As a result, the Icelandic government started issuing the Icelandic krona, making it its official currency.\n\nYou can learn more about Denmark and Iceland's story through this complete history of Iceland.\n\nIcelandic Currency Through the Ages\n\nIceland has been issuing banknotes since 1885. Its first banknotes are the 5, 10, and 50 kronur. However, it was only in the 1920s that Iceland started issuing coins, beginning with the 10 and 25 aurar (now obsolete).\n\nIn 1925 and 1926, five more coin denominations were added. These denominations are:\n\n- 1 krona\n\n- 2 krona\n\n- 1 eyrir\n\n- 2 aurar\n\n- 5 aurar\n\nPhoto from Wikimedia, Creative Commons, by Arvedui89. No edits made.\n\nAfter the Second World War, in 1946, the Icelandic currency's coins were redesigned to remove the royal monogram of Denmark.\n\nIn 1981, Iceland revalued its currency and added new coins in 5, 10, and 50 aurar denominations. However, in 2003, all coins denominated in the aurar were taken out of circulation.\n\nIceland's Currency Crisis in 2008\n\nIceland is now one of the best places to live in the world.
