The first Danish coin dates from the year 995, but worldwide the history of coins goes back even further. Ever since coins first started being used in Denmark, they have been an important means of payment.",

        "text": "The first official Danish coin dates from the year 995, and is called the Svend Tveskæg (Sweyn Forkbeard) coin. Svend Tveskæg was the first ruler to have his name on a Danish coin. No more than 20,000 of the coins were minted. The Svend Tveskæg coin is deemed to be the first official Danish coin because it was the first Danish coin to bear the name of the king and the country. However, archaeological finds have shown that there were coins in Denmark long before Svend Tveskæg.\n\nEver since Danish coins were first minted, a clear reference to the monarchy has traditionally been included on the coins. This might take the form of a portrait of the King or Queen or the royal monogram. In the old days, the King was responsible for issuing coins. By making him a prominent figure on the coin, he was made the guarantor that the coin contained the right amount of metal and thus had the right value."
