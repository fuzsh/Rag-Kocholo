        "text": "Currency and Credit Cards\n\nName of Norwegian Currency is the ´Norwegian Krone (NOK), represented either as NOK (preceding the number), Nrk (preceding the number) or simply KR (following the amount).\n\nOne Norwegian Krone is equal to 100 øre. Coins come in denominations of 50 øre, NOK 1, NOK 5, NOK 10 and NOK 20, and notes come in denomination of NOK 50, NOK 100, NOK 200, NOK 500 and NOK 1000.\n\nNorway is using less and less cash. That means that it's not a crisis if you forgot to bring cash, because it is possible to buy almost anything with a credit card.\n\nVisa and MasterCard are the most commonly accepted credit cards, with far fewer accepting Amex or Diners. Some supermarkets do not accept foreign credit cards, although\n\nTip in Norway\n\nIn Norway for the most part tipping is not common. In restaurants and bars can be exceptions where you can tip if you are happy with the service and the food. It is up to you how much to tip, but normally you give 5-15 % of the total amount of the bill.\n\nBanks in Norway"
