        "text": "Starting today, the Nordic countries are coming closer together when 11,6 million Vipps and MobilePay users in Denmark, Finland and Norway can easily send money to each other, only using a phone number. Sweden will follow in the autumn, when Vipps is introduced in the Swedish marked.\n\nEven though we are close neighbors in the Nordics, sending money to each other has been a hassle. From today, it is much easier as users of Vipps in Norway and MobilePay in Denmark and Finland, can send money to each other simply by using their phone numbers.\n\nGoodbye, IBAN!\n\n“Our users have for a long time asked us to simplify sending money across the Nordics. Now, we have the solution ready. That means goodbye to long IBAN numbers and tedious button-pushing. This is the first of many steps we are taking to bring the Nordics even closer together,” says Rune Garborg, CEO of Vipps MobilePay.\n\nA transfer will cost 4 percent of the transaction’s amount. The fee will be clearly stated in the app when the user sends money. In addition, the user’s bank will have an exchange fee. It costs nothing to receive the money. It will still be free of charge to send money to your friends and family within each country and in the same currency.\n\n“Our aim is to offer the simplest solution. Sending money will now be very, very easy whether you’re sharing a meal with Nordic friends or sending a money gift to your Nordic relative.” says Garborg.\n\nWhile the service initially is about sending money between person to person, it will soon also be possible to pay to the 325 000 merchants and organisations that use Vipps MobilePay in the three countries.\n\nHello, Sweden!\n\nIn the fall of 2024, Swedes will be able to download the Vipps app and easily send money to their neighbouring countries. This will work in the same simple way where you only need a phone number.\n\n“Sweden is the biggest Nordic country. And of course, Swedes should be able to be a part of this feature. We are therefore very eager to launch the Vipps App in the Swedish marked,” says Garborg."
