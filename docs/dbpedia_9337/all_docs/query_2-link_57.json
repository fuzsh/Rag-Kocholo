        "text": "For some time, we have been hearing that the Reserve Bank of India will replace paper currency with polymer notes.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the possible introduction of polymer notes, RBI has said that these notes would have an average life span of five years compared to one year for paper currency notes.\n\nSoiled notes, therefore, would become history, once polymer notes are in vogue.\n\nAnd even though the initial cost of printing polymer notes is high, in the long run it works out cheaper.\n\n. . .\n\nIn pre-modern China, the need for credit and for circulating a medium that was less of a burden than exchanging thousands of copper coins led to the introduction of paper money, commonly known today as banknotes.\n\nThis economic phenomenon was a slow and gradual process that took place from the late Tang Dynasty (618-907) into the Song Dynasty (960-1279).\n\nIn Europe, paper money was first introduced on a regular basis in Sweden in 1661.\n\nIn this slide show, we present a brief history of the currency of India as well as 10 most beautiful currencies of the world.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that the choice of beautiful currencies is purely subjective.\n\n. . .\n\nIndia has been one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world.\n\nFew countries rival India for the sheer diversity of its coinage be it minting techniques, motifs, sizes, shapes, the metals used or for that matter the monetary history arising from the Monetary Standards India has experienced (tri-metallism, bi-metallism, the silver standard, the gold exchange standard as well as fiat money).\n\nIn history, Indian coins have played a crucial role in documenting political and economic changes over time.\n\n. . .\n\nWide use of bank notes, however, came with the note issues of the semi-government Presidency Banks, notably the Bank of Bengal which was established in 1806 as the Bank of Calcutta with a capital of 50 lakh sicca rupees.\n\nThese banks were established by government charters and had an intimate relationship with the government.\n\nThe charter granted to these banks accorded them the privilege of issuing notes for circulation within their circles.\n\nNotes issued by the Bank of Bengal can broadly be categorised in three broad series viz: the 'unifaced' series, the 'commerce' series and the 'Britannia' series.\n\nThe early notes of the Bank of Bengal were unifaced and were issued as one gold mohur (sixteen sicca rupees in Calcutta) and in denominations deemed convenient in the early 19th Century, viz., Rs. 100, Rs. 250, Rs. 500, etc.\n\nClick NEXT to read about the 10 most beautiful currencies. . .\n\n1. The French Pacific Territories (Franc)\n\nThe CFP franc (called the franc in everyday use) is the currency used in the French overseas collectivities of French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna.\n\nThe Franc was created in December 1945, together with the CFA franc, used in Africa.\n\nThe reason for the creation of these francs was the weakness of the French franc immediately after the Second World War.\n\n. . .\n\n10. Faroe Islands (Kronurs)\n\nThe krona is the currency of the Faroe Islands.\n\nIt is issued by the Danish National Bank. It is not an independent currency but a version of the Danish krone.\n\nTherefore, it does not have an ISO 4217 currency code."
