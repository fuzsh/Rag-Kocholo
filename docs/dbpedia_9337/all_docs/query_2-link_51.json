        "text": "Nowadays, agriculture is not just about being good at growing crops or raising livestock. The modern farmer also has to be a skilled manager and have their finger on the pulse while constantly being ready to adjust to new needs and requirements, such as the transition to greener and more sustainable production.\n\nHowever, when the Ewers brothers’ great-great-grandfather started his business, just accessing capital to produce for others than yourself was a challenge. Back in 1871, the banks were not for farmers.\n\nWhen the bank moved out of town\n\nBy 1871, Frederik III’s ramparts had separated Copenhagen from the rest of the country for nearly 200 years. Life outside the capital contrasted starkly with the opportunities the city dwellers had – also when it came to your financial options.\n\nDenmark had 18 banks. Only two were large banks, and both were located in Copenhagen. The 16 small banks did not have sufficient funds to be able to adequately support agriculture – and the two large banks could not see any potential in having farmers as customers. If a farmer wished to borrow money, then a citizen of Copenhagen’s name had to appear on the loan agreement, so farmers had to pay an additional fee to get a Copenhagen signature on the loan document.\n\nHowever, that attitude to farmers was something a circle of the leading wholesalers and manufacturers of the day held no truck with.\n\nTherefore, on 5 October 1871, they founded a new bank that aimed to provide farmers with better opportunities to finance production. The bank was established with an equity of 2.4 million ‘rigsdaler’ (about DKK 5 million at the time), which was more than the 16 provincial banks combined. The bank was called Den Danske Landmandsbank, Hypothek and Vexelbank in Copenhagen – but was popularly known as just Landmandsbanken.\n\nMore than 100 years later, the bank changed name in 1976 to Den Danske Bank, which better reflected the bank’s nationwide presence and that it had customers from all sections of Danish society.\n\nRight from the start, the new bank stood out from the competition.\n\nLandmandsbanken’s customers could have an overdraft, and in its very first year the bank opened four branches and four offices around the country outside Copenhagen’s ramparts. Thus it became the first Copenhagen bank to move out of the city and afford the rest of Denmark direct access to the Copenhagen capital market.\n\nBritish appetites spur cooperatives\n\nThe farmers’ access to the city’s capital markets coincided with a sharp decline in international grain prices. This forced the Danish farmers to restructure their exports, with the UK rousing particular interest as a potential export market. Free trade and the UK’s huge appetite for butter, bacon and eggs made the market attractive for Danish farmers, who could supply dairy and meat products of high quality at a good price.\n\nThe UK’s growing appetite and demand fuelled Danish agricultural production, and suddenly there was a need for capital to make operations more efficient. The solution was the invention of a distinctive and characteristic constellation in Danish business: Cooperative societies.\n\nIn 1882, a number of dairy farmers joined forces for purchasing, machinery sharing, livestock breeding and much more. The trend quickly took off. Just 18 years later, there were more than 1,000 dairy cooperatives across the country."
