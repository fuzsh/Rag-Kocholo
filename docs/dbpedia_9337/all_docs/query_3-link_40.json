        "text": "The purpose of this study is to analyse which kinds of monetary taxation and coinage policies the minting authorities applied in Sweden in the period 1153-1512. In medieval Europe, old coins were frequently declared invalid and were exchanged for new ones at xed rates and dates. Here, the question of whether and when such periodic recoinage was applied in medieval Sweden is analyzed against the historical record. A theory of how short-lived and long-lived coinage systems work is applied to Swedish coinage. Sweden adopted similar coin forms as those minted in Continental Europe in the Middle Ages, but also adopted the corresponding continental coinage and monetary taxation policies linked to these coin forms. Swedish experience is extraordinarily well in line with what one would expect from the theory of short-lived coins. Economic backwardness, limited mone-tization of society and separate currency areas facilitated recoinage. Recoinage with varying frequency was applied in 1180-1290 when only bracteates were minted. This is evidenced by many different coin types per reign, coin hoards which are dominated by a few types and dating of types to speci c periods of the kings' reigns. However, monetization increased in the late thirteenth century, making recoinage more dif cult. and bracteates were replaced by long-lived two-faced coins in 1290. With an end to recoinage, the Swedish kings then accelerated the debasement of the long-lived coins. The disappearing recoinage fees were compensated for by debasing the silver content. Such debasements-interrupted by several coinage reforms-were applied until the beginning of the sixteenth century.\n\nEmpirical research points in one direction - that central banks used sterilization; i.e. that they ran a monetary policy that was meant to counteract the effects of the international capital flows. But on the other hand, we know that admitting long-term imbalances by sterilizing effects of international capital flows should make it impossible to maintain the fixed exchange rate.The question, therefore, is how the central banks managed to solve the ever-present dilemma of how to conduct monetary policy in such a manner that the supply of base money was balanced so as not to impede economic activity with the quest for a stable value of the currency. Balancing these elements is even more difficult, as we know that it is impossible to insulate the economy from international influences. Also, changes in economic trends may take place abruptly and be of considerable magnitude. Although this book concerns the management of the gold standard as a monetary regime, I have chosen to study both the gold and the silver standards with regard to Sweden."
