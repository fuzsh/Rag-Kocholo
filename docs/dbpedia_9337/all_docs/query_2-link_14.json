        "text": "Countries that accept Danish krone\n\nIf youâre travelling anywhere in the Kingdom of Denmark, you can use the Danish krone (DKK).\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark is made up of three countries:\n\nDenmark\n\nGreenland\n\nthe Faroe Islands\n\nThe Danish krone is the official currency of both Denmark and Greenland. Itâs accepted as legal tender in the Faroe Islands too, alongside the official Faroese krÃ³na.\n\nSweden and Norway also use the krone (or krona) as their currency unit, and you may be able to use the Danish krone in some of their ports. But beyond these areas, youâll need to pay in the official currency.\n\nIf youâre visiting more than one Scandinavian country, make sure you have the correct krone for each.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nCan I use my bank card in Denmark?\n\nDenmark is well-equipped for tourists, and you can pay by card all over the country. Some merchants will even let you pay in British pounds, but this can mean higher fees if the exchange rate isnât favourable.\n\nItâs a good idea to have some Danish krone on hand for smaller payments or tipping purposes. Get your travel money before you get to Denmark as most ATMs charge withdrawal fees.\n\nWhat are the typical prices in Denmark?\n\nDenmark can be quite pricey, especially if youâre visiting a major city like Copenhagen or Aarhus.\n\nIf youâre visiting Copenhagen, you can expect to pay:\n\nDKK140 for a basic meal\n\nDKK20 for a bottle of water\n\nDKK43 for a regular cappuccino\n\nDKK24 for a one-way ticket with local transport\n\nIf youâre on a budget, smaller towns will generally be more affordable. For example, the DKK140 meal in Copenhagen will cost you:\n\nDKK113 in FÃ¥borg\n\nDKK85 in Esbjerg\n\nDKK75 in Glostrup\n\nYou can convert your GBP to DKK with our currency converter.\n\nCan you use other currencies in Denmark?\n\nGenerally speaking, Denmark only accepts the Danish krone.\n\nWhile you can pay with Danish krone in the Faroe Islands, very few Danish shops will accept Faroese krÃ³na. Finding an exchange rate for the Faroese krÃ³na can be tricky, but you can pop into the National Bank of Denmark and exchange your notes for free.\n\nSome Danish ports might be willing to accept the Swedish krona (SEK) or Norwegian krone (NOK), but itâs better to stick to Danish kroner to avoid any issues with exchange rates.\n\nOther major currencies, like British pounds (GBP), wonât be accepted in Denmark.\n\nHow difficult is it to get a visa for Denmark?\n\nIf youâre a UK citizen, in most cases, you wonât need a visa to visit Denmark.\n\nNo matter if youâre there for a relaxing getaway or a business trip, you can stay in Denmark for up to 90 days without a visa. This also applies if youâre transiting through Denmark to get to Greenland, the Faroe Islands, or somewhere completely different.\n\nIf you want to stay in Denmark a little longer, youâll need to apply for an appropriate visa or work permit.\n\nYou should always research the most up to date visa guidelines before planning a trip.\n\nOther passport holders should check the entry requirements with your countryâs embassy.\n\nShould you tip in Denmark?\n\nTipping isnât very common in Denmark, but itâs appreciated all the same.\n\nDenmark includes service charges in the bill, so you donât have to worry about any extra tipping. If you still want to show your gratitude to your server, you can give them a small cash tip (about 5 to 10 kroner) as a thank you. Your server will definitely appreciate it!\n\nWhat languages are spoken in Denmark?\n\nDenmark has two languages: Danish and German.\n\nDanish is the official language, and German is a regional language spoken by the German minority in South Jutland.\n\nThe Danish language has roots in Old Norse, just like Swedish and Norwegian. If youâre visiting more than one Scandinavian country, youâll notice the similarities across all three languages.\n\nEnglish is also taught in many Danish schools across the country, with many Danes speaking it fluently. So donât worry if you canât speak Danish or German, as youâll be able to get by comfortably with English.\n\nWhat is the latest government travel advice for Denmark?\n\nDenmark regularly tops the list for being one of the safest countries in the world and there arenât many laws you need to be aware of.\n\nIf you plan to visit Denmark after stopping off in Sweden or Germany, border controls are currently in place for people arriving on ferries or travelling through the German border. Before you set off, make sure you understand Denmarkâs entry requirements for a stress-free journey.\n\nYou can also visit the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for the latest government travel advice for Denmark.\n\nWhat is the best time of year to visit Denmark?\n\nThereâs no shortage of things to do in Denmark throughout the year, but winter (December to February) has a unique charm.\n\nWinter in Denmark brings colder weather and the possibility of snow, making it the peak season for skiing and winter sports. If youâre a fan of winter activities, this is the perfect time to hit the slopes. In winter, youâll also experience cosy German-inspired Christmas markets and festive decorations throughout towns and cities.\n\nMarch to August is also a fantastic time to visit Denmark. The weather is warmer during these months and youâll be able to explore Denmarkâs coastline and natural parks without needing to wrap up!"
