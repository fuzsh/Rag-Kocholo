        "text": "Both cash and money in a bank account are based on trust. Citizens and businesses must have confidence that banknotes are not issued in such massive quantities that they lose their purchasing power in the way that happened in 1813. Back then, the King allowed the banknote printing press to run to finance massive war costs when Denmark was drawn into the Napoleonic Wars on the side of the French. This led to inflation in excess of 300 per cent, and citizens lost all confidence in the value of the money.\n\nDanmarks Nationalbank was therefore established to create order in the monetary system, and to restore citizens’ trust in the system and money in general. And this trust is something we continue to nurture today. We do so, among other things, by constantly making sure that the banknotes are kept up to date with the best and latest security features, so they are as difficult to counterfeit as possible.\n\nDanmarks Nationalbank issued its first banknotes in 1819. The first banknotes had very high denominations. The largest banknote in the 1819 banknote series was 100 rigsbankdaler. This was the equivalent of half the annual salary of a teller at Danmarks Nationalbank or a whole year’s pay for a manual labourer in Odense. Even the lowest denomination banknote – 1 rigsbankdaler – corresponded to a few days’ pay.\n\nThe first banknotes were therefore used for large financial transactions, for settling purchases on credit and for savings. Citizens still used coins for the majority of their daily purchases."
