        "text": "I spent several weeks in Norway last summer: Oslo - Nutshell/Flam - Bergen - Alesund - Trondheim - Roros - Dombas/Andalsnes - Oslo - Fredrikstad. Many enterprises had \"we don't take cash\" signs. I encountered only two places where I really had to have cash:\n\nA luggage locker in the Dombas train station (the toilet at the station took only cards)\n\nA public toilet in Ekebergparken in Oslo\n\nUse of cash in Norway is so rare that you'll struggle to find a bank-owned ATM in Oslo.\n\nMy guess is that $25 worth will be more than you need; have a plan for how you'll spend it at the end, since not every restaurant/shop/hotel will be willing to accept it; supermarkets may work. I don't remember what I did with the remains of my ATM withdrawal (which was probably about $40).\n\nI haven't been to Denmark but included Sweden and Finland in last year's trip. Norway was clearly farther along the path of eliminating use of cash than the other two.\n\nWe just got back from 2 weeks in Norway, Sweden and Finland and I can verify that not only do you not need much cash, but you'll find very few places that will even take it. I ordered foreign currency from my bank before the trip (because it's fun to look at the money!) but it was completely unnecessary. I actually had a hard time getting rid of it before the trip was over. In the Oslo airport as we departed, we even saw a billboard ad promoting cashless payment with the slogan \"Say NO to NOK\" :)\n\nI was in both countries last month for 3 weeks. I never obtained nor needed any Norwegian Kroner. Same with Danish currency. I did have the equivalent of about $3 in Danish coins from a previous trip. I used some to buy a transit ticket, but could have used a CC.\n\nI would say don't bother with currency. Especially in Norway where there are billboards about not using cash. (edit: I missed the above reference in the previous post. It was striking!)"
