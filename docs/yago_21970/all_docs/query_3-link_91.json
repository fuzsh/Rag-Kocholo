        "text": "When Kenneth Branagh does an impression of the ecstatic response kids have to his new movie, Cinderella, he goes into the yoga pose known as “happy baby.” Well, close to it—he’s still sitting in an office chair—but it’s an unmistakably childlike reaction, coming from a 54-year-old in a neat sweater and hip eyeglasses.\n\nWatching the director mime the “ticklish reaction” kids tend to have to the movie’s big moment raises a few notes of dissonance at first. This is Branagh, after all, the famed Shakespearean actor turned movie star turned improbable blockbuster director, who in a single year directed a hit Marvel movie (Thor) and received an Oscar nomination for playing Sir Laurence Olivier (in My Week with Marilyn). But then again, no matter how far he may seem to have strayed from his Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts–trained roots, Branagh maintains the actor’s connection to the audience—which might be how he’s tapped into kids’ brains so directly.\n\nIt doesn’t look anything like the most dazzling scenes in Branagh’s other films—the long tracking shots in Henry V, the desert showdown in Thor—but Cinderella’s (Lily James) transformation at the hands of her fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) is, Branagh says, one of the moments when he can watch the audience and know he’s gotten it right. “It was kids just sitting up when the Fairy Godmother came on, kids leaning forward, and that look round, the same look round,” he says, his voice rising in excitement. “ ‘This is it, we’re at Cinderella, it’s happening.’ ”\n\nThat excitement is a huge boon for Disney, which is now actively retelling many of its successful animated fairy tales in live-action form; hits like Frozen aside, they are minting money by telling stories the audience knows already. But that familiarity is a challenge for Branagh and the film’s screenwriter, Chris Weitz: How do you get anybody to care about yet another Cinderella? To do it, the two tapped into a fundamental lack of irony—their Cinderella is sweet and kind, their Prince rugged and handsome, and their romantic moments treated with the kind of show-stopping fanfare most films reserve for gun battles.\n\nIt’s a kind of sincerity that Branagh says hasn’t always come easy to him. He’s practiced meditation for 15 years, which he says has “made me sympathetic to people who are ready to let go of what irony does for them.” That has its downsides, too; “Sometimes I used to think to myself, ‘Have I lost a sense of humor?,’ but I don’t think that I have. I think one can be as snarky and sarcastic as lots of people, but I have never found that it makes me particularly happy.”\n\nBranagh’s approach to his sincere Cinderella was actually not that far from the way he adapted Shakespeare in films like Henry V or *Hamlet. * “At the beginning of the process where I became involved, I said, ‘You know what my big idea for this is, it is to get out of the way,’ ” Branagh says of early conversations with Disney executives. “This is from Shakespeare. On the whole you are trying to inflect, you are trying to bring a tonal shift or direction through which the piece can be released.”\n\nSo the story, from the death of Ella’s beloved father to the perfectly fitting glass slipper, is just as we know it, only with enough changes to distance it significantly from the 1950 animated version—Cinderella and the Prince (Richard Madden) have a real conversation both when they first meet and at the ball; the stepmother (Cate Blanchett) is just sympathetic enough to feel sorry for, and Cinderella’s passiveness in the face of constant abuse isn’t weakness, but nonviolent resistance.\n\nBranagh says he understood immediately the influence Cinderella might have on its young audience, more so than possibly any other film he’s made. “I was very aware coming into the picture that Disney has this amazing responsibility and influence,” he says. So when it came time for the ball, which the Prince opens up to the entire kingdom in the hopes his mystery love (Cinderella, of course), might attend, Branagh made sure to expand what the entire kingdom might look like. “Rather than trying to preach or be heavy-handed with it—‘there are the balls, there are people like you here. As long as everybody can come, they’ll all come.’ ”\n\nThe ballroom scene, for all its floaty romance and lingering shots of Cinderella’s stellar gown, is quietly exceptional; both the fashion and the faces of the crowd represent a wide range of ethnicities and cultures, as if the United Nations had arrived in this fairy-tale kingdom. “For me, it was absolutely as a matter of course that this would occur,” Branagh says of the diversity of the crowd. “Yes, historically it’s not possible, that wouldn’t have happened, at least not much in this kind of way. And yet it was vitally important.”\n\nBut for all the ways Branagh was able to tweak the classic, there were some things that had to stay the same—including the name of the stepmother’s cat, Lucifer, and the most memorable of Cinderella’s mouse friends. “I could have given Gus-Gus another name,” Branagh admits, referring to the most roly-poly of the C.G.I. mice. “But you know what I was aware of was that I enjoyed the sound of Gus-Gus as a comedy rhythm. Gus-Gus connects across 65 years. It seems like a good name for a mouse, [and] that’s also carrying a great big cultural wagon behind it of memory and affection and connection to the Cinderella experience, with the Disney experience, with families going to the movies together.”\n\nAnd that, to Branagh, is the key to his Cinderella—tapping into that nostalgia for “the Cinderella experience” without being trapped by it. “You can’t live in nostalgia-land,” he insists. “It can’t be just a life of looking backwards and being retro.” But those nostalgic and romantic touches—the gowns, the godmother, Gus-Gus—come with a nearly radical transformation to Cinderella, “knowing who she is and where she comes from, that she can in fact meet the man that she’s interested in and have a passionate and intelligent encounter with him.” She’s a Cinderella little girls will dress up as but the rest of us can admire. As Branagh says, “I felt that was definitely a little revolution inside the movie.”"
