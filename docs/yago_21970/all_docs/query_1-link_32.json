Or if Branagh requested it.\n\nEither way, it was definitely the highlight of Peter's Friends, which I always assumed would be a film that I would quite like but not find anything amazing in. I generally think that about all Branagh's films though. He is a pretty difficult director to pin down in that I couldn't imagine that anyone could be a fan of his career as a whole because it's been so surprisingly diverse.\n\nThis might be easiest thing he ever directed. Just a group of his friends gathering to shoot a film in a nice, posh house. Not much more to it than that. The usual dramas and laughs and excellent performances, with one revelation that I already knew about because somebody spoiled it for me 25 years ago. Probably some twat at school.\n\nWhat was most pleasing is that this isn't really a rich white people problem film as I expected, and not just because one of the characters is black. It actually deals, for the most part, with actual real problems, giving it some semblance of a dramatic grounding. Great soundtrack too, and a pretty easy Monday morning watch."
