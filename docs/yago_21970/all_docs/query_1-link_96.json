Some female and male nudity, and one fleeting sex scene where both partners are presumably entangled. Sexual references abound.\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 1 - Only verbal tongue lashings but no physical violence.\n\nLANGUAGE 6 - Approximately 35 F-words, as well as assorted anatomical references, scatological language and sexual references.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - AIDS, death, friendship, bisexuality, loneliness.\n\nMESSAGE - Time changes everything. One has to go on with life even under difficult circumstances.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
