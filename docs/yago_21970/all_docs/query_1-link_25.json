        "text": "Stephen Fry invites Kenneth Branagh, Alphonsia Emmanuel, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton and Emma Thompson to a miserable party. Branagh coaxes dreadful performances from his talented cast. Peter’s Friends wants to mix the angst of The Big Chill with the broad comedy of a Christmas Panto. Nothing works. The bisexual character isn’t the focus but the film is so terrible that I wanted to write about it.\n\nLearn more in my spoiler filled recap.\n\nAct One: College Chums\n\nScene One: College Revue\n\n(The cast performs an awful song in drag for a bored audience.)\n\nKENNETH BRANAGH: Let’s never give a performance that bad again.\n\nScene Two: Ten Years Later\n\nSTEPHEN FRY: Thank you for coming to my New Year’s party! I’ve something Very Important to tell you.\n\nALPHONSIA EMMANUEL: Nobody cares. Let’s all have sex.\n\nHORNY BOYFRIEND: I left my wife for you!\n\nALPHONSIA EMMANUEL: What a buzz kill. Get out. (He leaves.)\n\nAct Two: Subplots\n\nScene Three: Ambition\n\nRUDE AMERICAN ACTRESS: I want a bigger room! I want healthier food! I want attention!\n\nKENNETH BRANAGH: I hate my wife. She’s only here because she co-wrote the script.\n\nRUDE AMERICAN ACTRESS: Says the director who casts himself in all his films. (Leaves.)\n\nScene Four: Seduction\n\nEMMA THOMPSON: I’m a frumpy cat lady. But you’ve awoken my inner tigress.\n\nSTEPHEN: That’s nice but…\n\nEMMA THOMPSON: Stick it in me! (Strips naked.)\n\nSTEPHEN FRY: Oh honey, put those away.\n\nEMMA THOMPSON: I thought you were bisexual.\n\nSTEPHEN FRY: I am but I’m celibate. For a Very Important Reason.\n\nScene Five: Grief\n\nHUGH LAURIE: Stop phoning the babysitter.\n\nIMELDA STAUNTON: OUR FIRST BABY DIED! I’M NOT LETTING THE SECOND ONE DIE JUST BECAUSE YOU DRAGGED ME TO A PARTY!\n\nHUGH LAURIE: Would you feel better if we had rough sex?\n\nIMELDA STAUNTON: Of course. All any grieving mother needs is a deep d***ing.\n\n(They bang. Then do a silly dance.)\n\nAct Three: Big News\n\nScene Six: Happy New Year\n\nKENNETH BRANAGH: (Drunk acting.) I hate you Stephen Fry! Why did you invite us over!\n\nSTEPHEN FRY: I just want to tell you all I’m HIV positive. I chose to do so at a holiday party.\n\nKENNETH BRANAGH: I’M SO SORRY! I’M GOING TO SHOUT THE REST OF MY LINES!\n\nEMMA THOMPSON: The rest of us are going to be very quiet to show that the movie has turned serious.\n\nSTEPHEN FRY: Oh, don’t get serious. Would you feel better if we sang the awful song from the opening scene?\n\nEVERYONE: YES!\n\n(They sing.)\n\nTHE END\n\nWith Friends Like These\n\nReviews were mixed. Roger Ebert found it “amusing.” Todd McCarthy at Variety found it “cloying.” I found it wretched. The contrast between the dead baby drama and the camp comedy is jarring. The HIV announcement, while heavily foreshadowed, arrives too late in the film to be thoughtfully explored. The film seems almost embarrassed by it.\n\nPerhaps the starry cast set my expectations too high. Laurie, Staunton and Branagh scream through their big scenes. Emma Thompson would blossom into a fine character actress but is lost here. Stephen Fry perseveres by giving deadpan reactions to the nonsense around him. Rita Rudner’s cartoonish rude American belongs in a different film entirely. She’d soon trade screenwriting for stand-up comedy.\n\nYou can watch the film on TUBI. You can find more of my reviews on The Avocado and Letterboxd. My podcast, Rainbow Colored Glasses, can be found here.\n\nShare this:"
