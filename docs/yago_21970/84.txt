Sir Kenneth Branagh friends! Sam and Kenneth discuss the process of making his new film, All Is True, (5:07), the recurring themes throughout his work (10:10), performing Hamlet in front of Queen Elizabeth at age 20 (12:30), directing for the first time in 1989 (18:33), taking a break from Shakespeare with 1992’s Peter’s Friends (22:24), how his father influenced his work (34:52), the darkest (and slowest) period in his career (37:25), the death of “the middle” in contemporary cinema (43:25), and why Thor is not an anomaly in his prestigious body of work (47:02).
