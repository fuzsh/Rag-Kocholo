        "text": "Behind our online interactions are human beings who have human needs. In our fast-paced digital world, it's easy to overlook the person on the other side of the screen and just get down to business. Today is a good day as any to pause, appreciate, and connect genuinely. Whether it's acknowledging a colleague's contribution, offering words of encouragement, or simply asking how someone is doing. A supportive message, a shout-out for hard work, or a friendly check-in can light up someone's day. We're here not just to advance, but to uplift those around us. Remember, behind every email, LinkedIn notification, or Zoom call, there's a person who might just need a reason to smile. ______________________ So I‚Äôll go first; How are you doing today? #HumanConnection #WorkplaceWellness #KindnessMatters #GenuineInteraction #SupportiveWorkCulture #Tolulopemichael #Excelmindcyber #multiplesixfigurecoach\n\nüò§ Workplace annoyances got you feeling like you're in a sitcom?

Today in our all-staff discussion of our Strategic Plan, we talked about building psychological safety. Building psychological safety is built into our strategic plan as one of our strategies: \"Focus on learning and implementing strategies to build psychological safety.\" I don't know how we got there, but somehow Lou Williams shared with the group that they showed me how to make a Slack-Moji and used my headshot as the example. I share that while I was excited to learn how to make a Slack-Moji, I didn't know it would end up as an actual option for use in Slack...I can only imagine what they would use it for in private conversations with other team members. ü§£ So of course that led to Stephanie Boyle taking that Slack-Moji and making it into this GIF in our #joy channel in Slack. Ya'll. Why. Why is my team like this? Just kidding, I love it. It's giving success at creating psychological safety. So maybe I can check that strategy off our strategic plan? Maybe? I don't know. Happy Friday ya'll! I hope you have a great weekend and no one turns you into a GIF.\n\nA juicy, provocative slab of text that acts as bait. Next, a clarification after a line break that recontextualizes that initial pledge and fails to live up to that initial quiver of curiosity. Then some relatable generalizations that reveal, as this sentence winds on, that the substance of the post is actually anodyne workplace stuff you already knew in your bones. ‚òëÔ∏è A list broken out for easy skimming ‚òëÔ∏è Especially one with an uncited statistic ‚òëÔ∏è 67% seems like a catchy figure! Finally, an open-ended pander of a question to kick-off a comment section. Can you relate?\n\nListening to what's beneath what's being said is one of the key teachings we provide in Every Conversation Matters. One of our visual hacks has a lot to do with this!
