        "text": "NFCorpus is a full-text English retrieval data set for Medical Information Retrieval. It contains a total of 3,244 natural language queries (written in non-technical English, harvested from the NutritionFacts.org site) with 169,756 automatically extracted relevance judgments for 9,964 medical documents (written in a complex terminology-heavy language), mostly from PubMed.\n\nTerms of Use\n\nNFCorpus is free to use for academic purposes. For any other uses of the included NutritionFacts.org data please consult Terms of Service and contact its author Dr. Michael Greger directly.\n\nIf you use the corpus in your work, please cite: (Boteva et al., 2016).\n\nData\n\nThe corpus contains training, development and testing subsets randomly split on the query level (correspondingly, 80%, 10% and 10%).\n\nRelevance judgments are constructed from the direct and indirect links on the NutritionFacts.org website. The most relevant level corresponds to a direct link from a NutritionFacts article (query) to a medical article (document) from the cited sources section of a page, the next level is used between a query that links internally another NutritionFacts article that in turn links directly a medical document. Finally, the lowest level is reserved for queries and document connected through a topic/tag system on the NutritionFacts.org.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the corpus construction process, see the above publication.\n\nFormat\n\nEach of the training, development and testing subsets comes in three files:\n\nNutritionFacts.org queries data (.queries files, 5 different types) – natural, non-technical language\n\nmedical documents data (.docs files) – medical, very technical language\n\nrelevance judgments (.qrel files)\n\nThe detailed data format is described in the accompanying README in the archive.\n\nDownload\n\nNFCorpus.tar.gz (v1, crawled 27/07/2015, released 19/02/2016, 29.6MB, md5: 49c061fbadc52ba4d35d0e42e2d742fd)\n\nFAQ\n\nWhich flavor of NDCG was used?\n\nWe used the trec_eval script v9.0 from NIST.\n\nHow many documents were retrieved in the experiments?\n\nTop-1000 documents were retrieved. For other details of the setup see Sec 6.1 of our previous paper.\n\nWhich part of the dataset was used to obtain df’s for tfidf and the average document length for BM25?\n\nFull dataset. Evaluation of these baseline methods was still done on the test subset.\n\nPublication"
