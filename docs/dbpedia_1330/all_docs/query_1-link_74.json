        "text": "Hello,\n\nWe are still on V16 with most our customers due to the changes in the web interface which have made it quite a bit less pleasant to use. It is our hope that this will be improved in future releases.\n\nWhilst changes in the User interface can be unpleasant, lacking functionality and complicated workflows to do basic processes is something that our customers are not willing to accept. Therefore, one of the problems which I would like to solve asap is the functionality of click to call from a web browser. The web browser most of our customers use is Google Chrome.\n\nIt seems the 3CX Click2Call Chrome extension is still necessary in order to have click to call functionality. I have it installed and configured as seen in the screenshot below.\n\nThe problem which we are having is that ever since the update to 3CX v18, Chrome has started opening the following popup whenever a tel link is clicked. I want to be able to set a default device which is used whenever a tel link is clicked. This dialogue also appears if there is only one option.\n\nThe default app to be used for a tel link or a callto link are set to the new 3CX app in windows. This message seems to be Chromes doing.\n\nI have found the following solution to the problem. This didn't work for me though. None of the options stated in the solution were visible on any of the devices I checked.\n\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/t...-a-call-from-popup-when-clicking-on-tel?hl=en\n\nI apreciate any help.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDavid Schumann\n\nI don't understand 3CX not working with Google for changes like this. I have 75 people, 50 of which use that extension and it isn't working. Even the desktop app seems to be affected by the update to v18. It is a nightmare that frankly has cost us money. Who has time to do another's company's job in reaching out to Google? This is a complete loss of time and money. We are using this system because we thought it would be better but things like this should have been handled a little better. It should have been tested across the board on browsers and Google should have been part of the process considering the number of users that would be using it. Telling us to reach out to Google is like saying, call the president. The 3cx team should be reaching out to Google and asking what's what. I believe that would be more effective.\n\nHi @lynnie820,\n\nI never mentioned that anyone should reach out to Google on our behalf. I mentioned that if you run a google search you'll find similar threads non-specific to 3CX. If you run that search you'll find forum threads which mention a possible registry hack that may make it work, but I can't suggest that as it's a registry hack. I've provided the information as best I could, will close this thread now as there is nothing 3CX can do about this but wait for Google to implement changes already suggested to them (in the forums I mentioned above)."
