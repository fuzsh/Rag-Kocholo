Using cyclone trajectories derived from 6-hourly data, a comprehensive set of metrics is defined to systematically compare and contrast products with one another. In addition to annual TC climatologies, attention is paid to spatial and temporal patterns of storm occurrence and intensity. Assessment can be performed either on the global scale or for regional domains. Simple-to-visualize “scorecards” allow for rapid credibility assessment. We showcase three key findings enabled by this suite. First, we compare the representation of TCs in seven current-generation global reanalyses and conclude that higher-resolution models and those with TC-specific assimilation contain more accurate storm climatologies. Second, using a free-running Earth system model (ESM) we find that full basin refinement is required in variable-resolution configurations to adequately simulate North Atlantic Ocean TC frequency. Upstream refinement over northern Africa offers little benefit in simulating storm occurrence, but spatial genesis patterns are improved. We also show that TCs simulated by ESMs can be highly sensitive to individual parameterizations in climate models, with North Atlantic TC metrics varying greatly depending on the version of the Morrison–Gettelman microphysics package that is used.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nWith modeling and analysis techniques becoming increasingly more sophisticated, stakeholder demand for weather and climate data at regional scales continues to grow, particularly with respect to extreme and societally impactful events. One such atmospheric phenomenon that plays an important role in the hydroclimatology of eastern North America is the tropical cyclone (TC). TCs are warm-core, cyclonic storms characterized by heavy precipitation and strong winds that can lead to substantial loss of life and economic damage (Emanuel 2005; Mendelsohn et al. 2012). North Atlantic Ocean (NATL) TCs tend to form over lower-latitude warm ocean waters from June to November and represent 13% of all U.S. daily extreme precipitation events (Kunkel et al. 2012), even though only an average of two hurricanes per year over the 1900–2017 period made landfall in the United States (Weinkle et al. 2018).\n\nEven with recent advances in computational capabilities, TCs remain a difficult feature to simulate in the current generation of Earth system models (ESMs). At conventional atmospheric grid spacings of 1° (~100 km) or so, storms are severely underresolved (Vitart et al. 1997; Camargo 2013; Wehner et al. 2015; Camargo et al. 2020). Even at grid resolutions considered “high” for ESMs (i.e., 0.25° or ~25 km), TCs still suffer from structural deficiencies (Walsh et al. 2015; Davis 2018), generally leading to storms that are too weak or too large or occur too infrequently (Roberts et al. 2015).\n\nWhile resolution has been shown to have a strong relationship with modeled TC climatology, it is not the only driver of differences across datasets. Model configuration choices such as dynamical core (Zhao et al. 2012; Reed et al. 2015; Guimond et al. 2016), physical parameterizations (Vitart et al. 2001; Reed and Jablonowski 2011; Kim et al. 2012; Lim et al. 2015; Li et al. 2020), and ocean coupling strategy (Zarzycki et al. 2016; Zarzycki 2016; Scoccimarro et al. 2017; Li and Sriver 2018) have all been shown to contribute to spread in simulated TCs.\n\nFurther, free-running models (by definition) do not reproduce specific historical weather patterns. Therefore, storm events in these datasets cannot be collocated with observational records and require the use of tracking methods to flag events for statistical analysis (Williamson 1981; Hodges 1994; Ullrich and Zarzycki 2017). Even given identical model data, this can lead to uncertainties in storm statistics across methods (Horn et al. 2014; Roberts et al. 2020a) or even within methods (Walsh et al. 2007; Zarzycki and Ullrich 2017) due to tracker mechanics, parameter choices, and defined thresholds. Different groups apply their own tracking algorithms, leading to potential inconsistencies in reported results and a lack of clarity with regard to the strengths or weaknesses of various data products. Further, analyses have generally been relatively simplistic, focusing on storm counts and associated trends (Walsh et al. 2015). In combination, these discrepancies can lead to a large variation in postprocessed representation of TCs, making it unclear how end users should choose datasets for application.\n\nHere, we define a suite of metrics that can be used to categorize both the climatology of TCs in climate data and associated projections. We then apply these metrics to a variety of reanalyses and ESM data. By comparing these metrics to the historical record, impartial measures can be applied to evaluate models, inform ESM development, and help data users select products that best suit their needs. The remainder of this article is written as follows. Section 2 specifies the metrics and methods for evaluating performance of datasets against historical reference and section 3 specifies the data products used and the TC tracking configuration applied to all products. Section 4 details three scientific insights gained from metric evaluation and section 5 discusses the broader implications of this work and suggests future uses and paths for improvement.\n\n2. Metrics\n\na. Storm climatology and characteristics\n\nThe most basic measure of TC climatology is annual frequency (i.e., count or m), as measured by the number of discrete storm events. While commonly reported by modeling centers, this quantity has been shown to suffer from a lower signal-to-noise ratio arising from tracker configuration sensitivity, particularly to minimum duration thresholds (Horn et al. 2014; Zarzycki and Ullrich 2017). Changes in observing platforms and subjective storm definitions also lead to some uncertainty in observational counts, particularly with respect to short-lived, weak storms (Landsea et al. 2010; Villarini et al. 2011).\n\nTo mitigate potential uncertainty associated with short-lived storms in TC activity, integrated quantities can be applied. Perhaps the simplest example is TC days (TCD), defined as\n\nTCDm=14∑ocr6h,m,(1)\n\nwhere ocr6h,m is each occurrence of a 6-hourly tracked point during a storm’s lifetime. This can be thought of as “duration” for individual events and provides added climatological weight to longer-lived storms versus TCs only persisting for a few hours or days. TCD can be recalculated for other time frequencies by adjusting the weighting coefficient (i.e., 3-hourly data uses ⅛), although the vast majority of TC analyses utilize 6-hourly data to align with common synoptic reporting times.\n\nStorm genesis is defined as the first entry for each individual storm’s lifetime. It should be noted that genesis is complex to define for Lagrangian trajectories as observational records can be subjective (forecast centers may have different criteria for storm formation) and data resolution sensitivity can be large. We choose the “first trajectory point” definition for genesis here, although others (e.g., first point surpassing a threshold wind speed) should be explored in the future.\n\nStorm intensity can be defined by two frequently used variables: minimum sea level pressure at the cyclone center (SLP; hPa) and maximum 10-m (i.e., near surface) wind speed (u10; m s−1). Another integrated metric used with increasing frequency over the past couple of decades is accumulated cyclone energy (ACE). ACE can be thought of as an intensity-weighted version of TCD, with larger (smaller) values for more (less) intense and longer-lived (shorter lived) TCs (Bell et al. 2000). ACE for an individual storm m is defined as\n\nACEm=10−4∑u10,max,m2,(2)\n\nwhere u10,max,m is the 6-hourly maximum 10-m wind speed at each trajectory point and ACE is converted to 104 kt2 (1 kt ≈ 0.5 m s−1) for consistency with previous work.\n\nHere, we also define a similar measure—termed pressure ACE (PACE)—that uses minimum SLP as a measure of intensity instead of wind. We apply a wind–pressure relationship (WPR) to reconstruct the same ACE relationship for a given pressure distribution. We choose to include this calculation for two reasons. One, recent work has shown SLP to be a more skillful predictor of TC damage (Klotzbach et al. 2020). Two, based on previous work, we hypothesize SLP is a more accurately resolved quantity (compared to u10) at model spatial resolutions of interest in this study (Knutson et al. 2007; Manganello et al. 2012; Hodges et al. 2017; Chavas et al. 2017). Here, we define PACE as\n\nPACEm=10−4∑⁡(a1ΔPSLm2+a2ΔPSLm+a3)2,(3)\n\nwhere ΔPSLm = (1010 − SLPmin,m) for SLP in hectopascals and a1, a2, and a3 are coefficients of a least squares quadratic fit between u10 and SLP (i.e., a predicted u10 from SLP vs a discretely observed u10) for all TCs from the control dataset. For global TCs and the period 1980–2018 (inclusive), a1 is equal to 14.329 kt hPa−2, a2 is equal to 0.568 357 kt hPa−1, and a3 is equal to −0.001 053 71 kt. Note that for a “perfect” WPR, ACE and PACE should match exactly.\n\nWhile we choose the above for simplicity there is no formal requirement to use the quadratic fit in Eq. (3). One could also apply WPRs used operationally or derived for specific basins as other operationally employed or basin-specific WPRs may make more sense in a particular analysis context. Knaff and Zehr (2007) and Holland (2008) provide excellent discussions on the history, development, and application of techniques for relating TC winds to surface pressure. Application of other WPRs produced similar qualitative results to those discussed below (not shown). We also note that both ACE and PACE are sometimes thresholded in literature to only include storms above a certain intensity (e.g., Bell and Chelliah 2006; Knutson et al. 2015). We choose not to do this here because less intense storms contribute minimally to the global ACE budget, but a strict cutoff might invalidate TCs in low-resolution models, which are generally biased weak (Bengtsson et al. 1995; Camargo et al. 2005; Roberts et al. 2015). While we do not truncate the distributions in this article (i.e., all tracked TCs are included in the calculations), an option exists within the metric suite to define a cutoff wind speed or pressure for a TC point to be included in the ACE or PACE summation, respectively.\n\nLatitude of lifetime-maximum intensity (LMI) is defined as the absolute value of the latitude where a TC reaches its maximum intensity (as defined by maximum u10). Kossin et al. (2014) applied LMI analysis to evaluate potential anthropogenic trends in TC activity in the historical record, but even in steady-state climate regimes, LMI is an important quantity given population distribution as a function of latitude, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. Subsequent work has adopted LMI for use in regional scale analysis of TC activity (Daloz et al. 2015; Ramsay et al. 2018).\n\nb. Statistics\n\nTo evaluate the above metrics in a manner that permits dataset intercomparison, a variety of statistical techniques are employed. The most elementary measure is the arithmetic mean:\n\nx¯=1n∑i=1nxi,(4)\n\nwhere n is the number of items x in the sample. Bias is a straightforward measure of whether a particular product has a higher or lower metric than another. For bias b calculated with respect to test variable x, we define a reference (or control) y:\n\nb¯=x¯−y¯.(5)\n\nTo evaluate a metric with respect to temporal (e.g., seasonal cycle of storm frequency) or spatial (e.g., track or genesis density) patterns, we apply two forms of univariate correlation coefficients. The first form is the Pearson (ordinary) product-moment coefficient of linear correlation rxy, defined as\n\nrxy=∑i=1n⁡(xi−x¯)⁡(yi−y¯)∑i=1n⁡(xi−x¯)2∑i=1n⁡(yi−y¯)2.(6)\n\nWe choose the centered form, which measures the similarity of the pattern after removing the global mean (Santer et al. 1993), due to the fact that it provides a metric statistically independent of the mean bias (which is already considered as a separate metric). While the centered form is more common in statistical application (Wilks 2011), uncentered pattern correlations have been used to discriminate fields with similar patterns but with divergent means (Barnett 1986). Those interested in discussion with regard to the application of pattern correlations for weather and climate research are referred to Mitchell et al. (2001) and references therein.\n\nThe second correlation form is Spearman rank correlation ρs, defined as\n\nρs=1−6∑i=1nDi2n⁡(n2−1),(7)\n\nwhere Di is the difference in ranks between the ith pair of values. We choose rank correlation for nonspatial variables because Pearson methods can lack robustness or resistance in these cases (Wilks 2011). Theoretically, in the case of lower-resolution models that produce too few TCs on average, using a Pearson method for seasonal climatology (for example) may not distinguish sufficiently between models still producing a usable signal in summer months versus one sporadically producing TCs throughout the year. However, note that analysis using the Pearson method for temporal correlations produced qualitatively similar results to using ρs.\n\nWe emphasize that a particular product can have a bias closer to zero but poor correlations (e.g., a correct annual storm count, but the storms form out of season) or a skillful correlation but a higher bias magnitude (e.g., the correct relative spatial distribution of storm genesis but with storms forming at a reduced rate relative to that of the reference dataset). Therefore, it is important to consider multiple measures when evaluating a product.\n\nLast, when a verifiable pointwise (i.e., discrete event) dataset exists, TCs tracked with the algorithm can be evaluated directly against observed storms. This can be done with a 2-by-2 contingency table and simple hit rate (HR) and false alarm ratio (FAR) calculation as follows:\n\nHR=HH+Mand(8)\n\nFAR=FAFA+H,(9)\n\nwhere H represents the number of successful matches of storms in the climate product with the pointwise dataset, M represents the number of storms that exist in the pointwise dataset but are not detected in the climate product, and FA is the number of storms that are detected in the climate product but a corresponding match in the pointwise dataset cannot be found (Barnes et al. 2009; Wilks 2011). Here we perform this analysis storm by storm (i.e., across m), but similar results are found if matches are done on a 6-hourly occurrence-by-occurrence (i.e., across ocr6h,m) basis (not shown).\n\n3. TC tracking and data analysis\n\nThe metrics package relies on a universal tracker that can be used for tracking TCs. There are numerous options in literature [see appendix B in Ullrich and Zarzycki (2017) for a review]. Here, we apply the TempestExtremes software package (Ullrich and Zarzycki 2017) with the tunings defined in Zarzycki and Ullrich (2017). More details with regard to the method are provided in the appendix. It is important to highlight that the described metrics are agnostic to the choice of tracking method. While we choose the Zarzycki and Ullrich (2017) configuration for its demonstrated skill in evaluating reanalysis data products and model data, other groups could easily apply alternative configurations or algorithms to evaluate products in the manner described here. Further, the use of International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS; Knapp et al. 2010) observations as the reference dataset allows groups to use this metrics framework to evaluate and tune both novel and updated algorithms, including machine learning techniques (Kim et al. 2019; Kumler-Bonfanti et al. 2020), for quantifying extreme weather events in climate data.\n\nFor annual climatology, cumulative statistics are calculated over the entire evaluation period, which are then normalized on a per year basis to allow for samples of differing length and ensemble size. Seasonal temporal climatologies are calculated in similar fashion, with a particular quantity for a storm (e.g., count, TCD, ACE, and PACE) being binned by month of genesis and correlations (e.g., ρs,count, ρs,tcd, ρs,ACE, and ρs,PACE) being calculated accordingly.\n\nFor spatial pattern climatology, density maps are generated by aggregating occurrences into 8° by 8° bins. For total occurrence frequency (rxy,track) and genesis (rxy,gen) frequency correlations, the raw number of hits (per year) are summed in each bin. ACE (rxy,ace) and PACE (rxy,pace) are spatially integrated in the same manner. For patterns of maximum intensity, the maximum (minimum) u10 (SLP) occurring in each bin over the evaluation period are kept to calculate rxy,u10 (rxy,slp). All metrics requiring spatial information are weighted by the area of each bin. Statistical evaluation is not contingent on either regular latitude/longitude grids or the particular binning size; these were chosen for ease of implementation and based on past analyses. Cursory analyses (see Fig. S12 in the online supplemental material) using different bin sizes resulted in similar ranking of products (e.g., highest to lowest genesis correlation). Alternative techniques, such as the tessellation proposed by Elsner et al. (2012), or other quasi-uniform methods, could also be applied in the same manner.\n\nThe most encompassing study area for global climate products is the entirety of the tropics, which we will apply in section 4a. To evaluate regional credibility, we also focus on a particular ocean basin, the NATL, in sections 4b and 4c. This is done primarily to explore the domain-sensitivity aspects of simulations targeting that particular region and requires the additional step of filtering storms by their genesis locations prior to statistical analysis. The NATL basin has historically been well observed, with the National Hurricane Center’s Best Track dataset serving as a highly credible contribution to IBTrACS. However, the capability easily exists to evaluate other basins in a similar manner, which is left as a target for future work.\n\n4. Results\n\na. Application 1: Global reanalyses\n\n1) Data and methods\n\nAs an initial demonstration of the above techniques, we apply our evaluation system to a diverse set of modern reanalysis products of varying resolutions and configurations. Given that reanalysis products are generated from global numerical models combined with sophisticated data assimilation algorithms, they exist in a space between true point observations (which are spatiotemporally discontinuous) and free-running climate models (which generate their own internal weather, and therefore climatological, patterns). Reanalysis products are frequently used for downscaling and impact assessments (e.g., Andreadis et al. 2017; Baudouin et al. 2019). They are also commonly used as tools to validate algorithms developed for use on free-running climate model data (Strachan et al. 2013; Ullrich and Zarzycki 2017). The evaluation of how well TCs are represented in these products has been an area of research over the past decade, owing to the improved capability of such products to simulate storms directly (Schenkel and Hart 2012; Murakami 2014; Zick and Matyas 2015; Hodges et al. 2017; Zarzycki and Ullrich 2017).\n\nSeven global reanalyses are used. These include the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA), versions 1 and 2 of the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA and MERRA-2), both the ECMWF interim reanalysis (e.g., ERA-Interim, hereinafter ERAI) and the subsequently updated version ERA5, and the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CRv3). All data are analyzed on the postprocessed output grids of each product, which are shown in Table 1 along with time periods and data references. Time periods were chosen to span 1980–2018 to isolate the satellite era, although 20CRv3 and MERRA only contain data through the end of 2015. To extend the time period of CFSR beyond 2011, we append the analyses of the Climate Forecast System. Although the two products are highly similar, subtle differences are described in section 2 of Saha et al. (2014). Cursory evaluation of the TC climatology from before and after 2011 indicates no noticeable TC changes (not shown).\n\nReference observations (i.e., y) are from IBTrACS, version 4, which is compiled from quality-controlled records from various forecasting centers. In particular, we select TCs reported by World Meteorological Organization (WMO) official forecast centers. We only include storms of tropical storm strength (u10 > 17.5 m s−1) or greater. Any TC points in the dataset that were missing either a value of u10 or SLP (but contained the other) were updated using the relationship in Knaff and Zehr (2007). Any TC that did not contain any intensity information was assumed to be a tropical depression and not included. These omissions were rare and generally occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. We acknowledge that this arises due to the poorer quality of observations and lack of standardization in some of these basins (Schreck et al. 2014) and makes it important to apply the same reference consistently against all products. No additional TC filtering or data correction (e.g., time averaging of wind speed, height of observations) are applied. For the remainder of this article, we will apply IBTrACS as a common reference, although we should note that other data (e.g., a preindustrial or other control model simulation) could also be used.\n\n2) Annual domain-averaged climatology\n\nFigure 1 shows global average statistics on a per annum basis for each of the products, ordered approximately from lowest to highest resolution. The top line (OBS) represents average statistics from IBTrACS and is highlighted in gray (i.e., the “reference”), with each subsequent line representing a particular product’s bias relative to the aforementioned reference. These biases are color-coded from red (biased high) to blue (biased low), with the lightest shades representing values generally indistinguishable from the reference. Color map ranges are determined by the bias relative to the multiples of interannual standard deviation σ in each column.\n\nIBTrACS contains approximately 80 TCs per year, a number in agreement with other previous literature (Ramsay 2017), although some uncertainty exists in that estimate due to differing observing centers and storm classifications (Schreck et al. 2014). Note that all storms are included, regardless of lifetime, to remain consistent with past applications of observed TC climatologies: filtering IBTrACS by the same 60-h duration threshold in TempestExtremes leads to an approximately three storm per year reduction globally.\n\nWorking down the first column, the vast majority of reanalyses have a low bias in annual TC count (b¯clim,count), with the lower-resolution ERAI producing the least number of TCs (79.6 − 36.6 = 43 per year). Products of higher resolution (e.g., ERA5, CFSR) and with TC-specific assimilation (e.g., JRA, MERRA-2) produce more TCs, with MERRA-2 containing too many TCs as detected by TempestExtremes (100.1 yr−1). When accounting for storm lifetime (i.e., TCD), the low bias tends to be improved for many products (b¯clim,tcd). This is due to the fact that longer-lived TCs contribute more to TCD climatology, and these storms are better represented than weak, short-lived storms (both are considered “equal” when applying a count-based measure). Interestingly, both ERA5 and JRA have slight high biases in TCD; this may be due to the tracker detecting storms before they are officially named by relevant agencies (e.g., invests in the NATL) or following individual cyclones past their lysis (e.g., through extratropical transition). MERRA-2 also shows a high bias in TCD. This bias is larger on a relative basis than storm count, implying that not only are there more TCs than observations, but that these storms persist for too long.\n\nFor both ACE (b¯clim,ace) and PACE (b¯clim,pace), the reanalyses are uniformly biased low, underscoring that even for models producing near-observed count and TC day climatologies, their storms are too weak. This is a well-known aspect of TCs in reanalyses (Schenkel and Hart 2012; Murakami 2014; Hodges et al. 2017) and climate models (Camargo and Wing 2016), and likely will only be alleviated with more frequent, higher density observations combined with finer model grids.\n\nHowever, a few aspects of the ACE and PACE results are worth noting. First, all reanalyses simulate PACE better than ACE. In other words, the average simulated SLP climatology is more closely related to observations than u10. Even though near-surface wind is more commonly used to classify TCs (Simpson 1974), this suggests those interested in applying global datasets should consider an observationally constrained WPR rather than direct surface winds output by the model.\n\nSecond, the magnitude of the discrepancy between ACE and PACE biases varies between products. For example, while CFSR, ERA5, and JRA all have ACE biases that are roughly similar to one another (−348, −363, and −375 104 kt2 yr−1, respectively), their PACE biases are significantly more different (−310, −173, and −261 104 kt2 yr−1, respectively). This indicates that the association between surface pressure and wind varies in these models, a relationship commonly queried by climate modelers (Knutson et al. 2007). This finding is not new, with prior work finding a similar inability of both reanalyses and free-running climate models to simulate the intense wind speeds associated with a given surface pressure (Knutson et al. 2007; Manganello et al. 2012; Hodges et al. 2017). This is likely due to a mixture of issues, including surface momentum flux formulation (Moon et al. 2007; Bryan 2012), boundary layer parameterization (Bao et al. 2012; Kepert 2012), errors in simulating storm size (Chavas et al. 2017), and the resolvability of inner core gradients (Davis 2018). Zick and Matyas (2015) interestingly found that landfalling NATL TCs in CFSR actually showed wind speeds that were slightly too high for a given pressure. Given that their subset includes only storms over land, it implies that reanalysis biases in the TC WPR are not purely model driven but also likely depend on both the surface observational network and boundary condition characteristics (e.g., surface layer formulations and coupling).\n\nLast, in the final column, we see that the majority of products have a poleward (positive) bias in LMI. TCs tend to increase in size at higher latitudes (Knaff et al. 2014), so this is likely the manifestation of models more poorly simulating storm structure (and therefore intensity) closer to the equator. However, this is not absolute across all datasets. For example, the fact that MERRA-2 has an equatorward (negative) bias in LMI could hint that its assimilation scheme is performing better at lower latitudes, that there are additional false alarms at lower latitudes, or that the storms are not being tracked as far poleward as in other products. The exact mechanisms for this may vary on a product-to-product basis, but this suite provides an initial starting point for more targeted research.\n\n3) Spatial climatology\n\nThe spatial climatology of TCs is of critical importance given the highly regionalized nature of cyclone impacts, even within a specific basin (Vecchi et al. 2014; Done et al. 2015). Spatial patterns have also been shown to be more sensitive for detection of climate signals (Kossin et al. 2014; Murakami et al. 2020). Models can have very similar basinwide climatologies (e.g., the metrics in Fig. 1) but vastly different storm tracks within that basin, implying different model behavior and subsequently resulting in highly disparate regional impact projections.\n\nSpatial TC climatology is evaluated via pattern correlation of six model-produced fields (averages based on the time periods listed in Table 1) to observations, shown in Fig. 2. Note that colors are determined by scaling to the maximum and minimum values in each column (i.e., for each metric). The first metric is cumulative track density (rxy,track), the most exhaustive measure of TC activity. An example of the spatial track density patterns used to derive the correlations is shown in Fig. 3. It is clear all products produce reasonable distributions of storm occurrence when compared to observations (top left), although subtle differences are apparent upon closer inspection. For example, while ERAI and MERRA have similar annual storm climatologies, ERAI’s eastern North Pacific Ocean climatology exhibits less similarity to observations.\n\nIn general, all reanalyses score highly; the lowest correlation is still a quite robust 0.86 (MERRA-2). CFSR, JRA, and ERA5 all have spatial correlations 0.96–0.97. This is to be expected, given that reanalysis products are strongly constrained by observations, including techniques designed specifically to improve TC representation, such as synthetic dropsondes and vortex relocation (Schenkel and Hart 2012). All three products are also of finer grid spacing, with resolution shown to be an important factor in the dynamical representation of TCs (Manganello et al. 2012; Walsh et al. 2015). Note, that as observed above, MERRA has a slightly higher correlation than ERAI, confirming a more representative spatial pattern, even with similar global frequency.\n\nThe spatial pattern of genesis (rxy,gen) across the datasets is a bit more muddled. For reanalysis, this particular metric may have less utility—it is likely storms are merely being detected further along in their lifespan, artificially inducing errors in genesis location when compared to the pointwise record. This will be discussed more in depth in the next section, but we briefly highlight reanalysis results here. All else being equal, we expect lower resolutions to have poorer genesis skill since these models tend to poorly resolve TCs (Walsh et al. 2015). As such, even if two products both contain the same particular TC, we expect the higher-resolution product to simulate the storm with greater intensity for a greater duration of its lifespan. Spurious TC genesis will also lead to lower correlations, which is likely occurring with MERRA-2—it is obvious too many TCs are being generated in the eastern Pacific Ocean and southern Indian Ocean, for example (Fig. 3).\n\nThe last four correlations query spatial patterns of different intensity measures. rxy,u10 and rxy,slp measure the spatial correlation as measured by the maximum (minimum) u10 (SLP) over each grid box over the duration of the sampling period. Note that there is no weighting based on how many storms occur in a particular region; these correlations highlight the ability of the product to produce spatial patterns of storm strength analogous to observations. Confirming what was discussed above, rxy,u10 and rxy,slp for each model may also differ, underscoring differences in how various products represent the WPR.\n\nLast, rxy,ace (rxy,pace) is the spatial correlation of the annual accumulated ACE (PACE) in each gridbox. This is essentially a blend of rxy,track and rxy,u10 (rxy,slp), with contributions both from the total occurrence frequency as well as the intensity of TCs occurring in that geographic region. Since all reanalysis products have lower correlations for the intensity based metrics, it is no surprise that rxy,ace is uniformly lower than rxy,track, although this blended metric provides insight into the joint behavior of storm occurrence and intensity, generally considered most relevant for impacts-related research (Bell and Chelliah 2006; Caron et al. 2015). With this measure, CFSR, ERA5, and JRA “stand out” as before. 20CRv3 scores much better for SLP-derived metrics, which is not surprising since only surface pressure observations are assimilated (Slivinski et al. 2019). MERRA-2 has a higher correlation than MERRA even though rxy,track was higher for MERRA. This is because MERRA-2 possesses a vastly improved rxy,u10, implying a much better representation of TC intensity in the newer product. Note that, as expected, rxy,pace broadly shows similar results to rxy,ace, albeit with systematic improvements due to the aspects discussed above.\n\n4) Intra-annual climatology\n\nAs with spatial climatology, a reasonable annual-mean climatology may still arise in the presence of offsetting errors during different times of the year. Here, we apply month-by-month ranked correlation to evaluate the ability of models to produce the correct seasonal cycle of TCs. The scores over the time period for the reanalysis products are shown in Fig. 4.\n\nHere, MERRA-2 has the highest ρs,count implying that the biases seen in Fig. 1 are fairly evenly distributed throughout the calendar year without specific temporal bias. Conversely, ERA5 has a slightly lower intra-annual correlation, which could mean that biases impacting the skillful annual climatology are fairly localized in time.\n\nThe ρs,tcd, ρs,ace, and ρs,pace all behave somewhat similarly as above, albeit with subtle differences. For example, while the spatial correlations of the intensity metrics for MERRA in Fig. 2 are very low, the seasonal correlations for ACE and PACE are both quite high, implying MERRA is more accurate in discriminating seasonal differences in TC intensity than spatial differences. ρs,LMI shows the temporal correlation of LMI, although it is acknowledged that this particular metric may be most useful when only isolating a particular hemisphere or basin where the sign of LMI evolution on a month-by-month basis is more clear (Gilford et al. 2019).\n\n5) Taylor diagrams\n\nAnother way of visualizing multiple metrics is via the use of a Taylor diagram (Taylor 2001). Such a figure contains information about spatial patterns, variance, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and bias. The utility in such diagrams is they provide a single panel visual assessment of multiple metrics in relation to a reference dataset.\n\nFigure 5 shows the synthesis of these four measures. The closer a point lies to the “perfect” (PERF) point in space, the closer its combined correlation (angle from horizonal) and variance (radial axes) are to the control dataset. Datasets with high correlations and variance similar to observations also have low RMSE by definition (concentric dashed rings). As shown in Fig. 2, CFSR, JRA, and ERA5 all have high spatial correlations, with the latter two datasets having too much variance, increasing their RMSE slightly. Both CFSR and JRA have slight low biases (downward triangles) in storm frequency (i.e., m) with ERA5 counts within 5% of observations. 20CRv3 has a slightly worse correlation and low count bias but accurate variance. ERAI and MERRA have low biases with too little variance while MERRA-2 shows an opposite response for both quantities.\n\n6) Discrete storm hit and false alarm rates versus historical observations\n\nLast, while there is an obvious lack of a verifiable pointwise dataset for free-running future climate integrations, reanalysis products are unique in that they can be compared on a storm-by-storm basis. We emphasize that these pointwise datasets are also not necessarily perfect due to changing observational platforms and forecaster subjectivity. For example, Truchelut et al. (2013) used reanalyses to propose the existence of undetected (i.e., not observed) TCs that are not included in the presatellite historical record.\n\nTable 2 shows the hit and false alarm results for this particular configuration of TempestExtremes. Hits are defined by TCs tracked in reanalysis that can be matched to a report in IBTrACS within a 2° great circle distance at the same reporting time. False alarms are algorithmically tracked TCs with no corresponding observational match. The HR is broken into two types, the HR for only “named” TCs (WMO definition of cyclones with u10 ≥ 17 m s−1) and that for TCs of category-1 hurricane intensity on the Saffir–Simpson scale (u10 ≥ 33 m s−1). As noted in Murakami (2014) and Hodges et al. (2017), we expect the HR to increase with increasing intensity restrictiveness, because strong TCs are more likely to be hits and less likely to be false alarms.\n\nHit rates range from 48% in ERAI to 78% in ERA5 for all named storms and from 73% in ERAI to 95% in ERA5 for category 1 and above. False alarm rates range from 2% (20CRv3) to 33% (MERRA-2). Contextually, this means that only 2 of every 100 storms tracked in 20CRv3 do not have an IBTrACS match, but more than 3 of every 10 in MERRA-2 do not.\n\nNote that these hit rates are comparable to those published in previous papers (Murakami 2014; Hodges et al. 2017; Befort et al. 2020) albeit with reduced false alarms. This suggests the combination of sea level pressure and geopotential thickness anomalies (as defined in Zarzycki and Ullrich 2017) are sufficient for tracking cyclones and discriminating thermal structure, although, as noted earlier, future applications of the methods described here could be used for additional tuning of existing algorithms or development of new algorithms to make them more physically consistent, particularly for the assessment of unconstrained model data.\n\nInterestingly, the FAR for MERRA-2 is high. There is evidence that too many TCs are being detected in the dataset, a result also found in Hodges et al. (2017) and Roberts et al. (2020a). This value is more than double that of the next product, even with identical tracking methods applied. Differences in Fig. 3 are largest in the southern Indian and Pacific Oceans, implying regional biases may be key, such as representation of seasonal monsoonal troughs, the tropical easterly jet, or the Madden–Julian oscillation (Bessafi and Wheeler 2006). This behavior also could arise from strong moist processes near the grid scale (e.g., convection), which may be leading to both a large warming signal in the midtroposphere as well as the generation of a surface low that is detected by the tracker. Subjective analysis of the MERRA-2 single-level fields did show more variance (i.e., “noise”) at small spatial scales, although formal confirmation of any specific hypothesis is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nb. Application 2: Minimum variable-resolution domain extent required to simulate Atlantic TCs\n\n1) Data and methods\n\nFor the remaining two applications, we choose to highlight a subset of metrics described above, both for brevity and to provide focus on their application to answer two specific research questions. We also focus explicitly on the NATL and all statistics are calculated for that basin’s regional climatology. The corresponding NATL graphics for the reanalyses in the previous section are contained in the online supplemental material.\n\nAlthough globally uniform high-resolution climate simulations have shown fidelity in simulating TCs, they remain computationally prohibitive. Because of this, variable-resolution configurations (Zarzycki and Jablonowski 2014) have been rapidly growing in popularity as tools to achieve both regional refinement (akin to a limited area model) with global connectivity and unification (akin to a general circulation model). The use of such models requires information about where to place areas of high spatial resolution in order to provide the most accurate result without expending unneeded computational resources. However, this process of domain selection has historically been more art than science, with most objective analyses being limited to limited area models (Caron and Jones 2012; Matte et al. 2017).\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of a metrics suite for model development and evaluation purposes, we compare a selection of ESM simulations. All simulations are completed with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), which is part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Specifically, we use CAM5 (Neale et al. 2012), with the variable-resolution (V-R) option (Zarzycki et al. 2014b) of the spectral element (CAM-SE) dynamical core (Taylor et al. 2007; Dennis et al. 2012). We use a physics time step of 900 s. CAM-SE is coupled to the Community Land Model, version 5 (Lawrence et al. 2019), and prescribed historical sea surface temperatures and sea ice are applied as boundary conditions via the HadISST (Hurrell et al. 2008) dataset. The setup is highly similar to that utilized in Zarzycki et al. (2017). The key difference is the addition of an updated version of the Morrison–Gettelman microphysics (Gettelman and Morrison 2015) in the simulations contained in this article; the impact of this design choice is discussed in the next section.\n\nFirst, a reference three-member ensemble is completed using global 1° grid spacing (GLOB100), corresponding to the standard resolution of ESMs used in present-day global intercomparisons (Eyring et al. 2016). The latter three sets of simulations use varying sizes of refined meshes encompassing the NATL basin. These grids are all refined to approximately 0.25° resolution, which has been shown to produce credible simulations of TCs in CAM (Zarzycki and Jablonowski 2014; Wehner et al. 2015; Bacmeister et al. 2018) and correspond to the current classification of “high resolution” ESMs (Haarsma et al. 2016).\n\nFor the purposes of evaluating regional impacts associated with TCs, high-resolution domains over particular subbasins or along specific coastlines represent the most computationally inexpensive configuration. However, these offer the greatest risk that boundary condition or far-field errors (including underresolution) may lead to spurious local climatology. A logical choice may be refinement over the entire ocean basin itself, yet the potential exists for such a domain to not account for the generation of upstream features [e.g., African easterly waves (AEWs)] that impact climatology. Domains that include both the basin of interest and upstream regions of climatological relevance could be considered the “gold standard” with respect to resolution; however, these would obviously be the most computationally expensive simulations, which may be important for researchers with limited resources.\n\nThe standard resolution reference and three V-R grids applied here are shown in Fig. 6 and were also used in Stansfield et al. (2020). The smallest V-R grid (least costly in terms of computing requirements) only encompasses the western NATL, where storms that make landfall along eastern North America occur. This is termed the western NATL grid (WAT). The largest grid (most costly) not only covers the entire NATL, but also northern Africa, where AEWs that serve as seeds for main development region (MDR) TCs form. This is termed the extended NATL grid (EXT). A third grid of intermediate extent and cost only encompasses the NATL, with upstream wave features being simulated at the same 1° resolution of the background grid. This is termed the reference grid (REF). WAT contains 7739 elements, REF contains 13 289 elements, and EXT contains 17 331 elements. Since the variable-resolution version of CAM-SE has been shown to scale linearly with the number of elements when the dynamical time step is constrained by the same fine resolution (Zarzycki et al. 2014a), WAT and EXT respectively require about 58% and 130% of the computing resources as REF for the same simulation length.\n\n2) Metrics\n\nBoth seasonal and spatial correlation of simulated TCs to IBTrACS are shown in Fig. 7. Broadly, the GLOB100 simulation scores poorly when ranked across the aggregate sum of metrics. This is an unsurprising result given the known resolution sensitivity of simulated storms in climate models (Camargo and Wing 2016) and underscores the lack of suitability of standard-resolution models for discrete TC analysis.\n\nTherefore, we focus on WAT, REF, and EXT, all of which have 0.25° resolution over the western portion of the NATL basin (and corresponding seaboard) but with varying extent of this resolution eastward. When evaluating these three products, a clear bifurcation occurs between the WAT simulations and both the REF and EXT runs. As the domain is extended from WAT to REF, there is clear improvement in the majority of metrics, particularly with respect to spatial patterns. This suggests refinement over the entire Atlantic is required for accurate basinwide TC climatology. Less of an improvement is seen going from REF to EXT (extending high resolution over Africa); the correlation in total TC activity is the same, but slight improvements are noted in genesis location and intensity distributions with the larger refinement region. This demonstrates a more nuanced impact of high-resolution over northern Africa; the broad TC climatology does not change, but genesis patterns do.\n\nThis result would appear to be in agreement with observations, which show that the majority of intense Atlantic TCs form in the MDR from AEWs (Thorncroft and Hodges 2001; Kossin et al. 2010). Interestingly, this also seems to align with Patricola et al. (2018), who found AEWs do not constrain the NATL frequency of TCs but do impact their formation region. Here, better resolved jet dynamics and waves more strongly impact the higher-order metrics of storm activity (where storms form and where they reach peak intensity) as opposed to the raw frequency of all TCs, independent of intensity or specific formation mechanism.\n\nIt is perhaps interesting that GLOB100 scores better for aggregate track correlation than WAT in Fig. 7a. However, when considering that the correlation normalizes for the background level of storm activity by removing the mean, it is obvious that this arises due to the fact that the relative WAT track density is disproportionately “tilted” toward the western half of the NATL due to the selective refinement (Figs. S18 and S19 in the online supplemental material), leading to spatial inhomogeneities in the model solution, and underscoring the need to consider multiple statistics associated with storm climatology for evaluating the credibility of a dataset.\n\nFigure 8 shows the Taylor diagram for the domain-sensitivity experiments. It is clear that, while WAT serves as a large improvement over the low-resolution GLOB100 simulation, local refinement over only part of the basin still results in a severely degraded TC climatology, calling into question its credibility with regard to impactful, near-coastline TCs. Conversely, both REF and EXT show both higher correlation, better variance, and reduced bias, implying that both configurations do an excellent job simulating a basinwide storm climatology that is closely matched to that observed over the past four decades.\n\nTherefore, for just simulating the occurrence of TCs, it is obvious that REF is superior to WAT, but that the additional computational cost associated with EXT may not be warranted. Purely local refinement in this case is sufficient. However, moving to higher-order metrics such as genesis location or intensity patterns, there is further (albeit marginal) improvement in model skill when also simulating the storm pregenesis region (i.e., northern Africa) with high resolution. This implies added value associated with more accurate simulation of precursor features, leading to a more credible distribution of TCs, although researchers need to weigh the particular science questions of interest with the computational requirements of both configurations to determine which one is more suitable for their needs.\n\nc. Application 3: Sensitivity of North Atlantic TC climatology to parameterization configuration\n\n1) Data and methods\n\nIn section 4b, note that no global 0.25° reference simulation is applied. This is primarily due to the computational expense of creating new global 0.25° runs (86 400 elements; 777 602 degrees of freedom), which are more than 11 times as costly as REF on a per-simulation-year basis. Given this, we chose to analyze a previously completed three-member ensemble of 0.25° simulations using a slightly earlier version of the CAM5 physics package (Bacmeister et al. 2018). We call these runs GLOB025.\n\nThere were two main changes to the model configuration for the runs completed as part of this study when compared to GLOB025. One, we use prescribed aerosols in lieu of prognostic aerosols. This only allows a one-way interaction of aerosols into the climate system (i.e., the aerosols can impact the atmospheric solution, but the atmospheric solution cannot impact the aerosols at the next time step) and results in approximately a 50% computational savings due to reduced tracer transport and chemistry parameterization.\n\nSecond, we applied the Morrison–Gettelman, version 2 (MG2), microphysics scheme [instead of version 1 (MG1)], which includes advection of rain and snow in addition to cloud ice and cloud water (Gettelman and Morrison 2015). This newer version has been largely untested for TC simulations, although it has shown improvement in other aspects of climate such as mountain snowpack (Rhoades et al. 2018) and stratiform clouds (Gettelman et al. 2019).\n\nWhen we compare the performance of the GLOB025 runs with the REF runs, a significant difference in the number of TCs (19.1 storms per year in the NATL vs 13.2) is seen. This is unexpected, as when VR-CESM simulations have been run with the exact same physics configuration as a high-resolution reference simulation, regional climatology is highly similar between matching high-resolution areas (Zarzycki et al. 2014b). Given this contradictory result, we seek to explain these discrepancies by reverting parameterization upgrades in a one-at-a-time manner from REF to match those previously applied in the GLOB025 simulations. Table 3 shows the set of 9-yr sensitivity experiments to complement the REF runs from section 4b and GLOB025.\n\n2) Metrics\n\nFigure 9 shows the mean climatological biases for GLOB025, REF, and the associated sensitivity runs. When reverting the VR-CESM simulations with the REF mesh back to the particular physical parameterization suite from GLOB025 (i.e., MG1-CHEM), we can closely reproduce the GLOB025 NATL TC climatology. It does not appear the treatment of two-way versus one-way coupled aerosols plays a critical role in mean storm climatology. While prognostic aerosols slightly suppress more integrated measures of TC activity (i.e., TCD, ACE, and PACE), in general, REF and MG2-CHEM are similar, and MG1-CHEM and MG1-NO are also similar. However, it is obvious that the particular microphysics treatment in CAM5 plays a significant role in the model’s simulated TC climatology. Moving to a scheme with prognostic condensed water species (i.e., REF and MG2-CHEM) results in a reduction in TC frequency and intensity relative to the older MG1 formulation (i.e., GLOB025, MG1-CHEM, and MG1-NO). Further, this reduction reduces an existing high bias in both of these quantities in older versions of CAM5, bringing statistics more in line with observations. This is perhaps most clearly elucidated in the Taylor diagram in Fig. 10, where two distinct clusters of points arise, with each configuration in said clusters sharing similar spatial correlation, variance, and bias in TC activity (annotated by two colored circles).\n\nWhile a more thorough analysis of this TC response to microphysics is beyond the scope of this paper, we hypothesize potential mechanisms here. These results may imply that MG1 provides more gridscale latent heat release in the core of TCs. This could lead to a “supercharged” thermodynamic heat engine sustaining very intense storms at resolutions considered “high” for climate application, but unable to fully simulate storm inner core processes (see discussion in Davis 2018). We speculate that such storms may be “overparameterized,” with subgrid thermodynamic processes effectively “double counting” resolved scale ones. The coupling of MG1 to the tropical climate may also be contributing to more “gridpoint” storms (Williamson and Olson 2003), aggregating relative vorticity near the grid scale, which can therefore serve as TC “seeds” (Zhao et al. 2012; Vecchi et al. 2019). Most important, as climate models move toward TC-permitting resolutions, understanding of how the subgrid parameterization suites impact storm climatology is critical.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nIn this article, we define a suite of statistical metrics that can be used to objectively evaluate simulated TC climatology over defined time periods and spatial regions. Such a suite has marked utility in evaluating the credibility of simulated storms and the suitability of particular datasets for a variety of applications, including TC–climate interactions, model development, and storm projections.\n\nWe note that commonly reported measures, such as annual TC frequency, suffer from tracker uncertainty and fail to provide more-nuanced context relevant at the regional scales. As such, we utilize more integrated metrics (TCD, ACE, and PACE) in conjunction with information about the spatiotemporal characteristics of the storm distribution. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach, we apply these metrics to arrive at three conclusions with regard to both high-resolution reanalysis and climate data:\n\nNewer and higher-resolution reanalyses such as ERA5, CFSR, and JRA-55 produce better global TC climatologies than older and/or lower-resolution products, although it is impossible to define one “superior” product without accounting for scientific application.\n\nWith respect to V-R NATL ESM TC climatology, only refining over a subset of the basin results in degraded TC climatology relative to an identical level of refinement over the entirety of the basin. Subtle improvements are associated with further refinement over northern Africa (to better resolve upstream precursors), although this improvement is relatively minor and specific to certain metrics, such as genesis location.\n\nSubtle changes in parameterization configuration can have dramatic changes in simulated TC climatology. Simulations with nearly identical configurations of the CAM5 physics package show reduction in climatological error when using an advanced two-moment microphysics treatment that prognoses rain and snow hydrometeors. Careful vetting of specific model configurations is required to ascertain strengths and weaknesses of TC climatology in high-resolution simulations.\n\nSome additional discussion is warranted. We only test one tracker configuration here, although an alternative configuration of TempestExtremes loosely based on Harris et al. (2016) shows similar reanalysis-to-reanalysis relative rankings (Fig. S11 in the online supplemental material). Roberts et al. (2020a,b) used two different trackers [TRACK (Hodges et al. 2017) and TempestExtremes] across a suite of high-resolution models and found that, while the climatologies derived by the two trackers differed, particularly in the weak tail of TC distributions, the relative differences across models was generally robust regardless of tracker (e.g., models exhibited similar spatial biases in TCs tracked by either TRACK or TempestExtremes). Further, the findings of the reanalysis evaluation performed here are not surprising in light of previous work (Schenkel and Hart 2012; Murakami 2014; Hodges et al. 2017). While this corroboration demonstrates the fidelity of using such metrics for rapidly and objectively evaluating a product’s performance it also implies that well-posed tracking methods are typically able to discriminate large differences between datasets (e.g., if one model produces more TCs than another) assuming the same algorithm is used to evaluate both. However, more subtle differences may require substantial uncertainty analysis and therefore exploring the “skill” of particular trackers is a future extension of this work.\n\nIn this vein, we emphasize that the metrics package evaluated here is independent of tracking method. One could envision using alternative Lagrangian tracking methods or more manual, “hand curated” methods. An interesting evaluation would be comparing algorithms that attempt to account for various grid spacings (e.g., Camargo and Zebiak 2002; Walsh et al. 2007; Tory et al. 2013; Moon et al. 2020) to better understand the trade-offs between improving detection ability in coarser models and potential false alarms. This would be particularly relevant for studies requiring lower resolutions, such as paleoclimate applications. Another potentially enticing use case would be to evaluate more novel artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms that can be trained against reanalyses to find storms in climate data without a rigorous, expert-derived heuristic.\n\nIt is important to highlight that, while more representative of TC activity in an integrated sense, ACE (or PACE) does not account for storm size, another important determinant in estimating TC damages (Czajkowski and Done 2014; Zhai and Jiang 2014). As models better develop the capability to discriminate storm size and wind fields (Chavas et al. 2017), it will be helpful to include threshold-integrated values such as those in Stansfield et al. (2020). A future extension could also include existing metrics that account for size of the wind field such as integrated kinetic energy (Powell and Reinhold 2007).\n\nWhile this suite is specific to TCs, many of the statistical techniques are extendable to other pointwise features. For example, one could apply these products to radar data (observations) and simulated mesoscale convective events for convective-permitting models (as in Prein et al. 2017). A control extratropical cyclone climatology could be defined by a long-preindustrial control run, and then individual model configurations or forcing scenarios could be evaluated objectively against that baseline. This framework could provide additional insights into quantifying differences associated with the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP; Shields et al. 2018). The primary challenges lie in defining a detection and tracking methodology that can be applied consistently and systematically across relevant datasets.\n\nLast, we highlight fruitful avenues for future application. An obvious use case would allow for stakeholders to make informed decisions about existing data products for their particular needs; if a dataset is composed of 15 models, it may be most beneficial for an end user interested in eastern U.S. summertime flooding to focus analysis efforts on the two or three products that produce the most credible TC climatology. Future work will apply this statistical analysis package to climate intercomparisons, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), or its high-resolution subproject, the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP). As more advanced development takes place with next-generation ESMs, we envision this type of assessment will provide significant utility in objectively evaluating model design choices on simulated extreme weather phenomenon and offering identifiable pathways for further improving models used to understand and predict the climate system.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research program under Award DE-SC0016605 “A framework for improving analysis and modeling of Earth system and intersectoral dynamics at regional scales.” Additional funding for authors Zarzycki and Ullrich was provided under NASA Award NNX16AG62G “TempestExtremes: Indicators of change in the characteristics of extreme weather,” and additional funding for author Reed was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research program under Award Number DE-SC0019459.

Candidate TCs are first detected at 6-h time intervals by ensuring that a SLP minimum is surrounded by a closed contour of SLP 2 hPa greater than the minimum within 5.5°. This is defined as the TC center. A geopotential height thickness maximum between the 300- and 500-hPa levels is used as a thermal criterion to eliminate non-warm-core storms. This maximum must be spatially aligned with the SLP minimum (no more than 1° offset in the horizontal plane) and be enclosed by a closed ring of thickness that is 6 m less than the maximum. This closed contour must fully lie within 6.5° of the thickness maximum. Candidates that are found within 6° of one another are merged, with candidate of lower SLP taking priority. Cyclones are then stitched together in time, with storms needing to be equatorward of 50° latitude for at least 60 h (not necessarily consecutive). Storm translational speed is restricted to 40 m s−1, and separate trajectories that terminate and begin within 12 h and 10° of one another are merged to eliminate double counting of broken tracks.\n\nAll variables are reported as instantaneous at standard synoptic reporting times (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC). The u10 is either directly reported as a model output or is corrected to 10 m from winds at the lowest model level (typically between 40 and 70 m) using a logarithmic profile (Garratt 1992; Wieringa 1992), which has been shown to be a valid approximation in both observational studies (Franklin et al. 2003; Vickery et al. 2009) and high-resolution numerical simulations (Bryan et al. 2017).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAndreadis, K.
