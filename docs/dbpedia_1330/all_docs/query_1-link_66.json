The reporting of ADs in randomised trials is inconsistent and needs improving. Incompletely reported AD randomised trials are difficult to reproduce and are hard to interpret and synthesise. This consequently hampers their ability to inform practice as well as future research and contributes to research waste. Better transparency and adequate reporting will enable the potential benefits of ADs to be realised.\n\nThis extension to the Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement was developed to enhance the reporting of randomised AD clinical trials. We developed an Adaptive designs CONSORT Extension (ACE) guideline through a two-stage Delphi process with input from multidisciplinary key stakeholders in clinical trials research in the public and private sectors from 21 countries, followed by a consensus meeting. Members of the CONSORT Group were involved during the development process.\n\nThe paper presents the ACE checklists for AD randomised trial reports and abstracts, as well as an explanation with examples to aid the application of the guideline. The ACE checklist comprises seven new items, nine modified items, six unchanged items for which additional explanatory text clarifies further considerations for ADs, and 20 unchanged items not requiring further explanatory text. The ACE abstract checklist has one new item, one modified item, one unchanged item with additional explanatory text for ADs, and 15 unchanged items not requiring further explanatory text.\n\nThe intention is to enhance transparency and improve reporting of AD randomised trials to improve the interpretability of their results and reproducibility of their methods, results and inference. We also hope indirectly to facilitate the much-needed knowledge transfer of innovative trial designs to maximise their potential benefits.\n\n“To maximise the benefit to society, you need to not just do research but do it well” Douglas G Altman\n\nPurpose of the paper\n\nIncomplete and poor reporting of randomised clinical trials makes trial findings difficult to interpret due to study methods, results, and inference that are not reproducible. This severely undermines the value of scientific research, obstructs robust evidence synthesis to inform practice and future research, and contributes to research waste.12 The Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement is a consensus-based reporting guidance framework that aims to promote and enhance transparent and adequate reporting of randomised trials.34 Specific CONSORT extensions addressing the reporting needs for particular trial designs, hypotheses, and interventions have been developed.5 The use of reporting guidelines is associated with improved completeness in study reporting678; however, mechanisms to improve adherence to reporting guidelines are needed.9101112\n\nWe developed an Adaptive designs CONSORT Extension (ACE)13 to the CONSORT 2010 statement34 to support reporting of randomised trials that use an adaptive design (AD)—referred to as AD randomised trials. In this paper, we define an AD and summarise some types of ADs as well as their use and reporting. We then describe briefly how the ACE guideline was developed, and present its scope and underlying principles. Finally, we present the ACE checklist with explanation and elaboration (E&E) to guide its use.\n\nAdaptive designs: definition, current use, and reporting\n\nThe ACE Steering Committee13 agreed a definition of an AD (box 1) consistent with the literature.1415161718\n\nBox 1\n\nDefinition of an adaptive design (AD)\n\nA clinical trial design that offers pre-planned opportunities to use accumulating trial data to modify aspects of an ongoing trial while preserving the validity and integrity of that trial.\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSubstantial uncertainties often exist when designing trials around aspects such as the target population, outcome variability, optimal treatments for testing, treatment duration, treatment intensity, outcomes to measure, and measures of treatment effect.19 Well designed and conducted AD trials allow researchers to address research questions more efficiently by allowing key aspects or assumptions of ongoing trials to be evaluated or validly stopping treatment arms or entire trials on the basis of available evidence.15182021 As a result, patients may receive safe, effective treatments sooner than with fixed (non-adaptive) designs.1922232425 Despite their potential benefits, there are practical challenges and obstacles to the use of ADs.182627282930313233\n\nThe literature on ADs is considerable, and there is specific terminology associated with the field. Box 2 gives a glossary of key terminology used throughout this E&E document.\n\nBox 2\n\nDefinitions of key technical terms\n\nValidity—The ability to provide correct statistical inference to establish effects of study interventions and produce accurate estimates of effects (point estimates and uncertainty), to give results that are convincing to the broader audience (science community and consumers of research findings).\n\nIntegrity—Relates to minimisation of operational bias, maintenance of data confidentiality, and ensuring consistency in trial conduct (before and after adaptations) for credibility, interpretability, and persuasiveness of trial results.\n\nPre-planned adaptations or adaptive features—Pre-planned or prespecified changes or modifications to be made to aspects of an ongoing trial, which are specified at the design stage or at least before seeing accumulating trial data by treatment group, and are documented for audit trail (such as in the protocol).\n\nUnplanned changes—Ad hoc modifications to aspects of an ongoing trial.\n\nType of AD—The main category used to classify a trial design by its pre-planned adaptive features or adaptations. Some ADs can fall into more than one main category of trial adaptation (see table 1).\n\nAdaptive decision-making criteria—Elements of decision-making rules describing whether, how, and when the proposed trial adaptations will be used during the trial. It involves pre-specifying a set of actions guiding how decisions about implementing the trial adaptations are made given interim observed data (decision rules). It also involves pre-specifying limits or parameters to trigger trial adaptations (decision boundaries). For example, stopping boundaries that relate to pre-specified limits regarding decisions to stop the trial or treatment arm(s) early.\n\nInterim analysis—A statistical analysis or review of accumulating data from an ongoing trial (interim data) to inform trial adaptations (before the final analysis), which may or may not involve treatment group comparisons.\n\nBinding rules—Decision rules that must be adhered to for the design to control the false positive error rate.\n\nNon-binding rules—Optional decision rules that can be overruled without negative effects on control of the false positive error rate.\n\nStatistical properties or operating characteristics—Relates to behaviour of the trial design. These may include statistical power, false positive error rate, bias in estimation of treatment effect(s), or probability of each adaptation taking place.\n\nSimulation—A computational procedure performed using a computer program to evaluate statistical properties of the design by generating pseudo data according to the design, under a number of scenarios and repeated a large number of times.\n\nFixed (non-adaptive) design—A clinical trial that is designed with an expected fixed sample size without any scope for pre-planned changes (adaptations) of any study design feature.\n\nBias—The systematic tendency for the treatment effect estimates to deviate from their “true values”; including the statistical properties (such as error rates) to deviate from what is expected in theory (such as pre-specified nominal error rate).\n\nOperational bias—Occurs when knowledge of key trial-related information influences changes to the conduct of that trial in a manner that biases the conclusions made regarding the benefits and/or harms of study treatments.\n\nStatistical bias—Bias introduced to the study results or conclusions by the design: for example, as a result of changes to aspects of the trial or multiple analyses of accumulating data from an ongoing trial.\n\nSubpopulation(s)—Subset(s) of the trial population that can be classified by characteristics of participants that are thought to be associated with treatment response (such as genetic markers or biomarkers).\n\nAdaptation outcome(s)—Outcome(s) used to guide trial adaptation(s); they may be different from the primary outcome(s).\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nTable 1 summarises some types of ADs and cites examples of their use in randomised trials. The motivations for these trial adaptations are well discussed.1518212225343536 Notably, classification of ADs in the literature is inconsistent,1322 while the scope and complexity of trial adaptations and underpinning statistical methods continues to broaden.182037\n\nView this table:\n\nFurthermore, there is growing literature citing AD methods2982107 and interest in their application by researchers and research funders.2628108 Regulators have published reflection and guidance papers on ADs.14108109110111 Several studies, including regulatory reviews, have investigated the use of ADs in randomised trials.272931334149101107108112113114115116117118119 In summary, ADs are used in a relatively low proportion of trials, although their use is steadily increasing in both the public and private sectors,114115116 and they are frequently considered at the design stage.27\n\nThe use of ADs is likely to be underestimated due to poor reporting making it difficult to retrieve them in the literature.114 While the reporting of standard CONSORT requirements of AD randomised trials is generally comparable to that of traditional fixed design trials,49 inadequate and inconsistent reporting of essential aspects relating to ADs is widely documented.262749107112113120121122 This may limit their credibility, the interpretability of results, and their ability to inform or change practice,142627283031108109112119120 whereas transparency and adequate reporting can help address these concerns.2227 In summary, statistical and non-statistical issues arise in ADs,2236101108123124125126127 which require special reporting considerations.13\n\nSummary of how the ACE guideline was developed\n\nWe adhered to a registered protocol128 and the consensus-driven methodological framework for developing healthcare reporting guidelines recommended by the CONSORT Group and the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network.129 An open access paper detailing the rationale and the complete development process of the ACE checklist for main reports and abstracts has been published.13 That paper details how reporting items were identified, the stakeholders who were involved, the decision-making process, consensus judgement and how reporting items were retained or dropped, and finalisation of the ACE checklist. In summary, this comprised a two-stage Delphi process involving cross-sector (public and private) and multidisciplinary key stakeholders in clinical trials research from 21 countries. Delphi survey response rates were 94/143 (66%), 114/156 (73%), and 79/143 (55%) in round one, round two, and across both rounds, respectively. A consensus meeting attended by 27 cross-sector delegates from Europe, Asia, and the US followed this. Members of the CONSORT Group provided oversight throughout. The ACE Consensus Group and Steering Committee approved the final checklist that included the abstract and contributed to this E&E document. Box 3 outlines the scope of principles guiding the application of this extension.\n\nBox 3\n\nACE guideline scope and general principles\n\nIt applies to all randomised clinical trials using an adaptive design (AD), as defined in box 1.\n\nIt excludes randomised clinical trials that change aspects of an ongoing trial based entirely on external information130 or with internal pilots focusing solely on feasibility and processes (such as recruitment, intervention delivery, and data completeness).131\n\nIt covers general reporting principles to make it applicable to a wide range of current and future ADs and trial adaptations.\n\nIt is not intended to promote or discourage the use of any specific type of AD, trial adaptation, or frequentist or Bayesian statistical methods. These choices should be driven by the scientific research questions, the goals behind the use of the proposed AD features, and practical considerations.22\n\nIt aims to promote transparent and adequate reporting of AD randomised trials to maximise their potential benefits and improve the interpretability of their results and their reproducibility, without impeding their appropriate use or stifling design innovation. Therefore, the guideline does not specifically address the appropriateness of adaptive statistical methods.\n\nIt presents the minimum requirements that should be reported but we also encourage authors to report additional information that may enhance the interpretation of trial findings.\n\nAccess to information is most important regardless of the source and form of publication. For example, use of appendices and citation of accessible material (such as protocols, statistical analysis plans (SAPs), or related publications) is often sufficient.\n\nThe order in which researchers report information does not necessarily need to follow the order of the checklist.\n\nThe guideline does not primarily address specific reporting needs for non-randomised ADs (such as phase I dose escalation studies, phase II single-arm designs). However, some principles covered here may still apply to such trials.\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nStructure of the ACE guideline\n\nAuthors should apply this guideline together with the CONSORT 2010 statement34 and any other relevant extensions depending on other design features of their AD randomised trial (such as extensions for multi-arm,132 cluster randomised,133 crossover,134 and non-inferiority and equivalence trials135). Box 4 summarises the changes made to develop this extension. Table 2 shows which CONSORT 2010 items were adapted and how. We provide both CONSORT 2010 and ACE items with comments, explanation, and examples to illustrate how specific aspects of different types of AD randomised trials should be reported. For the examples, we obtained some additional information from researchers or other trial documents (such as statistical analysis plans (SAPs) and protocols). Headings of examples indicate the type of AD and the specific elements of an item that were better reported, so examples may include some incomplete reporting in relation to other elements.\n\nBox 4\n\nSummary of significant changes to the CONSORT 2010 statement\n\nNew items—Introduces seven new items that are specific to AD randomised trials\n\n3b on pre-planned AD features,\n\n11c on confidentiality and minimisation of operational bias,\n\n12b on estimation and inference methods,\n\n14c on adaptation decisions,\n\n15b on similarity between stages,\n\n17c on interim results and,\n\n24b on SAP and other relevant trial documents.\n\nRestructuring—Renumbers four standard items to accommodate the new items\n\n3b is now 3c (on losses and exclusions) to accommodate the new item 3b,\n\n12b is now 12c (on methods for additional analyses) to accommodate the new item 12b,\n\n15 on baseline demographics and clinical characteristics is now 15a to accommodate new item 15b and,\n\n24 on access to protocol is now 24a to accommodate new item 24b.\n\nModified items—Modifies nine standard items\n\n3b (now 3c) on important changes to the design or methods after commencement,\n\n6a on pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes,\n\n6b on changes to trial outcomes after commencement,\n\n7a on sample size,\n\n7b on interim analyses and stopping rules, which is now a replacement capturing adaptive decision-making criteria to guide adaptation(s),\n\n8b on type of randomisation,\n\n12a on statistical methods to compare groups,\n\n13a on participants randomised, treated, and analysed,\n\n14a on dates for recruitment and follow-up.\n\nExpanded text—Expands the E&E text for clarification on six items without changes to item wording\n\n14b on why the trial ended or was stopped,\n\n15 (now 15a) on baseline demographics and clinical characteristics,\n\n16 on numbers randomised,\n\n17a on primary and secondary outcome results,\n\n20 on limitations and,\n\n21 on generalisability.\n\nRestructuring—Renames two subsection headings to reflect new ACE content\n\n“recruitment” renamed to “recruitment and adaptations”\n\n“sample size” renamed to “sample size and operating characteristics”\n\nRestructuring—Introduces a new subsection heading\n\n“Statistical analysis plan and other trial-related documents” to accommodate item 24b\n\nModifies abstract item 1b and introduces an extension for journal and conference abstracts\n\nNew item—Introduces one new item (on adaptation decisions made)\n\nOn “adaptation decisions made”\n\nModified item—Modifies one standard item\n\nOn “trial design”\n\nExpanded text—Expands the E&E text for clarification on one item for certain ADs in particular circumstances without changes to item wording\n\nOn “outcome”\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nView this table:\n\nThe ACE checklist\n\nTables 2 and 3 are checklists for the main report and abstract, respectively. Only new and modified items are discussed in this E&E document, as well as six items that retain the CONSORT 201034 wording but require clarification for certain ADs (box 4). Authors should download and complete appendix A to accompany a manuscript during journal submission.\n\nView this table:\n\nSection 1. Title and abstract\n\nCONSORT 2010 item 1b: Structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions (for specific guidance see CONSORT for abstracts136137)\n\nACE item 1b: Structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions (for specific guidance see ACE for abstracts, table 3)\n\nExplanation—A well structured abstract summary encompassing trial design, methods, results, and conclusions is essential regardless of the type of design implemented.137 This allows readers to search for relevant studies of interest and to quickly judge if the reported trial is relevant to them for further reading. Furthermore, it helps readers to make instant judgements on key benefits and risks of study interventions. Table 3 presents minimum essential items authors should report in an AD randomised trial abstract. Authors should use this extension together with the CONSORT for journal and conference abstracts for additional details136137 and other relevant extensions where appropriate.\n\nCONSORT abstract item (Trial design): Description of the trial design (for example, parallel, cluster, non-inferiority)\n\nACE abstract item (Trial design): Description of the trial design (for example, parallel, cluster, non-inferiority); include the word “adaptive” in the content or at least as a keyword\n\nExplanation—AD randomised trials should be indexed properly to allow other researchers to easily retrieve them in literature searches. This is particularly important as trial design may influence interpretation of trial findings and the evidence synthesis approach used during meta-analyses. The MEDLINE database provides “Adaptive clinical trial” as a Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) topic to improve indexing.139 Authors may also like to state the type of the AD, including details of adaptations as covered under the new item 3b (table 3). See box 5 for exemplars.\n\nBox 5\n\nExemplars on the use of “adaptive” in the abstract content and/or as a keyword\n\nExample 1. Abstract (title)\n\n“Safety and efficacy of neublastin in painful lumbosacral radiculopathy: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial using Bayesian adaptive design (the SPRINT trial).”140\n\nExample 2. Abstract (background)\n\n“The drug development process can be streamlined by combining the traditionally separate stages of dose-finding (Phase IIb) and confirmation of efficacy and safety (Phase III) using an adaptive seamless design.”141\n\nExample 3. Abstract (aims) and keyword\n\n“AWARD-5 was an adaptive, seamless, double-blind study comparing dulaglutide, a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, with placebo at 26 weeks and sitagliptin up to 104 weeks.” and keyword “Bayesian adaptive”97\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nCONSORT/ACE abstract item (Outcome): Clearly defined primary outcome for this report\n\nExplanation—In some AD randomised trials, the outcome used to inform adaptations (adaptation outcome) and the primary outcome of the study can differ (see item 6 of the main checklist for details). The necessity of reporting both of these outcomes and results in the abstract depends on the stage of reporting and whether the adaptation decisions made were critical to influencing the interpretation of the final results. For example, when a trial or at least a treatment group is stopped early, based on an adaptation outcome which is not the primary outcome, it becomes essential to adequately describe both outcomes in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement.34 Contrarily, only the description of the primary outcome in the abstract will be essential when non-terminal adaptation decisions are made (such as to change the sample size, update randomisation, or no dropping of treatments groups at interims) and when final (not interim) results are being reported. Furthermore, the results item (table 3) should be reported consistent with the stated primary and adaptation outcome(s), where necessary. See box 6 for exemplars.\n\nBox 6\n\nExemplars on reporting outcomes in the abstract\n\nExample 1. Bayesian RAR dose finding AD with early stopping for efficacy or futility\n\n“The primary outcome required, first, a greater than 90% posterior probability that the most promising levocarnitine dose decreases the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 48 hours and, second (given having met the first condition), at least a 30% predictive probability of success in reducing 28-day mortality in a subsequent traditional superiority trial to test efficacy.”142\n\nExample 2. Sequential-step AD\n\n“The primary efficacy endpoint was definitive cure (absence of parasites in tissue aspirates) at 6 months. If interim analyses, based on initial cure evaluated 30 days after the start of treatment…”143\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nACE abstract item (adaptation decisions made): Specify what trial adaptation decisions were made in light of the pre-planned decision-making criteria and observed accrued data\n\nExplanation—A brief account of changes that were made to the trial, on what basis they were made, and when is important. The fact that the design allows for adaptations will influence interpretation of results, potentially due to operational and statistical biases. If changes should have been made, but were not, then this may further influence credibility of results. See the main checklist item 14c for details. See box 7 for exemplars.\n\nBox 7\n\nExemplars on reporting adaptation decisions made to the trial in the abstract\n\nExample 1. 2-stage inferential seamless phase 2/3 AD; pre-planned adaptation decisions\n\n“A planned interim analysis was conducted for otamixaban dose selection using a pre-specified algorithm (unknown to investigators) … The selected regimen to carry forward was an intravenous bolus of 0.080mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.140 mg/kg per hour.”144\n\nExample 2. Group sequential AD; early stopping decision\n\n“The trial was stopped early (at the third interim analysis), according to pre-specified rules, after a median follow-up of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed.”145\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSection 3: Methods (Trial design)\n\nACE item 3b (new): Type of adaptive design used, with details of the pre-planned adaptations and the statistical information informing the adaptations\n\nExplanation—A description of the type of AD indicates the underlying design concepts and the applicable adaptive statistical methods. Although there is an inconsistent use of nomenclature to classify ADs, together with growing related methodology,13 some currently used types of ADs are presented in table 1. A clear description will also improve the indexing of AD methods and for easy identification during literature reviews.\n\nSpecification of pre-planned opportunities for adaptations and their scope is essential to preserve the integrity of AD randomised trials22 and for regulatory assessments, regardless of whether they were triggered during the trial.14108109 Details of pre-planned adaptations enable readers to assess the appropriateness of statistical methods used to evaluate operating characteristics of the AD (item 7a) and for performing statistical inference (item 12b). Unfortunately, pre-planned adaptations are commonly insufficiently described.119 Authors are encouraged to explain the scientific rationale for choosing the considered pre-planned adaptations encapsulated under the CONSORT 2010 item “scientific background and explanation of rationale” (item 2a). This rationale should focus on the goals of the considered adaptations in line with the study objectives and hypotheses (item 2b).107108119123\n\nDetails of pre-planned adaptations with rationale should be documented in accessible study documents for readers to be able to evaluate what was planned and unplanned (such as protocol, interim and final SAP or dedicated trial document). Of note, any pre-planned adaptation that modifies eligibility criteria (such as in population enrichment ADs92146) should be clearly described.\n\nAdaptive trials use accrued statistical information to make pre-planned adaptation(s) (item 14c) at interim analyses guided by pre-planned decision-making criteria and rules (item 7b). Reporting this statistical information for guiding adaptations and how it is gathered is paramount. Analytical derivations of statistical information guiding pre-planned adaptations using statistical models or formulae should be described to facilitate reproducibility and interpretation of results. The use of supplementary material or references to published literature is sufficient. For example, sample size re-assessment (SSR) can be performed using different methods with or without knowledge or use of treatment arm allocation.41424448 Around 43% (15/35) of regulatory submissions needed further clarifications because of failure to describe how a SSR would be performed.119 Early stopping of a trial or treatment group for futility can be evaluated based on statistical information to support lack of evidence of benefit that is derived and expressed in several ways.

Pre-planned adaptations and rationale; inferentially seamless phase 2/3 AD\n\n“The adaptive (inferentially) seamless phase II/III design is a novel approach to drug development that combines phases II and III in a single, two-stage study. The design is adaptive in that the wider choice of doses included in stage 1 is narrowed down to the dose(s) of interest to be evaluated in stage 2. The trial is a seamless experience for both investigators and patients in that there is no interruption of ongoing study treatment between the two phases. Combining the dose-finding and confirmatory phases of development into a single, uninterrupted study has the advantages of speed, efficiency and flexibility1517… The primary aim of stage 1 of the study was to determine the risk-benefit of four doses of indacaterol (based on efficacy and safety results in a pre-planned interim analysis) in order to select two doses to carry forward into the second stage of the study.”141\n\nExample 2. Analytical derivation of statistical information to guide adaptations; population enrichment AD with SSR\n\nMehta et al99 detail formulae used to calculate the conditional power to guide modification of the sample size or to enrich the patient population at an interim analysis for both cutaneous and non-cutaneous patients (full population) and only cutaneous patients (subpopulation) in the supplementary material. In addition, the authors detail formulae used to derive associated conditional powers and p-values used for decision-making to claim evidence of benefit both at the interim and final analysis (linked to item 12b).\n\nExample 3. Pre-planned adaptations; 5-arm 2-stage AD allowing for regimen selection, early stopping for futility and SSR\n\n“This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 trial had a two-stage adaptive design, with selection of the propranolol regimen (dose and duration) at the end of stage 1 (interim analysis) and further evaluation of the selected regimen in stage 2.6768 Pre-specified possible adaptations to be made after the interim analysis, as outlined in the protocol and statistical analysis plan (accessible via journal website), were selection of one or two regimens, sample-size reassessment, and non-binding stopping for futility.”98\n\nExample 4. Type of AD; pre-planned adaptations and rationale; Bayesian adaptive-enrichment AD allowing for enrichment and early stopping for futility or efficacy\n\n“The DAWN trial was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial with a Bayesian adaptive–enrichment design and with blinded assessment of endpoints.12 The adaptive trial design allowed for a sample size ranging from 150 to 500 patients. During interim analyses, the decision to stop or continue enrolment was based on a pre-specified calculation of the probability that thrombectomy plus standard care would be superior to standard care alone with respect to the first primary endpoint (described in the paper). The enrichment trial design gave us the flexibility to identify whether the benefit of the trial intervention was restricted to a subgroup of patients with relatively small infarct volumes at baseline. The interim analyses, which included patients with available follow-up data at the time of the analysis, were pre-specified to test for the futility, enrichment, and success of the trial.”100 See supplementary appendix via journal website (from page 39) for details.\n\nExample 5. Rationale; type of AD and pre-planned adaptations; information to inform adaptations; information-based GSD\n\n“Because little was known about the variability of LVMI changes in CKD during the planning stage, we prospectively implemented an information-based (group sequential) adaptive design that allowed sample size re-estimation when 50% of the data were collected.50156”157 Pritchett et al50 provide details of the pre-planned adaptations and statistical information used to inform SSR and efficacy early stopping.\n\nExample 6. Pre-planned adaptation and information for SSR\n\n“To reassess the sample size estimate, the protocol specified that a treatment-blinded interim assessment of the standard deviation (SD) about the primary endpoint (change from baseline in total exercise treadmill test duration at trough) would be performed when 231 or one half of the planned completed study patients had been randomized and followed up for 12 weeks. The recalculation of sample size, using only blinded data, was adjusted based on the estimated SD of the primary efficacy parameter (exercise duration at trough) from the aggregate data…158159160”38\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nCONSORT 2010 item 3b: Important changes to the design or methods after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons\n\nACE item 3c (modification, renumbered): Important changes to the design or methods after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria) outside the scope of the pre-planned adaptive design features, with reasons\n\nExplanation—Unplanned changes to certain aspects of the design or methods in response to unexpected circumstances that occur during the trial are common and will need to be reported in AD randomised trials, as in fixed design trials. This may include deviations from pre-planned adaptations and decision rules,1570 as well as changes to timing and frequency of interim analyses. Traditionally, unplanned changes with explanation have been documented as protocol amendments and reported as discussed in the CONSORT 2010 statement.34 Unplanned changes, depending on what they are and why they were made, may introduce bias and compromise trial credibility. Some unplanned changes may render the planned adaptive statistical methods invalid or may complicate interpretation of results.22 It is therefore essential for authors to detail important changes that occurred outside the scope of the pre-planned adaptations and to explain why deviations from the planned adaptations were necessary. Furthermore, it should be clarified whether unplanned changes were made following access to key trial information such as interim data seen by treatment group or interim results. Such information will help readers assess potential sources of bias and implications for the interpretation of results. For ADs, it is essential to distinguish unplanned changes from pre-planned adaptations (item 3b).161 See box 9 for an exemplar.\n\nBox 9\n\nExemplar on reporting item 3c elements\n\nExample. Inferentially seamless phase 2/3 (5-arm 2-stage) AD allowing for regimen selection, SSR and futility early stopping\n\nAlthough this should ideally have been referenced in the main report, Léauté-Labrèze et al98 (on pages 17-18 of supplementary material) summarise important changes to the trial design including an explanation and discussion of implications. These changes include a reduction in the number of patients assigned to the placebo across stages—randomisation was changed from 1:1:1:1:1 to 2:2:2:2:1 (each of the 4 propranolol regimens: placebo) for stage 1 and from 1:1 to 2:1 for stage 2 in favour of the selected regimen; revised complete or nearly complete resolution success rates for certain treatment regimens. As a result, total sample size was revised to 450 (excluding possible SSR); and a slight increase in the number of patients (from 175 to 180) to be recruited for the interim analysis.\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSection 6. Outcomes\n\nCONSORT 2010 item 6a: Completely define pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed\n\nACE item 6a (modification): Completely define pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed. Any other outcome measures used to inform pre-planned adaptations should be described with the rationale\n\nComment—Authors should also refer to the CONSORT 2010 statement34 for the original text when applying this item.\n\nExplanation—It is paramount to provide a detailed description of pre-specified outcomes used to assess clinical objectives including how and when they were assessed. For operational feasibility, ADs often use outcomes that can be observed quickly and easily to inform pre-planned adaptations (adaptation outcomes). Thus, in some situations, adaptations may be based on early observed outcome(s)162 that are believed to be informative for the primary outcome even though different from the primary outcome. The adaptation outcome (such as a surrogate, biomarker, or an intermediate outcome) together with the primary outcome influences the adaptation process, operating characteristics of the AD, and interpretation and trustworthiness of trial results. Despite many potential advantages of using early observed outcomes to adapt a trial, they pose additional risks of making misleading inferences if they are unreliable.163 For example, a potentially beneficial treatment could be wrongly discarded, an ineffective treatment incorrectly declared effective or wrongly carried forward for further testing, or the randomisation updated based on unreliable information.\n\nAuthors should therefore clearly describe adaptation outcomes similar to the description of pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes in the CONSORT 2010 statement.34 Authors are encouraged to provide a clinical rationale supporting the use of an adaptation outcome that is different to the primary outcome in order to aid the clinical interpretation of results. For example, evidence supporting that the adaptation outcome can provide reliable information on the primary outcome will suffice. See box 10 for exemplars.\n\nBox 10\n\nExemplars on reporting item 6a elements\n\nExample 1. SSR; description of the adaptation and primary outcomes\n\n“The primary endpoint is a composite of survival free of debilitating stroke (modified Rankin score >3) or the need for a pump exchange. The short-term endpoint will be assessed at 6 months and the long-term endpoint at 24 months (primary). Patients who are urgently transplanted due to a device complication before a pre-specified endpoint will be considered study failures. All other transplants or device explants due to myocardial recovery that occur before a pre-specified endpoint will be considered study successes ... The adaptation was based on interim short-term outcome rates.”164\n\nExample 2. Seamless phase 2/3 Bayesian AD with treatment selection; details of adaptation outcomes\n\n“Four efficacy and safety measures were considered important for dose selection based on early phase dulaglutide data: HbA1c, weight, pulse rate and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).165 These measures were used to define criteria for dose selection. The selected dulaglutide dose(s) had to have a mean change of ≤+5 beats per minute (bpm) for PR and ≤+2 mmHg for DBP relative to placebo at 26 weeks. In addition, if a dose was weight neutral versus placebo, it had to show HbA1c reduction ≥1.0% and/or be superior to sitagliptin at 52 weeks. If a dose reduced weight relative to placebo ≥2.5 kg, then non-inferiority to sitagliptin would be acceptable. A clinical utility index was incorporated in the algorithm to facilitate adaptive randomization and dose selection154166 based on the same parameters used to define dose-selection criteria described above (not shown here).”97\n\nExample 3. Seamless phase 2/3 AD with treatment selection; details of adaptation outcomes\n\n“For the dose selection, the joint primary efficacy outcomes were the trough FEV1 on Day 15 (mean of measurements at 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min after the morning dose on Day 14) and standardized (average) FEV1 area under the curve (AUC) between 1 and 4 h after the morning dose on Day 14 (FEV1AUC1–4h), for the treatment comparisons detailed below (not shown here).”141\n\nExample 4. MAMS AD; adaptation rationale (part of item 3b); rationale for adaption outcome different from the primary outcome; description of the adaptation and primary outcomes\n\n“This seamless phase 2/3 design starts with several trial arms and uses an intermediate outcome to adaptively focus accrual away from the less encouraging research arms, continuing accrual only with the more active interventions. The definitive primary outcome of the STAMPEDE trial is overall survival (defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause). The intermediate primary outcome is failure-free survival (FFS) defined as the first of: PSA failure (PSA >4 ng/mL and PSA >50% above nadir); local progression; nodal progression; progression of existing metastases or development of new metastases; or death from prostate cancer. FFS is used as a screening method for activity on the assumption that any treatment that shows an advantage in overall survival will probably show an advantage in FFS beforehand, and that a survival advantage is unlikely if an advantage in FFS is not seen. Therefore, FFS can be used to triage treatments that are unlikely to be of sufficient benefit. It is not assumed that FFS is a surrogate for overall survival; an advantage in FFS might not necessarily translate into a survival advantage.”167\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nCONSORT 2010 item 6b: Any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons\n\nACE item 6b (modification): Any unplanned changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons\n\nComment—Authors may wish to cross-reference the CONSORT 2010 statement34 for background details.\n\nExplanation—Outcome reporting bias occurs when the selection of outcomes to report is influenced by the nature and direction of results. The prevalence of outcome reporting bias in medical research is well documented: discrepancies between pre-specified outcomes in protocols or registries and those published in reports12168169170171; outcomes that portray favourable beneficial effects of treatments and safety profiles being more likely to be reported169; some pre-specified primary or secondary outcomes modified or switched after trial commencement.170 Changes to trial outcomes may also include changes to how outcomes were assessed or measured, when they were assessed, or the order of importance to address objectives.171\n\nSometimes when planning trials, there is huge uncertainty around the magnitude of treatment effects on potential outcomes viewed acceptable as primary endpoints.36171 As a result, although uncommon, a pre-planned adaptation could include the choice of the primary endpoints or hypotheses for assessing the benefit-risk ratio. In such circumstances, the adaptive strategy should be clearly described as a pre-planned adaptation (item 3b). Authors should clearly report any additional changes to outcomes outside the scope of the pre-specified adaptations including an explanation of why such changes occurred in line with the CONSORT 2010 statement. This will enable readers to distinguish pre-planned trial adaptations of outcomes from unplanned changes, thereby allowing them to judge outcome reporting bias.

Bayesian adaptive-enrichment AD; unplanned change from a secondary to a co-primary outcome, rationale, and when it happened\n\n“The second primary endpoint was the rate of functional independence (defined as a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the modified Rankin scale) at 90 days. This endpoint was changed from a secondary endpoint to a co-primary endpoint at the request of the Food and Drug Administration at 30 months after the start of the trial, when the trial was still blinded.”100\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSection 7. Sample size and operating characteristics\n\nCONSORT 2010 item 7a: How sample size was determined\n\nACE item 7a (modification): How sample size and operating characteristics were determined\n\nComments—This section heading was modified to reflect additional operating characteristics that may be required for some ADs in addition to the sample size. Items 3b, 7a, 7b, and 12b are connected so they should be cross-referenced when reporting.\n\nExplanation—Operating characteristics, which relate to the statistical behaviour of a design, should be tailored to address trial objectives and hypotheses, factoring in logistical, ethical, and clinical considerations. These may encompass the maximum sample size, expected sample sizes under certain scenarios, probabilities of identifying beneficial treatments if they exist, and probabilities of making false positive claims of evidence.172173 Specifically, the predetermined sample size for ADs is influenced, among other things, by:\n\nType and scope of adaptations considered (item 3b);\n\nDecision-making criteria used to inform adaptations (item 7b);\n\nCriteria for claiming overall evidence (such as based on the probability of the treatment effect being above a certain value, targeted treatment effect of interest, and threshold for statistical significance174175);\n\nTiming and frequency of the adaptations (item 7b);\n\nType of primary outcome(s) (item 6a) and nuisance parameters (such as outcome variance);\n\nMethod for claiming evidence on multiple key hypotheses (part of item 12b);\n\nDesired operating characteristics (see box 2), such as statistical power and an acceptable level of making a false positive claim of benefit;\n\nAdaptive statistical methods used for analysis (item 12b);\n\nStatistical framework (frequentist or Bayesian) used to design and analyse the trial.\n\nInformation that guided estimation of sample size(s), including operating characteristics of the considered AD, should be described sufficiently to enable readers to reproduce the sample size calculation. The assumptions made concerning design parameters should be clearly stated and supported with evidence if possible. Any constraints imposed (for example, due to limited trial population) should be stated. It is good scientific practice to reference the statistical tools used (such as statistical software, program, or code) and to describe the use of statistical simulations when relevant (see item 24b discussion).\n\nIn a situation where changing the sample size is a pre-planned adaptation (item 3b), authors should report the initial sample sizes (at interim analyses before the expected change in sample size) and the maximum allowable sample size per group and in total if applicable. The planned sample sizes (or expected numbers of events for time-to-event data) at each interim analysis and final analysis should be reported by treatment group and overall. The timing of interim analyses can be specified as a fraction of information gathered rather than sample size. See box 12 for exemplars.\n\nBox 12\n\nExemplars on reporting item 7a elements\n\nExample 1. MAMS AD; assumptions and adaptive methods; approach for claiming evidence or informing adaptations; statistical program\n\n“The primary response (outcome) from each patient is the difference between the baseline HOMA-IR score and their HOMA-IR score at 24 weeks. The sample size calculation is based on a one-sided type I error of 5% and a power of 90%. If there is no difference between the mean response on any treatment and that on control, then a probability of 0.05 is set for the risk of erroneously ending the study with a recommendation that any treatment be tested further. For the power, we adopt a generalisation of this power requirement to multiple active treatments due to Dunnett.176 Effect sizes are specified as the percentage chance of a patient on active treatment achieving a greater reduction in HOMA-IR score than a patient on control as this specification does not require knowledge of the common SD, σ. The requirement is that, if a patient on the best active dose has a 65% chance of a better response than a patient on control, while patients on the other two active treatments have a 55% chance of showing a better response than a patient on control, then the best active dose should be recommended for further testing with 90% probability. A 55% chance of achieving a better response on active dose relative to control corresponds to a reduction in mean HOMA-IR score of about a sixth of an SD (0.178σ), while the clinically relevant effect of 65% corresponds to a reduction of about half an SD (0.545σ). The critical values for recommending that a treatment is taken to further testing at the interim and final analyses (2.782 and 2.086) have been chosen to guarantee these properties using a method described by Magirr et al,177 generalising the approach of Whitehead and Jaki.178 The maximum sample size of this study is 336 evaluable patients (84 per arm), although the use of the interim analysis may change the required sample size. The study will recruit additional patients to account for an anticipated 10% dropout rate (giving a total sample size of 370). An interim analysis will take place once the primary endpoint is available for at least 42 patients on each arm (i.e., total of 168, half of the planned maximum of 336 patients). Sample size calculation was performed using the MAMS package in R179.”57\n\nExample 2. 3-arm 2-stage AD with dose selection; group sequential approach; assumptions; adaptation decision-making criteria; stage 1 and 2 sample sizes; use of simulations\n\n“Sample size calculations are based on the primary efficacy variable (composite of all-cause death or new MI through day 7), with the following assumptions: an event rate in the control group of 5.0%, based on event rates from the phase II study (24); a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 25%; a binomial 1-sided (α=0.025) superiority test for the comparison of 2 proportions with 88% power; and a 2-stage adaptive design with one interim analysis at the end of stage 1 data (35% information fraction) to select 1 otamixaban dose for continuation of the study at stage 2. Selection of the dose for continuation was based on the composite end point of all-cause death, Myocardial Infarction (MI), thrombotic complication, and the composite of Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding through day 7, with an assumed probability for selecting the “best” dose according to the primary endpoint (r=0.6), a group sequential approach with futility boundary of relative risk of otamixaban versus UFH plus eptifibatide ≥1.0, and efficacy boundary based on agamma (−10) α spending function.180 Based on the above assumptions, simulations (part of item 24b, see supplementary material) showed that 13 220 patients (a total of 5625 per group for the 2 remaining arms for the final analysis) are needed for this study.”181 See figure 1.\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nCONSORT 2010 item 7b: When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines\n\nACE item 7b (replacement): Pre-planned interim decision-making criteria to guide the trial adaptation process; whether decision-making criteria were binding or non-binding; pre-planned and actual timing and frequency of interim data looks to inform trial adaptations\n\nComments—This item is a replacement so when reporting, the CONSORT 20103 item 7b content should be ignored. Items 7b and 8b overlap, but we intentionally reserved item 8b specifically to enhance complete reporting of ADs with randomisation updates as a pre-planned adaptation. Reporting of these items is also connected to items 3b and 12b.\n\nExplanation—Transparency and complete reporting of pre-planned decision-making criteria (box 2) and how overall evidence is claimed are essential as they influence operating characteristics of the AD, credibility of the trial, and clinical interpretation of findings.2232182\n\nA key feature of an AD is that interim decisions about the course of the trial are informed by observed interim data (element of item 3b) at one or more interim analyses guided by decision rules describing how and when the proposed adaptations will be activated (pre-planned adaptive decision-making criteria). Decision rules, as defined in box 2, may include, but are not limited to, rules for making adaptations described in table 1. Decision rules are often constructed with input of key stakeholders (such as clinical investigators, statisticians, patient groups, health economists, and regulators).183 For example, statistical methods for formulating early stopping decision rules of a trial or treatment group(s) exist.5152184185186187\n\nDecision boundaries (for example, stopping boundaries), pre-specified limits or parameters used to determine adaptations to be made, and criteria for claiming overall evidence of benefit and/or harm (at an interim or final analysis) should be clearly stated. These are influenced by statistical information used to inform adaptations (item 3b). Decision trees or algorithms can aid the representation of complex adaptive decision-making criteria.\n\nAllowing for trial adaptations too early in a trial with inadequate information severely undermines robustness of adaptive decision-making criteria and trustworthiness of trial results.188189 Furthermore, methods and results can only be reproducible when timing and frequency of interim analyses are adequately described. Therefore, authors should detail when and how often the interim analyses were planned to be implemented. The planned timing can be described in terms of information such as interim sample size or number of events relative to the maximum sample size or maximum number of events, respectively. For example, in circumstances when the pre-planned and actual timing or/and frequency of the interim analyses differ, reports should clearly state what actually happened (item 3c).\n\nClarification should be made on whether decision rules were binding or non-binding to help assess implications in the case when they were overruled or ignored. For example, when a binding futility boundary is overruled and a trial is continued, this would lead to a type I error inflation. Non-binding decision rules are those that can be overruled without having a negative effect on the control of the type I error rate. Use of non-binding futility boundaries is often advised.55 See box 13 for exemplars.\n\nBox 13\n\nExemplars on reporting item 7b elements\n\nExample 1. 2-arm 2-stage AD with options for early stopping for futility or superiority and to increase the sample size; binding stopping rules\n\n“To calculate the number of patients needed to meet the primary endpoint, we expected a 3-year overall survival rate of 25% in the group assigned to preoperative chemotherapy (arm A) (based on two previous trials190191). In comparison, an increase of 10% (up to 35%) was anticipated by preoperative CRT. Using the log-rank test (one-sided at this point) at a significance level of 5%, we calculated to include 197 patients per group to ensure a power of 80%. In the first stage of the planned two-stage adaptive design,192 the study was planned to be continued on the basis of a new calculation of patients needed if the comparison of patient groups will be 0.0233< p1< 0.5. Otherwise, the study may be closed for superiority (p1< 0.0233) or shall be closed for futility (p1≥ 0.5). There was no maximum sample size cap and stopping rules were binding.”193 Values p1 and p2 are p-values derived from independent stage 1 and stage 2 data, respectively. Evidence of benefit will be claimed if the overall two-stage p-value derived from p1 and p2 is ≤0.05.\n\nExample 2. Timing and frequency of interim analyses; planned stopping boundaries for superiority and futility. See table 4\n\nView this table:\n\nExample 3. Planned timing and frequency of interim analyses; pre-specified dose selection rules for an inferentially seamless phase 2/3 (7-arm 2-stage) AD\n\n“The interim analysis was pre-planned for when at least 110 patients per group (770 total) had completed at least 2 weeks of treatment. The dose selection guidelines were based on efficacy and safety. The mean effect of each indacaterol dose versus placebo was judged against pre-set efficacy reference criteria for trough FEV1 and FEV1AUC1–4h. For trough FEV1, the reference efficacy criterion was the highest value of: (a) the difference between tiotropium and placebo, (b) the difference between formoterol and placebo, or (c) 120 mL (regarded as the minimum clinically important difference). For standardized FEV1AUC1–4h, the reference efficacy criterion was the highest value of: (a) the difference between tiotropium and placebo or (b) the difference between formoterol and placebo. If more than one indacaterol dose exceeded both the efficacy criteria, the lowest effective dose plus the next higher dose were to be selected. Data on peak FEV1, % change in FEV1, and FVC were also supplied to the DMC for possible consideration, but these measures were not part of the formal dose selection process and are not presented here. The DMC also took into consideration any safety signals observed in any treatment arm.”141\n\nExample 4. Timing and frequency of interim analyses; decision-making criteria for population enrichment and sample size increase\n\n“Cohort 1 will enrol a total of 120 patients and followed them until 60 PFS events are obtained. At an interim analysis based on the first 40 PFS events, an independent data monitoring committee will compare the conditional power for the full population (CPF) and the conditional power for the cutaneous subpopulation (CPS). The formulae for these conditional powers are given in the supplementary appendix (part of item 3b, example 2, box 8). (a) If CPF <0.3 and CPS <0.5, the results are in the unfavourable zone; the trial will enrol 70 patients to cohort 2 and follow them until 35 PFS events are obtained (then test effect in the full population). (b) If CPF <0.3 and CPS >0.5, the results are in the enrichment zone; the trial will enrol 160 patients with cutaneous disease (subpopulation) to cohort 2 and follow them until 110 PFS events have been obtained from the combined patients in both cohorts with cutaneous disease only (then test effect only in the cutaneous subpopulation). (c) If 0.3≤ CPF ≤0.95, the results are in the promising zone (so increase sample size); the trial will enrol 220 patients (full population) to cohort 2 and follow them up until 110 PFS events are obtained (then test effect in the full population). (d) If CPF >0.95, the results are in the favourable zone; the trial will enrol 70 patients to cohort 2 and follow them until 35 PFS events are obtained (then test effect in full population).”99 See figure 2 of Mehta et al99 for a decision-making tree.\n\nExample 5.

This E&E document only addresses additional randomisation aspects that are essential when reporting any AD where the randomisation allocation changes. Note that the contents of extension items 7b and 8b overlap.\n\nExplanation—In AD randomised trials, the allocation ratio(s) may remain fixed throughout or change during the trial as a consequence of pre-planned adaptations (for example, when modifying randomisation to favour treatments more likely to show benefits, after treatment selection, or upon introduction of a new arm to an ongoing trial).73 Unplanned changes may also change allocation ratios (for example, after early stopping of a treatment arm due to unforeseeable harms).\n\nThis reporting item is particularly important for response-adaptive randomisation (RAR) ADs as several factors influence their efficiency and operating characteristics, which in turn influence the trustworthiness of results and necessitate adequate reporting.13196197198199 For RAR ADs, authors should therefore detail the pre-planned:\n\nBurn-in period before activating randomisation updates, including the period when the control group allocation ratio was fixed;\n\nType of randomisation method with allocation ratios per group during the burn-in period as detailed in the standard CONSORT 2010 item 8b;\n\nMethod or algorithm used to adapt or modify the randomisation allocations after the burn-in period;\n\nInformation used to inform the adaptive randomisation algorithm and how it was derived (item 3b). Specifically, when a Bayesian RAR is used, we encourage authors to provide details of statistical models and rationale for the prior distribution chosen;\n\nFrequency of updating the allocation ratio (for example, after accrual of a certain number of participants with outcome data or defined regular time period) and;\n\nAdaptive decision-making criteria to declare early evidence in favour or against certain treatment groups (part of item 7b).\n\nIn addition, any envisaged changes to the allocation ratio as a consequence of other trial adaptations (for example, early stopping of an arm or addition of a new arm) should be stated. See box 14 for exemplars.\n\nBox 14\n\nExemplars on reporting item 8b elements\n\nExample 1.

The first 35 patients were randomized in a 2:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and each of the 5 active doses (randomisation method required) (i.e., 10 patients in the placebo group and 5 for each dose of active treatment). Subsequently, 2 of every 7 enrolled patients were assigned to placebo. Interim data evaluations of pain (AGPI) and pruritus questionnaire data (proportion of patients who reported ‘the itch is severe enough to cause major problems for me’ on an Itch Impact Questionnaire) were used to update the allocation probability according to a Bayesian algorithm for adaptive allocation and to assess efficacy and futility criteria for early stopping of enrolment (fig. 1 [not shown here]). Interim evaluations and updates to the allocation probabilities were performed weekly. Enrolment was to be stopped early after ≥50 patients had been followed for 4 weeks if either the efficacy criterion (>80% probability that the maximum utility dose reduces the pain score by ≥1.5 points more than the placebo) or the futility criterion (<45% probability that the maximum utility dose reduces pain more than the placebo) was met.”140 Details of statistical models used—including computation of posterior quantities; prior distribution with rationale; generation of the utility function; and weighting of randomisation probabilities—are accessible via a weblink provided (https://links.lww.com/PAIN/A433).\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSection 11. Randomisation (Blinding)\n\nACE item 11c (new): Measures to safeguard the confidentiality of interim information and minimise potential operational bias during the trial\n\nExplanation—Preventing or minimising bias is central for robust evaluation of the beneficial and harmful effects of interventions. Analysis of accumulating trial data brings challenges regarding how knowledge or leakage of information, or mere speculation about interim treatment effects, may influence behaviour of key stakeholders involved in the conduct of the trial.22122200 Such behavioural changes may include differential clinical management; reporting of harmful effects; clinical assessment of outcomes; and decision-making to favour one treatment group over the other. Inconsistencies in trial conduct before and after adaptations have wide implications that may affect trial validity and integrity.22 For example, use of statistical methods that combine data across stages may become questionable or may make overall results uninterpretable. AD randomised trials whose integrity was severely compromised by disclosure of interim results have resulted in regulators questioning the credibility of conclusions.201202 Most AD randomised trials, 76% (52/68)49 and 60% (151/251),112 did not disclose methods to minimise potential operational bias during interim analyses. The seriousness of this potential risk will depend on various trial characteristics, and the purpose of having disclosure is to enable readers to judge the risk of potential sources of bias, and thus judge how trustworthy they can assume results to be.\n\nThe literature covers processes and procedures which could be considered by researchers to preserve confidentiality of interim results to minimise potential operational bias.45123203 There is no universal approach that suits every situation due to factors such as feasibility; nature of the trial; and available resources and infrastructure. Some authors discuss roles and activities of independent committees in adaptive decision-making processes and control mechanisms for limiting access to interim information.203204205\n\nDescription of the process and procedures put in place to minimise the potential introduction of operational bias related to interim analyses and decision-making to inform adaptations is essential.22125203 Specifically, authors should give consideration to:\n\nWho recommended or made adaptation decisions. The roles of the sponsor or funder, clinical investigators, and trial monitoring committees (for example, independent data monitoring committee or dedicated committee for adaptation) in the decision-making process should be clearly stated;\n\nWho had access to interim data and performed interim analyses;\n\nSafeguards which were in place to maintain confidentiality (for example, how the interim results were communicated and to whom and when).\n\nSee box 15 for exemplars.\n\nBox 15\n\nExemplars on reporting item 11c elements\n\nExample 1. Inferentially seamless phase 2/3 AD\n\n“The interim analysis was carried out by an independent statistician (from ClinResearch GmbH, Köln, Germany), who was the only person outside the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with access to the semi-blinded randomization (sic) codes (treatment groups identified by letters A to G). This statistician functioned independently of the investigators, the sponsor’s clinical trial team members and the team that produced statistical programming for the interim analysis (DATAMAP GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). The independent statistician was responsible for all analyses of efficacy and safety data for the interim analysis. The DMC was given semi-blinded results with treatment groups identified by the letters A to G, with separate decodes sealed in an envelope to be opened for decision-making. The personnel involved in the continuing clinical study were told which two doses had been selected, but study blinding remained in place and the results of the interim analysis were not communicated. No information on the effects of the indacaterol doses (including the two selected) was communicated outside the DMC.”141\n\nExample 2. Bayesian inferentially seamless phase 2/3 AD with RAR\n\n“An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) external to Lilly provided oversight of the implementation of the adaptive algorithm and monitored study safety. The DMC fulfilled this role during the dose-finding portion, and continued monitoring after dose selection until an interim database lock at 52 weeks, at which time the study was unblinded to assess the primary objectives. Sites and patients continued to be blinded to the treatment allocation until the completion of the study. The DMC was not allowed to intervene with the design operations. A Lilly Internal Review Committee (IRC), independent of the study team, would meet if the DMC recommended the study to be modified. The role of the IRC was to make the final decision regarding the DMC’s recommendation. The external Statistical Analysis Center (SAC) performed all interim data analyses for the DMC, evaluated the decision rules and provided the randomization updates for the adaptive algorithm. The DMC chair and the lead SAC statistician reviewed these (interim) reports and were tasked to convene an unscheduled DMC meeting if an issue was identified with the algorithm or the decision point was triggered.”97\n\nExample 3. Inferentially seamless phase 2/3 AD with treatment selection, SSR, and non-binding futility stopping\n\n“Following the interim analysis of the data and the review of initial study hypotheses, the committee (IDMC) chairman will recommend in writing to the sponsor whether none, one or two regimen(s) of propranolol is (are) considered to be the ‘best’ (the most efficacious out of all regimens with a good safety profile) for further study in stage two of the design. The second ‘best’ regimen will only be chosen for further study along with the ‘best’ regimen if the first stage of the study suggests that recruitment in the second stage will be too compromised by the fact that 1 in 3 patients are assigned to placebo. The IDMC will not reveal the exact sample size increase in the recommendation letter in order to avoid potential sources of bias (only the independent statistician, the randomisation team and the IP suppliers will be informed of the actual sample size increase). Any safety concerns will also be raised in the IDMC recommendation letter. The chairman will ensure that the recommendations do not unnecessarily unblind the study. In the case where the sponsor decides to continue the study, the independent statistician will communicate to the randomisation team which regimen(s) is (are) to be carried forward.”98 Extracted from supplementary material.\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSection 12.

This ACE modified item extends this to require similar description to be made of statistical methods used for interim analyses. Furthermore, statistical methods used to analyse any other adaptation outcomes (item 6) should be detailed to enhance reproducibility of the adaptation process and results. Authors should focus on complete description of statistical models and aspects of the estimand of interest206207 consistent with stated objectives and hypotheses (item 2b) and pre-planned adaptations (item 3b).\n\nFor Bayesian ADs, item 12b (paragraph 6) describes similar information that should be reported for Bayesian methods.\n\nSee box 16 for exemplars.\n\nBox 16\n\nExemplars on reporting item 12a elements\n\nExample 1. Frequentist AD\n\nAuthors are referred to the CONSORT 2010 statement34 for examples.\n\nExample 2. 2-stage Bayesian biomarker-based AD with RAR\n\nIn a methods paper, Gu et al208 detail Bayesian logistic regression models for evaluating treatment and marker effects at the end of stage 1 and 2 using non-informative normal priors during RAR and futility early stopping decisions. Strategies for variable selection and model building at the end of stage 1 to identify further important biomarkers for use in RAR of stage 2 patients are described (part of item 3b), including a shrinkage prior used for biomarker selection with rationale.\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nACE item 12b (new): For the implemented adaptive design features, statistical methods used to estimate treatment effects for key endpoints and to make inferences\n\nComments—Note that items 7a and 12b are connected. Key endpoints are all primary endpoints as well as other endpoints considered highly important, for example, an endpoint used for adaptation.\n\nExplanation—A goal of every trial is to provide reliable estimates of the treatment effect for assessing benefits and risks to reach correct conclusions. Several statistical issues may arise when using an AD depending on its type and the scope of adaptations, the adaptive decision-making criteria and whether frequentist or Bayesian methods are used to design and analyse the trial.22 Conventional estimates of treatment effect based on fixed design methods may be unreliable when applied to ADs (for example, may exaggerate the patient benefit).96209210211212213 Precision around the estimated treatment effects may be incorrect (for example, the width of confidence intervals may be incorrect). Other methods available to summarise the level of evidence in hypothesis testing (for example, p-values) may give different answers. Some factors and conditions that influence the magnitude of estimation bias have been investigated and there are circumstances when it may not be of concern.209214215216217218 Secondary analyses (for example, health economic evaluation) may also be affected if appropriate adjustments are not made.219220 Cameron et al221 discuss methodological challenges in performing network meta-analysis when combining evidence from randomised trials with ADs and fixed designs. Statistical methods for estimating the treatment effect and its precision exist for some ADs68222223224225226227228229230231 and implementation tools are being developed.82232233234 However, these methods are rarely used or reported and the implications are unclear.49209235 Debate and research on inference for some ADs with complex adaptations is ongoing.\n\nIn addition to statistical methods for comparing outcomes between groups (item 12a), we specifically encourage authors to clearly describe statistical methods used to estimate measures of treatment effects with associated uncertainty (for example, confidence or credible intervals) and p-value (when appropriate); referencing relevant literature is sufficient. When conventional or naïve estimators derived from fixed design methods are used, it should be clearly stated. In situations where statistical simulations were used to either explore the extent of bias in estimation of the treatment effects (such as181236) or operating characteristics, it is good practice to mention this and provide supporting evidence (item 24c).\n\nADs tend to increase the risk of making misleading or unjustified claims of treatments effects if traditional methods that ignore trial adaptations are used. In general, this arises when selecting one or more hypothesis test results from a possible list in order to claim evidence of the desired conclusion. For instance, the risks may increase by testing the same hypothesis several times (for example, at interim and final analyses), hypothesis testing of multiple treatment comparisons, selecting an appropriate population from multiple target populations, adapting key outcomes, or a combination of these.22 A variety of adaptive statistical methods exist for controlling specific operating characteristics of the design (for example, type I error rate, power) depending on the nature of the repeated testing of hypotheses.51616282192237238239240241242\n\nAuthors should therefore state operating characteristics of the design that have been controlled and details of statistical methods used. The need for controlling a specific type of operating characteristic (for example, pairwise or familywise type I error rate) is context dependent (for example, based on regulatory considerations, objectives and setting) so clarification is encouraged to help interpretation. How evidence of benefit and/or risk is claimed (part of item 7a) and hypotheses being tested (item 2b) should be clear. In situations where statistical simulations were used, we encourage authors to provide a report, where possible (item 24b).\n\nWhen data or statistical tests across independent stages are combined to make statistical inference, authors should clearly describe the combination test method (for example, Fisher’s combination method, inverse normal method or conditional error function)192240241243244 and weights used for each stage (when not obvious). This information is important because different methods and weights may produce results that lead to different conclusions. Bauer and Einfalt107 found low reporting quality of these methods.\n\nBrard et al245 found evidence of poor reporting of Bayesian methods. To address this, when a Bayesian AD is used, authors should detail the model used for analysis to estimate the posterior probability distribution; the prior distribution used and rationale for its choice; whether the prior was updated in light of interim data and how; and clarify the stages when the prior information was used (interim or/and final analysis). If an informative prior was used, the source of data to inform this prior should be disclosed where applicable. Of note, part of the Bayesian community argue that it is not principled to control frequentist operating characteristics in Bayesian ADs,246 although these can be computed and presented.22154247\n\nTypically, ADs require quickly observed adaptation outcomes relative to the expected length of the trial. In some ADs, randomised participants who have received the treatment may not have their outcome data available at the interim analysis (referred to as overrunning participants) for various reasons.248 These delayed responses may pose ethical dilemmas depending on the adaptive decisions taken, present logistical challenges, or diminish the efficiency of the AD depending on their prevalence and the objective of the adaptations.201 It is therefore useful for readers to understand how overrunning participants were dealt with at interim analyses especially after a terminal adaptation decision (for example, when a trial or treatment groups were stopped early for efficacy or futility). If outcome data of overrunning participants were collected, a description should be given of how these data were analysed and combined with interim results after the last interim decision was made. Some formal statistical methods to deal with accrued data from overrunning participants have been proposed.249\n\nSee box 17 for exemplars.\n\nBox 17\n\nExemplars on reporting item 12 elements\n\nExample 1. GSD; statistical method for estimating treatment effects\n\n“Stagewise ordering was used to compute the unbiased median estimate and confidence limits for the prognosis-group-adjusted hazard rates.250”251\n\nExample 2. Inferentially seamless (4-arm 2-stage) AD with dose selection; statistical methods for controlling operating characteristics\n\n“…the power of the study ranged from 71% to >91% to detect a treatment difference at a one-sided α of 0.025 when the underlying response rate of ≥1 of the crofelemer dose groups exceeded placebo by 20%. The clinical response of 20% was based on an estimated response rate of 55% in crofelemer and 35% in placebo during the 4-week placebo-controlled assessment period.… For the primary endpoint, the test for comparing the placebo and treatment arms reflected the fact that data were gathered in an adaptive fashion and controlled for the possibility of an increased Type I error rate. Using the methods of Posch and Bauer,68 as agreed upon during the special protocol assessment process, a p-value was obtained for comparison of each dose to the placebo arm from the stage I data, and an additional p-value was obtained for comparison of the optimal dose to the placebo arm from the independent data gathered in stage II. For the final primary analysis, the p-values from the first and second stages were combined by the inverse normal weighting combination function, and a closed testing procedure was implemented to test the null hypothesis using the methods of Posch and Bauer,68 based on the original work of Bauer and Kieser.69 This closed test controlled the experiment-wise error rate for this 2-stage adaptive design at a one-sided α of 0.025.”252 Extracted from appendix material.\n\nExample 3. 3-arm 2-stage group-sequential AD with treatment selection; combination test method; multiplicity adjustments; statistical method for estimating treatment effects\n\n“The proposed closed testing procedure will combine weighted inverse normal combination tests using pre-defined fixed weights, the closed testing principle,68253254 and the Hochberg-adjusted 1-sided P-value on stage 1 data. This testing procedure strongly controls the overall type I error rate at α level (see “Simulations run to assess the type I error rate under several null hypothesis scenarios”). Multiplicity-adjusted flexible repeated 95% 2-sided CIs217 on the percentage of patients will be calculated for otamixaban dose 1, otamixaban dose 2, and UFH plus eptifibatide. Relative risk and its 95% 2-sided CIs will also be calculated. Point estimates based on the multiplicity-adjusted flexible repeated CIs will be used.”181 See supplementary material of the paper for details.\n\nExample 4.

Analytical derivations were presented for the two cases assuming enrichment occurs at interim analysis and no enrichment after interim analysis.

Here, we only address additional requirements for ADs.\n\nExplanation—The CONSORT 2010 statement34 discusses why it is essential to describe participant flow adequately from screening to analysis. This applies to both interim and final analyses depending on the stage of reporting. The number of participants for each group with adaptation outcome data (that contributed to the interim analyses) should also be reported if different from the number of participants with primary outcome data. Furthermore, authors should report the number of randomised participants, for each group, that did not contribute to each interim analysis because of lack of mature outcome data at that interim look. For example, overrunning participants that were still being followed up when a terminal adaptation decision was made (for example, dropping of treatment groups or early trial termination). The presentation of participant flow should align with the key hypotheses (for example, subpopulation(s) and full study population) and treatment comparisons depending on the stage of results being reported.\n\nSee box 18 for exemplars.\n\nBox 18\n\nExemplars on reporting item 13 (participant flowcharts)\n\nExample 1.

Some ADs, such as those that evaluate multiple treatments allowing dropping of futile ones, selection of promising treatments, or addition of new treatments to an ongoing trial,19106258259 incorporate pre-planned adaptations to drop or add new treatment groups during the course of the trial. As a result, dates of recruitment and follow-up may differ across treatment groups. In addition, the comparator arm may also change with time and concurrent or non-concurrent controls may be used. There are statistical implications that include how analysis populations for particular treatment comparisons are defined at different stages. For each treatment group, authors should clearly state the exact dates defining recruitment and follow-up periods. It should be stated if all treatment groups were recruited and followed-up during the same period.\n\nSee box 19 for exemplars.\n\nBox 19\n\nExemplars on reporting item 14a\n\nExample 1.

Phase 2 Bayesian biomarker-targeted AD with RAR\n\n“A total of 341 patients were enrolled in the BATTLE study between November 30, 2006, and October 28, 2009, with equally random assignments for the first 97 patients and adaptive randomization for the remaining 158.”256\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nCONSORT 2010/ACE item 14b (clarification): Why the trial ended or was stopped\n\nComment—This item should be applied without reference to the CONSORT 2010 statement.34\n\nExplanation—Some clinical trials are stopped earlier than planned for reasons that will have implications for interpretation and generalisability of results. For example, poor recruitment is a common challenge.261 This may limit the inference drawn or complicate interpretation of results based on insufficient or truncated trial data. Thus, the reporting of reasons for stopping a trial early including circumstances leading to that decision could help readers to interpret results with relevant caveats.\n\nThe CONSORT 2010 statement,34 however, did not distinguish early stopping of a trial due to a pre-planned adaptation from an unplanned change. To address this and for consistency, we have now reserved this item for reporting of reasons why the trial or certain treatment arm(s) were stopped outside the scope of pre-planned adaptations, including those involved in deliberations leading to this decision (for example, sponsor, funder, or trial monitoring committee). We also introduced item 14c to capture aspects of adaptation decisions made in light of the accumulating data, such as stopping the trial or treatment arm because the decision-making criterion to do so has been met.\n\nSee box 20 for exemplars.\n\nBox 20\n\nExemplars on reporting item 14b\n\nExample 1. 2-stage AD with options for futility and efficacy early stopping and increase in sample size; unplanned trial termination\n\n“The planned interim analysis of the study was done in November 2005 after 125 patients have been (sic) recruited.… According to the adaptive design of the study, we therefore calculated another 163 patients per treatment group to be required to answer the primary question. Upon the slow accrual up to that timepoint, the study coordinators decided to close the trial at the end of 2005. Further analysis was regarded to be exploratory.”193\n\nExample 2. Sequential-step AD; unplanned trial termination\n\n“…the third interim analysis indicated unexpectedly low initial cure rates in both arms; 84% in the multiple dose and 73% in the single-dose arm. The stopping rule was not met …, but based on the observed poor efficacy overall, and following discussions with the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and investigators, the sponsor terminated the trial.”262\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nACE item 14c (new): Specify what trial adaptation decisions were made in light of the pre-planned decision-making criteria and observed accrued data\n\nExplanation—ADs depend on adherence to pre-planned decision rules to inform adaptations. Thus, it is vital for research consumers to be able to assess whether the adaptation rules were adhered to as pre-specified in the decision-making criteria given the observed accrued data at the interim analyses. Failure to adhere to pre-planned decision rules may undermine the integrity of the results and validity of the design by affecting the operating characteristics (see item 7b for details on binding and non-binding decision rules).\n\nUnforeseeable events can occur that may lead to deviations from some pre-planned adaptation decisions rules (for example, the overruling or ignoring of certain rules). It is therefore essential to adequately describe which pre-planned adaptations were enforced, which were pre-planned but were not enforced or overruled even though the interim analysis decision rules indicated an adaptation should be made, and which unplanned changes were made other than unplanned early stopping of the trial or treatment arm(s) covered by item 14b. Pre-planned adaptations that were not implemented are difficult to assess because the interim decisions made versus the pre-planned intended decisions are often poorly reported, and reasons are rarely given.115 The rationale for ignoring or overruling pre-planned adaptation decisions, or making unplanned decisions that affect the adaptations should be clearly stated and also who recommended or made such decisions (for example, the data monitoring committee or adaptation committee). This enables assessment of potential bias in the adaptation decision-making process, which is crucial for the credibility of the trial.\n\nAuthors should indicate the point at which the adaptation decisions were made (that is, stage of results) and any additional design changes that were made as a consequence of adaptation decisions (for example, change in allocation ratio).\n\nSee box 21 for exemplars.\n\nBox 21\n\nExemplars on reporting item 14c elements\n\nExample 1. Bayesian adaptive-enrichment AD with futility and superiority early stopping; stage of results\n\n“Enrolment in the trial was stopped at 31 months, because the results of an interim analysis met the pre-specified criterion for trial discontinuation, which was a predictive probability of superiority of thrombectomy of at least 95% for the first primary endpoint (the mean score for disability on the utility-weighted modified Rankin scale at 90 days). This was the first pre-specified interim analysis that permitted stopping for this reason, and it was based on the enrolment of 200 patients. Because enrichment thresholds had not been crossed, the analysis included the full population of patients enrolled in the trial, regardless of infarct volume.”100\n\nExample 2. Dose-selection decisions for an inferentially seamless phase 2/3 AD\n\n“The two doses of indacaterol selected against the two reference efficacy criteria were 150 µg (as the lowest dose exceeding both criteria) and 300 µg (as the next highest dose). The safety results, together with the safety data from the other 1-year study, led the DMC to conclude that there was no safety signal associated with indacaterol at any dose. Thus, the two doses selected (at stage 1) to continue into stage 2 of the study were indacaterol 150 and 300 µg.”141\n\nRETURN TO TEXT\n\nSection 15.

This item should be applied with reference to the CONSORT 2010 statement,34 with additional requirements for specific ADs.\n\nExplanation—The presentation of treatment group summaries of key characteristics and demographics of randomised participants who contributed to results influences interpretation and helps readers and medical practitioners to make judgements about which patients the results are applicable to. For some ADs, such as population (or biomarker or patient) enrichment,87146 when the study population is considered heterogeneous, a trial could be designed to evaluate if study treatments are effective in specific pre-specified subpopulations or a wider study population (full population). A pre-planned adaptation strategy may involve testing the effect of treatments in both pre-specified subpopulations of interest and the wider population in order to target patients likely to benefit the most. For such ADs, it is essential to provide summaries of characteristics of those who were randomised and who contributed to the results being reported (both interim or final), by treatment group for each subpopulation of interest and the full population consistent with hypotheses tested. These summaries should be reported without hypothesis testing of baseline differences in participants’ characteristics because it is illogical in randomised trials.263264265266 The CONSORT 2010 statement34 presents an example of how to summarise baseline characteristics.\n\nIn the presence of marked differences in the numbers of randomised participants and those included in the interim or final analyses, authors are encouraged to report baseline summaries by treatment group for these two populations. Readers will then be able to assess representativeness of the interim or final analysis population relative to those randomised and also the target population.\n\nSee box 22 for an exemplar.\n\nBox 22\n\nExemplar on reporting item 15a\n\nExample.

Consequently, results may be inconsistent or heterogeneous between stages (interim parts) of the trial.201 For ADs, access to interim results or mere guesses based on interim decisions taken may influence behaviour of those directly involved in the conduct of the trial and thus introduce operational bias.22 Some trial adaptations may introduce intended changes to inclusion or exclusion criteria (for example, population enrichment92146). Unintended changes to characteristics of patients over time may occur (population drift).267 A concern is whether this could lead to a trial with a different study population that does not address the primary research objectives.268 This jeopardises validity, interpretability, and credibility of trial results. It may be difficult to determine whether differences in characteristics between stages occurred naturally due to chance, were an unintended consequence of pre-planned trial adaptations, represent operational bias introduced by knowledge or communication of interim results, or are for other reasons.269 However, details related to item 11c may help readers make informed judgements on whether any observed marked differences in characteristics between stag"
