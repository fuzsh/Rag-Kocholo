        "text": "Buzzing from the enlightening insight, stories and ideas shared by a fantastic range of speakers at the Future of Work Conference in London. And I finally got to meet employee engagement pioneers in person, like David MacLeod OBE, Jo Moffatt and Charlotte Dahl. Great to also meet with peers like the brilliant Jo Coxhill (CIIC) 🌟 and Andy Holt ⭐. Lots of useful takeaways. Here are my top two: Supercharge your storytelling - it will pay dividends.🚀 This was a golden thread in many presentations and fireside chats. Sam Bleazard (Fortnum & Mason) shared tips on how to get started if you're not already doing it. 1) Seek out the stories that aren't being told 2) make sure your employees see themselves in the stories, 3) tell stories that surprise and delight them. Embrace AI. 🧐 It's not only helping internal communicators create a positive and more inclusive workplace culture, but it's a fantastic tool for IC to use.👊 It's here to stay, so run with it and make it work for your organisation. Today's presenters shared their experiences of involving employees to structure AI-based platforms that connect, inform and engage their organisation at every level, from leaders to frontline - a demographic that's often been left behind. Platforms not only personalise the information they need to be more productive in their role, but support career aspirations, wellbeing, business and social collaboration and continuous improvement... the list of positive benefits is exciting.👏 There were so many brilliant breakout presentations and fireside chats covering subjects as broad as building a culture where everyone can succeed, to disciplined routines to increase communication engagement. All contained some real 'sit up and pay attention' moments. 😮 Well done to all the speakers. Congratulations to the Engage for Success team on another thoroughly worthwhile and enjoyable day. Thank you.🫶 #internalcommunications #engageforsuccess\n\n🌟 Inspiring Workplace Transformation 🌟 In 2014, KPMG faced a significant challenge - low employee morale and engagement, with nearly half of their workforce holding an unfavorable opinion about the firm. They tried conventional solutions such as perks, pay raises, and flexibility, but these yielded limited results. The turning point came when KPMG decided to put \"purpose\" at the heart of their engagement strategy. Instead of focusing on the broad \"why\" of their work, they began telling captivating stories of their involvement in pivotal moments in world history. These stories showcased how KPMG's work served a higher purpose, leaving a lasting impact on employees. However, KPMG didn't stop there. The real game-changer was the \"10,000 Stories Challenge.\" Employees were invited to share how they were making a difference in the present. This approach prompted individuals to find a specific answer to the question, \"Who is served by the work that we do?\" The results were remarkable! KPMG received a staggering 42,000 stories, and this initiative significantly boosted morale and engagement across the organization. It underscored the importance of shifting focus from the collective \"why\" to an individual \"who\" in defining purpose. What we can learn from this is the power of recognizing and celebrating the impact of our work on specific individuals. It's about understanding and showcasing the tangible difference we make, not just in grandiose terms but in the day-to-day lives of people. Leaders play a pivotal role in this transformation. They become chief storytelling officers, sharing stories of how the work benefits clients, coworkers, and communities. Everyone has a part to play - capturing instances where our work makes a positive impact and saving them as powerful stories. Ultimately, the goal in the workplace is to do meaningful work and have leaders who convey that employees matter. It's about answering the question, \"Who is served by the work that you do?\" Let's reflect on this and aim to make a meaningful difference in our work every day. #Purpose #EmployeeEngagement #WorkplaceTransformation #TED #tedtalks\n\n𝐈 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 😁 This is a statement that consisently ranks among the most influential for us on engagement outcomes.* And pride is an interesting emotion, in the organisational context. When I'm 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘮𝘺𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘧, it's about feelings of personal mastery. When I'm 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘮𝘺 𝘰𝘳𝘨𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, I'd argue it's about status. - Does working here enhance or diminish my sense of status? - Does what we do and how we do it make me feel more worthy? And what's the alternative? Shame and/or humiliation 😳 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐦𝐞: I'm ashamed to be associated with the impact that we have on others (and the world around us). I feel bad for our customers, our community, the environment... 𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: I feel belittled by my association with the organisation. I feel less important, less competent, just \"less\" because of it... 🥡 So, if you can only have one conversation with your people, perhaps it should be: - What makes you more proud to work here? and - What makes you less proud to work here? - What would make you (even) more proud to work here (thanks Chris!) 💡 I'll bet you learn not only about your people, but about your business and how it is perceived, too! ------ *What I mean by that is motivation, intention to stay and willingness to recommend. Some people would describe it as an element of employee engagement, part of emotional engagement. But with Px3 we're interest in 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐬 as a result of how people feel, and of their environment. So we keep it separate. #employeeengagement #organisationalpride The People Experience Hub Nick Court Ted Hewett *Image create by AI - The post was not!\n\n🌟 This 𝑬𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒐𝒚𝒆𝒆 𝑨𝒑𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑫𝒂𝒚, let's redefine the way we celebrate our teams! 🌟 At 𝐀𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐫 𝐇𝐑, we understand that at the centre of every thriving organization, are people who feel connected to their organization’s mission and appreciated for their contributions. As we navigate the ups and downs of business and operational challenges, it's important to pause and recognize the commitment and creativity employees bring to the table each day. But how do we move beyond the conventional '𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐘𝐨𝐮' to create an employee experience that is more meaningful? Here's where we can lean into the practice of effective recognition: ⚓ 𝑼𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑻𝒉𝒆𝒊𝒓 𝑼𝒏𝒊𝒒𝒖𝒆 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔: Ensure we understand and appreciate the unique strengths our team members bring. Appreciate the nuances that each person brings to their role, and acknowledge these in specific and authentic ways. ⚓ 𝑨𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒏 𝑹𝒆𝒄𝒐𝒈𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑪𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆𝒔: Anchor your appreciation practices in the core values of your organization. Let every act of recognition be a reflection of what your company stands for, reinforcing a sense of shared purpose and community. ⚓ 𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒓 𝑷𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍, 𝑬𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆-𝑩𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝑹𝒆𝒘𝒂𝒓𝒅𝒔: Ensure your methods of appreciation, such as professional development opportunities, wellness programs, or flexible work arrangements, are backed by what truly resonates with your employees' needs and aspirations. ⚓ 𝑴𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝑰𝒕 𝒂 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒖𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝑫𝒊𝒂𝒍𝒐𝒈𝒖𝒆: Employee Appreciation Day is a fantastic starting point, but let's commit to making appreciation a consistent practice. Foster an environment where recognition is part of the everyday fabric of your organizational culture. As we embrace this 𝑬𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒐𝒚𝒆𝒆 𝑨𝒑𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝑫𝒂𝒚, let's also pledge to appreciate not just the work that gets done but the incredible individuals who make it happen. Let's tailor our approach, ensuring gratitude is personalized for the team members we are fortunate to work alongside. Here's to creating an employee experience that not only drives organizational results, but also builds a community of valued, recognized, and motivated individuals. 🙌 #EmployeeAppreciationDay #HR #EmployeeExperience #BusinessCulture #AnchorHR\n\nTICK Box exercise in the corporate world.... NEVER 👇🏻😂👇🏻 Controversial I know but how many employees really feel like this? Do we spend enough time helping employees understand the value of engagement, learning or wellbeing or do we just provide stuff with no meaning? It has to be time to change this and make things more MEANINGFUL, SIMPLISTIC and INDIVIDUALISED🙏🏻 This is a snippet from a great discussion I had with Vanessa Vallely OBE CCMI at #OneTechWorld last week..... It is time to help employees rather than just providing pointless links with no meaning... want to engage people then provide the WHY you are doing something not just the WHAT and the HOW. The whole interview with more tips and advice on engagement and how to 'Love your JOB... MORE... Everyday' is in the comments below 👇🏻 Want to get an overview of the Engage to Succeed model then drop me an email or message and can send you a private link 😁 #employeeengagement #lifebalance #engagementcoaching #careerdevelopment #wellbeing\n\nToday, on May 20th, we celebrate 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗛𝗥 𝗗𝗮𝘆. In honor of this day, I’d like to share two key lessons from my experience with HR, both as an employee at Accenture and now as a 𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹-𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗼𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲. 1. I used to underestimate the importance of HR's role until I realized that my relationship with HR was just as crucial as my interactions with colleagues and leaders. Imagine a company without HR—who would handle talent growth, job postings, new hires, payroll, labor regulations, and the overall employee experience? HR teams are the invisible backbone of every company, and their role is just as important as any other key area. In my experience, the meaning I attribute to HR has evolved from enhancing employees' lives within the company to facilitating individual transformation in the workplace. 2. Watching Selena Gomez's documentary 'My Mind & Me' (which I highly recommend) was eye-opening. There's a powerful moment where a Mental Health Expert explains how we can feel profoundly lonely even in a crowd. He points out that many people, despite seeming to have it all, struggle with mental health because, he quotes, \"what really matters is the quality of connections we have. Whenever we have interactions with people where we feel like we can't be ourselves, that actually separates us further from others and ourselves.\" It was an 'aha' moment because it explains one of the things that happened to me. I realized that I often felt deeply disconnected at work because I didn't feel I could be myself. It was easier to connect with colleagues than to relate to my leaders, which left me feeling isolated. This is an area where HR can truly make a difference. By fostering environments where employees can truly be themselves, HR can bridge these gaps and enhance workplace connections. Creating spaces for authentic interactions is essential for both individual well-being and organizational success. HR can significantly impact both personal and organizational growth. It's clear that HR does much more than managing processes; HR can nurture a culture where everyone feels valued and connected by prioritizing genuine interactions and creating safe spaces for authenticity. That is why at Con-Ciencia, we encourage leaders and HR professionals to consider how they can foster such environments in their own workplaces. Let's work together to create spaces where everyone can thrive and truly be themselves. #HR #MentalHealth #EmployeeWellbeing #Leadership #WorkplaceCulture\n\nExciting (and repostable news...see what I did there!?) I'm thrilled to present to some and introduce to others my baby, my inspiration, my life changer, my new venture, Going Beyond the Work, LLC. For just over a year now, we have been partnering with organizations to strengthen safety, collaboration and healthy and thriving engagement in the workplace. Our approach blends HR, DEI, and employee engagement to dismantle traditional, box-checking, and time-consuming and expensive but unhelpful initiatives people don't want or understand. We have conversations with individuals and teams about their personal history, experiences before and at the organization, and what they need from the work environment to feel engaged, challenged, and fulfilled. We develop categories of focus from these conversations where Board members, leadership and staff work in collaboration to form working groups for each goal, empowered and encouraged to build shared values and systems, using feedback as a mechanism, to turn organizational obstacles into opportunity, strengthen relationships across levels and teams and center safety and respect for all staff. Our aim is to ensure that all staff feel valued, respected, and invested in, regardless of their tenure, position, level, identity, background, or ability. This is the greatest tool for retaining and attracting diverse, dynamic talent. In addition to our transformational work, we also support traditional HR work as Fractional CPO's, facilitate retreats and convenings, conduct HR and DEI assessments, and develop and implement internal communications to keep employees informed and connected. If you're interested in partnering with us, please reach out. Let's work together to build community at work and make a meaningful impact.

I shared some insights on \"Wellbeing First: Building a Culture of Trust within Organizations,\" and here's what we discussed: Key Takeaways: ⦿ Building Real Trust: Genuine care boosts employee health and satisfaction and is key to creating trust. ⦿ Trust in Action: Trust must be visible to be effective. ⦿ Values Matter: Company values should actively promote a trusting environment. ⦿T rust as a Belief: Trust should be a fundamental part of our beliefs. ⦿ Beyond Work-Life Balance: Forget the old work-life balance idea; think integration. Work is part of life, not a competitor. ⦿ Tech Transformations: AI and tech are revolutionizing HR, making work better for everyone. Reflections on Business Challenges: ⦿ Employee Burnout: More than 4 in 10 employees report feeling burned out, which hits productivity and morale hard. ⦿ Retention Issues: Companies are losing talent because they aren't addressing wellbeing and trust effectively. ⦿ Engagement and Performance: A culture lacking trust and support sees lower engagement and performance. Let's chat about these ideas and how we can make them work for you. Drop a comment or DM me to dive deeper into creating a thriving workplace! PS. I will send my presentation to anyone who DMs me or comments \"Send me the presentation!\" #HRinAction #WellbeingFirst #TrustCulture #EmployeeEngagement #InnovativeHR\n\nTake your DEI community support to the next level with Fresh and Fearless 🚀 As expert DEI consultants, we specialise in empowering employee resource groups and DEI task forces.
