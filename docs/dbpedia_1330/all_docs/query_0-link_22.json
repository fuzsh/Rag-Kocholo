Accounting for over half of all internet traffic, cyber crime’s prevalence is a testament to the cunning and adaptability of modern criminals, who have capitalised on recent global crises to target businesses.\n\nThe financial repercussions are dire, with 60% of small businesses shutting down within six months post-hack—a figure that jumps to 93% if they lose data access for ten days. This grim reality echoes the words of John Chambers, former CEO of Cisco Systems, who warned that breaches are inevitable—it’s not a matter of if, but when.\n\nIt protects against 98.5% of cyber threats.\n\nYou’ll win new business and build trust with customers and partners.\n\nIt helps prevent a data breach and avoid potentially crippling fines.\n\nIt can lower your insurance costs by decreasing your cyber security risk.\n\nYou’ll reduce your risk of failing by reducing your risk of being attacked.\n\nIt will help you improve business efficiency and increase productivity to reduce costs.\n\nUse a firewall to secure your internet connection,\n\nChoose the most secure settings for your devices and software,\n\nControl who has access to your data and systems,\n\nProtect against malware and viruses and\n\nKeep your devices and software up to date.\n\nAs of April 2023, organisations looking to get certified will also have to implement Multi-Factor Authentication and take action to secure their cloud environments. These extra measures have been put in place this year to keep up with cyber security trends seen in recent months, especially when it comes to cloud security.\n\nFor businesses that need more reassurance that their cyber security is up to scratch, there is Cyber Essentials Plus. This certification is based on the same 5 Cyber Essentials controls but is independently verified by a licensed auditor to check that all the requirements have in fact been met.\n\nYou can also register for our webinar on 11th April where we'll share more information about how to obtain Cyber Essentials certification including how to fill in the Cyber Essentials questionnaire correctly, how long it takes to get certified and what you need to do stay compliant.
