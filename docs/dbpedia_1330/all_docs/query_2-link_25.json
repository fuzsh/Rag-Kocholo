As a result, different types of fraudulent activities – e.g. adding harmful substances, re-branding of inferior products, etc., leading to integrity issues in these products have emerged as a serious concern. Every year, consumers are cheated of billions of dollars, and the monetary value of fraud in food and dietary or nutritional supplements is estimated to be over $40 billion annually. Existing solutions for analysis often require extensive sample preparation or are limited in terms of detecting different types of integrity issues. We are working on a novel authentication method based on Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectroscopy, which is quantitative, non-invasive, and non-destructive. It is sensitive to small deviation in the solid-state chemical structure of a product, which changes the NQR signal properties. These characteristics are unique for different manufacturers, resulting in manufacturer-specific watermarks. We use a machine learning-based classification called support vector machines (SVMs) to verify the authenticity of products under test. This approach has been evaluated using semi-custom hardware. We are also working on making a portable setup of the entire setup.\n\nProject Title #2: Machine Learning for Verifying Trustworthiness of Electronics\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): Tamzidul Hoque and Prabuddha Chakraborty\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior, Senior, 2 students per semester\n\nPrerequisites: Required: digital logic, digital design; Recommended: programming experience and machine learning\n\nCredit: 0-3 credits via EGN 4912\n\nStipend: Contact Dr. Swarup Bhunia\n\nApplication Requirements: Basic Online Application, Resume, Statement of research interest, Faculty Interview, Email Dr. Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu, with application requirements.\n\nApplication Deadline: none\n\nWebsite: N/A\n\nProject Description: Malicious modification of integrated circuits known as hardware Trojans have become a serious concern today with the globalization of the IC supply chain.

The security of FPGA-based designs has emerged as a critical concern due to the FPGA design files (bitstreams) being vulnerable to attacks. Bitstream obfuscation has been recently studied as a potential solution that provides the necessary protection to designs mapped onto FPGA. This approach relies on a key generation function, such as Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to alter a mapped function both structurally and functionally. However, a fundamental problem with PUF-based key generators is that the key bits are unstable and therefore cannot provide the same desired key at all times. In this project, we will implement a robust obfuscation approach that is capable of tolerating bit-flips in the generated key. We will develop an algorithm that applies the obfuscation to designs mapped to any FPGA. Finally, we will demonstrate the robustness against bit-flips on several digital signal processing (DSP) intellectual property (IP) blocks and observed the performance under various percentages of bit-flips in the key.\n\nProject Title #5: Wearable Carotid Ultrasound for Early Detection of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): Sumaiya Shomaji\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, 1 – 2 students per semester\n\nPrerequisites: Programming Skills (Python or MATLAB preferred) and/or Circuit Design Experience\n\nCredit: 0-3 credits via EGN 4912\n\nStipend: N/A\n\nApplication Requirements: Basic Online Application, Resume, Statement of research interest, Faculty Interview, Email one pdf file with all application requirements to Dr. Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu, to request an interview.\n\nApplication Deadline: none\n\nWebsite: N/A\n\nProject Description: Cardiovascular disease is currently responsible for a major portion of all global deaths. Fortunately, early detection of its symptoms can greatly contribute to effective prevention. Although various methods for cardiac diagnosis exist, most of them are clinic-based, and therefore time-consuming and costly. In this project, we are working on a novel wearable ultrasonic imaging assembly for routine, easy-to-use, and economical monitoring of the carotid artery as this is a proven marker for diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Students interested in healthcare innovations with programming and/or circuit design background are strongly encouraged to apply.\n\nProject Title #6: Remote Authentication of Internet of Things (IoT) devices\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): N/A\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior, Senior; 2 students per term\n\nPrerequisites: Required: digital logic, digital design, familiarity with reconfigurable devices (FPGAs); Recommended: basic circuits and programming knowledge.\n\nCredit: 0-3 credits via EGN 4912\n\nStipend: N/A\n\nApplication Requirements: Basic Online Application, Resume, Statement of research interest, Faculty Interview, Email one pdf file with all application requirements to Dr. Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu, to request an interview.\n\nApplication Deadline: none\n\nWebsite: http://swarup.ece.ufl.edu/\n\nProject Description: Internet of Things (IoT) has become a novel and popular paradigm in the scenario of communication, sensing, security, etc. and they have greatly impacted our lives in multiple application domains, including transportation and logistics, health care, personal, social, smart environment, and so on. The heterogeneous array of such devices in an infrastructure can greatly benefit from a hardware difficult-to-clone and a set of tamper-immune identifiers, which can be used to check the authenticity or integrity of a device. However, IoT entities are extremely vulnerable to attacks including physical tampering attacks since they are exposed and unattended in the environment for a long period of time. So, we are focusing on developing an intrinsic device identifier that captures the state of an IoT device and it can effectively reflect any physical tampering by transforming the intrinsic delay/transient current variations of boundary scan cell (BSC) paths into unique and robust signatures. This approach utilizes the boundary scan chain architecture (BSA) in integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCB) – a prevalent design-for-test (DFT) structure used in majority of PCBs today. Based on a standard DFT structure, this method works for heterogeneous devices and can be conducted during runtime of the device. We will generate signatures from devices under test and evaluate their security parameters in terms of uniqueness, robustness, randomness, etc. We will also explore a protocol for the cloud server, owner, or other IoT devices in a network to verify the identity of an IoT device using the proposed approach. This policy should be able prevent attacks to extract the secret keys of a device using an efficient moving target defense mechanism that periodically shifts the challenge vectors.\n\nProject Title #7: Developing a smart connected system for detecting and mitigating air-borne pathogens\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Swarup Bhunia, swarup@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): Naren V.

The attackers choice of Trojan placement within the circuit, as well as the design of the analog circuitry, determines the characteristics of the attack.\n\nProject Title: Automated Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Reverse Engineering via X-ray Tomography\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Domenic Forte, dforte@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): Kun Yang (k.yang@ufl.edu) and Joey Botero (jbot2016@ufl.edu)\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior, Senior; 2 students per term\n\nPrerequisites: Required: DIGITAL LOGIC & COMPUTER SYSTEMS, DIGITAL DESIGN; Recommended: Familiarity with any PCB design or CAD tool; familiarity with image processing, machine learning, and pattern recognition\n\nCredit: 0-3 credits via EGN 4912\n\nStipend: none unless selected for University Scholars\n\nApplication Requirements: Resume, unofficial transcripts, faculty interview, interest in graduate school encouraged; email all application requirements to Domenic Forte, dforte@ece.ufl.edu, to request an interview\n\nApplication Deadline: none\n\nWebsite: dforte.ece.ufl.edu\n\nProject Description: Reverse engineering (RE) of electronics can be both reassuring and concerning. globalization of IC and PCB industries has resulted in well-documented concerns such as counterfeiting and hardware Trojan insertion. For such instances, RE represents an important tool for validating the performance, quality, authenticity, and integrity of electronics. Similarly, many of the critical systems and infrastructures in use today are decades old. Maintaining them requires electronic components that are no longer available. Replacing or redesigning the entire system may be too time consuming or expensive. However, through RE one can study the particular component/board in order to reproduce it and/or replace it with an alternative in the legacy system. On the other hand, RE can be responsible for just as many threats as solutions. RE can also be exploited to generate unauthorized clones or find weaknesses in the system. As part of this project, students will analyze 3D images of PCBs and develop a tool that processes the image (assigns different pixel values to traces, vias, etc.), stiches together results, extracts the PCB netlist, and converts the resulting images/netlist into a CAD file. Students should be able to program/script in Matlab or similar language. Familiarity with PCB design tools and pattern recognition would be useful but is not required.\n\nProject Title:Hardware Security Primitive Design, Simulation, and Evaluation\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Domenic Forte, dforte@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): N/A\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior, Senior; 2 students per term\n\nPrerequisites: Digital Logic/Computer Systems or Electronic Circuits 1\n\nCredit: 0-3 credits via EGN 4912\n\nStipend: Depends on available resources unless selected for University Scholars\n\nApplication Requirements: Resume, unofficial transcripts, faculty interview, interest in graduate school encouraged; email all application requirements to Domenic Forte, dforte@ece.ufl.edu, to request an interview\n\nApplication Deadline: (preferred) March 1 for Summer, August 1 for Fall terms, and November 1 for the Spring term.\n\nWebsite: dforte.ece.ufl.edu\n\nProject Description: Integrated circuits(ICs) have access to more sensitive information (i.e., assets) than ever before. Such assets should be protected because their leakage can lead to fraud, extortion, and blackmail.

This project involves development of circuits and sensors to detect such attacks and destroy assets when they are under attack. Interested students should have interest or experience with one or more of the following: analog circuit design, digital circuit design, SPICE simulation, PCB design, VHDL/Verilog, FPGA development and programming, Matlab or Python programming, machine learning and classification, and lab measurements.

Packaging reliability has been discussed widely in both industry and academia. However, packaging security assessment is barely addressed in such communities. Malicious changes in packaging parameters by a manufacturer can result in undetected features that cause chip failure. This results in disastrous consequences when these changed chips go to critical applications such as space, military, hospitals, powerplants, etc. In this project, the first step is to understand the structure and material composition of different kinds of IC packaging. To achieve such understanding, the project involves evaluating the packaging with the physical inspection methods in our lab to see how the security vulnerabilities of IC packaging can be generated and exploited. Based on security issues, different kinds of protection methods will be developed later. One such attack vector is a backside attack, which is both cheap and simple. With a device as simple as a laser pointer, attackers can hack into the chips. By applying a certain wavelength laser on the chip backside, hackers can easily extract useful information or inject fault. This project aims to prevent this kind of attack happens. In the project, learning and understanding of backside attack will be the first step, and students will get a chance to do backside attacks by themselves in the lab. Based on their own background and knowledge, they can develop their own backside protection methods.\n\nProject Title #2: Automated Volumetric Analysis via X-Ray Computed Tomography\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Navid Asadi, nasadi@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): John True\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior or Senior; 2 students per term\n\nPrerequisites: Familiarity with Circuits 2, Image Processing, MATLAB or Python; Preferred: CAD Design, Machine Learning\n\nStipend: Limited OPS Positions Available\n\nApplication Requirements: Email Dr. Asadi with your resume; faculty interview required.\n\nApplication Deadline: N/A\n\nWebsite: nasadi.ece.ufl.edu\n\nProject Description: X-Ray Computed Tomography (X-Ray CT) is a rapidly advancing field due to the advent of next-generation tools such as Micro-CT & Nano-CT. In addition to hardware advances, there are software improvements that offer increased speed and resolution for fast failure analysis. Auto-3D is the refining and incorporation of these advanced techniques into the hardware assurance and reverse engineering processes and flows used in the cybersecurity industry. The current methods of hardware verification for microelectronics involves destructive techniques such as cross sectioning and delayering to analyze with visual methods. Non-destructive volumetric methods such as X-ray analysis has been adequate for simple electronics designs. However, smaller internal circuitry and its increasing complexity creates many x-ray imaging issues for non-destructive internal analysis. These imaging issues include artifacts such as photon starvation due to the entire absorption of x-rays by dense materials such as metals from circuitry, components, or heat/EMF shields. The Auto-3D project is focused on improving computational runtime speed and resolution of the reconstruction of 2D images into 3D volumes, optimizing the scan parameters of x-ray imaging for electronics through laboratory testing and computer simulation, and automated segmentation of 3D volumes and performing analysis of noise and errors via machine learning. As part of this project: students will work together to research and develop solutions, facilitate learning outcomes aligned with future academic research or industry requirements, build data-driven designs and proposals that improve upon known research in the field, and interact with F.I.C.S. faculty and facilities through presentations and lab experiments.\n\nProject Title #3: Automated Bill of Material Extraction\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Navid Asadi, nasadi@ece.ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): Nathan Jessurun and Olivia Paradis\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior or Senior; 2 students per term\n\nPrerequisites: Familiarity with any PCB design or CAD tool; image processing, computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition\n\nStipend: Limited\n\nApplication Requirements: Email Dr. Asadi with your resume; faculty interview required.\n\nApplication Deadline: N/A\n\nWebsite: nasadi.ece.ufl.edu\n\nProject Description: The goal of AutoBoM is to automatically extract a Bill of Materials (BoM), the list of all components on a printed circuit board (PCB) given an image of the board. The extracted BoM can then be used for reverse engineering and hardware assurance purposes. For instance, such a BoM can be compared to the known list of materials for the same sample, showing any discrepancy resulting from malicious tampering. When no reference BoM is present, verification becomes much more difficult. In these cases, AutoBoM can generate a tentative circuit schematic and cross-reference it against common design metrics. In these cases, Trojans or other manipulations will appear as violations to these standards. AutoBoM involves two primary research domains: the initial stages of image acquisition and preprocessing, followed by the use of machine learning models for component detection, classification, and identification.\n\nImage acquisition and processing inputs to the AutoBoM process include several 2D optical images of PCB surfaces. Various image processing and computer vision algorithms then extract information from these images necessary to train machine learning networks. Several subdomains are important in this stage to analyze the image data.\n\nImage segmentation, or breaking an image into distinct regions, assists in gathering ground truth data which trains machine learning models in how to detect components on a PCB image. Next, standard preprocessing procedures such as morphological processing, bandpass filtering, structural analysis, and more determine which portions of the image may require in-depth evaluation. This feedback serves two important functions. First, it determines which neural network architectures are appropriate for different stages of the AutoBoM process (e.g. component detection, defect analysis, etc.). Second, it assists in formatting the data as inputs to these networks, which speeds up learning and processing times.\n\nMachine learning models for detection, classification, identification Inputs to the machine learning side of the AutoBoM process include the important computer vision features extracted from the PCB images (e.g. colors, shapes, and textures). Then, a multi-stage machine learning methodology is applied. First, the machine learning algorithms detect the location of the components within the PCB images. Then, the algorithm determines the type of each component (e.g. resistor, capacitor, IC). Finally, AutoBoM leverages information such as on-component text, board text, and colors to uniquely identify each component. The end result is a BoM specific enough to purchase all required components necessary to reverse engineer the PCB.\n\nUndergraduate students interested in working in these areas should have knowledge of general image processing, computer vision, and machine learning procedures. Additionally, familiarity with array computing (e.g. broadcasting, GPU/CUDA arrays, etc.) in python is strongly desired.\n\nProject Title: Integrated Radio-Frequency Filters for 5G Wireless\n\nDepartment: Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nFaculty Mentor: Roozbeh Tabrizian, rtabrizian@ufl.edu\n\nPh.D. Student Mentor(s): Various\n\nTerms Available: Fall, Spring, Summer\n\nStudent Level: Junior or Senior; Number of Students Varies\n\nPrerequisites: Varies by project.

This project includes design and analysis chip-scale filters operating at ultra- and super-high frequencies. These filters are essential for operation of our smart-phones, by enabling secure access to wireless spectrum for high-speed data communication.\n\nThe filters are operating based on exciting low-loss mechanical resonance in nano-scale silicon structures.
