I am also the maintainer and co-author of the ChainLadder and googleVis packages and founder of the Bayesian Mixer Meetups and Insurance Data Science conference series.\n\nIn my spare time, I write this blog on data analysis related topics. Some articles are inspired by my packages and current work, other relate to my time at university and the remainder are really just random thoughts.\n\nOccasionally I speak about my work and when possible I make those presentations available on this blog. My talks are often about risk management, price monitoring, claims reserving, statistics, data analysis and dynamical systems."
