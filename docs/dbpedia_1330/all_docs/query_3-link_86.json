We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.\n\n††preprint: HEPHY-ML-24-01\n\nI Introduction\n\nDetector calibrations are one of the most important and foundational tasks in experimental physics. In particle and nuclear physics, the largest calibration step is usually a simulation-based correction to ensure that the reported properties of the measured particles are unbiased. Detector simulations are complex and accurate, but can only run forward in time and the resolutions are non-trivial. Combined, these properties mean that we cannot simply invert the simulation to predict true quantities given measured ones.\n\nThis is particularly acute for highly-segmented detectors where many individual channels are activated for a single particle as the measured phase space can be high dimensional and complex. A common example of this setting is calorimeter reconstruction. Unlike tracking detectors that aim to minimally disrupt the trajectory of a particle, calorimeters are designed to stop particles and the resulting showers inside dense materials are challenging to parse and are highly stochastic. Traditional calibration methods are optimized using relatively low-dimensional summary statistics. Such calibrations have enabled many science results, but the ultimate precision cannot be reached until we utilize all of the available low-level information for event reconstruction.\n\nMachine learning provides a set of tools that can analyze hadronic final states holistically to achieve the best precision. Recent examples supporting this claim include the energy calibrations of single hadrons [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], jets [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], and global event properties [22, 23, 24, 25] at colliders. These techniques can automatically make use of finer segmentation to improve the resolution of reconstructed particle energies [4, 10]. While machine learning has broader utility than reconstructing individual hadron showers within a calorimeter, we focus on this case because it is particularly challenging and a critical component of event reconstruction at the Large Hadron Collider and elsewhere.\n\nWhile existing machine learning methods are promising, most approaches have at least two undesirable features: they are only point estimates and are prior-dependent. Firstly, most approaches produce a single estimate without quantifying ‘uncertainties’. In particle/ nuclear physics, the spread of the difference between the inferred estimates and the true value is usually called the resolution, even though it is part of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in the broader machine learning literature. Secondly, techniques that employ standard machine learning regression tools are not universal: their performance depends on the distribution of examples (the ‘prior’, e.g. uniform in energy) used during training. In fact, this prior dependence often results in a large calibration bias.\n\nOver the last years, some partial solutions to these two central challenges have been proposed. Generalized numerical inversion [26, 27, 28] is a prior-independent calibration approach, although it does not scale well to many output dimensions. The Gaussian Ansatz [17, 18] is a local maximum likelihood estimator, and thus prior-independent (more in Sec. II). For UQ, loss functions can be modified to estimate quantiles in addition to just the mean, median or mode [13, 14] and deep generative models can estimate the exact resolution function [24, 25]. The Gaussian Ansatz produces a local estimate of the resolution and so is currently the only method that is both prior-independent and that goes beyond a point estimate. However, the Gaussian Ansatz only gives a Gaussian approximation of the resolution. We note that it is also possible to use Bayesian versions [29, 30, 31, 32, 33] of neural networks to go beyond point estimates by providing the uncertainty of the output. However, the uncertainty would still be prior-dependent.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a prior-independent method for detector calibrations that produces per-shower resolution estimates. The approach is based on deep generative models with access to the explicit likelihood. In particular, we use normalizing flows [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. These machine learning models are invertible functions with a tractable Jacobian so that one can be used for both sampling and density estimation. The core idea behind a normalizing flow is that one starts with a simple random variable with a known probability density (e.g. a Gaussian) and then applies a series of transformations with the tractable Jacobian. This results in a complex probability density that can also be computed via the change of variables formula. The probability density can be made conditional by letting each transformation depend on the conditional quantity.\n\nNormalizing flows are state-of-the-art as calorimeter simulation surrogate models [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. Additionally, normalizing flows have shown similar good performance in other tasks in high-energy physics [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 33, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 24, 63, 64, 65, 66, 24, 25, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72]. In this paper, we unify simulation and inference by showing how models trained for generation can be reused for calibration. As a demonstration of this approach, we use CaloFlow [42, 43], a normalizing flow-based calorimeter surrogate model. This machine learning model is trained on single-pion showers from an extended version [73] of the CaloGAN dataset [74, 75, 76] that now includes both a sampling calorimeter setup [77] and a hadronic component. The calibration task is to predict the incident pion energy given the distribution of energies recorded in the cells of the calorimeter. Importantly, we demonstrate the following key advantages of our approach:\n\n1.\n\nZero-shot calibration:\n\nNormalizing flow-based models trained for surrogate modelling can be reused for calibration by repurposing the probability density as a likelihood without any additional model retrainings.\n\n2.\n\nAccess to per-shower resolution:\n\nWith access to the complete likelihood, we can compute the exact resolution function. This allows us to obtain per-shower resolution estimates which give us additional information about how close the predicted energy is to the true energy. Furthermore, it enables us to estimate asymmetries in the resolution function (not possible with the GA).\n\n3.\n\nLess biased calibration:\n\nWe achieve a smaller calibration bias compared to a typical direct regression approach for the calorimeter setup considered in this work.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. Machine learning-based calibration methods are introduced in Sec. II. Here we also provide precise definitions for bias and resolution used in this paper. In Sec. III, we summarize the CaloFlow algorithm and discuss the results of the calorimeter example which demonstrate the key advantages listed above. The paper ends with conclusions and outlook in Sec. IV. We collect some details on the used network architectures in an appendix.\n\nII Methods\n\nGiven samples from a forward model (usually a physics-based simulation) X∼pX|Z⁢(x|z)similar-to𝑋subscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍conditional𝑥𝑧X\\sim p_{X|Z}(x|z)italic_X ∼ italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_z ) for measured values X𝑋Xitalic_X and true values Z𝑍Zitalic_Z, the goal of calibration is to estimate Z𝑍Zitalic_Z from X𝑋Xitalic_X. In our notation, capital letters represent random variables and lower case letters represent realizations of those random variables. Both the measured and true values can be multidimensional, although we will focus on the common case where Z𝑍Zitalic_Z is one dimensional and X∈ℝN𝑋superscriptℝ𝑁X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N}italic_X ∈ blackboard_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_N end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.\n\nThe usual assumption when deriving a simulation-based calibration is that the detector response is correct and universal, i.e. pX|Ztrain⁢(x|z)=pX|Ztest⁢(x|z)superscriptsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍trainconditional𝑥𝑧superscriptsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍testconditional𝑥𝑧p_{X|Z}^{\\text{train}}(x|z)=p_{X|Z}^{\\text{test}}(x|z)italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_z ) = italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT test end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_z ) for different physics processes (i.e. different p⁢(z)𝑝𝑧p(z)italic_p ( italic_z )) or for actual data.\n\n1.\n\nThe bias of a calibration is the deviation between the central tendency of the inferred estimate z^^𝑧\\hat{z}over^ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG and the true reference value z𝑧zitalic_z. Any measure of central tendency can be used to measure closure, such as the median or mode. In this paper, we will focus on the mode of the inferred estimates given a fixed z𝑧zitalic_z value. To compute the mode in practice, for a given z𝑧zitalic_z, we look at K𝐾Kitalic_K measured values x1,x2⁢…⁢xKsubscript𝑥1subscript𝑥2…subscript𝑥𝐾x_{1},x_{2}\\dots x_{K}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT … italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT corresponding to that z𝑧zitalic_z. Each measured value xisubscript𝑥𝑖x_{i}italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT undergoes calibration to derive an inferred estimate z^isubscript^𝑧𝑖\\hat{z}_{i}over^ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. The mode is subsequently determined based on the collection of inferred estimates {z^1,z^2,…,z^K}subscript^𝑧1subscript^𝑧2…subscript^𝑧𝐾\\{\\hat{z}_{1},\\hat{z}_{2},\\dots,\\hat{z}_{K}\\}{ over^ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , over^ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , … , over^ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K end_POSTSUBSCRIPT }.\n\n2.\n\nThe resolution is the spread of the difference between the inferred estimates and the true value. In this work, we have two relevant definitions:\n\n•\n\nFull resolution: For fixed z𝑧zitalic_z, it is defined as half of the 68% confidence interval about the mode of a collection of inferred estimates.\n\n•\n\nPer-event resolution: For each x𝑥xitalic_x, it is defined as half of the 68% confidence interval of the corresponding maximum likelihood estimate (see Sec. II.2).\n\nThe full resolution is not to be confused with the per-event resolution. The full resolution is defined for a collection of inferred estimates, whereas the per-event resolution is defined for each inferred estimate.\n\nII.1 Direct Regression\n\nMost proposals for deep learning-based calibration directly regress Z𝑍Zitalic_Z from X𝑋Xitalic_X using a loss function like the mean-squared error (MSE):\n\nL⁢[f]=∑i(fMSE⁢(xi)−zi)2,𝐿delimited-[]𝑓subscript𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑓MSEsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑧𝑖2\\displaystyle L[f]=\\sum_{i}(f_{\\rm MSE}(x_{i})-z_{i})^{2}\\,,italic_L [ italic_f ] = ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_MSE end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , (1)\n\nfor a neural network fMSEsubscript𝑓MSEf_{\\rm MSE}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_MSE end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Using the calculus of variations, one can show that with enough training data and sufficiently flexible neural network architecture and training protocol, the solution to Eq. 1 is the average value of Z𝑍Zitalic_Z given X=x𝑋𝑥X=xitalic_X = italic_x:\n\nfMSE⁢(x)subscript𝑓MSE𝑥\\displaystyle f_{\\rm MSE}(x)italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_MSE end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x ) =⟨Z|X=x⟩absentinner-product𝑍𝑋𝑥\\displaystyle=\\langle Z|X=x\\rangle= ⟨ italic_Z | italic_X = italic_x ⟩ (2) =∫𝑑z⁢z⁢pZ|Xtrain⁢(z|x)absentdifferential-d𝑧𝑧superscriptsubscript𝑝conditional𝑍𝑋trainconditional𝑧𝑥\\displaystyle=\\int dz\\,z\\,p_{Z|X}^{\\text{train}}(z|x)= ∫ italic_d italic_z italic_z italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z | italic_X end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_z | italic_x ) (3) =∫𝑑z⁢z⁢pX|Ztrain⁢(x|z)⁢pZtrain⁢(z)pXtrain⁢(x).absentdifferential-d𝑧𝑧superscriptsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍trainconditional𝑥𝑧superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑍train𝑧superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑋train𝑥\\displaystyle=\\int dz\\,z\\,p_{X|Z}^{\\text{train}}(x|z)\\,\\frac{p_{Z}^{\\text{% train}}(z)}{p_{X}^{\\text{train}}(x)}\\,.= ∫ italic_d italic_z italic_z italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_z ) divide start_ARG italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_z ) end_ARG start_ARG italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic_x ) end_ARG . (4)\n\nNote that fMSEsubscript𝑓MSEf_{\\rm MSE}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_MSE end_POSTSUBSCRIPT only gives a point estimate of z𝑧zitalic_z for each x𝑥xitalic_x and does not have access to per-event resolutions. In other words, there is no calibration uncertainty quantified by fMSEsubscript𝑓MSEf_{\\rm MSE}italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_MSE end_POSTSUBSCRIPT.\n\nFor a given z𝑧zitalic_z, the bias can be computed as the deviation between z𝑧zitalic_z and the mode of a collection of fMSE⁢(xi)subscript𝑓MSEsubscript𝑥𝑖f_{\\rm MSE}(x_{i})italic_f start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_MSE end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), and the full resolution at z𝑧zitalic_z is then computed based on the 68% confidence interval about the mode. Note that the bias is defined as a function of z𝑧zitalic_z. Hence, we cannot correct for this bias as we do not have access to z𝑧zitalic_z while performing the calibration.\n\nThe challenge with Eq. 4 is that it depends on pZtrainsuperscriptsubscript𝑝𝑍trainp_{Z}^{\\text{train}}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT train end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT even when we assume that the detector response is universal. Unsurprisingly then, the bias of direct regression also depends on the training dataset. In Ref. [18], the prior dependence of MSE-based calibration is shown to be the main source of large calibration bias.\n\nII.2 Maximum Likelihood Inference\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) involves finding the Z𝑍Zitalic_Z that maximizes the likelihood of the data,\n\nZ^=argmax𝑧⁢pX|Z⁢(X|z).^𝑍𝑧argmaxsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍conditional𝑋𝑧\\hat{Z}=\\underset{z}{\\text{argmax}}\\,p_{X|Z}(X|z)\\,.over^ start_ARG italic_Z end_ARG = underitalic_z start_ARG argmax end_ARG italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_X | italic_z ) . (5)\n\nSince we assume that pX|Zsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍p_{X|Z}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is universal and Eq. 5 only depends on this likelihood, then Z^^𝑍\\hat{Z}over^ start_ARG italic_Z end_ARG is universal. We can go beyond the point estimate and use the likelihood function pX|Zsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍p_{X|Z}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to obtain the per-event resolution for each maximum likelihood estimate z^^𝑧\\hat{z}over^ start_ARG italic_z end_ARG. The access to per-event resolutions is a major advantage of MLE over direct regression in calibration. Examples showcasing this advantage are discussed in Sec. III.4.\n\nSimilar to the direct regression case, the bias and full resolution at a fixed z𝑧zitalic_z value can be defined based on the mode and 68% confidence interval about the mode.\n\nAlthough the MLE-based calibration is always prior-independent, the prior dependence does not guarantee that the method is always unbiased. Only in certain scenarios (e.g. 1D Gaussian noise model such that pX|Z⁢(x|z)∼N⁢(z,σ)similar-tosubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍conditional𝑥𝑧𝑁𝑧𝜎p_{X|Z}(x|z)\\sim N(z,\\sigma)italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_x | italic_z ) ∼ italic_N ( italic_z , italic_σ )) can the MLE calibration be shown to be unbiased. Certain detector responses pX|Zsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍p_{X|Z}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT may result in biased calibration. In general, prior independence is a necessary but insufficient condition for unbiased calibration. Even so, we show in Sec. III.3 that MLE-based calibration results in a smaller bias compared to direct regression for an ATLAS-like calorimeter setup. This suggests that in our application, the dependence on training prior is a bigger contributing factor to the bias than the detector response.\n\nAlso, the challenge with MLE is that we usually do not know pX|Zsubscript𝑝conditional𝑋𝑍p_{X|Z}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_X | italic_Z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT explicitly. Nevertheless, we are able to sample from this conditional density by running a simulation. The Gaussian Ansatz [17, 18] approaches this problem by estimating the likelihood locally around the mode with a clever neural network parameterization and learning rate schedule. In this work, we instead aim to learn the entire likelihood using a neural network — an approach sometimes referred to as neural likelihood estimation in the simulation-based inference literature [78, 79, 80, 81]. This is substantially more work, but we observe that the work may already be done: given a fast simulation based on neural networks with access to the likelihood, we can use it for calibration in addition to generation without requiring any additional retraining.\n\nOur tool of choice is the normalizing flow (NF). NFs are neural networks that are optimized using maximum likelihood estimation. With access to an estimate of the full likelihood, we can study both Gaussian and non-Gaussian aspects of the resolution.\n\nIV Conclusions\n\nWe compared the calibration performance of CaloFlow and a DNN direct regression model on π+superscript𝜋\\pi^{+}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT calorimeter showers from our new sampling calorimeter dataset [73], and found that the direct regression method is clearly more biased relative to the flow-based calibration method. This highlights the advantage of utilizing prior-independent MLE-based calibration for tasks such as particle energy regression.\n\nWe demonstrate a second advantage of using a MLE-based calibration methods over direct regression by estimating per-shower resolutions. The average estimated per-shower resolution obtained from CaloFlow closely aligns with the full resolution. In contrast, the direct regression approach yields only point estimates and lacks the capacity to make per-shower resolution predictions. For CaloFlow, we found that smaller per-shower resolutions tend to coincide with more accurately calibrated showers. This is evidence that the per-shower resolutions from CaloFlow are reliable and have the potential to be leveraged for improved calibration. Notably, utilizing a NF for calibration grants access to the complete resolution function, a feature inaccessible in previous methods like the Gaussian Ansatz. This characteristic enables the NF to capture asymmetries in the resolution, thereby expected to confer an advantage over the Gaussian Ansatz in specific calibration tasks. In future work, it would be interesting to study how the per-shower resolution information obtained by the NF can be utilized to further improve the calibration.\n\nData and code availability\n\nThe datasets used in this study can be found at Ref.

[42, 43] for more details). There are some differences compared to the implementation in the original CaloFlow papers [42, 43], but most of main algorithm remains the same. One main difference is that only Flow-I is used in this study.\n\nThe flows used in this work are Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs) [92] with compositions of Rational Quadratic Splines (RQS) [93] as transformations. The RQS transformations are parameterized using neural networks known as MADE blocks [94]. Identical flow architectures are used in each of the two cases with uniformly and log-uniformly distributed Eincsubscript𝐸incE_{\\rm inc}italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_inc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Each flow consists of six MADE blocks, each with two hidden layers of 64 nodes. The RQS transformations are defined with 8 bins and a tail bound of 14.\n\nThe incident energy of the incoming photon is preprocessed as\n\nEinc→log10⁡(Einc/10⁢GeV).→subscript𝐸incsubscript10subscript𝐸inc10GeVE_{\\text{inc}}\\to\\log_{10}(E_{\\text{inc}}/10\\ \\text{GeV})\\,.italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT inc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → roman_log start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT inc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / 10 GeV ) . (6)\n\nThe layer energies are preprocessed as\n\nEi→2⁢(log10⁡(Ei+1⁢keV)−1).→subscript𝐸𝑖2subscript10subscript𝐸𝑖1keV1E_{i}\\to 2\\left(\\log_{10}(E_{i}+1\\ \\text{keV})-1\\right)\\,.italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT → 2 ( roman_log start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + 1 keV ) - 1 ) . (7)\n\nThe index i𝑖iitalic_i denotes the layer number. In the original CaloFlow, a different preprocessing was used for the layer energies Eisubscript𝐸𝑖E_{i}italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in Flow-I where Eisubscript𝐸𝑖E_{i}italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT were transformed to unit-space (see [42]).\n\nUniform noise in the range [0,0.1] keV was applied to the voxel energies during training and evaluation. The same range was used for the pion dataset in [44]. The range of uniform noise used in the original CaloFlow [42, 43] was [0,1] keV. The addition of noise was found to prevent the flow from fitting unimportant features. The training of flows in this work is optimized using independent Adam optimizers [87]. The flows were trained by minimizing −log⁡p1⁢(E→|Einc)subscript𝑝1conditional→𝐸subscript𝐸inc-\\log p_{1}(\\vec{E}|E_{\\text{inc}})- roman_log italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( over→ start_ARG italic_E end_ARG | italic_E start_POSTSUBSCRIPT inc end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) for 150 epochs with a batch size of 200. The initial learning of 10−4superscript10410^{-4}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT was chosen and a multi-step learning schedule was used when training the flow which halves the learning rate after each selected epoch milestone during the training.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] L. de Oliveira, B.
