You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED: The streaming devices and smart TV company disclosed a data breach impacting over 15,000 customers. The threat actors used a credential-stuffing attack to breach the customers' accounts. Once the accounts were breached, the threat actor could change the information on the account, including the password and email addresses. Researchers found that successfully hacked accounts were sold on the dark web for 50 cents. Roku recommends that account holders impacted by the attack must visit \"my.roku.com\" and click on 'Forgot password?' to get a reset link on their email.\n\nSENSCY'S ANALYSIS: A credential-stuffing attack is an attack where threat actors use automated scripts or bots to try large numbers of usernames and password combinations obtained from previous data breaches or leaks. The goal is to find a valid login credential that grants access to a user account on the targeted platform, in this case, Roku. Once the threat actors have access to the account, they likely use the information on the account, including the stored credit card information, to commit financial fraud, spamming, or further data breaches. These attacks can severely affect users and organizations, leading to compromised personal data, potential financial loss, and damaged reputation. To avoid and mitigate these credential-stuffing attacks, users must use unique, strong passwords for each online account and enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible. In addition, organizations should implement security measures such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA challenges, and monitoring for brute force attacks.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED: In a notice of Data Privacy Incident, Greensboro College confirmed that a cyber incident impacted the privacy of “certain information.” According to the notice, the College detected potential malicious activity in its computer system. After launching an investigation, “the investigation determined that certain computer systems were subject to unauthorized access between August 10, 2023, and August 21, 2023.” The leaked data may include name, Social Security number, driver’s license or state identification number, financial account information, date of birth, passport number, medical information, and health insurance information.\n\nSENSCY'S ANALYSIS: Like many other organizations, colleges may detect malicious activity in their systems months after they were compromised due to several factors. One of the primary factors SensCy observed with Colleges and Universities is the insufficient monitoring of systems. Some colleges may not have robust monitoring systems to detect unusual or malicious activity promptly. Without continuous monitoring of network traffic, system logs, and user activity, threat actors who comprise the systems may go unnoticed for extended periods. The second most common factor is a slow response to unusual activities. Even if colleges detect suspicious activity, their response processes may be slow due to bureaucratic hurdles, lack of clear incident response plans, or delays in decision-making. This slow response can allow attackers to maintain access to compromised systems for an extended period, exacerbating the damage. Finally, due to the overload and increasing expectations for IT staff, college and university employees may only be aware of security breaches once they receive reports from external sources, such as law enforcement agencies, security researchers, or affected individuals. When they become aware of the breach, malicious activity may have been ongoing for months. To address these challenges, Sency recommends that colleges and universities invest in cybersecurity training, resources, and technologies to detect and respond promptly to security incidents. This includes implementing robust monitoring systems, conducting regular security assessments, internal and external scanning, fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, and establishing clear incident response protocols.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED: The financial services firm Paysign opened an investigation into claims that one of its databases was impacted by a data breach last week. The database investigated contains over 1.2 million customer records. The claims arose after a threat actor was observed selling the database allegedly belonging to Paysign on the dark web. The threat actors, under the alias “emo,” claim that the breach occurred on March 6, 2024. Less than a year ago, Paysign partnered with Mastercard to collaborate on product development.\n\nSENSCY'S ANALYSIS: While hackers will sometimes claim false data breaches to increase their notoriety and reputation, or simply to create a sense of fear in the alleged victim, most established threat actors do provide samples of data when announcing a breach. While we await the confirmation or denial of the breach, we can already anticipate the potential repercussions of a data breach of this magnitude. Since Paysign is a card payment solutions provider and integrated payment processor, the data breach could likely impact organizations using Paysign for its services. In addition, any financial firm suffering a data breach on its database will suffer direct financial losses, including costs associated with the investigation of the incident, notifying the impacted customers, providing free credit monitoring, legal actions, fines, and potential sanctions by regulatory authorities. Breached financial data, including account numbers, Social Security numbers, and payment card details, can be used by threat actors to commit identity theft, and financial fraud, putting customers at a significant risk of financial losses and other forms of cybercrime. More details and information are expected over the next few days. If you are a Paysign customer, please monitor your accounts and ensure you implemented simple security measures like changing passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication."
