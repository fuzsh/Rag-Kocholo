        "text": "Hacken Lee Hak Kan (Chinese: 李克勤; Cantonese Yale: Lei5 Hak1kan4; pinyin: Lǐ Kèqín, is a Hong Kong singer, television host and actor, active since the 1980s. In 2013, Lee's song \"House of Cards\" swept multiple awards in many Hong Kong award ceremonies, including \"World's Best Song\" and \"Broadcasting Index\" in Metro's Awards. As of 2013, he has reached 14 times in receiving the \"Outstanding Pop Singer Award\" at RTHK's \"Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Awards\" and has established an irreplaceable status in the music industry of Hong Kong and Asia.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years: 1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nLee was brought up in a middle-class family. He lived in Arts Mansion in Happy Valley during his teenage years. He studied in Pun U Association Primary School (1974-1980) and Wah Yan College, Hong Kong (1980-1987).\n\nAfter his HKCEE[1] in 1985, he entered the TVB new talent show along with Alex To, William So, Vivian Chow and Grasshopper, though he was unable to make it into the top 15 finalists. He then participated in the Second Hong Kong 19 District Singing Contest in 1985, a competition which he won with his rendition of Alan Tam's song \"Love in the Fog\" (霧之戀). He was subsequently offered a contract with PolyGram Records.[2]\n\nLee however continued his studies at Wah Yan College while singing part-time. He turned full-time in the summer of 1987 after failing to gain a university place due to poor HKALE[3] results.\n\nHis debut EP Hacken Lee EP sold less than 10,000 copies. Symbol of Destiny was released in 1987. His musical popularity lacking, he gained recognition by starring in TVB dramas in the late 1980s, especially the youth drama series \"Teenage No More\" (不再少年時), for which he also sang the theme song. In 1989, his song \"Unchanged in Lifetime\", the theme song of ATV's Cantonese version of the drama series \"Blue Moon,\" won both the RTHK \"Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs Awards\" and \"TVB Jade Solid Gold Awards.\"\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, Lee, Jacky Cheung and Andy Lau were dubbed as \"Three Musketeers in the music industry\" by the media and were hailed as \"tomorrow's highly anticipated superstars\".[citation needed] Later on that year, however, due to the contract disputes between Hacken and his company, Hacken's career faltered.\n\nIn 1992, Lee's career began to rise when he released the song \"Red Sun\" (紅日), for which he penned the Chinese lyrics that made it popular. In 1993, Hacken switched to Star Record Company and released the song \"Look Back,\" which once again boosted his singing career and allowed him to win TVB Jade Solid Gold's Golden Award as well as reach the top five nominees for the Most Popular Singer Award. His first solo concert at Hong Kong Coliseum, later that year, sold out in just a few hours.[2]\n\nIn 1994, Lee was crowned the title of \"Zero Defect Vocals,\"[4] alongside Jacky Cheung who was named \"Perfect Vocals\" the year before, and as well as the successor of the famous Alan Tam, whom Hacken idolized since he was little.[5]\n\nIn 1995, after the unprecedented success of his first solo concert, Hacken was full of confidence to hold his second concert again at Hong Kong Coliseum, \"Dragon '95 Hacken's Contact of Hear Concert\", total of 10 days. But the box office was very poor unfortunately, the worst situation was less than 40% attendance figures. This experience also is one of the most embarrassing things in his singing career. His momentum continued to decline after the concert, together with contractual disputes between the record company, and Hacken's singing career started to fall in a trough.\n\nIn 1996, Lee was signed on to another company where he issued the album \"When I Found You\" (當找到你), with which sales and popularity seemed to be improved slightly. However, due to several personnel changes and contractual disputes, since they released the album \"By Hacken Side\" (在克勤身邊), his career became stalled, even the new album was postponed indefinitely.\n\nIn summer 1998, Lee was chaired as TVB for World Cup association football's sportscaster, and he composed and sang the song for the program, \"Adventure of football fans\", which song was popular though streets and lanes; the record company launched a selection album by this momentum. As an avid Manchester United fan, he also is the chairperson and president of its Hong Kong Fan Club. He also penned a public outcry against embattled former manager David Moyes on Hacken's personal Weibo.\n\nAfter the contract was expired with the record company, Lee had quite a long period when he could not find a suitable recording company; he fought in TV media from singing career, filming drama and hosting TV programs, such as Jade Solid Gold, to maintain popularity.\n\nIn late 1999, when Lee had been under no music contract for more than 12 months, he signed to Universal Music (former PolyGram) and issued his album \"A Year Or So\". In December, he had a musical performance with the Hong Kong Repertory, named \"Adventure\". This musical perform across the centuries, welcoming the coming of millennium.\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter signing with Universal Music, Lee released songs including \"Feet of Fortune\" (前後腳), \"I Won't Sing\" (我不會唱歌) and \"The Grasp of Love\" (愛不釋手) in 2001.\n\nIn late 2001, Lee performed in collaboration with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, \"Hong Kong Philharmonic & Hacken Live\", organised total in 4 concerts and 2 additional concerts.

He also won his first Most Popular Male Singer in TVB Jade Solid Gold Award.\n\nIn 2003, 2004 and 2009, Lee partnered with Alan Tam in a series of concert tours around the world, including multiple shows in Hong Kong and Las Vegas. Known in English as \"Alan & Hacken\", the show's Chinese title, \"左麟右李\", is a play on the Chinese four-character idiom \"左鄰右里\" which means \"neighbor\", by using the artists' names homonyms 麟 and 李. By the end of 2003, Hacken won the Most Popular Male Singer in TVB Jade Solid Gold Award\" for the second time.\n\nIn November 2004, Lee partnered with Joey Yung in a collaboration of a concert, which is better known by another four-character idiom \"刻不容緩 (Urgency cannot afford delay)\", once again using their names homonyms 克 and 容.
