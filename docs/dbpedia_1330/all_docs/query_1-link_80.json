Thanks for joining all the way from Spain. Great to have you on the show.\n\n[00:02:18] Peter Jansen: It's an absolute pleasure to be here. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.\n\n[00:02:21] Hala Taha: So you work with clients on a lot of different areas from biohacking to emotional intelligence, to leadership, to MLM coaching, which stands for multilevel marketing, right?\n\n[00:02:32] Peter Jansen: Yes.\n\n[00:02:32] Hala Taha: What's the common theme in all of these elements. How do you link them in your coaching?\n\n[00:02:36] Peter Jansen: It's all actually about one simple thing. It's leading through emotional intelligence is in biohacking is being able to take control over your biological systems, right? That includes your mind, your neurology and MLMs.\n\n[00:02:50] These are companies that are very social. They do a lot of social selling, and one of the things that's very important for them is to develop leadership with intent. [00:03:00] And everything has to be done through emotional intelligence, because before the two thousands leadership was not really about other people was a lot about, the person who was leading right now.\n\n[00:03:11] We're changing things. Leadership has to have empathy in order for it to be transforming. That's why it's so the one link there is leading through emotional intelligence.\n\n[00:03:20] Hala Taha: Yeah. And emotional intelligence is such a hot topic. I think we'll touch on it later in the interview if we have time. So let's move on to some of these topics.\n\n[00:03:28] You referenced a very old adage in a recent Forbes article. In fact, this quote has so much history in iterations that I couldn't find the author behind it. I'm sure most of our listeners out there have heard a version of it. And again, This watch your thoughts. They become your words, watch your words.\n\n[00:03:44] They become your actions. Watch your actions. They become your habits. Watch your habits. They become your character. Watch your character for it becomes your destiny. So I'd like you to talk about our thoughts. Could you elaborate on why our thoughts are so powerful and [00:04:00] why you've spent a large portion of your life perfecting the way that you think?\n\n[00:04:03] Peter Jansen: For starters. I don't think we're ever going to get to a perfection the way we think. Thoughts are very complex. So we have between 60 and 90,000 thoughts per day. Now, because of the way that the species has evolved. This is important and it's important that we always start analyzing things around us.\n\n[00:04:25] And it's really about 80% of these thoughts are negative. They're negative because we analyze things around us expecting the worst, because we're expecting the lion to come from behind. We're expecting a collapse of land. We would just probably end up in a sinkhole or something, expecting a baby to cry so we can go and save it or feed it, things like this.\n\n[00:04:43] So we are always expecting this danger, this negativity. And of course now we don't have all those dangers, but we still have those thoughts, and we can't really control them. So thoughts are powerful, especially if you are able to control them and [00:05:00] direct them, point them in the right direction. That's the important thing right now.\n\n[00:05:05] And the reason is because your thoughts do eventually become your destiny.\n\n[00:05:11] Hala Taha: Yeah. So I think something that will really set the stage here is actually a very unfortunate accident that happened to you at a gym. Where you injured your head and you literally needed to control your thoughts to ensure your future.\n\n[00:05:24] Could you just walk our listeners through that tough time? Tell us how that experience changed you as a person and why it helped you appreciate your thoughts.\n\n[00:05:33] Peter Jansen: This was in 2005. I was in England, living in London at the time. And the cable crossover machine fell on my head. Now, if you know how a gym is set up, you have mirrors everywhere.\n\n[00:05:46] So the trauma of actually seeing this happen to you is much worse than the actual blue. But I saw the machine falling and I was helpless. It landed on my head. [00:06:00] It cracked my skull. It broke my L two. And in that moment I just thought. Oh, how am I going to survive this? And the moment I asked that one question, things changed.\n\n[00:06:15] The woman asked that question out of magically really very quickly. The answer was we have to stay awake. How do I stay with. You need to do mathematical calculations. So I don't know if my mathematical calculations, were accurate or not. If they were a stroke of genius or a stroke of, randomness, we don't know, but I started messing around with the Pascal triangle and fever and Nachi sequence and all these things in my head.\n\n[00:06:41] And that kept me awake and it kept me away, but I kept on thinking other things. And one of the things I thought is how am I going to use this later, because I started getting bored with my numbers and it was just, how am I going to use this later? How can I help people? My life has always been since I was a little kid about [00:07:00] helping others about transforming the world.\n\n[00:07:03] But at that moment, it just really hit home. And when I started asking myself, how can I use this? And then how can they use this to help us? Things changed. My business changed. My life changed. The doctors eventually told me that I was never going to walk again, or at least not the same. And I was never going to read and write again, but thanks to my thought processes.\n\n[00:07:28] And of course, biohacking, I was able to go from that to climbing Mount Keilly, climbing multiple. Surfing again, skiing again, writing books and reading 1,500 words per minute. So I remember sitting there with the doctors and my mother was next to me. And when the doctors gave us the news. I said, I understand that this is what you experience in your day to day in situations like this.\n\n[00:07:59] But [00:08:00] if you don't mind, I'm going to choose my own reality. And I did.\n\n[00:08:05] Hala Taha: In relation to that. You talk a lot about change and how you must take control of your thoughts to change. So how did you make all these positive changes? What was it that you did to control your thoughts?\n\n[00:08:19] Peter Jansen: I asked myself questions and I asked them in the right way.\n\n[00:08:24] It's a simple as that. The only way to direct your thoughts is through questions, but I'll give you an example. You see somebody and you don't remember their name. Now you might have company and that's really embarrassing. Cause you don't remember that person's name. Where you know them from and you remember the conversation and everything, but in your head, you ask yourself one question. It's oh, what's her name?\n\n[00:08:51] So you're not able to introduce her to your friend and you'll say Alice, this is and of course they noticed this, but we still try to [00:09:00] pretend that they're not noticing. So we're still asking ourselves this question, cause now we're under pressure and they might start a conversation and you don't even listen.\n\n[00:09:10] You're completely in your head trying to think. What's this person's name? What's her name. And then that person leaves, you keep on having a conversation with your friend and an hour later, a day later, you all of a sudden remember that person's name as it happened to you?\n\n[00:09:27] Hala Taha: Yeah.\n\n[00:09:27] Peter Jansen: So the problem here is that you ask yourself the question.\n\n[00:09:31] So you stopped focusing on the conversation that was occurring, right that minute. And because you asked yourself that question. Your brain started focusing, its power in the process of answering it. Now. You might have forgotten about the situation, but it's still working its magic in the background. It's still occupying mental real estate.\n\n[00:09:59] And then [00:10:00] all of a sudden. Oh, I remember her name and then you stop thinking about it. The same thing happens with songs and stuff like that. If that kind of thing happens to you. It's really good just to say, okay, I'm really sorry. I even know where I know you're from, I know the conversations we've had and I'm just really struggling to remember your name.\n\n[00:10:17] And I'll probably ask you five times in the future, what it is. So I hope you can accept that. And what's your name? Because then it doesn't occupy that real estate and you can use your mind for other things. But the same thing happens when you ask yourself a question. When something happens to you. So let's say something negative happens.\n\n[00:10:38] It could be anything just put in your head. Like in my case, it was that accident. So when, think of a time when something bad happened and the questions you asked yourself. If you ask yourself a question why me your subconscious mind is going to try to answer that question and it's usually going to justify why you. So it's usually going to be because you're worthless because you're not good enough.\n\n[00:10:59] [00:11:00] And all those fears come into play. But if, instead of that, you ask yourself a question. How can I learn from this? Or how can I use this? Or how can this empower. Then the same process will be used to find the answers of how you can use this productively.\n\n[00:11:22] Hala Taha: So it's really about getting a clear head, and a previous guest that we've had David Allen on this show talks about this a lot.\n\n[00:11:29] He also mentioned to close these open loops that go on your head. You've got to write everything down. So how do you feel about writing down anything, that's going on in your life, your projects or tasks in order to just get them out of your head? So you can focus.\n\n[00:11:43] Peter Jansen: I'm looking at three different Kanban boards.\n\n[00:11:47] Hala Taha: Can you explain what a Kanban board is to our listeners? For those who might not know.\n\n[00:11:51] Peter Jansen: Kanban board is an agile tool. So it's what we call a pool system. It's a board like a white board with different [00:12:00] columns and different what we call swim lanes, now on the columns and she just, basically, in my case, I have a gets to do list.\n\n[00:12:05] I don't say to do, because I'm alive. I get to do stuff at home. And then I have my doing done. And then after that, I just have defined and measure, analyze, improve, and control and update and what I do. As I put post-it notes of the things that I get to do, and I make sure that my post-it notes always traveled from left to right.\n\n[00:12:28] Always. So every time I have an idea or something. I'll put it in my gets to do, because I want to get to do my ideas and I put them there. And when I get around to have enough, when I have enough time to do them. I'll just put them on to doing it. I just do my stuff. When I'm done, that's great. They go with the done at night.\n\n[00:12:47] Everything that gets done, I put into that define and measure columns. I define whatever happens there. I've measured my results. Then I switched them up to the analyze and improve one. And this is six Sigma. Yeah. And then control and[00:13:00] update because all my camp end points are put into one system. I personally use Trello, but I put them into one system, so that I know, and my team knows what I'm doing, what I'm thinking.\n\n[00:13:09] And I'm very transparent about it. And leading through an agile process is really cool and it's really easy.\n\n[00:13:16] Hala Taha: Yeah. So staying on this topic, like I mentioned, David Allen talks about the concept of being present. And you previously mentioned an interesting statistic. That we have 60 to 90,000 thoughts per day.\n\n[00:13:29] 93% are repeated from the previous day. 93% will be repeated the following day and out of all of these thoughts, 80% of our negative 50%, our daydreams. And so if this is true, we spend very little time in the present. And so it's super important to know. Focused and present and into a control and flow state.\n\n[00:13:49] So what are your like hacks, like your concrete tips that we can do tomorrow to get into better focus?\n\n[00:13:55] Peter Jansen: Yes, totally. Why don't you can do right now.\n\n[00:13:57] Hala Taha: Sure.\n\n[00:13:58] Peter Jansen: Breathe. If you [00:14:00] focus your attention on your breath. You become very present because considering there's past, present and future, when did you breathe in those times. You can only breathe into now.\n\n[00:14:13] It's as simple as that. My trick is to inhale quickly and exhale very slowly. So this is when I really need to focus in the now and I need to do it right this very second, but I follow the Wim Hof method of breathing. So there's different techniques. That I'm happy to share it actually, you can find them on some of my Facebook lives.\n\n[00:14:38] I do a lot of Facebook lives about breathing and being present. And it's really very simple because the slower you breathe, the more centered you are with the now, and the more centered you are in the now. The less chatter you're going to have in your mind. It's as simple as that, [00:15:00] you want to get clear, get them to now, you want to get to the now brief slowly.\n\n[00:15:04] It is as simple as that. Just breathe slowly.\n\n[00:15:07] Hala Taha: Cool. Cool tip. And you have a thought routine. Can you explain what a thought routine is? And maybe some elements of a really good one.\n\n[00:15:16] Peter Jansen: So first get present. What I have is I have a thinking chair. I have a chair over at my bait window. And I use it for thinking. I don't use it for anything else.\n\n[00:15:30] I don't even, I used to have a cup of coffee whilst I was thinking. I don't even do that now. It's just for thinking. I don't write. I don't listen to anything. I don't watch anything. I just sit there and think. So every time I do that, my mind focuses on my thoughts. I shaped my thoughts and the way I do it is I have a couch, which I just sit on or lay on and move around in [00:16:00] changing my physiology to shape my thoughts.\n\n[00:16:03] So I can thinking about my thoughts. And this is a unique human thing. Humans are the only creatures we can actually think about their own thoughts. And then I go out and I walk to stretch thoughts. And that's very important because I want to think bigger and I want to think better. I want to think more and I want to think before other people do it. And then I write it all down and what I think can be action or actionable.\n\n[00:16:33] I'll put it on my Kanban boards. It's as simple as that. That's my routine. That happens every single day, no matter what, I wake up at five in the morning. And as soon as I'm out of bed, And I do my little spiritual routine in the morning. I go into that.\n\n[00:16:51] Hala Taha: That's really interesting. So it's really about just taking the time to expand on your thoughts to not just have an initial thought, write it down, have [00:17:00] an initial thought, write it down.\n\n[00:17:01] It's all about just like letting it sit there and stretching it out and just trying to get the most out of it.\n\n[00:17:06] Peter Jansen: And I find that the physical space you do it in is very important as well. Because every time I look at that chair, I automatically start thinking. And when I have a challenge going through my head or, that's just presented to me.\n\n[00:17:20] I look at my chair. The process already begins just by looking at that chair. So the physicality helps.\n\n[00:17:27] Hala Taha: Yeah. Cool. My last question on this topic is really about being a free thinker. A lot of my listeners, including myself, work a nine to five, we work for the man. So is it possible to be a free thinker when you have a day job?\n\n[00:17:43] Peter Jansen: This is the beautiful thing about thinking. You're always free to think what you want. We were not living in a total or William world. We're not in his novel of 1984. We don't have fought police. You can be a free thinker, but you need to [00:18:00] free yourself. So you can do that. And this is a difficult thing. You need to understand that you need to separate, yourself from everybody else.\n\n[00:18:09] Meaning your thoughts. Could be thoughts that have been created because of what your family has told you. What your friends have told you, your upbringing, your schooling, the system you live in the country, you live in the culture, you live in religious beliefs. And so on. Now it's difficult to get objective with all these things happening, and the way you free yourself from it is you look at the situation.\n\n[00:18:39] And a situation is just that. I want to put this very clear for everybody. It's very simple. A situation is not a Saint into being, it does not care if you're upset. It does not care. If you scream at it, shout at it or anything, free yourself from the situation. What you do is you'll look at it. You physically [00:19:00] write down situation.\n\n[00:19:01] You're in, you put it in front of you, and then you just extract yourself from the equation as much as you can. It takes practice. It takes time. But once you learn how to free yourself from the situation. They need stolen, how to free yourself from fear. And that I would recommend a book calledThe Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi.\n\n[00:19:23] Where he says that, the way of the warrior is generally speaking. The wrestler acceptance of death. I know this is a bit dark, but it is beautiful because this is one thing that unites humanity. If you're alive today, eventually you will not be. This is why we have to be present, but if you're able to confront this reality, you're able to confront one of the biggest fears.\n\n[00:19:52] You'll have the fear of no longer existing. And when you do that, you free [00:20:00] yourself from those fears. Then you start realizing, that fear is pretty much the only thing, which gets smaller and smaller. Every time you get closer and closer to it, and the more you're exposed to it. Once you're free from the situations and you're free from fear. You can go ahead and be present and think and grow your thoughts, expand your thoughts.\n\n[00:20:24] And it's important to share your thoughts. It's very important to do that, because your thoughts are going to be difficult to land. Unless you share them and somebody else comes in and gives you some feedback on it. It grow that way.\n\n[00:20:38] Hala Taha: That's very powerful. So many takeaways on this conversation of thoughts, but let's switch gears a bit.\n\n[00:20:44] I was poking around your website and I noticed you offer biohacking services. And this helps people take control of their biological systems and optimize their life. The term biohacker has been around for about a decade, and has become somewhat of a [00:21:00] marketing buzzword that's slapped on everything. So what's your exact definition and how it different than something like self-improvement.\n\n[00:21:07] Peter Jansen: In my opinion, biohacking is part of self-improvement exactly. End of the day, you are improving yourself. It is taking control of your own biological systems of your neurology, your digestive system, et cetera. We have many systems and that's the thing. And hiking is basically just having access to it where you normally don't.\n\n[00:21:29] So there are tools for it, but generally speaking biohacking is just taking responsibility of your own biology. And that is part of self-improvement.\n\n[00:21:44] Hala Taha: Cool. So if I have this right, biohacking is just a crazy sounding name for the desire to be the absolute best version of yourself. And the main thing that separates a biohacker from the rest of the self-improvement world is a systems thinking approach to their [00:22:00] own biology.\n\n[00:22:02] Peter Jansen: Yep.\n\n[00:22:02] Hala Taha: That's a pretty good one.\n\n[00:22:05] Okay. Good. So what's an example of a biohack.\n\n[00:22:10] Peter Jansen: Breathing, the breathing thing is a good one. The different techniques for breathing. Those are very basic. They're very simple. Another one would be, for example, one of the ones I do is I filter my water. So I always have two glasses of water before I do anything.\n\n[00:22:25] It's right next to my bed. And I'll just grab those two glasses of water as soon as I wake up. But those two glasses of water the previous night have been infused. So this purifies the water it's alkalized and it's good. And it's a very small biohack. It doesn't require a lot of stuff. It's just such a simple one and you can actually think of meditation, and breathing techniques as a biohack, but you can also look at things like, for example, just taking the right vitamins, the right nutrition.\n\n[00:22:58] That's biohacking. [00:23:00] It's a buzzword. Yes. No doctors are really involved in this process unless you are like me and I actually have a whole bunch of doctors. I talked to, I checked my blood all the time. I have MRI scans and everything just because I want to know that what I am doing is actually optimizing my biology and my neurology.\n\n[00:23:21] Then you don't really need doctors to do it. It just needs to do it responsively.\n\n[00:23:26] Hala Taha: Cool. I'd love to, as we go on uncover some of the things that you do to biohack yourself. There's so many different aspects of biohacking. So for the purposes of this interview, I really want to focus on the brain. So brain hacking is essentially improving one or more brain functions, including memory, focus, mood, energy, and the list goes on.\n\n[00:23:47] So can you give us your most effective brain hacks?\n\n[00:23:51] Peter Jansen: Okay. My most effective brain hacks. Number one, I use frequencies. I developed my own bite neural frequencies. I [00:24:00] actually use a very interesting database that's out there, which establishes Schumann's residents. Schumann's residents is basically the frequency of planet earth.\n\n[00:24:10] Every single astral body has a frequency and it's dictated by its mass and its gravitational pool in the case of planet earth. The magnetic sphere and solar flares and so on. And I look at Schumann's resonance everyday. And I alter my frequencies so that when I put them on, I grounded myself to exactly the frequency the planet is in today.\n\n[00:24:34] Now the us geological service has a database for this. It's a bit complicated to use it and other institutions to monitors. It is the U S Navy. So it's really scientific and it's really cool, but mine is updated automatically. So all my frequencies are updated automatically. So every day, I will be at Schuman's residence, when I have to start doing my sinking [00:25:00] and then I can change my frequency depending on what I want my brain to be doing. What state I want to be in.\n\n[00:25:07] So I really want to focus. I'll get a focus frequency that is based on that residence. And if I want to. Set myself up to do some sports. I will have a sports frequency, that helps me create the right mental attitude towards this sport that I'm doing.\n\n[00:25:26] Hala Taha: How do you get to the frequencies? That's something that you're controlling yourself or do you have some sort of tool that helps you do that?\n\n[00:25:33] Peter Jansen: So I have software that I created at one point when I was very bored. I'm a really big geek. I have to tell you that. I like coding and stuff like that, but I was really bored and I thought I'm going to do this cause I know what the frequency is do to me. So I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this to another level.\n\n[00:25:52] So I just created that piece of software myself and it works brilliant. And it's worked since 2010. No, that's one of the, [00:26:00] that's one of the ways I recovered from my injuries.\n\n[00:26:02] Hala Taha: Wow.\n\n[00:26:03] Peter Jansen: And actually it's just really cool. It's a really cool piece of software, that just creates what I needed to create for my brain.\n\n[00:26:10] And then all I do is I put it onto my Dropbox and I just created a thing. Where it just automatically updates it and I'll listen to it from my Dropbox. So I know I'm always going to have my accurate frequency. And I'll put it earphones. So I know we'll just be doing whatever I'm doing and plugged into my iPhone and that's it.\n\n[00:26:28] Hala Taha: It's just like sound waves or something that you're listening to. And it changes your brain frequencies. I'm just trying to understand what it is. Oh, okay. Yep.\n\n[00:26:36] Peter Jansen: And it's very simple. One of your phone will have one frequency and the other one will have another. And it's the difference of those two frequencies. Which creates that beat that you really need to listen to, to be able to put yourself into those states that you want.\n\n[00:26:50] But this one's just really controlled and out of muted, so it's pretty cool.\n\n[00:26:55] Hala Taha: Yeah. Very cool. So what are your thoughts on nootropics are supplements designed to [00:27:00] improve cognitive function?\n\n[00:27:01] Peter Jansen: Oh, okay. So we're going to get controversial. I personally love them. I think nor tropics are the world's best kept secret.\n\n[00:27:11] Seriously. Look coffee seven or Tropic. So screen T. So let's not be so afraid of it. The thing is there are no tropics out there. Let's talk about the basic ones, the low end ones, like Parasso Tim that will improve cognitive function. Sometimes it's difficult to get them. There are some commercial brands out there that are just making a killing out of it and they have nothing.\n\n[00:27:34] They really have nothing. Most of the commercial brands out there. When I've tested them, they really do very little, but, and this is my favorite. My favorite one is called C-Max and it's Russian actually. And it was patented by the Soviet union government and it was developed to help cognitive function in it's a neural protector for cosmonauts.\n\n[00:27:59] [00:28:00] Okay. So call someone out is an astronaut, but from Russia. Yeah. So that's the way it was designed for. It was assigned to the 60s. But now we see that this is one of the only drugs, that it has no side effects, but it actually repairs damage from even strokes. It repairs the damage. Of course, it's not commercially available outside of Russia, but in Russia it costs something like the equivalent of 15 to $20 for a whole month.\n\n[00:28:35] That's my favorite. No Tropic. I have to protect my neurology because of the brain damage created by my accident and other things that happened afterwards. And I've been experimenting with different things and I've been testing them with help of doctors. And I found that this one for me is the best. And it really helps me cognitive functions.\n\n[00:28:59] It really [00:29:00] does.\n\n[00:29:00] Hala Taha: Very cool. So I had assumed that no tropics might pose serious side effects, but actually I was digging deeper and there really aren't any major ones. I saw like insomnia or stomach pain. So you mentioned previously. It's the biggest kept secret. Why aren't more people doing this?\n\n[00:29:21] Peter Jansen: Because they just don't know about it.\n\n[00:29:23] And they don't know about it because there's no commercial effort to do it, because there's no business in it. Not really. Yes, the commercial breads will do it. They catered to biohackers mostly, and to millennials who are very interested in biohacking and very interested in cognitive development, but really pharmaceutical companies produce them.\n\n[00:29:46] They really do. They're not expensive. But you need a prescription for them. You need a prescription for them, because usually they're used for things like seizures. But [00:30:00] there's much cheaper than regular neuro protectors that we see in the market. So if you have in your protector, an anti-epileptic for example, that might cost, I don't know, 20, 30, $40.\n\n[00:30:11] Sometimes you'll have an or Tropic that costs two or $3, but it doesn't say thing. So where's the business at that's a situation. I don't want to be too controversial, but pharmaceutical companies don't have clients, don't have end users. They have subscribers. So the moment you get sick from one thing, you get some medication and you're going to have to be using this medication for X amount of time.\n\n[00:30:35] If that medication is going to cause a problem. Oh, we've just upgraded to your subscription. So biohackers, we tried to get away from that, and we try to take control ourselves. So we usually look at things that will not damage us.\n\n[00:30:48] Hala Taha: Yeah. I find this all really fascinating. I was looking up this nootropic called Uridine and it improves memory fights Alzheimer's, depression, relieves pain. [00:31:00] It sounds like a miracle, but I noticed that you have to buy companion and no tropics like omega three for it to work. Can you explain what stacking is to our listeners?\n\n[00:31:11] Peter Jansen: Okay. What I do for stacking, basically, it's this, I make sure that I take something and atropic Tropic for example, and the minimum quantity possible and whatever support mechanism I need for it as well.\n\n[00:31:26] So I like to make a threes, but I'll make a seven star better. It's just not as commercially available. And what it will do is it'll help the nootropic break the blood brain. But it'll help protect your neurologist. So it depends on what nootropic you're using. And then once you have the minimum dose and it's not affecting you. You double that up until the point, where you see that there's a notable result where you can notice it.[00:32:00]\n\n[00:32:00] And it's stable, then that's great. And you need to see that there are no side effects to it. This is why we stack it up little by little. That's a very important thing. You don't just say, oh, okay. You know what I need to study lots tonight. I'm going to pull an all nighter and I'm just going to fill myself with nootropics.\n\n[00:32:19] That's not responsible. That's not cool. And it's not. Some are tropics, like except the press Tim, and a few others will drain your hypothalamus. And so you need something to balance that out because if not, you're just going to feel very tired. And it's really difficult to feel really tired and not be able to sleep at the same time.\n\n[00:32:39] Don't mess around with it.\n\n[00:32:40] Hala Taha: Yeah. And I bet there's a lot of documentation. Cause I think there's a lot of people out there really passionate. Who have already come up with these concoctions, that work. So if you're interested, just do some research on brain hacking and nootropics. Let's spend time on the gut to brain connection.\n\n[00:32:57] We recently had billionaire Naveen [00:33:00] Jain on the show. Who is the CEO of Viome a company that offers gut health checks and recommendations on the foods to eat. Can you explain what Nutrogenomix are and how your food impacts your brain.\n\n[00:33:13] Okay. So\n\n[00:33:14] Peter Jansen: there's a difference between Ultragenyx and Nutrogenomix. I'm not to genomics is basically the nutrients that you give your DNA and Nutrogenomix is the nutrients your DNA requires.\n\n[00:33:26] So it depends what side you're looking at from. Now, if you're looking at it in terms of gut health and brain health. Yes. The intestine is actually your second brain. There's a lot of neurological connections from our brain towards us and into our heart as well. So the way I see it, we have three brains. We need to start learning how to think from there.\n\n[00:33:45] We need to balance these out. So the gut we balance through eating the right things and maintaining a really good gut balance in terms of the right probiotic. The right nutrients, the right fibers. So on [00:34:00] soluble fibers, hydration and so on. And there's people out there would say. And I agree with them that death begins in the gut.\n\n[00:34:08] Yes. But so does the healing of pretty much every disease. And I'm going to just say every single one of them, but pretty much everyone, begins to start healing it from the gut. Now, if you use them to genomics for this, you are essentially giving the right nutrients to your genetic code to turn on or off that genetic expression.\n\n[00:34:27] That's all it is. It's a switch. It's a binary system and a genetic expression is either on or off. If you, for example, want to rejuvenate then you activate them too. If you want your mitochondria to work better than you activate the nerve one, and you do this kinds of things. Of course, if you do both, they are balancing it out and it's all about that balance.\n\n[00:34:50] It's still quite new. And there are tests that you can have done. And before, when I started taking them, they were, I live in Europe. So they were 1000, [00:35:00] 200 euros, which at the time was like $1,500. And now you can get it for like a hundred or $200 or something like that. I know there's companies in the US and in India who have really great services.\n\n[00:35:11] And you basically just send us a live. And they'll have everything for you. And it'll tell you things like what you can eat. What you can't eat. What you shouldn't eat when you should eat. And it can tell you also, what illnesses you might get because of your genetic.\n\n[00:35:29] Yeah.\n\n[00:35:29] Hala Taha: Yeah. Very cool. So one of the more trending concepts in biohacking is called rewilding and people are calling this the ultimate form of biohacking. And it's all about returning to a more wild or self-willed states and undoing domestication.\n\n[00:35:47] So can you just explain why people are doing this and what are some examples of rewilding?\n\n[00:35:53] Peter Jansen: Why we're doing this? If you prescribe to the theory of evolution. We have been in this exact [00:36:00] same state for about 250,000 years, and it took millions of years to get us there. And do you really think that in the past, like 50, 60, 70 years we've evolved to eat fast food?\n\n[00:36:11] No. Yeah. Or to eat synthetic molecules?\n\n[00:36:16] Hala Taha: No.\n\n[00:36:17] Peter Jansen: We haven't, not really. He wilding is it's awesome because you're basically going back to what your body is. This meant to be doing what it's meant to be eating. How you're meant to take a shower. This is why I keep on mentioning Wim Hof and Tim Vanfleet, because these guys are geniuses of that one.\n\n[00:36:37] I don't know if you've ever heard of the ice man?\n\n[00:36:39] Hala Taha: No, but I'd love for you to talk about it.\n\n[00:36:42] Peter Jansen: So this is Wim Hoff, and Tim Vanfleet. I love them. Especially Tim Vanfleet to him and I, we do a lot of work together. It's all about breathing and cold training. And before we never used to take showers with hot water, because there was no hot water to take a shower with.[00:37:00]\n\n[00:37:00] So people would just jump in a lake, jumping, a river, jumping a pond to wash themselves. And that cold water is fantastic for the body. It's great for the skin. It's great for vessel dilation for cardiovascular health or neurological health for to activate brown fat. It's really fantastic. So one of the things I like to do is go back to that.\n\n[00:37:28] So I never take a hot shower or even a warm shower, even when I'm in Moscow.\n\n[00:37:34] Hala Taha: Wow.\n\n[00:37:35] Peter Jansen: I don't do. I just don't cold water all the time I swim. I live about what is it, a hundred yards from the beach. And even in wintertime. I'll go out and swim. I'm the only crazy guy out there swimming, but I'm out there swimming and I'm enjoying it.\n\n[00:37:55] And this really is going back to that wild self, that not just [00:38:00] on domesticated version of us. But that wild free version of us that our biology is designed to be. We're not designed to sit in the couch, watching a movie. We're not designed for that. It's nice that we're able to do it, but we're not designed for that.\n\n[00:38:18] And the more you do that whilst you eat food that you're not designed to eat well. The more trouble you're going to get into. It's as simple as that.\n\n[00:38:25] Hala Taha: How about your food? Do you suggest that we eat meat? You eat raw foods? What's the food look like in this rewilding concept?\n\n[00:38:35] Peter Jansen: Oh my God. Okay. So for me, I can only speak for me because every single power hacking process is individual.\n\n[00:38:43] It's all about you and how you find things. For me, this has been the toughest. I've gone through everything. I have a brown from being a raw vegan, which was probably my favorite stage to paleo, to vegetarian, [00:39:00] to macrobiotics. And I've just been, trying to find the best, that I can take to optimize oil until I really realized that who I am is also, it's also a question of values and principles.\n\n[00:39:18] So that's why I can't really tell you what the best thing is, because it depends on your values. Your principles and your own biology, your own preferences and what you wanted to achieve. In my case, I used to love eating meat. Really. I love the taste of it. It's fantastic. Unfortunately, it's not the best for my value system.\n\n[00:39:46] I love the environment. I love it so much. I love planet earth and I'm very aware that we need this planet more than it needs us. So I don't say I don't eat any meat. I do. I just keep it to [00:40:00] a bare minimum and I make sure it's as sustainable as it can possibly be. I don't do it because I might be hurting an animal or something that had a face.\n\n[00:40:10] I don't do it for those reasons. And I know a lot of people do and that's great and that's fantastic. Do it for those reasons. I do it because we all live in this sphere and I want to take care of it. And I want to do my part. My part is only a small part, but I'm not going to refuse to do that, which I can do, even if it's only me.\n\n[00:40:31] So for me, it's been a balance. I know, I feel great physically, if I eat meat and now here's a shocker. If I eat raw meat, I feel even better. Wow. And I love it and I've had it since I was a child. And that's probably why I grew up in Mexico and to Texas and Mexico. My grandparents would give me raw meat and I would love it.\n\n[00:40:52] It just put a little lemon on it, a little salt and that's it. And I would love it and I still love the taste. So at that point [00:41:00] it was great. It gives me a lot of energy and everything, but being raw vegan gives me a lot of energy as well. And right now I have a mix. I know I have to eat proteins and mostly fat in the morning.\n\n[00:41:11] I know I needed to keep my lagoons down to a bare minimum. I know that I need to keep my starches down to a bare minimum. That's me. So mine is a little more Keto, but it's a difficult keto because it's a keto almost attending to vegetarian. And for other people, it's going to be completely keto. For other, people's going to be completely paleo.\n\n[00:41:33] We need to figure it out. And this is up to you and it's up to your value system, and it's up to how you want to live and what'd you want to achieve? I eat for my brain.\n\n[00:41:42] Hala Taha: Yeah.\n\n[00:41:44] Peter Jansen: Yeah. For me, that's the most important thing. My thoughts become my reality. And so if I take care of my thoughts and my thought processes, through anything, I ingest, whether it's information or food.\n\n[00:41:57] Then I'm most responsible for what goes in, as [00:42:00] I am for what goes out.\n\n[00:42:02] Hala Taha: Awesome. So before we go, we only have a few minutes left. I just want to touch on some of your other key topics, namely leadership. I just had an episode on leadership featuring the leadership guro Dov Baron. And we talked a lot about purpose and how through purpose people can really shine with their talents and succeed and gain a tribe.\n\n[00:42:28] So can you tell us about your opinion when it comes to purpose and leadership?\n\n[00:42:34] Peter Jansen: The purpose is the most important thing. Is it a lot of people think that purpose is their ultimate goal. It's not, it's a lifestyle. You don't want your purpose to have an end state? You don't want it to all of a sudden say, oh, I have achieved my purpose, because what can we say about a person who's already achieved their purpose?\n\n[00:42:53] Hala Taha: Oh. They're not motivated.\n\n[00:42:54] Peter Jansen: It's like good on you. What should we do now? Barry, you is you're already there. Yeah. And that's a [00:43:00] goal and it could be a vision or it could be a goal. But the thing is a purpose drives you every day. No. So my purpose in life now, because of course purpose transforms as you grow, you tend to be inflexible.\n\n[00:43:16] Before when I was 18, my purpose was to have the privilege to touch the hearts and change the lives of all the people I had the honor to meet. Then after my accident, it was the same, but then I added and I wished to help. But now my purpose is to help people create legacy. Transgenerational transplanetary.\n\n[00:43:39] I just had a conversation with a young lady, who was 18 right now and is already being trained to go to Morrison 2033. And I know that her vision is out of this world. Her vision and her purpose are transplanetary, and that's, what's important. For me, [00:44:00] my purpose is to help people create true legacies.\n\n[00:44:05] Which transcend their borders and transcend their generations, and even transcend our planet. That's my purpose in life. So anything else, anything that doesn't fit into my purpose and my value systems? I reject. I just Nope. That's not for me. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.\n\n[00:44:27] So I ended up coaching a whole bunch of people. Who are doing great environmental work. Sometimes they don't pay so well, but it doesn't matter, because we're building legacies and that's important. You mentioned building a tribe. This is okay. This is cool, but I don't prescribe to that for myself for one particular.\n\n[00:44:52] For me being a leader, whether it's a thought leader or a leader of a movement or a leader of a country or a leader of a company [00:45:00] organization, it's not about me. It's not about the leader. A true leader, a transformational leader, doesn't have followers. A transformational leader does not just lead people.\n\n[00:45:15] A transformational leader serves people and that's what's important. And here's the biggest difference a transformational leader will serve people, because we know that the most important thing is to lead through empathy and beyond our generation. That's how you create real transformation. And without purpose, you cannot get.\n\n[00:45:39] And your purpose has to drive you every single day of your life. You wake up knowing that you are going to work to make sure your purpose is filled that day. And the next day you're going to do the same. And because 93% of our thoughts are repetitive. We're going to make sure that those thoughts that are purpose-driven are going to [00:46:00] be repetitive.\n\n[00:46:01] And that's going to drive a legacy beyond your own name.\n\n[00:46:06] Hala Taha: That's beautiful. What a great way to close out the show. Thank you so much, Peter. Where can our listeners go to find out more about everything that you do?\n\n[00:46:15] Peter Jansen: Thank you very much.
