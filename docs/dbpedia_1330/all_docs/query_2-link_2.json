        "text": "Our wheel and frame performance charts are useful tools, but they don’t answer one crucial question for many Zwift racers: how does X frame and Y wheelset compare with the Zwift Concept Z1 (Tron) bike?\n\nAfter lots of testing, we’ve created a scatter plot chart pitting the Tron bike against top-performing wheels and frames. Here’s how the best frames and wheels in Zwift compare to the Tron bike on flats and climbs.\n\nTron vs Top Performers\n\nColored based on frame. Mouse over each point for details.\n\nZwift Concept Z1, Specialized Venge S-Works, Canyon Aeroad 2021, Canyon Aeroad 2024, Scott Addict RC, Specialized Aethos\n\nChart updated July 29, 2024\n\nObservations\n\nNot surprisingly, the most aero setup (Specialized Venge S-Works + DT Swiss disc) is also the slowest climber, and the best climber (Aethos + Roval Alpinist/Lightweights) is slowest on flat ground.\n\nIf you follow the line of enlarged points that travels from the top-left to the bottom-right, these are the top performers. You can see that the Tron bike is a strong all-arounder, but the Canyon Aeroad 2024, Scott Addict RC, and Specialized Aethos all turn in strong performances too. It’s just a question of how much climbing advantage you’re willing to trade for a given aero advantage.\n\nThe ENVE 7.8 wheels make a surprisingly good showing as “aero all-arounders”. The DT Swiss ARC 62s also display solid all-around performance, but skewed a bit more to the climbing side of things.\n\nNotice the almost perfect trendline traveling from the lower-right to the upper-left, meaning there are no massive outliers in terms of performance, but rather a consistent tradeoff between climbing and flat test results. The biggest outlier in that curve is the Canyon Aeroad 2024 + DT Swiss disc, which is just 1 second slower than the most aero setup while trimming 7.5s off that aero setup’s climb time. A smart choice for any race that has even a bit of climbing involved!\n\nYour Thoughts\n\nWhat conclusions do you draw from this chart? Share your thoughts below!"
