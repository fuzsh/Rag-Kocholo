Solar Heating Control

Overview of Christian Schumann's Solarsystem

Design

I have helped Christian Schumann with scripts to control his Solar-panel + rainwater buffer with switches and water-pump.

There are several cronjobs which run every minute, and one of the scripts frequently return “Data error” when reading a DS2890. Reading the sensor second time works almost every time.

Christian Schumann created a quick overview of the system, and I added the temperature’s and sensors in the picture with imagemagick.

Take a look at: http://home.mag.cx/sommer/

Code

My scripts looks like this when reading the data:

#!/bin/ash

readsensor () (

VAL=`owread -s 3002 $1/$2 2>&1`

ERR=$?

[ $ERR != 0 ] &&

}

# save last value to a file as well (mostly for web-server)

[ "$2" = "temperature" ] && echo "$VAL" > /tmp/last_val.$1.$2

echo "$VAL"

true;

)

writesensor () (

VAL=`owwrite -s 3002 $1/$2 $3 2>&1`

ERR=$?

[ $ERR != 0 ] &&

}

true;

)

VAL=`readsensor $SENSOR PIO`

ERR=$?

[ $ERR != 0 ] && exit 1

Platform

It’s run on a Asus WL500gd with openwrt 0.9.

Extensions

I have made a simple web-interface to control some switches and potentiometers via cgi-scripts too, but it’s still a major hack and under development.

Perhaps I can show it in a few days. I don’t want to give out the URL to Christian Schumann’s web-interface even if it’s password protected.
