        "text": "Olainfarm, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the Baltics, has invested 3.3 million euros to start the construction of a solar panel park on its premises in Olaine. The project aims to further invest in the sustainability of the company by developing the use of green energy in its energy supply. The total capacity of the solar park will be 3.2 megawatts (MW), providing up to 40 per cent of the company’s total annual electricity consumption. It will be one of the largest solar parks in Latvia, developed for self-consumption by a manufacturing company.\n\nIgors Vilcāns, Chief Power Engineer at Olainfarm, emphasised that the company has been implementing very targeted activities to reduce its overall energy consumption and increasingly use green energy solutions for the past nine years. For example, in the first nine months of this year, the average consumption of energy resources per unit of chemical production at Olainfarm decreased by 16.8 per cent, despite the fact that the company’s production volumes increased.\n\n“We plan our energy consumption very carefully to ensure continuity of production, but also to become more energy efficient and greener,” he continued. “We see that energy efficiency and green energy solutions allow us to cut costs now and in the long term. These investments are also paying off in our energy independence. The solar park will allow us to generate up to 3,500 megawatt-hours (MWh(/year of green electricity.”\n\nThe solar park is being developed on the company’s site in Olaine. It will cover a total area of 4.2 hectares and will host around 5,400 solar panels with an installed capacity of 3.2 MW. Solar energy will provide up to 80 per cent of the company’s electricity during the summer season and up to 40 per cent on average per year. The project is scheduled for completion in spring 2024.\n\n“The solar park project is part of Olainfarm’s sustainable development strategy to promote greener energy use and contribute to the overall sustainability of society,” said Juris Bundulis, Chairman of the Board of Olainfarm. “As a socially responsible company, our commitment is not only to public health and access to medicines but also to ensuring that the environment remains healthy as a result of our actions. The development of the solar park is an important step towards energy sustainability, strengthening both our and Latvia’s overall energy independence. Importantly, this project not only reduces our environmental impact but also increases our energy self-sufficiency and reduces the risks of rising energy costs. This is an excellent investment for both the company and the environment.”"
