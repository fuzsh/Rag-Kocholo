        "text": "Today with participation of President of Latvia Andris Berzins, the new final dosage form production unit of JSC Olainfarm was opened. The unit includes final dosage form site for nitrofuranes, small batch production unit and final dosage development laboratory. The project has been implemented with a support from European Regional Development Fund.\n\n„Olainfarm has always been the most outstanding locomotive of Latvian chemical industry, which today, with opening of the capacities is doubling our economic capabilities. Because of skilful management and introduction of new technologies, the company has been able to find markets in new and distant countries,” says President of Latvia Andris Berzins.\n\nThe new production unit has been built through reconstruction of previously underused building. Its total space is 2112 square metres. The building has two floors and is connected to the main final dosage form production unit. On the ground floor there is a small batch production unit and final dosage development laboratory, but on the second floor the nitrofurane final dosage production unit and in-process quality control laboratories are located.\n\n„New final dosage form production unit of Olainfarm is a high added value investment project, that will help company to strengthen its competitiveness in growing world market of nitrofuranes and will significantly improve company’s ability to develop new products. We have a long term experience in production of nitrofuranes, we are the only producer of them in Latvia and the Baltic States and the only ones in former Soviet Union who produce active pharmaceutical ingredients of nitrofuranes. Nitrofuranes make up more than 20% of sales of Olainfarm and during the last five years sales of nitrofuranes have tripled,” adds Chairman of the Board of JSC Olainfarm Mr. Valerijs Maligins.\n\nAntibacterial nitrofurane derivatives, namely Furamag, Furagin, Furadonin and Furasol will be produced in the modernized facility, and after the completion of development process they will be joined by the new nitrofurane product. New equipment will significantly improve the efficiency of production processes, making them highly technological, and at the same time reduce energy consumption.\n\nSmall batch final dosage form production unit of JSC Olainfarm will produce smaller batches of finished products and will be used for technology scale-up. Small scale technologies will also allow optimisation of the use of more productive equipment. Final dosage form development laboratory has also been moved to the new building, where it will continue working on new forms of existing products and on development of brand new products.\n\nNew final dosage production unit of JSC Olainfarm is the biggest financial investment in development of pharmaceutical production in the Baltics in 2014. Total costs of the project are 9.6 million euro, of which 2.5 million euro is funded by European Regional Development Fund. Of the total project costs 4.1 million euro were invested in construction works, 4.8 in production equipment and 0.6 in analytical equipment.\n\nNew final dosage form production unit was constructed within the project „High Added Value Investments into Production of Nitrofuranes”, on which the contract No.L-APV-12-0039 was signed between JSC Olainfarm and Latvian Investment and Development Agency on August 15, 2012.\n\nJSC Olainfarm is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in Latvia with more than 40 years of experience in production of medication and chemical and pharmaceutical products. A basic principle of company’s operations is to produce reliable and effective top quality products for Latvia and the rest of the world. Products made by the Group are being exported to more than 35 countries of the world, including the Baltics, Russia, other CIS, Europe, Asia, North America and Australia.\n\nInformation prepared by:"
