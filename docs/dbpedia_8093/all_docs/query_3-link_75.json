        "text": "This special edition on pharma & mergers highlights the continued focus of global antitrust regulators on this critical sector for consumers and society. Since the last special edition, the pharma sector has seen some of the most high-profile of all recent merger investigations. Alongside the tech industry, the structural features and competitive dynamics of this sector have also been a key driver for significant policy developments.
