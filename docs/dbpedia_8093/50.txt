DGAP-News: Olainfarm 2015-05-29 / 17:43 --------------------------------------------------------------------- AS Olainfarm has just experienced its most profitable quarter so far, as it made a net profit of 6.7 million euro and sales of 27 million euro. Net profit has increased by 81%, while sales have increased by 16% compared to the same period one year ago. Major sales markets of AS Olainfarm during this period were Russia, Latvia, Ukraine, The Netherlands and Belarus. Olaine, 2015-05-29 17:43 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 'Significant sales growth to countries of Central Asia and to Russia along with increased deliveries to the World Health Organization have helped us achieve yet another most successful quarter in history of Olainfarm. However, worsening of situation on Ukrainian and Russian markets make us be more careful and focus even more on further diversification of our sales markets. We have already taken a few steps in this direction, and commencement of exports to Mongolia and successful development with registration in Turkey are proof to that. We are expecting more rapid sales growth of Silvanols soon, as it has been more than a year since we started a lot more active use of our marketing and logistics power to help them succeed in our traditional markets,' says Valerijs Maligins, Chairman of Olainfarm's Board. During the 1st quarter of 2015 sales to all company's main markets continued increasing except for Belarus, where they shrunk by 26%, compared to 1st quarter of 2014. It should be noted, however, that during previous two years in a row, sales to Belarus were growing: by more than 40% in 2014 and more than 70% in 2013. The most rapid sales increases during the 1st quarter of 2015 were achieved in Tajikistan, where sales grew by 173%, The Netherlands, where sales grew by 157%, Kyrgyzstan, where sales grew by 129% and Kazakhstan, where sales grew by 106%. Sales to Russia grew by 27%. In total, during the first quarter AS Olainfarm made sales in 31 countries on 5 continents. During this time, significant changes have occurred to the structure of bestselling products, as due to increased demand for anti-tuberculosis product PASA Sodium salt, this product has become the second best selling product with a total share of 14% of all Olainfarm products sold. The list of best sellers is still headed by Neiromidin, Olainfarm's product for health of nervous system. It is proposed, that Annual meeting of shareholders of A/s 'Olainfarm' to be convened on June 11, 2015 approves operating plan of the Group for 2015. According to it, sales of the Group in 2015 are planned to be 100 million euros, but the net profit will reach 15 million euros.
