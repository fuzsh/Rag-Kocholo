Olainfarm, which produces medicaments and chemical pharmaceutical products (its product portfolio contains more than 60 finished dosage forms, 25 active pharmaceutical ingredients, and more then 20 intermediates), has a history spanning back more than 40 years, and is one of the largest manufacturers of finished drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates in the Baltic States. The company exports its products to more than 40 countries around the world, and its partners include such companies as Novartis, Dr. Reddy’s, and Glenmark Generics. Since 2011 it has also provided anti-tuberculosis medications for the World Health Organisation. One of the directions in which Olainfarm is developing is the research of new active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage forms, both for its original products and for generic drugs. Olainfarm became a joint stock company in 1997, and its shares are listed on the Official List of NASDAQ OMX Riga. In early August 2016, Olainfarm was invited to ring the closing bell at the NASDAQ MarketSite in New York’s Times Square. This honour was bestowed on the company because at the beginning of 2016, Olainfarm received the special Baltic Market Award for Top Performer of 10 Years – for the greatest increase in share price and rise in ranking over the past decade. Since its first analysis, in 2006, Olainfarm’s ranking with Baltic Market Awards has grown by 25%, while the share price has grown 448% in the same period.
