        "text": "Kofi Annan was the secretary-general of the United Nations (UN) from 1997 to 2006. He was the first black African to hold the post. Annan was a career diplomat who spoke English and French as well as several African languages. He was well respected in the international community. A diplomat is someone who helps people and countries work together peacefully.\n\nKofi Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on April 8, 1938. His father was the governor of the Ashanti province and a chief of the Fante people. Annan won a grant to study in the United States. He later studied international relations at the Institute for Advanced International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nAnnan spent most of his career working for the UN. His first post was as a budget officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. He later led peacekeeping operations in several countries, including Burundi, Somalia, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). He also served as special UN representative to the former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1996 Annan became the seventh permanent secretary-general of the UN. He worked to improve the UN’s relationship with the member countries, to end human rights abuses around the world, and to combat the AIDS virus, especially in Africa. Annan also tried to improve the position of women who worked at the UN Secretariat.\n\nIn June 2001 Annan was appointed to a second term as secretary-general. Later that year he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He shared the prize with the UN. Annan’s term ended in 2006. In 2007 he formed the Kofi Annan Foundation. The organization promotes peace, human rights, and the rule of law. Annan continued to work as a diplomat as well. He went to Kenya, Syria, and other countries to resolve disputes. Annan also served as a leader of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. In that role he helped farmers in Africa produce more food and protect the environment. Annan died on August 18, 2018."
