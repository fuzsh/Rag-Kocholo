At the same time, we are helping to improve healthcare for the population through digital innovations.\"\n\nThe vision of the Kofi Annan Award for Innovation in Africa was born out of the \"High-Level Forum Africa – Europe: taking cooperation to the digital age\" hosted by then Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and President Paul Kagame in the framework of Austria’s presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2018. The Forum highlighted the untapped potential for deepening the partnership between Africa and Europe in technology exchange and trade as well as their importance for economic growth, creating employment opportunities, building resilient societies and fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nContact\n\nFor further questions about the application, please contact: mail@kofiannanaward.at\n\nThe Set-Up of the Kofi Annan Award for Innovation in Africa\n\nThe Austrian Federal Chancellery is inviting African social entrepreneurs and purpose-driven enterprises with a measurable social impact and sustainable business model to apply in order to bring their social impact to scale and benefit as many Africans as possible.\n\nNine candidate teams will be selected to further develop their solutions in the 5-day intensive Innovation Bootcamp and consequently pitch their solutions in front of a high-level jury.\n\nAlongside this, candidates will further benefit from the Support Network of the Kofi Annan Award for Africa – a community of passionate and engaged mentors, investors, consultants, corporate partners and industry experts who share one goal: to help social entrepreneurs get access to the right resources at the right time.\n\nHow we select innovations\n\nInnovations will be evaluated and selected according to the following criteria:\n\nImpact & Scalability: The idea has the potential to positively impact the health and wellbeing of a specific population.\n\nBusiness Model: the project has a scalable product/service with sustainable revenue generation and scalable financial model.\n\nTeam: The team members have relevant experience, are committed to the project and ability to implement the solution.\n\nInnovativeness: The idea is a new technology, the approach of applying existing technology, process or business model addressing a problem.\n\nTraction: The innovation has shown demonstrable results in terms revenue, customers, investments, or grants.\n\nPartnerships\n\nThe Kofi Annan Award for Africa is organized by the Austrian Federal Chancellery, together with the Kofi Annan Foundation and the operational support of the World Food Programme Innovation Accelerator and the Austrian Development Agency.\n\nArchive\n\nThanks to those who applied\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that the second edition of the Kofi Annan Award for Innovation in Africa collected 832 applications from 89 countries around the world, 49 of thmen are African countries!
