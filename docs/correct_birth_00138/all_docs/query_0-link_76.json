        "text": "The United Nations is mourning the death of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who passed away peacefully after a short illness, on Saturday 18 August 2018. The renowned Ghanaian diplomat was 80 years old.\n\nMr. Annan was the seventh man to take the helm of the global organization and the first Secretary-General to emerge from the ranks of its staff. The current UN chief, Antonio Guterres hailed him as “a guiding force for good” and a “proud son of Africa who became a global champion for peace and all humanity.”\n\n“Like so many, I was proud to call Kofi Annan a good friend and mentor. I was deeply honoured by his trust in selecting me to serve as UN High Commissioner for Refugees under his leadership. He remained someone I could always turn to for counsel and wisdom — and I know I was not alone,” Mr. Guterres said in a statement.\n\n“He provided people everywhere with a space for dialogue, a place for problem-solving and a path to a better world. In these turbulent and trying times, he never stopped working to give life to the values of the United Nations Charter. His legacy will remain a true inspiration for all us.”\n\nKofi Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on 8 April 1938.\n\nHe served as UN Secretary-General for two consecutive five-year terms, beginning in January 1997. Mr. Annan joined the UN system in 1962 as an administrative and budget officer with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, rising to hold senior-level posts in areas such as budget and finance, and peacekeeping.\n\nAs Mr. Guterres noted: “In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.” (IDN-INPS | United Nations,18 August 2018)"
