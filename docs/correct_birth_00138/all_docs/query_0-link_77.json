Secretary-General, 1997-2006\n\nKofi Annan was Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1997 through 2006. He succeeded Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt in the post, and was followed by Ban Ki-moon of South Korea. Kofi Annan was a U.N. veteran who took his first job with the organization in 1962 and worked his way up through various posts, including Deputy Director to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (1980-83) and Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping (1995-96). Annan was the first Secretary-General chosen from the ranks of the U.N.'s staff. He was also the first black man to hold the post and the second African (after Boutros-Ghali). In 2001 Annan and the United Nations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their ongoing work in global peace and cooperation. Annan was elected for a second five-year term in 2001, and served until the end of 2006. He was succeeded on January 1, 2007 by Ban Ki-moon.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nKofi Annan “pronounced his last name ANN-un to rhyme with ‘cannon,'” according to a 2018 obituary in The Washington Post… Kofi Annan attended Macalaster College in St. Paul, Minnesota, graduating in 1961… He was a fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management in 1971-72, receiving a Master of Science degree… Kofi Annan’s wife Nane Annan, a lawyer and artist, is from Sweden… Previous Secretaries-General were: Trygve Lie (Norway), 1946-52; Dag Hammarskjöld (Sweden), 1953-61; U Thant (Myanmar, formerly Burma), 1961-71; Kurt Waldheim (Austria), 1972-81; Javier de Perez de Cuellar (Peru), 1982-91; Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt), 1992-96.\n\n4 Good Links\n\nThe UK news site has his obituary and fine archived stories\n\nThe U.N.'s official histories of Annan and his predecessors\n\nGood starting point: a bio of Annan, plus a raft of speeches and articles by and about him\n\nFlashback: CNN's 2001 report on Annan's successful re-election bid\n\nTrending\n\nHere are the facts and trivia that people are buzzing about."
