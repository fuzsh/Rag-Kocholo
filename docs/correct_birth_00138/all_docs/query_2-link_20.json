He joined the UN system in 1962 as an administrative and budget officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva, rising through the ranks, including at the UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, to hold senior-level posts in areas such as budget and finance, and peacekeeping. He was the first black UN Secretary-General and served for two consecutive five-year terms, beginning in January 1997. In 2001, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, on the 100th anniversary of the prestigious award.
