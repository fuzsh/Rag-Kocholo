        "text": "The man who opened the door of a fifth floor Pierre Hotel suite the other day was a man who always used to stay on the hotel's 38th floor. He was Irwin Allen, Hollywood film producer who has been called “the master of disaster,” and his self‐requested move toward terra firma had a lot to do with his latest crisis epic, “The Towering Inferno,” about a holocaust in the world's tallest (138 stories) skyscraper.\n\n“I spent two‐and‐half years researching this film,” said Allen, a 47‐year‐old medium‐sized man in conservative glasses, gray trousers, and a bright pink shirt that barely covered his rather prominent pot belly, “and I learned that if you are in a building above the eighth floor and a fire breaks out beneath you, you're in trouble. A lot of us who worked on the picture feel this way now. Paul Newman used to go to a dentist on the 14th floor of a building. Now he goes to one on the third floor.”\n\nThere Allen goes, scaring people again. That has become his trademark since his 1972 film, “The Poseidon Adventure,” about the upending of the world's largest cruise ship by an earthquake‐caused tidal wave. That film, which has grossed $162 million, and did nothing for the cruise business, was the forerunner of today's big‐budget distress films.\n\n“The Towering Inferno,” which Vincent Canby called “the year's best end‐of‐theworld movie,” is even more ambitious than “Poseidon”: It has more top stars (10, compared with “Poseidon's” 8), and for the first time in movie history, two major studios, Warner Brothers and 20th Century‐Fox, teamed up to finance it. (The film cost $14‐million, and the profits will be split down the middle.)\n\nNaturally, Allen has more disaster films in the works. About nine, in fact. Why? “I'm in the motion picture business, and the name of the game is to make money so the banks will finance the next one. So you set out to make a money‐maker.”\n\nIn other words, he is into disaster only for the money? He smiles. “Do people make movies for any other reason?\n\n“Listen, I don't make message movies,” he goes on, “but as it turns out, I've got the hottest message in the world in The Towering Inferno': That there can be a terrible fire disaster in tall buildings. We've seen it happen recently in Sao Paulo, Newfoundland and Japan. Did you know that until last week, when a fireproof Government building was opened in Seattle, there were no really fireproof buildings in the United States? It's because of our antiquated fire codes.”\n\nAllen's holocaust movie has gotten him into hot water with the Building Owners and Managers Association International in Chicago, which asked him to put a disclaimer at the beginning of “The Towering Inferno,” saying it was fictitious and that such a thing could not happen in a modem office building. “I said I would, if they put a plaque in every building saying ‘This Building Is Not Fireproof.’ Well, they agreed not to do it, and I agreed not to do a disclaimer.”\n\nWhy does he think people flock to films about calamity and castastrophe? “One reason they flock to mine,” he replies matter‐of‐factly, “is that I take ordinary people—your butcher, your baker, your fireman—and put them ??extraordinary circum??ances that require super??uman effort and great ??roism to overcome. The ??oviegoer sees it happen on ??e screen, and when he exits, ??believes he could have ??ne it, too. He is happy. I ??n't make films about astro??uts or brain surgeons, be??se there aren't enough of ??m to fill a theater. But there are 2,600,000 firemen in the country, and they have wives and friends, and they'll all come to see my picture.\n\n“Another reason, and I don't like to say it, is that people are observers of the macabre. It is a trait of all of us, to one degree or another. People are drawn to chasing a firetruck, or to seeing who's being put in an ambulance. It doesn't speak too well of us . . . but it's good for the box office\n\nAllen says that he personally has not been involved in any real‐life disasters, just two “near‐misses” on commercial airplanes. “One of the planes ran off a runway onto the grass and flipped over,” he recalled. “I didn't fly for two years after that. Another time, a plane literally stood up on end during flight, and whirled around in the air. Everybody was praying.”\n\nOne would think, then, that Allen might have been one of the first people in line to see “Airport 1975,” a film about a mid‐air plane disaster, but he says he hasn't had time to see it, nor any of the other rival disaster movies such as “Earthquake” or “Juggernaut.” “I haven't slept for four months,” he says, “but when I do get time to go to the movies, those will be vie first pictures I see.”\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1974\n\nAllen, who directed all of the action sequences in “The Towering Inferno,” refused to talk on the record about the miniature skyscrapers that were used in the film. “Miniatures?—I don't like to use that word,” he says, smiling coyly. He did say, though, that much of the fire in the film was real (“It was fed by gas lines”), and that none of the 212 stunt people was killed or seriously injured during the filming. One stunt woman was burned around the mouth, however, and a stunt man received cuts over an eye.\n\nAnother Allen trademark is The Star‐Studded Cast, and “The Towering Inferno” has two of the biggest male stars of all: Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Did the two get along during the filming? “They were real buddybuddy,” says Allen, “and neither one experienced any jealousy . . . although there was a running gag about whose eyes were bluer.”\n\nAllen was born in the Bronx, the son of a men's clothing designer. After a brief stint at Columbia University, he moved to the West Coast, where he eventually became a Hollywood gossip columnist and then a literary agent for such authors as Fanny Hurst, P. G. Wade house and Ben Hecht, which led to his career as a film producer. Some of his better known productions have included Rachel Carson's “The Sea Around Us,” for which he won an Academy Award; “The Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea” and the 1964 television series of the same name; and “The Big Circus.”\n\nD 13\n\nFilm/“There are 2,600,000 firemen in the country, and they have wives and friends, and they'll all come to see “'Towering Inferno.” (Irwin Allen)\n\nAllen, who has never married, lives with a dog and three cats in “a small bach elor house on a small piece of land” in Bel Air. His mode of transportation is less modest: A brown Rolls Royce.\n\nAnd what can we expect next from “the master of disaster”? Well, there's a sequel to “The Poseidon Adventure” in the works, in which the ship's survivors are trapped in a train underneath a Swiss Alp; and a film about a volcano disaster in Martinique, in which 64,000 per sons are killed in 10 minutes; and a film about a swarm of millions of killer bees that invades a Texas town; and a film about the theft of three atom bombs; and . . .\n\nIs there any Ultimate Disaster that Allen would some day like to film? He smile's. “Doomsday,” he says. “What a disaster! It would be the end of the world. And maybe I could get Charlton Heston to play Mr. Doom.” ■\n\nBang! Crash! Sizzle!"
