But considering that they can barely buy a big budget hit these days, maybe it's not such a good idea after all.\n\nDifficult to top The Towering Inferno on this front anyway. I didn't really used to like disaster movies that much but as I get older and more easily distracted, this sort of thing is more my fare. I didn't find myself sympathising with many people in this as they're mostly rich cunts but that works too in a film like this. You know most of them are going to die anyway.\n\nOn that front, Susan Flannery (one of the few nice ones) gets the most spectacular death and the best stunt too - on fire and through the window! Nice combo. Richard Chamberlain's was also a good one in a film with consistently good plunges and fire stunts and, of course, an unnecessarily huge cast all jostling for what screen time is left when Paul Newman and Steve McQueen aren't doing their thing.\n\nIt takes its time, sure, but at least uses that time fairly constructively in building up the steadily increasing danger. Still ideal Sunday afternoon stuff."
