        "text": "Next up for John Williams, in our month of #Johnuary, is his next big movie score which happened to be the next big disaster hit from Irwin Allen again – The Towering Inferno.\n\nThis is such a classic movie. An absolutely fantastic film with a great cast – Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Richard Chamberlain, O.J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, Dabney Coleman and many more. Great film.\n\nHere is the main title…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUpqrgaVxJ8\n\nAnd here is a playlist of the full soundtrack…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUpqrgaVxJ8&index=1&list=PLInG6q04i5X14iPiR8lfQXjGGdrTNc_77\n\nThe main theme comes across as very urgent and dramatic. I really liked it. Part of it almost sounds Western in places which seems apt when Steve McQueen and Paul Newman are the male leads\n\nThe track ‘Trapped Lovers’ kind of sounds like a fire alarm, which is quite clever given the context\n\n‘Let There Be Light’ – great name for a track this movie\n\n‘Planting the Charges’ has some great rousing dramatic moments.\n\nA bit like The Poseidon Adventure soundtrack there’s nothing hugely memorable here to listen to on its own but it’s all extremely powerful stuff which obviously adds a huge amount to a dramatic movie like this. Next time I watch the full film I’ll be paying extra attention to the score throughout and the part that it plays."
