        "text": "Irwin Allen, producer of big-budget disaster epics including The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 75. Mr. Allen, a Malibu resident who had been semi-retired for the past year, died at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, said hospital spokeswoman Grace Cheng. His health had been failing for the past few months, said Al Gail, his cousin.\n\nMr. Allen earned the nickname \"Master of Disaster\" because of his disaster hits, including The Poseidon Adventure in 1972, The Towering Inferno in 1974 and The Swarm in 1978.\n\nThe Towering Inferno received an Academy Award nomination for best picture.\n\n\"No, I'm not going to run out of disasters,\" Mr. Allen said in a 1977 interview. \"Pick up the daily newspaper, which is my best source for crisis stories, and you'll find 10 or 15 every day.\"\n\nHe cited human nature for the success of his films.\n\n\"People chase fire engines, flock to car crashes. People thrive on tragedy,\" he said. \"It's unfortunate, but in my case, it's fortunate. The bigger the tragedy the bigger the audience.\"\n\nMr. Allen also was noted for science fiction and fantasy works, such as the film and television series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and the television shows Lost in Space, Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants.\n\nMr. Allen is survived by his wife, Sheila."
