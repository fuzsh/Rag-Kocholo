Scortia, Frank M. Robinson (novel)\n\nBradford: W.E. Berry, 1974. Vintage British quad poster for the 1974 American film.\n\nBased on Richard Martin Stern's 1973 novel \"The Tower,\" and on the 1974 novel \"The Glass Inferno\" by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. Both Twentieth Century-Fox and Warner Brothers had purchased rights to similar skyscraper disaster novels, when \"Master of Disaster\" producer Irwin Allen convinced both studios to join forces in the production of a motion pictureâ€”the first in the history of the major studios. The result was one of the highest grossing films of 1975 and one of the largest ensemble casts yet assembled.\n\nDuring the premiere gala for the world's tallest skyscraper, the building catches fire, the result of shoddy wiring by corrupt contractors, trapping 300 guests on the 135th floor. Winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography.\n\nSet in San Francisco, shot on location in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\n40 x 30 inches, folded. Very Good plus, lightly edgeworn on the top left corner, with a pinhole on the bottom right portion of the poster.\n\n[Book #159689]"
