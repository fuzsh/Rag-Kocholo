        "text": "1974\n\nCity Locations\n\nSan Francisco, California\n\nLocation Types\n\nAmerican, Apartment, House, Retro\n\nLocation Styles\n\nDated/50's-60's-70's Building, Helicopter\n\nAbout The Towering Inferno\n\nThe Towering Inferno is a disaster movie for the ages. Released in 1974 and directed by John Guillermin, it stars Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, and a host of other big Hollywood names. It also delivers edge-of-your-seat drama right up to its thrilling conclusion.\n\nThe film centers on the opening of a state-of-the-art high-rise building, the Glass Tower, in San Francisco. Architect Doug Roberts (Newman) is flown into San Francisco to attend the grand opening of the tower, which soars over 1,600 feet and 138 floors high. A glamorous ceremony is prepared for the towerâs grand unveiling, with all manner of high-flyers and big names in attendance.\n\nThereâs only one problem: the developerâs son-in-law, Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain), was hired as the projectâs chief electrical engineer and cut plenty of corners during the buildingâs construction to save money. The result is a whole lot of faulty wiring and a sky-high disaster just waiting to unfold â which it does over the course of almost three edge-of-your-seat hours.\n\nSimmons dismisses the architectâs concerns about the wiring and says the building is up to code, and the grand opening goes ahead as planned, some 135 floors in the air. As fires break out on the 81st and 65th floors, San Francisco Fire Department Chief Michael O'Halloran (Steve McQueen) faces a desperate battle to get as many people out of the building alive as possible. But when the electrical system fails and the elevators stop working, thatâs going to be much easier said than done.\n\nWhat follows is an action-packed adventure of death-defying stunts, daring helicopter rescues, and fiery explosions as our heroes battle desperately to escape the inferno alive.\n\nThe highest-grossing movie of 1974, The Towering Inferno picked up three Academy Awards from eight nominations. And if you want to check out where this classic disaster epic was filmed, you can. Weâve gathered the details of where some of the best scenes in The Towering Inferno were filmed below (spoiler alert!) so that you can track down these locations for yourself.\n\nThe Towering Inferno Locations\n\nWant to visit the filming location of The Towering Inferno? Youâre in luck. A handful of sites used in the film are easy to visit in the San Francisco area.\n\nIn the opening montage, as we see Paul Newman arrive by helicopter against the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, thereâs an on-screen dedication: âTo those who give their lives so that others might live â to the fire fighters of the world â this picture is gratefully dedicated.â The building shown in the backdrop of this dedication is of course San Francisco City Hall in the heart of the city.\n\nThe exterior film shoots of the entrance to the Glass Tower were filmed at what was the Bank of America World Headquarters, located on California Street in the cityâs Financial District. The lobby, however, was filmed at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, a prestigious hotel at 5 Embarcadero Center. The home of shifty electrical engineer Roger Simmons is also found nearby on Vallejo Street in Pacific Heights.\n\nIf you want to check out some of these instantly recognizable The Towering Inferno locations, keep reading to find out exactly where to find them.\n\nAs the opening credits roll on The Towering Inferno, we see shots of a helicopter zooming past the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco skyline. In it is architect Doug Roberts, whoâs being flown in for the opening of his latest high-rise project, which is set to become an iconic part of the cityâs landscape.\n\nWe soon meet another of the filmâs main players, conman Harlee Claiborne (Fred Astaire). Arriving by cab, he reveals a little of his true character by counting out coins to pay the driver. âThatâs it exactly. Catch your tip next time,â he says to the bemused cabbie, then turns and strides up the steps towards the Glass Tower. Stopping briefly, he gazes up in awe at the imposing building in front of him. Shaking his head in wonder, he walks inside.\n\nThis The Towering Inferno filming location is at 555 California Street in San Francisco, in the cityâs Financial District. This was once the site of the Bank of America World Headquarters, and itâs easily accessible from downtown San Francisco.\n\nAfter entering through the towerâs front doors, Claiborne makes his way through the lobby. Itâs an expansive space, with elevators rising and descending on one wall and some indoor greenery adding a natural touch. The lobby is also a hive of activity and itâs clear thereâs plenty of excitement in the air about the towerâs big opening.\n\nLater, Fire Chief OâHalloran arrives at the scene and is quick to take charge of the fire. Striding through the lobby, he quizzes Doug about the buildingâs design and the fire management systems in place. Heâs also pleased to find out that the building plans are in Dougâs office on the 79th floor, two floors below the fire. âAlright, thatâll be our forward command,â he says, giving off an air of assured confidence.\n\nThe lobby of the Glass Tower, with its glass elevators gliding up and down the wall, was filmed at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco. Located at 5 Embarcadero Center, itâs about a half-mile away from where the external shots of the tower entrance were filmed.\n\nDoug knows the shoddy wiring in the tower is a disaster waiting to happen, and heâs desperate to confront electrical engineer Roger Simmons about his poor work. But when he canât get Simmons on the phone, Doug is forced to head to the other manâs home to confront him in person.\n\nArriving by cab, âWhereâs that electrical genius of yours?â he says to Rogerâs wife Patty (Susan Blakely). And when Roger eventually arrives home, Doug is quick to grill him about his corner-cutting. The smarmy Roger is immediately defensive. âWhat the hell business is it of yours anyway?â he asks bluntly in response to Dougâs accusations.\n\nâEvery piece of wire I put in that building is strictly up to code, inspected, and approved,â he says snootily. Doug reminds the electrical engineer that he specifically asked for the wiring to be well above code, but Roger is once again dismissive. âYou live in a dream world. I deal in realities,â he sniffs.\n\nLooking for Roger Simmonsâ lavish house in real life? You can find this The Towering Inferno location at 2898 Vallejo Street, on the corner of Baker Street in Pacific Heights. Itâs quite a sought-after neighborhood home to some very expensive real estate, and itâs just a short walk away from the Lyon Street Steps tourist attraction."
