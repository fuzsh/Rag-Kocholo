        "text": "The Towering Inferno is a 1974 American disaster film about a massive fire that breaks out during the opening of the world's tallest building in San Francisco.\n\nDirected by John Guillermin, Irwin Allen. Screenplay by Stirling Silliphant. Produced by Irwin Allen.\n\nOne Tiny Spark Becomes A Night Of Blazing Suspense. Taglines\n\nChief Michael O'Halloran\n\n[edit]\n\nNow you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire in any place above the seventh floor, but you guys just keep building them as high as you can.\n\nFor what it's worth, Architect, this is one building that I figured wouldn't burn.\n\nWhen there's a fire, I outrank everybody here.\n\nOh they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring them up.\n\nJames Duncan\n\n[edit]\n\nNow Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker is hardly conclusive.\n\n(on the phone with Doug) Doug, I think you're overreacting. Now, I feel sorry for Will Giddings, but he'll be taken care of. But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81, because it can't possibly affect us up here! Not in this building! Now, have someone call me when the fire department arrives. In the meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come up to join the party, now come on! (hangs up the phone)\n\nDid you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?\n\nFor God sakes, why?!\n\nWe've got a fire, and if it was caused by anything you did I'm going to hang you out to dry, and then I'm going to hang you!\n\nLadies and gentlemen. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? It seems that we have a small fire. In one of our storage rooms, 50 floors below. Now I assure you there's no danger. But in accordance with the fire department's orders, a purely precautionary procedure, we're going to have to move the party down to the lobby for a while and we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our Continental Room. But I promise you - dinner will not be delayed. Now if we can all move to the elevators.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm sorry. You'll have to move back into the Promenade Room, and we'll be taking you down by the scenic elevator. Now these express elevators can be activated by fire. And with the probability of short circuits, the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is. So please we'll use the scenic elevator, over there. (a panicked group of guests enter an express elevator anyway despite Duncan's warnings) FOR GOD'S SAKE, GET OUT OF THERE! (elevator door closes with the panicked guests in the elevator car, which would soon bring them to their firey doom) Please, back!! (pushes the elevator button to try to get the elevator car back up to cancel the trip down, but to no avail)\n\n(on the security phone) Security, this is Duncan. Have the main breakers gone? (whispering to Senator Parker after getting the bad news) The whole system's failed.\n\nDoug Roberts\n\n[edit]\n\nUrgency? Hey Dunc, if that fire was caused by fluky wiring in this building, we could get fires breaking out EVERYWHERE!!!\n\nI don't know. Maybe they just oughta leave it the way it is. Kind of a shrine to all the the bullshit in the world.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\n(Opening lines - Duncan and Roberts board an elevator from the roof to the 65th floor)\n\nJames Duncan: So, how was it?\n\nDoug Roberts: Good.\n\nJames Duncan: You're gonna go ahead, huh?\n\nDoug Roberts: Full steam.\n\nJames Duncan: Anything I can do to change your mind?\n\nDoug Roberts: Nope, no way.\n\nJames Duncan: You know there's an old saying that, uh, 'No matter how hot it gets up there during the day, there's -'\n\nDoug Roberts: '-not a damn thing to do in the night', right?\n\nJames Duncan: That's right. Now just what the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?\n\nDoug Roberts: Sleep like a winner.\n\nJames Duncan: Doug, you're a city boy with a low threshold for boredom. You'll be back in two weeks. (The elevator arrives on the 65th floor) Can you come in the office for a minute?\n\nDoug Roberts: I got people waiting upstairs.\n\nJames Duncan: Well what I wanted to tell you is that Senator Parker's flying in for the dedication tonight. And he's almost guaranteed the Urban Renewal contract. Now do you know what that means? Skyscrapers like this all over the country! You design 'em, I'll build 'em.\n\nDoug Roberts: (Boarding an elevator for the 79th floor) Jim I think you suffer from an edifice complex.\n\nJames Duncan: You'll never leave.\n\nDoug Roberts: Right after the party. Come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie.\n\nDoug Roberts: Can I talk at all?\n\nSusan Franklin: No. It's my lunch hour.\n\nDoug Roberts: Well I'm not a cheeseburger, you know.\n\nSusan Franklin: You're better - all protein, no bread. All I need to go with you is about eight glasses of water.\n\nDoug Roberts: All I need to go with you is in that suitcase over there.\n\nSusan Franklin: What's in that suitcase over there?\n\nDoug Roberts: I got about $140 worth of vulgar underwear for ya.\n\nSusan Franklin: First things first. (Susan opens a door to a private room)\n\nDoug Roberts: That's nice.\n\nSusan Franklin: Years from now when they talk about this and they will, remember to tell them that it was my idea.\n\nDoug Roberts: Yeah, right.\n\n(Doug and Will stride into Jim Duncan's office with the burned-out wire from the basement)\n\nJames Duncan: I know, I know. Callahan called me. Now just how bad is it?\n\nDoug Roberts: Depends on how good your imagination is. (Roberts drops the burned wire on Duncan's desk) Jesus Christ. Specs called for Conduit safety covering!\n\nJames Duncan: How many fuse terminals did you check?\n\nDoug Roberts: How many do I have to?\n\n(Intercom buzzes)\n\nJames Duncan: Yes?\n\nDuncan's Secretary: Mr. Bigelow's here, sir.\n\nJames Duncan: Ok, send him in. Now Doug, one piece of scorched wire from a burned-out circuit breaker is hardly conclusive.\n\nDoug Roberts: Maybe not. But after that I'm worried about what other shocks we're in for!\n\n(Dan Bigelow walks into the office)\n\nDan Bigelow: Will, Doug, J.D., wait 'til you see this. (Bigelow opens a box containing golden scissors for the Tower's dedication but the men do not react) What happened? Somebody hang the wallpaper upside down?\n\nJames Duncan: We have an equipment problem.\n\nDan Bigelow: No problem in the Tower is there?\n\nDoug Roberts: Could be.\n\nJames Duncan: Oh now come on Doug. You're just guessing!\n\nDoug Roberts: Alright I'm just guessing. But I wanna talk to that son-in-law of yours and I wanna talk to him right away.\n\nJames Duncan: Ok. (Talking to his secretary on the intercom) Get me Roger Simmons.\n\nDuncan's Secretary: Yes, sir.\n\nWill Giddings: We're going to check this thing out Mr. Duncan, I guarantee you.\n\nJames Duncan: Sure, sure, we're all going to check it out.\n\nDan Bigelow: (clearly confused) I'm missing something.\n\nDoug Roberts: We damn near had a fire.\n\n(Bigelow shoots a look of genuine surprise at Doug)\n\nDoug Roberts: Yeah. A fire.\n\nDan Bigelow: In this building? Come on.\n\nWill Giddings: You know we haven't even finished installing the safety equipment? The party should have been put off for at least another month...\n\nJames Duncan: (Duncan cuts Giddings off) Now hold it Will, hold it! Everybody's overreacting! (Intercom buzzes) Yes?\n\nDuncan's Secretary: Mr. Simmons is out, sir.\n\nJames Duncan: (clearly frustrated at this development) Out where?\n\nDuncan's Secretary: They don't know, sir, but I left word for him to call.\n\nJames Duncan: (to his secretary) Ok. (pauses before speaking to Doug) We'll talk to Roger tomorrow. And then we'll decide what to do, that's ok isn't it?\n\nDoug Roberts: No, it won't wait! (Roberts and Giddings leave)\n\nRoger Simmons: Hi Doug. Honey.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: Hello.\n\nRoger Simmons: What are you drinking these days?\n\nDoug Roberts: Nothing right now.\n\nRoger Simmons: Well, welcome back from the wilderness. To what do we owe the pleasure?\n\nDoug Roberts: Callahan was testing a backup generator. There was a power surge and a systems failure.\n\nRoger Simmons: How can that be?\n\nDoug Roberts: Well it can't be, theoretically. Unless you've been screwing around with the electrical specifications.\n\nRoger Simmons: That's being rather blunt, isn't it?\n\nDoug Roberts: You betcha.\n\nRoger Simmons: Well then you'll understand my being equally blunt. What the hell business is it of yours anyway?\n\nDoug Roberts: Well I'm just wondering what kind of kickbacks were involved.\n\nRoger Simmons: I don't have to take crap from you.\n\nDoug Roberts: Now listen. We had an electrical flare-up in the main utility room. It looked to me like some of that wiring wasn't exactly what I asked for.\n\nRoger Simmons: Every piece of wire I put in that building is strictly up to code, inspected and approved.\n\nDoug Roberts: The code's not enough for that building. And you know it. That's why I asked for installations that were way, way above standard!\n\nRoger Simmons: Buddy you live in a dream world. I deal in realities.\n\nDoug Roberts: I want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders.\n\nRoger Simmons: It would take weeks to get that all together and someone with a lot more clout than you to make me do it!\n\nDoug Roberts: In my office, tomorrow, 9:00. (Roberts leaves)\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: They say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in Montana. Of course he was younger then, probably in better condition.\n\nRoger Simmons: You must have enjoyed all this immensely.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: No, I didn't. Actually, I'm depressed for both of us.\n\nRoger Simmons: What did you expect me do - punch him in the nose?\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: Roger, if you've done anything to Dad's building, God help you!\n\nRoger Simmons: Baby I don't need God's help, or your old man's, not anymore. So don't expect me to shake everytime Daddy barks, even if that's what you want me to do.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: All I want is the man I thought I married! But I guess we're running out of reasons to stay married, aren't we?\n\nRoger Simmons: It's getting late. We mustn't miss the party.\n\n(Roberts emerges from the elevator into his office)\n\nWill Giddings: Did you find Simmons?\n\nDoug Roberts: Yeah, I found him......\n\nWill Giddings: Well did he or didn’t he change your specs?\n\nDoug Roberts: He didn’t admit it, but two bucks will get you ten he did.\n\nWill Giddings: Payoffs and kickbacks, that’s the only way he could have swung it (assembles a pile of plans with the electrical specifications). Well, here you are. It's your original specs. Zone one only, but we gotta start somewhere.\n\n(Roberts shuffles the plans angrily)\n\nDoug Roberts: Son of a bitch gave us an impossible job.\n\n(Duncan and Simmons meet after having been introduced at the dedication ceremony)\n\nJames Duncan: Where were you all day?\n\nRoger Simmons: I wasn't aware the leash was that tight.\n\nJames Duncan: When I get the time I'll be asking you a few questions, and I expect some straight answers!\n\nDoug Roberts: (on the phone to security) Hello, this is 81, we've had an accident up here, a man's been burned, get an ambulance! Yes, right away!\n\nSecurity Chief Harry Jernigan: (as he and another man drag the badly injured Will Giddings to safety) Roberts, call Duncan in the tower! They got a lot of people there!\n\n(Roberts phones the Promenade Room)\n\nJames Duncan: Yeah Doug, we were getting worried about you. Susan's here, Senator Parker, the Mayor and his wife. Everybody wants to know why the world's greatest architect isn't here.\n\nDoug Roberts: Never mind about that. Will Giddings has been pretty badly burned.\n\nJames Duncan: (surprised) Will Giddings burned? How?!\n\nDoug Roberts: Look, I've already got an ambulance coming but you better think about getting those people upstairs down on the ground floor. (pause as Duncan asks why) What for? WE'VE GOT A FIRE HERE! (pause as Duncan asks the severity of the fire) Well, I think it's under control but....\n\nJames Duncan: Well then, uh, why the urgency?\n\nDoug Roberts: Urgency?! Hey Dunc if that fire was caused by fluky wiring in the building we could get fires breaking out everywhere!\n\nJames Duncan: Doug, I think you're overreacting. Now I feel sorry for Will Giddings but he'll be taken care of. (Duncan covers the speaker on the phone) But I am not going to concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 because it can't possibly affect us up here. Not in this building! Now have someone call me when the fire department arrives. In the meantime, get in your dinner jacket and come on up here and join the party. Now come on! (Duncan hangs up)\n\nDoug Roberts: I mean-(Roberts angrily hangs up)\n\n(Roberts and O'Halloran meet outside the building as the fire department arrives)\n\nKappy: Chief, this is Roberts, the architect.\n\nChief O'Halloran: What do we got here Kappy?\n\nKappy: Fire started, 81st floor, storage room. This is a bad one. Smoke is so thick we can't tell how far it's spread.\n\nChief O'Halloran: What about your exhaust system?\n\nDoug Roberts: Well it should have reversed automatically. It must have been a motor burn-out or something.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Sprinklers?\n\nDoug Roberts: They're not working on 81.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Why not?\n\nDoug Roberts: I don't know.\n\n(Roberts, O'Halloran & Kappy enter the lobby)\n\nChief O'Halloran: Jim?\n\nFirefighter: Yes sir.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Alright, give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system.\n\nDoug Roberts: Well, we got outlets on every floor, both 3 1/2\" inch.\n\nChief O'Halloran: GPM?\n\nDoug Roberts: 1500 from Ground to 68, 1000 from 68 to 100 and 500 from there to the roof.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Alright, you sure these elevators are programmed for emergency service?\n\nDoug Roberts: These two are.\n\nChief O'Halloran: What floor do you keep your plans on?\n\nDoug Roberts: 79, my office.\n\nChief O'Halloran: That's good, that's 2 floors below the fire. Alright, that'll be our Forward Command. Alright men, take up the equipment. Alright, let's go. (Roberts, O'Halloran, Kappy and a fireman board the elevator for the 79th floor)\n\nChief O'Halloran: Ok. Phew...architects.\n\nDoug Roberts: Yeah, it's all our fault.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Now you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor. But you guys just keep building them as high as you can.\n\nDoug Roberts: Hey, are you here to take me on, or the fire?\n\n(Jernigan is on a security phone just outside Doug Roberts' office)\n\nHarry Jernigan Okay, what about the Eighty-First floor, you got everybody out of there?\n\n(Jernigan glances to the elevator and sees Doug and firemen O'Halloran and Kappy enter)\n\nChief O'Halloran: (to Doug) I want to see all your floor plans, 81 to 85.\n\nDoug Roberts: Gotcha.\n\n(as Doug gathers his floor plans, O'Halloran points to the windows)\n\nChief O'Halloran: This is what I'm worried about, all those beams and glass.\n\n(Roberts is explaining the fire situation to O' Hallorhan)\n\nDoug Roberts: And they're celebrating... a party.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Party? What party? Where?\n\nDoug Roberts: In the Promenade Room. 300 people.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Well, why didn't you get them the hell out of there?\n\nDoug Roberts: Why don't you go upstairs and talk to Duncan? He ain't exactly listening to me.\n\nChief O'Halloran: I will.\n\nJames Duncan: You looking for me, Chief?\n\nChief O'Halloran: If you're Duncan, yeah.\n\nJames Duncan: I am. Everything under control?\n\nChief O'Halloran: We gotta move all these people outta here.\n\nJames Duncan: Oh now just how bad is it?\n\nChief O'Halloran: It's a fire, mister. And all fires are bad.\n\nJames Duncan: Well, uh, I don't believe you're familiar with the many modern safety systems we have designed into this building. We've got 'em all.\n\nChief O'Halloran: All right. It's your building, but it's our fire. Now let's get these people the hell out of here.\n\nJames Duncan: Now I don't think you're listening, Chief. There's no way for a fire on 81 to reach up here, not in this building!\n\nChief O'Halloran: Okay. I'll do it.\n\nJames Duncan: Hold it, hold it. The mayor's out there. Do you want me to pull rank on you?\n\nChief O'Halloran: When there's a fire, I outrank everybody here. Now one thing we don't want is a panic. Now I could tell them, but you oughta do it. Just make a nice cool announcement to all your guests and tell them the party's being moved down below the fire floor. Right now.\n\nJames Duncan: Patty - you and Susan stay right here where I can find you. Now don't leave this table. (Pointing to Roger) You I wanna talk to. (Duncan & Simmons walk away from the table) Did you change any of Doug's electrical specifications?\n\nRoger Simmons: I most certainly did.\n\nJames Duncan: For God's sakes why?\n\nRoger Simmons: The reason should be obvious - especially to you!\n\nJames Duncan: We've got a fire. And if it was caused by anything you did I'm going to hang you out to dry, and then I'm going to hang you!\n\n(After the evacuation has begun)\n\nRoger Simmons: I don't like the way you talk to me.\n\nJames Duncan: You drunk?\n\nRoger Simmons: Not yet.\n\nJames Duncan: Well then get out of my way!\n\nRoger Simmons: You didn't talk like this 2 years ago, did you? Running over budget and out of money. Did you ask me then how I could shave $2 million dollars off our electrical costs?\n\nJames Duncan: Shut up and help me with these people!\n\nRoger Simmons: And let me ask you my dear father-in-law: am I the only subcontractor you encouraged to cut corners? Where did you save the other $4 million in Doug's original budget?!\n\n(Doug gets a call for Harry Jernigan from the building's security station)\n\nDoug Roberts: Harry?\n\nHarry Jernigan: (picking up the phone) Jernigan.\n\n(Jernigan learns that Lisolette Mueller is trapped on the 87th floor trying to rescue the Allbright family)\n\nJernigan: What? Dammit man, you should have sent a man up there!\n\n(told the security station tried to telephone Mrs. Allbright)\n\nJernigan: How do you expect her to hear a phone call? She's deaf!\n\n(asked if her two children can hear)\n\nJernigan: Sure the kids can hear!\n\n(why they didn't respond to the phone)\n\nJernigan: I don't know, maybe they were in the shower or something when you called!\n\nKappy: (in background, speaking into his radio) Forward Command!\n\nJernigan: (still on the security phone) No, you stay where you are, I'll get them down!\n\nLorrie: There never were any firemen, were there?\n\nDan Bigelow: I said that to make it easier for you. I switched off the phones. There's no way to call out. Nobody knows we're up here.\n\nLorrie: Well, I always did want to die in bed.\n\nDan Bigelow: Nobody's going to die.\n\nLorrie: One thing - at least they'll never find out about us, will they?\n\n(Dan soaks a towel in water, wraps it around his head and decides to make a run for help)\n\nDan Bigelow: I used to run the 100 in 10 flat.\n\nLorrie: Don't go.\n\nDan Bigelow: I'll be back with the whole fire department. On your mark...\n\nSenator Parker: At this rate, it's going to take a couple of hours to get everyone down. So I would suggest that those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines start using the stairs.\n\nJames Duncan: That's 135 floors.\n\nSenator Parker: All downhill.\n\n(Simmons returns to the Promenade Room after his failed attempt to escape down the stairs)\n\nRoger Simmons: Pretty ridiculous spectacle, right? There's no way down.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: Oh, thank God you're all right! Oh Roger, what are we going to do?\n\nRoger Simmons: I know what I'm going to do. Get quietly drunk.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: If you're responsible for all this, I know...what you must be feeling.\n\nRoger Simmons: You don't even know the meaning of the word.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: What, \"Responsible\"?\n\nRoger Simmons: \"Feeling\"! Oh, you know a lot about responsibility; it's a family trait. The Duncans are very big in the responsibility department - at least on the surface!\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: That's not fair! I don't think it's wrong to feel a, a sense of, of duty!\n\nRoger Simmons: Sometimes, when you turn the exact same phrase, lift an eyebrow the exact same way, I see and I hear your father. The two of you, one! Like a great big tree and a little baby tree in its shade where the acorn fell.\n\nPatty Duncan Simmons: Roger, I came over here to you because I-I thought you might need me!\n\nRoger Simmons: Right now, what I need most, is this. (grabs the glass and bottle of vodka)\n\nHarlee Claiborne: I promised myself if I every saw you again I'd make a full confession-\n\nLisolette Mueller: No, but thank you.\n\nHarlee Claiborne: But, you don't know anything about me.\n\nLisolette Mueller: But I do. You're penniless. You have no villa in the south of France. No antiques coming, no paintings. But Harlee, I don't care.\n\nHarlee Claiborne: I'm a cheap tin horn. A two-bit con-man.\n\nLisolette Mueller: Not cheap. Maybe unsuccessful. But don't you see your heart isn't it? How can you cheat people effectively if you don't really enjoy cheating?\n\nHarlee Claiborne: I brought you up here tonight to see you a thousand shares of Greater Anaheim Power & Light!\n\nLisolette Mueller: Is it a good investment?\n\nHarlee Claiborne: There is no Greater Anaheim Power & Light! Only the certificate I had printed. I must say I think you would've admired the artwork...beautiful engraving.\n\nLisolette Mueller: I'd like to see it.\n\nHarlee Claiborne: It's in my jacket. I-I took the jacket off - it was \"needed elsewhere\". You see what I mean? I can't even deliver a phony stock certificate. Did you hear what I said?\n\nLisolette Mueller: Every word.\n\nHarlee Claiborne: Well then tell me you're shocked, or at least disappointed.\n\nLisolette Mueller: But I'm not.\n\nHarlee Claiborne: You must be!\n\nLisolette Mueller: Harlee, I'm not.\n\nDoug Roberts: Will Giddings is dead. He died 20 minutes ago. Oh boy. Oh, I wonder how many more will be dead by tomorrow. I thought we were building something, where people could work and live and be SAFE! If you had to cut costs, why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?\n\nJames Duncan: Now listen, any decisions that were made, for the use of alternate building materials, were made because I as a builder have a right to make those decisions. If I remain within the building code and goddammit I did!\n\nDoug Roberts: Building code, Jesus. Building code, c'mon now Dunc I mean that's a standard cop-out when you're in trouble. I was crawling around up there. I mean duct holes weren't fire-stopped! Corridors without fire doors in them, sprinklers won't work, and an electrical system that's good for what? I mean it's good for starting fires! Phew, boy where was I when all this was going on? Because I'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son-in-law of yours! What do they call it when you kill people?\n\nRoger Simmons: The women are gone. We are going next. (Simmons tears up a bunch of breeches buoy tickets)\n\nJames Duncan: (punches Simmons in his stomach) You've all got numbers, and you're going to take your turn! And if it's any consolation, I'm going to be the last one out of here, along with my son-in-law!\n\nChief O'Halloran: It's out of control. And it's coming your way. You've got about 15 minutes. Now they wanna try something. They wanna blow those water tanks 2 floors above you - they think it might kill the fire.\n\nDoug Roberts: How are they gonna get the explosives up here?\n\nChief O'Halloran: Oh they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring 'em up.\n\nDoug Roberts: Hang on, I'll tell 'em. (Roberts goes to tell the remaining guests) They wanna try to put out the fire by blowing up the water tanks above us. It's gonna mean a lot of water and steel and concrete but if they don't try it...we're all gonna burn. The fire's out of control below us. They think we got maybe 15 minutes. This way, some of us might survive. We've got no options. (the fire breaks into the Promenade Room, the guests panic and make a run for the Breeches Buoy. Simmons gets there first, and fights his way on, and a fight breaks out among the men to get him off. An explosion destroys the ropes sending Simmons, Senator Parker and several others to their deaths)\n\nChief O'Halloran: Yeah?\n\nDoug Roberts (returning to the phone) Well, we just lost the Breeches Buoy, there was a panic up here. It's under control now.\n\nChief O'Halloran: Ok, now I'm going to try and set down on the roof, I'm gonna need you up there.\n\nDoug Roberts: Well I know how where to place the charges, but I don't know how.\n\nChief O'Halloran: I know how.\n\nDoug Roberts: Ok. See you up there.\n\n(James Duncan and Patty Duncan Simmons meet and embrace for the first time since being rescued, presumably after Patty has identified Roger Simmons' body)\n\nJames Duncan: I didn't want you to see him.\n\n(Patty sobs uncontrollably and embraces her father)\n\nJames Duncan: You know, there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead but.....(pauses and gazes back up at the smoking tower)..all I can do now is pray to God, that I can stop this from ever happening again.\n\n(last lines)\n\nChief O'Halloran: You know we were lucky tonight. Body count's less than 200. You know, one of these days you're gonna kill 10,000 in one of these firetraps, and I'm gonna keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies until somebody asks us... how to build them.\n\nDoug Roberts: (turns to look at the scorched upper floors of the Tower and then back to O'Halloran) Okay, I'm asking.\n\nChief O'Halloran: You know where to reach me. So long, architect.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nOne Tiny Spark Becomes A Night Of Blazing Suspense.\n\nThe tallest building in the world is on fire. You are there with 294 other guests...
