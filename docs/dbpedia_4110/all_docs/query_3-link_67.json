        "text": "The special effects are super and once you get used to the idea of a 136-story building in downtown San Francisco, you are ready for anything thrown at you.\n\nFull Review | Jun 27, 2023\n\nNearly 50 years after its release, The Towering Inferno remains one of the golden standards in the disaster thriller genre.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Mar 2, 2023\n\nThis is a loud, bombastic, dumb blockbuster and it just doesnâ€™t thrill audiences in the same way that it would have in 1974. I really question whether it became a sensation purely as a result of hype.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: D | Feb 7, 2023\n\nRather than being a reflection of the true terror of a fire, this is a romp of a disaster movie, with some big, fun set pieces, heroes to root for, and villains to boo.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jun 23, 2021\n\nThe use of real stunts and real fires lend to a staggering visual design with stellar cinematography to match.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Aug 31, 2020\n\nAn absolutely spectacular cast, and a top-notch technical team, are the pillars on which 'The Towering Inferno' is based, a film built with the precision of an architect. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Sep 4, 2019\n\nDespite the best efforts of most of those involved, the film never takes off as more than just a remarkable collection of glossy violence.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Sep 11, 2014\n\nThe movie doesn't stick together in one's head; this thing is like some junky fairground show -- a chamber of horrors with skeletons that jump up.\n\nFull Review | Jan 15, 2013\n\nThe result is everything a disaster movie should be, a combination of soap opera and the spectacle of destruction.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Feb 3, 2012\n\nIronically, there's now something almost comforting about the way the film sticks to formula, but the action is still authentically thrilling.\n\nFull Review | Feb 3, 2012\n\nIrwin Allen, the Busby Berkeley of natural disasters and other people's troubles, teams up with John Guillermin, a competent if undistinguished action director.\n\nFull Review | Feb 3, 2012\n\nA Titanic tale of hubris...knot-in-the-stomach scary from the moment the fire gets out of control to the last-ditch heroics that come hours later. [Blu-ray]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 28, 2009\n\nbreak out the popcorn, sit back, and enjoy a galaxy of stars picking up their fat paychecks and having a great time. They absolutely don't make 'em like this anymore\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | May 13, 2009"
