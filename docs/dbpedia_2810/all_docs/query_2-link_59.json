        "text": "“Talk about talent, he writes, he draws, he screenwrites, and he directs, and he is tops at all those things.” That’s comic book Marvel icon Stan Lee talking about another legend in the comic book and film world, Frank Miller, who is lauded in the upcoming doc “Frank Miller: American Genius.”\n\nKnown for a celebrated run at Marvel and DC Comics, the former most notably with “Daredevil,” and “Wolverine,” the latter more known for his “The Dark Knight Returns” series and “Batman: Year One,” Frank Miller is definitely comic book royalty. He’s also moved into the world of movies, writing “RoboCop 2” and ‘3,’ early on, and then moving into co-directed on the “Sin City” movies with Robert Rodriguez, executive producing Zack Snyder’s “300,” based on his comic and solo directing his own feature with 2008’s “The Spirit.” This immense career is all tacked in ‘American Genius,’ coming to theaters, briefly, next month.\n\nREAD MORE: Summer Movie Preview: 50 Must-See Films To Watch\n\nToday, Picturehouse announced a special one-night-only theatrical showing of the feature docu and released the official trailer.
