        "text": "'Barney Baxter'. Danish-language version.\n\nFrank Miller sold his first cartoon in 1919 and slowly built up his professional reputation. By the mid-1920s, Miller decided to make cartooning his full-time profession, working for the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News. In 1936, Frank Miller went over to King Features Syndicate, creating 'Barney Baxter'. In 1942, he left the strip to Bob Naylor and joined the US Coast Guard, but in 1948 King Features Syndicate convinced Miller to resume his feature for awhile. One of several comic artists who would appear with the same name, Frank Miller died of a heart attack on December 3, 1949, at his home in Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nHe should not be confused with American comic artist Frank Miller (Â°1957), of 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' fame."
