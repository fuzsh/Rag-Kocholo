        "text": "Frank Nelson MILLER (1858 – 1903) is Alex’s Great Great Grandfather; one of eight in this generation of his line.\n\nFrank Nelson Miller was born on 18 June 1858 in Utica, Dane, Wisconsin. His parents were George MILLER and Mary ESTEY. Frank married Agnes Genevieve HENRY on 4 Jan 1896 in Fresno, Calif.

Miler and Miss Agnes Henry were united in wedlock yesterday noon at the residence of Lester E. Walker on East Ventura Street. Rev. I.D. Wood performed the ceremony. Only the relatives of the contracting paries were present. The ceremony took place in the parlor which had been tastily decorated with trailing vines for the occasion. The bride was attended by her sister Miss. Kathryn Henry. Afer the brief, but impressive ceremony had been performed all sat down to a wedding dinner.\n\nThose present were Mr. and Mrs. L. E. Walker, Miss Kathryn Henry, Miss. Alice Miller of Santa Rose, Miss Florence Puffer, Miss Mabel Morris and Ira A. Miller of San Jose.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Miller left on last evening’s train for San Diego where they will make their home. Miss. Agnes Henry has been a teacher in the schools of this county for the past ten years, six in the schools of this city. During this time she has gained a wide circle of friends besides establishing a reputation as a successful teacher.\n\nMr. Miller is well known in pedagogical circles in the state having been elected vice president of the State Teacher’s Association which is in session in Oakland. He at present occupies a position as teacher in the polytechnic department of the San Diego high school. He was formerly principal of the Fresno colon school in this county. The Republican joins with the many friends of the happy couple in extending its best wishes to them,\n\nFrank was Principal at the San Diego Commercial High School in 1897 when his son Henry was born. According to family legend, he held a contest at school to pick Henry’s middle name. Guess what name the kids chose? — Commercial! The commercial department was in the Montezuma building on F street. It was merged with the old Russ High School (future San Diego High School) in 1902.\n\nF. N.

N. Miller of the commercial high school started a movement to establish a Red Cross society in San Diego. The only authorized society on the West Coast at that time was in San Francisco. Twenty Red Cross nurses accompanied the first Philippine expedition. Frank was a member of the Royal Arcanum and of the Fraternal Aid.\n\nHis outstanding characteristics were love of children, considerate, persevering, capable and thorough.\n\nAgnes attended high school in a convent. was a normal school graduate from San Jose Normal School. and was a teacher before she married.\n\nAgnes was very gentle, easy to get along with, but had strong likes and dislikes. Thrifty, very generous. Full of energy. A very agreeable companion. Keen sense of humor. Member OES Amaranth\n\nAfter Frank died young (he was a principal in Willows CA at the time), Agnes took her two young children, Genevieve and Henry, and went to Sebastopol, California were there were Miller relatives. Eugene Edgar Miller was living in the North Sebastobol Precinct in the Analy Township, Somona County in the 1900 census.. Analy has been Sebastopol’s high school name since 1908. Eugene was married to Lillian M Horton and they had nine children living at home at the time. Lillian was born 1857 in Minnesota.\n\nEugene’s family arrived in Sebastopol, CA in 1891. Eugene’s widow Lillian, in her old age, said that one spring after a particularly hard winter in Wisconsin. Eugene threw down the snow shovel and said he was never going to shovel any more ****** snow.\n\nEugene’s son surmised he and his brother Frank Miller (Genevieve’s father) decided to buy the 40 acres that their brother Ira had cleared and planted to orchard. Neighbors who knew of the tremendous effort he made to develop the place said he was a powerful and vigorous man. [from a letter to Genevieve Miller from her cousin Clarence]\n\nEugene was seven years older than Frank and my guess is he tried to be in charge of Agnes’ affairs. Agnes was probably eager to be on her own again. She was 33 when she got married and had been on her own for a long time before she married.\n\nGenevieve was fond of Uncle Gene and Aunt Lillian. Their daughter Etta married Edward Nelson, and she and mother corresponded. Genevieve always went to visit Etta when she was in Northern California. My mother remembers driving down a dirt road to a ranch house to visit them when her family went on the famous trip to Victoria in the summer of 1941.\n\nIn the 1930 census, Frank’s son Henry Commercial was an Insurance Comptroller in San Francisco for the Worker’s Compensation Fund living as a single man with his widowed mother. came came to Genevieve’s funeral in 1965, and later came out to the house to meet me. My mom has a sweet memory of him holding me on his lap and reading a story. He was very close to my grandmother , particularly after their mother died, and he spent time in San Diego on vacations. He always sent my mom birthday present—an Oz book. Obviously my grandmother’s suggestion. My mom used to look at the titles listed in order and figure out how old she would have to be to get them all. When they family went to San Francisco, they would meet him for lunch for a visit.\n\nChildren of Eugene and Lillian\n\ni. Alice Esther Miller (8 Mar 1878 Lincoln, Worth, Iowa – 11 Mar 1955) m.

William Henry Miller (24 Sep 1896 Sonoma Califonia – 15 Jan 1911)\n\nThe home Nancy Blair was born in was built by her Grandmother Agnes in 1908 and was something of an architectural center piece, designed by an architect named Irving Gill who went opn the achieve personal recognition in Los Angeles\n\nFrank is listed as Franklin Miller age 2 in the 1860 census Utica, Wisconsin\n\nFrank was 22 and living with his mother in Oshkosh, Winnebago, Wisconsin in the 1880 census.\n\nChildren\n\n1. Henry Commercial Miller\n\nHenry’s wife Dorothea Carr was born 13 Mar 1910 in Oak Park, Illinois. Her parents were Peter G. Carr and Caroline Francis “Carrie” Taft (Sep. 1845 Pennsylvania – 6 Dec 1919, Cook County Illinois) Peter married Blanche E Simpson, daughter of William Simpson & 1st wife, Eliza A. (Summers), on 1 September 1908 in Berrien, Michigan. Dorothea died 7 Apr 1991 in Alameda County, California .\n\nDorothea’s father Peter George Carr was born 24 Dec 1881 in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were George Patrick Carr (b. Feb 1848 in Scotland) and Carolyn (Carrie) S. Toff (b. Sep 1847 in Pennsylvania). In his 1918 Draft Registation, Peter was an Importer for the US Navy at the Union Iron Works in San Francisco and living at the corner of Magee Ave and Summit Ave in Mill Valley. In the 1920 census, Peter was living in Sausalito and working as an Electrical Engineer. In the 1930 census, Peter, Blanche and Dorothea were living in Mill Valley. In the 1940 census, Peter and Blanche lived at 394 Magee Avenue in Mill Valley. The home was built in 1915 since Peter was living there in 1918, I assume he was the original owner. Zillow.com’s current market estimate is $2.2 M. Peter died 14 May 1963 in San Francisco.\n\nThis 3255 square foot single family home has 3 bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms. It is located at 394 Magee Ave Mill Valley, California.\n\nDorothea’s mother Blanche Simpson was born 3 Apr 1881 in Michigan. Her parents were William Simpson (b.Nov 1841 Indiana) and Lucy L. Farley (b. Jul 1856 in Michigan) (It’s possible I have her parents birth states wrong because her census records are inconsistent. 1910 shows Indiana and Michigan, 1920 shows Maryland and Michigan and 1930 shows Maryland and Maryland. William and Lucy did live in Berrien, Michigan where Blanche is buried) Blanche died 24 Oct 1945 in San Francisco and is buried in Long Lake Cemetery, in Berrien, Berrien, Michigan.\n\nIn the 1930 census, Henry was living with his widowed mother in San Francisco and working as a Comptroller in an Insurance Company. Agnes’ record states that her parents were from Northern Ireland, so maybe they weren’t Catholic after all. Curiously, Agnes’ 1920 census report states her parents were from Massachusetts and in the 1900 census she said her father was from Massachusetts and her mother from Ireland.\n\nAncestry.com has indexed the California 1940 census. Henry was a Comptroller at State Compensation. Henry’s income was over $5,000 (a bit higher than his neighbors) Dorothea was a freelance magazine writer. Note she was 13 years younger. My grandmother discouraged his interest in a nice young woman that was a family friend because she was so much younger. She thought the final result was ironic.\n\nThe Millers lived at 35 Lower Crescent Ave Sausalito. Here’s the google maps street view\n\nThe house is listed on Zillow for $1.8 M\n\nBuilt 1921\n\nValued in 1940 at $4,000\n\nLast sold 1994 for $844,500\n\nThis 2840 square foot single family home has 2 bedrooms and 3.0 bathrooms. It is located at 35 Lower Crescent Ave Sausalito, California.
