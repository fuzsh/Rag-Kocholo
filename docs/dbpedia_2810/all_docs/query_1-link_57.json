        "text": "Why do people revere history and clamor to find out all they can about our past?\n\nSarah Lim, executive director of the Merced County Historical Society, quickly answers that question by saying history helps define who we are. So a glimpse into the past was the key element Sunday as the historical society held its annual meeting and learned quite a bit about one of the county’s pioneers, Westside land baron Henry Miller.\n\nSunday’s meeting was held in the Merced County Board of Supervisors chambers and all 114 seats were filled during the 90-minute meeting which saw highlights of 2022 reviewed and hopes for 2023 unveiled, along with election of new officers.\n\nResidents from throughout the county, including Merced, Gustine, Hilmar, Los Banos, Dos Palos, Atwater and Livingston, formed impromptu cheering sessions during the meeting as historical development projects in their area were discussed.\n\nLongtime historical society board member and retired educator Charlie Galatro has a connection with Henry Miller. His great-grandparents lived on Miller’s sprawling ranches and had a front-row seat into his life and dealings.\n\nGalatro said Miller was a genius of a man. He knew all about land, water, people and animals. A native of Germany, Miller came to San Francisco by boat with $5 in his pocket and ultimately amassed a $50 million fortune, the equivalent of $1 billion now.\n\nMiller, more widely known on the county’s Westside, owned one million acres of land and had a million cattle. At one time he owned land along 100 miles of the San Joaquin River. Miller’s ranches were purposely located near the water and the soil was fertile and productive.\n\nGalatro, a retired McSwain Union School District superintendent and former director of the Merced County Office of Education’s Camp Green Meadows outdoor education facility near Fish Camp. His great-grandparents, Donato Giliberti and Frank Chappell, were Miller’s tenants.\n\nGalatro’s relatives showed one part of Miller’s commitment to his enterprise and the people who worked with him. Galatro’s great grandpa borrowed $5,000 from Miller but was only able to repay $500 of that debt – Miller forgave the rest of his obligation.\n\nMiller knew the need for cattle would be great and partnered with Charles Lux on the early herds. Miller had his own philosophy of raising cattle — you don’t hurry them along when you are driving them to market. The fat on these cattle’s flanks is worth a lot more than the convenience of the cowboys herding them through Pacheco Pass and ultimately San Francisco slaughterhouses.\n\nMiller didn’t sit behind a desk while his empire was developing. He was out on the range as it grew little by little. Galatro said Miller bought 16 land grants, much of it swampland. He soon discovered if you drained the swamps, the land was good for growing alfalfa.\n\nMiller’s farms were dotted with long and massive rolls of hay for his cattle. Wheat became an important crop, joined by vineyards, gardens and orchards. Sheep and pigs soon became part of Miller’s ranching operation as well.\n\n“Henry Miller was a very crafty man. He loaned money to many people. There were two sides to him; if he liked you you were good. By the end of one day, he forgave $300,000 in loans owed him. He took care of everything,” Galatro said.\n\nAmongst many pictures of Miller’s cowboys, one notices the foremen of those groups always wore a necktie. Miller became known as the father of the Western rodeos as he promoted equestrian competition among his horsemen.\n\nMiller was among the first ranchers to have a steam-powered tractor and soon had modern harvesting equipment. State laws required farms to have their acreages corralled and Miller built a milling plant in Los Banos where he built redwood fences 75 miles long.\n\n“He was an amazing man. He died in 1916 at the age of 89; in 1915 he went to a San Francisco ag expo but spent all his time in the stock barn. At Christmas, he would bring walnuts and apples to give out at schools,” Galatro said.\n\nDan Nelson, president of the Milliken Museum Society in Los Banos, also spoke about Miller, saying the land baron left many legacies. He had a profound influence in state and local water development programs. When Miller started out, California was seen as a fresh start for adventurous individuals, with a good climate and productive land. The state attracted immigrants who were risk-takers and investors.\n\nMiller ultimately took over the founding water companies in the Valley and ultimately had a canal system from 1870 to 1900, with many of these canals still in service years later.\n\n“Miller played a major part in developing California water rights. The land was a blueprint for development and MIller built communities and his legacy is felt throughout the San Joaquin Valley,” Nelson said."
