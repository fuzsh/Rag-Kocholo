        "text": "In 1986, writer and artist Frank Miller was only 29 years old when he tackled the comic that cemented his place among the icons: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Along with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, Miller told the tale of a 55-year-old Bruce Wayne coming out of retirement to restore order in a Gotham City that had long ago moved past Batman. Along the way, the series introduced Carrie Kelley as the first female Robin, gave viewers a horrific final showdown between Batman and the Joker, and featured a legendary battle with Superman.\n\nThe Dark Knight Returns reinvigorated Batman as a much darker hero than before. It also inspired decades of comics that came after it, as well as an animated film adaptation. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice also seized upon the confrontation between DC's top superheroes. But according to Miller, the Man of Steel wasn't in the original outline for the story!\n\n\"When I first put together The Dark Knight Returns, my initial version of it didn't even have Superman,\" said Miller. \"It was just Batman against criminals and cops. Then, I realized that inevitably, Bruce was heading towards a conflict with Superman.\"\n\nFor better or worse, The Dark Knight Returns changed the industry. According to Janson, \"Dark Knight gets the credit and the blame [for the comics that came after]. I'll share with you that [editor] Dick Giordano, many years after Dark Knight Returns, said to me [that] he regretted that.\""
