The 13 episode series stars Charlie Cox in the titular role of Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil), and launches the TV universe that will include AKA Jessica Jones, Luke …\n\nContinue reading\n\nWelcome to Behind the Panels, the comic book show that’s coming to you live from Oz Comic Con. In this issue, Supergirl might come to TV, writer and beard enthusiast Alan Moore writes a book and the new Batmobile is sighted. THEN Wolverine is still not dead, things get pretty ‘Fly’ and ‘Some Kinds of …\n\nContinue reading\n\nThe long-awaited sequel makes a few sins of its own in a faithful yet uninspiring retread of Frank Miller’s classic series. It’s been almost a decade since Sin City burst onto our screens with a swagger that only comes from something truly original. In the development hell of the intervening years, countless imitators have come and …\n\nContinue reading\n\nIn this issue, prepare for some pulp fiction Marvel teams up with the Florida Department of Citrus. THEN Grant Morrison enters a contest for the longest title of a DC comic as The Multiversity: The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World. ALSO it’s Original Sin, Futures End and more in what we’ve been reading. PLUS our Kick-Ass Pick …\n\nContinue reading\n\nWelcome to Issue 91 of Behind the Panels, the comic book show that tried to dine in Hell, but couldn’t get reservations. In this issue, Scarlet Johannson’s Avengers scenes get bumped because of baby news. Fox and Marvel are currently discussing joint custody rights. THEN it’s a new Batman game from Rocksteady, where you get …\n\nContinue reading\n\nThe mostly unlikely sequel acts as a companion piece to 300, bringing with it more of Miller’s trademark broads, blood and blades by swapping Spartans for Athenians. Zack “Snack” Snyder‘s adaptation of Frank Miller and Lynn Varley’s 300 was an almost literal interpretation of the graphic novel origins, a vision that could come from nothing else …\n\nContinue reading\n\n“Just another Saturday night.” So begins our first glimpse at Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, Robert Rodriguez’s long-awaiting follow-up to 2005’s Sin City, the visually stunning adaptation of Frank Miller’s series of hard-boiled and gritty slices of pulp heaven. Featuring almost all of the original cast, the official synopsis keeps the story simple: …\n\nContinue reading\n\nIn this first issue for 2014, it’s the return of Chris Claremont! Expect a 12-part crossover series of his origin from Marvel. THEN, Ant-Man takes Batman Vs. Superman’s old release date. That’s a joke that writes itself. ALSO, what we’ve been reading, we get tongue twisted with the news headlines PLUS our Kick-Ass Pick of …\n\nContinue reading\n\nIt was the best of times and the worst of times for Green Arrow in the 1980s. Entering his fourth decade of his publication history, he was still yet to see his own solo title.
