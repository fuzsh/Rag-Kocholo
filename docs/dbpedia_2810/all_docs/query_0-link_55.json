        "text": "METRO: Where did you work ?\n\nGROENING: I had a series of lousy jobs. I washed dishes in an old folks' home last summer. I was landscaping in a sewage treatment plant. I moved to L.A. in 1977 from Portland. Oregon. I was born in 1954, and went to school in the Northwest, after I graduated from Evergreen College in Washington. I moved to Los Angeles, because it was the city in which writers were the most overpaid in the world. Finally I saw an ad in the L.A. Times: \"writer/chauffeur.\" I answered that ad and I got the job. I drove an 88-year-old movie director around during the day, and at night my job was to sit at his desk and ghost-write his autobiography. During the day, while I drove him around, he would point out the sights and explain to me about his life. Unfortunately, he was going senile. So one day he would tell me, \"That is where Cary Grant used to live,\" and the next day, \"Yes, John Wayne and I spent many an evening there.\" And so on. [Was this mysterious figure the progenitor of Abe Simpson?] His manuscript was already over a thousand pages; previous writer/chauffeurs had already been working on this magnificent tome. Unfortunately, the book was totally obsessed with the director's mother; he'd lived with her until she was 105 years old. And every single part of the book was about her. \"To-day I met Cecil B. DeMille. I ran home immediately to tell mother.\""
