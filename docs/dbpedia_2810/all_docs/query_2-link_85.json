Flip or Flop stars Christina El Moussa and Tarek El Moussa revealed that their contractor and longtime friend Frank Miller passed away on Nov. 17, after losing his long battle with cancer.\n\n\"Good bye My dear friend Frank,\" Tarek wrote in an emotional letter to his lost pal on Instagram. \"I have always looked up to you and have respected you as a brother. You have touched not only myself and my family but thousands and thousands around the world. You have impacted so many lives with the fight inside your heart and soul. I've never met anyone like you nor will I ever. I just love you love you love you more than you know! I will NEVER forget you and I hope to one day be as strong as you. Now…don't slack!!!! I assume you are already working on remodeling heaven!!!!:):). Miss you buddy!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\"\n\nChristina was equally torn up, writing \"Frank since the day I met you I had the utmost respect for you. Hardworking and REAL. Always a pleasure to be around and always made me laugh. You fought your hardest!! You are so admired and respected by all who know you. God has a special place for you in Heaven. Love you and miss you❤️ #RIP.\"\n\nJust two weeks before Frank's death, Tarek took to Instagram to beg fans for prayers after a variety of treatments failed to stop his throat cancer from spreading all over his body, and finally to his brain."
