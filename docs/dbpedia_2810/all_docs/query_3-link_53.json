That’s the only reasonable explanation. I don’t know what happened to his writing ability as it’s been an uncomfortable downward spiral of a mess. I still can’t figure out what he was trying to accomplish with All Star Batman & Robin and even worse was his sequel The Dark Knight Strikes Again. Those were so horribly written that when you compare it to the work that made Miller famous on Daredevil and Batman, it makes you wonder if it’s the same person.\n\nMiller will always be a legend because he gave us comics that made the 1980s, but it has been sad to see him become irrelevant in today’s comics, when compared to writer’s today. Cocaine is a of a drug. If you’re reading this, get help Frank.\n\nWe strike hard and fade away into the night\n\nL0ngB0x\n\nGrasshopper\n\nlifetime member\n\nLocation: NJ\n\nPosts: 131\n\nMy Collection\n\nPosted: August 26, 2014 7:34:00 pm\n\nLet's just totally ignore sin city and 300 than lol and batman year one 1987\n\n\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" />\n\n\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" />\n\n\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" /> \" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" />\n\njoe_mccarty\n\nComic Guru\n\nLocation: San Antonio, TX\n\nPosts: 684\n\nMy Collection\n\nPosted: August 27, 2014 9:18:27 am\n\nThat sounds like a great idea.

I remember because it sat on shelves for a long while. At that point, Miller was going downhill and the industry just wasn’t paying much attention. It was not well receieved. Alan Moore and many other writers had criticized his writing style. I’m not saying Miller is a hack, he’s good, but I honestly believe he’s not writing to his fullest potential, or he’s been on the needle.\n\nWe strike hard and fade away into the night\n\nCanuck\n\nI have no life\n\nmoderator\n\nLocation: Alberta, Canada\n\nPosts: 10826\n\nMy Collection\n\nPosted: August 27, 2014 10:07:30 am\n\nHe's still 10 times better than most guys in the industry now IMO.\n\n\"Disliking everything is not the same thing as having an opinion\"\n\nRapha1978\n\nComic Guru\n\nLocation: North Carolina\n\nPosts: 939\n\nMy Collection\n\nPosted: August 27, 2014 11:23:36 am\n\nThe problem is Miller writes as though he just doesn't care anymore. I get the feeling he already knows he's a name and can bring in the big bucks. He doesn't have to spend much time penning words as long as it's just out there. It's like in sports when the all-star player just shows up. He knows he gets paid. He knows he doesn't even have to perform or risk injury as long as he's there. Most of Miller's modern comic books feel rushed and not a lot of thought or concept behind it. I guess fame can do it to you, but I look at writers like Neil Gaiman for instance, who is up there in names and has hit it big outside of comics. He's doing that current Sandman: Overture which is at issue #3 now, and though the book has been consistently late, you can tell Gaiman still cares for the characters.\n\nLast edited August 27, 2014 11:24:43 am\n\nWe strike hard and fade away into the night\n\nmanbat\n\nTeacher\n\nPosts: 386\n\nMy Collection\n\nPosted: August 27, 2014 1:57:13 pm\n\nFrank Miller rocks! Unfortunately, many of the true art geniuses throughout time had issues with substance abuse. And...in many cases, their best work while under the influence isn't appreciated until long after their death.\n\nI'm not saying....I'm just saying..."
