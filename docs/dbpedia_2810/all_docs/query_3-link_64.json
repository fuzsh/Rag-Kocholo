They’re better at that than they are at the more subtle emotions. In that arena, prose fiction is so much better. And cinema is so much better. There’s nothing like a real actor’s face to break your heart or draw you in and so on.”\n\nRead More On CBR\n\nView Image Gallery\n\n8/2/2022\n\nSDCC: Frank Miller Reflects on his Legacy & his Future\n\nWriter and artist Frank Miller is one of the comic medium’s most important creators. Entering the industry at the tail end of the 1970s, Miller’s meteoric rise to fame saw him help reinvent Daredevil into one of Marvel’s most complex heroes. His work on Batman with stories like Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns continue to define the character decades later. But Miller’s creator-owned work is just as influential. Stories like 300, Sin City, Ronin, and Martha Washington have inspired legions of other creators.\n\nRead More On CBR\n\nView Image Gallery\n\n7/26/2022"
