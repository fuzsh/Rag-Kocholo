        "text": "By Theo Finigan\n\nIn using the myth, in manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity, Mr. Joyce is pursuing a method which others must pursue after him. It is, I seriously believe, a step toward making the modern world possible for art … T. S. Eliot. “Ulysses, Order, and Myth”\n\nMyths deal in false universals, to dull the pain of particular circumstances. Angela Carter. The Sadeian Woman: An Exercise in Cultural History\n\nBy the time we reach the final section of Frank Miller’s seminal graphic novel Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, “Russia has taken the lead in the arms race” (4:16): a near-miss strike by the new “Coldbringer” nuclear weapon plunges Gotham City into darkness.1 Planes start falling from the sky and hitting buildings, in an eerie foreshadowing of the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001. Fire breaks out, and the general populace starts looting and creating mayhem. The remaining members of the sociopathic mutant gang escape from jail and spill out onto the streets, convinced the night is theirs. Suddenly, though, they hear hoofbeats, “like in a Western” (4:23): Batman has returned once more in order to save Gotham City from itself, but this time he is on horseback, bereft of his technological accoutrements. With nothing more than his wits, an impromptu posse, and a lasso, the Dark Knight-cum-Western lawman restores a semblance of order to the riven city. Finally, after a climactic face-off with his erstwhile ally Superman, Bruce Wayne apparently forsakes his crime-fighting persona altogether, in order to live the “good life” in his “endless”2 cave-frontier (4:47).\n\nThe myth of the frontier hero, then, is clearly a key facet of Miller’s text, as indeed Alan Moore (who is, like Miller, a noted comics auteur) suggests in his unpaginated introduction to the collected edition of the four-part graphic novel: “The importance of myth and legend as a subtext to Dark Knight [sic] can’t really be overstated.” Moore contends that the “later scenes of The Batman on horseback” evoke “the arrival in town of Clint Eastwood,” and thus demonstrate the text’s essentially “mythical quality.” Taking its cue from Moore’s analysis, this essay considers some of the ways in which Dark Knight engages with this foundational American “monomyth,” which, as John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett argue, is frequently articulated at the level of the cultural unconscious, in popular culture forms like comic books (48).3 Specifically, I suggest that Miller’s noirish Gotham City is a refracted version of the characteristic frontier space, identified by Lawrence and Jewett as the “threatened Eden” (22). Of course, Gotham has never seemed all that edenic. Miller’s version, in particular, is characterized by an atmosphere of “foreboding,” “doom,” and “decay” (Vaz 185). Nonetheless, throughout Dark Knight there is a pervasive sense that something at least approximating a vanished ideal is under threat.4\n\nGotham’s paradise lost is menaced both from without by the forces of a savage, evil “Other,” and from within by the progressive enervation of its own juridical institutions. Drawing on theories of hard-boiled masculinity, I argue that Batman’s heroic return marks an attempt to manage anxieties about the state of gender relations in a city no one seems “man enough” to defend. First suggesting that the visual representation of the body in pain is central to this recrudescence of overt patriarchal control, I then draw connections between a series of images of Batman’s symbolic rebirth or baptism, and Richard Slotkin’s influential analysis of the frontier myth as a narrative of racial conflict and “regeneration through violence.” Although Batman’s enemies in Dark Knight are superficially white, I point to a racial subtext implicit in the representation of the vicious “mutants,” whose speech mimics stereotypical “black” urban slang, and whose status as genetically deviant savages recalls a long tradition in science fiction and fantasy literature, in which the image of the apocalyptic city taken over by alien hordes gives metaphorical expression to certain repressed racial anxieties.\n\nAccording to Moore, the mythic aura Miller lends to Dark Knight represents a response to what he perceives as the “new sophistication” of an increasingly mature comics audience attuned to the “social implications” of the hero genre. But if one of Miller’s goal in rewriting the Batman is the rejuvenation of the tired cliché of the superhero – the “same old muscle-bound oafs spouting the same old muscle-bound platitudes” (Moore) – then this ostensibly modernizing project is, ironically, accomplished through an appeal to an age-old trope, described by Richard Slotkin as “the most important archetype underlying American cultural mythology” (Regeneration 10). Moreover, given its fundamental connection with arguably racist and misogynist ideologies, the mythic inheritance that Dark Knight clearly draws on in its depiction of superheroism is troubling to say the least. My essay concludes by considering whether or not Miller manages to resist the pull exerted by the dead hand of the mythic past through an examination of his satirical depiction of Ronald Reagan as a trigger-happy cowboy president. Finally, I argue that the relation between Dark Knight and the “latent ideological power” (Slotkin, Gunfighter 2) of the frontier myth is a vexed one. Although in many ways a trenchant critique of hackneyed archetypes, Miller’s text arguably ends up, in Slotkin’s terms, merely perpetuating “the myth [it] pretend[s] to analyze” (Regeneration 4).\n\nThe urban setting of the majority of Batman’s adventures is, of course, both temporally and spatially distant from any real historical or geographical frontier. Gotham is, after all, a thinly disguised version of New York, the capital city of modernity (Brooker 48). Indeed, as with the escapades of many comic-book superheroes, Batman’s crusade has always contained elements drawn from the conventions of science fiction. Miller accentuates this fantastic heritage by arming Batman with a plethora of hi-tech gadgets and weapons, and placing the now middle-aged hero in a vaguely futuristic, dystopian setting in which he must confront an army of genetically-modified mutant punks—an alien invasion, of sorts. Yet as Andrew Ross points out, the representation of Gotham as a crime-plagued urban wasteland stalked by an alienated anti-hero also draws heavily on the world of hard-boiled fiction and film noir (31), which is itself a refracted version of the frontier myth.\n\nAccording to Jopi Nyman, the literary tradition of the hard-boiled detective “draws on the adventure stories of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centur[ies] and the western in particular” (16-17). Similarly, as Slotkin points out,\n\nthe hard-boiled detective story began as an abstraction of essential elements of the Frontier Myth. The detective’s adventure follows a formula of heroic action similar to that of [Zane] Grey’s steely-eyed avengers […] Like the West of the nineteenth century, the modern city is a living entity capable of generating events (crime waves, scandals, new rackets) that may require incorporation with, and modifications of, the formulas of literary fiction. (Gunfighter 217)\n\nAs Frederick Jackson Turner noted at the close of the nineteenth century in his famous and influential thesis, the frontier as such never existed as a static entity, but rather comprised a series of “successive frontiers” (42). The replication of the frontier myth in the world of the hard-boiled hero – and, indeed, in Dark Knight – can thus be seen in the context of repeated attempts to form one symbolic frontier after another, in what might be seen as a peculiarly American manifestation of the repetition compulsion, played out within the political, social, and cultural registers.\n\nLike the frontier narrative, then, which “always begins with a threat arising against Eden’s calm” (Lawrence and Jewett 26), Dark Knight opens with Gotham in a state of siege. Our first glimpses of the city convey a sense of an urban wasteland rapidly going to hell. The “big town” (1:6) is in the grips of a deadly heat wave (“ninety-seven … with no relief in sight”), and we see a cityscape that almost seems to be on fire: smoke rises from the clutter of buildings, while an apocalyptic sun, prophetic of the nuclear near-miss later on, pulses malevolently beyond the ruined silhouette of the “magnificent” Twin Towers (1:3). The social temperature is also rising rapidly. A newscaster tells us that “This heat wave has sparked many acts of civil violence,” the most diabolical of them being the “brutal slaying” of three nuns (1:3), followed by the callous stapling of a dead cat “to the door of the First Church of Christ the Redeemer” (1:6).\n\nIt is clear, then, that there is no redemption in store for Gotham. Its champion, the “Dark Knight,” has been retired for a decade, and is now a ghostly presence – a “Flying Dutchman” – in a city that has “given up” (1:4). The text’s ubiquitous media chatter articulates the pervasive culture of fear that has paralyzed the community: “We live in the shadow of crime […] with the unspoken understanding that we are victims: of fear, of violence, of social impotence” (2:10). This anxiety about imminent social collapse creates a millennial atmosphere in the streets, through which shoeless grotesques shamble, carrying placards claiming “WE ARE DAMNED” (1:4).\n\nThe frontier myth characteristically melds the kind of quasi-religious narrative of damnation and redemption evident in the opening of Dark Knight to a critique of impotent political institutions, while, in turn, positing the actions of a strong, self-possessed (invariably male) individual as the solution to the community’s difficulties.5 As a secularized version of “Judeo-Christian dramas of community redemption,” the American “monomyth” depicts a “harmonious paradise” not only threatened by external evil, but compromised by the fact that its public institutions have “fail[ed] to contend with this threat.” *Citation missing The myth of the “zealous crusader” who redeems paradise by vanquishing “evil” is thus inseparable from the depiction of “impotent democratic institutions that can be rescued only by extralegal superheroes” (Lawrence and Jewett 6, 8).\n\nIn Dark Knight this “impotency” is, indeed, coded in explicitly gendered terms. Gotham’s city fathers have become limp and emasculated figures, with the flabby, ineffectual mayor himself being the embodiment of this watered-down masculinity. Rather than taking matters into his own hands like a man, he exhibits a stereotypically “feminine” passivity by delegating responsibility to others, and incessantly pooling opinions while his city crumbles around him. Significantly, during an attempt to negotiate with the bestial (and macho) mutant leader, he is symbolically castrated by having his throat ripped out (2:35). With the social order no longer structured according to an authoritative patriarchy, the city’s “children” – the mainly adolescent mutants – threaten to take over.\n\nWatching from the sidelines, an ageing and nostalgic Commissioner Gordon laments that Gotham has been enervated by the progressive moral decline of its leaders. The tough, inspirational wartime presidency of Roosevelt, who “[took] fear and [turned] it into a fighting spirit,” has given way to a succession of feeble leaders, “each one smaller, weaker … the best of them like faint echoes” (2:40). It is significant that, here, Gordon is talking to his replacement-in-waiting as commissioner of police, Ellen Yindel, a woman. Although on one level, the promotion of a woman to this position functions as a cynical public-relations gambit by the mayor’s office (2:16), it is also clear that, since Gotham City itself has been emasculated by political ineptitude and misguided social liberalism, the only one “man enough” for the job of protecting the city during the mutant crisis is a female cop with a short haircut.\n\nA rejuvenated Batman circumvents the inadequate mechanisms of conventional law enforcement, replacing them with what Lawrence and Jewett would call the “golden violence” of “city-cleansing” vigilantism, which they see as characteristic of subliminally “mythic” films like Death Wish and Dirty Harry (107-08). For instance, after one of Two Face’s henchmen is released from police custody on a technicality, Batman interrogates him on his own terms—here, the “rights” that freed the crook from jail are irrelevant, since he has “a piece of glass shoved into a major artery” and is “bleeding to death.” The next frame shows a TV panel picturing a member of the public professing his support for Batman’s extralegal methods: “Batman? Yeah, I think he’s a-okay. He’s kicking just the right butts—butts the cops ain’t kicking, that’s for sure” (1:37). Batman has no time for the “stupid laws and social cowardice” that have made Gotham helpless (2:9). Where the city’s mayor misguidedly attempts to deal with the mutant threat through appeasement and negotiation (2:32), the Dark Knight is a consummate action hero who uses brutal violence to intimidate and subdue his enemies. During his first night out of retirement, for instance, he electrocutes one of the mutants (1:24), and cripples another “punk,” employing his meticulous knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques (1:31).\n\nFurther, unlike earlier manifestations of the character that eschewed the use of firearms, this Reagan-era Batman is heavily armed, employing, variously, a machine gun (2:8), a tank-like Batmobile (2:18), and a military assault helicopter (3:18). Miller’s protagonist is less a knight than “Rambo in a cape” (Sharrett 38), a vigilante who shoots first and does not even bother asking questions (2:8-9). By the end of the narrative, Batman has become more like Robocop, as he dons a technologically enhanced, cyborg-like suit for his final face-off with Superman (4:36).6 A further cinematic intertext here is the Clint Eastwood of the Dirty Harry films, a series invoked by Miller through his use of language, as in such tough-guy lines as “Do you know who I am, punk?” (2:11). As Nyman points out, such “masculinized language” is a salient feature of hard-boiled narratives, in which its deployment is inextricably tied to the exercise of power: “verbal acts are combined with acts of physical interrogation and violence on the body” (140). By contrast, “If characters are unable to control their language in all situations, including those connected to living through pain, they are not properly masculine in hard-boiled fiction” (Nyman 143). Batman’s clipped dialogue is used here, in concert with the threat of physical violence, to intimidate a captured mutant, whose wail of terror as his predicament is revealed – he is suspended upside-down, from the top of a skyscraper – marks him as the emasculated other, unable to control his language (2:12).\n\nMiller’s bleak view of Gotham as enervated dystopia, and his representation of Batman as its alienated, hyper-macho vigilante, closely correspond to Nyman’s description of the “masculinized vision of individualism,” which he claims is characteristic of that modernized “frontier” myth, the hard-boiled narrative (3).7 Nyman argues that “Hard-boiled fiction can be regarded as a symbolic representation of anxieties over gender which stem from its cultural and historical context,” and that “the genre aims at a reaffirmation of a disrupted masculine social order in various ways which extend from the privileging of a masculine language to a vision of social order based on masculine authority” (3). Batman’s “return,” then, is above all the reassertion of an ideology of hyper-masculinity. His violent crusade against the forces that threaten Gotham is explicitly gendered. Thus, a member of the pro-Batman faction in the media debate surrounding his activities lauds the middle-aged vigilante as a “man [who] has risen to show us that the power is, and always has been, in our hands. We are under siege—he’s showing us that we can resist” (2:10, emphasis mine). If Gotham’s crime wave often resembles a war, then it seems as though Batman is “the only one with the balls enough to fight it” (3:40)."
