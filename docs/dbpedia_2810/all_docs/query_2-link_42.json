        "text": "Over the 61 years of Frank Miller and Son, Chris Miller knew his father’s impact on several Owensboro hunters and community members. Yet, seeing years of friends fill the visitation on Friday evening reminded him of the effect his father had on the community around him.\n\n“We had a stream of people, you know, all afternoon, many old friends, new friends, some guys from back in the 70s. We even counted around 12 people who worked in the store when they were high school kids,” Chris said.\n\nAll of them had one moment in common they told Chris: “He changed my life.”\n\n“They all said you don’t have an idea what kind of impact your dad had on me in my life,” Chris said.\n\nRecounting the visitors’ memories with his father left Chris feeling humble and proud of the legacy he left on the community. Chris noted that when they posted the announcement of Frank’s death, there were over 600 comments sharing condolences and memories of Frank.\n\nSince Chris graduated from college in 1983, he has worked with his father for six days a week for 41 years. He related the experience to working with his best friend, who happened to be his dad.\n\n“It was something we both really love. It’s just been a dream for us,” he said.\n\nOver the years, one of the lessons he said he learned the most from his dad, especially when it came to the store’s operation, was consistently having a good mood even when going through hard days.\n\nChris noted that over the last year, his father’s health started to decline. Yet, Frank wouldn’t let you know he was going through some of his most challenging moments, health-wise.\n\n“That made a big impression on me because that’s what people want to hear. It makes you feel better, and it’s got to make them feel better,” Chris said.\n\nOne of his close friends, State Senator Gary Boswell, shared how he and Frank shared many of their moments together. The two were duck hunters for many years and often hunted together on Boswell’s property in Henderson.\n\nBoswell noted that he didn’t have much of a hunting experience with his father, but with Frank, it filled that void.\n\n“I felt like it was taking my own father hunting. I just got to a point where I really like to take Frank hunting and fishing with me. He was an unbelievable shot, especially for his age,” Boswell said.\n\nThe two would connect in the moments between rounds, and Frank would recount new stories to him from his years of hunting. Some were about his experience hunting in Canada; others were about claiming shots that others may have taken.\n\nStories like this filled the visitation Friday evening, and Chris said it left him and his family thankful for who his father remained to be throughout their lives.\n\n“He just helped so many people catch more fish, get more game, and enjoy the outdoors. That’s what he really liked: to get people outside and enjoy what God has given us. It made him so happy to see people doing that,” Chris said."
