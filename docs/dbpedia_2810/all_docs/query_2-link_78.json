        "text": "Frank Miller didn't want to go back to Hollywood. To hear Miller tell it (he and his Sin City codirector Robert Rodriguez have different versions of the story) after having a rough time as a screenwriter he had pretty much lost all interest in working in films ever again. Luckily for Sin fans, he caved.\n\n\"I had to be dragged kicking and screaming back into movies,\" says Miller, who began the comics series the Sin City flicks are based on back in 1991. \"I had no idea what it was like to actually be a director and make those decisions on the set. But [on] the first day I decided I was in for the whole ride.\"\n\nNow, almost a decade later, he's rolling with Rodriguez again. After co-directing the original Sin City in 2005, the pair are going back to Basin City for A Dame to Kill For, out Friday. Packed with the same black-and-white-with-a-splash-of-color style as its predecessor, the latest taste of Sin brings back a lot of familiar faces—Mickey Rourke as Marv, Jessica Alba as Nancy Callahan, Rosario Dawson as Gail—but also adds the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Eva Green as the eponymous dame, Ava.\n\nWIRED sat down with Miller at Comic-Con International a few weeks ago to pick his brain about giving actors notes, the current state of comic book movies, and why he just can't stay away from Sin City. Here are the bullet points.\n\nSometimes Actors Say Things to Miller Like 'Robert Says You're the Guy to Talk to About Sin City'\n\nOn the first Sin City, Miller felt—in his words—kind of useless. \"It was staged exactly the way I drew it,\" he says, \"so there was nothing to do there.\" But he did find he was good at one thing: Giving actors notes on their characters. \"Marley Shelton came over with those big beautiful eyes of hers and said, 'Robert says you're the guy to talk to about Sin City,'\" Miller says of his encounter with the woman who played The Customer in the opening scene of the film. \"And she said, 'Why did I hire somebody to kill myself?' I got to do what every author dreams of doing: I got to tell her her entire backstory.'\"\n\nImprovements in CGI Mean A Dame to Kill For Has Even More Style Than Sin City\n\nThe thing that has set the Sin City films apart from almost every other comic book movie in recent years is how much they look like actual comics come to life. The color palette, the angles, even the way people talk to each other is a faithful re-staging of Miller's panels in the books. A lot of that is thanks to the greenscreen technical feats Rodriguez could pull off—feats that have only become better/easier/faster in the years since the last movie. \"People have accused me of realism in the past. Not guilty as charged. My stuff is very stylized,\" Miller says. \"Robert was able to show me how real actors could perform within the universe that I drew and then to amplify that further. Technology has improved [that] dramatically over the last 10 years.\"\n\nMiller Crafted Gail to Play to Rosario Dawson's Strengths\n\nIn A Dame to Kill For, Rosario Dawson is back as Old Town badass Gail. Also back is her very complex relationship with Dwight (previously played by Clive Owen, now played by Josh Brolin). Gail is hardcore to say the least (in the 2005 film, you may remember, she ripped open a girl's throat with her teeth) but Dwight's her weakness—and there's one uncharacteristic line that Miller trusted her to pull off in a way he maybe wouldn't have with another actress. \"I was able to give Rosario a very sweet line in the middle of her usual tough-gal routine about how much she loved Dwight because I knew Rosario could pull it off—she could soften her voice just enough and open her big eyes and break your heart and then go right back to being the tough bitch she was before,\" says Miller. \"She says, 'I know he doesn't feel the same way about me, but he's the only man I'll ever love.'\"\n\nMiller Didn't Want Dame to Be 3-D ... Until He Saw What Rodriguez Could Do\n\nFrank Miller is no fan of 3-D films. Robert Rodrigue, though, is (remember Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over?). So when Rodriguez came to Miller with the idea that their next Sin City movie should be stereoscopic, the comics creator \"balked.\" Then Rodriguez demonstrated his wares. \"He showed me how with the technology he had how he would treat his representation of my artwork and it blew my mind. I started drawing in 3-D,\" Miller says. \"There were a lot of storyboards in making the movie and I started drawing things like when Nancy Callahan is reaching for a gun, crawling across the floor, I made the gun about 15 feet long because I knew he could pull it off.\"\n\nDespite the Stylistic Differences, Miller Likes the Big, Colorful Comic Book Movies Too\n\nConsidering that the latest crop of superhero movies look like kids' stuff compared to the darkness of Sin City (and the fact that the first film came three years before Iron Man), one might expect Miller to scoff at the current dominance of the Marvel movie machine. He doesn't. \"Of the superhero movies I've seen,\" he says, \"I've particularly liked the ones that stick closest to the source material. So I like their innocence. These are comics that were published in the early '60s. For Captain America to say a wonderful line like, 'There's only one God ma'am, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that' and to bring back that wealth that earlier generations had, I think is great. Sin City is what it is: It's a fully-liberated cartoonist out to do the kind of story he always wanted to do, the kind of story he always wanted to do, so it's bound to be grittier and tougher than the Incredible Hulk.\""
