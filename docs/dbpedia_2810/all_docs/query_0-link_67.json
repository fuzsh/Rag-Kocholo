        "text": "Location: 3649 Mission Inn Avenue, Riverside, CA 92501\n\nHistorical Facts:\n\n“The Mission Inn began in 1875 as the home of Capt. C.C. Miller and his family. The home was situated in the middle of a two-and-one half acre city block he had received in payment for engineering work performed for the developers of the new community”\n\n“In 1876 the family began taking in boarders at their 12-bedroom adobe.”\n\n“In 1878 the family built a wooden hotel addition called ‘The Glenwood’. At the time the hotel operated under the name of Miller & Newman, the latter being the captain’s civil engineering partner and son-in-law.”\n\n“In 1880 the entire property, including the hotel, was sold to 22-year old Frank Augustus Miller, the captain’s son.” At the time Frank Miller had already started to make a name for himself as a local business man.\n\nFrank Miller added his first addition was in 1882. He added a “barracks-like wooden structure extending from the adobe westward to Main Street”.\n\n“After several years of effort” he was able to secure financing from Henry E. Huntington for a modern addition to the hotel. This addition “opened in early 1903”. The wooden parts of the hotel were moved and eventually destroyed.\n\nFrank Miller became a “devotee of the Mission Revival Movement”. “The architect of the new building was Arthur Benton, a major participant in the movement.”\n\n“At first the renewed hotel had the name of Glenwood Mission Inn”. However, “after a few years it became known, more simply as the Mission Inn”.\n\nThe hotel had various additions over the years which include:\n\n1910: Cloister Wing (Major Addition)\n\n1913-1915: Spanish Wing; Designer: Myron Hunt (Architect).\n\n1930: International Rotunda Wing\n\n“Miller and his family traveled extensively, bringing back art and architectural decorative materials from Europe, Asia and Mexico–all to become features of his hotel.”\n\n“The inn [eventually] became a ‘watering spot’ for the rich and famous internationally.’\n\n“The Inn grew and prospered until the 1930-1931 season, when the country was suffering from the Great Depression.”\n\n“[Frank] Miller died in 1935. His daughter and son-in-law, Allis and Dewitt Hutchings, managed it until they too died in the early 1950s. Their children sold the Inn in 1956 to a San Francisco hotelier, Ben Swig. Under his and several later private and public ownerships, it continued to deteriorate.”\n\n“After keeping the hotel afloat for nearly nine years, the city sold the hotel to a Wisconsin- based private development firm, which closed the Inn in June 1985 to begin what would become a seven-year $50 million renovation project. With restorations nearly complete in December 1988, the hotel was once again plagued by bankruptcy and languished for three years without a buyer. In late 1992, local Riverside entrepreneur Duane Roberts purchased the Mission Inn and successfully reopened the landmark hotel for business. ”\n\nImportant Dates:\n\n1875: The Mission Inn history’s began, originally a home.\n\n1876: The Miller family began taking boarders.\n\n1878: Wooden hotel addition, called “The Glenwood”.\n\n1880: Property sold to 22-year old Frank Augustus Miller.\n\n1882: Frank makes his first addition to the hotel.\n\n1910: Cloister Wing (Major Addition) is added.\n\n1913-1915: Spanish Wing added.\n\n1930: International Rotunda Wing added.\n\n1935: Frank Miller Died.\n\n1950s (early): Allis and Dewitt Hutchings (Frank’ daughter and son-in-law) die.\n\n1956: Frank Miller’s grandchildren sell the hotel to Ben Swig (San Francisco hotelier).\n\n1985: Mission Inn closed for renovation.\n\n1988: Mission Inn plagued with bankruptcy.\n\n1992: Duane Roberts purchased and reopened the newly renovated Mission Inn Hotel and Spa.\n\nImportant Figures:\n\nCapt. C. C. Miller: Frank Miller’s father, the first owner of the location that would become the Mission Inn.\n\nFrank August Miller: Owner of the Mission Inn.\n\nHenry E. Huntington: New Addition Financier.\n\nArthur Benton: Architect for new addition circa 1910.\n\nAllis and Dewitt Hutchings: Frank Miller’s daughter and son-in-law.\n\nDuane Roberts: Current owner of the Mission Inn Hotel and Spa.\n\nReference Materials:\n\nJennings, B., Baker, R.
