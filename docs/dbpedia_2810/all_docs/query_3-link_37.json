The special edition is limited to 50 copies and retails for $275.\n\nAbout Frank Miller\n\nFrank Miller began his career in comics in the late 1970s, first drawing then writing Daredevil for Marvel Comics, creating what was essentially a crime comic disguised as a superhero book. It was on Daredevil that Miller gained notoriety, honed his storytelling abilities, and took his first steps toward becoming a giant in the comics medium. Next came Ronin, a science-fiction samurai drama that seamlessly melded Japanese and French comics traditions into the American mainstream; and then the groundbreaking and acclaimed Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One, both of which not only redefined the classic character, but also revitalized the industry itself. Finally able to fulfill his dream of doing an all-out, straight-ahead crime series, Miller introduced Sin City in 1991. Readers responded enthusiastically to Miller’s tough-as-leather noir drama, creating an instant sales success. His multi-award-winning 300 series from Dark Horse, a telling of history’s most glorious and underreported battle, was brought to full-blooded life in 1998. In 2001, Miller returned to the superhero genre with the best-selling Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again. Frank Miller continues to push the medium into new territories, exploring subject matter previously untouched in comics, and his work consistently receives the highest praise from his industry peers and readers everywhere. In 2005, with the hugely successful Sin City movie release, co-directed with Robert Rodriguez, Miller added a director’s credit to his already impressive resumé and introduced his characters to an entirely new legion of fans worldwide.\n\nAbout Kitchen Sink Books\n\nFounded in 2013 by pioneering alternative publisher Denis Kitchen (of Kitchen Sink Press) and award-winning designer/editor John Lind, Kitchen Sink Books is an exclusive imprint of Dark Horse Comics focusing on archival collections, art books, and large format editions. Their debut title The Best of Comix Book: When Marvel Went Underground won the 2014 Harvey Awards for Best Domestic Reprint and Excellence in Presentation. Also in 2014, Harvey Kurtzman’s Jungle Book became the first release in Kitchen Sink Books’ ambitious Harvey Award–nominated Essential Kurtzman series, which aims to collect the most acclaimed work of this master cartoonist and satirist. Frank Miller's Sin City: The Hard Goodbye Curator's Collection is the first project in Kitchen Sink’s Curator’s Collection series featuring original art reproduced at size, alongside preliminary work, essays, and creator interviews."
