Over 300 members of the Chorus â€“ known as the Fifth Section - have been lost to us over the years, many as a result of HIV/AIDS. Their names are memorialized in our concert programs and in the list below. Their spirit lives on with us and we honor their memory.\n\nIf you know of anyone whose name has inadvertently been omitted from this list, please kindly let us know by calling the SFGMC office at (415) 865-3650 or [email protected], so that we may add them to our Fifth Section and continue to celebrate and honor the contributions of all our members."
