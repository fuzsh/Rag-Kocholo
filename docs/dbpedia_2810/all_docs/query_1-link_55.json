        "text": "Our Story: An Appropriate Response\n\nThe Early Days\n\nThe San Francisco Zen Center provided the volunteer program a very small room with a desk, a phone, and two chairs on the second floor of the City Center building on Page Street. Martha deBarros recalls, “That’s all we had; we had no money. So we decided to raise some more money for Frank’s salary…and we decided to keep it a volunteer program.”\n\nThe initial volunteer caregiver training was held at Green Gulch in January of 1988 and attracted a group of 18 people, mostly Green Gulch residents and practitioners. For the first year, the volunteers supported a program at San Francisco General Hospital in coordination with social worker and Outpatient Coordinator Eileen Lemus. She referred volunteers to patients living with cancer, no social support, and often mental health and addiction issues. Volunteers provided whatever was needed, whether it was food, supplies, or simple companionship. These patients were people truly on the margins of society, existing from month to month on Social Security checks. It was just enough money to stay in a residential hotel for a week or two after which they would live on the streets until the next check. The Zen Center volunteers would visit them, often tracking individuals from the clinics at San Francisco General to hotels and onto the street.\n\nBecoming Zen Hospice Project\n\nIn the fall of 1988, a board of directors was created, and they decided to split off from the SF Zen Center and become a separate non-profit, adopting the name Zen Hospice Project. Later that same year, because of their connection with Eileen Lemus and SFGH, Laguna Honda Hospital — San Francisco’s long term care county hospital — contacted ZHP and asked them to provide volunteers for their C2 ward hospice unit. This began a unique public/private partnership that continues to this day.\n\nThe Guest House\n\nZen Hospice Project continued to use the Guest House as a residential hospice house to serve the dying until June of 2018. Earlier that year, the UCSF agreement ended, and faced with rising operating costs and a lack of a sustainable funding stream in a changing healthcare environment or new referrals partner, the Guest House closed. Zen Hospice Project had sought a new referrals-and-reimbursement partner, and though we made progress with a major payor/provider, the arrangement could not be finalized in time to save the Guest House. In October 2018, the Guest House was sold to pay off loans the organization incurred to keep operations going without a viable partner. The sale of the Guest House provided an endowment for the organization to carry on its good work into the future.\n\nThe loss of the Guest House was painful for all the dedicated staff and volunteers who poured their hearts into creating and sustaining such a unique and loving environment. The house provided a place for the deepest expression of our humanness. And yet, it was just a building, a container for the work of serving those at the end of life. It was the caregiving expressed through the service and actions of the people who worked there, that made the Guest House unique. Such work is no less powerful in the institutional setting of Laguna Honda Hospital.\n\nLaguna Honda Hospital\n\nThroughout the many changes and challenges that we have faced over the years, Zen Hospice Project has been able to rely on the volunteer program at Laguna Honda Hospital as an expression of its model of care.\n\nMindful Caregiver Education\n\nSince its inception, Zen Hospice Project has offered various educational programs for the public. In 2004, ZHP created the Education Institute under the leadership of Frank Ostaseski and was later spun off to create the Metta Institute. In 2015, Mindful Caregiver Education was created to formalize a curriculum rooted in mindfulness and compassion, for formal and informal caregivers.\n\nIn 2017, a generous grant was provided by the Stupski Foundation to research the needs of family caregivers and to refine the existing curriculum for the particular needs of this group. The two-year grant enabled Zen Hospice Project to create the Mindful Family Caregiving course curriculum and to establish partnerships with local health systems for delivery of this educational intervention. In the summer of 2019, Zen Hospice Project piloted its online Mindful Family Caregiving course to expand its reach to caregivers outside the bay area.\n\nInternational Attention\n\nEvolving to Zen Caregiving Project\n\nFollowing the closure of our Guest House end-of-life care facility, we are focussing greater emphasis upon caregivers who support those living with chronic and terminal illnesses. Much of our work is to encourage caregivers to learn emotional skills early in their caregiving journey to support well-being and provide higher quality care. In light of our expanded focus, we believe that “hospice” in our name no longer conveys the scope of services we offer.\n\nOur mindful and compassionate approach to palliative care will always remain a core part of what we offer; however, we feel a responsibility for finding new ways of reaching more caregivers. We were careful to develop an informed process to find a public-facing name that reflected all of what we do while staying true to our history. While our name will legally remain Zen Hospice Project, our public-facing “brand” is now Zen Caregiving Project. What has not changed is our commitment to sharing what we have learned over the years for the benefit of people everywhere."
