        "text": "This paper presents the flower morphology, pollination mechanisms and seed germination of three indigenous medicinal plants of Bangladesh namely, Asclepias curassavica L., Clerodendrum viscosum Vent. and Scoparia dulcis L. The minimum days taken for seed germination in Asclepias curassavica, Clerodendrum viscosum and Scoparia dulcis are 6, 14 and 9, respectively. Epigeal type of seed germination has been noted in Asclepias curassavica and Scoparia dulcis, whereas hypogeal type of seed germination has been found in Clerodendrum viscosum. Fruit production is highest in Scoparia dulcis among the species studied and a maximum of 304 seeds are produced per fruit in it. Maximum 108 seeds are produced per fruit in Asclepias curassavica. Among the species investigated Asclepias curassavica and Clerodendrum viscosum are cross-pollinated, and Scoparia dulcis is self-pollinated. Butterflies, bees and ants are noted to be the pollinators in Asclepias curassavica and in Clerodendrum viscosum bla...\n\nPhenology is an important tool used for the knowledge and study of native species, being necessary that they are conducted in a uniform way and evaluated the same characteristics, both quantitative and qualitative. In this sense, this work aimed to gather the main studies, proposing a union in the methodology for this type of study. For effective work, five to ten individuals should be sampled by species, checking the presence or absence of phenophases, visually quantifying the percentage of canopy coverage and classifying them as to their occurrence and regularity and finally checking the synchronization of events in species within the community. To carry out phenological studies, five to ten individuals must be sampled, and the presence or absence of phenophases, defoliation, sprouting, leaf expansion and maintenance of foliage in the canopy, flower buds emission, flowering in progress, end of flowering, forming fruits, ripe fruits and falling fruits / dispersing seeds, visually q...\n\nChlorophytum borivilianum (Liliaceae) commonly called as Safed musli belongs to the genus Chlorophytum Ker Gawl. is one of the potent sources of aphrodisiac medicine in Ayurvedic and Allopathic systems. Widespread shrinking of natural resources (forest) directed to the cultivation of Chlorophytum borivilianum, an ayurvedic crude drug, and has needed the genetic improvement program of the aforesaid crop. Genetic variance among 9 genotypes was characterized for ten quantitative and four qualitative traits. The results recorded from the quantitative data revealed that under similar conditions provided, the best character performance was observed in the genotype 9 (Ambikapur C.G.) The result obtained for the qualitative data revealed that, variation from light green leaf colour to dark green colour during the entire growth period. White colored flowers were observed among all the genotypes. Only Parallel wavy leaf margin was observed among all the collected genotypes. On the basis of colour, tubers were grouped into light brown and white. Plant morphology needs to be determined to identify the morphological markers that not only facilitate large scale screening of germplasm lines, but also helpful in identifying the particular genotype."
