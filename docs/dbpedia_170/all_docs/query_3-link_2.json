        "text": "TEHRAN – New legal boundaries have been defined for five historical properties, which are scattered across Yazd province.\n\nThe Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Handicrafts has announced the exact legal boundaries of the properties in separate letters to the governor-general of the central province, IRIB reported on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to protecting historical sites, the demarcation projects are aimed to prevent further destruction and damage.\n\nEsfahanian Garden House, Eqbal Factory, Vazir Castle, Ezzatabad Castle, and Ezzatabad Kushk (small garden pavilion) are those demarcated recently.\n\nIn July 2017, the historical structure of the city of Yazd was named a UNESCO World Heritage. Wedged between the northern Dasht-e Kavir and the southern Dasht-e Lut on a flat plain, the oasis city enjoys a very harmonious public-religious architecture that dates from different eras.\n\nYazd is usually referred to as a delightful place to stay, or a “don't miss” destination by almost all of its visitors. The city is full of mudbrick houses that are equipped with innovative badgirs (wind catchers), atmospheric alleyways, and many Islamic and Iranian monuments that shape its eye-catching city landscape.\n\nIt is a living testimony to the intelligent use of limited available resources in the desert for survival. Water is brought to the city by the qanat system. Each district of the city is built on a qanat and has a communal center.\n\nThe use of earth in buildings includes walls and roofs by the construction of vaults and domes. Houses are built with courtyards below ground level, serving underground areas. Wind-catchers, courtyards, and thick earthen walls create a pleasant microclimate.\n\nPartially covered alleyways together with streets, public squares and courtyards contribute to a pleasant urban quality. The city escaped the modernization trends that destroyed many traditional earthen cities.\n\nABU/AFM"
