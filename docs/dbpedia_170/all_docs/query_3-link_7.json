        "text": "The perceptions and attitudes of residents in tourist destinations have been a relevant object of research almost since the beginning of academic interest in tourism. This paper analyses the implications of the temporary suspension of tourism activity (as a consequence of pandemic control strategies) on the attitudes and perceptions about tourism of residents in a mature, mass tourism destination with very low seasonality. A quantitative methodological approach is proposed, based on a survey of 749 residents in Tenerife. It is argued that the experience of an environment without tourists for the first time in decades has facilitated processes of re‑symbolisation of the qualities of the surrounding tourism system, facilitating significant modifications. Likewise, in accordance with the literature, the influence of variables related to the involvement in the tourist system and its valuation by residents, especially the receipt of economic income from this activity, has been detected. Given the high economic dependence on tourism on the island, it was expected that the halt in tourism would lead to a greater recognition of its importance and value. However, the results showed that the opposite was true.\n\nThe objective of this study is to analyse impact of international investment, and trade of goods/services to Indonesia tourism sector, which used a Gravity model and Panel Least Square method where the cross-section data period 1990 - 2012 from 6 samples of countries are used. Gravity model analysed tourism trade flows from 6 samples data of countries to/from Indonesia include determinant factors which affect trade flows. The analysis estimation showed that total government spending, and total investment supply in Indonesian tourism has obtained least influenced to the supply of Indonesia tourism due to lack of leakage in sector especially in export commodities. This phenomenon shows that most of developing countries have some of transfer payment including Indonesia trade, where it exposed to crucial balance of payment and foreign trade deficits. At this point, tourism has a favourable effect in closing the gap in foreign trade and the balance of payments.\n\nPurpose The purpose of this study is to understand the residents’ perception towards environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts of tourism development in Kashmir. Design/methodology/approach The research instrument containing 27 items pertaining to six variables is adopted from the literature. A mix-method survey approach is used to solicit residents’ perceptions regarding environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts of the current level of tourism development. A total of 326 useful responses were subjected to descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc analysis using SPSS (Version 22.0). Findings In general, the negative and positive impacts of tourism development are well perceived by the residents. The results indicate that the residents display positive perception regarding economic impacts, however, social and environmental impacts are negatively perceived. Furthermore, barring level of education, the study found no significant difference in the residents’ perception towards tourism impacts (environmental, social, cultural, economic, quality of life and cost of living). Research limitations/implications The paper identifies perceived impacts and issues of tourism development thereby, proposing possible mitigating measures. Also, the study identifies the need to develop a comprehensive policy framework addressing the issues related to the resident’s negative feelings towards tourism impacts. Further, the study envisages the need for engaging residents in developing a progressive and participatory planning process for future tourism activities in the area. Social implications The study offers critical social implications for city tourism development. It suggests a community-based approach should be adopted to sensitize residents about the positive benefits of tourism. Originality/value The study is a novel attempt concerning residents’ residents perceptual differences towards tourism impacts. Furthermore, this study investigated socio-cultural impacts of tourism under two separate categories for better understanding. in doing so, this study provides finer understanding of perception of residents towards tourism impacts in Indian context. The findings of the study will prove critical for different stakeholders in developing future tourism framework and policies in the region."
