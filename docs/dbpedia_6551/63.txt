Melanie Sirof, a Mepham High School teacher, was recently named the grand prize winner in the Teacher Division of the 13th Annual School Essay Contest, sponsored by the Long Island Presidents’ Council of New York State United Teachers.

This year is the first time that the contest was open to teachers.

Sirof competed against other Long Island educators to create the best essay, which was titled "How School Makes Me Feel Good To Be Me.”

As the winner of the contest, Sirof’s essay will be aired, in her own voice, on eleven radio stations at the start of the school year in September.

Her essay will air on WALK FM, WBAB FM, WBLI FM, WBZO FM, WHFM FM, WHLI AM, WJVC FM, WKJY FM, WLNG FM, WWSK FM and WTHE AM.

For more than 10 years, the Long Island Presidents’ Council of New York State United Teachers has sponsored the contest for Long Island students in kindergarten through grade 12, from districts throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties. One winner each is chosen from elementary, middle school and high school entrants.
