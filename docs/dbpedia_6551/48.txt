History

103.1 FM first signed on the air in February 1993 as WBSI, broadcasting from studios located on Sunrise Highway in Bay Shore and playing oldies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[2] The WBSI calls were dropped only a few months after the station signed on because WBLI complained the WBSI calls were too similar and would taint the Arbitrons.

WBZO â along with WHLI, WKJY, and WWSK â was sold by Barnstable Broadcasting to Connoisseur Media effective July 3, 2012 for $23 million. Since then, Connoisseur has made extensive investments in research and marketing to better serve the local Long Island community and the loyal listeners of B103, including purchasing WALK-FM.
