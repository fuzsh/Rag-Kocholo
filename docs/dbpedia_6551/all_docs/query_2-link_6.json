        "text": "No stranger to making noise in downtown Huntington, the people behind The Paramount announced on Friday they will be adding another weapon to their musical arsenal: a radio studio.\n\n“We want to show the artists how valuable [the] Long Island market is to their business and to provide them with every media opportunity available to showcase their talents,” The Paramount’s directors said in a press release.\n\nThrough a partnership with Connoisseur Media Long Island, operators of six Long Island radio stations, The Paramount is set to begin building its “state-of-the-art” studio at its 370 New York Ave. location in Huntington village.\n\n“There’s not a better town or venue to do this in,” Jim Condron, senior vice president of regional strategy and Long Island market manager for Connoisseur Media, said Monday. “We’ve always viewed radio as a conversation between friends and that’s how we program. We want to take every opportunity to introduce our listeners to our friends – our friends being the artists [of The Paramount].”\n\n“The unique setting of this new studio will allow passersby on New York Avenue the chance to watch their favorite radio stations broadcast live, while interviewing the stars of the show on the night of a concert, through massive windows right at street level,” the press release reads.\n\nThe studio, which is expected to be finished by this May, will be used to promote musicians’ concert tours, new releases and more Connoisseur Media’s 1.6 million Long Island listeners. Depending on the style of music the artist in question caters to, Condron said, Connoisseur Media will then send the broadcast out to its five stations: WWSK FM, WALK FM, WKJY FM, WBZO FM and WHLI AM.\n\n“The studio project brings us back to basics and reminds us how cool radio can be,” Jeff Warshaw, CEO of Connoisseur Media, said in a press release. “Not only with our ability to be local, and hyper-local in this sense, but also how we can relate and reflect the lifestyles and interests of our listeners through the music and artists we play.”\n\nWarshaw said The Paramount’s studio will be able to connect the dots between musicians and their audiences to offer a “killer experience” for fans and artists alike.\n\n“This new feature of our venue sets us apart from any other club in the world, and will provide access to a [public relations] vehicle that is unmatched by what any other theater can offer its stars,” The Paramount directors said."
