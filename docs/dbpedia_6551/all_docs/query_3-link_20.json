        "text": "NYSBA celebrates local broadcasters’ commitment to serving their communities by presenting stations with a “Serving New York Award.” We also honor the public service groups that work with local stations to improve the quality of life in communities throughout the Empire State. We recognize commercial, non-commercial, and college stations for their efforts.\n\n​\n\n​We encourage all stations to submit a “public service” campaign or project for consideration.\n\nThe campaign may be on-air or an off-air project\n\nIt may be a live event, digital or traditional broadcast campaign\n\nEvents or broadcast must have occurred between September 1, 2023, and September 4, 2024\n\nStations may submit a single campaign for an entire station cluster. They may also submit a different campaign for each station in the cluster, but no more than one campaign per station.\n\nStations are encouraged to invite a public interest group with whom they worked during the past year. Attending representatives of your invited public interest group will also be presented with an award.\n\nAll stations submitting a public service campaign will be recognized at our regional lunches. Stations and members from the public service organizations will receive the now famous NYSBA Crystal Bowl.\n\n​\n\nSelect the location where you would like to receive the \"Serving New York Award.\" You will then be directed to a separate page and asked to complete a “Serving New York” submission form. ​"
