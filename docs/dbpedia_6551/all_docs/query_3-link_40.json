        "text": "• Following an intensive intergalactic search, Sarkes Tarzian, Inc. has secured the services of veteran programmer Lenny Diana as the new PD/MD of heritage Triple A WTTS/Indianapolis, effective October 18. He succeeds Laura Duncan, who was recently named Brand Manager of Audacy Triple A WXRT/Chicago. Diana will also assume programming oversight for Alternative sister WGBJ/Ft. Wayne, IN, effective in December.\n\nDiana joins WTTS following a successful eight-year run as Operations Manager of Saga Classic Rock WAQY & Active Rock WLZX (Lazer 99.3)/Springfield, MA. The new gig also marks a triumphant return to Indianapolis for Diana, who notably programmed iHeartMedia’s WRZX (now WOLT) from 2004 until 2012. A 25-year media veteran, Diana previously programmed WEDG (The Edge)/Buffalo, WXDX/Pittsburgh and WWSK (94-3 The Shark)/Nassau-Suffolk.\n\nWTTS President/GM (and former PD) Brad Holtz said, “During his eight years in Indianapolis, I got to know Lenny as a programming competitor. I always respected his strategic style and keen ear for quality radio. Lenny loves the market and all that WTTS stands for. He will be an excellent programming leader to carry forth our proud tradition of local, independent radio.”\n\nNo less enthused about this whole situation is Mr. Diana, who remarked, “I’m thrilled to be joining WTTS, a station that for years I’ve admired from afar. To be able to come back to Indianapolis and work with Brad Holtz and the impressive team that is assembled here is very exciting. I look forward to the impact we’ll be making together in the Circle City for years to come.”"
