        "text": "“Smile!” An unnecessary prompt for Lily Labella – because Lilly always smiles! And she likes to talk, talk, talk, she says, so be warned!\n\nThis charming, disarming young lady, now beginning 6th grade in Weber Middle School in PortWashington, was the grand prize winner of a prestigious essay contest last spring (as a 5th grader at South Salem Elementary School) in the Intermediate Grades Division of the 14th annual school essay contest, sponsored by the Long Island Presidents’ Council of New York State United Teachers.\n\nThis prestigious essay contest is open each year to Long Island students, kindergarten through grade 12, from districts throughout Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Thousands of students enter. One Grand Prize Winner in each division is chosen annually from the Primary Grades , Intermediate Grades, Middle School, and High School entrants. All entrants compete with their peers to create the best essay in their division. The title of this year’s essay was “My Teacher Made This Fun!”\n\nIn her winning essay, Lily told of a third grade teacher who was her “tour guide” in world travel. “It was AWESOME!” she wrote, “My class made paper-mache globes and we got glue all over our hands! But the fun did not end there. After we finished our globe project, our journey began! We went to Canada, Mexico, and flew down to South America. We tasted blue corn and learned some Spanish! Next we traveled to Asia and made Japanese kites! My favorite place was Antarctica where we made a diary of surviving in the cold. We ended in Europe where each child picked a country to present to the class.”\n\nLilly likes to write, and she likes to read . She writes all the time and would like to be an author someday. She also enjoys ice skating, and is especially fond of her dog Henry, a Havanese; she had been asking for a dog for a long time. She and Henry live happily with her younger sister Daisy, and their parents, Nancy and Joe.\n\nAs the winner in the Intermediate Division of the 14th annual School Essay Contest of the Long Island Presidents’ Council of New York State United Teachers, Lily’s winning essay will be aired, in her own voice, on eleven radio stations in September. She recorded her essay at the studios of WBAB FM under the supervision of Ray Adell Media Enterprises, aided by Tony Spina of WBAB. Her message will air on WALK FM, WBAB FM, WBLI FM, WBZO FM, WHFM FM, WHLI AM, WJVC FM, WKJY FM, WLNG FM, WWSK FM and WTHE AM."
