        "text": "Radio station in New York, United States\n\nWWWF-FM (103.1 FM) is a country music radio station owned by Connoisseur Media and licensed to Bay Shore, New York. The station's studios are located at Airport Plaza in Farmingdale, New York, and its transmitter is located on Freeman Avenue in Islip, New York.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n103.1 FM first signed on the air in February 1993 as WBSI \"B-103\", broadcasting from studios located on Sunrise Highway in Bay Shore and playing oldies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[4] The WBSI call sign was dropped only a few months after the station signed on because 106.1 WBLI complained the WBSI call sign was too similar and would cause confusion in the Arbitron ratings.\n\nWBZO – along with WHLI, WKJY, and WWSK — was sold by Barnstable Broadcasting to Connoisseur Media effective July 3, 2012, for $23 million.[5]\n\nOn April 7, 2014, WBZO relaunched its classic hits format, shifting from a 60-70s pop-based music mix to a 70s-80s rock-based music mix.[6] A year later, on May 15, 2015, WBZO rebranded as \"103.1 Max FM\".[7]\n\nIn September 2022, the on-air staff was let go due to budget cuts; WBZO would run automated for the rest of the format's run.[8]\n\nOn March 19, 2024, Connoisseur Media announced that the station would flip to country music as \"103.1 The Wolf\" at 10:31 a.m. the following day. The change took place at the time promised; following a block of departure-themed songs to end the \"Max\" format (\"The Final Countdown\" by Europe, \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\" by Billy Joel, \"That's All\" by Genesis and \"New Kid in Town\" by The Eagles), the station launched the \"Wolf\" format with \"How Country Feels\" by Randy Houser.\n\nWith the flip, Connoisseur Media applied for a call sign change to WWWF-FM, and the station would officially adopt the call sign on the 26th. The move returns the country format to a majority of the western Long Island area; while the eastern portion is served by WJVC, it has signal problems in most of Western Suffolk County. In addition, the format had been missing from that region since the flip of New York station WNSH (which was able to be picked up in the area) in October 2021.[9][10]\n\nPrevious logo\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
