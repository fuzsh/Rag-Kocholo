        "text": "History\n\n103.1 FM first signed on the air in February 1993 as WBSI, broadcasting from studios located on Sunrise Highway in Bay Shore and playing oldies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[2] The WBSI calls were dropped only a few months after the station signed on because WBLI complained the WBSI calls were too similar and would taint the Arbitrons.\n\nWBZO â along with WHLI, WKJY, and WWSK â was sold by Barnstable Broadcasting to Connoisseur Media effective July 3, 2012 for $23 million. Since then, Connoisseur has made extensive investments in research and marketing to better serve the local Long Island community and the loyal listeners of B103, including purchasing WALK-FM."
