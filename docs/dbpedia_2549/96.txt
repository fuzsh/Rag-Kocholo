Summary

Distinguished Yale historian Henry Ashby Turner Jr. makes an important and influential addition to his lifelong study of Nazi Germany. Hitler’s Thirty Days to Power paints vivid portraits of the main players in the drama of January 1933 and, using newly available documents, masterfully re-creates the bewildering circumstances surrounding Hitler’s unexpected appointment as chancellor of Germany. The result is a work that Booklist calls “first rate…a gripping, foreboding narrative.”
