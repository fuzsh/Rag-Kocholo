        "text": "April 20, 1889\n\nAdolf Hitler (1889–1945) is born in the Upper Austrian border town of Braunau am Inn, the son of tax collector Alois Hitler. Contrary to popular belief, he had no Jewish ancestors.\n\n1908\n\nHitler moves to Vienna. His impoverishment and residence in homeless shelters began the following year after he had squandered a generous inheritance. Hitler lives in Vienna until May 1913.\n\n1913\n\nHitler moves to Munich, Germany, in May, and in the following year he enlists in the German army to fight in World War I.\n\n1918\n\nHitler is partially blinded in a mustard gas attack near Ypres in Belgium. News of the November 11, 1918, armistice reaches him as he is convalescing in a military hospital. World War I has a profound impact on Hitler and many other Germans. The impact of the conflict and its divisive peace has repercussions for decades to come, giving rise to a second world war and genocide committed under its cover.\n\nSeptember 12, 1919\n\nHitler attends an early meeting of the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei-DAP), which will later become the Nazi Party under his leadership.\n\nNovember 8–9, 1923\n\nAdolf Hitler and the Nazi Party lead a coalition group in an attempt to overthrow the government of Bavaria and initiate a “national revolution.” This so-called Beer Hall Putsch fails. Hitler and others are arrested for treason.\n\n1923–25\n\nHitler is convicted of high treason and sentenced to five years imprisonment, although he serves only one year. While in prison, he writes Mein Kampf (My Struggle). This infamous memoir proves significant in promoting key components of Nazism and its racial ideology. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it would sell one million copies in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.\n\n1925\n\nHitler establishes the SS (Schutzstaffel; Protection Squadrons). During the Nazi regime, the SS will become responsible not only for the German police force and the concentration camp system, but also for security, identification of ethnicity, settlement and population policy, and intelligence.\n\nApril 10, 1932\n\nHitler loses a run-off election for the German presidency to the elderly incumbent, General Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nJanuary 1933\n\nThe Nazi Party comes to power with the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor.\n\nMarch 23, 1933\n\nFollowing the burning of the German parliament building, the Reichstag, by unknown arsonists, the German parliament passes the Law for Rectification of the Distress of Nation and Reich, commonly known as the Enabling Act (Ermächtigungsgesetz). This law allows Hitler, as Chancellor, to initiate and sign legislation into law without obtaining parliamentary consent. The act effectively establishes a dictatorship, under Hitler, in Germany.\n\nJune 30-July 2, 1934\n\nOn Hitler’s order, Nazi leaders eliminate the leadership of the SA and kill other political enemies. The murderous purge cements an agreement between the Nazi regime and the German army that consolidates Nazi power and enables Hitler to proclaim himself Führer (leader) of Germany and to claim absolute power.\n\nSummer 1936\n\nHitler opens the Berlin Olympics. 1936 represents a rare instance in which one nation, Germany, hosted both the winter and summer Olympic Games. Nazi Germany uses the 1936 Olympics for propaganda purposes. The Nazis promote an image of a new, strong, and united Germany while masking the regime’s targeting of Jews and Roma (Gypsies) as well as Germany’s growing militarism.\n\n1938\n\nHitler meets with the leaders of Britain, France, and Italy at a conference in Munich, Germany, on September 29–30, 1938, in which they agree to the German annexation of the Sudetenland in exchange for a pledge of peace from Germany. Six months later, Hitler moves against the Czechoslovak state.\n\nMarch 12, 1938\n\nGerman troops march into Austria. Native son Adolf Hitler crosses the Austro-German border at midday at his hometown, Braunau on the Inn. On the following day, the annexation of Austria to the German Reich is announced. On March 15, Hitler enters the Austrian capital Vienna before a cheering crowd of 200,000.\n\nJanuary 23, 1939\n\nIn a speech to the German parliament in January 1939, Hitler states that another world war will result in the elimination of Jews from Europe.\n\nAugust 23, 1939\n\nGerman and Soviet foreign ministers Ribbentrop and Molotov, respectively, sign a German-Soviet Pact. The main tenet of this agreement is a ten-year non-aggression pact in which each signatory promises not to attack the other.\n\nSeptember 1, 1939\n\nNazi Germany invades Poland, initiating World War II.\n\nFall 1939 or early January 1940\n\nAdolf Hitler signs a secret authorization for a “euthanasia’” program, the systematic killing of patients with mental and physical disabilities who are living in institutional settings in Germany and German-annexed territories. It is the only instance in which Hitler signs an authorization for a program of systematic mass murder.\n\n1941\n\nIn 1941, Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich and other leading German authorities reach the decision to physically annihilate the Jews of Europe.\n\nJune 22, 1941\n\nThe German army invades the Soviet Union in \"Operation Barbarossa.\" As opposed to their conquests in western Europe, Hitler and other Nazi leaders see war against the Soviet Union in racial and ideological terms.\n\nDecember 11, 1941\n\nIn the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Nazi Germany and its ally Italy declare war on the United States, despite the fact that the US had declared war only against the Empire of Japan. In less than a year, American ground troops will fight German forces in North Africa.\n\nJune 9, 1942\n\nHitler orders retaliatory measures against the Czech population following the death of Reinhard Heydrich, second-in-command of the SS. The towns of Lidice and Lezaky are destroyed and the inhabitants massacred or deported.\n\nJanuary 31–February 2, 1943\n\nAfter months of fierce fighting and heavy casualties, German forces (numbering now only about 91,000 surviving soldiers) surrender at Stalingrad in a major turning point of World War II and a disaster for Hitler’s long-held goal of defeating the Soviet Union.\n\nJune 6, 1944\n\nAllied troops successfully land on the Normandy beaches of France, opening a “Second Front” against the Germans and Hitler's regime.\n\nJuly 20, 1944\n\nHitler survives an assassination attempt coordinated by military and civilian officials. The failure of the attempt and the intended coup which was to follow led to the arrest of some 7,000 and the execution of nearly 5,000 individuals.\n\nApril 30, 1945\n\nHitler commits suicide in an underground bunker in Berlin rather than face capture by advancing Soviet forces."
