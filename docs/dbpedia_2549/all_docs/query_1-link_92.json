Kessler\n\nDesign Team Lead\n\nLunar Surface Habitat\n\nHabitation Formulation Systems\n\nHabitation Systems Development Office\n\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\n\nAs NASA and its partnersâ capabilities for human exploration of deep space continue to mature, so too does the roadmap toward a sustained crewed presence on the surface of the Moon and eventual human missions to Mars. The first launch of the Space Launch System and Orion crew vehicle, the contract award for the first demonstrations of a Human Landing System, and the beginning of construction on the initial elements of the lunar Gateway marked major milestones toward NASAâs near-term human exploration goals: a long-duration outpost in orbit around the Moon and the next footsteps on the lunar surface.\n\nAt the same time, NASA is in the early phases of planning the capabilities that will be needed for long-term exploration of the moon and Mars. Among the common elements that will be required by long-duration stays on the lunar surface, transit to Mars, and Martian surface expeditions will be new habitats unlike any flown to date. NASA is currently working on development of architectures for those habitats and on the technological advancements that will enable them, with an eye toward systems that will not only extend mission operations but also provide for living quarters that will keep the crew happy and healthy throughout their expeditions.\n\nBeyond the Gateway habitation needs, these capabilities will need to be defined and advanced to support the initial lunar surface missions and to prepare for human missions to the Mars system. The Surface Habitat is the current concept in consideration to serve as this initial surface habitat that will extend the crew mission durations. It will provide 30-to-60-day habitability for a crew of up to four, allowing astronauts to explore farther and longer on each visit to the lunar sur-face. NASA is also currently reviewing opportunities to use current or near-term in-space habitation systems as proving grounds or precursors for keeping astronauts safe and healthy during future transits to Mars. Already, the International Space Station (ISS) is being used for implementation of next-generation life support systems that will inform those used in exploration habitats, and the operations approach for ISS is providing lessons-learned for future science operations around or on the Moon.\n\nWhile a suite of habitation concepts is currently under study within NASA, the agency is also working closely with US industry through the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) to understand their concepts for commercially provided habitation capabilities as well as close coordination with international partners to understand their desires for in-space and surface habitation.\n\nThis presentation will provide a status of these concepts and partnership activities as well as potential future technology and architecture development paths.\n\nSelected Reading & Media References\n\nKessler, T.

Morgan\n\nProgram Manager & Space Habitation Architecture Lead\n\nLockheed Martin Space\n\nRecent advancements in space transportation systems and successful completion of NASAâs Artemis I mission have ushered in a new era of human spaceflight, enabling humans to once again travel beyond low-earth orbit. The burgeoning new age of crewed space exploration will entail new technologies and support systems that will need to be developed to sustain humans for longer periods of time in deep space in order to eventually achieve the goal of landing on Mars.\n\nThis talk will discuss mission architectures for future orbital, surface, and transport spacecraft that Lockheed Martin is working on in partnership with industry, academia, and government partners to enable future expeditions to the Moon and Mars.\n\nSelected Reading & Media References\n\n(a) Edwards, and T.

For example, for a sustained lunar base this infrastructure includes various class 1, 2, and 3 type architectures that are highly dependent on pre-integrated systems as well as robotic construction equipment, among other critical technologies. A fundamental and enabling element is a habitat architecture that provides the foundation for these activities and allows work that enables future surface exploration and resource development. A critical challenge for a habitat of significant scale is the landed mass limitations, which need to be overcome to increase habitat functionality.\n\nThis lecture will focus on the challenges of designing, engineering, and building the habitat architecture needed for a permanent presence on the moon and elsewhere in the solar system, which can be achieved by producing lightweight, multi-purpose, structurally innovative, and highly integrated solutions. A high level of integration is necessary to support mission critical functions and to provide facilities where flexible commercial, research, scientific, and industrial activities can take place. This level of habitat integration is an enabling aspect sustainable long-term lunar system ecosystem.\n\nA human-centered design approach is an essential part of the architectural process to design, engineer, and build this type of permanent habitat capability, The influence of environmental variables such as anthropometry, lighting, temperature, human-machine interactions, comfort, and health directly impact how occupants will inhabit and utilize habitats. These are among the key considerations necessary to develop a habitat architecture with a human-centered focus, extending mission durations, and enhancing human-systems integration.\n\nThe result of this human-centered design approach is another level of hybridization and multi-functionality, offering advantages over temporary, limited, or single-purpose solutions. These habitat architectures leverage systems and technologies for their unique characteristics but also offer adaptability for future activities. Other considerations include functions such as environmental protection systems, structures, multi-purpose racks, crew quarters, workstations, and interfaces.\n\nThis lecture will discuss new ideas for lunar habitat architecture that can enable the much larger ecosystem needed to build the foundation for future exploration and resource development on the moon and elsewhere.\n\nSelected Reading & Media References\n\n(a) Space Architecture for a Moon Village: https://pswscience.org/meeting/2412/\n\n(b) Danielâs website with many publications and links: https://danielinocente.com/project/moon-village/\n\n(c) https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/cdf/Moon_Village_v1.1_Public.pdf\n\n(d) https://www.dezeen.com/2021/07/07/moon-village-human-centric-inflatable-habitat-the-moon/\n\n(4) On-Demand Infrastructure for the Moon, Mars, and Other Worlds: Make It â Donât Take It\n\nRaymond âCorkyâ Clinton, Jr.\n\nSenior Technical Advisor\n\nScience & Technology Office\n\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\n\nNASA plans to land astronauts on the Moon by 2025 through the initial Artemis missions. NASA and its international partners plan to establish a sustainable long-term presence on the lunar surface per the blueprint outlined in NASAâs Moon to Mars Strategy and Objectives Development document. The Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) aims to spur the creation of novel technologies needed for lunar surface exploration and accelerate the technology readiness of key systems and components. The STMD primary technology thrust areas are categorized as Go, Land, Live, and Explore the Moon. Technologies in the Live thrust area are captured under the Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative (LSII) and include sustainable power; dust mitigation; in-situ resource utilization; surface excavation, construction, and outfitting; and extreme access/extreme environments.\n\nLiving and working on the Moon, establishing a sustainable human presence, requires infrastructure including the technologies highlighted under the LSII. Making maximum use of in situ resources and living off the land is envisioned to reduce the dependency on Earth-supplied consumables, materials, and hardware that would otherwise be required to be launched from Earth for deep space exploration.\n\nThis lecture will focus on development of capabilities enabling on-demand construction of lunar infrastructure. A brief overview of NASAâs Moon to Mars Planetary Autonomous Construction Technology (MMPACT) project will include plans for testing of the various candidate lunar construction materials, preliminary design concepts for future lunar infrastructure elements, and the vision for future extraterrestrial technology demonstrations.\n\nSelected Reading & Media References\n\n(a) NASAâs Moon to Mars Strategy and Objectives Development.
