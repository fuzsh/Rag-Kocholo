Nuts and bolts, not grand forces of history and social change; real decisions made by real people at precise moments in time.\n\nKey Quote: \"Because Germany was a republic when Hitler became chancellor, many assume that he was democratically elected by a majority of the German people. Such was not, however, the case. His rise to power was far more complicated and, above all, more chancy. It was, in fact, a very near thing that could have been thwarted at numerous points.\" - p. xi"
