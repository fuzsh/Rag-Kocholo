        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThis is an account of the events which culminated in Adolf Hitler's taking power in January 1933. Combating the prevailing view that Nazi rule was inevitable - a result of what T.S. Eliot called \"the great impersonal forces\" of history - the book shows how luck, political intrigue and the personal weaknesses of Hitler's more powerful, traditional-conservative opponents paved the way to his chancellorship. The book provides a portrait of Hitler and the other main players in this political drama: President and ageing war hero Marshal Paul von Hindenburg; his miscalculating Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher (whom Hitler would later murder); and Hitler's devious co-conspirator, ex-chancellor Franz von Papen. This story re-establishes the importance of individual actors in the unfolding of historical events. Henry Ashby Turner Jr is the author of \"German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler\" and \"Germany from Partition to Reunification\".\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title."
