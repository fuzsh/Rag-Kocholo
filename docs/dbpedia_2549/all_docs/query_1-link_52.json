        "text": "1. Reichstag Fire - 27 Feb 1933\n\nThe Reichstag (the German Parliament) burned down. A Dutch Communist named van der Lubbe was caught red-handed with matches and fire-lighting materials. Hitler used it as an excuse to arrest many of his Communist opponents, and as a major platform in his election campaign of March 1933. The fire was so convenient that many people at the time claimed that the Nazis had burned it down, and then just blamed the Communists. Modern historians, however, tend to believe that van der Lubbe did cause the fire.\n\nEleven Results of the Fire\n\nMany historians regard the Reichstag Fire as the critical event, which gave Hitler the OPPORTUNITY to seize control of the government.\n\n1. On 28 February, Hitler issued the Reichstag Fire Decree authorising a police state and suspending most civil freedoms. Political marches and groups were banned, newspapers censored, houses and post searched, telephones tapped. The German historian KD Bracher (1969) believed that this was more important in the Nazis consolidation of power than the Enabling Act.\n\n2. The KPD delegates were expelled from parliament; many were imprisoned. Ernst Thälmann, the leader of the German Communist Party, was arrested.\n\n3. Thousands of political opponents  KPD and SDP  were arrested overnight and carted off to the first, makeshift concentration camps. (The swift action actually increased support for Hitler.).\n\n4. KPD candidates were forbidden to stand in the election, but their names were left on the ballot papers to confuse the Left-Wing vote.\n\n5. A massive propaganda campaign was launched against the KPD accusing them of attempting a putsch, just before the election.\n\n6. Nazi Stormtroopers went on a rampage of window-smashing, beatings and murder.\n\n7. Van der Lubbe and four leading Communists were put on trial. Der Lubbe was easily convicted and executed, but the trial turned out to be an embarrassment. It lasted 5 months. Prosecution witnesses (including Goering and Goebbels) were exposed as liars. The defendants  notably Georgi Dimitrov (who later became Prime Minister of Bulgaria)  ran rings round the judge and were acquitted. Worst of all, in their attempt to convict the Communists, the Nazis produced expert witnesses who testified that the fire could not have been started by one man a tactic which backfired when people started accusing the Nazis themselves of starting the fire.\n\n8. One of the results of the failure of the trial was that the Nazis set up Volksgerichtshof  Peoples Courts  where they were sure to get the verdict they wanted.\n\n9. In the 1950s, the journalist Walter Kiaulehn said the Fire was the 'opening act' of the Nazi terror.\n\n10. The German lawyer and political scientist Ernst Fraenkel (1941) called the Reichstag Fire Decree the constitutional charter of Hitlers Reich.\n\n11. Lawyer and historian BC Hett wrote (2014) that the fire marked the real beginning of what was arguably the most violently destructive regime in human history. He believes that the interest in the Fire is part of Germans coping with the past.\n\nBBC Bitesize on the Reichstag Fire\n\nHistory Place - narrative account\n\nShort informative YouTube account"
