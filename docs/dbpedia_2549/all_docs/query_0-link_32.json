By June 1939, the waiting list of Germans and Austrians seeking entry into the U.S. had grown to 309,782.[1]\n\nAs of November 1941, the Roosevelt administration expected a Japanese attack but was uncertain as to when and where. The attack came on December 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, ending a heated domestic debate on U.S. involvement in the war.\n\nThe U.S. war in the Pacific took on aspects of a racial war, with the Japanese described as “rats” and pictured with sinister features. Racial prejudice was also directed at American citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry. A presidential order forced 120,000 living in West Coast States to abandon their homes and businesses and live in barren internment camps for the duration of the war.\n\nIn the European theater, the Soviet Red Army accounted for three-quarters of German casualties and turned the tide of the war in January 1943.\n\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin urged the U.S. and Great Britain to open a Second Front in Western Europe, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill repeatedly pushed for delays. The British-American-Canadian “D-day” invasion took place on June 6, 1944.\n\nThe war saw the creation of a dizzying array of new and horrifying military technologies including flamethrowers, bazookas, recoilless rifles, radar, guided missiles, PT “devil boats” armed with automatic weapons and torpedoes, napalm (jellied gasoline that burns the flesh), and pilotless airplanes or drones. It also witnessed the first use of computers for military purposes.\n\nMass bombing of civilians became standard fare in the war. The U.S. Army Air Force initially attempted “precision bombing” of enemy assets but by 1944 had moved to general “area bombing,” obliterating cities and killing civilians en masse. The U.S. firebombed Tokyo on March 10, 1945, killing 90,000 Japanese civilians in single night.\n\nThe U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 killed approximately 200,000 people on impact, and tens of thousands more from radiation poisoning and cancer.[2] Seven out of eight top U.S. military commanders, including General Douglas MacArthur, believed the use of atomic bombs was unnecessary from a strategic-military vantage point.\n\nThere were more than 43,000 conscientious objectors to war in World War II, three times as many as in World War I. Of these, 6,600 men were imprisoned for either refusing to register for the draft or rejecting alternative service work.\n\nAn estimated 80 million people died from war-related causes in World War II, amounting to three percent of the 1940 world population of 2.3 billion.[3] U.S. military and civilian war deaths totaled 419,000, less than one percent of worldwide deaths attributed to the war.[4] The Soviet Union, by contrast, suffered 20-27 million fatalities, and China, 10-15 million.\n\nI. Introduction: “The good war”\n\nThe Second World War is popularly remembered as “the good war” in American history, a heroic struggle against fascist totalitarian states. America’s adversaries indeed fit this characterization, with Nazi Germany committing some of the most heinous atrocities the world has ever seen. Nonetheless, if we scrutinize the origins and conduct of the war, we see that it was not entirely a righteous one for the victorious Allies.\n\nThe main belligerents in the Second World War were the Allied powers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and the Axis powers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. The war entailed two largely separate theaters of war, one in Europe and North Africa, the other in Asia and the Pacific. Both were products of competing empires and great power rivalries.\n\nBefore Japanese troops went on a rampage in China in July 1937, Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States all established colonies in Asia and the Pacific, subduing resistance, denying democracy, exploiting natural resources, and institutionalizing white racism. Japan entered the imperial game in the late 19th century, successfully battling China (1894-1895) and Russia (1904-1905) before annexing Korea in 1910. Japan’s goals were to establish a powerful pan-Asian bloc under its dominion capable of resisting Western imperialism, exploiting the region’s resources and establishing a yen-bloc to undercut the American dollar as a mode of currency exchange.\n\nWestern powers accepted Japan’s dominion over Korea but not its attempt to take over the eastern half of China.[5] The U.S. nevertheless did little to help China until early 1940 when it began to provide military aid to the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) and to gradually restrict the flow of U.S. oil, steel, iron, and other commodities to resource-deficient Japan. Japanese leaders responded by developing plans to take over Southeast Asia, particularly the oil-rich Dutch East Indies (Indonesia today). Seeking allies, Japan’s foreign minister called on Asians to reject Western rule and align with Japan in its newly formed Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In September 1940, Japan signed a mutual defense pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The last shipment of U.S. oil for Japan departed on August 5, 1941.[6]\n\nAs late as November 1941, U.S. ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew believed that compromise with Japan was still possible and war could be avoided. He urged his superiors in Washington to adopt a more conciliatory posture. Had not the U.S. accepted the British, French, and Dutch empires in Asia? Why not also a restrained Japanese empire? Most Washington officials, however, particularly Secretary of War Henry Stimson, opposed further appeasement of the Japanese militarists.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, for his part, was most concerned with the war in Europe, which had begun in September 1939, particularly with the survival of Great Britain. Indeed, his generals had drawn up a contingency war plan aimed at “the complete military defeat of Germany.”[7] The problem for Roosevelt was that the great majority of Americans had no interest in fighting any war, be it in Europe or Asia. At a cabinet meeting on November 7, 1941, the president asked his advisers “whether the people would back us up in case we struck at Japan down there and what the tactics should be.”[8] Four days before that meeting, Ambassador Grew had sent a telegram to the State Department warning that if conciliation failed, “Japan may resort, with dangerous and dramatic suddenness to measures which might make inevitable war with the United States.”[9]\n\nThe possibility of war was discussed again at a special “War Cabinet” meeting at the White House on Monday, November 25. Stimson recorded in his diary that the president “brought up the event that we were likely to be attacked perhaps (as soon as) next Monday, for the Japanese are notorious for making an attack without warning, and the question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves. It was a difficult proposition.”[10]\n\nRoosevelt, in other words, clearly expected war but did not want to initiate it, lest the American people fail to unify behind it.[11] Some critics have argued that the president was intent on provoking an incident with Japan in order to justify U.S. entry into the war.[12] The oil embargo in particular was devastating to Japan and made an attack on the U.S. more likely.\n\nThe “first shot,” in any case, proved more devastating than expected. On December 7 and 8, Japanese forces launched an attack, not only on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, located almost 4,000 miles east of Japan, but also against the Philippines, Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Thailand. On December 8, Roosevelt asked Congress for a declaration of war against Japan. Three days later, Nazi Germany declared war against the United States.\n\nEuropean geopolitics\n\nThe outbreak of war in Europe was driven by a different set of geopolitical rivalries dating back to the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) and the First World War (1914-18). The outcome of the latter war sowed deep resentment in Germany. Under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, Germany was forced to accept sole responsibility for the war, to permit French and Belgian military occupation of the Ruhr industrial region (until 1925), to give up 13.5 percent of its territory, 10 percent of its population, 75 percent of its iron ore deposits, and 100 percent of its colonies, and to pay 132 billion gold marks to the victorious nations, thus ensuring Germany’s impoverishment in the postwar period.[13] German Chancellor Philip Scheidemann called the treaty “the vilest crime in history.” British Prime Minister David Lloyd George predicted that the treaty would lead to disaster, stating, “I cannot conceive any greater cause for future war.”[14]\n\nIn both Germany and Japan, political leaders took advantage of national vulnerabilities to impose authoritarianism, create cults of leadership worship (Adolf Hitler and Emperor Hirohito), excite military passions and territorial ambitions, and indoctrinate their respective publics with beliefs in their racial superiority. Germany’s infamous racist ideology is more well known, having led to the murder of millions of European Jews during the war, but Japanese leaders also propagated a racist national ideology, touting the “spiritual and physical purity” of the Japanese people, which presumably entitled them to rule over Asia.[15]\n\nFrom the end of World War I to 1939, the U.S. and British governments were less concerned with the growth of fascist governments in Europe than with the spread of communism. Indeed, when Benito Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922, U.S. officials welcomed his National Fascist Party as a force for stability and a bulwark against Bolshevism (communism). “In developing American policy,” writes the historian David F. Schmitz, “officials in Washington were mainly influenced by Mussolini’s establishment of a stable, noncommunist government that welcomed American trade and investments.” This view, in turn, “allowed American officials to ignore Mussolini’s brutal repression of all opposition groups, destruction of Italy’s constitutional government, and rule by violence.”[16] Conservative British leader Winston Churchill was of a similar mind. Following a meeting with Mussolini in Rome in January 1927, Churchill praised the dictator at a press conference, saying, “If I had been an Italian, I am sure that I should have been whole-heartedly with you from start to finish in your triumphant struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism.”[17]\n\nIn June 1933, eleven years into Mussolini’s iron-fisted rule, President Roosevelt wrote to his ambassador to Italy, Samuel Breckinridge Long, that he was “deeply impressed by what [Mussolini] had accomplished and by his evidenced honest purpose of restoring Italy and seeking to prevent general European trouble.” The following month, Roosevelt wrote to a friend, “I don’t mind telling you in confidence that I am keeping in fairly close touch with that admirable Italian gentleman.”[18]\n\nMussolini provided the role model for Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in Germany. Upon Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in January 1933, American ambassador to Germany Frederic Sackett wrote, “From the standpoint of stable political conditions, it is perhaps well that Hitler is now in a position to wield unprecedented power.” The U.S. State Department drew favorable comparisons between Italian fascism and German Nazism, identifying both Mussolini and Hitler as leaders of the “moderate sections” of their parties as distinct from the violent extremes. The U.S. embassy in Berlin added that “in the field of economics and finance . . . American businesses in Germany had nothing to fear.” Indeed, they did not, as U.S.-based corporations, including General Motors, Ford, Standard Oil Company, IBM, and Chase Manhattan Bank, invested and profited from their operations in Nazi Germany.[19] According to Schmitz:\n\nAlthough never praising Hitler in the same manner as it did Mussolini, the State Department did find reasons to be optimistic about Hitler and the American ability to influence Berlin. The same criteria for judging fascist Italy would be used with Nazi Germany. The key factors would be Nazi economic and foreign policies, not the nature of the Nazi regime. . . . His [Hitler’s] Nazi Party promised a strong anticommunist force in Central Europe, stability, and order.[20]\n\nIn 1937, after more than four years of Nazi dictatorial rule and anti-Jewish policies and propaganda, the U.S. State Department continued to maintain that fascist-type governments were compatible with U.S. interests, free trade, and the international order. A February 1937 report written by the department’s European Division defined fascism as a respectable movement of the propertied classes aimed at defending the existing order and private property against Bolshevism. Where fascism was in power, the authors judged that “it must succeed or the masses, this time reinforced by the disillusioned middle classes, will again turn to the Left.” The goal of the United States, as such, was to ensure that Germany would recover economically. Should the economy falter, they warned, “war is possible, if not probable.”[21]\n\nIn hindsight, it is clear that economic recovery in Nazi Germany produced, not peace, but militarization and dreams of empire. The policy of appeasement was not abandoned by Great Britain and the U.S. until very late in the game, after Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Six months later, Germany invaded Poland, and Britain and France declared war on Germany, inaugurating the Second World War in Europe. A different set of foreign policy guidelines in London and Washington during the 1930s might have produced a different outcome (see Section IV).\n\nWas it necessary for the United States to enter World War II? Yes. The United States was attacked by Japanese forces, making this a defensive war, and Germany declared war on the U.S. soon after. U.S. military power helped defeat Nazi Germany, a genocidal regime bent on world conquest, along with its Axis allies. Still, there are many caveats to consider, as this essay will detail.\n\nConduct of the war\n\nThe memory of the Second World War as “the good war” is largely an American phenomenon. Apart from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States remained free from the devastation that enveloped much of Europe and Asia. The U.S. economy, furthermore, rose out of the doldrums of the Great Depression to produce massive quantities of weapons and munitions for both U.S. and Allied forces as well as ample goods for domestic consumption, albeit with some rationing. Hiring in the defense industries was expanded to more women and African Americans.\n\nIt was nevertheless the Soviet Union that did the heaviest fighting to defeat the Nazi war machine, and the Soviet people that suffered the most in the process. “What is beyond doubt,” said Rodric Braithwaite, former British Ambassador to the Soviet Union/Russian Federation, “is that four-fifths of the fighting in Europe took place on the Eastern Front, and that is where the Germans suffered ninety percent of their casualties. Even after D-Day [June 6, 1944], two-thirds of the German forces were in the East. If they had not been there, they would have been in France, and there would have been no D-Day. And that is why the Russians tend to think it was they who won the war, and why I tend to think that they are right.”[22] The Soviet Union lost an estimated 24 to 27 million of its people in the war, of which at least 14 million were civilians, as compared to total fatalities of 451,000 British and 419,000 American. For every American who died from war causes, the Soviets lost 57 people.[23]\n\nThe “good war” moniker also derives from the fact that there was year by year progress toward an Allied victory. By early 1943, the Soviet army had begun to push the German army out of the Soviet Union and the U.S. was on the offensive in the Pacific. The label, however, elides the effects of the Allied aerial assaults on cities and civilians. U.S. and British bombers laid waste to dozens of German cities, and the U.S. alone firebombed sixty-six Japanese cities, killing as many as 900,000 Japanese people and leaving eight million homeless.[24] On the night of March 9, 1945, to take one example, U.S. bombers unleashed incendiary bombs that set Tokyo ablaze, killing over 90,000 people. Robert S. McNamara, who served as a deputy to Curtis Lemay, the architect of the Tokyo firebombing, told interviewer Errol Morris years later that if “the allies had not won the war, we’d have been hung as war criminals.”[25]\n\nThe Second World War was a “total war” in which previous international protocols concerning the protection of civilians were abandoned. The historian Antony Beevor has labeled the war “the greatest man-made disaster in history.”[26] The atomic bombs dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, respectively, killed over 200,000 people, with cancer and radiation sickness killing countless more over time. The Truman administration insisted that the bombings were necessary to end the war quickly and save American lives, but much historical evidence challenges this justification (see Section VII).[27]\n\nAll wars involve the dehumanization of the enemy, but the virulent racism that permeated the U.S. war in the Pacific fostered an excess of demonizing stereotypes and atrocities. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, writes the historian John W. Dower, “provoked a rage bordering on the genocidal among Americans. Following the attack, Admiral William Halsey, soon to become the commander of the South Pacific Force, rallied his men under the slogan, ‘kill Japs, kill Japs, kill more Japs.’”\n\nJapanese soldiers, for their part, were indoctrinated with the Bushido military code, derived from the samurai, which disparaged surrender as the ultimate dishonor. As U.S. and Japanese forces clashed in battle after battle on Pacific islands, Japanese soldiers resisted to the end, often engaging in suicidal “banzai” attacks rather than surrender. On some islands, Japanese commanders ordered civilians not to surrender, and hundreds killed themselves or were bayonetted by Japanese soldiers. It was nevertheless American firepower that produced the most civilian fatalities, which numbered 95,000 on Okinawa alone.[28]\n\nRacism also underlay President Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942, which mandated the removal of “enemy aliens” from West Coast cities. Some 120,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were rounded up and placed in internment camps for the duration of the war. About two-thirds of those detained were American citizens, born in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the legality of the executive order in two cases.[29] About 11,000 German nationals were also placed in detention camps, although each case was individually examined.\n\nLegacies\n\nStuds Terkel noted in “The Good War”: An Oral History of World War II (1984) two additional reasons for the benefic label: “Wartime prosperity had extended into an exhilarating period of postwar prosperity. The United States had become the most powerful industrial as well as military power in the world.”[30] Again, these were uniquely American experiences, and the latter attribute, predominant military power, was not necessarily welcomed by other countries. Reverend A. J. Muste, a revolutionary pacifist, was prescient in foreseeing that the Allied victory would yield “a new American empire” incorporating a subservient Britain. He wrote in 1941, “The problem after a war is the victor. He thinks he has just proved that war and violence pay. Who will now teach him a lesson?”[31] Muste’s concern was echoed by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Gene La Rocque, who told Terkel in an interview:\n\nYou could argue World War Two had to be fought. Hitler had to be stopped. Unfortunately, we translate it unchanged to the situation today. . . . World War Two has warped our view of how we look at things today. We see things in terms of that war, which in a sense was a good war. But the memory of it encourages the men of my generation to be willing, almost eager, to use military force anywhere in the world.[32]\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, a “victory culture” emerged in the U.S., cultivated in part by Hollywood films that glorified war and presented a distorted, Manichaean view of global affairs.[33] U.S. leaders projected this view onto the emerging Cold War between the U.S. and Soviet Union, turning a geopolitical rivalry into a mythic struggle between freedom and totalitarianism. In reality, the U.S. supported many dictatorial governments before, during, and after the Second World War, while Great Britain lorded over a vast empire in Asia and Africa.[34] The Second World War proved to be a pivotal turning point in America’s transition from a regional power to a global power. In the coming years, its influence would be sustained, like that of other empires in the past, by considerable violence.[35]\n\nThis book-length essay seeks to provide a critical overview of the history of World War II. It discusses the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany; reviews the Western policy of appeasement and the complicity of U.S. corporations; addresses the question of whether more could have been done to save Jewish victims of genocide; examines the failure of the U.S. to support international organizations and collective security efforts during the interwar years; restores the importance of Russia’s role in defeating Nazi Germany; surveys major battles and casualties; examines the U.S. debates over bombing civilians and the decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and describes the U.S. home front during the war, including the incarceration of Japanese-American citizens and treatment of conscientious objectors to war. The last section explores legacies and lessons of the Second World War.\n\n* * * * *\n\nII. The rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi rule in Germany\n\nThe First World War, as historian Ian Kershaw wrote, made Adolf Hitler possible. Without the experience of war, the humiliation of defeat, and the upheaval of revolution, the failed artist and social drop-out would not have found his métier as a propagandist and beerhall demagogue. Without the collective trauma of war and subsequent political radicalization of German society, the right-wing agitator would have been without an audience for his raucous, hate-filled message. Without the war, a Hitler sitting in the chancellor’s seat once occupied by Otto von Bismarck would have been unthinkable.[36]\n\nHitler was born in the small Austrian town of Braunau am Inn on April 30, 1889. His father, Alois Hitler, reportedly subjected Adolf to frequent humiliation and pressured him to follow his example in becoming a customs officer, which Adolf did not want to do. His mother, Klara Pölzl, was 23 years younger than Alois and a devoted mother, especially as her first three children had all died of diseases while very young. Adolf grew up with an older half-brother and half-sister, and a younger brother and sister. His father died in 1903 and Adolf left school three years later, at the age of sixteen, and moved to Vienna. He dreamed of becoming a professional artist but failed two entrance exams of the Academy of Fine Arts. Informed in 1907 that his mother had a terminal case of cancer, Adolf moved back home to care for her in her last months. She died in December of that year.[37] Adolf later wrote in his autobiography, Mein Kampf, “I had honored my father, but my mother I had loved.”[38]\n\nHitler as a youth developed a glorified view of war, hearing romanticized stories about the Franco-Prussian War and the Boer War and adventure stories of the American West written by Karl Friedrich May, which became his passion.[39] At the age of 25, Hitler found new meaning and purpose in life with the outbreak of the Great War (World War I), which he called “the greatest and most unforgettable time of my earthly existence.” On August 2, 1914, one day after Germany declared war on Russia, Hitler could be seen in a photograph enwrapped in war hysteria at a huge patriotic demonstration on Munich’s Odeonsplatz. Three days later, though he was a citizen of Austria-Hungary, Hitler volunteered for service in the German Bavarian Infantry regiment.\n\nHitler’s regiment had its baptism of fire in October 1914, on the Menin Road near Ypres where its fighting force was reduced from 3,600 to 611 men. Hitler said he came to the realization afterwards that “life is a constant, horrible struggle.” According to Kershaw, Hitler was utterly fanatical about the war and believed that “no humanitarian feelings” should “interfere with the ruthless prosecution of German interests.” He vehemently disapproved of the spontaneous gestures of friendship on Christmas day 1914, when German and British troops met in “no man’s land,” shaking hands and singing carols together.[40] Other men in Hitler’s unit found him intolerable: “There was this white crow among us,” one stated, “that didn’t go along with us when we damned the war to hell.”[41]\n\nToward the end of the war, Hitler received the Iron Cross, First Class for delivering an important message through heavy fire to the front, following a breakdown in telephone communication. Hitler was also partially blinded by mustard gas. While he was recovering in a hospital, he learned the shattering news of Germany’s defeat. In his memoirs, Mein Kampf, written in 1924, Hitler recalled: “And so it had all been in vain. In vain all the sacrifices and privations; in vain the hunger and thirst of months that were often endless; in vain the hours in which mutual fear clutching at our hearts, we nevertheless did our duty; and in vain the deaths of two million who died.” Hitler called on his generation to “open and send the silent mud and blood covered heroes back as spirits of vengeance to the homeland which had cheated them with such mockery.”[42]\n\nIn Hitler’s assessment, the German army had not been defeated by its enemies on the battlefield but rather by treasonous foes of the war at home – notably, Jews and Marxists. This thesis became known as the stab-in-the-back legend (Dolchstoßlegenden), promoted by Field Marshall Paul Von Hindenburg, among others, and served as a vehicle for Hitler’s rise to power. In the aftermath of the war, Germany went through a period of revolutionary turmoil. In Munich, communist leader Eugen Leviné declared the establishment of a Bavarian Soviet Republic (Raterepublik) between November 1918 and May 1919. Leviné and a number of other leftist agitators were Jews, including Ernst Toller, Gustav Landauer, and Erich Mühsam. To put down the rebellion, the Weimar national government under Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert allied with far-right paramilitary units who brutally crushed the Bavarian Soviet Republic, which they labeled the “Jewish Republic.” At least 1,200 supporters of the short-lived Soviet-allied government were murdered, with corpses left to rot in the streets for days before being hauled off to mass graves.[43] Hitler himself served as an informant who carried out investigations into left wing actions. Afterwards, Bavaria became a bastion of the conservative right and fertile ground for Hitler’s political rise. He was invited by Captain Karl Mayr, head of the army’s Information Department, to give lectures promoting anti-Bolshevik and German nationalist themes. Here, Hitler discovered his talent for public speaking and oratory.[44]\n\nThe Nazi party\n\nHitler soon became the leader of the German National Socialist Workers Party (Nazi), formed in February 1920. This right-wing party’s appropriation of the word “socialism,” traditionally associated with the left, was designed to draw workers from trade unions. The Nazi party attracted a small but vigorous following in the early 1920s. Hitler packed the beer halls with his fiery speeches, typically contrasting Germany’s strength in a glorious past with its current weakness and national humiliation. The decline of Germany was blamed on Jews, communists, and other alleged traitors such as the leading Centre Party politician and Reich finance minister, Matthias Erzberger, who signed the Armistice in 1918. The Nazi party and its supporters also held Jews responsible for revolutionary agitation, epitomized by the prominence of two Jews, Rosa Luxembourg and Paul Levi, in the communist Spartacus movement of Germany.\n\nThe Weimar Republic (1918-1933) gained its name because the national assembly met in the classic city of German literature, Weimar. Many within and outside of Germany hoped that the government would inaugurate a new democratic era, the authoritarian role of the Kaiser having been replaced by a chancellor selected by the majority party in the Reichstag (national legislature). The nation did, in fact, witness a cultural renaissance and the growth of a multiparty democracy, albeit amid economic hardship, hyperinflation, and an undercurrent of anger over the Great War.[45] A budding peace movement also arose in the early 1920s. Mass marches were held in Berlin and other cities under the banner of “Never Again War.” Supported by the German Peace Society, the church-based German World Alliance, and notable figures such as Albert Einstein, winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, peace advocates eschewed rightist appeals for revenge and promoted a different lesson from the Great War.[46]\n\nIn November 1923, Hitler led a beer hall putsch in a failed attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic. In the course of the putsch, Hitler’s supporters went on an antisemitic rampage, rounding up and beating Jews – a prelude of what was to come. Hitler’s treasonous attack earned him a five-year prison sentence, but he ultimately served only nine months. During this time, he penned his racist manifesto, Mein Kampf. In a passage embracing the stab-in-the-back legend, he wrote: “In 1918, we paid in blood for the fact that in 1914/15 we did not proceed to trample the head of the Marxist serpent once and for all. If at the beginning of the war and during the war, twelve or fifteen thousand of those Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.” Here we see a clear foreshadowing of the Holocaust. Hitler’s writings refer to Jews as maggots, bloodsucking spiders, plague-inducing rats, vampires, and parasites.[47]\n\nIn terms of German public support for the Nazi party, the Versailles Treaty and the economy stood out as the most important factors. Virulent anti-Jewish attitudes took time for the Nazis to cultivate, evident in their gradual approach to curbing Jewish rights and freedoms between 1933 and 1938. One of the most powerful men supporting Hitler was media mogul Alfred Hugenberg, former director of Krupp Armaments, who financed weekly newsreels shown in movie theatres. The popular newsreels led many Germans to view Hitler as a respectable politician and statesman and potential future chancellor. The American media mogul William Randolph Hearst, whose career inspired Orson Welles’s famous movie “Citizen Kane,” was similarly enamored with Hitler, even inviting Hitler to write two articles that were published in his periodicals in 1930.[48]\n\nThe onset of the Great Depression destabilized the economically weak Weimar Republic, allowing the Nazi party to rapidly rise in democratic elections. The party won 107 seats in the 577-seat Reichstag in the 1930 elections, as compared to 143 for the Social Democrats, and 77 for the Communist party. In the July 1932 elections, the Nazi Party became the single largest party in the national legislature. Though the Nazi party enjoyed only 32 percent of the popular vote, the other parties failed to unite against it. The Communist party, which held 89 of the 607 seats that year, made the fatal error of accepting Nazi leadership in a futile attempt to undermine the Social Democrats, socialist trade unions, and middle-class democrats, on the theory that the Nazi regime would only be temporary and would bring the collapse of capitalism.[49]\n\nHitler in power\n\nThe first order of business after taking power was the elimination of all political and intellectual challenges and alternatives to the Nazi order.\n\nOn January 30, 1933, Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. He and his Nazi allies moved quickly to dismantle democracy and establish an authoritarian state. On February 27, the Reichstag was mysteriously burned down, allegedly by a young Dutch communist, Marinus Van Der Lubbe.[50] The following day, the government declared a state of emergency accompanied by a suspension of political rights. An election was nonetheless held on March 5 in which the Nazi party secured 43.9% of the vote, or 288 of 647 seats.\n\nStill lacking a majority, Hitler proposed the Enabling Law to the Reichstag, allowing him to rule by decree – in effect, abolishing democracy. The bill needed two-thirds approval of the Reichstag to pass. By banning the German Communist party and terrorizing other parties – including raiding the offices of the Social Democratic Party, attacking their supporters, and closing down or destroying opposition newspapers – the Nazis gained the requisite approval of the measure in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94 on March 24.[51] The dictatorship was legally established.\n\nTwo days earlier, the Nazis opened a concentration camp for political prisoners at Dachau, located on the outskirts of Munich in what had once been a pleasant artist colony. The initial targets were not Jews per se, but rather communists, socialists, trade unionists, and intellectuals – any journalist, editor, judge, lawyer, professor, writer, minister or priest who dared criticize Nazi policies or ideas. Those imprisoned had no legal recourse and were exploited as forced laborers. A saying began to circulate around the country, in whispers: “Lieber Herr Gott, mach mich stumm, Das ich nicht nach Dachau komm'” (“Dear God, make me dumb [mute], That I may not to Dachau come.”) Dachau became the model for other concentration camps.[52] The first order of business after taking power, in other words, was the elimination of all political and intellectual challenges and alternatives to the Nazi order.\n\nTo this end, Nazi-led student groups initiated the first mass book burning event on May 10, 1933. Bonfires were lit in thirty-four university towns and cities, fed by works of prominent Jewish, liberal, and leftist writers. By the end of the summer, the Nazi regime had banned freedom of the press, outlawed other political parties and demonstrations against the government, imprisoned an estimated 100,000 Germans, and murdered some five to six hundred. The regime had also outlawed independent trade unions and replaced them with Nazi-led labor unions, banned strikes, arrested thousands of union leaders, and confiscated union assets, estimated in value at over 184 million Reichsmarks.[53] Key agents of Nazi repression were the German State Secret Police (Geheime Staatspolizei), also known as the SA or Gestapo, established by Hermann Göring, and the elite Special Forces (Schutzstaffel), or SS, commanded by Heinrich Himmler. The latter were recruited from German high society and screened to assure they were of pure Aryan stock and married to fellow Aryans.[54]\n\nMany German business elites supported Hitler because of his attacks on organized labor and the political left. Hitler’s financial backers included the Beckstein family, the Wagner circle, steel magnate Fritz Thyssen, wealthy Russian emigres, and other assorted aristocrats whose support, often in hard currency, subsidized Nazi party members’ subscriptions and entrance fees to party meetings.[55] This support paid dividends in the first five years of Nazi rule, as profits earned by German industry climbed from 6.6 to 15 billion Reichsmarks, or by 127 percent, according to historian Charles Bettleheim. Anti-fascist resistance fighter Otto Jensen wrote that Germany’s industrialists and bankers were very happy that “the fear of the concentration camp had made German workers as docile as lapdogs.” Another factor was Hitler’s large scale rearmament program, which bolstered the profits of Krupp and IG Farben by 300 and 600 percent, respectively, between 1933 and 1938.[56]\n\nHowever odious the Hitler regime, its national economic program was effective in pulling Germany out of the Great Depression, ending the unemployment crisis in five years, though average workers’ wages remained relatively low. Providing job security for the masses, in turn, generated public support for the party. The Nazis furthermore enticed the German people by promoting “the people’s community” (Volksgemeinschaft), which included folk festivals and parades organized in cities, towns, and villages across Germany. Along with folk culture, Nazi officials appropriated high German culture, paying respect to artistic expressions – art, dance, theater, music – shorn of all Jewish contributions. Long-term indoctrination was accomplished in part by Hitler Youth groups which boys and girls ten years and older were required to join. The program mixed ideological instruction, nationalistic rituals, vigorous outdoor exercise, and social camaraderie. For boys, regular military drills prepared them for service in the Wehrmacht (army) at age eighteen.\n\nNazi leaders employed a combination of brute force and sophisticated propaganda techniques to generate unquestioned loyalty to the state, party, and leader. Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer (one people, one realm, one leader) became the motto of Nazi Germany after Hitler was anointed the Führer. This was precipitated by the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in August 1934 and the merging of the presidency and chancellorship under Hitler.\n\nHitler appointed Joseph Goebbels to lead the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. With a doctorate in Philology from the University of Heidelberg in 1921, Goebbels studied Woodrow Wilson’s propaganda techniques in the First World War that had effectively demonized Germans as barbaric “Huns.” He was impressed with Edward Bernay’s book, Propaganda (1928), which set forth the subtle means by which corporate and governmental elites could sway public opinion without the public catching on. Bernay’s career stretched from serving the Wilson administration’s wartime propaganda agency, the Committee on Public Information, to assisting the Eisenhower administration’s covert overthrow of the Guatemalan government in 1954.[57]\n\nGoebbels made ample use of film and radio, employing these relatively new communication vehicles to glorify Hitler and create a cult of personality. Goebbels’s Propaganda Ministry subsidized Leni Riefenstahl’s 1935 film, The Triumph of the Will, which famously depicted the Führer as a god-like figure commanding millions of devout and obedient followers in glorious displays of pageantry and power. The radio was used effectively to transmit Nazi messages. Radios were attached to street lamps at bus stops where listeners would congregate and hear music interspersed with Nazi “news.” The government also subsidized an affordable radio for average households to purchase – the Volksempfänger – which became extremely popular.[58]\n\nToward the Holocaust (1933-1942)\n\nThe Nazis put forth the idea of the “master race” as justification for both territorial aggrandizement – gaining more “living space” to the east – and subjecting Jews and other races to Nazi rule, if not death. The origins of the “master race” idea can be found in the imperial mindsets adopted by all of the major European powers and accompanying Social Darwinist theories that rationalized imperialism as natural and inevitable. A number of Nazi leaders or their fathers had played an important role in expanding Germany’s overseas empire in Africa, where the German colonizers developed and refined various population control measures that were later applied against the Jews and other subjugated peoples in the Nazi empire. These methods included the forced relocation of peoples into concentration camps, the ruthless exploitation of native labor, torture in interrogation, and medical experimentation.\n\nAnthropologist Eugen Fischer epitomized a continuity in personnel between Imperial Germany and the Third Reich. He had studied racially intermixed groups in Southwest Africa during the Herero War in modern day Namibia and provided the “scientific” underpinnings for Hitler’s 1935 Nuremburg laws discriminating against Jews and other undesirable groups. Believing that “racial inferiors” should legitimately be eliminated, Fischer used his experience in Africa to guide his training of Nazi luminaries such as Josef Mengele, the infamous death doctor who performed sadistic experiments on Jews at Auschwitz and other concentration camps.[59]\n\nThe focus on German Jews as the enemy of the German people required a significant reconstruction of reality. In 1933, there were 525,000 Jews living in Germany, less than one percent of the total population of 67 million.[60] Most were proud German citizens and more than 100,000 had served in the German army during World War I, with many decorated for bravery. German Jews held important positions in government, taught in German universities, and contributed to German culture as poets, writers, musicians, and artists. Of the thirty-eight Nobel Prizes won by German writers and scientists between 1905 and 1936, fourteen went to Jews. Although Jews encountered discrimination in their social and professional lives, most looked forward to a better life in Germany. Moreover, marriage between Jews and non-Jews was becoming more common.[61]\n\nBeyond Hitler’s ravings at the Jews, the anti-Jewish propaganda of the Nazi party was part of a political strategy designed to rally the great majority of Germans against a scapegoat, a perceived outsider, an enemy “other.” This strategy entailed reviving earlier eras of dehumanization and repression of Jews, an endemic feature of Christian civilization since the late Roman Empire stretching from England to Russia.[62] The Nazi regime, aided by a radical religious right movement, prodded and coerced German churches into adopting an anti-Jewish orientation. Before 1933, some Catholic bishops had prohibited their dioceses from supporting the Nazi party. This ban was dropped after Hitler declared in March 1933 that Christianity was the “foundation” for German values. Eight months later, a rally was held in Berlin in which some 20,000 supporters of the Nazi-dominated German Evangelical Church demanded the removal of the (Jewish) Old Testament from the Bible.[63]\n\nThe leadership of mainline Protestant and Catholic churches generally conformed to Nazi rule, but there were notable exceptions, including Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Bonhoeffer’s later efforts to help Jews escape from Germany and his connections to a plot to overthrow Hitler resulted in his execution in April 1945. Many Catholic priests aided Jews through underground organizations despite a warning in 1941 from Pope Pius XII to refrain from illegal actions and protests. Over 2,500 priests were imprisoned at Dachau, although not slated for execution.[64] Among them was Pastor Martin Niemoller, a former German U-boat commander who was imprisoned for opposing the Nazification of Protestant churches. He later expressed regret for his earlier antisemitic views in a famous passage:\n\nFirst they came for the communists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out – because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out – because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me – and there was no one left to speak out for me.[65]\n\nNazi repression of German Jews proceeded in stages. On April 1, 1933, in towns and cities across Germany, Nazi Storm Troopers stood menacingly in front of Jewish-owned shops while thuggish supporters painted the Star of David on shop windows and walls. Such identification was part of a campaign urging all Aryan Germans to boycott Jewish-owned businesses and professional services. That same month, Nazi state ministries relieved from duty all Jewish judges, public prosecutors, and district attorneys.\n\nIn September 1935, the government enacted the Nuremberg race laws, decreeing the segregation of Jews from German society. German lawyers who codified the Nazi government’s race-based philosophy found inspiration and examples in the well-established system of racial segregation in the American South.[66] Jews were forced to set up their own schools. Jewish school teachers and university professors were fired from their jobs. Jewish students were banished from universities. Jewish doctors were not allowed to treat non-Jews. Marriage between German gentiles and Jews was prohibited. Who exactly was a Jew? Jewish identity was legally defined not by religious beliefs or practices, but by presumed racial inheritance; thus, even people with Jewish grandparents who had converted to Christianity were considered Jews.\n\nIn 1937, the Nazi regime added a new category of “asocials” to its growing roster of political prisoners in concentration camps (which contained 4,761 prisoners at the end of 1936). This category included ex-convicts, alcoholics, drug addicts, people with mental disabilities, beggars, prostitutes, homosexuals, Roma and Sinti people (Gypsies), and pacifists – mainly Jehovah’s Witnesses. Jews constituted a small minority in the camps until 1942 when the camps were transformed into killing factories.[67]\n\nIn 1937 and 1938, the Nazi government set out to impoverish Jews by expropriating Jewish-owned businesses and selling them for a profit, a process known as Aryanization. In July 1938, Jews were ordered to carry identity cards with a special mark, thus making them easy targets for Nazi thugs. On November 9, the latter went on a rampage in Jewish sectors of cities across the nation, smashing store windows, burning synagogues, and assaulting Jews. Known as “The Night of Broken Glass,” or Kristallnacht, ninety-one Jews were murdered and 26,000 were arrested. Most were released over the next three months on the condition that they begin the process of emigration from Germany.[68]\n\nIn August 1939, the Nazi leadership decreed that all physicians, nurses, and midwives report any infants and children under the age of three who showed signs of severe mental or physical disabilities. Specially recruited medical staff murdered the infants and children by lethal overdoses of drugs or by starvation. This “euthanasia” program was later expanded to youths up to seventeen years of age.[69]\n\nGermany’s invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 – the opening salvo of the Second World War in Europe – exponentially expanded Nazi atrocities against Jews. Elite SS troops conducted mass executions of Jews across Eastern Europe, killing at least 7,000 by the end of the 1939. The mass murders accelerated over the next two years. In one of the largest, the SS summarily executed 33,000 Jews at the Babi Yar ravine near the city of Kiev, Ukraine, in September 1941. This was surpassed a month later by the massacre of 50,000 Jews at Odessa by German and Romanian units. Because some soldiers in these marauding death squads experienced nightmares and other forms of psychological distress, Nazi commanders began to look for a more efficient way to kill large numbers of Jews.[70]\n\nDuring the war, Jews in Germany and Poland and other Nazi-occupied countries were relocated to urban ghettos, confined and impoverished sections of cities where they had to wear a yellow star on their clothes. The ghettos were typically governed by Jewish Councils with the aid of Jewish police, under the command of the Nazis. Uncooperative Jewish leaders were executed and acts of rebellion were met with collective punishment; for example, shooting the family and friends of those who resisted or escaped.[71] The historian Dan Kurzman describes the misery of the ghetto in Warsaw, Poland:\n\n. . . skeletal figures with yellow swollen faces sat propped against the wall of buildings, their puffy, slit-like eyes vacant, their gnarled hands reaching out to indifferent pedestrians for bread. Others already dead, lay covered with old newspapers along their curbs, awaiting the gravediggers who would haul them off in handcarts to mass graves. Children crawled on all fours resembling blinking monkeys. . . . One woman even cannibalized her dead baby. And with starvation came typhus which filled the understaffed hospitals, people fated to die in filthy lice ridden hospital beds, often three or four to a mattress without medical care.[72]\n\nGovernment-subsidized films played an important role in disseminating antisemitism, the superiority of German military power, and the intrinsic evil of Germany’s enemies. Films such as The Eternal Jew (1940), directed by Fritz Hippler, portrayed Jews as subhuman creatures infiltrating Aryan society. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Goebbels’s propaganda ministry stressed themes linking Soviet Communism to European Jewry, presenting Germany as the defender of “Western culture” against the Judeo-Bolshevik threat, and painting an apocalyptic picture of what would happen if the Soviets won the war.[73]\n\nOn January 20, 1942, fifteen high-ranking Nazi leaders held a conference at an elegant villa outside Berlin called Wannsee. The conference was coordinated by former Gestapo chief and head of the Czech protectorate, Reinhard Heydrich, along with Adolf Eichmann who did much of the planning. Hitler himself did not attend. It is here that the Nazi leadership agreed on a plan for the “final solution,” a euphemism for the mass extermination of Jews across Europe. The plan entailed the liquidation of Jewish ghettos and the transport of residents in guarded trains to concentration camps in Germany, Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The public would be told that the Jews were being taken to special reservations of their own, much like Native American reservations in the United States. In reality they would be taken to death camps.\n\nUpon arrival, after their belongings were taken, they would be separated into two groups. Most Jews, including children, would be directed to gas chambers disguised as showers, where they would be killed by Zyklon B gas. The more fit young men and women would be sent to the work branch of the camp. Corpses from the gas chambers would be burned in crematorium furnaces. This gas chamber system had already proved successful at the Auschwitz concentration camp in southern Poland, where 600 Soviet prisoners-of-war and 250 others who were weak or ill were annihilated in a stroke in September 1941.[74]\n\nEichmann later recalled that the Wannsee conference was conducted “quietly and with much courtesy, with much friendliness – politely and nicely. There was not much speaking and it did not last a long time. The waiters served cognac, and in this way it ended.”[75] This description makes it sound like it was a pleasant business or academic conference when in fact the world’s worst genocide was being planned. The demeaner of the participants connotes a feigned attempt at respectability and psychological denial.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIII. Onset of war in Europe and Asia, 1933-1941\n\nThe Nazis identified their reign as the “Third Reich,” heir to the Holy Roman Empire (800-1806) and the German state empire (1871-1918) which collapsed at the end of the First World War. The primary Nazi foreign policy goal was lebensraum (more living space) to the east. The Slavic peoples of Eastern Europe and Russia were deemed inferior to Aryan Germans and thus “naturally” subject to German rule, according to Nazi racist ideology. Nazi leaders admired how Anglo Americans had conquered, removed, and deprived Native Americans of their lands, and how the British and French had imposed white rule across Africa and Asia.\n\nInternational diplomacy\n\nHitler’s diplomatic strategy was designed to keep Germany’s potential foes divided and off-balance while Germany built up its military power. The Nazis deftly encouraged Western isolation of the Soviet Union, applauded American neutrality, negotiated a separate naval arms control agreement with Great Britain apart from France, and pulled Italy into Germany’s orbit (Italy had fought with the Allies against Germany in the First World War).\n\nThough Hitler is often remembered for his fanatical speeches, he could adjust his tone and content to suit the occasion. To take one example, after Hitler announced in March 1935 that Germany was in the process of building an air force and would soon introduce conscription in order to create an army of some one-half million men, violating both the Versailles Treaty and the Locarno treaties of 1926, Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations all condemned these actions in no uncertain terms.[76] Recognizing that he had overplayed his hand in public, Hitler shifted gears and delivered an eloquent speech on behalf of peace on May 21. Eliciting memories of the Great War, he spoke of the stupidity of warfare and of the “dynastic egoism, political passion, and patriotic blindness” that caused wars. “If these states had applied merely a fraction of their sacrifices to wiser purposes,” he said, “the success would certainly have been greater and more permanent.” He falsely claimed that Germany had no intention of remilitarizing the Rhineland (an area between the Rhine River and France that had been declared a demilitarized zone in the Versailles Treaty) or of annexing Austria (also banned), and that he was willing to sign non-aggression pacts with all Germany’s neighbors.[77]\n\nHitler’s rhetoric of appeasement succeeded in eliciting actual policy appeasement on the part of Great Britain. On June 18, 1935, British and German diplomats in London signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, allowing Germany to build up its navy at a 35:100 ratio in relation to the size of the Royal Navy, only slightly smaller than the French navy. British officials reasoned that, as Hitler was going to build a navy irrespective of treaty obligations, it was better to establish some limits via a new international agreement – even though there was no guarantee that this agreement would be respected. The British signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement without consulting French, Italian, or Soviet leaders, which particularly offended the French. The British did consult U.S. leaders, who gave their tepid approval. Three days prior to the signing, Secretary of State Cordell Hull directed U.S. ambassador Robert Bingham in London to inform the British that the U.S. government appreciated with “particular satisfaction” Germany’s acceptance of a permanent, category by category naval tonnage ratio.\n\nThe treaty was a tremendous success for Hitler. It caused a rift between France and Britain, effectively annulled arms limitations imposed by earlier treaties, and allowed Germany to maximize its shipbuilding operations for a number of years until the ratio was reached. It enabled Germany to legally contract with U.S. corporations to supply the requisite materials for rearmament (see Section 4.2).[78]\n\nHitler’s most significant diplomatic triumph was to make an ally of Benito Mussolini. Though Italy and Germany had similar types of fascist governments, Western powers had relied on Mussolini to resist German expansionism and guarantee Austrian independence. Hitler successfully courted Mussolini, leading to the Rome-Berlin treaty of friendship in November 1936. A formal alliance, the so-called “pact of steel,” was signed in May 1939. The two fascist leaders found common cause in aiding Francisco Franco’s National Forces in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), resulting in the establishment of another fascist government in Europe. Despite signing pledges of non-intervention, Germany and Italy sent their warplanes to mercilessly bomb Spanish cities under Republican control, enabling Franco to defeat his democratic rivals.\n\nThe bombing of Guernica, the historic citadel of Basque culture, caught the attention of the world. The terror was symbolically captured by artist Pablo Picasso in a huge oil-on-canvas titled Guernica.[79] New York Times correspondent G. L. Steer reported, “The object of the bombardment seemingly was demoralization of the civilian population. . . . The whole of it was a horrible sight, flaming from end to end.” So many buildings collapsed that “the streets were long heaps of red, impenetrable ruins,” while farmhouses in the outskirts were “burned like little candles in the hills.” In the House of Lords, Lord Cecil of Chelwood declared, “There is no precedent in the history of civilized nations for anything like the bombing of Guernica.” In the House of Commons, Liberal leader Archibald Sinclair decried the bombing as “a deliberate effort to use air power as an instrument of terrorism.”[80] So it was. Yet only three years later, Britain adopted a similar policy of “area bombing” German cities.\n\nIn March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, breaking the Versailles Treaty once again. Shockingly to many Western observers, crowds in Vienna cheered the invading army as it marched through the streets, even as some soldiers forced Jews to scrub the pavement in front of them with toothbrushes. In order to create a façade of democratic legitimacy, the Nazi leadership arranged for a referendum on annexation to Germany (Anschluss) to be held on April 10. The proposed annexation was endorsed by Social Democratic Party leader Karl Renner and Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, the highest Catholic official in Austria. It passed by an incredulous 99.7 percent. Many communists took up resistance in the underground.[81]\n\nThe Anschluss was followed in September 1938 by Germany’s threat to invade and annex the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia, areas inhabited primarily by German speakers. Hitler justified this territorial quest in the name of self-determination and the protection of ethnic Germans from discrimination. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, hoping to avoid a general war, met with Hitler to work out a compromise, believing that the greater threat to Europe lay to the east in the communist Soviet Union. On September 13, he wrote to King George VI informing him that Nazi Germany and Great Britain were “the two pillars of European peace and buttresses against communism.”[82] Soviet premier Joseph Stalin was excluded from the meeting.\n\nAfter two weeks of negotiations in Munich, Hitler got what he wanted without war. On September 30, Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini, and French Prime Minister Eduard Daladier signed an agreement in which Germany was allowed to incorporate the Czech Sudetenland in exchange for a promise to pursue no further territorial claims. Czechoslovakian President Edvard Benes was forced to accept the dictum. Chamberlain, upon his return to London, proclaimed that he “helped achieve peace in our time.”[83]\n\nIn Washington, President Roosevelt was relieved that Europe would remain at peace. He sent a cable on October 11 to Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, rejoicing that “the world war had been averted.” Six days later, he sent a message to Ambassador William Phillips in Italy, “I want you to know that I am not one bit upset over the final result.”[84] The Munich conference was nevertheless a turning point for Roosevelt, as he realized that war in Europe was probable. Indeed, while negotiations were underway, Roosevelt discussed with his treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau, how Britain and France might defeat Nazi Germany. He did not foresee at that time any direct U.S. involvement in another European war, but he recognized that Britain and France would need U.S. aid.[85]\n\nThe disingenuousness of Hitler’s words at Munich – that he had “no more territorial demands to make in Europe” – became apparent less than six months later when German troops invaded and occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia, flagrantly violating the Munich pact. German leaders valued Czechoslovakia for its substantial industrial base, significant foreign exchange reserves, and strategic position as a launching pad for further expansion into Eastern Europe and Russia.[86]\n\nPrior to launching the next military campaign for lebensraum, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty of Nonaggression on August 23, 1939. Russia had interpreted the Munich agreement as a signal from the Western powers that the Nazis could drive to the east without being confronted. Four months earlier, Joseph E. Davies, former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, had sent a telegram to Roosevelt warning that if the Russians did not “get a practical reciprocal alliance with the West, it is clear as a pike staff they will do the next best thing and get a nonaggression pact with Hitler.” Roosevelt nonetheless waited until mid-July to tell Soviet Ambassador Constantin Oumansky that he favored an alliance between Moscow and London, notwithstanding the fact that London had not agreed to this. Roosevelt also instructed his ambassador to the Soviet Union, Laurence Steinhardt, to tell Premier Joseph Stalin “that if his Government joined up with Hitler, it was as certain that night followed day that as soon as Hitler had conquered France, he would turn on Russia, and that it would be the Soviets turn next.” This was prescient, but Roosevelt’s belated endorsement of an anti-German alliance came too late and offered too little.[87] In any case, Stalin was convinced, with considerable reason, that Britain and France would not back the Soviet Union in the event of a German invasion; hence his “appeasement” pact with Germany. [88] According to the British historian Jonathan Haslam:\n\nWhen from 1937 to 1939 the threat of yet another war appeared on the horizon, the lingering menace of revolution from Bolshevism explained in large part why Britain rejected co-operation with the Soviet Union to deter German aggression. The reasoning was simple . . . far [better to] buy off Hitler with timely territorial concessions, even at the cost of dismembering dependent states in Central and Eastern Europe, than risk ushering Communist power into the heart of the continent. Insufficiently understood is the undoubted fact that throughout the 1930s leading conservative politicians within the democracies not only welcomed fascism into power but thereafter also feared that, were fascism overthrown in Italy or Germany – and fascism was seen as only an interim solution – Communism would be almost certain to take its place.[89]\n\nFor the moment, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact mitigated the possibility of a German invasion of the Soviet Union. It furthermore allowed the Soviets to assert control over territories lost in the First World War (ceded in the Brest-Litovsk Treaty of 1918) and the Polish-Soviet War of 1918-1920. Stalin approved Germany’s designs on western Poland and Lithuania, while Hitler agreed to a Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, and Bessarabia (northeastern Romania).\n\nTwelve days before signing the treaty, Hitler told Carl Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner in the city of Danzig, Poland, “Everything I undertake is aimed at Russia. If the West is too stupid and too blind to grasp this, then I shall be forced to reach an understanding with the Russians to defeat the West and then, after its downfall, turn with all my concerted forces against the Soviet Union.” This statement was in keeping with Hitler’s overarching goal of acquiring “living space” in the east, especially as the Soviet Union was ruled by communists and harbored a large population of Jews.[90] An invasion of the Soviet Union would not be long in coming.\n\nOutbreak of war in Europe\n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop pact sealed the fate of the Poles. In the pre-dawn hours on September 1, 1939, Nazi troops began a massive invasion of Poland backed by a new war weapon, the Stuka dive bomber. The bombers screamed down in vertical dives with a wail that sent the Polish army’s horses into a frenzy. The German army overcame Polish resistance in five weeks. The fast and furious campaign provided a frightening omen of the carnage that awaited the rest of Europe. German losses totaled 16,000 killed, while the Poles suffered 70,000 killed and 130,000 were wounded. Special SS units followed behind the army, summarily executing political leaders and Jews, a practice they repeated across Eastern Europe. Poland in 1939 was home to more than 3.5 million Jews, seven times the number in Germany. The Nazis set up a network of concentration camps, the first at Chelmo in late 1941.[91]\n\nBritain and France refused to appease Hitler any longer. On September 3, 1939, two days after Germany invaded Poland, Neville Chamberlain announced that Britain was at war with Germany. French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier followed suit a few hours later. The Second World War in Europe had begun.\n\nSeventeen days after German troops invaded Poland from the west, Soviet troops invaded from the east. By the end of September, the Soviets and Germans had divided up Poland between themselves. The Soviet invasion included the infamous Katyn forest massacre, a series of mass executions of nearly 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia allegedly carried out by the Soviet secret police.[92] The Soviets also took over the parts of Romania and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, then invaded Finland on November 30, 1939. Finnish forces fought back under the leadership of aging Baron Karl Gustav von Mannerheim, a former tsarist officer and hero of the war of independence (against the Bolsheviks in 1917), who was in close and constant communication with the German high command.\n\nIn Washington, President Roosevelt denounced the Soviet invasion of Finland as “a wanton disregard for law.” Nonetheless, he could do little to help the Finns militarily, as he was bound by strict neutrality laws that prevented the transfer of U.S. arms and other war materials to belligerent nations, including those nations defending themselves from aggression. The administration managed to extend $10 million in agricultural credit to the Finns. The governments of Great Britain and France were bolder. Notwithstanding the looming threat of a German invasion of Western Europe, British and French leaders devised a plan to send 100,000 British and 35,000 French troops to aid the Finns. However, on the day that the plan was to go into effect, March 12, 1940, Soviet and Finnish representatives signed a peace treaty. The Finns were allowed to retain their sovereignty but lost slices of territory to the Soviets. Soviet forces suffered more than 300,000 casualties in the Soviet-Finnish Winter War and furthermore earned the enmity of their future allies.[93]\n\nGermany attacks the West\n\nIn the spring of 1940, German armies went on the march in Western Europe. On April 9 and 10, they invaded and occupied Denmark and Norway. In Norway, they installed as head of the Nazi-allied government Vidkun Quisling, the founder of Norway’s fascist party. His surname henceforth became synonymous with “collaborator” and “traitor.” Great Britain and France sent a combined force of 38,000 troops to aid the Norwegian resistance, but to no avail. On May 10, the Nazi juggernaut pushed into Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, then on to France. German bombers destroyed the historic city center of Rotterdam (Netherlands), killing nearly 900 people and leaving some 80,000 people homeless. In retaliation, the British Royal Air Force bombed German industrial areas in the Ruhr region.\n\nDuring the preceding eight months, Great Britain and France had built up their forces along the Belgian-French border. The latter were quickly overwhelmed by the German blitzkrieg (lightning war). On May 26, more than 338,000 soldiers, including 140,000 French, were rescued at the port of Dunkirk and brought across the English Channel. On June 13, with the German army approaching Paris, French Premier Paul Reynaud pleaded in vain for the United States to send “clouds of war planes” across the Atlantic “to crush the evil force that dominates Europe.”[94] Five days later, France surrendered.\n\nAn armistice was subsequently signed that divided France into a German-occupied zone in the north and west, and a French zone under German command in the south and east, known as Vichy France. The government of Vichy France was given charge of French forces and colonies, effectively making them serve Germany. Vichy leader Marshall Philippe Pétain, hero of World War I and a reactionary politician, avidly implemented all Nazi policies, including censorship and antisemitic laws. Following the war, he was tried and convicted of treason. Officials of both German-occupied France and Vichy France participated in the systematic deportation of Jews to concentration camps in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn Great Britain, Winston Churchill replaced Chamberlain as British prime minister on May 10, 1940. In a speech before the House of Commons three days later, Churchill promised that the British people would “never surrender.” He described German aggression as a “monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.”[95] Britain was nevertheless poorly prepared for a major war. Following the harrowing escape of British and French troops at Dunkirk, Churchill adopted a conservative war strategy aimed at limiting the exposure of British troops, blocking German supply lines on the high seas, and protecting the flanks of the British Empire. Italy declared war on Britain on June 10 and soon after, Mussolini’s armies attacked British-allied Egypt and Greece.\n\nAt home, Britons suffered eight months of German bomber attacks – the London Blitz – beginning in September 1940. The most devastating attack occurred on the night of November 14, when the German Luftwaffe bombed the English city of Coventry, destroying over 4,000 homes and two-thirds of the city’s buildings, including its major cathedral, and killing 580 residents. In other attacks on London, the Luftwaffe damaged Westminster Abbey, the House of Commons, the British museum, the Tower of London, and numerous hospitals, and ignited 2,200 fires. According to the historian Antony Beevor, German night bombing attacks killed some 23,000 civilians and seriously injured 32,000 by the end of the year.[96] The British Royal Air Force, in turn, bombed Berlin on August 25, 1940. Excessive loss of aircraft on both sides cut short the bombing campaigns in 1941.\n\nHitler, intoxicated with his military conquests in Western Europe, next sent his armies into southeastern Europe. In March 1941, German troops entered Yugoslavia en route to Greece where they defeated resistance groups that had previously held out against an Italian invasion. In Croatia (part of Yugoslavia), local Nazi supporters organized the fascist Ustaše movement which aided the German invasion and brutally attacked communists, Serbs, and Jews. A reign of terror was carried out by Croatian Interior Minister Andrija Artukovic who was known for his slogan: “If you can’t kill Serbs or Jews you are an enemy of the state.”[97]\n\nRacial genocide, as such, was not the sole province of Nazi Germany. The delusional logic of Nazi collaborators was reflected in statements by Romanian president Ion Antonescu, who, after sanctioning the machine-gunning of Jews, said: “It makes no difference to me that we will go down in history as barbarians. The Roman empire performed a series of acts of barbarism according to our present standards and nevertheless it was the most magnificent of political establishments. There has not existed a more favorable moment in our history.”[98]\n\nOperation Barbarossa: Germany’s war against Russia\n\nThe next victim of Nazi aggression was the Soviet Union. Abandoning the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, Hitler initiated Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941. He justified the invasion to the world by claiming that the Russians had massed 160 divisions on the German frontier. In fact, Stalin had refrained from mobilizing defense forces, recognizing that Russian mobilization in 1914 had led Germany to declare war on Russia.\n\nAs in Western Europa and the Balkans, the German war machine enjoyed initial success. The Wehrmacht overran the Soviet Ukraine and the Soviet satellites of Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia in a mere three weeks. Pro-Nazi puppet governments were set up in each region that systematically brutalized the civilian populations. In Estonia, roughly 3,000 Jews escaped to the Soviet Union before the SS and local collaborators murdered the remaining 1,000 by the end of 1941.[99] To aid its military and genocidal operations, the Nazis recruited anti-Soviet partisans, including anti-Russian ethnic minorities, Islamists, anticommunists, and some Finish veterans of the 1940-Soviet War. Many of these recruits were particularly brutal toward Russian civilians, especially girls and women – worse than the Germans.[100]\n\nPopular support in Germany for Hitler’s aggression was fueled by an intense Russophobia owing to the First World War combined with anti-bolshevist and antisemitic propaganda promoted by the Nazis.[101] Depicting the war as one of European civilization versus Asian-Jewish Bolshevism, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels stated that “by means of their diabolical system of Bolshevism, the Jews have cast the people of the Soviet Union into this unspeakable condition of deepest misery.”[102] The Nazi dehumanization of Russian Slavic peoples as Untermenschen (subhuman) and reference to Russia as a “Jewish-led slave state” fueled the atrocity producing environment. In August 1941, Hitler declared that the Russian is “no more than an animal.” He later described them to departing German troops as “beasts.” The SS journal, Das Schwarze Korps, referred to Germany’s eastern adversary as “Bolshevik herd people of animal gruesomeness” and “race-bastard types” who were not only subhuman but “sub-bestial.”[103]\n\nThe Nazis intended a genocidal war in which famine would deplete the Soviet population and survivors would be put to work as slave laborers.[104] Hitler told one of his army commanders that the war against Russia “could not be conducted in a knightly fashion” because the struggle was “one of ideologies and racial differences” and would “have to be conducted with unprecedented, unmerciful and unrelenting harshness.”[105] Prior to launching Barbarossa, Hitler issued a series of orders that included the infamous “Commissar Order” directing summary executions of Communist political functionaries captured, based on the claim that “these elements” constituted a threat to German security and were, in any event, “mostly Jewish.” It was made clear, too, that ordinary Soviet soldiers and civilians were to be treated with the utmost severity. “Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia,” issued by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Army Command), urged “ruthless and energetic measures” and “the radical elimination of all active or passive resistance.” Since the Russian was presumably “prepared to commit any vile act, be it murder or treachery,” the annihilation of such an enemy was presented as a moral and historical imperative.[106]\n\nMany of the German soldiers who partook in these atrocities had gotten caught up in the war fervor and were taken in by Nazi propaganda, having been brainwashed by Nazi ideology from the time of their youth. Wilhelm Alexander Fürst zu Dohna-Schlobitten, an officer in the Wehrmacht’s 60th Mechanized Infantry division, wrote years later, after rereading his wartime diary, that he was “shocked by my own callousness.” It seemed “impossible to understand that I could have allowed myself to have been caught up in this megalomania,” but, he reminded himself, “we were dominated by the feeling of being part of a tremendous war machine, which was rolling irresistibly to the East against Bolshevism.”[107]\n\nHitler’s supreme confidence that Germany would be victorious over the Soviets – what one German army officers characterized as a “pathological overestimation of his own strength” – was predicated on the aggregation of the largest invasion force ever seen, with 3,350 tanks, 7,000 field guns, and over 2,000 aircraft along with 650,000 horses. Hitler’s advisers also suggested that the German invasion would produce a political upheaval in Russia and result in the overthrow of Stalin by his own people. Confident that victory would be obtained before the winter set in, Hitler failed to provide his troops with proper winter gear.[108]\n\nOn July 3, 1941, eleven days after the Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, Marshall Stalin gave a national address in which he called for total popular mobilization such as that which had saved the French revolution in 1792. He reminded his audience that this was not an ordinary war, but a total war, a war of the “entire Soviet people, a choice between Soviet freedom or German slavery.”[109] Thousands of Russians answered the call to join volunteer militias and partisan guerrilla units, some of which were equipped with little more than pikes and swords. The working day was extended by three hours and national holidays were canceled.[110] The poet Alexey Surkov captured popular Russian feeling in “A Soldier’s Oath” which read: “The tears of women and children are boiling in my heart / Hitler the murderer and his hordes shall pay for these tears with their wolfish blood / for the avenger’s hatred knows no mercy.”[111]\n\nAfter fierce fighting in the First Battle of Smolensk (located east of Moscow), July 8-31, 1941, the German army chief-of-staff recognized that “everywhere the Russians fight to the last man. They capitulate only occasionally.”[112] Adept at concealment, Soviet troops hid in trees, marshes and undergrowth in grassland or swamps from which they could plot ambush attacks on patrolling German troops. Old men and women took up shovels and dug huge traps into the earth for German tanks to fall in, while young boys scattered glass on roads, mixed chemicals in recharging tank batteries and pushed potatoes up their exhaust pipes.[113] New York Times’ correspondent Ralph Parker remarked that “it would need a Tolstoy to describe the heroic endurance of the men and women [fighting the Nazis].”[114] According to the historian Richard Overy:\n\nThe actions around Smolensk showed both the strengths and the weaknesses of Soviet forces. Soldiers fought with an extraordinary ferocity and bravery. They inflicted casualties at a high rate and in the early battles often refused to take prisoners. Captured Germans were murdered and mutilated, sometimes ritually – Soviet troops had been told to expect no better from the enemy. . . . The savage fighting held up but could not halt the German armies. Soviet forces lacked basic military equipment [including rifles, radio communications, radar, tanks, aircraft, and fuel].[115]\n\nOn September 8, 1941, German divisions began a brutal, 880-day siege of Leningrad, located further to the north, blockading food and fuel supplies to this city of over three million people. Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) was the Soviet Union’s second-largest city, an important industrial and cultural center, being the former capital of the Russian Empire. The German command viewed Leningrad’s capture as a strategic objective, as it would allow the Wehrmacht to control of the entire Baltic coast. Hitler had called for the city “to be wiped from the earth.”\n\nThe siege, which lasted until January 27, 1944, resulted in the deaths of about 1.1 million civilians, mostly by starvation. Daily shelling and aerial bombing caused significant damage to the city, including its electrical and water supply systems, making survival tenuous. Overy describes daily life during the siege as “a story of horrors almost beyond imagining.” On Christmas day 1941, 3,700 people died. The death rate peaked at four to five thousand per day, with 632,253 civilians dying overall.[116] One survivor told a journalist that residents would “step over corpses in the street and on stairs! You simply stopped taking any notice.”[117]\n\nDuring the siege, more than 1,300,000 people were evacuated inland, to the Urals, Siberia, and Central Asia. Those remaining improvised by creating over 600 part-time farms and more than 100,000 individual gardens. The city’s central plazas and parks were turned into vegetable gardens.[118] Some food and fuel supplies also reached the city from the outside – by barge in the summer and by truck and ice-borne sled in the winter.\n\nThe first major defeat of the German army came in the Battle of Moscow, which took place between October 1941 and January 1942. Muscovites rallied under the command of General Georgy Zhukov to save their city from destruction. Incredibly, Leningrad’s starving workforce produced over 1,000 guns and mortars for Moscow’s defense, flown out of the city over German lines. Thousands of women and children helped in the digging of fortifications. In one instance, a small detachment of Red Army soldiers armed only with anti-tank rifles, grenades, and Molotov cocktails held at bay two dozen attacking German tanks. By late November, the power of the German assault on Moscow was visibly wilting, and the Red Army was subsequently able to take the offensive. Mother nature was an added factor, as during the winter fighting over 113,000 cases of frostbite in the German army weakened its fighting capability. On the day the Soviet counteroffensive began, December 5, 1941, the temperature was 13 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.[119]\n\nJapan’s war against China\n\nAs with Nazi Germany, Japanese aggression abroad was accompanied by an unseemly combination of authoritarianism, extreme nationalism, militarism, propaganda, and ideological indoctrination at home. One difference was that leadership worship in Japan centered on a mystical emperor who was rarely seen or heard in public, in contrast to Hitler’ ubiquitous presence in Germany. Although emperor worship was a long-enduring tradition in Japan, the emperor had not always wielded predominant power. For hundreds of years prior to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the power of the emperor was secondary to that of shogun rulers. Even when a new constitution in 1889 increased the power of the emperor, anointing him “head of the Empire” and giving him “supreme command of the Army and Navy,” it also established a bicameral national legislature, the Diet, providing an institutional check on the emperor’s powers and prerogatives. The Taisho Democracy period from 1918 to 1931 marked a time of democratic reform, with suffrage extended to all males over 25.\n\nDemocratic advances notwithstanding, Japanese nationalism, militarism, and imperialism rose to the fore during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ironically, it was the U.S. Navy that broke the spell of Japanese isolationism in 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry took a squadron of warships into Tokyo Bay and forced Japan to open two of its ports to U.S. commerce. Unwilling to follow the rest of Asia into colonial submission, Japan began to build its military might and establish its own sphere of influence, fighting successful wars against China (1894-95) and Russia (1904-05), and taking control of the Korean Peninsula in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\nIn the early 1930s, a time of global economic depression, ultranationalist paramilitary groups such as the Black Dragon Society pushed to create an authoritarian system under the emperor’s nominal leadership. On May 15, 1932, a group of naval officers and army cadets assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in broad daylight. In short order, a cabal of militarists gained control of the government, replacing democracy with national worship of the emperor.[120] Men undergoing military training were indoctrinated to believe that Japan was the natural leader of East Asia, that it wars were righteous, and that to die for nation was the highest honor. Such beliefs, wrote Azumo Shiro, a Japanese soldier who witnessed atrocities at Nanking, “led us to look down on the enemy and eventually to support the mass murder and ill treatment of the captives.”[121]\n\nJapan’s foreign policy goals were embedded in its mission to create a so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that would expand its sphere of influence, secure access to vital natural resources and economic markets, and facilitate the growth and spread of the Japanese population – the Japanese equivalent to Nazi lebensraum. Japan was surrounded by British, French, Dutch, and American colonies; it lacked natural resources such as oil and was vulnerable to food shortages; and its 73 million people, about five percent of the world’s population, was densely packed into an area smaller than California. In 1931, Japan invaded and took control of Manchuria (north of the Korea peninsula), followed by the introduction of troops into central China.\n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese war began in July 1937, catalyzed by a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese troops at the Marco Polo bridge in Beijing. Japanese forces quickly captured key Chinese ports and industrial cities. The tragic effects of the Japanese shelling of the city of Shanghai were captured by Hearst Corporation photographer H. S. “Newsreel” Wong in a black-and-white photograph of a Chinese child sitting, crying amid the rubble of the Shanghai railway station, his dead mother nearby. Taken on August 28, 1937, the photo appeared in newspapers around the world.[122] The Japanese fought two armies, the Nationalist Chinese army (Kuomintang, or KMT) under Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) and the Communist Chinese army under Mao Zedong. Neither made much progress against the Japanese, in part because both were biding their time to fight it out with each other.\n\nOf all the theaters of war, the Japanese war in China was perhaps the most atrocity-filled. According to the historian Mark Selden:\n\nJapan’s China war produced notable cases of atrocities that, then and later, captured world attention. They included the Nanking Massacre, the bombings of Shanghai, Nanking, Hankou, Chongqing and other cities, the enslavement of the comfort women, and the vivisection experiments and biowarfare bombs of Unit 731. Less noted then and since were the systematic barbarities perpetrated against resistant villagers, though this produced the largest number of the estimated ten to thirty million Chinese who lost their lives in the war, a number that far surpasses the half million or more Japanese noncombatants who died at the hands of US bombing, and may have exceeded Soviet losses to Nazi invasion conventionally estimated at 20 million lives.[123]\n\n“Scorched earth” tactics, massacres, and atrocities were all too common in the war in Asia. The most infamous prolonged atrocity, the “Rape of Nanking,” began after the Japanese took over the city on December 13, 1937. For the next six weeks, Japanese soldiers carried out house-to-house searches for Chinese soldiers. According to one eyewitness account presented at the postwar International Military Tribunal for the Far East (war crimes trial), Japanese soldiers went about murdering, raping, looting, and burning. Many of the soldiers were drunk. They killed men, women, and children “without apparent provocation or excuse until in places the streets and alleys were littered with the bodies of their victims. . . . Groups of Chinese civilians were formed, bound with their hands behind their backs, and marched outside the walls of the city where they were killed in groups by machine gun fire and with bayonets. More than 20,000 Chinese men of military age are known to have died in this fashion.” The tribunal estimated that Japanese soldiers raped 20,000 women, including young girls, in the first four weeks, and murdered more than 200,000 civilians, including 30,000 prisoners of war (POWs), in the first six weeks.[124] Some Japanese soldiers even set up killing competitions, including one in which two Japanese sub-Lieutenants, Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Takeshi, raced to see who could kill one hundred Chinese men first with their swords.[125]\n\nTwenty-seven Western correspondents, including five American and British journalists, remained in the city of Nanking to witness the carnage.[126] Unharmed by the Japanese, they sent out news reports that reached a global audience. Japanese military correspondents were also on hand. One observed that he had “seen piled up bodies in the Great earthquake in Tokyo, but nothing can be compared to this.”[127]\n\nSuch slaughters were typically framed in the Japanese press as unfortunate side effects of a noble war effort and far less heinous than those of their enemies. “The Chinese,” notes John Dower, “were reported to roast their captives and cut out their hearts. Young American men, it was said, qualified for the Marine Corps by murdering their parents, and routinely raped and killed women in Asia (this was one of the rumors behind the mass suicides by Japanese civilians on Saipan and Okinawa).” Dower adds, “To the majority of Japanese, as to the Anglo-Americans, atrocities committed by one’s own side were episodic, while the enemy’s brutal acts were systematic and revealed a fundamentally perverse national character.”[128]\n\n* * * * *\n\nIV. U.S. foreign policy in the interwar years\n\n4.1 Diplomatic appeasement of fascist states\n\n4.2 Corporate America and the Nazis\n\n4.3 Responses to Jewish repression in Germany\n\n4.4 Internationalism and isolationism\n\n4.5 The road to war\n\nWestern appeasement of Hitler is typically associated with the single event of the Munich conference in September 1938. This was certainly the most dramatic example, but the policy of appeasement toward fascist states actually extended from the early 1920s until March 1939. The first three parts of Section IV examine three dimensions of the U.S. appeasement policy: diplomatic conciliation, U.S. corporate operations in Nazi Germany, and American responses to Nazi repression of Jews. The interwar period also witnessed global efforts to reform the international system, on the one hand restraining imperialism, and on the other hand building international institutions, law, and collective security operations. American citizens and their government were ambivalent about these developments.\n\nIt is argued here that the U.S. took a wrong turn in appeasing Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, in allowing U.S. corporations to help build the Nazi war machine, and in failing to assist emigrating Jews; furthermore, that the U.S. should have participated in the League of Nations and its collective security efforts to rein in aggression. Whether such changes in policy would have prevented another world war (which arose from multiple causes in both Europe and Asia) is, of course, conjecture. But suffice it to say, there were alternative courses of action available.\n\n4.1 Diplomatic appeasement of fascist states\n\nAppeasement, meaning conciliation and compromise, is one side of the coin in international diplomacy. The other side is confrontation and isolation (shunning). From 1922, when Benito Mussolini came to power in Italy, until March 1939, when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, U.S. policymakers operated under the assumption that appeasement of fascist states was the best strategy to maintain peace and stability in Europe. This policy was motivated in large part by geopolitical calculations in which fascist governments were regarded as potential allies against Soviet-style communism. Although fascism subverted democracy, it was compatible with capitalism, whereas communism was deemed a threat to Western economies. As Jonathan Haslam writes, “Thus, instead of worrying about fascism, the British elite worried more about what would likely replace it – Communism – were fascism to be destabilized and overthrown. Silent complicity, as witnessed during the Spanish Civil War, can thus be observed among those who would not have advocated openly an alignment with fascist states.”[129]\n\nThe Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in November 1917 so rattled Western leaders that the British, French, and U.S. governments all sent expeditionary forces to overthrow it in its infancy – unsuccessfully, as it turned out. In 1933, the U.S. extended diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union, but many U.S. diplomats in the State Department remained hostile. According to David Schmitz:\n\n(B)y the 1930s most of the members of the State Department in charge of European diplomacy were career Foreign Service officers who shared an outlook on the world centered around the dangers of communism. All studies of the U.S. Foreign Service at this time draw a similar composite portrait of these men. White, Protestant, and middle-class or wealthy men primarily educated in elite schools, they held a patrician’s disdain for labor, minorities, and immigrants and a deep-seated fear of radical change. Most came to the Foreign Service around the same time of World War I and adopted the prevalent hostility toward the Soviet Union and belief that any political upheavals were communist-inspired. . . . The rising challenge of Nazi Germany was, for most of the decade, seen by these men as a secondary threat to that of communism.”[130]\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Italy, Breckinridge Long, was clearly of this view. In a letter to President Roosevelt in April 1935 concerning Germany’s growing military power, Long wrote, “There are only two governments in Europe capable of being a real victor. . . . [One is] Germany, and the other is Russia. . . . I shudder to think of a Russian domination of Europe. While a German domination would be hard and cruel – at least in the beginning – it would be an intensification of a culture which is more akin to ours than would that of Russia. Further than that, if Germany should be dominant throughout the greater part of Europe, she would act as a bulwark against the western progress of Russia.”[131]\n\nNotwithstanding America’s identification with principles of freedom and democracy, U.S. foreign policy has long functioned according to a different set of operational guidelines, reflecting geopolitical interests. The U.S. not only supported but also imposed dictatorial regimes on various “banana republics” in the Central America-Caribbean region. In Europe, the U.S. and Great Britain fully embraced the Greek government of General Ioannis Metaxas after he suspended the constitution and instituted a dictatorship in August 1936, citing the threat of communism. In 1938, U.S. ambassador to Greece Lincoln MacVeagh wrote to Roosevelt, “Mr. Metaxas is quite the best man in Greek political life today.”[132]\n\nIn addition to antipathy toward communism and leftist movements in general, two other factors influenced the U.S. appeasement policy. One was the U.S. tendency to follow the British lead in European matters, which led the way in appeasing fascism. The other was a belief that trade liberalization, rightly calibrated, could secure peace and stability in Europe.\n\nWithin the Roosevelt administration, Secretary of State Cordell Hull was the foremost advocate of economic appeasement. “It is because I know that without expansion of international trade, based upon fair dealing and equal treatment for all, there can be no stability and security either within or among nations,” he said in a speech delivered November 1, 1938. “It is because I know that the withdrawal by a nation from orderly trade relations with the rest of the world inevitably leads to regimentation of all phases of national life, to the suppression of human rights, and all too frequently to preparations for war and a provocative attitude toward other nations.”[133] Hull, as such, posited as the answer to both repression within and aggression without a well-balanced international trade system, glossing over the deleterious and inhumane effects of fascist governments and the instability and inequities of the global capitalist profit-making system.[134] “The American pursuit of appeasement,” writes David Schmitz, “was a well-developed policy that appeared to preserve U.S. interests while offering the prospect of a genuine peace.”[135]\n\nSome members of the U.S. diplomatic corps pushed in the opposite direction. Most prescient was George Messersmith. He had been in the Foreign Service since 1914 and served as the consul general in Berlin from 1930 to April 1934 before becoming minister to Austria. In March 1934, he strongly advised that the U.S. not renew the major U.S. trade agreement with Germany, the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights, ratified in 1925, which was due to expire in 1935. Messersmith argued that the treaty would only spur German rearmament. He judged that “the Germans have nothing to offer and we have nothing to gain but much to lose.” He pointed out that the long-range “mail planes” recently purchased by Germany were “easily convertible to bombers.” Contrary to Secretary Hull’s benefic view of international trade, he wrote in May 1934 that “a government with really peaceable intentions does not produce armaments, train its people in military exercises, and create such an extraordinary spirit in the schools, even among the very young.” Rather than build up the Germany economy, Messersmith hoped that economic instability would bring down the Hitler regime.[136]\n\nDisregarding Messersmith’s pleas, a special State Department committee recommended approval of the trade treaty, noting that trade warfare would mean the loss of nearly one billion dollars in American investments. The U.S. and Germany renewed"
