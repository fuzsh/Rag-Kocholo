        "text": "My research question is whether the relationships between Hitler and his team had an impact of the success of the Nazi Party. There are several related questions which stem from this, but first I will establish my argument. Hitler was pragmatic, because he used the individuals in his team strategically to further his power and that of the Party. This is not to say that the men were simply following orders, which is a common conception. The team did have autonomy, and the freedom to make decisions concerning policies. Some of the men were so devout to Hitler they refused to go against his word, whereas others were more concerned with their own personal gain than that of the Party. Therefore, the relationships between Hitler and his team did affect the success of the Nazi Party. Some other questions which stemmed from my initial research will be addressed in the main body of this essay."
