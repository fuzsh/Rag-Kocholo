        "text": "Incredibly subtle and detailed work\n\nI honestly didn't like this one at the beginning, it seemed a little dry and scholarly. The early chapters are on the historical details that led up to the Reich. But as it goes on, it becomes fascinating. It delves into the real nuances of the power struggles and motivations of all the parties involved, I've read other WW2 books and they mostly deal with the events. This one analyzes the why things happened, in enlightening detail - many things I never thought about. I went from mildly interested at the beginning to fascinated a few hours in.\n\nI wasn't crazy about the narrator at first, either. Thought maybe he was a little \"sleepy\" and laid back, but I changed my mind there as well. It's not a dramatic piece, kind of a 'sleeper' that builds in complexity as it goes along, and Page ends up being a great narrator for that kind of thing. You'll have to stop it at times and really think about what's being said.\n\nIt's not a beach read, or your first intro to WW2. You'll need to know a good bit about WW2 or you'll be completely lost. Start with Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Maybe listen to it twice. If you're still interested, give this one a try.\n\nWell presented history of WW II\n\nWell presented history of Hitler during WW II. My mother’s brother served and did not return alive. I thought this was well presented.\n\nPage Turning Scholarship\n\nThis is a great book. Most people interested in Nazi history have read books on WWII and on the Holocaust, but this is about Hitler’s short lived empire and how is was run by his Nazis. I especially enjoyed Mazower’s contemptuous irony. There were a few moments where I actually laughed out loud at the idiocy of Hitler and his goons. This is not a book to be picked up for laughs though. But this is a fine blend of outstanding scholarship and fine writing.\n\nLike taking a graduate course!\n\nThis book is sometimes overwhelming in the amount of data presented. I got depressed listening to the war atrocities paraded in a seemingly unending march.\n\nThe data on logistics was truly awe inspiring.\n\nI was left feeling I had been through a most painful experience, but at the same time sadly more wise for learning the human cost Hitler imposed on all humanity.\n\nWWII geeks will enjoy it\n\nWow. A lot of info to soak up and it was tedious at times but for a WWII-obssessed freak like me, it was enthralling. We all know Hitler, his hate, his delusions of grandeur...and how Nazi Germany came to reflect him as a person. This book touched on him only in association with all the moving parts of his inner circle, the SS, and German psyche, culture, and history in the eyes of those who lived and died under the Third Reich.\n\nAccurate but Depressing\n\nOne of the most depressing books I have read\n\nthe HUGE numbers murdered by yhe Nazis are undoubtedly accurate, but the numbers are simply mind numbing after a while"
