Interpretation 1: From Hitler’s Thirty Days to Power by H A Turner, published in 1996. In January 1933, Hitler did not seize power; it was handed to him by the men who controlled Germany. The Nazi Party had suffered huge losses in the Reichstag elections of November 1932 and it was starting to fall apart by January 1933. Hindenburg began to mistrust Chancellor von Schleicher. Meanwhile, von Papen managed to overcome the elderly President Hindenburg’s doubts about Hitler and persuaded him to appoint Hitler as Chancellor. Hitler was supported by less than half the German population when he was appointed Chancellor by President Hindenburg. Interpretation 2: From Hitler by I Kershaw, published in 1991. It was an extraordinary achievement by the Nazis to win the votes of a third of the German people between 1929 and 1932. By 1932, Hitler was in charge of a massive movement of 800,000 Party members and 13 million voters were generally prepared to place their trust in him. Nazi propaganda suggested that victory was inevitable. Mass support gave Hitler a key to unlocking the door to power. No other party leader had anything like Hitler’s support from the German population. (d) How far do you agree with Interpretation 2 about the reasons why Hitler became Chancellor in 1933?
