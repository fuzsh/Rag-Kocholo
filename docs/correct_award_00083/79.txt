The Nobel Prize in Literature 1927 was awarded to Henri Bergson "in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented"

Henri Bergson received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1928. During the selection process in 1927, the Nobel Committee for Literature decided that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied. Henri Bergson therefore received his Nobel Prize for 1927 one year later, in 1928.
