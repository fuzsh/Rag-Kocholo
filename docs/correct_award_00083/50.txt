The 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the French philosopher Henri Bergson (1859â€“1941) "in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented."[1] He was the second philosopher to gain the Nobel Prize after Rudolf Christoph Eucken won in 1908.
