        "text": "“The editors of and contributors to this volume make a good case that researchers interested in questions of the history of Continental political and religious thought may benefit from a close look at the work of Bergson. Recommended.” — R.C. Robinson, Choice\n\n“The introduction by the editors is excellent and the essays are of a uniformly high quality, with several taking 'Bergsonian' thought into new territory. Both Bergson scholars and those new to his work will find much here that will stimulate thinking.“ — Keith Robinson, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews\n\n“Those new to Bergson will ?nd ?rst-rate introductions, written by leading scholars, to Bergson’s relation to the humanities and social sciences. Those already initiated into Bergson scholarship will ?nd their thought ignited anew as these expert voices advance a dimension of Bergson’s thought overlooked in these salad days of Bergson studies.” — Michael R. Kelly, French Studies"
