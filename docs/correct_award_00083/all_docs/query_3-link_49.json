        "text": "Bergson, Henri\n\nCreative Evolution\n\nNew York: Henry Holt and Company, 1911. First English language edition. Hardcover. 8vo. [6], v-xv, 407, [3] pp. Blue cloth with gilt rules and lettering on the spine. Lacks the dust jacket. Translated and with an introduction by Arthur Mitchell. Gunter 133; 43. Bergson was an influential figure in early 20th-century philosophy and he and American philosopher William James were mutual admirers. James provided assistance to Mitchell in preparing this book for publication and intended to write a preface introducing the book to English readers; unfortunately, James' death in 1910 prevented him from fulfilling this intention. Creative Evolution is regarded as one of Bergson's three principal works (along with Time and Free Will and Matter and Memory), and was the first of his books to be translated into English. Bergson won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927 \"in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented.\" An attractive copy. Very Good+. Item #000011592\n\nVery Good or better with light wear to the textblock and the edges of the boards."
