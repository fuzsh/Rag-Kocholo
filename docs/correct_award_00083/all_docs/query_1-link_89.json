        "text": "Indeed, his use of the élan vital has served as grounds to dismiss him as the defender of an obscure mystical life force. Recently, however, a handful of scholars have taken it upon themselves to rectify these misconceptions and bring the twenty-first century up to speed with what is truly original and relevant about Bergson’s philosophical theory of evolution. Landes’s new English translation offers a valuable and timely contribution to this Bergsonian revival.\n\nAn updated translation of Bergson’s most significant and most misunderstood book was long overdue. Although the first English version of Creative Evolution, completed in 1911 by a Harvard postgraduate student called Arthur Mitchell, was carefully supervised, and approved by Bergson himself, most Bergson scholars and enthusiasts have since agreed it falls short on several fronts. […]\n\nThere is no doubt that this new translation will become an absolute reference, not least because Landes has included illuminating passages from the critical apparatus of the most recent French edition of L’Evolution créatrice. But Landes’s most remarkable improvement is in his recreation of the effortless flow of Bergson’s philosophical prose. Often described as “poetic” by both his admirers and critics (or as “miraculous” by William James), Bergson’s writing earned him a Nobel Prize in literature in 1927. But beyond mere aesthetic sensibility, his written style played a role in his philosophical method. A world away from the formal investigations to which today’s anglophone descendants of Russell’s “analytic” tradition are accustomed, Bergson preferred fluid, imaged language over rigid concepts. He believed that beneath the static symbols of logic, science and even everyday language, philosophical intuition could reveal the true nature of reality and the continuous change at work in the universe. Any translator of Bergson must therefore take on the uncomfortable and paradoxical task of employing language to bend it beyond its own limitations.\n\nAnother of Landes’s improvements on the 1911 translation is his decision to leave a handful of Bergson’s key notions in the original French, in particular his most controversial one: the élan vital. This was one of several images that Bergson used to represent the evolution of life, which he also compared to a “current” or to “a shell that immediately exploded into fragments. And each of these fragments, being itself a kind of shell, in turn exploded into fragments destined to explode again, and so on for a very long time”. But of all these images the élan vital was, according to Bergson, the one that best represented his philosophical picture of life. In French the expression “prendre son élan” might be used to describe an athlete gathering momentum before a long jump. In a more figurative sense a new élan can be breathed into a dwindling project to inject hope, energy and a sense of direction into it. The word élan also ties into the language of our most intimate emotional impulses. An élan of love is an uncontrollable surge of warm or romantic feelings; an élan of generosity is a spontaneous overflowing of often collective solidarity; an élan of rage might explain sudden, uncharacteristic acts of violence. All of these meanings are implicitly contained in Bergson’s deceptively simple image and converge, pointing the reader towards a picture of evolution as an open-ended surge of creativity thrusting itself towards more and more complex solutions to the obstacles its environment presents. The élan vital is the original impulse of life traversing all the branching diversity of evolution, following no preconceived plan, but always drawn towards more freedom. As Landes notes in his introduction, Bergson’s “argument relies upon all of these various connotations remaining active” in the reader’s mind. In Mitchell’s 110-year-old translation, however, the élan vital, as a “vital impetus”, remains tethered to its physical connotation, losing most of its evocative power.\n\nBergson published Creative Evolution during the period that Julian Huxley later called “the eclipse of Darwinism”, when most scientists believed in the fact of evolution, but none seemed to be able to agree on how it worked. In the first chapter of the book Bergson presents the image of the élan vital in opposition to the main theories of evolution of his day, including Darwin’s. In criticizing these theories he was not defending, as Russell and other critics have claimed, an anti-rationalist, anti-science ideology; nor did he aspire for his élan vital to rival biological theories as a mystical, murky pseudoscientific vital principle. Rather, Bergson wished to hold up a mirror to the limitations of scientific models. As he states (in Landes’s translation of the introduction):\n\nWe clearly sense that none of the categories of our thought … can be unequivocally applied to the things of life – who can say where individuality begins or ends, whether the living being is one or many, or whether the cells come together to form the organism or the organism divides up into cells? It is in vain that we force the living being into one or another of our frameworks. All of the frameworks crack. They are too narrow and, above all, too rigid for what we would like to fit into them.\n\nAs James had correctly predicted, it has taken a long time for Henri Bergson’s ideas to be properly digested and assimilated. Now, with the efforts of scholars such as Landes, it will become even more apparent that we still have a lot to learn from the author of Creative Evolution."
