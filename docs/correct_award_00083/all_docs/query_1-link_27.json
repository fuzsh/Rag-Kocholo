        "text": "In 1914, the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous Gifford Lectures, planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of eleven lectures, under the title of The Problem of Personality, at the University of Edinburgh in the spring of that year.​ The War then interrupted the lectures.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1859 of Jewish parents, Henri Bergson received his education there and subsequently taught at Angers and Clermont-Ferraud before returning to Paris. He was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the College de France in 1900 and elected a member of the French Academy in 1914. Bergson developed his philosophy by stressing the biological and evolutionary elements involved in thinking, reasoning and creating. He saw the vitalistic dimension of the human species as being of the greatest importance.\n\nBergson’s writings were acclaimed not only in France, but throughout the learned world. In 1927 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. In defiance of the Nazis after their conquest of France, Bergson insisted on wearing a yellow star to show his solidarity with other French Jews.\n\nShortly before his death in 1941, Bergson gave up all his positions and renounced his many honours in protest against the discrimination against Jews by the Nazis and the Vichy French regime.\n\nAccording to various typescript lists that accompany the Gifford Committee minute books, Bergson gave the Gifford Lecture in 1913, titled “Creative Evolution”. It would appear to have been published in 1911 (by Macmillan) so was not republished as a Gifford Lecture. He also seems to have delivered “The problems of personality” in 1914. First course delivered 21 Apr-21 May 1914, Second course not delivered.\n\nAccording to the minutes themselves,, Bergson was recommended at the meeting of 4 Dec 1911 to give lectures in 1913/14 and 1914/15. The next reference is in the minutes of the meeting of 23 Nov 1915 where it is recorded that a letter had been received from Bergson stating that he agreed the second series should be given in 1916 or later.\n\nSenate minutes add to the story:\n\n4 Feb 1915: Due to the special circumstances of the war, the second series was to be postponed until the Autumn of 1915/16\n\n4 Nov 1915: Further postponement at the request of Bergson, until May. Senatus actually decided to postpone until October, subject to Bergson’s approval.\n\n2 Dec 1915 It was reported that Bergson had agreed to postponement until October 1916 or even later, should that be required.\n\nThe minute book covers up to 1917 and there is no further reference to Bergson.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH\n\nGIFFORD LECTURES, 1914\n\nby\n\nprofessor Henri Bergson\n\n<>\n\nLecture I\n\nThe problem of personality may be regarded as the central problem of philosophy. This is so, not only on account of the interest which we have in knowing what we are – the question which is to be the special subject of this year’s course – and not only on account of the interest, perhaps still greater, which there would be in knowing what is our task in the world, whence we come, and whither we go – questions which we hope to deal with in next year’s course. It is so because all philosophical problems are found to converge upon this supreme problem, which appears thus as the centre round which all philosophy gravitates or ought to gravitate.\n\nThe principal aim of philosophy has always been, in short, to embrace in a single vision the totality of things: to philosophise has usually meant to unify. It is true that this unification may take place in two different fashions. The first, that practiced by the Greek philosophers, consists in reducing the indefinite multiplicity of individual things to a certain number of concepts, and these in turn to a single idea, which includes everything.\n\nThe second, which is the method of science and of modern philosophy, consists in establishing between things, or rather between facts, relations of reciprocal dependence, expressed by laws, and in supposing that, step by step, it is possible to reach laws more and more general until we arrive at a single principle to which everything can be reduced. In both cases alike, we end by representing the whole of reality to ourselves as a coherent system, which gives complete satisfaction to our understanding. For it is in perfect unity that the understanding finds rest.\n\nBut in both cases we are faced by the difficulty of finding a place for personality, that is to say, of admitting real individualities possessing an effective independence, each of which would constitute a little world in the bosom of the great world. That is why a philosophical doctrine, in proportion as it becomes more systematic, tends more and more to absorb the human person in the All.\n\nBut all the while that philosophy thus develops itself for the greatest satisfaction of our understanding, there is a dull protest on the part of the will. Time after time in the history of doctrines this protest is raised. It assumes dialectical forms: it calls itself skepticism, critical idealism, etc., but at the root of all these attacks directed against metaphysical dogmatism there is in reality a revolt of the will, which affirms its independence.\n\nNow, should not the future belong to a philosophy which seeks to reconcile with one another these two requirements, that of the will and that of the understanding? Common sense believes in the possibility of this reconciliation. And it is in accordance with the tradition of Scottish philosophy, as well as the tradition of French philosophy, to appeal to common sense.\n\nBut it would be a mistake to suppose that the reconciliation can be effected by concessions made by these two opposed theses to one another. This method, working simply with concepts, adds nothing to our knowledge of reality. We must interrogate reality directly; and, in order to do so, it is necessary to come to close quarters with the consciousness which we have of our own personality.\n\nLet us take a first glance at the “elements” of which it is composed, or rather of which it appears to be composed. In the first place, think of the consciousness which we have of our body with its organic sensations. Then there is memory with all the past. Then comes the anticipation of the future.\n\nBut none of this is the personality, although the personality has a certain relation to them all. What is this relation? That is the question which we shall ask ourselves in the first lectures of this course. But it is necessary, as we shall see, to examine first some of the most remarkable conceptions of personality that have been put forward by philosophers.\n\nLecture II\n\nIn the present lecture and in the two following we are going to take a glance at the history of the problem of personality, not exactly, however, in a historical interest. Our object in making this rapid examination is a double one. In the first place, there is the desire to utilize whatever true observation is to be found in the traditional doctrine of personality; in the second place and more particularly, there is the desire to inquire how this doctrine has involved itself in an impasse, and what is the explanation of the insurmountable difficulties in which it ends.\n\nThere is, as a matter of fact, a traditional doctrine on this point. It has changed its form, or rather its garment, throughout the ages, but it has remained the same; and indeed up to the present time it may be said that there has been but a single systematic philosophy of personality. This metaphysic was elaborated throughout the whole of Greek antiquity. It traversed the middle ages, and proceeded to super-impose itself, successfully or unsuccessfully, on modern knowledge, until the day when Kant showed on what conditions – conditions, as it seems to us, inadmissible – it could be reconciled with scientific mechanism.\n\nThe man who gave this metaphysic its finished form was Plotinus, a philosopher who has been too little appreciated. Continuator of Aristotle as well as of Plato, related also to the Stoics (although he combats them), Plotinus resumes in himself the whole of Greek philosophy. But as he is a powerful and original thinker, he has placed his own mark on the philosophy which he transmits to us. One must not forget, in short, that the Aristotelianism whose influence was predominant in the middle ages, and even (in spite of appearances) in modern times – this Aristotelianism which still penetrates our modes of thinking and of speaking – is an Aristotelianism entirely impregnated by Neo-Platonism, an Aristotelianism which Plotinus has fused so well with Platonism, that it is very difficult to disentangle in it what belongs to Plato, what belongs to Aristotle, and what belongs to Plotinus himself.\n\nIn remounting to the source of a doctrine, one finds it in its purest form; one understands it better, and, above all, one perceives the origin of the difficulties with which it was destine to come into collision in the course of its development. That is why it will be useful for us to give a short exposition of the doctrine of Plotinus. For the rest, more interest would have been felt in this doctrine if it had been seen that it is primarily a theory of personality. Of all the ancient philosophers, Plotinus was the only one who was really a psychologist. If his philosophy is a prolongation of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, it differs from them by the fact that it is the problem of the human soul that occupies the central position in it.\n\nNow, it is plain that the question which preoccupied Plotinus here – as it was later to preoccupy all writers upon the soul – is to know how the same being can appear to itself as an indefinite multiplicity of states and nevertheless be a single and identical person. This is the problem which we indicated at the close of our last lecture.\n\nThis problem we shall try to solve by asking if the multiplicity of states of mind is a multiplicity like other multiplicities, if the unity of the mind is a unity like other unities – if the very terms unity and multiplicity can still be applied here in their usual signification – in short, if there is not reason for proceeding in this case to revise our categories and to modify certain of our intellectual habits. But the intellect does not easily resolve to change its habits and reconstitute its categories.\n\nThe problem which presented itself to Plotinus, and which remained the problem of traditional philosophy, was therefore this: How can our person be on the one hand one or single, on the other hand multiple? And Plotinus indicated at once the solution which is inevitable, if one states the problem in these terms. He supposed that each of us was multiple “in our lower nature” and single “in our higher nature.” In other words, he considered a person as a being essentially one and indivisible, which by a kind of declension or excursion beyond itself runs down into indefinite multiplicity. Each of us, according to Plotinus, may experience these two states. In the second, we lean towards division, we materialize ourselves more and more; in the first, on the contrary, we become more spiritual and tend to a higher and higher unity. That is to say, the unity of the person tends to coincide with the unity of other persons, and the person to be one with God Himself.\n\nThere is implied, in short, in this conception of human personality, a whole metaphysics, which we find in Plotinus in its purity, and of which it is indispensable for us to give some account. That will form the subject of the next lecture.\n\nLecture III"
