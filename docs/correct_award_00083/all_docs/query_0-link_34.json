Laughter invites connection, forging a communal bond that strengthens social relationships and deepens our sense of belonging. Whether in a cozy gathering among friends or a crowded comedy club, the ripple of laughter signals our shared humanity and reminds us that humor truly comes alive in the presence of an echo.",
