        "text": "Description\n\nFrench philosopher (1859-1941) most influential during the first half of the 20th century, who regarded life not as something static but a matter of time and change; he was awarded the the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature 'in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented.' Scarce unsigned handwritten manuscript by Henri Bergson, entitled \"XI. Th√©ories de la Connaissance: La Certitude [Theories of Knowledge: Certainty],\" fifteen pages on adjoining sheets, 6 x 7.75, no date. Bergson pens an interesting, untranslated philosophical piece. In fine condition."
