Life

Henri Bergson was born in Paris. He was educated at the Lycée Condorcet and at the École Normale Supérieure, where he studied philosophy. After teaching at various schools, Bergson was appointed to the École Normale Supérieure in 1898, and between 1900 and 1921 held a chair of philosophy at the Collège de France. Between 1921 and 1926, he was president of the Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. Shortly before his death, Bergson expressed his opposition to the Vichy regime.

Work

Henri Bergson developed his philosophy in a number of books that have become famous not only for their fresh interpretation of life but also for their powerful use of metaphor, imagery, and analogy. In Time and Free Will (1889), Bergson offered an interpretation of consciousness as existing on two levels: the first reached through deep introspection and the second an external projection of the first. In Creative Evolution (1907), Bergson developed the theory of time introduced in his other works and applied it to the study of living things.
