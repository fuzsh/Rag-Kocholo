        "text": "CHAPTER 5\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT’S CASE AGAINST LEOPOLD\n\nIntroduction\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST LEOPOLD was argued by his opponents during July, 1945. It was not meant to discredit him on constitutional grounds but to destroy him politically. The constitutional question raised by the Government’s letter, dated November 3, 1943, and by the King’s Political Testament, written on January 25, 1944, had been settled essentially when Parliament approved the policy of the Government-in-Exile on September 19, 1944. Before that date, the behavior of the King was neither constitutional nor unconstitutional; it was simply ambiguous. Had the Constitution been clear or had the modifications of the Constitution brought about by political usage been universally accepted, the royal question would never have arisen. One cannot say without qualification that under a constitutional monarchy the sovereign has no discretion. This may be true in Great Britain, in Holland, in Scandinavia, but it was not true in Belgium before September, 1944. The action of Parliament at that time decided ex post facto that Leopold had acted unconstitutionally. Leopold, however, refused to accept this decision, and protected by Article 63 of the Constitution, resisted the demands for his abdication.\n\nBy July, 1945, the Government had reached its constitutional limits in the conflict with Leopold. The only alternative left to the Government to force the King’s submission to Parliament was political action that would establish his unfitness, or what the average Belgian would call his immorality. The Government’s attack was camouflaged with constitutional arguments, but this could not disguise its real purpose. The Government’s charge was simply this: King Leopold III had believed in a German victory and proceeded to act as if the war were over on May 28, 1940.\n\nLeopold’s defense, as will be shown in a later chapter, was a refutation of the charge—an item by item denial of the Government’s indictments, each of which had been designed to elaborate and spell out the details of the basic accusation. The type of defense chosen was unfortunate, but one which could not have been avoided. The weight of evidence shows that Leopold did not believe that Germany would be victorious, but he did not refuse to consider the possibility. He thought that Belgium should prepare for this contingency and he acted accordingly. Belgium was occupied by the Germans and might continue to be for many years.1 For Leopold the war was neither over nor continuing. This technicality seemed unimportant to him. What he knew was that no Belgian army continued to fight the Germans after May 28 and that his nation lay totally subjected to the occupant. Therefore, let the Government-in-Exile continue to say that Belgium was at war. If the Allies should be victorious, they could not say that Belgium had refused to fight. If, on the other hand, the Germans should win, they could not say that Leopold had been an active belligerent. In retrospect the King’s policy came disparagingly to be called attentisme (“wait and see” or “wait and profit”).\n\nLeopold did not arrive at this policy at once, nor did he do so with premeditation. Like the Government-in-Exile, the King, too, was confused in the months immediately following the fall of Belgium and the fall of France. From May 25 until June 2, 1940, it appeared that Leopold was going to form a government in occupied Belgium. It was the fear of this that prompted the statements made by the Government-in-Exile in Paris on May 28 and in Limoges on May 31, 1940. Yet Leopold did not do so. One cannot say why conclusively. As earlier chapters have shown, circumstances played an important role in his decision. As of June 2, 1940, it appeared that Leopold had accepted the fact that the war would continue; the meeting at Berne seemed to indicate this. But the summer of 1940 was chaotic for those who were entrusted with carrying on the war (the Government-in-Exile), and it was probably during these confused months of the Government’s indecisiveness that Leopold decided upon his policy of attentisme.2 His defense after 1945 would have been logical and consistent had it been geared to the defense of this policy, which could then have been justified as an alternative to the policy of the Government. But Leopold adopted a different kind of defense, one that maintained innocence in the face of the Government’s accusation of complicity. His defense appeared weak, however, because he had not in fact maintained an attitude of strict political non-involvement. In the minds of many Belgians, this weakness was synonymous with guilt.\n\nThe parliamentary attack against King Leopold was made by Prime Minister Achille Van Acker on July 20, and by Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak on July 24 and 25, 1945. Van Acker preferred the charges while Spaak created the climate of prejudice in which these charges could grow and mature. In the speech made on July 24, Spaak re-created the events between May 10 and May 31, 1940, and spoke of the apprehension of the ministers as they came to believe that Leopold would treat with the Germans and establish a government in occupied Belgium. He said that the charges made at Limoges on May 31, 1940, were perfectly reasonable considering the knowledge which the ministers had at that time. Spaak did not say, however, that the Government had made its peace with Leopold only three days later on June 2, and officially paid homage to him in the White Paper, published in London in 1941, entitled Belgium, the Official Account of What Happened, 1939–1940. In the light of past events, the speech painted an incorrect picture, but it succeeded in recharging the memories of duplicity and suspicion and in reinsinuating the allusion to treason.\n\nThe Charges\n\nThe charges concerned the following events or persons, all in turn related to the basic accusation that Leopold had believed in a German victory and had acted accordingly: (1) the King’s entourage; (2) the note written on August 30, 1940, by Louis Frédéricq, Leopold’s chef de cabinet to d’Ursel, the Belgian minister to Switzerland, and to Le Tellier, the Belgian ambassador to France; and the d’Ursel telegram sent in September, 1940; (3) the King’s trip to Berchtesgaden in November, 1940; (4) the King’s visit to Austria; (5) the congratulatory telegram to Hitler on his birthday and the telegram of condolence to the King of Italy at the death of Prince Amadeo, the Duke d’Aoste; (6) the King’s deportation in June, 1944; and (7) the King’s second marriage.\n\nThe entourage.—When the accusers of King Leopold spoke of his entourage, they referred primarily to two men, Leopold’s private secretary, Count Capelle, and Henri De Man, the president of the Socialist party at the outbreak of the war, and later a confidant of the King.3\n\nLeopold was judged guilty by association with De Man. De Man was a Socialist and a utopian idealist who believed that the power of money had corrupted every human institution and that the parliamentary form of government was the instrument of this corruption. He awaited the transformation that would rid society of both evils and restore a just social order founded on the dignity of human labor and secured by a long-lasting peace. De Man saw that there would be no peace in Europe until the conflicts between France and Germany were resolved, and he welcomed the Nazi movement as the means by which a new Europe would be established. He was not convinced that the movement would be the ultimate constructive force, but he was convinced that it would destroy the decayed old order.4\n\nDe Man did not oppose the Germans when they invaded Belgium. On the contrary, he told the members of the Socialist party in a manifesto issued June 28, 1940:\n\nDo not think that it is necessary to resist the occupant. Accept the fact of his victory and try to learn from it the proper lessons in order to create the point of departure for new social progress. The war has brought about the collapse of the parliamentary regime and of capitalist plutocracy in the so-called democracies.… Prepare yourselves to enter the ranks of a movement of national resurrection.5\n\nOn February 16, 1941, he spoke at a conference in Brussels.\n\nHere in Belgium the power of the state was becoming weaker and weaker while, on the other hand, the power of money increased its strength from day to day. The origin of national socialism had its causes; that is impossible to deny. It has now replaced outworn things, but in an ultimate sense national socialism has still nothing to say.\n\nI am not a German nationalist, but a Belgian socialist, or, if you prefer, a national-socialist Belgian.… Socialism wants a social order in which labor is able to rule and in which the right to work can have value for everyone. Often that is not possible without an authoritarian state capable of destroying the force of money.\n\nThe time of parliamentary government has passed.… Democracy is more than a parliamentary system.… The parliamentary system is only its bourgeois form.…\n\nThe State must take on a new form. That form can only be authoritarian since that characteristic goes hand in hand with revolution.… After the war Europe will have a new form. That is why we admit the principle of order and of fulfillment in a unified Europe under an authoritarian system. But we should not ask that of the Germans. It is necessary that it come from Belgians.6\n\nThe Germans were not willing to accept even such mild criticism as De Man’s. In 1942 he was expelled from Belgium and permitted to enter Switzerland, certainly a rather mild form of punishment if compared with the treatment meted out by Germany to those who truly opposed the Nazi regime. That De Man was distasteful to the German occupant did not preclude, then, the accusation made by Belgians that he was a traitor. Surely he was not a traitor like Staf De Clercq, the chief of the National Flemish Movement (the V.N.V.), who looked to the Nazis for the creation of an autonomous Flemish state, or like the leaders of the Walloon Separatists who hoped that the war would bring about either Walloon autonomy or the annexation of Wallonia to France.7 These men were violently anti-Belgian by being either pro-Flemish or pro-Walloon. De Man was pro-Belgian, but his unique and personal “patriotism” called for the destruction of those institutions to which most of his compatriots were devoted. He was a traitor sui generis.\n\nThe attempt to distinguish among traitors has significance for this study. It is not unlikely that the idealism which propelled De Man was infectious. De Man, too, was driven by a concept of “the greater good of Belgium,” a principle congenial to Leopold. The King’s mind probably did not have the breadth or subtlety of De Man’s, but it is not unreasonable to assume that Leopold’s belief that Belgium might be able to derive some advantage from a German victory was nourished by his association with De Man.\n\nThe case against Capelle, and to a lesser degree against Frédéricq, rested on the evidence of letters written by them to Raymond De Becker, the pro-German editor-in-chief of Le Soir8 during the occupation, and by the association of Capelle with Robert Poulet, the editor of the pro-German newspaper Nouveau Journal. On January 9, 1941, Capelle wrote to De Becker:\n\nI had the honor of giving the King your message as well as the special edition of Le Soir dedicated to Belgian unity.\n\nHis Majesty was touched by this homage and has requested me to thank you for it.9\n\nOn November 18 Frédéricq wrote to De Becker: “On his saint day you had the occasion to address to the King a message of loyalty and fidelity. I have the honor of being requested to express to you and to all those for whom you wrote the warm thanks of His Majesty.”10\n\nMany claim that Robert Poulet, through his newspaper Nouveau Journal, acted as spokesman for the Crown. As we shall see in a later chapter dealing with Leopold’s defense, this charge was denied. After the war Poulet was condemned to death for collaboration, but no word came from Leopold on his behalf. Pleading for her husband’s life, Mrs. Poulet wrote a letter to the King which gave strong evidence of the association between Poulet and Laeken:\n\nSire, it is the wife of a writer unjustly condemned who writes to you. That writer was condemned for having sincerely expressed his thoughts. But as you well know, he would never have publicly expressed himself under the circumstances if he had not been convinced that the King approved his actions. At least twenty times during the twenty-seven months in which he wrote I saw my husband leave for a rendezvous which your secretary had arranged and return from it calm and reassured. “From the moment that I am in communion with the King’s ideas, I am at ease,” he told me each time, and he would then tell me the significant points which the important person designated by the King had made to him.… It is possible that in 1940–1943 you did not believe that you would have to go so far as to protect a journalist who never ceased being loyal to you.… It is not less true, and you have known it ever since then, that that journalist did not write one line without having your moral support. You should consider it an outrage … that a man is condemned as a traitor who was engaged in a continual exchange of views with your closest collaborator, who acted according to your instructions.11\n\nThe Frédéricq note and the d’Ursel telegram.—On August 30, 1940, Louis Frédéricq, Leopold’s chef de cabinet, sent a note to Le Tellier, the Belgian ambassador to France, and to d’Ursel, the Belgian minister to Switzerland, which note was to be relayed to London to Albert De Vleeschauwer, the administrator-general of the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi.12 The occasion of the message was the recent announcement by De Vleeschauwer that the raw materials and wealth of the Congo should be used for the exclusive advantage of the Allies, and that the Congo should participate in military actions with the Allies against the Italian forces in Africa. Frédéricq’s message read:\n\nThe documents given to Princess Joséphine Charlotte [Leopold’s daughter] and to the Grand Marshal have arrived at their high destination. The documents revealed that Mr. De Vleeschauwer often speaks of Belgium’s “word of honor” (parole donnée) in order to justify his actions. His opinion is false.\n\nBelgium, independent and neutral, contracted no alliance. She undertook vis-à-vis her guarantors only the defense of her territory against the invader. Her word did not go beyond this. Faithful to that word, the country fulfilled its obligations to the extreme limit of its strength. It accomplished all its duties vis-à-vis the guarantors.\n\nThe radio has announced that the colony proposes to engage in military operations. Attention is brought to the danger which would come from the example of engaging troops beyond the borders of the colony. Moreover, Belgium has never been at war with Italy. The repercussions of such action would be incalculable. The Congo, which has assumed no more obligations than did the mother country, should take military measures only if directly attacked.13\n\nD’Ursel sent the following telegram to De Vleeschauwer based upon the information in the note from Frédéricq:\n\nAccording to instructions, we must reject the thesis that an alliance with our guarantors links our fate to theirs. Our counteragreement did not pass beyond the agreement to defend our territory. The war ended for us on May 28. We must not risk dragging into the fight the colony which must observe an absolute neutrality. We have never been at war with Italy.14\n\nThe d’Ursel telegram was written by Count d’Ursel, the Belgian ambassador at Berne, to Belgian diplomatic posts throughout the world. It was dated September 6, 1940,15 and was based upon information which the Count had received from Capelle:\n\nAt the present time it is difficult to form a considered opinion concerning our future. The general impression is that our political independence can be re-established, at least in part; that is essential. The events of the recent past prove that it is very difficult for a small country to influence events, even when the Head of State is as loyal as ours.\n\nWe have never admitted the thesis of the Pierlot Government according to which an alliance exists between Belgium, France, and England. Those two countries were our guarantors who came to our aid in accordance with their promise. Our counteragreement was to defend our land, but there was never either a common cause or the promise to link our fate with theirs.… We cannot uphold in any way whatsoever the ministers who, now either in London or in Lisbon, continue a war which is opposed to our interests and loyalty.\n\nIt is particularly reprehensible to risk bringing the Congo into the war, as De Vleeschauwer is doing. We believe that our colony should observe strict neutrality. In business affairs she should maintain the principle of the open door and sell our products … to anyone who comes for delivery.\n\nIt would be desirable that you and your colleagues reestablish relations with the diplomatic representatives of Germany. In actual fact we are no longer at war with that country; we should be loyal and correct. Without having cordial relations with the representatives of the occupant, it is of common interest that the relations be courteous. They will establish the rightness of our policy and will permit us to furnish and receive information valuable to the country.16\n\nSpaak commented in Parliament on July 25, 1945:\n\nOf course, I do not pretend that the terms of the telegram were dictated by the King himself; for if the document is disturbing in its meaning, it is truly odious in its form. But I am convinced, knowing Count d’Ursel, that it was not he who took the initiative [to send the telegram].17\n\nThe trip to Berchtesgaden.—On November 19, 1940, the King met with Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Leopold has claimed that the Führer ordered him to Germany and that he went only to seek from the Chancellor an amelioration of the food situation in Belgium and the repatriation of Belgian troops. Leopold denied that the audience was politically significant. Van Acker, however, declared in his speech on July 20:\n\nTo those who say that the King went to Berchtesgaden by order of the Führer, I answer that it is not so. The audience was solicited by the King; the trip was premeditated and prepared long in advance; the interview with Chancellor Hitler had political importance. It was the King’s sister, Marie-José, the princess of Piedmont, who, at the request of the King, arranged the interview with the Führer.… The interview at Berchtesgaden did not have as its object, or in any case did not have as its sole object, the discussion of the fate of prisoners and the food situation.18\n\nVan Acker recalled that Leopold, traveling to Berchtesgaden, was accorded full honors by the Germans, and that the meeting with Hitler, for which the King wore his formal dress uniform, lasted two hours, after which tea was served, implying a cordial atmosphere. Van Acker’s evidence came primarily from the account of the interview written by Paul Schmidt, Hitler’s interpreter.19\n\nSchmidt wrote that after greeting each other, the King thanked the Führer for everything he had done for Belgium, particularly the repatriation of Belgian refugees caught in France. He also thanked him for numerous personal attentions, among them the return of the royal children from Spain.20 Leopold said that he had no personal requests to make of Hitler.\n\nThe Chancellor then asked Leopold what he thought of future relations between Germany and Belgium. The King answered that above all he would like to know Hitler’s intentions regarding Belgium and inquired if the Führer would guarantee Belgian independence following the war. Hitler answered that Belgium would be part of the general reorganization of Europe that would include all those states which were in Germany’s economic and political sphere. Belgium’s independence, as far as her internal politics was concerned, would depend on how closely she aligned herself with Germany. According to Schmidt, Leopold then asked for some guarantees from Hitler regarding independence. He said that public opinion in Belgium was uneasy because Germany had made no announcement concerning Belgium’s future, whereas England had broadcast by radio that Belgian independence would be respected at the end of the war. After a discussion of these issues the King and Hitler spoke of the food situation and of Belgian prisoners of war.\n\nHitler gave no specific answer to any of Leopold’s questions. Regarding independence, the Führer said only that Belgium would occupy a certain place in the framework of economic and political co-operation with Germany, but that any declaration to the Belgian people concerning this would be considered a weakness. The Chancellor concluded the business part of the interview with the comment that Leopold had been wise to end the war when he did, thereby avoiding the complete annihilation of the Belgian army. He said, too, that it was good that Leopold had remained with his people, because the King of Norway and the Queen of Holland would certainly never reascend their thrones. Hitler guaranteed Leopold that Germany would not touch the Belgian royal house.\n\nSpaak commented in Parliament on July 25, 1945:\n\nI have certain scruples when I see the whole country rise up and demand … the punishment of … those people … who had the same idea [as King Leopold] that the war was over and that it was necessary for Belgium to have a place in the new Europe which was going to be dominated by Germany.… Yet … there are some who seem to find it quite natural that the King of the Belgians, in the midst of war, should go to Berchtesgaden to take part in political discussions … and when these discussions were over to take tea with the Führer.… Well, gentlemen, if a clerk of one of our departments, or if one of my directors-general—or even a simple employee—had done much less than that, an investigating committee would have condemned him without pity.\n\nTruly we do not have the right to have two weights and two measures, to strike down without pity the small and the weak and to show indulgence … when it concerns the first citizen of the land who goes to Berchtesgaden to take tea for two hours with the Führer.21\n\nThe telegrams of congratulation and condolence.—The accusers of King Leopold cite the following evidence that he courted not only the Germans but the Italians as well. On April 22, 1941, a telegram was received at Laeken. It came from a Dr. Meissner, a Nazi minister, addressed to Colonel Kiewitz, the King’s gaoler: “The Führer requests that you thank the King for the greetings expressed by him on the occasion of his [Hitler’s] birthday.”22 On March 7, 1942, Leopold sent a telegram to Rome, via Berlin, transmitted by the chargé d’affaires of the Italian embassy at Brussels: “His Majesty the King, Rome. I express to you my deepest sympathy on the occasion of the death of Prince Amadeo, a great patriot and brilliant military chief. Leopold.”23\n\nSpaak observed:\n\nDid the King of England, during the war, telegraph the King of Italy when the Duke d’Aoste [Prince Amadeo] died? It is very indicative of a state of mind. Can you imagine a state of mind like that? Belgium was at war with Italy. Italy was allied with Germany. Italy could have done us great harm. The outcome of the war at that time could have depended upon her action.… It happened that the General-in-Chief of that Italian army, who not only fought the English but also the Belgians, died after having been taken prisoner. A telegram of condolence was then sent to his family in which the memory of that great citizen and brave head of the army was celebrated.\n\nEither that represents the total absence of a sense of reality or it demonstrates that they were getting deeper into a policy in which they were already deeply involved. One cannot be opposed frankly and fiercely to Italy when one is not opposed frankly and fiercely to Germany.24\n\nThe trips to Austria.—During the war the King traveled to Austria. His defenders say he went to consult a dentist. Van Acker commented:\n\nThe King, a prisoner, left the Palace of Laeken on several occasions. We would have nothing to say if he had remained in Belgium or if he had attempted to reach an Allied country, which would have been even better. But we are obliged to state that he offended public opinion by voluntarily going to Austria, to Vienna and Salzburg, during the war, to a country at war with ours where he was the guest of one of the most notorious Nazis in Austria—Count Kuehn.25\n\nThe deportation.—The accusers of King Leopold claim that he solicited his deportation from Belgium to Germany in June, 1944. They based their charge on a document allegedly written by Van Straelen, director of the Royal Museum of Natural History, who had been asked by various patriotic groups to inquire of the Sovereign his intentions in the event of an Allied invasion of Europe. These groups urged Leopold’s presence in Belgium at the liberation and suggested that he escape his captors and go into hiding in order to insure it. According to the Van Straelen document, the contents of which were communicated to the Government in London shortly before Leopold’s deportation, the King refused. Van Acker, revealing publicly for the first time the contents of this document, told Parliament on July 20:\n\nDuring the conversation which he [the King] had with the person of whom I have just spoken [Van Straelen] the King made declarations which one could only classify as very disturbing. He thought: (1) that at the moment of landing and, in any case, at the moment of liberation, there would be a bloody reaction in Belgium; (2) that he did not want to be a part of it, preferring to be away from Belgium and to return when it was all over; (3) that he did not intend to be present at the moment of the Allied landing; (4) that he did not want to meet any member of the London government; (5) that his departure would have the advantage of leaving to others the responsibility of the moment; (6) that the choice of a Regent would pose so many problems that they would not hesitate to abandon his election and ask the King to return; (7) that the Allied command would not fail to interfere in everything and that he could not tolerate this interference if he were in Belgium; (8) that the American and English generals were brutal and clumsy; (9) that he desired not to be present when all the dirty linen was washed after the Germans left.…\n\nIf the King was not found in Brussels at the time of the arrival of the Allies, it is not because he suffered deportation. It is because he accepted it voluntarily, if indeed he did not provoke it, in spite of the counsel and the pleadings which were heaped on him before June 6.26\n\nThe second marriage.—Leopold’s marriage to Liliane Baels in September, 1941, is a microcosm of the royal question. The frenzy of reaction to it has calmed very little in the nineteen years that have passed. Today in Belgium the mere mention of Miss Baels, now the Princess de Réthy, can provoke a diatribe in which the ex-King is either damned or praised, depending on the geographic and political origins of the speaker.\n\nThe essence of the controversy over the marriage is constitutional, but the significance of it is political and psychological.27 This part of the indictment against King Leopold touched the emotions and sentiments of the people more directly than any other charge, including that of treason, and the politicians intent on breaking the King took full advantage of this sensitivity. Van Acker’s statement well illustrates this technique:\n\nIt was during the war that the King decided to contract a new marriage. By doing so he chose the family of which he became a member.\n\nThe marriage did immense harm to His Majesty. In the eyes of the people a king is not like other men. He is considered a superman. The pedestal upon which the King was placed was destroyed by the marriage.…\n\nThe legend has crumbled, and nothing remains. The nobleman is furious. The bourgeois is unhappy; in his selfishness he asks himself why the King did not marry his daughter; and the common man understands nothing at all of it. He finds that the King should have married someone from his own world.\n\nThe people do not accept such a marriage. They accept it in a film, in a novel, in some other country, or in a history book. Some day they might be proud that the King contracted such a marriage. But today it is an error.…\n\nThe attitude of the King during the war constitutes a bad example for our young people and for the generations to come.\n\nAt every level of Belgian society there are to be found those who by their resistance to the occupant and by their devotion to the cause of the country have given magnificent proof of our national vitality.\n\nOne should legitimately have been able to expect of the first citizen of Belgium, throughout the years of mourning and trial, to be the very incarnation of the sufferings endured by his people and of their will to oppose under all circumstances the demands of the enemy.28\n\nThere are many Belgians who believe that the royal affair would not have turned out so disastrously for Leopold had he not married Liliane Baels. (Observe that the statement is “had he not married Liliane Baels,” rather than “had he not remarried.”) They are convinced that irrespective of the constitutional and political involvements, a compromise could have been reached between the Government and the King, had it not been for presence of the Princess.\n\nTo understand the hatred that many Belgians feel for the Princess, one has to appreciate the affection that all Belgians had for Leopold’s first wife, the Swedish Princess Astrid. The twenty-five years that have passed since her death have lessened none of this devotion. She is still remembered as the Queen who shopped personally in the stores, walked her children in the public parks, visited the sick, gave generously of herself to charity. It was she who warmed the cool aloofness of Leopold toward his subjects and re-established the affection which had bound King Albert and his family so closely to the Belgians. Her death was a personal loss which the people shared with Leopold.29\n\nThe suffering Leopold became almost a symbol to his subjects, particularly after the fall of Belgium: a handsome young man suddenly made King by his beloved father’s premature death, a widower accidently responsible for the death of an idolized wife, a father of three motherless children, a leader defeated in war, a hero imprisoned by the enemy.\n\nLiliane Baels, a Flemish commoner, unwittingly destroyed the symbol and shattered the identification between the King and his subjects, particularly where this identification was most intense—among women. The author was told that after the announcement of the marriage was made in December, 1941, there was a perceptible drop in morale, especially among the women whose men were prisoners of war, and it was most noticeable in Wallonia, where the percentage of prisoners was higher than in Flanders.30\n\nIf this beginning of public life was not sufficiently inauspicious for the Princess, the animosity against her was increased by the knowledge that her father, the governor of West Flanders at the outbreak of war, had fled before the Germans and that her brother was accused of draft dodging for refusing to join the Belgian army after 1940.\n\nThis animosity, now a part of the Flemish-Walloon friction and of the volatile wartime incivisme issue, was strongest among the bourgeoisie. It would seem that in a stratified but essentially bourgeois society like the Belgian, where social mobility is possible but limited, the arriviste (it matters little whether Princess Liliane deserves this epithet; she is “considered” a parvenue) is condemned if the social leap is too conspicuous or too easy. To satisfy bourgeois mentality the move must be earned honorably and quietly. A beautiful and intelligent twenty-five-year-old bourgeois woman marrying a king would be automatically suspect.31\n\nThe Country Waits for the King’s Defense\n\nA year of feints and parries separated the Government’s indictment and the initiation of the King’s defense. Leopold used the occasion of his change of residence from Austria to Switzerland to address his subjects by radio. In the broadcast he condemned the attack made against him by Van Acker and Spaak, and stated his intention to await the verdict of the people before agreeing to abdicate: “The Belgian monarchy is founded on the common will of the citizens. Whatever that will may be, whatever may be the legal means by which it is expressed, I accept its verdict in advance.”32 In other words, Leopold maintained the position he had taken in the letter he wrote to the Prince Regent on July 14. The King also informed the Belgians that on July 14, 1945, he had offered to Van Acker and the Government the opportunity to consult the royal dossiers.\n\nIn a speech to the Senate on October 16 Van Acker commented on the King’s broadcast: “The King gives us to understand that he offered to open his dossiers to us. I find myself forced categorically to deny that affirmation.”33 Van Acker’s denial brought a counterdenial from Leopold’s secretary, Jacques Pirenne.34 His statement was corroborated by the Minister of Justice in Van Acker’s Cabinet, Du Bus de Warnaffe, who had been present when Leopold made his offer. The Premier’s attempt to silence the King had miscarried because of de Warnaffe, and on November 6, 1945, Van Acker was compelled to announce that the Government would consent to publish a White Paper in which all information regarding the royal question would be included, not only the Government’s documents but those of the King as well. Leopold refused the Government’s offer but countered with the suggestion that he publish his own White Paper to appear simultaneously with the Government’s: “The King considers that it would be impossible for him to allow the Government to publish his dossier, the Government having taken the position of accuser against His Majesty.”35\n\nThe issue hung fire until the dissolution of Parliament on January 9, 1946, and the Government’s announcement that elections would take place on February 17. Leopold then reopened the controversy regarding a national consultation, a device rejected by a committee in the House of Representatives on October 17, 1945.36 He proposed in a letter to the Government dated January 16, 1946, that a national consultation take place following the elections between which two events he and the Government would publish their dossiers.\n\nRegenerated by the verdict of national sovereignty, the monarchy, whatever is left of it by then, will resume its constitutional role which has been too long restrained.\n\nIf the nation does not declare itself frankly in my favor, I shall abdicate.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Belgians place their confidence in me, I will resume the exercise of my prerogatives.37\n\nThe Government rejected Leopold’s proposal reminding him that it appeared to contradict his statements made in the letter to the Prince Regent on July 14 and in the message to the nation broadcast on September 30.\n\nParliament is the legal expression of the sovereign will of the nation. Contrary to what the antinational parties supposed before the war, there is not and there could not be an antipathy between the legal country and the real country. The King has accepted in advance the verdict of the common will of all citizens whatever may be the legal means by which it is expressed. Moreover, as the Constitution stipulates, Parliament, offspring of universal suffrage, will be the interpreter of that will. The House [of Representatives] has declared that the proposition which the King has brought up again was incompatible with the Constitution and with the parliamentary democracy which it organizes and guarantees.\n\nThe Government is not able to revise that judgment.\n\nYour Majesty fears that if the solution of the royal question is carried over after the elections [and not followed by a popular consultation] the elections will threaten the principle of the monarchy.\n\nThe principle of the monarchy is not in question, and the monarchy has continued to exercise its constitutional function since the liberation. The Government declares solemnly that neither the principle of the monarchy nor that of the Dynasty is disputed or threatened and that they are not the stakes of any electoral battle. On the contrary, to have recourse after the elections to the consultation rejected by the House is to create a dangerous precedent for the monarchy, which risks becoming elective rather than [remaining] hereditary.38\n\nLeopold, still maneuvering to strengthen his position, responded through his secretary, Pirenne, that the Government had misinterpreted his proposal. He did not intend that the consultation be a referendum but the means of investigating public opinion, a device consistent with Article 40 of the Constitution.39 He restated his willingness to publish a White Paper to appear simultaneously with the one coming from the Government. The White Papers were to appear after the elections, however.40 On February 7 the Council of Ministers agreed to Leopold’s proposal.\n\nThe elections held on February 17, 1946, neither solved nor clarified the royal question, contrary to the expectations both of the Left, which hoped to entrench itself more deeply, and of Leopold, who awaited vindication. As a result of the elections, the Left bloc in the House outnumbered the Catholic Right by seventeen votes, compared to thirty-three votes before the elections. Catholic gains in this election resulted from the disappearance of prewar fascist splinter parties. In the Senate the Left’s twenty-seven-vote majority fell to a single vote.41 The new Cabinet, formed after great difficulty on April 3, remained tripartite under the premiership of Van Acker.42\n\nThe results of the elections reopened the issue of the White Papers. The Government was reluctant to publish; Leopold, on the other hand, was more eager than ever. His defense was still pending. A national consultation would not be held, yet the elections had given him encouragement. Leopold decided to appoint his own commission to which he would open all but his private dossiers. On July 14, 1946, the King’s official letter of invitation to form a commission was sent to the following nine men:\n\nGaétan Delacroix—President of the Order of Attorneys attached to the Cour de Cassation.\n\nLéopold Devos—First president emeritus of the Cour d’Appel in Brussels, former president of the Faculty of Law at the Free University of Brussels, and honorary professor at the same university.\n\nPierre Graux—Former president of the Order of Attorneys attached to the Cour de Cassation of Brussels, former president of the Faculty of Law at the University of Brussels, and honorary professor at the same university.\n\nCharles Loiseau—First solicitor general emeritus of the Cour d’Appel at Liége.\n\nRené Marcq—Honorary president of the Administrative Council of the Free University of Brussels, professor at the same university, former president of the Order of Attorneys attached to the Cour de Cassation, and member of the Royal Academy of Belgium.\n\nJean Servais—Minister of state, honorary attorney general attached to the Cour d’Appel, honorary president of the Administrative Council of the Free University of Brussels, and professor at the same university.\n\nLéon van der Essen—Secretary general of the Catholic University of Louvain, professor at that university, and member of the Flemish Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.\n\nV. van Hoestenberghe—Former senator, Bourgemester of Bruges, and former president of the Order of Attorneys attached to the Court at Bruges.\n\nMonseigneur van Waeyenbergh—Rector-magnificent of the Catholic University of Louvain, and member of the Flemish Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.\n\nAn examination of this list reveals the geographic and political distribution of the commissioners. There were representatives from Flanders and Wallonia as well as graduates of and professors at both the Free (i.e., nonsectarian) University of Brussels—the Alma Mater of Belgian Socialists, Liberals, and Communists—and the Catholic University of Louvain. All except two of Leopold’s choices were attorneys and all had impeccable war records. The distribution reveals this phenomenon: that no body which aspired to carry on “objective” research dealing with a national question could fail to represent the ethnic, religious, linguistic, and political dichotomy in Belgium.\n\nIt was this Commission of Information which studied for a whole year the files made available to them by King Leopold. It published its final report on March 25, 1947.\n\nPerhaps Leopold’s real mistake was his failure to change his policy of attentisme when victory for the Allies became certain: “But what is so terrible in the case of the King is that at no moment did we see take place in his mind a healthy return to the principles which he had espoused in 1940.” (Speech delivered by Spaak to Parliament on July 25, 1945. Recueil, p. 656.)\n\nThis seems to add weight to the evidence that the policy of the King was one of “wait and see” and not one based on the belief that Germany would be victorious. Had he believed the latter, it would have been to his advantage to reverse his position and openly embrace the Allies when their victory seemed sure.\n\nAt the critical hours of my reign, of which there have been so many, I obeyed only my royal conscience. One cannot fail to recognize that Belgium, of all the countries which were submerged by the terrible tidal wave of 1940, has the most rapidly reconstituted her forces because she did not use them during the occupation in vain and fratricidal conflicts. One can discuss the question, from a constitutional point of view, to know if I had reason or not to remain among my people during the war. But one must recognize that my presence preserved their unity and kept them from many horrible miseries which other countries suffered."
