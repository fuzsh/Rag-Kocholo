        "text": "\"Astrid of Belgium\" redirects here. For her grandmother, Astrid, Queen of the Belgians and consort to King Leopold III, see Astrid of Sweden.\n\nPrincess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este (born 5 June 1962), is the second child and first daughter of King Albert II and Queen Paola, and the younger sister to the current Belgian monarch, King Philippe. She is married to Prince Lorenz of Belgium, head of the Austria-Este branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and is fifth in line of succession to the Belgian throne.\n\nBiography\n\nPrincess Astrid was born one day before her father's 28th birthday at the Belvédère Château in Laeken, northern Brussels, and was named after her late paternal grandmother, Astrid of Sweden, the popular first wife of King Leopold III. Her godparents were her uncle Fabrizio, Prince Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau, 7th Duke di Guardia Lombarda, and her aunt Hereditary Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg.\n\nMarriage and issue\n\nPrincess Astrid married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este, subsequently head of the Archducal House of Austria-Este, on 22 September 1984 at Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon in Brussels. Lorenz is the eldest son of Robert, Archduke of Austria-Este (1915–1996), and his wife Princess Margherita of Savoy-Aosta (1930–2022). Her husband was also created Prince of Belgium by Royal Decree on 27 November 1995.\n\nPrincess Astrid and Prince Lorenz have five children:\n\nPrince Amedeo Maria Josef Carl Pierre Philippe Paola Marcus d'Aviano of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este (born on 21 February 1986 at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels).\n\nPrincess Maria Laura Zita Beatrix Gerhard d'Autriche-Este (Habsbourg-Lorraine), Princess of Belgium (born on 26 August 1988 at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc in Woluwé-Saint-Lambert, Brussels), m.

She declined to stand again for election to the role in light of internal struggles in the organisation in reconciling its Flemish-speaking and French branches, each of which seeks greater autonomy. The princess is also a colonel in the Medical Component of the Belgian Armed Forces. Her official residence is the Royal Castle of Laeken on the edge of Brussels.\n\nShe is a member of the Honorary Board of the International Paralympic Committee.\n\nIn April 2015 the Princess took over the reins of the Prince Albert Fund from her father King Albert.\n\nSpecial Envoy\n\nPrincess Astrid has been for many years a fierce advocate for landmine survivors rights, participating actively in the work of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, also known as the Ottawa Treaty, since Belgium joined in 1998.\n\nIn 2013, the Princess was named Special Envoy of the convention, and has promoted the acceptance of a global ban on landmines and promoted the rights of survivors in various UN meetings.\n\nIn 2014, she met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah, to encourage Oman to join the treaty, which occurred a few months later.\n\nIn 2019, she carried out a mission to Lebanon to promote the convention. In Beirut she met with President Michel Aoun, and Minister of National Defense Elias Bou Saab.\n\nTitles, styles and honours\n\nTitles\n\n5 June 1962 – 22 September 1984: Her Royal Highness Princess Astrid of Belgium\n\n22 September 1984 – present: Her Imperial and Royal Highness Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nHonours\n\nSee also: List of honours of the Belgian royal family by country\n\nNational\n\nBelgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold\n\nForeign\n\nGermany: Grand Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nHungary: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary\n\nLuxembourg: Grand Cross of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau\n\nNetherlands: Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown\n\nNorway: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n\nPortugal: Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry\n\nSpain: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit\n\nSweden: Member Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Polar Star\n\nAwards\n\nPeru: Freedom of the City of Lima\n\nOther\n\n2016 : Honorary mayor and The Hidalgo Award of San Antonio, Texas.\n\nArms\n\nCoat of arms of Princess Astrid of Belgium\n\nNotes\n\nAs a Princess of Belgium and a descendant of King Leopold I, the Princess is entitled to use a coat of arms which was stipulated in the Royal Decree of King Philippe in 2019.\n\nAdopted\n\n12 July 2019\n\nCoronet\n\nPrincely crown of Belgium\n\nEscutcheon\n\nOn a lozenge, sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules (Belgium), on the shoulder an escutcheon barry of ten sable and or, a crancelin vert (Wettin), overall a bordure or.\n\nSupporters\n\nTwo lions guardant proper\n\nMotto\n\nFrench: L'union fait la force\n\nDutch: Eendracht maakt macht\n\nGerman: Einigkeit macht stark\n\nOther elements\n\nThe whole is placed on a mantle purpure with ermine lining, fringes and tassels or and ensigned with the Royal crown of Belgium.\n\nRanks\n\n23 May 1997 – 26 December 2003: Belgian Medical Component, Lieutenant-colonel\n\n26 December 2003 – : Belgian Medical Component, Colonel\n\n1997 2003\n\nNote\n\nSee also"
