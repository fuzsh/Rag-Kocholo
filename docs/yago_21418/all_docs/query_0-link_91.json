        "text": "Princess Astrid, the younger sister of King Philippe of Belgium, has always had a keen eye for fashion, remaining flawlessly elegant at 60 today. On the day of her wedding, 22 September 1984, she embraced the exuberant style of the era in a bold puffball-sleeved gown, taking centre stage beside her dapper new husband, Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este.\n\nBorn in 1962 and named after her grandmother, Astrid of Sweden (who became Queen of the Belgians as the first wife of King Leopold III), Princess Astrid is the only daughter of King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium (although Albert, who has now abdicated in favour of his son, has another daughter, Princess Delphine, from an extra-marital relationship).\n\nA look back at Princess Astrid of Belgium’s most fashion-forward looks in honour of her birthday\n\nRead More\n\nAstrid married the aristocratic Archduke Lorenz, eldest son of Robert, Archduke of Austria-Este and Princess Margherita of Savoy-Aosta, at the Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon in Brussels. The bride’s magnificent taffeta gown was the work of local couturier Louis Mies, which she accessorised with an antique Ruffo di Calabria veil (dating back to Queen Paola’s grandmother, Laura Mosselman du Chenoy), and a pretty floral crown.\n\nEuropean royals flocked to the Belgian capital for the joyful occasion, with King Olav V of Norway, Queen Sofía of Spain, Marie-José of Belgium (the last Queen of Italy), Queen Anne of Romania, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Britain’s Duke and Duchess of Gloucester among the notable guests.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the couple waved to members of the public from a balcony, looking every inch the smitten newlyweds as they beamed and whispered in each other’s ears, much to the delight of the crowds below.\n\nPrincess Astrid’s husband was later created Prince of Belgium by Royal Decree in 1995 and the couple have five children together: Prince Amedeo, Princess Maria Laura, Prince Joachim, Princess Luisa Maria, and Princess Laetitia Maria. They are now also grandparents, after their son, Amedeo, welcomed two children of his own.\n\nSubscribe now to get 3 issues for just £1, plus free home delivery and free instant access to the digital editions."
