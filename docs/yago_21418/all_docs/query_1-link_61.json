        "text": "Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este (born 5 June 1962), is the second child and first daughter of King Albert II and Queen Paola, and the younger sister to the current Belgian monarch, King Philippe. She is married to Prince Lorenz of Belgium, head of the Austria-Este branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and is fifth in line of succession to the Belgian throne.\n\nBiography\n\nPrincess Astrid was born one day before her father's 28th birthday at the Belvedere Chateau in Laeken, northern Brussels, and was named after her late paternal grandmother, Astrid of Sweden, the popular first wife of King Leopold III. Her godparents were her uncle Fabrizio, Prince Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau, 7th Duke di Guardia Lombarda, and her aunt Hereditary Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte of Luxembourg.\n\nMarriage and Issue\n\nPrincess Astrid married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este, subsequently head of the Archducal House of Astria-Este, on 22 September 1984 at Church of Our Blessed Lady of the Sablon in Brussels.
