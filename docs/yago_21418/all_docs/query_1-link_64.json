        "text": "This edited article about Belgium first appeared in Look and Learn issue number 523 published on 22 January 1972.\n\nRinged by towering mountains with their snow caps softened by sunshine, there stands beside the Lake of Lucerne, in central Switzerland, where the lakeside road drops down gently in a long straight ribbon of tarmac, a little white-walled commemorative chapel.\n\nIf you see it, for it is hardly visible, you can reach it by a specially made subway under the road. A little courtyard fronts it and a grille keeps out the curious, but the flowers inside are always fresh.\n\nHere, in the summer of 1935, there occurred a royal tragedy which saddened the world and plunged a nation into grief.\n\nIts principals were Leopold the Third, King of the Belgians, and his lovely Swedish born Queen Astrid. Here, as inheritors of one of Europe’s most tragic crowns, they were to write a page of history even more heart-breaking than the pages before them.\n\nThe story began with Leopold’s father, Albert. At six foot three inches he was a giant among men and one who never knew the meaning of fear. Faced with an ultimatum in August, 1914, to guarantee the free passage of German troops through Belgium, Albert steadfastly rejected it.\n\n“We shall defend our rights,” he said, well knowing the consequences of doing so. “They shall not pass.”\n\nBelgium’s tiny army was no match for the Kaiser’s disciplined troops, but inspired by their King, who fought alongside them in the trenches, they resisted like men possessed. Inevitably, Belgium was overcome, but when that first World War ended in 1918 Albert returned to his capital for a hero’s welcome.\n\nIn peace, mountains fascinated King Albert, and his skill as a climber was equal to some of the greatest mountaineers. He had conquered the peaks of Europe and Africa with patience and daring and whenever royal duties allowed him time, he would put on his boots, collect his kit, and make for the nearest mountain.\n\nOne such time presented itself on Saturday, February 17, 1934. The King had an evening engagement but the afternoon was free. He knew a rock, only a few hundred feet high but full of challenges, on the banks of the River Meuse. A couple of hours would suffice to conquer it alone and unaided; it would make a pleasant afternoon’s relaxation.\n\nFeeling pleased with this prospect, the King drove himself and his valet to his rendezvous with adventure. Leaving the valet with the car, he set off through the bushes at the bottom of the rock. He was never seen alive again.\n\nWhen dusk fell and the king did not return, the valet anxiously raised the alarm. A search party arrived and at 2 a.m. they found the body of the King near the base of the rock. His skull was fractured and from an examination of the area later it was decided that a rock used by the King as a hand-hold had given way, taking him with it as it fell.\n\nCrown Prince Leopold, on holiday with his family in Switzerland, returned to a grief-stricken nation. He was a tall, handsome young man and his wife was a woman of rare beauty. As a boy Leopold had gone to school at Eton, where he was a prefect’s “fag.” When he announced that he would marry Astrid, Belgium and Sweden rejoiced at the royal love-match. Their three children, Josephine, Baudouin, who is now King of the Belgians, and Albert, were often seen being pushed in their prams by their lovely young mother in the parks of Brussels – informal episodes which won the hearts of Belgians.\n\nThus, while the standards of the monarchy he had so tragically inherited were dauntingly high, no one had any doubts that Leopold the Third would uphold them in the best tradition.\n\nIndeed, few monarchs were ever more popular than Leopold. They were difficult times, economically for the people of Belgium, as indeed they were for the rest of Europe, but throughout the next 18 months the young King and Queen were idolised by their people.\n\nIn August, 1935, 18 months after his father’s death, Leopold took his family to their villa at the village of Horw – which is pronounced “Horp” – at the side of Lake Lucerne. Here the green fields that run down to the lake are dotted with elegant villas around which grazing cows make perpetual music with their neck bells.\n\nAt 9.30 am on August 29 the King and Queen left their villa for a drive towards another lakeside village, Kussnacht, on the far side of the town of Lucerne. The King was at the wheel, the Queen beside him and their chauffeur in the rear seat. A second car, containing four members of the King’s staff followed.\n\nBy 10.00 am they had passed through Lucerne and the road ahead was straight and empty of other traffic. Their speed was not much more than 30 mph.\n\nSuddenly the King’s car mounted the footpath and began to lurch out of control. It careered along the footpath, then plunged down an embankment, where it struck two trees. At the first impact the Queen was thrown out and at the second the King was flung clear. The car finished in the lake, but fortunately the chauffeur passenger escaped.\n\nKing Leopold staggered to his feet, dazed and bewildered, as the second royal car drove and spilled out distraught passengers. They all reached the Queen together and, kneeling beside her, Leopold cradled her head in his arms. There, a few minutes later, the lovely Astrid died of a fractured skull.\n\nWhat had happened; no one was ever sure. When the car was raised from the lake it had a burst tyre: otherwise it was mechanically perfect. Had the King’s attention been distracted, causing him to lose control? It seemed unlikely, since there was plenty of road, the car was not travelling fast, and the King was an experienced driver.\n\nIf, momentarily, the car had strayed from the road and then its tyre had burst, that would have been enough to plunge it down the embankment. But the simplicity, the unlikelihood of the accident, was baffling.\n\nAnd its result struck a numbed Belgium like a thunderbolt. People wept in the streets when the news was announced and listened again and again in disbelief to the radio broadcasts. A few days later the whole nation stopped for Astrid’s funeral, grieving with the King who, his arm strapped to a broken rib, walked, head bowed, behind the Queen’s coffin through the streets of Brussels.\n\nLater, loyal Belgians marked the place where Astrid died by building the chapel by the lake. Today thousands of visitors on the road from Lucerne to Kussnacht stop their cars and walk across to the small simple building. A machine in the subway dispenses post-cards bearing a portrait of Astrid, her close-cut blond hair waved in the style of the nineteen-thirties. For a moment, it seems that time has stood still.\n\nMore tragedy was yet to come. A year after Astrid’s death Leopold was embroiled in a desperate political situation. It was evident that Nazi Germany’s power was rising rapidly, while Belgium, committed by treaties signed after the First World Way to siding with the Allies, was highly vulnerable to attack. In 1936, therefore, Leopold withdrew from these pacts and tried to re-establish the country’s neutrality.\n\nIt was an impossible position to maintain. Just before the start of the Second World War, Leopold and Queen Wilhelmina of Holland made a joint effort to discuss the political situation with Hitler. It was curtly refused.\n\nBelgium’s darkest hour came on May 10, 1940, when the Nazi hordes swept across the country and occupied it. Leopold placed himself at the head of his army, as his father had done before him, but on May 28 he surrendered, exposing the British and French armies on the Continent to grave danger. It was an act which was to cost him dearly.\n\nBelgian royalists believed that the King had acted sincerely, and indeed he had informed the Allies of his intention the day before the surrender. Unfortunately, the British and French army commanders never received the message and the Germans gained a position of strength that Belgian resistance would have denied them.\n\nIn November, 1940, Leopold paid a visit to Hitler. He was afterwards kept a semiprisoner in his Brussels palace until, when the Allies landed in France on D-Day, he was taken to Germany.\n\nA year later the war ended. And now it was clear that many Belgians, convinced that the King had let them down, did not want him back. Leopold lived for a time in Austria and Switzerland, but refused to abdicate, claiming he was innocent not only of collaborating with the Germans, but also of lack of wisdom in his actions during the war.\n\nIn Belgium the question of Leopold’s future was becoming acutely embarrassing. For six years the political parties argued bitterly over the King. Then, in 1950, a national referendum, in which all the voters took part, was called.\n\nIn the referendum nearly 58 per cent of the people voted for the King’s recall, but the Socialist Party, who had a third of the seats in both houses of parliament, had already announced that if the vote in favour of the King’s recall was less than 66 per cent they would actively resist Leopold’s return.\n\nWhat was to be done? Could Leopold lose his crown by such a hair’s breadth? At last the King took the decision in his own hands. He handed over his powers to his son Baudouin in August, 1950, and the following year he abdicated.\n\nToday, almost forgotten in the world outside Belgium, the country of his tragic reign, Leopold the Third lives in exile near Vienna with his second wife, Princess Lilliane de Rethy. And his son Baudouin reigns in a city which is the centre of the new United Europe – the countries of the Common Market."
