        "text": "CHAPTER 8\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nTHE ROYAL QUESTION left bitterness not only among the Belgian people but also in the young Prince who had become a king in spite of himself. Among the people, the alienation was not simply between the Flemings on the one hand and the Walloons and citizens of Brussels on the other. In the capital and in each of the provinces there were Catholics, Socialists, and Liberals on both sides of the question, and divisions could be found even within families. The Belgians say that the royal question was to Belgium what the Dreyfus case was to France, and they tell of fathers who refused to speak to sons, and brothers who became estranged because of their attitudes toward Leopold.\n\nThe Prince, in 1950 a twenty-year-old man who had known only imprisonment and exile since he was ten, felt hatred toward those Belgians who had repudiated his father and who had turned so venomously against the Princess Liliane whom he loved as his mother. The years of confinement and exile had drawn the royal family closer together than possibly it would have been under normal circumstances, and the Prince considered himself the usurper of the place deserved by his father. As a result, few changes were made at Laeken following the abdication. Ex-King Leopold, his wife, and their family remained in the palace, and the young King continued to live in the quarters which had been his when he was a child. Leopold’s entourage became Baudouin’s entourage, and for all practical purposes, Leopold remained King. During the first years of his reign, Baudouin never allowed the people to forget this.\n\nThere was political estrangement, too, between King Baudouin and the leaders of the major political parties, but strangely enough, Baudouin vented his anger not against the Socialists and the Liberals who had led the opposition against his father, but against the Catholics who Baudouin felt had forsaken the ex-King. The relationship was friendly between Baudouin and the Socialist Achille Van Acker, who became prime minister in 1954 and headed the Government until 1958. On the other hand, Baudouin completely ignored the Catholics and refused to receive in audience some members of the P.S.C. Nevertheless, when the Catholic Gaston Eyskens again became prime minister in 1958, a détente was reached, and the Catholics tried to re-establish harmony between the party and the Sovereign. It is probably because of this that the Catholics allowed Baudouin considerable independence of action, and the King took full advantage of this generosity. It must be quickly pointed out, however, that it was not mere generosity on the part of the Government, because the latitude allowed Baudouin extended only to problems of the Congo, an area where the kings have traditionally played a much more significant role than in either domestic or international affairs.1\n\nOn three occasions after 1958 Baudouin was active in Congolese affairs. Following the uprisings in Leopoldville on January 4, 1959, it was the King and not the Cabinet who told the country in a radio address on January 13 that it would soon have to consider independence for the colony. Only a few of the ministers knew what the King would say in his speech, and although these few were sufficient to take responsibility, it is significant that it was Baudouin who first spoke of independence.2 Afterward, it was Baudouin who successfully opposed the removal of Governor-General Cornélis, whose policies many of the ministers no longer favored. Finally, the King surprised the Government (again, only a few knew of his plans) by flying to the Congo in January, 1960, at a time when most of the ministers feared for the King’s safety should he travel in the colony, and were concerned politically lest his presence lead to demands which might worsen the already sensitive relations between the Congo and the mother country. The opposition notwithstanding, Baudouin insisted that he was insufficiently informed by his entourage and wanted to see for himself.\n\nBy the end of the 1950’s the Belgians began to realize that Baudouin was becoming a king in his own right. After almost ten years, it appeared that he was beginning to enjoy his role as sovereign and to appreciate the importance of it. In the relationship between Sovereign and subjects, the turning point was Baudouin’s trip to the United States in May, 1959. The King showed to the Americans a side of his personality that the Belgians had never seen before. Baudouin laughed in public for the first time; he received the press for the first time; for the first time he talked to the “man in the street” and moved among many levels of society. He danced, went to parties, and met movie stars. He had what appeared to be a tremendously good time, while at the same time he impressed the American people with his dignity and wisdom. The American senators and representatives will probably long remember Baudouin’s sobering observation made in a speech to a joint session of Congress. In his appeal for world peace, he commented that it took twenty years to make a man but only twenty seconds to destroy him.\n\nThe Belgians were happy about Baudouin’s reception in the United States, but they also were a bit dismayed. Had their King displayed a personality reserved only for strangers? Perhaps, as the Belgians came to realize, the strangers had been warmer to Baudouin than his people had been, and he in turn had responded to that warmth. Not to be outdone, the Belgians gave the King a frantic welcome home. Hundreds of thousands lined the streets of Brussels to see him and to cover him with shouts of praise and bouquets of flowers. It appeared at last that the bitterness left by the royal question was beginning to pass, and to add to the good feeling, Leopold announced that he, the Princess Liliane, and their children were moving from Laeken to a château on the other side of Brussels.\n\nArmed with the growing good will of his people and the sense of authority that his part in the Congo affair had given him, would Baudouin forget the lesson of the royal affair? There is evidence that the King would not or could not. An incident regarding the King’s brother Albert showed to what degree the King’s will was still able to withstand public pressure. In April, 1959, Albert became engaged to the Italian Princess Paola Ruffo di Calabria, and Pope John XXIII agreed to marry them. Without consulting his ministers the King announced that the marriage would take place at St. Peter’s in the Vatican. The Belgians were disappointed. There had been no royal spectacle since the marriage of Leopold III to Princess Astrid in 1926, and there had been no gaiety at Laeken since her death in 1935. Now, the people were to be deprived of this wedding. The Socialists took up the opposition and gave it a constitutional basis. Belgian law requires that the civil marriage ceremony precede the religious, but since there was no civil law in the Vatican, the marriage would be imperfect under Belgian law. The Vatican answered that Vatican City was also a state and that consequently the marriage would carry civil sanction, but the Socialists were not convinced and refused to reconsider. At this point, June, 1959, the Vatican resolved what threatened to become another impasse between clericals and anticlericals by withdrawing its invitation. King Baudouin argued no further and announced that the ceremony would be performed in Brussels. (This was a minor issue but one which clearly demonstrated the nature of the relationship between sovereign and government.)\n\nThe royal question confirmed once and for all the principle that the king reigns but does not rule. Except in those areas in which the king is granted or allowed a degree of independent action, he has only three rights: the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn. If, in the execution of these rights, he is opposed by his government, he must give way to it. Regarding the Belgian king’s right personally to command his troops in battle, a commission appointed by the Ministry of Justice reported in July, 1949, that this would never happen again because of the nature of modern warfare; future wars would be waged by experts not by executives. Only in dealing with the Congo did the king retain after 1950 discretion which could lead to conflict, but as this study is being completed in the summer of 1960, the Congo has already become an independent nation. Consequently there is now no area of traditional discretion open to the Belgian king, and he reigns today under the Constitution as interpreted in the light of the outcome of the royal question. It is significant that the Constitution remains exactly as it was before the royal affair. There have been no amendments to codify any particular alteration in the power of the king. The change has come about by means of a political process which sanctioned the evolved custom. With the Constitution unchanged, the area in which the King could use his authority remains as broad as ever, but because nothing has been specifically limited, everything has been tacitly circumscribed. This result was not deliberately planned, but this is the situation as it now exists.\n\nIn the first chapter of this study, it was stated that a strong king was needed to unify the Belgian people, yet today the power of the king has been greatly weakened. Does this mean that national unity will suffer as a result? Such a development seems unlikely. Fortunately, the internal factors which have contributed to disunity have lost strength in the past few years. In 1958 the major political parties agreed on a pacte scolaire which settled for the next twelve years the dispute over the problem of state aid to Catholic schools.3 The bitterness over the royal question becomes milder as the years pass and Baudouin gains the deeper affection of his people. Moreover, international affairs are contributing to a sense of national unity. Incivisme appears less important today when the former great antagonists, France and Germany, seek a rapprochement. The Belgian people will be forced to rally all their strength as they seek to adjust to the loss of the Congo. They can no longer afford to let petty internal division sap the energy which must be centered elsewhere, particularly on economic survival. Finally, Belgium’s role in the vanguard of the “new Europe,” her hope that the economic organizations of which she is now an enthusiastic member (e.g., the European Coal and Steel Community, Euratom, and the European Economic Community) will lead to a political federation of western Europe, is forcing upon her a reappraisal of her own disunity. Belgians cannot expect to live comfortably with their neighbors if they cannot live comfortably with each other.\n\nWill the monarchy become unnecessary as the Belgians draw closer together? Closeness does not eliminate difference; it only alters the mentality in which that difference is accepted. Belgium remains divided into two proud groups, neither of which by itself is Belgium. The phenomenon of national unity manifests itself solely in the person of the king. With national unity the king becomes the symbol of mutual pride that draws the Walloons and the Flemings together and ceases to be the symbol and the referee of the antagonisms which have historically pulled them apart.\n\nIf we accept Ernest Barker’s definition that democracy is not a solution but a means of seeking a solution, a means of nonviolent choice between alternatives, then the ultimate resolution of the royal question was not in the spirit of democracy.4 The end was democratic because it removed power from the hands of one and distributed it more equally into the hands of several, yet the means used were not democratic if we are willing to agree that revolution, including civil war, is not the ultimate alternative in the game of democratic politics. If, however, one of the parties in the game of democratic politics, even if that party represents the majority, is so unwilling to compromise and flouts the rules which protect the minority, does not that minority have the right to resist, and if pushed to the limit, to rebel? An affirmative answer may be given if the minority fears that its existence as a minority is threatened by the action of the majority, or if the “rules of the game” itself are being altered by the majority without the consent of the minority.\n\nAt the time when the royal question came to a head, the minority—composed of Socialists, Liberals, and Communists, but represented primarily by the Socialists—feared that both these possibilities would become actualities. The consultation of January, 1950, had shown that the anti-Leopold bloc was in the minority, but only by a small percentage, and the elections of June, 1950, were won by the Catholic pro-Leopold forces by a popular vote of only 47 per cent, yet a percentage which gave them an absolute majority in Parliament. Thus the Left anti-Leopold bloc feared that if the Catholics, who were primarily Flemish, carried the day in regard to the royal question it would set a precedent whereby a mere majority could always govern. With Flanders containing the majority of Belgians, the Walloons feared for their political life.\n\nAt the same time a solution of the royal question favorable to Leopold would have changed the “rules of the game” of the Belgian monarchy as it had come gradually to be modified since 1831 under the influence of universal suffrage and responsible political parties. While a pro-Leopold solution of the royal question would not have involved any direct modification of the Constitution, Leopold’s return would have declared that under the Constitution a king could espouse and follow a policy which had been rejected by responsible ministers. If Parliament could not decide between king and cabinet the final voice would always be that of Parliament and ultimately that of the people. Nevertheless, the workings of a modern constitutional monarchy would have been seriously threatened irrespective of who had the final voice. The Socialists, who had for years been seeking to reduce the king to a figurehead, could not have tolerated such a solution, and the Catholics acted in complete disregard for historical change and commonly accepted “rules of the game” by insisting on such a solution.\n\nWhy had the major antagonists reached such an impasse by midsummer of 1950? The answer to this question, the reader should recall, has been suggested in Chapter 1. A modern constitutional monarch is the embodiment of historical continuity and national self-identification, but he functions successfully in this capacity only if there already exists a tradition common to each of his subjects and if the people, of which he is the reflection, are whole and able to be mirrored in a single, undistorted image. The monarch, in other words, is the result, not the cause of homogeneity and consensus. The question of consensus is at the center of the royal question. For the average Belgian, the affair focused all the other issues over which there was lack of harmony in Belgian society—the ethnic, linguistic, religious, and economic problems discussed in earlier chapters.\n\nThose who drew up the Constitution in 1831 knew that because of disparate and antagonistic elements within Belgian society, political agreement would be almost impossible over certain sensitive issues, and no accommodation in Parliament based exclusively on a free acceptance of the “rules of the game” would be sufficient to counterbalance this lack of concordance within the society itself. As a substitute for the lack of consensus in both society and Parliament, the king of the Belgians was given considerable power under the Constitution. He thus occupied a unique position; he represented the societal unity which would be nonexistent without him, and he was granted sufficient power to maintain and propel the unity he embodied.\n\nThe reader saw in earlier chapters that as new groups began to enter political life, they demanded an increasingly larger share of power. This increase was made possible in part by decreasing the power of the king. At the same time, however, a weakened king would have to be counterbalanced by a stronger legislature. A strong legislature under the parliamentary system demands that the “rules of the game”—the procedural rules of Parliament, particularly the basic rules of discussion and compromise—be firmly entrenched and fully respected. But if compromise within Parliament is to be tolerated and respected, the elements of division within society cannot be too deep. In speaking of what we would call today consensus among the British, Lord Balfour once remarked that the British people were so fundamentally at one that they could safely afford to bicker. This was not true of the Belgians in the years which preceded the royal question. The historic elements of disunity were maintained, and, if we consider the friction between Walloons and Flemings between 1920 and 1940, those elements were strengthened. In short, no change could come about which would result in greater agreement in Parliament until the elements of consensus within society were strengthened.\n\nGiven the above considerations, there could be no solution short of revolution if ever the conflicting elements in Belgian society were unwilling to compromise on a particular issue. This is what happened in the royal affair. Civil war did not break out only because one party gave way before the threat of force by another. Yet what did the royal affair prove regarding national consensus if unity was the result of coercion? It demonstrated that force, though it cannot compel consensus, can shock a nation into the realization that the only alternative to agreement on fundamental issues is a breakdown in that society’s governing machinery. This is the same alternative which presented itself to the second Austrian Republic after World War II. In 1934, because of lack of consensus among the ruling elements in Austrian society, the republic was dissolved and replaced by a dictatorship. Learning a lesson from the destruction of Austrian democracy in 1933–1934 the historic enemies, the Socialists and the Christian-Social Conservatives, have ruled in coalition since 1945. They have done so not because they trust each other but simply because the one will not trust the other to rule alone. Nevertheless, the shock of what happened in 1933–1934 has at least produced a going political concern.5\n\nThree sets of circumstances seem to point to a solution of the problem of consensus in the Belgian polity and society. There is, first of all, the realization of how close the country had come to civil war and disintegration. Next, there is the evidence on the part of the numerical minority of 1950 of how far it is prepared to let the other camp proceed with the modification of certain “rules of the game.” Finally, there are forces at work which tend both to unify Belgium internally and to integrate her into a wider European community. The continued industrialization of Belgium and the general modernization of many western European societies contribute to the continued lessening of the traditional ethnic, religious, and linguistic cleavages. This has been happening in France as well as in Belgium. Furthermore, Belgium’s enthusiastic participation in common European institutions has forced the people, as was pointed out above, to bury their internal differences and bend their efforts to the common European enterprise.\n\nBut even without the help of any of these forces and events, the royal question, by forcing Belgians to consider the costs of disunity, has caused them to clarify the limits of agreement and disagreement and has thereby strengthened the cohesion of Belgian society and stabilized the political process."
