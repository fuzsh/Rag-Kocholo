        "meta_description": "This photo shows perhaps the most controversial tomb in the Belgian royal pantheon in Brussels. King Leopold III (1901-1983) was a controversial monarch to start with. He was accused of being a Nazi collaborator in the Second World War when he surrendered his country to Germany in 1940, and when he later returned to Belgium in 1950 he was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Baudouin. Before these events, his saving grace had been his very popular and beautiful wife, Queen Astrid of Sweden, but unfortunately she died in a road accident in 1938 (in a car driven by Leopold). He remarried in 1941 to a commoner named Lilian Baels, but due to the marriage's unpopularity she was never allowed the title of Queen. At her death, although she expressed a wish to be buried separately, Lilian was interred by the Belgian Royal Family together with her husband and his first wife, creating the strange entombed threesome seen in this photo. Queen Astrid's own photo is on the left on the tomb, Lilian's is on the right. The Belgian Royal Crypt is part of the church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels.",
