        "text": "A return to Westeros is imminent with the second season of Max’s House of the Dragon arriving this summer. The prequel series, based on George R. R .Martin’s Song of Ice and Fire book series — specifically Fire & Blood, tells the story of the Targaryen lineage alongside the familys Hightower and Velaryon.\n\nSet 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, the story of House Targaryen unfolded over some major time jumps in the first season, transporting back between young versions of characters and their adult counterparts.\n\nWhen does House of the Dragon Season 2 premiere?\n\nHouse of the Dragon Season 2 premieres Sunday, June 16 at 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time.\n\nHow many episodes are in House of the Dragon Season 2?\n\nSeason 2 will contain eight episodes. Season 1 unfolded in 10 episodes.\n\nAre new episodes weekly or all at once? What time are they streaming on Max?\n\nNew episodes will arrive every Sunday after the first episode of Season 2 premieres June 16. They will be available to watch on HBO and stream on Max at 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time Sunday nights through August 4 when the finale arrives.\n\nRELATED: ‘House Of The Dragon’ Renewed For Season 3 By HBO\n\nHere’s the full House of the Dragon Sesaon 2 release schedule:\n\nSunday, June 16: Episode 1\n\nSunday, June 23: Episode 2\n\nSunday, June 30: Episode 3\n\nSunday, July 7: Episode 4\n\nSunday, July 14: Episode 5\n\nSunday, July 21: Episode 6\n\nSunday, July 28: Episode 7\n\nSunday, August 4: Episode 8 (Finale)\n\nRELATED: ‘House Of The Dragon’ Official Trailer Revealed; “F–k Dignity. I Want Revenge’\n\nWhat is House of the Dragon Season 2 about?\n\nSeason 2 will challenge viewers to pick a side in the ongoing civil war, known as the Dance of the Dragons, between the Green and Black Councils, who stand behind King Aegon and Queen Rhaenyra, respectively. The two figures will go head to head for the Iron Throne, each with a claim to rule Westeros with their lineage and descent.\n\nWith an early renewal of the Game of Thrones prequel for a third season before Season 2 even drops, the plot will likely thicken in a full-blown war full of more epic dragon battles.\n\nWho is in House of the Dragon Season 2?\n\nSeason two returning cast is Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, Emma D’Arcy, Eve Best, Steve Toussaint, Fabien Frankel, Ewan Mitchell, Tom Glynn-Carney, Sonoya Mizuno, and Rhys Ifans.
