        "text": "THE POKER GAME STARTS AT 7:30 EVERY WEDNESDAY night. It ends, David Mamet says, any time between 1:30 A.M. and noon Thursday. The men eat ham sandwiches, drink beer and smoke a lot of cigars, and thousands of dollars move across the table. But if this sounds like a typical card game, it has its peculiarities. The regulars include a painter, a film professor and, in Mamet, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. And their conversation, for all the usual bluffing and cussing, often turns to art or literature or organic gardening.\n\nIf one can know a man by his rituals, then the poker night reveals something essential about David Mamet. His card game, like his writing, like his life, brings an intellectual sensibility to a working-class world. Mamet employs Aristotle's rules of drama to write about petty thieves and sleazy salesmen; he composes free verse out of grunts, sighs, obscenities and sentence fragments. In both his stark writing style and his fascination with the male tribe - whether aboard ship in ''Lakeboat'' or on the make in ''Sexual Perversity in Chicago'' - Mamet resembles Ernest Hemingway more, perhaps, than any writer of his generation.\n\nOver the last decade, Mamet has proved as prolific and as successful as any American playwright. After bursting onto the scene as a wunderkind with ''American Buffalo'' - written and produced in 1975, when he was 27 - he has demonstrated a staying power rare in a field of fickle acclaim. Mamet endured some critical doubts in mid-career over plays like ''The Woods,'' ''Lone Canoe'' and ''Edmond,'' but he continued to write every day in his workmanlike way - if not a play, then an essay; if not an essay, then a magazine article; if not an article, then a letter to his sister. ''The idea that one can become a better writer, a more famous writer, a richer writer, has been the ruination of many many writers,'' Mamet says, ''and I do not plan to be one. It's like a guy who makes chairs. It's something I can do and I can do well. And obviously if I keep at it, within the limits of the form, I should get better at it in small increments. But the important thing is not my becoming a better chair maker, but the chair. You don't become better in general, the chairs become better.'' In the last three years, Mamet's regimen has yielded the highly regarded screenplay for ''The Verdict'' and the caustic comedy ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' for which he won both the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award as the best American play of 1984. He won Tony nominations last year for both ''Glengarry'' as the best drama and ''American Buffalo'' as the best revival, a rare achievement. This year, Mamet has renewed his traditional ties to the Goodman Theater in Chicago. The theater staged his adaptation of Chekhov's ''The Cherry Orchard'' in March. Mamet's latest plays, the one-act dramas ''The Shawl'' and ''The Spanish Prisoner,'' began performances two days ago at the Goodman's New Theater Company - an offshoot devoted to new American plays - and a revival of ''The Water Engine'' is to begin Friday on the Goodman's main stage. It amounts to a Chicago Mamet festival. That is appropriate, for there is no better place to begin to talk about Mamet than Chicago. He grew up there, and references to the city pervade his plays. In the Goodman Theater and in its artistic director, Gregory Mosher - who has directed all but one of Mamet's 12 plays at the Goodman - Mamet has found a security few playwrights enjoy. Although Mamet now divides his time between a Chelsea town house and a Vermont farm, he still belongs to the lineage of Chicago writers. He echoes their direct style and their loathing of pretense. His street denizens recall Saul Bellow's Augie March and James T. Farrell's Studs Lonigan. Whenever Mamet eats at the Berghoff Res taurant, near the Goodman, he wonders if it was the restaurant that Hurstwood managed in Theodore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie.''\n\nIt seems logical that if Mosher becomes the artistic director of the Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi Newhouse Theaters, at Lincoln Center - he has been offered the position - Mamet's plays will have their premieres in New York. But that would not make Mamet any less of a Chicago writer, for more than sharing a landscape with his literary forebears, Mamet shares a state of mind. ''It carries with it a certain intolerance for the purely ornamental,'' he says of the Chicago literary tradition, ''and a great support for the idea of brashness and the application of the individual intellect. Chicago is: 'Have a good time, get a girl, have a beer.' There's also the idea of completion, of production. You don't have guys sitting around in cafes with cigarettes trembling - 'Oh, my God, I'm a writer, but I can't write.' Well, in Chicago, the answer is, 'Go home, you sissy. If you're a writer, write.' ''\n\nHemingway, too, was a Chicago writer. That he has fallen into a certain disrepute - too macho for the age of feminists and the ''sensitive man'' - makes the parallel with Mamet even more apt. At 37, Mamet seems part of his generation only by the accident of birth date. He has rejected both the suburban experience of the 1950's and the counterculture of the 60's, embracing instead the sort of life to which Hemingway's Nick Adams might have aspired. With his broad chest and round shoulders, his down vest and his close- cropped black hair, Mamet looks more like a millwright than a playwright. He fires pistols, chops wood, lifts weights and builds stone fences. At the poker table, Mamet is known as an aggressor, a man who wants to win, his friends say, not for money as much as for the sake of competition. AT A TIME WHEN HIS contemporaries in theater often turn to Freudian exploration of family themes, Mamet writes out of a wider set of experiences. ''Glengarry'' derives from a job in a high-pressure real-estate office, ''Lakeboat'' from a summer on a Great Lakes ore boat, ''American Buffalo'' from a series of poker games with the ex-convicts who frequented a Chicago junk shop.\n\nMamet stands apart from many of his peers not only as an experiential writer, but as a self-taught one. Mamet initially wanted to become an actor and when he was 20 started writing scenes for himself and friends to practice. Within four years, he had formed a theater company, the St. Nicholas, and had become its resident playwright. ''I never really wanted to be a writer,'' he says. ''I never spent any conscious time devoted to the philosophy or technique of writing until I'd been writing for a long time. Sherwood Anderson talks in one of his stories about how he was writing advertising copy for a living and one day he just started writing a story instead. And he looked at it and said, 'My God, that's writing. I can do that. How about that.' ''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
