        "text": "House of the Dragon season 3 has been confirmed, and after that season 2 finale, it seems like there's a lot of conflict on the way. It was quite the dramatic end for the latest episode too as several scenes were leaked online before the air date. However, now it has finally been released and we know just what the impact those dragonseeds will have on the world of Westeros.\n\nThe announcement that the fantasy hit was coming back for season 3 was made back in June, and there have been some teases already about what to expect. So if you're keen to know what's next for one of the best TV shows on screen today, then you're in the right place. Below we've got the lowdown on the House of the Dragon season 3 release date, cast, plot, as well as some exclusive insight from the creators.\n\nBeware though, we will be getting into big spoilers for the House of the Dragon season 2 finale below. Read our House of the Dragon season 2 ending explained for more details.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, why not check out our guide to all the other new TV shows on the way in 2024 and beyond.\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 3 doesn't currently have a release date. Work has already started on the stories and scripts, but it seems logical to assume we'll have a big gap before we see new episodes.\n\nThe scale of the Game of Thrones prequel is huge, which means it takes a long time to film. Between season 1 and season 2, there was a gap of two years. If we follow a similar pattern with season 3, it seems likely we'll get it at some point in 2026. We'd expect a summer release too, to match the previous two seasons.\n\nWe will have some more Thrones before then though â€“ A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is currently filming, and we've even had a first-look image.\n\nIs House of the Dragon season 3 the final season?\n\nThe short answer is we don't yet know. Nothing has been renewed beyond season 3 yet, but the showrunners have previously shared their hopes for around 3-4 seasons to tell this story in its entirety. Based on where we are currently in relation to 'Fire and Blood', we're actually a fair amount through.\n\nAlthough, while we won't get into book spoilers, there are some huge battles on the way. Given the pace of the show so far, our best bet is that we've got two more seasons to get to the end of this story. Watch this space.\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 3 cast\n\nUnlike season 1, the House of the Dragon cast stayed pretty stable throughout the second season. There were some big causalities, mind - including Eve Best's Rhaenys and some of the younger Targaryens (thanks to Blood and Cheese, need we say more?)\n\nThis all means we have a pretty solid idea about who might appear in the third season. Check out our full predicted list below.\n\nMatt Smith as Daemon Targaryen\n\nEmma D'Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen\n\nOlivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower\n\nTom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen\n\nEwan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen\n\nFabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole\n\nRhys Ifans as Ser Otto Hightower\n\nMatthew Needham as Lord Larys Strong\n\nSteve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon\n\nSonoya Mizuno as Mysaria\n\nPhia Saban as Helaena Targaryen\n\nHarry Collett as Jacaerys Velaryon\n\nAbubakar Salim as Alyn of Hull\n\nClinton Liberty as Addam of Hull\n\nBethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen\n\nPhoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen\n\nKieran Bew as Hugh Hammer\n\nJefferson Hall as Jason/Tyland Lannister\n\nGayle Rankin as Alys Rivers\n\nFreddie Fox as Gwayne Hightower\n\nTom Bennett as Ulf White\n\nSimon Russell Beale as Simon Strong\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 3 plot\n\nThe season 2 finale of House of the Dragon set up some very key plot points to resolve when it returns. The main narrative thread was all leading to the big battle on the way across Westeros. From where we leave things, Rhaenyra has the clear advantage thanks to her dragonseeds. This means, that after Daemon bent the knee, she has seven dragons (potentially eight if Rhaena manages to secure Sheepstealer).\n\nHer fighters are preparing to make the approach on King's Landing where Alicent has told them that they'll be allowed in to take control of the city. However, we're not totally sure that it will all go as smoothly as that... In the final moments we see Aegon and Larys heading out of the city, Helaena all but agreeing to mount her dragon, and the Tyland Lannister's new fleet on their way.\n\nAemond and Vhagar have their eye on Harrenhal too, and we know better than to bet against Vhagar...\n\nIs there a House of the Dragon season 3 trailer?\n\nThere's no trailer yet for House of the Dragon season 3 as filming has yet to begin. We don't expect we'll see one for a while yet either. Keep this page handy for when we do though."
