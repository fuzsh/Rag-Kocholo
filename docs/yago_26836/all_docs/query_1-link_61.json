A watershed film for me at age 19, when I'd only been watching art films for a couple of years; can't be very objective about it now, though I've always had issues with Crouse's robotic performance and with pretty much every scene not directly related to the long con. Also, while this doesn't invalidate anything that happens (because why would Dr. Margaret Ford know these details? I didn't back then), the poker-game scam is hilarious from the perspective of a knowledgeable poker player, as (a) nobody would ever be permitted to leave",

A watershed film for me at age 19, when I'd only been watching art films for a couple of years; can't be very objective about it now, though I've always had issues with Crouse's robotic performance and with pretty much every scene not directly related to the long con. Also, while this doesn't invalidate anything that happens (because why would Dr. Margaret Ford know these details? I didn't back then), the poker-game scam is hilarious from the perspective of a knowledgeable poker player, as (a) nobody would ever be permitted to leave the room in the middle of a hand during a high-stakes game, even if they were about to wet their pants, and (b) you can't bet someone out just by having more money on the table (or off the table) than they do. For you young people: Imagine this movie as your very first experience of Ricky Jay. A calendar-marker, that."
