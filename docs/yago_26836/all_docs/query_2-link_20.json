        "text": "A CurtainUp Feature: Playwrights Album\n\nAn Overview of David Mamet's Career\n\nBy Elyse Sommer\n\nMarch 4, 2017 Update. I last updated this backgrounder in nine years ago. That was when two major revivals of David Mamet's plays (Speed-the-Plow, which last season also had a high profile production in London, and American Buffalo) were on Broadway and another (Oleana) headed there. Mamet was clearly more than ever a superstar. Revivals of his plays, in their original permutations were a ticket to fame, now had no problem casting actors with ticket selling marquee names. And a new Mamet play like his November, even if bottom rather than top drawer, could open on Broadway and stay afloat for a reasonably successful stay.\n\nI can't think of a living playwright who's as prolific and in so many areas of the cultural spectrum, except perhaps the late Harold Pinter.\n\nAt age 60, Mamet's creative biological clock was still ticking. I consequently anticipated that this chapter of our Playwrights Album would continue to require updates for new works as well as noteworthy revivals.\n\nPlays like Speed-the-Plow and the Pulitzer Prize winning Glen Garry Glen Ross fit the present as much, if not more, than when written. Not unimportantly, they are structured to fit the economic realities of today's theater (small casts, one-unit sets) which makes them viable for regional as well as Broadway and London productions.\n\nLike the ever-popular G.B. Shaw, Mamet's ouevre could be divided into Plays Pleasant and Plays Unpleasant. Unpleasant ones: \"Cryptogram,\" \"The Old Neighborhood\" - are close-to-the-bone, dead serious and shattering. Even without the wit, they could not have been written by anyone else.\n\nSadly, as I write this update, Mamet's glory days seem to be over. Though his influence on other playwrights remains inestimable, but that famous Mamet-speak rhythm seems to have entrapped him in his self-created linguistic maze and has many of his fans wondering if he's been done in by too much imitation? I think his instantly recognizable and uniquely memorable style and characters will never really lose that special cachet, but Mr. Mamet is now in \"3 strikes and you're out\" free fall with two Broadway flops, and a new play back at his home base, the Atlantic Theater.\n\nDespite Debra Winger and Patti Lupone above the marque of his 2012 play The Anarchist, it was practically dead on revival, with its closing notice pasted in less than a month.\n\nTwo seasons ago, China Doll, which arrived on Broadway with the double cachet of Mamet and Al Pacino two seasons ago, was less depressing and more entertaining than The Anarchist but again sub-prime Mamet. And though even Pacino was hardly at his best, to his many fans he was a must-see, so that play fared a bit better at the box office.\n\nIt is with genuine sorrow that The Penitent, which prompts this update, though better than the truly awful Anarchist, is not a triumphant homecoming to the theater Mr. Mamet co-founded. Frankly, it's not really a play, but a series of arguments designed to stick it to the unethical behavior in the legal, psychiatric, media and religious community. I'm not sure if the now 70-year old Mr. Mamet can have another epiphany down the road, abandoning his frankly boring conservative drum pounding for the vibrant Mametism on which his large fan base was built.\n\nTopics Covered\n\nPersonal Statistics\n\nChronology of Produced Plays\n\nTrademarks Of Mamet's Plays\n\nMamet and the Silver Screen\n\nLinks To Plays We've Reviewed and Books you Might Want to Read\n\nQuotes From Mamet's Plays\n\nPersonal Statistics\n\nDavid Mamet wears many hats: Actor, director, novelist, poet, essayist, playwright and screenwriter. He writes for children as well as adults and has taught at his alma mater, Goddard, at the Yale Drama School and New York University and at the Atlantic Theater's school which he helped to found.\n\nHe was born in Chicago on November 30, 1947 into a troubled family, with the parents divorcing when Mamet and his sisters were children. The residues of bitterness and anger from this difficult childhood later found their way into his plays, in which aggressive impulses were transformed into art.\n\nAfter attending Goddard College in Vermont Mamet got his theatrical feet wet with the Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theater in New York. He was an actor and director first. As a playwright he achieved his first success with The Duck Variations, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, and American Buffalo -- all opening in Off-Broadway venues and aptly part of the 1999-2000 season honoring his work at the Atlantic Theater.\n\nHis many honors include: The Joseph Jefferson Award (1974), Obie Award (1976, 1983), New York Drama Critics Circle Award (1977, 1984), Outer Circle Award (1978), Society of West End Theatre Award (1983), Pulitzer Prize (1984), Dramatists Guild Hall-Warriner Award (1984), American Academy Award, (1986). On June 6, 2005 the revival of the Pulitzer Prize winning Glen Garry Glen Ross collected a Tony Award for Best Revival of a play.\n\nThe prolific and versatile Mamet (more than 20 plays, over a dozen film scripts, six collections of essays, two novels, a children's book)currently divides his time between homes in Vermont and Cambridge Massachussets where he lives with his wife, Rebecca Pidgeon who has appeared in his plays and films. He has three daughters -- Willa and Zosia from his marriage to another actress, Lindsay Crouse, and Clara from his current marriage.\n\nBack to the top\n\nChronology of Produced Plays\n\nThe Duck Variations and Sexual Perversity in Chicago (1976--usually paired on one bill)\n\nReunion (1977\n\nAmerican Buffalo (1976)\n\nThe Woods (1977)\n\nThe Water Engine(1977)\n\nMr. Happiness (1977)\n\nReunion (1977)\n\nA Life In the Theater (1978)\n\nLakeboat (1981)\n\nEdmond (1982) D.

As he told John Lahr in a 1997 interview \"In my family, in the days prior to television, we like to wile away theevenings by making ourselves miserable, solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously. That's probably where my ability was honed.\" At any rate, the style and rhythm of his dialogue has seeded an addition to the theatrical lexicon: Mametspeak which entails the same sort of condensation found in poetry. The lack of stage directions is yet another aspect of Mametspeak's minimalism.\n\nThe power of the playwright's characters stems from the way they reveal themselves through language that conveys its meaning as much from what is being withheld as from the words actually spoken.\n\nThe Mamet cadences have often been compared to those of Harold Pinter -- whom Mamet greatly admires and who also divides his time between stage and screen. Those who have had conversations with Mamet have noted that his own conversations tends like that of his characters to be terse and highly stylized.\n\nAnother eponymous coinage, Mametesque, is often used in relation to his demand that actors not \"act;\" in other words, that they speak their lines without analyzing and referring to other plays or films. It is an approach that tends to disorient audiences as well as actors.\n\nAs for the content, many Mamet plays deal with declining morality reflecting his view of society as a spiritual wasteland His best kown plays explore these themes through tough male macho characters -- for example the Pulitzer Prize winning Glengarry Glen Ross was set in a grungy which Chicago real estate office; Speed-the-Plow, written four years later (1988) focused on the underbelly of show business. Con artists and their games in life predominate both plays and movies -- an interest, Mamet has said dates back to when he was growing up on the north side of Chicago and was himself \"a bit of a gambler.\"\n\nBack to the top\n\nMamet and the Silver Screen\n\nMamet has been a successful screen writer since 1981 when he adapted James Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice. Other notable screenplays include The Verdict (1982), About Last Night (1986 -- a forgettable screen version of his play Sexual Perversity in Chicago ),The Untouchables (a hit update of the TV series of the same name) (1987), his adaptation of his own Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), Wag the Dog (1998).\n\nThe 1999 film The Winslow Boy marked a departure, venturing as it did into the more genteel world of Terrence Rattigan's 1948 drama -- a departure also evident in Boston Marriages which premiered in Boston in 1999 and is scheduled to go to New York.\n\nAdding to his bag of tricks, the playwright turned writer director with what has become a video rental favorite, House of Games (1987). It starred Joe Mantegna and his then wife Lindsay Crouse. Mantegna who also played a leading role in Glengarry Glen Rose, appeared again in Homicide (1991 and the film version of Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). Another play which the playwright wrote and adaptated for the screen was Oleanna (1994). He has directed five of his own film scripts. The Spanish Prisoner (1998) was, like House of Games a confidence thriller, but lighter and less doomed to end violently. The playwright-director sees the light thrillers as closer to the tradition of comedy and the film noir closer to tragedy\n\nIn 1994, Louis Malle's acclaimed Vanya on 42nd Street (1994), used Mamet's translation of Uncle Vanya ( he also translated Chekhov's Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard)\n\nBack to the top\n\nLinks To Reviews of Plays By David Mamet and Books you Might Want to Read\n\nPlay Reviews\n\nAmerican Buffalo (London 2015)\n\nAmerican Buffalo(New Jersey McCarter Theater 2010)\n\nAmerican Buffalo (Broadway 2008) American Buffalo (Atlantic Theater 2000)\n\nAmerican Buffalo (Berkshire Theater Festival 2005)\n\nAnarchist (Broadway 2012)\n\nBoston Marriage (London)\n\nBoston Marriage (New York)\n\nBoston Marriage (Los Angeles)\n\nChina Doll (Broadway 2015)\n\nThe Cryptogram (London)\n\nEdmond (London)\n\nGhost Stories: The Shawl & Prairie du Chien (2015 Off-Broadway)\n\nGlen Garry Glen Ross (Broadway Revival -- 2004-05 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play)\n\nLakeboat and Prairie du Chien (London 2011)\n\nA Life In the Theatre (London)\n\nA Life In the Theatre (Los Angeles)\n\nA Life in the Theatre( Broadway2010)\n\nNovember (Broadway 2008)\n\nThe Old Neighborhood\n\nOleana (Los Angeles Mark Taper and Broadway Golden Theater, 2009)\n\nOleana (London revival)\n\nThe Penitent(Off-Broadway2017)\n\nRace(2009)\n\nRomance (Off Broadway 2005)\n\nRomance at ART Mamet Festival (Boston 2009)\n\nSexual Perversity in Chicago and Duck Variations\n\nSexual Perversity in Chicago & The Duck Variations (Boston Mamet Festival 2009)\n\nSpeed-the-Plow (Broadway 2008\n\nSpeed-the-Plow (London Old Vic 2008) Speed-the-Plow(London 2000)\n\nSpeed the Plow/Mamet, David (Los Angeles, 2007)\n\nTwo Unrelated plays by David Mamet: Keep Your Pantheon and School (Atlantic Theater 2009)\n\nThe Water Engine/Mamet, David\n\nPublications\n\nAmerican Buffalo\n\nThe Cryptogram\n\nGoldberg Street: Short Plays and Monologues\n\nEdmond\n\nThe Frog Prince (children's) Glengarry Glen Ross\n\nGoldberg Street: Short Plays and Monologues A Life in the Theatre The Old Neighborhood: The Disappearance of the Jews, Jolly, Deeny 1998 Oleana Reunion and Dark Pony, 1990 Sexual Perversity in Chicago and The Duck Variations\n\nSpeed-The-Plow Uncle Vanya (Translation of Chekhov)\n\nThe Woods, Lakeboat, Edmond\n\nScreenplays/Television\n\nHomicide\n\nHouse of Games\n\nThe Spanish Prisoner and the Winslow Boy\n\nWe're No Angels\n\nFive Television Plays,1990\n\nEssays, Novels, Poems, Children's\n\nBar Mitzvah\n\nThe Chinaman: Poems,\n\nThe Duck and the Goat\n\nHenrietta (children's fable)\n\nThe Hero Pony: Poems\n\nJafsie and John Henry\n\nThe Cabin: Reminiscence and Diversions\n\nMake-Believe Town: Essays and Remembrances\n\nOh Hell\n\nThe Old Religion ( novel about Leo Frank, the Jewish factory manager who was falsely convicted of raping and murdering a white girl in Georgia -- also subject of the 1999 musical parade>)\n\nOn Directing Film\n\nPassover\n\nThe Shawl and Prairie Du Chien\n\nThings Change (Shel Silverstein, contributor)\n\nThree Uses of the Knife: On the Nature and Purpose of Drama, paper 2000\n\nTrue and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor\n\nWriting in Restaurants\n\nBack to the top\n\nQuotes From Plays and by Mamet\n\nFrom American Buffalo\n\nDonny: Well Bob, I'm sorry, but this isn't good enough.

The whole thing will go down. It all goes down when we have given up the things we own.\n\nAnnouncer: Another chapter, yes, of Century of Progress!/!\n\nFrom Various Interviews\n\nOn trimming his work: I'm always trying to keep it spare. For me the real division between a serious writer and an unserious one is whether they're willing to cut. -- interview with Richard Corliss Time, April 6, 1998\n\nOn why he works so hard: First, a quote from Noel Coward -- \"Work is more fun than fun\" -- with this addition from the con artist in his House of Games, \"What's more fun than human nature?\" — interview with Richard Corliss Time, April 6, 1998\n\nAbout the relationship between life and the art of theatre: It is in our nature to dramatize, — opening sentence of Three Uses of the Knife: On the Nature and Purpose of Drama\n\nOn his trademark crewcut: The crewcut is an honest haircut . . . It is the haircut of an honest, two-pair-of-jeans working man -- a man from Chicago — quoted in a New Yorker profile, Fortress Mamet, by John Lahr, November 17, 1997\n\nOn technique: The purpose of technique is to break down the barriers between the conscious and the unconscious mind.The purpose of any technique, the purpose of any skill which is learned through cognition and repetition in the arts, or in sports for that matter, is to break down the barriers between the conscious and the unconscious mind so that you don't have to think about what you're doing. You can only be free if your unconscious is unfettered. There are a lot of people who don't have technique but whose unconscious is unfettered: children, psychotics, some artists. But for most of us, we need a technique to enable us to get out of our own — from a discussion of The Old Neighborhood with acting literary Director Arthur Holmberg\n\nOn mass entertainment: I like mass entertainment. I've written mass entertainment. But it's the opposite of art because the job of mass entertainment is to cajole, seduce and flatter consumers to let them know that what they thought was right is right, and that their tastes and their immediate gratification are of the utmost concern of the purveyor. The job of the artist, on the other hand, is to say, wait a second, to the contrary, everything that we have thought is wrong. Let's reexamine it. — Richard Covington, Salon 1997\n\nOn film acting: Actors don't need to put on some extraneous character. Their character exists in the action and the words. The best actors, people like Jimmy Stewart and Anna Magnani, are not pretending to be a character; they're saying the words and letting the story tell itself. On the other hand, that's why Laurence Olivier is terrible in films. He eats up the scenery. The audience ends up paying more attention to the actor's technique than to the story. Looking for a \"character\" to imitate may be fun for the actor, but it's less fun for the audience. When you listen to Glenn Gould playing Bach, you don't say what great technique he has. You say how great Bach's music sounds. It's the same thing with film acting. — Richard Covington, Salon 1997\n\nOn stage acting: It's not the actor's job to embellish the play, but to do something more worthwhile and difficult: to resist embellishing it. It's when one resists the impulse to help that the truth emerges. The great actors I've seen in movies or on stage are capable of being quite still, and letting their uncertainty, fear and conficting desires emerge rather than trying to cover them up with their ideas. -- interview with David Gritten London Daily Telegraph, 1998.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSearch CurtainUp in the box below Back to Curtainup Main Page\n\nPLAYWRIGHTS' ALBUM INDEX\n\nEdward Albee\n\nAnnie Baker\n\nSamuel Beckett\n\nAnton Chekhov\n\nHorton Foote\n\nBrian Friel\n\nHenrik Ibsen\n\nDavid Mamet\n\nArthur Miller\n\nEugene O'Neill\n\nSuzan-Lori Parks\n\nHarold Pinter\n\nG.
