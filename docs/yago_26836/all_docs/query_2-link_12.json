        "text": "When I met David Mamet this summer, he made me the gift of a Boy Scout knife. On one side of the knife was the Scout motto: “Be prepared.” The words, which invoke both prowess and paranoia, seemed to sum up the twin themes of Mamet’s work, and of his guarded life. We were sitting in the back room of his headquarters, on the second floor of a two-story yellow clapboard building on Eliot Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at a table with a large Second World War poster hanging over it which read “Loose Talk Can Cost Lives! Keep It Under Your Stetson.” There was no identifying name on the bell to the front door or on the office door. You had to feel your way along until you found Mamet hidden away, which is how it is with him. Mamet, who is masterly at communicating his meanings in public, is prickly in private. He is a small but powerfully built man; in the stillness of his presence and in the precision of his sentences, he exudes an imposing, specific gravity. “Fortress Mamet” is how Ed Koren, the cartoonist and Mamet’s Vermont neighbor, refers to the emotional no-go area that Mamet creates around himself, and I was acutely aware of this hazardous moat as Mamet eased into a chair across the table from me, wearing his summer camouflage: a khaki baseball cap, khaki shorts, and a purple-and-brown Hawaiian shirt. Over the years, Mamet has adopted many fustian public disguises to counterpoint a personal style that Albert Takazauckas, the director of his first Off Broadway hit, “Sexual Perversity in Chicago,” in 1976, characterizes as “blunt, blunt, blunt.” He adds, “It’s his lovely cover.” As the star of Chicago’s booming Off Loop theatre scene in the early seventies, Mamet affected Che’s guerrilla look: fatigues, combat boots, a beret, and, for good measure, a cape. After his Pulitzer Prize for “Glengarry Glen Ross” (1984), his play about salesmen in a cutthroat real-estate competition, Mamet assumed a Brechtian swagger: cigar, clear plastic eyeglass frames, and open collar, which consolidated in one iconic image the powerhouse and the proletarian. Now, in his mellow middle age, Mamet has forsworn the cigar and adopted the posture of rural gent: work boots, bluejeans, Pendleton shirt, and trimmed beard. In all these guises, the one constant is Mamet’s crewcut, which dips like a tree line over the craggy promontory of his broad forehead and gives him an austere first appearance. “The crewcut . . . is an honest haircut,” he has written. “It is the haircut of an honest, two-pair-of-jeans working man—a man from Chicago.”\n\nMamet is certainly a workingman, even though, at a million and a half dollars a movie, he’s far from a wage slave. He has written twenty-two plays, six collections of essays, two novels, and fourteen films, five of which he also directed. He belongs in the pantheon of this century’s great dramatists; he has done for American theatre at the end of the century what his hero, the iconoclastic sociologist Thorstein Veblen, did for American sociology at the beginning: provide a devastating, often hilarious new idiom to dissect the follies of American life. Mamet’s muscular imagination strips dialogue of literary nicety and robs plot of that naturalistic decoration which has progressively tamed theatre. His plays, though rooted in reality, are fables, whose uniqueness lies in their distinctive music—a terse, streamlined orchestration of thought, language, and character which draws viewers in and makes them work for meaning. No other American playwright, except perhaps Tennessee Williams, has ranged so widely. (Mamet is the only major American playwright ever to succeed as a screenwriter.) Three of his movies—“The Edge” (with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin), “Wag the Dog” (with Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman), and “The Spanish Prisoner” (with Steve Martin), which he also directed—are being released this year, which turns out, on November 30th, to be his fiftieth.\n\nMamet claims he doesn’t lose his temper, but anger still defines him. “He’s a coiled snake,” his forty-six-year-old sister, the screenwriter Lynn Mamet, says. To those who have passed the test of loyalty, Mamet is an amusing, endearing, vigilant friend. “He was and continues to be one of the funniest and silliest people I’ve ever met,” says the comedian Jonathan Katz, who has been Mamet’s best friend since their days at Goddard College, in Vermont, and with whom Mamet conceived the film “House of Games.” “He was a master of disguises. We would have this running gag. Whenever one of us was meeting the other guy at the airport, we would be in disguise. One of my favorite disguises was when he was sitting in the airport with a paper bag on his head and smoke coming out of it. He was smoking a cigar under the paper bag.” In public conversation, however, Mamet is courtly and wary; his style of discourse is not so much straight talk as Indian wrestling. He wrong-foots the listener with a curious brew of slang and erudition, mixing words like “ain’t,” “marvy,” “jolly,” “vouchsafe,” “desuetude” in the same breath. There’s a jaunty smile in these sentences, but a smile with cold teeth. “Oh, goody gumdrops,” he said when I told him I’d be able to join him in Cabot, Vermont, where he owns a farmhouse and a hundred-acre parcel of rolling land. “Goody gumdrops from the gumdrop tree.”\n\nAs I attempted to ask him unwelcome questions about his childhood, the presence of the Boy Scout knife on the table reminded me of the knife that the distraught ten-year-old boy John flashes in Mamet’s autobiographical masterpiece “The Cryptogram”—a play about the betrayal of the boy by his parents. He is on the stairway looking down at the living room, where his mother, abandoned by his father and unable to meet his emotional needs, sits in the tortured last beat of the play. At whom, exactly, is the boy’s murderous energy aimed, himself or others? His gesture foreshadows the life of the playwright, who learned to turn aggression into art: the knife became a pen. Knives are tools of creation as well as of destruction, and Mamet likes to whittle. His specialty is carving animal figures for his three daughters—Willa (fourteen) and Zosia (nine), both from his twelve-year marriage to the actress Lindsay Crouse, which ended in 1991; and Clara (three), from his marriage, in the same year, to the Scottish actress and singer Rebecca Pidgeon. The knife as an ambiguous symbol of penetration is the central metaphor of “Three Uses of the Knife,” a collection of Mamet’s lectures about theatre to be published later this year, in which he recounts an anecdote first told by the blues singer Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Leadbelly, who once said, “You take a knife, you use it to cut the bread, so you’ll have strength to work; you use it to shave, so you’ll look nice for your lover; on discovering her with another, you use it to cut out her lying heart.” In its affecting irony, this progression illustrates for Mamet the essential elements of dramatic structure; it also demonstrates, he writes, “the attempt of the orderly, affronted mind to confront the awesome.”\n\nIf Mamet felt affronted now, it was by my request that he turn back to the memory of his past. “My childhood, like many people’s, was not a bundle of laughs. So what?” he said. “I always skip that part of the biography.” After a while, he added, “This might help. There’s a movie I’m hoping to do in the fall about making a movie. The female movie star is having a breakdown. She’s crying. She says, ‘I never had a childhood.’ The director puts his arm around her. He says, ‘I had one. It’s no big deal.’ ”\n\nDespite his disclaimer, the dominating themes of Mamet’s work—the sense of not belonging, the imperative of speaking out, the betrayal by authority—evolve directly out of his childhood. He was the firstborn son of two handsome, highly intelligent, upwardly mobile first-generation Americans, Leonore (Lee) and Bernie Mamet, whose families were Ashkenazi Jews from Russia and Poland. “Are you an only child?” I asked Mamet when we first met, in 1983. “Yes,” Mamet said, “except for my sister.” “We lived in an emotional hurricane,” says Lynn Mamet, the extrovert of the pair, who still speaks to her brother almost every day from her home on a scorched hillside canyon in Los Angeles. She adds, “We were safe for each other.” Until their parents divorced bitterly, in 1958, when David was eleven and Lynn was eight, they lived on Euclid Avenue in Chicago’s South Shore Highlands, in a capacious three-story red brick house that stood as a kind of totem to the Mamet family’s self-invention. “My life was expunged of any tradition at all. Nothing old in the house. No color in the house,” Mamet told me. “The virtues expounded were not creative but remedial: let’s stop being Jewish, let’s stop being poor.” Lynn says, “There was a great deal of pressure for us to be the best Americans we could be. There was no room for us to make mistakes.” She and her brother lived in fear of the ferocity of parental expectations—what Lynn calls “hoops of fire.” “It was succeed or die,” Mamet says.\n\nBernie Mamet, a tough labor lawyer who represented over three hundred unions, and once argued—and won—a case before the Supreme Court, preached an exacting semantic gospel of precision, nuance, and observation. “The map is not the territory” was one of Bernie’s mantras, which voiced his bedrock belief that nothing was all black or all white. He hectored his children to listen “with the inner ear,” and, according to his second wife, Judy Mamet, played games with them to build up their powers of observation and memory. “ ‘Stickler’ is a soft word for my father’s attachment to the absolute necessity of expressing yourself correctly,” Lynn Mamet says. “It’s just that what was correct changed on a daily basis.” In the crossfire of family conversation, David grew quickly into an agile sparring partner for his parents, and also learned to listen defensively. “From the earliest age, one had to think, be careful about what one was going to say, and also how the other person was going to respond,” says Mamet, whose celebrated “ear for dialogue” evolved out of listening for danger. “In my family,” he once said, “in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously.”\n\nIndeed, Mamet’s prolific output and his compulsion to master skills (writing, directing, piano playing, sharpshooting) are a daily reiteration of competence in adulthood which seeks to redress a childhood whose litany was “You are not living up to your potential.” Lee, who Mamet says “kind of created this wonderful persona of elegance,” also had a short fuse and a sharp tongue. “You just didn’t know where it was coming from—she could blow at any minute,” Lynn says. “When they harvested the bipolar patch, she ripened first.” To Lynn, Lee said, “If only I could have had a pretty daughter”; and, to David, “I love you but I don’t like you.” Lee had elusive verbal ways of parrying her children’s demands, and this mystification, where what was being said wasn’t what was meant, brought with it a sense of helplessness and frustration. Mamet demonstrates the shifting sand of this dynamic in “The Cryptogram,” where John, the distressed young boy, can’t make himself seen or heard by his self-involved mother, Donny. John is suicidal, and when he confesses his dark thoughts to her she seems to acknowledge them but then both literally and figuratively wanders away:\n\nJOHN: Do you ever wish you could die? (Pause.) It’s not such a bad feeling. Is it?\n\nDONNY: I know that you’re frightened. I know you are. But at some point, do you see . . . ? (Pause. Exits.) (Offstage) John, everyone has a story. Do you know that? In their lives. This is yours.\n\nThe boy’s anxiety goes uncontained; throughout the play he is almost never touched or held. “They were not tactile,” Lynn says of her parents. “If they were tactile, it was like being touched by a porcupine.” Mamet is more forgiving: “They didn’t have a clue,” he says, explaining that Bernie and Lee had their children in their early twenties. Still, his portrayal of John’s demoralized childhood and narcissistic mother connects to the notion of the “corrupt parent” that Mamet later outlined in one of his essays: “The corrupt parent says: ‘If you wish to be protected you must withhold all judgment, powers of interpretation, and individual initiative. I will explain to you what things mean, and how to act in every situation.’ ” David himself was always in trouble for speaking up at home. “He would tilt at every fucking windmill,” Lynn says. At such moments, his mother would say, “David, why must you dramatize everything?” “She said it to me as a criticism,” Mamet told me. “I found out—it took me forty years to find out—that rhetorical questions are all accusations. They’re very, very sneaky accusations.”\n\nBetween his mother’s mixed messages and his father’s high standards, Mamet, who from an early age was a voracious reader but a wretched student, grew up believing he was stupid. “I was like the professor in ‘Oleanna’ ”—his controversial play about a university professor accused by his pupil of sexual harassment—“who all his life had been told he was an idiot, so he behaved like one,” Mamet says. “I just always assumed people assumed I was gonna come to a bad end.” In “Jolly,” an autobiographical one-act play that is part of three meditations on his past called “The Old Neighborhood,” which opens on Broadway this month, he addresses the psychological sleight of mind by which parents project their own inadequacy onto their children, as a grownup brother and sister sit talking about the sins of their parents:\n\nBOB: . . . That’s their way. That’s their way. That’s their swinish, selfish, goddam them. What treachery have they not done, in the name of . . .\n\nJOLLY: . . . I know . . .\n\nBOB: . . . of “honesty.” God damn them. And always “telling” us we . . .\n\nJOLLY: . . . yes\n\nBOB: . . . we were the bad ones.\n\nIn Mamet’s family, the helpless collusion of children with their parents’ sadism was acted out in good times as well as bad. In his essay “The Rake” he recounts one such incident that took place after the family went out to dinner. “My stepfather and mother would walk to the car, telling us that they would pick us up,” he writes. “We children would stand by the restaurant entrance. They would drive up in the car, open the passenger door, and wait until my sister and I had started to get in. Then they would drive away. They would drive ten or fifteen feet and open the door again, and we would walk up again, and they would drive away again.” He continues, “They sometimes would drive around the block. But they would always come back, and by that time the four of us would be laughing in camaraderie and appreciation of what, I believe, was our only family joke.”\n\nIn 1958, Lee married Bernie’s law associate—a close family friend, also named Bernie. She had moved out of the house with the kids, and they ended up in Olympia Fields, on the outskirts of Chicago, which Mamet called New South Hell. She didn’t inform the children of her wedding plans. “We’d been in Florida with my father,” Lynn says. “We came home. They said, ‘How was your weekend?’ We said, ‘O.K. How was yours?’ They said, ‘We got married.’ David responded ‘So what else is new?’ and went into the other room.” He was profoundly distressed by his impulsive, fist-pounding stepfather, who occasionally punched Lynn, and broke the glass top of the kitchen table several times with his explosions of temper, “so the table was associated in our minds with the notion of blood,” Mamet writes in “The Rake.” His anxiety about this new “cobbled-together family” is powerfully evoked in his description of one afternoon in Olympia Fields, when, as his sister remembers it, she came out to call him in to dinner while he was raking leaves. He hit Lynn in the face with the rake. “He opened up the whole side of my face,” Lynn, who still has a scar above her lip from her brother’s outburst, says. “If you could pick a single incident in David’s life which has constantly eviscerated him, it was possibly that act, which also explained a great deal to him internally. How he felt: his anger, his rage, his confusion, his life.” But neither child—David out of guilt, Lynn “out of a desire to avert the terrible punishment she knew I would receive”—would fess up to Lee about what had happened. “My mother pressed us,” Mamet writes. “She said that until one or the other answered, we would not go to the hospital; and so the family sat down to dinner, while my sister clutched a napkin to her face and the blood soaked the napkin and ran down onto her food, which she had to eat; and I also ate my food, and we cleared the table and went to the hospital.” In a way, Mamet’s iconoclasm as a writer is a means of understanding and of finding words for his fury. It also, he says, “stills two warring needs—the need to be accepted and the need to be revenged.”\n\nAt the age of fifteen, after a series of blowups with his mother and stepfather, Mamet returned to Chicago to live with his father, on Lake Shore Drive. Although he was offered an airy, ample room, he chose to live in the maid’s quarters near the back door, which made escape easy.\n\nBut Mamet could never escape his father. “Bernie Mamet was clearly the intense relationship of David’s life, and there seems to be no aspect of the relationship of father to son that they did not explore to hell,” says the director Gregory Mosher, who is Mamet’s foremost interpreter and has collaborated with him on fifteen plays over the years. Mamet looked like his father; his skepticism and his savage view of entrepreneurial capitalism came from Bernie, who, according to Judy Mamet, regularly “railed against the inequities of commerce,” and advised his son, “Don’t trust an expert.” Mamet remembers this theme being driven home in one of his father’s early jokes: “A guy takes his son. He puts him on the mantelpiece, and to his son he says, ‘Jump!’ Kid says, ‘Daddy, I’m frightened.’ Father says, ‘I’m your father. You kidding? Jump!’ Kid jumps. Father steps back and the kid falls on the floor. Dad says, ‘That’s the first lesson. Don’t trust anybody.’ ”\n\nAs a playwright and theorist, Mamet has adopted his father’s advocate style of thinking against the system. “He was a winning lawyer. He believed in being smarter than the other guy and working harder than the other guy,” says Mamet, who based the character of Jimmy Hoffa, in his 1991 film, on Bernie. “One of Dad’s lines I put in the movie,” Mamet says. “He said, ‘Some people say that the client’s gotta pay you to do your best. The client’s not paying me to be best, the client’s paying me to win.’ ”\n\nBernie, who had wanted to go on the stage himself as a young man, was deeply competitive even with his son. “He came to see ‘American Buffalo,’ ” Mamet says. “He said, ‘When are you going to chuck all this nonsense and go to law school?’ ” “He was a very hard man,” says Sheila Welch, who observed them during the opening of “Edmond,” in 1982, and later became the producer of Mamet’s Atlantic Theatre Company. “He was very, very critical. I think he taunted Dave, almost like Mozart’s father—you know, ‘You have to be better’—but in a sense he secretly didn’t want David to be better than him.” For about four years in the eighties, the father and the son stopped talking to each other, but they made up after the birth of Mamet’s second daughter, in time for Mamet to cast his father as a terrorist in his movie “Homicide.” The occasion is memorialized in a photo of them on the set, in which Bernie sits slumped at a table in the foreground, wearing a leather jacket, and above him, dominating the frame, David stands on a radiator giving orders. On July 5, 1991, Mamet stood over his father for the last time, at his funeral. (Bernie had died of cancer, at the age of sixty-eight.) He spoke at the service; afterward, as is the custom in Jewish ceremonies, the mourners filed forward one by one to shovel a spadeful of dirt onto the casket from a huge mound of earth beside the grave. Mamet had his turn. But when the gravedigger picked up the shovel to finish the job Mamet took the shovel back from him without a word and started to fill in the grave himself. It was a blistering summer day. After a while, he took off his jacket, and the wilted mourners watched for nearly forty minutes while he buried his father.\n\nMamet graduated from Goddard College, which he calls “sex camp,” in 1969. By 1975, he was famous. His psychological makeup then, as now, was “essentially that of an unsure student who has finally discovered an idea in which he can believe, and who feels unless he clutches and dedicates himself to that idea, he will be lost.” At sixteen, he had become a dogsbody and bit player at Bob Sickinger’s innovative Hull House Theatre, in Chicago. “It was the first time in my confused young life that I had learned that work is love,” he wrote later. He was by then well read in the literature of avant-garde drama, especially the plays of Harold Pinter. “It was stuff you heard in the street,” he says. “It was the stuff you overheard in the taxicab. It wasn’t writerly.” He adds, “Pinter was sui generis. He was starting out with his vision of the world, and he was going to write it.” (Pinter would later champion Mamet. “He sent me, unforgettably, ‘Glengarry Glen Ross,’ with a note saying ‘There is something wrong with this play. What is it?’ ” Pinter recalls. “I wired him immediately. ‘There is nothing wrong with this play. I’m giving it to the National.’ ”) Mamet began playwriting in his final year of college, after a summer vacation spent working as a busboy and odd-job man at Second City, Chicago’s improvisational theatre, and watching comic players like Peter Boyle, Robert Klein, and David Steinberg; the quick cuts and blackouts of their revue format became part of Mamet’s early punchy minimalism. “For the next ten years,” he said, “none of my scenes lasted more than eight minutes.”\n\nMamet had also taken off his junior year to study acting in New York with the renowned Sanford Meisner, at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Meisner believed that “every play is based upon the reality of doing,” that “good acting comes from the heart,” and that “there’s no mentality in it.” He urged his students to “fuck polite”; he devised the Word Repetition Game, in which two actors play off each other, each repeating exactly the words the other has just said, in order to bring out real emotion and impulsive shifts in behavior. Mamet wasn’t chosen by Meisner to go on to the next year of classes, but when he began writing plays his distinctive fractured cadences and overlapping dialogue gradually transferred the rigors of the Word Repetition Game from the stage to the page. “I think the rhythm of his dialogue actually comes from the repetition exercises,” says Scott Zigler, who has been a member of the Atlantic Theatre Company since its inception, in 1985, and is directing “The Old Neighborhood” on Broadway. “The rhythm is simply the rhythm of being in the moment.” For instance, “Sexual Perversity in Chicago” begins:\n\nDANNY: So how’d you do last night?\n\nBERNIE: Are you kidding me?\n\nDANNY: Yeah?\n\nBERNIE: Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nDANNY: Yeah?\n\nBERNIE: Are you pulling my leg?\n\nDANNY: So?\n\nBERNIE: So tits out to here so.\n\nBut if it took Mamet a few years to absorb Meisner’s teaching into his writing, it took him no time to incorporate Meisner’s rogue ideas into what Mamet called his South Side Gypsy attitude. His senior-year project was his first completed play, “Camel”—a revue composed of thirty-four blackout bits based on “the more potent pieces in my journal.” (It’s a method that Mamet still uses, mining material from the daily ledgers he keeps.) He had never directed a play “in my whole sunlit lifetime,” he wrote in the project notes. But, he went on, “I remembered that Acting is Doing. So I just started doing.” Mamet had the chutzpah to charge fifty cents admission, a gesture that ruffled a lot of hippie feathers. “I wanted to communicate to the public at large that this was going to be no ordinary theatrical event,” he wrote. Also, he added, “I felt like it.” The last sentence of the project report served as Mamet’s envoi to college life: “It’s time for the actor to find another big rock to push up that long hill.”\n\nEveryone, including Mamet, conceded that he was not an actor. But in 1970, after undertaking various acting stints and odd jobs, Mamet found himself back in Vermont—this time teaching acting, first at Marlboro College and then, in 1971, at his progressive alma mater, which had no grades, no requirements, no tests. “So here comes Mamet dressed in tailored sailor pants, this tight shirt, with impeccably done hair. He walks like he’s got a ramrod up his butt, and he just laid down the law,” the actor William H. Macy, who is one of Mamet’s closest friends, and who was nominated for an Academy Award last year for his performance in “Fargo,” says of Mamet’s arrival in class. “The first thing he said was ‘If you’re late, don’t come in. If you’re not prepared, don’t do the class. If you want to learn to act, I’m the guy who can teach you. If you’re not here for that, leave.’ The class just looked at each other, going, ‘Who is this fucking guy?’ ” Macy continues, “But he won us over. He was not egotistical in any way. He just had this unshakable confidence.” Mamet was in the habit of fining latecomers a dollar a minute and then burning their money. After about a year and a half of study, according to Macy, Mamet “walked in one day and said, ‘I’ve written these plays.’ It was ‘Sexual Perversity in Chicago’ ”—a comedy about the vagaries of dating which, a few years later, would become Mamet’s first hit. “In that incarnation,” Macy goes on, “it was a bunch of blackouts—about twelve of them. A role for everyone. Who knew he even wrote?”\n\nMamet himself seems never to have doubted his playwriting ability. “I was just sure,” he says. “I mean, how are you sure you got a fastball?” He adds, “Writing was something I could do. I figured, Well, if you fuck this up, you deserve everything that’s gonna happen to you.” When Mamet was about twenty-two, a friend sent a draft of “Sexual Perversity in Chicago” to Mike Nichols, who had recently made “Carnal Knowledge”; he said he’d have turned it into a movie right away except that he’d just made one like it. “I thought, Oh my God, these guys actually believe in me,” Mamet says. “I better start working right now. I better have another play and another play after that.” In 1972, he formed the St. Nicholas Company, in Vermont, with Macy and another of his students, Steven Schachter; in 1973, they shifted their base to Chicago, where, Mamet writes, “the air feels new, and all things still seem possible.”\n\nMamet, who worked in the Windy City only between 1973 and 1977, is either Chicago’s most famous New York playwright or New York’s most famous Chicago playwright. “Chicago is very, very different from New York,” he says. “In Chicago, you lived with your theatre company. The money that you made you shared. If you didn’t work together, you starved. You weren’t in it for an individual career.” Chicago’s earthiness extended to its pragmatic literary tradition, which carried with it “an intolerance for the purely ornamental.” “Performance art—whatever the hell that may be—would have been completely foreign to Chicago, which is very meat and potatoes,” Mamet says. “If it’s a comedy it would be a good idea if it were funny.” Mamet and his cohorts, who soon added the actress Patricia Cox to their founding group, lived by their wits. They helped fund their productions by giving acting classes. “We invented this myth of the Chicago theatre scene,” says Gregory Mosher, who considers having bumped into Mamet in 1975 “the central fact of my life.” “What made the Chicago theatre scene was that no one cared. The audience didn’t care. They were profoundly indifferent to everything we did.”\n\nIn those days, Mamet resided and wrote at the Lincoln Hotel. “His room was the size of a closet. He had no belongings. It was Spartan like you can’t believe,” Macy says. But “from the very first day I met him,” a Chicago playwright, Alan Gross, recalled in the Chicago Tribune in 1982, “David told me he was an important American playwright. . . . He was completely self-encapsulated. He knew exactly what he wanted to do and what was expected of him; he had a great rap, a great act.” According to the program note for the St. Nicholas’s début production, the company was named for the patron saint of “mountebanks, prostitutes, and the demimonde.” And Mamet had a bit of the mountebank in him. “He was very, very fast on his feet,” the company’s first literary manager, Jonathan Abarbanel, says, referring to what he calls Mamet’s “intellectual Barnumism.” Abarbanel once told the magazine Chicago, “He would be talking—‘As Aristotle said, blah blah.’ Or, ‘I was rereading Kierkegaard the other day.’ I remember saying, ‘Aristotle never said that! You weren’t reading Kierkegaard!’ And he’d go, ‘Sshhh! Don’t tell anyone.’ ”\n\nWhile Mamet waited tables, drove taxis, and cleaned offices to support his theatrical habit, he turned Chicago into a kind of raffish playground. “He always had very good luck with the ladies,” Macy says. “Oh, man, smooth as silk.” (One of Mamet’s best come-ons—“Is anyone taking up an inordinate amount of your time these days?”—is memorialized in “Sexual Perversity in Chicago.”) He explored the city’s gritty corners, whose vernacular he savored and kept note of. Among his actor friends, Ed O’Neill had been a football star at Ohio University; Dennis Farina had been a policeman; and J.J. Johnston, a walking lexicon of underworld phrase and fable who was from the South Side, had been a bookie. Having been raised on high culture and hated it, Mamet was drawn to “people who don’t institutionalize their thought.”\n\n“Dave got hit with the gangster bag early,” Johnston, who recalls telling him about the old-time hoods, says. “These crooks, most of them, have pipe dreams. They can’t do anything right. Like they say, these guys would fuck up a two-car funeral.” Mamet, who has written a lot about criminals, including his screenplays for “The Untouchables,” “Things Change,” and an upcoming movie about Meyer Lansky, sometimes socialized with them and saw their pathos at first hand. “They’re entrepreneurs,” he says. “They speak their own language. Like many people engaged in violence, they’re sentimental.” He tried to talk his way into a daily North Side poker game of petty thieves, which was held in a junk shop owned by a fence called Kenny. “I came out several times, hung out, they didn’t want to let me sit down,” he says. “Then, one day, I wasn’t there. They said, ‘Where were you yesterday? We missed you.’ I said I was teaching drama at Pontiac Correctional Center. It turned out later that many of them had done time at Pontiac. So they started calling me Teach, and they let me sit down on the game.” It was out of this subterranean milieu that Mamet made his first masterpiece, “American Buffalo”—a tale of betrayal cloaked in the comedy of a botched heist, set in a Chicago junk shop. When he handed the script to Mosher, a stripling director just out of Juilliard who was in charge of the Chicago Goodman Theatre’s Stage 2, Mosher told him he would read it over the weekend. “You don’t need to read it,” Mamet said. “Just do it.” He paused, then added, “Tell you what. I’ll put five grand in escrow, and if the play doesn’t win the Pulitzer, keep the money.”\n\nMamet didn’t win that year’s Pulitzer and never made good on the promise, but “American Buffalo” made his name. It was produced on Broadway in 1977, giving Mamet his first real payday; it was the beginning of his being able to make a living as a playwright. Though it was only his second full-length play, it was a great leap forward in his storytelling. As late as 1991, Mamet maintained that it was “the most structurally competent” of his plays. “It has the form of a classical tragedy,” he said then. As he put it to me recently, “That’s the only thing I ever really worked hard at in my life: plotting. Do it and do it, and do it again.” He added, “I’m not looking for a feeling—I’m looking for an equation. Given the set of circumstances, what does it end up with? How is that inevitable? How is that surprising?”\n\nWhat Mamet had excavated from the junk-shop poker games and captured in “American Buffalo” was the notion of a world and an idiom composed of waste. In the swagger of small talk he found a metaphor for the spiritual attrition of American capitalism. His small-fry characters hilariously emulate the badinage of big business. “You know what is free enterprise,” says Teach, the punk who kisses himself in on a plan to rob the coin collection of a man who recently paid the junk-shop owner ninety dollars for a nickel. “The freedom of the Individual . . . to Embark on any Fucking Course that he sees fit . . . in order to secure his honest chance to make a profit. . . . The country’s founded on this, Don. You know this.”\n\nMamet’s rhythm gave the words and the pauses an unusual emotional clout. “Dave’s dialogue is a string of iambs, which can often be broken down into fives,” Mosher says. “For example, ‘But all I ever ask (and I would say this to her face) is only she remembers who is who and not to go around with her or Gracie either with this attitude: The Past is Past, and this is Now, and so Fuck You’ is, I believe, twenty-seven iambs in a row.” Joe Mantegna, one of Mamet’s favorite actors, talks about seeing Mamet “tapping it out with his pen” while actors speak their lines. Sometimes Mamet could be even more insistent. “He sits in the back of the house going, ‘Pick up, pick up, pick up!’ ” Mosher says.\n\nIn Mamet’s plays, speech becomes the doing that reveals being; identity is dramatized as each character’s struggle to speak his meaning. For instance, Teach, who is full of big plans, can’t think clearly. When he makes his sensational entrance cursing “Fuckin’ Ruthie,” who has insulted him for eating a piece of toast off her plate, we hear a syntax that reels backward like his fearful, scrambled mind:\n\nOnly (and I tell you this, Don). Only, and I’m not, I don’t think, casting anything on anyone: from the mouth of a Southern bulldyke asshole ingrate of a vicious nowhere cunt can this trash come.\n\nOver the years, so many people have written Mamet to complain about the “language” in his plays that in the eighties he had a form letter printed which read “Too bad, you big cry baby.” Once, while talking on the phone in the kitchen to the producer Fred Zollo, Mamet reached into the refrigerator to help his daughter Willa get a Fudgsicle. “Oh, fuck,” he said. “Daddy, don’t use that language,” Willa laughed. Mamet replied, “That language put that fuckin’ Fudgsicle in your mouth.” In his plays Mamet relishes slang for its impoverished poetry; it helps to create the sense of energy and of absence which his work dissects. In “Sexual Perversity” it’s the absence of self-awareness (“ ‘Cunt’ won’t do it,” Deb says to the inchoate Danny. “ ‘Fuck’ won’t do it. No more magic. . . . Tell me what you’re feeling. Jerk”); in “American Buffalo” it’s the absence of beauty and possibility (“There is nothing out there,” Teach says after trashing the shop. “I fuck myself”); in “Glengarry Glen Ross” it’s the absence of community and calm (“Fuck you. That’s my message to you. Fuck you and kiss my ass,” Shelly “the Machine” Levene crows at Williamson, the guy who gives out the property leads, after making what he fondly thinks is a sale). Out of the muck of ordinary speech—the curses, interruptions, asides, midsentence breaks, and sudden accelerations—Mamet carefully weaves a tapestry of motifs which he sees as “counterpoint.” “The beauty of the fugue comes from the descant, from the counting,” he says. “The melody line is pretty damn simple. Anyone can write that.” When he composes, Mamet says, he doesn’t picture the characters onstage; he hears them. “The rhythms don’t just unlock something in the character,” he says. “They are what’s happening.”\n\nUntil Mamet emerged, American commercial theatre was primarily a literary, naturalistic theatre, where words were a libretto for the actor’s emotions, and where the actor determined the rhythms. To be successful, the author had to become invisible. But Mamet brought the author’s voice back onto the stage; his ideas about acting protect the author’s voice at the expense of the actor’s invention. “The words are set and unchanging. Any worth in them was put there by the author,” he writes mischievously in “True and False.” “If you learn the words by rote, as if they were a phone book, and let them come out of your mouth without your interpretation, the audience will be well served.” This is, to say the least, controversial. “It’s completely nuts,” says the director Karel Reisz, whose films include “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning” and “The French Lieutenant’s Woman.” “In order to get what you want from the other actor, you have to invent, color, invest it with your own feelings. I think the notion of separating words from actions is very odd; words are part of the action. It’s the reason why the shows he directs are so poor. The element of believability is not there; you have the sense of automata reciting the words.”\n\nMamet, like Pinter or Beckett, is perhaps not the best interpreter of his own vision. (“The Cryptogram,” for example, was given an excellent English production by Mosher which Mamet did not see, and was directed by Mamet, first in Cambridge and then in New York, without the same impact.) But once he had defined his voice he was determined to defend it. He even traded punches with the actor F. Murray Abraham during the New York production of “Sexual Perversity in Chicago” when Abraham rejected Mamet’s tempo in his line readings. “He was like a man on a mission,” says Fred Zollo, who met Mamet in those early years and went on to produce most of his major plays as well as many of his films. “I just wanted to be so far ahead,” Mamet says. “I didn’t want to look back and find somebody gaining on me. If I couldn’t write a play, I’d write a movie or I’d write a poem or I’d direct something or I’d teach a class or write a book. I didn’t care.” He continues, “I ain’t gonna go home.”\n\nIn 1976, Mamet moved to New York, married into show-biz aristocracy—Lindsay Crouse was the daughter of Russel Crouse, who, with his partner Howard Lindsay, wrote such Broadway smash hits as “Life with Father” and “The Sound of Music”—and got down to work. During this period, he began supplementing his playwriting with screenwriting. He got his first assignment through Crouse, who was on her way to audition for Bob Rafelson’s 1981 remake of “The Postman Always Rings Twice.” He told her to tell Rafelson that “he was a fool if he didn’t hire me to write the screenplay,” he says. “I was kidding, but she did it.” Rafelson called Mamet and asked why he should hire him. “I told him, ‘Because I’ll give you either a really good screenplay or a sincere apology.’ ” He also wrote “The Verdict,” and by 1982 he was at work on “Glengarry Glen Ross,” which had its début at London’s National Theatre and then went on to become a huge hit on Broadway. Crouse, who starred in such films as “Slap Shot” and “Places in the Heart,” for which she was nominated for an Oscar, “understood the joy and glamour of show biz,” the playwright John Guare says, “and she had integrity.” Guare remembers walking with her in Vermont: “She said to me, ‘Just look at him. Do you realize that this man has made himself? He’s been given no help.’ I understood David’s sense of will through her pride in it. She was so sublimely proud of him—until she wasn’t.” But in the years they were together Crouse was essential to him. “She saw herself as a creative partner, and in some ways she probably was,” Sheila Welch says. She adds, “David wasn’t very smooth socially. Lindsay had social graces. David learned how to present himself in the theatre world from her.” Mamet was now properly seen as well as heard. “That’s why I love the theatre,” a character says in “Edmond.” “Because what you must ask respect for is yourself.” If he hadn’t found the theatre, Mamet has said, “it’s very likely I would have become a criminal—another profession that subsumes the outsider, or, perhaps more to the point, accepts people with a not very well formed ego and rewards the ability to improvise.”\n\n“Injury has given David enormous energy,” Sidney Lumet, who directed “The Verdict,” says. “I have no idea where it comes from, but there’s a sense of ‘I’ve been screwed.’ A lot of the movies are very much about being had.” In fact, all Mamet’s movies, including the recent crop, and most of his major plays are about betrayal. Many of them revolve around con artists, those picaresque urban hunter-gatherers who scour the postindustrial wasteland in search of both surplus and leisure, and around con games, which give his sense of betrayal a dramatic form. Mamet himself has performed a mentalism act at county fairs, and when he was in college he shilled for his friend Jonathan Katz, then a nationally ranked Ping-Pong champion. “We would stage a game for money between him and me, and I would let him win,” Katz says. “He wouldn’t give me a rematch. I’d get ‘upset,’ but some other guy would give me a rematch, having just seen me beaten by David playing badly.” The magician and master card manipulator Ricky Jay says of Mamet, “He has what a hustler has. He has ‘grift sense.’ It’s what makes his plays work.” In “House of Games” (1987), the first movie that Mamet both wrote and directed, the con illustrates the dilemma of trust. “I ‘used’ you. I did. I’m sorry,” Mike, the con man, says to his mark Ford, who has caught him out. “And you learned some things about yourself that you’d rather not know.” He continues, “You say I Acted Atrociously. Yes. I did. I do it for a living.” Writers do the same in the service of their story, but with this difference: their lies are like truth. Mamet sees a parallel to the con game in writing for the theatre. The con of performance is to rob the audience not of money but of its preconceived notions. “The trick is leaving out everything except the essential,” Mamet explains. “As Bettelheim says in ‘The Uses of Enchantment,’ the more you leave out, the more we see ourselves in the picture, the more we project our own thoughts onto it.”\n\nThe con trick has a still more abiding pull on Mamet’s imagination: it reverses the parental situation. In the con, the public is put in the role of the helpless child, while the con artist is the parent who knows the game and controls all the rules and the information. The whole enterprise is an assertion of omnipotence and a refusal to admit helplessness, which speaks to something deep in Mamet’s nature. At the finale of “House of Games,” Mike is held at gunpoint by Ford, who has shot him twice. Ford says, “Beg me for your life.” But Mike, a con man to the last, won’t. He’d rather die than be infantilized and surrender his sense of autonomy. Ford shoots him again. “Thank you, sir, may I have another?” Mike says as Ford fires three more shots into him. In real life, Mamet also controls the rules of his game: he is the agent of all action, all answers, all interpretation. Even Mamet’s instructions to actors, which demystify the notion of character (“There is no character. There are only lines upon a page”), are a way of insuring that the play’s meaning and invention stay with him. “He controls the actors with an iron hand, in the rhythms and little quarter words and half words and stammers,” Mike Nichols, who uses Mamet’s work in his acting classes, says. “He says ‘You vill do vhat I say!’ more than any writer that’s ever written for the theatre, with the possible exceptions of Lillian Hellman and Pinter. For the actor to force his life through this iron control leads to such exciting things.” It can also sometimes flatten and dehumanize performances, as it did Lindsay Crouse’s in “House of Games.” But as a film director Mamet has progressed from that static, unsure first effort, which one critic accurately observed was shot “like an Army training film,” to the fluid, well-paced achievement of “The Spanish Prisoner,” in which a con trick played on a credulous company man becomes a moral lesson about how the getting of wisdom equals the getting of skepticism.\n\nAbout every eighteen months, Mamet likes to direct a movie. “When I’m making a movie, I’m just about as happy as I can be,” he says. “I’m playing doll house with my best friends in the world.” He oversees these occasions with patriarchal good humor and consideration. “He’s an embarrassingly stand-up guy,” the producer Art Linson says. “He expects nothing from people. So when somebody does something, the slightest gesture, he’s truly moved.” Every night after shooting, Mamet goes among the crew and thanks each member personally. His sets are exceptional for their congeniality. “I’ve had many happy movie experiences, but that one was right up there at the top,” Steve Martin says about playing the heavy in “The Spanish Prisoner.” Mamet keeps a joke reel of each film, which is to say a partial record of his practical jokes. On the first day of “The Spanish Prisoner,” for instance, he laid out for the actress Felicity Huffman a Brünnhilde costume, complete with horned helmet. Once, during the shooting of “Oleanna,” he asked William Macy to learn a new full-page speech on the spur of the moment and he put it on cue cards for the take. “I start the speech,” Macy recalls. “I do the first card. I get to the second card, and it reads, ‘But what do I know? I’m just a dumb towheaded cracker from Georgia. You know, when Dave first picked me out of the gutter . . .’ ”\n\nOf course, Mamet has less fun being a hired hand on other people’s Hollywood projects. “Being a writer out there is like going into Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest with a great idea for a bar-mitzvah festival,” he says. His streamlined screenplays, which have no embellishments or explanations, are not studio-executive-friendly. “They’re dry sponges waiting for the water of performance,” Sidney Lumet says. “And that’s when they swell up to five thousand per cent.” Mamet’s script for “The Verdict” had been forgotten by the producers, who had spent more than a million dollars in development, but Lumet read Mamet’s early version and said it was the one he wanted to shoot. Likewise, Paramount was indifferent to Linson’s notion of going after Mamet to write “The Untouchables.” A cartoon of their first meeting, in 1984, is pinned on the wall of Mamet’s cabin, with Linson giving his pitch: “Dave, don’t you think that the best career move for someone who’d just won the Pulitzer Prize would be to adapt ‘The Untouchables’ for a shitload of money?” Mamet’s screenplay departed from the TV series, and, inevitably, the executives didn’t like it. Nonetheless, when it was filmed by Brian De Palma it grossed over two hundred million dollars worldwide and gave Mamet considerable heat in the industry.\n\nActually, Mamet’s minimalism and his notion of character suits screenwriting. He works up his story on file cards. “You know the movie’s ready to be written when you can remember it,” Mamet says. “When the progression of incidents is so clear that you no longer need the cards, then you’re ready to write.” He writes very fast. “He wrote the first draft of ‘The Untouchables’ in what seemed like ten days or less,” Linson recalls. “He has occasionally turned a script in to me and said, ‘Could you please sit on it for a couple of weeks? I don’t want them to think it’s this easy.’ Dead true. Once Dave gets something, it just kind of writes itself.” Rewriting Mamet is very difficult. “It looks like somebody put a patch on a pair of Levi’s,” Linson says, and, though Mamet will accept notes and supply rewrites, “there’ll come a time where the gate comes down and it’s ‘No más.’ ”\n\nMamet’s talent and his inflexibility have given him something of a bad-boy reputation in Hollywood, whose folly he memorialized in “Speed-the-Plow.” “I find that a smile and a hearty ‘Fuck you’ does the trick,” he says of seeing off the intrusive suggestions of movie executives. Sometimes even his own producers get it in the neck. Mamet once handed Zollo a copy of “American Buffalo” to do as a movie. “Have you adapted it for the screen?” Zollo asked. “Adapted it?” said Mamet. “Have I fucking what? I’m going to adapt it right now for you.” Mamet demanded the script back. “He crosses out ‘A Play by David Mamet’ and he writes ‘A Screenplay by David Mamet,’ ” Zollo says. Mamet is fortified in his truculence by the lesson of his poker playing (“If you’re smarter than the other guy, be smarter than the other guy”) and by a favorite dictum of the English critic William Hazlitt, which he paraphrases as “Don’t try to suck up or even be nice to your intellectual inferiors. They’ll only hate you more for it.” He adds, “Having read that makes my life a little bit easier.” About two years ago, Bob Conte, of HBO, gave Zollo a few pages of notes to give to Mamet on his “Lansky” script, which is finally being produced this year. “Essentially, almost all of our notes concern the following issues: Chronology, Clarity, and Character (alliteration unintended),” Conte wrote. “Tell him to Suck My Dick,” Mamet told Zollo. “Alliteration unintended.”\n\nMamet’s life as an uncompromising writer/director seems in direct contrast to—and is probably made possible by—the tranquillity of his surroundings. In Vermont, he lives in a converted farmhouse, originally built in 1805, that sits on the rise of a hill and looks down a sloping meadow onto a large beaver pond. There are deer, bear, and moose in the surrounding forests, where Mamet likes to walk and sometimes hunt—or, as he says, “take my gun for a walk.” He never shoots anything. “My wife calls me the Deer Protection Association,” he says. If he gets in his Land Rover, a gift from Linson for a week’s rewrite, he can be at Goddard College in fifteen minutes; if he gets on his mountain bike, as he does with Rebecca several times a week to go into town for the mail, Cabot is less than four miles of hard pedalling away. Mamet’s kingdom consists of the farmhouse, a red barn, and a cedar cabin whose shingled roof is tucked under the bough of a pine tree about a hundred and fifty yards from the house.\n\nOnto this rough-hewn masculine landscape Rebecca Pidgeon has put her graceful mark: red, white, and pink hollyhocks press up against the fence posts; under the kitchen window, she has planted an array of herbs among rows of rhubarb, spinach, and lettuce, which Mamet looks upon with the kind of wonder that Jack had for the beanstalk. “After roses, it’s all broccoli to me,” he says. Mamet’s admiration for his wife’s competence and for her attentiveness to the world around her is transparent and touching. “She’s had a tremendous effect in anchoring him, in calming him down, in making him feel it’s O.K. to be scared, it’s O.K. to be upset, it’s O.K. to fail,” Lynn Mamet says. “There’s nothing self-destructive about her. She’s healthy. And I think it’s allowed my brother to exhale for the first time in his life.”\n\nMamet first laid eyes on Pidgeon, who is nineteen years younger than he is, at National Theatre rehearsals in London for a 1989 production of “Speed-the-Plow,” in which she was playing the tenacious, idealistic secretary who almost succeeds in making the producing goniff do good. “He came up to her and said, ‘You know, I always wanted to meet a girl like that,’ ” the actor Colin Stinton, who played opposite Pidgeon, recalls. “She blushed and was sort of flattered by it, I think.” Pidgeon, who had her own rock band in addition to her acting career, was resourceful, straightforward, and beautiful; and she didn’t bore him. “You think she likes me?” Mamet badgered the painter Donald Sultan, with whom he had travelled to London. Sultan explains, “I said, ‘Yeah, I think she likes you.’ He said, ‘What makes you think that?’ I said, ‘Well, every day for the last six months, every thought, every word, every action has been yours. How could she not like you?’ ” Pidgeon herself was surprised that she did. She says, “I had imagined him as this old, tall, very intellectual, cold, godlike kind of writer, and then I see this young, vibrant kind of street urchin. I thought, How could this be possible?” In the meantime, Mamet called his sister from London. “He said, ‘I’ve found her,’ ” Lynn Mamet says. “He told me about her. I said, ‘So, you’ll marry her.’ He went on for months, driving me crazy. ‘She’s in London, I’m here; she’s got this career, I’m here; she’s eleven, I’m here.’ ”\n\nAfter a two-year long-distance courtship, they married; Mamet had found his bliss and a new mellowness. Zollo was surprised when Mamet agreed in 1994 to let him mount “The Cryptogram,” which he had kept in his trunk since the late seventies because of its intensely personal material. “He felt safe in his life,” Zollo says, by way of explanation. Pidgeon says, “We’re extremely compatible. There’s no ‘I’m going off to be a genius and be troublesome and mysterious and worried.’ We have a very peaceful life.” Contentment seems to have opened Mamet up even in literary ways. “I think his women’s writing has improved since his marriage to Rebecca,” Lynn says—a statement borne out by the complex rewrite of the mother’s role in “The Cryptogram,” and by the corporate femme fatale in “The Spanish Prisoner,” a part well played by Pidgeon. Lynn goes on, “I don’t think David has written a lot for women because I don’t think he’s been around that many women to whom he wishes to listen, and therefore replicate their voices.”\n\nRebecca and Clara go down through the meadow to hunt for frogs at the beaver pond, and Mamet heads for the cabin. “I’ve never been anything other than happy here,” he says as we approach the porch, whose left side is piled high with firewood. In the winter, when it can get to forty below and the snow is deep, Mamet makes the trek in snowshoes. When he arrives, his ink is frozen, so he improvises a trivet out of pie plates, putting pencils under the ink bottle and warming it up on the black Glenwood’s parlor stove that dominates the front half of the room. There is an exhilarating sense of containment and comfort here, where Mamet’s cherished objects are arranged carefully around him: a canoe paddle with a beautifully painted pike on its blade hangs on the beam separating the writing area from the reading area; there’s a dartboard, a skeet thrower, a collection of campaign buttons, a .58 muzzleloader, a nine-pound medicine ball, and bookcases full of outdoor reading like “The Parker Gun Shooter’s Bible Treasury” and “Black Powder Gun Digest.” It’s as if, instead of with the stove, Mamet were keeping himself warm with the things he loves. “Being a writer is all so ethereal that I think most of us tend to surround ourselves with tchotchkes so we can actually be sure we have a past,” he says. “Or a life.”"
