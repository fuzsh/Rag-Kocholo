        "text": "The fiery feud between the Greens and Blacks is going up in flames faster than you can say \"Dracarys.\"\n\nFollowing King Vicerys' (Paddy Considine) death-shrouded last words, House of the Dragon season 1 concluded with Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) placing her son Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the Iron Throne and ultimately usurping the birthright of Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy). The dramatic conclusion pitted the two houses against one another as they rounded up their alliances for an impending civil war over Westeros.\n\nThat fight for power, called the Dance of the Dragons, is just getting started, and House of the Dragon fans are eager to see it ignite in season 2. Here, we've gathered all the latest details on the Emmy-nominated HBO show's second season, including when the show will debut, how to watch and more:\n\nWas House of the Dragon renewed for season 2?\n\nA resounding yes! On August 26, 2022, shortly after its season 1 premiere, the series got an early renewal for another installment.\n\nThat means the war between kin is officially set to begin. HBO surprised fans on December 2 by dropping an official teaser trailer and premire date news (more on that later ...). In the House of the Dragon season 2 trailer, we see the rivalry between Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower reach a boiling point. A civil war ensues as the two bloodlines fight for who will ascend to the Iron Throne.\n\n\"There is no war so hateful to the gods as a war between kin,\" Rhaenyra says in a clip, as her aunt Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best) continues: \"And no war so bloody as a war between dragons.\" The dragon-filled trailer also shows Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) suiting up in armor, ready for battle.\n\nOlivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower in House of the Dragon season 2.\n\nIs there a release date for House of the Dragon season 2 yet?\n\nNo more waiting with bated breath: Season 2 will premiere in the \"early summer\" of 2024, according to HBO.\n\nDespite the and SAG-AFTRA strikes that led to Hollywood shooting delays, the HBO production was able to continue filming this past summer because of its UK-based union contract. While there is no specific premiere date just yet, season 1 premiered its first episode on August 21, 2022, so we predict a similar timeline for season 2.\n\nCheck back for more House of the Dragon updates soon by hitting \"save\" at the top of this page.\n\nDo we know how many episodes are in House of the Dragon season 2?\n\nHouse the Dragon Sundays will look a little different in 2024, as season 2 will feature two fewer episodes than season 1. Per Deadline, an HBO spokesperson claimed the decision to trim season 2 to eight episodes was \"story-driven.\" Assuming the show is green lit for a third season, this could set a precedent, especially as showrunner Ryan Condal re-iterated his intention to slow down the pacing.\n\nRumblings from the House of the Dragon’s creative team reveal they envision the series running for three or four seasons. A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin seemed to echo that on his blog back in October 2022, writing: “It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish.\"\n\nMatt Smith as Daemon Targaryen and Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragon season 2.\n\nDo who will be in the House of the Dragon season 2 cast?\n\nThough fans found a favorite in Milly Alcock's young Rhaneyra, the first season followed a recasting format that aged up the characters with new actors. Still, it seems like we can expect the current version of the cast to stick around for a bit longer.\n\nDaemon Targaryen's real-life counterpart, actor Matt Smith, let it slip on the podcast that after the episode 6 time jump, they're in it for the long haul. \"I’m pretty sure from then on, there's not any big huge time jumps, particularly next season and the one after,\" he said on the podcast.\n\nAccording to Variety, it's written in stone. The House of the Dragon season 2 cast includes:\n\nEmma D'Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen\n\nMatt Smith as Daemon Targaryen\n\nOlivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower\n\nRhys Ifans as Otto Hightower\n\nEve Best as Rhaenys Targaryen\n\nSteve Touissant as Corlys Velaryon\n\nFabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole\n\nMatthew Needham as Larys Strong\n\nEwan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen\n\nTom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen\n\nSonoya Mizuno as Mysaria\n\nHarry Collett as Prince Jacaerys Velaryon\n\nBethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen\n\nPhoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen\n\nPhia Saban as Helaena Targaryen\n\nJefferson Hall as Ser Tyland Lannister\n\nElliot Grihault, Harry Collett, Emma D’Arcy, Matt Smith and Phoebe Campbell in ’House of the Dragon’ season 1 episode 8.\n\nBut there will be some new faces, including:\n\nAbubakar Salim as Alyn of Hull\n\nGayle Rankin as Alys Rivers\n\nFreddie Fox as Ser Gwayne Hightower\n\nSimon Russell Beale as Ser Simon Strong\n\nTom Taylor as Lord Cregan Stark\n\nClinton Liberty as Addam of Hull\n\nJamie Kenna as Ser Alfred Broome\n\nKieran Bew as Hugh\n\nTom Bennett as Ulf\n\nVincent Regan as Ser Rickard Thorne\n\nAs for surprise appearances, if you're wondering if Alicent's fourth and youngest child, Daeron Targaryen, will ever appear on screen, the showrunners have assured viewers that he does exist.\n\n\"He’s warded off at Oldtown to Hobert Hightower and soon to Ormond Hightower, who is Hobert’s nephew, who becomes Lord of Oldtown,\" Ryan told Variety. \"He’s there. That’s the fact. When he is relevant to be mentioned — and he will be — he will be mentioned.\"\n\nAre there any clues about the House of the Dragon season 2 yet?\n\nAs is tradition with Game of Thrones cliffhangers, the last episode of HotD left things on a dismal note, including Luke's death by dragon. However, there's hope yet: Rhaenyra sends her firstborn son Jacaerys to meet with Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) near the end of the finale.\n\nThat's right — Winter is coming, as fans theorize that next season will begin with a trip to Winterfell, a.k.a. the House of Stark and the eventual home of Jon Snow.\n\nElliot Grihault as Luke Velayron and Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen in ’House of the Dragon’ season 1 episode 10.\n\nReaders of George's book know that Cregan plays a huge role down the line. The creators kept pretty quiet, however, when asked if we'd see him in season 2. \"I don’t know, will we? I can’t answer that,\" Ryan teased to Variety. \"We will cast Cregan Stark at some point, but no comment otherwise.\"\n\nAnother arc floating around the writer's room? Blood and Cheese. Those words alone are sure to trigger Fire & Blood readers — they reference the nicknames of two characters who carry out a revenge plot against the Greens on behalf of the Blacks following Lucerys' death. Without giving too much away, the plot hinges on Daemon's philosophy: \"An eye for an eye, a son for a son.\"\n\nIn Sara's Variety interview, she confirmed that the HBO adaptation will portray the bloody trade, adding, \"I don’t think you will be disappointed.\"\n\nAs for everything else that'll ensue, Ryan can only describe season 2 as \"complex.\" The one thing we know for sure is that it'll continue to follow Rhaenyra and Alicent's families. Ryan told Entertainment Weekly that he's interested in \"seeing what happens now that we've flipped the chessboard over and spilled the pieces on the ground.\"\n\nHe added: \"How do all those react? That's the story that we tell in season 2 and beyond.\"\n\nHow can I watch House of the Dragon?"
