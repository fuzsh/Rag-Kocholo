        "text": "Shrink Wrapped. Still in the original factory shrink wrap, with condition visible through shrink noted. For example, \"SW (NM)\" means shrink wrapped in near-mint condition.\n\nNear Mint. Like new with only the slightest wear, many times indistinguishable from a Mint item. Close to perfect, very collectible.\n\nBoard & war games in this condition will show very little to no wear and are considered to be punched unless the condition note says unpunched."
