        "text": "House of the Dragon is returning to screens on June 16 in the US and June 17 in the UK. It's so close we can almost hear the dragons roar!\n\nBy now, true fans have already pored over all the trailer content for clues of what to come.\n\nFirst-look images teased unspeakable devastation on the horizon and in true Game of Thrones style, not everyone will make it out alive. The repercussions will be monumental.\n\nWe know you can't wait for the upcoming second outing, so without further delay, here's everything we know about House of the Dragon season two.\n\nWhen is House of the Dragon season 2 on? Where can I watch it?\n\nHouse of the Dragon season two will debut on HBO/Max at 9/8c on Sunday, June 16, 2024 in the US. This works out to 2am on Monday, June 17 in the UK, where the show airs on Sky Atlantic and NOW.\n\nThis news will no doubt be welcomed by fans, who were previously led to believe that the second instalment would land in August 2024. The wait period may be delightfully shorter but, sadly, so is the run of episodes.\n\nSeason two is set to be just eight episodes long, compared to the debut season's 10, but director Clare Kilner has promised they will be just as impactful.\n\n\"There are eight wonderful episodes with so much happening in every episode, and we have trouble, at times, bringing them down to one hour. Ryan's decision was to give it a good opening and a good ending, and they're jam-packed with emotional and visually exciting events,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nIf you're still a little bummed by the reduction of episodes, don't worry, because we've got some news that will get you more fired up than Vhagar. Work has already begun on the plot for seasons three and four.\n\nSpeaking towards the end of 2023, creator George RR Martin revealed: \"[I was] locked in a room with Ryan Condal and his writing staff (Sara Hess, Ti Mikkel, David Hancock and Philippa Goslett) talking about the third and fourth seasons of House of the Dragon.\n\n\"They were lively, fun discussions, and we got some good work done… though two days was not nearly enough. There is so much ground to cover that I am not sure 20 days would have been enough.\"\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 2 release date schedule: When will all the episodes of HoD air?\n\nHouse of the Dragon season two has promised to be a vengeful bloodbath, starting with the opening episode's title. According to Redanian Intelligence, season two's debut episode has been dubbed 'A Son for a Son'. It echoes the pain of Rhaenyra's loss, and we suspect scores will be settled on multiple fronts.\n\nSeason two will follow the same weekly release schedule as the first, meaning each episode will land as follows:\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 1: Sunday, June 16 (US), Monday, June 17 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 2: Sunday, June 23 (US), Monday, June 24 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 3: Sunday, June 30 (US), Monday, July 1 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 4: Sunday, July 7 (US), Monday, July 8 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 5: Sunday, July 14 (US), Monday, July 15 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 6: Sunday, July 21 (US), Monday, July 22 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 7: Sunday, July 28 (US), Monday, July 29 (UK)\n\n• House of the Dragon season 2, episode 8 (finale): Sunday, August 4 (US), Monday, August 5 (UK)\n\nTom's Guide reports that season two episode four will be called 'A Dance of Dragons', referring to the book term for the Targaryens' war of succession.\n\nIf that's true, it's tipped to be a pivotal turning point in the story. The supposed title suggests that episode four will be the culmination of all the tension that's been building, kickstarting the war. We remained poised and ready for the action.\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 2 cast: Who will be coming back?\n\nHouse of the Dragon season one spoilers follow.\n\nVhagar took a massive bite out of Prince Lucerys (Elliot Grihault) and his dragon Arrax, so Rhaenyra's boy will not be returning for season two. We're sure, however, that the implications of his death will be massive.\n\nAlso not joining season two's cast is Paddy Considine. Sadly, King Viserys has hung his crown up on the Iron Throne, leaving his squabbling children to cut each other down on their way to retrieve it.\n\nEmma D'Arcy will reprise the role of the named heir Rhaenyra Targaryen, as she grapples for her claim to the Iron Throne. Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) will no doubt continue to bar her way.\n\nIt's Greens versus Blacks, so key figures will return to rally around their choice of monarch. Matt Smith's Prince Daemon and Eve Best's Princess Rhaenys will be back to fortify Rhaenyra's defences.\n\nRhys Ifans and Fabien Frankel will return as Otto Hightower and Ser Criston Cole, respectively, in support of Aegon and Alicent.\n\nWhat's a civil war without the Targaryen and Velaryon kids? From this brawling cousin-nephew-uncle mix, here are the ones on the cards to return:\n\n• Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon II Targaryen\n\n• Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen\n\n• Phia Saban as Helaena Targaryen\n\n• Harry Collett as Jacaerys Velaryon\n\n• Phoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen\n\n• Bethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen\n\nNew faces may also join the crew as we'd expect Rhaenyra's younger children Joffrey Velaryon, Aegon 'the younger' Targaryen and Viserys Targaryen to be aged up later down the line. No hope for Daeron Targaryen (Alicent and Viserys' other child on page). He seems to have been bumped off the family tree in the TV adaptation. Wonder what he did wrong?\n\nCorlys Velaryon's fate looked dicey. The Driftwood Lord was close to death at the end of season one but he appeared to recover. Given Steve Toussaint's filming announcement, it's safe to say he pulled through.\n\nWe very much doubt Laenor will return, unless life after faked death isn't all it's cracked up to be. While we were pleased with his happy-ending arc, we'd never say no to more John MacMillan.\n\nMatthew Needham's Larys Strong is bound to come back for more manipulation games (and his royal foot fetish).\n\nThe cast also continues to grow, with Variety announcing several actors who'll play characters new and old.\n\nGLOW's Gayle Rankin will play healer and Harrenhal resident Alys Rivers. Alys appears in Martin's novel Fire & Blood, and is described as a witch whose mysterious visions see her rising to a position of importance with the Greens.\n\nMary & George's Sir (Ser?) Simon Russell Beale joins the cast as Ser Simon Strong, who is Lord Larys Strong's great-uncle and the castellan of Harrenhal.\n\nSlow Horses' Freddie Fox has also signed up as Ser Gwayne Hightower, Alicent's brother and Otto's son, while Napoleon's Abubakar Salim joins the cast as sailor Alyn of Hull, who was part of the Velaryon fleet during the Stepstones campaign. So there are many new faces to join the raging battle to come!\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 2 plot: What will happen?\n\n\"There is no war so hateful to the gods as a war between kin. And no war so bloody as a war between dragons.\"\n\nThose were the chilling words of Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best) in the season-two teaser trailer, and we can almost taste the carnage to come.\n\nUntil now, both Alicent and Rhaenyra have attempted to chart a peaceful course through the chaos Viserys left in his wake with his deathbed words. Lucerys' death, however, is about to blow that all out of the water, as Rhaenyra will likely seek immediate recompense for her son's demise.\n\nGiven Aemond's past actions, she's unlikely to believe that Lucerys' death was an accident. If Aemond sought an eye for an eye, Rhaenyra could very well seek a son for a son and make an attempt not just on the throne, but on Aemond's life too.\n\nHer vengeance could result in other calamities too, which have already been teased in filming pictures for season two. The shots appear to be of a funeral procession scene, with a couple of Hightowers front and centre.\n\nAlicent and daughter Helaena sit in a horse-drawn carriage, and both are draped in black veils, which doesn't bode well for the Greens. Caught in the corner of the snap is what looks like a coffin.\n\nMake of that what you will, however, it does appear as though season two means to stick quite close to the story George R R Martin has already penned. But no spoilers here. If you want the full breakdown of what's potentially to come, you can find the overview in our Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon timeline.\n\nSadly, Rhaenyra actress D'Arcy teased a lot less shared-screen time between her, Smith and Cooke, when They admitted that filming without the pair was \"kind of lonely,\" (via The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nThis suggests that the trio will be delving much more deeper into their individual storylines this season, leaving less time for that tense lover-ex-friends-enemy dynamic to directly play out on screen; but shove down that disappointment. According to D'Arcy the results will make it so worth it.\n\n\"There's so many beautiful actors on the show, it's an ever-mutating thing. Certainly, I think it'll make the active viewership kind of more exciting because there are so many parts to the series that I've not had the chance to watch yet,\" they added.\n\nFans of the source material can also expect a treat as writer and producer Sara Hess fuelled theories that season two could feature one of the most brutal storylines from the books.\n\nWhen asked about the 'Blood and Cheese' revenge plot that follows Lucerys' death in the book, Hess told Variety \"I don't think you will be disappointed.\"\n\nBut the show so far has already been adapting and changing things to suit its own path, which means things could pan out a little differently on screen. There are still more twists in store for season two, that's for sure.\n\nEither way, the unfolding events will undoubtedly put further, if not irreversible, strain on the relationship between Alicent and Rhaenyra, just when they were starting to mend their frail bond.\n\nTom Glynn-Carney, who plays Rhaenyra's brother in the series, teased an expansion of his role in the coming season.\n\nSpeaking at the Game of Thrones Fan Convention (via EW), he said: \"I'm looking forward to having Aegon have a lot more meat to get his teeth stuck into and to cause more havoc, really, and to throw a spanner in the works, which he does so well.\"\n\nBaela and Rhaena will also likely see their roles fleshed out as they become embroiled in the upcoming war.\n\nHouse of the Dragon season 2 trailer: When can I watch it?\n\nHouse of the Dragon's trailers have teased an epic battle to come. Sides have been drawn in blood. Even you must pick which team you're backing, and that choice starts with which trailer you watch – Green or Black (there's only one right choice, please see above if you're confused).\n\nWhile the Blacks prepare to back Rhaenyra's rightful claim to the Iron Throne, the Greens can be seen charting their own course to victory.\n\nWith a wry smile, Aemond calls out uncle Daemon: \"If he dares face me,\" his fighting words capturing the unruly spirit of the Greens' cause.\n\nThe path to victory is one of violence, so to war they go – not long until we find out just how bloody things will get.\n\nTo watch the trailer for the Greens (here) is to betray the one true queen, but we all must make a choice.\n\nHouse of the Dragon season two will debut on June 16 in the US on HBO and Max and June 17 in UK on and NOW. Season one is available to stream now on , Sky Atlantic and NOW."
