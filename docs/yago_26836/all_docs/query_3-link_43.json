        "text": "Spoilers for House of the Dragon below.\n\nHouse of the Dragon has been renewed for a second season on HBO, which comes as no surprise following the show’s record-breaking premiere on August 21, 2022. Given its predecessor, Game of Thrones, dominated TV for eight seasons, House of the Dragon stands to reignite another years-long reign for the fantasy franchise based on George R. R. Martin’s books. (The author is also an executive producer on the series.)\n\nHouse of the Dragon was nominated for a total of seven Creative Arts Emmys, and received the award for outstanding fantasy/sci-fi costumes. The series also received a Primetime Emmy nomination for outstanding drama series,\n\n“We are beyond proud of what the entire House of the Dragon team has accomplished with season 1,” Francesca Orsi, executive vice president of HBO programming, said in a statement. “Our phenomenal cast and crew undertook a massive challenge and exceeded all expectations, delivering a show that has already established itself as must-see-TV. A huge thank you to George, Ryan, and Miguel for leading us on this journey. We couldn’t be more excited to continue bringing to life the epic saga of House Targaryen with season two.”\n\nWhile the premise for the next season remains unconfirmed, we can expect a dive deeper into the history of House Targaryen and the civil war called the Dance of Dragons, just as in the show’s source material, Martin’s Fire & Blood.\n\nWhen does House of the Dragon season 2 come out?\n\nDuring an HBO and Max presentation on Nov. 2, 2023, HBO CEO Casey Bloys confirmed that the series would return summer 2024. He said that season 2 is “done shooting and in post” and the hope is “to have that early summer at this point.” He also debuted a trailer to a group of journalists in New York, prefacing that the Greens and the Blacks are “circling each other in the time of war.”\n\nCo-showrunner Ryan Condal had previously shared that season 2 production was moving as quickly as possible, telling Variety, “Because of the incredibly demanding production schedule of the show, facets of the show have to overlap with one another, which means that we were writing season 2 long before they ever announced it, while we were in post in season 1. So we really have to storm right into the making of season 2 now in order to keep pace with our our fans’ healthy appetites for material and HBO’s need and desire to release the show in a reasonable timeframe from season to season.”\n\nOn March 4, 2024, JB Perrette, the CEO and president of global streaming and games for Warner Bros. Discovery, really narrowed down when House of the Dragon season 2 will be released. According to Daily Mail, the executive spoke at the Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media, and Telecom conference and revealed that the upcoming season will come out this June.\n\nIs season 2 filming yet?\n\nAfter the Hollywood writers’ strike began in May 2023, Martin himself addressed fans’ concerns about its impact on House of the Dragon’s schedule. He shared the following update on his personal blog: “Across the ocean, the second season of House of the Dragon started filming April 11 and will continue in London and Wales. The scripts for the eight s2 episodes were all finished months ago, long before the strike began. Every episode has gone through four or five drafts and numerous rounds of revisions, to address HBO notes, my notes, budget concerns, etc. There will be no further revisions. The writers have done their jobs; the rest is in the hands of the directors, cast and crew… and of course the dragons.”\n\nBloys later confirmed, in November, that season 2 had finished shooting.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nMax released the first teaser on December 2, which features the Blacks and the Greens circling war. “The war will be fought, many will die, and the victor will eventually ascend the throne,” Alicent says. Watch below.\n\nA second exciting “deuling” trailer came out in March 2024. It was comprised of two POVs, one focusing on Rhaenrya, Prince Daemon and Dragonstone, the other on King’s Landing and Alicent, Otto, King Aegon, and Prince Aemond.\n\nWho will be in the cast?\n\nHBO confirmed the season 2 cast includes: Matt Smith as Daemon Targaryen, Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, Emma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen, Eve Best as Rhaenys Targaryen, Steve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon, Fabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole, Ewan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen, Tom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen, Sonoya Mizuno as Mysaria, and Rhys Ifans as Otto Hightower. Additional returning cast includes Harry Collett as Jacaerys Velaryon, Bethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen, Phoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen, Phia Saban as Helaena Targaryen, Jefferson Hall Jefferson Hall as Tyland and Jason Lannister, and Matthew Needham as Larys Strong.\n\nWe’re expecting to see more of Graham McTavish as Ser Harrold Westerling, too. Some characters’ chances of returning are up in the air, like Laenor Velaryon (John Macmillan), who’s still alive but faked his death and exiled himself from Westeros. Could he return in the second season to shake things up? Or will we have to wait longer (á la Gendry) for his grand comeback?\n\nUnfortunately, we said goodbye to Milly Alcock and Emily Carey as young Rhaenyra and Alicent after the season 1 mid-season time jump. Despite hopes that they could show up in flashback scenes in season 2, showrunner Ryan Condal says the young duo probably won’t return. “[They] are not a part of the story that we’re telling, yet,” he told Variety. “That’s not a thing that we’re doing right now.” Paddy Considine also took his final bow as Viserys in episode 8, so he won’t return either.\n\nWe can expect a number of new cast additions in season 2, however. Condal teased to Variety, for instance, that the characters Cregan Stark and Daeron Targaryen will make appearances—but he kept his lips sealed as to who will play them.\n\nWe also know of four other roles that were cast, according to Deadline: Simon Russell Beale (The Death of Stalin) joins as Ser Simon Strong, Lord Larys' great uncle and head of Harrenhal. Freddie Fox (The Three Musketeers) will play Ser Gwayne Hightower, Otto Hightower’s son and Queen Alicent’s brother (he's also an uncle to King Aegon, Queen Helaena, and Prince Aemond). Gayle Rankin (Glow) will portray Alys Rivers, a healer at Harrenhal. Abubakar Salim (Raised by Wolves) will play Alyn of Hull, a Velaryon fleet sailor who fought in the Stepstones.\n\nEmma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen\n\nOlivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower\n\nMatt Smith as Daemon Targaryen\n\nSteve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon\n\nEwan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen\n\nWhat about the dragons?\n\nGreat question. Almost 10 majestic winged creatures appear in House of the Dragon season 1 (and even more are mentioned by name), but there will be some additions in season 2. “You’re going to meet five new dragons” next season, Condal said at a For Your Consideration event on March 7, 2023. We can’t wait.\n\nWho will run the series?\n\nMiguel Sapochnik, Dragon co-showrunner and former Game of Thrones director, stepped away from the series in August. Co-creator Condal will continue showrunning while Alan Taylor, a Thrones veteran, will join as an executive producer and will direct multiple episodes next season, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhat will season 2 be about?\n\nGiven the series tells the story of the Dance of the Dragons, we can expect to see more events from the Targaryen civil war hit the screen. Season 1 ended with a tragic death for Queen Rhaenyra, so the next chapter will explore the aftermath. While most of the first season revolved around the events leading up to the civil war, the second season will depict the conflict in full swing.\n\nCondal told The Sunday Times that the next season will have a faster pace. “Series 2 will hit the rhythms people came to expect from the middle run of Game of Thrones, but it will have been earned, and viewers will feel the tragedies because we put the work in,” he said per IndieWire.\n\nHe also teased that they plan to include “natural pathways into moments of levity”—in other words, more humor. That might be difficult without Peter Dinklage playing Tyrion Lannister in Dragon, but Matt Smith might help fill that gap. “I think Matt Smith is very funny,” Condal added. “If there is one character that does not care, it is Daemon.”\n\nHow many episodes will there be?\n\nSeason 2 will have eight episodes (two fewer than season 1), according to Deadline, but the change is “part of a long-term plan for the show,” which could include HBO greenlighting a third season.\n\nHow many seasons will House of the Dragon have?\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin has a number in mind. “It is going to take four full seasons of 10 episodes each to do justice to the Dance of the Dragons, from start to finish,” he wrote in a post on his website. However, HBO has yet to confirm plans of a four-season arc. The series could even go on for longer, considering Game of Thrones went on for eight seasons, with the last two departing from Martin’s books.\n\nThis story will be updated."
