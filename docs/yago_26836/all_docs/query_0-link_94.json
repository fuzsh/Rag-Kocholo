        "text": "David Mamet's The House of Games and David Lynch's Blue Velvet\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to control another person's mind? The mere capabilities of someone possessing this powerful of an influence on others has a twisted and very horrifying , yet interesting sense of bewildering control and has boggled the minds of many for centuries. There have been several instances of historical examples in which a person in power somehow persuades the people under them to surrender their personal beliefs and submit to authority. Although, there are many more instances of this nature that occur in everyday life also. It must be incredibly exhilarating to get into someone's most private thoughts or easily attain their unquestioning trust with the things you say and what you do. I think the power to persuade someone else fits in exclusively with certain characters within the films we viewed in class. Although complete control over another person is difficult and rare, this main theme of dominant human interaction occurs several times throughout each movie.\n\nMike, the con man in The House of Games, was extremely talented at this concept and continued to perfect it. He once told the woman who was intrigued by his line of \"work\" that in order to get someone else's confidence, you had to give them yours. He tried twice to fool her out of her money, the first unsuccessful and the second hitting home. She had given him her complete and utmost trust and adoration which made her an easy target to be taken advantage of. Mike's experience of human nature helped him know exactly what to do to get what he wanted from other people. The way he conquered the minds of his unsuspecting victims was through the simple and popular tactic of deception.\n\nMany people today use others to achieve their selfish desires, lacking the ambition to reach the top through honest, trustworthy, and admirable means. Instead, they find what they think to be the most direct route to success and usually end up using the ones who they think can get them there. Using someone often means making them think the way you want them to. This is what the movie was trying to portray to the viewer. When Mike was sitting around the table discussing with his accomplices how easily he had outwitted the woman, it conveyed to me that he thought that the world is merely a game to be won by the strongest and most competitive soul who risks the most to become the person they think is the best."
