        "text": "House Of The Dragon Season 2 is in full swing after last night’s excellent episode. Both of the first two episodes of HBO’s Game Of Thrones prequel have ended in fire and blood, punctuating the rather sedate pacing of each entry with bursts of violence.\n\nIn my review of Episode 2 I noted that the series is a very different type of show than Thrones; less heroic fantasy and more Shakespearean tragedy. Still, while it has a very different mood and pacing, so far it has yet to disappoint.\n\n\"Of course, I am hardly objective when talking about anything based on my own work… but I have to say, I thought both episodes were just great. (And they are not even finished yet),\" author George R.R. Martin said of the first two episodes. \"Dark, mind you. Very dark. They may make you cry. (I did not cry myself, but one of my friends did). Powerful, emotional, gut-wrenching, heart rending. Just the sort of thing I like.\"\n\nMartin is not only the author of A Song Of Ice And Fire upon which Game Of Thrones is based, but also Fire & Blood, a fictional history of the Targaryen dynasty. House of the Dragon is adapted from just one section of that sprawling volume, which itself is just Part 1 of two planned books detailing the reign of the Targaryen kings and queens, loosely based on the real history of the Plantagenet dynasty in England.\n\nAnother key difference between the shows? The story of the Targaryen civil war known as The Dance Of Dragons is already finished. “It became clear what we needed to do, and how to bring it to an end, and where,” showrunner Ryan Condal told Variety. “We have the advantage that the book is here, it’s finished, and we know where the curtain closes on this particular chapter in the Targaryen history.”\n\nWhen Do New Episodes Of ‘House Of The Dragon’ Come To HBO And Max?\n\nNew episodes of House Of The Dragon Season 2 release on HBO and streaming service Max every Sunday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET between June 20th and August 4th. The full episode release schedule is below:\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1: ‘A Son For A Son’ — June 21st, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2: ‘Rhaenyra The Cruel’ — June 22nd, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 3: “TBA” — June 30, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 4: “TBA” — July 7, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 5: “TBA” — July 14, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 6: “TBA” — July 21, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 7: “TBA” — July 28, 2024\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8: “TBA” — August 4, 2024\n\nRead my review of Episode 1 here. Read my review of Episode 2 here.\n\nThe series is already renewed for a third season, with four seasons planned at HBO. Expect a great deal more dragon warfare, plenty of death and misery, and lots of unexpected twists and turns.\n\nMax has raised prices recently.
