        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n26 Aug 2022, 14:13\n\nCredit: BBC\n\nThere's 100 new episodes to enjoy!\n\nOur favourite games master Richard Osman has confirmed that House Of Games is returning to our screens, with an on air date of Monday, September 5th.\n\nThe hit quiz show, played on a weekly basis, sees four celebrities playing on five consecutive days, with the aim of winning daily prizes, and the weekly prize of being crowned as House of Games champion.\n\nAnyone who has watched the show has a favourite game that's played on the show, with some of our favourites being 'The Backwards Round' (players are given questions, but the words are in reverse order, players must give their answers in reverse) and Richard's Junk (players are shown a picture of various junk items, players are given 15 seconds to memorise the items before the picture disappears).\n\nWhat dastardly pursuits will Richard ask contestants to take part in this season?\n\nThe return of the show comes as something of a surprise since Richard, who stepped down as the host of the BBC's Pointless this Spring, has recently said he's enjoying being out of the limelight.\n\nHe's now a bestselling author thanks to The Thursday Murder Club series – third entry The Bullet That Missed is out next month – which sounds like it was the career he was always meant to have.\n\n\"I spent my whole working life in telly where you're surrounded by people all the time,\" he told The Mail on Sunday's You. But I've surprised myself by finding I really enjoyed shutting the door, sitting down and writing.\n\n\"I don't feel alone,\" he insisted. \"I'm surrounded by my characters and I'm an introvert by nature so, actually, the extrovert stuff is the weird stuff.\"\n\nLet's hope that the 'weird stuff' manifests itself in the games Richard asks his contestants to play."
