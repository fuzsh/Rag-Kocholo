        "text": "Emily’s everyday life is shattered when a strange woman knocks at her door, begging for her help as a frightening meteor descends from the sky. In an instant, she’s whisked away to the mysterious House of the Lancasters, where she discovers she has a special gift: the inner light. Now Emily’s power is the only thing that can stop the dark disease that threatens to swallow the entire world. This deadly infection corrupts anything it touches: humans, animals, even plants and inanimate objects, turning them into violent monsters. Work together with your new family to fight back and restore the world, before it’s too late!\n\nReturn to the House of 1,000 Doors to save mankind from annihilation! Giant snakes have burst out of the Earth and are wreaking destruction across every continent. Your mission: travel back in time to four different epochs to gather the elements needed to activate a machine that can destroy the ancient beasts.\n\nA cursed gem that has left a trail of smoldering bodies in its wake is threatening the residents of the House of 1,000 Doors, prompting the head of the mystical dwelling, Gabriel, to once again summon Kate Reed to its aid. Guide Kate as she searches Tibet, Jerusalem, Madagascar and more for the artifacts that can break the power of the gem.\n\nWhen the dead cannot find release, the House of 1000 Doors serves as a portal that allows the living to help them. As Kate Reed, you must communicate with spirits and meet the mysterious Lancaster family that resides within the spooky house."
