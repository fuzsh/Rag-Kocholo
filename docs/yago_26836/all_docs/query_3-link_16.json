        "text": "Broken Karaoke is a Round 3 game in Richard Osman's House of Games. It was first played in Episode 1.\n\nRules[]\n\nAll contestants are shown a song's lyrics as they would appear on a karaoke machine. However, the karaoke machine is broken and only displays the first letter of each word. The first contestant to buzz in with the title of the song scores a point.\n\nFrom Series 2 onward, if all lyrics are shown without any contestant identifying the correct song, the first letter of each word of the song's title is then shown below the lyrics.\n\nFrom Series 1 to Series 3, as well as in Night Series 1 and Festive Series 1, contestants were shown the year the song was released before being shown the lyrics. From Series 4 onward, the contestants are instead given the song's genre, and the genres are treated like categories (i.e., contestants are shown 2-3 songs of the same genre before moving on to the next genre).\n\nRecap style[]\n\nIn episode articles, playings of Broken Karaoke are formatted as follows.\n\nIn this example, in the first question, the fourth contestant gave the correct answer on the first buzz, which occurred at letter 2 of line 3. In the second question, the first contestant buzzed in at letter 5 of line 1 and timed out, then the fourth contestant buzzed in at letter 4 of line 2 and gave an incorrect answer, then the second contestant buzzed in immediately afterward and gave the correct answer.\n\nQuestions and Answers Q# Year Lyrics Answer 1 Year 1 L Y R I C S\n\nN E X T\n\nL I N E S Answer 1 2 Year 2 L Y R I C S\n\nO T H E R\n\nS O N G Answer 2\n\nContestant Responses Q# Contestant 1 Contestant 2 Contestant 3 Contestant 4 1 (3:2) Answer 1 2 (1:5) [timed out] (2:4-2) Answer 2 (2:4-1) Answer 3"
