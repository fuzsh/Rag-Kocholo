        "text": "When Game of Thrones aired its series finale back in May 2019, did you really think that was the end? That HBO would leave well enough alone? Seriously?\n\nWe're not referencing the upcoming Game of Thrones-adjacent series House of the Dragon and The Tales of Dunk and Egg, by the way. We're talking about last year's dispatch from The Hollywood Reporter, which revealed that Game of Thrones will get somewhat of a sequel series. According to the outlet, Kit Harington will return to the role that nabbed him two Emmy nominations in \"a live-action spinoff series centered on the fan-favorite character Jon Snow.\" Whew! From a larger, Game of Thrones perspective, this marks what might be a change in direction for the franchise—meaning that we could see what happened to the remaining characters, as opposed to just watching the prequel series in perpetuity.\n\nWhile some members of the cast have expressed intrigue in joining the series, don't look for Jon Snow's erstwhile aunt (and lover!) Daenerys Targaryen anytime soon. When asked if she'd ever reprise the role, Emilia Clarke told The Hollywood Reporter, “No, I think I’m done.” Recently, Clarke doubled down on her stance in an interview with Extra. “I don’t think so,” she replied when asked about appearing on the show. “Kit, I love you. I’ma watch that one because of you or I’m gonna tell you that I did, but I won’t be in it. No, I don’t think so. He hasn’t called.”\n\nTo be fair, Daenerys—spoiler alert—dies in the final season. The only way she could reappear is through flashbacks, but that doesn’t seem likely. Arya Stark could return though. Actress Maisie Williams weighed in on the series and said,\"Everything surrounding the story [of GOT] is very exciting. We had such a rich show, and there's still so much story to tell. I think it's really exciting, and I think that Kit is such a phenomenal actor. Him playing Jon Snow was just like a cultural reset. I think everything that he touches is magic, and I'm excited to see what it's going to be.\" Though she didn't say it in so many words, it sounds like Williams may be open to reprising her role as Arya Stark. She wouldn't be the only Thrones alum open to returning; Gwendoline Christie, whose fan-favorite character Brienne of Tarth survived the bloody series, told Newsweek, “Brienne of Tarth is incredibly close to my heart, and I would relish any opportunity to revisit her. I believe she is enduring.” Similarly, John Bradley, who played Jon's best buddy Samwell Tarley, left the door open, telling Digital Spy, \"I haven't spoken to anybody about the potential Jon Snow prequel, but if somebody wants to send a script my way I’d be interested to read it.\"\n\nAlong with the cast, the literary world's most relatable procrastinator, George R. R. Martin, has weighed in on the series—and offered a few interesting details about its conception. Mainly, that the series was originally dreamed up by Harington himself. \"Yes, it was Kit Harington who brought the idea to us,\" the author wrote on his website. \"I cannot tell you the names of the writers/showrunners, since that has not been cleared for release yet… but Kit brought them in too, his own team, and they are terrific.\" He goes on to confirm that he is involved with the making of the series, which currently has the working title, Snow. So there you go. If you want to read the Winds of Winter scribe's thoughts on the state of journalism in the rest of the post, here it is."
