        "text": "It’s hard to overstate what an incredible screenwriter David Mamet is (for the younger generation, he’s Zosia’s dad). He wrote Glengarry Glen Ross for stage and film, which was enough to send my younger self on a weeks-long David Mamet binge. There’s House of Games, The Spanish Prisoner, all his work with Ricky Jay, The Untouchables, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Verdict, Wag the Dog, and a brilliant network television show well ahead of its time, The Unit.\n\nHe had a specific, clipped style, and he often put his wife Rebecca Pidgeon in his movies, even though she wasn’t a great actress (she seemed well suited to his style of writing, all the same). He won a Pulitzer Prize and has an Oscar nomination!\n\nHe’s also a conservative, and not just a McCain conservative. He’s anti-union, so much so that he opposed both the 2007 and 2023 writers’ strikes. At the L.A. Times Festival of Books, Mamet also had some opinions to share. For instance, he thinks that “DEI is garbage,” that it is “fascist totalitarianism,” and that they are orchestrated by “diversity capos” and “diversity commissars.”\n\n“I can’t give you a stupid f***ing statue unless you have 7% of this, 8% of that … it’s intrusive,” Mamet said, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year with Bill Maher, however, Mamet also decried “wokeism” while maybe unintentionally pointing out its benefits.\n\n“The bright side of wokeism is when you turn on the television … all of the commercials and most of the people in television shows are people of color. So, it’s bad for white actors but on the other hand, it used to be bad for Black actors. But the good thing is that white America gets used to looking at Black people not as Sidney Poitier, not as Willie Best, but as people and that’s really great.”\n\nUh, that’s the point, David! Is it possible that Mamet — a longtime progressive whose parents were literal communists — has turned conservative because his career has dried up? He hasn’t made anything notable since The Unit, nor a successful movie since 2001’s Heist. Who knows?\n\nBut for those hoping that he’s “conservative” but not MAGA, I have bad news, according to an interview he gave to The Guardian two years ago. He thought Trump was a great president.\n\n“Well, he did a great job as a president … Well, if you put everything you see on these little screens aside and look at what happened during the Trump presidency. We told China to knock it off. We told NATO to start paying their fair share. We moved the Embassy of the United States to Jerusalem in Israel … Gas prices were down. There was the lowest Black unemployment in history …”\n\nBlack unemployment is even lower under Biden. Presidents have no control over gas prices. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem is not looking like the best idea these days, the trade wars with China have been disastrous, and our relationship with NATO during the Trump presidency made our country less safe and less respected. But you go off, David.\n\nAt least he’s not an election denier, right?\n\n“The idea that people are not going to steal elections is ignorance because people steal elections all the time. The question is: ‘What was the extent of the election rigging?’ I don’t know. But was it questionable? Yes.”\n\nGoddamnit."
