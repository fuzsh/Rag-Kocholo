        "text": "The Targaryen dynasty is about to spark a civil war in the second season of the popular prequel to \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nThe debut season finale of \"House of the Dragon\" set the stage for an epic civil war – dragons fighting dragons, kin fighting kin.\n\nAnd now, the battle for the Iron Throne and the power over the Seven Kingdoms that comes with it is set to commence this summer.\n\nThe highly anticipated second season of the \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff is set to premiere June 16 on HBO. Picking up where Season 1 left off, it will chronicle the upcoming war between factions fighting for King Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) and Queen Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) over which of the Targaryens will rule Westeros.\n\nHere's what to know about \"House of the Dragon\" Season 2.\n\nWhen does 'House of the Dragon' Season 2 premiere?\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" Season 2 will premiere at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Sunday, June 16.\n\nHow to watch 'House of the Dragon' Season 2\n\nThe series will air exclusively on HBO's TV channel and will available to stream on Max, HBO's streaming service.\n\nPlans begin at $9.99 a month with ads, which allows users to stream on up to two devices at one time. Ad-free subscriptions are $15.99 a month, which includes the additional ability to download up to 30 titles to watch on the go. The highest tier, which is $19.99 a month, includes the ability to stream on four devices and offers 4K Ultra HD video quality and 100 downloads.\n\nCritic's take: 'House of the Dragon' review: Season 2 is good, bad and very ugly all at once\n\n'House of the Dragon' Season 2 trailer\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" is based on the world created by George R.R. Martin in his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series of fantasy novels. A prequel to \"Game of Thrones,\" the series documents the division and fall of the Targaryen dynasty.\n\nWhen Season 1 ended in October 2022, war appeared on the horizon for the Seven Kingdoms when the death of King Viserys I (Paddy Considine) left a power vacuum in Westeros and a question as to his chosen successor. As the second season begins, Westeros is on the brink of a bloody civil war with powerful houses being forced to choose sides.\n\n\"War is coming, and neither of us may win,\" Rhaenyra says – presumably to Aegon – in a trailer HBO released May 14 for the upcoming season.\n\nWatch it here:\n\nMax also released \"dueling trailers\" March 21 asking viewers to pick a side by selecting the color corresponding to a specific council: the Green Council of King Aegon or the Black Council of Queen Rhaenyra. Those trailers can be found here.\n\nCast of 'House of the Dragon'\n\nMany new arrivals will appear in the upcoming season alongside familiar faces from the initial cast. Returning cast members:\n\nMatt Smith as Daemon Targaryen\n\nOlivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower\n\nEmma D’Arcy as Rhaenyra Targaryen\n\nEve Best as Rhaenys Targaryen\n\nSteve Toussaint as Corlys Velaryon\n\nFabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole\n\nEwan Mitchell as Aemond Targaryen\n\nTom Glynn-Carney as Aegon Targaryen\n\nSonoya Mizuno as Mysaria\n\nRhys Ifans as Otto Hightower\n\nHarry Collett as Jacaerys Velaryon\n\nBethany Antonia as Baela Targaryen\n\nPhoebe Campbell as Rhaena Targaryen\n\nPhia Saban as Halaena Targaryen\n\nJefferson Hall as Tyland and Jason Lannister\n\nMatthew Needham as Larys Strong\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.
