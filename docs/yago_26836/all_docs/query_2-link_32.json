Author of over one hundred stage plays, screenplays, novels, essay collections, memoirs, theatrical how-to books, and children's books, Mamet also directs in the theater and for film. He has won numerous Tony Awards for his stage productions, a Pulitzer Prize, and has garnered Academy Award nominations for his screenplays. As a contributor for About.com noted, \"Mamet proves himself a master of every genre he tries.\" Talent breeds celebrity. He is, according to Jenelle Riley, writing in Back Stage West, \"an artist whose name is so revered he need only be referred to by his last name. . . . And anyone who knows or values the written word is aware of [Mamet's] impact on the entertainment medium in the last 30 years.\" Mamet has acquired a great deal of critical recognition for his plays, each one a microcosmic view of the American experience. \"He's that rarity, a pure writer,\" noted Jack Kroll in Newsweek, \"and the synthesis he appears to be making, with echoes from voices as diverse as Beckett, Pinter, and Hemingway, is unique and exciting.\" Since 1976, Mamet's plays have been widely produced in regional theaters and in New York City. One of Mamet's most successful plays, Glengarry Glen Ross, earned the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for best American play and the Pulitzer Prize in drama, both in 1984. Critics have also praised Mamet's screen-writing; he received Academy Award nominations for best adapted screenplay for The Verdict in 1983, and for Wag the Dog in 1998.\n\nMamet \"has carved out a career as one of America's most creative playwrights,\" observed Mel Gussow in the New York Times, \"with a particular affinity for working-class characters.\" These characters and their language give Mamet's work its distinct flavor. Mamet is, according to Kroll, \"that rare bird, an American playwright who's a language playwright.\" \"Playwriting is simply showing how words influence actions and vice versa,\" Mamet explained to People contributor Linda Witt. \"All my plays attempt to bring out the poetry in the plain, everyday language people use. That's the only way to put art back into the theater.\" Mamet has been accused of eavesdropping, simply recording the insignificant conversations of which everyone is aware; yet, many reviewers recognize the playwright's artistic intent. Jean M. White commented in the Washington Post that \"Mamet has an ear for vernacular speech and uses cliche with telling effect.\" Furthermore, added Kroll, \"Mamet is the first playwright to create a formal and moral shape out of the undeleted expletives of our foul-mouthed time.\"\n\nMaking a Life in the Theater\n\nIn his personal and creative life, Mamet has resisted the lure of Broadway, its establishment, and its formulas for success. He was born and raised in Chicago where his father was a labor lawyer. Though he no longer lives there, many of the values that still define him were formed in that city. \"I came from a very bourgeois background,\" Mamet told a contributor for the Village Voice in an interview. \"But in Chicago I was always exposed to a wider variety of lives. Summer jobs, the steel mills, factories, that sort of thing.\" Mamet grew up in a Jewish neighborhood on Chicago's south side. His lawyer father aided his son's natural ear for language. An amateur semanticist, his father imbued the young Mamet with a sense of the rhythm of language, a skill aided by the piano lessons he took. The divorce of Mamet's parents in 1957 also had an effect on the author's later work. He moved with his mother to the north side of the city into a new development with sanitized model homes. As he told Robert Wahls of the New York Daily News, \"I don't see how anyone can escape a stormy adolescence. I think some of my anger, perhaps unconscious, comes out in my plays, in the gut language. But to me men trying to communicate speak that way. And what I use fits my meter.\" Mamet attended the prestigious Frances Parker School, but was a rebellious student. In high school he became interested in drama, working as a volunteer in a small local theater. He also worked as a busboy for a time at Chicago's famous comedy club, Second City, and through the influence of an uncle he got a television acting job on a morning religious show. The acting bug had bit him hard, and ignoring parental advice to study law, he went to Goddard College in Vermont in 1964. His junior year he spent in New York studying acting. This experience convinced Mamet that he was more of a writer than an actor. Graduating from Goddard in 1969, he bluffed his way into a teaching job in the drama department of Marlboro College by claiming he had written a play. When he was given the job, Mamet had to hurriedly write a play for production at the college. Thus his play Lakeport was born.\n\nMamet lived the peripatetic life of an itinerant artist-teacher for several years, moving back to Chicago in 1970, where he took various odd jobs, including working in a boiler room, and then back to Goddard College where he taught as artist-in-residence for two years. Returning to Chicago in 1972 he staged Duck Variations at a local experimental theater. In 1974 he and several friends breathed new life into the old St. Nicholas Theater, and it was here that his one-act satire about the single's scene, Sexual Perversity in Chicago, premiered. Soon it made its way to the New York theater world as well. Sexual Perversity in Chicago portrays the failed love affair between a young man and woman, each trying to leave behind a relationship with a homosexual roommate. The dialogue between the lovers and their same-sex roommates reveals how each gender can brutally characterize the other. Yet, \"the play itself is not another aspect of the so-called battle of the sexes,\" observed C. Gerald Fraser in the New York Times. \"It concerns the confusion and emptiness of human relationships on a purely physical level.\" New Yorker reviewer Edith Oliver maintained that \"the piece is written with grace,\" and found it \"one of the saddest comedies I can remember.\" In Duck Variations, two old Jewish men sit on a bench in Chicago looking out on Lake Michigan. Their observation of the nearby ducks leads them into discussions of several topics. \"There is a marvelous ring of truth in the meandering, speculative talk of these old men,\" maintained Oliver, \"the comic, obsessive talk of men who spend most of their time alone, nurturing and indulging their preposterous notions.\" In the conversation of these men, wrote T. E. Kalem in Time, \"[Mamet] displays the Pinter trait of wearing word masks to shield feelings and of defying communication in the act of communicating.\" Duck Variations reveals, according to Oliver, that Mamet is an \"original writer, who cherishes words and, on the evidence at hand, cherishes character even more.\" \"What emerges is a vivid sense of [the old men's] friendship, the fear of solitude, the inexorable toll of expiring lives,\" concluded Kalem.\n\nA National Playwright\n\nMamet scored his first success with these two short plays, but emerged as a nationally acclaimed playwright with his 1975 two-act, American Buffalo. \"America has few comedies in its repertory as ironic or as audacious as American Buffalo,\" proclaimed John Lahr in the Nation. Set in a junk shop, the play features the shop's owner, an employee, and a friend engaged in plotting a theft; they hope to steal the coin collection of a customer who, earlier in the week, had bought an old nickel at the shop. When the employee fails to tail the mark to his home, the plot falls into disarray and \"the play ends in confused weariness,\" explained Elizabeth Kastor in the Washington Post. Although little takes place, Oliver commented in the New Yorker, \"what makes [the play] fascinating are its characters and the sudden spurts of feeling and shifts of mood—the mounting tension under the seemingly aimless surface, which gives the play its momentum.\"\n\nAmerican Buffalo confirmed Mamet's standing as a language playwright. Reviewing the play in the Nation, Lahr observed, \"Mamet's use of the sludge in American language is completely original. He hears panic and poetry in the convoluted syntax of his beleaguered characters.\" And, even though the language is uncultivated, David Richards contended in the Washington Post, \"the dialogue [is] ripe with unsettling resonance.\" As Frank Rich of the New York Times remarked, \"Working with the tiniest imaginable vocabulary . . . Mamet creates a subterranean world with its own nonliterate comic beat, life-and-death struggles, pathos and even affection.\"\n\nIn this play, critics also see Mamet's vision of America, \"a restless, rootless, insecure society which has no faith in the peace it seeks or the pleasure it finds,\" interpreted Lahr. \"American Buffalo superbly evokes this anxious and impoverished world.\" Its characters, though seemingly insignificant, reflect the inhabitants of this world and their way of life. \"In these bumbling and inarticulate meatheads,\" believed Lahr, \"Mamet has found a metaphor for the spiritual failure of entrepreneurial capitalism.\"\n\nSince its first Chicago production in 1975, American Buffalo has been produced in several regional theaters and has had three New York productions. In Mamet's management of the elements of this play, New York Times reviewer Benedict Nightingale highlighted the key to its success: \"Its idiom is precise enough to evoke a city, a class, a subculture; it is imprecise enough to allow variation of mood and feeling from production to production.\" Nightingale added in another article, \"Buffalo is as accomplished as anything written for the American stage over . . . the last 20 years.\"\n\nMamet turned to the theater itself for the inspiration for his 1976 A Life in the Theater, a play about play-making. Speaking with Jaques le Sourd of the White Plains Reporter Dispatch, Mamet explained thatA Life in the Theater \"is a play about actors. Everybody in this country loves the idea of the theater, but everyone is ambivalent about actors and treats them with, at best, a bemuse tolerance. Yet when you stop to and think about it, actors are the only essential element of the theater.\" Other plays from Mamet's early period include The Water Engine, about an urban inventor, and Reunion, about a father and daughter who have not seen each other in twenty years. It was during production of Reunion that Mamet met his first wife, Lindsay Crouse; they married in 1977.\n\nTinsel Town\n\nIn 1979 Mamet worked for the screen for the first time, adapting his play, Sexual Perversity in Chicago for the feature film, About Last Night. Thereafter he was given another opportunity to write a screenplay for hire. As he told Don Shewey in the New York Times, working on the screenplay for the 1981 film version of James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice was a learning experience. \"[Director Bob Rafelson] taught me that the purpose of a screenplay is to tell the story so the audience wants to know what happens next,\" Mamet maintained, \"and to tell it in pictures.\" He elaborated, \"I always thought I had a talent for dialogue and not for plot, but it's a skill that can be learned. Writing for the movies is teaching me not to be so scared about plots.\" Mamet's screenplay for The Postman Always Rings Twice received mixed reviews. Its critics often point, as Gene Siskel did in the Chicago Tribune, to Mamet's \"ill-conceived editing of the book's original ending.\" Yet, except for the ending, suggested Vincent Canby in the New York Times, \"Mr. Mamet's screenplay is far more faithful to the novel than was the screenplay for Tay Garnett's 1946 version.\" Thus, Robert Hatch noted in the Nation, \"Mamet and Rafelson recapture the prevailing insanity of the Depression, when steadiness of gaze was paying no bills and double or nothing was the game in vogue.\"\n\nIn the 1982 film The Verdict, screenwriter Mamet and director Sydney Lumet \"have dealt powerfully and unsentimentally with the shadowy state that ideas like good and evil find themselves in today,\" observed Jack Kroll in Newsweek. The film stars Paul Newman as a washed-up lawyer caught in a personal, legal, and moral battle. \"David Mamet's terse screenplay for The Verdict is . . . full of surprises,\" contended Janet Maslin in the New York Times; \"Mamet has supplied twists and obstacles of all sorts.\" \"Except for a few lapses of logic and some melodramatic moments in the courtroom,\" proclaimed a People reviewer, \"[this] script from Barry Reed's novel is unusually incisive.\" Kroll detailed the screenplay's strong points, calling it \"strong on character, on sharp and edgy dialogue, on the detective-story suspense of a potent narrative.\" In a New Republic article, Stanley Kauffmann concluded, \"It comes through when it absolutely must deliver: Newman's summation to the jury. This speech is terse and pungent: the powerful have the power to convert all the rest of us into victims and that condition probably cannot be changed, but must it always prevail?\"\n\nReturns to the Theater\n\nAfter writing The Verdict Mamet returned to live theater with Edmond, a play about \"the American Dream gone bad,\" as the author related to Mimi Leahey in Other Stages. He expanded on similar themes as he began working on his next play, Glengarry Glen Ross. Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play is \"so precise in its realism that it transcends itself,\" observed Robert Brustein in the New Republic, \"and takes on reverberant ethical meanings. It is biting, . . . showing life stripped of all idealistic pretenses and liberal pieties.\" The play is set in and around a Chicago real estate office whose agents are embroiled in a competition to sell the most parcels in the Florida developments Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms. \"Craftily constructed, so that there is laughter, as well as rage, in its dialogue, the play has a payoff in each scene and a cleverly plotted mystery that kicks in with a surprise hook at its ending,\" wrote Richard Christiansen in the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAs in Mamet's earlier plays, the characters and their language are very important to Glengarry Glen Ross. In the Nation, Stephen Harvey commented on Mamet's ability to create characters who take on a life of their own within the framework of the play: In Glengarry, \"he adjusts his angle of vision to suit the contours of his characters, rather than using them to illustrate an idea.\" Mamet told Kastor of the Washington Post, \"I think that people are generally more happy with a mystery than with an explanation. So the less that you say about a character the more interesting he becomes.\" Mamet uses language in a similar manner. Harvey noted, \"The pungency of Glengarry's language comes from economy: if these characters have fifty-word vocabularies, Mamet makes sure that every monosyllable counts.\" And as Kroll remarked, \"His antiphonal exchanges, which dwindle to single words or even fragments of words and then explode into a crossfire of scatological buckshot, make him the Aristophanes of the inarticulate.\" Mamet is, according to New York Times reviewer Benedict Nightingale, \"the bard of modern-day barbarism, the laureate of the four-letter word.\"\n\nFor the real estate agents in Glengarry Glen Ross, the bottom line is sales. And, as Robert Brustein noted, \"Without a single tendentious line, without any polemical intention, without a trace of pity or sentiment, Mamet has launched an assault on the American way of making a living.\" Nightingale called the play \"as scathing a study of unscrupulous dealing as the American theater has ever produced.\" The Pulitzer Prize awarded to Mamet for Glengarry Glen Ross not only helped increase its critical standing, but it also helped to make the play a commercial success. However, unlike his real estate agents, Mamet is driven by more than money. He told Kastor, \"In our interaction in our daily lives we tell stories to each other, we gossip, we complain to each other, we exhort. These are means of defining what our life is. The theater is a way of doing it continually, of sharing that experience, and it's absolutely essential.\"\n\nMamet followed this success up with Speed-the-Plow, which was produced on Broadway in 1988, starring pop-star Madonna in a drama that targets Hollywood for its satire. Reviewing the production at New York's Royale Theatre in 1988, Leo Sauvage noted in the New Leader that the \"play does give us a sardonic and entirely appropriate view of the process by which films are conceived.\" However Sauvage went on to complain that the play \"ends up a lifeless essay.\" The story of a movie producer and his friend, a would-be producer, and the temp secretary who momentarily turns their world upside down, Speed-the-Plow was described as a \"foul-mouthed and ferociously funny slice of Hollywood life\" by Time's William A. Henry III. Henry went on to note that it was difficult to tell if Mamet's new play was \"an outcry against Hollywood, or a cynical apologia from a man who, in real life, is finishing one Hollywood film, and about to start another.\"\n\nWriter Turns Director\n\nThat Hollywood film referred to in Henry's review was Mamet's directorial debut, House of Games, starring his wife, Lindsay Crouse, as a psychoanalyst who has just published a book on compulsions. Helping one of her compulsive clients, a gambler, she is drawn into the world of gambling herself by this patient who proves to be a consummate con man. The psychoanalyst discovers that she, too, is a compulsive. Reviewing this movie in New Republic, Stanley Kauffmann commented that \"deceit is a key theme in David Mamet's work—deceit with a unique candid flavor.\" Kauffmann noted that Mamet used the same theme in this \"extraordinary piece of work.\" Ben Pappas, writing in Forbes, called the video reproduction of that film a \"cinematic Chinese box that stacks con upon con.\"\n\nMamet continued his string of Hollywood successes with the screenplay adaptation for The Untouchables in 1987, and for Things Change in 1988, dealing with a mob scam. Mamet also directed this title. The 1991 Homicide was another dual credit for Mamet, who both wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Employing what was slowly becoming a Mamet company of actors such as Joe Mantegna and William Macy, Mamet tells the story of a Jewish and Irish police detective \"trying to cope with each nightmare day,\" as Mark Goodman noted in People. Writing in Time, Richard Corliss found the film a \"dandy morality play.\" Further adventures in motion pictures in the mid-1990s included the screenplay for Hoffa and for the adaptation of his own play, Glengarry Glen Ross. In 1991 Mamet, divorced from his first wife, married for a second time, to actress Rebecca Pidgeon.\n\nMamet's lives in the theater and in film began to merge with Oleanna, produced as a play in 1993 and as a movie in 1994. Political correctness is at the center of this story of a sociology professor who is accused of sexual harassment by one of his female students. What ensues is an escalating game/feud between accused and accuser. Commonweal's Gerald Weales found the play a \"fascinating disquisition on power,\" while Time's Henry applauded the strength of writing and staging that had him \"virtually leaping out of his chair in fury at the injustice and unreason.\" Henry concluded that whatever imperfections the play had, it also had \"the power to incense,\" and, \"like [the power] to sadden or amuse, [it] is reason enough to cheer for the future of the theater.\"\n\nReturning to the theater for the 1994 production The Cryptogram, Mamet \"dramatizes a child's emotional abuse in a way that no other American play has ever attempted: from the child's point of view,\" according to New Yorker critic John Lahr. The playwright draws on his personal experiences of violent outbreaks, mistrust, and betrayal that he encountered in his own family, but the play blurs such autobiographical elements between its author 's fictions. Taking place in Chicago over the span of a single month during the late 1950s, the play's main character, ten-year-old John, is trying to make sense of the double message dispensed by his parents and family friends: lies and unkept promises are commonplace, yet he is expected to trust those who deceive him. \"People may or may not say what they mean,\" Mamet explained to Lahr, \"but they always say something designed to get what they want.\" Characteristically, language plays an important role in The Cryptogram: as its author noted, \"The language of love is . . . fairly limited. 'You're beautiful,' 'I need you,' 'I love you,' 'I want you.' Love expresses itself, so it doesn't need a lot of words. On the other hand, aggression has an unlimited vocabulary.\"\n\nWhile Mamet's own directorship of The Cryptogram received the traditional mixed reviews from critics due to his fractured language, New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby found much to praise. Calling the play \"a horror story that also appears to be one of Mr. Mamet's most personal plays,\" Canby noted that \"It's not about the sort of physical abuse we see in television docudramas, but about the high cost of the emotional games played in what are otherwise considered to be fairly well-adjusted families.\" The Cryptogram received the Obie Award from the Village Voice for best play in 1995.\n\nRenaissance Man\n\nHaving found success in both play writing and screen writing, Mamet next ventured into the world of books. He initially wrote children's picture books with his first wife in the 1980s. From there he branched out into nonfiction with several collections of essays, including Writing in Restaurants, Some Freaks, On Directing Film, The Cabin, and Make-Believe Town, the first four volumes later collected as A Whore's Profession: Notes and Essays. These revealing collections are packed with Mamet's fascinating thoughts, opinions, recollections, musings, and reports on a variety of topics such as friendship, religion, politics, morals, society, and of course, the American theater. \"The 30 pieces collected in David Mamet's first book of essays contain everything from random thoughts to firmly held convictions,\" stated Richard Christiansen in his review of Writing in Restaurants for Chicago's Tribune Books,\"but they all exhibit the author's singular insights and moral bearing.\"Christiansen pointed out that\"many of the essays have to do with drama, naturally, but whether he is talking to a group of critics or to fellow workers in the theater, Mamet is always urging his audience to go beyond craft and into a proud, dignified, loving commitment to their art and to the people with whom they work.\"\n\nWriting for the Times Literary Supplement, Andrew Hislop declared that \"Mamet has been rightly acclaimed as a great dialoguist and a dramatist who most effectively expresses the rhythms of modern urban American (though the poetic rather than mimetic qualities of his dialogue are often underestimated). The best writing in [Writing in Restaurants] comes when he muses on the details of America—and his own life.\" Hislop continued, \"Running through the book is the idea that the purpose of theatre is truth but that the decadence of American society, television and the materialism of Broadway are undermining not just the economic basis but the disciplines and dedication necessary for true theatre.\"\n\nThe Cabin, published in 1992, contains twenty essays that reflect their author's macho concerns—guns, cigars, beautiful women—as well as his life as a writer. The work's structure was characterized by Los Angeles Times Book Review critic Charles Solomon as \"a succession of scenes illuminated by an erratic strobe light: A single moment appears in harsh focus, then vanishes.\" We follow the author from his tumultuous childhood in 'The Rake' to a description of his New Hampshire haven where he does his writing in the title essay. The two dozen essays in Make-Believe Town recall Mamet's love of the theater and his respect for his Jewish heritage and introduce those \"appalled\" by the language of his stage plays to \"Mamet the thoughtful learner, teacher, the friend, the literary critic, the hungernature writer, the culture, press and film critic, the political commentator, the moralist and, most delightfully, the memoirist,\"according to Tribune Books critic John D. Callaway.\n\nMamet turns thespian teacher in his 1997 True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor, a book, according to Booklist's Jack Helbig, that is \"suffused with warmth and heartfelt concern for the actor and is thereby far more nurturing than a hundred acting studios and feel-good seminars.\" A Publishers Weekly critic similarly observed that this \"controversial book will anger many in the profession but may also inspire because of its brashness and daring.\" In Jafsie and John Henry Mamet gathers twenty-seven essays on themes from aging to remembrances of his Chicago boyhood. \"Mamet's collection offers the spectacle of a fierce intelligence at work and at play in the world,\" commented a critic for Publishers Weekly. Likewise, Donna Seaman, writing in Booklist, felt that \"Mamet achieves exhilarating clarity, elegance, and forcefulness of expression in his newest essay collection.\" In South of the Northeast Kingdom, Mamet's 2002 \"stimulating collection of essays,\" as Keir Graff described the work in Booklist, Mamet explores the ins and outs of the state where he has lived part of the year since college. He includes stories about neighbors and about the larger world, including the events of September 11, 2001, all told in a \"digressive style that recalls languid conversations by an embering stove,\" as Graff further commented. A critic for Kirkus Reviews called the same book a \"sidelong, inferential portrait of Mamet's Vermont hometown, with a spirited indictment of American political perfidy and cultural poverty.\" Mamet deals with religious topics in his 2003 nonfiction title, Five Cities of Refuge, written with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, illuminating aspects of the Torah. A reviewer for Publishers Weekly found this book both \"insightful and inspiring.\"\n\nIn 1994, Mamet published his first novel, The Village. Taking place in a small, once-thriving town in New England, the novel reveals the emotional complexity of the lives of its characters. From Dick, the hardware-store owner fighting to stay in business, Manis, a local prostitute, and especially Henry, an \"outsider\" retired and escaping a failed marriage who wants to recapture the macho lifestyle of a century ago, Mamet captures \"the flat, dark underside of the flapjack of small town life that Thorton Wilder's 'Our Town' served as the fluffy, arcing top to,\" according to Tribune Books reviewer Ross Field. While reviewers noted that the novel's characters and central idea are well conceived, the novel's dialogue caused some critics to water down their enthusiasm for the book. James McManus contended in the New York Times Book Review that, \"because of the novel's design and mechanical problems, the potency of [some] scenes tends not to accumulate. For a playwright of such muscular succinctness, Mr. Mamet has a narrative prose that turns out to be weirdly precious.\" However, in his review for the Washington Post Book World, Douglas Glover praised The Village. \"Mamet's novel explores a community with its own laws, language, codes, habits and sense of honor,\" noted Glover. \"It does so with a deft reverence for the real—Mamet's eye for detail and his ear for the rhythms of vernacular speech are incomparable—coupled with a certain difficulty of approach, an avant-garde edge.\"\n\nFurther novels have followed, including The Old Religion, Bar Mitzvah, The Chinaman, Henrietta, and the 2002 title Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources. In The Old Religion Mamet presents a fictionalized account of the life and death of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory owner in the South in 1914 who was, though innocent, accused and tried of the rape and murder of a white girl and later hanged by a mob. Booklist's Margaret Flanagan called this a \"riveting novel utterly dependent on one man's inner dialogue with himself.\" With Wilson, Mamet presents an \"imitation of a scholarly work—or at least the sort of scholarly work that might be undertaken in the 24th century,\" noted a reviewer for Publishers Weekly. In his novel, Mamet posits a post-apocalyptic world. In this case, however it was not the bomb that devastated the Earth, but an Internet crash in 2021 that destroyed and/or garbled what history was left. Thus Lincoln composed his Gettysburg Address while riding an elephant; Kennedy committed suicide. Since the crash, scholars have only been able to dig up bits and pieces of the real history, trying to piece together a civilization from scraps of girlie magazines or children's books. For the Publishers Weekly contributor, Wilson was \"less a novel than an extended joke—albeit a curiously compelling one.\" Other reviewers were less flattering. Book's Tom LeClair, for example, noted that \"in this fiction, names abound but characters don't exist. No plot or conceptual continuity fills the lacuna of character.\"\n\nPopcorn\n\nQueried by a contributor for Newsweek International about the difference between theater and film, Mamet answered, \"Popcorn.\" That, and the ability to earn a real living. Much of his work through the 1990s and into the twenty-first century has been focused on film, both writing and directing. His 1997 movie, The Spanish Prisoner, deals with another con or scam, just as did his directorial debut, House of Games. Casting his own wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, against Steve Martin, Mamet tells his \"finest shell game,\" as Time's Richard Corliss observed. In this flim-flam, a group of businessmen are dangled the prize of being able to purchase a top-secret mathematical formula known as The Process. Corliss praised the film as a \"diamond-hard, ice-cold thriller.\" A reviewer for Entertainment Weekly called the same film a \"fine, bitter, intellectual heist,\" and the Nation's Stuart Klawans found the movie \"teasing, ingenious, [and] grandly entertaining.\" A political scam is at the heart of the 1997 Wag the Dog, with a script by Mamet, in which a war is staged to turn an election. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman felt that the script \"doesn't just aim its darts at the moral bankruptcy of modern media snake-oil salesmen. It aims them at a populace all too eager to lap up their lies.\" Gleiberman further called the film a \"savagely funny media satire.\" Another criminal scam forms the story of The Heist, written and directed by Mamet in 2001. Variety's David Rooney described this film as a \"playful ensemble piece about a crack robbery team going for a major gold haul.\" Time's Richard Schickel found the same film to be a \"well-tooled machine chugging coldly along a twisting road to nowhere,\" but Maclean's contributor Brian D. Johnson was more entertained, dubbing the film \"great fun,\" and akin to \"playing speed chess.\"\n\nMamet turned to comedy with State and Main, in which a movie crew invades a sleepy Vermont town. Time's Richard Corliss called this a \"tasty inside dish.\" The multi-talented writer has also attempted the thriller format in his 2004 feature film, Spartan, starring Val Kilmer playing a secret agent who is a professional killing machine. Kilmer has very little time to find the president's daughter, gone missing, and he does not go about his work gently. Writing in the Nation, Klawans observed that \"however enjoyable Mamet's films may be—the best of them, including the new Spartan, are thoroughly entertaining—they never risk his emotions, or the viewers, as the plays do.\"\n\nAnd the unfailingly productive Mamet meanwhile created further theatrical inventions for his fans, at the same time he was writing and directing movies and publishing numerous books. In 1998 he brought together three one-act plays for The Old Neighborhood. His 2002 production, Boston Marriage, was an abrupt departure for the rough-talking, cigar-smoking Mamet, more of a drawing room play of manners with a cast of women who speak in rather refined—some critics even called it stilted—tones. Variety's Matt Wolf thought the play was a \"painful blind alley\" for Mamet, with dialogue and movement affected by \"overriding archness.\" Julius Novick, writing in Back Stage, found more to like in the work, however, calling it an \"amusing play about two elegant ladies in a drawing room.\" The two have a so-called \"Boston Marriage,\" or homosexual relationship, but one of them has fallen for a younger woman. Novick further praised the \"exaggerated formality of . . . [the] language\" as \"frequently quite funny.\" In 2004, Mamet also mounted a production of his reworking of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus.\n\nIf you enjoy the works of David Mamet\n\nIf you enjoy the works of David Mamet, you may also want to check out the following:\n\nNetwork, an Academy Award-winning film, 1976.\n\nThe Grifters, a film starring John Cusack, 1990.\n\nBoiler Room, a film starring Ben Affleck, 2000.\n\n\"Mamet continues to surprise,\" commented Riley in Back Stage West. \"Most Pulitzer Prize winners...make you think of a button-down intellectual.\" But Mamet is anything but button-down. With one foot in Hollywood and another in New York, he has forged a career in film, theater, and book publishing large enough for three creators. \"In his work,\" Riley concluded, \"Mamet continues to vex, to confound, and the audience who goes along for the ride is all the better for it.\" Speaking with Andy Culpepper on CNN Online, Mamet gave his own interpretation of his work: \"If someone wanted to sum up my career, they would put on my tombstone, 'His mind was racing, and he wrote it down.'\"\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nBOOKS\n\nBigsby, Christopher W., David Mamet, Metheun (New York, NY), 1985.\n\nBigsby, Christopher W., editor, The Cambridge Companion to David Mamet, Cambridge University Press (New York, NY), 2004.\n\nBock, Hedwig, and Albert Wertheim, editors, Essays on Contemporary American Drama, Max Hueber (Munich, Germany), 1981.\n\nBrewer, Gay, David Mamet and Film: Illusion/Disillusion in a Wounded Land, McFarland (Jefferson, NC), 1993.\n\nCarroll, Dennis, David Mamet, St. Martin's Press (New York, NY), 1987.\n\nContemporary Authors Bibliographical Series, Volume 3, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1986.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 9, 1978; Volume 15, 1980; Volume 34, 1985; Volume 46, 1988; Volume 91, 1996.\n\nDean, Anne, David Mamet: Language as Dramatic Action, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press (Madison, NJ), 1990.\n\nDrama Criticism, Volume 4, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1994.\n\nKane, Leslie, editor, David Mamet: A Casebook, Garland (New York, NY), 1991.\n\nKane, Leslie, David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross:Text and Performance, Garland (New York, NY), 1996.\n\nKane, Leslie, Weasels and Wisemen: Education, Ethics, and Ethnicity in David Mamet, St. Martin's Press (New York, NY), 1999.\n\nKing, Kimball, Ten Modern American Playwrights, Garland (New York, NY), 1982.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerica, September 23, 1995, Ronald C.

Law, NBC. Contributing editor, Oui, 1975–76. Contributed to Donald Sultan: in the Still-Life Tradition, with Steven Henry Madoff, 1999.\n\nADAPTATIONS: The film About Last Night…, released by Tri-Star Pictures in 1986, was based on Mamet's Sexual Perversity in Chicago.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: David Mamet has acquired a great deal of critical recognition for his plays, each one a micro-cosmic view of the American experience. \"He's that rarity, a pure writer,\" noted Jack Kroll in Newsweek, \"and the synthesis he appears to be making, with echoes from voices as diverse as Beckett, Pinter, and Hemingway, is unique and exciting.\" Since 1976, Mamet's plays have been widely produced in regional theaters and in New York City. One of Mamet's most successful plays, Glengarry Glen Ross, earned the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for best American play and the Pulitzer Prize in drama, both in 1984. Critics have also praised Mamet's screenwriting; he received Academy Award nominations for best adapted screenplay for The Verdict in 1983, and for Wag the Dog in 1997.\n\nMamet \"has carved out a career as one of America's most creative … playwrights,\" observed Mel Gussow in New York Times, \"with a particular affinity for working-class characters.\" These characters and their language give Mamet's work its distinct flavor. Mamet is, according to Kroll, \"that rare bird, an American playwright who's a language playwright.\" \"Playwriting is simply showing how words influence actions and vice versa,\" Mamet explained to People contributor Linda Witt. \"All my plays attempt to bring out the poetry in the plain, everyday language people use. That's the only way to put art back into the theater.\" Mamet has been accused of eavesdropping, simply recording the insignificant conversations of which everyone is aware; yet, many reviewers recognize the playwright's artistic intent. Jean M. White commented in Washington Post that \"Mamet has an ear for vernacular speech and uses cliche with telling effect.\" Furthermore, added Kroll, \"Mamet is the first playwright to create a formal and moral shape out of the undeleted expletives of our foulmouthed time.\"\n\nIn his personal and creative life, Mamet has resisted the lure of Broadway, its establishment, and its formulas for success. He was born and raised in Chicago—his father was a labor lawyer. His parents divorced while Mamet and his sisters were young. The Windy City serves not only as inspiration for much of his work, but it has also provided an accepting audience for Mamet's brand of drama, especially in the early days of his career, when he worked nights as a busboy at The Second City and spent his days with the theater crowd and writing his plays. \"Regional theaters are where the life is,\" he told Robin Reeves in Us. \"They're the only new force in American theater since the 30s.\" Yet, despite Mamet's seeming indifference to Broadway and the fact that the language and subject matter of his plays make them of questionable commercial value, several of his plays have been featured on Broadway.\n\nThe first of Mamet's plays to be commercially produced were Sexual Perversity in Chicago and Duck Variations. Sexual Perversity portrays the failed love affair between a young man and woman, each trying to leave behind a relationship with a homosexual roommate. The dialogue between the lovers and their same-sex roommates reveals how each gender can brutally characterize the other. Yet, \"the play itself is not another aspect of the so-called battle of the sexes,\" observed C. Gerald Fraser in New York Times. \"It concerns the confusion and emptiness of human relationships on a purely physical level.\" New Yorker reviewer Edith Oliver maintained that \"the piece is written with grace,\" and found it \"one of the saddest comedies I can remember.\" In Duck Variations, two old Jewish men sit on a bench in Chicago looking at Lake Michigan. Their observation of the nearby ducks leads them into discussions of several topics. \"There is a marvelous ring of truth in the meandering, speculative talk of these old men,\" maintained Oliver, \"the comic, obsessive talk of men who spend most of their time alone, nurturing and indulging their preposterous notions.\" In the conversation of these men, wrote T.E. Kalem in Time, Mamet \"displays the Pinter trait of wearing word masks to shield feelings and of defying communication in the act of communicating.\" Duck Variations reveals, according to Oliver, that Mamet is an \"original writer, who cherishes words and, on the evidence at hand, cherishes character even more.\" \"What emerges is a vivid sense of [the old men's] friendship, the fear of solitude, the inexorable toll of expiring lives,\" concluded Kalem.\n\nMamet emerged as a nationally acclaimed playwright with his 1975 two-act American Buffalo. \"America has few comedies in its repertory as ironic or as audacious as American Buffalo,\" proclaimed John Lahr in Nation. Set in a junk shop, the play features the shop's owner, an employee, and a friend engaged in plotting a theft; they hope to steal the coin collection of a customer who, earlier in the week, had bought an old nickel at the shop. When the employee fails to tail the mark to his home, the plot falls into disarray and \"the play ends in confused weariness,\" explained Elizabeth Kastor in Washington Post. Although little takes place, Oliver commented in New Yorker, \"What makes [the play] fascinating are its characters and the sudden spurts of feeling and shifts of mood—the mounting tension under the seemingly aimless surface, which gives the play its momentum.\"\n\nAmerican Buffalo confirmed Mamet's standing as a language playwright. Reviewing the play in Nation, Lahr observed, \"Mamet's use of the sludge in American language is completely original. He hears panic and poetry in the convoluted syntax of his beleaguered characters.\" And, even though the language is uncultivated, David Richards contended in Washington Post that \"the dialogue [is] ripe with unsettling resonance.\" As Frank Rich of New York Times remarked, \"Working with the tiniest imaginable vocabulary … Mamet creates a subterranean world with its own nonliterate comic beat, life-and-death struggles, pathos and even affection.\"\n\nIn this play, critics also see Mamet's vision of America, \"a restless, rootless, insecure society which has no faith in the peace it seeks or the pleasure it finds,\" interpreted Lahr. \"American Buffalo superbly evokes this anxious and impoverished world.\" Its characters, though seemingly insignificant, reflect the inhabitants of this world and their way of life. \"In these bumbling and inarticulate meatheads,\" believed Lahr, \"Mamet has found a metaphor for the spiritual failure of entrepreneurial capitalism.\"\n\nSince its first Chicago production in 1975, American Buffalo has been produced in several regional theaters and has had three New York productions. In Mamet's management of the elements of this play, New York Times reviewer Benedict Nightingale highlighted the key to its success: \"Its idiom is precise enough to evoke a city, a class, a subculture; it is imprecise enough to allow variation of mood and feeling from production to production.\" Nightingale added in another article, \"Buffalo is as accomplished as anything written for the American stage over … the last 20 years.\"\n\nIn 1979 Mamet was given his first opportunity to write a screenplay. As he told Don Shewey in New York Times, working on the screenplay for the 1981 film version of James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice was a learning experience. Director Bob Rafelson \"taught me that the purpose of a screenplay is to tell the story so the audience wants to know what happens next,\" Mamet maintained, \"and to tell it in pictures.\" He elaborated, \"I always thought I had a talent for dialogue and not for plot, but it's a skill that can be learned. Writing for the movies is teaching me not to be so scared about plots.\" Mamet's screenplay for The Postman Always Rings Twice has received mixed reviews. Its critics often point, as Gene Siskel did in Chicago Tribune, to Mamet's \"ill-conceived editing of the book's original ending.\" Yet, except for the ending, suggested Vincent Canby in New York Times, \"Mr. Mamet's screenplay is far more faithful to the novel than was the screenplay for Tay Garnett's 1946 version.\" Thus, Robert Hatch noted in Nation, \"Mamet and Rafelson recapture the prevailing insanity of the Depression, when steadiness of gaze was paying no bills and double or nothing was the game in vogue.\"\n\nIn the 1982 film The Verdict, screenwriter Mamet and director Sydney Lumet \"have dealt powerfully and un-sentimentally with the shadowy state that ideas like good and evil find themselves in today,\" observed Jack Kroll in Newsweek. The film stars Paul Newman as a washed-up lawyer caught in a personal, legal, and moral battle. \"Mamet's terse screenplay for The Verdict is … full of surprises,\" contended Janet Maslin in New York Times, \"Mamet has supplied twists and obstacles of all sorts.\" \"Except for a few lapses of logic and some melodramatic moments in the courtroom,\" proclaimed a People reviewer, \"[this] script from Barry Reed's novel is unusually incisive.\" Kroll detailed the screenplay's strong points, calling it \"strong on character, on sharp and edgy dialogue, on the detective-story suspense of a potent narrative.\" In a New Republic article, Stanley Kauffmann concluded, \"It comes through when it absolutely must deliver: Newman's summation to the jury. This speech is terse and pungent: the powerful have the power to convert all the rest of us into victims and that condition probably cannot be changed, but must it always prevail?\"\n\nAfter writing The Verdict Mamet began working on his next play, Glengarry Glen Ross. Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play is \"so precise in its realism that it transcends itself,\" observed Robert Brustein in New Republic, \"and takes on reverberant ethical meanings. It is biting,… showing life stripped of all idealistic pretenses and liberal pieties.\" The play is set in and around a Chicago real estate office whose agents are embroiled in a competition to sell the most parcels in the Florida developments Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms. \"Craftily constructed, so that there is laughter, as well as rage, in its dialogue, the play has a payoff in each scene and a cleverly plotted mystery that kicks in with a surprise hook at its ending,\" wrote Richard Christiansen in Chicago Tribune.\n\nAs in Mamet's earlier plays, the characters and their language are very important to Glengarry Glen Ross. In Nation, Stephen Harvey commented on Mamet's ability to create characters who take on a life of their own within the framework of the play: In Glengarry, \"he adjusts his angle of vision to suit the contours of his characters, rather than using them to illustrate an idea.\" Mamet told Kastor of Washington Post, \"I think that people are generally more happy with a mystery than with an explanation. So the less that you say about a character the more interesting he becomes.\" Mamet uses language in a similar manner. Harvey noted, \"The pungency of Glengarry's language comes from economy: if these characters have fifty-word vocabularies, Mamet makes sure that every monosyllable counts.\" And as Kroll remarked, \"His antiphonal exchanges, which dwindle to single words or even fragments of words and then explode into a crossfire of scatological buckshot, make him the Aristophanes of the inarticulate.\" Mamet is, according to New York Times reviewer Benedict Nightingale, \"the bard of modern-day barbarism, the laureate of the four-letter word.\" In New York Times Magazine, Richard Eder remarked, \"From the beginning, Mr. Mamet's most notable and noticeable quality was his extraordinary use of speech. He concentrated not upon cultivated expression but upon that apparent wasteland of middle American speech. It was the language of the secretary, the salesman, the file clerk, the telephone lineman, the small-time crook, the semiliterate college kid. It was grotesquely realistic.\"\n\nFor the real estate agents in Glengarry Glen Ross, the bottom line is sales. And, as Robert Brustein noted, \"Without a single tendentious line, without any polemical intention, without a trace of pity or sentiment, Ma-met has launched an assault on the American way of making a living.\" Nightingale called the play \"as scathing a study of unscrupulous dealing as the American theater has ever produced.\" The Pulitzer Prize awarded to Mamet for Glengarry Glen Ross not only helped increase its critical standing, but it also helped to make the play a commercial success. However, unlike his real estate agents, Mamet is driven by more than money. He told Kastor, \"In our interaction in our daily lives we tell stories to each other, we gossip, we complain to each other, we exhort. These are means of defining what our life is. The theater is a way of doing it continually, of sharing that experience, and it's absolutely essential.\"\n\nThe Cryptogram, Mamet's 1994 play, \"dramatizes a child's emotional abuse in a way that no other American play has ever attempted: from the child's point of view,\" according to New Yorker critic John Lahr. The playwright draws on his personal experiences of violent outbreaks, mistrust, and betrayal that he encountered in his own family, but the play blurs such autobiographical elements between its author's fictions. Taking place in Chicago over the span of a single month during the late 1950s, the play's main character, ten-year-old John, is trying to make sense of the double message dispensed by his parents and family friends: lies and unkept promises are commonplace, yet he is expected to trust those who deceive him. \"People may or may not say what they mean,\" Mamet explained to Lahr, \"but they always say something designed to get what they want.\" Characteristically, language plays an important role in The Cryptogram: as its author noted, \"The language of love is … fairly limited. 'You're beautiful,' 'I need you,' 'I love you,' 'I want you.' Love expresses itself, so it doesn't need a lot of words. On the other hand, aggression has an unlimited vocabulary.\"\n\nWhile Mamet's own directorship of The Cryptogram received the traditional mixed reviews from critics due to his fractured language, New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby found much to praise. Calling the play \"a horror story that also appears to be one of Mr. Mamet's most personal plays,\" Canby noted, \"It's not about the sort of physical abuse we see in television docudramas, but about the high cost of the emotional games played in what are otherwise considered to be fairly well-adjusted families.\" The Cryptogram received the Obie Award from Village Voice for best play in 1995.\n\nIn 1994, on the heels of The Cryptogram, Mamet published his first novel, The Village. Taking place in a small, once-thriving town in New England, the novel reveals the emotional complexity of the lives of its characters. From Dick, the hardware-store owner fighting to stay in business, Manis, a local prostitute, and especially Henry, an \"outsider\" retired and escaping a failed marriage who wants to recapture the macho lifestyle of a century ago, Mamet captures \"the flat, dark underside of the flapjack of small town life that Thorton Wilder's 'Our Town' served as the fluffy, arcing top to,\" according to Tribune Books reviewer Ross Field. While reviewers noted that the novel's characters and central idea are well conceived, the novel's dialogue caused some critics to water down their enthusiasm for the book. James McManus contended in New York Times Book Review that \"because of the novel's design and mechanical problems, the potency of [some] scenes tends not to accumulate. For a playwright of such muscular succinctness, Mr. Mamet has a narrative prose that turns out to be weirdly precious.\" However, in his review for Washington Post Book World, Douglas Glover praised The Village. \"Mamet's novel explores a community with its own laws, language, codes, habits and sense of honor,\" noted Glover. \"It does so with a deft reverence for the real—Mamet's eye for detail and his ear for the rhythms of vernacular speech are incomparable—coupled with a certain difficulty of approach, an avant-garde edge.\"\n\nIn addition to plays and screenplays, Mamet has published several collections of essays, including Writing in Restaurants, Some Freaks, On Directing Film, The Cabin, and Make-Believe Town, the first four volumes later collected as A Whore's Profession: Notes and Essays. These revealing collections are packed with Mamet's fascinating thoughts, opinions, recollections, musings, and reports on a variety of topics such as friendship, religion, politics, morals, society, and of course, the American theater. \"The 30 pieces collected in David Mamet's first book of essays contain everything from random thoughts to firmly held convictions,\" stated Richard Christiansen in his review of Writing in Restaurants for Chicago's Tribune Books, \"but they all exhibit the author's singular insights and moral bearing.\" Christiansen pointed out that \"many of the essays have to do with drama, naturally, but whether he is talking to a group of critics or to fellow workers in the theater, Mamet is always urging his audience to go beyond craft and into a proud, dignified, loving commitment to their art and to the people with whom they work.\"\n\nThe Cabin, published in 1992, contains twenty essays that reflect their author's macho concerns—guns, cigars, beautiful women—as well as his life as a writer. The work's structure was characterized by Los Angeles Times Book Review critic Charles Solomon as \"a succession of scenes illuminated by an erratic strobe light: A single moment appears in harsh focus, then vanishes.\" We follow the author from his tumultuous childhood in \"The Rake\" to a description of his New Hampshire haven where he does his writing in the title essay. The two dozen essays in Make-Believe Town recall Mamet's love of the theater and his respect for his Jewish heritage and introduce those \"appalled\" by the language of his stage plays to \"Mamet the thoughtful learner, teacher, the friend, the literary critic, the hunger-nature writer, the culture, press and film critic, the political commentator, the moralist and, most delightfully, the memoirist,\" according to Tribune Books critic John D. Callaway.\n\nWith his play Boston Marriage, Mamet departed from his more well-known use of tough male characters to portray an elegant pair of Victorian lesbians. In this comedy of manners, Anna has become the mistress of a wealthy married man in order to supplement her income, and Claire has fallen in love with a younger woman. When that young woman wonders how Anna has acquired her mother's heirloom necklace, both affairs are endangered, leading the two women to concoct a complicated scheme to get themselves out of trouble. As a reviewer remarked in Curtain Up, this play, rather than being a radical departure for Mamet, \"is in fact just another example of his versatility.\"\n\nIn 2001, Mamet took on two major projects. The first was a new novel, Wilson: A Consideration of Sources, which examines the impact of the Internet on society. Set far in the future, Wilson introduces a society that has placed all books and paper archives on the Internet, destroying the original sources. When the Internet crashes, the only remaining source of information is the hard drive of Mrs. Wilson's computer. Mamet's book is composed in skewed sections as disorderly as the world he creates in it, much to the dismay of some critics.\n\nFrank J. Baldaro wrote in American Theatre that Wilson is \"an incomprehensible work that spills over with names but is devoid of characters.\" Baldaro disliked the novel's structure, calling it a \"collage of faked bits and fragments\" which \"teems with incidents and anecdotes, but lacks either plot or sense—it's ultimately a literary stunt that dares to ridicule the jargon and bombast of scholarly writing, but is itself monumentally unfunny, apocalyptically cryptic and impossible to decode.\" A reviewer for Publishers Weekly, however, liked the ridicule in Mamet's work, calling it \"an imitation of a scholarly work—or at least the sort of scholarly work that might be undertaken in the 24th century,\" concluding, \"Mamet's jeu d'esprit will certainly surprise those who imagine the author of American Buffalo operates only in the backstreets idiom of his plays.\" Joseph Dewey of Review of Contemporary Fiction appreciated Mamet's take on the future in Wilson: \"Mamet targets with luscious savvy and deadpan irony the limitless pretense of academics, hungry for tenure, to suture history … to talk their way into reasonable order.\"\n\nMamet also penned the script for Hannibal, the film sequel to Silence of the Lambs. In the script, Hannibal has escaped prison and is hiding out in Florence, Italy, as a museum curator. FBI detective Clarice Starling (played in the second movie by Julianne Moore) is reassigned to his case and proceeds to track him down. While the sequel to the original thriller was anxiously awaited by audiences, some were disappointed at the movie's lack of horror, blood, and guts. \"Hannibal is more shocking, and amusing, than disturbing,\" wrote Brian D. Johnson in Maclean's. Johnson also stated that \"despite some exquisite moments, Hannibal feels overwrought.\" Todd McCarthy praised the first movie, remarking in Variety that \"the public will … exhibit a ravenous appetite for the continuing saga of one of contemporary literature and cinema's most fascinating villains.\" McCarthy admitted that the sequel was \"ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor,\" but concluded that \"Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing, and occasionally startling.\"\n\nWriting for Times Literary Supplement, Andrew Hislop declared that \"Mamet has been rightly acclaimed as a great dialogist and a dramatist who most effectively expresses the rhythms of modern urban American (though the poetic rather than mimetic qualities of his dialogue are often underestimated). The best writing in [Writing in Restaurants] comes when he muses on the details of America—and his own life.\" Hislop continued, \"Running through the book is the idea that the purpose of theatre is truth but that the decadence of American society, television and the materialism of Broadway are undermining not just the economic basis but the disciplines and dedication necessary for true theatre.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nBigsby, C.W.
