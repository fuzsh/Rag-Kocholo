        "text": "Before House of the Dragon's season 2 premiere, it felt like a lifetime went by since we were last in Westeros. Now, fans don't even know what to do with themselves. Season 2's first episode reminded audiences that no character is safe. Season 3 was announced before the premiere even aired—and now, an entirely new show is beginning production. That's right, folks: there's a third Game of Thrones show coming your way.\n\nTitled A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the second Game of Thrones spinoff is based on George R. R. Martin's short story collection, The Tales of Dunk and Egg—focusing especially on \"The Hedge Knight.\" The story another prequel, set a century before the events of Thrones. Timeline-wise, that puts it squarely between House of the Dragon and Thrones. The series just kicked off production in Belfast, Ireland, along with HBO's announcement of the new cast and an image of Peter Claffey (Vikings: Valhalla) as Ser Duncan—which you can see below.\n\nAccording to the official press release, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms with also star Finn Bennett (True Detective: Night Country) as Aerion Targaryen, Bertie Carvel (The Crown) as Baelor Targaryen, Sam Spruell (Fargo) as Maekar Targaryen, Daniel Ings (The Gentlemen) as Ser Lyonel Barotheon, Tanzyn Crawford (Tiny Beautiful Things) as Tanselle. Sarah Adina Smith (Lessons in Chemistry) and Owen Harris (Mrs. Davis) will share directing duties over the six-episode series, with House of the Dragon showrunner Ryan Condal serving as executive producer.\n\nPeter Claffey as Ser Duncan.\n\nAccording to HBO, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms follows \"a young, naïve but courageous knight, Ser Duncan the Tall, and his diminutive squire, Egg. Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends.\"\n\nLuckily, George R.R. Martin's books provide the road map—and how it all ties back to the action of Game of Thrones. Here’s everything we know so far.\n\nSpoilers ahead. You have been warned!\n\nWhat Will A Knight of the Seven KingdomsBe About?\n\nFans of Game of Thrones can look to Martin’s books as a blueprint for what to expect. Set about a century before the Game of Thrones series begins, The Tales of Dunk and Egg novellas follow the adventures of “Dunk” (the lowly knight and future Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Duncan the Tall), and his squire, “Egg” (the future king Aegon V Targaryen). As Westeros reels from the Blackfyre Rebellion, which pitted Targaryen against Targaryen in a bloody struggle for the Iron Throne, Dunk and Egg travel the sprawling landscape, competing in tournaments to earn their daily bread and often happening upon historical events.\n\nIn The Hedge Knight, the first novella in the series, Dunk and Egg are bonded for the first time at a jousting tournament gone wrong. In The Sworn Sword, Dunk and Egg get caught up in regional land conflicts between lords and peasants. In The Mystery Knight, familiar characters like Walder Frey and Beron Stark appear as Dunk and Egg unravel a conspiracy to kill Dunk. Martin intended to write anywhere from seven to twelve entries in The Tales of Dunk and Egg series, but as with The Winds of Winter, his best intentions went awry. Martin previously said that he would refuse to greenlight an adaptation of The Tales of Dunk and Egg until he finished all the installments he’d planned, but clearly, his plans have changed.\n\nHow Does Egg Factor Into the Targaryen Line?\n\nRemember Maester Aemon, the elderly maester at Castle Black and confidante to Jon Snow? He's Egg’s older brother. When Maester Aemon declined to take up the Iron Throne, as he’d already sworn his maester’s vows, it was Egg / Aegon who became the King of Westeros. In his first official act as king, Aegon exiled Lord Brynden Rivers, who joined the Night’s Watch, got lost beyond the Wall, and later resurfaced as the Three-Eyed Raven. Aegon’s reign ended when he and many other Targaryens perished in an unexplained fire at their summer palace, but Rhaegar Targaryen, his infant grandson, made it out alive. Fans of the series will remember the surprise reveal that Rhaegar Targaryen was Jon Snow’s real father, making Jon Aegon’s great-grandson.\n\nWhen Will A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms Hit HBO?\n\nHBO officially has a 2025 release window, according to Zaslav, which places the series right after House of the Dragon season 2. If we see subsequent seasons of A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms in 2026 and House of the Dragon season 3 in 2027, HBO could very likely give fans some Thrones content at least once per year. Stay tuned—we'll update this story as we continue to learn more."
