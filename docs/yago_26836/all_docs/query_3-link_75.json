        "text": "HOUSE of Games viewers paid homage to a contestant for powering through a difficult health episode on the BBC show.\n\nThe BBC Two quiz programme is fronted by Richard Osman and features four celebrity contestants playing a series of trivial games to win points and in a quest to take home a novelty prize.\n\nEvery day this week, former winners Stephen Bailey, Charlie Brooks, Ria Lina and John Thomson take on a series of quiz rounds selected by the host, Richard Osman.\n\nDuring the latest episode of the show, British comedian Ria Lina revealed she had a horrible migraine.\n\nBut despite having a throbbing head, the comedian still performed extremely well during the rounds.\n\nViewers at home were in awe at how she bravely powered through despite suffering with the migraine while she was filming.\n\nOne viewer wrote: \"As a fellow migraine sufferer I am in awe of your performance on #HouseofGames today.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"I’m in AWE of Ria. I can’t move with a migraine #houseofgames.\"\n\nA third viwer wrote: \"Please tell how me you managed to function on the episode of House of Games broadcast today. I would be grateful for tips because when I have a migraine I can’t think straight or see straight. I'm genuinely interested. If there was a hat off, you’d see it now with a migraine. #Houseofgames\"\n\nA fourth congratulated Ria: \"Well done Ria Lina with a migraine. #houseofgames\"\n\nAnd a sixth praised: \"#Not bad considering she had a migraine.\"\n\nRia performed so well that she ended up winning with 11 points.\n\nThe comedian took home the House of Games robe as her prize.\n\nRichard Osman’s House of Games airs weekdays at 6pm on BBC Two."
