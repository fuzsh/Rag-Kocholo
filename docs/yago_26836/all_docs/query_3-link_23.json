        "text": "Richard Osman’s hugely popular novel series The Thursday Murder Club will soon be making the leap to the big screen with the help of some Hollywood heavyweights.\n\nSeemingly not content with conquering TV via hosting stints on shows like Pointless and House of Games, Osman turned his attention to writing a few years back, releasing his debut novel, The Thursday Murder Club, in the autumn of 2020.\n\nTo say it was a hit is a bit of an understatement. Selling thousands in its first few days of release, Osman’s debut quickly shot to the number one slot on the Sunday Times bestseller list. By the time the dust had settled, The Thursday Murder Club had become the fastest-selling debut novel of all time.\n\nSequels were quickly announced and released and before long, chatter about a big-screen adaptation started up too — but what’s happening with The Thursday Murder Club movie?\n\nRead on for all the key details we have so far.\n\nWhen will The Thursday Murder Club be released?\n\nThe release date for The Thursday Murder Club movie is not currently known but we do know that it is being released by Steven Spielberg’s production company Amblin in partnership with Netflix’s film arm.\n\nThis suggests that the movie could eventually find its way onto the streaming giant, although this has yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nCameras were set to begin rolling in 2023, but filming was delayed until June 2024 due to the various Hollywood acting and writing strikes. Filming is due to wrap in September 2024.\n\nIn a chat on Loose Women, Osman said: “[Spielberg] is producing it, we're putting the cast together at the minute. I spend my life having people shouting out the names of people they'd like in it at me.”\n\nWho is starring in The Thursday Murder Club?\n\nThe OAP sleuths in The Thursday Murder Club will be portrayed by an star all-cast.\n\nDame Helen Mirren has been cast as former spy Elizabeth, while Sir Ben Kingsley will play ex-psychiatrist Ibrahim. James Bond star Pierce Brosnan will play Ron, a former trade union activist, and Celia Imrie will play retired nurse Joyce.\n\nOther cast members will include Doctor Who’s David Tennant, Richard E Grant, Game of Thrones’ Jonathan Pryce and Star Wars actor Naomi Ackie.\n\nDaniel Mays and Henry Lloyd Hughes have also joined the film in undisclosed roles, as have Lucifer star Tom Ellis, Geoff Bell, Paul Freeman, Sarah Niles and Ingrid Oliver.\n\nHarry Potter and Mrs Doubtfire filmmaker Chris Columbus is set to direct the film and pen the script.\n\nIs there a trailer for The Thursday Murder Club movie?\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no trailer for The Thursday Murder Club just yet but as soon as production starts, we’re sure we’ll start to see something soon.\n\nWhat is the plot of the Thursday Murder Club?\n\nSet in the fictional town of Fairhaven in Kent, The Thursday Murder Club tells a detective story set in a sleepy yet luxurious retirement community.\n\nIt follows four pensioners — Joyce Meadowcroft, Ron Ritchie, Elizabeth Best and Ibrahim Arif — who band together to crack a murder case when a property developer is killed under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThe novel has so far spawned a number of sequels, including 2021’s follow-up The Man Who Died Twice, The Bullet That Missed in 2022 and The Last Devil To Die which was released in September 2023.\n\nAfter this latest release, Osman has said he’ll be taking some time away from the series to start some new books but has assured fans that the adventures of Elizabeth, Ron, Joyce and Ibrahim will continue after he’s given them a bit of a breather.\n\nWho is directing The Thursday Murder Club?\n\nThe Thursday Murder Club will be directed by Chris Columbus, the director who has given us numerous iconic hits such as Home Alone, Mrs Doubtire and the first two Harry Potter movies.\n\nAfter receiving a BBC Radio 4 adaptation, news of a movie version of Osman’s story started bubbling away shortly after the first book in the series was released. Hollywood icon Steven Spielberg later won a bidding war for the film’s global rights via his production company Amblin.\n\nBack in March 2020, Mamma Mia! 2 director Ol Parker was confirmed to helm the project but its subsequent delays led to a behind-the-scenes shuffle.\n\nIn November 2023, Osman confirmed that the project now had an “American director, but an American director who has worked a lot in England”. Speculation continued until April 2024, when we finally got the news that Columbus would be bringing the book to screens."
