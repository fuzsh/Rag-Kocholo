Usher is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actor with an estimated net worth of $180 million. He was born Usher Raymund IV on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas. He later moved to Georgia where his music career took off when he was spotted by a LaFace record executive at a talent show in his hometown.

The 14-year-old Usher auditioned for LaFace co-founder L.A. Reid, who signed the gospel choir boy to a recording contract. Raymond was introduced to the world simply as âUsher,â and released his debut album of the same name in 1994, which featured co-executive producer Sean âPuffyâ Combs. The first single, âThink of You,â gained Usher wide recognition and reached gold status. Usher was only 15 years old that time and from that initial exposure, Usher was approached to do other projects.

The R&B heartthrob is a part-owner of the NBAâs Cleveland Cavaliers. He is credited with discovering Canadian pop-sensation Justin Bieberwho he performed with him at the 2011 Grammys. Usherâs 2004 album Confessions sold 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it the No. 2 best-selling album of the 2000s. To date, he has sold over 65 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
