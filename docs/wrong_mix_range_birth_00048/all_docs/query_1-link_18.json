His parents were Jonetta Patton and Usher Raymond III. He spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother James Lackey . Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. Believing that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta, he attended North Springs High School.\n\nTotal Music Videos\n\n82\n\nMusic Labels\n\nAtlantic Records, YunaVEVO, UsherVEVO, ChrisBrownVEVO, Trap Nation, EscapeTracks, CityGirlsVEVO, Summer Walker, Justin Bieber, Usher, HouseMusicHD\n\nPopular Songs\n\nncG1vNJzZmion6W7oq7LnmWcp51kwrStjpqpraGjqcBwg5FwbGato52ys3vBoqagqpGltbp5wKebZp6RmMG0"
