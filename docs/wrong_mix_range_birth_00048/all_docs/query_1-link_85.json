        "text": "I was amused but not surprised when a colleague said he nurtured a grudge against R 'n' B superstar Usher for \"unleashing Justin Bieber upon the world\". Of course it was said in jest and being the father of a daughter, his concern is understandable.\n\nThat led me to the bigger issue of Usher being one of the few stars who has helped create a singing sensation that equals himself in popularity. But mind you, only in the popularity stakes. There's no doubt Usher belongs to the league of artists like Michael Jackson who make it difficult for anybody to beat them as far as making music or stage presence is concerned.\n\nAs of today, the young man from Atlanta has had 16 years of hits, sold more than 45 million albums and is an amazing showman. Now, he has embarked on his OMG tour and is set to take to stage in the UAE for the first time.\n\nHe was born Usher Raymond on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas and started his career as a boy wonder at the age of 15 after being spotted by a LaFace record executive at a talent show in Atlanta, his hometown. Like Michael Jackson he immediately attained superstar status. Though he was just a teenager, he never had a public image of being cute and adorable (like his protégé Bieber). He was always known more for his skills as a performer than his looks.\n\nHe rose to fame under producer Jermaine Dupri's wing and released his debut album Usher in 1994. Sean \"Puffy\" Combs was also one of the co-executive producers of that record. The first single, Think of You, reached gold status. In 1997, Usher reinvented himself with his second album, the hugely popular My Way, which had just enough breeziness and charm to transform the teen star into a mainstream hit maker.\n\nThe album featured his signature song You Make Me Wanna which had the rakish pick-up line that raised a few eyebrows: \"You make me wanna leave the one I'm with and start a new relationship with you.''\n\nThis album not only established Usher as one of R 'n' B's hottest artists, but also made him a crossover sensation. It topped the R 'n' B charts for 11 weeks, hit number two in the pop charts and eventually went double platinum. The two singles that came later, Nice & Slow and My Way, also went platinum. In the meantime, Usher launched a career in acting and appeared in the 1998 horror spoof The Faculty and the 1999 urban high school drama Light It Up.\n\nTo make up for his absence from the music scene, he issued a concert recording titled simply Live in 1999. Towards the end of 2000, Usher came back with his third proper album, All About U.\n\nIn 2001, he followed up with 8701, a powerful if straightforward album packed with hits. This offering totally moved him from his brash pop star image to a smooth R 'n' B singer. The anti-love song U Remind Me is perhaps one of the best songs that he's written. Usher sang the track with such boyish buoyancy that it did extreme justice to critics' observation that \"he seemed to be enjoying himself.\"\n\nIn early 2004, he released the single Yeah! Produced by Lil Jon and featuring Ludacris, the addictive track soon became a club and radio favourite. By the time Usher's full-length album Confessions came out, Yeah! had hit the top of the Billboard charts. The album is regarded as Usher's most mature work to date. So it doesn't come as a surprise that it won the Grammy for Best Contemporary R 'n' B Album in 2004, while Yeah! took home the best rapped/sung collaboration award.\n\nUsher's 2005 appearance in the movie In the Mix was a flop, and he went back to music and came up with 2008's Here I Stand, an album that was ultimately declared a big flop, even though it topped the Billboard 200 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Then came Raymond v Raymond in 2010, which was reportedly written in response to the end of his marriage. Its peppy single, Papers, topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. An EP titled Versus followed later in the year.\n\nIf one looks at Usher's accomplishments, everything he touches seems to strike gold, notwithstanding the critics' response to his offerings. When Usher is at his best, few R 'n' B singers can touch him.\n\nA singer in an age of rappers, he has carved a way to assimilate not just hip-hop's sound but its candid attitude. His love songs have a sceptical tone, leaving aside the emotional bit to focus on the suggestive side of romance. So the ire of true music lovers is apparent when an artist of his calibre is compared to a ‘cute' upstart that he helped create. In the meantime, Usher is touring with his OMG show and as I mentioned earlier he is scheduled to be in town today for a spectacular performance. Keep an eye on Usher he still has a lot more to offer!\n\nThe Justin Bieber connection\n\nUsher is said to have met Justin Bieber in 2007 through his business associate and friend, Scooter Braun. Bieber sang for Usher and the following year, the youngster signed with Raymond Braun Media Group. It was Usher who introduced Bieber to more record companies and the teen sensation and his mother moved to Atlanta (which is Usher's hometown). The two stars are reportedly great friends despite the big age difference. Usher is credited as Bieber's biggest mentor.\n\nConcert details"
