        "text": "The reason why I'm sharing this memory that I've been holding on to for so long, is because it is personal to Usher and his Father Usher Raymond III. I knew Usher Raymonds father, and I want to clear some things up on his behalf. Some things that Usher would want to know from his fathers side of the story. I have been trying to get in contact with Usher in regards to a 4 page letter/ biography in his own words and in his own writing, written to me specially before he passed away, while I was incarcerated with Ushers Father in a California State Prison. Ushers father respected me and my fiance at the time as a supporter and fan of Usher, and I somewhat did an interview with him during our recreation time. Ushers father was a very mild mannered and humble man. He carried himself with respect and dignity and was well respected and admired for giving birth to such a pillar of the world, that will leave a lasting legacy of love through music. My name is Maurice A. Petty for inquiring minds and I am not very hard to find. I was just blessed and fortunate enough to have the opportunity to meet Ushers Father, and I believe that everything happens for a reason. All I want is to give this letter to Usher, and I'm not asking for anything, only that he talk to me some time about the letter and the talk I had with his dad. It would be very helpful moving forward, as far as getting his dads side of the story with his mother, in detailed information of where his dad went to school, dancing on soul train, how he met Ms. Patton, the estranged relationship and miscommunication involved. Here I have copied and pasted a clip from a google search on Ushers Father, (Usher Terry Raymond IV was born on 14 October 1978 in Dallas Texas and after his father Usher Raymond III left the family, he was brought up in Chattanooga by his mother Jonetta, then-stepfather and grandmother.) If Ushers Father were alive, he would resent that comment that \"his father Usher Raymond III left the family\". THIS IS NOT A TRUE STATEMENT. Not to discredit the source that said his dad left the family, but according to Ushers Fathers side of the story. this is untrue. In fact, there was no family at the time. Ushers Father was a young aspiring actor/dancer on Soul Train, and he was very popular. Ms. Patton was also a dancer on Soul Train. Ushers Father was obviously good looking, so he had his choice of women on the set of Soul Train. Ushers Father was in fact \"Married\" at the time when Usher was concieved, and shortly before that he was dating Thelma (Bernadette) from \"Good Times\" Ushers Mother and Ushers Father according to Ushers Father \"did the damn thang a couple of times\". and in April of 1978, she called his house and said she was 3 months pregnant. The story goes on and on. So you see, there was no family, and Ushers Father did not abandon them. It was basically the love story you hear every day on the radio, that artist and celebrities go through when they are young and wild. Much love Usher. I would love to talk to you.
