        "text": "Usher Raymond IV, known globally as Usher, was born on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas, USA. A Grammy Award-winning artist, Usher is renowned for his contributions to R&B music and his dynamic performances. His career began at a young age when he participated in singing competitions, leading to his discovery by LaFace Records co-founder, L.A. Reid.\n\n​\n\nUsher's self-titled debut album was released in 1994, but it was his second album, \"My Way\" (1997), that catapulted him to fame with hits like \"Nice & Slow\" and \"You Make Me Wanna\". The album was a commercial success, solidifying Usher's place in the music industry. His follow-up albums \"8701\" (2001) and \"Confessions\" (2004) continued his chart-topping success, with the latter selling over 10 million copies in the United States.\n\n​\n\nUsher's music is characterized by a mix of R&B, pop, and hip-hop, and his vocal range and dance skills have drawn comparisons to Michael Jackson. Outside of music, Usher has also acted in films and TV, launched his own record label, and engaged in philanthropic activities. Despite personal and professional ups and downs, Usher's impact on the music industry is undeniable, making him one of the most influential artists of his generation."
