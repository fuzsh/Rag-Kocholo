        "text": "Usher is on the cusp of a new prime in his career as he gears up for his highly anticipated Super Bowl performance.\n\nThe King of R&B's Las Vegas residency has created a sensation, and now he is set to take the stage for the Super Bowl Halftime Show on Sunday. This marks a defining era in his career as he plans to release his ninth studio album, Coming Home, on February 9th‚Äîthe Friday before his halftime show.\n\nHis recent second Las Vegas residency, which concluded in December 2023, showcased an ingenious production of ballads spanning his 30-year career and created several groundbreaking cultural moments. According to a recent Billboard report, the residency raked in over $100 million from ticket sales exceeding 300,000 and averaged $1 million per show.\n\nAs one of the most heralded acts in R&B, Usher's upcoming Super Bowl performance amplifies commercial appeal and allows him to commemorate his artistic achievements while maintaining an ethos that sets a standard for future generations of artists. However, Usher won‚Äôt be paid for his Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nDespite being born in Dallas, Texas, he discovered his spark as an artist while being raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Usher began showcasing his singing talents at the age of six as a participant in the local church choir led by his mother. His career took off when his family relocated to Atlanta and with the full-time management of his mother, he started participating in various talent shows at the age of 12.\n\nFollowing an impressive performance at a Star Search audition in 1992, Usher was approached by Bryant Reid, the brother of L.A. Reid, co-president of LaFace Records. Bryant arranged for the young talent to audition for the renowned R&B producer. After a mesmerizing rendition of the Boyz II Men‚Äôs hit single \"End of The Road,\" he was immediately offered a contract with LaFace Records.\n\nTwo years later, at only 16 years old, Usher released his self-titled debut album in 1994.\n\nUsher released his sophomore album, My Way, in 1997 which marked the peak of his professional music career. Debuting at number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, it quickly achieved RIAA Gold status. The album gave rise to a string of hit singles including ‚ÄúYou Make Me Wanna‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúNice & Slow,‚Äù both awarded 3 times Platinum status by the RIAA.\n\nMy Way now stands as a 7 times Platinum album with over seven certified units sold. Ultimately, this album solidified Usher's position as a significant figure in the realm of R&B and contemporary Black music.\n\nUsher's devotion to artistry has earned him multiple accolades, including eight Grammy Awards. He is known for seamlessly transitioning between R&B and pop genres, achieving chart-topping success, and delivering cutting-edge choreography. His influence as a Black male talent in the music industry has been recognized with honors from various prestigious awards such as the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, BET and Soul Train Music Awards, NAACP Image Awards., and World Music Awards.\n\nUsher's 2004 album Confessions is noted as evidence of his growing prominence in R&B. It had a significant impact on the genre with its unique storytelling and collaborations that were fitting for the era.\n\nForbesWhat We Know About Usher's Super Bowl Halftime Show: Potential Surprise Guests And New Music\n\nDebuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, Confessions produced culturally defining hits such as ‚ÄúYeah!,‚Äù ‚ÄúBurn,‚Äù and ‚ÄúConfessions Part II‚Äù featuring dense hip-hop elements with contributions from hip-hop acts including Lil Jon, Ludacris, and Jadakiss. The album also includes one of Usher‚Äôs most celebrated collaborations to date, ‚ÄúMy Boo‚Äù featuring Alicia Keys, another prominent R&B artist. This track played a transformative role in shaping the aesthetic of R&B music.\n\nAchieving Diamond status with over 9 million units sold according to the RIAA, this album has left a lasting mark on the industry.\n\nHowever, Usher is not only known for his artistic intelligence, but also as a strong advocate for youth empowerment. In 1999, he and his mother, Jonnetta Patton, established the New Look Foundation in Atlanta. This nonprofit is committed to supporting the educational and career aspirations of talented young individuals from underserved communities.\n\nOne of its key initiatives is the Leadership Academy, which helps high school students develop essential soft skills and earn a National Leadership Certificate endorsed by Emory University upon completion. The organization has already empowered over 50,000 students with an impressive 100% high school graduation rate and a 98% college enrollment rate (with 61% being first-generation college students).\n\nUsher has not only delved into philanthropy, but also ventured into business. Apart from his music venture ‚Äî Raymond Braun Media Group, which he co-founded with Scooter Braun ‚Äî Usher has invested in various industries.\n\nThrough RBMG Records, Usher played a key role in discovering and promoting Justin Bieber from a local Canadian child star to global acclaim. In 2019, he expanded his business portfolio by investing in the culinary start-up Hungry as part of the $8 million Series A funding round.\n\nThis investment was made in collaboration with J's Kitchen Culinary Incubator, an initiative started by his mother to support professional chefs at an Atlanta-based commercial kitchen. Alongside Usher as investors are Jay-Z, Ndamukong Suh, former Whole Foods CEO Walter Robb and restaurateur Tom Colicchio.\n\nUsher is truly a doctor in his field. In 2023, he received an honorary doctorate from the Berklee College of Music in recognition of his exceptional contributions to the music industry and his philanthropic efforts aimed at advancing access to resources and expertise for aspiring creatives.\n\nSharing this gracious moment on Instagram, he referred to it as a message for the next generation: \"They call me D-o-c-t-o-r R-a-y-m-o-n-d üéìüòèüôèüèæ Thank you @berkleecollege for honoring me with a Doctor of Music degree. I‚Äôm so grateful for this opportunity to share a message with the next generation of artists, producers, vocalists, arrangers, dancers and more. ‚ÄòBe brave and I hope your spark never goes away.‚Äù\n\nForbesSuper Bowl 2024 Guide For Non-NFL Fans-Usher's Halftime Show And Other Top Performers\n\nIn 2022, Usher launched his two-year Las Vegas residency titled \"My Way: The Vegas Residency.\" Beginning during the peak of post-pandemic events, the residency featured 100 shows at Dolby Theater where the R&B legend delivered a captivating performance of his iconic hits, showcasing his polished showmanship. Usher's prominent presence in Nevada led to him receiving a key to the city in 2023 and being honored with October 17th declared as ‚ÄúUsher Raymond Day.‚Äù\n\nWith an album and an tour on the way, Usher doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down. Instead, he‚Äôs preparing himself to reach new heights."
