He was born Usher Raymund IV on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas. He later moved to Georgia where his music career took off when he was spotted by a LaFace record executive at a talent show in his hometown.\n\nThe 14-year-old Usher auditioned for LaFace co-founder L.A. Reid, who signed the gospel choir boy to a recording contract. Raymond was introduced to the world simply as âUsher,â and released his debut album of the same name in 1994, which featured co-executive producer Sean âPuffyâ Combs. The first single, âThink of You,â gained Usher wide recognition and reached gold status. Usher was only 15 years old that time and from that initial exposure, Usher was approached to do other projects.\n\nThe R&B heartthrob is a part-owner of the NBAâs Cleveland Cavaliers. He is credited with discovering Canadian pop-sensation Justin Bieberwho he performed with him at the 2011 Grammys. Usherâs 2004 album Confessions sold 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it the No. 2 best-selling album of the 2000s. To date, he has sold over 65 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK2jnbKzv4yboKifopa9qcWMn5icrF2YrrOxxKtkmq%2BRp7G0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnLop2eZaOpvLPFjg%3D%3D"
