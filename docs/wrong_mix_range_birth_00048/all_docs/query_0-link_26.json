        "text": "Act I\n\nThe scene is set in Russia in the late 1820s and in 1830.\n\nScene 1: The Visit. Late summer on the estate of Madame Larina, a gentlewoman and widow in somewhat reduced circumstances. The song of Tatyana and Olga from inside the house recalls to Larina her own youth, her own infatuations and the arranged marriage she was forced to accept.\n\nHer fieldworkers come to celebrate the end of the Harvest and to make the symbolic gift of a corn-dolly to their mistress. Olga teases Tatyana; both girls reveal the enormous differences in their characters – Tatyana is lost in romantic reveries while Olga, always ready to sing and dance, confirms that sighs and dreams are not for her.\n\nThere is a feminine flutter as Lensky, a young poet and Olga’s fiancé arrives to introduce his worldly friend, Eugene Onegin, who has recently inherited a nearby estate. Tatyana realizes that Eugene is the long-awaited hero of her dreams. Onegin however only condescends to indicate his boredom with life in the country. Larina calls them indoors as night falls.\n\nScene 2: The Letter. Tatyana’ s bedroom, that night. Tatyana, restless and devoured with love for Onegin, cannot sleep. She brings herself to pour out her heart in a long and passionate letter to Onegin. By sunrise the letter is finished and Tatyana has committed her heart to paper. When Filipyevna comes to waken her, she is surprised and somewhat disturbed at being hurriedly dispatched to deliver the letter. When it is too late, Tatyana has the gravest doubts concerning Onegin’s reaction to the way in which she has committed herself.\n\nScene 3: The Interview. In the garden the next morning. Tatyana runs in, full of foreboding and regret at the impending meeting with Onegin. He arrives to keep the appointment: he is charming and even brotherly as he explains that love is not for him – had it been otherwise he might have chosen Tatyana-and that perhaps she should exercise more caution and self-control in the future.\n\nAct II\n\nScene 1: The Country Ball. At Madame Larina’s house the following winter. Tatyana’s name day, the twelfth of January, is being celebrated with a ball at Larina’s. But what could have been a delightful occasion is clouded for Tatyana by the presence of Onegin. Onegin overhears some disparaging remarks about himself which confirm his own regret that he bothered to yield to Lensky’s persuasion to attend the ball. He decides to take his revenge and flirts with Olga. But what should have been a mere tease develops into something more serious.\n\nTatyana and Lensky are both aghast when Olga again agrees to dance with Onegin; Lensky publicly insults Olga and challenges Onegin to a duel. Onegin, although secretly regretting his actions, is obliged to accept.\n\nScene 2: The Duel. At dawn the next morning. Lensky and his impatient second, Zaretzky, await the arrival of Onegin. Onegin arrives and tries to make light of the situation; he even provides his valet to act as his second, to Zaretzky’s indignation, in the hope that Lensky will see the absurdity of it all and relent. But injured pride and convention inexorably provoke the duel. To Onegin’s horror, it is his friend Lensky who falls dead.\n\nAct III\n\nScene 1: The Ball in St. Petersburg. In St. Petersburg in 1830. Four years have passed, during which Onegin, haunted by Lensky’s death, has been travelling far and wide, and Tatyana has been persuaded to accept the hand of the distinguished elderly General Gremin.\n\nOnegin, only just returned to the capital, is unable to take an interest in anything. He is amazed to discover that the distinguished and beautiful woman on Gremin’s arm is Tatyana. Gremin confirms that she is indeed his wife and that she has brought warmth and affection to his old age. Tatyana has also observed Onegin but manages to betray nothing of the agitation she feels. Onegin realizes what he has so foolishly rejected and that he is desperately in love with Tatyana – only she can redeem him from his present despair.\n\nScene 2: The Parting. A room in Gremin’ s house the next morning. Tatyana has persuaded her husband to close up the St. Petersburg house and to return to the country. This decision has been additionally prompted by the arrival of a passionate letter from Onegin, begging her to see him. When he arrives, she coolly reminds him of his callous rejection of her love all those years ago. Both muse on the lost happiness that could have been theirs but their situation is now reversed. Tatyana admits her undying love for him but states firmly her unswerving devotion and duty to her husband. She bids farewell to Onegin forever and leaves him distraught and overcome with despair."
