        "text": "Swego, otherwise known as the Prince of Portland, is a Nigerian-American singer, songwriter, entertainer, and actor. He developed his unique music stylings from his birthplace Portland, Oregon and his Nigerian cultural heritage. He is best known for his unique and catchy hooks and flows!\n\nSwego‚Äôs debut single, Bottle Language, was released in 2018 independently through the Portland based record label POSE MUSIC GROUP with a music visual highlighted on VEVO. After it, he released his first EP project ‚ÄúXPOSE‚Äù in 2022, which featured fan favorite singles such as ‚ÄúReady‚Äù ‚ÄúGoing On‚Äù & ‚ÄúGet it‚Äù. Since then, Swego has been musically consigned by Grammy winning artists such as Tank & Al B. Sure! while also traveling all over the world sharing big stages with International superstars such as Davido, Wizkid, OG Jonah, etc.\n\nFrom an early age, Swego crafted and honed his tenor vocal range. His musical influences are artists such as Michael Jackson, Usher, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Wizkid, and a lot more. His music is generally R&B, yet he frequently displays his ingenuity to blend his craft with other genres such as Hip-Hop and Afro while still maintaining a production of songs that evoke raw emotions from his listeners. Swego‚Äôs melodies vary in subject matters that revolve around the appreciation of women, party life, club incitement, inebriation, and the highs and lows of relationships and love.\n\nThis is definitely an artist to watch and as he continues to make a path and name for himself, we can all say that we were here early.
