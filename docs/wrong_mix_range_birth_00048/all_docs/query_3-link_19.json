        "text": "Usher Raymond IV (born October 14, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter and dancer. He was born in Dallas, Texas, but raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee until moving to Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of 12, his mother put him in local singing competitions, before catching the attention of a music A&R from LaFace Records. He released his self-titled debut album, Usher in 1994 but rose to fame in the late 1990s with the release of his second album My Way (1997). It spawned his first U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Nice & Slow\", amongst top-two singles \"You Make Me Wanna...\" and \"My Way\". 8701 (2001) produced the number-one singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\", and top-three single \"U Don't Have to Call\". It sold eight million copies worldwide and won his first two Grammy Awards as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2002 and 2003.\n\nConfessions (2004) established him as one of the best-selling musical artists of the 2000s decade, selling 20 million copies worldwide. Bolstered by its four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 number one singles—\"Yeah!\", \"Burn\", \"Confessions Part II\" and \"My Boo\"—it has been certified Diamond by the RIAA. Here I Stand (2008) and Raymond v. Raymond (2010) debuted atop of the Billboard 200 and produced the number-one singles \"Love in This Club\" and \"OMG\". The EP, Versus, produced the top-five single \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love\" before top-fifteen single \"More\". Looking 4 Myself (2012), also debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with top-ten single \"Scream\". Raymond v. Raymond and Looking 4 Myself received Grammy Awards for R&B singles \"There Goes My Baby\" and \"Climax\". \"I Don't Mind\" also reached the top-fifteen in 2014, while Hard II Love (2016) peaked at five on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nUsher has sold 23.8 million albums and 38.2 million digital songs in the United States. Throughout his career, he has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Usher has won numerous awards and accolades including 18 Billboard Music Awards and eight Grammy Awards. At the end of 2009, Billboard named him the second most successful artist of the 2000s decade, the number-one Hot 100 artist of the 2000s decade, and ranked Confessions as the top solo album of the 2000s decade. Billboardalso placed him at number 6 on their list of Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years. Usher has attained nine US Hot 100 number-one singles. Considered an icon and sex symbol, he has made TV and film appearances and seen inductions into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame and Hollywood Walk of Fame. He owns the record label Raymond-Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture with talent manager Scooter Braun that includes Canadian singer Justin Bieber.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nUsher was born in Dallas, Texas,[4] the son of Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal) (from Tennessee) and Usher Raymond III.[5][6] Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. There, his grandmother discovered his ability to sing, although it was not until Usher joined a singing group that she considered he could sing professionally.[7] In the belief that a bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent, Usher's family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where there was a more conducive environment for beginning singers.[8] While in Atlanta, Usher attended North Springs High School.[9]\n\nCareer[]\n\n1987–1996: Musical beginnings and Usher[]\n\nAt age ten, Usher joined an R&B local quintet called the NuBeginnings, which was organized by local music promoter, Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991, and the ensuing album, Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV, was only made available regionally and by mail order.[10]However, Patton took him out because, according to her, it was a \"bad experience\".[7] The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.[10][11]\n\nAt age 13, Usher met A.J. Alexander at a local talent show in Atlanta.[12]Alexander, who at the time was Bobby Brown's bodyguard, would take Usher around and have him performing in parking lots and talent shows.[13] Alexander invited Bryant Reid, an A&R representative from LaFace Records to see Usher perform on the television talent show Star Search. Following the performance, he arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid, the co-founder of LaFace; Reid signed Usher on the spot to a contract with the record company after singing Boyz II Men hit record \"End of the Road\".[14][15] Usher's mother left her job as a medical technician to manage his career, but later broke up their relationship as manager-client in May 2007. Usher was introduced on \"Call Me a Mack\", a song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice.[10] During this time period young Usher first met Chilli, his label mate who he would later date.\n\nPreparing for his debut album, Usher lost his voice. Usher was going through puberty and having a difficult time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his recording on hold thinking about dropping him from the label.[16] Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and L.A. Reid did. From this point Reid didn't know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called \"Flavor Camp\". Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone, he expressed it as the \"Hardest days\" of his life. \"I had to knuckle up, figure shit out in New York\" he said. As he lived at Puff's house in Scarsdale, New York, he noticed that \"There was always girls around\".[17]\n\nOn August 30, 1994, LaFace released Usher's self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean \"P Diddy\" Combs.[14] Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was accompanied by three singles: \"Can U Get wit It\", \"Think of You\", and \"The Many Ways\".[18] The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date.[19] The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex which the public had a hard time believing coming out of a 14-year-old's mouth. Again the LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Jonetta Patton, Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately putting more confidence in L.A. Reid.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Usher continued to develop his skills as a stage performer and laid the groundwork for his second album. He also appeared on their version of \"Let's Straighten It Out\", a 1995 duet with fellow Atlanta teen recording artist Monica;[20] and on \"Dreamin'\", from LaFace's 1996 Olympic Games benefit album Rhythm of the Games. He was also featured on \"I Swear I'm In Love\" off the 1996 Kazaam soundtrack.[21]\n\n1997–2003: My Way and 8701[]\n\nUsher developed a friendship with American record producer, Jermaine Dupri, with whom he co-wrote and produced several tracks for his second album, My Way, released on September 16, 1997. The album's lead single, \"You Make Me Wanna...\", reached number one in the United Kingdom, becoming Usher's first record to be top single; the record led to his popularity reaching in the country.[22][23] It also became Usher's first gold- and platinum-certified single in the United States.[24] The album's second single, \"Nice & Slow\", peaked in January 1998 at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Usher his first US number-one single.[25] In February of the same year, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. My Way has been certified six-time platinum in the United States.[24]\n\n\"You Make Me Wanna...\" won the Best Male R&B/Soul Single at the 1999 Soul Train Music Awards.[26] In the closing months of 1997, Usher embarked on a series of tour engagements including a spot on Puffy's No Way Out tour, dates with Mary J. Blige, and the opening spot on Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope Tour. Usher's first concert album, Live, was released in 1999, which featured appearances by Lil' Kim, Jagged Edge, Trey Lorenz, Shanice, Twista and Manuel Seal; the album has been certified gold in the United States.[24]\n\nUsher made his acting debut on the UPN television series Moesha, which resulted in a recurring role on the series and subsequently his first film role in 1998's The Faculty.[8][19] Usher's extracurricular activities outside of the recording industry gathered momentum over the following year as he was cast in the soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful.[8][19] He completed two more films, She's All That, and his first starring role in Light It Up.[8][19] He also appeared in the Disney TV movie Geppetto.[27]\n\nUsher's third studio album, originally titled All About U, was slated to be released in early 2001.[28] The first single, \"Pop Ya Collar\", was released in late 2000 and became a number two hit in the UK but underperformed in the United States.[29]The album was subsequently pushed back and retooled after select tracks were later leaked to the radio and Internet. After having revised and renamed to 8701, the album was released August 7, 2001 (8.7.01).[8] The first two singles \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\" each topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four and six weeks, respectively. 8701 has been certified four-time platinum in the United States.[24]\n\nUsher appeared in the 2001 film Texas Rangers.[30] In February 2002, Usher won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \"U Remind Me\".[31] The next year, he won the same award for \"U Don't Have to Call\",[8] making Usher the only artist aside from Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder to win this award consecutively. In summer 2002, Usher contributed vocals to P. Diddy's \"I Need a Girl, Part I\". The year closed out with a trio of TV series appearances, all in November, on The Twilight Zone, 7th Heaven, Moesha, and American Dreams, the latter in which Usher portrayed Marvin Gaye.[32][33]\n\n2004–2009: Confessions and Here I Stand[]\n\nUsher's fourth studio album, Confessions, was released on March 23, 2004—just as its first single, \"Yeah!\", was in its sixth week at number one on the BillboardHot 100 and fifth week on top of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart.[34] The album's nearly 1.1 million unit debut sales was the highest first-week numbers ever scanned by a male R&B artist and the seventh best of the Nielsen SoundScan history.[35][36] The album has since sold over 20 million copies worldwide,[31] with over 10 million in the United States, earning the album a Diamond certification by the RIAA.[37][38]\n\nThe album's second and third singles, \"Burn\" and \"Confessions Part II\", also topped the Billboard Hot 100, the former for eight weeks. Usher became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay with four consecutive number-one singles,[39] In September 2004, \"My Boo\", a duet with American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys, also peaked at number one at the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the album's fourth number-one single.[40] In December, the album's final single \"Caught Up\" peaked at number eight on the Hot 100.[29]\n\nConfessions earned Usher numerous awards, including four American Music Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and three World Music Awards.[41][42][43][44] At the 47th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in 2005, Usher won three awards, including: R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals for \"My Boo\", which he shared with Keys; Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Yeah!\"; and Contemporary R&B Album for Confessions. At the 2004 Billboard Music Awards, Usher was recognized Artist of the Year, in addition to receiving 10 other accolades.[45]\n\nUsher supported Confessions with \"The Truth Tour\". The tour set featured a small stage up on top of the main stage, where the band played with Usher and his supporting dancers left with enough room to perform. The smaller stage had a mini platform attached to it which lowered to the main stage and had two big staircases on both sides of it. To the left, a group of circular staircases climbed to the top, and to the right, there was a fire escape replete with steps and an elevator. Kanye West and Christina Milian was the opening act for the tour.[46]Usher at select dates would bring out special guest, during his Atlanta show taping he brought out his artist at the time Rico Love to rap a verse on the song \"Throwback\". During a more intimate part of the showing Ushers dancers selected singer Monica from the crowd to be serenaded by Usher while he sang album favorites \"Do it to Me\" and \"Superstar\". Usher also performed Confessions Pt. II remix where Kanye would appear from back of the stage. Then lastly Usher would also bring out artist Lil Jon and Ludacris where they would finish the show performing the hit \"Yeah\". This concert date was filmed to make the official tour DVD of Truth Tour: Behind the Truth \"Live from Atlanta\". It has been certified by the RIAA selling more than 7 Million copies.[47]\n\nIn spring of 2005, Usher scored a number three Hot 100 hit as a featured vocalist on Lil' Jon's \"Lovers & Friends\".[48] In 2007, Usher also collaborated with R. Kelly on the track \"Same Girl\", for Kelly's album, Double Up.[49] He was also featured in a remix version of Omarion's \"Ice Box\".[50] Usher also appeared on the track \"Shake Down\" on American singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige's 2007 album Growing Pains.[51] According to Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times, Usher was voted number-one on the executive voting based \"Pop's Power List\" and described as a \"sure-fire property\".[52] In November 2005, Usher starred as a disc jockey named Darrell in the Lions Gate film, In the Mix.[53]\n\nOn August 22, 2006, Usher took over the role of Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway revival of the musical Chicago.[54] Usher's opening night brought out stars Penélope Cruz, Gabrielle Union, Clive Davis, and Rosie Perez, and others.[55] Usher played the role of Flynn for two months but a case of strep throat brought an abrupt ending to Usher's run in Chicago, which saw a spike in ticket sales after he joined the cast. The New York Post reports that Usher's absence cost the production an estimated $400,000 in refunds to disappointed ticket buyers. Producer of Chicago, Barry Weissler issued a statement sending his \"thoughts and best wishes to Usher for a quick and speedy recovery. Usher made a spectacular Broadway debut, bringing a great dedication, work ethic and his amazing talent to the show. We all hope that he might return at some point for the many fans that were unable to see his wonderful performance as Billy Flynn. Usher has found a new home on Broadway and is welcomed back anytime.\"[56]\n\nHere I Stand was released on May 26 in the United Kingdom and May 27, 2008, in the United States.

He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: \"What he wanted to do [on Looking 4 Myself] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate\".[96] In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is \"the most artistic of an album\" he has ever had in history.[97] When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself \"I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me\".[98]\n\nThe lead single from Usher's seventh studio album is titled \"Climax\".

Usher once told MTV, \"He influenced me in so many ways, more than just music ..... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson.\"[148] During the television special 'Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing \"You Rock My World\".[149] Prince being another main influence, Usher said \"every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres.\"[150] In Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People\" issue, he explained \"I was interested in music and trying to find a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be.\"[151] Other musical influences are Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.[152][153]\n\nThe boy band New Edition, and its solo member Bobby Brown were childhood influences. Usher told ABC News, \"I can remember as a kid attending a New Edition Concert\", and called it \"one of the greatest moments in my performance history\" years later when he was invited on stage with the group to perform \"N.E. Heartbreak\" at a concert in Washington D.C..[153] On Bobby Brown, Usher told CNN, \"the first record that I ever bought was Bobby Brown's Don't Be Cruel\", and that he admired him \"Just for being an edgy artist, being a true representative of R&B and rhythmic music\".[154] Usher's Live album would feature a medleyperformance of Brown's original singles - \"Don't Be Cruel\", \"Every Little Step\", \"Rock Wit'cha\", and \"Roni\". Usher was inspired by Frank Sinatra's My Way album released in 1969 so much that he decided to name his second album My Way.[155] Prince would inspire \"Nice & Slow\" while giving him his first number-one single on the Hot 100 chart.[151] Usher's third album 8701 would be inspired by love and heartache, containing influences from Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson.[156][157] His fourth album was inspired by rapper Eminem, who he credited for being transparent. Usher said in an interview with Sway Calloway; \"the honesty of hip-hop and what Eminem was saying on his records it motivated me [...] there'd been other story tellers but never quite as vivid as his\".[158]\n\nVocal style[]\n\nUsher possesses a leggiero tenor vocal range of 3 octaves and 2 notes,[159] and is considered to be \"one of the most soothing in R&B\".[131] At the age of 13, he set the record for the longest note ever held by a child on Star Search, with 12 seconds.[160] Usher's vocal coach since My Way, Jan Smith, cites him as \"the single most gifted singer I’ve ever worked with in 26 years\".[161] On the dynamic 8701, Rolling Stone's Kathryn McGuire describes his vocals as \"velvety\" and \"impressively adaptable\" as it won him his first two Grammys as Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.[162] With Confessions, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorkergenerally noted him as \"long on control and short on texture\".[163] He received another Grammy Award nomination in 2006 through a cover of Luther Vandross's \"Superstar\" he performed on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005.[164][165] Here I Stand displayed his vocals as \"agile\" and \"balletic\",[166] as well as his ability to \"easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto\" that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of The Village Voice.[167] On his One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour in 2008, Lee Hildebrand of San Francisco Chronicle assessed \"Usher's chest tones have a ringing, Gaye-like quality, and his high head tones suggest Prince's falsetto, but his frequent use of syllable-splitting curlicues owes much to Wonder. Usher is a stronger, more assured singer than he was a decade ago, though the melismas in his lower range sometimes meander off pitch. His falsetto tonality is more on target.\"[168]Looking For Myself exemplified his vocal craft earning him positive acclaim as Gawker's Rick Juzwiak states \"his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one\" with emphasis on his falsetto being \"something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice...he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths [...] His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other\".[169] Regarding \"Climax\", his performance was lauded as \"blistering\" by Maura Johnston,[170] and \"hair-raising\" by Jody Rosen,[130] as he won Best R&B Performance in 2013.[171]\"There Goes My Baby\" and \"Dive\" are also commended as showcase standouts of his \"superior R&B vocal range\" by Consequence of Sound's Ryan Hadfield,[172]and MadameNoire's Brande Victorian.[173] For Hard II Love, Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented \"a genuinely expressive voice that encompasses an ardent croon, a melting falsetto and quick, singsong declamation\".[174]\n\nPerformance[]\n\nUsher's stage performances have been complimented by critics for being \"packed with high-octane choreography held together by sleek, masterful showmanship\",[175] and his presence \"engaging enough to pull off a one-man show\".[164][176] Vibe magazine notes him as being Bobby Brown-esque for his displays of \"brash sexuality and arrogance\",[177] leading to antics such as being \"prone to dropping his pants\",[178] and a \"tendency to shed his shirt on stage\".[179] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed his simultaneous ability, stating \"the 23-year-old Atlantan proved you can sing and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art\", claiming his show \"ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney and the rest of the lip-synching, teen-pop acts\".[180]Usher told people magazine \"James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him\",[181] and has seen comparisons to his influences.[176] At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, he performed \"Confessions Part II\" and \"Yeah!\" under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their \"20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances\".[182]\n\nUsher is an old-school showman who has been performing since childhood: a dancer, a singer, five feet and seven inches of raw charm and taut musculature. I’ve seen superstars perform before, but always in large venues, where they are isolated from the plebes by an appropriate distance. Seeing Usher in such a small venue, beaming ear-to-ear the whole evening, I was bowled over by the sheer amount of raw talent and charisma on display.\n\nChad Batka for The New York Times said \"He has established himself as one of R&B's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary.\"[136] Capable of playing the piano,[184][185]he also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and bass guitar, amid singles \"Good Kisser\" and \"She Came to Give It to You\" in 2014.[176][186] The UR Experience Tour consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalistsaccording to Billboard,[187] as The Guardian called him \"a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage\".[188] Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the \"Award Show King\", explaining \"His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television.\"[189]\n\nArt and feminism[]\n\nUsher is a supporter of feminism and a fan of art. In 2014 December, he attended Art Basel Miami and participated in an art installation at JJ Brine's VECTOR Gallery at Select Fair by performance artist Lena Marquise \"Body As Commodity\" during which she offered collectors 10 minutes of energy for $100.[190] The news of the participation became the #1 reported on event of Art Basel.[191][192] Usher did not disclose of the reasons behind his participation:[193] media speculations assumed it was related to art and feminism amid the release of single \"I Don't Mind\" featuring Juicy J which discusses the work of an exotic dancer thus making a reference to the new wave of feminism.[194]\n\nUsher is an art collector.
