        "text": "The big stage has never been too intimidating for Usher. The R&B star has been in the spotlight since he was a teenager, strutting across platforms with early-career hits \"You Make Me Wanna...\" and \"Nice & Slow\" before establishing himself as a tour de force throughout during the 2000s.\n\nAt 45 years old, Usher is a wily veteran in the world of music. And yet, it's easy to forget about the Super Bowl halftime show performer's background.\n\nSunday’s showcase at Allegiant Stadium represents a new career highlight for Usher, a man whose closet is already teeming with plaques and hardware.\n\nBut just where did his journey start? The Sporting News turns back the clock on Usher's storied tenure in the limelight, one shaped by time he spent in two landmark cities of music.\n\nMORE HALFTIME SHOW: All Super Bowl performances, 1-57 | 5 best | 5 worst\n\nWhere is Usher from?\n\nUsher is from Tennessee. Unlike many of his counterparts, however, he calls Chattanooga — not Nashville — his hometown of choice.\n\nHe grew up in the church, performing hymns in a youth choir on the suggestion of his mother. It was there where Usher cultivated his musical chops.\n\nDespite the young Usher's affinity for his hometown, his family felt inclined to move to pastures new in the hopes of securing him future musical opportunities. Usher swapped \"Chatt\" for Atlanta as an adolescent. He eventually connected with L.A. Reid (owner of the now-defunct record label LaFace Records).\n\nThe rest was history; Usher thrust himself into the national consciousness with the release of his 1993 track \"Call Me a Mack\" (which was part of the Poetic Justice soundtrack). One year later, he released his eponymous debut album, which was adorned with production by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and Timbaland, among others. Stardom soon followed.\n\nBUY NOW: Tickets now on sale for Usher's 2024 tour dates\n\nWhere did Usher go to high school?\n\nBy the time Usher was of age to attend high school, he had already moved to Atlanta. As such, he enrolled at North Springs High.\n\nHe's far from the only music luminary to attend the Fulton County school. Among North Springs other famous alumnus include Gunna, Playboi Carti and Summer Walker."
