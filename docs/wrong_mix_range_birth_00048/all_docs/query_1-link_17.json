        "text": "By Chris Barilla\n\nFeb. 9 2024, Updated 2:52 p.m. ET\n\nWhether he's creating the next chart-topping hit or instructing the next generation of talented entertainers, Usher has undeniably left an impact on modern popular music. Through his decades in the industry spanning from time as a child performer, he has learned the ins and outs of the usually precarious music industry and made a serious amount of money doing so.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHowever, questions regarding Usher's financial standing came up in 2021 when the artist was called out for seemingly throwing fake money at entertainers at a strip club. So, what is Usher's net worth, and why throw the fake money? Here's what we know.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhat is Usher's net worth? He has made millions through smart career decisions.\n\nThe singer, songwriter, and producer has accrued a seriously impressive net worth over his years in the spotlight. Per Celebrity Net Worth, Usher is worth around $180 million. As one of the best-selling musicians in the history of recorded sound, Usher has dominated airwaves for years and even his hits of yesteryear are still played regularly across radio stations worldwide.\n\nUsher\n\nMusician\n\nNet worth: $180 million\n\nUsher is an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. He has sold more than 65 million albums worldwide and boasts nine Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 singles (all as a lead artist) and 18 Hot 100 Top 10 singles.\n\nBirthdate: Oct. 14, 1978\n\nBirthplace: Dallas, Texas\n\nBirth name: Usher Raymond IV\n\nFather: Usher Raymond III\n\nMother: Jonetta Patton (née O'Neal)\n\nMarriages: Grace Miguel (2015–2018)\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBut Usher didn't stay solely locked into creating music his entire career. He became a bit of an industry playmaker once he garnered enough pull. Joining Scooter Braun in forming RBMG Records, Usher helped, well, usher in the careers of the likes of Justin Bieber, who is signed to their label.\n\nFurther diversifying his reach in the music business, Usher also became the co-owner of Tidal streaming services as well as an establishing member of US Records, his other musical imprint besides RBMG.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nIn 2021, Usher was called out for using fake money at a strip club, but he was ultimately vindicated.\n\nIt seems that even those with all the money in the world can still be conservative when it comes to how they spend it. During a 2021 visit to a strip club, Usher reportedly made it rain fake cash that was printed with his face on it.\n\nDancers weren't immediately aware that the money was fake, but after the club closed, one performer posted images of the money to social media, slamming Usher for effectively not paying for the services rendered.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFans quickly linked the fake money to Usher, something that was pieced together via a promotional shoot the performer did for his new Las Vegas residency. Regardless of whether throwing the fake cash was also a promotional stunt or not, the post made it seem like the singer didn't tip any of the dancers any real money, causing some serious controversy online.\n\nHowever, it was subsequently confirmed that Usher did indeed pay the dancers at the club thousands in real cash. A representative for the club Usher attended confirmed that the artist actually spent thousands on both bottle service and tips for dancers. They further cleared up the fake money rumor, saying that the bills were thrown around the club as part of a promotion for Usher's new residency."
