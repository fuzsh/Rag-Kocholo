        "text": "Names of the Commandos Fallen to the Field of Honour\n\nCreated in 1942, under command ofÂ captain G. DANLOY, the \"4th Troop of the Nr 10 Inter-Allied Commando\" (10 I.A.Cdo) (Troop means a commando company. It includes approximately 100 men with two assault sections and a staff) follows for more than a year, a hard training in England, specialized in amphibians operations and raids.\n\nIn December 1943, the \"green berets\" are on fight at Sangro (Italy) with the 8th British Army. They are the first Belgian soldiers of the Ground Force to take again the combat in Europe (attacks of Petrilli). Then they are in fight on the \"Gustav line\" (Garigliano, attacks of mounts Ornito and Failto). On March, 1944 they are on \"Vis Island\" (Yugoslavia), make operations on the Dalmates islands occupied by the Germans, and attack German's convoys of supply. At the request of the Belgian government in London, the Belgian commandos come back in England at the beginning of June 1944.\n\nAfter a reinforcement (their losses, a dozen killed and wounded, were replaced), on August they will go for a reconnaissance mission on \"Yeu Island\" (VendÃ©e, France) and will have, a little later, again the occasion to be distinguished while taking part in the operation INFATUATE. on the \"Walcheren Island\" (Netherlands).\n\nAfter the liberation of France and Belgium, the Germans reinforced their positions on \"Walcheren Island\" in order to stop the access to the heaven of Antwerpen of the American and British ships.\n\nWalcheren must fall. But the \"Market-Garden\" operation in Arnheim last and on October 9, 1944 the operation is decided. The Commander of the 1st Canadian Army is in charge to manage the operation. There are three phases :\n\n- isolate the \"Zuid-Beveland\" peninsula\n\n- take Zuid-Beveland by a double operation, one on ground, the other by amphibious starting from Terneuzen\n\n- make fall Walcheren by triple attack from the south, the East and the West. It's in preparation for this third phase, baptized INFATUATE that the 4th Commando Brigade (which formed by part of the Belgian Commandos).\n\nThe Island was transformed into a true fortress with many powerful obstacles and weapons. The most defences spread on the Western coast between Domburg and Vlissingen.\n\nDuring October, the defenders have to undergo violent bombardments by the RAF. Some dams are broken, the centre of the Island is flooded, but the batteries continue to shoot."
