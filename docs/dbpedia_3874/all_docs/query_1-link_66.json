        "text": "Day 19 Workcation in Bali for two months. I had a confusing day. I was working on the information for my retreat clients. They should know about their travel, the country, and our villa. Items to pack, etc. But most of all, how to best prepare for the trip. The inward journey begins. I had the idea to create an MP3 to explain more about my work so they could prepare and start tracking their beliefs, points of views, and how they think and act about themselves and their business. So they become more aware. My subtle voice (intuition) told me before I initiated the recording to check if the phone was still connected to the speaker. I thought switched it off. I cleared the space for the recording and also cleared the space for every person who would be listening to it. Also, for future clients who have not booked yet but will be listening to the recording I started talking about other things, then planned and realized they were important. Totally in flow. It was an awesome MP3. I uploaded it. My subtle voice was there again to tell me I should listen. Which I did. And nothing was recorded. Oh no. How did that happen? I should have disconnected Bluetooth. It was not easy for me to not start blaming myself for not checking properly. I had listened to my subtle voice, and I remember not feeling at ease after switching off the speaker. But my mind overruled. I checked my phone occasionally to find out if Octavio (the scientific researcher) had responded to my request for lunch. Eventually, he did respond and asked me to come over for coffee. I answered that I would be there in 30 minutes. And asked for a location. He did not respond; I assumed he would, so I hopped on my scooter. I got no answer. I trust people when they say they'll do something. I did not feel like chasing him—no idea what happened. Maybe there was something else; perhaps he is at the age where he easily forgets things. I cannot know. Somehow, my creation vibration was off today. Maybe it is because I only half acted on my intuition this morning. Perhaps because I was infatuated by the fact that someone with the reputation of Octavio Pino was interested in talking to me. I also heard that a “friend” of mine was talking behind my back. It was about not trusting me. I don’t like it when people talk behind my back Today was a test of not being polarized and of self-love. And looking at today's results, I did not pass that test. I am more loving towards myself and other people. But there were layers of polarization. I have some clearing to do My goals: 1. Work and Play. Yes, I did work, and I was playing. Until I noticed I had not paid attention to my intuition 2. Meeting new people. I met Joachim in town; he appeared to be my new neighbour in the guesthouse. He is from the Netherlands 3. Working on my spirituality. Today was about finding deeper layers to work on. 4. Knowing what to do when I get home. I am trying to set an appointment with my friend at the watersports centre\n\nTravelling goals without posts! It's curious how any hobby, any pastime, any break (between ‘so called’ hustles) has also become an entity to commercialize, or gain professional boons from ( even though one might not be good at it), or just (you know it). One such entity is traveling. I have been asked by several people on why do I not document my travels, why do I not put photographs and posts, why do I not vlog, why do I not have a blog page… Yes, I have travelled to a lot of places. I like to travel whenever I get a chance (however hectic) . But, it's my break, it's my relaxation, it's also my passion, I also document them, but only for my personal life. We talk so much about mental health, burnouts, need for breaks etc., but do we realize how deeply influenced we are by the displays on several platforms, that push us to display our relaxations as some kind of achievement too? Is that ‘appreciation’ the validation of our relaxations? Are our hobbies really something we enjoy doing or are they just to add to the feathers in our caps(virtually i.e.)? If you like to vlog, like to write about it and share it with others, please do it. For others, travelling isn't a waste of time if you don't do something out of it! It is, an experience to be cherished. (Watching vlogs sitting at a corner won't fetch you that!) Its okay to just dribble around... #onelife #nottravelgoals #unsocialmedia\n\nDay 37 of my workcation in Bali for 2 months. Saturday 24th of February. It was a quiet day. Everybody has gone for the weekend. So I am on my own. I did my social media post and went to town to get money from the ATM since I had to pay for the hotel. I watched a movie, and eventually, I swam my 80 lanes when it was dark since that is when I finally felt like swimming. I am not forcing myself to do anything when I don't like it. So, I wait until I feel that I want to. . When I was done swimming, I floated in the water for a while, which was beautiful. It was dark. Many bats flew over the pool, and I could see the stars. Water is my playground. I am ALWAYS feeling good when I AM in the water. The water in this pool has a high vibration because I energized it. Most of the time, I am aware of my thoughts, and when they don't serve me, I clear them immediately. That prevents me from feeling weary, and therefore, I feel so good, happy and blissful most of the time; therefore, so many magic and miracles happen in my life. I just created an MP3 about it. Where I explain a lot about how I create and manifest my life. How I feel blissful so much. How I create the miracles in my life. It is for those who attend the retreat, but you might also benefit. So, I will add the link here. This knowledge has changed my life so much!! After swimming, I showered and went out for a meal alone. It was a very relaxing day. How about my Goals. 1. Work and Play. Yes, I worked a little bit. But I played most of the day doing what I felt like doing. 2. Meeting new people. No, I did not today, nor did I feel the need for it. 3. Working on my spirituality. Today, I worked on the spirituality of my clients for the retreat. I've created the MP3 with all the information, energy, and vibration I've added. 4. Knowing what to do when I get back home. I put it back on the list because I must also start doing things for that. I am moving to the south when I return home, becoming the manager of a water sports centre. I look forward to it. It is a 2.30-hour drive away from where I live. I will go and live near the water in a caravan. That is precisely what I visualized myself doing when I got home. I can swim every day. I live in nature, which makes me extremely happy. And I have no travel time to go to work. I am doing work I am good at, and I can work on my water healing. I will rent out my house for the time being. I contacted a friend who rents out houses for expats in the Rotterdam region and what to do to get my house ready. We made an appointment for a photoshoot 3 days after I got home. I have to find a caravan to live in with a big tent. I am still determining where that will come from. But as with everything else in my life, it will appear soon. What an exciting time ahead. I stay away from overwhelm. I praise myself for being lucky with such an extensive network of professionals. https://lnkd.in/evpvgqkd\n\nIt's been 544 days since I left my agency job in London and moved to Bali. Here are 5 mindset shifts that made me live a happier life: 1. Prioritize Wellbeing Six cheeky pints on a Friday and a late-night kebab. This was my life in London. Three things that have made me feel 18 again: • less processed foods • 14-hour fasts • 8 hours of sleep every night 2. Embrace a Slower Pace In London, the relentless push for productivity made relaxation seem like a luxury I couldn't afford. Living in Bali, I've learned the true value of slowing down. Planning rest days ahead of work days isn't just refreshing. It absolutely has enhanced my productivity. 3. Value Community Over Competition Competing relentlessly in London was exhausting. Bali taught me the power of community. It shifted my focus from competing to sharing and supporting, enriching my personal and professional life. 4. Adapt to Simplicity London felt like: more money, more status, more everything. Bali has shown me the contentment that comes from simplicity. I evaluated my life for excess and started by decluttering. Less stuff, less stress and more appreciation for the little things. Less truly can be more. 5. Reconnect with Nature The concrete jungle wasn't for me. In Bali, activities like surfing have connected me deeply with nature. Serving as a form of meditation. Integrating nature into your daily routine, whether through weekly hikes, gardening, or morning walks, is a must. Don't get me wrong, I still miss my London friends and old colleagues, and all the crazy shenanigans, however, being closer to nature has helped me lead a much happier life. Would you move to Bali?\n\nHow can you work while travelling? This is the most common questions people ask me. And the answer is? F O C U S Easy right? But it’s not exactly like this! Let me explain you why. When you travel you: • want to explore and visit the new place - of course you do! You’ve got so many pins on Google Maps or saved IG posts of the top things not be missed • go out for breakfast, lunch and dinner - sure thing! You’ve seen so many nice coffee places, bars and restaurants that it feels you have to try them all or you’ll miss something • meet and connect with the local community, join all the events and networking opportunities as you may find new amazing and inspiring people to build a relationship with Everything sounds great! However, most of the time, after few weeks (if not even days!), if you have to work, you’ll be exhausted. Result? You’ll be: -> always tired -> less productive -> more frustrated But there’s of course an healthy way of doing it. In the past years I’ve been travelling a lot and the only way to really enjoy it and not loosing yourself is: having clear what your priorities in your daily life are. Once those are set, keeping the focus will be easy and everything will flow. This is me, practicing yoga because for me, having my mind calm and focused is the priority number 1🙏🏼 🧘🏻♀️\n\nJust returned from an unforgettable trip to Goa, and wow, what an impact it has had on my perspective towards life and work! Staying in a beach hostel during the monsoon season, surrounded by the rhythmic sound of the rain and the vibrant energy of the place, was truly transformative. Balancing work and travel in such a serene environment opened my eyes to new possibilities. But it wasn't just the stunning rain-soaked landscapes and the laid-back vibes that made this trip special. It was the incredible people I met along the way. From fellow digital nomads with fascinating stories to locals who welcomed me with open arms, each interaction added a new layer to my understanding of the world. Here are a few takeaways: 1. Embrace Diversity: Meeting people from different cultures and backgrounds reminded me of the beauty of diversity. Each conversation was a lesson in empathy and understanding, enriching my professional and personal life. 2. Live in the Moment: The Goan lifestyle taught me to slow down and appreciate the present. Whether it was a spontaneous beach bonfire, a walk in the rain, or enjoying the rain with a cup of chai, I learned the importance of savoring each moment, which translated into a more mindful approach to my work. 3. Find Joy in Simple Things: Watching the rain-drenched scenery, feeling the sand between my toes, or sharing a meal with new friends – these simple pleasures brought immense joy and fulfillment, reminding me to find balance and happiness in the little things. 4. Step Out of Your Comfort Zone: Trying new activities and exploring unfamiliar places pushed me beyond my comfort zone, fostering growth and resilience. This mindset has already started to influence my approach to challenges at work. 5. Community is Everything: The sense of community in the hostel was heartwarming. Strangers became friends, and those friendships turned into unforgettable memories. Building a supportive network is just as important in the professional realm. This trip to Goa wasn't just a vacation; it was a journey of self-discovery and a reminder of the magic that happens when you open yourself up to new experiences. Feeling grateful, inspired, and ready to bring this newfound perspective into my daily life and work.\n\n#TravelLearningsWithKishan !! #Focus, #Patience, #Determination and #Love! Are you a #CorporateEmployee but your soul is wanting to #travel? Then this post is for you. Take the #Solotrip you have been postponing since quite some time now, because Solo Traveling is the best teacher for Corporate Lessons, Life Lessons and is purely for the Soul. I have seen companies spending so much of monies on training their employees with different workshops just so that the employees learn a certain things which would help the company achieve their goals. Let me tell you, I have been learning them just by Travelling Solo. This post is about one of my #TravelLearnings ❤️ Glad you are reading this ✨ If you are a #Trekker, You must have seen such stones placed on the way during your #treks in the #mountains. Most of the times, the stones are differently shaped, differently weighed and most importantly do not match each other. They represent #people and #situations in our #life. Different at different times, never the same, sometimes conflicting and sometimes impossible to deal with!! This small thing teaches me a big lesson. Whenever I go trekking in the #Himalayas, I make sure to do this every time. I sit in a silent place, free up my mind from everything, search for the most differently shaped and weighed stones, an uneven surface and start creating a #Cairn. This is a form of #meditation for me. I channelize Love, Dedication, Focus and with Right intentions, try to balance the stones one above the other, no matter whatever is the shape, weight, and it becomes a properly structured and a beautifully balanced Cairn in sometime. Like Corporate life, Patience is what it demands!! These stones represent people and situations in our life. Always different, filled with challenges which look impossible at first, but if we try to solve them, we get a #solution.. If we treat life like this Cairn, and try to balance it, we can achieve a balanced life with #happiness and #positive energies!! #Nature teaches us everything. All we need is right intensions and the will to #learn from it. I don't generally post my travel content on Linkedin since I believe in keeping my profession and passion different on different platforms. But this one, I had to post. And there is a reason to it. I have been learning about so many things while traveling. This post is about one of them. If you like it, I shall post more such Travel learnings. Because, #Linkedin also works on the simple lessons of Demand & Supply 🌻 #Travel #learnings #Lessons #Mountains #Corporate #Training #Solotravel"
