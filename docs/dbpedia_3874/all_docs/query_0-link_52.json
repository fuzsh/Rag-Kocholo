The Charities Collection contains annual reports, pamphlets, and sermons of private charities, public welfare agencies, and hospitals in Boston, throughout Massachusetts and the eastern United States, and England, from the 1790s to ca. 1950. The SSW maintained this distinct collection in their library. As a result, the Charities Collection is important not only for its content, but also as a piece of history reflecting the social work curriculum at SSW during the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThis Collection rovides a unique window into the operations and management of social welfare organizations. In many cases, these materials are not duplicated elsewhere.
