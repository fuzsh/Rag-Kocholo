        "text": "INTERIM REPORT OPS - 3 CDO BDE NOV 1944 - JAN 1945\n\nAuthor: Major D.B. Drysdale, BM, 3 Cdo Bde [view].\n\nCopy of original document supplied by: John Mewett\n\nTranscribed by: Jennie Barlow\n\n1. MAYU PENINSULA\n\nOn 9 Nov. a small Bde HQ, 1 and 42 Cdos came under comd 25 Ind Div and took over a sec of the line SOUTH of MAUNGDAW. Extensive patrolling ops were carried out, details of which have already been forwarded in \"Local News Bulletins\". During this period two raids of a tp str were also carried out. One on ELIZABETH ISLAND by 42 (RM) Cdo and one on RAMREE by 5 Cdo. Eight recce raids were also planned by the Bde and carried out by the SBS who were under comd at the time.\n\nAs a result of these ops the following ranks in the Bde were decorated:\n\n92411 Capt. John GARNER-JONES, WELCH, 1 Cdo awarded MC [view]\n\n5884633 Gnr. E.W. RABBITT, RA(S/L), 1 Cdo awarded MM [view]\n\n3133581 L/Sgt J. CROWE, SEAFORTHS, 1 Cdo awarded MM [view]\n\n6286823 Pte L.C.R. OLVER, BUFFS, 1 Cdo awarded MM [view]\n\nEx 3182 Cpl ALBERT SMITH, 42 Cdo awarded Certificate of Gallantry [view]\n\nCh/X 1885 Cpl Robert COX, 42 Cdo awarded Certificate of Gallantry [view]\n\nOn 13 Dec the Bde was again conc at TEKNAF and came under comd 26 Ind Div to start trg for the assault on AKYAB which was, at that time, planned to take place on 19 Feb.\n\n2. AKYAB\n\nBy the middle of Dec it became apparent that the enemy were withdrawing rapidly. By 29 Dec 74 Bde of 25 Div had reach FOUL PT. On 29 Dec the Bde Comd was ordered to report to HQ 15 Ind Corps. It was now almost certain that AKYAB Island itself was only lightly held and, acting on this infm, the Corps Comd decided to attack as soon as possible. The plan was for 3 Cdo Bde to be placed under comd 25 Div and carry out the assault on the Northern beaches of the island followed up immediately by 74 Bde which would be ferried across from FOUL PT in ldg craft returning from the assault. D Day was fixed as 3 Jan H Hr 1230 hrs. The op was to be mounted from TEKNAF. This allowed four days for planning and mounting! Early on the morning of 3 Jan when the force was at sea, a message was recieved stating that the bombardment had been cancelled as the natives had reported that the enemy had evac the island. This was confirmed by an RAF recce plane which landed on the airfield.\n\nApart from this the ldg was carried out according to plan. No mines or booby traps were encountered and the Bde advanced inland and occupied all objectives by nightfall. 3 Tp RM Engr Cdo did very good work on the beaches acting in the capacity of a skeleton Beach Gp.\n\nThe following morning 74 Bde passed through and occupied AKYAB town.\n\nOn 6 Jan the Bde concentrated in the area of the town. From there small recce patrols were sent in LCAs to the BARONGA ISLANDS and to the area of PAUKTAW. It was here that a patrol from 5 Cdo surprised a small party of the enemy and killed one offr and three OR without loss to themselves.\n\n3. MYEBON\n\nA recce of the area was carried out on the early morning of 10 Jan by a party in an ML. This party was fired on by an enemy gun in the area of the beach. It also disclosed a beach obstacle in the shape of a line of thick coconut stakes about 300 yds from the shore and just above low water mark. In the light of this infm it was decided to send in a COPP party on the night D - 1/D Day to place delayed action charges on the stakes timed to go off just before H Hr.\n\n12 Jan\n\nThe COPP party returned on board the parent ship in the early hrs of the morning having successfully placed their charges. The preliminary naval and air bombardment went according to plan and appeared to be very effective, and the demolition charges succeeded in blowing a 25 yd gap in the stakes, As the first wave of ldg craft approached the beach they were met by desultory and, on the whole, ineffective arty fire. 42 (RM) Cdo landed on time under cover of an air smoke screen. The beach was found to be muddy below high water mark which made ldg difficult. Cas were also suffered from anti personnel mines which had been laid on the firm sand above the high water mark. This was the first time the beach mines had been encountered in this theatre. However, the unit pushed on and the first objectives and beach head area were quickly secured with little opposition. The tks then attempted to land but the first one out of the craft got hopelessly bogged and the attempt was abandoned. 5 Cdo then landed and passed through 42 Cdo. They met little opposition until they reached the ROSE feature where they were held up by hy MG and also to send a search party to DOG Island where there was a suspected enemy gun posn. A suspicion which eventually proved to be unfounded. As it was now almost low tide it was decided to direct 44 Cdo to DOG Beach where ldg was easier. However, due to a misunderstanding, this did not occur. As a result the unit had to struggle ashore for a distance of 300 yds through waist deep mud. This took them 3 hrs and neither men nor weapons were in a fighting state by the time they reached the beach. It was then decided to try and land the tks on BAKER Beach, but this attempt was met by shell fire and only one tk succeeded in getting ashore. The LCTs were then directed to EASY Beach. Here the tks were able to get ashore but could not get round the pt on to CHARLIE RED until a rd had been cleared through the boulders by the Engr Tp. By this time it was apparent that no further adv could be made until ROSE feature had been captured and that this would involve a full scale attack. It was too late to lay it on that day therefore disposns as shown on the map att were taken up for the night and plans were made for an attack by 5 Cdo supported by tks to take place the next morning. The attack was to be proceeded by an air strike and naval bombardment.\n\n13 Jan\n\nThe air strike and bombardment on ROSE went according to plan and at 0830 hrs 5 Cdo supported by a squadron of 19 L attacked the feature. The attack was speedily successful and many enemy dead were found. At 1100 hrs 42 Cdo were ordered to pass through 5 Cdo and, supported by tks, to capture MYEBON and CABBAGE feature. 1 Cdo were ordered to move on ONION. 44 Cdo were relieved in the beach head area by a bn from 74 Bde and were moved up to the foot of ROSE and held in res. 42 Cdo cleared MYEBON village with little trouble but bumped by enemy opposition on CABBAGE. An attack was put in which was eventually successful although cas were suffered, incl the CO. [view]. In the meantime 1 Cdo had succeeded in capturing ONION where they met little opposition. 44 Cdo were then moved up to the area of MYEBON in direct sp of 42 Cdo and disposns for the night were adopted.\n\n14 Jan\n\n1 Cdo were ordered to patrol fwd as far as BASS and WORTHINGTON. No opposition was met and by 1100 hrs they were established on WORTHINGTON. 42 Cdo patrolled as far as WHISKY where they came under hy and accurate MMG fire from the area of Pt 200. It was now apparent that the features stretching from BUGLE to Pt 200 were strongly held and that their capture would involve a Bde attack with full sp. Consequently 5 and 44 Cdos were order to move fwd and concentrate in the area of ONION preparatory to a Bde attack on the following day.\n\n15 Jan\n\nThe plan for the attack was planned to take place in three phases:\n\n(a) The capture of Pt 200 by 1 Cdo.\n\n(b) The capture of Pt 163 by 44 Cdo passing through 1 Cdo.\n\n(c) The capture of BUGLE by 5 Cdo passing through 44 Cdo.\n\n42 Cdo to remain in res.\n\nThe attack was to be preceded by air and naval bombardment of all features. The air bombardment failed to materialise but the attack went in according to plan. 1 Cdo met some determined resistance on Pt 200 but after some sharp fighting, supported by tks, the feature was secured.\n\n44 Cdo then passed through and secured Pt 163 without opposition.\n\nDuring this time the tks had worked fwd to the WEST of BUGLE and were engaging enemy gun and MG posns on the feature. Three tks got within 30 yds of the KANTHA Chaung where they inflicted hy cas on a party of the enemy who were trying to withdraw NORTH. Unfortunately one of those got bogged and it was decided to send a tp from 42 Cdo wide round the left flank to attempt to reach it and protect its rec. Unfortunately this tp came under hy MG fire while crossing the open paddy and was unable to reach its objective. The tk was not recovered until after dark when BUGLE was finally captured.\n\nIn the meantime 5 Cdo had assaulted BUGLE where by inf and MG opposition was met and overcome. By nightfall BUGLE was in our hands and 5 & 42 Cdos consolidated on the feature.\n\n16 Jan\n\nPatrols from 1, 5 and 44 Cdo were pushed fwd to the line of the KANTHA Chaung. A few enemy stragglers were mopped up and much material was captured.\n\nDuring the course of the day a bn from 74 Bde passed through and formed a br head across the chaung. This unit was followed by the Engr Tp whose task was to rebuild the br at KANTHA. This they succeeded in doing although under shell fire. The Bde was now given the task of holding the line of the KANTHA Chaung while 74 Bde passed through and exploited northwards.\n\n18 Jan\n\nPatrols from 1 Cdo were sent to BRANDY Island and from 44 Cdo to the high ground to the EAST overlooking the MYEBON River. In each case the areas were reported clear.\n\n20 Jan\n\nThe Bde concentrated in the beach area preparatory to embarking for the KANGAW op.\n\n4. KANGAW\n\nCOPP recces were carried out on the nights of 19/20 and 20/21 Jan to find suitable beaches and release posns. On the night 21 Jan the Bde embarked.\n\n22 Jan\n\nThe force sailed for DAINGBON Chaung and landed according to plan. No enemy opposition was met in the beach area although there was some shelling of the chaung to the SOUTH of the beaches. This caused no cas to craft or personnel.\n\n1 Cdo advanced inland and reported HOVE clear without opposition. They were then ordered to press on to BRIGHTON - here they succeeded in clearing the whole of the SOUTHERN end of the feature but were held up by a small pocket of enemy established on the extreme NORTH tip. 5 Cdo was then ordered to follow up behind 1 Cdo and consolidate on BRIGHTON. 42 Cdo were ordered to hold HOVE and a posn on the WEST bank of the DAINGBON Chaung. 44 Cdo moved up to the WEST of BRIGHTON preparatory to carrying out a night attack on MILFORD. This attack was put in at 1930 hrs and met no opposition. During the night the enemy on the NORTH tip of BRIGHTON counter attacked 1 Cdo fiercely and hand to hand fighting ensued.\n\n23 Jan\n\nAt first light 1 Cdo put in an attack, with arty sp, and cleared the end of the feature. 44 Cdo were then ordered fwd to PINNER. During the day the 8 HYDERABADS landed and took over def of the beach area, relieving 42 Cdo who were then moved fwd on to MILFORD. There was intermittent enemy shelling of the beach head area during the day. Attempts were made to land the tks but these proved unsuccessful due to the boggy nature of the ground. 44 Cdo sent a patrol to DUNS. They reported that there was a small enemy post just to the NORTH of the feature. During the night the enemy launched a strong counter attack, with hy arty sp, on PINNER. The attack was finally beaten off although 44 Cdo suffered hy cas from tree bursts.\n\n24 Jan\n\nIt was decided to withdraw 44 Cdo to the WEST of BRIGHTON and relieve them by two coys of HYDERABADS. Enemy shelling of BRIGHTON, the beach head and L of C increased during the day. A recce was made of the approaches to FINGERS, with the object of establishing a standing patrol in that area. This drew hy small arms and arty fire and it was decided that the capture of the feature would involve a major op.\n\nDuring the day the Bde received orders to consolidate and not to attempt any further adv.\n\nDuring the night 1 Cdo sent a patrol to BERWICK which reported NES.\n\n25 Jan\n\nAt dawn it became apparent that the enemy had brought up further arty and a hy conc was put down on the BRIGHTON feature. At one period 182 shells landed in the space of half an hr. Harassing fire of this nature continued throughout the day.\n\n26 Jan\n\n51 Bde landed and took over MILFORD and PINNER. 42 Cdo were withdrawn to the beach head area. Two tps of 44 Cdo were moved over to the WEST bank of the DAINGBON Chaung to relieve the HYDERABADS. During the course of the day three tanks were landed and moved to the WEST slope of BRIGHTON. They were unable to get any further fwd than this due to the marshy nature of the ground. Enemy harassing fire continued throughout the day.\n\n27 Jan\n\n44 Cdo started a series of patrols to try and locate parties of enemy stragglers reported to be in the DAINGBON area. During the course of these ops they located and destroyed two abandoned enemy guns but failed to make contact with any stragglers.\n\n28 Jan\n\n5 Cdo came under comd 51 Bde as res and moved up to PINNER at 0800 hrs. Two tps of 42 Cdo relieved 5 Cdo on BRIGHTON. During the morning 51 Bde put in an attack on PERTH and MELROSE. This was preceded by a very hy air strike. The attack on PERTH was held up by a strong enemy resistance on DUNS. It was finally abandoned. The attack on MELROSE was partially successful and by nightfall three quarters of the feature was in our hands. 5 Cdo were not committed and returned to BRIGHTON at dusk.\n\n29 Jan\n\n5 Cdo again moved up to PINNER under comd 51 Bde. The two tps from 42 Cdo had remained in the area of BRIGHTON. Attacks on MELROSE continued and BERWICK was secured. Enemy shelling continued throughout the day although on a much reduced scale. During the night 5 Cdo set an ambush across the rd and patrolled into the village of KANGAW. No enemy were seen and the rd appeared to have been unused by wheeled vehs for at least 4 days.\n\n30 Jan\n\nThe Bde had orders to withdraw and arrangements were made to start thinning out on the following day. The PUNJABS were due to arrive on 31 Jan and were to take over BRIGHTON feature. 5 Cdo remained on PINNER under comd 51 Bde.\n\n31 Jan\n\nAt 0600 hrs a hy enemy arty concentration was put down on BRIGHTON. At 0620 a determined attack was made on the NORTH end of the feature. The enemy's immediate object appeared to be the destruction of the tks harbouring in that area. By sheer weight of numbers a party of the enemy succeeded in reaching the tks and destroyed one and damaged another. 5 Cdo returned from PINNER about 1400 hrs and the PUNJABS arrived at 1700 hrs.

Jap started shelling area NORTH BRIGHTON (514497) heavily until 0605 hours.\n\n0610 hrs. Green verey light fired NW of BRIGHTON which was taken to be 42 RM Cdo recognition signal. .\n\n0615 hrs. Intense M.G. fire and grenade discharger shells on 4 Tp posn. possibly mortars as well. Lt. Semple, O.C. 4 Tp. had ordered 'Stand to' and now gave instructions that fire was to be held until targets could be clearly seen.\n\n0630 hrs. Enemy had apparently some old Bren gun pits of 12 Tp 1 Cdo on extreme N slope of BRIGHTON. With intense M.G. fire an attack was launched on 4 Tp posn from N. This attack was beaten off by forward P1 of 4 Tp Comd. Lt. Knowland. A number of casualties was suffered and Lt. Knowland asked for more amn and men. These were then sent up from the rear P1 (Lt. Wight). Lt. Semple went forward to see the situation for himself. Enemy next heard digging vigorously on extreme N slope of BRIGHTON, and 4Tp was then subject to MMG fire which, it was estimated came from W.finger (512505).\n\nThereafter the enemy made repeated attacks in mass on N. BRIGHTON. These were again and again beaten off and heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy.\n\nAn attempt was made to assault the W flank of 4 Tp but this too was beaten off successfully.\n\n0830 hrs. 4 Tp was by now suffering a number of casualties, and was running low and there were scarcely any grenades left. Lt. Semple asked for help.\n\nThe forward Sect was partly over-run and fought on until every man was either killed or wounded. Lt. Knowland [view] who was with the forward Sect was last seen firing the 2 inch mortar from the hip at point blank range at the oncoming enemy. The F.O.O. who was also forward with his party was badly wounded and subsequently died, and his wireless set put out of action. One of his gunners was also wounded in the legs but insisted on staying. He was found next day still alive though his trench had been occupied by Japs.\n\nFire orders for Arty were subsequently relayed by voice control to the Tp HQ set.\n\n(b) P1 (W(Tp 42 RM Cdo and P1 3 Tp 1 Cdo counter-attack\n\n0930 hrs. C.O. arrived in 4 Tpposn.\n\nP1. of (W)Tp 42 RM Cdo arrived to help 4 Tp 1 Cdo, one Sect of 5 Tp 1 Cdo under L/Sgt. Perry came up to thicken up the posns vacated by (W)Tp 42 RM Cdo and protect the E. flank of 4 Tp which was subject to heavy and accurate sniping by the enemy. Tanks were asked to protect the left flank against infiltration by the enemy.\n\nThe Sect of 5 Tp remained in posn all day until relieved by 5 Cdo in the evening, accounting during its stay for a party of six Japs and one MMG. Gnr. Baker of this Sect. after killing two Jap snipers was himself killed.\n\nP1. (W) Tp. 42 RM Cdo with Capt. Smith, who readily placed himself under command of Lt. Semple, then took over some of 4 Tps posns with one Sect, where there had been casualties. The remaining two Sections under Capt. Smith were ordered to clear the slope W. and N. of enemy. After moving about 20 yards along the slope the party which was 12 strong came under MMG fire and suffered 6 casualties. Capt. Smith decided to withdraw and reported to Lt. Semple. It was agreed then that the remainder of P1. (W)Tp should occupy some of 4 Tps posns on the NW and to stay and hold the posn.\n\nAt the same time as 42 RM Cdos counter-attack on the W. flank No. 1 P1 of 3 Tp (Lt. Crewe) had arrived and was ordered by Lt. Semple to clear the E. slope of the posn. Lt.\n\nCrewe and two sections moved across the E. slope leaving P1. HQ and the third Sect. under command of Sgt. Lander to reinforce 4 Tps E. flank and shoot N. along the crest. The attacking Sects. moved with L/Sgt. Sincup's Sect. leading in extended order on the slope, and Cpl. Edman's Sect. behind. Lt. Crewe was on the left of Sgt. Sincup's Sect.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill L/Bdr. Toft saw 4 Japs in trenches, and the Sect. advanced after Sgt. Sincup [view] had thrown a grenade and killed 3 Japs. 7 Japs then bolted from a dug-out and 6 of them were killed, the seventh running away into some bushes in the paddy. Cpl. Hobbs was then shot in the jaw and went back alone. Lt. Crewe came down the hill to Sgt. Sincup and said he had been wounded in the leg. The P1 continued to advance over the bodies of the dead Japs and in one trench two made up demolition charges each of about 7 to 10 lbs. together with a Jap sword were seen. After advancing about another 30 yards the Sect. came under M.G. fire and grenades were thrown down on them from the top of the hill. Lt. Crewe was hit in the foot and Sgt. Sincup took over the two Sects. At this stage Gnr Beaney who had gone off to contact Sgt.Lander was wounded.\n\nAs the P1 was suffering casualties Sgt.Sincup decided to draw back until he was in line with the remainder of the force on top of the hill. On the way back Gnr.Beaney was found wounded. Attempts to rescue him were unsuccessful as he was covered by snipers. The Sects then took up posns protecting the E. flank of 4 Tp where they remained until evening when they were ordered by the C.O. to come under comd of Capt. Evill.\n\nImmediately after the counter-attack by (W(Tp and 3 Tp the C.O. after discussing the situation with Lt. Semple went back to report to the Brig.\n\n1015 hrs. The Brig came fwd with the C.O. and saw the situation. It was decided to clear the feature with a (Blitz) counter-attack by (X)Tp 42 RM Cdo. This was to take place at 1230 hrs. supported on the left flank by one tank of 19 L. Capt. Smith of (W)Tp was ordered to go in the tank to direct the shooting on to the NW. slope.\n\nThe C.O. remained fwd.\n\nFrom now on the enemy continued to attack furiously but with little success, though the posn was subject to further intense and accurate grenade discharger fire. The situation was kept well in hand and by now then amn was arriving steadily and the evacuation of casualties continued throughout.\n\nThe first amn party to arrive came from 5 Tp 1 Cdo, who also helped to prime grenades, fill magazines, and distribute amn forward.\n\nPHASE II\n\n(c) (X)Tp 42 RM Cdo counter-attack.\n\n1230 hrs. The counter-attack went in as planned (see Appendix 1 for detailed orders). Very heavy casualties were suffered by the leading P1 from intense MMG fire (the enemy now had three MMG on the ridge). The second P1 which was to have gone through was pinned by fire on top of the posn and was ordered to remain, occupying trenches where 4 Tp had suffered casualties. These Tps then remained in posn for the rest of the day until ordered withdraw by Lt. Col. Trevor.\n\n(d) 6 Tp 1 Cdo counter-attack.\n\n1300 hrs. 6 Tp comd Capt. Evill was ordered fwd from their posn to 4 Tp area where Capt. Evill was given instructions to thicken up 4 Tp posn with a view to holding the feature. However after (X)Tps counter-attack there was a brief lull in the battle and it was decided to put in an immediate counter-attack with one P1 to regain 4 Tps fwd posns.\n\n1400 hrs. Lt. Palmer now brought up his P1 and after a recce with Sec Comds the attack went round the R. flank, with two 2 inch mortars and all available Brens in support on the crest.\n\nAfter working round the E. flank for some 30 yards the leading Sect. came under intense MG fire and showers of grenades flung down from above. The P1 suffered about 50% casualties as a result of this heavy fire and the C.O. ordered it to withdraw. Lt. Palmer [view], Sgt. Morris MM [view] and Fus. Andrews [view] were then reported missing.\n\nAt this moment Lt. Larcher's P1 (6 Tp) arrived. They were ordered to send all Bren teams fwd to thicken up 4 Tp posns and replace casualties, the remainder maning posns in 4 Tp area on the E. Flank. Several men helped to evacuate casualties and with the amn supply. As men in the fwd posns became casualties so others were called fwd to take their place on the Bren guns. 6 Tp remained in posn until finally relieved by 5 Cdo.\n\nDuring this time the call for amn and grenades from the fwd posns put a constant strain on the resources. The filling of mags, priming of grenades and the distribution of all types of amn was very smoothly and efficiently organised by Lt. Wight, Lt. Larcher and Sgt. Evans. Together they kept a constant stream of all types of ammunition going forward, and handled the constant trickle of casualties who were coming back\n\n1500 hrs. The Brigadier ordered that no further counter-attacks were to take place before nightfall, and every effort was to be made to hold the position as it was. Col. Trevor asked Bde for reinforcements.\n\nPHASE III\n\n(e) The arrival of 4 Troop and 1 Troop 5 Commando.\n\n1530 hrs. Lt. Col. Pollitt, MC [view] Comd 5 Commando and Capt. Burr Comd 4 Troop 5 Commando came forward with 4 Troop 5 Commando to see Col. Trevor. Col. Trevor asked to have this Troop made available as close as possible for immediate action.\n\nBren Groups of 4 Troop (5 Commando) were sent forward to reinforce the front of 4 Troop 1 Commando. The remainder of the Troop was employed in carrying casualties and ammunition. Sgt. Flatley and 6 men of 4 Troop 5 Commando were sent forward on the EAST slope to deal with enemy snipers who were active on the flank. Casualties were inflicted on the enemy.\n\n1 Troop 5 Commando moving up behind 4 Troop 5 Commando was ordered by the Brigadier to send one platoon onto the EAST spur on the flank of 4 Troop 5 Commando. The other Platoon of 1 Troop 5 Commando was engaged at the foot of the EAST slope, where further casualties were inflicted on the enemy.\n\n1630 hrs. Col. Pollitt was wounded when returning from 4 Troop 1 Commando position.\n\n(f) Dispositions for night 31 Jan/1 Feb 45.\n\n1700 hrs. Major Stuart 5 Commando who had taken over from Col. Pollitt came forward to see Col. Trevor, and received orders to (box) 4 Troop (5 Commando) on the EAST flank of 4 Troop (1 Commando). 4 Troop 5 Commando then commenced digging in.\n\nAt this stage the enemy's furious attacks had ceased and only a few snipers remained active. Col. Trevor then set about re-organising the elements of 3, 4 & 6 Troop (1 Commando) who were still in that area. The personnel of (X) and (W) Troops 42 Commando were withdrawn under command of Capt. Smith and ordered by Col. Trevor to report to Major Davies 1 Commando. The Section of 5 Troop 1 Commando was relieved by 1 Troop 5 Commando and rejoined its Troop.\n\nThe composite force of 3, 4 & 6 Troops 1 Commando which occupied 4 Troop's position came under command of Col. Trevor himself, and the Brigadier ordered that the position should be thus held during the night.\n\nCol. Trevor then handed over temporarily to Capt. Evill and left the position to find the Brigadier.\n\nPHASE IV\n\n(g) Relief of 1 Commando forward Troops by 2 Troop 5 Commando.\n\n1830 hrs. Col. P. Young, DSC, MC [view] came forward to see the position, when he met Col. Trevor [view] who was on his way back. After holding a conference with Col. Trevor and Major Stuart, the latter readily agreed to bring up a fresh Troop to relieve 1 Commando who had had no rest that day.\n\n1945 hrs. 2 Troop 5 Commando Comd Capt. Beard arrived to relieve 1 Commando forward Troops, who were withdrawn to old positions for the night. The responsibility for the defence of NORTH BRIGHTON then passed to 5 Commando.\n\nAPPENDIX 1\n\nORDERS FOR COUNTER ATTACK OF (X( TROOP 42 COMMANDO\n\nAT 1230 HOURS 31ST JANUARY 45\n\nby Lt. Colonel K.R.S. Trevor, Commanding, No. 1 Commando\n\n1 Own Troops in position EAST flank ? Platoon 3 Troop 1 Commando centre ? 4 Troop 1 Commando\n\nWEST flank ? Platoon (W) Troop 42 Commando.\n\n2 Intention. To clear NORTH BRIGHTON of enemy.\n\n3 (X) Troop 42 Commando Comd Capt.

Smith.\n\n6 All Brens to move forward to 4 Troop 1 Commando to fire on the following programme:\n\nH ? 5 to H ? 2 slow rate\n\nH ? 2 to H rapid\n\n7 Start Line ? Rear of 4 Troop 1 Commando positions.\n\n8 H hour 1230 hrs.\n\nAPPENDIX 2\n\nACCOUNT OF AMMUNITION SUPPLIES ON 31ST JANUARY 1945\n\nAt approx 0830 hrs. 4 Troop 1 Commando asked for ammunition of all types. 5 Troop 1 Commando sent forward their reserves of grenades and other types.\n\nAt approx 0945 hrs. mortar platoon asked for more H.E. as they had already expended 80 bombs. Cpl. Young Mortar Platoon with a small party of men made three attempts to reach the bomb dump but this was under enemy machine gun fire and they were driven back. In the last attempt Cpl. Young [view] was hit and subsequently died of his wounds. Pte.Boyes attempted to reach Cpl. Young but was unable to do so owing to the heavy fire. It was impossible to get ammunition from this source to the 3\" mortars.\n\nAt approx 1100 hours. ammunition of all types was again called for. The only personnel available to carry ammunition to the forward Troops were No. 1 Platoon of 12 Troop 1 Commando. This was a dangerous mission as the ammunition party was continuously under fire enemy snipers.\n\nIt is impossible to assess the ammunition expenditure but some idea of the amount can be judged by the fact that each Troop had a reserve of 3,000 rounds 303, 1,000 rounds 300, 2,000 45 and 72 36 grenades and by 1200 hrs. the Brigade dump was unable to continue the supply of types required.\n\nFortunately RSM Powell was able to contact Capt. Gardner 1 Commando A.O. who immediately set about the task of ferrying ammunition from the beach. This ammunition arrived in time to supply the forward troops with everything they required. The supply was effectively maintained by the untiring efforts of 12 Troop 1 Commando who not only carried forward the ammunition but evacuated casualties on the return journey when there were not sufficient stretcher bearers available. It must here be mentioned that only 6 ORs of 12 Troop could be used at any one time as their position still had to be manned.\n\nAt 1500 hrs. as the ammunition party was busy evacuating casualties to the M.D.S. it was found necessary to get more men to carry ammunition. RSM Powell contacted a party of Indian Engineers who willingly supplied 12I ORs as ammunition carriers.\n\nTowards evening the men from 12 Troop who had been working all day then volunteered to take as much water as they could carry to the forward Troops, in addition to the normal ammunition supplies.\n\nAt no time were the forward troops desperately short of ammunition.\n\nAPPENDIX 3\n\nACCOUNT OF MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS ON HILL 170 ? JANUARY 1945\n\nAt about 0700 hrs. 1 Commando R.A.P. moved to 4 Troop 1 Commando H.Q. and there treated some 15 casualties which had occurred during the enemy's initial assault. They were evacuated satisfactorily by Indian stretcher bearers.\n\nThe R.A.P. stayed in this area until 1030 hrs. when Troops moving in and the intensity of the enemy's fire made it necessary to clear all wounded from the position as rapidly as possible. The R.A.P. therefore withdrew to the area of 42 Commando H.Q., leaving the Medical Sgt. forward who supervised essential first aid.\n\nHowever at 1200 hrs. as casualties were increasing in number and as the M.D.S. was close at hand, the R.A.P. moved forward again to the saddle at the rear of 4 Troop 1 Commando. Here it was able to supervise essential first aid and to organise evacuation from 4 Troop in front, and the Troops on the flanks. From 1200 hrs. to 1500 hrs. during the counter attacks put in by 42 Commando and 6 Troop 1 Commando, 42 Commando came up to augment 1 Commando R.A.P., assisting at the time of the intensest flow of casualties.\n\nThe Indian bearers worked well until midday. After this time only about 4 parties were seen at the R.A.P. and most of the bearing was done by 12 Troop 1 Commando. The Indian bearers were difficult to marshal owing to the language obstacle.\n\nTroop orderlies worked forward with the defending or counter-attacking Troops and did excellent medical work under difficult conditions. Casualties in the medical section were killed 1 L/Cpl, and wounded 1 Sgt. The former had gone forward to the front trenches early in the battle and having dressed four men who were wounded manned one of the Brens but was killed when his position was overrun.\n\nAPPENDIX 4\n\n1 Arty (25 pdr& Med)\n\nTanks\n\nAircraft\n\n2 Artillery: The Arty was used throughout the day (a) to neutralise enemy supporting fire on FINGERS, (b) as harassing fire on THAMES CHAUNG. This was controlled by F.O.O. from the forward position until about 1600 hrs. when fire control was directed from MILFORD, whence whence reports had come of enemy movement across the chaung. (c) On NORTH end of BRIGHTON 300 yards in front of enemy position, later reduced to 150 yards.\n\nThe F.O.O. on BRIGHTON was seriously wounded at 0800 hrs. and his set was put out of action. His place was taken by the battery commander who sent his orders back on the Command net. The battery commander was wounded twice and his place was taken by another F.O.O. in the afternoon.\n\n3 Tanks: Of the 3 tanks on the bridgehead 1 was destroyed by enemy action at 0600 hrs. and a second partially disabled at the same time. The third took part in the action throughout the day.\n\nAt 0830 hrs. the tank was asked to give support on WEST flank of 4 Troop 1 Commando who were at that time hard pressed. At 12.30 hrs. the same tank was used to supplement the fire power for (X( Troops counter-attack. It had one periscope shot away. At 1330 hrs. the tank withdrew to replenish ammunition and POL returning at 1430 hrs. It continued to fire ME effectively with three bursts on NORTH end of BRIGHTON. Shells were ranged to burst 50 yards in front of 4 Troops 1 Commando position. This was undoubtedly extremely effective in countering Jap infiltration on the left flank.\n\n4 Aircraft: These were not used in direct support until the culminating point of the battle when a heavy strike was made by Thunderbolts at 1700 hrs on FINGER. This caused heavy casualties among the retiring enemy.\n\n5 Navy: At 0700?hrs. 1 LCA with 13 Brens went up THAMES CHAUNG to clear the banks. This was followed by an M.L. at about 1030 hrs. which opened fire on fingers and the banks of the chaung.\n\nAPPENDIX 5\n\nJAPANESE DECEPTIONS\n\nMany of the usual tricks of the enemy were employed, such as shouting names of officers and senior NCOs. Further to these during the day were:\n\n(a) Shouts of 'withdraw Commandos' and 'cease fire'.\n\n(b) Six Japanese were seen wearing Green Berets, and one dead Jap was subsequently found wearing a Green Beret.\n\n(c) Fire crackers were used to give the impression of heavier fire power.\n\n(d) Cries of 'I am wounded'. 'Help' and 'Come and get me out', etc.\n\nSource:\n\nWar Diaries of No 1 Cdo. ref. National Archives WO 203/ 1792. Transcribed with the help of John Mewett and Elaine Southworth-Davies from a copy typed on a ribbon type writer which was very hard to decipher. ***** refers to a word that could not be made out.\n\nReport by Lt. Col Peter Young on the Battle of Hill 170\n\nAt about 0545 hrs. I was in my dugout on the reverse slopes of 170.\n\nThe Japanese indulged in a fairly prolonged barrage which didn’t compare to badly with a Bosche effort. This was followed by musketry from the N end of 170. I got up and got dressed and went along to see Lt Col Trevor and found him in his HQ. It was daylight when we arrived. On the way I told various sections I passed what information I had gathered from Bde.HQ. This was to the effect that a party of about 20 Japs had rushed our 3 tanks that one was believed to have been set on fire, and that 4 troop of No1 commando was surrounded by snipers but the situation was well in hand.\n\nI found Lt Col Trevor and some of his HQ sniping at a diversion party down in the bushes and paddy in rear of his HQ. I borrowed a Garand rifle and both Cpl Christopher and myself had a few pot shots with no obvious results, but Col Trevor knocked one over and so did some of his signallers. An officer and three other Japs were found later in the target area. Capt. Cotton of 42 Cdo rushed out and got his sword. He was shortly afterwards wounded in the thigh by a shell I think.\n\nOne of the Japs down in the field was lying on his back moving his arm from time to time. We hoped to get him as a prisoner, but he killed himself with a grenade.\n\nThe Brigadier came along and so I went back to Bde and had my breakfast.\n\nLater presumably after 0930hrs I went back to see Col Trevor again. By this time he had gone up and joined 4 Troop. I visited him there, there was a good deal of fire at the time, but Col. Trevor didn’t seem to think there were very many Japs in front of him. As I went forward to see Col.Trevor I met Lt. Crewe being carried back along the ridge, sitting up on a stretcher. He had been wounded in the foot and leg. Capt. Smith of 42 was already with Col.Trevor by this time.\n\nI went down the gully to where the tanks had been laagered. I found that one had indeed been burnt out. There was a good many bodies about. None of them had been moved so I proceeded to inspect them. The first was an officer. He had got right inside the tank and set it on fire. About six of his men were dead behind him within 20 yards or so. They had pole charges (round charges on the end of bamboo poles). One of them had gone off prematurely and killed its owner very thoroughly. He was covered in a sort of powder the colour of mepacrine. In the paddy were four riflemen who seemed to have been giving covering fire at close quarters. One had died with his forefinger in the loop of a 36 grenade. Taking a look at the other party, we found one of them breathing. His right forearm shattered, but some SBS soon whisked to the MDS. He is still alive.\n\nDuring the morning it was reported at Bde. HQ that an ICA had destroyed a party of Japs crossing the N Chuang (Thames). I took a patrol to investigate this report. We found no bodies but saw the imprint in the mud of at least one barefooted man; found 3 clips of Jap rifle ammo in their forming up area and a Bren magazine at the point where I consider they may have landed, for it was opposite to the mouth of the contributory of the ‘Thames’. During all this time there was continuous firing on 170 and we saw several of our own troops advancing among the tree at the top of the hill. I got the impression that very little of the hill was left to the Japs.\n\nPerhaps it was my next visit to Bde. that a report came in from Col.Trevor that there were still 40 Japs at the end of the feature. The Brig.turned to Capt.Tripp, the IO and said ‘send that to division tell them there are 20 Japs at the end’.\n\nBy this time a steady stream of casualties was moving along the back of 170 to the MDS, and one marine said he saw 61 brought past during the day. While I was at 1 Cdo’s HQ on one occasion, about 1500hrs, a report arrived that the situation was critical. However reinforcements from 5 Cdo had begun to arrive from PINNER and the Brig. had ordered Lt Col Pollitt MC to take a troop forward as soon as he had arrived. 1530 Hrs Col Pollitt and Capt.Burr of 4 troop 5 Cdo arrived 1 Cdo HQ.\n\nThe next time about 1630hrs I went to see Col Trevor I met Col Pollitt being carried back on a stretcher face downwards. He had been shot through the knee. I also met Lt. Bolitho walking back, shot in the stomach being supported by one man and very angry.\n\nI met the Brigadier who ordered me to arrange for a flanking movement by a Coy of Punjabs to pin down the enemy on the west side of 170 with fire from the paddy; and for the tanks to go into action again.\n\nOnly one tank was in action by this time, but as soon as I could get hold of a platoon from 5 Cdo it advanced again. I met Major Stuart, told him Col Pollitt was hit and arranged for this support.\n\nI then found the Col of the Punjabs and arranged for two platoons guided by my servant, to go and engage the enemy from the mangrove where they themselves had originally formed up.\n\nWhen the Brig returned to his HQ he ordered me to organise the defence of the hill for the night. I went to see Col.Trevor and met him coming back at about 1630hrs, from his forward post. I had Major Stuart with me and we arranged to reinforce 1 Cdo’s forward troop with a strong fresh troop of 5Cdo and if possible to withdraw the tired troops of 1 Cdo. As it was getting dark I told Col Trevor it was unlikely that we could do more than reinforce him for the night.\n\nBy the time I got back to the area of Bde. HQ with Lt. Nias , 10 of No 1 cdo, I found that enough Punjab’s had arrived to take over from 2 troop No 5 Cdo so I sent Capt.Beard guided by Lt. Niasto report straightaway to Col Trevor. I got Capt. MacLennan the camp commandant, to show the Punjabs all the posns on the right and returned main HQ No I Cdo, where to my delight (and also surprise) I found that troops of 42 Cdo were already reinforcing the two weakly held features. We were now able to take out 1 Cdos forward Troops. I saw Col Trevor and he was satisfied that all was well. I went back to Bde. It was dark.\n\nThe next morning there was more firing. I went again to see Col Trevor and Maj Stuart; we had had four casualties in a weak attack from grenades. I found him very eager to attack and drive the enemy off the end of 170, once and for all. Since we were to hand over that day I was in favour of this.\n\nLater I heard that he had succeeded and the hill was covered with dead. I went there and saw a truly incredible scene. The Japs covered the hill almost like a carpet. They were piled onto those of our our posts which they had swamped. Our soldiers were busy collecting Brens and Jap ******* , and looking for documents and so on. Several of our own men were in the open where they had fallen in one of the many counter attacks. A lot of Japs had been killed by the shelling and mortaring. Among some bushes on the N side of 170 were 16 dead Japs and two of our own dead. Here we captured another prisoner, who had half his foot blown off and had crawled into the bushes. He wanted us to shoot him.\n\nThere was still a good deal of mopping up to be done in the chaung and in the paddy, but the battle was decided by the clearing of 170.\n\nExcept that the Japs hardly used their artillery except in the preliminary barrage –presumibly because of the lack of W/T- and their mortar practice is very poor compared to the Germans, the fighting on 170 could hardly have been more severe. I am convinced that no European troops would have attempted to hang onto their precarious foothold at the end of 170 for as long as these Japs did, in the face of all the arty , 3 “ mortar and small arms fire brought to bear on them. For 24 hrs the forward troops were within grenade range. On our side a man often became a casualty within a few minutes of taking over a Bren from another who’d been hit.\n\nHad the pimple at the end of 170, divided, as it is, from the rest of the position by a sharp re-entrant been carried, it would have been a major operation to re-take it. Above anything it was the long and stubborn resistance of 4 Troop 1 cdo and the heroism of the officer commanding the forward platoon that prevented this. According to PW reports, 500 Japs attacked the position of whom 300 were killed.\n\nMyebon 11 /Feb/45 P. Young Col D. Command 3 Cdo Brigade."
