        "text": "Who would you think was the better WW2 general?\n\nThat's a question that deserves its own thread.\n\nAmong the Americans? They had a lot of generals who were good at different things.\n\nThere were several outstanding corps and division commanders, like Ted Brooks, Alexander Vandegrift, Joe Collins, Gee Gerow, Geoffrey Keyes, and Matt Ridgway. Due to the rapid expansion of the peacetime military, the Americans took time to produce good leaders at those levels, but by 1944 they had a collection that was better than most.\n\nThe leaders of American numbered field armies were a bit more uneven in quality. Sandy Patch and Truscott were probably the best and most well-rounded. Bill Simpson and Walter Krueger were competent and steady. Hodges was an unimaginative tactician who wasted his men's lives, and probably the worst of the lot.\n\nPatton is tough to evaluate. He was an imaginative thinker who saw the operational level of war better than any other Western general. He got the most he could out of limited subordinates, like Eddy, Middleton, and Walker. He was also frequently insubordinate in destructive ways, and had trouble abandoning some of his preconceptions despite repeated failures. His actions during the breakout in France show just how superb a commander he could be; his actions during the frustrating fall campaign in Lorraine show how he easily he could slip into bad habits.\n\nAt army group, Devers was excellent. (His only drawback was not his fault: Eisenhower didn't like him, was unwilling to give him necessary support, and prevented his forces from crossing the Rhine in December 1944, shortly before the Battle of the Bulge.) Clark was often competent but rarely better than that, and sometimes worse; he fully deserved the opprobrium that came down on him for diverting an entire field army to occupy Rome for prestige purposes rather than attack retreating Wehrmacht units. Bradley was unable to think on the operational or strategic levels of war and was frequently insubordinate, but he also conceived and executed the most brilliant operation the Western Allies ever mounted during the war, COBRA. (Whether you give Bradley credit for organizing it, Collins and Brooks credit for tactical control and feel for the battle, or Patton credit for turning a breakthrough into a real exploitation, is a matter of debate.)\n\nEisenhower did his job about as well as anyone can expect him to have done. He lacked operational experience but had a strong theoretical background. More importantly, as a leader of an international military force, he kept the Western Allies mostly going in the right direction despite some incredibly trying circumstances (and subordinates). He certainly did better than MacArthur at avoiding strategic blind alleys, and he rarely, if ever, wasted lives. It is hard to imagine Ike providing a subordinate with limited resources and then ordering him to take an objective or \"not come back alive\", as MacArthur did to Bob Eichelberger during the Buna campaign.\n\nAnd then there's Marshall, who was the greatest strategist America ever produced, and arguably its greatest general.\n\nDachs, who was it who said, of his dad and meeting him when he was his father's aide in the pacific east (Japan?), \"I had never met a man more flamboyantly egotistical, until I met his son.\"?\n\nI don't know. That's a delightful quotation, though. Apparently it appears in something by William Manchester - possibly his biography of MacArthur, American Caesar.\n\nJust had a quick look at his Wiki and noted all the orders he ignored. Do you think the fall of the Philippines could have been averted if he stuck to previous plans? Would there have been relief forces available after the hold-out plan?\n\nNo. The Philippines were probably going to fall to Japan regardless. American and Filipino forces in-theater were too small in number and too low in quality. MacArthur's error was in failing to mitigate the damage. Eisenhower, who was in the War Plans Division at the time and who was responsible for overseeing the Philippines, said that MacArthur \"might have made a better showing\", but was realistic about the allies' prospects.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, no relief force was going to be able to follow War Plan Orange and steam directly to the Philippines' rescue. Even if the Pacific Fleet were intact, Navy planners thought that progress through the Marshalls, Carolines, and Marianas would probably take two years, not the six months that the Army assumed. (Naturally, the Navy failed to inform the Army of this belief.) Holing up in Bataan was not going to end well, regardless. Trying to fight the Japanese on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf was even more obviously not going to end well. Ideally, President Quezon could have declared the Philippines neutral and convinced the Americans to withdraw to forestall a Japanese invasion entirely, but it's hard to see the Americans agreeing to such a course of action and even harder to see the Japanese giving up on an invasion in such a case; they'd probably have just occupied the islands anyway.\n\nMilitarily, then, MacArthur was dealt a bad hand. He then proceeded to waste what assets he already had. Instead of facing court-martial, like Admiral Kimmel and General Short in Hawaii, MacArthur got a Medal of Honor and a starring role in the ongoing war effort.\n\nBack on Ike - I was looking for a good quote I faintly recall about Ike's greatness/glory really being in keeping Patton, Montgomery and De Gaulle all on the same side and shooting at the enemy, not each other - and found this instead:\n\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.c...0winter/Ambrose.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\n\n-Strikes me as excellent. Should it?\n\nI think Ambrose was a bit harder on Ike than he should have been over the failures in the fall of 1944. (He also misconstrued a dual-phase, dual-thrust strategy as \"broad front\", which is something Montgomery did in 1944 to make Eisenhower's ultimate course of action look less intelligent than it was. Monty's words set the terms of the discussion for the rest of time.) Eisenhower's orders were communicated clearly. He allowed the army group commanders some leeway in objective selection, but on crucial issues, like opening Antwerp, he was fairly firm. Bradley (not Patton) and Montgomery committed insubordination in pursuing their independent courses of action. In some cases (definitely Montgomery over Antwerp) this took the form of ignoring direct orders. In others, it took the form of ignoring the commander's intent.\n\nIt's unclear what Eisenhower could have done differently there. As Ambrose pointed out, he both had to try to exercise overall operational direction as well as act as a supreme commander keeping the forces of several countries moving in the same direction. One was a military job, and the other political, and they were almost impossible to reconcile. Ike did better than arguably any other supreme commander in history at the political side of his job. Necessarily, that involved suboptimal choices on the military level. Not all of his political choices were good. He was probably too friendly with Bradley to ever seriously reprimand him for his errors (let alone relieve him) and he was unquestionably too hard on Devers, whom he unreasonably saw as a rival. But it is difficult to argue with the final result.\n\nSome observers then and since credited those choices to his lack of battlefield experience. Unlike many of his fellow Western commanders, Ike spent the Great War out of the trenches, stateside and in staff positions. But he had a strong theoretical background in Clausewitz, which was clearly reflected in his directives, in SHAEF planning, and even in communications by his subordinates. And while he had no battlefield experience, he had experience as a supreme commander in the Mediterranean that he brought to the table in Western Europe.\n\nAmbrose also correctly pointed out that Ike got better at the job over time. His experience in North Africa and Sicily informed his decisions in Western Europe. He was perhaps a bit too light on the hand of his army group commanders in the fall of 1944 but eventually cracked down on them (at least, on Monty). He responded better to the crisis created by the German offensive in the Ardennes than either Bradley or Hodges, and helped lay the groundwork for defeating that offensive and successfully counterattacking.\n\nAs you can probably tell, then, I think Ambrose's overall assessment of Ike is fine, although I'd quibble with a lot of the details.\n\nAre you knowledgeable about commanders from other Allied nations?\n\nSomewhat. Bear in mind that, while my opinions about military leaders are based in fact, they are still my opinions. There are plenty of people - some of whom are very, very smart - who would disagree with me about them.\n\nI'm also going to spoil the comments because they're so extensive.\n\nSpoiler :\n\nThe British and Commonwealth armies produced some excellent officers.\n\nGuy Simonds, who spent most of the campaign in northwestern Europe as the commander of II Canadian Corps, was probably the best general officer Canada produced during the war. He was an innovative thinker, as demonstrated by the plans he came up to clear Walcheren Island in Operation INFATUATE. Simonds made some missteps, and like most Commonwealth military leaders he was too wedded to the step-by-step phase-line British style of campaigning that focused too much on consolidation and not enough on initiative. But overall, his press has been very good. The other Canadian corps commander, Charles Foulkes, was generally regarded as a competent but limited professional.\n\nHarry Crerar, the chief of First Canadian Army during most of the campaign in northwest Europe, was flawed but suffered from an unreasonably bad postwar press. His military ability was at best limited, and he was better known as a \"political\" general. However, as the commander of Canada's forces in Europe, he had to be a political general. Monty ensured that First Canadian Army was invariably under-resourced, but had incredibly unrealistic expectations of it all the same. The situation culminated in early September 1944, when Crerar was assigned to clear all of the Channel ports and the Scheldt estuary, despite Second British Army being assigned almost all of the Canadians' motor transport. Monty attempted to blame the Canadians, and Crerar's alleged bungling, for his own inability to prioritize and the errors that his monstrous ego generated. He further criticized Crerar for attending a ceremony at Dieppe to memorialize the Canadian fallen there, despite the fact that it was basically his job and not appearing would have been ridiculous. Monty seemed to believe that generals should not have national responsibilities, if those generals were Americans or Canadians. Anyway, Crerar was not great at higher-level military operations but he wasn't that bad.\n\nThe UK also had some good general officers. However, it is often difficult to evaluate their skills. The first problem is that they generally looked very bad when placed next to German professionals with a solid grasp of a war of movement, especially since they were trapped in a deeply flawed doctrine from which few of them really broke free. North Africa and Dunkirk were the graveyards of a generation of reputations. The second problem is that Bernard Law Montgomery established an iron grip over the British military in the field in the second half of the war, whereby an officer's effectiveness was generally based on his ability to carry out Monty's orders. The field marshal was a notorious micromanager and usually left little room for the individual initiative that is at the heart of warfare. Red Army officers arguably had more leeway than British ones did, due to Monty's ever-present network of liaisons and his \"Phantom Regiment\".\n\nGiven those caveats, the best of the British wartime officers were probably in the armor. Pip Roberts was one of the outstanding division commanders of the war. Brian Horrocks was also excellent at corps level, although he was much more prone to make dubious decisions after his 1944 illness. Richard McCreery, who rose to command Eighth Army in 1944, was a highly intelligent officer who made few mistakes. Richard O'Connor was not an armor or cavalry officer, but he won one of Britain's most decisive mobile victories of the war, Operation COMPASS, the destruction of the Italian army in Libya; his later career, however, was less spectacular, and uncharitable analyses often devalue his victory in 1941 due to his often plodding and hesitant command in northwestern Europe in 1944 (while failing to mention the two years he spent in an Italian prisoner of war camp as a somewhat mitigating factor).\n\nOliver Leese, who was one of Monty's cabal, showed himself to be a limited, if not flawed, commander in Italy. He also inherited his boss's inability to work well with others, and Anglo-American cooperation in Italy was at a low ebb when Clark and Leese were in command. John Crocker, I Corps commander in 1944, was more professionally competent but equally incapable of dealing effectively with allied forces (in his case, his Canadian superior officers in First Canadian Army).\n\nMiles Dempsey was also Monty's man, but possessed significantly more competence than Leese. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell what decisions were his and not his boss's. His actions commanding Second British Army in Normandy showed little flair or drive, and he and Monty share blame (with Bradley) for the failure of the Falaise encirclement and the subsequent attempt to encircle German armies on the Seine. Dempsey's troops moved spectacularly quickly during the subsequent pursuit, to the point where even Patton expressed his admiration. He was also critical of Montgomery's deeply flawed MARKET-GARDEN plan and, following excellent military instincts, proposed an alternative that Monty simply ignored. After MARKET-GARDEN failed, Monty eventually adopted Dempsey's alternative, a crossing of the Rhine at Wesel, in the spring of 1945.\n\nSome British officers died early, before promising starts to their careers could come to fruition. Jock Campbell and William Gott showed some ability in the Western Desert fighting, but both died in 1942. Admittedly, their actions look somewhat better by comparison to their peers, and it's hard to tell how either would have done in roles of greater authority.\n\nWilliam Slim, the commander of the so-called \"forgotten\" Fourteenth Army in India and Burma, did a decent job with limited resources. Some of his ideas were inventive, but their actual battlefield utility turned out to be quite small. He was certainly a competent and conscientious officer who fought a difficult war well, but the postwar British Army lionized him to a degree that is faintly silly nowadays. (One might say the same of the Americans and Patton for different reasons.) Of course, it's good not to go too far in correcting Churchill's overblown opinion of him. Slim was a great officer with good ideas, and one of the best generals in the British Army during the war.\n\nOne of the reasons the Western Desert was littered with so many fired British generals was Claude Auchinleck, their ostensible commander in the Middle East. The \"Auk\" was demonized after the war, mostly by comparison to Monty, as a man who simply couldn't get the job done against the Germans, and who was both personally incompetent and incompetent at choosing subordinates. There was some push-back against the idea after Monty died, with people gleefully willing to point out his missteps and giving the Auk credit for the victory at El Alamein. That, too, was a bit of an overcorrection. Auchinleck oversaw some real military disasters, some of which were his own making. He often benefited from Rommel's obstinate refusal to consider his very bad supply situation at multiple points. He was not fit for the job and his relief was probably the right decision.\n\nAlan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for most of the war, was a drama queen who always thought he knew best. Monty was his protege, and of course the two shared many characteristics. Brooke found diplomacy with the Americans difficult at best. He was frequently insubordinate, and in fact openly lied to his superiors in order to evacuate the \"Second BEF\", which he commanded in early June 1940, from France. However, while he shared many of Monty's failings, he was not as egregious about them as his subordinate. He focused on Antwerp and the supply situation better than Monty did and was instrumental in helping Ike finally force him into line in November and December. Like many Ulster officers, he had a great deal of difficulty in dealing with civilian leadership, but although his relationship with Churchill was, uh, difficult to say the least, he toed the line and supported the Prime Minister, recognizing political objectives that superseded operational ones. Max Hastings, a journalist who currently serves as the premier flag-waver among English writers of history, undoubtedly overstates his case (as usual) when he describes Brooke and Churchill as the greatest combination of civilian and military leadership in the history of the world. (Marshall and FDR? Moltke and Bismarck? Foch and Clemenceau? Grant and Lincoln? Vasilevskii and Stalin?) But while the partnership did not always work well, it worked well enough.\n\nWhich leaves Monty. He was an undoubtedly gifted commander who understood the importance of mass (and even speed, when he wanted to). He operated under severe constraints that his American allies rarely recognized, such as a desperate manpower shortage that pushed him into conservative decision-making. In acting as the overall ground commander for OVERLORD, he planned and managed one of the most complex undertakings in the history of warfare, and did so successfully to a degree that few if any other Western commanders could have matched at the time. He was self-confident in a way that the British Army lacked before 1942, and imprinted himself and his personality successfully on the entire force, for better and worse.\n\nWith all that said, Monty was also a disaster in many ways. His relations with allies - both American and Canadian - were abysmal, mostly of his own doing through insensitivity toward the other nations' concerns and flat-out hypocrisy. He was massively egotistical and deeply enamored of his own abilities to the degree that he, like MacArthur, made bad decisions because of it. He possessed drive, but rarely employed it at the appropriate time; many opportunities were lost because of Monty's want of speed and decisiveness, and the one time he threw caution to the wind and moved out smartly was in the run-up to MARKET-GARDEN, which led to underestimating his opponent and the disaster that befell Allied forces at Arnhem. If any one officer was responsible for the frustrating autumn that the Allies had in the west in 1944 (and goodness knows Bradley did his worst too), it was Montgomery through his failure to focus on Antwerp and the Scheldt estuary, the armies' critical supply line. He was one of the worst subordinates ever to reach so high a command. And while he undoubtedly kept a tighter grip on his troops and subordinates than did the likes of Eisenhower, it came at the price of stifling almost all initiative. Armies cannot fight that way, at least not well. British arms were rather less successful during the war than they might have been, in large part because of him.\n\nThe British Army in the Second World War and its successful regeneration is impossible to imagine without Montgomery. But for many of the same reasons, the man was atrocious at higher command. He was an impossible boss and an impossible subordinate. He was a total paradox - couldn't fight alongside him, couldn't fight without him - and I, for one, am very glad to never have had to deal with him and his frequently infuriating style of leadership.\n\nI have many thoughts about Soviet generals and marshals. Unfortunately, I probably won't get to them until tomorrow."
