        "text": "Arctic fox Alopex lagopus and red fox Vulpes vulpes are close relatives with similar niche demands in the Holarctic. Where they are sympatric, they compete for territories, dens and food. Scat analyses from Fennoscandia have shown different proportions of lemmings and voles in the diets of the two fox species suggesting food partitioning. However, it was not clear if this was due to different food preferences or distinct habitat use. Since the arctic fox is an endangered species in Fennoscandia, it is important to know whether the superior, north spreading red fox can oust it from the tundra habitat, or if food specialisation may prevent displacement. In a feeding experiment at the Lycksele Zoo in northern Sweden, we compared the food preferences of two arctic and two red foxes. Our results show that the four individuals responded similarly to a variety of food items, and particularly that the two species were not distinct in their food preferences concerning lemmings and voles. However, the foxes had considerable individual predilections. Therefore, in the wild, the unequal proportions of lemmings and voles found in scats may reflect different habitat use for hunting.\n\n1. The number of breeding dens and litter sizes of arctic foxes Alopex lagopus were recorded and the diet of the foxes was analysed during a ship-based expedition to 17 sites along the Siberian north coast. At the same time the cyclic dynamics of co-existing lemming species were examined. 2. The diet of arctic foxes was dominated by the Siberian lemming Lemmus sibiricus (on one site the Norwegian lemming L. lemmus), followed by the collared lemming Dicrostonyx torquatus. 3. The examined Lemmus sibiricus populations were in different phases of the lemming cycle as determined by age profiles and population densities. 4. The numerical response of arctic foxes to varying densities of Lemmus had a time lag of 1 year, producing a pattern of limit cycles in lemmingâ€“arctic fox interactions. Arctic fox litter sizes showed no time lag, but a linear relation to Lemmus densities. We found no evidence for a numerical response to population density changes in Dicrostonyx. 5. The functional or dietary response of arctic foxes followed a type II curve for Lemmus, but a type III response curve for Dicrostonyx. 6. Arctic foxes act as resident specialist for Lemmus and may increase the amplitude and period of their population cycles. For Dicrostonyx, on the other hand, arctic foxes act as generalists which suggests a capacity to dampen oscillations.\n\nArctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) in Fennoscandia have retreated to higher altitudes on the mountain tundra, possibly because of increased competition with red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) at lower altitudes. In this study we compare summer food niches of the two species in mountain tundra habitat. Arctic foxes consumed lemmings more often than red foxes did, while red foxes consumed field voles and birds more often. Yet despite substantial variation in the diet of each species among summers, food-niche overlaps between the species were consistently high in most summers, as arctic and red foxes responded similarly to temporal changes in prey availability. Occurrences of field voles and birds in fox scats were negatively correlated with altitude, while the occurrences of lemmings tended to increase with altitude. Since arctic foxes bred at higher altitudes than red foxes, the differences between arctic and red fox diets were better explained by altitudinal segregation than by differences between their fundamental food niches. Arctic foxes should therefore endeavour to use the more productive hunting grounds at the lower altitudes of their former range, but interference competition with red foxes might decrease their access to these areas, and consequently cause a decrease in the size of in their realised niche.\n\nIn this article we describe 77 arctic fox Alopex lagopus dens in VindelfjÃ¤llen, northern Sweden, with regard to distribution, morphology and fox use. The density of dens in the area was 1/21 km2 and dens were more spaced than random. The dens were situated at a mean altitude (Â± SD) of 915 m a.s.l. Â± 74, were on average 3.5 km Â± 1.88 from the nearest tree line, had a mean number of 44 den openings Â± 32 and a mean area of 277 m2 Â± 237. During the 21-year study period, 31 dens were used by arctic foxes and 10 by red foxes Vulpes vulpes. Number of den openings, den area, altitude and distance to the nearest tree line explained 36% of arctic fox den use (P < 0.001) and 21% of red fox use of arctic fox dens during the study period (P = 0.01). Arctic foxes used dens at higher altitude (P = 0.03) and further away from forest than did red foxes (P = 0.03), and tended to breed in dens with more openings (P = 0.08). Arctic foxes used some breeding dens more frequently than others (P = 0.002). Among the breeding dens, both den use and litter size were positively related to den area (den use: P = 0.04; litter size: P < 0.001). Successful arctic fox breeding dens in Sweden thus appear to be characterised by large size and many openings, and they are situated far away from forest at relatively high altitudes.\n\nArctic fox Alopex lagopus densities were estimated by inventories at den sites, and microtine abundance by snap trapping. Time series analyses showed that the Arctic fox population fluctuated widely but always close together with the microtines in a five-year cycle. In summer-time microtines consisted in average of 45% of the diet and reindeer Rangifer tarandus 30%, but during winters reindeer was the most important food sources with 45% compared to 15% for microtines. When microtines had high densities during two consecutive years, Arctic fox litter size only responded to the first year. It is difficult to single out one explanation to this decline and second year effect. -from Authors"
