        "meta_description": "Agamben’s political philosophy of state power as founded on the expulsion of outcasts, who are embraced as key components of the system precisely by virtue of their potential exclusion, strangely omits such cardinal and long-familiar figures of sociopolitical inequality as the slave and the barbarian. These are neglected despite how they, together, stare us in the face from the very same pages in Aristotle from which Agamben derives his theory of bare life, and despite their key historical role in imperial state ideology and in the formation of empires. Agamben instead resurrects the obscure figure of homo sacer, an ancient Roman form of outlaw interpreted as bare life, mainly for the purpose of rethinking and debating citizenship, exclusion, and the ruse of the “rule of law” in the modern Western state form. As a transhistorical-paradigmatic figure it leaves aside not only its obvious counterparts—slaves and barbarians (whose real-life referents, like homo sacer, are also both historical and contemporary)—but also the pre-state and pre-law excommunication of outcasts. In this article I discuss the historical and political anthropology of outcasts and outlaws, slaves, and barbarians, what is obscured by homo sacer, and what this “limit figure” can bring to light.",

        "text": "It is curious that Giorgio Agamben chose homo sacer as our preferred guide to the riddle of sovereignty and state power founded on the principle of exclusion (Agamben 1995, 1998, 2003, 2007)—and not either “the slave” or “the barbarian.” The slave is a quintessential paradigm of social inequality, whose radical exclusion from social and political life has been captured in the phrase “social death” (Patterson 1982). The barbarian, too, is a long-standing, formidable paradigm of exclusion that would be at least as “good to think” as the slave, for Agamben’s purposes. Both the concept of the slave and that of the barbarian involve the denial of equal membership in society, and a reduction to something less than human, which could then be exploited outside normal law. Yet instead Agamben chose to resurrect homo sacer, the now-famous but previously long-forgotten figure of ancient Rome—which was an obscure figure already in the early texts from which Agamben resurrected this mysterious character, and has previously concerned only small numbers of scholars of ancient Roman law and society.\n\nWhy? Could it have been to avoid the aspect of how power and domination are always in a process of formation? The classic figures of the slave and the barbarian are both tools deployed in this very process: The figure of the slave has historically been used to redefine people as property and objects of naked exploitation, and the figure of the barbarian has been deployed to justify their subjugation as the object of civilization. The two paradigmatic figures are also closely linked, and in effect have formed a two-pronged tool for such subjugation and exploitation by which people first defined as barbarians are reduced to and exploited as slaves—a pattern repeated today when “illegal migrants” are dragged down into (illegal and hidden) slavery.\n\nYet this entire barbarian-slave complex and its contemporary relevance are passed over by Agamben in favor of the description of state power as something like an immobile structure that is maintained, above all, by the internal threat of exclusion of its own subjects. Because his focus is really on the present, this neglect of historical parallels is not a concern for Agamben—who himself presents an eloquent, and in some ways powerful, defense of his own (and Foucault’s) explicitly ahistorical method of “working with paradigms” (see Agamben 2002a).\n\nBut while we must recognize the pressing relevance, the undeniable productivity, and the profound insights that have been generated in Agamben’s work, we must also investigate what is lost with this ahistorical approach. I suggest it deflects attention from the barbarians and slaves of the past, and also, in consequence, from today’s continuities with that past. In the following, I will raise questions about the comparative relevance of these alternative figures of otherness. I will also reach further back into history to point out that the exclusionary punitive measures Agamben highlights actually appear as institutions of outlawry in pre-state societies, before the paradigm of state-organized Law that is privileged in Agamben’s intriguing writings. I suggest that these exclusionary measures must be discussed not only as a hidden mechanism in the modern state, but also in relation to state formation as a historical process. These are the key questions addressed in this article. They force us to reopen once again the questions of state power and sovereignty."
