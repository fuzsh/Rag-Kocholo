        "text": "METHODS\n\nThis multi-centre retrospective cohort study collected data from MS patients in Sweden with rituximab treatment. Patients were eligible for inclusion if diagnosed with MS or clinically isolated syndrome, had received at least one dose of rituximab at a participating centre and were monitored in the Swedish MS Registry (SMSreg).\n\nThree centres in Stockholm (Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Academic Specialist Centre), one centre in Gothenburg (Sahlgrenska University Hospital) and two centres in Northern Sweden (Umeå University Hospital and Östersund Hospital) participated in this study. Inclusion started from the first registered dose of rituximab, on 14 March 2008, with follow-up until 25 January 2021. Patients who received plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) less than 100 days (circa five half-lives of immunoglobulins) before a rituximab dose were excluded. There were no available data on pre-existing immunodeficiencies, for example common variable immunodeficiency. The awareness of immunoglobulin measurements was lower during the first study years when pre-infusion measurements of immunoglobulins did not occur in clinical routine. However, it was possible to collect several immunoglobulin measurements from the diagnostic lumbar puncture occurring before the treatment started. When pre-treatment assessments of immunoglobulin levels started, immunoglobulin measurements below the normal range were uncommon in the cohort (Figure S1).\n\nClinical and immunological variables\n\nPatient characteristics, for example age at first rituximab infusion, sex, disease type (relapsing–remitting, RRMS; secondary progressive, SPMS; and primary progressive, PPMS), disease duration and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) level at inclusion were collected from SMSreg, with information of doses and dates of previous and current DMTs.\n\nLaboratory results were obtained from patient charts, collecting all available immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) measurements. Laboratory parameters were paired with a subsequent infusion within 45 days.\n\nCensoring\n\nPatients receiving IVIG infusions for any cause were right censored, contributing with time on treatment and laboratory results until the start of IVIG. Females with a registered pregnancy contributed with time on treatment and laboratory results until conception. Patients transferred to a non-participating centre were censored at the transfer date. Follow-up was ended on the day of the last registered rituximab dose. Patients in the Northern, Gothenburg and Stockholm Danderyd cohorts were right censored on 25 January 2021 and in the Stockholm Karolinska/ASC cohort on 14 May 2020.\n\nPregnancy\n\nPregnancy data coverage was not complete in the SMSreg. There were 44 registered pregnancies during the study period. Fertile female patients with transient lowering of IgG levels were therefore additionally assessed through journals for unregistered pregnancies.\n\nEthics\n\nEthics approvals were granted by the Local Ethics Board in Stockholm in 2018 (2018/1286-31) with amendments by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority in 2019 (2019-01187).\n\nData management and storage\n\nData were pseudonymized and stored in Excel with a secure login.\n\nMain outcomes and measurements\n\nThe primary outcome was the mean reduction of IgG and IgM levels in relation to time on rituximab treatment. Secondary outcomes were IgG and IgM decrease per 1000 mg of accumulated dose of rituximab and IgG and IgM decrease in relation to the measured covariates baseline IgG value, previous exposure to immunomodulatory drugs, age when starting rituximab treatment, centre and sex. The risk of developing hypogammaglobulinaemia below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (IgG <6.7 g/L) or low IgM (<0.27 g/L), categorized as mild (IgG 4–6.6 g/L) or severe (<4.0 g/L) hypogammaglobulinaemia, was evaluated. The laboratory reference interval at the 2.5th centile for IgG and IgM was used as a cut-off measurement, reflecting the clinical threshold for detecting patients at risk of imminent immunodeficiency.\n\nStatistical methods\n\nLinear regression was used to analyse the relationship between the outcomes IgG and IgM levels regarding exposure variables age, sex, centre and previous DMT at baseline.\n\nAssociations between exposures time on rituximab (in years) or accumulated dose on rituximab (in grams) and outcome variables (age, sex, centre, previous DMT) were analysed by linear regression at baseline, adjusting for covariates. Mean values were used to describe normally distributed data with standard deviations (SD). Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used to describe non-normally distributed values. p values under 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed in R 4.2.3.\n\nGeneralized estimating equation models were used to examine the relationships between the outcomes IgG and IgM levels and the main exposure time on rituximab (in years) whilst adjusting for additional predictors, including age, sex, previous DMTs and centre. Confidence intervals were corrected for repeated measurements on individuals through robust ‘sandwich’ standard errors, implemented by setting the correlation matrix to ‘independence’. In two separate models for IgG/IgM, the main exposure was changed to the total accumulated dose of rituximab. Additionally, for the IgM models, quadratic terms were included for both the time from the rituximab treatment start and total rituximab dosage to investigate the nonlinear effects (geeglm function in R geepack package). As a sensitivity analysis, the model was fitted with a truncated dataset for different follow-up times. Censoring at 3 and 5 years after the first rituximab dose, no significant impact in length of follow-up time on the estimated mean change over time was found.\n\nData were checked for outliers (above 1.5 times the upper IQR for IgG and IgM) and apparent mistyped values were corrected (IgG and IgM values mixed up; B-lymphocyte count data input as 106 instead of 10 [9]). No outliers were excluded.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn all, 2752 patients were identified at the participating centres in Sweden treated with rituximab between 2008 and 2021. After removing five duplicates (transferring between participating centres) and two patients lost to follow-up (non-retrievable data after moving to another centre), the cohort consisted of 2745 patients (2134 women, 611 men): Stockholm n = 1869, Gothenburg n = 417 and Northern region n = 458. In total, 13,155 IgG and 8180 IgM measurements were paired with a subsequent infusion. The mean number of IgG measurements per patient was 5.0 (SD 2.6) and the mean number of IgM measurements was 3.9 (SD 2.3) (Figure S2).\n\nBaseline characteristics and previous DMT\n\nDemographics at the rituximab treatment start and rituximab exposure variables are summarized in Table 1. The mean age at the first rituximab dose was 42.1 (SD = 11.6) years with 77.7% (n = 2134) female. The median EDSS level was 2.5 at inclusion (IQR 1.5–4.0). A majority, 74.3% (n = 2040), had RRMS, 20.0% SPMS and 5.1% PPMS. The median disease duration was 8.2 (2.8–16.0) years and the median time from diagnosis to rituximab start was 4.7 (0.5–11.4) years. 32% (n = 878) of patients were previously untreated. The most recent prior treatments registered were natalizumab 21.3% (n = 585), interferon β 19.6% (n = 537), dimethyl fumarate 9.4% (n = 258), fingolimod 8.5% (n = 234), glatiramer acetate 4.0% (n = 109) and teriflunomide 1.8% (n = 50). Fewer than 50 patients each were previously treated with an unspecified DMT (n = 43), mitoxantrone (n = 35), alemtuzumab (n = 12) or switched from autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, daclizumab, azathioprine or ciclosporin (n = 1 each) and were not included in baseline immunoglobulin analyses.\n\nStockholm Northern region Gothenburg Overall (N = 1870) (N = 458) (N = 417) (N = 2745) Sex Female 1550 (82.9%) 310 (67.7%) 274 (65.7%) 2134 (77.7%) Male 320 (17.1%) 148 (32.3%) 143 (34.3%) 611 (22.3%) Age Mean (SD) 42.0 (11.4) 41.0 (11.5) 43.7 (12.3) 42.1 (11.6) Median (min, max) 41.9 (14.4, 77.8) 41.6 (13.5, 75.1) 43.0 (9.73, 74.6) 42.1 (9.73, 77.8) MS subtype RRMS 1397 (74.7%) 355 (77.5%) 288 (69.1%) 2040 (74.3%) SPMS 383 (20.5%) 74 (16.2%) 92 (22.1%) 549 (20.0%) PPMS 75 (4.0%) 29 (6.3%) 37 (8.9%) 141 (5.1%) NA 15 (0.8%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 15 (0.5%) EDSS Mean (SD) 2.88 (2.06) 2.58 (1.95) 3.70 (2.19) 2.96 (2.09) Median (min, max) 2.50 (0, 9.00) 2.00 (0, 9.00) 3.00 (1.00, 9.00) 2.50 (0, 9.00) Missing 219 (11.7%) 55 (12.0%) 39 (9.4%) 313 (11.4%) Previous DMT Treatment-naïve 577 (30.9%) 178 (38.9%) 123 (29.5%) 878 (32.0%) Natalizumab 361 (19.3%) 89 (19.4%) 135 (32.4%) 585 (21.3%) Interferon β 375 (20.1%) 117 (25.5%) 45 (10.8%) 537 (19.6%) Dimethyl fumarate 211 (11.3%) 8 (1.7%) 39 (9.4%) 258 (9.4%) Fingolimod 187 (10.0%) 21 (4.6%) 26 (6.2%) 234 (8.5%) Glatiramer acetate 76 (4.1%) 21 (4.6%) 12 (2.9%) 109 (4.0%) Other 47 (2.5%) 23 (5.0%) 24 (5.8%) 94 (3.4%) Teriflunomide 36 (1.9%) 1 (0.2%) 13 (3.1%) 50 (1.8%) IgG Mean (SD) 10.5 (2.28) 10.6 (2.23) 10.2 (2.22) 10.5 (2.27) Median (min, max) 10.3 (1.50, 20.9) 10.4 (5.70, 18.8) 10.0 (4.40, 16.0) 10.3 (1.50, 20.9) Missing 314 (16.8%) 296 (64.6%) 230 (55.2%) 840 (30.6%) IgM Mean (SD) 1.10 (0.635) 1.05 (0.595) 1.10 (0.761) 1.10 (0.635) Median (min, max) 0.97 (0, 5.15) 0.99 (0.14, 3.2) 0.85 (0.26, 3.7) 0.97 (0, 5.15) Missing 372 (19.9%) 390 (85.2%) 397 (95.2%) 1159 (42.2%) Time diagnosis to RTX start (years) Mean (SD) 7.00 (7.28) 5.50 (6.28) 7.73 (7.22) 6.85 (7.14) Median (min, max) 4.84 (−1.76, 43.1) 3.43 (−0.397, 31.0) 6.20 (−1.27, 35.1) 4.74 (−1.76, 43.1) Missing 53 (2.8%) 4 (0.9%) 20 (4.8%) 77 (2.8%) Time from diagnosis to RTX start (years) Mean (SD) 7.00 (7.28) 5.50 (6.28) 7.73 (7.22) 6.85 (7.14) Median (min, max) 4.84 (−1.76, 43.1) 3.43 (−0.397, 31.0) 6.20 (−1.27, 35.1) 4.74 (−1.76, 43.1) Missing 53 (2.8%) 4 (0.9%) 20 (4.8%) 77 (2.8%) Time on RTX treatment Mean (SD) 1010 (664) 1700 (865) 1070 (715) 1130 (753) Median (min, max) 984 (0, 3150) 1690 (0, 4170) 978 (0, 4320) 1100 (0, 4320) Received doses of RTX Mean (SD) 5.90 (3.16) 7.35 (2.76) 6.25 (3.35) 6.19 (3.17) Median (min, max) 6.00 (1.00, 25.0) 8.00 (1.00, 28.0) 6.00 (1.00, 22.0) 6.00 (1.00, 28.0) Accumulated dose of RTX Mean (SD) 3240 (1870) 5720 (2550) 4430 (2730) 3830 (2340) Median (min, max) 3000 (500, 12,600) 5900 (500, 15,000) 3500 (1000, 19,500) 3500 (500, 19,500)\n\nTreatment regimens\n\nThe mean time on rituximab treatment was 3.1 (1.0–5.2) years, and the mean accumulated dose of rituximab was 3830 mg (SD = 2340), displayed in Table 1. The median number of rituximab infusions was 6 (range 1–28) (Figure S3). Patients received 500–1000 mg intravenously every 6–12 months. Higher initial treatment doses were used initially, commencing in the Northern region. The dosing regimen has gradually decreased over time (Figure S4). The median start dose was 1000 g, and the mean start dose was 804 g (SD = 350). The median interval between doses was 183 to 245 days (Table S3).\n\nEffect on immunoglobulin levels\n\nThe mean IgG decrease for the entire cohort was 0.27 (95% confidence interval 0.17–0.36) g/L per year on rituximab therapy (Table 2) when controlling for known factors, for example pregnancy-induced immunoglobulin decrease, plasmapheresis, IVIG therapy, age and sex. The mean IgG decrease was linear over time (Figure 1a), but IgM was nonlinear (Figure 1b, Table 3). The mean IgG decrease was also analysed in relation to the accumulated dose of rituximab, with a decrease of 0.18 (95% confidence interval 0.16–0.20) g/L per 1000 mg of administered rituximab (Table 4).

There were no statistically significant differences in IgG measurements between sexes at baseline (Tables 2 and 3).\n\nAnalysing immunoglobulin kinetics, those with the lowest baseline IgG and IgM measurements decreased slightly less than those in higher baseline groups (Figure 2a,b; Table S1A,B).\n\nChecking the validity of the models over time, those treated with rituximab for a shorter or longer time did not differ at baseline IgG levels. During follow-up, there was no difference in IgG decrease between those with a baseline IgG measurement and those without (data not shown). Analysing the interaction between time on treatment and sex, no significant difference between time on rituximab treatment and sex was noted.\n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia occurred in 8.8% of patients, with a nadir value of IgG below LLN (<6.7 g/L), and six out of 2745 (0.2%) developed severe hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG <4.0 g/L). Low IgM levels were experienced by 8.3%, with a nadir value below LLN (<0.27 g/L). In patients on rituximab therapy for 3 and 5 years, 7.7% and 9.5% had nadir measurements of IgG below LLN, respectively. Sixteen patients received IVIG infusions. Eleven individuals received repeated IVIG therapy for hypogammaglobulinaemia or infections and five patients received a single treatment and then continued rituximab infusions. There was a trend for previously natalizumab- and fingolimod-treated patients to reach IgG measurements below LLN earlier. No statistically significant difference in time to IgG levels below LLN or severe hypogammaglobulinaemia between sexes was seen.\n\nPrevious treatment and risk of low baseline IgG levels\n\nThe impact of previous DMTs for MS on baseline IgG levels before commencing rituximab treatment compared to treatment-naïve patients was adjusted for age. For those switching from fingolimod, the mean baseline IgG was 1.03 g/L lower, for natalizumab 0.80 g/L lower (Table 2) and for interferon-β-treated patients 0.40 g/L higher than for the treatment-naïve patients. For teriflunomide, glatiramer acetate or dimethyl fumarate, there was no significant difference. For patients previously treated with dimethyl fumarate, the IgG decrease rate was 0.18 g/L/year higher, compared to untreated patients. Similarly, patients treated with interferon β experienced an additional decrease in IgG levels, of 0.14 g/L/year compared to untreated patients.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this large MS cohort compiling retrospective data from about half of all rituximab-treated patients in Sweden, mean IgG levels decreased linearly by 0.27 g/L per treatment year. This decrease is interpreted as relatively modest, but its linear nature suggests that it may not be a direct consequence of rituximab treatment. Instead, it could be attributed to the attrition of plasma cells, which are not adequately repopulated by novel B-cells [35, 36], or by a secondary or downstream effect. Identifying the factors that expedite this plasma cell attrition could provide critical insights for mitigating the risk of diminished IgG levels in patients treated with rituximab. Even with treatment interruption, immunoglobulins remained low or even continued to decrease, and from our clinical experience it may take years for IgG to begin increasing.\n\nThere were no differences in immunoglobulin decrease between sexes, despite known differences in drug pharmacokinetics [37]. Furthermore, a small but significant association between age and lower IgG levels at baseline was detected, driven by the patients over 50 years, contrasting with healthy individuals, where older individuals exhibit higher levels of IgG [38].\n\nThe IgG decrease during rituximab therapy appeared linear in our population. This agrees with other studies in which starting with a lower value increased the risk of reaching LLN [36, 39]. Surprisingly, individuals with higher baseline IgG and IgM values tended to experience a greater rate of reduction of IgG and IgM over time in our study. There were no significant differences in follow-up dropout rates in relation to baseline IgG level.\n\nIn the present study, natalizumab and fingolimod were identified as predictors for reduced baseline IgG levels in patients with MS. However, it is worth noting that the mechanisms underlying these reductions appear to vary between treatments. Natalizumab has no known effect on B-cell function besides migration properties. However, other MS studies have reported immunoglobulin decrease during treatment with natalizumab for MS [11, 40-42]. Possible mechanisms presented have been a natalizumab-induced alteration of B-cell gene expression, blocking of VLA4-mediated interaction of plasma cells in the bone marrow [43], epigenetic changes [42] or interference with B-cell homing to peripheral lymphoid tissue [41]. Also, significantly lower mean IgG and IgM are noted for fingolimod compared to healthy individuals [11]. Despite these findings, current guidelines do not recommend routine monitoring of IgG levels during treatment with natalizumab and fingolimod. We argue that monitoring immunoglobulin levels in MS therapies may be extended beyond anti-CD20 therapies.\n\nHypogammaglobulinaemia secondary to immunosuppressive therapies is increasingly reported in MS and other autoimmune diseases [7, 44]. Repeated dosing of anti-CD20 therapies not allowing for B-cell repopulation has been associated with a more rapid decrease of immunoglobulin levels than individual doses. Several recent MS and NMOSD studies report a correlation between time on treatment, treatment dose and the risk of developing hypogammaglobulinaemia [6, 9, 19, 20, 39]. IgG decrease rates of approximately 0.4 g/L yearly are described with induction protocols (2000 mg of rituximab) and re-treatment immediately after B-cell repopulation [9, 19, 20]. In a 14-year NMOSD follow-up study by Kim et al. [19], 41% experienced IgG measurements below <6.0 g/L (assigned LLN). A majority (11/15) of participants developed IgG levels below <7.0 (assigned LLN) during a 70-month median follow-up in an Italian NMOSD cohort [9]. With similar rituximab treatment for up to 3.7 years for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorder or NMOSD, 17% of patients experienced hypogammaglobulinaemia (LLN <6.0 g/L), with a median of 5.4 years to hypogammaglobulinaemia onset [20]. In RA, hypogammaglobulinaemia and risk of infections are recognized complications of long-term B-cell depleting therapies and are reported in up to 24% of patients [6, 8, 39].\n\nThe data from our cohort indicate a lower rate of IgG decline compared with the NMOSD and RA studies, which possibly in part could be explained by dose reductions and extended infusion intervals at Swedish centres [2, 31, 32]. In the rituximab studies for RA, concomitant medication with methotrexate and oral steroids can contribute to this risk [8]. Higher accumulated doses of rituximab and not allowing B-cell repopulation may account for a higher risk in NMOSD treatment [11, 16, 41, 45]. In NMOSD, there were no available data on other concomitant medications, for example steroids or other immunosuppressants, possibly contributing to IgG decrease [7].\n\nIt is essential to manage the increased infection risk in hypogammaglobulinaemia during rituximab therapy [7, 16, 44]. The Swedish real-world prospective cohort by Luna et al. [17] reported an increased risk of infections requiring hospitalization or antibiotics or antivirals, compared to healthy controls or MS patients treated with injectables, natalizumab and fingolimod. Importantly, these data do not take rituximab treatment length or accumulated dose into account nor analyse the relation with IgG or B-lymphocyte values. In a French observational study [16] assessing the risk of hypogammaglobulinaemia and infections in 188 MS patients with rituximab treatment, IgG levels <6 g/L were significantly associated with a risk of developing infections. Compared to our study, a higher proportion developed IgG <6 g/L (23.4%) and <4 g/L (4.2%). The number of doses was comparable; however, the median EDSS was higher than in our cohort [16].\n\nOcrelizumab and ofatumumab [26] were not associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia in the MS registration studies OPERA [46] and ASCLEPIOS [47]. The OPERA ocrelizumab 5-year extension [5] observed trends towards lower IgG and IgM levels, reporting IgG below assigned LLN (<5.45 g/L) in 5.4% and IgM below assigned LLN (<0.4 g/L) in 29.5%. Most patients received steroids before infusions [47]. In the 3.5-year extension ofatumumab ALITHIOS [48] study, 1.7% developed IgG below the same LLN (<5.65 g/L) and 25.1% IgM (<0.40 g/L) [48]. The IgG levels decreased by 9.5% at year 1 and 17% at a 5-year follow-up of ocrelizumab compared with baseline values, and for ofatumumab IgG levels remained relatively stable [45]. A study comparing rituximab and ocrelizumab during the first year found lower IgG levels in the ocrelizumab group compared to the rituximab group [30]. Notably, LLN was >1 g/L lower in the ocrelizumab and ofatumumab trials than in our study [46-48].\n\nThe presented lower risk for IgG decrease for ofatumumab in the ALITHIOS [48] and ASCLEPIOS [47] studies compared with our data may be an effect of a lower anti-CD20 antibody dosage. However, it may in part also be explained by differences in follow-up time and patient selection. Moreover, steroids are not used when administering ofatumumab, which could influence the risk of reducing IgG values [47].\n\nStrengths and weaknesses\n\nA strength of this real-world retrospective study is the large number of patients included. Including virtually all patients from three major geographical areas of Sweden treated with rituximab increased the external validity. Data quality was improved by high data density, few switches to other therapies and infusions within a 6- or 12-month timeframe, although the different prevailing infusion schemes over time remain a weakness. Future studies can evaluate whether de-escalation strategies reduce the risk of developing hypogammaglobulinaemia. In this real-world setting, there may be different reasons for treatment discontinuation. Only a few patients were followed up on treatment for more than 5 years. Selection bias and healthy survivor bias are some potential confounders in this observational study setting.\n\nPatients remaining on therapy may have been selected for not developing side effects, for example frequent infections. No differences in baseline IgG measurements were found between the whole cohort and those continuing therapy. This strengthens our result of a uniform moderate and gradual decrease in mean IgG levels."
