My name is Ismail Abdulrhman. I was born in a beautiful city called Aldaein located in eastern Darfur. I studied basic and secondary school there and then I moved to the capital of Sudan to study university.\n\nI became Darfur United player in 2014, and in the same year, we got the chance to play in Sweden in a tournament. It was during that tournament when I and many other players decided to stay in Sweden.\n\nSo, now I live in Sweden. Since that time, I’ve kept those beautiful memories. I think I will keep them forever. Since joining the Darfur United team I don’t remember anything bad just some results of matches which we played with the other teams.\n\nI overcame my bad childhood and the impact of the war through tolerance and humor and that gave me a good place inside the team which I’m proud of and please with.\n\nI am now retired from playing on the Darfur United team in order to give a chance to two other players who are better than me and I am ambassador to the team and one of the leaders on the Executive Board.\n\nCorey Baim\n\nBorn and bred in the Los Angeles area, Corey now resides in the South Bay and is the owner of an award-winning Graphic Design and Marketing agency located in Hermosa Beach, Ca.

The bandaid is a symbol showing them that the world cares and hasn’t forgotten about them. The bandaid allows them to keep going. The cut is covered and protected now. They can get back into the game. The cut might still hurt, and all wounds take time to heal. But, the bandaid gives power to not sit on the sidelines, to not give up, and just play. Every human, no matter of living situations, culture, gender, or race, deserves equal and the highest standard of medical care."
