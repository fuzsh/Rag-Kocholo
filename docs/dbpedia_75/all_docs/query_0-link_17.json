        "text": "This paper examines access to alcohol, trends in consumption, drinking patterns, damage from alcohol, and developments in prevention and alcohol policy â€“ focusing on the Canadian experience over the last two decades. Consumption, as measured by official sales, declined initially and then has increased since 1996. During this time there was a gradual increase in access to alcohol, with steeper increase in some jurisdictions undergoing partial or full privatization of retail alcohol sales. According to survey data, the proportion drinking in a high risk manner is greater among youth and young adults, and the trend in the proportion of high risk drinkers does not necessarily follow the trend in alcohol sales. In light of intensive and multi-dimensional efforts to curtail drinking and driving, these rates have gone down during the period under study. Several provinces have introduced alcohol strategies and a national strategy introduced in 2007 is being implemented. Nevertheless there are ongoing challenges of getting alcohol on the broader public health agenda, even though it is major contributor to disease and disability. The rising consumption and increased access to alcohol, combined with intensive marketing, represent a major public health challenge. It is unlikely that there will be significant strides in reducing the damage from alcohol to Canadian populations, unless there is a substantial change in the status quo involving implementation of the most effective policies and prevention strategies.\n\nTo examine the potential effects of replacing the Swedish alcohol retail system with a private licensing system on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm. Two possible scenarios were analysed: (1) replacing the current alcohol retail monopoly with private licensed stores that specialize in alcohol sales or (2) making all alcohol available in grocery stores. We utilized a multiplicative model that projected effects of changes in a set of key factors including hours of sale, retail prices, promotion and advertising and outlet density. Next, we estimated the effect of the projected consumption increase on a set of harm indicators. Values for the model parameters were obtained from the research literature. Measures of alcohol-related harm included explicitly alcohol-related mortality, accident mortality, suicide, homicide, assaults, drinking driving and sickness absence. According to the projections, scenario 1 yields a consumption increase of 17% (1.4 litres/capita), which in turn would cause an additional 770 deaths, 8500 assaults, 2700 drinking driving offences and 4.5 million sick days per year. The corresponding figures for scenario 2 are a consumption increase of 37.4% (3.1 litres/capita) leading to an additional annual toll of 2000 deaths, 20 000 assaults, 6600 drinking driving offences and 11.1 million days of sick leave. Projections based on the research literature suggest that privatization of the Swedish alcohol retail market would significantly increase alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.\n\nThis paper examines access to alcohol, trends in consumption, drinking patterns, damage from alcohol, and developments in prevention and alcohol policy - focusing on the Canadian experience over the last two decades.
