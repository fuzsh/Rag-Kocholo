In the control group, there was no significant decline\n\nNotes\n\nAwaiting clarification regarding scoring system used for the UDI and IIQ questionnaires in the trial. Authors contacted on 23 February 2018\n\nZhang 2015\n\nMethods\n\nThis study aimed to observe the effect of pelvic floor rehabilitation on SUI in elderly women. The effect was assessed after treatment\n\nParticipants\n\n86 elderly women with SUI were randomly allocated into training group (n = 43) and control group (n = 43)\n\nInterventions\n\nTraining group: attended a pelvic floor rehabilitation course\n\nControl group: received routine education only\n\nOutcomes\n\nIn the training group, the symptoms of all participants were improved. The symptom improvement rates in women with mild SUI was 95.65% and moderate SUI was 81.25%. Their pelvic floor muscle strength was 3.29 (SD 0.98) after treatment, which was higher than that of pretreatment (2.56 (SD 0.42)). Mean 1HPTV was 5.93 g (SD 2.05) before treatment and 4.16 g (SD 1.84) after treatment (P < 0.05). But I‐QOL showed no significant difference between the 2 groups after treatment (P > 0.05)\n\nNotes\n\nInformation taken from an abstract containing very little information.
