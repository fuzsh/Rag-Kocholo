        "text": "A high-resolution study of benthic foraminiferal assemblages was performed on a ca. eight metre long sediment core from Gullmar Fjord on the west coast of Sweden. The results of 210Pb- and AMS 14C-datings show that the record includes the two warmest climatic episodes of the last 1500years: the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the recent warming of the 20th century. Both periods are known to be anomalously warm and associated with positive NAO winter indices. Benthic foraminiferal successions of both periods are compared in order to find faunal similarities and common denominators corresponding to past climate changes. During the MWP, Adercotryma glomerata, Cassidulina laevigata and Nonionella iridea dominated the assemblages. Judging from dominance of species sensitive to hypoxia and the highest faunal diversity for the last ca. 2400years, the foraminiferal record of the MWP suggests an absence of severe low oxygen events. At the same time, faunas and δ13C values both point to high primary productivity and/or increased input of terrestrial organic carbon into the fjord system during the Medieval Warm Period. Comparison of the MWP and recent warming revealed different trends in the faunal record. The thin-shelled foraminifer N. iridea was characteristic of the MWP, but became absent during the second half of the 20th century. The recent Skagerrak–Kattegat fauna was rare or absent during the MWP but established in Gullmar Fjord at the end of the Little Ice Age or in the early 1900s. Also, there are striking differences in the faunal diversity and absolute abundances of foraminifera between both periods. Changes in primary productivity, higher precipitation resulting in intensified land runoff, different oxygen regimes or even changes in the fjord's trophic status are discussed as possible causes of these faunal differences.\n\nGullmar Fjord, a sill fjord on the Skagerrak coast of western Sweden, contains a valuable sedimentary archive for the last 2500 years. This archive encompasses a temporal record from the Roman Warm Period, the Dark Ages, the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age and into the modern warm period. A high resolution dinoflagellate cyst analysis has been completed on this archive using material from two cores taken from the deepest part of the fjord, Alsbäck Deep. The recovered dinoflagellate cysts have provided a quantitative temporal record that has been used to construct a dinoflagellate cyst spectrum and has been subjected to both Q-mode cluster analysis and CABFAC factor analysis with varimax rotation. In addition the heterotrophic ratio and both the thermophilic and cryophilic ratios have been calculated to assist with the interpretation of the results. Well preserved and diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages have been recovered throughout the sedimentary sequence and have been used to explore surface water conditions within the fjord over this time interval. Although a clear link is observed between the cyst assemblages and the climate phases of the Subatlantic, established from previous stable isotope work, there was little change in the cyst populations and indeed they reflect the known modern cyst floras. However a major change was seen in the incoming of Gymnodinium nolleri during the Dark Age and its reduction to a relict species towards the end of the Little Ice Age. Comparisons to other published work confirm the regional nature of this dinoflagellate cyst event but its ecological preferences remain enigmatic. A second major change was also recognised around the late 1960s/early 1970s and was associated with differences in nutrient availability from either a diminution in upwelling, as the NAO changed from a negative phase to a positive, or from marine pollution or a combination of both. Otherwise the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages can be grouped, using the factor analysis, into F1 Protoperidinium spp. indet. (round, brown cysts); F2 G. nolleri and F3 Lingulodinium polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum. The cluster analysis shows a similar subdivision into units closely associated with the recognised climate phases of the Subatlantic. Possible climate environments have been explored, but because of the relatively minor variations in the assemblages and the lack of autecological information, only relatively small scale changes were recognised except for the clear, but complex nature of the recent warm period.\n\nWe discuss the climatic and environmental changes during the last millennium in NE Europe based on a ca. 8-m long high-resolved and well-dated marine sediment record from the deepest basin of Gullmar Fjord (SW Swe- den). According to the 210Pb- and 14C-datings, the record includes the period of the late Holocene characterised by anomalously cold summers and well-known as the Little Ice Age (LIA). Using benthic foraminiferal stratigraphy, lithol- ogy, bulk sediment geochemistry and stable carbon isotopes we reconstruct various phases of the cold period, identify its timing in the study area and discuss the land–sea inter- actions occurring during that time. The onset of the LIA is indicated by an increase in cold-water foraminiferal species Adercotryma glomerata at ∼ 1350 AD The first phase of the LIA was characterised by a stormy climate and higher pro- ductivity, which is indicated by a foraminiferal unit of Non- ionella iridea and Cassidulina laevigata. Maximum abun- dances of N. iridea probably mirror a short and abrupt warm- ing event at ∼1600AD. It is likely that due to land use changes in the second part of the LIA there was an increased input of terrestrial organic matter to the fjord, which is in- dicated by lighter δ13C values and an increase of detritiv- orous and omnivorous species such as Textularia earlandi and Eggerelloides scaber. The climate deterioration during the climax of the LIA (1675–1704 AD), as suggested by the increase of agglutinated species, presence of Hyalinea balth- ica, and a decline of N. iridea may have driven the decline in primary productivity during this time period.\n\nWe discuss the climatic and environmental changes during the last millennium in NE Europe based on a ca. 8-m long high-resolved and well-dated marine sediment record from the deepest basin of Gullmar Fjord (SW Sweden).

The climate deterioration during the climax of the LIA (1675-1704 AD), as suggested by the agglutinated species, caused some carbonate dissolution, variations in primary productivity and a decline of N. iridea dependant on fresh phytodetritus. It is also assumed that an increase of Hyalinea balthica could be indicative of climate warming trends at 1600-1743 and 1813-1940 AD."
