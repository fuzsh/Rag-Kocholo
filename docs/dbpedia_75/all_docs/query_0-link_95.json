Ebisawa1\n\n1Sagamihara National Hospital, Sagamihara, Japan; 2Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan; 3Konan Medical Center, Kobe, Japan; 4Mito Saiseikai General Hospital, Mito, Japan; 5Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan\n\n*Presenting author: A. Kawai\n\nBackground: Tree nut is becoming an increasingly prevalent cause of food allergy in Western countries, and is a common cause of anaphylaxis. There are no studies on the onset of children with cashew allergy. In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical features of the onset of cashew allergy in Japanese pediatric population.\n\nMethod: We conducted a multi-center cross-sectional study and retrospectively collected clinical data of children with cashew allergy from medical charts. Patients aged 0 to 15 who visited the participating institutions between 2013 and 2022, with a clear history of immediate reaction with cashew ingestion and confirmed cashew sensitization on blood tests were included. Information on the patient's initial reaction with cashew ingestion, background, allergic comorbidities, and serological data was obtained. The primary outcome was the age of the initial reaction.\n\nResults: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. The median age of the initial reaction was 5 years (interquartile range: 3–7 years). The median level of specific IgE to cashew and Ana o 3 within a year of the initial reaction was 7.8 kUA/L (interquartile range: 2.9–27.6 kUA/L) and 6.9 kUA/L (interquartile range: 1.8–20.9 kUA/L). The rate of infantile eczema, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma or recurrent wheeze, and allergic rhinitis were 43% (89/222), 54% (112/222), 23% (47/222), and 38% (79/222), respectively. History of immediate reaction to other foods prior to cashew was seen in 71% of the patients, and the most common causative foods were walnut, egg, milk, peanut, and wheat. Sensitization to cashew was confirmed before the initial reaction in 28% of the patients, and the initial reaction occurred during oral food challenge (OFC) in 21% of the patients. During the initial reaction, cutaneous, mucous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular symptoms were seen in 70%, 52%, 56%, 32%, and 11% of the patients, respectively. Anaphylaxis occurred in 32% of all initial reactions and in 17% of initial reactions during OFCs.\n\nConclusion: In Japanese children with cashew allergy, the initial reaction occurred most during early childhood, and anaphylaxis was common. Further investigation is required to develop a method to identify children at high risk of cashew allergy.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000255\n\nPerinatal exposure to TIO2 nanoparticles increases the progeny's proclivity to develop food allergy\n\nM.

Issa\n\nBackground: Food allergy (FA) is an inappropriate and excessive immunological response against food proteins that results from a defective establishment of oral tolerance. Various environmental factors may act from an early age, or even from in utero life, to promote the development of this pathology. Indeed, the perinatal period is a critical window of susceptibility during which stressors such as chemicals can affect the establishment of intestinal homeostasis, favoring the onset of immune related-diseases such as FA. Among them are foodborne inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), known for their potential adverse immune effects in the gut. Moreover, TiO2 NPs have been demonstrated to cross the human placental barrier and to be excreted in milk, possibly interfering with the establishment of gut homeostasis in early life. In the present study, we aimed to determine the impact of perinatal exposure to food-grade TiO2 on the propensity of the progeny to develop FA.\n\nMethod: Female mice were exposed to a control or food-grade (fg)-TiO2-enriched diet at a human relevant level (10 mg/kg BW/day) starting before and continuing during pregnancy and lactating periods. At weaning, pups were fed with the same diet as their mother. Progeny from both groups was then experimentally sensitized to cow's milk (CM) proteins thanks to weekly intra-gastric administrations of CM with Cholera toxin. In a subgroup, oral tolerance to CM was induced before sensitization. Sensitization was then assessed by measuring levels of b-lactoglobulin (BLG) and casein-specific IgG1 and IgE antibodies in plasma collected after an oral food challenge (OFC) with CM concentrate. Elicitation of the allergic reaction was checked by measuring mouse mast cell protease (mMCP1) concentrations.\n\nResults: Male but not female offspring perinatally exposed to fg-TiO2 exhibited higher plasmatic levels of mMCP-1 after the OFC compared to controls, indicating a higher elicitation of the intestinal allergic reaction in this sex only. Moreover, whereas oral tolerance was efficiently developed in controls and in perinatally exposed females, it was less efficient in exposed male progeny, as demonstrated by BLG- and casein-specific IgE and IgG1 levels.\n\nConclusion: These results suggest that dietary chronic exposure to fg-TiO2, starting in utero, significantly interfere with the induction of oral tolerance and enhance the propensity to develop FA, with a clear gender effect.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000993\n\nStratifying risk for milk allergies utilizing EMR data: A machine learning approach\n\nT.

Landau\n\nBackground: The prevalence of food allergy has grown globally and cow's milk is one of the most common causes of allergic reactions to food and of food-induced anaphylaxis. Dietary practices, along with genetic, environmental, and medical history features affect one's risk of developing food allergies. It is currently unclear as to whether the combined analysis of these risk elements may allow us to understand the driving factors behind an infant's risk of developing cow's milk allergy. We aimed to develop various prediction models to stratify an infant's risk of developing cow's milk allergy from a large and nationally representative healthcare provider electronical record database.\n\nMethod: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional database study on the Leumit Health Services electronic medical record database. Patients born after 2010 and diagnosed with milk allergy by an allergist before reaching one year of age were included (n = 2,393). Control patients included all patients born after 2010 without a food allergy diagnosis to date (n = 74,974). Documented risk factors include parental, sibling and infant history of atopic conditions, weight, gender, season of birth, socio-economic status, prescriptions, specialist visits and previous diagnoses. All factors were taken from the period prior to the milk allergy diagnosis. Logistic regression and machine learning predictive models were trained and tested on the combined dataset.\n\nResults: The odds ratio conferred on an infant due to parental (1.33, CI 1.26–1.40, p < 0.001) or sibling (1.34, CI 1.29–1.40, p < 0.001) history of atopy and prior diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (2.73, CI 2.43–3.06, p < 0.001) constitute important risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed an area under the curve of 0.74 for a logistic regression and 0.80 for a XGBoost model. The latter model boasts a maximum accuracy of 81%, with corresponding sensitivity of 64%, and specificity of 81%.\n\nConclusion: Machine learning predictive modeling using routinely collected electronic medical record data can serve as a powerful tool to stratify an infant's risk of developing cow's milk allergy. Knowledge of an infant's risk can inform both caregivers and medical professionals as to timely interventions to mitigate the development of cow's milk allergy.\n\nConflicts of interest: TL, DG & MB report personal fees from MYOR Diagnostics Ltd. during the conduct of the study.\n\n000645\n\nA novel intervention to support families managing both food allergy and lower income\n\nA.

Protudjer1\n\n1University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada; 2McGill University, Montreal, Canada; 3University of Manitoba (At time of data collection), Winnipeg, Canada\n\n*Presenting author: J. Protudjer\n\nBackground: Owing to the near-ubiquity of cow's milk in the food supply chain and higher costs of non-cow's milk alternatives, cow's milk allergy (CMA) has been described as the most burdensome food allergy. Although food costs have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, families managing food allergy are disproportionately burdened. We aimed to describe families’ food costs and mental health during a 6-month biweekly home delivery of CMA-friendly meal kits.\n\nMethod: We recruited 10 families whose children <6 years had allergist-diagnosed CMA, and who had a net household income of <$70,001 Canadian dollars (approximately €48,900). At baseline, families completed a demographics questionnaire, including allergic history. Severe reactions were operationalised as reported dizziness/fainting, respiratory distress or arrest, or loss of consciousness. Every 2 weeks for 6 months (Feb-Jul 2022), we delivered CMA-friendly meal kits, valued at ~$50/kit (~€39/kit) to families’ homes. Other reported food allergies were also considered when creating meal kits for families. At baseline, midpoint and endpoint, families completed questionnaires on food costs and mental health.\n\nResults: Amongst the 10 participating families, the mean monthly income was $3493.81 (€2441.20). Families were ethnically diverse, and most were 4-person (range 2–8) families. At baseline, children with CMA were age 3.0 ± 1.4 years, and 20% had a history of severe reactions. Other food allergies were reported, most commonly to eggs, peanut and soy (n = 4 each).\n\nAt baseline, monthly food costs averaged $736.36 ± $387.36, which decreased at midpoint to $673.75 ± 201.28, representing a non-statistically significant decrease of $62.61 (€43.74), or 8.5%. By endpoint, these costs had rebounded to $712.50 ± $251.78, corresponding to an increase from midpoint of $38.75 (€27.06), or 5.4%, but which reflected a net decrease from baseline of $23.86 (€16.67), or 3.2%.\n\nRegarding mental health, food allergy quality of life and perceived stress did not change during the intervention (all p ≥ 0.60). Perceived life status non-significantly improved from baseline to midpoint (6.82 ± 0.48; and, 8.0 ± 0.46, respectively, p = 0.11), but at endpoint (7.48 ± 0.53), was comparable to baseline (p = 0.38).\n\nConclusion: During a period in which food costs increased by approximately 11% in Canada, a 6-month home delivery of CMA-meal kits resulted in a modest decrease in food costs, with little change to mental health.\n\nConflicts of interest: Elissa Abrams is an employee of the Public Health Agency of Canada; the views expressed are here own and not those of the Public Health Agency.

Srisuwatchari1\n\n1Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand; 2Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand\n\n*Presenting author: S. Tangvalelerd\n\nBackground: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing inflammatory dermatosis and characterized by dry and pruritic skin. Food allergy (FA) is often reported in one-third of AD children, particularly in moderate to severe AD. Although, the dual-allergen exposure hypothesis has been postulated, multifactorial etiology might play an important role and involving in this complex disease.\n\nMethod: A questionnaire-based observational study was conducted in Allergy and Dermatology clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. All patients age less than 6 years who were physician diagnosed with AD by Hanifin and Rajka criteria were included in this study. The diagnosis of FA was made by Pediatric Allergists. Potential factors were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression and the age of AD resolution was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.\n\nResults: A total of 110 children were enrolled (67 male, median age of 2.3y (range 1.2–3.8)). Of which, 57 of them had AD without FA, and 53 children had AD with FA (30.2% with single FA, and 69.8% with multiple FA). Very early onset of AD (<3mo), and moderate to severe AD at the onset were reported in 43.9%, and 26.3% in AD without FA, and 35.8%, and 45.4% in AD with FA, respectively. The most common reported FA were hen's egg (67.9%), followed by cow's milk (60.4%), wheat (58.5%), soybean (24.5%), fish (22.6%), shellfish (15.1%), and peanut (11.3%). Moderate to severe AD at onset was found to be a significant risk factor associated with FA (adjusted odd ratio 2.52; 95%CI: 1.05–6.03, p = 0.038), after adjusting for all potential risk factors. Thirty-one patients (28.1%) resolved from AD at, 8.2% resolved at 1-year, 21.8% at 2-year, and 28.1% by 6-year of age. Among children resolved from AD, 19(33%) were from AD without FA, and 12(22.6%) were from AD with FA, with the median age of AD resolution at 1.5y (IQR 1,2), and 1.6y (IQR 1.5,1.8), respectively. AD children with FA had a trend toward slower rate of remission as compared to AD children without FA, after adjusting for onset and severity of AD (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46; 95%CI: 0.22–0.99, p = 0.05).\n\nConclusion: In preschool AD children with FA, the severity of AD at onset was greater, and resolution age of AD tended to be later as compared to AD children without FA.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000088\n\nHome-based introduction of egg protein in paediatric IGE-mediated egg allergy – A review of treatment strategy 2011–2021\n\nA. Gallagher1,2; C. Cronin1; Y. Ramesh1; J. Hourihane3; J. Trujillo2\n\n1University College Cork, Cork, Ireland; 2Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland; 3Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\n\n*Presenting author: A. Gallagher\n\nBackground: Egg allergy is the second most common food allergy in children and one of the main causes of anaphylaxis in infants. In many European countries standard practice for children with IgE-mediated egg allergy is total avoidance until 6–7 years old. However, recent studies have shown that the early stepwise introduction of egg to the diet can promote earlier tolerance. In Ireland reintroduction of egg to the diet is reached following home-based induction of egg protein via the egg ladder. Seemingly the longer the egg allergy persists the less likely the child will achieve tolerance; therefore early introduction is imperative.\n\nMethod: A sample of 300 charts of children treated for IgE-mediated egg allergy in the paediatric clinic in Cork University hospital from 2011 to 2021 were reviewed. Inclusion and exclusion were applied. Data were analysed using STATA.\n\nResults: 300 charts reviewed, 78 excluded due to Skin Prick Test (SPT) <3mm and 23 excluded due to incomplete documentation. 22 lost to follow-up, 24 still ongoing treatment, 2 discontinued treatment due to malignancy diagnosis, 18 did not achieve tolerance and were still avoiding egg in some form. This resulted in 133 children who completed the egg ladder and were included in statistical analysis (N = 133). Mean time to complete ladder and achieve tolerance was 30 months. Concomitant peanut allergy increased time to achieve tolerance by 10.63 months and documented parental anxiety resulted in 11.26 months longer on the egg ladder. For each unit increase in Specific IgE (kIU/L) time to achieve tolerance was increased by 0.2 months. Other variables were included in the construction of the model however, were not significant and reduced the R2 and were removed from the final regression. 40 had symptoms of anaphylaxis at time of diagnosis. Only 1 had anaphylaxis while on the egg ladder, due to accidental exposure.\n\nConclusion: Home based introduction of egg protein via the egg ladder is safe and effective. Specific IgE, history of peanut allergy and parental anxiety are useful predictors of duration of treatment.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000429\n\nPrognostic factors facilitating multiple food allergies and atopic march occurrence in children with non-IGE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy: Results of two years follow up of the NIGEFA project\n\nL.

Berni Canani1,4\n\n1University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; 2University of Bologna – Faculty of Medicine, Bologna, Italy; 3Hospital Santa Maria delle Croci, Ravenna, Italy; 4University of Naples Federico II, Napoli, Italy\n\n*Presenting author: L. Carucci\n\nBackground: Many aspects of non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal food allergies (non-IgE-GIFA) (including four phenotypes of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, FPIES; enteropathy, FPE; allergic proctocolitis, FPIAP; and motility disorders, FPIMD), are still poorly characterized. The NIGEFA project was launched for the investigation of these conditions.\n\nMethod: Prospective observational study evaluating children with non-IgE-GIFA diagnosed according to standard criteria observed at a tertiary center for pediatric gastroenterology and allergy (both sex, aged <14 y, follow up 24 m). Main anamnestic and clinical data were collected from all enrolled patients.\n\nResults: 123 children (56% male) with a median (IQR) age of 150 (60–300) days were enrolled into the study. The frequency of non-IgE-GIFA was: FPE (39%), FPIES (17%), FPIAP (16%), and FPIMD (28%). 42% of children had multiple food allergies (FA) at baseline and 64% had a family risk for allergy. Male sex (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.24, 95%CI 1.07 to 4.71) and 1-month diagnostic delay (OR = 1.09, 1.01 to 1.18) were associated with multiple FA. The 24-mo overall rate of immune tolerance acquisition was 54%, with a higher rate in FPIAP (75%) compared with FPIMD (62%), FPE (54%) and FPIES (24%). The odds of 24 m immune tolerance acquisition rate were lower in children with family risk for allergy (OR = 0.41, 0.19 to 0.89) and in those with multiple FA at baseline (OR = 0.24, 0.11 to 0.51). At the 24m follow up, the atopic march was observed in 46% patients, with similar rates in the four clinical phenotypes. The presence of multiple FA at baseline was associated with atopic march occurrence (OR = 2.22, 1.07 to 4.61) at 24 months.\n\nConclusion: These data suggest the importance of early diagnosis to prevent the occurrence of multiple FA and of the atopic march and to hasten the immune tolerance acquisition in children with non-IgE-GIFA.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000550\n\nThe allergenicity ladder: A possible approach for home-base fish introduction in children with IGE-mediated fish allergy?\n\nC. Y. Y. Wai1; N. Y. H. Leung1; A. S. Y. Leung; G. Wong1; T. F. Leung1,2\n\n1Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong; 2Hong Kong Hub of Paediatric Excellence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\n*Presenting author: C. Y. Y. Wai\n\nBackground: Fish is a valuable source of healthy nutrients with increasing global demand. Fish allergy affects 0.1%–0.4% of the world's population, has an early onset and tends to persist throughout life. With the high sequence and structural homology of parvalbumins, the major fish allergen, allergy to multiple fishes is common. However, there are reports of mono-allergy to single fish but tolerating others, thus suggesting allergenicity differences in edible fishes. We therefore hypothesize that commonly consumed fish present different allergenicity (ladder) leading to different clinical presentation of fish allergy, and the identification of the allergenicity ladder allows gradual and safe home re-introduction of fishes in children with IgE-mediated fish allergy. This study thus aimed at distinguishing the IgE reactivity of commonly consumed fish for the construction of such ladder.\n\nMethod: Physician-diagnosed fish allergic subjects (n = 200) were recruited from five regional hospitals in Hong Kong. IgE reactivity against three freshwater fishes (tilapia, grass carp and catfish), six marine fishes (cod, salmon, tuna, grouper, herring and halibut) and two recombinant parvalbumins (rCyp c 1 and rGad c 1) was measured by ImmunoCAP Specific IgE (sIgE) assays.\n\nResults: With a cut-off value of 0.35 kUA/L, 166 subjects were positive to at least one of the assays tested. The major causative fish among these sensitized subjects was grass carp (44%) while the leading tolerant fish was salmon (27%). One-third of the sensitized subjects had negative sIgE level (class 0) to tuna, halibut and salmon, while the pattern reversed with one-third of these subjects presenting high sIgE levels to the freshwater fishes (classes 4–6). A significant positive correlation was detected between self-reported reaction and sIgE level to the corresponding fish (Pearson r = 0.809, p = 0.0151), while the level of sIgE was not related to the frequency of consumption (r = −0.214, p = 0.6112).\n\nConclusion: Based on sIgE reactivity, common edible fishes can be grouped as low (tuna, halibut and salmon), moderate (cod, herring and grouper), and high (catfish, grass carp and tilapia) allergenicity fish. Such ladder potentially provides possible strategies for reducing the number of sIgE test and for safe and gradual home re-introduction of fishes by gradually “stepping up the ladder”.\n\n[This project was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund (08191356)].\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000138\n\nThe influence of breastfeeding on the occurrence of IGE-mediated food allergy\n\nI.

Confino-Cohen1,2\n\n1Meir Medical Center, Kefar Sava, Israel; 2Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel\n\n*Presenting author: I. Lachover-Roth\n\nBackground: IgE-mediated food allergy is a growing health problem affecting up to 10% of the children. It is well established that early introduction of peanuts and eggs since 4 months of age has a preventive effect. However, there are infants that are already sensitized at that age. The leading theory for the early sensitization is exposure through the skin, especially in atopic infants. The Cow's Milk Early Exposure Trial (COMEET) study showed that continuous exposure to cow's milk formula (CMF) since birth has a preventive effect on the development of cow's milk allergy.\n\nThe current study assesses the effect of breastfeeding versus CMF feeding on the development of IgE-mediated food allergy.\n\nMethod: 1989 infants of the COMEET study were divided into three groups for the first two months of life, according to parents' feeding preference: Group 1: exclusive breastfeeding (EBF); Group 2: breastfeeding with at least one daily meal of CMF and Group 3: feeding with CMF only. All were followed with monthly questioner until the age of 12 months. When the history suggested immediate allergic reaction to food product, diagnosis was confirmed by skin test.\n\nResults: From the total of 1989 infants, 1071 were EBF (53.8%), 616 were breastfed with addition of CMF (31%), and 302 were fed by CMF only since birth (15.2%). A total of 43 infants developed IgE-mediated food allergy (cow's milk, egg, peanut, sesame, tree nuts, almonds, and soy) (2.2%); 31 in the EBF group (2.9%), 12 in the group fed by combination of breastfeeding and CMF (1.9%), and zero in the CMF feeding only group (p = 0.002). Family atopic comorbidity did not influence the results.\n\nConclusion: Breastfed infants, either exclusivly or in combination with CMF, seems to develop significantly more IgE-mediated food allergy during the first year of life. One may speculate that the mechanism is related to compounds injested by the mother and secreted in the breastmilk. Irregular or incidental exposure of the mother can cause sensitization rather than tolerance. A larger cohort is needed in order to validate these results.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000781\n\nWalnut allergy starts with high risk of anaphylaxis around toddler age: A multi-center cross-sectional study with 366 subjects\n\nS.

Ishibashi\n\nBackground: Tree nut is a common allergen in Westernized countries and often causes anaphylaxis. In addition, tree nut allergy is becoming increasingly prevalent in Japan, led by walnut allergy. In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical features of the onset of walnut allergy in the Japanese pediatric population.\n\nMethod: We conducted a multi-center cross-sectional study and retrospectively collected clinical data of children with walnut allergy from medical charts. Patients aged 0 to 15 who visited the participating institutions between 2013 and 2022, with a clear history of immediate reaction with walnut ingestion and confirmed walnut sensitization on blood tests were included. Information on the patient's initial reaction with walnut ingestion, background, allergic comorbidities, and serological data were obtained. The primary outcome was the age of the initial reaction.\n\nResults: A total of 366 patients were included in this study. The median age of the initial reaction was 42 months (interquartile range: 30–61 months). The median values of specific IgE to walnut and Jug r 1 within a year of the initial reaction were 10.5 kUA/L (interquartile range: 4.0–26.2 kUA/L) and 7.1 kUA/L (interquartile range: 3.0–21.0 kUA/L), respectively. The rate of infantile eczema, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma or recurrent wheeze, and allergic rhinitis were 69% (246/359), 59% (212/361), 27% (96/361), and 35% (118/334), respectively. History of immediate reaction to other foods prior to walnut was seen in 57% of the patients, and the most common causative foods were egg, milk, peanut, wheat, and cashew nut. Sensitization to walnut was confirmed before the initial reaction in 12% of the patients, and the initial reaction occurred during oral food challenge (OFC) in 7% of the patients. During the initial reaction, cutaneous, mucous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular symptoms were seen in 76%, 43%, 37%, 37%, and 8% of the patients, respectively. Anaphylaxis occurred in 31% of all initial reactions and in 13% of initial reactions during OFCs.\n\nConclusion: In Japanese children with walnut allergy, the initial reaction occurred most during preschool years, and anaphylaxis was common. Further investigation is required to develop a method to identify children at high risk of walnut allergy.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000894\n\nTiming of allergenic food introduction and risk of IGE-mediated food allergy: Systematic review and meta-analysis\n\nR.

Scarpone\n\nBackground: Earlier egg and peanut introduction probably reduce risk of egg or peanut allergy, but it is uncertain whether food allergy as a whole can be prevented using earlier allergenic food introduction. This study is a systematic review on timing of allergenic food introduction to the infant diet and risk of food allergy.\n\nMethod: Medline, Embase and CENTRAL were searched to December 2022. Randomized controlled trials evaluating timing of allergenic food introduction during infancy were included. Data were extracted in duplicate and synthesized using a random-effects model. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were risk of allergy to any food and withdrawal from the intervention. Secondary outcomes included allergy to specific foods.\n\nResults: Of 9283 titles screened, data were extracted from 23 eligible trials (56 reports; 13749 randomized participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence from 4 trials (3295 participants) that earlier introduction of multiple allergenic foods at 2 to 12 months (median 3 to 4 months) was associated with reduced food allergy (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33–0.74; I2 = 49%). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 5% incidence of food allergy was 26 cases (95% CI, 13–34 cases) per 1000 population. There was moderate-certainty evidence from 5 trials (4703 participants) that earlier introduction of multiple allergenic foods at 2–12 months was associated with increased withdrawal from the intervention (RR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.45–3.63; I2 = 89%). Absolute risk difference for a population with 20% withdrawal from the intervention was 258 cases (95% CI, 90–526 cases) per 1000 population. There was high-certainty evidence from 9 trials (4811 participants) that earlier introduction of egg at 3 to 6 months was associated with reduced egg allergy (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46–0.77; I2 = 0%); and high-certainty evidence from 4 trials (3796 participants) that earlier introduction of peanut at 3 to 10 months was associated with reduced peanut allergy (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19–0.51; I2 = 21%). Evidence for timing of introduction of cow's milk and risk of milk allergy was very low certainty.\n\nConclusion: Earlier introduction of multiple allergenic foods was associated with lower risk of developing food allergy, but a high rate of withdrawal from the intervention.\n\nConflicts of interest: Dr Boyle reports editorial fees from Cochrane and Wiley and expert witness fees from Taus, Cebulash and Landau.\n\n000566\n\nFollow up after baked milk introduction in cow milk allergic children\n\nM. D. Escalante-Carrero; P. Gutierrez Canales; E. Ramirez Mateo; S. Olmos Piñero; S. Terrados\n\nRamón y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain\n\n*Presenting author: M. D. Escalante-Carrero\n\nBackground: Based on cohort and retrospective studies, several authors suggested that the introduction of baked milk (BM) products into the diet may speed the resolution of milk allergies along with positive effects on quality of life and nutrition. Only recently, a controlled randomized clinical trial has been published showing that introducing BM in cow milk allergy (CMA) patients accelerates the tolerance to fresh milk (FM).\n\nThe goal of this real study is to describe the clinical and immunological evolution of the CMA patients who introduce BM into their diet after a negative challenge test.\n\nMethod: We have performed a retrospective real-life study of CMA patients, with at least one year of follow up, since the moment we confirmed BM tolerance and their introduction of BM products regularly, until the day they tolerate FM in the challenge test or until present time. We collected clinical data and specific IgE levels at different times during the follow up.\n\nResults: Thirty-eight patients were included, the median age to achieve BM tolerance was 35 months. All patients tolerated BM at home without reactions. The adherence was 95%, only two patients stopped the BM introduction. 61.11% had a negative FM challenge test, the average time required to tolerate FM was 18 months. 19.44% had a positive FM challenge test. 19.45% have not undergone a FM challenge test yet. The value of specific IgE for milk protein decreased in 84% of the cases, being statistically significant. In the rest of the cow milk fractions a decrease was observed (64%–72% of patients), without reaching a statistical significance.\n\nConclusion: The introduction of BM in our children population was safe and the majority of the patients became tolerant to FM in 12–24 months, with a decrease in cow milk IgE specific values.\n\nThis is a real life study that reinforces the idea that early introduction of BM benefits CMA patients.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\nFlash talks on food allergy treatment\n\n000191\n\nThe harmony trial: Baseline characteristics from a phase 1/2 trial of ADP101 for oral immunotherapy in children and adults with single or multiple food allergies\n\nS. Gogate1; M. L. Wang2; A. Sullivan2; N. Rabbee2; A. Dombkowski2; D. Mcclintock2\n\n1Denver, USA; 2Alladapt Immunotherapeutics, Menlo Park, USA\n\n*Presenting author: S. Gogate\n\nBackground: Use of single-allergen oral immunotherapy (OIT) in patients with food allergies is limited by the need for multiple products and the time spent in sequential rounds of therapy for those with multiple allergies. Enhanced treatment options for these patients are needed. ADP101 is a multiallergen OIT in development to treat allergy spanning the 9 major food allergen groups. ADP101 is a mixture of equal parts by protein weight of allergenic proteins from 15 foods (ie, almond, cashew, chicken's egg, codfish, cow's milk, hazelnut, peanut, pecan, pistachio, salmon, sesame, shrimp, soy, walnut, wheat). The Phase 1/2 Harmony trial (NCT04856865) is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial currently underway to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADP101 for inducing desensitization in patients with single or multiple food allergies.\n\nMethod: Eligible patients were aged 4 to 55 years and had a qualifying food allergy to 1–5 foods contained in ADP101, defined as dose-limiting symptoms on exposure to ≤100 mg on double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at screening. Nonqualifying foods were those eliciting a reaction at >100 mg but ≤1000 mg on DBPCFC. Patients were randomized to either a low-dose (1500 mg/day) or high-dose (4500 mg/day) regimen of either ADP101 or matched placebo, which included an initial up-dosing phase followed by a maintenance phase. The primary efficacy measure is the response rate, which is defined as the proportion of patients who tolerate ≥600 mg of ≥1 qualifying food without dose-limiting symptoms on exit DBPCFC. Exploratory analyses will evaluate whether allergy to nonqualifying foods responds to treatment with ADP101.\n\nResults: A total of 109 patients were screened across 16 US clinical sites, and 73 patients with single or multiple food allergies were enrolled between April-December 2021. Most participants were children (per protocol), had multiple food allergies, and had a history of anaphylaxis (Table). All 15 targeted allergens contained in ADP101 are represented as qualifying food allergies in the study cohort. Eliciting doses ranged from 1 to 100 mg, and aggregated nonpeanut allergens presented with slightly lower eliciting doses than peanut allergen (Figure). About one-third of patients had nonqualifying food allergy.\n\nConclusion: The Harmony trial will evaluate the potential of ADP101 as a multiallergen OIT to simultaneously treat patients with one or more food allergies.\n\nConflicts of interest: M-L Wang, A.

Tang2; K. Perrett2; S. Dharmage1; A. Lowe1; R. Peters2\n\n1University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia; 2Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Australia\n\n*Presenting author: R. Peters\n\nBackground: Filaggrin gene (FLG) null mutations contribute to poor skin barrier and are associated with increased risk of food allergy. It is unclear whether risk of food allergy conferred by a FLG null mutations can be attenuated by potentially modifiable factors. Knowledge of such factors can inform intervention strategies. We assessed whether breastfeeding duration, timing of solids introduction and microbial exposure (pet exposure and presence of older siblings) modified the association between FLG and food allergy.\n\nMethod: In the population-based HealthNuts study, 5276 infants aged 1 year were screened for possible food allergy by skin prick testing (SPT). Infants with SPT ≥1mm proceeded to oral food challenge (OFC). Additionally, 200 infants with 0mm SPT had OFC. At age 6 years, those with challenge-confirmed food allergy at 1 year were offered SPT and OFC to test for persistence of food allergy. This sub-study included Caucasian infants who attended the OFC clinic at age 1 year and gave blood samples which were genotyped for five common FLG mutations in Caucasian populations, (n = 423); infants who were food sensitised (SPT ≥2mm) but tolerant were excluded. Associations between FLG null mutations and food allergy were analysed using logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests were used to assess interactions.\n\nResults: FLG null mutations were associated with food allergy at both 1 (aOR 4.49 95%CI 1.33–9.12) and 6 years (aOR 3.18, 95%CI 1.10–9.19). Presence of a FLG null mutation was not strongly associated with food allergy at age 1 in children who were breastfed for ≥12 months, (aOR 1.23, 95%CI 0.39–4.61), while breastfeeding for a shorter period (<12 months) was associated with a higher risk (aOR 15.63, 95%CI 2.66–+∞). This pattern was also seen for food allergy at age 6 years. Presence FLG null mutation appeared to somewhat increased risk of food allergy at age one if they did not have a cat (aOR 2.35, 95%CI 0.86–8.06), but this association was stronger when infants were exposed to pet cats (aOR 9.08, 95%CI 1.36–+∞). There was little evidence of effect modification by exposure to pet dogs, older siblings, exclusive breastfeeding or timing of solid food introduction.\n\nConclusion: These results suggest that the risk of food allergy conferred by a FLG null mutations is potentially modifiable by breastfeeding for longer 12 months or avoiding exposure to cats in infancy. Further studies are needed to explore mechanisms and replicate these findings.\n\nConflicts of interest: MLKT has received research funding from Prota Therapeutics, is an employee of Prota Therapeutics, has received consultancy fees from Pfizer and is an inventor on patents owned by MCRI “A method for of inducing tolerance to an allergen” and “Allergy Treatment”.

Brown2; G. du Toit3\n\n1Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; 2Aimmune Therapeutics, Brisbane, USA; 3Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK\n\n*Presenting author: K. Blümchen\n\nBackground: Oral immunotherapy with defatted powder of Arachis hypogaea L., semen (peanuts) (PDAH) has demonstrated efficacy and safety in multiple phase 3 trials and is approved in Europe and the United States for the treatment of patients aged 4 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut allergy. The POSEIDON trial (NCT03736447) assessed the efficacy and safety of PDAH in younger children with peanut allergy.\n\nMethod: POSEIDON was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 3 trial involving children with peanut allergy aged 1 to <4 years. Children who developed dose-limiting symptoms after ingesting single doses of peanut protein >3 mg to ≤300 mg during a screening double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) were randomised 2:1 to daily PDAH or placebo. Participants were treated for a total of ~12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants tolerating a single ≥1000 mg dose of peanut protein during the exit DBPCFC. Secondary endpoints included symptom severity and tolerability at other peanut protein doses during exit DBPCFC. All treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded.\n\nResults: Of 146 children receiving treatment (PDAH, n = 98; placebo, n = 48), 68.4% of individuals receiving PDAH tolerated a single dose of 1000 mg peanut protein (2043 mg cumulative; vs 4.2% for placebo) at exit DBPCFC (difference, 64.2%; 95% CI, 47.0%–81.4%; p < 0.0001). A total of 61.2% of PDAH-treated patients tolerated the highest dose level assessed of 2000 mg (4043 mg cumulative) vs 2.1% for placebo (difference, 59.1%; 95% CI, 42.1%–76.2%; p < 0.0001). A total of 6 individuals (6.1%) in the PDAH group discontinued due to any AE (the majority during up-dosing) vs zero patients in the placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported by 75.5% of PDAH-treated patients vs 58.3% for placebo. All TRAEs were mild-to-moderate with no serious or severe TRAEs reported.\n\nConclusion: Treatment of peanut allergy with PDAH in children aged 1 to <4 years demonstrated a favourable safety profile and resulted in clinically relevant peanut desensitisation with the majority of PDAH-treated participants tolerating a maximum single dose of 2000 mg of peanut protein (4043 mg cumulative) during exit DBPCFC.\n\nConflicts of interest: S.T., K.

Aruva; E. Mabery; A. Kaur; J. Romero; J. Grossman; R. G. Thomas; H. B. Lowman\n\nIgGenix, Inc, South San Francisco, USA\n\n*Presenting author: D. Croote\n\nBackground: Peanut allergy is an increasingly prevalent unmet medical need that affects children and adults worldwide. The standard of care, allergen avoidance and rescue epinephrine administration, is unsatisfactory to patients and caregivers, and while advancements have been made in desensitization approaches such as oral immunotherapy, patients often suffer from frequent adverse events and face extended time horizons to treatment outcomes. Consequently, there remains a need for a safe and efficacious therapeutic with a rapid onset of action that protects against accidental allergen exposure and improves quality of life.\n\nMethod: IgGenix isolated rare IgE antibodies from peanut allergic individuals using its proprietary single-cell RNA-sequencing discovery platform technology. IgE antibodies were then re-engineered as monoclonal IgG4 antibodies and assayed for their allergen specificity, affinity, and binding epitopes. Promising candidates were advanced through lead evaluation involving in vitro plasma IgE blocking ELISAs, mast cell activation tests, ex vivo basophil activation tests, in vivo animal models, and developability assessments.\n\nResults: Antibodies discovered in an unbiased manner from numerous peanut allergic individuals preferentially bound Ara h 2 and/or Ara h 6, with a minority of antibodies binding other allergens. Antibodies specific to Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 distributed nonuniformly into a small number of epitope bins, revealing immunodominance of specific epitopes on each allergen. Nearly all antibodies were of high affinity, with many exhibiting double-digit picomolar affinity. Select antibodies, when engineered and combined, were able to inhibit allergic plasma IgE from binding recombinant Ara h 2, inhibit peanut-mediated mast cell and basophil activation, and prevent anaphylaxis mediated by oral peanut challenge in a mouse model of peanut allergy.\n\nConclusion: An unbiased human IgE discovery platform based on single-cell RNA-sequencing is a powerful foundation from which to generate high affinity IgG4 antibodies that bind to immunodominant allergens and immunodominant epitopes on those allergens. These IgG4 monoclonal antibodies can form the basis of a therapeutic candidate exhibiting strong potency and efficacy in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. This enables a new paradigm for food allergy treatment characterized by protection within days of subcutaneous administration and the absence of adverse events associated with allergen administration.\n\nConflicts of interest: All authors are are employees of, and/or stakeholders in, IgGenix, Inc.\n\n001096\n\nHazelnut cross desensitization following walnut oral immunotherapy\n\nA.

Elizur\n\nBackground: We have previously shown that 8/15 walnut-hazelnut co-allergic patients are fully cross-desensitized to hazelnut following successful walnut oral immunotherapy (OIT). We aimed to examine these findings in a large group of patients\n\nMethod: Walnut-hazelnut co-allergic patients who began walnut OIT, with a goal of full desensitization to 4000 mg protein, between July-2016 and July-2021 were analyzed. Walnut and hazelnut allergy were diagnosed based on an oral food challenge or a recent reaction. All patients underwent walnut OIT and were subsequently challenged to hazelnut again\n\nResults: A total of 82 walnut-hazelnut co-allergic patients began walnut OIT during the study period, and 77 (93.9%) were fully desensitized. Additional 4 patients were desensitized to 1200 mg protein and a single patient failed. Of those fully desensitized, 69 patients (92%) were challenged to hazelnut following OIT. Fifty-five of those patients were challenged to hazelnut before walnut OIT with a median reaction dose of 150 mg (range, 5–2400 mg) and the remaining 14 patients were diagnosed based on a recent reaction to hazelnut. Forty-six patients (66.7%) were fully desensitized to hazelnut following walnut OIT. Additional 6 patients reacted to >1000 mg hazelnut protein and the remaining 17 patients reacted to <1000 mg hazelnut protein following walnut OIT. Patients wo were cross-desensitized to hazelnut following walnut OIT had a lower median (IQR) hazelnut SPT (8 mm, 6–10 vs. 9.5 mm, 8–13.2, p = 0.045) and a higher median hazelnut reaction dose (263 mg, 120–1890 vs. 60 mm, 20–300, p = 0.005) before walnut OIT, and a lower median hazelnut SPT (6 mm, 5–7 vs. 8 mm, 6–9.5, p = 0.006) after walnut OIT compared to those who remained hazelnut allergic.\n\nConclusion: Walnut OIT induces cross-desensitization in most hazelnut co-allergic patients, particularly those with less severe hazelnut allergy at baseline. Most patients with walnut-hazelnut co-allergy would benefit from a single walnut treatment which would minimize their load of long-term consumption.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000963\n\nBeneficial effects of sublingual immunotherapy with PRU P 3 and dietary supplementation with butyrate in an anaphylactic mouse model\n\nJ.

Mayorga1,3\n\n1BIONAND, Málaga, Spain; 2University of Malaga, Málaga, Spain; 3University Regional Hospital Málaga Hospital Civil, Málaga, Spain\n\n*Presenting author: J. A. Cañas\n\nBackground: Food Allergy (FA) is as an immunological adverse reaction triggered after the ingestion of certain foods. From plant-food allergens, Pru p 3, which is a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP), is frequently involved in FA and causes severe reactions. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) with the allergenic protein is a promising treatment. Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of Pru p 3 sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in nsLTP-allergic patients; however, there are no studies about the effect of administering other dietary components, such as dietary fibre or short-chain fatty acids like butyrate. Thus, we aim to study the effects of including pectin and butyrate as dietary supplement in the treatment of allergic mice with Pru p 3-SLIT.\n\nMethod: Female Balb/c mice were intranasally sensitised for 5 weeks with 20 μg Pru p 3 plus 10 ng LPS and divided into six groups (n = 7): 1) Sensitised, Non-treated; 2) Sensitised, Pru p 3-SLIT; 3) Sensitised, Pectin; 4) Sensitised, Pectin + Pru p 3 SLIT; Sensitised, Butyrate; 6) Sensitised, Butyrate + Pru p 3 SLIT. After 8 weeks of SLIT, mice were intraperitoneally challenged with 50 μg of Pru p 3. Body temperature and clinical symptoms were annotated, and maxillary and mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen were collected and processed. Several co-stimulatory molecules from dendritic cells (DCs) and proliferative responses of lymphocyte subpopulations from spleen were evaluated by flow cytometry.\n\nResults: Mice treated with SLIT-Pru p 3, pectin and/or butyrate were partially protected from anaphylaxis after challenge. Although they showed a drop in body temperature, lower levels of clinical score were observed in these groups in comparison to untreated mice. Maxillary-DCs and mesenteric-DCs seem to show a different profile of co-stimulatory molecules. After stimulation with Pru p 3, maxillary-DCs of all treated groups reduced the CD80 and CD86 levels, whereas mesenteric-DCs had a significant decrease in CD83 marker. Moreover, mice treated with butyrate plus Pru p 3 exhibited an increase in IFN-γ+ and IL-10+ DCs levels. Finally, regulatory T cells percentage was higher in mice treated with a butyrate supplementation than in the rest of groups.\n\nConclusion: SLIT with Pru p 3 and dietary supplementation with butyrate represent a good therapeutic option for FA by inducing protection against anaphylaxis and immunological changes towards a tolerance profile.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n001269\n\nIs there a public interest on the internet about food allergies?

Cherrez-Ojeda\n\nBackground: Food allergies affect 10% of the global population and have a significant impact on quality of life. The global public's interest in food allergies is growing, and the internet, which has 63.1% global penetration, is the primary source of information. The Internet is an appealing source of information due to its ease of access and readily available information; however, not all of this information is of high quality or evidence-based. In this regard, the aim of our study is to describe what people are searching for when they think of food allergies, what terms they use, and which countries have the most interest.\n\nMethod: This is a Cross-Sectional study using 1) Google trends tool to search Seafood, Peanuts, and Milk as main topics in ten countries (Australia, Canada, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, USA) from 2012 to 2021; 2) a qualitative analysis of the main related terms, and 3) Forecasting models using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The data was obtained on Sept 25, 2022.\n\nResults: Over 400 entities related to each food allergy were gathered. Milk allergy was the most searched term in all 10 countries, followed by peanut allergy. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies were also searched including epinephrine in Singapore and milk substitutes (such as almond milk). For seafood and peanut allergies, people had a higher interest in symptoms. By 2023, we forecasted a significant increase in food allergy-related searches in Australia, the Philippines, and Singapore.\n\nConclusion: Our findings showed individuals have a greater interest in searching for milk allergy compared to other types of allergens, even though it is not the most prevalent. These results aim to collect information about the trends people exhibit when searching for food allergies, regardless of whether they have the condition or not, these results provide a foundation for future patient education tools that can empower affected individuals to engage in self-management and achieve better outcomes for their condition.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000529\n\nComparisons of cashew, pistachio, walnut, and peanut vicilin-buried peptide allergens\n\nA.

Mueller\n\nBackground: Vicilin-buried peptides (VBPs) are derived from the N-terminal leader-sequence (LS) of vicilin proteins and are receiving increasing attention as a novel class of food allergens. Characterizing the VBPs from peanuts and tree nuts may help understand comorbidity and cross-reactivity among tree nuts and legumes despite a distant evolutionary origin.\n\nMethod: Peptide microarrays were used to identify IgE-reactive sequences from the LS of the vicilin allergens from Ara h 1, Ana o 1, Jug r 2, and Pis v 3 using serum from patients diagnosed as peanut and/or walnut/pistachio/cashew allergic. The structure of four VBPs were solved using solution-NMR (cashew: AO1.1, AO1.2 and pistachio: PV3.1, PV3.2), and compared to solved VBP structures from peanut (AH1.1) and walnut (JR2.1, JR2.2, and JR2.3). Biophysical properties were assessed using in vitro proteolysis assays and circular dichroism. Hybridomas of B-cells from allergic patients were screened for cells producing IgE against VBPs.\n\nResults: IgE binding to peptides was frequently observed in the VBP domains AH1.1, AO1.1, JR2.1, and PV3.1, and not in AO1.2, JR2.2, JR2.3, PV3.2. Comparisons of structural features suggest the VBP scaffold can support cross-reactivity despite low sequence identity. The cashew VBPs are more resistant to proteolysis than the pistachio VBPs, correlating with a slight increase in prevalence. Human IgE monoclonal antibodies were discovered with specificity for AH1.1 and JR2.1.\n\nConclusion: VBPs are domains derived from vicilin allergens with variable IgE-binding prevalence in microarray data, ranging from near 100% of patient sera IgE binding (JR2.1) to less than 10%. The conserved VBP fold could allow for cross-reactivity with peanuts and tree-nuts including walnut. However, thus far, human IgE, secreting B-cells were found with high specificity exclusively for JR2.1 or AH1.1. Further research is needed to correlate the VBP IgE levels to clinical reactivity cross-reactivity.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n001666\n\nCow milk allergy after an elimination diet, in a previously tolerant child\n\nM. Zoto\n\nHygeia Hospital Tirana, Tirana, Albania\n\n*Presenting author: M. Zoto\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nBackground: Food allergy (FA) and atopic dermatitis (AD) coexist in many children, with FA considered one of AD potential triggers. Although in the forefront for decades, elimination diets are now believed to carry more risks than benefits in management of AD. We opt to bring evidence that the removal of a previously consumed food in children with AD can result in food allergy upon reintroduction.\n\nCase Report: Our patient is a 4 years old girl who has AD since infancy. At age of 7 months she had a persistent AD deterioration, and parents decided to have specific IgE measurement for most common food allergens. She had started solids and an age appropriate formula the last month, without appearance of any allergy symptoms. Despite this, the mother and her baby initiated a very restricted elimination diet, on advice from a health care provider, based on specific IgE levels resulting in multiple sensitizations to food. After elimination the AD had not improved, but nevertheless they continued the diet for several months.\n\nThe child came to our hospital at the age of 14 months, with growth failure and a severe atopic dermatitis. In the next months, after skin test and some food challenges, several foods were introduced successfully in the child's diet. Her AD condition improved gradually, with intense moisturizing treatment and on demand topical corticosteroids. The parents refused oral food challenge for cow milk and hypoallergenic formulas, because of persistent positivity in skin prick test. After one year on amino acid-based formula and soya products, the girl came in our hospital for reevaluation of milk allergy. Skin prick test to cow milk resulted in an increased reaction, from 5mm at 1.5 years old to 14mm at around 3 years old. The last year, the girl had some local reactions with urticaria and facial oedema in 2 occasions, after being kissed from her parents, who had consumed milk before.\n\nConclusions: There is a complex association between FA and AD, with evidence supporting that AD plays a role in the food allergy acquisition and not vice versa. Furthermore, elimination diets in children with multiple sensitizations to foods, have been associated with negative impacts ranging from nutritional risks, and subsequent growth failure to IgE-mediated food allergy. Health care providers should consider these risks before recommending elimination diet of well tolerated foods.\n\nJM CASE REPORTS SESSION\n\n18244\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000087\n\nEfficacy and safety of a home-based immunotherapy program for children\n\nD. Denaxa1; P. Arkwright2\n\n1Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, UK; 2Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK\n\n*Presenting author: D. Denaxa\n\nBackground: Although the standard of care for children with peanut allergy is avoidance, clinical trials using commercially prepared oral peanut products have recently started to be translated into hospital physician-supervised peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). The aim of this retrospective survey was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of peanut food products up-dosing at home as an alternative approach to OIT in maintaining and improving tolerance to peanuts.\n\nMethod: A retrospective study of clinical and laboratory data from children with peanut allergy undergoing peanut OIT with home up-dosing using peanut food products as part of routine care at a single tertiary allergy centre between 2016 and 2022. Primary outcome measures were the proportion of children (1) tolerating the equivalent of 300mg of peanut protein, (2) suffering allergic reactions, and (3) withdrawing from the program.\n\nResults: Twenty-two children with peanut allergy (18 with peanut allergy confirmed by physician observed hospital oral challenge, four additional patients with a clear history of allergic reaction to peanut but not challenged in hospital) aged 15 months to 18 years were followed for a median of 16 months. Fifteen (68%) tolerated 300mg or more of peanut protein and 13 (59%) are still engaged in the program. Nine (41%) withdrew, seven because of food aversion. Eight (36%) patients had allergic skin reactions or vomiting self-managed at home. None had respiratory symptoms indicative of anaphylaxis, required administration of intramuscular adrenaline, or needed out-of-hours / emergency care.

Nemeth1; O. Shamriz2\n\n1Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel; 2Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital, Kalman Ya'akov Man Street, Jerusalem, Israel, Jerusalem, Israel\n\n*Presenting author: O. Shamriz\n\nBackground: Besides morbidity and mortality due to anaphylactic reactions, food allergies (FA) may also have a direct impact on the patients’ social functions, academic achievements, and mental health. Herein, we aimed to analyze the association between FA and mental disorders in a nationwide cohort.\n\nMethod: A nationwide study of 603,257 Israelis diagnosed with FA and treated at the “Clalit” Health Medical Organization, Israel, in the period of 2001–2021. Univariable analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to predict different mental disorders outcomes in patients with FA. Evaluated mental disorders consisted of anxiety, bipolar, psychotic, major depression, eating, post-traumatic stress and sleeping disorders.\n\nResults: The cohort comprised of 603,257 Israelis (53.7% males) diagnosed with FA. Age groups included 0–1 (58.1%), 1–3 (27.1%), 3–18 (12.6%) and >18 years (2.2%). FA were found to be associated with an increased risk of developing anxiety (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.606, p < 0.001), major depression (1.071, p < 0.001), eating (2.069, p < 0.001), post-traumatic stress (1.412, p < 0.001) and sleeping disorders (1.468, p < 0.001). FA were not associated with increased risk of psychotic and bipolar disorders.\n\nConclusion: FA are associated with an increased risk of developing mental disorders. This allergy-mental axis should be considered in the management and treatment of patients with FA.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n001145\n\nLong-term adherence to oral immunotherapy: A 3-year retrospective, single-center cohort study\n\nM. Almog; N. Musallam; L. Epov; V. Dor; A. Kessel\n\nBnai Zion Medical Center/המרכז הרפואי בני ציון, Haifa, Israel\n\n*Presenting author: A. Kessel\n\nBackground: The frequency of adherence to oral immunotherapy (OIT) in relation to the type of allergen, patient characteristics and comorbidities, is still missing. Our aims were to evaluate and compare the adherence and safety of OIT to different food allergens in patients at the maintenance dose phase in a single center.\n\nMethod: A total of 256 caregivers of OIT patients from the Bnai Zion Medical Center, received an online questionnaire comprised of 19 items eliciting data about the food allergen, frequency of food allergen consumption, symptoms with food allergen ingestion during the maintenance phase.\n\nResults: The study included data for 213 children, 97 females (45.6%), mean age was 10.04 ± 3.5y. Of these, 62 cow's milk (CM) allergy patients (29.2%), 60 peanut allergy patients (28.2%), 54 tree-nut allergy patients (25.3%), 32 sesame allergy patients (15%) and 5 egg allergy patients (2.3%). The median length of follow-up from starting maintenance dose was 19.4 months (range 3- 48 months).\n\nOut of 186 patients who ate the allergen maintenance dose (AMD) 82 patients (38.4%) ate only the AMD, 34 patients (15.9%) ate the food allergen without limit, 15 patients (7%) stopped treatment (peanut-6, sesame-5, tree-nut-3, CM-1) and 4 patients ate the AMD irregularly. Reasons for OIT discontinuation were; anaphylaxis (5/15, 33.3%), food allergen aversion (4/15, 26.6%), social difficulty (7/15, 46.7%). Usage of Adrenalin during maintenance phase is a risk factor for stopping OIT (p = 0.0016). CM OIT had the higher rate of unlimited allergen eaters; 19 (30.6%) versus 2 sesame patients (6.25%, p = 0.006) and 4 peanuts patients (6.6%, p = 0.0006). Among patients who consumed the AMD as recommended, 62 out of 202 (30.07%) experienced food allergic reactions. Eight patients (12.9%) required adrenalin (CM- 3, peanuts-3, sesame-1, tree nut-1). More allergic reactions occurred in CM allergic patients compared to sesame and peanut allergic patients (27/61 versus 4 /28 and 14/ 55, p < 0.01). Asthma was risk factor for the occurrence of allergic reactions during maintenance phase (p = 0.02).\n\nConclusion: CM OIT patients had the higher rate of OIT adherence despite higher rate of allergic reaction and usage of adrenalin auto-injector.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000948\n\nPersistent milk and egg allergies: Different impact on quality of life in patients and caregivers\n\nN.

Freundt-Serpa\n\nBackground: Allergy to milk and egg are most common in childhood, the majority are outgrown but many persist over time affecting their quality of life. We explored the impact in Quality of Life (QoL) in children and caregivers and whether there are differences regarding food and age.\n\nMethod: Patients with persistent allergy to milk and egg invited to oral immunotherapy, were submitted before starting the therapy to a complete allergy workup that included a detailed medical history, severity grading of previous allergic reactions, skin prick test, serum specific IgE to either milk or egg and oral food challenge. Quality of Life was measured using the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire (FAQLQ) completed by patients and/or parents.\n\nDescriptive statistics included frequency and percent for qualitative variables, and median, first and third quartiles [Q1, Q3] for numerical variables. Qualitative variables were compared with χ2 or Fisher exact test. Quantitative variables were compared with Mann-Whitney test. Significant level was set at p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was done using Python v. 3.8.5.\n\nResults: We included 143 and 147 patients with persistent milk and egg allergy respectively. Baseline population descriptive information can be found in Table 1. Previous allergic reactions were of greater severity with milk (48.1% had severe reactions classified with oFASS-3) in comparison with egg (32.1%) (p = 0.02). QoL in all age groups was similar for egg and milk for the total score of FAQLQ and the different domains with the exception of “risk of accidental exposure” which was higher in egg allergic patients 8–12 years-old (4.2 [3.4, 5.3]) than in those allergic to milk of the same age (3.1 [2.1, 5.3]) (p = 0.04).\n\nQoL was also found to be worse in patients in the 8–12 years old group with a FAQLQ child form (CF) of 4.16 [2.69, 5.33] combining milk and egg subjects versus 3.19 [2.6, 4.2] in the 13–17 years old group FAQLQ teen form (TF) (p = 0.05). FAQLQ parent form had lower scores, 2.75 [2, 4.18], than children and teenagers combined, 3.72 [2.64, 4.98] (p < 0.01) (Table 1).\n\nConclusion: Persistent egg and milk allergy have important negative impact in QoL in both allergic children and parents. The impact in parent´s QoL is lesser that in children and among them the group aged 8–12 is the most negatively affected.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\nFlash talks on drug allergy I\n\n001611\n\nRapid drug desensitization in delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapeutics\n\nM. Demir1; O. Goksel1,2; N. Duman1; K. Okan1; H. S. Akten1; S. Inan1; G. Bogatekin1; O. Yildirim1; S. Ozgur2; R. Gumusburun1; T. Goksel1,2\n\n1Ege University Faculty of Medicine, İzmir, Türkiye; 2Ege University, İzmir, Türkiye\n\n*Presenting author: M. Demir\n\nBackground: Desensitization in delayed drug reactions has traditionally used slow protocols extending up to several weeks; RDD protocols have been scarcely reported.\n\nAim: We aim to present our successful RDD and outcomes in patients who developed delayed type maculopapular eruptions (MPE) due to chemotherapeutics.\n\nMethod: This is a single institution-based retrospective study. The medical record of 160 subjects with 1413 RDD cycles with chemotherapeutics between 2011 and 2022 was retrieved from Ege University Dataset. Among them, 8 patients who underwent desensitization due to delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (> 6 hours) were included in the study.\n\nResults: All skin lesions they had were maculopapular eruptions (MPE). A total of 53 RDD in total was performed with oxaliplatin (26), carboplatin (13), paclitaxel (9), docetaxel (2), liposomal doxorubicin (1), cisplatin (1), gemcitabine (1). A standard 12-step protocol described by Brigham and Women's Hospital group was used with the intravenous drugs. Three (%37.5) cases experienced a total of 8 breakthrough reactions and all of them were immediate or delayed type mild hyperemia in various parts of the body and itching during RDD. All of our patients (%100) completed all RDDs safely and successfully.\n\nConclusion: There are very few cases of delayed-type reactions to RDD with chemotherapeutics in the literature. This study presents the successful and safe 53 RDDs on delayed type MPE in eight patients. Although slower protocols tend to be more effective than rush protocols for delayed type reactions, for cancer patients RDD can be used as successfully as it is used for immediate hypersensitivity drug reactions.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000175\n\nResolution of NSAID hypersensitivity is associated with chronic spontaneous urticaria remission\n\nJ. Sanchez1; S. Diez2; L. Alvarez2; J. Restrepo2\n\n1Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia; 2University of Antioquia Ciudadela De Robledo, Medellín, Colombia\n\n*Presenting author: J. Sanchez\n\nBackground: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are one of the most common triggers for exacerbation in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) inducing hives and angioedema. Currently, it is unknown whether hypersensitivity to NSAIDs persists or disappears once the CSU patient goes into remission. The aim of this study was to determine whether remission of CSU is associated with remission of NSAID hypersensitivity.\n\nMethod: CSU patients with a positive NSAID challenge test were included and followed up. Once the patient was into CSU remission (at least 6 months without medication, hives, angioedema, or pruritus), a second NSAID challenge test was performed to evaluate the persistence of hypersensitivity. The same NSAID was used in both challenge test and observation period was 6 hours.\n\nResults: Fifty-six CSU patients were included. After CSU remission, forty-eight (86%) patients did not react during second NSAID challenge. Among the patients who tolerated the second challenge, 41 (73.2%) had not previous history of NSAID hypersensitivity before debuting with CSU. Among the 8 patients who did not tolerate challenge, 6 (75%) had hypersensitivity to NSAIDs before starting CSU.\n\nConclusion: Most of the patients with CSU remission also had remission of NSAID hypersensitivity. The onset period of NSAID hypersensitivity seems to be an important factor related to its remission. The mechanisms of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs during CSU vs hypersensitivity to drugs not associated with CSU may be different.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n001158\n\nExperiences with vaccination against COVID-19, the Allergologist's perspective and establishment of a Swedish algorithm\n\nA. Csuth1; L. Nilsson1; A. Nopp2; J. Maria3\n\n1Linköping University Hospital, Linköping, Sweden; 2Sachsska barnsjukhuset Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden; 3Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden\n\n*Presenting author: A. Csuth\n\nBackground: During the first year of mass-vaccination, suspected allergic reactions were reported more often after vaccination against COVID-19 compared to other vaccines. According to our experiences and review of the current literature, we established an algorithm with the Swedish Association for Allergology to evaluate adverse reactions after vaccination.\n\nMethod: Patients with suspected severe immediate reactions to parenteral drugs were referred to and vaccinated by allergologist without previous skin testing. Persons with suspected hypersensitivity to the vaccine excipients or immediate allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, acute urticaria/angioedema, generalized erythema) to COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated with skin prick tests to the vaccine excipients and the culprit vaccine by an allergologist. In some cases laboratory tests to vaccine excipients (IgE to polyethylene glycol MW 2,000 and 10,000 and basophil activation test) were carried out. Vaccination was offered if the evaluation did not indicate allergy to the vaccine, its excipients and the benefit outweighed the risk. Patients with late-onset urticaria with or without angioedema were evaluated by an allergologist or dermatologist. If severe skin symptoms and organ injury were ruled out the second dose of the vaccine was offered with premedication (antihistamine and/or per oral steroid). Patients with severe late-onset reactions were discussed by multidisciplinary teams, and risk vs. benefit evaluations and recommendations regarding future vaccinations were made.\n\nResults: Until now more than 40 patients with immediate reactions, including suspected anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccines, and 150 patients with suspected anaphylaxis to parenteral drugs were revaccinated without severe symptoms. No serious adverse events were observed in any patients with late onset urticaria and angioedema. Patients with more serious systemic reactions were rare and they were evaluated individually.\n\nConclusion: Immediate allergic reactions and anaphylaxis to COVID-19 vaccines are rare. Different immunological and non-immunological mechanisms (e.g. anxiety related reactions) exist that lead to a broad spectrum of adverse events. Excipients were not seen as culprits in our and other cohorts and their role is still uncertain. Establishment of an algorithm based on current research experiences facilitated the evaluation of adverse reactions after vaccination and the revaccination against COVID-19.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n001648\n\nOverview and unsuccessful outcomes of chemotherapy rapid drug desensitization\n\nO. Goksel1,2; M. Demir1; HS. Akten1; S. Inan1; K. Okan1; G. Bogatekin1; O. Yildirim1; S. Ozgur2; R. Gumusburun1; T. Goksel1,2\n\n1Ege University Faculty of Medicine, İzmir, Türkiye; 2Ege University, İzmir, Türkiye\n\n*Presenting author: O. Goksel\n\nBackground: Rapid Drug Desensitization (RDD) alters the immune response to the drug and results in temporary tolerance, allowing the patient with a severe drug hypersensitivity reaction to receiving an uninterrupted course of the medication safely. This procedure makes a significant contribution to cancer patients' survival rates in particular.\n\nMethod: This is a single institution-based retrospective study. The medical record of 160 subjects with 1413 RDD cycles with chemotherapeutics between 2011 and 2022 was retrieved from Ege University Dataset.\n\nResults: Eight patients had delayed reactions while 152 patients had immediate reactions up to six hours after exposure to the culprit drug. Skin tests were positive with the culprit agent in 41.5%, baseline tryptase level was 8.15 ng/mL (min 1.6, max 132) of 46 cases. A standard 12-step protocol described by Brigham and Women's Hospital group was used with the intravenous drugs. According to Ring and Messer anaphylaxis classification most common breakthrough reactions were Class-1 to Class-3 during RDD. A total of 316 mild to moderate reactions were managed successfully. RDD failed in 3 patients. Two had Grade 4 reactions requiring adrenaline infusion in 2nd and 3rd RDD procedures. One patient could not be overcome with persistent skin and respiratory complications despite a modified, longer 16-step protocol and chose to quit. Three patients were observed to share certain clinical/immunological and disease-related features such as Stage 4 metastatic recurrent cancer and low Karnofsky Performance Scale.\n\nConclusion: When drug desensitization is performed by experienced centers, the success rate is very high. However, as the number of treatments increased, a failure rate of 1.9% was observed in this series of 1360 chemotherapy cycles. Early identification and description of the commonly shared characteristics of failure will allow us more safety RDD procedures.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000755\n\nHypersensitivity reactions to biologic agents in patients with severe asthma\n\nI. Farinha; T. Freitas; A. Todo Bom; E. Faria\n\nCoimbra Hospital and University Centre, Coimbra, Portugal\n\n*Presenting author: I. Farinha\n\nBackground: The increasing use of biologic agents is associated with consequently an increase in hypersensitivity reactions (HR). The purpose of study was to report our data on suspicion of HR to biologics used for the treatment of severe asthma.\n\nMethod: Retrospective review of patients with symptoms of HRs to biologics. The HR were classified into immediate and non-immediate and its severity was classified according to modified Ring and Messmer grading scale. Results of skin tests (prick and intradermal (IDTs), according to ENDA/EAACI recommended concentrations) performed with the implicated biologics and polysorbate were collected. HRs were classified as confirmed based on suggestive clinical history and positive skin or drug provocation tests and as probable according to the suggestive clinical history.\n\nResults: We included 6 patients (2/3 female gender; median age: 29.5 years). Three patients experienced HRs to omalizumab and three had HSRs to mepolizumab. HRs occurred during the first infusion in one patient, the second infusion in two patients and the rest of HR occurred after various cycles of treatment. All HR were immediate and regarding severity: one patient had grade I reaction, three patients grade II and two patient grade III reaction. Clinically, the most frequent presentation were urticarial rash and respiratory symptoms. The details of allergy investigation are shown in Table 1. Positive skin tests with mepolizumab allowed confirmation of diagnosis of HR in two patients. Drug provocation test with omalizumab were performed in one patient with history of mild reaction and in one patient with negative skin test, both were positive. The diagnosis was confirmed in four patients and it remained probable in two patients. All patients stopped the culprit biologic agent, five switched to alternative biologic and one were currently controlled without biologic treatment.\n\nConclusion: The diagnosis was confirmed in majority of patients and physicians decided to discontinue the culprit biologic in all patients with suspicion of HR to that biologic agent. HR may limit the use of biologicals, leading to therapy interruption and impaired quality of life, however in our series it was possible to choose an alternative without intercurrences and without the need for drug desensitization. We emphasize the importance of standardizing diagnosing, confirming and managing of HR to biologicals and potential excipients as polysorbate.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n100289\n\nDiagnosis and management of hypersensitivity reactions to Radiocontrast media in a regional UK Allergy Centre\n\nL. Mutlu1; L. Samuel1; A. Huissoon1; R. Baretto1; MT. Krishna1,2; O. E. Mohamed1\n\n1Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UK; 2University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK\n\n*Presenting author: L. Mutlu\n\nBackground: There are 2 major groups of Radiocontrast media (RCM): iodinated contrast materials (ICMs) and Gadolinium-based RCMs (Gad-RCM). Hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to ICMs have been reported in 0.5%–3% of patients. Most RCM-induced reactions are non IgE-mediated, however, with the growing use of modern non-ionic iso-osmolar RCM, the proportion of IgE-mediated allergic reactions has increased. A recent EAACI position paper detailed the recommendations on ICM hypersensitivity management (Torres et al, 2022). Previous guidelines as well as recent large case-series support the usefulness of comprehensive allergy assessment by clinical review, skin prick tests (SPT), followed by intradermal tests (IDT) (Rosado Ingelmo et al, 2016; Nucera et al, 2022). The unanimous recommendation is avoidance of the culprit identified positive at skin testing and use of alternative agents. Negative predictive value (NPV) is now quoted > 90% (Srisuwatchari et al, 2022; Shrijivers et al, 2018). Gad-RCM allergy is considered rarer and is usually immediate (Grueber at al, 2021).\n\nMethod: Aim was to perform a retrospective critical analysis of all suspected RCM allergy cases referred to our regional specialist Allergy centre between 2010 and 2023, and correlate this to the outcomes of a systematic and standardized allergy work-up. Retrospective data extraction from clinical and electronic patient records was performed. This was registered as an anonymous local audit and ethical approval was not required.\n\nResults: We received a total of 59 referrals.\n\n42 cases were investigated systematically with skin prick testing, followed by intradermal skin tests; of those 36 cases were referred for suspected ICM allergy and 6 cases for Gad-RCM allergy.\n\n7/36 (19.4%) of the ICM cases and 3/6 (50%) of Gadolinium-based RCM cases had positive skin tests. Majority of clinical presentation for ICM allergy were benign cutaneous reactions. All 3 cases of confirmed Gad-RCM allergy had clinical history of immediate systemic reactions; 2 had anaphylaxis with elevated acute tryptase. Outcome and recommendations given were in line with the 2022 EAACI position paper: avoidance of culprit RCM and using skin-test-negative alternative with caution is advised.\n\nConclusion: RCM allergy is becoming more commonly recognised. Clinical presentation for RCM allergy had a very good correlation with skin tests suggestive of Type-1 HSR aetiology. Further long term follow-up studies are required to reliably ascertain the sensitivity, specificity and negative and positive predictive values of RCM skin tests.\n\nConflicts of interest: MTK received grants from NIHR, MRC CiC, FSA and GCRF, unrelated to this work.

Pulvirenti\n\nBackground: The preventive strategy against severe COVID-19 in Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) with antibody defects included bivalent vaccines, pre-exposure prophylaxis/treatment with SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and early antiviral therapies. In this prospective study, we aimed To assess the effectiveness of the mAbs tixagevimab/cilgavimab (AZD7442) in protecting IEI on immunoglobulins replacement during the Omicron wave.\n\nMethod: Prospective study on IEI adults on immunoglobulin replacement. Patients received AZD7442 if not infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the three months preceding. Rates of ARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, and specific anti-Spike IgG were compared between AZD7442 and no-AZD7442 groups and with recently-infected patients.\n\nResults: Six out of thirty-three (18.2%) administered AZD7442 became infected with SARSCoV-2 compared to 54/170 (31.8%) not administered AZD7442. The AZD7442 group was 85% less likely to be infected and 82% less likely to have a symptomatic disease than the no-AZD7442 group within 90 days. None who had received prophylaxis became infected within 75 days, while patients who had not received prophylaxis became infected with a constant trend over time. No mortality/hospitalization was observed. Thirty-five patients were included in the recently-infected group, which was 88% and 92% less likely to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection than the AZD7442 group and the no-AZD7442 group. Among AZD744 recipients, anti-Spike IgG serum reached the highest peak after 7 days, remained high until 150 days, and then decreased to 180 days thereafter. In the no-AZD7442 group, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 passively administered by polyvalent immunoglobulins increased over time.\n\nConclusion: AZD7442 have a protective effect during Omicron emergence in patients with IEI andantibody defects.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000151\n\nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma and wheezing disorders\n\nY. Xing; K. S. Yip; E. Yung; A. S. Y. Leung; G. Wong\n\nThe Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China\n\n*Presenting author: Y. Xing\n\nBackground: Control measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the transmission of not only SARS-CoV-2 but also common respiratory pathogens. To understand the possible influence of COVID-19 restrictions on future outbreaks of other respiratory infections, it is crucial to examine viral etiologies in susceptible populations, especially children with asthma and related wheezing disorders.\n\nMethod: This study prospectively recruited children under 18 years of age who were admitted to Prince and Wales Hospital, the designated hospital for inpatient pediatric services in Hong Kong, between September 2016 to September 2022. Discharge diagnoses included asthma exacerbations, wheezing illness, and bronchiolitis. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were obtained from patients within 12 hours after admission and were then subjected to immunofluorescence-based rapid antigen detection assay followed by respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing to detect 11 common respiratory viruses including rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza virus A, B, and C; human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and human metapneumovirus. Starting from January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR tests targeting different regions of the RdRp gene.\n\nResults: We recruited 1355 children (male 67.8%) with 1792 admissions due to wheezing disorders during the study period. The mean age (± standard deviation) at first admission was 3.5 ± 3.2 years. Compared with the pre-pandemic period (September 2016 to January 2020, 40 months), there was a remarkable reduction in wheezing admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020 to September 2022, 31 months). In particular, admissions due to “bronchiolitis” dropped from 16 cases per month pre-pandemic to 1.4 cases per month during the pandemic, with the proportion of RSV-induced cases declining from 27.8% to 11.4% (p = 0.001). In contrast, RV prevailed with a prevalence rate of 65.5% among children hospitalized for asthma and related wheezing disorders, compared with 45.4% before the pandemic (p < 0.001). After the outbreak of COVID-19, RV has caused more severe cases resulting in PICU admission than in the pre-pandemic period (52.4% vs. 19.7%, p < 0.001). An unprecedented surge of wheezing admissions, mostly caused by RV, occurred following the relaxation of local COVID-19 restrictions at the end of 2021.\n\nConclusion: RV was transmitted more efficiently during the COVID-19 pandemic, causing more severe cases in children hospitalized with wheezing disorders than other respiratory viruses. Our results indicate a rebound risk of RV infections following the easing of control measures, highlighting the need for continued surveillance of common respiratory viruses, particularly RV, once COVID-19 restrictions are no longer necessary.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n001397\n\nCOVID-19 clinical features and prognosis in italian patients with TH2 inflammation treated with biological drugs\n\nG. Sambugaro1; V. Bonato2; AG. Ledda1; E. Brambilla2; R. Scarpa2; G. Costanzo1; S. Del Giacco1; F. Cinetto2; D. Firinu1\n\n1Università degli Studi di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; 2University of Padua, Padova, Italy\n\n*Presenting author: G. Sambugaro\n\nBackground: The clinical management of chronic illnesses, particularly respiratory and allergy disorders, has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential impact of biologics on the clinical course of COVID-19 was once one of the primary worries. Given that Th2 inflammation may play a role in response to viral infections and their course, the impact of biologicals modulating this axis is potentially important in this context. In this multicenter investigation we examined the clinical course of COVID-19 in atopic patients receiving biological therapy and atopic patients not receiving biological therapy.\n\nMethod: A questionnaire was given to each patient, asking about the clinical characteristics of the infection (duration of positivity, length of symptoms, severity of symptoms and potential hospitalization, exacerbation of underlying pathology), the therapy being used at the time of infection and any changes to it, and the patient's vaccination status at the time of infection.\n\nResults: The 126 patients we enrolled (89 women) had a prevalence of asthma of 89.7%, nasal polyposis of 31%, chronic spontaneous urticaria of 10.3%, and atopic dermatitis of 5.6%. 59 participants were receiving biological therapy (anti-IgE 27.1%, anti-IL5 27.1%, anti-IL5R 20.3% and anti-IL4/IL13R 25.4%) at the time of infection. In terms of age, sex, BMI, smoking, non-biologic therapies, and OCS use, the two baseline groups were comparable. There were no significant differences between atopic patients receiving any biological therapy and atopic patients not on biologicals for the type, severity and length of symptoms or the duration of swab positivity. Patients with asthma receiving biologic therapy experienced more frequently the worsening of respiratory symptoms than those not on biologicals, although this difference was not significant. There were no significant variations in exacerbation rates comparing the different biologic drug classes. No significant differences emerged in terms of duration of positivity, type and duration of symptoms between subjects on biological and non-biological therapy who had received at least one dose of vaccine. Among unvaccinated patients, on the other hand, there was an increased number of pneumonias and hospitalizations in both groups.\n\nConclusion: Our study shows that there are no significant differences in the duration of positivity, the duration and severity of symptoms or exacerbations between the biologically treated atopic participants and the control group. In this cohort, anti-Th2 biologic therapy during COVID-19 was generally safe. Their use does not aggravate COVID-19's clinical course or outcomes. Controlled studies, registries or larger real-file studies are needed to draw firm conclusions about the safety and benefits that these biologic agents may provide during COVID-19 in specific clinical settings.\n\nConflicts of interest: The authors did not specify any links of interest.\n\n000642\n\nAccess to allergist knowledge important in improving COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence amongst people managing allergy\n\nK.

Protudjer\n\nBackground: Despite the importance of vaccines to the COVID-19 pandemic response, vaccine hesitancy persists, especially amongst people managing allergic conditions. We aimed to describe the perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy and risk amongst adults with, and parents of children with allergic conditions.\n\nMethod: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with adults with allergic conditions, and parents of children with allergic conditions, and considered differences between the two groups. We purposively recruited Canadian-based participants via social media and physical posters. All participants (including children in the latter category) had been vaccinated against COVID-19. Transcripts were analysed thematically by two researchers.\n\nResults: Participants included 3 adults, and 5 parents. Themes common to both groups included: Seeking vaccine information from sources perceived to be reputable, including government websites, allergy-specific organizations, scientific resources, medical professionals or their social media and family/friends who work in the scientific/medical field; the counterpoise theme of: Intense emotions as result of ill-advised guidance from reputable sources; and, finally, The benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.\n\nThemes unique to adults, of whom two did not have an allergist, included: Delayed vaccination due to fear of an allergic reaction, and; Lack of preparedness at vaccination sites for allergic emergencies.\n\nThemes unique to parents, whose children all had allergists, included: Involvement with an allergy community helped to ease anxieties and increase confidence in vaccination, and; Presence of a physician or allergist who is familiar with the participants allergic disease history eased anxieties and increase confidence in vaccination.\n\nConclusion: In this qualitative study of Canadian-based participants, vaccine confidence amongst adults with allergic conditions was initially shaken due to gaps in resources, professional medical advice, and representation in the literature, and which was further challenged by limited access to allergists. In contrast, parents of children with allergy reported less hesitancy and greater confidence, in part due to access to allergists, but which may have been further enhanced by a later approval of vaccines for children than adults. Enhanced communication from allergists may help diminish vaccine hesitancy amongst adults, and maintain vaccine confidence amongst parents of children with allergic conditions.\n\nConflicts of interest: Ayel Batac sits on the Manitoba/Saskatchewan Steering Committee for ImmUnity Canada.
