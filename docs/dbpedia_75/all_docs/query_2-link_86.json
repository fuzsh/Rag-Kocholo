        "text": "This paper will attempt to answer if the cultural policy in Sweden hinders audience development. Through an examination of Berndt Clavier’s article “The Cascading Metrologies of Swedish Cultural Policy” and Nobuko Kawashima’s article “Beyond the Division of Attenders vs Non-attenders” the argument will be made that the current cultural policy in Sweden reflects a Liberal Humanist viewpoint. Through this examination the paper will establish, with assistance from Anja Mølle Lindelof’s article “Audience development and its blind spot” and Nobuko Kawashima, the idea of how an authority over epistemology in relation to the cultural policy has been implemented and as a result how audience development is impacted negatively. Finally, the paper will look at the impact of how culture is segregated, the value proposition and what’s forgotten.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt some level everyone understands the importance of the arts, also defined as culture. Yet, culture is often seen as less important. This is important contradiction is essentially one of the driving factors in exploring how cultural policy, which in many ways is designed to promote culture ultimately hinders its broad adaptation. Sweden and the other Nordic countries have been fortunate enough to realize early on that one must have policies in place to promote the advancement of culture (Scavenius & Skjoldager-Nielsen, 2017), however seventy plus years after the first major cultural policy document, Sweden is still facing the same problems of getting enough people to participate in culture.\n\nWhat is Cultural Policy?\n\nCultural policy is a form of public policy (Bell & Oakley, 2014) and like any other public policy it is aimed at promoting civic engagement to develop more engaged citizens (Lindström, 2012). There are four types of public policy that can be pursued:\n\nThe Facilitator — (1) State funds the fine arts through foregone taxes, (2) reflect the changing tastes of private donors\n\nThe Patron — (1)State funds the fine arts through arm’s length arts councils, (2) responding to changing forms and styles of by the artistic community\n\nThe Architect — (1) State funds the fine arts through a Ministry or Department of Culture, (2) support art that meets community rather than professional standards of artistic excellence\n\nThe Engineer — (1) State owns all the means of artistic production, (2) reflect the changing official party line\n\nRosenstein, C. (2018)\n\nIt is ambiguous…\n\nCultural Policy is used to define the actions a government body can take in order to protect and promote cultural. It can be responsible for, but not limited to, stipulating (or encourage) funding of arts (in general or of particular activities), or the accessibility of arts (different regional locales, socio-economic strata, or educational background). These policies are typically used to develop heritage and diversity or other shared identities, however they can also be used to censor unwanted topics. Cultural Policy has emerged from two varying traditions of culture: the first steaming from monarchs looking to distinguish themselves through the pomp and circumstance related to the cultural activities; and the other through mercantilism “where patronage primarily was taken up by wealthy merchants” (Rosenstein, 2018)[i]. Currently there are four different frameworks that guide how cultural policy is shaped: The Facilitator model seeks to develop a cultural policy that promotes creativity and diversity mainly of the nonprofit or amateur cultural activities by utilizing tax donations; The Patron model provides government funds into a blind trust which can be utilized by an autonomous arts council (appointed by the government), their goal is to promote the standards of professional cultural; The Architect model has a specific governmental agency established to manage cultural activities, their goal is to use cultural activities to promote social welfare objectives; and lastly The Engineer model is where the all cultural activities are owned and controlled by the government, this is usually used to shape a specific national identify that is compliment with the hegemony of that state (Rosenstein, 2018).\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe goal of cultural policy is to promote and deepen the cultural alternatives that are not readily available in the marketplace, or to expand those cultural activities that exist but have limited access. Through cultural policy communities can further develop a sense of shared identity and promote civic engagement to further improve society.\n\nWhat is audience development?\n\nAudience development is a specific set of strategies typically employed by a cultural institution to develop and strengthen relations among their audience.\n\nIt is ambiguous…\n\nAudience development is most effective when it is integrated into the other tools of the cultural institution, including, but not limited to, marketing (to gain non-attenders who have a cultural inkling) and public relations (or taste cultivation to retain those who attend and enjoy cultural activities but also expose them to other cultural products), education (to those who normally enjoy cultural activities however where not interested in a particular cultural product) and outreach (those who don’t normally enjoy cultural activities and/or don’t have an interest), and product development. As a result, the term audience development can reflect many different meanings, including, but not limited to, Cultural Inclusion, Extended Marketing, Taste Cultivation and Audience Education (Kawashima, 2000).\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe current audience of cultural institutions is not sustainable; their numbers are dwindling and audience development is necessary not only to broaden the audience but also develop the long-term relations necessary to keep the cultural institutions thriving (Hoogland, 2017).\n\nThe next section of the paper will briefly examine the cultural policy of Sweden in a historical context, and the reminder of the paper will establish what the Liberal Humanist ideology is, relate it to cultural policy in Sweden, and connect that to the impacts of audience development.\n\nCultural Policy in Sweden\n\nThe cultural policy in Sweden originated from the traditions of the monarchs where they sought to capture some of the pomp and circumstance from larger European capitals like Paris.[ii] Later the monarchy decided culture should reflect Sweden’s identity and promote the Swedish language, as a result the Swedish Academy was established; eventually further rules were created to define culture to be based on specific political, moral and aesthetic values (Skjoldager-Nielsen, 2017). The late 18th the cultural drive began to exist outside the royal family with several successful entrepreneurs developing their own theaters however as the 19th century progressed there were several points of conflict between the royals and cultural aristocratic leading to many of the established theaters changing hands back and forth.\n\nSince then the cultural policy in Sweden follows more of the Architect model; cultural institutions are primarily funded by the government as a result the theaters do not depend on their audience (Hoogland, 2017). The initial cultural policy document in the 1930s outlined three objects: the first to protect the national heritage; the second to increase the availability of what was deemed high culture; and last was a form of education for the working class to increase awareness of culture (Skjoldager-Nielsen, 2017).\n\nIn the 1960s the cultural policy was amended recognizing the need to support the artists financially and resolve geographical inequality. This ultimately led to a formal established cultural policy in 1974 which stipulated eight conditions which was meant to guarantee the right to culture for all citizens:\n\n(1) to assist in the protection of freedom of expression and to ensure the conditions for all to use it,\n\n(2) to provide people with opportunities for creative activities and promote contacts between people,\n\n(3) to counteract the negative effects of commercialization in the cultural sector,\n\n(4) to promote decentralization of institutions and decision-making in the cultural sector,\n\n(5) to ensure that the cultural policy was taking into account the experiences and needs of neglected groups,\n\n(6) to promote cultural and artistic innovation,\n\n(7) to guarantee preservation and revitalization of the cultural heritage, and\n\n(8) to promote the exchange of cultural experiences and ideas across linguistic and national borders\n\n(Skjoldager-Nielsen, 2017)\n\nFurther adjustments were made in 1996 to further strengthen the need of education and what is considered high quality culture. The most recent changes in 2009 push for a focus on cultural heritage and a systematic shift of cultural management from the centralized state agency to more local and regional offices (Clavier & Kauppinen, 2018). The current revision of the Swedish Cultural Policy advocates a greater need of cultural funding at the local levels. It has redefined the distribution the funding for cultural actives from a bi-yearly practice to an annual practice with the national government providing 45% of the funds, the regional governments providing 15%, and local municipality providing the remaining 40% (The Government Agency for Cultural Analysis, 2018).[iii]\n\nDespite all efforts to establish a firm cultural policy that attempts to guarantee the right to culture for all citizens, there is still large parts of the population who do not visit the theater, attendance remains class-bound and rarely brings in new immigrant groups (Hoogland, 2017).\n\nThe following section will explore the concept of Liberal Humanist ideology, how it is reflected in the Swedish Cultural Policy, and ultimately how this could be the explanation of why attendance development is lacking.\n\nLiberal Humanist Ideology\n\nThe Liberal Humanist ideology is based on the notion that culture should be held above all else, simply put culture is pure altruism and moving towards this approach transcends any class divisions.\n\nBased on this ideology it is assumed people are generally interested in the arts but for pragmatic reasons are unable to attend cultural activities. As a result, the cultural policy focused on removing potential barriers to cultural activities. Starting with geographical inequality two approaches were made; first the redistribution of funds to more cultural institutions outside the capital, and the second to support touring art performances. Other barriers such as income were handled by creating new subsidies to reduce the costs of attendance to cultural activities. Physical barriers for disabled people were also addressed through new policies requiring special facilities. Finally, the last barrier mitigation involved the “dissemination of information on forthcoming events” (Kawashima, 2000) providing enough publicity to better educate the audience.\n\nThe ideology is also used in cultural policy to drive an audience development strategy promoting the notion that with enough education and exposure to high quality culture society will become more involved in culture; according to Kawashima this is the form of a ‘product-led’[iv] approach.\n\nSwedish Cultural Policy and Liberal Humanist Views\n\nSweden is in the forefront of establish a formal cultural policy and working with the UN an ensuring that the right of cultural is formally adopted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, looking at the cultural policy of Sweden we can see how it reflects the Liberal Humanist views in three key areas.\n\n(1) promote quality and artistic renewal. This first point is key at promoting the notion of high-quality culture (Olofsson, 2009) and is based on the notions that culture is the ingredient to promote civic engagement and thus improve social cohesion (Jonsson Malm & Anna, 2015). While not so overt and extreme, this is a clear connection to the notions of Liberal Humanist views that high quality culture will improve societal functions and should be made into a key focus.\n\n(2) promote everyone’s opportunity to cultural experiences. This next point is connected to the notion of removing barriers; if we only removed the physical, geographical, economic barriers the under-represented segments will attend more high-quality culture (The Swedish Arts Council, 1998). It is worth noting this point is only an agenda item for the Red-Green’s coalition (Jonsson Malm & Anna, 2015).[v]\n\n(3) promote the right to culture of children and the young. This last aspect could be connected to the notion that part of the cultural policy should focus its effects on directing audience development by simply educating the young into appreciation of art. Both sides of the Swedish political system seem to be focused on this a bit in different ways. The Alliance coalition which calls attention to the Cultural Cooperation Model and the Creative School Program. The Red-Greens push for more engagement with school children and cultural activities suggesting new programs that take place outside school as well (Jonsson Malm & Anna, 2015).\n\nEpistemology of Culture\n\nEpistemological establish the individuals’ beliefs about the nature of knowledge and the process of knowing, it is an important aspect in regulating the application of individuals’ learning behavior and understanding of the world.\n\nLooking at the Liberal Humanist views centered around the two items of education and high-quality culture as the answer to balanced hegemony of society, it can be argued that culture is something that can be clearly defined and ranked. As such an aspect of authority is created when culture is defined as either high-quality versus lower-quality, or that culture productions fit into a certain frame that can clearly identify/distinguish them from one another (Mølle Lindelof, 2015). It is these types of viewpoints that create an authority over epistemology in relation to cultural, suggesting that there is a correct ranking (and possible correct interpretation) of culture.\n\nEffects on Audience Development\n\nThe focus of the Liberal Humanist interpretation of the Swedish Cultural Policy has been to push high quality culture as a way of increasing civic engagement. Though this notion promotes an authority of epistemology of culture leading to a value proposition where high quality culture is highlighted and what’s forgotten is the cultures of ordinary people. Without the adequate cultural representation audience development will remain low and threaten the continued existence of cultural institutions that cannot solely relay on a welfare state; or in the case of a welfare state this will led to additional debates on the merits of cultural funding compared to other needs of the state.\n\nWhile the idea of removing barriers to culture is an important one, it remains to be seen if its impact on audience development is favorable; “Swedes rarely indicate lack of money as a reason for non-participation… [but rather] indicate limited choice or poor quality of the cultural activities in the place where they live as reasons for non-participation” (Jonsson Malm & Anna, 2015). Another way of arguing it is “it is the substance of culture that prevents many people from attending the arts and that the cultures of ordinary people should instead receive public money” (Kawashima, 2000).\n\nOne of the main aspects of cultural policy and its relation to audience development is through various outreach programs to essentially convert the attitudes of individuals who normally do not attend cultural actives and have no interest in doing so. However, it can be argued these viewpoints led to a sense of tribalism and a fractured sense of identity; either one is a part of the culture class and understands the correct interpretation or one is excluded. It is similar to the notions of the early twenty century where “the upper classes chose to grant access to Culture on its terms… as it was considered to be effective for civilizing these relatively uneducated people and thereby achieving social cohesion and harmony” (Kawashima, 2000).\n\nThe discourse of Swedish Cultural Policy has been primarily focused on the notion of promoting everyone’s right to culture; whether or not that this reflects improved civic engagement can be debated. However, the impacts of Swedish Cultural Policy reflecting a Liberal Humanist ideology can be observed as negatively impacting audience development. For cultural policy to make a positive difference with regards to audience development it should be focused on the more intimate level of developing a relationship between the cultural institution (or artist) and the audience (Mølle Lindelof, 2015). Cultural policy should also look to better reflect the cultural identities of ordinary people and reflect more of a ‘target-led’[vi] approach.\n\n[i] The monarch traditions evolved into the Architect and Engineer model, while mercantilism evolved into the Facilitator and Patron model.\n\n[ii] During the 17–18th century the royal family of Sweden began a practice of constructing theaters and inviting Persian performers.\n\n[iii] The only major exception was the Public Service broadcasting, which is funded by the new TV license fees.\n\n[iv] The product-led approach suggests the cultural product should remain the same and the audience should be cultivated.\n\n[v] The current affairs of the Swedish political systems are divided into two main coalitions: on the right the Alliance (gaining more support since 2006) represents traditional conservative values, and on the left the Red-Green’s represents traditional liberal values.\n\n[vi] The target-led approach suggests the cultural product should be defined by the needs of the audience.\n\nReferences\n\nBell, D., & Oakley, K.
