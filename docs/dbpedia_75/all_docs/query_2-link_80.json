This time it will be in Jämtland, and takes place in connection with a major sustainability investment in Östersund. The establishment takes place together with the company Wa3rm, which uses residual streams, for example waste heat from data centers in particular but also other industry, for greenhouses.\n\nMattias Vesterlund was interviewed by P4 Jämtland about our experiences with greenhouses and data centers. Mattias describes what we have done and how large the potential is. He talks about our own experiments over several years and the large facility being built in Boden.\n\nFind the news here: https://sverigesradio.se/avsnitt/2145001\n\nGo to 1:12:11 and listen 4 minutes."
