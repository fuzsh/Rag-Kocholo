        "text": "The Swedish paradox is mainly related to high R&D performance and supposedly low aggregate economic performance. Advocates of the Swedish paradox have not spelled out their theoretical assumptions in any detail. We show that the theoretical and empirical foundations for talking about a paradox in a strict sense are weak. In a more casual sense there may still be reason to talk of a paradox and we therefore decompose Swedish growth-problems into two competing, but also partially overlapping, sets of hypotheses. The first is related to business, and form entrepreneurial-innovation explanations, the second is related to public knowledge, and is mainly related to the organization of public knowledge production. The former set of hypotheses can more easily be investigated in data: we find that Sweden shows increasing, but still below OECD average, shares of exports in high-tech and medium-high-tech. For employment in these areas, Sweden's position is actually quite impressive. However, Sweden shows poor entrepreneurial performance with few start-ups. The role of public knowledge remains an under-researched area, although earlier evidence seems to point towards lacking business-interaction in the sense that few businesses with academic origin are being started. Thus there is an overlap with the first set of hypotheses.\n\nSeveral notions of a R&D paradox can be found in the literature. In the Swedish Paradox version, the emphasis is normally on high and growing levels of business R&D connected to comparatively low GDP growth rates. This paper examines whether this pattern is consistent over time and, more importantly, which sectors drive the aggregate patterns. Based on an investigation of the entire Swedish economy 1985-2001, there is clear evidence that the paradox occurs only in fast-growing manufacturing and service sectors. Fast-growing sectors show an increasing gap between R&D and value-added growth, while the slow-growing sectors do not. This paradox is not interpreted as a sign of failure of the national innovation system, as the largest gap would then be for the slow-growing sectors, failing to transform R&D to economic growth. The gap between R&D and GDP is consistent with the idea of diminishing marginal returns to R&D investment in high-investing sectors. The evidence does not rule out, however, that rendering the innovation system more effective could yield better outcomes. As the findings of a gap are quite consistent over time, it seems fair to conclude that businesses have good reasons for their high R&D investments, despite not being on par with their production growth.\n\nWe use a new, comprehensive database covering Swedish industry and service firms 1985-2002, to examine trends in the ratio between patenting and R&D (PR-ratio). There is a fall in PR-ratios in the long run (1985-2002) on the aggregate level and for all sectors. In general low-tech sectors perform better in terms of PR-ratios than high-tech sectors. A fall in the PR-ratio could be offset by increasing patent quality. We use two indicators of quality in this paper: forward citations and family size. The quality-adjusted PR-ratios also fall in the long run, but unlike the raw PR-ratio that falls drastically after 1997, the fall only takes place in the first half of the period (1985-1994), and then levels out. There is thus strong correlation between the Swedish economic growth performance and the quality-adjusted PR-ratios. The trend in the quality adjusted PR-ratio is mainly driven by the Paper, pulp and paper products industry together with R&D in science, engineering and medicine. We find high correlation between quality-adjusted-patents and R&D at the sector level, but not between quality- adjusted-patents and growth in value added or labour productivity.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to develop our understanding of the relationship between innovative activity and structural economic transformation in Sweden during the last twenty years. The data we explore in the paper is the result of the combination of two databases: DEVIL (Databases of Evolutionary Economic Geography in Lund) and CIDER (CIRCLE Innovation Database for Economic Research). After a literature review where we discuss some knowledge gaps concerning the relation between innovation, growth and change, we analyze the overall patterns of innovation in the Swedish economy from a technology shift perspective. We use several indicators to explore this issue, such as patent to R&D ratios, quality-adjusted patents to R&D ratios and changes in value added. We investigate sector patterns, by using a typology that divides industries into Leaders, Followers, Outphasers, Fast growing producer services and Other services. These different groups have all played different roles in the technology shift process. When it comes to R&D and patent activities, we expect different patterns for these three categories of sectors. We address questions concerning the size (and growth) of highly innovative sectors compared to more complementary sectors (i. e. sectors with derived demand) and map innovative activities within these sectors over time. This is done in order to put the high-tech sectors in a proper growth perspective and to investigate the role of these sectors (and indirectly of R&D and patents) for overall growth. The results in the paper provide a qualification both of the basic anatomy of the current Swedish technology shift process and of the concrete importance of innovative activity for economic growth. We find that R&D and patenting is highly concentrated to certain industries, and that there are extensive differences in innovation and growth patterns between our different sectors. For example. Leaders show, as the only sector, high correlation between growth and patents. Fast growing producer services show strong correlation between R&D and growth. These results are interpreted in a perspective of structural change. We also illuminate the need for complementary innovation indicators, which go also beyond quality adjusted patents."
