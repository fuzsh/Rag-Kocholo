        "text": "Victor Alexis Pestoff, is an American born Swedish political scientist. Pestoff received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from California State University at Long Beach in 1963 and defended his Ph.D. in political science at Stockholm University in 1977. He served as Assistant Professor at the Department of Political Science (1978-82) and as Associate Professor at the School of Business (1982-96) at Stockholm University. He became Associate Professor at the Department of Politics, Helsinki University in 1985 and was a Research Fellow at the Faculty of Economics in Kanazawa, Japan in 1998. He became full professor of Political Science at Södertörns högskola in 1999 and later at Mid-Sweden University in Östersund (2002). After retiring he became a Guest Professor at the Center for Civil Society Research, Ersta Sköndal Bräcke University College in Stockholm (2008 - ). He was also Adjunct Professor at Roskilde University (2014-2020) and Visiting Professor at Osaka University (2014 – 16). His selected publications include: • Co-production and Japanese Healthcare. Work Environment, Governance, Service Quality and Social Values (Routledge, 2021); ISBN 978-0-367-56737-8, */**. Healthcare in most developed countries faces a complex and partly contradictory mix of financial, social and political challenges. This volume explores a possibility to address these challenges from a new perspective that emphasizes greater collaboration between the staff and patients. It is one where professionals and patients/clients act as ‘partners to co-produce healthcare through their mutual contributions’. Japan has a unique system of two user-owned or cooperative healthcare providers with nearly 200 hospitals, 500 clinics and 50,000 beds, or more hospital beds than all of Denmark and Sweden combined. This volume compares cooperative and public healthcare providers at ten hospitals across Japan with survey data from the staff, as well as data from the patients and volunteers at four of them. It documents how and why these three providers differ from one another in terms of their work environment, service quality, governance models and the social values they promote. These findings suggest the contours of a new post-Covid model of healthcare, one based on co-production. • Co-production and Public Service Management. Citizenship, Governance and Public Service Management (Routledge, 2018); ISBN-13: 978-0-815-39504-1, */**. This volume compiles a dozen essays by one of the most prolific proponents of co-production as a solution to many of the challenges facing public services and democratic governance at the outset of the 21st century. Neither the government nor citizens can resolve them on their own, they need to work together. It discusses issues related to the successful development and implementation of a policy shift toward greater citizen participation in the design and delivery of the services they depend on in their daily lives, as well as their involvement in resolving some tenacious problems facing society today. Moreover, it explores how participatory public service management can empower the front-line staff providing public services. Together with users/citizens they can promote the democratic governance of public service provision. • New Public Governance, the Third Sector and Co-Production; V. Pestoff, T. Brandsen & B. Verschuere (eds) (Routledge, 2012); ISBN: 978-0-415-89713-6 & 978-1-138-95207-2, */**. Public management research in a variety of disciplines pays increasing attention to the role of citizens and the third sector in the provision of public services. This edited volume systematizes the growing body of academic papers and reports that focus on various aspects of co-production and its potential contribution to New Public Governance. It includes the findings of 26 authors from 11 countries in 20 chapters with an interdisciplinary focus - including business administration, policy studies, political science, public management, sociology, third sector studies, etc. In particular, it addresses the following concerns: What is the nature of co-production and what challenges does it face? How can we conceptualize co-production? How does co-production work in practice? What are the positive and negative effects of co-production? More specifically, it considers how co-production can contribute to service quality and service management in public services, and what it potentially means for growing citizen involvement and development of participative democracy. • A Democratic Architecture for the Welfare State (Routledge, 2009); ISSBN: 978-0-415-47595-2, */**. This volume addresses the need for a more democratic architecture for the European welfare state in general, and Sweden in particular. It opens new perspectives for developing alternative channels for direct citizen participation at the sub-municipal level of service provision and governance. It notes that neither democratic theory nor welfare state theory devote adequate attention to the contemporary role of the staff or third sector as service providers, nor to the need for greater citizen participation in the provision of welfare services. It shifts the focus of analysis from the input to the output side of the political system and explores new ways to promote a greater role for the third sector and more citizen participation in the provision of universal, tax financed welfare services. • Co-production. The Third Sector and Delivery of Public Services; V. Pestoff & T. Brandsen (eds) (Routledge, 2008); ISBN: 978-0-415-56856-2, **. Public management research in recent years devoted increasing attention to co-production and the role of the third sector in providing public services. This volume was the first of several subsequent international comparative studies to address these important issues in the 21st Century. It brought together nine scholars from seven countries on three continents, to discuss services like childcare, eldercare, road safety, etc. Co-production was first explored by Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues in the 1970s.; but it was overshadowed during more than two decades by New Public Management (NPM). This volume clearly contributed to re-establishing co-production as a legitimate multi-disciplinary approach to the study of public administration and management, one based on greater citizen participation in public service provision, rather than market mechanisms. The shared interest and findings of these scholars helped to spark a renewed interest in this important phenomenon and enhanced the debate by distinguishing between co-production, co-management and co-governance. • Beyond the Market and State. Social enterprise and civil democracy in a welfare society (Ashgate, 1998); ISBN: 1-84014-575-7, */**/***. This volume reports the findings of a research project called Work Environment and Cooperative Social Services (WECSS), undertaken in the early 1990s, at the outset of privatizing the Swedish welfare state. It employed survey techniques to explore the potential contribution of consumer and worker co-ops, as well as nonprofit organizations to enriching the staff’s work environment and empowering consumers. After introducing several key concepts, e.g., co-production, multi-stakeholder organizations and social auditing, it contrasts the experience of the (244) staff and (590) parents at 60 social enterprises that provide childcare in six different parts of Sweden. It explores parents’ motives for choosing one type of provider over another and compares their evaluation of the services, to derive a service profile for each type of provider. It also contrasts the staff’s experience of their work environment from the perspective of the Karasek & Theorell demand control model. Compared with municipal services, both the parents and staff claim that the service at their current cooperative provider is better, much better or very much better than what they experienced previously at municipal childcare providers. These findings suggest that there are clear benefits for both the staff and clients from cooperatizing public services rather than privatizing them. • Between Markets and Politics. Co-operatives in Sweden (Campus & Westview, 1991); ISBN: 3-593-34400-9 & 0-8133-8294-7, */**/***. This volume compares and contrasts membership participation in the three established forms of cooperatives in Sweden during the post WW II period, i.e., the consumer co-ops, the agricultural co-ops and the building and tenant co-ops. The first part employs standard social economic background factors found in survey data, in order to study member participation in more than a dozen Swedish voluntary organizations. It documents a unique pattern of participation for cooperative members. The second part shifts attention to the growth of cooperative organizations over several decades to better understand the implications of their structural developments. Both the consumer and agricultural co-ops promoted major structural reforms that resulted in greatly expanded organizations, but rapidly declining opportunities for member participation. The building and tenant co-ops, by contrast, were limited by law from doing this, so they retained much stronger membership structures and higher levels of participation. This study documents the importance of organizational size. Smaller local cooperative organizations facilitate membership participation that help make cooperative membership meaningful. *catalog record at Library of Congress, ** catalog record at Libris, Royal Library of Sweden, *** translated to Japanese.\n\nRead full bio"
