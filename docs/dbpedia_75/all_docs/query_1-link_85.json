        "text": "Methods\n\nData Sources\n\nCounty mortality data (1950–2000) from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics was used to calculate age-adjusted mortality rates (5-year age groups) for white males aged 35 years and older in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and in the rest of the U.S. (46 states). Only white subjects were included because data for nonwhites in the four states were sparse. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rural–urban continuum codes (RUCC)\n\n4\n\nEconomic Research Service. U.S. Dept. Agriculture.\n\nwere used to classify counties according to three population groups: urban counties (RUCC 1–3; metropolitan areas); less urban counties (RUCC 4–7; population ≥2500, not within metropolitan areas); and rural counties (RUCC 8, 9; completely rural or <2500 population). RUCC codes were evaluated for 1974 (first year available), 1983, and 1993. The 1974 codes then were used for further analyses because the RUCC changed little across the three time periods.\n\nData from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) agricultural census years 1930, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1950, 1954, 1959, 1964, 1969, 1974, and 1978 was used to calculate the percentage of a county’s area that was total cropland. Total cropland was defined as crops harvested plus land on which crops were planted but failed. Land in cover crops, legumes and soil-improvement grasses, cultivated summer fallow, and idle (total) cropland were excluded.\n\nCounty acreage of wheat, corn, and other crops from the USDA NASS (annual) Agricultural Statistics Data Base\n\n5\n\nU.S. Dept. Agriculture. Quick Stats: Agricultural Statistics Data Base. Available at: http://www.nass.usda.gov/Census_of_Agriculture/index.asp. Accessed August 15, 2004.\n\nwere obtained for each Agricultural Census year between 1930 and 1978. Because herbicide use on spring and durum wheat is high (>90% of acreage was treated with herbicides in the 1990s, compared to about 30% of winter wheat),\n\n6\n\nLin B.H.\n\nPadgitt M.\n\nBull L.\n\nDelvo H.\n\nShank D.\n\nTaylor H.\n\nacreage of spring and durum wheat (SDW) was combined, but winter wheat (WW) acreage was analyzed separately. Acreage of corn and other crops (OC) also were evaluated as variables.\n\nA geographic information system (GIS) was used to create data layers of census block group boundaries and population centroids from the 2000 U.S. Census, including the population of males over age 35. A data layer also was created to locate small grain crops (wheat, barley, oats, and rice) from the 1992 National Land Cover Database.\n\n8\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior.\n\nData Analysis\n\nPoisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RR) and 95% CI, adjusted for age in calendar year and 5-year groups. Prostate cancer mortality rates in the four states from 1950–2000 were compared to the rest of the U.S., in 10-year periods (1955–1964, etc.), and across the three RUCC groups. The models included terms representing the interaction between year and state (4 vs 46 states) or RUCC (urban, less urban, or rural), to determine if there was a significant difference in the annual increase of rates for the respective comparisons.\n\nFor the analyses of prostate cancer mortality and crop production, counties with <10% of the county area in crops and counties that were urban (RUCC codes 1–3) were excluded. This left 190 (of 262) counties for analysis. Among these counties, the percent of county acreage in crops ranged from 10% to 77% (59,159 to 711,239 acres). Figure 1 presents the counties included in the analyses (solid), those excluded (cross-hatched), and the quintile categories of the county prostate cancer mortality rates.\n\nSpearman’s rank correlations across the 11 Agricultural Census years (1930–1978) were high for total cropland acreage (r>0.90), SDW (r>0.83), corn (r>0.95), and OC (r>0.95), indicating that a county’s rank remained fairly constant over this time period. Correlations were lower for WW (0.34 to 0.99), likely due to the low acreage (median=411). The average acreage of each commodity over the period 1930–1978, and in earlier (1930–1950) and later (1954–1974) periods, were calculated. Because counties varied greatly in size, the average acreage of each crop type was divided by the county area. Dividing by county farmland acreage or cropland acreage resulted in percentages that were highly correlated with percentages based on the county area, so results are presented only for crops as a percent of the county area.\n\nTertiles of the percent acreage of each crop were compared to the lowest tertile. In addition, the third tertile was divided at the median. The percent acreage was evaluated as a continuous variable in linear and quadratic models. In all analyses, adjustments were made by 5-year age groups. Although the latency period of prostate cancer is not well-established, it is estimated to be approximately 20–25 years.\n\n9\n\nWatanabe K.K.\n\nKang H.K.\n\nMortality patterns among Vietnam veterans a 24-year retrospective analysis.\n\n,\n\n10\n\nAgalliu I.\n\nKriebel D.\n\nQuinn M.M.\n\nWegman D.H.\n\nEisen E.\n\nIncidence of prostate cancer in relation to time windows of exposure to metalworking fluids.\n\nTherefore, a 20-year lag was incorporated by evaluating crop production in the earlier and later periods in relation to mortality in 1950–1974 and 1975–2000, respectively.\n\nBesides evaluating crops individually, all crop types were included in the same model (additive model) to evaluate the effects of increasing the acreage of one crop, while keeping other crops constant.\n\n8\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior.\n\nThe substitution effect\n\n11\n\nKulldorff M.\n\nSinha R.\n\nChow W.\n\nRothman N.\n\nComparing odds ratios for nested subsets of dietary components.\n\nof replacing SDW with corn was evaluated by including one variable for the combined acreage in either crop (SDWC=SDW+corn) and one variable for SDW. Because the combined acreage SDWC is held fixed, an increase in SDW is offset by decreasing an equal amount of corn. The remaining crop types WW and OC were included in the model as adjustments.\n\nFor the 190 counties in the crop production analyses, a GIS was used to estimate the proximity of census block group (CBG) centroids to small grain crops. Circular buffers were created with a radius of 250, 500, 750, and 1000 m around each CBG population centroid, and whether the buffers intersected small grain crops was determined. Buffer radii were chosen to represent a range of distances of primary pesticide drift from ground and aerial spraying. For each county, the percent of males aged 35 and older living in CBGs with grain crops within each buffer distance of their respective population centroids were calculated. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the association between average county-level prostate cancer mortality rates (1975–2000) and the percent of the county population living proximate to grain crops.\n\nTo evaluate whether there was spatial auto-correlation among the prostate cancer mortality rates, both before and after adjustment for the agricultural variables, Tango’s maximized excess events test (MEET)\n\n12\n\nTango T.\n\nA test for spatial disease clustering adjusted for multiple testing.\n\nwas used, which has been shown to be robust in detecting spatial auto-correlation in count data.\n\n13\n\nSong C.\n\nKulldorff M.\n\nPower evaluation of disease clustering tests.\n\n,\n\n14\n\nKulldorff M.\n\nTango T.\n\nPark P.J.\n\nPower comparisons for disease clustering tests.\n\nCounty population centroids from the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau were used to define the geographic coordinates used by this test. Significant spatial auto-correlation in the data was not detected, either before or after adjustment for agricultural variables. Therefore, a spatial term was not included in the Poisson regression models for total cropland, SDW, WW, corn, and OC.\n\nResults\n\nFrom 1950–2000, prostate cancer mortality rates in the four northern plains states were 12% higher than rates in the other 46 U.S. states (RR=1.12; p<0.001) (Table 1). Over this period, prostate cancer mortality increased 0.32% per year for the four states, whereas the increase was 0.23% per year for the 46 other U.S. states, a statistically significant difference of 0.09% per year. Rates for the four states and the other 46 states peaked during 1985–1994 (Figure 2). Rates were significantly higher in the four states in each 10-year time period from 1955–1994 (data not shown). In 1950, there were 447 prostate cancer deaths in the four states combined, and the population of white males over 35 years of age was 1,048,921. By 2000, the number of prostate cancer deaths had increased to 880 of a population of 1,682,316.\n\nTable 1Prostate cancer mortality RR and 95% CI for annual percent increases in rates for 4 northern plains states compared with 46 other U.S. states and for urban, less urban and rural counties in the 4 states (1950–2000)\n\nComparison95% CIp-valueComparison of rates, RR 4 versus 46 states1.118(1.107–1.119)<0.001 Smaller urban versus urban1.017(0.994–1.004)0.16 Rural versus urban1.032(1.001–1.063)0.04Percent increase in rates, annual % increase 46 states0.23 4 states0.32 4 versus 46 states: difference in annual % increase0.09(0.02–0.17)0.02 Urban counties0.30 Less urban counties0.30 Rural counties0.39 Less urban versus urban: difference in annual % increase0.00(-0.17–0.16)0.99 Rural versus urban: difference in annual % increase0.09(-0.12–0.30)0.41\n\nRR, rate ratios; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.\n\nOver the 50-year period, prostate cancer mortality rates in less urban counties were not significantly different than rates in urban counties; whereas rates in rural counties were 3% higher than urban counties (RR=1.032; p=0.04), (Table 1) (Figure 3). The annual increase in mortality was 0.30% for urban counties, 0.30% for less urban counties, and 0.39% for rural counties. The 0.09% difference between rural and urban counties was not statistically significant (p=0.41).\n\nThe results for total cropland acreage and prostate cancer mortality are presented in Table 2. Overall, no increase in prostate cancer mortality rates was observed in 1950–2000 with increasing tertiles of the percentage of the county area as total cropland. Analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a nonsignificant increased RR with increasing total cropland (0.6% increase for each 10% unit increase in total cropland). Including a quadratic term in the model did not result in a statistically significant better model fit (p=0.07; data not shown). However, the two highest total cropland categories in the earlier period were associated with significantly increased mortality rates (1950–1974). Analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a 2.4% increased RR for each 10% unit increase in total cropland (p<0.001). Mortality rates in 1975–2000 were not associated with the county area in total cropland when analyzed either as a categorical or a continuous variable.\n\nTable 2Prostate cancer mortality by county area in cropland in four U.S. northern plains states\n\nPercent of county area in cropland\n\na\n\nTertiles of percent of county area in cropland, excluding counties for which <10% of county area is cropland; third tertile was split at the median.\n\nWhole period: 1930–1978 cropland versus 1950–2000 prostate cancer mortality1930–1950 cropland versus 1950–1974 prostate cancer mortality1954–1974 cropland versus 1975–2000 prostate cancer mortalityRR95% CIp-valueRR95% CIp-valueRR95% CIp-value10–<401.0001.0001.00040–601.012(0.974–1.052)0.541.063(0.993–1.139)0.0800.983(0.930–1.038)0.5360–<671.017(0.972–1.064)0.471.091(1.013–1.175)0.0200.994(0.930–1.063)0.86≥671.020(0.979–1.0630.351.130(1.052–1.214)0.0010.981(0.921–1.045)0.56Continuous\n\nb\n\nEstimate for each 10% increase in crop coverage.\n\n1.006(0.998–1.014)0.151.024(1.012–1.037)<0.0010.995(0.983–1.007)0.42\n\nRR, rate ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.\n\nOverall, no association was found between the average acreage of SDW, WW, or corn as a percent of the county area and prostate cancer mortality in 1950–2000 (Table 3). For OC, however, there was a significantly increased mortality rate in the highest category of exposure (RR=1.047; 95% CI=1.001–1.094). For the earlier period, no association was found between SDW or WW and prostate cancer mortality (1950–1974). However, for corn and OC there were statistically significant increasing rates in the two highest categories and increasing rates for each 10% unit increase in county area in each commodity (corn: RR=1.033; 95% CI=1.012–1.054; OC: RR=1.042; 95% CI=1.021–1.063). For the later period, no association was found between WW or OC and mortality in 1975–2000. For SDW there were statistically significant increased rates in the highest category (RR=1.1000; 95% CI=1.037–1.167) and a significant increase for each 10% unit increase in the county area in SDW (RR=1.042; 95% CI=1.017–1.067). In this later period, there were statistically significant decreased rates associated with increasing corn production (for each 10% unit increase: RR=0.982; 95% CI=0.971–0.994).\n\nTable 3Prostate cancer mortality associated with county area in spring and durum wheat,\n\na\n\nTertiles of percent of county area in specific crops, excluding counties for which <10% of county area is cropland; third tertile was split at the median.\n\nwinter wheat, corn, and other crops\n\nPercent of county area in cropland\n\na\n\nTertiles of percent of county area in specific crops, excluding counties for which <10% of county area is cropland; third tertile was split at the median.\n\nWhole period: 1930–1978 cropland versus 1950–2000 prostate cancer mortality1930–1950 wheat versus 1950–1974 prostate cancer mortality1954–1974 wheat versus 1975–2000 prostate cancer mortalityRR95% CIp-valueRR95% CIp-valueRR95% CIp-valueSpring and durum wheat, combined 0–<2.71.0001.0001.000 2.7–<111.0210.986–1.0570.251.0300.975–1.0880.291.0110.996–1.0590.63 11–<191.0180.971–1.0660.471.0160.947–1.0900.661.0290.970–1.0920.34 ≥191.0290.987–1.0730.180.9890.926–1.0580.761.1001.037–1.1670.002 Continuous\n\nb\n\nThe percent of county area of WW was categorized at the median.\n\n1.0160.999–1.0340.070.9930.966–1.0200.661.0421.017–1.0670.001Winter wheat\n\nc\n\nEstimate for each 10% unit increase.\n\n0–<0.11.0001.0001.000 ≥0.10.9930.964–1.0220.640.9760.928–1.0260.341.0000.958–1.0440.99 Continuous\n\nb\n\nThe percent of county area of WW was categorized at the median.\n\n1.0200.901–1.1560.710.8880.694–1.1360.361.0790.956–1.2170.22Corn 01.0001.0001.000 >0–<11.50.9490.913–0.9870.011.0120.951–1.0780.70.9220.877–0.9690.001 11.5–<230.9850.944–1.0270.481.11.032–1.1740.0040.8940.878–0.9550.001 ≥230.9760.938–1.0150.221.081.012–1.1520.020.9110.869–0.955<0.001 Continuous\n\nb\n\nThe percent of county area of WW was categorized at the median.\n\n0.9960.984–1.0080.51.0331.012–1.0540.0020.9820.971–0.9940.003Crops other than spring, durum, winter wheat, or corn 0–<21111 21–<360.9910.951–1.0330.671.0360.969–1.1070.30.9470.901–0.9950.03 36–<391.0210.977–1.0670.351.1031.014–1.1990.020.9660.910–1.0250.25 ≥391.0471.001–1.0940.041.1191.061–1.205<0.0010.9660.090–1.0250.25 Continuous\n\nb\n\nThe percent of county area of WW was categorized at the median.\n\n1.0130.999–1.0270.081.0421.021–1.063<0.0010.9910.976–1.0080.23\n\nRR, rate ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.\n\nResults for the additive model with all crop types and for the substitution effect model are presented in Table 4.

For the earlier period, there was a 32.8% increase in prostate cancer mortality (1950–1974) for each 10% unit increase in OC (RR=1.328; 95% CI=1.024–1.722). For the later crop production period, there were non-significant, elevated rates in 1975–2000 for each 10% unit increase in SDW (RR=1.239; 95% CI=0.908–1.691). Overall, the substitution effect between SDW and corn indicated a 25% increase in prostate cancer mortality in 1950–2000 for every 10% increase in SDW and concomitant decrease in corn. There was no statistically significant substitution effect for the early period. In the later period there was a significant 55% increase in mortality (1975–2000) for every 10% increase in SDW acreage (and concomitant decrease in corn).\n\nTable 4Percent of county area in cropland and specific crops, additive and substitution models\n\n1930–1978 crop versus 1950–2000 prostate cancer mortality1930–1950 crop versus 1950–1974 prostate cancer mortality1954–1974 crop versus 1975–2000 prostate cancer mortalityRR*95% CIRR95% CIRR95% CICropland1.060(0.979–1.147)1.287(1.130–1.466)0.950(0.839–1.076)Additive effects Spring and durum wheat1.104(0.866–1.410)1.053(0.723–1.536)1.239(0.908–1.691) Winter wheat3.567(0.880–14.459)0.643(0.045–9.198)2.094(0.551–7.957) Corn0.881(0.723–1.073)1.169(0.836–1.636)0.886(0.735–1.067) Other crops1.291(1.1070–1.558)1.328(1.024–1.722)1.035(0.826–1.297)Substitution effects Spring and durum versus corn1.254(1.042–1.510)0.931(0.681–1.272)1.549(1.214–1.975)\n\nEstimate for each 10% increase in county area in crop.\n\nRR, rate ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.\n\nResults for the analysis of the percent county male population aged 35 or over living within 500 m of small grain crops are presented in Table 5.
