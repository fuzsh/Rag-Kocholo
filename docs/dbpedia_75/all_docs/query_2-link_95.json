        "text": "For a myriad of reasons I would rather not delve into deeply, I'm rather fed up with my own country. Looking to move somewhere better and Sweden seems like an absolutely fantastic country as far as the values I'm looking for go, as well as having a lot of natural beauty.\n\nI've done some preliminary research into the process of making the move and just began learning the language via Duolingo, but I'm hoping I can get some help planning for the future from this sub.\n\nMy situation and capabilities:\n\nI have no college education\n\nI am an experienced (5 years) commercial driver with a Class A CDL, no restrictions and a perfect driving record.\n\nI am married, but no children or plan to have children at this time\n\nI have about $22,000 to my name that I can put toward this move at the moment.\n\nI have a very high typing speed and am generally skilled at using and troubleshooting computers, as well as being moderately well versed in the use of Excell and it's copycats.\n\nMy wife and I are both adapted to being awake at night and sleeping during the day, so the lack of sunlight during winter won't be an issue for us if we end up in northern Sweden.\n\nBoth my wife and I have very few personal possessions we intend to bring with us, pretty much limited to our PC setups. We are prepared to leave everything else behind that isn't cost effective to bring with us. We want out more than we want to cling to possessions.\n\nSpecific questions I have:\n\nWhat is the steps for making the move? I know I need to secure a job before I can get a permit for residence. I need to be a resident for five years before I can apply for citizenship.\n\nI have seen that commercial and public transit drivers are needed in Sweden, but I have no idea how to go about trying to secure a job in order to qualify for a work permit. Are there any specific websites or methods a foreigner, especially from outside of the EU, can use to apply for jobs without a permit?\n\nSimilarly, how do I go about securing a residence? I would imagine I should start with temporary housing such as an apartment or otherwise.\n\nAside from Stockholm, what are some areas that would be welcoming to immigration?\n\nI welcome any and all advice and further questions as well. I'd like to make the move as soon as possible but without rushing it, if that makes sense. I expect to run into several curves along the path leading to the move as well."
