        "text": "I’ve got a month this summer and am thinking of scratching a long term itch to do a loop of the Baltic.\n\nI’ve previously done a couple of weeks in the southern 3rd of Norway so want to see other bits now. I’m drawn to including the Lofoten Islands (albeit based on a few photos). My first instinct has been to use the TET route which mainly goes up through Sweden, then back through Finland, but this misses both the Lofoten Islands and the more mountainous stuff which I am drawn to too.\n\nI’ll be riding a Husqvarna 701, and am happy off tarmac but am wondering whether i should do a bit of the TET, then cross into Norway further north to visit Lofoten and enjoy the mountains.\n\nAnyone done this trip? Any tips/must do’s to share? Keen to learn!\n\nCheers\n\nAndy\n\nTET Sweden\n\nI have been riding the southern part of the Swedish TET. Sections 1-3 (out of 6)\n\nIt is a very nice way to do Sweden up Dalarna. Instead of using normal roads in that part. That part has the majority of the population. Further north you can use standard roads towards the Norway side. And still avoid large roads and towns. At lot of forest... Avoid the east cost. E4.\n\nSweden has a general law that forbids driving outside roads. So the TET is mainly gravel and dirt roads. Even if the surface can be tricky at times. And it does not have to be much to be classified as a \"road\" But... in some places, they have used military areas, private area or area that belongs to a motor club, To use/create hard off-road parts. They are not many or long. But.... If I would do it again, I would look for these parts and avoid them. Since I don't have an enduro machine. (Too little ground clearance for the rocks. The plate under the engine was tested.....)\n\nThere are plenty of shelters. \"Vindskydd\" in Swedish. To wild camp at. Very nice. Not even tent is needed. (All the green triangles on the map.\n\nI recommend this trail.\n\n=\n\nThe part inside the green circle, is the one I did. I think that would fit well with your plans.\n\n=\n\nI will add pictures later\n\n=\n\nSearch \"TET Sweden\" on Youtube. And you will find a lot. Look for section 1-3.\n\nAttached Thumbnails\n\nTemporaryescapee, cyclopathic and MarkusA like this.\n\nCan't speak to offroadness, but Lofoten and the coastal bits of Norway (outside of E-roads) are an absolute must. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you did a Scandinavia trip without taking that in.\n\nIf I was in your position, I would do the Swedish TET up to roughly Lycksele, then ride across the mountains to Mo i Rana and take the coastal Fv17 as far as Bodö (fast ferry to the southern point of Lofoten)... then follow the small coastal roads up to Nordkapp and take the northern section of the Norwegian TET down to the Finnish border.\n\nTemporaryescapee likes this.\n\nMore than TET\n\nI agree with Lofoten.\n\nWhen I did Nordkapp a long time ago.\n\nI entered to Norway to Trondheim from Östersund.\n\nThere are many choices. All good.\n\nI rode a more western route to Trondheim this summer.\n\nThat are smaller roads than the one to Östersund.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/1bpVceMPmTCM5PCh8\n\nThe third part of the TET ends very close to this road. (Sälen. 90 km NW of Mora)\n\nTravel story here on HU\n\nhttps://www.horizonsunlimited.com/hu...thedral-102100\n\nAs you see, my taste is nature with forest and water. Not cities and open fields. But I am happy that other people have other tastes. Else it would be crowded. And I would need to find something else\n\nThis is an outline of my route. (But not the actual route. Details are not included) To Nordkapp. Similar to your plans.\n\nOne of many options. That all will be nice.\n\nTemporaryescapee likes this.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nThinking about traveling?

To keep it going and a roof over our heads, we run events all over the world with the help of volunteers; we sell inspirational and informative DVDs; we have a few selected advertisers; and we make a small amount from memberships.\n\nYou don't have to be a Member to come to an HU meeting, access the website, or ask questions on the HUBB. What you get for your membership contribution is our sincere gratitude, good karma and knowing that you're helping to keep the motorcycle travel dream alive. Contributing Members and Gold Members do get additional features on the HUBB. Here's a list of all the Member benefits on the HUBB."
