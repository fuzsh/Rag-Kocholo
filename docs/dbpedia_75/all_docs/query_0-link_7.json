In this article, we set out to conduct an analysis of Swedish civil–military relations over a period of more than twenty-five years from 1984 to 2011. Our analysis is made from the perspective of civil–military control of (1) the military officer rank system and (2) the professional officer education system, for all three services. The analysis is based on Samuel Huntington’s and Morris Janowitz’s theoretical discussion of “objective” and “subjective” civilian control over the military and will give answers on how the Swedish armed forces have been effected by objective and subjective civilian control during the late Cold War era and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The findings of this study confirm the assumption that civil–military relations vary over time because of perceived external threats but also because of new threats, new tasks, and increased globalization and cooperation in multinational international operations.\n\nIn Sweden, like in other Western societies, civil–military relations and the autonomy of the military profession have varied over time. During periods when external threats are perceived to be high, as in World War II, military autonomy is higher than during periods when threats are perceived to be lower, as was the case after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 19891 or, as Peter Feaver puts it, “the civil–military conflict ebbs and flows, and so the perception of the threat.”2 The Swedish case is in some significant aspects quite different from most European countries and the United States. First, Sweden has had an extremely long history (almost 200 years)3 without any war, meaning that external threats have often been perceived to be quite low.4 Second, since 1905, Swedish foreign affairs and security policy has been built on freedom from military alliances and neutrality in war, which has made it possible for Sweden to stay away from any war and conflicts without any binding military or political obligations to other countries.5 Since the beginning of 2000, Swedish security policy has undergone quite a radical change and become much more focused on participation in multinational international missions in cooperation with other nations under the framework of the United Nation (UN), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), or European Union (EU).6 Two major consequences of this increased cooperation in multinational military operations are that the Swedish armed forces have real military objectives and tasks to solve and need to become interoperable with other nations' armed forces.\n\nKey factors when analyzing civil–military relations and the autonomy of the military profession are the degree of autonomous control over the professional organizational structure, professional competence, and professional officer education system.7 The professional education system is especially important because it is through this system and training that the military can effectively transmit formal and informal knowledge and acceptance for its institutional rules regarding organizational structures and professional competence.8 If the military loses control over its professional education system, it also loses much control over what counts as professional competence.\n\nIn this article, we set out to conduct an analysis of Swedish civil–military relations over a period of more than twenty-five years from 1984 to 2011. Our analysis is made from the perspective of civil–military control of (1) the military officer rank system and (2) the professional officer education system, for all three services. The analysis is based on Samuel Huntington’s and Morris Janowitz’s theoretical discussion of “objective” and “subjective” civilian control over the military9 and will give answers on how the Swedish armed forces have been affected by objective and subjective civilian control during the late Cold War era and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nCivil–Military Relations\n\nThe central problem in civil–military relation theory has been to find out and explain how civilian control over the military is established and maintained in a sovereign nation, a question that also reflects a strong normative desired standpoint of civilian political control over the military establishment.10 In political and social science, there has been a long-standing theoretical debate in the field of civil–military relations, originating from Samuel Huntington and Morris Janowitz in the late 1950s with Huntington’s book The Soldier and the State (1957) and followed up three years later by Janowitz in his book The Professional Soldier (1960).11 The core of the discussion was to define the most appropriate civilian control over the military: “[…] an appropriate equilibrium between the power of the military and the ideology of society.”12 The challenge and dilemma was (and still is) to find a solution to the problem of reconciling a strong military, able to do anything civilians ask of them, with a military subordinate enough to do only what civilians authorize them to do. Peter Feaver describes it as a paradox, “The civil–military relationship is a simple paradox: because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we create for protection.”13 The main theoretical problem was to find a solution to maintain an effective and powerful military that sustains and protects democratic values. The core of the debate between Samuel Huntington and Morris Janowitz focused on two possible types of civilian control over the military: objective and subjective civilian control.14\n\nObjective Civilian Control\n\nHuntington recognized a tension between the desires for civilian control and a need for military security, that is, that efforts to enhance civilian control over the military might decrease the latter’s ability to be an effective fighting force. Huntington’s solution for this tension was objective civilian control, a theory that rests on liberal theory, the first priority of which is to protect the democracy, democratic values, and liberties of individual citizens within a sovereign nation. Huntington advocated an autonomous and political neutral military profession and according to him, objective civilian control could simultaneously maximize military subordination and military fighting power. “Objective civilian control not only reduces the power of the military to the lowest possible level vis-à-vis all civilian groups, it also maximizes the likelihood of achieving military security.”15 The primary aim of the objective civilian control mechanism is the recognition of an autonomous military professionalism and respect for an independent military sphere of action and professional development. Civilians should dictate the military security policies and the military should be free to autonomously decide over military actions and the military establishment. In summary, with objective civilian control, the civilian authorities have control over the military as the state’s institution and tool for military security but the military itself has control over the military sphere and the development of the profession’s professionalism.\n\nSubjective Civilian Control\n\nJanowitz was, from a civic republican theory perspective, concerned with how to sustain democratic values and practice in the military, beginning with his concept of the constabulary force and cultivating the ideal of the citizen–soldier.16 The civic republican theory gives priority to engaging citizens in the activity of all parts of public life, which also includes participation in the military defense of the nation. The citizen–soldier ideal rests on the constabulary force concept which, according to Janowitz, provides continuity with past military experiences and traditions but also offers a basis for radical adaptation of the profession.17 According to him, the constabulary force should recognize that military means must be carefully adjusted to the political objective pursued. The constabulary force should be “committed to the reasoned use of force in support of ‘viable international relations' in a situation in which there are no clear distinctions between war and peace or between military and political actions.”18 This radical adaptation caused Janowitz, as opposed to Huntington, to advocate greater civilian oversight at many levels of military affairs and more integration of civilian and democratic values and lifestyles in the military but also sound military integration and participation in civilian and political life. Janowitz recommended, for example, that the military should maintain contact with universities, sending officers for advanced professional training and even having their own small cadre of PhDs.19 Janowitz advocated subjective civilian control as establishing primacy of the civilian democratic society over the military. Maximum subjective civilian control includes control over the military establishment, both as an institution and as a profession. The struggle of power between subjective and objective control can be expressed in Michael Desch’s words, “The best indicator of the strength of civilian control is who prevails when civilian and military preferences diverge.”20\n\nSome Flaws in the Objective and Subjective Civilian Control Theories\n\nThe theories of Huntington and Janowitz have been used by researchers on civil–military relations during the last five decades.21 However, their theories are, after the Cold War, limited and flawed in important respects as James Burk point outs in his article, “Theories of Democratic Civil–Military Relations.”22\n\nYet there are reasons to doubt whether these two theories, developed in response to the new circumstances of the Cold War, are well applied to the contemporary situation. There is a sense that their value is limited and that new frameworks are required to guide future research. (p. 9)\n\nHuntington’s presumption of a clearly delineated military sphere independent of the social and political sphere is not valid in a world with weapons of mass destruction. Mass armies have declined 23 and in the last two decades, considerable downsizing has meant Western armed forces have become much smaller but equipped with more advanced technology and weapons with a potential for mass destruction over national borders. This means the political and military spheres are no longer clear-cut, and consequently, there cannot be any clear distinction between political ends and military means.24\n\nThe subjective and objective civilian control theories merely intended to explain how to protect and sustain democratic values within a sovereign state, not how to protect and sustain democratic values in a transnational context. When democratic nations participate in multinational military and political alliances and operations it gives rise to problems that Huntington’s and Janowitz’s theories did not address. These pay attention to either protecting democratic values (Huntington) or sustaining democratic values within a sovereign nation (Janowitz). The new global security situations and circumstances for military activities demand a new civil–military theory that addresses the need to both protect and sustain democratic values within and beyond the nation state.25\n\nAnother current civil–military relations issue has arisen from the abolition of conscription in many European countries,26 which increases the risk of widening the gap in terms of trust between citizens and the military, and calls for a reassessment of identity, self-images, values, and attitudes within the military itself. For example, the research project conducted by Peter Feaver and Richard H, Kohn reveals that for civilian elites with no experience of military service, confidence in the military drops quite significantly with the abolition of conscription. Conversely, military elites develop more negative perceptions of civilian society.27 Such indicators of an increased gap between the military and civilians also impacts negatively on the armed forces' ability to recruit and retain enough soldiers and officers.28\n\nSome scholars, such as Arthur D. Larson and Charles Moskos29 discuss the possibility of military pluralism in which some elements are more divergent and others more convergent with respect to civilian society. Divergence would be most marked in combat units and higher command levels where the traditional ideals and practices of military professionalism would be cultivated. Convergence would be most significant in administrative, educational, medical, logistical, and technical units, which are not uniquely military. These areas would be allowed to become more “civilianized.” Military pluralism is an attempt to find a third way of civil–military control and bridge the gap between the objective and subjective.\n\nA further flaw in Huntington’s and Janowitz’s civil–military theories relates to the problems of globalization and internationalization of military activities and operations. For example, increased military cooperation in multinational operations can give rise to tension between forces from different countries with different political mandates, rules of engagements, and operational caveats.30 Multinational military operations under the umbrella of UN, NATO, and EU also include decisions on military actions and use of force that are not just a matter for single states and governments but for all nations belonging to these organizations.\n\nCivil–military relations within sovereign nations are also affected by membership in the UN, NATO, and EU. For example NATO prescribes well-established democratic values for states seeking NATO membership and the EU tries to create and impose international standards on members' states in regard to civil–military relations.31 With the aim of increasing interoperability between troops from different countries on UN missions, the UN provides predeployment training and preparation. This includes training in the UN guidelines of conduct and an interlocking system of peacekeeping capacities that enables UN troops to work with relevant military and civil organizations, as well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in a predictable and reliable way.32 These new forms of cooperation in military operations under UN, NATO, and EU might therefore have considerable impact on civil–military relations in democratic sovereign states in terms of subjective and objective civilian control.\n\nAlthough Huntington’s and Janowitz’s civil–military theories are flawed in more respects than the ways described,33 they do have special significant merits in terms of the specific analysis made in this article, namely, the functional and societal imperative aspects of civil–military control. The functional and societal imperatives are still valid in theories on civil–military relations when it comes to questions of create a functional military that can both protect and sustain democratic values.34\n\nFunctional and Societal Imperative\n\nAccording to Huntington, military institutions and civil–military relations are shaped by two forces, that of functional and societal imperatives.35 The former refers to threats to society’s security and the latter to societal forces, ideologies, and institutions dominant within society. During periods when external threats are perceived to be low, the functional imperative of security is weaker. In such periods, the societal imperative of liberal and democratic countries often fuels an ideology which favors the virtual elimination of military forces and a reduction in professional autonomy.36 When external threats are perceived to be high, the functional imperative of military security becomes stronger and the autonomy of the military profession increases.37\n\nWhen external threats are perceived to be high, the degree of objective civilian control increases and the military can focus on developing professional competence from a functional imperative, with the aim of effectively solving military tasks and operations. When external threats are perceived to be low, objective civilian control decreases, while subjective civilian control increases. During these periods, the military has to adapt to the societal imperative and develop its professional organizational structure, professional competence, and education system to be more convergent with the values of civilian society.\n\nThe functional and societal imperative aspects of subjective and objective civil–military control will be the theoretical lenses used in this article when analyzing civil–military control over the officer rank and professional officer education system.\n\nDefense Reforms and Inquiries from 1984 to 2011\n\nAnalysis of the Swedish civil–military relationship in this article will be based on five decisive defense reforms and three inquiries regarding the Swedish officer rank system, the human resource system, and the officer education system.\n\n1984—The new Officer System (NBS) reform\n\n1999—The new Officer Education Programme reform\n\n2001—The Governmental Human Resource inquiry\n\n2003—The Governmental School Reform inquiry\n\n2004—The Swedish National Defence College (SNDC) inquiry\n\n2008—The accredited Academic Officer Programme reform\n\n2010—Transformation to all-volunteer force (AVF) and a differentiated Officer Rank System reform\n\n2011—A new education system reform in the armed forces\n\nThe analysis focuses on civil–military control of the officer rank system and the professional officer education system with the aim of investigating whether the reform or inquiry is biased toward objective civil–military control with a functional imperative or subjective civil–military control with a societal imperative. By contextualizing each reform and inquiry from the perspective of real or perceived external threat during the historical period in which the reform or inquiry was made, it should, with reference to Huntington’s theory, be possible to interpret and understand why reform is biased in a certain direction.\n\nBefore the officers rank reform in 1984, the Swedish armed forces had three different bands of ranks which were quite similar to the armed forces bands of ranks of United States and Western Europe. The lowest band was Noncommissioned Officers (NCOs), the second Warrant Officers, and the third and the highest band of rank was Commissioned Officers.38\n\n1984—The NBS Reform\n\nIn 1984, the Swedish armed forces implemented a completely new and probably world-unique officer rank system: the New Officer System (NBS).39 The most apparent and controversial aspect of the NBS reform was the abolition of NCOs and Warrant Officers. From the entry of NBS, the armed forces had just the one category of rank, the Commissioned Officers, with the lowest rank of second lieutenant.40 During the first six to eight years of their career, these officers had to work in positions equivalent to NCO positions and perform NCO tasks.\n\nThe basic idea behind the NBS reform was that all officers should be selected and recruited among the young men and women who were conscripted in the same way and then qualified in the same Officer Education Programs. All of them could potentially become generals. The government put strong emphasis on increased integration of democratic and civil values in the military and stressed that Sweden should not compare itself with other countries—because of its neutrality. Sweden did not need to become interoperable with other countries' armed forces officer education or bands of rank.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe NBS reform in 1984 was a significant step toward increased subjective civilian control based on societal imperative over the military profession. NBS was created during a historical time when Swedish politicians assessed external threats to be low.41 Indeed, threats from the Soviet Union still existed but were not perceived as especially apparent. This situation resulted in an increased societal imperative with a strong Social Democratic political and ideological profile.42 The NBS reform was largely an ideological political equality mission aimed at eliminating one of the last remnants of an old Swedish hierarchical society built on social classes. A way of subjective control aiming to, in a “Janowitzian” way, impose current integration of civilian political, democratic values, and ideologies on the military. However, the political NBS project was never fully accepted among the officers in the Swedish armed forces.43\n\n1999—The New Officer Education Programme Reform\n\nAs a consequence of the NBS reform with its new officers rank system, the armed forces required a completely new Officer Education system. The first two new Officer Programs after the entry of NBS were Officer College 1 and 2, and then Officer 2000, which were both still divided into the different services and branches within the Army, Air Force, and the Navy, and included extensive “on-the-job training” at the units.44 In 1999, the armed forces introduced a two-year long Officer Program45 available in only three locations,46 in contrast to the previous arrangement where every service and branch had its own schools spread all over the country.47 One major difference between the new Officer Program and former officer programs was the element of joint service. The first academic year involved joint service divided into two parts: a twenty-week Joint Service Training Program which rendered twenty credits, and a twenty-week Joint Branch Training Program rendering another twenty credits. In the second academic year, the cadets split up to spend forty weeks on the relevant service training program related to their future military positions at service and branch specialist schools and units around the country.48 Another major condition for the creation of the new Officer Program was that, in common with many other officer programs in Europe,49 it should have a more academic approach50 with much more focus on a broader, general education including civilian subjects such as political sciences, sociology, leadership and less emphasis on specific branch and position knowledge, practical skills and competences. The intention was that the units should arrange local programs so that the new second lieutenants could utilize their specific position knowledge, skills, and competences after they finished the Officer Program.51 Significantly, the on-the-job training, which is the most highly regarded and most central part of all armed forces training,52 was from then on eliminated. Another outcome for the military was that the new Officer Program did not produce second lieutenants with enough military position skills and competences to fulfill their roles after qualifying.53\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe implementation of a new Officer Program in 1999 was a second significant step toward increased subjective civilian control based on societal imperatives of increased civilian integration in the military establishment. Suddenly, the armed forces had an officer rank system and basic officer education system characterized by almost the opposite of its historical traditions and perceived needs. Historically speaking, this point in time signified the peak of subjective civilian control over the Swedish military thus far in regard to these two issues. One major reason for these unique reforms to the Swedish military rank system and officer education programs must have been the unexpected political and military scenario after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. At this time, the Swedish armed forces were still entirely focused on and organized for defending Sweden’s borders. When enemies or external threats to Swedish security and national boundaries now suddenly ceased to exist, it was wide open for the societal imperative to grow with almost no resistance or limits.54 The armed forces became more of a civilian bureaucratic career organization than a military force created for using and directing violence for the security of the state.55 As a result, the officer rank system and the Officer Program were more geared to reflect political ideologies and values of equality than to be useful and effective to the armed forces in solving their military tasks.\n\n2001—The Governmental Human Resource Inquiry\n\nIn February 2001, the human resource inquiry appointed by the Social Democratic government presented its findings.56 The main task for the committee was to present a comprehensive analysis of the armed forces' human resource system. One of the government’s guidelines directing the committee’s work was their aspiration to increased ethnic and cultural diversity and gender equality in the military. Another purpose of the inquiry was to consider standards for the Swedish armed forces' participation in international operations along with other nations' armed forces and to evaluate the current officer education system in the light of those standards. The inquiry concluded that the current Swedish armed forces did not correspond to the global political and military situation and that the main task for the armed forces should shift from a defense of Swedish borders to international operations within the framework of the UN. To be able to meet the standards of these new circumstances and to become interoperable with other nations' armed forces, the committee suggested the creation of both a new organization and a new education system for the armed forces.\n\nThe committee also had extensive discussions regarding the officer rank system and strongly rejected a return to the former, old-fashioned multirank officer system with NCOs, Warrant Officers, and Commissioned Officers. Instead, they supported the existing officer rank system with the added implementation of a multicareer system with two officer categories: NCOs57 and Officers.58 The opportunity to advance on these two career paths had to be equal. This new officer rank system was just a suggestion from the inquiry and was not decided and implemented at this time. The committee also suggested that the Officer Program should provide the same number of educational credits as a three-year civilian university program.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe human resource inquiry, which presented their findings almost eight months before 9/11, had made recognition of the need to cooperate and become more interoperable with other nations' armed forces. The main reason for that was said to be a new global political and military situation which had shifted the main task of the armed forces from the defense of Swedish borders to international operations within the framework of the UN. This was a step toward more objective civilian control with stronger emphasis on the functional imperative. The discussion of implementation of a multicareer system with two categories of officers (NCOs and Officers) was also a clear step toward objective civilian control based on the functional imperative.\n\nThe emphasis on increased ethnic and cultural diversity and gender equality in the military is an example of subjective civilian control based on societal imperative, as is the suggestion that the Officer Program should provide the same number of educational credits as a three-year civilian university program.\n\n2003—The Governmental School Reform Inquiry\n\nIn May 2003, the governmental School Reform inquiry came to an end. The committee’s task had been to analyze the armed forces' long-term competence requirements and suggest improvements to the military school system, supporting these requirements, and to compare the status of the Officer Program with civilian university programs. In contrast to government committees of previous years (1973–1984), this committee stressed the importance of comparison with other relevant nations' systems for officer education. Other important guidelines for the inquiry included increased gender perspective, along with ethnic and cultural integration.59\n\nThe government committee revealed that the existing officer education system greatly reduced the professionalization of its officers and did not produce new officers with the right professional competences to fulfill work duties at their units without further and prolonged in situ training programs. Further disclosed was the need for greater harmonization with other relevant countries' military education systems60 in view of Sweden’s increased participation in international operations. Thus, in order to gain higher national and international status, secure a consistently high quality of education and link it with research, the Swedish Officer Programme had to become academic—as it had in many comparable European countries.61\n\nIn view of the armed forces' changed focus from defending Sweden’s borders to participating in international operations, the military career system had to be changed to one more internationally interoperable and appropriate to the task. This would entail producing a greater number of specialists and fewer generalists and also require more flexibility in course duration, content, and standards for admission, as well as different recruitment categories.62 The armed forces' increased cooperation with civilian authorities and NGOs in different national and international operations requires officers to be cultivated and well educated in a broader sense and not just in military subjects.63\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe governmental School Reform inquiry stated that the military officer education system greatly reduced the professionalization of its officers and did not produce new officers with the right professional competences. This statement is based on a functional imperative, that is, the officers' ability to meet required task competence in international operations together with other nations' armed forces. To increase interoperability, there was a need for greater harmonization with other relevant countries' officer education systems. This need for harmonization with other nations' armed forces and other relevant countries' officer education systems basically stemmed from the perspective of changed focus from defending Sweden’s borders to participating in international operations. The School Reform inquiry also recommended a career system which was more internationally interoperable and appropriate to international tasks, with a greater number of specialists and fewer generalists. The issue of a more academic Officer Program was now within a new framework of military functionality and quality, compared to the previous one, which focused on similarity with civilian universities. At the same time, the inquiry highlighted a need for well-educated officers in a broader sense than just military subjects because of increased cooperation with civilian authorities and NGOs. A remnant of subjective civilian control on societal imperative is the recommendation of increased gender perspective along with ethnic and cultural integration.\n\n2004—The SNDC Inquiry\n\nIn May 2004, the SNDC inquiry strongly emphasized the importance of making SNDC an authentic university with accredited exam authority.64 The arguments for this recommendation were almost the same as those of the government committee the year before, that is, to gain higher national and international status, secure a consistently high quality of education and link it to research, harmonize the military program with those of other European countries, and facilitate contribution to international security work in a credible way. The committee especially expressed the need for an international exchange program for officers and teachers.65\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe SNDC inquiry’s suggestions go in two directions. On one hand, it suggests a fully accredited academic Officers Program, leaning toward subjective civilian control and societal imperative with integration of civilian standards for education under university regulations and laws. On the other hand, the arguments for an accredited Officers Program leans toward objective civilian control, with the functional arguments of harmonizing the officer program with those of other European countries and facilitating contribution to international security work in a credible way and addressing the need for an international exchange program for officers and teachers.\n\n2008—The Accredited Academic Officer Programme Reform\n\nFor the first time in Swedish history in January 2008, SNDC became an accredited university under the umbrella of both the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education and Research, responsible for a three-year Officer Program qualifying in a bachelor degree. Of the total 180 points, the program contained 120 points of academic studies including an individual essay, the remaining 60 points being obtained at each of the services' specialized branch schools. The program did not contain any “on-the-job training.”66 The regulations stipulated that an examiner should be at least PhD qualified (which excluded almost all officers) and that the examinations and examination tasks should follow university laws and regulations, which in many cases were quite alien to military teachers at the academies and to the armed forces in general. Although the military has lost a great deal of control over the Officer Program, it still has substantial influence on the program and the cadets. SNDC is the head of all Officer Programs67, the “Directorate for Officers' Academic Education” being responsible and including members of high military rank such as a Brigadier General, Colonels, and Lieutenant Colonels. Their main function is to represent the armed forces' interests at SNDC and on the three officer programs.68\n\nAt all the military academies where the accredited Officer Programmes take place, the military have a parallel military structure to ensure their interests. Every year, the cadets at the academies are organized in a cadet battalion structure with companies, platoons, and squads, under the authority of the military Commander of the academy.69 The platoon leaders are responsible for evaluating and discussing the cadets' individual developments in a broader sense than just their academic advancement under what is known as the “commander and individual development program.” A wide range of extracurricular military activities and programs are also arranged every year.\n\nAnalysis\n\nA significant step toward increased subjective civilian control came in 2008, with the implementation of the first Swedish accredited Officer Programme, which was still mainly based on societal imperatives such as gender equalities and ethnic and cultural integration but also on functional imperatives such as increased ability to cooperate with other nations' armed forces in international operations and compatibility with the university system and the officer programs of other nations. The most important change for the armed forces when the Officer Program became accredited was that the military lost almost all their control and power over the Officer Program. From that moment, the university took over control and the military were forced to accept university laws and a regulation, even when these strongly opposed and violated the latter’s opinions and traditions.\n\n2010—Transformation to an AVF and Differentiated Officer Rank System\n\nWhen the Swedish Parliament accepted the proposition “A useful defence” on June 16, 2009, it became a historic date in Sweden and in the history of the Swedish armed forces.70 In its proposition, the government stressed the need for increased cooperation in international operations and other security issues. The government considered threats to peace and security would be best averted in collaboration with other nations in the framework of the UN, NATO, and EU, which will also allow for the implementation of concepts, doctrines, and standards that facilitate cooperation and interoperability.71 Sweden should be able to command a multinational brigade in multinational operations. The most revolutionary element of this political decision was first, the abolition of the conscription system and a transformation to an AVF and, second, the decision to implement a differentiated officer system.72 After twenty-five years of a unique one-category officer system without NCOs and Warrant Officers, it was time to return to a differentiated officer system comprising two categories, that of NCOs and Officers.73 The new system also comprises personnel categories for squad leaders, soldiers, and seamen. The officer rank reform was largely motivated by the fact that it was essential to increase the effectiveness of the officer resource system and produce a higher number of specialists with sound professional knowledge, something that was almost impossible with a one-category Officer system geared to a career as a generalist and commander.74 From July 1, 2010, more than one hundred years of the conscription system came to an end.75\n\nAnalysis\n\nBoth the transformation to an AVF and the invention of a new, differentiated officers system are significant steps toward objective civilian control with strong implications for a functional imperative. Both reforms were aimed at transforming and adapting the Swedish armed forces for increased ability to cooperate with other nation’s armed forces in international and multinational operations, that is, increasing its military functionality.\n\n2011—A New Education System Reform in the Armed Forces\n\nThe last reform analyzed in this article, and also the latest defense reform in Sweden so far, is the adoption of a new military education system.76 The implementation of an AVF and the new officer rank system has necessitated the creation of a new military education system. In the new education system, anyone who wants to join the military has to apply for a three-month long basic military training program. When they have passed this training program and are deemed suitable, they can decide whether they want to join the home guard or seek employment as an Officer, NCO, soldier, airman, or seaman. Once accepted for employment, they will continue their training on different military programs, according to the position for which they are accepted. At the moment, the profile of the new Officer Program for officers seems to be the same as that of the current system described above, that is, under the authority of university laws and regulations and with powerful subjective civilian control. All other categories of military personnel and military programs are under armed forces authority. These programs are not accredited, which means that the armed forces have almost 100 percent autonomy to decide over the content and realization of the different programs. These programs do not have to follow university laws or regulations and are not dependent on examination by civilian PhDs since the design and execution of the examination tasks is controlled by the military. The military also has the right to create and use its own methods and tools for evaluating individuals' progress and suitability for joining the armed forces and the authority to reject those who are not suitable.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe implementation of the armed forces new military education system is the last of three reforms and three inquiries from 2001 that in many aspects have taken the armed forces officer rank system and officer education back to the time before the implementation of NBO in 1984.77 The equilibrium between subjective civilian control with focus on societal imperative and objective civilian control with emphasis on the functional imperative have become more balanced. From Huntington’s and Janowitz’s civil–military relation perspective concerning subjective and objective control, it is obvious that the equilibrium has changed dramatically during the last three decades.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Swedish state’s subjective civilian control over the military profession has probably never been stronger than during the almost twenty-six years herein examined. The impact of civilian integration on the military organization and officer education system has been impressive since the NBS reform in 1984 and the Officer Education Programmes in 1999/2008 were mainly based on societal imperatives such as political and ideological desires for social and gender equality, cultural integration, and integration of civil university laws, regulations, and traditions. Both the officer rank and officer education system were essentially designed to support integration of a bureaucratic civil–military career system rather than functional military requirements.78\n\nBefore the implementation of the new officer rank system (NBS) in 1984 and the subsequent implementation of the Officer Programmes in 1999, the military profession had almost autonomous control over its own organization, officer rank, and officer education system. It was a rank and officer education system that had its roots in a more or less universal military establishment, corresponding well with the armed forces of other nations, and it was judged to be optimal for the functional imperative, that is, solving military tasks. From 1984, this was no longer the case. Because the external threat situation was perceived to be low, the government recognized a great chance to enforce societal imperatives in the form of political and ideological agendas. The government took over some control from the military, causing them to lose some of their former professional autonomy and control of the military organization and officer education system.\n\nThe armed forces transformation to an AVF system and implementation of a differentiated officer system from 2010 was a significant step toward increased objective civilian control over the military. The reasons for these two political and military controversial reforms can be traced to the globalization of military affairs and “new” main tasks for the Swedish armed forces, namely, multinational international operations in transnational environments. These new tasks have made it necessary to give less consideration to national societal imperatives and more to the international functional military imperatives. The Swedish armed forces' and its officers' needed to adapt to an international military standard to become interoperable with other nations' armed forces. These new reforms increased objective civilian control and gave back some of the military’s former professional autonomy over the officer rank and education systems.\n\nFrom 2010 and 2011, with the entry of an AVF, a new officer rank system and a new military education system, civilian control appears to be going in two opposite directions. On one hand, the university accredited Officer Program under the umbrella of both the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education and Research must be regarded as a hugely significant step toward increased civil integration in the military, especially since university laws and regulations trump military traditions and regulations. On the other hand, it seems that the program for NCOs is being subjected to increased objective civilian control and increased professional autonomy, that is, an education system all under military authority that is a significant step away from civilian integration. It could also be perceived as a step toward a more pluralistic military. The accredited Officer Program at the SNDC is moving toward increased convergence with civilian society under civilian university authority. The program for NCOs at the units goes in a divergent direction under military authority. This is a situation that, according to Arthur D. Larson, would create great functional difficulties and unbridgeable differences. “Two military institutions in the place of one would soon emerge—one elitist and militaristic, the other popular and politicized.”79\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this article, we set out to conduct an empirical analysis and theoretical discussion of Swedish civil–military relations over a period of more than twenty-five years from 1984 to 2011, based on Samuel Huntington’s and Morris Janowitz’s distinction between objective and subjective civilian control over the military from a societal and functional imperatives perspective. Our analysis was made from the perspective of (1) control of the military officer rank system and (2) the professional officer education system. The analysis aimed to explain how the officer rank system and the professional officer education system have been affected by objective and subjective civilian control during the late Cold War era and after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nAccording to Huntington’s civil–military relation theory, objective civilian control with a functional imperative will increase when external threats are perceived to be high, while subjective civilian control with societal imperative will dominate when external threats are perceived to be low. This analysis clearly shows that subjective and objective control can change at the same time, depending on changing internal or external military and political conditions. This article’s main contribution with regard to civil–military relation theory is that civilian–military control not only depends on perceived external threats to a nation’s border but also depends on globalization and new threats such as transnational terrorism, insurgency, and different kinds of intrastate and interstate conflicts together with the globalization of military activities. For the Swedish military, these new military and political scenarios have created clearer defined military tasks than in the period before and immediately after the Cold War, resulting in a need for increased military cooperation with different armed forces in multinational operations. Together, the components of new threats, new tasks, and increased cooperation in multinational international operations seem to argue the need for objective civilian control with more emphasis on a functional imperative.\n\nIn this article, we have not solved the issue of a proper civil–military relations theory but we have shown that the balance between subjective and objective civilian control is redefined when internal and external political and military conditions change.\n\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\n\nThe author declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nFunding\n\nThe author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The writing of this article was supported by the Swedish National Defence College.\n\nNotes\n\nBiographies\n\nErik Hedlund earned his PhD in educational science from Stockholm University with a dissertation on Regular Officer Training, Professional Competence and Legitimacy.
