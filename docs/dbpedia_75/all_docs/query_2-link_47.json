Looks like the traditional clubs are Malmö, AIK, Djürgardens and I've seen that IFK Götebotg has won the League 18 times, Malmö also reached the champions league final in 1979 and lost against Nothingham Forest.\n\nI'm living in Norrbotten at the moment and I saw that Lulea reach the Allsvenskan in 1991.\n\nWhich is the club that everyone dislikes? Is AIK the most popular team?\n\nTack!"
