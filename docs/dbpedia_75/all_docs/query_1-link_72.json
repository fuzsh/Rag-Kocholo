I managed to cobble together a smoker from things I had lying around and made a recipe inspired by the Whole Larder Love book and various episodes of River Cottage. It was surprisingly easy and I'm very happy to report that the results were spectacular.\n\nBuilding Your Smoker\n\nFor the main chamber of the smoker I used the tin from some Royal Dansk Danish Butter Cookies, the kind you always find yourself with but can never quite remember where they came from. I pierced holes in the lid to let the smoke out.\n\nFor the smoking rack I used a baker's cooling rack and cut it into a circle the same diameter as the tin. I left a couple of centimeters on a few of the horizontal bars and bent them over so that the rack sat away from the bottom of the tin.\n\nI put a couple of handfuls of shavings into the bottom of the tin. There seems to be a lot of discussion about the best wood to use for this, but I had a pile left over from carving spoons which I used, it was mainly birch.\n\nFor a heat source I had the burner from my Trangia. You can use a gas hob or stove top but I didn't want to stink the house out with smoke so a portable option was preferable.\n\nCooking Method\n\nFirstly I descaled, cleaned and filleted the trout.\n\nI made a rub that was 2 parts salt and 1 part brown sugar and gave the fish an all over coating. This was left in a sealed Tupperware container overnight in the fridge.\n\nThe next evening I washed the fish, removing the excess rub and patted it dry.\n\nI placed the fillet inside the tin skin side down, closed the lid and lit the burner.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes smoke was billowing out of the holes in the lid. I gave each fillet about 10-12 minutes which seemed perfect.\n\nThe fish was moist and tender, and it crumbled perfectly. It had a deep-infused smokiness and that salty smoked-fish tang. It was so morish I wolfed the first fillet down immediately. I saved the second for breakfast and had it on an English muffin with a poached egg. Perfect.\n\nTips from the Archive #010\n\nA quick tip by Robert J. Kelsey from his wonderful book \"Walking in the Wild - The Complete Guide to Hiking and Backpacking\". This might be controversial to some, in fact many ultralight hikers argue to the nth degree about the finer points of Esbit and Hexamin vs alcohol to avoid just this, but this old tip is interesting and worth some further investigation.\n\nTip #10 – The Pot Black\n\nCampfire Sausage Stew with Thyme Dumplings\n\nStew is one of my staple outdoor dishes; it's very hard to mess up and the results can be spectacular. This time however, I wanted to up the stew ante and nudge my culinary comfort zone a little further by taking on the mighty dumpling.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the stew\n\n6 Really good sausages (I normally go for something herby and porky, preferably from a good butcher)\n\n2 Large white onions, roughly chopped\n\n2 Large carrots, sliced\n\n10 Small new potatoes, chopped in half\n\n1 Pint of stock (I used a couple of beef stock cubes)\n\n1 Can of cheap beer\n\n1 Bottle of expensive cider\n\nWorchester sauce\n\nThyme\n\nOil for cooking (something with a high burning temperature, sunflower is fine)\n\nFor the dumplings\n\n1 Cup of self raising flour\n\n1 Egg\n\n50g Cold butter cubed\n\n1 Tbsp chopped parsley\n\n1 Tbsp chopped thyme\n\n¼ Cup of milk\n\nMethod\n\nI cooked my stew on a campfire in a suspended Dutch oven, it needs to cook for several hours so make sure there are sufficient coals. I started with a big hot fire with slow burning wood and let it burn down. You can, of course vary the height of the oven and even cover it in coals if the heat is needed.\n\n1. Lightly heat the Dutch oven and add the oil. Sauté the onions, do not let them brown - they should soften and go translucent.\n\n2. While the onions were cooking, I put the sausages on a rack directly over the flames to seal and brown the outside. They don't need to cook through as this will happen later. I managed to tilt the grill in such a way that the oil and juices went into the Dutch oven for extra flavour.\n\n3. Once the sausages are browned add them to the onions and pour in the stock, beer and cider. I added a good spoonful of thyme and a few good glugs of Worchester Sauce. Give it all a good stir and bring the oven to the boil, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.\n\n4. By now the broth should be coming together nicely and slowly reducing. Add the vegetables and return the stew to the heat, give it a good stir and cover, then cook for another 30 minutes. Mix up the dumplings.\n\n5. To make the dumplings, pour the flour into a large bowl, add the butter and rub it in until it resembles breadcrumbs.\n\n6. Add the herbs and the egg, and mix with your hand, adding just enough milk so that the mixture comes together in a sticky dough.\n\n7. Check the stew, it should have reduced considerably making a thick, rich gravy; if it is too dry add a little water or stock. Give it another stir and then add large spoonfuls of the dough directly onto the top of the stew. Try and place them a few centimeters apart as they will puff up as they cook. Replace the lid on and cook for another 15 minutes.\n\n8. Check the stew. The dumplings should have puffed up and increased in size and the stew should be thick and rich. I prefer the top of my dumplings to be crispy so I buried the Dutch oven in coals and blasted it for another five minutes.\n\n9. Then it is done. Serve quickly and eat heartily.\n\nThe stew is hefty and flavorsome, the dumplings sticky, doughy and morish. Shared between two we were both stuffed and had enough for lunch the day after. I'm not sure why I was so fearful of campfire dumplings, they were foolproof and a simple way of getting a delicious and filling bread course to my stew, with little effort.\n\nCampfire Beef Bourguignon\n\nI'm often asked about campfire meals I make, I consider myself quite a freestylecook,as such I don't really write things down. I'm not qualified by any means, but I worked in kitchens throughout school and college and consider myself pretty confident in the kitchen. This is the first time I have ever consciously made notes and honed a recipe to share.\n\nBeef bourguignon is one of my favorite slow cooked meals, I think its pretty perfect for permanent camp or cabin cookery. Simple and delicious. Something you can throw on a fire and leave. This recipe is loosely based on Larousse Gastronomique's traditional dish.\n\nIngredients\n\n2lbs (just under 1kg) braising beef (rump)\n\n6 Rashers of thick-cut fatty bacon\n\n3 large onions\n\n3 cups (750ml) red wine (nothing too expensive but something you would drink)\n\n2 cups (500ml) beef stock\n\n2 Garlic cloves crushed\n\nThyme\n\nParsley\n\nFlour (for dusting and thickening)\n\nSalt and pepper for seasoning\n\nMethod\n\nTo start you will need some decent coals so make sure you build your fire big with suitable wood and let it burn down to cooking coals. This meal is slow cooked over a few hours so be sure to have a large stock of wood so coals can be replenished.\n\nRoughly cut the beef into large chunks and dust with seasoned flour and put you dutch oven on the coals to pre-heat.\n\nCut the bacon into large strips and fry in your dutch oven\n\nAdd the beef, two of the onions sliced roughly and the garlic and brown them all\n\nAdd the wine and stock , the herbs and season well\n\nCover and gently simmer for at least two hours; until the beef is meltingly tender and the sauce has thickened. Give it a try and adjust the seasoning to your taste.\n\nOnce you think it is ready slice and fry the remaining onion and add it to the pot, continue cooking for another 20 minutes\n\nServe with camp bread (either bannock, damper or flatbread.)\n\nThe dish came out very well. Tender meat with a thick delicious sauce. It was also incredibly easy. I hope, this inspires some of you to try something new on the campfire.\n\nTips from the Archive #004\n\nThis one is a goody, especially for the outdoor gourmet. It comes from Viv Moon's Outdoor cookbook. This is my go-to outdoor cookery guide. This particular tip is great for anyone trying to master the dutch oven.\n\nTip 004 – Dutch Oven Temperature\n\nHope this helps.\n\nDamper\n\nDamper is an iconic Australian bush bread - a staple for stockmen, swagmen, drovers and indigenous Australians alike. It is similar to bannock but is traditionally cooked directly on campfire coals or in a Dutch oven. The recipe is simply water and self raising flour, but everyone seems to have their own unique spin. The recipe I followed is from Viv Moon's incredible \"Outdoor Cookbook\"\n\nThis was very simple and very tasty, I followed Viv's recipe to the note. I used a trivet in my oven just to lift the bread a little and get the heat circulating. As ever with a Dutch oven it took a while to get the really good coals ready but it can't be rushed. I preheated the oven and dropped the dough in, checking after 20 minutes - the bread had risen nicely and giving it a tap I got the tell-tale hollow sound. I added more coals and increased the heat to try and get a little more colour and gave it another ten minutes.\n\nThe results were great. It seemed to rise more than bannock but didn't quite get the colour of the skillet bread. Taste wise it was light, fluffy and delicious. We ate it with campfire chilli and had enough left for breakfast the next day. I will definitely be making this again.\n\nHead to head against bannock I preferred damper; although it tasted similar it was a much lighter bread. It does however take longer to cook and requires a camp oven not just a frying pan or skillet.\n\nIf any body else has tried damper or has their own spin on it I'd love to hear about it.\n\nBannock\n\nLiving in a city (a small one none the less) I rarely get chance to have a fire and it just didn't feel right making my first bannock without one. Fortunately I was invited to New Hampshire to make maple syrup. This was the perfect excuse to try out my frying pan bread skills.\n\nBannock is an easy to make, no nonsense bread. Although it has Scottish roots it was also a favorite among native Americans as well as hikers, woodsmen and outdoors types. I came across a great number of recipes online and in various publications, they all have a similar base with other flourishes. The most detailed documentation was in Bradford Angier's \"Home in Your Pack.\"\n\nAngier's basic recipe and his method are as follows.\n\nI made a double batch and also added: fresh blueberries, 3 tablespoons of butter and an extra pinch of baking powder. These are all Angier's recommendations for a tastier loaf.\n\nI cooked exactly as advised and the results were fantastic. Crusty and toasted on the outside, fluffy in the middle with small blueberry explosions. Awesome with a little butter and some maple syrup. Looking forward to experimenting with different flavors. Cheese and olive spring to mind.\n\nTreeless Maple Syrup - The Results\n\nSo the verdict is in. A few weeks ago I went about creating \"Treeless Maple Syrup\" - this was a recipe of Bradford Angier's that I found in “Taming the Wilds.” As advised I left it to mature and this morning the frying pan went on and the secret pancake mix was made up.\n\nThe syrup had taken a strange turn, the sugar all sank and solidified leaving a strange coloured liquid on top. I gave it a good mix and it became thick and caramel like. Once on the pancakes it was actually surprisingly good. A little gritty and extremely sweet, without any hint of potato. My fellow diners both found it \"passable, with a weird texture\" I was very happy the results. It doesn't really shine a light on maple syrup but a servicable replacement if you cant get hold of the real stuff.\n\nMaple syrup season is nearly upon us and we have been invited to a syrup cook-out in New Hampshire, so my maple syrup adventure continues.\n\nC. William Harrison's 1965 Gear List\n\nFound in Harrison's \"The First Book of Hiking\" published in 1965, this concise yet poetic book is beautifully illustrated by E. Frank Habbas.\n\nI particularly like the sound of plumbers candles."
