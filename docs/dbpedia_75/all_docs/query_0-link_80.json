Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\n\nExtensive evidence shows that well over 50% of people prefer to be cared for and to die at home provided circumstances allow choice. Despite best efforts and policies, one‐third or less of all deaths take place at home in many countries of the world.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. To quantify the effect of home palliative care services for adult patients with advanced illness and their family caregivers on patients' odds of dying at home; 2. to examine the clinical effectiveness of home palliative care services on other outcomes for patients and their caregivers such as symptom control, quality of life, caregiver distress and satisfaction with care; 3. to compare the resource use and costs associated with these services; 4. to critically appraise and summarise the current evidence on cost‐effectiveness.\n\nSearch methods\n\nWe searched 12 electronic databases up to November 2012. We checked the reference lists of all included studies, 49 relevant systematic reviews, four key textbooks and recent conference abstracts. We contacted 17 experts and researchers for unpublished data.\n\nSelection criteria\n\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITSs) evaluating the impact of home palliative care services on outcomes for adults with advanced illness or their family caregivers, or both.\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nOne review author assessed the identified titles and abstracts. Two independent reviewers performed assessment of all potentially relevant studies, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. We carried out meta‐analysis where appropriate and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTBs) for the primary outcome (death at home).\n\nMain results\n\nWe identified 23 studies (16 RCTs, 6 of high quality), including 37,561 participants and 4042 family caregivers, largely with advanced cancer but also congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis (MS), among other conditions. Meta‐analysis showed increased odds of dying at home (odds ratio (OR) 2.21, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.71; Z = 2.98, P value = 0.003; Chi2 = 20.57, degrees of freedom (df) = 6, P value = 0.002; I2 = 71%; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 14 (seven trials with 1222 participants, three of high quality)). In addition, narrative synthesis showed evidence of small but statistically significant beneficial effects of home palliative care services compared to usual care on reducing symptom burden for patients (three trials, two of high quality, and one CBA with 2107 participants) and of no effect on caregiver grief (three RCTs, two of high quality, and one CBA with 2113 caregivers). Evidence on cost‐effectiveness (six studies) is inconclusive.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\n\nThe results provide clear and reliable evidence that home palliative care increases the chance of dying at home and reduces symptom burden in particular for patients with cancer, without impacting on caregiver grief. This justifies providing home palliative care for patients who wish to die at home. More work is needed to study cost‐effectiveness especially for people with non‐malignant conditions, assessing place of death and appropriate outcomes that are sensitive to change and valid in these populations, and to compare different models of home palliative care, in powered studies.\n\nKeywords: Adult, Female, Humans, Male, Attitude to Death, Caregivers, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Critical Illness, Critical Illness/nursing, Home Care Services, Home Care Services/economics, Palliative Care, Palliative Care/economics, Palliative Care/methods, Patient Preference, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome\n\nPlain language summary\n\nEffectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of home‐based palliative care services for adults with advanced illness and their caregivers\n\nWhen faced with the prospect of dying with an advanced illness, the majority of people prefer to die at home, yet in many countries around the world they are most likely to die in hospital. We reviewed all known studies that evaluated home palliative care services, i.e. experienced home care teams of health professionals specialised in the control of a wide range of problems associated with advanced illness – physical, psychological, social, spiritual. We wanted to see how much of a difference these services make to people's chances of dying at home, but also to other important aspects for patients towards the end of life, such as symptoms (e.g. pain) and family distress. We also compared the impact on the costs with care. On the basis of 23 studies including 37,561 patients and 4042 family caregivers, we found that when someone with an advanced illness gets home palliative care, their chances of dying at home more than double. Home palliative care services also help reduce the symptom burden people may experience as a result of advanced illness, without increasing grief for family caregivers after the patient dies. In these circumstances, patients who wish to die at home should be offered home palliative care. There is still scope to improve home palliative care services and increase the benefits for patients and families without raising costs.\n\nSummary of findings\n\nSummary of findings 1\n\nOutcomes: home palliative care vs. usual carePatient or population: adult patients with a severe or advanced disease (malignant or non‐malignant)\n\nSettings: Canada, Italy, Norway, Sweden, UK, US\n\nIntervention: home palliative care\n\nComparison: usual care, which could include community care (primary or specialist care at home and in nursing homes), hospital care (inpatient and outpatient) and in some instances palliative or hospice care (or both)OutcomesNumber needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)a (95% CI)Odds ratio\n\n(95% CI)No of participants\n\n(studies)Level of evidenceb\n\n(adapted fromVan Tulder 2003)CommentsHome death\n\nfollow‐up: 3 to 24 months\n\nand With study population control risk\n\n(307 home deaths/1000 deaths)\n\nNNTB 5 (3 to 14), meaning that for one additional patient to die at home five more would need to receive home palliative care as opposed to usual care\n\nWith low home death population assumed control risk (ACR)\n\n(128 home deaths/1000 deaths)\n\nNNTB 9 (5 to 26)\n\nWith medium home death population ACR\n\n(278 home deaths/1000 deaths)\n\nNNTB 6 (3 to 15)\n\nWith high home death population ACR\n\n(454 home deaths/1000 deaths)\n\nNNTB 5 (3 to 13)OR 2.21\n\n(1.31 to 3.71)1222\n\n(7 studies, 3 of high quality; 5 RCTs and 2 CCTs)StrongThe majority of patients had cancer but 3 trials also included non‐cancer conditions. 3 interventions provided specialist palliative care and 4 provided intermediate palliative care\n\nThe direction of the effect was consistent across all studies but did not reach statistical significance in 3; ORs ranged from 1.36 (95% CI 0.80 to 2.31) to 2.86 (95% CI 0.78 to 10.53)\n\nSensitivity analyses showed that exclusion of the 2 CCTs (both of Swedish hospital‐based services with a pooled OR 3.44, 95% CI 0.60 to 19.57) and inclusion of only high quality RCTs resulted in a reduction of the OR to 1.28 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.33) and 1.75 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.47) respectively, with more precision and less heterogeneitySymptom burden\n\nfollow‐up: 1 month from enrolment to the week of death\n\nNot calculated, data were not pooled due to the high degree of heterogeneity.

These planes plot costs against outcomes forming four‐quadrants to visualise if the intervention has better outcomes and higher costs, better outcomes at lower costs, worse outcomes at higher costs or worse outcomes but at lower costs. The authors accounted for uncertainty around the cost‐effectiveness estimates by generating 1000 resamples using bootstrapping and computing cost and outcome differences for each, which were then plotted on the cost‐effectiveness planes. The point estimates in cost‐effectiveness planes suggest that the intervention was cost saving, with equivalent outcomes on overall palliative outcomes and improved outcomes for caregiver burden. The POS‐8 plane showed 33.8% replications in the lower right quadrant, indicating that intervention patients had better outcomes and lower costs than controls, and 54.9% in the quadrant indicating worse outcomes but lower costs.

Most patients and caregivers facing advanced illness also prefer this. However, their choices depend on the problems experienced and the quality of the care received (Choi 2005; Thomas 2004). At present, in many countries of the world, most people have their wishes for home death unfulfilled. Despite efforts and policies to enable more to die at home only a minority of deaths take place at home, for example 17% in Norway in 2008, 21% in England in 2010, 23% in Belgium in 2007, 30% in Canada in 2004, 33% in Portugal in 2005, 34% in Italy in 2002 and 34% in the Netherlands in 2003 (Cohen 2010; Gomes 2012a; Houttekier 2011; WHO 2011; Wilson 2009).\n\nThe importance of providing optimal palliative care that supports patients with advanced illness and caregivers who wish to stay at home is particularly topical in ageing populations (Khaw 1999; WHO 2011). With the number of deaths predicted to rise dramatically in the future due to longer life expectancy and large cohorts of 'baby‐boom' generations reaching older age, high numbers of hospital deaths are difficult to sustain and an expansion of palliative care provision will need to happen in all settings – in hospitals, hospices, nursing and residential homes, and importantly at home (Gomes 2008; Gomes 2011). Already in a few countries such as the UK, Canada and the US, there has been a reversal of secular trends towards institutionalised dying and increasingly more people die at home (Gomes 2012a; Gao 2013; Wilson 2009;Teno 2013; Flory 2004).\n\nIn order to care well for more people at home and thus meet the preferences of more patients and caregivers, the effect of home palliative care services on death at home needs to be quantified. This will help estimate the extent to which current services need expansion or improvement, or both, according to need and preference. Furthermore, it is crucial to ascertain the effect of these services on outcomes other than death at home, such as symptom control, quality of life, caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. These outcomes are often as important or more important to patients than to die at home (Heyland 2006Steinhauser 2000). Finally, from a service planning perspective, home palliative care may save costs elsewhere in a healthcare system, in particular hospital costs, but whether or not these services are a cost‐effective addition or alternative to usual care is still a question.\n\nWhy it is important to do this review\n\nExisting reviews of the effectiveness of home palliative care services (including home care teams attached to inpatient hospices, community hospice care agencies, hospital‐based community support teams and hospital at home services) have often been part of wider reviews of the effectiveness of palliative care models or have referred to populations of patients with cancer only (Smeenk 1998b). However, palliative care has expanded beyond cancer (Addington‐Hall 2001a). Two systematic reviews have looked at palliative care services regardless of patient diagnosis and included economic studies (Higginson 2003Zimmermann 2008); only one full economic evaluation, conducted as part of a pilot study in Italy in the 1990s, was found (Tramarin 1992). Furthermore, findings on outcomes varied, with the exception of an increased probability of death at home resulting from one model of home palliative care – hospital at home – as found in a Cochrane review (Shepperd 2011). A wider examination of home palliative care models and a critical appraisal of the variation in findings will help improve the evidence‐base for the development, implementation and evaluation of home palliative care services in the future.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of this review were:\n\nto quantify the effect of home palliative care services for adults with advanced illness and their family caregivers on patients' odds of dying at home;\n\nto examine the clinical effectiveness of home palliative care services on other outcomes for patients and their caregivers such as symptom control, quality of life, caregiver distress and satisfaction with care;\n\nto compare the resource use and costs associated with these services;\n\nto critically appraise and summarise the current evidence on cost‐effectiveness.\n\nAdditional objectives were to examine sources of heterogeneity in the findings and to ascertain the appropriateness for meta‐analysis.\n\nMethods\n\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\n\nTypes of studies\n\nPatient or cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\n\nPatient or cluster controlled clinical trials (CCTs)\n\nControlled before and after studies (CBAs)\n\nInterrupted time series analyses (ITSs)\n\nWe defined 'randomised' as studies that were described by the authors as 'randomised' anywhere in the manuscript except in cases where the term was misused (e.g. referring to a random sample). We included CBAs that had at least two intervention sites and two control sites. We included ITSs with a defined point in time when the intervention started and at least three data points before and three after the intervention.\n\nThe economic component of the review was restricted to economic analyses conducted alongside the studies meeting eligibility criteria for the effectiveness component of the review. The following types of economic analyses were included:\n\nfull economic evaluations;\n\npartial economic evaluations;\n\nanalyses reporting more limited resource use/cost information.\n\nTypes of participants\n\nParticipants aged 18 years or older in receipt of a home palliative care service (as described below), their family caregivers, or both. For a study to be included, the majority of patients had to have a severe or advanced disease (malignant or non‐malignant), no longer responding to curative/maintenance treatment or symptomatic, or both (e.g. lung/brain tumours or metastatic cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)).\n\nTypes of interventions\n\nA team delivering home palliative care with the presence of the following four elements.\n\n1. Primarily for patients with a severe or advanced disease (malignant or non‐malignant), no longer responding to curative/maintenance treatment or symptomatic (or both), or their family caregivers, or both\n\nInterventions that did not directly deliver care to patients or caregivers were excluded. This included staff education/training programmes, teams operating only in a staff advisory capacity or co‐ordinating services, interventions conducting assessment only thus no direct management (e.g. screening tool), new policies (e.g. introduction of benefit scheme) and national policies/strategies were excluded. These do not necessarily and directly translate into care to patients or caregivers.\n\n2. Aiming to support patients or family caregivers, or both, outside hospital and other institutional settings as far as possible and to enable patients to stay at home\n\nWhile conducting the review we have also included interventions in which it was clear the majority of service contacts were established while the patients were at home. Services delivered in skilled nursing facilities, day care centres, residential homes or prisons were excluded.\n\n3. Providing either specialist or intermediate palliative/hospice care, as defined in a previous systematic review\n\n(Higginson 2003):\n\ni) specialist palliative/hospice care was defined as health and social care provided by:\n\na) one or more doctors who have undergone higher specialist training in palliative medicine, and\n\nb) one or more nurses who have undergone higher specialist training, and\n\nc) one or more professionals attached to the team from a profession allied to medicine who have had further training in palliative care.\n\nWe accepted the presence of higher specialist training in palliative/hospice care if the authors described the professionals as palliative care specialists or experts (e.g. 'palliative care physician'). Training in 'care of the dying' (or described using equivalent terms) or comprising different physical and psychosocial components of palliative care were accepted. We also considered an intervention specialist palliative/hospice care if stated as such by the authors.\n\nii) intermediate palliative/hospice care was defined as health and social care provided by:\n\na) professionals from differing clinical disciplines working full‐time or most of the time in palliative/hospice care, who have not undergone any higher specialist training but developed much clinical experience over the years and had in‐service training for their job, or\n\nb) a uni‐disciplinary team of professionals (e.g. nurses) working full‐time or most of the time in palliative care, in which one or more members may have had some further training.\n\nWe accepted that a team of professionals with years of existence or largely caring for patients with advanced illness is likely to work most of the time in the field and have some form of in‐house training, thus this was considered as intermediate palliative/hospice care. We also considered an intervention intermediate palliative/hospice care if the authors described it as 'palliative care' or ‘'hospice care' but when it was unclear whether the criteria for specialist (point 'i' above) were met.\n\n4. Providing comprehensive care and aiming at different physical and psychosocial components of palliative care\n\nEvaluations of interventions delivering only one component of palliative care (e.g. pain medication, home parenteral nutrition, home oxygen, home yoga, psychotherapy, social work, bereavement support, respite care, physical exercise, assistance with living wills) were excluded as they do not encompass the holistic nature of palliative care. Studies that compared forms of home palliative care differing in only one component of care (e.g. medication regimen) were also excluded. Excluding these, we accepted the delivery of comprehensive care if the authors stated the team offered 'palliative care' or 'hospice care', or if it was clear its professionals had training or experience in providing different physical and psychosocial components of palliative care.\n\nTypes of outcome measures\n\nPrimary outcomes\n\nDeath at home.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nAccording to our protocol (Gomes 2009), these included:\n\ntime the patient spent at home,\n\nsatisfaction with care,\n\npain,\n\nother symptoms,\n\nphysical function,\n\nquality of life,\n\ncaregiver pre‐ and post‐bereavement outcomes.\n\nEconomic data\n\nThese included:\n\nhospital costs,\n\nother institutional care costs,\n\ncommunity care costs,\n\ninformal care costs,\n\nequipment and medication prescribed.\n\nMeasures of cost‐effectiveness included incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using condition specific outcome measures and ICERs using quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome measures.\n\nSearch methods for identification of studies\n\nElectronic searches\n\nWe identified studies from a search of 12 databases:\n\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (21 November 2012);\n\nEMBASE (1980 to 21 November 2012);\n\nMEDLINE (1950 to 21 November 2012);\n\nCochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) Trials Register (11 May 2010);\n\nCochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Trials Register (11 May 2010);\n\nCINAHL (1981 to 13 April 2010);\n\nEURONHEED (1980 to 13 April 2010);\n\nPsycINFO (1806 to 13 April 2010);\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (7 April 2010);\n\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) (7 April 2010);\n\nHealth Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (7 April 2010);\n\nNHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (7 April 2010).\n\nSearch strategies were refined with input from the Trials Search Co‐ordinator of our Review Group (Cochrane PaPaS Review Group). Please see Appendix 1 for the MEDLINE search strategy in OVID and Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 4, Appendix 5, Appendix 6, Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 for all other search strategies. Results from searches in Cochrane databases, DARE, HTA and NHS EED were provided by the Trials Search Co‐ordinator. The remaining searches and last update in November 2012 were conducted by BG/NC.\n\nSearching other resources\n\nHandsearching\n\nWe handsearched the reference lists of the following four textbooks: Textbook of Palliative Medicine (Bruera 2006); Palliative Medicine (Walsh 2009); Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine (Hanks 2009) and Oxford Textbook of Palliative Nursing (Ferrell 2010). We also checked conference proceedings of the biennial Research Congress of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC 2008 and EAPC 2010).\n\nReference lists\n\nWe checked the reference lists of 49 relevant reviews (references in Appendix 9) and all included studies.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nWe contacted 17 authors of the main studies and investigators who were known to be carrying out research in this area for further studies and unpublished data: Amy Abernethy, Charles Normand, Sydney Dy, Ilora Finlay, Richard Harding, Chris Salisbury, Lidia Garcia Perez, Susan L Hughes, Bruce E Robinson, Donna Wilson, Tim Whelan, Frank Smeenk, Franco Toscani, Stein Kaasa, Camilla Zimmerman, Sasha Shepperd and Taryn Young.\n\nLanguage\n\nThere was no language restriction in the selection of studies.\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nSelection of studies\n\nOne review author (BG) screened the titles and abstracts for relevance, to judge eligibility and to remove duplicates. Full text of all potentially relevant studies was assessed by BG and NC. Disagreements were resolved by consensus and with a third review author (IJH) when needed.\n\nData extraction and management\n\nData from each selected study were entered on a data extraction form; the content is described in the protocol (Gomes 2009). Two reviewers extracted data independently for each study (two of BG/NC/BA/KS). Disagreements were resolved by consensus and with a third review author when needed. We contacted authors of studies to provide unpublished data for meta‐analysis where required.\n\nAssessment of methodological quality of included studies\n\nTwo independent reviewers (two of BG/NC/BA/KS) assessed all included studies for methodological quality. We used the standard criteria developed by the Cochrane EPOC Review Group for RCTs/CCTs, CBAs and ITSs (see methods used in reviews under editorial information in Group Details). The checklist for RCTs/CCTs contains seven items qualified as done, unclear and not done for concealment of allocation, follow‐up of professionals, follow‐up of patients or episodes of care, blinded assessment of primary outcome(s), baseline assessment, reliable primary outcome measure(s) and protection against contamination. We assessed blinding and reliability of all outcomes (rather than just the primary). Also, one of the criteria (follow‐up of professionals) was not relevant to the studies in review; the remaining six were used. Each criterion was scored zero (not done), 0.5 (not clear or when scores varied across outcomes) and one (done). Total scores for RCTs/CCTs ranged from zero to six; studies with a score of 3.5 or above were considered of high quality.\n\nTwo independent review authors (BG/PMcC) assessed the methodological quality of all economic evaluations comparing total costs alongside outcomes (i.e. those enabling an appraisal of cost‐effectiveness). We used the BMJ's 35‐item checklist for authors and peer reviewers of economic submissions (Drummond 1996). An existing scoring system was applied to the checklist to distinguish high quality economic evaluations. We calculated a mean score with all items weighted equally (Gonzalez‐Perez 2002). Each item was scored zero (no), 0.5 (not clear or when scores varied across resource care/cost items) and one (yes); evaluations with a mean score of 0.6 or above were considered of high quality (Gonzalez‐Perez 2002). Not applicable items were omitted from the calculation of the mean.\n\nWe integrated the results of the quality assessment in data analysis and conducted meta‐analyses with sensitivity analyses including only high quality studies.\n\nMeasures of treatment effect\n\nWe combined studies using Review Manager (Version 5.1) (RevMan 2011). When sample size and proportions were missing we did not impute or estimate them for meta‐analysis because none of the suggested imputations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions were considered reliable (following procedures in previous Cochrane reviews under advice from the statistician of our Cochrane Review Group) (Higgins 2011). We therefore contacted the authors to request additional data.\n\nWe combined data from trials for the primary outcome (death at home vs. elsewhere, dichotomous outcome) using a random‐effects model to account for the heterogeneity in populations and interventions (DerSimonian 1986). We used the Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) method; this estimates the amount of between‐study variation by comparing each study's result with a M‐H fixed‐effect meta‐analysis result (Higgins 2011). The pooled effect is expressed as an odds ratio (OR) for home palliative care compared with usual care; values greater than 1 indicate increased odds of death at home with home palliative care, and less than 1 for decreased odds. A P value of 0.05 was used as the cut‐off value to determine statistical significance and data are presented as the estimated effect with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted similar meta‐analyses for death in hospital, in nursing homes and in inpatient hospices/palliative care units. One study was a cluster RCT where three pairs of clusters (health regions) were randomised to the intervention or control. We adjusted the data for meta‐analysis using the 0.02 estimate of intracorrelation coefficient for this study used in Shepperd's Cochrane review (Shepperd 2011). This reduced the sample size in meta‐analysis both for number of events (e.g. death at home) and total in each of the groups.\n\nWe calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for the primary outcome, that is the expected number of people who would need to receive home palliative care rather than usual care for one additional person to die at home. NNTBs were calculated for the study population control risk and for three other assumed control risks (ACR). These were based on cancer home deaths rates from a population‐based study across six European countries (Cohen 2010):\n\nlow home death population assumed the lowest rate of 128 deaths at home per 1000 cancer deaths (Norway);\n\nmedium home death population assumed the mean across the six European countries (278 deaths at home per 1000 cancer deaths);\n\nhigh home death population assumed the highest rate of 454 deaths at home per 1000 cancer deaths (the Netherlands).\n\nWe applied rates related to cancer as the included studies involved largely people with cancer.\n\nCombining data on other outcomes, resource use and costs was not possible due to differences in the measurement and reporting (e.g. tools used, follow‐up and assessment time points or time horizon, type of analysis and statistics reported). We present the data in narrative summary tables. We summarised the results related to cost‐effectiveness based on studies examining the total costs of care. The evidence was graded (strong, moderate, limited, conflicting, inconclusive or no evidence from trials) adapting criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group ( ; Van Tulder 2003).\n\n10\n\nStrongFindings from meta‐analysis or consistent findings across all studies including at least 2 high‐quality RCTsModerateConsistent findings across all studies including at least 2 low‐quality RCTs/CCTs or 1 high‐quality RCTLimited1 RCT/CCT not reaching high qualityConflictingInconsistent findings among at least 2 studies with at least 1 RCT/CCTInconclusiveStatistical significance of differences unknown in > 25% of all studiesNo evidence from trialsNo RCTs or CCTsConsistent (conflates assessment of direction and precision): statistically significant effect in same direction in ≥ 75% of all studies\n\nHigh‐quality RCTs/CCTs: ≥ 3.5 methodological quality score (ranging from 0 to 6)\n\nDealing with missing data\n\nCases with missing data regarding place of death and people who were still alive at the end of the study were excluded from the meta‐analyses.\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\n\nWe quantified heterogeneity using Chi2 and the I2 statistic, the latter quantifying the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to chance (Higgins 2011); higher percentages suggest more observed heterogeneity.\n\nAssessment of reporting biases\n\nWe examined the funnel plot for our primary outcome (death at home), to explore heterogeneity and publication bias. As the number of studies was less than 10 and only three were of high quality, we did not perform statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry (in these conditions the power of the tests is considered too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry; Higgins 2011).\n\nResults\n\nDescription of studies\n\nAlso see the Characteristics of included studies, Characteristics of excluded studies, Characteristics of studies awaiting classification and Characteristics of ongoing studies tables.\n\nResults of the search\n\nWe identified 7594 records through searches of databases, excluding duplicates. After screening the titles and abstracts, we excluded 6986 (see reasons in ). We reviewed the full text of the remaining 608 records for a more detailed evaluation. Of these, 53 reports (of 23 studies) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review.\n\nThe search of reviews and textbooks identified no new studies but found 10 additional references reporting on the already included studies. Searches of conference proceedings added two records to an already included study (one conference abstract and one paper). Personal contact with investigators added no new studies (yet identified one additional reference on an already included study). These additional 13 records were included in the review.\n\nWe screened the reference lists from the 23 included studies but no further eligible studies were found (yet another 14 records on the included studies were added, one of them a pooled analysis of two included studies). Personal contact with study authors added four reports of unpublished data. These 18 records were also included in the review.\n\nIn summary, the review included 23 studies reported in 84 records (75 full papers, five abstracts and four reports of unpublished data), ranging from one to 16 records per study.\n\nIncluded studies\n\nDesign\n\nSixteen studies were RCTs (including three cluster RCTs and two fast‐track trials). Four studies were CCTs (including two cluster CCTs). Two studies were CBAs: Gómez‐Batiste 2010 compared 62 home support palliative care teams with 43 hospital palliative care teams and Greer 1986 compared 39 home hospice care sites (20 community‐based and 19 hospital‐based) with 14 conventional care sites. One study was an ITS with a nested CBA, comparing the three years before and three years after the introduction of eight Macmillan home nursing services in the UK (four attached to inpatient hospices). For two of these services, the authors could only provide two or one year data prior to their introduction; as this did not meet our ITS inclusion criteria we analysed data only for the remaining six services (Ward 1987).\n\nSample sizes\n\nThe studies' sample sizes varied between 42 and 747 participants, except for two non‐randomised studies (Greer 1986 with 1754 cancer patients and their caregivers and Ward 1987 with 31,890 cancer deaths). Excluding the latter study, which covered a period of six years, recruitment length ranged from 1 to 50 months. In total, we analysed data from studies involving 41,603 participants (37,561 patients and 4042 caregivers).\n\nEleven studies were guided by power calculations (details in 'Characteristics of included studies'): three powered the study on quality of life (one also performed calculations on care costs and one on symptom intensity and depression), two on place of death, two on pain (one also performed calculations on nausea), one on overall palliative care outcomes, one on caregiver general health and one on care costs. In one study (McMillan 2007), the authors performed power calculations but provided no details.\n\nSeven of these 11 studies were underpowered at recruitment stage (i.e. participants enrolled) – by 3, 7, 10, 78, 54, 151 and 319 participants. Reasons included lower than expected referrals and proportion of eligible patients, and early deaths. The remaining four studies recruited the planned number of participants but none had the planned numbers at the first time point for analysis of the primary outcome (following baseline assessment and after receiving the intervention or control). At that point, they were underpowered by three participants (Brumley 2007), four participants (Higginson 2009), 57 participants (Walsh 2007) and 131 participants (Jordhøy 2000). Four RCTs published methodological papers discussing challenges and solutions in recruitment, attrition and compliance (Higginson 2009; Jordhøy 2000; McMillan 2007; McWhinney 1994).\n\nTwo trials conducted post‐hoc power calculations. Aiken 2006 was underpowered (power fell from 0.93 at baseline to 0.74 at first point for analysis after receiving the intervention or control); Hudson 2005 achieved power values ranging from 0.70 (t‐test for independent samples) to 0.99 (t‐test for related samples). Overall, most studies (12 out of 23) examined post‐intervention assessments of fewer than 120 participants.\n\nSetting\n\nEleven studies were conducted in the US (seven in metropolitan areas, two in rural areas and two in mixed areas including Greer 1986 across areas in Southern New England, Northern Midwest and Southern California). Five studies took place in the UK (three in the London metropolitan area, two in more mixed areas of the country). Three studies were conducted in Northern Europe (two in metropolitan areas in Sweden and one across six metropolitan and two rural areas in Norway). Two studies were conducted in Southern Europe (one in the Vicenza mixed urban and rural health district in Italy and one nationwide study in Spain). One study took place in the city of London in Ontario, Canada (McWhinney 1994) and one in the city of Melbourne, Australia (Hudson 2005).\n\nThe first studies were conducted in the US – one in New Haven (1975 to 1977, Buckingham 1978) and one in Vermont (four‐year study published in 1979, McKegney 1981); 10 studies were conducted or first published from 2000 onwards (see 'Characteristics of included studies' for details on dates).\n\nSeven studies recruited mainly from departments in general hospitals and four recruited mainly from primary care (including community services and US health management organisations). One study recruited only from an US Veteran Affairs (VA) hospital, with a population of largely male veterans (Hughes 1992). Three studies recruited from cancer centres or secondary care professionals (e.g. oncologists). One study used a variety of referral sources including community agencies, hospitals, managed care organisations, physicians, family/friends and self referrals (the latter were also accepted in three other studies) (Aiken 2006). Four studies were undertaken within existing specialist home palliative or hospice care teams. Ward 1987 was population‐based (ITS drawing on death certificate data). Greer 1986 recruited from 39 home hospice care sites and 14 conventional care sites. Gómez‐Batiste 2010 recruited from 62 home support palliative care teams and 43 hospital palliative care teams. Intervention and control groups were recruited from the same setting in all but Gómez‐Batiste 2010 and Greer 1986.\n\nParticipants\n\nFourteen studies were exclusively conducted with patients with advanced cancer or their caregivers, or both. Six studies included both cancer and non‐cancer conditions (in three studies the majority of patients had cancer). Three studies included only non‐cancer conditions: multiple sclerosis (MS) in one study (Higginson 2009), congestive heart failure (CHF) and COPD in one study (Rabow 2004) and AIDS in one study (Tramarin 1992). Median/mean age ranged from 53 to 77 years, except in Tramarin 1992 (approximate median was 30 years old). Approximately equal numbers of male and female patients were included, except in four studies where between 60% and 69% were women and in four studies where more than 60% were men (Gómez‐Batiste 2010 with 61% male patients, McCorkle 1989 with 63% male patients, Tramarin 1992 with 79% male patients and Hughes 1992 with largely male veterans). Across eight studies, between 12% and 43% of patients lived alone. Nine out of 14 studies involving caregivers described their characteristics; these were mostly spouses and women (median/mean age ranged from 56 to 63 years).\n\nFifteen studies used participants' expected survival as a criterion for study inclusion. Minimum life expectancy (estimated at recruitment usually by physicians) ranged from two weeks to three months, whereas maximum values ranged from two weeks to five years. Actual median/mean survival from enrolment was less than three months in five studies, between three and five months in two studies, and between six months and approximately one year in three studies.\n\nTwo studies were conducted with newly diagnosed patients (within 8 to 10 weeks in McCorkle 1989 and 8 to 12 weeks in Bakitas 2009). Exclusion criteria included enrolment in or transfer to hospice care in two studies (Brumley 2007; Rabow 2004), enrolment in a home health agency (McCorkle 1989), and admission to an inpatient hospice, assisted‐living facility or nursing home in one study (McMillan 2007). Ten studies excluded patients with no caregiver.\n\nIntervention\n\nHome palliative care\n\nNineteen different models of home palliative care were examined ( ). Some were new interventions, evaluated through pilot studies, demonstration projects or early phase trials (e.g. Tramarin 1992Rabow 2004 and Higginson 2009, respectively); others existed for some time (e.g. the palliative care home support team in McWhinney 1994 existed for 18 months, the hospital‐based home care (HBHC) team in Hughes 1992 existed for 13 years).\n\n11\n\nStudy, country, settingType of careService base\n\nCore team, responsibilityTheoretical frameworkInterventionContacts, durationAxelsson 1998Sweden, Östersund, county of Jämtland, metropolitan (sparsely populated region)SpecialistDepartment of General Surgery at County Hospital of ÖstersundFull‐time nurse (weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., equipped with leasing care and phone) with 15 years' experience of practical cancer care in a surgical ward, trained in pain relief and symptom control, surgeon (half‐day per week); responsibility not stated but service worked with primary care centres; weekly review meetings—\"Palliative Support Service\"\n\nnew programme\n\n* nurse role ‐ link between home and hospital; patient, caregiver and staff support; district nurse education on care management; administration of blood transfusions, low‐dose chemotherapy and parenteral nutrition at home\n\n* surgeon role ‐ screening of referrals; case review with nurse at weekly conference; occasional home visits\n\n* dossier given to patient at dischargeMedian 14.5 hours of contact with nurse and 2 hours of contact with surgeon; 70 days median length of stay in intervention; all intervention patients analysed died within study periodBakitas 2009\n\nUS, New Hampshire and Vermont, ruralSpecialistPalliative care programme, Dartmouth‐Hitchcock Medical Center (National Cancer Institute‐designated comprehensive cancer centre)Palliative care physician, advanced practice nurses with high specialty training in palliative care; nurses acted as case managers but primary team held final responsibility for medical decisions; 12‐20 hours of staff training (materials available from authors); biweekly reviews of audio‐taped sessions and feedback on difficult patient management issuesChronic care model\"Project ENABLE II\"\n\nfollowed a demonstration project\n\n* without forgoing curative care\n\n* needs assessment using Distress Thermometer\n\n* case management\n\n* crisis prevention\n\n* patient and caregiver education\n\n* education manual (available from authors)\n\n* monthly group shared medical appointments\n\n* referral to other resources (e.g. palliative care team, hospice, spiritual counsellor)\n\n* nurse readily available by phone\n\n* follow‐up call in bereavement\n\n* intervention manual (available from authors)Telephone‐based format, 4 sessions (31‐40 min), at least monthly telephone follow‐ups (14 months median survival in intervention group, 112/161 deaths in intervention group during mean 14.6 months' follow‐up), bereavement follow‐up callGómez‐Batiste 2010Spain, all 19 regions, mix of metropolitan and ruralSpecialist63 teams, base not statedTeams typically included doctor, 2 or 3 nurses, psychosocial worker (social worker or psychologist) with advanced training in palliative care; not stated who held responsibility but services aimed to advise other conventional teams in the community—Existing teams\n\nno specific information about intervention componentsAccording to previous study, teams performed a mean of 9 interventions per patient and telephone calls were second most frequent activity; 42 days median length from day of first clinical visit to death or last monitoring visit; 42 patients died and considered drop‐outsHigginson 2009\n\nUK, London,\n\nmetropolitanSpecial"
