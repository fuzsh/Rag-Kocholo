        "text": "With all the urbanization and industrialization that has occurred over the past few decades, the Swedish countryside has seen migration and depopulation (Jordbruksverket 2012). Many social, economic, and environmental challenges have been created by urbanization. As urbanization grows, there is an opportunity to build on rural resilience and sustainability central to the international policy (Li et al. 2019) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), herein mentioning sustainable cities and communities. For the countryside to continue to develop and be dynamic, a wide range of stakeholders have a significant contribution including governments, private companies, civil society, and academics. However, the local inhabitants also make a significant contribution to being the municipality’s source of revenue while remaining in place for developing the region (Bois 2014). It is natural for a place to become deserted if the inhabitants tend to move out to the urban areas. Thus, villages and communities in rural areas would fade away when there are no residents who create activities.\n\nDue to Jämtland Härjedalen’s low population density, the county experiences difficulties regarding societal, economic, and business access to infrastructure and services, more particularly in the remote areas (Jonsson and Pettersson 2020, p. 23). Jämtland Härjedalen is one of the biggest counties in Sweden and offers a wide variety of famous tourist destinations (Schmudde and Sörensson 2020). The vibrant cultural life in Jämtland Härjedalen offers excellent potential for businesses to grow in the cultural and creative sectors. Due to its cognizance of and close relationships to the rural area and its industry, Östersund (the capital of the county) has been named a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of food (Jonsson and Pettersson 2020). This increases the county’s chances for positive and long-lasting social and economic community development which is overlooked. Therefore, the problem lies in the development of the region of Jämtland Härjedalen and the virtue of it by the inter-collaboration of local actors.\n\nThe regional community is in the hands of the entrepreneurs and start-ups, which play a pivotal role despite large corporations’ importance in revitalizing the economy (Ivanova and Cepel 2018; Zaušková and Madlenák 2012). Entrepreneurs behind start-ups may be distinguished by their high level of innovation, flexibility (Santisteban et al. 2021), ability to expand employment opportunities (Dobeš et al. 2017), and cover market gaps. These respond to regional development and the employment opportunities within such regions (Hudakova 2018).\n\nCurrent research in regional development emphasizes mostly tourism and its development on such regions (Ollivaud and Haxton 2019). The majority of the studies have also concentrated on the contributions of entrepreneurship in regional development among others (Głodowska 2017; Pietrzak et al. 2017; Yay et al. 2018) which includes different geographical contexts. Thus, it is noteworthy to mention that entrepreneurs contribute to production, employment, and regional development (Hudakova 2018). However, due to the rich socio-cultural characteristics of the region in focus, both tourists’ and entrepreneurs’ interests are attracted to the municipalities. One of the most efficient ways to preserve the regional and rural areas is to promote social entrepreneurship (Von Friedrichs et al. 2014) as the goal is to see and create opportunities at the regional level as well as to develop the regional area and make it more appealing to the residents. According to Revko (2017), social entrepreneurs can actively prevent the issue of depopulation by taking on development projects that make the region more active. With that said, the research of social entrepreneurship within regional development has been limitedly explored (Christmann 2014; Friedman and Desivilya 2010) herein focusing on other factors such as the point of contention between entrepreneurs and the regional development as well as focusing on other geographical locations.\n\nSince the municipality of Jämtland Härjedalen has seen a great opportunity and has therefore invested in innovation, research, and competency development (Jonsson and Pettersson 2020) with the aim of developing the region by involving a wide variety of actors (Härjedalen 2015). The purpose of this study is to address the research gaps concerning the contributions of social entrepreneurs in regional development in rural areas, using the region of Jämtland Härjedalen as a study area thus seeking to answer the questions of:\n\nQ1: How can social entrepreneurs be attracted to the region?\n\nQ2: How can social entrepreneurs’ contributions impact regional development?\n\nQ3: How to stimulate the already established social entrepreneurs?\n\nThis research article aims to bridge the gap in understanding regional development in rural areas by examining it through the lens of social entrepreneurship. By filling this gap in the literature, the study contributes to the existing literature and offers practical implications for stakeholders involved in regional development within the region of Jämtland Härjedalen. The findings could inform policymakers, community organizations, and other relevant stakeholders on strategies and collaborations that can effectively leverage the potential of social entrepreneurship to drive sustainable regional development in rural areas.\n\n2.1 Social Entrepreneurs\n\nWith the aim of getting a better understanding of the concept “social entrepreneurship” in its popular usage requires considering both its social as well as its entrepreneurial aspects. Disparities between the two points are highlighted by matters such as what are considered to be the most prominent features of entrepreneurship also within the framework of social purposes. There have been many attempts to define entrepreneurship but a consensus on a definition of the area is unlikely. One of the earliest definitions of entrepreneurship was provided by Schumpeter (1934), who characterized entrepreneurs as innovators. Mueller et al. (2012), on the other hand, defined it as follows: “The entrepreneur is the primary actor in the formation of a new enterprise”. Startup businesses are often innovation- and technology-based and usually entrepreneurs focus heavily on the product/service and the monetary aspects of it. Nevertheless, entrepreneurship’s definition has seriously hindered attempts to develop a conceptual framework (Shane and Venkataraman 2000). In this regard, the fundamental elements of entrepreneurship are opportunity and the individual, according to Venkataraman (1997). Therefore, it can be said that entrepreneurship includes examining opportunity sources, assessing opportunities, exploiting them, as well as the people who find, assess, and take advantage of them. The opportunity for profitability may exist for entrepreneurs, but they must understand the potential of this possibility in order to take advantage of it (Shane and Venkataraman 2000).\n\nSimilar to the concept of entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship has become popular both in academia and in industrial practice but lacks a clear definition (Peredo and McLean 2006). One of the clearest definitions of social entrepreneurship was by Johnson (2000) “social entrepreneurship is emerging as an innovative approach for dealing with complex social needs”. On the other hand, Mort et al. (2003) came up with a definition of social entrepreneurship which may be considered the most elaborate; in terms of social entrepreneurship, a number of defining characteristics are intertwined, resulting in a multidimensional construct that is deeply rooted in an organization’s mission and its desire for sustainability, besides being highly influenced and shaped by environmental factors. In this sense, social entrepreneurship was not just about making money for one’s own company, but it should also work towards generating societal values and contributing to local development (Von Friedrichs et al. 2014).\n\nIn order for a social entrepreneur to encounter and act upon opportunities where others see a problem (Politis 2022), promoting regional policies thus stimulating rural economic growth and job creation, green growth, innovation, technological development, resource efficiency, and competition will be emphasized upon (Andersson and Grundel 2021). A large-scale societal transformation can also be viewed as a shift towards a production system based on renewable materials which includes waste and processed biomaterials. In reference to this, “bio-economy” is seen as a social entrepreneurial opportunity that can promote regional development and generally refers to industrial products manufactured or processed using biomass. One of the highlighted examples outside the focal region is the collaboration between the local authorities, wood building company Martinson, and Luleå Technical University for the development of Scandinavia’s longest wooden cable-stayed bridge in Skellefteå (Andersson and Grundel 2021). However, the contributions of social entrepreneurship in regional development have not had much focus; thus, García-González and Ramírez-Montoya (2019) emphasized the knowledge transfer within the Quadruple Helix Model by accentuating co-construction in open innovation. On the other hand, Iqbal et al. (2018) added to the literature the importance of the characteristics of an entrepreneur towards the development of creating solutions to socio-economic issues.\n\nUltimately, with Sweden’s booming start-up scene, Sweden now ranks second on the Global Innovation Index in both technology and sustainability, behind Switzerland (Organization 2021). Research on the developing Swedish entrepreneurial ecosystem is lacking, which is concerning given that the Swedish government wants to promote innovation to address social issues on a global scale, increase competitiveness, and improve welfare. The promotion of enhancing innovation tends to diminish the economic imbalance between the urban and rural integration (Atkinson et al. 2019). However, there is still a deficiency of research on social entrepreneurs’ contribution to the regional development, especially in Jämtland Härjedalen region.\n\n2.2 Value Propositions\n\nIt is crucial for firms to be aware of the perceptions of tourists and visitors, at the destination of Jämtland Härjedalen, concerning their experience absorption. This leads to the marketing discipline, or more precisely, to value proposition. The value proposition is a part of the value process within contemporary literature, initially emphasizing the monetary measurement of consumers’ advantages (Backhaus 2006). In general, a value proposition is a concept in which products (including goods and services) and experiences result in value (Kotler and Armstrong 2010, p. 9). Individuals, places, ideas, and social entrepreneurs may also fall into this category. It means that more emphasis is placed on the product itself in relation to the benefits and experiences that the product provides, corresponding to value creation. Companies must understand that they are selling an experience as opposed to products (Ulaga and Reinartz 2011). Exemplifying by showcasing the experience of seeing the production of chocolate at a confectionery like “Åre Chokladfabrik” (Åre Chocolate factory), local production of cheese on-site at the farm even experiencing local gastronomy. All these companies contribute to social values in the region, since they increase the job supply for locals, contribute to economic development, and nevertheless motivate locals to stay within the destination impacting the attraction of tourists as well as visitors to the destination (Fang 2020).\n\n2.3 Stakeholders\n\nConsidering the importance of institutions in interpreting and meditating on the broader economic context, their contributions are suggestively important to both local and regional development (Mincyte and Dobernig 2016). Therefore, a wide range of stakeholders have a significant contribution in improving entrepreneurial conditions, including governments, private companies, civil society, and academics (Siegel and Wright 2015). It is through the way these stakeholders shape and coordinate the investment and enterprise landscape, as well as mobilize other stakeholders around local and regional development agendas (Zhan 2021). Consecutively, policymakers together with the academics are becoming increasingly interested in how institutions contribute to economic and regional development (Berman 2012). The promotion of policy continuity and the facilitation of dialogue among key stakeholders through informal and formal institutions are essential components of the development process (Pike et al. 2017). National policymakers should focus on regulatory reforms that will facilitate the registration and operation of new businesses, as well as on ways in which the public sector can provide effective structures to support and mentor potential and existing entrepreneurs (Morris and Jones 1999). However, the current literature finds a challenging gap, being in developing organizations that support connections between the business, public, and educational sectors that reinforce the region’s voice (Vossenberg 2013).\n\nThis leads to the argument that the economic development of a country stands on the foundation of four interdependent pillars: university, industry, government, and civil society—known as the Quadruple Helix model (Iqbal et al. 2018). In this theory, the impact of these four factors on the economy of a nation is explained by inter-collaboration. It is noteworthy to mention that innovation and knowledge are the true engines of economic growth in cities and regions and an integrated innovation ecosystem can be established through a strong combination of universities, industries, and technological infrastructure (ibid). In this model, the government provides access to financial support as well as a structure for the innovation activities, while the society creates a never-ending market for innovative goods and services (Afonso et al. 2012). On the other hand, as civil society contributes to regional development in terms of emerging recreational rural activities, therefore it is important that people remain in the regions (Torre 2016). Alternatively, the purpose of educational institutions is to provide individuals with the skills they need to succeed to become entrepreneurs (Bogren et al. 2013). Ultimately, this collaboration within the Quadruple Helix Model might result in reduced business costs, improved market access, improved access to information, and the prominence of innovation (Islam et al. 2021; Kolehmainen et al. 2015).\n\nThe study area in focus is Jämtland Härjedalen, a county in central Sweden. Jämtland Härjedalen borders Norway on the west, Västerbotten on the north, Gävleborg on the south-east, Västernorrland on the east, and Dalarna in the south (Turism 2022). Jämtland Härjedalen covers 12% of Sweden’s land area, but it is home to only 1.5% of the country’s population (ibid.). The County, with the exception of Gotland, is Sweden’s least industrialized county, with only 15% of the population actively working in industry. The county’s capital is Östersund, a Swedish university city of about 51,000 people in the town, which has its own governmental entities. The municipality as a whole has approximately 64,600 inhabitants and a district surface area of 2517 km2 (Kommun, 2022). It is located near Sweden’s fifth largest lake, Storsjön. Östersund is known as the “Winter City”, with events such as the biathlon sprint and, in the summer, the “Storsjöyran”, Sweden’s oldest music festival (Oestersund 2022).\n\nThe selection of respondents in our study was carefully designed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the contributions of social entrepreneurs to regional development in rural areas. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews, involving a diverse range of stakeholders from various sectors. The inclusion of municipal representatives in the study is crucial as they play a key role in regional development policies and decision-making processes. Their insights provide valuable perspectives on the broader regional context and the contributions of social entrepreneurs within it. Destination marketing organizations (DMOs) bring expertise in promoting and attracting tourists to the region, making their input essential in understanding the potential impact of social entrepreneurship on the tourism sector. The involvement of infrastructure companies is important as they are responsible for providing essential services and facilities that enable social entrepreneurs to operate and thrive. Their perspectives shed light on the infrastructure requirements and challenges faced by social entrepreneurs in rural areas. Engaging with tourist companies allows us to examine the relationship between social entrepreneurship and the tourism industry, exploring how social entrepreneurs contribute to the development of unique and authentic tourism experiences. Including entrepreneurs themselves provides firsthand insights into their experiences, motivations, and challenges in driving regional development through their entrepreneurial endeavors. Lastly, involving university actors such as students brings academic expertise and a fresh perspective to the study and the students’ perspective of the regional development. Universities often serve as catalysts for innovation and collaboration, and understanding their role in supporting and nurturing social entrepreneurs can offer valuable insights for fostering a conducive ecosystem for regional development.\n\nBy including a diverse range of stakeholders, our study ensures a comprehensive and multifaceted understanding of the contributions of social entrepreneurs to regional development in rural areas. The insights gained from these interviews provide a rich and nuanced exploration of the contributions of social entrepreneurship and its potential for sustainable and inclusive regional growth in the specific context of Jämtland Härjedalen.\n\nIn addition to primary data, secondary data was gathered from websites and various reports. Interpretive analysis was performed on the data, which included developing themes. The following themes were taken into consideration: (1) social entrepreneurs, (2) value proposition, and (3) stakeholders (Table 5.1).\n\nThe study was conducted in a qualitative format (Järvensivu and Törnroos 2010) and we found that several topics in the available research have been omitted and under-researched, indicating a need to expand the research. Therefore, an abductive technique for theory creation has been applied in order to strengthen the existing theory in regional development. Thus, the gap-spotting theory of Sandberg and Alvesson (2011) supported providing a new perspective and a more comprehensive understanding thus identifying the under-researched topic of social entrepreneurship within the literature.\n\nThe primary aim of this research was to delve into the intricate role of social entrepreneurs in nurturing regional development within rural areas, with a specific focus on the captivating study area of Jämtland Härjedalen. To accomplish this objective, the study employed a meticulous thematic analysis method, skillfully utilizing a preselected set of codes tailored to address the research questions and align with the existing research framework. These codes revolved around two key domains: (1) exploring the characteristics and contributions of social entrepreneurship and (2) unraveling the dynamics of regional development. The data analysis offered a profound interpretation of the identified themes and patterns, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the research topic at hand. The data analysis procedure followed a well-defined coding protocol consisting of several steps inspired by Braun and Clarke (2006). Initially, the transcripts of the semi-structured interviews were thoroughly reviewed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the data. Initial codes were then generated to capture the essence of the data in relation to the research questions and key themes. These initial codes served as broad categories encompassing the overall meaning and relevance of the data. Subsequently, the data was revisited, and additional codes were refined and introduced to capture more specific themes and patterns. These emergent codes were carefully aligned with the research questions and key themes, including social entrepreneurship contributions, stakeholder roles, destination value propositions, inter-collaboration dynamics, and the intriguing Quadruple Helix Model. For a deeper analysis of the connections and patterns between the codes, the codes were grouped together based on their similarities and differences, ultimately revealing overarching themes that emerged from the data. Inspired by the insights of Braun and Clarke (2006, p. 79), this thematic analysis framework facilitated the identification, interpretation, and reporting of the patterns and themes within the data, adding clarity and transparency to the analytical process. The chosen approach guaranteed the rigor and replicability of the analysis, instilling confidence in the research findings.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore regional development within Jämtland Härjedalen and doing so by uncovering the research gaps in the contributions of social entrepreneurs in it.\n\nTo have a better understanding of the contributions of social entrepreneurs in regional development, the matter of a theoretical standpoint of social entrepreneurship definition is necessary. According to the findings and the literature review, there is a general lack of agreement about what constitutes entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship. However, it was pointed out through the findings that what distinguishes them are the contributions to the market which further defined their purpose. Even though the lines that define them are not that clear, entrepreneurship is mainly defined as the construct that involves the discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities resulting in innovative products (entailing both goods and services) and/or experiences. On the other hand, the definition of social entrepreneurship only added that it uses innovative approaches to deal with social needs and issues.\n\nThe region Jämtland Härjedalen is a sparsely populated area that has invested in innovation, research, and competency development since these are crucial for the development of the region. Attractions can be in different facets, but one attraction is the natural place of interest of Jämtland Härjedalen. According to the findings, the entrepreneurs come to the region to get inspiration and thus deliver values to the overall society by using innovation and creativity in their business model. This is supported by the literature of value proposition as being inspired and becoming creative is the antecedent of being innovative. Therefore, in order to attract social entrepreneurs to the region, a sense of inspiration, such as cultural-heritage or socio-cultural conception should be easy to exploit. Therefore, it is crucial for the companies to know about what consumers need and want in order to achieve long-term relationship in terms of product and experience.\n\nIn line with that, it is crucially important to take into consideration the opportunities and possibilities that social entrepreneurs have in Jämtland Härjedalen compared to the developed bigger cities in Sweden. However, the smaller cities and rural areas offer a greater deal of culture-heritage activities which might appeal to the inhabitants as well as the potential inhabitants than larger cities, herein the case of Jämtland Härjedalen offers a welcoming rural experience in terms of gastronomy and outdoor activities that are unique. The findings have supported and corroborated that in order to attract social entrepreneurs to the region is by offering an inspirational sense of motive that can encourage the local inhabitants to remain in the region with the aim of impacting the attraction of tourists and visitors. The inspirational sense of motive can be within the possibility bounds of stimulating the cultural-heritage transitive, local gastronomy, and outdoor activities. Furthermore, this approach also concerns the stimulation of the already established social entrepreneurs within the region. Consistent with the findings, the establishment of social entrepreneurs first-movers will promote a chain reaction of an induced inspirations which triggers the stimulation of the already established social entrepreneurs.\n\nOn the other hand, Jämtland Härjedalen is seeking competency development from outside of the region (Jonsson and Pettersson 2020) which also includes a connection to the research development by involving Mid Sweden University within the Quadruple Helix Model. In line with the collected data, Mid Sweden University benefits a considerable amount of knowledge and cultural diversity from Erasmus students mainly from Germany, but also from other European countries, among others, such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, Poland, and Finland.\n\nMid Sweden University has two campuses: one in Sundsvall in the county of Västernorrland, and one in Östersund, the capital of the county of Jämtland. The university offers in a total of 480 courses, 60 educational programs at bachelor level, 37 educational programs at master-, and a one-year master level (MIUN 2022). Overall Mid Sweden University has 24,500 students, where of 6000 are on campuses (ca. 3000 at each campus) (ibid.). Since Mid Sweden University accounts for half of the addition of newly qualified graduates in Jämtland Härjedalen and Västernorrland counties (ibid.), we think it is useful to take the students and their origin into consideration in this analysis. According to Mid Sweden University’s latest annual report 2021, it is obvious that both, outgoing and incoming students, have decreased significantly during the pandemic years as compared to until 2019 (Sörensen 2021). This can be explained by the significant insecurity that has been ongoing since the pandemic started. By interviewing the international students, it was identified that they would like to stay longer but the possibilities that stimulate them to stay are limited. In reference to a respondent, “what I am going to do tomorrow!?”.\n\nOn the other hand, the numbers also show that tourists from Germany and the Netherlands have a positive impression of central Sweden and desire to stay longer in undisturbed nature in sparsely populated areas, where livability can be practiced by connecting hosts and visitors. Considering the year 2021, the county of Jämtland Härjedalen received 11.3 million guest nights, where 3.1 million were business travelers (Turism 2022). Under usual conditions (before the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine), it is a fact that Germany is the largest group of foreign business travelers (61,769 guest nights) to Jämtland Härjedalen after the neighboring country of Norway (306,115 guest nights) based on 2019 data (Turism 2022). However, a considerable amount of German or Dutch students have become attracted by the region during their education program which resulted in a longer stay for them than initially planned.\n\nMoreover, the aforementioned target group could support the development of the socio-cultural industry in Jämtland Härjedalen by stimulating their capability and creativity into praxis. On the other hand, the already existing socio-cultural ideas and creativity might stimulate and promote “foreign” social entrepreneurs to act on potential ideas and creativity, which in turn might contribute the regional development in the sense of creating a more attracting and welcoming destination with unmatched local experiences.\n\nBy developing the prominence of the various stakeholders such as MIUN innovation, university students including Erasmus students, but also local civils in Jämtland Härjedalen, could encourage the development of socio-cultural ideas which in turn could lead to innovative products and/or experiences. Furthermore, the role of government authorities such as municipalities is crucial in terms of policymaking and creating frameworks to support entrepreneurs and their activities. Furthermore, in line with the study by Iqbal et al. (2018) which has examined, among others, the collaboration among the Quadruple Helix sectors that encourage social entrepreneurial ventures in Pakistan, where social entrepreneurship has not been explored to its fullest potential in terms of research and understanding. Their study discovered that the development of entrepreneurial-related factors (human capital, social capital, and motivational factors), as well as the ultimate development of sustainable social initiatives, depends on the interdependency of the university, government, industry, and civil society. Thus, their study concludes that the collaboration within the Quadruple Helix Model aids in the creation of long-term social entrepreneurship.\n\nConsequently, the study works as an inspiration that a similar thorough study can be conducted within the context of Jämtland Härjedalen with the intention of increasing the contributions of social entrepreneurship in the region supporting the problematization of regional development as mentioned earlier. Having said that, the factors that play a crucial role in determining entrepreneurship in a given economy include the availability of funding, the entrepreneurship education, the regulatory environment, access to markets, and political commitment that enhances the innovative and entrepreneurial capacity (Herrington and Kew 2017). According to the findings, the Quadruple Helix Model fosters regional development by intricating a joined collaboration that can stimulate the contributions of social entrepreneurs in the regional development.\n\nThe growth of regional social entrepreneurship can, in the first place, be influenced by regional as well as local policymakers and as a result, the policymakers should place more of an emphasis on information accessibility that can help entrepreneurs obtain better information about business registration as well as operation. As it was already noted, the region of Jämtland Härjedalen faces challenges in terms of sociological, economic, and commercial access to both infrastructure and services. Therefore, a more specialized focus should be paid to recognizing the requirements of start-ups and expanding businesses based on their industry, size, as well as other operational factors. Consequently, there will be a greater interest in and demand for starting companies by improving the support systems, ideally developed by among others the trade and industry sector, for stimulating social entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the (social) entrepreneurs may benefit from the provided mentorship networks as they embark on their journeys by providing inspiration, guidance, and support. A follow-up step would be for the start-up culture in the region to develop incubators and accelerators that could support (social) entrepreneurs in their business ventures, even though mentioning the already established MIUN innovation, as an incubator. The creation of clusters and business hubs that integrate (social) entrepreneurs, commercial partners, and professionals is essential in order to assist start-up companies in a more protected and supportive environment. Ergo, this is crucial, since specifically rural and semi-rural areas lack adequate infrastructure, which is a major development hindrance for entrepreneurship.\n\nHowever, the presence of a collaboration within the Quadruple Helix Model promotes the development of the entrepreneurial landscape in the region as the inter-collaboration between stakeholders plays a significant role. This is in the virtue of that there will be a focus on key issues such as the limited support for entrepreneurs such as financial access, socio-cultural opportunities, and the motivation towards youth entrepreneurs. Since the collaboration within the Quadruple Helix Model facilitates the contributions of all the stakeholders, it can be said that from the educational perspective, there is a wide gap between industry and the knowledge/know-how that educational institutions provide which further motivates the reasoning that a collaboration within the Quadruple Helix Model is needed. The implication of this particular study can contribute to the development of competencies and skills for potential entrepreneurs as well as inducing on the challenging gap mentioned before, being: developing organizations that support connections between the business, public, and educational sectors that reinforce the region’s voice. This leads to the potentiality of future research on the implementation and implications of the agent-based theory among the stakeholders. We also strive to contribute to the current literature of regional development by highlighting the uncovered topic of social entrepreneurship and its contribution to the regional growth of rural areas. And that within the context of Jämtland Härjedalen which is considered one of the most distinguished tourist destinations in Sweden."
