        "text": "Historical background and context\n\nGeneral administrative and health system context\n\nSweden has three administrative levels: national, regional (21 county councils, including four regional bodies; some county councils have become regions by taking on more responsibilities for regional development) and local (290 municipalities). Municipalities (and county councils) vary considerably in size, both in terms of area and in terms of the number of inhabitants: from 9km2 (Sundbyberg) to 19 155km2 (Kiruna) and from 2450 inhabitants (Bjurholm) to approximately 923 500 inhabitants (Stockholm).\n\nThere is no hierarchical relationship between municipalities, county councils and regions, since all have their own self-governing local authorities with responsibilities for different services. This administrative set-up is based on a tradition of local democracy which is very strong in Sweden. Elected representatives in the municipalities, county councils and regions take decisions about the services that are closest to their citizens and they have independent powers of taxation (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012).\n\nAt the county level, political decisions are undertaken by the county council, which is an assembly elected by the county’s inhabitants ( ), and by the county administrative board. The boards represent the government (i.e. have government authority) and are tasked with ensuring that the objectives that the national government and parliament have established are met, while at the same time taking the county’s abilities into consideration (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2013).\n\nFigure 10-1\n\nSweden’s three administrative levels.\n\nPublic health work takes place at all the different levels of government, and is not restricted to the health system only. As the current public health policy is directed towards the determinants of health, intersectoral collaboration is key to successful implementation.\n\nThe three independent levels of Swedish government are all involved in the health system. At the national level, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs is responsible for overall health and health care policy, working in concert with national government agencies directly involved in the areas of health, health care, and public health. However, the funding and provision of services lie largely with the county councils and regions (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012). Health is also important in other sectors, especially when it comes to complex problems, such as reducing sick leave absenteeism.\n\nThe county councils or regions are mainly responsible for regional development, local transport and planning and for providing health services, including public health. They manage, on behalf of the regional government, the provision of publicly funded health care. They own the majority of public health facilities (at the level of primary care and hospitals). They can also finance provision of health care services by private health care providers. The regional level is also important as regards the county administrative boards, which work on behalf of the national level, for instance in the implementation of policies concerning alcohol, narcotics, doping and tobacco.\n\nThe local level (municipalities) is responsible for the welfare of its residents, providing child day care, primary and secondary level education, care for older people and people with disabilities, including nursing homes for older and mentally ill people, social welfare (including social care for people with addiction problems) and physical planning. Responsibility for health protection in terms of reducing the risk of environmental hazards to health (e.g. problems with water and sanitation) also lies with the municipalities (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012).\n\nPublic health in Sweden\n\nPublic health (in Swedish “folkhälsa”) has been defined in one Swedish public health dictionary as “an expression of the health status of the population, which considers both the level and the distribution of health” (Janlert, 2000). This definition includes both the overall health status of the population and health inequalities among various population groups. This notion of public health is commonly accepted in the Swedish health sector.\n\nIn the national public health policy (Government Bill 2002/03:35. “Mål för folkhälsan” [Targets for public health]), adopted in 2002 and renewed in 2008, public health is understood as being closely related to the social determinants of health outside the health sector (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2013) (see ). However, publicly financed health services, including public health and preventive services, are seen as playing an important role in improving population health (The Commonwealth Fund, 2016). Health services are part of the general welfare system that also includes schools, child daycare, care of the elderly and social care.\n\nFigure 10-2\n\nHealth determinants, according to Dahlgren & Whitehead (1991), modified by the Public Health Agency of Sweden.\n\nWhile health services are important from a preventive point of view, for example for the control of communicable diseases, public health actions outside the health care sector have more significant impact on public health, as described in the following sections. The national public health policy includes all determinants of health, focusing action on policies that create societal conditions for good health ( ).\n\nOrganizational structures\n\nOverview of the organization of public health services\n\nSweden has a long tradition of preventing ill-health. Since the turn of the 19th century, for example, Sweden has implemented restrictive policies on alcohol consumption. Maternal and child health services were established as early as the 1940s and already in the 1950s Sweden had an infant mortality rate of 20 per 1000 live births, which was partly attributable to the extensive coverage of maternal and child health services (Burström, 2003).\n\nThere are several laws regulating the provision of health care in Sweden, including the Health and Medical Services Act of 1982, which states the overall objective of health and medical care: “Good health care on equal terms for the entire population”. The Act specifies that the responsibility for ensuring that everyone living in Sweden has access to good health care lies with the county councils, regions and municipalities. The Act gives county councils and municipalities considerable freedom with regard to the organization of their health services, including public health services such as health promotion and disease prevention. As a result of this Act, public health services such as vaccination programmes became the responsibility of county councils. Care for older and disabled people by municipalities is regulated, among others, by the Social Services Act of 1980, which states that older people have the right to receive public services and help at all stages of life.\n\nCurrent vision for public health, its strategies and goals\n\nSince 2003 Sweden has had a comprehensive national public health policy (Targets for public health). The policy has an overall goal and eleven objective domains for public health efforts (Government Bill 2002/03:35. “Mål för folkhälsan” [Targets for public health]).\n\nThe overall aim of the national public health policy is to create societal conditions for “good health on equal terms for the entire population”. The objective domains, renewed in 2008 (2007/08:110), are:\n\nParticipation and influence in society\n\nEconomic and social prerequisites\n\nConditions during childhood and adolescence\n\nHealth in working life\n\nEnvironment and products\n\nHealth-promoting health services\n\nProtection against communicable diseases\n\nSexuality and reproductive health\n\nPhysical activity\n\nEating habits and food\n\nTobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs and gambling\n\nAs in many other Swedish policy documents, equity issues are underlined. Public health is viewed in a wide sense, as involving all sectors of society and different administrative levels.\n\nThe Swedish government has adopted a new cohesive strategy for alcohol, narcotic drugs, doping and tobacco policy for the years 2016–2020. Other relevant strategies include the National Strategy for HIV prevention 2006–2016, the National Strategy to prevent and treat chronic diseases 2014–2017, and the National Strategy to combat antibiotic resistance.\n\nMain actors\n\nMuch of the national public health policy is about creating societal conditions which are conducive to good health, through actions on structural determinants of health. Efforts have, for instance, been made to reduce smoking by legislation (e.g. a ban on smoking in public places, age limit for purchasing tobacco, tax on tobacco). Legislation is also important in creating good working conditions. Other legal documents (e.g. the Discrimination Act) prohibit discrimination on a number of grounds.\n\nEach administrative level is important when it comes to addressing public health challenges. The national level issues laws, regulations and policies and sometimes leads specific initiatives, usually with earmarked funds, setting the direction for local and regional level policies. Within the government, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Socialdepartementet) is responsible for public health matters. The current minister has the title “Minister for Health Care, Public Health and Sport”. Other ministries can also be directly or indirectly involved in matters related to public health. At the national level there are also a number of agencies that are relevant to public health, with the Public Health Agency of Sweden being the leading one. Other relevant national agencies include the National Board of Health and Welfare, the National Food Agency, the Medical Products Agency, and agencies that do not fall under the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, such as the Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society, Family Law and Parental Support Authority, the Swedish National Agency for Education, etc.\n\nThe county administrative board that represents the national government in each county plays a particularly important role with regards to policies concerning alcohol, illicit drugs, doping and tobacco. County councils and municipalities are represented at the national level by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR), which participates on behalf of its members in discussions on policies regarding public health matters (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012). In addition to these public authorities, there are a number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are involved in specific public health issues, e.g. promoting physical activity (such as the Swedish Sports Confederation). The main actors in public health services, their tasks, roles and responsibilities, are described below.\n\nPublic Health Agency of Sweden\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden is the key agency with responsibilities for public health issues at the national level. The agency develops and supports activities to promote health, prevent illness and improve preparedness for health threats, with most of its activities being focused outside the health sector. It was established on 1 January 2014 in a merger of the Swedish National Institute of Public Health (Folkhälsoinstitutet) and the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet). Most of the work concerning environmental health and the responsibility for environment and public health reports at the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) was also transferred to the new agency. On 1 July 2015 the Public Health Agency also took over the coordinating responsibility for communicable diseases (which was previously, and in part, the responsibility of the National Board of Health and Welfare). By coordinating these activities, the new authority will be able to operate across the public health spectrum and integrate communicable disease control with other public health work. The aim is to develop a national hub for knowledge support that can promote public health practice in society and make it more effective. The merger is also hoped to provide better opportunities to work effectively within the European Union and other intergovernmental agencies.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden is responsible for the collection and analysis of data on the health status of the population. It disseminates scientifically based knowledge to promote health and prevent disease and injury (with its web site becoming an increasingly important dissemination channel). This constitutes a knowledge base that regions, county councils and municipalities use in their preventive work. However, with some exceptions, the Agency does not assist in the actual implementation at local and regional levels. The Agency is also responsible for health promotion in mental health, lifestyle and the physical environment; coordinated monitoring within alcohol, narcotics, doping and tobacco, and compiles, analyses and disseminates knowledge in order to prevent related illness; the country’s overall communicable disease control; microbiological laboratory analysis, preparedness and outbreak support. It is also engaged in public health work within organizations including the European Union (EU) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe Public Health Agency works on instruction from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. The agency is accountable to the government through the Ministry.\n\nNational Board of Health and Welfare\n\nThe National Board of Health and Welfare is a large government agency, engaged in a wide range of activities in the areas of social services, health care services and environmental health. The Board produces and develops statistics (on medicines, causes of death and financial support), regulations and knowledge base for the government, for those working in health and medical care and social care, and for different groups in society, such as children, elderly people, and people with mental illnesses and disabilities. The Board monitors how health and social care functions where matters such as access to personnel, waiting times and accessibility are concerned. It also evaluates and issues licences for personnel in 21 occupational groups, including pharmacists, doctors, naprapaths, psychologists and dentists.\n\nNational Food Agency\n\nThe National Food Agency is responsible for environmental issues in the food sector. It is an autonomous government agency reporting to the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation. Its tasks include guiding consumers towards healthy dietary habits (through recommendations and communication); ensuring food safety, including controlling the quality of drinking water (carried out by the National Food Agency at the national level, the county administrations at the regional level and the municipal Environment and Health Protection Committees at the local level).\n\nMedical Products Agency\n\nThe Medical Products Agency is the Swedish national authority responsible for the regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacture and sale of drugs and other medicinal products.\n\nSwedish Work Environment Authority\n\nThe Swedish Work Environment Authority is responsible for monitoring implementation of laws concerning the work environment (the Work Environment Act SFS 1977:1160). It is accountable to the Ministry of Employment. It carries out inspections that are aimed, among other things, at strengthening workplaces’ own ability to prevent risks. It may impose penalties.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO)\n\nThe Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO) is a government agency responsible for supervising health care, social services and activities under the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments. It supervises both services and health care professionals in their professional activities.\n\nThe Swedish Agency for Participation\n\nThe Swedish Agency for Participation ensures that disability policy is followed. It does so through monitoring and analysing developments; proposing methods, guidelines and guidance; disseminating knowledge; initiating research and other development work; and providing support and proposing measures to government.\n\nThe Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV)\n\nThe Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV) is a central government agency whose remit is to determine whether a pharmaceutical product or dental care procedure shall be subsidized by the state. It also contributes to ensuring quality service and accessibility of pharmacies.\n\nSwedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU)\n\nThe Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) is an independent national authority, tasked by the government with assessing health care interventions, covering medical, economic, ethical and social aspects. SBU assessments are based on “systematic literature reviews” of published research. The Agency was founded in 1987.\n\nFormal administrative structure of public health services at the various tiers of administration\n\nThe national public health policy is cross-sectoral and covers several policy areas, such as education, gender equality, employment, ageing and family life. The implementation of public health policy is coordinated at the national level, but much of the responsibility for implementation lies with regions and county councils (with regard to health services) and municipalities (with regard, for instance, to environmental issues, physical planning, school education and other social services).\n\nThe national public health policy envisages that health services should do more to promote the health of patients, including through empowering them to make decisions and be more actively involved in their treatment (WHO, 2016a). It also envisages health services putting more effort into disease prevention and health promotion, and that health workers should have a good working environment and serve as examples for patients in terms of health behaviours. In practice, this means, for example, offering smoking cessation services to patients undergoing planned surgery, with the goal of reducing rates of complications and wound infections (Sadr Azodi et al., 2009).\n\nAccording to the 1982 Health and Medical Services Act, health promotion and disease prevention at the population level is the responsibility of county councils. These activities are partly integrated into curative health care services (which are the primary responsibility of county councils and regions). While there are guidelines for health care providers on how health care services should work to improve individual health-related behaviours, it is the county councils and regions (and not the health care providers) that are ultimately responsible for health promotion and disease prevention. For that reason, each county council usually has some organizational structure for community-oriented health promotion and disease prevention.\n\nCounty councils also have clinics for occupational and environmental medicine, with some outpatient services for referred patients with work or environment-related ill-health. County councils are also responsible for monitoring public health and the health of the population in general. Each county council or region has a medical officer for infectious diseases (Smittskyddsläkare) responsible for reporting the incidence of infectious diseases to the Public Health Agency of Sweden, which coordinates infectious disease control. Reporting and other related actions on infectious disease control are regulated in the Law on Infectious Diseases (Smittskyddslagen, SFS 2004:168). The office of the medical officer for infectious diseases at the county council or region is also responsible for monitoring hygiene and health care-related infections in hospitals and other health care settings.\n\nThe county administrative boards are tasked with disseminating the aims and objectives of the national policy on alcohol, illicit drugs, tobacco and doping (ANDT) throughout the county and with contributing to and supporting the development of structured, long-term, knowledge-based work. They do so in cooperation with other stakeholders, including the municipalities. In 2012, 75% of municipalities had a municipal ANDT coordinator (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2012).\n\nMunicipalities have statutory responsibility for many important determinants of health such as child care, preschool activities, schools, care for older people, social services, planning and building issues, water and sewerage, and waste management, and can additionally provide other services such as housing, energy, recreational activities, cultural activities and other services. Health promotion at the level of municipalities may include providing family centres and opening preschools, offering various types of parental support, ensuring that more children and young people complete their compulsory schooling with basic qualifications and providing more opportunities for physical activity in schools (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2015a).\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Sweden has monitored how municipalities and county councils organize their public health initiatives (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2013). In most county councils public health was included in comprehensive planning documents, and many also had a specific public health policy or strategy. In the municipalities it was common for public health to be included in goal-setting documents and half of municipalities had a public health policy, strategy or action plan.\n\nPublic health services within curative health care services\n\nHealth promotion and disease prevention are to a large degree integrated into the primary health care services provided by county councils, although public health work goes beyond curative health care services. Primary health care services are offered to all free of charge for children, pregnant women and mothers. Preventive and health promotion services provided within curative care are usually directed at individual patients. They mainly comprise maternal and child health services (see below).\n\nIn 2011, the National Board of Health and Welfare issued national guidelines on how health care services should work to address individual health-related behaviours by supporting patients to change unhealthy lifestyles, for example through smoking cessation, increasing physical activity, reducing hazardous use of alcohol and changing unhealthy eating habits (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2011). The importance of health-related behaviours is recognized and promoted in the treatment of certain conditions (such as elevated blood lipid levels, hypertension, diabetes and depression) both in primary and specialist care (but is often complemented with pharmacological treatment). The guidelines are currently being implemented and a recent evaluation has shown that there is a need for continued efforts to strengthen implementation (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2015b).\n\nMaternal health services offer early visits to establish pregnancy, followed by more frequent visits as the pregnancy progresses. One aim is the early identification of high-risk pregnancies, which are then referred to specialist services.\n\nThe child health programme includes a series of scheduled visits for children aged 0–6 (including one early home visit) during which growth and development are monitored and childhood immunizations administered. The immunization programme covers polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, parotitis, rubella and serious infections caused by pneumococci. Immunization coverage is over 90%. In 2013, more than 95% of all pupils in 6th grade had full coverage against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, parotitis and rubella (Public Health Agency of Sweden, 2015). In addition, girls are offered the vaccine against human papilloma virus (HPV) and vaccination against tuberculosis is offered to groups at high risk. Some vaccinations are delivered within school health services, which are operated by the municipalities and are available to primary and secondary school children.\n\nYouth clinics, run jointly by the county councils and municipal social services, provide services to adolescents and young adults up to 24 years of age. The services are particularly focused on sexual health and contraceptive use. Youth clinics employ medical doctors, social workers, psychologists, and, in addition to health services, also provide social services.\n\nHospitals and specialist outpatient clinics mainly focus on curative treatment, but follow national guidelines regarding preventive measures for specific diseases.\n\nEnforcement of public health policies and regulations\n\nEnforcement of public health legislation concerns, among other things, the control of infectious diseases, guided by the Law on Communicable Diseases (Smittskyddslagen, SFS 2004: 168). Contact tracing is done by different levels of the health system, including primary care, and reported to the Public Health Agency. The overall responsibility for the control of infectious diseases lies with the county councils and regions.\n\nCounty councils, regions and municipalities carry out extensive public health efforts within all 11 national objective domains set out in the national public health policy (see above). Most county councils and regions and over half the municipalities use specific indicators to measure goal attainment in their public health efforts (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2013). There are many other areas where indicators are available, and can be used to evaluate or compare the results of public health work. For instance, the “Öppna jämförelser” [Open comparisons] contain information on quality, results and costs within several areas that municipalities, county councils and regions are responsible for, including public health, health care, social care, safety, compulsory and upper secondary school (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2015a). Another example is the monitoring system related to the government’s strategy for alcohol, narcotic drugs, doping and tobacco, where some indicators are available at the regional or local level.\n\nWithin health care services, the law on the free establishment of primary care clinics and the introduction of patient choice in primary care in 2010 made primary care doctors only responsible for the individuals on their lists and not for the population living in their vicinity, which had been the case previously. In the opinion of the municipalities, this has created confusion as to who is responsible for population health, beyond prevention and health promotion at the level of individual patients. The reform changed the mechanism for resource allocation in primary health care (according to the principle of “money follows the patient”), whereas previously politicians could decide where to locate a new clinic based on the needs of the population. Since 2010, most new primary care clinics have been established in already well-served urban areas.\n\nIntersectoral collaborations and partnerships\n\nWhile there is no permanent organizational structure for intersectoral cooperation in the area of public health, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has some responsibility for this at the national level, although it is not the only agency with such responsibilities. The Public Health Agency is the national coordinating agency for suicide prevention; is responsible for coordinated monitoring in the area of alcohol, narcotics, doping and tobacco; is responsible for overall supervision under the Alcohol and Tobacco Acts; has overall national responsibility for protecting the population against communicable diseases and coordinates communicable disease control on a national level; coordinates national efforts concerning antibiotic resistance, infection control and health care-associated infections; and is responsible for national coordination regarding prevention of HIV infections and STI (sexually transmitted infections).\n\nExamples of intersectoral collaboration can be found at all administrative levels (national, regional and local), especially around specific public health issues such as the implementation of the ANDT policy. Many NGOs are also involved in the work on specific public health issues (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2013).\n\nThe financing of public health services\n\nIn 2013, 3.7% of total health expenditure was spent on prevention and public health services, according to the WHO Global Health Expenditure database (WHO, 2016b). For unclear reasons, a slightly lower figure (3.1%) is given for the same year in the Eurostat (Eurostat, 2016) and OECD databases (OECD, 2015). It is difficult to pinpoint costs relating specifically to public health services, as this depends on the definition of such services. In Sweden public health services take place at different administrative levels and not always under the heading “public health”. The description below pertains mainly to the level of county councils and regions, which are responsible for health services.\n\nExpenditure on public health is derived from national, regional and local sources and is mostly based on taxation. In 2013, about 90% of county councils’ total spending was on health care (The Commonwealth Fund, 2016). The majority (68% in 2013) of county councils’ total revenues comes from local taxes; subsidies and national government grants accounted for 18% of their total expenditure in 2013. The county councils and municipalities levy proportional income taxes on their populations. User fees are also applied; out-of-pocket payments accounted for 16.3% of total expenditure on health in 2013. There are high taxes on tobacco and on alcohol, but these are not earmarked for public health. General government grants are designed to reallocate some resources among poorer and richer municipalities and county councils. Targeted government grants finance specific initiatives, such as HIV/AIDS prevention. Otherwise the county councils are responsible for financing and providing health services within the region, funded by their local taxes (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012). As the responsibility for organizing and financing health care rests with the county councils and municipalities, services vary throughout the country.\n\nCounty councils regulate the establishment of new private primary care practices that are eligible for public funding through conditions for accreditation. A private health care provider must have an agreement with the county council in order to be publicly reimbursed (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012). Health professionals employed by the county councils working with public health issues have similar employment and salary conditions as those working in other areas of health care.\n\nIt is up to each county council to decide on the mechanisms for paying providers and therefore provider payment varies across the country. In primary care, following the 2010 reform focusing on choice and privatization, a combination of fixed payment in the form of capitation (fixed prospective payment for registered patients), variable payment based on visits, and performance-based payment based on achieving certain goals has been used for allocating resources to providers. Two overarching models for paying providers are used in practice. In Stockholm county council about 40% of the payment is based on capitation, whereas more than 55% is variable, based on visits by registered and non-registered patients and about 3% of the payment is performance-based. In all other county councils more than 80% (up to 98%) of the total payment is based on capitation. The remainder consists of variable payments based on visits (user fees for a visit to the doctor range from SEK 150 to SEK 200 in primary care, but there is a ceiling so that an individual should not pay more than SEK 1100 for outpatient visits in one year), primarily for non-registered patients, and a small proportion (2–3%) of performance-based payment (Anell, Glenngård & Merkur, 2012). In county councils where performance-based payment is used, this is linked to achieving usually fewer than 20 targets. Examples of indicators used to determine targets include preventive services, patient satisfaction (based on surveys), registration in national registers (e.g. for diabetes), and compliance with the recommendations from the county councils’ drug formulary committee. Most preventive services are provided free of charge. Some counties charge user fees (about SEK 150) for screening services (cervical cancer screening; fees for mammography were abolished in July 2016), but others provide these services free of charge.\n\nThe public health workforce\n\nPrecise information on the public health workforce in Sweden is limited. The country has followed a determinants-based approach to public health, which makes it hard to delineate who is part of the public health workforce. As municipalities are responsible for many important determinants of health, the part of their workforce specifically dealing with such issues could be included in the public health workforce, but no estimates are available. Some national government agencies (notably the Public Health Agency of Sweden with a workforce of almost 500 persons) may also be regarded as part of the public health workforce.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint who are the public health workers – should we include child care staff (who provide high-quality childcare for the benefit of children growing up healthy) and teachers and staff in schools, or should only those with a job title saying “public health” be included?\n\nMuch of the “traditional” public health work is performed by health care staff working in health care facilities or by municipal employees (particularly with regards to environmental health). There are local and regional public health coordinators and ANDT-coordinators. Municipalities can have (several) public health councils with officials and area managers. Unlike in many other European countries, there are few specific professional positions in the area of public health, but many health professionals in Sweden also have a public health education. Traditionally, many public health activities in health care services have been performed within primary care and paediatrics and within infectious disease control. As explained above, some public health services are integrated into primary care and performed by primary care practitioners. Some county councils, such as Stockholm county council, also have special public health units. Each county council or region has a medical officer for infectious diseases.\n\nWhile training in public health is available (the major Swedish universities offer Bachelor and Master level degrees in public health), few regular positions are available for those with such a degree. Some public health graduates go into research, while some work at the public health units in the county councils or in occupational health services at the municipal level (some municipalities employ coordinators of public health issues), but there are many other positions as well, for example working on lifestyle interventions in the health sector or private companies.\n\nThe medical specialty most concerned with public health in Sweden is that of social medicine. It is a small specialty with about 100 specialists, of whom 80% are over 50 years of age (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2005). Although there is a growing interest in public health, there are few training positions open to young doctors who want to specialize in social medicine. County councils are the main employers, but they have little demand for specialists – only a few county councils have positions for specialists in social medicine. Some have combined positions that involve research and teaching at universities and advising county councils on public health issues. Some social medicine specialists work at the regional level.\n\nAnother medical specialty that deals with public health issues is that of occupational and environmental medicine, where doctors are trained in ill-health and diseases related to work and the environment. Graduates can work as occupational medicine doctors in private enterprises or at county councils which provide occupational and environmental medicine services, including for referred patients. Larger clinics are sometimes linked to university hospitals and also carry out research in occupational and environmental medicine.\n\nSpecialists in primary care (general practitioners) have traditionally been much involved in prevention and health promotion in their catchment area. Recent reforms in primary care have shifted the focus more to individual listed patients rather than the population.\n\nQuality assurance and performance measurement\n\nEvery year, certain indicators are compared across different county councils in the so-called “Open Comparisons” (Öppna Jämförelser). These league tables can compare both determinants of health as well as different health outcomes. They also contain, as mentioned above, information on quality, results and costs within several areas that municipalities, county councils and regions are responsible for, including public health, health care, social care, safety, compulsory and upper secondary school. Another example is the monitoring system related to the government’s strategy for alcohol, narcotic drugs, doping and tobacco, where some indicators are available at the regional or local level.\n\nThe open comparisons are published by the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and the Public Health Agency of Sweden. Since its inception in 2006, this benchmarking has motivated efforts to improve health care across the country – no one wants to be last. In 2009, a comparison was undertaken for indicators of population health and health determinants at the level of county councils. The latest national report was published in 2015 (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2015a) and also contained data on the local level of municipalities. Apart from health indicators (such as disease incidence), it also covered social and living conditions and lifestyle factors.\n\nA nine-year follow-up study on implementation of the national public health policy (Swedish National Institute of Public Health, 2013) found that many municipalities and county councils made use of the policy in their planning, but that clear targets and monitoring systems were needed.\n\nConclusion and outlook\n\nSweden has a long tradition of disease prevention and health promotion. Its health indicators compare well with most other European countries, both in terms of major risk factors, health outcomes and life expectancy, but also with regard to immunization coverage and infectious disease control. Overall, the health of the population is improving, but there are still important health divides and inequalities, such as socioeconomic, gender, age and geographical inequalities, partly due to the differences across county councils and municipalities.\n\nNational public health policies and strategies in Sweden highlight equality in health and the importance of many sectors for improving health. The focus is on policies that create societal conditions for good health. The national public health policy is cross-sectoral and covers several policy areas, such as education, gender equality, employment, ageing and family life. The implementation of public health policy is coordinated at the national level, but much of the responsibility for implementation lies with regions, county councils and municipalities. Health promotion and disease prevention are to a large degree integrated into the primary health care services provided by county councils. It is difficult to pinpoint costs relating specifically to public health services, and precise information on the public health workforce is also limited.\n\nThere is largely a political consensus about the importance of health promotion and disease prevention to improve population health, although there may be differences of opinions regarding where the emphasis of public health activities should be placed. National legislation and policies (e.g. taxation policies, policies on smoke-free environments, and the minimum age for purchasing tobacco) seem to have been successful in changing health behaviours and improving the health of the population. The prevalence of smoking, for example, has declined and this has contributed to reducing mortality from, for example, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Sweden is also an active participant in many international initiatives regarding the improvement of public health at European and global levels and this involvement is likely to result in new public health action at home."
