        "text": "The concentration of circulating autoantibodies was measured using a standard ELISA. Polystyrene microtitre plates (Nunc Immunoplate, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight with 100 µl of 0.5 µg/ml NC1 hexamers from type IV collagen in 6 M Gu-HCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. As a control for non-specific binding, 1 µg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) was coated with 6 M Gu-HCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, on a second plate. The plates were then washed 3 times with 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. 100 µl human sera, diluted 1/100 in PBS-BSA [1.5 mM KH2PO4, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 0.12 M NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.3] were added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and after washing another 1-hour incubation was carried out with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated swine antihuman IgG (Orion Diagnostica AB, Trosa, Sweden) diluted 1/500 in PBS-BSA or alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo., USA; 1 mg/ml) in substrate buffer (1 M diethanolamine, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 9.8), was used as substrate, and colour development was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. All assays were performed in duplicate, and when a standard error larger than 10% was found, the sample was reanalysed. The cut-off value was set as the mean value of the blood donors +3 standard deviations (OD: 0.185). If the reactivity to the NC1 domains was less than 0.05 absorbance units above the reactivity to BSA, the sample was regarded as non-specific. All samples with an OD below the cut-off value and all non-specific samples were excluded from further analysis. All OD readings are given as absorbance units above the mean value for the blood donors (OD: 0.135).\n\nRecombinant antigens were coated at a concentration of 0.25 µg/ml in the same coating buffer as described above. Dominant epitope-specific antibodies were calculated as the difference between the result in OD between experiments using the S2 protein with the epitope in the α1(IV) background and experiments using recombinant α1(IV) proteins. To assess the importance of other epitopes residing in the middle or the C-terminal part of α3(IV) NC1, experiments were performed using protein emanating from the 133 construct (see above).\n\nSera from 81 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study, and clinical data were retrieved from all of them. Two sera came from renal transplant recipients, and these cases were excluded from further evaluation. The median age of the remaining 79 patients at the time of diagnosis was 66 years, 68 years for the 41 men and 61 years for the 38 women. The age and sex distribution is shown in figure 1.\n\nThe majority of the patients did not exhibit pulmonary haemorrhage. A renopulmonary syndrome (‘Goodpasture’s syndrome’) was seen in only 17 (22%) of the 79 cases, and 1 patient (an 11-year-old girl) had isolated severe pulmonary haemorrhage without any evidence of renal disease. Women were as likely as men to have haemoptysis: 21% (8/38) versus 24% (10/41; n.s.). As shown in table 1, there was no statistical difference between patients with and without lung haemorrhage with respect to concentration, specificity and affinity of the anti-GBM autoantibodies.\n\nAt diagnosis, 36 patients were dialysis dependent. Results from serum creatinine concentration determination before the start of treatment were available for 74 of the 79 patients. The median creatinine concentration for the entire cohort was 790 µmol/l. Renal damage at diagnosis did not correlate with the amount or specificity of the autoantibodies (fig. 2a, b).\n\nFour patients exhibited clinical pictures normally not associated with anti-GBM antibodies. A 73-year-old woman had a hydralazine-associated lupus-like syndrome with a serum creatinine concentration of 176 µmol/l at presentation. Clinically she responded to hydralazine withdrawal; 6 months later, her serum creatinine concentration was unchanged. A 38-year-old man presented with microscopic haematuria, casts, skin lesions and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serological tests were compatible with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Two patients presented with diffuse symptoms and a vague suspicion of systemic vasculitis, but without evidence of lung or renal disease. These 4 patients, who could be considered as having false-positive tests, all had low or moderate titres of NC1 OD (0.08–0.61). All 4 also exhibited low specificity of their autoantibodies as measured by the Mab 17 inhibition assay (1–33%) and low affinity as measured by the NC1 inhibition test (all 4 > 5 µg).\n\nStandard therapy for anti-GBM disease in Sweden during the study period was prednisone (starting at about 1 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (starting at 2 mg/kg) and extracorporeal treatment to remove antibodies [28]. The techniques used for removal of antibodies (e.g. plasmapheresis or immuno-adsorption with protein A columns) and the intensity of such a treatment varied according to the response to treatment and local traditions. Standard therapy was initiated for 44 patients, while 16 others were prescribed other immunosuppressive regimes. The most common variation was the use of azathioprine instead of cyclophosphamide, especially early during the study period. The 4 ‘false-positive’ cases did not receive immunosuppressive therapy. Five more patients received only supportive care; 3 of these untreated patients were dead at follow-up while the other 2 were on dialysis treatment. For 1 patient, who died early in the course, treatment data could not be retrieved. The design of the study does not allow any meaningful comparison between different treatment modalities.\n\nTo ensure that the main findings in this study were not caused by differences in treatment, a subgroup analysis was made on a cohort consisting of 37 patients treated according to the standard regime and whose samples were drawn before the start of therapy. Also in this cohort, the patients who survived for at least 6 months (n = 26) were younger than patients who died within that period (n = 11): 56.4 versus 70.5 years (p = 0.01). No serological parameter correlated with patient survival. When 10 patients with a functioning native kidney at 6 months were compared to the 16 patients undergoing dialysis treatment, univariant analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test yielded p values <0.01 for: creatinine concentrations before start of treatment (median 923 versus 517 for uraemic and native-kidney groups), percentage of crescents in biopsy (100 vs. 49%), NC1 OD (2.072 vs. 1.301), Mab 17 inhibition test (71 vs. 52%) and the dominant epitope test (1.082 vs. 0.410). When proportions were compared using Fisher’s exact test, a significant difference was also seen for the presence of ANCA (4/16 vs. 7/10, p = 0.04).\n\nThe present study demonstrates the clinical usefulness of ELISA tests for circulating anti-GBM antibodies. Among samples from over 9,000 patients, the assay picked out a cohort of 81 which as a group had severe renal disease and a grave prognosis. Six months after the drawing of a sample with a positive anti-GBM test, 34% of the patients had died, 41% were on renal replacement therapy and only 25% were alive with a functioning kidney. Only 4 patients did not have life-threatening disease (requiring immunosuppression and/or dialysis) and can be considered to be false positive. However, by applying more refined analysis such as specificity or affinity tests, these samples were revealed to have autoantibodies with low toxic potential.\n\nThe survival data in the present series are poorer than in reported series based mainly or entirely on patients with the typical IF findings [29, 30, 31]. The reason for this discrepancy is probably selection bias. Old and severely ill patients who have the worst prognosis are less likely to have a biopsy diagnosis and are less likely to be referred to university hospitals. The effect of such a selection bias can also be seen in the present study: the survival rate rises to 87% when analysis is limited to patients below 65 years with a biopsy finding of linear deposits of IgG along the GBM. A similar picture was seen in a British report also based on serologically diagnosed cases [13, 32]. The group of patients treated at Hammersmith Hospital was younger and exhibited a more favourable outcome compared to those treated at other hospitals.\n\nDifferences in how the study cohorts were selected can probably explain many clinical differences between this and previously published investigations. In textbooks, the typical patient with anti-GBM disease is a young male with pulmonary haemorrhage. There are no findings in this study to substantiate this notion. Less than 25% of the patients had haemoptysis. The sex distribution was close to equal and the median age was 66 years. Actually there were only 2 young men with pulmonary haemorrhage in the entire cohort. The young age and large male preponderance in early series might have been influenced by the fact that some cohorts emanated from US military facilities [3, 4].\n\nAnother important finding in this study is the outcome for patients who were not dialysis dependent at diagnosis. In this setting, there is a fair chance of renal survival: in 14 of 24 patients surviving the first 6 months, the renal function was saved. All patients with saved renal function received immunosuppressive therapy in combination with extracorporeal removal of autoantibodies.\n\nLerner’s classic transfer experiments hinted that kidney-bound antibodies were more toxic than circulating antibodies [8]. However, no strict comparison was made, and the antibodies came from different patients. Peters et al. [33] have stated that ‘... of the patients not requiring dialysis at presentation it is those with higher titres that tend to show deterioration in renal function’. In accordance with the British study, we found in the present study that the specificity and concentration of the circulating anti-GBM antibodies seemed to be of importance for patients who were not dialysis dependent at diagnosis. This is compatible with the notion that the circulating autoantibodies actually participate in the pathogenic process and indirectly supports the notion that removal of the antibodies is beneficial for the patients. In clinical practice it is difficult to know when it is safe to halt extracorporeal removal therapy. Combining the Mab 17 test with NC1 ELISA or epitope-specific tests may prove useful in defining a level below which the antibodies have such low toxic potential that further removal is not necessary. Future studies are needed to define such a level.\n\nWe found a correlation between unfavourable renal prognosis and antibodies directed at a major epitope region in the N-terminal part of the NC1 domain earlier described by our group. This epitope region is almost identical to the epitope region designated EA described by Hudson’s group in Kansas City [34]. Recent data from their group describing the quaternary organization of the type IV collagen show that this EA epitope is sequestered by the interaction of an NC1 domain of a α5(IV) chain [35]. Other epitope regions have also been described [19, 34]. Most of those epitopes are present on our ‘loss of function’ NC1 recombinant polypeptide. Indeed, most patients also showed reactivity to this protein. Interestingly no correlation could be found between such antibodies and an unfavourable renal outcome.\n\nWe found no significant correlation between affinity of the anti-GBM antibodies and any of the clinical parameters. We have presented data from an inhibition assay based on denatured antigens to measure affinity. We also tested other methods based on undenatured antigens and chaotropic agents (results not shown), without obtaining results pointing in other directions. However, all in vitro methods for affinity have limitations in predicting the affinity in the kidney in vivo [36].\n\nThis study confirms earlier findings that ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies occur together at a much higher rate than could be expected by pure coincidence. The nature of this relationship remains unclear. One possible reason is that vasculitis caused by ANCA inflicts damage on basement membranes that predispose for anti-GBM antibody generation; alternatively, recruitment of leucocytes in anti-GBM disease may predispose to ANCA generation. A third possibility is that a common aetiological factor renders the immune system prone to autoantibody formation per se and that the specificity of autoantibodies is dependent on other factors (including genetic factors such as MHC). The results of this study do not give any clues as to which explanation to favour. The proportion of ANCA in our cohort is higher than previously reported [37]. The finding that older patients tend to be more prone to be double positive in conjunction with the high mean age in our series might explain the high level of association. It has been proposed that the presence of ANCA is a favourable prognostic factor in anti-GBM disease. This notion is supported by the present finding that all renal survivors with a creatinine level above 600 µmol/l at diagnosis were positive in ELISA for ANCA. The favourable effect of ANCA may be mediated by a correlation with a lower amount and a lower toxic potential of the anti-GBM antibodies in double-positive patients.\n\nWe have previously shown that the PiZ gene for α1-antitrypsin is a negative prognostic factor in PR3-ANCA-positive vasculitis [27]. We found 6 PiZ-positive patients in the present study. Statistically this is not different from the background population. The number is too small to draw any conclusions regarding possible effects on disease progression, but the finding that none of the patients had preserved renal function at follow-up makes it meaningful to continue to register this parameter.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that the serological diagnosis of anti-GBM disease using an ELISA based on purified NC1 fragments of type IV collagen defines a patient population with severe disease and a grim prognosis at the same time as it gives few false-positive results. Favourable prognosis was associated with low titre, diverse specificity of the autoantibodies together with early detection, absence of the PiZ gene and the presence of ANCA."
