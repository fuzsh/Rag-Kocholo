        "text": "2.1. Welfare paternalism and autonomy\n\nWe must look beyond the Swedish discourse on COVID-19 as a sign of libertarianism and explore a more complex nuanced view of Swedish individualism and welfare paternalism in Swedish Covid policy. The pandemic has forced societies to make difficult decisions to confront wicked problems with no clear solutions. Countries have had to choose between protecting civil rights (such as freedom of movement) and social rights (such as the right to health) (Nordensvärd, Sefton, and Godenhjelm Citation2023).\n\nWhen inequality and social divide increase, it is hard to determine how much responsibility a diverse population of citizens can take on. There is a growing awareness of socially vulnerable parts of the population who may differ from the majority (Hobbins and Enander Citation2015; Sparf Citation2014). At the same time, welfare retrenchment and reform have led to a strong focus on individualizing moral and civic obligations and participation (Beck Citation1992; Giddens Citation1991; Rose Citation1999). Scholars point out that citizens’ autonomy and individual responsibility in a crisis situation are not so straightforward. Official Swedish health information publications often contain contradictory messages. Citizens should both think for themselves and comply with the recommendations (Kjellström Citation2005). There is a forcefulness in the communication that some would define as enforced emancipation (van Berkel and Møller Citation2002, 53) where there are measures of supporting a kind of autonomy with an authoritarian language and method. It creates tension between forced autonomy, indirect paternalism, and the conflict between local and central government. This would suggest that the Swedish governance discourse is not as clear cut libertarian and collaborative as it appears.\n\nIn Sweden, crisis management has seen a strong trend of individualization and responsibilisation. However, this trend may be ambiguous. Hobbins (Citation2017) states, ‘The broad trends of individualization and changing patterns of societal organisation have led to increased public discussions in Sweden about citizens’ responsibilities’ (p. 1–2). No clear-cut rules exist for dividing responsibility and duties between individuals and the public sector during a crisis. Swedish government bill (Proposition) 2011/12:1 states that individuals have a duty to be prepared to manage their own situation and address any direct needs that may arise (p. 103). The Law on Protection Against Accidents (SFS Citation2003:778) stresses the prioritization of protecting life and property and of avoiding causing accidents. In a crisis, municipalities are responsible for ensuring the safety of their citizens through crisis preparedness, managing crises and contingencies, and providing support in case of serious events (SFS Citation2006:544). Hobbins (Citation2017, 2) continues: ‘[t]he guiding principles of responsibility, similarity and proximity settle that any event that disrupts the daily work should be managed by the organisations and roles that would normally be responsible. In parallel with the strengthened role of the municipalities, the Swedish crisis management system has become increasingly fragmented and dependent on cooperation with other local actors’. In times of crisis, the fragmentation of Swedish crisis management can lead to a blurring of lines between who is doing what and when (Ramsell and Wihlborg, Citation2012).\n\n2.3. Neo-liberal reforms and new public management in Sweden\n\nExtensive neoliberal reforms have changed the discourse around paternalism and empowered both citizens and local governments’ roles in governance. The re-engineering of the Swedish welfare state has been centered around processes of marketization, responsibilisation, and new governance arrangements focusing on market models. The spread of these neoliberal ideas in Sweden has been growing socially during the social democratic regime (Larsson, Letell, and Thörn Citation2012, 4), and they have become the dominant framing of Swedish social policy in general. For education policy, Björklund et al. (Citation2004, p. 11) consider that “The changes in governance of Swedish schools during the 1990s can be described by words such as ‘decentralisation’, ‘goal steering’, and ‘accountability.‘” This change of discourse toward neoliberalism has meant that individuals are increasingly seen as needing emancipation from the power of the state. ‘Individual freedom could only be achieved by liberation from various forms of state regulation, and through the market, in the form of individual choice’ (Thörn and Larsson Citation2012, 264). We can also see that there has been a drive toward decentralization of authority toward local government and, thereby, abandoning previous social democratic positions on uniform and central solutions to governance (Nordensvärd and Ketola Citation2019) and in crises management (Ramsell and Wihlborg Citation2012). The overall governance scheme for handling the pandemic falls close to a neoliberal governance model, where the central government wants to ‘steer rather than row’ (Denhardt and Denhardt, Citation2000).\n\nHigh institutional trust has been perceived as a key factor for institutions to rely on more subtle instruments, such as recommendations and nudges, to change behavior (Pierre Citation2020). Sweden has upheld a system featuring public agencies with significant autonomy for the last 200 years and a result of which is that ’[t]he liberal strategy emphasising personal responsibility was believed to be best suited for the Swedish culture and social behaviour.’ (Pierre Citation2020, 486). This indicates a discursive linkage between the autonomy of agencies and the autonomy of individuals, where nudges, information, and self-responsibilisation remain the cornerstones of the pandemic response for individuals.\n\nThis discursive pathway was very resilient when other countries actively chose another pathway, including the other Nordic countries. This means that responsibility is outsourced to citizens and local actors, and the tools become more educative and promoting, rather than coercive. Nudging is when you steer someone in a specific way while they still have the freedom of choice (Sunstein Citation2015, 417). We argue that this dimension adds a discursive break to some degree on the demand for communitarian paternalism in crisis management.\n\n4.2. Individual autonomy vis-à-vis welfare paternalism - adapting to COVID-19\n\nThe relationship between paternalism and the autonomous citizen is more fluid during the pandemic; it is impossible to not take some paternalistic measures and restrictions. The first COVID-19–related death was reported on the same day the Swedish government modified legislation to prohibit public gatherings and public events of more than 500 participants. The government stated the reason as ‘necessary to combat an epidemic’ (GD1). With large events arranged for the public canceled, it is evident that the underlying argument for the ordinance clearly aimed to restrict the behavior of citizens. Minister of Justice Morgan Johansson was quoted saying ‘[n]o Swedish government has ever used this possibility before’ (NA1), implying that the right given to government to amend the Ordinance Act was a unique and controversial intervention constraining the citizens’ daily life.\n\nThe Swedish government formed a policy that emphasized restraint and responsibility. It wanted to protect people’s health and keep the health care system functioning. This debate also included the need to reduce the burden on healthcare workers who were working tirelessly. The responsibility was shared among the citizens, showing what they can do, such as following a new etiquette. An op-ed stated that ‘polite distances, continued hand hygiene and Japanese bowing instead of shaking hands are other long-term measures.’ (ED16). Policy had formed a closure around the nudging state by informing and motivating people to act. Svenska Dagbladet urged people to take responsibility for stopping the spread of infection. It declared, ‘It is both the only and the greatest thing we can do’ (ED2). Similarly, an op-ed in Dagens Nyheter illustrated the long-standing debate by saying, ‘the main task of the Swedes is to sit still in the boat,’ (ED14), advocating for solidarity through reducing social contact.\n\nGovernment opted for a discourse that put the image of individual responsibility first. The Public Health Agency used its authority to issue ‘recommendations’ (GD2) to encourage workplaces, businesses, and individuals in COVID-19 hotspots to stay home or take necessary measures to reduce physical contact. This kept society open. The recommendations emphasized the activities that citizens should undertake. This included reducing capacity in workplaces and staying home and limiting contact with others. Those who were infected with the virus or displaying symptoms were instructed to stay home. These general recommendations were regionally implemented gradually throughout the first year.\n\nOne debate in the mainstream discourse was how far the government should regulate individual freedom without compromising basic freedom. Liberal perspectives argued for individual freedom and the right to self-determination. In Sweden, an unexpected debate arose about granting too much power to the state. Not only was this seen as a threat to Swedish citizenship rights, but also to democracy. When the restrictions limiting public gatherings to 500 people, and later 50 people, came into effect, liberal media started to raise voices against the locking down of society.\n\nProponents of keeping society open argued that closing down would infringe basic civil rights and hurt democratic values in the long run. One editorial in Dagens Nyheter, said: ‘We must be very vigilant, so that the growing powers of authority are always proportionate and appropriate,’ (ED10). PM Nilsson, in Dagens Industri, compared the Swedish model of virus containment with the Chinese strategy of hard lock down and zero-COVID. He argued for the opening up of Sweden and stressed, ‘We are using a Chinese infection control model that the regime in Beijing adopted after trying to hide the infection for several months’ (ED4).\n\nIn Dagens Nyheter, Staffan Lindberg, a democracy scholar, argued that efforts to contain the virus by well-meaning democratic governments risked restricting basic civil rights, which in the long term might turn countries into ‘new dictatorships.’ Lindberg pointed at a decline of democracy and how combating the coronavirus could work to infringe the rights of citizens across the world. There is also a strong position in the article against China’s position of adopting a authoritarian collectivist approach, with little regard to individual freedom (ED5).\n\nThis emphasis on citizens’ self-control is evident in the measures taken by government and the argument was that the Swedish Constitution did not give the government the power to lock society down. This meant that policy makers needed to balance openness and accessibility with the need to mitigate the virus spread. To further illustrate this discourse, the government put forward a bill that stated: ‘Anyone who knows or has reason to suspect that he or she is carrying an infectious disease is obliged to take the necessary measures to protect others from the risk of infection’ (GD3). Business owners were also required to ensure safe distances in their shops, restaurants, and other venues. The government commented ‘that infection control measures should primarily be taken at the initiative of the person who runs or is responsible for a business’ (GD3, 25).\n\nThe Social Democratic Party echoed calls for moderation, reactivity, and subsidiarity, rather than proactivity. Prime Minister Stefan Löfven wrote in a debate article that, until the end of the pandemic, ‘we need to continue to do the right things, take responsibility for ourselves but also for each other and our society’ (ED9). Typical of this response was the call for decentralization of responsibility to the lowest level possible, trusting that citizens and public authorities did their bit.\n\n4.3. Individual autonomy vis-à-vis welfare paternalism – No COVID\n\nIn the media, the debate around Sweden’s governance during crises gained prominence during the pandemic. COVID-19 put a strain on the governance system, exposing system deficiencies and challenging assumptions. Points scrutinized were, in particular, the decentralized system of governance, an ineptness of government to respond accordingly, and a critique against the Public Health Agency. The Christian Democrats, in opposition to the government, challenged the party truce on how government handled the virus. Their leader, Ebba Busch, demanded increased cultural awareness and a need for ‘plain speaking about the corona virus’ (ED8). She highlighted the government’s failure to meet the needs of migrants, particularly the Swedish-Somali community living in Stockholm suburbs, who had been heavily affected by the virus. Furthermore, they were eager to criticize the governmental strategy. Ebba Busch considered the government as dysfunctional, and stated, ‘government had recklessly allowed a large spread of infection in Sweden’ (NA2). The Christian Democrats advocated for nationalizing regionally-run health care, opining that the Social Democratic Party had let elderly care down. Ebba Busch said that the country’s 290 municipalities had been left without national support. She believed that a visitor ban, and support for protective equipment should have been introduced much earlier, and considered that the current system of 21 regions meant that, ‘you cannot take responsibility for the whole of the country’ (NA2). The opposition was often advocating for a more central governed paternalism with less space for individuals and local actors/government to act upon the virus according to their own assessment.\n\nSimilarly, we see that media accounts focused mainly on healthcare, and the same arguments also applied to nursing homes, as the elderly population was among the hardest hit. To illustrate: ‘In the next crisis it must be clear that the government is able to take the lead for the whole country. It is unreasonable for each region and municipality to come up with their own solutions to crises that affect the country – especially when one affects the rest.’ (ED11). At some point the critical rhetoric was not just questioning if autonomy of citizens was viable in a crisis but there was a larger discussion if the whole idea of autonomy of local agencies and decision makers needed to be hauled back.\n\nIn the media, demands were made to close ski resorts, calling for more governmental-articulated restrictions, and that it ‘should have closed down the ski resorts and put a stop to pleasure trips’ very quickly to safeguard local inhabitants from visitors coming from urban epicenters (ED6). Shortly before Christmas 2020, calls were made in the media for a furthering of the measures taken to impede the virus spread (ED14). This showed a mixed message: government should impose restrictions to limit Christmas shopping and citizens should remain calm and keep their distance. At the same time, some accounts in the media appealed to the need for stronger measures to get society through the crisis. As stated by the Swedish media personality Cissi Wallin in Expressen: ‘In this situation, Löfven and Tegnell need to embrace their slightly dictatorial sides and ignore the confused citizens until the vaccine is here. Because we obviously cannot handle this responsibility ourselves’ (ED13).\n\nThe perceived lack of response from the government became a heated point of discussion. Svenska Dagbladet (ED2) highlighted that: ‘Over the past ten months, the management of the pandemic has shown an appalling executive deficit in the state,’ pointing toward the desire for more central governance. This was echoed in debates from 2020 to 2021, particularly in relation to the high mortality rates among the elderly. Commentators argued that the government must clarify responsibility and stop ‘the blame game.’ As further discussed in Svenska Dagbladet, ‘The inability to protect the elderly was a function of the inability to protect society as a whole’ (ED15). There are counterpoints echoing the discussion by the Christian Democrats that government should remodel governance in its entirety. Media accounts discussed unifying the 21 regions that provide health care services in Sweden. These arguments can be traced to both Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter, whose op-eds became concerned with a need for a more centralized and uniform response to COVID-19. Centralised paternalism has been a particular re-occurring theme in media. The media discourse were divided between protecting as much individual autonomy as possible on one side and of reinforcing a strong central paternalism that should curtail individual and local autonomy on the other side.\n\nCritics called for a stronger government response, using the hierarchical state apparatus. Others criticized the liberal policies that sought to keep society open. They argued that Sweden should follow the example of countries such as China, which prioritize ‘zero-COVID’ strategies. The underlying arguments for this consider a need to protect an overstretched health care system from collapsing, or to protect vulnerable individuals from infectious peers, or that the virus needed to be stopped by any means.\n\nMarch 2020 provoked the most numerous and vocal accounts to shut down society. The calls were few – yet strong. One key example stems from the liberal media outlet Dagens Nyheter, advocating for ‘isolating ourselves from each other during a time, for the virus spread to lessen’ (ED1). In the media, these accounts were otherwise primarily made by doctors specializing in virology or infectious diseases. To illustrate, Staffan Sylvan, an infection control doctor, argued that the hierarchical state should introduce a lockdown and use all available measures against COVID-19 to limit the contagion to the Stockholm region (ED3).\n\nA group of doctors and senior academics, called ‘the group of 22’, fiercely criticized approaches to keep society open. They were a group of leading academics who broke rank with the Swedish policy to argue for stricter measures and restrictions and argued for a Sweden more aligned with the rest of Europe. During 2020, the group published 87 letters to editors or debate articles in various outlets, including a commentary piece in The Lancet. Their view echoed a call to contain the virus. To illustrate, the group stated that, ‘[C]OVID-19 is a disease that we can master. But then, those responsible cannot fully rely on strategies based on “personal responsibility” and “voluntary measures”’ (ED12). This view was mirrored in other accounts made by representatives of the group. As an example, members of the group proposed four steps involving the closing of schools, and mandatory fever monitoring in public spaces (ED7). Two professors – both members of the group – called for lockdowns as a measure for ‘flattening the curve’ during the most infectious periods. One proposed a partial lockdown in Stockholm to be necessary (NA3), while the other called for total closure of pubs and restaurants to ensure ‘[.] that no people should be able to meet in public spaces. Hence a shutdown.’ (NA5).\n\nVocal critique against the Swedish strategy turned to other forums, such as closed groups on Facebook. Perhaps the most pronounced example is MEWAS (Media Watchdogs of Sweden), a group of around 200 members (NA10). By arguing against prominent figures who advocated for liberal measures, MEWAS wanted to convince researchers and the media that Sweden had taken the wrong path. To illustrate the repercussions of this debate, a researcher who spoke in favor of keeping schools open had to abandon his research due to threats (NA9).\n\nThe only political response to locking society down, for a period of two to three weeks, came from the liberal Centre Party in 2021. The leader of which, Annie Lööf, critiqued the responses from the government for being slow and unresponsive. Until mass vaccination schemes picked up speed, she argued that, ‘To prevent it (the pandemic) from developing into a tsunami, tough measures must be taken’ (NA11).\n\n4.4. Reducing mortality through No covid vis-a-vis balancing restrictions with different health needs and individual autonomy through adapting to COVID\n\nOne of the poignant reflections we can make on the two different frames is how they differ in what they want to achieve and what their overall goal is. We can therefore see that the two discourses presented in this paper did not always depict the complex and ambiguous reality. During the height of the pandemic, the No Covid frame was largely driven by reaction to the ever-growing statistics on each nation’s infection rates versus mortality rate – these statistics were often flawed, differed from country to country, and, in hindsight, Sweden did not stand out as strongly as was presumed during the actual pandemic. Still, these statistics drove the No Covid frame that demanded welfare paternalism to be implemented centrally to cap infection rates and, therefore, cap mortality rate. Restrictions were often portrayed as the urgent need to save lives, while accusing the opposing discourse of sacrificing life for the economy and egoistic individualism:\n\nIn a couple of weeks, Sweden could be like Italy. It (the virus, authors note) is progressing horrifyingly fast now. Waiting and seeing definitely does not protect us (ED1)\n\nWe must keep in mind that the opposing side was arguing for more balanced restrictions, with different social costs in mind. The government was arguing for a balanced middle position because a hard lockdown would lead to psychological ill-health, or that harsh restrictions would cause greater societal inequality and negative health impacts in the long term. This frame was thrown into a discussion around the societal determinants of health during the pandemic, and the autonomy of individuals coincided with a broader concern for health among different social groups and considerations for greater social inequality and health impacts in the long term. These streams of thought are evident in the bill leading to the pandemic law (GD3), the purpose of which was to enable measures that are effective and safe in preventing the virus spread, while also not hindering activities that could be carried out safely from a public health perspective. The government contends that ‘it must be taken into account that the limitations themselves can have a negative impact on public health.’ (GD3, p. 15)\n\nWe can see that the binary media debate between ‘No Covid’ and ‘Adapting to Covid’ forgets that there was a lot more complexity in the Swedish discourse. The frame of adapting to Covid, which was driven by the Social Democratic Party, was motivated partly by protecting the autonomy of individuals. This framing also takes into account the larger social implications, such as the prevention of economic costs that would have a disproportionate effect on working-class Swedes, the role of women in the labor market, and the balance of child care for working families. PM Stefan Löven wrote:\n\nThe crisis has been a brutal reminder that one is not strong alone, that people depend on each other. In difficult times, Sweden and its citizens show their best side. We see many good examples of this throughout our country. Across Sweden, men and women in healthcare and social care are working tirelessly. Throughout Sweden, welfare workers in particular ensure that the country keeps going despite everything (ED9)"
