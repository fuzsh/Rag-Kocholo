        "text": "Over-education\n\nThe central variable is over-education. Since the focus in this study is on jobs and the theoretical point of departure is taken from the job search model, I have used a measure of over-education that refers to the type of job of the over-educated. The reason herby is to not capture individual wage differences that occur within most types of jobs. It is common that individuals doing the same type of job have different incomes as a result of variations in different sectors, individual characteristics, etc. If individual wages had been central such variations would have been captured. This is why individuals, based on their wages, have been categorised into different groups that distinguish themselves by performing different types of jobs. All individuals in this study are highly educated but performing jobs that do not demand their level of educational skills. Thus, without doubt all individuals are for sure overeducated. When these overeducated individuals experience mobility they move from unskilled jobs to jobs that require more skills, regardless of their individual wages. Examples of such jobs and how the categorizations were made are explained below.\n\nWorkers were treated as over-educated if they had accomplished a tertiary education but had jobs in the lowest job wage group. As soon as they left the job in the lowest job wage group for jobs in any of the higher job wage groups, they were considered to have experienced upward mobility.\n\nThe cut-off point of the lowest job wage group were all jobs that employed approximately 20 per cent of the employees who had jobs related to the lowest wages (ranged according to their median wages). In contrast, the highest job wage group contained about 20 per cent of employees who had jobs related to the highest median wages. In more detail, the job wage groups were estimated according to the following: with the data pooled from 2003 to 2012, all wages were recalculated to constant value. The median wage was then calculated for each of the occupational groups according to the Swedish Standard Classification of Occupations (SSYK 96, three-digit level) and the occupational groups were then ranked according to its median wage. In the next step, each occupational group was filled with employees. The number of employees in the occupation with the lowest median wage was summed to employees in the occupation with the next lowest wage and so on. This cumulative scale made it possible to divide the employees into five rather equal groups (job wage groups 1–5) ranging from the 20 per cent of the employees in jobs related to the lowest median wages (the lowest job wage group) to the 20 per cent of the employees in jobs related to the highest median wages (the highest job wage group). This measure was created by Åberg and has been used in various ways in his studies (see, for instance, Åberg Citation2013, Citation2015).\n\nTertiary graduates can have jobs related to relatively low median wages (for example, some teachers, or some occupations in the healthcare sector), while at the same time many unskilled workers have jobs related to relatively high median wages (for example, in the construction sector). In such circumstances, the lower and higher educated can overlap in, for instance, the third wage group, where both groups are correctly matched from the perspective of their job. To ensure that I capture only the poorly matched, it is safe to restrict the study to tertiary graduates with jobs in the lowest job wage group. In the lowest job wage group, people were employed in jobs within the restaurant trade, service, cleaners, healthcare, maids, window cleaners, etc. Thus, tertiary graduates in jobs in the lowest job wage group were actually extremely over-educated.\n\nPredictors of over-education\n\nAn individual’s human capital is usually measured through their level of education, but in this study it refers to field of study, as well as study activities after tertiary graduation. Field of study is detailed according to the two-digit level by SCB (SUN2000Inr) and amounts to 24 different fields (see in the results). Study activities after tertiary graduation refer to cases when tertiary graduates continue with further education after graduation. If individuals were registered in such studies, the year after graduation, they are ‘still in studies’. It could be any area of education but in reality, these were almost exclusively education at university level.\n\nProportion of tertiary graduates in low-wage jobs within each field of education, 2003–2012. Divided by ‘students’ and ‘non-students’.\n\nApart from the human capital variables, some are also used in order to measure the impact of personal characteristics for the probability of having a low-wage job. According to the Job concurrence model, potential employers screen the job queue beyond the meritocratic ideals when many in the queue hold the same formal merits. In this study, sex, age, region of birth and parents’ human capital are controlled for. In other studies, all of these have been found to predict over-education or have had implications for upward mobility. The first personal attribute relates to sex (man, woman). Young female jobseekers may especially signal lower productivity for some employers, due to expected family formation reasons. Such expectations can restrict females to low-paid jobs, regardless of their level of education. Statistics also shows a general overrepresentation of female workers in part-time jobs (SCB Citation2014a) and part-time jobs are often offered in the low-wage sector. Age has been recoded into a number of dummy variables (−27, 28–31, 32– years) when predicting over-education. In the second section, age is continuous because the Cox regressions allow continuous variables. The regions of birth are Sweden, the Nordic countries together with EU15 and North America. In general, individuals from these countries were most likely to be in Sweden for work, something they had found upon arrival. This group is not expected to be in low-wage jobs to any greater extent than Swedes. The other groups are Europe (other than EU15), Asia, Africa and South America (together with Oceania, Soviet and unknown). People from these regions are more likely to have immigrated to Sweden for other reasons than job opportunities, to a larger extent than the Nordic/EU15 group. They are also expected to have a more troublesome period in the process of labour market establishment, due to, for instance, labour market discrimination. Finally, the parental level of education is divided into lower secondary, upper secondary, post-secondary <2 years, post-secondary 2 years or more, and unknown. The parental level of education is usually intended to predict children’s level of education, but studies have shown that parental education can also predict over-education. This study focuses on individuals who accomplished the highest possible level of education, but it is relevant to find out whether parental education can have any impact on the risk over-education and mobility behaviour. Descriptives of all the variables used in the regressios are presented in .\n\nOver-education\n\nWhy are young tertiary graduates increasingly represented in jobs with very low wages? In 2003, the proportion of graduates who had low-paid jobs was around 11 per cent, and in 2012 this figure had increased to about 14 per cent (). On review of the data, it becomes clear that some occupations were particularly prevalent among tertiary graduates in low-wage jobs. Around 55 per cent were found to work in restaurants as waiters/waitresses and bartenders. Another 15 per cent worked in customer service roles (salespersons and receptionists), and 10 per cent worked in the cleaning sector. This was the case in both 2003 and 2012.\n\nThe distribution in shows that along with the increase in the total number of tertiary graduates, and at times relatively high unemployment levels, the number of tertiary graduates in low-wage jobs also increased between 2003 and 2012. The proportion of graduates in low-wage jobs varied most of all with the proportion of tertiary graduates in general (correlation 0.86), rather than fluctuations in unemployment rates (correlations 0.53 respective 0.50). This correlation is better described in , which illustrates how the overall increase in tertiary graduates also increased their representation in low-wage jobs.\n\nSomething derived from data (but not shown here) is that as many as about 50 per cent of new graduates in low-wage jobs were registered in education, almost exclusively at university level. The considerable number of graduates still in education may answer the question why tertiary graduates had low-wage jobs. However, even if education activities can explain to a large extent why over-education among graduates is so common, these do not explain the increase in the proportion of graduates in low-wage jobs (as shown in ). This is being said because the actual increase was mainly based on graduates who were in full-time work (non-students), while the number of graduates still in education remained relatively stable over time ().\n\nPrevious research has identified how different types of tertiary education (general or specific) can have impact on over-education (Verhaest and Van der Velden Citation2013) and the aim of this study is to complement earlier findings insofar that it investigates in more detail how different fields of education impact the likelihood of over-education. illustrates the relative representation of graduates in low-wage jobs within each field of education (two-digit level) and it becomes clear how the proportion of graduates in low-wage jobs varies between these. A number of fields associated with a larger risk crystallise. It is especially prevalent among graduates from arts and media (21 per cent), humanities (26 per cent), social and behavioural sciences (19 per cent), law (25 per cent), healthcare (23 per cent), social work (26 per cent), personal services (20 per cent), security (21 per cent) and not least within unknown (40 per cent). All these fields were significantly above the average grand mean (13 per cent). One could imagine that the pass rate of students from these fields was particularly high during this period, which would explain the higher risk of over-education. However, using statistics from SCB (Citation2014b) there is no clear relationship. There certainly was an extraordinarily high increase in graduates from humanities and social/behavioural sciences, as well as law studies (the increase was around 50–60 per cent between 2003 and 2012), but statistics also show much smaller increases, or even decreases, in graduates from other fields, when compared with the ‘low-risk fields’. We can also derive from that the large number of graduates still in education was proportionally similarly dispersed within each area of the field.\n\nIn sum, both field of education and study activity seems to explain over-education among tertiary graduates. However, higher education activities do not explain the increase in over-educated graduates. Neither can the general pass rate of graduates, nor study activities, explain mechanisms behind the clear association between the field of education and low-wage jobs. In the next section, I will examine the likelihood of over-education related both to the human capital variables outlined above and to personal attributes. To include personal attributes enables us to study how different groups in the labour market signal productivity, but this may also show if ‘fields at risk’ (as discussed above) are explained by personal attributes connected to the specific fields.\n\nAttention is first paid to field of education (, empirical deviation). As we already know, graduates from ‘fields of lower risk’ were less likely to have a low-wage job, when compared to graduates from ‘fields of higher risk’ (especially graduates from humanities, law and social work, and unknown). The main argument for including field of education in the MCA () is to determine if the effects remain after controlling for study activities and personal attributes. On the whole this seems to be the case, even if the effects decrease somewhat (pronounced for law studies), when we compare the multivariate effects (adjusted deviation) with the bivariate effects (empirical deviation). This indicates that none of the personal attributes included in the model were largely related to the fields of education.\n\nTurning to graduates still in education, the analysis displays a difference of more than 20 percentages between those still in education, and not in education (, empirical deviation). These effects remain even after controlling for field of education and personal attributes.\n\nFollowing the research of Rubb (Citation2014) and Verhaest, Schatterman, and Van Trieer (Citation2015), but in contrast to Swedish studies (Universitetskanslerämbetet Citation2013; Grannas and Oscarsson Citation2001), female graduates in this study were slightly more likely to have low-paid jobs than men, but the over-representation was rather small. The small effect indicates that female workers do not seem to signal much lower productivity than men in the Swedish labour market (, adjusted deviation).\n\nThe youngest age group was much more likely to be over-educated, when compared to older graduates, and this result is in line with earlier international studies (Groot and Maassen van Den Brink Citation1996; Rubb Citation2003). This is an expected outcome, since employment possibilities based on human capital not only refer to tertiary graduation but also to previously acquired skills, which at least statistically should grow with age.\n\nWhen it comes to country of birth the result indicates, like many previous studies (Verhaest, Schatterman, and Van Trieer Citation2015; Rubb Citation2014; Böhlmark Citation2003; Battu and Sloane Citation2002; Grannas and Oscarsson Citation2001), that the likelihood of having a low-wage job largely varied with region of birth. People from Africa were much more likely to have a low-wage job than any other group. Reasons for the over-representation in low-wage jobs among people born overseas have been expressed in terms of either lack of social networks or pure labour market discrimination (Aldén and Hammarstedt Citation2014). Thus, ethnic minorities seem to signal low productivity, and this is stated in relation to their overall higher risk of over-education in their jobs, when compared to Swedes and other Nordics.\n\nFinally, unlike previous research (Verhaest and Omey Citation2010), the model does not indicate a relationship between social background and over-education. The insignificant effect may derive from the selection of only tertiary graduates. It is likely that social origin is more important for the prediction of level of education, or even when predicting over-education among lower educated.\n\nThe detection of human capital variables and personal attributes as predictors of over-education raises the question if these are important also for the likelihood of leaving the status of over-education and finding better matched work? This will be discussed in the following section.\n\nMobility behaviour of the over-educated\n\nIn this section, I will focus on upward mobility among the over-educated. The selection group consists of everybody up to 35 years of age who graduated from tertiary education in 2003, and held a low-wage job in 2004. After these selections, 19,379 individuals remained. They were then followed from 2005 to the end of the study in 2012.\n\nYearly transfers (per cent) from job wage group 1 to job wage group 2, 3 or 4–5.\n\nOverall, 83 per cent left the lowest job wage group at some point between 2005 and 2012, while 17 per cent remained in the lowest job wage group, at least until 2012. Among those who transferred from job wage group 1, around 60 per cent reached the two highest job wage groups (four or five). Fifteen per cent transferred to the second job wage group and 25 per cent to the third job wage group. illustrates the year when these transfers took place. The most common was to transfer to other job wage groups during the first or second year (2005 or 2006), while very few transferred to other job wage groups after 4 years (2008). Transfers that occurred after 4 years were primarily to the two highest job wage groups. However, it is not clear if workers who first transferred to the second or the third job wage group later on used these posts as a stepping stone into work that matched their educational attainment in the fourth or fifth job wage group.\n\nIn order to study whether variations in individual attributes have impact for upward mobility among the over-educated in 2004, I have used a Cox regression. This model identifies the extent to which the over-educated moved from the lowest job wage group to any other group during the study period 2005–2012. More precisely, the estimates represent the yearly average odds ratio of leaving the lowest job wage group. Data represent the entire population, and therefore the standard errors related to their B-coefficient are displayed instead of significance levels.\n\nThe regression in shows that the odds ratio among graduated from ‘fields at risk’ was 20 per cent lower than for graduates from other fields. If we recall the results from the previous section, this means that first the field of education increased the risk of over-education, and then also decreased the chances of upward mobility. Turning to the variable ‘still in education’ the regression shows a positive effect. The yearly odds ratio is 22 per cent larger for students who transfer from low-wage jobs when compared to non-students. Therefore, as one can expect, study activities first increased the likelihood of over-education but in the long run this turned out to be positive for upward mobility. The job competition model suggests that when many jobseekers possess the same formal competence in the hiring process, potential employers look for attributes signalling productivity beyond formal qualifications. Study activities can be one such attribute. The hesitation was whether additional education would signal capacity or labour market establishment problems, because it is uncertain why they resumed education. Further education can complement previously attained studies, something that possibly signals greater capacity. However, if one chose further education rather than open unemployment, it can signal establishment problems. Here, it seems that further education signalled productivity, since the mobility chances were higher for this group.\n\nIndividual attributes had impact for mobility chances, but these were much less predictive than the human capital variables (). The likelihood of women being able to transfer from a low-wage job was slightly greater than for men (although women were more likely to be over-educated in the first place). This finding contradicts many previous studies where females were shown to be less likely to be able to be upwardly mobile (Rubb Citation2014; Verhaest, Schatterman, and Van Trieer Citation2015). The probability of over-education was largest for the youngest, but as shown in the regression (), younger age groups were positively correlated with upward mobility. For instance, for a 30-year old the odds ratio was annually around 50 per cent lowerFootnote2 than for a 20-year old. In agreement with previous research, some ethnic minorities were much more likely to be over-educated, and particular ethnic minorities were also much less likely than others to experience upward mobility. Finally, the parental level of education showed no impact for the likelihood of over-education, nor did it for the mobility behaviour of the over-educated.\n\nOver-education and upward mobility\n\nAccording to the Job competition model (Thurow Citation1976), highly educated without jobs usually look for jobs single steps down in the job queue. However, this study shows how increasing numbers of graduates between 2003 and 2012 took big leaps all the way down in the job queue to the unskilled jobs. In this context, it is important to note that the over-educated in this study were extremely over-educated. Nevertheless, there were also over-educated people in job wage groups two and three, but they were not the subject under consideration here.\n\nOne of the aims of this research has been to locate explanatory factors for over-education among graduates, and the initial assumptions were that such features should be sought for in the supply side of the labour market. The result shows that the general increase in graduates correlated very well with the increase in over-educated graduates. Furthermore, this also shows that many graduates in low-wage jobs were students, something that explains over-education to a certain extent. However, even if it explains over-education it does not explain the increasing number of graduates in low-wage jobs. Finally, the results also indicate that graduates from some specific fields of education were particularly exposed to over-education, but with the data used in this study it was not possible to identify the mechanisms behind this.\n\nTo have low-wage jobs on a temporary basis while studying, or as a first job in ones working career, can appear uncomplicated. However, according to both previous research and the results in this study, over-education can be persistent over long periods of time. One reason for such persistence can derive from the characteristics of most low-wage jobs, where employers usually have few incentives to invest in the employees, and there are usually no opportunities for career progression. In this study, around 60 per cent of the over-educated transferred to completely different jobs that better matched their human capital. The rest, around 40 per cent either stayed in jobs related to the lowest wages in the labour market, or transferred to jobs in adjacent job wage groups, where many were still over-educated. The chance of upward mobility varied with the field of education, but also with after graduation. Graduates still in education had significantly better chances of upward mobility, and, as a result it seems that postgraduate education actually signals productivity, and that human capital investments besides the job itself can have positive effects for the chances for upward mobility."
