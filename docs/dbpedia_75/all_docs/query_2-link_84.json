        "text": "(Finished )\n\nA Swedish Tiger\n\nProlog\n\nHi!\n\nI’m glad you decided to check in my first AAR attempt. I hope you will find it interesting to read, and give you some inspiration for your own game. The reason I do this is actually fun mixed with an important test I got in middle October. You see, in Sweden we have like a big test that determents if you get in to collage or not. This test is made out of three individual parts, Math, Swedish Languish and English Languish. Since it’s mostly reading a text and answer questions about the text it’s really hard to train in advance for this kind of test, but this is one part of my English part preparation. This also mean that I would really appreciate if you point out any grammar or spelling errors, or anything wrong with the way I use English at all.\n\nI do also want to tell you, that even that I love history and have read extremely much in my 20 years long (short?) life, I’m not even close to the knowledge you guys have. I will try to keep things as close to alternative history as possible, but I may have some fundamental things wrong. Please tell me those in a civilized matter, since I really tried hard with this one, and don’t want to get flamed because it’s not realistic.\n\nSo that’s a little back-story, now I hope you will enjoy the AAR\n\nIntroduction\n\n25/9-09\n\nIt’s a cold, dark and windy Friday night in Stockholm. The wind takes up every little garbage it can find and throws it several meters again, until the trash finds some rest again for some seconds. The nurse, standing outside Karolinska hospital, has big problem lighting his cigarette. After several try’s it work. He’s very chilled, and tosses the cigarette away after just some few drag and hurries inside the small back entrance. He walks slowly towards his next patience, a Mr Oscar Hammar. He looks at the clock hanging from the roof in the long corridor as he continues to jog along towards rum number 1712. 8.19pm. just 40 minutes and our nurse are free to leave his, according to him, boring job.\n\nHe enters the rum and heaves a deep sigh. He can’t understand how it’s possible to put so much recourse on a man that’s soon to be 108 years old. He takes the man’s journal and start to read. “Born second October 1901 in Västerås” “The patient has suffered from three heavy strokes, the first fifth July 1999, the second 11 august 2005 and the last one, which put the patient to coma, 1 January 2009.” “Why can’t them just let him die” the young nurse thought will he was preparing the syringe with old Oscars medicine. The continues bip sound from the EKG machine gets to our tired nurses head. He makes a big yawn at the same time he put the syringe in the old man’s worn-out body. Just as he thought he was finished the EKG machine makes short pause in its even interval. The nurse’s pulse answer to this sound and the adrenalin starts to rush in his body. He presses the alarm button at the same time the machine starts to sing a long, continuing tone. In less than 40 seconds its al sudden an enormous activity in old Oscars room. But what no one of the stressed people around Oscar knows, is that inside this old man’s wrinkled skin it’s all peace and quiet. The man, who no scientist in the world would argue that he’s brain-dead, now’s it’s his time to go now. He has over lived all of his friends, his wife and even two of his five children. He is ready to take the step in to the eternal rest. But before he let go, he decide to walk thru his own life, inside of his head, a last time…\n\nOcar Hammar’s career\n\nThe young years\n\nThe oldest memory I find is a fragile one. A warm summer day with an easy breeze. I can’t be older than five, and I’m standing on a rock, next to my father fishing. I can’t remember anything else than the feeling of that moment, the peace and lone time I had with my father. It was quite rare to be alone with him during my growth, since I had six siblings. Maybe that’s the reason of this very early memory. I can’t remember anything really at all except this moment from my early life.\n\nI remember elementary school. I was a bright kid, no questions about that, but my manner wasn’t really as developed. Today, I can remember it with a smile. My teachers really had a tough time with me, with all my pranks going on. I had a happy youth thou, and got good grades, despite my manners. I was in a loving family of nine people, so I was never bored. I remember the day I was going from Västerås to Stockholm to study expert in political science at Stockholm collage as a very sad day. I was only eighteen, and even thou it’s not more than just over 100km between Västerås and Stockholm I felt so lonely. I was used to have the whole family around me at all the times, and now, suddenly, I was alone in the huge city of Stockholm. I had been in Götebrog when I was ten, but this was even bigger!\n\nI loved my studies and really tried my best. It was during this period of time I joined the “Frisinnade landsföreningen”, the only true liberal choice in Sweden during this time. I remembered in 1923, when the party was divided as a direct cause of the prohibition of alcohol question. It had been an election in 1922 about this question, and the side that was against a prohibition won with 2 %. I was on the winning side, as a young and radical liberalist. I did advance quite fast in this time period in the party, and in 1931 I was a member in the Swedish parliament. I had, during this time, drifted toward our defense politic, since I thought it was a lot needed to be done there. I remember the Election Day in September 1932 as a dark day. My party, now called Folkpartiet, didn’t have enough votes for a single seat in the parliament. Little did I know that it was during this election period, I would see my fastest career advance.\n\nThe Cabinet\n\nWaking the people\n\nI had been against the disbarment ever since it begun. I remembered thinking, “As long as there is a country out there that won’t let their people make the decision’s it will be war, and Sweden most be able to defend itself.” In 1934 our military forces was a joke, outdated, few and untrained. I wrote hundreds of proposals to the parliament, but it didn’t have any effect. Of course, I used my liberty in a free country and begun to write letter to the editor in the more conservative Swedish papers. And this actually begun to have effect. In February 1935 I got half a page two times a week in the second biggest newspaper in Sweden, to write my point of view of the defense. I remember this time as an exciting period, where I actually was making a difference. It was in this newspaper this image was shown for the first time, later used for the Folkpartiet campaign for the election;\n\n(Away with evry tendency to dictatorship, vote with Folkpariet)\n\nIt was because of my writings I was approached in the end of 1935 by Ernst Wigforss, the Swedish armament minister. He let me know that the parliament would vote for a new law in the coming weeks, where it would be decided whatever or not Sweden would put together an armament cabinet, a cabinet that had direct response for the armed forces, and full control over Swedish armament industry. I remembered his word exactly, “If this law, god willing, passes, then both I and the Swedish people have you to thank. Only time can show us how big that thank will become, but as the world looks today I believe you just saved Swedish liberty.”\n\nThat day was one of the proudest of my life.\n\nThe planning\n\nThe law passed 18 of October 1935 with 227 votes for yes against 112 against. It was probably the big opinion of the people, and the election getting closer, that got Socialdemokratera, the by far biggest party, to vote yes for this. I remembered the day in early December 1935, when we all met for the first time. Nobody really knew what our task was, and how many we would be in this cabinet before this day, and it was really a big surprise for us al. We were a small group of nine persons. Axel Gyllenstjärna was the main contact with parliament, and hi was responsible to make sure the cabinet didn’t took bigger decisions than it was supposed to, we had the chief of army, navy and air force, Oscar Nygren, Charles de Champ and Torsten Friis, the foreign minister Richard Sandler, me and two other consults, and of cores, the leader, Ernst Wigforss.\n\nIt was this day we all became very clear just what huge responsibility and trust we had been given. We few were supposed to run Swedish military, foreign and internal politics. I was very scared this day, since I realized that my advice could have severe effect on the whole country. It’s one thing to be blaming everyone to do wrong and be after wise in a newspaper, and one completely other thing to actually make those decisions yourself. The group was to gather again the second of January, after the Christmas holiday and make the first, vital decision for the Swedish future.\n\nThe work starts\n\nJanuary 1936\n\nThe cabinet was once more gathered. In front of us we had a huge map of hole Sweden. Ernst opened the meeting. “God morning gentlemen. As you all know, Sweden is in a terrible position today. We have a world that’s getting more and more aggressive and obsolete equipment for our military and inefficient laws. To be honest, today the biggest problem of defending democracy is democracy itself. We must make sure to always keep the opinion of the people in a good shape, and let them have faith in us. At the same time we can no longer continue this disarmament…”\n\nHe continued rabbling on and I sat silenced and looked at the map.\n\n“…so for an efficient reorganization of the army we most first of all look at the threats to our country. What’s your point of view about this, Oscar Hammar”\n\nMy pulse hit the roof at once. But I was prepared.\n\n“My point of view about this matter differs from many others. Of course, I very much agree that the absolute most dangerous threat at this moment is the Russians or soviets if you want. I do think that a preparation of defense in north of Sweden along the finish coast, as well as the cost around Stockholm is our highest concern. But, I’m afraid the threat doesn’t stop there. As a democracy we cannot, under any circumstances, trust the relationship, in long term, of any dictatorship at all. This means, gentlemen’s that I do see a reason in preparing for a Defense against Germany as well…”\n\nThe discussion continued, but I did gain some success, and it was decided that Germany should be consider when reorganize the forces. The chief of Army finally let us know about his thoughts of the reorganization. “I’ve studied this greatly, and I think we are on the right path. But what our divisions, today organized into three infantry brigades each, need is striking power. I would like to see an artillery brigade in each division. This would seriously better or chances in putting up resistance against a larger foe.”\n\nAl the nine men got his chance to express their viewpoint, and finally there was a report ready for the parliament.\n\nThe report to the parliament\n\n2nd January 1936\n\nSweden is today not able to fend off any foe greater than our neighbor countries. Today’s organization is most ineffective and would only hamper our tries in a defense. We are also dangerously far behind in research in every possible field. The preparation comity has also decided that Sweden needs to develop her air defense capability. Since the founding towards the air force is too low to order more interceptors, this should be compensating by researching anti aircraft weapons. This is also good in an international point of view, since this defense only weapons doesn’t seems threatful for our neighbors.\n\nThe preparation cabinet suggests the following.\n\n1. Longer the terms for military education to improve the efficiently of our troops.\n\n2. Invest in better education system to improve our competition against the bigger countries\n\n3. Make an order of 1 Infantry brigade to reinforce Gotlandstrupperna, and 7 artillery brigades for better combat efficiently\n\n4. Try to have evenly divided diplomatic contact with Soviet Union, German Empire and United Kingdom to assure neutrality.\n\n5. Prioritize research investment in front of all other foreign investments, and this should be prioritized towards industrial research to compensate our weak industrial base. As mentioned, we should also try to develop AA weaponry\n\nWhen the new brigades are delivered the preparation cabinet will be able to reorganize the army in to better defending positions.\n\nThe Answer\n\nThe parliament approved al our request at once, and we all felt quite surprised. We had requested more than we were hoping for. Maybe there was a threat to Sweden that even the parliament was afraid of. This did get us nine to realize that we was very free in doing what we thought was best for the country.\n\nDuring 1936 we all waited for the brigades to complete, to start the true reorganization of our forces.\n\n3rd of November\n\nThis autumn day was the last brigade finally delivered. Now it was time to deploy our forces after our main strategy, where I had made sure we, at least symbolic, would spare troops for our southern front. Three scenarios were considered.\n\n1. USSR declared war against Finland and Sweden. In this case our navy is to reinforce the Finnish navy and try to keep the USSR navy away from the finish bay. Our forces would then advanced to the east of Finland, and try to create a line of defense in the Finnish woods, were the UUSR would have much harder to supply its troops, far in enemy land, then we.\n\n2. USSR declares war on Finland and Finland surrender. If this happens we have to be ready to have an elastic defense in the north. We have much land of little value, which means we can slowly retreat al the way to center Sweden. The bad infrastructure in the non costal provinces makes it possible for our forces in the inland to raid the soviet supply lines\n\n3. If Germany attacks Sweden, we most hold them of at Malmö, or else we risk to lose or industrial base very quickly. This should be done by digging in, and if possible, help from our navy.\n\nTo prepare for all this three, it was decided to have I infantry division in Malmö, II in southern Sweden, III in Stockholm, IV in Jämtland for supply raiding, V and VI in the border to Finland for quick response and VII infantry division in Kiruna, also for supply raiding.\n\nBlack is option number one, green number two and red number three.\n\nIt was decided to crate two corps of this force, one northern and one southern. I – III division was in the southern corps and IV – VII division was in the north corps. Both corps stood under direct control of the commander of al forces in Stockholm.\n\n1937\n\nAfter the huge defence investment made during 1936 the public opinion didn’t let us invest in any troops. We wouldn’t want to do that anyway, since we don’t want a foreign army to be able to see us as threatening. Therefore, we decided to continue our armament by buying anti aircraft guns from Bofors. The public opinion would not be a problem, since it created a lot of work for a Swedish company.\n\nIn the summer of 1937, with Spanish civil war still going on, and many countries getting involved we decided that it was probably time to shift research from industrial to make our equipment newer. We were far behind in this, and with Spanish civil war making the world even more unstable, we decided to do it fast.\n\n1938\n\nAfter the investment in anti air it was decided to deploy them in our southern industrial base, with Stockholm as priority. The meeting in January 1938 saw the heavyset debate so far, since the world was getting a dangerous place, and Sweden was still hopeless behind. The Chief of Air force wanted to build fighters and interceptors, pointing out what a crucial role bombers had in Spain, while the chief of the navy wanted to put two new battle cruisers in the construction queue, since, he argued, that was the only way to stop a German assaults. The chief of army, on the other hand, said that we needed to double or fighting force on the ground, and develop specialized mountain divisions, to have even the slightest chance to stop a soviet onslaught. I felt that I needed to brake the argue. “I Know it does feels like we don’t stand a chance against the nations our scenario tells us to defend against. But we need to prioritize. The red bear is still our biggest foe, and to battle him we all know its land forces we need, and lots of them! Even so we can’t assume that Hitler won’t knack on our southern door. My suggestion is that we use this year to build up our land forces. According to me, we need three new infantry divisions, one in Göteborg, one in Karlskrona and one in Luleå. We have to guard our ports, since they would be overrunned by an amphibious assault very quickly as it is today. I do also think we need to research the equipment necessary to train the mountain troops Oscar Nygren is talking about. I would actually see 6 brigades in three divisions of them, with more artillery support. That would be one whole corp, but I think it’s needed. But I’m not sure if the aircraft guns can hold off a prepared assaults on the southern part of our country, so we need to get an own interceptor model out for production. This can’t be made this year, but we should be prepared to start interceptor production from 1939. I’m sorry to say, that there is no room for improvements in the navy today”\n\nTo the chief of the Navy’s despair, my suggestion went thru to the parliament, that approved it at once.\n\nSummer 1938\n\nAfter the annexation of Austria, and Czechoslovakia as next target for Hitler, the preparation cabinet assembled again. “It looks like we now have to highly dangerous countries close to us, not only our enemy for generations in the east, but also a wakening power in the south. Something has to be done” Ernst Wigforss started the meeting. But with our industries as occupied as they are its hard to put out any more troops. After a three day long meeting, we decided to build one more infantry division, but this time a standing one. The plan was to let it be mobilized at all times in Malmö. We all hoped that would be enough\n\nAutumn 1938\n\nA meeting took place, as I remembered it, during a warm autumn day. It was a meeting with lots of hard words. We were falling behind in schedule, and wouldn’t be ready with our new infantry divisions before New Year. This meant that the mounting corps would be postponed, and the new interceptors would have to wait until late 1939 as best. I heard Torsten Friis, the chief of the Air force, mumble “Let’s all hope we don’t have a war upon us before end of 1941”. In a way, I really agreed with him. That air force needed to be built.\n\n1939\n\nSince the production had fallen behind schedule, the only thing we were taking decisions about in the early 1939 meeting was research. There we decided that the best thing was to make a pause in the equipment raise, and look on doctrines. “Since we haven’t been in a war for 150 years, maybe our way of fighting is a bit old” as one of the other consults expressed the way. We also decided to develop our artillery\n\nSummer\n\n6 month behind schedule, the mobilized division was finally delivered and put in Malmö. The order for three divisions compared of two mountain and one artillery brigade was put directly. The Swedish industry is heavily limited under the pressured under the supply demand of her big army.\n\nWar!\n\nThe night between 28 and 29th September we were assembled in panic. Germany had attacked Poland, and the UK and France declared war at once. Finland and Denmark was mobilizing and decisions were needed to be taken fast. Discussions were long, but at dawn everyone was pretty sure that we had made a good decision in letting our forces be immobilized, since we didn’t want to draw any attention to use, since we were still way to unprepared to get in a conflict. Our main goal in this war most be to stay neutral, but stay on high alert, and be ready to act for our peoples best interests.\n\nThe day after reports comes in from Finland, indicating a massive buildup on their border towards the Russians. We all prayed a short moment, for god to let Sweden keep this conflict outside of her borders.\n\nTwo days later, a decision from parliament was taken, that, even still at peace, Sweden would adapt to war. This mean that the war cabinet and preparation cabinet was to move out in a bunker in the northern part of Sweden and lead every force direct from this place, without going thru the parliament.\n\nWe decided to reorganize at once, and a couple of weeks later, we had made big differences in the army.\n\nOne standing division and one reserve division in Malmö, together with III division in Växsjö was the organized in Southern corps, south Sweden’s main fighting force. In Karlskrona, Göteborg and Stockholm was organized in a Southern garrison’s corps, mainly for defending against attacks from the sea.\n\nIn the north, there was one corps of all five divisions. One was in Luleå to defend from sea attack,2 divisions to guard the border against Finland, one in Kiruna and one in Östersund for raiding supply lines.\n\nLife in the bunker\n\nPoland fell in just three weeks, and the industrial giant to our south looked even more threatful. We were all hoping, day in ends, that Sweden would stay neutral. All our decisions had this as goal. At the same time, we wanted to get our three specialized divisions on the ground, since these divisions probably would tip the balance if the conflict came to us. Even so, we all felt the conflict dragging closer, and the southern flank was the most dangerous one. It was a tense time in the bunker. I remembered having trouble to sleep in the moist air inside. It was terrible, but only the beginning.\n\nOctober the 15th a request came from Germany. It was written in fine words, but the meaning was impossible to miss. They wanted to use or railway to transport troops to an upcoming attack in Norway. After reading it loud Ernst Wigforss teard the paper to pieces. “We won’t sell our country!” he screamed, “Not to these fascist basted, not to any one!” That was actually the only time I’ve ever seen his mood brake.\n\nDeclaration of war\n\nI remembered it as it was yesterday. After our denial to Germany they had sent us an official declaration of war. The conflict was over us. We all sat quite around our table, with an enormous activity around us. Radio traffic going in al direction, but in all this ciaos, we fund the inner strength to grasp the leader roll. “Let’s get this show started” Ernst said.\n\nFull war laws was passed later that afternoon.\n\nThe Swedish people were mobilizing. The country was at war once again.\n\nAs the war broke up in the south, the northern corps was rushing thru the country towards the southern part. The only force left was Luleå garrison. We knew we had to stop the Germans in Malmö, and to do that we needed to gather our forces…\n\nThe first weeks\n\nAs our forces rushes to the south, and thousand and thousand of people were getting to their units Germany's air plane was pounding our ports to pieces. Not without losses thou, since the ships there were putting up a resistance. The first shoots of the war had been fired.\n\nNovember\n\nA declaration of war on the Low Countries gave us mixed feelings. We knew that we would have some time to prepare, but the fast advance of the Germans was frightening, what if France would fail to stop them. I remembered thinking “Let the time go fast, since I rather am occupied than living in this uncertainly”\n\nDecember\n\nFirst of December the word of despair reached us. The Germans had declared war on Denmark. Our preparation time was over, since we all knew Denmark would fall in days, if nor hours. We made orders for our troops to take position to defend Malmö. The war was soon to come in our country.\n\nThe Danish people fought harder than we thought, which actually gave us some hope. The battle rage for almost a month before the Germans reached Copenhagen. The Port strikes had almost annihilated the whole Swedish fleet, and erased every possibility for the navy to make any offensive maneuvers. This was not a moral booster for any of us, but we were all ready to fight for the soil of our free country!\n\nDenmark occupied, Sweden next?\n\nThe forth of January Copenhagen fell for the superior German onslaught. It was time for our small air force, of one tactical wing and one naval bomber wing, to take off and start bombing German communication on the Danish side. It was all part of defending Malmö\n\nThe Sixth January Visby fell to a naval assault. Nothing could we have done to stop that. Lucky enough, Gotland was completely evacuated, and its inhabits was living in camps around Norrköping.\n\nThe day after, we heard reports of the Soviets attacking Finland. We did decide to keep our forces in the south, since the response time to stop the Soviet, if they would declare war on us to, would be much longer.\n\nFinland\n\nThe north part of Finland was falling quickly, but the southern part made a strong stand. I really wished we could help our brother people, but we had our own door to watch…\n\nFrance front line was pushed back even more during these weeks. No one said it, but everyone was thinking of the scenario if France fell, and the huge troops that would be free for the Germans. What would that mean to Sweden?\n\nBattle of Malmö\n\nJanuary the 14th. The battle begun. Hundreds of landing crafts were closing in on a miles broad front. The machine guns and grenades were banging everywhere along the cost. Without the extra artillery we would have been in trouble, but for now, it seems like the situation is under control\n\n6 days later, the battle was still raging when the Germans brought up reinforcement. They were starting to overrun us, and we ordered IV division to reinforce the city. This battle could determinate the future of our nations.\n\n8 days later, the battle still raged. Decision was made to put one more division in the fight, since the Germans had a small foothold south of Malmö. For the first time, we really feared we would lose the city.\n\nEven nine days later, the attack was still strong, and the Germans were dragging in huge amount of forces into the battle. We were starting to understand that this battle would be a long and bloody one. We decided to let the XI division retreat to reorganize, and send in backup from Treleborg instead.\n\nWe were losing the battle. We had to stop this change of events! The German air force was cutting us in pieces. It didn’t go one hour in the bunker without the chief of air force swearing about the armament priority. “Where are my interceptors!?” he screamed. We continued to roll out the unorganized divisions to put in fresh ones. Many brave Swedish young men were dying every minute.\n\nThis period was terrible for whole Sweden. The days of battle became weeks, and weeks became months. Every one of us new, that if Malmö fell, we would be in big trouble. We tried to rush our industry, even by shorten the recruit time for pilots, to get our interceptor out as fast as possible, since the German close air support was our main concern. The weeks rolled on, and we couldn’t get the Germans away from their small bridgehead, just outside Malmö, but they couldn’t land enough forces to make a breakthrough either. It was becoming a battle of will.\n\nAt the same time Germany became stuck in France. We helped each other quite well, or at least Swedish people wanted to think we helped the Frenchman, since we tied up at least 10 divisions, and many of them panzers, from the west front. But what would happen If France felt? How long could we stand alone in an axis Europe? Only time could tell…\n\nFall of France\n\nThe 4th of July one more devastating blow was delivered to us. France had fallen to the German onslaught. No one could guess what this meant for Sweden, but we continued to block the German advanced. In just 4 more weeks our first fighters would be ready for action and only god knows if that’s fast enough. The Germans had already rolled up more men in Copenhagen to make a decisive blow. Even if it’s not as decisive as the Germans had hoped for, they have advanced 3 km inland, and now control a considerable bridgehead. The battle hangs in the balance, and so do the fate of whole Sweden.\n\n10 of august\n\nEven thou our ground forces had some success during July, our so long waited fighters got intercepted on their first mission. The Germans had assembled most of their fighters from France to our front and outnumbered us so much our planes were forced to land and take shelter in the bunkers at the runway in Göteborg. Was our hope to stop the German bombing in vain?\n\nWinter 1940-1941\n\nThe battle continued with both us and the Germans driving in new reinforcement on a weekly basis. The casualties were enormous. During this period of time our main concern was to find manpower to fill the gaps. We knew we couldn’t push in as many troops as the Germans, nor reinforcements. And, how much was this battle worth? Every Swedish boy in the age of 17-25? No, this had to stop. If it weren’t for the soviets, which were massing on the German border, we would be forced to surrender at once, but considering the hostile situation between the two titans, we decided to force our self to withstand a few more months.\n\nThe class of the titans\n\nAnd so, on the 25th of March 1941, Soviet Union declared war on Germany. No one knew where this conflict were heading, but that was at least good news for now. The time was running out, and we couldn’t hold Malmö for much longer…\n\n1th of May 1941\n\nThe pre summer of 1941 was terrible. We all knew that Sweden, as a nation would fall. Not because of bad planning, not because of bad equipment, not because of lack of bravery. No. We would lose because of lack of reinforcement. What could we do? We had thrown in every single young man in Sweden to face the German onslaught, but the Germans was so many more. We thought that the declaration of war on Germany by the Soviets would help us, but their advancement was to slow. Way to slow. But we had decided. We would fight for our free country. I remembered crying a lot during this time. Al I believed in, such as freedom and individualism would be destroyed. I had lost three of my brothers already, and one more was missing in combat. I almost wished I could join the fight myself. But I knew I would be more useful in the bunker. I remembered a meeting we had during this time period, when we actually had realized that our cause was lost. Ernst Wigforss rose up, talked with his deep and dark voice, without trying to hide that he was crying “Come on men. Let’s show those bloody Germans that this Tiger still has a bait, that we won’t go down yet, that we won’t surrender even after a two years long battle. Make sure you put every effort to let our Swedish people live in freedom, even if it’s just for a week. That’s worth thousands of lives.”\n\n1th of June 1941\n\nMay was a turbulent month. Even if we had our hopes at the bottom during the beginning of the month, it was much better during the latter half. Poland had been liberated by Soviets forces by 10th of May, and that was enough for the Germans to draw their Air forces towards Berlin to help stop the Soviets assault. Due to this, we didn’t have to face bombers anymore. That was a relive! And the Germans draw some of their forces back, but we still faced some of their elite panzer units.\n\n1th of July 1941\n\nDuring June, not much really happened. We continued our stubborn resistance, even if almost all our brigades were short of manpower. The Russians did a slow advanced during the huge front. The only thing we could hope for was them reaching Denmark before we lost the battle. The situation was desperate, but not as desperate as in may, and not as hopeful as in June. Al we could do was to cross our fingers.\n\n31th of July 1941\n\nWe all assembled in the bunker. Today was the day. July had been a terrific month, not just because the Soviets kept advancing, but also because the Brits had open up one more front in north of France. But nothing was ever so good as this day, 31th of July that would probably be Sweden’s Independence Day after this year. Today the German forces withdrew al of their attacking forces, and therefore leaving us as victories after 2.5 years of battle. For three months ago, we were all sure about losing this battle. Now we had won it. But the day was also a very sad on, giving a thought of al the young, brave, Swedish men and women giving their lives for our freedom. Over 70.000 heroic Swedish soldiers had given their lives in this battle. Even if the German forces casualties was more than twice as high, no one cheered, because this battle had been the bloodiest in all time.\n\nAttacking back\n\nEven if the British attack was forced back together with the soviet assault the German had lost her Baltic front. She had withdrawn almost every troop she had from Denmark, and that was an opportunity we couldn’t miss. We were to push to Copenhagen and try to liberate our brother country.\n\nSeptember 1941\n\nAfter trying to push too far, we decided to make a stand Fadberg, behind the strait, to stop the German counter attack.\n\nThe 6th of September we officially liberated Denmark from its occupation. That was a real moral boost in whole Sweden. Now we had an ally in our Baltic front. Would it be enough thou?\n\n1 of January 1942\n\nEven if the German had made some small attempts to cross the straight, they had only met our brave soldiers at the other side. The Germans casualties was ten time ours, with forced them to let us be. For now. The eastern front had stabilized. Our main concern now was to conscript more troops to fill our gaps, and produce more fighters to defend Danish air space.\n\n1 of January 1943\n\nOne more years of a burning world war has passed. The Germans has left our Baltic flank alone, except bombing raids. But against those our newly formed air force has been able to defend against. Now, after a year, we are finally ready for expand our armament forces. We have decided that our main goal has to be to free Gotland, and those civilians still there. We will try an amphibious assault with our mountain corps. But first, we will strengthen all three divisions to 3xmoutin and 1x artillery each. We also most expand our transport force to been able to transport them all at once.\n\nAugust 1943\n\nAfter the build up during first half of 1943 we were now ready to try to recapture Gotland, the only Swedish core space that had been occupied. Our plan was simple, land the mountain corps on the southern part from Gotland, try to push the Germans back from Visby at once, since the only port big enough to bring in supplies was in Visby.\n\nOnce the battle had commenced we planned to shore bombard Visby with the reminds of our navy, and pound the enemy with the air force we had. We also planned to let the new transport fleet steam towards Stockholm, quickly load the garrison there and throw them in the battle too. With three mountain divisions and one infantry, we should be able to destroy the Germans before our supplies ran to low.\n\nRed arrow = Main assault, Blue arrow = naval and air support Green arrow = Reinforcements from Stockholm. They should arrive in a couple of days after the battle has started.\n\n5th of august\n\nOur forced landed safely on the beach, but just three hours later the German forces on Gotland counter attacked. Our troops were trying to hold the beachhead, while reinforcements were rushing from Stockholm. In worst case, we decided to bring the garrison in Karlskrona to join the fight.\n\n10th of August\n\n5 days later we the German attack stopped. We had been forced to take the Karlskrona garrison to, so time was crucial. If the German counter attacked in Karlskrona our back would crack. We prepared for the offensive immediately.\n\nAfter just one day the German forces, unorganized after their assault, surrendered, and our victories troops advanced on Visby, liberating the few civilians left, and let the ones that had escaped to the mainland return. This was a glorious day!"
