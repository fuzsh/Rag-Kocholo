She received her doctorate degree in Leadership Studies from Indiana University of Pennsylvania and has been recognized by The Rotary Foundation and numerous community and international organizations.\n\nRead the president’s full biography\n\nRead the president’s monthly message\n\nMário César Martins de Camargo\n\nPresident-elect 2024-25\n\nRotary Club de Santo André\n\nSão Paulo, Brazil\n\nMário César Martins de Camargo is a business consultant to the printing industry and former director of Gráfica Bandeirantes, a printing company founded by his father. Under de Camargo’s leadership, the company expanded to be a supplier of printed material for clients in Brazil and elsewhere in South America.\n\nDe Camargo attended military school and graduated from a secondary school in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, during a Rotary Youth Exchange program. He had a yearlong internship at MAN Roland, a printing press manufacturer in Offenbach, Germany, before he earned his undergraduate degree at the Fundación Getulio Vargas’ São Paulo School of Business Administration. He also received his law degree from the Faculty of Law of São Bernardo do Campo.\n\nHe has led numerous professional associations, including as president of the Brazilian Association of Graphic Technology and ABIGRAF, the Brazilian Printing Industry Association. He was also delegate director of the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) in the National Confederation of Industry, vice president of FIESP, and vice president of the Latin American Confederation of the Printing Industry. He received the Printing Leader of the Americas award from the Printing Association of Florida and the Global Presidential Print Award from NPES, the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing, and Converting Technologies.\n\nDe Camargo joined Rotary in 1980 at age 23. A past director and trustee, he will be the fourth RI president from Brazil. He has volunteered for numerous roles including RI learning facilitator, zone coordinator for the Avoidable Blindness Task Force, Latin American coordinator for the Health Concerns Task Force, RI president’s representative, and Council on Legislation representative. He has also served on committees including the RI Membership Growth Committee, The Rotary Foundation Programs Finance Committee, and the International PolioPlus Committee.\n\nDe Camargo says he is continually impressed by Rotary’s global reach. “With Service Above Self, Rotary has created a unique global identity that is unlike any other I know,” he says. “I think we all need to remember that we belong to an organization that opens up the world to us.”\n\nDuring the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, de Camargo took on two projects: studying for (and passing) the bar exam — 38 years after attending law school — and learning Italian. He also enjoys reading history and biography books and appreciating good wine.\n\nDe Camargo has received The Rotary Foundation’s Distinguished Service Award. He and his wife, Denise, are Major Donors and Benefactors of The Rotary Foundation.\n\nRead the president-elect’s full biography\n\nHans-Hermann Kasten\n\nVice President 2024-25\n\nRotary Club of Aachen-Frankenburg\n\nGermany\n\nHans-Hermann Kasten is a lawyer and businessman. After earning his law degree and a Ph.D. from the University of Münster, he pursued a career in sales and marketing, working for three major insurance companies, Allianz, Provincial, and Generali Holding Germany. He also served on their boards of directors. He later left insurance to work as a lawyer for eight years before retiring in 2021 to dedicate more time to Rotary. He has served as a member of his local city council and chair of its school committee.\n\nKasten joined Rotary in 2003. He has focused on youth projects throughout his membership. With his club, he has supported literacy for young children and worked on projects that teach German language, beekeeping, and swimming to young immigrants and refugees in Germany. Supporting Rotaract is very important for him. As district governor in 2016-17, he was already stressing diversity and inclusion with his motto “Rotary is becoming younger, more female, more colorful, and more cheerful.” He focused on increasing membership in his district and chartered four new clubs with different club models.\n\nIn 2023, Kasten joined the RI Board of Directors. He has also served RI as learning facilitator and twice as representative to the Council on Legislation, coordinating the training and proposals of German-speaking districts in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. He authored the 2022 proposal to allow Rotaractors to attend Rotary club meetings, which was adopted. “Rotary and Rotaract should learn much more about each other,” he says.\n\nKasten and his partner, Nadja Picard, are multiple Paul Harris Fellows and Major Donors. He has received the Avenues of Service Award.\n\nRhonda \"Beth\" Stubbs\n\nTreasurer 2024-25\n\nRotary Club of Maryville\n\nTennessee, USA\n\nRhonda “Beth” Stubbs is a certified public accountant who earned her degree at Plymouth State College. After working as a CPA at a Maryville firm, she set up her private practice in 1994, focusing on consulting with small-business owners on account management, finances, and exit strategies. She also worked as chief financial officer for her husband’s business, Trinity Benefit Advisors, for 14 years. Stubbs is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Tennessee Society of Public Accountants.\n\nStubbs, who first started frequenting Rotary club meetings at age 8 with her father, joined the Rotary Club of Maryville in 1991. She has served her district in several capacities, including as chair of its finance, Foundation, and leadership development and education committees. Stubbs has attended 22 Rotary International Conventions, traveled to New York City for Rotary Day at the United Nations, served in a National Immunization Day in India, traveled to Mexico for club partnership projects, and attended various zone meetings around the country. Stubbs has served on the Administration Committee, the Council on Legislation Advisory Committee, and the Joint Audit Committee.\n\nDuring a zone meeting in New Orleans that she attended with a Rotary friend — before either had yet served as club president — she learned about Ambassadorial Scholarships and Group Study Exchange. Inspired, she and her friend worked together to help set up these activities in her district. “We saw there was a whole world to Rotary, and we wanted to bring it to Maryville,” Stubbs says.\n\nIn addition to bagging and delivering food for schoolchildren with her “small but mighty” Maryville club, Stubbs has worked with her district to raise $1.3 million for polio eradication through the sale of “purple pinkie” donuts and other fundraisers. The satellite club she helped start in her district is still going strong. “I look forward to applying my skills as a CFO on the Board, and to working with clubs in my zones to build the knowledge base about Rotary and its possibilities,” she says.\n\nStubbs has served on the boards of local nonprofits, including the Michael Dunn Center, which serves people with developmental disabilities, and Asbury Place, a regional retirement community organization. She also served in officer positions in Toastmasters International and is active on several committees at her church. In her spare time, she enjoys reading, traveling, and attending football and basketball games at the University of Tennessee.\n\nShe and her husband, Tony, support The Rotary Foundation as Arch Klumph Society members.\n\nGhim Bok Chew\n\nDirector 2023-25\n\nRotary Club of Bugis Junction\n\nSingapore\n\nBorn in Singapore, Ghim Bok “G.B.” Chew graduated in 1981 with an honors degree in computer science from the University of Liverpool, England, before returning to his home country to launch a career as a serial entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and private equities fund manager. After opening his first business, an IT systems integrator, he took a bankrupt food processing company to an initial public offering after turning it around. Now semiretired, Chew maintains real estate and real estate management companies in Singapore, in addition to his fund management holding company.\n\nChew joined Rotary in 1996. Immediately after serving as district governor in 2013, he took on several zone and international roles, including assistant regional Rotary Foundation coordinator, assistant Rotary public image coordinator, Rotary coordinator, and chair of the zone institute committee. He is the Host Organization Committee chair for the Rotary International Convention in Singapore in 2024.\n\nOutside of Rotary, Chew is active as a local volunteer, having served for nearly three decades with Singapore’s People's Association, a government organization that uses a grassroots approach to promote racial and social harmony among Singapore’s diverse population. Chew created synergy between People’s Association youth groups and Rotary when he helped start community-based Interact and Rotaract clubs that are still active today. For his contributions to Singapore’s communities, Chew was awarded the Public Service Award Medal in 2005 and Public Service Star Medal in 2012 by Singapore’s president. He also serves as a justice of the peace who volunteers in local prisons, chair of two religious organizations, trustee of three national trust organizations, and honorary consul for the Republic of Slovakia in Singapore.\n\nChew, who decided to join the Bugis Junction club after reading about the global polio eradication effort in a local newspaper, advocates for the power of partnering to accomplish great things. “As a business person, I strongly believe in creating synergy and leveraging partnerships,” he says. “One plus one can be more than two — it can be 11.”\n\nChew has applied this approach by partnering with Rotary clubs and outside organizations to support cleft palate surgeries in Indonesia and prosthetic limb fittings in Malaysia. In another project coordinated by his club, he helped raise funds for doctors in Indonesia who donate their time to provide cataract surgeries, implanting lenses for only about $50 each. “Imagine an older person who has never seen their grandchildren suddenly seeing them for the first time,” says Chew. “These are some of the life-changing experiences I have been able to witness through Rotary.”\n\nChew is a recipient of the Service Above Self Award. With his wife, Phyllis, he is a member of the Arch Klumph Society Chair’s Circle.\n\nEve Conway-Ghazi\n\nDirector 2023-25\n\nRotary Club of Redbridge\n\nEngland\n\nEve Conway-Ghazi is a multimedia journalist. After earning her bachelor’s degree in English from Queen Mary University of London, she worked as a newspaper reporter. Her editor, a Rotarian, was pleased when she received a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship to the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she earned a master’s degree in broadcast journalism. She returned to London to launch a career in TV and radio journalism that included 20 years at BBC News as a reporter and producer.\n\nConway-Ghazi was invited to join Rotary in 2000, after doing a series of speaking engagements at London-area clubs. In 2012, she became the first female district governor for Rotary in London. She organized numerous Rotary activities in connection with the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, including a Rotary reception for the Jamaican Paralympians, all polio survivors. That year, she also worked with her counterpart in Mumbai to start a successful vocational training team project focused on preventing problems during childbirth in a community in rural Jawhar, India.\n\nConway-Ghazi served as president of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland in 2016-17. That year, she launched and led the Purple4Polio campaign, engaging Rotarians across Britain and Ireland about polio eradication, one of her passions. The successful campaign had 80 percent of RIBI clubs participating, which yielded a 19 percent increase in giving for polio eradication over the previous year. In addition, it helped raise public awareness, with more than 900 media reports about the campaign. Conway-Ghazi has been a vice chair of the End Polio Now: Countdown to History campaign committee and previously served as director of the Rotary Action Group for Endangered Species.\n\nShe has traveled numerous times with British Rotarians to take part in National Immunization Days in India and has worked with leading journalists from the BBC and The Independent covering the topic. She produced a documentary for the BBC on fighting breast cancer in Pakistan, as well as more than 30 videos that RIBI used for a membership and marketing campaign. “Rotary helped me develop my skills as a journalist and it has been good to give back what Rotary’s given me,” says Conway-Ghazi. “We have to tell the story that what Rotary is all about is projects with impact that save lives.”\n\nOne of her proudest accomplishments was starting the Rotary Young Citizen Awards in association with BBC News in 2007, focusing on helping to promote positive stories about young people. Outside of Rotary, Conway-Ghazi chairs The Media Circle, part of The Circle nongovernmental organization founded by singer-songwriter and activist Annie Lennox to empower women and girls globally.\n\nShe met her late husband, Robert Ghazi, through Rotary. They support The Rotary Foundation as Major Donors and members of the Bequest Society.\n\nPatrick Eakes\n\nDirector 2024-26\n\nRotary Club of Crescent (Greensboro)\n\nNorth Carolina, USA\n\nPatrick Eakes, a professional engineer, is the owner of C.P. Eakes Co., a custom metal fabricator he formed in 1996 that supplies metalwork in construction and manufacturing. He is a graduate of North Carolina State University, having earned both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering.\n\nEakes joined Rotary in 1998, on Rotary’s anniversary. He says he was initially drawn to Rotary for the service opportunities and stayed in part because of Rotary’s impact on him and his family. He has served Rotary as International Assembly learning facilitator, Rotary coordinator, assistant regional Rotary Foundation coordinator, leadership seminar chair, innovative club advocate, and vice chair of the Carolinas’ Presidents-elect Training Seminar.\n\nEakes has also led membership development and success initiatives with the Membership Action Plan Committee for Zones 33 and 34, which hosts monthly peer-to-peer webinars and has developed web tools that use real-time data and predictive analysis to assist clubs in setting goals and gauging overall club health.\n\nOne of Eakes’ favorite roles was assistant governor, when he first experienced the power of Rotary beyond his club. “I saw Rotary in all its forms and made incredible friendships outside my club,” Eakes says. “To this day — and it’s been 20 years — if I walk into any of those clubs, I am greeted as if I were a member there.”\n\nEakes is proud of his club’s strong Rotary Foundation support. With his leadership, at one time, each of its 125 members was a Benefactor, a Sustaining Member, and a Paul Harris Fellow.\n\nEakes and his wife, Kristen, support Children of Vietnam, a local organization that provides education, nutritious meals, clean water, and medical support for thousands of children in Vietnam.\n\nEakes enjoys golf and served for two years as president of Sedgefield Country Club, where he helped move a PGA Tour event back to the course. His other hobbies include travel and appreciating wine.\n\nEakes has received RI’s Service Above Self Award and belongs to the Membership Society. He has also earned The Rotary Foundation’s Distinguished Service Award and Citation for Meritorious Service. He and Kristen are Major Donors and members of the Bequest Society and Paul Harris Society.\n\nChristine Etienne\n\nDirector 2024-26\n\nRotary Club of Petoskey\n\nMichigan, USA\n\nChris Etienne is an associate broker with Harbor Sotheby’s International Realty and director of leasing for the Village at Bay Harbor. With her husband, Dennis Lindeman, she also owns a retail business, Linde Furniture.\n\nEtienne graduated from the University of Maryland after studying at its campus in Heidelberg, Germany, and earned her master’s degree in business administration from Lake Superior State University. She worked in the banking industry for 15 years before transitioning into real estate.\n\nA recipient of the Realtor of the Year Award from the Emmet Association of Realtors, Etienne currently serves as president of that organization. She is also a trustee of North Central Michigan College and a board member of the North Central Michigan College Foundation. While chairing the Michigan Women’s Commission, she worked on projects that support female veterans and victims of human trafficking. Etienne received an Athena Award in 2007.\n\nEtienne joined Rotary in 1990, when she relocated to a new community for work. “Most of my best friends today are people I met through Rotary,” Etienne says. “A lot of people like me join for the networking but end up staying because of the relationships and service.”\n\nAbout three years into her membership, Etienne was invited to a district conference where she became aware of the international reach of Rotary and its Foundation. She championed the sponsorship of her district’s first inbound Ambassadorial Scholar from Afghanistan, who she says became a part of her family. That scholar later earned a master’s degree from Grand Valley State University, returned home to teach at Nangarhār University, and joined a Rotary club.\n\nEtienne has volunteered during National Immunization Days in India and Nigeria, which she found to be life-changing experiences. She says, “It’s so rewarding to see what you accomplish by being part of an organization like Rotary.”\n\nEtienne has served Rotary as a training leader, president’s representative, Rotary coordinator, regional Rotary Foundation coordinator, and Convention Promotion Committee member. She has also moderated the Global Support Seminar and Global Philanthropy Seminar. She currently serves on the steering committee of the Haiti National Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Initiative, through which her district has a partnership with the Rotary Club of Memorial des Gonaives, Artibonite, Haiti.\n\nEtienne has received The Rotary Foundation’s Citation for Meritorious Service and the Distinguished Service Award. She and her husband are Major Donors. When they’re not working, they enjoy sailing on the Great Lakes.\n\nDaniel C. Himelspach\n\nDirector 2023-25\n\nRotary Club of Denver Mile High\n\nColorado, USA\n\nRaised on a sheep and cattle ranch in southeastern Montana, Dan Himelspach earned his chemistry degree from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology. He worked briefly at DuPont as a chemical engineer before joining the U.S. Army as an officer with the Army Corps of Engineers. He later earned his law degree from the University of Denver College of Law and a Master Negotiation Certificate from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School.\n\nAfter working as an attorney at one of Denver’s larger firms and practicing law at a firm he founded with three other attorneys, Himelspach formed Dispute Management Inc., a full-service dispute resolution firm, where he mediated more than 7,000 lawsuits and conducted more than 100 arbitrations.\n\nHimelspach joined Rotary in 1993 and has served in multiple district and zone leadership positions after serving as district governor, including End Polio Now coordinator, regional Rotary Foundation coordinator, and zone institute education week trainer. Himelspach was instrumental in proposing club flexibility provisions that became Enactment 16-21, adopted at the 2016 Council on Legislation. He also served as a representative to the Council on Legislation from 2017 to 2020.\n\nHimelspach has been involved in many local and international service projects, including a long-standing partnership with Rotary clubs in Kathmandu to provide water to a mountain community in Nepal. Himelspach says he was amazed during an in-person site visit to see how the initiative had grown to become an economic empowerment project for women, who were freed up from carrying water and are now entrepreneurs. “I realized the magic of The Rotary Foundation is how we work with local Rotary clubs as partners,” says Himelspach. “I don’t know of any other organization that has the global reach, in quality and extent, that is available to Rotarians through Rotary’s club network.”\n\nHimelspach serves on the boards of two Denver-based nonprofits: WorldDenver, which promotes greater understanding of world affairs and cultures throughout the community, and BrainWise, which develops curricula to teach critical-thinking skills to youth and adults.\n\nHe and his wife, Leslie, are members of the Paul Harris Society and the Bequest Society and are Major Donors.
