        "text": "Ulrika Molander, COO at GreenIron, has been nominated for the Swedish Fe of the Year award 2024. The Fe of the Year award is selected from among the individuals on the list 40 over 40, which gathers 40 women over 40 years in the mining and steel industries who have made significant contributions in their field.\n\nThe background to the award and the list, is that women in the Swedish mining and steel industries still only constitute 20 per cent of all employees. To remain competitive in a global market, the industry needs to be attractive to all talents and potential employees with the right skills. Not least when the industry is now facing the challenge of a huge need for skills.\n\n“Being nominated among these fantastic women is an honour. To create the most successful and sustainable companies, we must intensify our efforts for diversity in all its forms. Inspiring, highlighting, and promoting women is a crucial first step on this journey,” says Ulrika Molander, COO at GreenIron.\n\nMetallkvinnor, Women in Mining Sweden, Jernkontoret, Svemin, and Industriarbetsgivarna have joined forces to highlight skilled and experienced women in Sweden over 40 in the mining and steel industries through the List 40 over 40, established in 2022 to showcase women who have made significant contributions in their fields. For exceptionally outstanding achievements, one woman is also appointed Fe of the Year (Fe as in iron in the periodic table). The winner will be announced in Stockholm on March 6, 2024."
