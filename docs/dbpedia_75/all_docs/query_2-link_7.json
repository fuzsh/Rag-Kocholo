        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn 1920, the year ice hockey was introduced to Sweden in connection with the Olympic Games in Antwerp, the traditional British bandy was already a well established team sport on ice in the country. In the early 1900s it had become popular among the upper classes, both men and women, since its deep connection with nature applied to the time’s sense of nostalgia. The Swedish male bandy cup final, which was first played in 1907, is still the country’s oldest large-scale annual sports event. In the press, comparisons were constantly made between the two sports and bandy and ice hockey were seen as contrasts. This resulted in bandy being regarded as truly Swedish and part of the native culture. Concurrently, the sport spread to the working people in Sweden’s rural manufacturing towns while the capital Stockholm established itself as the centre for ice hockey. Elaborating on Allen Guttmann’s theories on modernization, ice hockey’s higher degree of modernity is presented. Adjusting to the modern world was a struggle for bandy and therefore followers of ice hockey predicted its early demise. Still it survived, however surrounded by an even stronger atmosphere of nature-centred nostalgia. The increasingly Americanized sport of ice hockey, on the other hand, became the main player in the growing commercialization of Swedish sport.\n\nKeywords:\n\nBandy\n\nice hockey\n\nGuttmann\n\nmodernization\n\nAmericanization\n\nnostalgia\n\nIntroduction\n\nAround 1960, ice hockey joined football and cross-country skiing to become one of Sweden’s national sports. The advancement, however, was not uncomplicated. In 1920, the year ice hockey was introduced to Sweden in connection with the Olympic Games in Antwerp, the traditional British bandy was already a well established team sport on ice in the country. Bandy was played on football pitches during the winters, with eleven players in each team, using similar rules to those of football. It would take time for ice hockey to compete against and eventually outcompete bandy’s stronghold. Comparisons were made between the two sports incessantly, thus strengthening their different identities. Bandy became the Swedish sport in relation to the North American ice hockey. Furthermore, bandy symbolized Sweden’s past, while ice hockey represented a new and modern country. Increasingly, bandy became synonymous with nostalgia and the past while ice hockey came to symbolize the present, and the future.\n\nThe source material for the following historical essay is predominately made up of a qualitative analysis of how bandy was reported by Swedish daily newspapers and sports magazines during the period 1907 to 2018, together with several year-books compiled and published by The Swedish Bandy Federation. The year 1907 has been chosen as a starting point, due to the fact that the first final in the Swedish championships in bandy was held the same year. Stockholm-based publications as well as local papers in Sweden’s bandy strongholds, during the season January to March, are surveyed. From 1920 onwards, journalistic accounts of the two sports revolved mainly around the following closely related themes and opposites. Evidently, sports with different degrees of modernity clashed.\n\nLet’s start from the beginning, when bandy became a sport and how it was introduced to Sweden during the latter part of the 1800s.\n\nBandy – the early years\n\nThe modern game of bandy originates in Britain. The immense affection for sports all over the country in the 1800s paved the way even for a new winter sport like bandy and it became rooted primarily in southern and middle England. In 1882, the first rule book of bandy was introduced, followed by the foundation of a national bandy association in 1891.\n\nDue to Europe’s colder climate at the time, the sport’s popularity expanded to other countries. Moreover, games with mixed teams had become fashionable among the upper classes and in for example Copenhagen, men and women played bandy together as a leisure activity from the start. The increasingly mild winters, however, rendered it impossible for the game to become fully established neither in Britain nor Denmark. Nevertheless, British gentlemen, on their travels abroad, introduced the game to exclusive locations for winter sports, such as St. Moritz and Davos, where it was played by mixed sex teams. Bandy progressed into the main cities of Central Europe, only to constantly lose in favour to the more modern indoor game of ice hockey (Andersson Citation2019, 13–14).\n\nThe intrinsic problem for bandy soon became evident: the climate which made it hard to maintain the large, frozen pitch. It was not long after the first ice hockey game was played in London’s ice rinks in the early 20th century that British bandy had lost the competition to the new contender. The progression for ice hockey into the indoor arenas built for ice skating all over Europe, was swift. In Canada, the mother country of ice hockey, the sport started indoors, although also played outdoors. The country’s first indoor game took place in 1875, at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal. The dark, winter nights were yet another predicament for bandy, while ice hockey’s smaller rink could be illuminated by electric lighting when played outdoors. As the European Championships of bandy were organized in 1910, the heyday of bandy in continental Europe was almost over, even though a European bandy Championship was played in Davos in 1913 and saw the English team as winners. The introduction of ice hockey to the prestigious Olympic Games and the ice palace in Antwerp in 1920, further accentuated the relative strengths between the two sports. Furthermore, early experiments with artificially frozen ice contributed to ice hockey’s air of modernity and further expansion (Andersson Citation2019, 13–14).\n\nIce hockey became a global sport, while bandy had to find new and more northern regions to settle in. Hence, it moved to Sweden, Finland and Russia, although it would be a while before the three countries cooperated internationally. Ice hockey was on the offensive while bandy was on the defensive. Bandy was outmoded almost from the start while ice hockey was highly in fashion. Interestingly, Sweden’s first hockey team was also the country’s national team, and played in the Olympic Games in Antwerp. Paradoxically, the team comprised of bandy players. Although the majority of the Swedish team members had never even watched an ice hockey game, they ended up in fourth place. Swedish ice hockey was built from the top down, first on an international level then locally. Bandy was the opposite and started locally and progressed to play international matches.\n\nBandy was introduced to Sweden in the winter of 1895–96 by the Count and sports fanatic Clarence von Rosen. The sport was, for the next couple of decades, to be called hockey. Count von Rosen had discovered bandy through personal contacts in Britain. Consequently, he first introduced the sport to the higher echelons of society in Stockholm and to the country’s diplomatic corps. Its attraction to distinguished players from different countries reflected the cosmopolitan zeitgeist. Men and women played together, among them the King, Gustav V and the famous artist Prince Eugen. The dissimilarities with ice hockey were striking, whose force and vigour excluded women. Bandy, on the other hand, was a chivalrous game, often followed by a Champagne lunch in the most chic areas of Stockholm. Before long, students at the University of Uppsala entered the bandy scene and founded the club that for a long time would dominate the sport in Sweden, IFK Uppsala. The mood of bandy connected high society in Stockholm with the academic elite in Uppsala. Their fellow passion for the exotic game brought status to the sport and would later on also help to give it an air of something that was both sophisticated and profoundly Swedish. The Swedish princes, Wilhelm and Gustaf Adolf (later King Gustaf VI Adolf) belonged to the bandy elite at the beginning of the 1900s. However, the sport’s connection to the female side of the royal family was to become even stronger when a new club was founded in 1908 by twenty-six year old Princess Margareta, lover of sports and wife to Gustaf Adolf. Ladies from high society who, from 1912, played in teams against each other at the actual Olympic Stadium in Stockholm, gathered at The Crown Princess Hockey Club (Kronprinsessans Hockeyklubb). The numerous photos of the club’s activities that have been preserved, show the fascination surrounding the club. In 1913, six female bandy teams were active in Stockholm. The early connections between the royal family and sports in general were possibly stronger than anywhere else (Hellspong Citation2013, 38). However, although the royal affiliation with bandy was robust, with time the connection would loosen.\n\nThe 1907 Swedish male bandy cup final would mark the start of a new era. The event was to become the country’s oldest large-scale annual sports event and, with spectator figures around 20 000 people in the years following WWII, echoing in importance the English FA Cup final. Ever since, the finals have usually been played in either Stockholm or Uppsala. The final was for a long time played at different dates in February or March, all depending on whether temperatures were sufficiently low. Bandy encompassed the fascination and vigour of winter which corresponded with the Swedes and their supposedly close connection to nature. The professor of Uppsala University, Gustav Sundbärg, in his famous book Det svenska folklynnet (The Swedish Character), published in 1911 (Sundbärg Citation1911), considered this the most deeply ingrained Swedish trait. As a consequence of the 1905 disintegration of the union with Norway and the loss of its magnificent alpine scenery, the focus on Sweden’s natural beauty amplified (Nilsson Citation1999). On the whole, at the turn of the century, national romantic thinkers saw deep connections between nation and nature and therefore it is at this time that ideas arise on the significance of nature in Sweden. From now on, it is portrayed not as foe but as a dear friend. This sentiment soon became a cultural reality for what was associated with Swedishness (Hägg Citation2003, 438). At a time when industrialism was advancing, numerous artists and writers joined in and elevated the importance of the Swedish landscape. It has been described as those artists wanted to convey a homage to nature, outside of socio-economic class (Ehn, Frykman, and Löfgren Citation1993, 52). Bandy and the Swedish cult around nature coincided, with Uppsala as its powerhouse. The Swedish Tourist Association was founded here in 1885 and academics from the city joined in droves. The nostalgic, upper classes where part of a trend when they now looked back with longing on times of less stress and a closer relation to natural beauty (Erlandson-Hammargren Citation2006). Swedish nationalism around the 1900s was on the whole retrospective and focussed on the great times of the past (Østerud Citation1997). The snow, the ice and the woods were significant elements in the assertive picture painted of the national character. Furthermore, it was against this background that bandy grew in popularity among players and spectators. Playing bandy on a sunny winter’s day became the ideal. The game fitted perfectly into the romantic local folklore with its longing for old times and ancient traditions. As bandy, in the years between the two world wars, spread to more rural areas and to the working classes, the connection was often made between the game and the communities in idyllic small industrial towns. Especially the finals were occasions when the current game would be observed and compared with past finals, which were idealised in retrospect. The future has always been considered as more of a threat to the world of bandy. The game could be seen as a harmonious combination of culture and nature: A winter sport on natural ice, conducted on an atmospheric background of snow-steeped woodland. Hence, the game’s connection with nature was strong and the nostalgia apparent. Ice hockey, on the other hand with its lack of history, was better suited for a Sweden passionate for progress and modernity (Andersson Citation2019).\n\nBandy is not the only sport to become a national symbol for nostalgia and more uncomplicated nature-loving times. English cricket and American baseball are the prime examples of sports steeped in nostalgia. Early cricket had its heyday at the end of the 1700s, in the rural village of Hambledon in Hampshire, southwest of London. It was here that the game first was played on a higher skill level and already in the 1830s portrayed as the time and place where the lost soul of cricket could be found. The relationship between cricket and football in Britain resembles that between the ‘old’ bandy and the ‘new’ ice hockey in Sweden. Since the game’s leading organization showed a disinterest of grandiose proportions to change, the culture around cricket became difficult to modernize. Cricket was associated with the romantic garden ideal, as opposed to the ugliness of industrialism. In the interwar period, pre-war times were nostalgically recalled as the golden age of cricket. However, cricket has been riddled with nostalgia ever since the first written account of the game (Birley Citation2003).\n\nIn the US, baseball was given a similar role to bandy, however as a more significant national symbol. Baseball fitted well into an urbanized country, whose population at the turn of the century dreamed of the countryside they had left behind. The values conveyed by the game were in line with romantic notions of a small-town, conventional and Anglo-Saxon life, steeped in tradition (Riess Citation1999). The countryside symbolized the good and high moral standards while urban life was evil, corrupt and immoral. Through baseball, surrounded by a green and luscious milieu on the outskirts of American towns, players could for a moment be transferred to a more morally sound place in the provinces. As a contrast, American football represented the more dynamic modernity, in harmony with the big city, industrialization and the growing bureaucracy (Andersson Citation2019, 32).\n\nReturning to Canada, the country’s own invention and national sport, ice hockey – which in Sweden became synonymous with modernity – contrarily came to be associated with nostalgia and romantic ideas of a simpler small-town life of the past. Moreover, many Canadians feel great disappointment in how commercial ice hockey in the USA has influenced the game in Canada (Gruneau and Whitson Citation2012).\n\nBandy is, no doubt, one of a few sports which have come to symbolize the idealised characteristics of a nation, in a truly nostalgic way. Even so, bandy never became the same strong national symbol as baseball in America, cricket in England and ice hockey in Canada. The reason was the constricting forces of nature which prevented its expansion nation-wide. Southern Sweden was too warm, the northern parts too cold and covered in too much snow.\n\nBandy struggles with modernity\n\nEvidently, bandy as a sport is not as forward looking as other Swedish team sports. Bandy, from its early days, was surrounded by an atmosphere of nostalgia and occasionally even an expressed opposition to modernizing the sport. This highlights the fact that the process of modernization differs between sports. Regarding bandy, the problems are evident when using Allan Guttmann’s theories on modernization, as presented in From Ritual to Record (Guttmann Citation1978). Guttmann describes seven distinct traits in modern sports, introduced large-scale during the 1800s. They are characterised by secularism, equality, specialization, rationalization, bureaucratization, quantification and they enhance the notion of record.\n\nI’d like to use the notion of Americanization to summarize those traits in one word. To me, modern sports – also the European – culturally and economically and to an increasing degree, show traits of the same model that signify sports in the US. For example, the growing role of statistics and the following record-finding exercises, even in games where they don’t really matter. Among other attributes, although not mentioned by Guttmann but apparent all the same is the aim to constantly provide action and drama, especially so in television broadcasts. Symbols and rituals originally used in American university and college football, such as chants and club logos, are common features. Furthermore, highly organized and spectacular presentations followed by an emotional response from the spectators and fuelled by music have come to play a bigger part. Moreover, merchandise and food consumption around games have grown in importance. Finally, there are relentless demands on the leagues to make a profit, which have opened up for a system where teams from different countries can play in the same league. However, these are exclusive and constructed to prevent promotion to a higher league or relegation to a lower. To maximize profits for the league, team sports in the US are constantly centred around the big cities. This can be observed as early as 1902, when the first baseball team was sold and moved to a more economically dynamic region (Backman Citation2018). For a European, sports club relocation is probably the most extreme aspect of team sports in America, as the sport’s authenticity is perceived to be lost in the process. Nevertheless, examples of the same tendencies are known, for example in the professional Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) which is controlled by Russia and with teams from a number of different countries.\n\nSports, such as bandy, do not easily conform to the described processes, which is problematic. However, their charm and unique qualities can in the end, turn out to be their salvation.\n\nRegarding bandy, four aspects of Guttmann’s theory are crucial since they point to the challenges of modernizing the game. Natural forces have determined the quality of the ice on the huge bandy pitch. Moreover, the teams have to battle against strong winds and sunshine in their eyes. Thus, making it nigh on impossible to secure equal terms. Since a majority of players for a long time have combined bandy with other sports the move towards specialization and professionalization has been slow. The idea of rationalization refers to rules and equipment. One example of the lack of rationality is the long and hard process to reach unanimity internationally around the size of the ball used in bandy. Finally, bureaucratization is applicable, since the aim for the Swedish Bandy Association (founded 1925) for many years was to keep the game small-scale.\n\nHowever, since they do not fully encapsulate the complexities of modern sports, my intention is to further elaborate on Guttmann’s theory. Further problems occur when trying to apply the theory to European team sports, and especially the most significant of them all: football. The notion of the record is more or less lacking and the whole rationale of a game ending 0–0 can be questioned. Guttmann’s theories are more useful in studies of individual sports, athletics for example. Moreover, they correspond with the evolvement of team sports in the US, such as baseball, American football and basketball. Those are, to a higher degree specialized, rationalized, quantified and aiming for records than their European counterparts.\n\nAmerican sports were developed from British examples. However, they became more individualistic, middle-class, commercial, rough, scientific and packed with action. In other words, they were more modern than their British models (Markovits Citation1989). While a game of cricket could take up to nine days, a game of baseball was completed in less than two hours. While ice hockey originated in Canada, the NHL was modelled by the US, and therefore far more Americanised than bandy. Interestingly, Torsten Tegnér, Sweden’s probably most distinguished and intellectual sports journalist, already in 1920, and with the progress of ice hockey around the world, pondered on whether ‘European sports are doomed to become Americanized’ (Stark Citation2010, 369). Following on from Guttmann’s theories, three further characteristics can be added to the process of modernization in sports: commercialization, mediatisation, and globalization. These are most prominent in American sports and problematic to the world of bandy. The sport of bandy, even at the top level, is still more or less played by amateurs. Thanks to the speed and the size of the ball, bandy does not easily fit the TV format. With globalization, constant attempts are made to expand sports into uncharted territories to find new consumers and supporters abroad. Furthermore, through globalization, games in the National Hockey League (NHL) have been played in Sweden, and transnational leagues such as the NHL and KHL have been set up. Teams from Russia, Finland and China are involved in KHL and play in the same league. Bandy, on the other hand, and despite many attempts through the years, has failed to expand as a global sport. The World Championships, which started in 1957, have remained small-scale and almost always ends with Soviet Union/Russia and Sweden in the finals. A much coveted place in the Olympic Games is still not in reach.\n\nWhen elaborating on Guttmann’s theories, it is possible to speak of modern sports as Americanized and consisting of ten characteristics. Since bandy has problems concerning seven of those – equality, specialization, rationalization bureaucratization, commercialization, mediatisation and globalization – the sport’s lack of modernization are highlighted. Ice hockey was more in line with the times when it comes to modernity.\n\nThe all-encompassing problems bandy had to tackle are illustrated by the hardships in even arranging matches, due to faulty ice. Up until the 1950s or 1960s, and the introduction of artificially frozen ice, the game was quite often played on lakes. Through ongoing climate changes and mild winters, not even the artificially frozen pitches are safe. Since some bandy clubs, in the 21st century, have built indoor arenas, the sport’s nature today is dual, as on the highest level it is played both indoors and outdoors. However, pre-modern features still occur at times. One example is the Women Bandy World Championships in China in 2018, which was played on a lake and without electric light. Due to the slow and complex modernization of bandy in Sweden, the sport has been marginalized by ice hockey.\n\nThe arrival of ice hockey and the sudden Swedishness of bandy\n\nIn the beginning, bandy was not regarded as Swedish. One of the sport’s ideologists wrote about its introduction in Sweden: ‘Bandy was a beautiful, Nordic sport with roots in England and Friesland, tried out in Stockholm and Sweden since 1895 and honed to perfection in Uppsala, the Baltics, in Denmark and by Russians’ (Tegnér Citation1968, 46). This would change by 1920, when bandy was compared to a more modern sport, i.e. the transatlantic game of ice hockey. With the encounter with ice hockey, bandy would rapidly gain its Swedish identity. In comparison with ice hockey, bandy was signified by a slow modernizing process, with links to the past and strong associations with nature and winter. Ice hockey was the exponent for full-scale modernization and Americanization. Symptomatically, the average bandy player was often older than the ice hockey player (Stark Citation2010). Sports historian Bill Sund, in the spirit of Ferdinand Tönnies, considers bandy an older and more harmonious Gemeinschaft while ice hockey signifies a more modern and commercial Gesellschaft. Furthermore, he places the big city pulse of ice hockey on par with that of boxing (Sund Citation2002).\n\nSwedish ice hockey started off on the highest level globally, at the Olympic Games 1920 in Antwerp. Among the initiators were Raoul Le Mat, American film-maker who worked in Sweden and Anton Johanson, then chairman of the Swedish Football Association and a person who thrived in international circles. Ice hockey historian Tobias Stark, characterises the venture in Antwerp as elitist, driven by a few influential figures at the top of Swedish sports and society with an huge appetite for international contacts in the world of sports (Stark Citation2010).\n\nAn almost compulsory comparison between the two games started as soon as ice hockey was introduced in Sweden. A daily newspaper in Stockholm wrote: ‘Ice hockey is not as beautiful as our bandy/…/However, the game’s reckless speed and the passionate excitement will obviously overtake bandy’ (Dagens Nyheter, March 11, 1920). Invented in America, ice hockey’s more modern approach was enough to declare bandy dead. Anton Johanson predicted its total extinction already in the mid-1920s (Idrottsbladet, January 2, 1929). The imminent death of bandy has regularly been declared since then.\n\nThe presumption being that ice hockey, as had happened on the continent, would knock bandy out. On the other hand, some did not believe in a future for ice hockey. In Sweden’s leading sports magazine, Idrottsbladet, a reporter meant that the sport could possibly survive in Stockholm but not in the rest of the country (Idrottsbladet, February 11, 1922). The conflict line was drawn between Stockholm and the industrialized, bandy-loving areas of middle Sweden. The presumption was that country folk didn’t understand ice hockey. In the conflict between the two sports, bandy became Swedish. As a result, the press described bandy as ‘our ancient and unmistakably national game of bandy’ (Idrottsbladet, February 11, 1922). Bandy was Sweden’s ‘national treasure’ (Dagens Nyheter, December 10, 1921).\n\nFurthermore, bandy was perceived as helping ice hockey, and was attacked instead of thanked. Torsten Tegnér wrote: ‘The powers in operation to reject or reduce bandy, the free game of the gentle Nordic winters, and totally or partially replace it with the ice palaces’ exciting acrobatics of ice hockey are strong’ (Idrottsbladet, December 16, 1921).\n\nBandy was characterised by its lack of organization and lack of bureaucracy. It was to a higher degree perceived as associated with leisure and recreation than ice hockey was. Not until 1925, a national association for bandy was founded. Since players in general were not specialized in the sport, ice hockey in the early years would grow by attracting bandy players to the game. Several players had tried both sports. One example is the legendary IFK Uppsala goalkeeper, ‘Sleven’ Säfwenberg who had won the European Championships in ice hockey. Hence, the players were not clearly divided and separated by enemy lines. Instead, bandy players were frequently involved in a number of different sports. Since the season was short and the weather was unreliable, athletes frequently chose other sports, usually football. Combining bandy with football rather than with ice hockey was less complicated since the games are played during different seasons. As late as in 1962, three players were part of both the national team of bandy and football. Gösta Sandberg was one of them and, after even playing in the national ice hockey team, became the last player to represent Sweden in three different sports. In the 1970s, several elite players combined football with bandy, which still occurs in women’s bandy. To the observer, ice hockey’s breakthrough was strongly connected to the modern world’s business practices and common held longing for sensation. Thus, the pure amateurism of bandy stood out. Compared to football, Torsten Tegnér saw the smaller-scale game of bandy, played between friendly teams and during healthfully, short seasons as less capitalistic and more democratic. He drew parallels with the sophisticated world of opera:\n\n‘Regarding opera, megacities like London and Chicago has yet something to learn from the farming village of Bayreuth. Likewise, bandy can give influences to 30 times bigger sports associations’ (Idrottsbladet, January 17, 1941).\n\nIce hockey was rational. It was far easier to manage the snow on the much smaller rinks. Moreover, spectators could easily follow the puck and managed to stay warm thanks to the shorter game. Conversely, the general opinion of a game of bandy was that it was quite dreadful to watch in cold weather. On the other hand, bandy and its deep relation with the Swedes’ mentality and love of nature was emphasized. In 1922, a Swedish sports journalist wrote:\n\n‘Although the game is variable, there is something murky and trapped about ice hockey. The wooden walls, the gigantic chicken wire and the copious electric lighting, all swept inside the dark cloak of night. The feeling is of something artificial, and laboured, a circus pantomime that gives you no joy to watch. No, I’d rather attend a bandy game out on the open field of ice […] we Swedes love the freedom and the merry games among the uninhibited formations of nature. We worship the sun, the light and the strong winds. We are horrified by dark deeds so when all is said and done we’d rather miss a game of ice hockey at night for bandy played during the day’ (Idrottsbladet, February 11, 1922).\n\nThe discussion on the national mentality, its nuances and eccentricities were de rigueur. A recurring theme was that bandy was considered to be deeply connected to the Swedish mentality:\n\n‘Not to be boastful, but Swedes and all who live in the north are considered to be decent human beings. We love all things beautiful and are provided with a rather strong sense of form and style. And, to brag a little, since we are highly cultured, to me no other winter game should be as fascinating as bandy. Let us keep bandy! Ice hockey in all honour, but what is the point of it? Especially since we already have a most satisfactory game on ice which – and certainly to a higher degree than ice hockey does – appeals to both players and spectators. Although imported, bandy is our game. If we can’t get the rest of the world to prefer bandy to ice hockey, well then it’s their loss’ (Idrottsbladet, February 18, 1929).\n\nOne topic in the debate was whether the two sports could co-exist or bandy would be knocked out. The possibility of ice hockey disappearing was never mentioned. Despite ice hockey’s modern approach and although it was considered the game of the future, it did not attract a great number of followers initially. The numbers watching the games were pitiful. In the years between the wars, the number of bandy players greatly surpassed those who played ice hockey (Stark Citation2010). According to Torsten Tegnér, ice hockey should seek its fortunes in the far north, which he called ‘the land, unsuitable to bandy; with its long dark winter evenings and masses of snow’ (Idrottsbladet, January 2, 1929). Bandy gave up the north to ice hockey. The game fitted in well with the wide and unchartered expanse of northern Sweden considered as a Klondike and, like America, a land for the future (Stark Citation2010).\n\nTo widen the perspective, bandy was not only more Swedish but more European than transatlantic ice hockey. Historian Martin Alm analyzes how the US was portrayed in Sweden in the years leading up to WWII. In comparison to the new world, Europe, i.e. the old world, was regarded as closer to nature, rich in traditions and highly cultured (Alm Citation2002).\n\nOn the other hand, the more sophisticated style of bandy was also a cause for criticism. Advocates of ice hockey questioned its masculinity and considered the sport ‘a harmless game, suitable to children and young ladies’ (Idrottsbladet, March 3, 1930). The counterargument was that, compared to bandy’s robust country lads, the problem with ice hockey was that the players were ‘weakly built Vikings’ from central Stockholm (Idrottsbladet, March 2, 1936). Hence, Sweden’s national ice hockey team, with a majority of players based in Stockholm, were expected to run into trouble against more masculine transatlantic players. Later, the argument to bandy’s advantage was that even in the top league players in their 40’s could still be active without the risk of burn-out (Svenska Bandyboken 1954Citation1953). Still today, several of those who play bandy in the highest division in Sweden are in their 40’s.\n\nWhile bandy could only dream of the same playing conditions, in 1931 the modern game of ice hockey moved indoors.\n\n‘Naturally, and provided that patrons travel the world and build indoor arenas, bandy could become an international sport and have more active players than ice hockey. However, due to the high expense involved in such scheme the likelihood of this happening forthwith is negligible. Moreover, since bandy would require huge ice palaces, it is hard to imagine any architect skilled enough to construct anything of its kind’ (Bandy- och Ishockeyboken 1935Citation1934, 91).\n\nThe constantly low numbers of spectators on ice hockey games was regarded a victory for bandy and its growing crowds. ‘A delightful triumph for the old, elegant and profoundly Swedish intelligent game of bandy over the transatlantic import!’ (Idrottsbladet, January 20, 1932). However, Stockholm’s geography was favourable to ice hockey. The capital was the game’s driving force. The limited available space in the city’s central areas suited ice hockey while bandy thrived in the suburbs with their close proximity to frozen lakes. Throughout the 1930s, according to general belief, ice hockey had ruined bandy in Stockholm. The reason for this was that many bandy players used ice hockey skates, which impaired the slide. Ice hockey also impacted negatively on the players’ shooting ability as they mimicked the motion of swinging the hockey stick towards the puck. From 1939, the year the artificial ice hockey rink at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium was opened, it was obvious that the two sports on ice represented separate degrees of modernity. When the finals of the Swedish Bandy Championships were played at the same Olympic Stadium, some parts were artificial ice while the rest of the pitch was naturally frozen. Consequently, around one of the two goals, the ice was perfect while the rest of the playing surface could be in a terrible condition. Thanks to the smaller rinks, ice hockey installed electric lighting, which facilitated evening games (Andersson Citation2019). At the stadium in Stockholm, the two sports embodied different eras: modern ice hockey and pre-modern bandy.\n\nIce hockey’s victory\n\nDespite its expansion in the post-war period, bandy was a dying sport in the eyes of ice hockey. Thus, bandy star Nicke Bergström concluded in his 1957 autobiography – at the height of the game’s popularity – that he firmly believed in a future for bandy (Bergström Citation1957). Although the popularity of bandy was at its peak in the 1950s, at the end of the decade ice hockey gained momentum and left bandy behind. A successful World Championship in Stockholm in 1949, which was broadcasted live on radio, became the starting point. The national team lead ice hockey’s following, triumphal procession (Dahlén Citation1999). The chain of events emphasize the fact that ice hockey was built from the top down. In 1959, and from bandy’s vantage point, ice hockey’s progression was summed up thus: ‘Those who wrote the rules of ice hockey were much more far-sighted but scrupulous and without illusions. They acknowledged the evils of this world which were ignored by those who, in more idyllic times, wrote the rules of bandy’ (Bandyboken 1959Citation1958, 74–75).\n\nA strong commercial ethos pervaded the world of ice hockey. The sport became the national front runner for advertising on shirt backs. Swedish ice hockey may have even introduced the idea of advertising space on shirts to the world of team sports. A telling analysis of the game declared that it was more vibrant and extravagant than bandy. In the course of the 1950s, the number of clubs, as well as average attendance figures at highest level ice hockey, surpassed bandy (Bandy genom årenCitation1975). Moreover, ice hockey spread out geographically and in 1957 a team from Gävle, in northern Sweden, became the first champions outside of Stockholm. Although the game was backed by the dominant capital, it never again would draw crowds in Stockholm as large as those who attended in the beginning of the 1960s (Hellspong Citation2013). The fast-moving game of ice hockey was favoured by the positive attitude towards North America after the war. The sport was in harmony with Sweden, a country that was turning increasingly modern and rich. However, a Swedish playing style had to be introduced accentuated by its high moral standards, co-operation, execution and skating. Thus, in contrast to the vulgar and brutalized spirit of the game in America (Stark Citation2010).\n\nIn the midst of USA’s popularity was an element of critical thinking as the country was perceived as superficial and over commercialized (Salomon Citation2007). Among Swedes, violence in transatlantic hockey caused mixed emotions. The complexity of modernity was evident in ice hockey since development of materialism did not necessarily mean spiritual and cultural improvement. The modern Swedish project, ice hockey included, did not evolve into a copy of America. Instead, ice hockey was civilised and made Swedish. Simultaneously, and together with football, it became the national sport.\n\nAround the mid-1900s, bandy players were still marginally more established in the higher echelons of society than ice hockey players were. However, both had their roots in the lower stratum of the Swedish population (Svensson Citation1953). With time, ice hockey became seemingly more strongly established in the higher social classes than bandy was (Stark Citation2010). Therefore, ice hockey gradually began to play a part in the middle-class triumph. Surveys conducted in the early 70s show that it cost two or three times more to equip an ice hockey team than a team of bandy players (Sveder Citation1972). Ice hockey’s stronger position higher up in society facilitated council support when ice hockey rinks were planned. Not only was the game fashionably North American, it was rational and only demanded a smaller playing surface. The growing ice hockey preferences are clearly demonstrated by the fact that in 1950, Stockholm had only one artificial ice rink, at the Stockholm Olympic Stadium. Thereafter, ice hockey’s progression accelerated and ten years later, the number had grown to fifty, while there were only three artificially frozen ice pitches for bandy. The situation for bandy had become so desperate, that games had to be played on lakes covered in ice not thick enough to hold the players’ weight. In 1960, and in a top league game, ten players went through the ice (Svenska Dagbladet, January 1 1960). The drama was captured by a photographer and the pictures published in the American magazine Life.\n\nThe spirit of the time is apparent in this analysis: ‘The cold is evidently to blame for the small attendance at the outdoor game of bandy while the conditions in which the indoor game of ice hockey are played are much more favourable’ (Idrottsbladet, January 5, 1966). Moreover, while bandy struggled with the councils’ refusals, the modernizing process of ice hockey was explosive. In 1954, Gothenburg became the second Swedish city after Stockholm to build its first artificial ice rink (Johansson and Nilsson Citation1992). Shortly thereafter, in 1958, Jönköping built an indoor arena and in 1962, a roof was built on the Johanneshov ice stadium in Stockholm. By 1964, Stockholm had nine artificial ice rinks for ice hockey and none for bandy (Idrottsbladet, January 29, 1964). Bitterly, bandy’s observers describe the conduct of ice hockey’s representatives:\n\n‘They realised the game’s great potential, and resolved the problems of the mild weather in the south and the snow in the north. They whole-heartedly went in for artificial ice rinks and intently worked the right people, on a national level as well as on the councils. Naturally, in their tireless arguing, ice hockey’s spokesmen canvassed only for ice rinks suitable for ice hockey and with claims that bigger and more suited to bandy would cost a fortune, they scared numerous councillors’ (Bandy genom årenCitation1975, 50).\n\nSince the move was so swift between natural ice rinks and artificial indoor ice rinks, elite-level ice hockey just about skipped a level in its modernization process. Meanwhile, bandy’s spokespersons cultivated their resistance to modernity by, year in and year out, debating the low rims of the rink which, via Russia, was introduced to Sweden in 1955. They discussed whether the rational advantages of fewer interruptions after the introduction of the rim compensated for the impaired aesthetics of the beautiful winger’s game.\n\nIce hockey out-classed bandy in practicality and comfort. In 1972 the strength ratio between the two sports were: fifty-five indoor ice rinks and 135 artificial ice rinks outdoor for ice hockey against eighteen artificial ice pitches for bandy. An entrepreneurial group of managers who, with greater success than the quiet men of bandy, canvassed their sport emphasized the modern energy that surrounded ice hockey. Ice hockey was the modern game for the future. With its ingrained traditions, bandy faded away in nostalgia over its glory days in the 1950s. In Gävle, home to bandy’s first Swedish championships final in 1907, the sport was erased in the 1960s. Thanks to the growing number of indoor arenas, ice hockey grew nation-wide and coped with the warm weather in the south and the cold of the north (Andersson Citation2019).\n\nHowever, the downside of North American modernity, as displayed by the teams touring Europe and Sweden, became a drawback for Swedish ice hockey. The critics commented unfavourably on the sport’s sensationalism, violence and commercialism. Torsten Tegnér considered ice hockey a gladiator game, while bandy was on par with cricket as sports with higher moral standards. He compared bandy to oysters and ice hockey to the simpler mussels. He made comparisons with the introduction of the cinema and how everyone then had, wrongly, predicted the death of theatre. Bandy, with its elegance and beauty, was above mundane things, like money. Through the decades, and in step with their time, similar parables have been made. In 1979, a journalist wrote that bandy was a languishing waltz in comparison to the hard pop of ice hockey (Katrineholms-Kuriren, March 20, 1979). In his memoirs, the famous writer Lars Gustafsson bemoans the fact that cultivated bandy, regrettably, was squeezed out by the simple-minded game of ice hockey in Västerås, his home town (Lif Citation2001). Notably, bandy was often associated with middle- and upper-class phenomena and culture, even after it was socioeconomically surpassed by ice hockey. During the millennium, and the temporary renaissance of bandy, the parables continued. In Aftonbladet, which has the greatest number of readers of all Swedish newspapers, a cultural journalist contrasted the musicality of bandy to the fixation on violence that signified ice hockey: ‘Johan Claesson’s sizzling impossible angle goals are like the perfectly timed timpani in Haydn’s London symphonies’. Yet another culture journalist speculated on the intellectuals and their fascination with bandy. The authenticity of bandy culture stood in stark contrast to the commercialized adversary and its prerequisite, the howling music. ‘Bandy is culturally refined while ice hockey is Americanized and lacks culture. Bandy spectators are still unfashionably good-tempered’ (Aftonbladet, March 23, 1997). Minister for Culture and Sports, Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth, did not hesitate to compare the two sports: ‘I enjoy the atmosphere at bandy games. It’s different to that of the other big sport on ice’ (Upsala Nya Tidning, March 15, 2007). Furthermore, one journalist opined that there were few things more Swedish than bandy and saw its recent boom as a reaction against the Americanization that Swedish sports was steeped in and advocated by ice hockey (Argus Citation2002).\n\nThe basis of bandy’s problems was that, in the complex game, it was nigh on impossible for the spectator to follow the ball. In that, it reminded of cricket and baseball while ice hockey resembled the more popular sport of British football. The North American league, NHL blazed the trail for ice hockey by, artificially, paint the ice white which helped the spectators and the television viewers to follow the puck (Persson Citation2008). Bandy had to do with the darker, naturally coloured ice. With the introduction of television, the latest in new technology, Swedish ice hockey went full throttle. It became the first televised sport and, together with football, rapidly the most shown. Earlier on, by broadcasting throughout the World Championships in Stockholm in 1949, radio had decisively popularized ice hockey. From now on, televised broadcasts of the World Championships in ice hockey turned in to tremendous get-togethers. Thanks to the broadcasts of the national team’s games ice hockey’s immense popularity spread to all levels. The sport surpassed every other team sport when it came to the number of international games. Tobias Stark observes that ice hockey appears to have attracted an audience from a wide social spectrum and almost the entire population at important international matches. Furthermore, the alert evening press was behind the sport and generated a strong relationship with the television broadcasts. An unrivalled 82 per cent of the Swedish population, in 1970 watched the match against the Soviet Union on television. Evidently, on television, the national ice hockey team’s popularity had unquestionably exceeded that of the national football team. Stark summarizes: ‘Within half a century, the sport of ice hockey had, from being an insignificant import from North America positioned on the backyards of the Swedish Sports Confederation, turned into a blue and yellow fixture in the front room of the welfare state’ (Stark Citation2010, 358). According to Stark, by its constant emphasis on the sport’s idyllic traditions, bandy simultaneously was considered outdated by the younger generation (Stark Citation2010). The winner in the world of sports thus grabbed much of media’s attention while bandy, a loser due to the changing times, was relegated to the periphery. Bo Reimer, in his book on televised sports, concludes that bandy is the sport considered to be the most demanding to televise (Reimer Citation2002).\n\nThanks to television, ice hockey became the sport that would drive the commercialization of Swedish sports. Currently, the annual revenue of a team in Swedish ice hockey’s highest league is circa 175 million SEK. That sum corresponds to the revenue of the fourteen teams in the highest division in bandy put together. Ice hockey exemplifies a dynamic Sweden and especially its thriving, mid-sized cities. Bandy is associated with poor, rural municipalities with a dwindling population (Andersson Citation2019). Commercialized ice hockey stands out, even in comparison with football. From the 1960s onwards, it was the sport most attractive to business. Prior to the more conservative world of football, ice hockey pioneered advertising on shirts already in 1959 (1972 in football). Furthermore, from the 1960s, players from other countries were allowed to play in the Swedish top league, while the same liberal rules were introduced fully to football first in 1979. At the turn of the last century, ice hockey dominated Swedish sport’s advancement of indoor sports arenas. At the time when the first few, new Swedish football stadiums opened, almost all second generation ice hockey indoor arenas had already been built (Andersson Citation2016).\n\nThe dynamics behind ice hockey can be found in the economic hardships that followed the sport at the start. In the 1960s, the situation was so bad that an entirely new approach was required for the sport to become financially viable. Football, routinely relied on their fans’ attendance, which ice hockey couldn’t to the same extent. Since hegemonic NHL have never practised the transfer system of European football, revenues from sales of players has never been a way for ice hockey clubs to make money. For example, in 1992 the main source of income for football clubs was player transfers. In the highest league of football 38 per cent of revenues came from transfers, compared to only two per cent in ice hockey (Johansson Citation1994). Swedish ice hockey pushed itself away from the long-lived Swedish ideal of amateur sports to become more business minded. As a result, in the 1970s and 80s, ice hockey worked its way up and passed football to become the nation’s favourite sport. This position was recaptured by football only at the beginning of the 21st century. In the 1980s, sponsoring broke through in Swedish sports and as a consequence, ice hockey became progressively more skilful in the art of attracting sponsors. Football wasn’t in the forefront of sponsoring. Therefore, and unsurprisingly, around 1990, the country’s ice hockey clubs earned higher revenue than the clubs of football (Idrottens Affärer, 7 1993 and 3 1994). The progression continued in Sweden, and in 2010 eight of the ten clubs with the highest sponsor revenue were ice hockey clubs. Modo Hockey, from the small town of Örnsköldsvik (55 000 inhabitants) in the north, surpassed both the big football teams in Stockholm and Gothenburg, AIK and IFK Göteborg, in terms of sponsor revenue (Idrottens Affärer, 4 1990; Sydsvenskan, June 8, 2010). However, in the last years, football has caught up with ice hockey. All the same, the Americanised game of ice hockey is still the game that has modernized the entire Swedish world of team sports. To bandy, ice hockey’s triumph meant that nostalgia has become its increasingly stronger feature. Remarkably though, the attendance numbers have not grown since a large number of matches moved indoors. Although the Swedish bandy cup finals attracted a record number of 38 000 spectators in 2013 after it was moved to the indoor Friends Arena in Stockholm, the attendance figures went down again and in 2018 the finals were again played outdoors and in Uppsala. Similarly to those who attended the finals in 1907, the audience preferred to watch the game in the cold and with the proximity to nature."
