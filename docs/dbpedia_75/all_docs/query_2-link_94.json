        "text": "When I wrote my dissertation, “Medeltidens åkerbruk “ (=medieval arable farming) 1985, the goal was to go through all the source materials and identify virtually all evidence on the technology used. From this work emerged the idea that agriculture is a system, one in each individual region and time prevailing \"technologically complex,\" and that a crucial errors technology historian done was to concentrate on a few \"big\" innovations. In fact, it was a myriad of small and diverse technical solutions that would be studied. In this article I make the first summary in English, and describes the new technological complex which was introduced in Sweden during the period 1000-1300. (Then I started a project about the 1500s, which were summarized in another article.)\n\nThis is the summary of my dissertation (Medeltidens åerbruk), published in 1985, and the public defense of the dissertation was in January 1986. The goal was to give a detailed description of agriculture, see diagram 6, page 155. This then led to the interpretation about technical complex, which I later further developed. This interpretation is thus based on an inductive approach rather than a deductive – though I of course was steered by general ideas of an economic base and small scale technology as decisive. The cover is one of my favorite pictures, showing plowing in the fall after harvest when animals graze the meadows - it is from 1437, Tensta, Uppland and shows Adam / Cain working.\n\nThe development and establishment of agriculture in Northern Sweden has since long been believed to appear during the Late Iron Age, close to the Viking period, but recent finds from the Bronze Age in Umeå has opened up new discussion of when agriculture first emerged. Although too early to discuss where and when it developed, the material currently available on the topic allows for discussion for how it developed. By looking at sediment and soil conditions surrounding the settlements in combination with palaeoenvironments and past climate one aim was to try and search for settlement patterns in relation to agricultural potential, this was however unsuccessful. Cultivation practices were analysed using weed and wetland flora as well as agricultural indicators in pollen diagrams. Most settlements appear to focus firstly on animal husbandry and secondarily on cultivating crops, and they might have because of their coastal positioning also relied on fishing. The results confirmed previous hypothesis about the development of agriculture and cultivation practices in Northern Sweden during the Bronze and Iron Age, however, some issues remain concerning the lacking osteological material.\n\nAfter the dissertation I started a project on the 1500s, based in the very rich source material from Sweden. Along with Johan Söderberg I published the book \"Kontinuitetens dynamik” (= dynamics of continuity) 1991. In this book I wrote a chapter on almost two hundred pages (p 259-434), which thus is a book in the book. It's about the technical complex introduced during this period and how this was a limited leap forward - compared to the High Middle Ages and 1700s. In this article, I provide a summary in English. Along with the study of medieval technological leap these two forms the basis for a theory of technological complexes crucial role in technological development - and stagnation.\n\nMacrofossil data from 73 sites dating to the south Swedish Iron Age (500 b.c.–a.d. 1100) have been compiled and analyzed in order to elucidate long term changes in cereal cultivation. The analyses indicate that “permanent field” agriculture was established at the end of the Bronze Age utilizing Hordeum vulgare var vulgare as a primary crop and Triticum aestivum ssp vulgare/compactum, Triticum spelta/dicoccum/monococcum, Avena sativa and Secale cereale as secondary crops. An observed change towards the end of Roman Iron Age (1–a.d. 400) is the expansion of Secale cereale and Avena sativa cultivation. Evidence also suggests that winter sowing of the former commenced at the latest during the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries a.d. The introduction of winter sowing possibly coincided with the establishment of crop rotation agriculture. During most of the Iron Age southern Sweden displays significant regional variations with regards to cereal cultivation practice. There is however evidence that a more homogenous agriculture appeared across the investigated area from the beginning of the Viking Age (a.d. 800–1100) onwards.\n\nThe power of Scandinavian Iron Age society was based on control over people and personal relationships. An emerging aristocracy from c. AD 200 demanded tributes from both free and unfree peasants. This tributary system was based on various population groups who were linked by mutual obligations and services. In this context the interregional central places were bases for economic, political and religious control over large areas. Among these central places was Old Uppsala in eastern Sweden. There must have been an economy in the form of agricultural production from settlements that maintained these places. The economy and social structure at two large settlements showed similarities and differences in agricultural production in the period 200 BC–AD 600. The differences are expressed by an anatomical underrepresentation among cattle and a deficit in the mortality profile of lamb at one of the settlements. There was also a specialized production of non-agricultural products at the same settlement. These settlements must have played an important role in Old Uppsala’s tributary system. The differences indicate that the settlements had different access and rights to land and economic resources. The study shows that seemingly similar settlements can harbour major economic and social differences."
