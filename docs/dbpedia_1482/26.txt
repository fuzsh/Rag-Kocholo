For such a prolific author, Nathaniel B. Sylvester seems to have written very little of an autobiographical nature. He was author of histories of New York State's Saratoga, Rensselaer and Ulster Counties along with many other works of history and folklore. He gave a few details of his life in his Historical Sketches of Northern New York, but otherwise was apparently very shy about relating his life history. In his History of Rensselaer County, for example, he wrote a lengthy biography of his law partner Gilbert Robertson Jr., but mentioned his own name only once: as a member of the bar of Rensselaer County in 1879. In another publication

as a son of Nathaniel and Sarah (Bartlett) Sylvester.

Sylvester's Historical Sketches of Northern New York and the Adirondack Wilderness, published in 1877, contains these passages:

"To the memory of My Only Brothers, an elder and a younger, who in their early manhood, both died in the same year, this volume is affectionately dedicated."

"Twenty years ago this morning, that is to say, on the 23rd day of September, 18-- [sic], I left the old homestead farm and went to the village of Lowville, to enter upon the untried field of another vocation. . . . laid away the pitchfork and plough to take them up no more." (It is unknown in what year he wrote these paragraphs: the 1855 NY State Census of Lowville lists Sylvester at age 30, stating that he had been there for seven years, so he must have left the farm about 1847 or 1848.)

The 1850 Federal Census of Lewis County lists Sylvester by his initials N.B., age 27 and born in New York State, as a "law student." He lived then in a rooming house in the village of Lowville.

Appleton's Cyclopedia continues:

"He received his early education at the Denmark academy, studied law at Lowville, NY, and was admitted to the bar at Oswego NY on 5 April 1852."

On January 18 1853, at Argyle, Washington County NY, N.B. Sylvester of Lowville married Sarah Jane Taylor of Argyle. She was born in 1823 in Washington County NY, a daughter of Duncan and Sarah (Mairs) Taylor.

The law firm was listed the same way until 1868, when it moved to 37 Congress.

The 1865 New York State Census listed Sylvesters growing family in Lansingburgh. His son Samuel had been joined by a daughter Emma in 1862, both children having been born in Lewis County. In the Troy directories Sylvesters home address was listed as John Street in Lansingburgh in 1865; at 185 Congress, Lansingburgh, in 1866 and 1867; 190 State, Lansingburgh, in 1868; and "at Saratoga" in 1869, when his primary entry added that he was a U.S. Commissioner. The 1867 Troy directory had listed him as a commissioner only in a section titled "United States Officers".

Some sources, including an obituary published in the Saratoga Sentinel, report that shortly after the death of Judge John A. Corey, Sylvester was named a United States Commissioner for Saratoga County. Actually, Corey was appointed U.S. Commissioner in 1856 and served as such until his death in 1873,

In the 1880 Saratoga Springs directory, Sylvester's listing is "U. S. Commissioner, 12 Ainsworth Pl.; home 63 Franklin." The census of that year shows that his household still included his two children plus one servant, Moses King, who also had been with the family in 1875.

The bulk of Sylvester's body of works was published in a decade stretching from 1876 to 1886. A planned historical work on the Upper Hudson and Champlain Valleys area of New York was at least partially completed. A salesman's sample of this work is known to exist, but no completed and published version can be found, and it is not listed in the Union Catalogs. Many works of this type were offered by subscription before the actual printing was done. A salesman would obtain orders from not only booksellers but for direct purchases from the general public. It may be that the advance sales of this work did not indicate demand sufficient to warrant a printing.

In 1888 and 1889 the Sylvesters made their home at 105 State Street, and in 1890 they were boarding at 541 Broadway. In the 1892 Saratoga Springs Directory, Mrs. S.J. Sylvester advertised her business as proprietor of a boarding house at 550 Broadway:

"THE WILLOUGHBY" Situated on North Broadway. Large and elegant rooms, Handsomely furnished. Excellent table. Charges moderate for superior accommodations.

The 1893 listing has Nathaniel B. Sylvesters home at 637 Broadway, where Mrs. S.J. Sylvester is listed again as proprietor of a boarding house: only the establishments name and address are changed in the advertisement:

"THE MAPLES" Mrs. S. Sylvester, proprietor. Situated on North Broadway. Large and elegant rooms, Handsomely furnished. Excellent table. Charges moderate for superior accommodations.

Mr. Sylvesters last contribution to a publication was in 1893, when a new Saratoga County history was published. This book was primarily a vehicle for printing biographies of the county's "prominent men and leading citizens" these biographical sketches were prepared by other writers.

The Saratoga Springs directory for 1894 lists Mrs. Sylvester as a housekeeper at 525 Broadway, where Nathaniel and his son Samuel M. are listed as boarders. As late as 1875, the census listings had shown two servants employed in Sylvesters household. One might conclude that by the 1890s his law practice and his literary pursuits were not providing a substantial enough income to support an independent household. The losses incurred as a result of the mortgage foreclosure in 1879 probably also contributed to the family's decline in fortune.

The 1895 city directory states that Nathaniel B. Sylvester died in 1894, and that Mrs. Nathaniel B. Sylvester, widow, had removed to Jacksonville, Florida. Samuel M. Sylvester had, according to that year s directory, moved to Argyle in Washington County, NY.

As reported in N.B. Sylvesters obituary in the Saratoga Sentinel, he died at one a.m. on July 13, 1894, at the home of his sister-in-law Susan E. Taylor at Argyle. He was survived by his widow, by his son Samuel Sylvester and by a daughter, Mrs. Frank W. Lawrence of Saratoga Springs. The Troy Budget ran an obituary which stated that Sylvester died of Brights disease, a kidney ailment. The Budget further told that he had been in poor health and had gone to Argyle in May in hopes that his health would improve.

Sylvester was buried in the Prospect Hill Cemetery at Argyle. Mrs. Sylvester, who died November 29 1909 in Argyle, was also buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery. Their son Samuel Sylvester died in Argyle in 1941, unmarried.

Their daughter Emma C. Sylvester had married in 1884 Franklin W. Lawrence, a prosperous businessman of Saratoga Springs. She died January 20, 1936. Mr. Lawrence died March 29, 1939, leaving an estate which included an interest in the mineral water and bank supply business of C.W. Lawrence and Quevic Spring Company.

There are descendants of the Lawrences now living in Saratoga County.

An acquaintance of Sylvesters wrote to the editor of the Troy Press a letter in "tribute" to his deceased friend. The letter, published July 16 1894, confides that "[Sylvesters] heart was never in his profession. His mind was capable of grasping all its principles and of wielding all its bolts; but was so fine and delicately attuned that it instinctively shrank from the clash and contention, the wear and tear. . . . Mr. Sylvester was a dreamer."

In August of 1894, Sarah J. Sylvester petitioned in Saratoga County for administration of the estate of Nathaniel B. Sylvester. She stated in her petition that "the probable value of the personal estate does not exceed $75." This would seem to prove prophetic the statement made by Mr. Sylvester in the preface to his 1878 History of Saratoga County:

"To the writer it has been mostly a labor of pleasure rather than of profit."
