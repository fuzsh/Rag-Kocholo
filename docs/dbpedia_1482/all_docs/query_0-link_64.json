In the 1850 federal census, this couple was enumerated in Middletown, Frederick County, he age 57 and a miller, and she age 59, both born in Maryland. With them was son John, age 14. James, age 30, Mahala and their five children also were in Middletown in 1850, and in their household was Daniel Weddle, age 20, deaf and dumb, likely JamesÂ’ brother. Another brother was likely Jacob Weddle, who, too, was enumerated in Middletown in the 1850 census, age 32. James, Mahala and their family moved to Montgomery County, Ohio around 1858. By 1860, the family was in Brookville, Clay Township in Montgomery County. The Jacob Weddle who was possibly JamesÂ’ brother was close by in Union Township, Miami County, Ohio in 1860. (This Jacob married Mary Ann Tracey 17 August 1844 in Frederick County Maryland.)\n\nAnother brother or other kin of JamesÂ’ was possibly Lawson B.
