Although not proven, he was perhaps the son of John and Christiana/Christine (Parr) Weddle who married 13 January 1817 in Frederick County, Maryland. In the 1850 federal census, this couple was enumerated in Middletown, Frederick County, he age 57 and a miller, and she age 59, both born in Maryland. With them was son John, age 14. James, age 30, Mahala and their five children also were in Middletown in 1850, and in their household was Daniel Weddle, age 20, deaf and dumb, likely James brother. Another brother was likely Jacob Weddle, who, too, was enumerated in Middletown in the 1850 census, age 32. James, Mahala and their family moved to Montgomery County, Ohio around 1858. By 1860, the family was in Brookville, Clay Township in Montgomery County. The Jacob Weddle who was possibly James brother was close by in Union Township, Miami County, Ohio in 1860. (This Jacob married Mary Ann Tracey 17 August 1844 in Frederick County Maryland.)\n\nAnother brother or other kin of James was possibly Lawson B. Weddle, who was living with the Jacob Weddle mentioned above in 1850, age 17, a miller like Jacob. Lawson married Emaline, called Emma, Harshman 24 August 1853 in Frederick County. (James Weddle's wife Mahala Gilbert's mother was named Mary Harshman.) By 1900 Lawson, Emma and family resided in Tiffin, Seneca County, Ohio and remained there through the 1900 census.
