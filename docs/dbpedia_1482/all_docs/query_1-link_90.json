        "text": "Terry Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nThe surname Terry is an primarily English and Irish name derived from the French-Norman personal (first) name Therry or Terry, a masculine given name, derived from the Old French word thierri, composed of the Germanic elements þeudo, meaning race or people, and ric, meaning power. It should be noted that Theodoric the Great (454-526), King of the Ostrogoths, and later King of Italy, is derived from the Greek name Theodoros. It should also be noted an Anglo-Norman family named Terry established itself in Cork, Ireland. In some cases, in Ireland, the last name Terry is an Anglicized form of the Gaelic Mac Toirdhealbhaigh. Lastly, in southern France, the Terry was also found, as an occupational surname for a potter, from the Latin occitan terrin, meaning “earthenware vase”. The book Patronymica Britannica states the following in regard to this family surname: “Not ‘the tearful one’ as some etymologists have it, but a corruption of Theodoric, the personal name, like the French Thierry. In H.R. Terri and Terry are without prefix”. The book A Dictionary of English and Welsh names states the following in regard to the origin and meaning of the last name: “This surname is derived from the name of an ancestor. ‘the son of Theodorie’ (Tedric, Domesday), from the nick. Terry, probably from the French nick. Thierry”.\n\nThe name first established itself in county Kent, England, where Gilbert, Earl of Pembroke, granted lands to Thierry, son of Deorman of London, circa 1142 AD. The Terry family motto is Ex cruce leo, a Latin motto meaning “From the cross a lion”. Spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Tyrry, Terrey, Terre, Terri, Tarry, Torry, Torrie, Thierry, Thery, Thiery, and Terrey.\n\nEarly Bearers of the Terry Surname\n\nThe first known bearers of this surname was Ralph Teri, who was recorded in the Register of the Freemen of the City of Leicester in 1199 AD. Some other early bearers of this last name were John Terry (Warwickshire 1221 AD), Thomas Therry (Somerset 1243 AD), and Hugo Tyry (Bedfordshire 1250 AD). The Hundred Rolls of 1273 AD, a census of Wales and England, known in Latin as Rotuli Hundredorum lists two bearers of this surname: Richard Terry (Huntingdonshire) and Geoffrey Terri (Oxforfshire). The Poll Tax Rolls of Yorkshire in 1379 AD also list two bearers: Johannes Tyrry and Petrus Terre.\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Terry ranks 336th popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census. The name ranks particularly high in the following four states: Alabama (122nd), Utah (123rd), Virginia (220th), and Tennessee (227th).\n\nThe surname Terry frequency/commonness ranks as follows in the British Isles: England (531st), Scotland (2,204th), Wales (778th), Ireland (333rd) and Northern Ireland (4,518th). In England, it ranks highest in counties Kent and West Sussex. In Scotland, the surname ranks highest in East Dunbartonshire. In Ireland, it ranks highest in county Munster. In Wales, it ranks highest in Brigend and Neath Port Talbot.\n\nThe name is also present throughout the remainder English speaking world: Canada (1,552nd), New Zealand (761st), Australia (992nd), and South Africa (3,921st).\n\nIn his 1890 book, Homes of Family Names in Great Britain, Henry Brougham Guppy, states the following in regard to this last name: “The Terrys or Terreys include an old Thanet family of gentry, several of whom were buried in Monckton church in the latter half of the 17th century (H.). In Elizabeth’s time the Terrys held the manors of Bicknor and Swanton Court; and in the same reign there lived a family of yeomen of the name in Herne, and in the time of Charles I. inShoreham. Much property was held by the Terrys in the early part of last century, when there were Terrys or Terreys of Faversham, Brookland, Ospringe, Staplehurst, Trapham, etc. (H.). It was also an old clerical name in the county. The incumbents of Petham in 1664, of St. Mary church, Sandwich, in 1622, and of Goodneston in 1736, were thus named (H.). Terry is a name now also represented in Bucks and the West Riding; and it is remarkable that, as far back as the reign of Edward I., it occurred still in Yorkshire, and also in the counties adjacent to Bucks, namely those of Oxford, Northampton, and Hunts”.\n\nTerry Family Tree & Terry Genealogy\n\nAnthony Terry was born in Kent, England in 1546.
