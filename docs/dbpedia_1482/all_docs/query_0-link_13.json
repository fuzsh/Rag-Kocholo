Gilbert Foots, 351 Park Boulevard, Glen Ellyn, Illinois. ........ «JulyfI949. -'f r\\ .vy* X September, 1948,, •f-eroc&tf I9V2 O & -//- 7 *r 1 if fc-cic / • Gilbert. . iS28937 . The Kamo v/es formerly spelled ^Gilbeart”, ttGuilbert°, ’’Gilbert1'- and means ’’Pledge or Hostage”. It is of French origin, being one of the commonest French names. If, as believed, our family came from England, then our family is of Anglo-roman descent. In France they began the use of Surnames about the year 1000. Wo do not know how this name originated, but it was probably the _ Christian name of one of the early members of the family. Nor do we know when they left France. They may have gone to England with \"William the Conqueror, as vre know some of the name did, or they m.oy have been among the Huguenots who loft France and went to Holland and Ireland, Later research may answer this question. The first Gilbert to corse to America was Sir Humphrey Gilbert, a half brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was also interested in America, Sir Humphrey did not remain in America* but he did make rai effort to return, but was lost in a storm at sea.. His sens, John arid Raleigh, also had interests in America, and Raleigh came to America. However, or> the death of his brother, John, leaving no heirs, Raleigh returned to England to settle the estato and take over the lands. He did not return, but he did have two brothers who were also in America in those early dsys. Bartholomew was killed as a young man while -making his own discoveries, and we, as yet, have no account of what happened to Adrian. The first of the name to be recorded in Virginia after this was in 1635, and there were a number of the name after that date. There w& s also a family in New England of this name, some of them bearing the same Christian names as members of our family, and one in North Carolina, and one in Georgia, at early dates* We find our Samuel Gilbert in Bedford Co?mty, Virginia, in 1758, along with Daniel , Acquiira and Benjamin, and there was a Thomas, an Ensign, whose connection with the family vre do not yet know* it is noted that Samuel, A-cquilla, Daniel and Benjamin were all Sergeants in the Bedford Militia in 1758, and Samuel, Jr, , was also a member (Va ; Col. Militia- by Crozier). We have had quite a search to discover where Samuel was prior to this, but now (1946) we have found him in Baltimore County, Maryland* We had our first know-* ledge of his residence in Baltimore County through receipt of copy of a deed, which is later incorporated in this record, and vrhich shov/s that Samuel and Martha were living in Baltimore County in 1756. The Bedford County records also show a Charles Gilbert residing there. Copies of records which follow show our descent from Gervais Gilbert, of Baltimore County, Maryland. r * • \"* * Family tradition on one branch of our family says wa are descended from Sir Humphrey Gilbert, but research has not verified this. In fact, it has disproved it. However, Sir Humphrey * s line back in the thirteenth century had as its head one Thomas Gilbert, and later generations continued the use of this name, as .well as that of Viilliam, both nam.es in our family, and it may be that we do .tie on somewhere back there. • » Another tradition is that Charles Gilbert was the first of our ancestry- in this country, and that he v^is the father of Gervais (Garvis, Jarvis etc.) and that C'acrles was s cousin of Sir Humphrey. Further research may prove whether this is true. . t Another tradition is that we are descended from one Vniliam Gilbert, a famous scientist of Eng land-” and it was he who figured out magnetism”- and his sou, or grandson, Fergamin, was sent as a political prisoner by King George to Georgia, which was then, in 1733, under the authority of James A.gelthorpe. It was then that the State of Georgia v/as founded as an English ■ 2 penal colony. This story was handed down through the family of Benjamin Gilbert, y-ho did go to Georgia about 1764 from Campbell County (formerly Bedford County.) Virginia. This tradition says that the Benjamin who was sent to Georgia v&s our* Benjamin. The story nay bo true, but not with rsference to our Benjamin Gilbert, as we have now traced him back to Campbell and Bedford Countie s. Vir¬ ginia, and then to Baltimore County, Maryland, at dates which preclude the idea of his being the romantic Benjamin of this story* There was a Gilbert family in Georgia, and also one in North Carolina, at .very early dates, -of whose an¬ cestry we know nothing* Our research in Baltimore County, Maryland, disclosed that in 1695 a grant of land was made to one Thomas Gilbert, who, in 1703, married Hannah Ashford* It is assumed that this was not his first marriage, and, although his vi3 1 does not mention the names of any of his children except Thomas and Michael, it does indicate he had other children* The Genealogist who made this research for us stated it as his belief that Thomas was previously married and that Gervais was one of his children by that marriage* The records which we have seem to indicate a family connection, bat we do not know what this connection is. After the death of Thomas, in 1713, his widow, Hannah. Gilbert, married Thomas Gash* This name. Gash, also appears in those early records of Bedford County* .There was a Michael Gash who married Elizabeth, and they gave their consent to the marriage of their son, Thomas , to Elizabeth Gilbert in 1763 in Bedford County* This Michael must have been the son of Hannah and Thomas Gash. Then, later on, James Gilbert, a son of John Webster Gilbert, and his wife, Rebecca, married Martha Gash, a daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Gil¬ bert Gash* Records in Mercer County, Kentucky, show this relationship. Thomas Gilbert and Gervais may have been brothers, or Thomas may have been an uncle, but we have been unable to find them before they appeared in the Baltimore County records in 1695, and, therefore, we have no proof or verifi¬ cation of .any relationship* They lived in the same community in Maryland, and some of them went to Bedford County, Virginia with the family of Gervais* We have also been informed, by a member of the Hayths family of Campbell County, V; rginia, that Bedford County was settled by people from North Ireland, The Haythe family is connected with the Gilberts through the mar¬ riage of Martha, daughter of Benjamin Gilbert, to Thomas Hayth. The name, it is said, was formerly \"Eeeth* but became \"Haythe\" through the Irish pro¬ nunciation of the former name . The Heaths or Hey the s first went to Northum- - berlond County, Virginia, and then to Bedford County. This leads to the belief that our Gilberts wore di-awn to Bedford County because of its Irish settlement, and if so, our ancestors may have been among the early immi¬ grants from Ireland. We have also secured information about our Webster ancestors which is very interesting* These records were furnished by Mr, Yfe. Marye, of Baltimore, who was employed to make the search, and bring us very close to our immigrant ancestor on both the .Gilbert and Yfebster branches, and when we discover who they were our search must be continued in England. These Baltimore records indicate that the Webster s were Quakers. There is a record which shows that Gervais Gilbert was a vestryman in St. George’s Church, and the Gilbert records which follow, many of them, were taken from the Register of that church. This was the first church in this part of the Province and was called \"Spesutia Church\" built in 1671. It is near the village of Perryman, Harford County, Maryland, end Gervais Gilbert, our ancestor, was a vestrymen 1724-1725. Present St, George’s was built in 1851 at Perryman, and is the third church on this spot, and the fourth one of the parish* The first church was built on 'Vfalston’ s Addition near Delf Creek, in what is now Harford County.
