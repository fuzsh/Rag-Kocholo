        "text": "Neal\n\nI haven't verified all I'm about to state.It's \"the party line\" as per the collected wisdom of those researching this line:\n\nHenry Calphy Gilbert and Jilson Olen Gilbert were probably brothers and probably the sons of Thomas Gilbert who migrated to Alabama from Spartanburg S.C. in the early 1820's.If the relationships above are incorrect, they are still closely related as all the Gilberts migrating into that section of N.E. Alabama circa 1820's and 30's were Spartanburg S.C. Gilberts and from the lineage of Daniel Gilbert Sr.Both Henry and Jilson were born within a few years of 1800.\n\nAllegedly, Jilson Gilbert married Elizabeth Ellison ,6 Apr 1822,in Ashville, St Clair County AL and later remarried to a Susan Gore. Henry Calphy Gilbert allegedly married Rhoda Littlefield, daughter of William Littlefield II and Hannah Bryant, in Spartanburg County SC c. 1815.\n\nFor perspective, my G3 GP's were George Gilbert and Nancy Littlefield.George is thought to have been the older brother of Henry Calphy Gilbert and Jilson Olen Gilbert, but may have been their first cousin.Nancy Littlefield Gilbert is believed to have been the sister of Henry Gilbert's wife, Rhoda Littlefield.George and Nancy Littlefield Gilbert moved to Cherokee Co. Ala (adjoins St. Clair) by 1837.\n\nHenry Calphy Gilbert's 1850 St Clair County AL household (census page 156, family #256) shows a 3 year old Gilson Gilbert born Ala.Researchers claim this Gilson was a son of Jilson Olen Gilbert.Henry's wife, Rhoda Littlefield died in Ala. in 1852 and Henry subsequently remarried and moved to Bradley Co. Ark. (not sure which came first).Henry's 1860 Bradley County AR household (census page 477, family #156) shows a 13 year old Gilson Gilbert born Ala.In each census, it was spelled Gilson with a G.\n\nI show the following which must be for this young Gilson Gilbert of Bradley Co. Ark:\n\n\"Civil War record provided by Jonathan N. Johnson : microfilm Roll 36 of NARA film M399 (lookup provided by Edward G. Gerdes - [email protected]): GILBERT, JILSON Pvt Co G, 4th AR Cav (US) was born at St Clair County AL, Age 18, ht 5' 7\", eyes blue, hair lt, complx fair. He enlisted 6 Feb 1864 at Pine Bluff, AR and was mustered into service 24 Feb 1864. He died of chronic diarrhea at the General Hospital at Little Rock AR 27 Jul 1864.\"\n\nIf the Jilson Gilbert who died in 1864 was the same Jilson in Henry Calphy Gilberts house in 1850 and 1860, (which appears indisputable)he could not be the J. Gilbert in 1870 Parker Co. Texas.\n\nThe elder Jilson Gilbert's 1850 St Clair County AL household shows:\n\nGilbert, Jilson 49m, SC\n\nSusannah 38f, SC\n\nSylvester 21m, AL\n\nJames M 19m, AL\n\nJasper 17m, AL (Lemuel)\n\nCansada 15f, AL\n\nEmily 13f, AL\n\nAlmoth 11m, AL\n\nThomas 09m, AL\n\nAaron T 07m, AL (Ben)\n\nLorenda 01f, AL (dau by Susannah)\n\nJilson and his second wife, Susan Gore, apparently had another child, William, after the census.Jilson O Gilbert (Sr) died 1 Jul 1852 and was buried at the Old Harmony Baptist Church cemetery in St Clair County AL. Susan Gore Gilbert's brother became guardian of her two children (Lorenda) by Jilson.\n\nOn 3 May 1859 in St Clair County Ala., Thomas W. Gilbert (believed brother of Henry C. and Jilson O.) was made \"guardian of Alemeth Gilbert, Thomas Gilbert, Orren Gilbert, and Jilson Gilbert minor heirs of the estate of Jilson Gilbert deceased...\".Was this document the reason researchers believed the 3 year old Gilson Gilbert in Henry C. Gilbert's 1850 house was really the son of Jilson O. Gilbert?There was no son Jilson listed in Jilson O. Gilbert's 1850 house.\n\nFollowing his 1852 death, Jilson Gilbertâ€™s surviving wife, Susan Gore, moved to Texas with her children. She allegedly died 13 Jul 1881 and is buried at Soda Springs Cemetery, Parker County, Texas.\n\nI'm not descended from Jilson O. or Henry C. Gilbert.But I'm having difficulty accepting that Henry would be housing Jilson's 3 year old son in 1850, when Jilson had 9 other children in his household ranging in age between 1 and 21.If it had been an older child it would have been understandable, but you wouldn't farm out a 3 year old when you were capable of housing him.\n\nCould it be that both Henry and Jilson O named sons Jilson?Could it be that Jilson O's son Jilson was either inadvertantly omitted or misnamed in the 1850 census?"
