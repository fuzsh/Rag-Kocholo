        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – March 21, 2023\n\nARLINGTON, Va. – The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) will name U.S. Army CW4 Clavis \"Carl\" Gilbert Military Mentor of the Year at the TAPS Honor Guard Gala on Wednesday, March 22, 2023. Presented annually since 2016, the TAPS Military Mentor of the Year Award recognizes outstanding support for the children of America's fallen heroes.\n\nOne of more than 700 TAPS Military Mentors who dedicated 32,566 hours in 2022, Gilbert is committed to bringing comfort and companionship to children and teens grieving the death of a loved one who served in the U.S. military.\n\nGilbert came to TAPS following the loss of his colleague who served as a TAPS Military Mentor. “TAPS has given me the tools I needed to help me understand grief as a result of the losses I’ve experienced in my own life. Mentoring has given me a sense of peace and patience in dealing with others from all walks of life, and [it] has ultimately made me a better leader and a better father by learning to meet people where they are.” In response to his upcoming recognition, Gilbert shares, “It is an honor…I always remember the Soldier’s Creed; we’ll never leave a fallen soldier behind. We won’t leave the family behind either.”\n\nIn the last year, Gilbert supported surviving children and teens at TAPS Good Grief Camps and TAPS Family Camps. Gilbert shares his dedication to the TAPS mission with his son and recent West Point graduate, 2LT Clavis Gilbert II, who is also a TAPS Military Mentor, and his daughter, Makayla, who volunteers with TAPS.\n\n“You can tell from the second Carl walks into a room full of TAPS kids that his heart is in this,” said Bonnie Carroll, TAPS President and Founder. “He honors the lives of those lost by providing care and a safe space for their children. His heart for our mission inspires us all.”\n\nGilbert, who currently serves as a program manager at the U.S. Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, will accept his award from his TAPS mentees, Andrew and Jacob Sylvester, the surviving sons of SGT Jason Andrew Sylvester, U.S. Army, during the annual TAPS Honor Guard Gala at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. the evening of March 22, 2023.\n\nAdditional TAPS Military Mentor information is available at: taps.org/militarymentor, and TAPS Military Mentor of the Year Award information can be found at: taps.org/gala/militarymentoraward.\n\nTAPS Honor Guard Gala Sponsors include:\n\nTitle Sponsor: USAA\n\nPresenting Sponsors: Oshkosh Defense, Pratt & Whitney, Prudential, Battelle\n\nAdditional event information can be found at: taps.org/gala.\n\nDownload Press Release PDF\n\n###\n\nABOUT TAPS"
