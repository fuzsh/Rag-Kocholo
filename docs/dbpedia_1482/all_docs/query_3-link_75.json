        "text": "The Trail\n\nBen is out for his usual morning jog when he comes upon the body of young Tom Murphy. After the news begins to spread throughout town, Detective Cornell, who's been assigned to the case, pays Ben a visit for routine questioning. In the blink of an eye, Ben quickly turns from Good Samaritan to murder suspect.\n\nThe Father\n\nBen decides to take matters into his own hands by investigating those that were closest to Tom after receiving shocking information about the case from Detective Cornell. Jess, Tom's mother, propels Ben in the direction of her estranged husband, Scott, who she believes may be his killer.\n\nThe Affair\n\nAs the holidays approach, Ben Crawford tries in vain to keep his family together after a shameful public revelation that makes him look even more guilty. While under scrutiny from the entire neighborhood, Ben makes a startling discovery about a piece of evidence that could be used to implicate him in Tom's murder. Ben's life continues to unravel when another personal bombshell rocks the Crawford household.\n\nThe Jacket\n\nWhile attempting to help his neighbor's autistic son Matt Daly, Ben stumbles upon a crucial piece of evidence related to Tom's murder. This leads Ben to suspect the Daly family of wrongdoing and confront them regarding their involvement in the death of Tom. In doing so, yet even more secrets and lies are revealed on Chelsea Bay Drive.\n\nThe Cop\n\nBen visits a prison inmate who provides information that might prove Detective Cornell is pushing the boundaries of the law. With the \"help\" of Arthur Fenton, Ben attempts to bring Cornell down, but an anonymous tip puts the spotlight back on Ben as the prime suspect, and the Crawford family finally collapses under the strain."
