        "text": "THE CASE OF THE MISSING ANCESTORS\n\nWHO WAS GILBERT HOUSTON?\n\nAccording to family history Gilbert Houston was my G. G. Grandfather and there is really no question about that. But the lingering question is; just who was Gilbert Houston? Besides being my G. G. Grandfather, where did he come from and where are his parents? Who are our ancestors?\n\nIn shared family history there is very little information about Gilbert Houston and Fanny Butterfield and search as I may I could not find a Gilbert Houston that fit what family history I had. Then one lucky search while looking for Fanny Butterfield, (who would become my G. G. Grandmother) I found a marriage license had been issued to Gilbert Houston and Fanny Butterfield Nov 15, 1832 in Clark County, Illinois. History confirmed - Gilbert Houston married Fanny Butterfield, as stated in my family history, on or about Nov 15, 1832.\n\nSo when and where was Gilbert born? Some of my history says he was born in 1792 in Williamson County, Illinois but the problem is, in 1792 there was no Williamson County in Illinois. Williamson County, IL was formed on February 28, 1839. Now, birth place and date unconfirmed.\n\nBut the family history says Gilbert had siblings. One sister, Jane Houston was born in IL, married Richard Kesterson and they had 2 children. She died in OR.\n\nAnother sister, Margaret Houston, was born in 1822 in Indiana. In 1842 in IL she married Matthew Clay Green who was born August 7 1820 in AL. Margaret and Matthew had children, they were; Mary Jane born 12 Oct. 1846 died 14 July 1914 she married Abraham Cogdill 21 Sept. 1864 who was born 20 June 1842 and died 17 Nov 1924. Henry (Gilbert), Sarah Charlotte and Hula were the other children.\n\nBecause there is thirty years between the date I had for Gilberts birth, 1792, and Margarets birth I believe it is more realistic to assume Gilberts birth year is closer to Fanny Butterfields which my history says was 1812. Also his siblings birth dates were in the 1820s.\n\nTHE FAMILY OF GILBERT AND FANNY HOUSTON 1832  1855\n\nTheir Family:\n\n(1.)

G. Grandfather was born GILBERT HUSTED in 1815 making his age 17 in 1832 the year he married. Fanny Butterfield would have been age 20.\n\nA possible scenario could have been that Gilberts parents objected to him marrying Fanny, therefore, Gilbert and Fanny ran away. When filing for a marriage license Gilbert used the name Houston rather than Husted possibly to hide his real identity? He may have had to lie about his age as well.\n\nEventually the Sylvester Houston family would have figured out their ancestors last name was not spelled H-o-u-s-t-o-n; because of all the time Sylvester spent with his father Gilberts sister, Jane Kesterson, who would have known their born as name was Husted not Houston.\n\nI believe Sylvester was trying to correct family history when he changed the name. He knew H-O-U-S-T-O-N was not correct and it appears H-U-S-T-O-N and H-U-S-T-E-D were commonly confused one for the other so possibly he thought H-U-S-T-O-N was correct. Misspelling of names was a common error and I dont think people then thought it to be that important an issue.\n\nAlthough another scenario could be that these ancestors never referred to themselves as H-O-U-S-TO-N and that only modern day families assumed the name change was from Houston to Huston but the truth is when G. Grandfather Sylvester changed the name he changed it from H-U-S-T-E-D to H-U-S-T-O-N.\n\nOf course this is just my opinion but circumstances weight it very heavily in my favor.\n\nEven if I am correct it changes nothing about whom we are and who we have been it just means we can search in a different direction to find family members who arent aware they are related to a family as wonderful as ours. We are all still the descendants of great American pioneering men and women, we are descendants of Sylvester and Harriet and Alonzo and Lena and we are the HUSTON FAMILY.\n\nBill Wink December 20, 2016\n\nTHE LINEAGE\n\nYE HISTORIE OF YE TOWN OF GREENWICH By Spencer P.
