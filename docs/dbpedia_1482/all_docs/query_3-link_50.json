        "text": "Lucius “Louie” Sylvester Kyyitan, 76, of Bapchule, died peacefully on July 4, 2024, in Gilbert, AZ. Mr. Kyyitan was born in Sacaton, AZ, on June 28, 1948, to George and Dorothy (Lewis) Kyyitan. He was a proud US Army 82nd Airborne Veteran and served his country in the Vietnam War.\n\nLucius, known to many as Louie, dedicated a significant part of his life to serving his community. His leadership roles, including as District 5 Council Representative, Office of Water Rights Director, and parish leader at St. Peter Indian Mission, were a testament to his selflessness. Even during his tenure as a council representative, he found time to drive the school bus, showing his unwavering commitment to his community.\n\nMr. Kyyitan was among the youngest elected Gila River Council Representatives, serving his first term at 25. During his tenure as an elected official, he was a staunch supporter of the community’s economic development endeavors – his vision, in collaboration with many former GRIC leaders, came to life through the Sun Valley Marina/Firebird International Raceway, Lone Butte Industrial Park, and Wild Horse Pass Development. In addition, he was a member of the historic Gila River Water Rights negotiating team.\n\nLouie was an avid sports fan—the ASU Sun Devils were at the top of his list—and he wholeheartedly supported his children, as well as many nephews and nieces, in their chosen sports. He was known to attend many games to cheer them on.\n\nOn June 21, 1997, Lucius married Gloria Jackson. Their union was a testament to their love and commitment, which was separated by death just ten days apart. During their life together, they enjoyed traveling, serving their church parish, and most importantly, spending time with their family, especially their beloved grandchildren.\n\nSurvivors include three daughters and one son, Joni Kyyitan, Teresa Grant, Omar Rivera, and Rosie Rivera; four siblings, Edmund, Gerald and Flores Kyyitan, and Angelita White; 16 grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, sons Ryan and Cody, and four siblings, Bernice Brown, Sylvester, Lawrence, and Delmar Kyyitan.\n\nMr. Kyyitan was laid to rest at St. Peter’s Catholic Cemetery with full military honors on July 16, 2024."
