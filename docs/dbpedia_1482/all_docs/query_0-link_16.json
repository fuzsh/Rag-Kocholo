        "text": "1066 Info 5 for Norman Origins\n\nThe life of Gilbert de Venables in Cheshire - an alternative\n\nA modern interpretation\n\nExactly who fought at Hastings has been the interest of many academics for centuries. Many Anglo-Norman families have claimed descent from an ancestor who supposedly fought at the great battle but few can show proof of this. Beyond the trifling 20-40 identified, depending on which source, the participants will remain unknown forever. However, the chroniclers insist that there was a wide ranging recruitment of auxiliary troops, the clear importance of ducal loyalty and Norman government as well as those Normans who migrated from the original base. (Keats-Rohan, 1999 p.9)\n\nThe Foundation of Medieval Genealogy acknowledges the fifteen commanders named by William of Poitiers (circa 1073-1074) who fought at Hastings and another five possible names from those identified by Odericus Vitalis Angligena. [This source can no longer be traced.]\n\nIn addition to the commentary of Master Robert Wace, the medieval poet-chronicler of Le roman de Rou, written in 1160, There are three lists of those who allegedly fought at Hastings: The Battle Abbey Roll, The Dives Roll; and The Falaise Rolls.\n\nIn this information, there is much on-going debate to reliability and validity of the evidence of who actually fought with William, who provided materials and men, who remained in Normandy maintaining the peace and who ventured to England after the Conquest. Keats-Rohan argues that the Chronicles were concerned, apparently, with auxiliary troops, composed of well-born and led by nobles, rather than mercenaries. (Keats-Rohan, 1999 p.30) Though named on all three Rolls, there is no written evidence that Gilbert de Venables came with the Conqueror.\n\nThe Battle Abbey Rolls\n\n1066info 5, sheet 2\n\nThe Dives Roll\n\nWilliamâs gathered his invasion fleet at Dives-sur-Mer.\n\n1066info5, sheet 3\n\nThe Falaise Roll\n\nThe French Government, in 1931, produced the \"Falaise Roll\" whose list shows considerable differences again.\n\nThere are about eight versions of the Roll in addition to the version accepted by the French Government. This lists 315 men whose names were engraved on the bronze tablet erected, on 21 June 1931 in the Chapel of Duke Williamâs castle at Falaise. Its probable source was Waceâs Le roman de Rou and the Battle Abbey Rolls.\n\nFalaise Town Hall, downhill from the castle, now houses The Falaise Roll. The chief archaeologist at the castle is sceptical about its completeness and suggests the wall mural over the main entrance to Dives-sur-Mer church may be more correct.\n\nLe roman de Rou [The romance of Rollo]\n\nWritten 100 years after the battle, the work of the poet-chronicler Master Robert Wace, a Jerseyman who studied in Paris and Caen and later became âclerc lisantâ in Caen itself, has long been disputed and his reputation virtually demolished. In 2005 Dr Elisabeth van Houts argued that some of the names, in the rhyming poem, could be identified in Normandy and linked to men who settled in England after the Conquest.\n\nWritten in a time of a changed political situation it is thought that Master Wace may have written his chronicle to celebrate Normandyâs former greatness and, it is now believed to honour neglected local heroes from his home region of western Normandy. van Houts argues that Master Wace, in his home of Caen, didnât know of the existence of the Domesday Book or other English works when he talked to the descendants of more than 100 Hastings veterans and recorded the oral history. But, if he was unsure about individual claims he could have had them confirmed from the then contemporary financial and church records in Caen, and other documents of Williamâs court, now long since lost.\n\nMaster Wace mentions 116 individuals, surnamed by their toponym (place of abode), because, as he wrote, âI do not know the names of all the men from Normandy and Brittanyâ. He refers to three types of people:\n\nseventeen participants mentioned by first name and surname, with long accounts of their actions;\n\ntwenty two participants mentioned by first name and surname, with no accounts of their actions; and\n\nseventy seven names indicated as lords of such-and-such.\n\nMost of the names in category 1 and 2 can be identified and the likelihood of them taking part in the Battle of Hastings is very great indeed. (van Houts 1997, p.112)\n\nIdentifying individuals by their toponym in English post-conquest documents is almost impossible because formal family names were not adopted until in the reign of Henry II. By comparing the names on late 11th century and early 12th century Norman charters with those in Domesday and other English records van Houts found evidence of the continuation of the family name of new knights and minor barons in the districts of Caen and Bayeux and England of Domesday. Several names were also found from the generation that would have fought at Hastings. Near-contemporary English documents link names such as Bohun and Averenchis [sic] [Hugh dâAvranches, Earl of Chester] with Normandy.\n\nIt can be argued that, if the Battle Abbey Roll was based on Le Roman de Rou then van Houtsâ research authenticates some of the names. Although Wace mentions âthe good citizens of Rouenâ and eight people from Eure, the absence of Gilbertâs name from Master Waceâs list is perhaps due to the geographical location of Venables, in High Normandy.\n\nReturn to marker\n\nWilliam of Poitiers\n\nWilliam of Poitiers was a Norman born in PrÃ©aux (Department of Eure). Between 1050 and 1077 he was sometime Archdeacon of Lisieux. Though not present at Hastings, he crossed the Channel sometime after the invasion.\n\nHis book, Gesta Guillelmi Ducis Normannorum et Regis Anglorum [The History of William, Duke of the Normans and King of the English] was written circa 1073â1074 when he was chaplain to King William. It is possible that King Williamâs oral history was his source. The Gesta is by far the most complete account of the invasion written in the eleventh century. It existed only as a copy, published in1619, but this is now lost.\n\n1066info5, sheet 4\n\nIn the translation by Thorne, William names twelve who fought in the battle, and adds that there were âa great number of other most famous fighting men whose names should be recorded in history books for their war like deedsâ. [Translated by Thorne] Thorne lists another three names, identified on the Bayeux Tapestry, making the fifteen accepted by the Foundation of Medieval Genealogy.\n\nOdericus Vitalis\n\nOdericus Vitalis was born near Shrewsbury c.1075, the eldest son of an English woman married to Oderlerius, the Norman confessor and advisor of Roger of Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury. He spent most of his life as a monk in the monastery of Saint Evroult near Lisieux in Calvados.\n\nHis Historia Ecclesiastica, written 70 years after the event, is composed of thirteen books written between 1123 and 1141. It is said to names an additional five men who fought at Hastings. Hostile to Hugh dâAvranches (Odericus Vitalis ii 260-2), questioning of William\n\nI dare not commend him for an act which levelled both the bad and the good in one common ruin by a consuming famine...I assert, moreover, that such barbarous homicide should not pass unpunished.\n\nand sympathetic to Harold. He was still putting the final touches to the story of the Norman master race when the death of Henry I brought to an end the male line which could be traced back to 911AD.\n\nHe records that âMen from Anjou, Brittany and Maine were still serving in January 1070, complaining bitterly and asking to be dischargedâ, (Odericus Vitalis ii 234) having presumably taken part in the Harrying. According to the Hastings battle plan Gilbert, a pure Norman, would not have been part of these âauxiliaryâ troops.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt can be argued that these sources include four types of persons:\n\nThose twenty real people who were generally agreed to have been present at the Battle of Hastings.\n\nReal people who may well have been at the Battle of Hastings, but for whom it is not possible to produce evidence to show this.\n\nReal people not at the Battle of Hastings.\n\nFictitious characters.\n\nThe difficulty is that although category 1 has been well defined by earlier work and category 4 can usually be found out by research, it is not possible to distinguish those in categories 2 and 3.\n\nThough Gilbert de Venables appears on the three Rolls neither he nor his tenant-in-chief, Earl Hugh dâAvranches, have been positively identified as having fought at Hastings. Gilbert may have:\n\nfought at Hastings;\n\nfought at Hastings under Hugh dâAvranches as part of his feudal obligation to his pre-1066 tenant-in-chief;\n\nfought at Hastings under Hugh dâAvranches so achieving a high status tenancy in Hughâs Palatine.\n\nOr, as an opportunist âyoungest sonâ who, on hearing of England's potential, sought a better parcel of land than his Venables fiefdom. He may have arrived in England as reinforcements for the âHarrying of the Northâ and the maintenance of Williamâs post 1069 peace because:\n\nthere appear to be no pre-1066 close honorial relationship between the Gilbert the Norman tenant and Hugh his tenant-in-chief (Keats-Rohan, 1999 p.10);\n\ngeographically Avranches, in the Manche department of Low Normandy and Venables in the Eure department of High Normandy are at the extremes of modern Normandy so it is unlikely that Gilbert, was a pre-1066 tenant of Hugh and fought under him;\n\nGilbert may have come to Hughâs attention during the âHarryingâ and achieved status because of his deeds.\n\nWe know of Gilbert circa 1050/66 from the Caen records and of Gilbert in the great survey of 1087. Whilst he appears on the three Rolls neither he nor his Earl, Hugh dâAvranches, have been positively identified as having fought at Hastings. Gilbert may have arrived in England, to enhance his fortunes, at the time of Hastings or he may have arrived as reinforcements for the âHarrying of the Northâ and the maintenance of Williamâs post 1069 peace. We will never know of his life between those dates.\n\n1066info5, sheet 5\n\nSources:\n\nFull Battle Abbey Roll, with Gilbert's name (Accessed: 13 March 2020)\n\nFallen, Valentine, âCrossing with the Conquerorâ, Ancestors number 37, May 2005 as an abstract of van Houts, Dr Elisabeth, âThe History of the Norman People by Master Wace (Roman de Rou)â, Boydell Press, 2004\n\nKeats-Rohan, Katherine SB, âDomesday People, a prosopography of persons occurring in English documents 1066-1166 , Vol.1 Domesday Bookâ, The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1999\n\nMidgley Tim, âThe Battle Abbey Roll Timekeeperâ (Accessed 13 March 2020)\n\nMidgley Tim, 'The Companions of William Duke of Normandy, 1066â (Accessed 13 March 2020)\n\nOderic's translations are available at Fordham University (Accessed 13 March 2020)\n\nOderic's translations are available at 1066.co.nz see /library/extracts (Accessed 13 March 2020)\n\nThorne Lewis, âThe Bayeux Tapestry and the Norman Invasionâ, Folio Society, London, 1973\n\nvan Houts, E., 'Wace as Historian', in Keats-Rohan, KSB (Ed), 'Family Trees and the Roots of Politics The prosopography of Britain and France Tenth Century to Twelfth Century', Boydell Press, Woodbridge, 1997\n\nWace, 'roman de Rou ââ see Chapters 22 and 23, Translated by Taylor Edgar, William Pickering, London 1837\n\nWhat may have happened\n\nGilbert, being a minor son and having the small estate of Venables, may have jumped at the opportunity for fame and the fortune of an improved estate. He may have gained his Cheshire lands in one of the following ways:\n\nGilbert fought at Hastings and received his Cheshire manorial lands in 1066. This is doubtful because Earl Edwin administered Cheshire until the rebellion of the Earls in 1070.\n\nGilbert fought at Hastings but wasnât rewarded with any land until he had taken part in the Harrying of the North. However, would Gilbert have waited four years for his rewards? If he had been at Hastings then he would have expected manors in Norman controlled southern England.\n\nGilbert didnât fight at Hastings but came to England at sometime after October 1066 and before the Saxon rebellion of 1069-70. For his part in the Harrying of the North and maintaining the peace it is possible that, as an important tenant of Hugh, he received his eighteen manors from the deposed Wulfgeat, when Hugh gained Chester.\n\nGilbert arrived in the north with Hugh d'Avranches, when he became Earl in 1070.\n\nGilbert fought at Hastings and received the manor of Fifehead Magdalen, in Dorset, as a reward. [VCH Cheshire, page 311 says that it is possible Gilbert held this manor for Count Hugh, but it cannot be proved. However, this Gilbert has no 'surname' or name related to place of abode.]\n\n'Fifehide Magdalen is a little village situated a mile north from Marmhull. It is a well inclosed parish, upon the western banks of the Stour, between the river and the parish of Stalbridge. The village is beautifully situated upon the summit of the hill which rises with a gradual ascent from the banks of the Stour. It is called Fifehide from the five hides of land it contained, and received the addition name Magdalen from the saint to whom its church is dedicated. In Domesday Book this place is survey amongst the lands of Earl Hugh.' (Hutchins 1861, p.56)\n\n'Hugh de Abrincis [sic], son of William the Conqueror's sister, came to England, and was created Earl of Chester A.D.1070. Amongst the vast possessions given to him was this manner and nine more in the county. Ranulph, surnamed de Gernons, his descendant, gave this manor, and the churches of St. Leonard, St. Nicholas and Allhallows, in Bristol, to the canons of St. Augustine there.' (Hutchins 1861 p.56) However, Fifehead may have been given to St. Augustine's by Robert son of Harding, who survived the Conquest, and the grandson of Eadnorth (Alnoth) the staller. (VCH Dorset p.57)\n\n1066info5, sheet 6\n\n1066info5, sheet 7\n\nAn analysis of Earl Hugh's Dorset Domesday lands (After Derby, 1962)\n\nOf Earl Hugh's Dorset lands Gilbert was tenant of one manor and William the remaining ten. But Gilbert, the first named tenant, assumes a degree of importance and a closeness to Earl Hugh.\n\n1 Of considerable importance are the three manors called Fifehead, the modern Fifehead Magdalen, Fifehead Neville, and Fifehead St Quintin, each assessed, not surprisingly, at five hides. (VCH Dorset p.50)\n\n2 Probably William Malbeenc (Malbank) who appears in the Geld Roll for Beaminster Hundred as part of Catsley. It is reasonable to assume William Malbank held the other manors of Earl Hugh. (VCH Dorset p.50) Domesday records Willelmus Malbanc as holding Earl Hugh's manors of Wepre County Flint, Wincho in Cheshire (Natwich) and Witebiam (Whitby) in Yorkshire. Willelmus Malbanc and Gilleburtus de Venables co-signed both the Foundation Charter for St Werburgh's Abbey and the Great Charter of Ranulf II that confirmed the original Charter. (Barraclough, 1988)\n\n3 If the manors of South Perrott and Catesly were to be returned to the church on Alnoth's death then either Alnoth survived Hastings and was alive in 1087 or Domesday recorded an historical fact that the conquerors had chosen to ignore.\n\nA comparison of the Dorset and Cheshire manors suggest that the Dorset manors appear to be wealthier than Gilbert's northern manors and that the single manor of Fifehead was by far the most valuable and substantial manor in Dorset.\n\n1066info5, sheet 8\n\nThe assets of Fifehead Magdalen suggest that Hugh dâAvranches had entrusted a prime manor to Gilbert de Fifehead.\n\nIt was one of 103 manors, out of 515, valued at five hides and should be considered important. Only fourteen Dorset manors were assessed at over 20 hides. (VCH Dorset)\n\nIts value was only 14s less than the whole of Gilbert's Cheshire manors.\n\nThe manor, which had been in production from 1066 to 1086, was acquired as a working Saxon manor and had not been 'wasted'.\n\nThe five ploughs needed equalled the ploughable area, suggesting that all the land was in cultivation. On the Dorset chalk uplands the density of plough teams was about two per square mile. In Domesday Dorset 46% of the manors were 'understocked' with plough teams and 8% had an excess. The value of the 'understocked' manors had generally decrease by the time of Domesday. (Darby, 1967)\n\nAt 22s 6d the two Fifehead Magdalen's mills were a valuable asset that contributed more than five times the value of the two Cheshire mills, suggesting a more intense farming of cereals. The other eight mills on the upper Stour rendered, n total, 27s 2d. (Alecto, 1991 Table 3) Generally the Dorset mills had a value of 5s, 7s 6d, 10s and 12s 6d and some as little as 20d. (Darby, 1967 p.114) Of the 272 Dorset Domesday mills, all of Saxon origin, 34 were of the Kings demesne and the remaining 238 were held by 178 manors. Forty-three manors held between two and four mills. (Stanier 2000, p.11)\n\nIn Domesday Dorset, meadows dominated the Stour valley in villages along steams that broke the chalk surface. Individual amounts were often over 25 acres and sometimes well over (Darby, 1967) The 30 acres of Fifehead meadow supported a population (14) second only to Brereton in Cheshire.\n\nOn the chalk uplands the density of Domesday population was 8 per square mile. This and the relationship with plough teams reflected something of the distribution of wealth and prosperity in the County. (Darby, 1967)\n\nThe possession of a southern manor usually suggested that the previous owner, Alnoth, had either been killed at Hastings or dispossessed for being involved in the defence of Saxon England. This suggests that Gilbert de Fifehead fought at Hastings and was rewarded shortly after.\n\nThough one can never be certain, the evidence linking Gilbert de Fifehead to Gilbert de Venables is dependant on:\n\nthe continued association with Hugh d'Avranches, his liege lord;\n\nGilbert de Fifehead being given Hugh's best Dorset manor and was therefore an important prime tenant;\n\nthis prominence being matched to his high status in Hugh's Cheshire court; and\n\nthe probable link manorial between William and William Malbeenc in Dorset and Willelmus Malbanc who was also a Cheshire tenant of Earl Hugh.\n\nHowever, the Fifehead manor did not pass to the Venables of Kinderton.\n\nIf, as Hutchins (q.v.) suggests, Earl Hugh passed his Fifehead manor to 'Ranulph, surnamed de Gernons, [and] his descendant', after Domesday then Gilbert of Fifehead was without land, which would seem unusual for some one who had owned an important and valuable manor.\n\nIf Gilbert of Fifehead was Gilbert de Venables then his tenant-in-chief granted additional lands, after taking part in the Harrying of the North (q.v.).\n\nIf the Gilberts are one of the same, Hugh may have dispossessed Gilbert in favour of his relation. If this was the case Gilbert de Venables would not have had such a prominent position in the Cheshire court?\n\nGilbert may have relinquished the Fifehead manor as a form of political speculation that would enhance his familyâs future stature and wealth in these frontier lands - a scenario paralleled in the 19th century American west.\n\nIf the manors of South Perrott and Catesly were to be returned to the church on Alnoth's death:\n\nAlnoth survived Hastings and was alive in 1087; or\n\nDomesday recorded an historical fact that the conquerors had chosen to ignore.\n\nI would like to believe that Gilbert de Fifehead and Gilbert de Venables is the same person.\n\nOdericus Vitalis, in Historia Ecclesiastica suggest that whilst some Normans found themselves endowed with lands and riches beyond their wildest dreams, others complained that they had been given âbarren farms, and domains depopulated by warâ. Gilbert, judging by the Domesday values of his Cheshire estates, fell in to the latter category. However, the manor of Fifehead Magdalen alone returns only 14s less than all his Cheshire manors and was therefore rich lands, perhaps richer than his Normandy Venables.\n\n1066info5, sheet 9\n\nI would like to believe that Gilbert of Fifehead was suitably rewarded for fighting at Hastings with the high status manor of Fifehead Magdalen, so establishing his high status allegiance to Earl Hugh. After taking a prominent part in Earl Hugh's Harrying of the North he was rewarded with his Cheshire manors and high position in the Cheshire court, where Domesday recognised him as Gilbert de Venables.\n\nFifehead Magdalen today\n\nGilbert would have been at home in his first English manor. Though Venables is a larger settlement than Fifehead the visiting Venablois would recognise:\n\nthe familiar geographical location - a settlement build on a spur over looking the Rivers Seine and Stour;\n\nthe linear developments along roads climbing out of the valley and traversing the spur;\n\nexpensive period houses at the heart of the village;\n\na church at one end of the village; and\n\na farming community.\n\nIndex to photographs of Fifehead Magdalen, taken February 2007\n\nThe black numbers indicate the location of the image.\n\nThe blue arrows show the angle of the shot.\n\nClick on the red links to open a 650x490 jpg images of the village.\n\nSources: (Researched on the 940th anniversary of Hastings.)\n\nBarraclough Prof. G, 'Charters of the Anglo-Norman Earls of Chester c.1071- 1237', The Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, 1988\n\nDarby HC and Maxwell IS, 'The Domesday Geography of Northern England', Cambridge University Press, 1962\n\nDarby HC and Welldon Finn R, 'The Domesday Geography of South-west England' , Cambridge University Press, 1967\n\n'The Dorset Domesday', Alecto Historical Edition, London, 1991\n\nHutchins John, 'The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset Vol.IV, Nichols, Westminster, 1861-74\n\nPugh RB, 'Victoria History of the County of Dorset, Vol.III', University of London Institute of Historical Research, OUP, 1968\n\nStanier Peter, 'Discover Dorset Mills', The Dovecote Press, Wimborne, 2000\n\n1066info5, sheet 10\n\nDid the first Gilbert live in Kinderton, as has been suggested?\n\nThe Venables are now known as the Barons of Kinderton. From at least the middle of the 13th century until the death of Peter Venable, last of the male line, in the late 17 th century Kinderton was their main residence. However, whilst Kinderton was amongst Gilbert's holdings, it is likely that he settled in Eccleston for a number of reason:\n\nIn 1071 Eccleston was 'waste' but in 1086 had been improved and worth 50s. Kinderton, 'waste' in 1071, was worth 10s in 1086.\n\nEccleston was one of only three 5-hide units in Cheshire. This places its importance just below Chester and Halton (10-hides), even though Eccleston value had risen from 10s to 50s in 1086, there were only two plough-teams for the six units of plough-lands. (Darby, 1962)\n\nThe Ordnance Survey map shows an insignificant âmoundâ, located at grid reference SJ 414; 428, at the north-eastern end of the village over looking the River Dee. Today the âmoundâ, though distinct, has the appearance of a bramble bank rising out of the undulating grassland. Trees, slightly more than sapling, grow from the rive side. A view from the top still commands the outlook to the bypass and out into England, but not over the western ridge. The mound was re-scheduled and classified as a motte. It is documented as:\n\nâBelow the church, in one of the glebe fields, was formerly a Tumulus (adjoining a bath), the site of which is now planted with trees. It stood on the Roman road which ran from Chester to the Iron Bridge over the Dee. The tumulus was opened by the rev. Charles Mytton, then rector, about half a century ago, and a great quantity of human bones and, some say, coins were discovered.â (Ormerod 1882) However, this single âmoundâ is certainly not the size of a motte neither does it have the skyline location of a tumuli cluster.\n\nA âround earthen mound; diameter 20m height 3m. Many human bones and, according to some, coins found in late 18th century.

Ormerod records that the tumulus stood on the Roman road which ran from Chester to the Iron Bridge over the Dee. It was opened âabout half a century ago (c.1830) and a great quantity of human bones and some say coins were discoveredâ. â¦ [The} site consists of an oval earthen mound, mutilated on east side and partly surrounded by a ditch and bank with other banks to south and south-west. [The] Motte measures 28m x 14.5m and is 3m high. â¦ [It] is one of several castles in Cheshire that were constructed in the medieval period to defend the rich agricultural resources of Cheshire from raids.â Historic England (ref: 1011118) âMotte & associated earthworks east of Old Rectoryâ, 1993. (Accessed 13 March 2020)\n\n1066info5, sheet 11\n\nThere is no evidence of a motte at Kinderton but it should be noted that the Normans did not construct them at all of their settlements. As such, that apparent absence would not of itself preclude Gilbert's settling there instead of at Eccleston.\n\nHowever, it is likely that Eccleston was still the seat of the Venables in the early 13th century since the deeds of that date (Catalogue of the Vernon Collection, Cheshire Records Office DVEI/MII/15 ) shows William de Venables (circa 1228) as 'Lord of Eccleston'. However, it seems clear that Kinderton had become a much more valuable holding than Eccleston by the middle of the 13th century.\n\nThis proposition is supported by statements in the Victoria County History of Cheshire, which makes reference to:\n\n'Kinderton, which was later to be the caput of the Cheshire barony of the Venables family, though there is nothing to indicate it had special status in 1086.' (VCH, Vol.1, p.311) In fact Domesday records that Kinderton was Wasta fuit et inventi, or waste in 1066 and 1070 and when Gilbert took it over.\n\nHis other lands included the demesne manor of Eccleston (demesne being lands retained by a feudal lord for his own use.)\n\nIn all instances, what was to become the first caput the barony was distinguished in Domesday by being placed first amongst the holder's estates in the hundred, the only exception being Kinderton, which was in no way distinguished from the other Middlewich holdings of Gilbert.' (VCH, Vol.1, p.307)\n\nAfter the devastation of 1069-70, recovery was at first slow, but as the town of Chester rose from the ashes, small villages were encouraged to sustain the economic growth. The evidence of the Domesday Book suggests a landscape of woodland, arable lands, meadows and wasteland across the width of the County. Every manor grew subsistent crops of wheat, barley and oats of necessity and annually ploughed, sowed and reaped two-thirds of their common open fields, always leaving one- third fallow.\n\n1066info5, sheet 12\n\nSources:\n\nElvington, CR (Ed), âThe Victoria County History of the Counties of England: A History of Cheshire Vol.1â, University of London Institute for Historical Research, 1987 p.83\n\nOrmerod G., âHistory of Cheshire Vol.2â 1882, p.829\n\nStrickland Tim, Archaeologist of Chester Museum, Discussion on a coach bound for Dives- sur-Mer, 14 July 2006\n\nSylvester D., âA History of Cheshireâ, Phillimore and Co.

The same white cast iron village nameplate, surmounted by a golden dog, adorns each house or gatepost. The settlement and its cathedral-like church, built in the Early English style and consecrated in 1900, have been, and may still be, heavily influenced by the affluent Grosvenor estate at Eaton Hall, 2km south along Walting Street. It is a village worthy of the Duke of Westminster, the richest British person in the United Kingdom, whose property investments were valued by The Sunday Times Rich List 2006 at Â£6.6 billions.\n\n1066info5, sheet 13"
