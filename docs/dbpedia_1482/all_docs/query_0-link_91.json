        "text": "Lafayette Emerick (or \"Emrick\") was born on Jan. 6, 1847 in Southampton Township, Somerset County, PA, the son of Jonathan and Rachel (Sturtz) Emerick Sr. His birth took place on the old homestead of his grandparents, Andrew and Christina (Heller) Emerick and was recorded in the papers of St. Luke's Lutheran Church of Cumberland, MD.\n\nAs a boy, he learned how to operate his father's sawmill, gristmill and fuller mill.\n\nLafayette was twice wed. His first wife was Mary Clites (1845-1899), who was three years older. She was the daughter of Samuel and Sarah Ann (Shroyer) Clites.\n\nTheir seven known children were Martha Ellen Shroyer, Sarah Cordilla Mills, Levi Franklin \"Frank\" Emerick, Charles Emerick, George Emerick, Effie Geneva \"Nettie\" Shaffer and Russell Calvin Emerick.\n\nFairhope, Lafayette's home circa 1910\n\nThey were longtime farmers. Circa 1879, Lafayette and his brothers, Gaumer cousins and others helped erect a new house of worship for the community, known as Comp's Lutheran and Reformed Church.\n\nIn 1880, the Emricks lived in Southampton Township, also providing a home for Lafayette's aging parents and his 56-year-old unmarried brother Nathan. In 1880, they lived next to Lafayette's married brother John and sister Mary E. Emerick and their families.\n\nTragedy rocked the family in about 1899 when Mary, age 56, is said to have been struck by a bolt of lightning and died. Her remains were placed into rest in the Comp's Cemetery in Southampton Township.\n\nAs a widower, Lafayette eventually moved a short distance north to the town of Fairhope, Somerset County. He purchased a home near the Fairhope Church. After some years alone, he married again, to Emma Johnson Thomas (March 1878-1956), reputedly an immigrant from Sweden.\n\nIn 1911, they produced one son, Gilbert Emerick.\n\nLafayette was named in the 1913 Meyersdale Republican obituary of his brother Nathan as living in Glen Savage, Somerset County.\n\nLafayette and his youngest son Gilbert relocated to Indiana. They sold their property in Allegheny Township for $800 and then purchased in 1928 a residence in Helmer, Stueben County, said to have been a mile northwest of town on the South Milford Road. His nephew George W. Emerick also owned a farm in Helmer about a mile east of Lafayette's.\n\nLafayette died in Gilbert's home two days after his 97th birthday on Jan. 8, 1944. Interment was in the Wright Cemetery in Hudson, Steuben County. An obituary in the Angola (IN) Herald noted that funeral services were held in the United Brethren Church in Helmer, officiated by Rev. M.E. Burkett.\n\nEvidence suggests that Emma spent her final years in Canton, Stark County, OH and died there on June 7, 1956.\n\n~ Daughter Martha Ellen (Emerick) Shroyer ~\n\nDaughter Martha Ellen Emerick (1868-1941) was born on March 27, 1868 in Kennels Mill, Somerset County.\n\nCirca 1896, she married Silas Walter Shroyer (April 1864-1931), son of Joseph and Catherine Ann (Smith) Shroyer.\n\nThey were longtime farmers in Fairhope, Somerset County and together produced these known children -- Clara Emerick Burley, Nettie Smith, Elmer D. Shroyer, Cora Ellen Beal, Mamie Hurt, Joseph Adam Shroyer and Raymond Shroyer.\n\nThe federal census enumeration of 1900 indicates that Silas' occupation at the time was as a brickyard laborer.\n\nBy 1910, census records show that Silas now worked as a shoemaker in their home, while son Elmer was a railroad laborer.\n\nDuring the decade of the 1910s, and into 1920, Silas was hired to deliver mail by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nSadly, Silas passed away at age 68 in Fairhope on May 28, 1931. The deputy coroner wrote: \"Had suffered with asthma and dropsy for a number of years. For the past month limbs were so swollen he was unable to walk. Which would indicate dropsy caused his death.\" The Bedford Gazette published an obituary, saying he was a \"prominent farmer of Fairhope\" and that funeral services were led by Rev. T.W. Evans of Hyndman. The remains were placed into repose in the Madley Cemetery near Hyndman, Bedford County.\n\nMartha Ellen outlived him by a decade. In later years, suffering from heart disease and hardening of the arteries, she made her home with her married daughter Clara Shroyer in Fairhope. Martha Ellen died at the age of 73 on July 19, 1941. An obituary was printed in the Cumberland (MD) Sunday Times.\n\nSon Elmer Shroyer (1889- ? ) was born in April 1889. In 1910, at the age of 21, in 1910, he earned a living as a railroad laborer. He was united in matrimonial union with Araminta (Quick) Baker (Feb. 6, 1876-1923), who was a dozen years older than the groom. The daughter of Frank H. and Susan (Baughman) Quick of Maryland. Araminta brought a stepson into the second marriage, Frank O. Baker. The couple went on to bear a son of their own, Henry Weller Shroyer. They made a home together in Fairhope. Sadness cascaded over the family when Araminta, who had suffered for three years with heart valve insufficiency, died at the age of 46 on Jan. 16, 1923. A short notice of her passing was printed in the Meyersdale Republican. Interment of the remains was in Comps Church Cemetery. Evidence hints that he may have married a second time to Allie Jordan Cook, and that they separated by November 1926. Elmer remained in Fairhope in 1931 at the death of his father. His fate is not yet known.\n\nSomerset County\n\nMemorial Park\n\nStep-grandson Frank O. Baker (1903-1968) was born on April 27, 1903 in Fairhope, Somerset County.

The nuptials were held in St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church of Somerset, and officiated by Rev. Fr. Albert Gartland. In announcing the marriage, the Somerset Daily American said that the bride \"wore a gown of white brocaded satin, with fitted bodice and long full skirt ending in a train. The basque waist had a sweetheart neckline and long fitted sleeves, ending in points over the hand. A finger tip veil was caught with a half-wreath of tiny white orange blossoms.\" The family lived in Ida's hometown of Quecreek. Three children born into this family were Rose Marie Shaffer, James A. Shroyer and a son who died in infancy. His occpuation was mining coal, and he worked for Saxman Coal and Coke Company.

Circa 1930, the Hurts were in Coal Junction, Somerset County, and 1931 lived in Cumberland, MD. Frederick earned a living as a blacksmith for the construction industry. They built a seven-room frame house in 1938 and remained there for good. The Hurts made news in the early 1950s when the Maryland State Roads Commission sought to place a drainage ditch across their property along Bedford Road. The couple objected, and were sued by the state in order to condemn their tract. The case finally went to trial in 1956, and a jury awarded the Hurts $1,500 as compensation.

They also lost a child during the 1890s.\n\nWhen the 1900 federal census enumeration was made, they dwelled in Fairhope, Somerset County. Benjamin labored in a local clay mine in 1900.\n\nBenjamin then moved in April 1901 to Everett, Bedford County, where he planned to \"reside in the near future,\" said the Meyersdale Republican.\n\nAt the age of 37, while suffering a miscarriage, septic shock set in, and her health collapsed. She died on Dec. 2, 1907. Burial was in Comp's Church Cemetery.\n\nBenjamin did not live long as a widower. He was deceased by April 1909.

She became the couple's foster daughter. Then in 1915, M.N. Stailey was appointed as guardian. At the age of 18, she made a home in Breezewood. On Feb. 10, 1915, she was joined in marriage with 23-year-old laborer Elza Merry Bryson (Aug. 21, 1891-1948), son of Samuel and Amanda (Daniels) Bryson of Breezewood. Officating the wedding, held at Everett, Bedford County, was Rev. George E. King. Together, the couple bore two children, Wanda D. Conover and Eugene Bryson. The United States Census of 1920 shows the family in Breezewood, living along U.S. Route 30, also known as the Lincoln Highway. Elza at that time worked as a sawmill laborer. The census of 1940 shows the family remaining in Breezewood with Elza laboring in construction. By 1948, the couple had separated, with Lonie and their daughter moving to Maryland, with their son living somewhere in Pennsylvania. Elza thus lived by himself and performed odd jobs. On the fateful evening of Dec. 23, 1948, as he was walking along the Lincoln Highway, Elza was struck and instantly killed by a passing motorist, having been thrown or dragged a distance of 100 feet. Said the Bedford (PA) Gazette, \"Bryson was found lying on the right side of Route 30 300 yards west of Breezewood... It was found that Bryson suffered a crushed skull, crushed chest, fractures of both shoulders, compound fractures of both legs, a broken neck and numerous lacerations and abrasions... Investigators believe that Bryson was struck by a truck.\" Mrs. John Conover, of Indian Head, MD, was the informant who signed the official Pennsylvania certificate of death.
