He fought the good fight against diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson's disease and multiple strokes. Gilbert was born on July 18, 1932 to William and Rose (Ripp) Helt. Gilbert married the love of his life, Carol Rauls on April 17, 1958 and she preceded him in death on May 19, 2011. Gilbert was a farmer in the Dane area for many years and proudly worked the land with his John Deere tractors. He had a great wit and always a smile for anyone he met. He was a world traveler and no stone was left unturned. A good game of cards was always a sure bet and a good meal he could never forget.\n\nSurvivors include his children Paul Helt (Angela), Ann (Steve) Vosen, Joan (Mark) Richter, Dale (Diane) Helt, Kay (Dan) Breunig, and Lynn (Chuck) Meier; 14 grandchildren; 4 great-grandchildren; brothers, Godfrey, Sylvester, Donald (Diane), William (Virginia), Tony (Joan), and Tom (Marlene); his sister, Dorothy (Gene) Voegel; sisters-in-law, Doris and Viola Helt, and many extended Helt and Rauls family members.\n\nGilbert was preceded in death by his parents and wife; brothers, Frederick, Joe and John; his sister, Rose; sister-in-law, Rosella; brother-in-law Claude Schuster and John Endres.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Sat., May 11, 2013 at 11:00 a.m. at St. Michaels Catholic Church, 109 S. Military Road in Dane. The Reverend Francisco Higuera and Reverend Brian Dulli will officiate. Friends may call at the Winn-Cress Funeral Home, 5785 Hwy Q, Waunakee from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. on Friday, May 10, 2013. Friends may also call at the church on Saturday from 10:00 a.m. until the time of services. Burial will take place in the church cemetery.\n\nDad was a kind and gentle man. He taught all of us to work hard and have faith in God;\n\nand most of all to love the land and take care of one another. We love you Dad. Thanks for everything. We would like to thank the Waunakee Manor for the exceptional care given to Dad."
