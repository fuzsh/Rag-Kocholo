Have an account? .\n\nSylvester Stallone's new Netflix documentary \"Sly\" briefly mentions the actor's children.\n\nStallone has three daughters with his wife Jennifer Flavin: Sophia, Sistine, and Scarlet.\n\nHere is what you need to know about his children, who all served as Miss Golden Globe in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSylvester Stallone has three daughters with his third wife, Jennifer Flavin. They all share Rose as their middle name.\n\nSylvester Stallone has married three times but his three daughters come from his third marriage to model Jennifer Flavin. Their eldest, Sophia, was actually born a year before their wedding in 1997.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three sisters appear on their family's reality show \"The Family Stallone.\"\n\nIn May 2023, the first season of \"The Family Stallone\" dropped on Paramount+. The series digs into the lives of the family family.\n\nOn the \"Today\" show, Sophia and Sistine said that the reality show was their idea after producers approached them following the success of their joint podcast, \"Unwaxed.\" They then roped the rest of their family into doing the show.\n\nThe series was renewed for a second season a week after its premiere.\n\nSistine told Numero magazine in July that it was the father who actually pushed the reality show forward.\n\n\"He thought we are getting older and that people stereotypically do a reality show when it's sort of the end of their career, but he feels like he's on a high right now,\" she said. \"I think for my parents, it was a good excuse to have us all in the same home again since we all live apart from each other.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSophia Rose Stallone, 27, is the oldest daughter of Sylvester and Flavin.\n\nSophia Rose Stallone graduated from the University of Southern California in 2019 with a degree in communications, and a minor in entrepreneurship and film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has had two heart surgeries.\n\nWhen Sophia was two months old, she was diagnosed with a cardiac malformation that was treated successfully. However, in 2012, she had to have heart surgery again because of a heart valve problem.\n\n\"Every day I think of my heart,\" Sophia told Paris Match magazine at the time (via Hello Magazine). \"I eat really healthy, and as I get more tired than normal, I have to be very careful when doing sports. Now I have to have surgery again because the tissue they put in 16 years ago has widened and I have problems with the valves. If all goes well, I will spend five days in the hospital.\"\n\nSophia spoke about the 2012 incident on episode six of \"The Family Stallone,\" explaining that she was \"born with a hole in my heart.\"\n\nShe said that when she was 16, she fainted while playing volleyball, which is when she discovered she needed another surgery.\n\n\"It was really scary having to go from living this normal life when I was 16 to having to have my chest sawed open,\" Sophia said. \"The moment I found out I needed an operation was one of the most pivotal experiences in my entire life because I never had to consider death before. I think what was really hard during that time was Mom had rashes all over her body, Dad couldn't even talk to me without crying about it.\"\n\nShe added: \"It's really traumatizing when you see the people you think are going to be like the ones that should be like, 'You're going to be 100% fine,' break down harder than you were.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, Sophia said she wanted to be an entrepreneur and have her own fashion line.\n\nIn 2017, when asked about her goals during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sophia spoke about wanting to work in fashion.\n\n\"I want to be an entrepreneur and run my own fashion and makeup line,\" she said. \"I think today it's all about digital and social media, and so being recognized is a huge asset. Like, Kylie Jenner Lip Kit is blowing up. So getting my face out there is a big part of it.\"\n\nShe also said she didn't want to become an actor after going behind the scenes of the industry.\n\n\"I used to love theater and thought I wanted to be an actress,\" she said. \"But when I went behind the scenes in the industry, I didn't mesh well at all. You have to have a certain personality to be an actor in Hollywood. We see the long hours, the rejection. None of it is in your hands.\"\n\nShe later showed her love of fashion as a guest judge on \"Project Runway.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe currently runs a book club on Instagram.\n\nOver the last few years, Sophia has moved into the online influencer field by starting her own podcast and book club.\n\nIn 2020, she and her sister Sistine created the podcast \"Unwaxed.\" A year later, Sophia created a book club Instagram page, where she reviews and recommends books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSophia is also writing a young adult novel.\n\nEpisode seven of \"The Family Stallone\" explores Sophia's passion for words.\n\nIn the episode, she told her father she is writing a young adult romance and historical fiction novel called \"Weight of Her Words.\" She said she had written 15 chapters of the book at the time of filming.\n\n\"I'm like a quarter-ish way through it,\" she told her father in the episode. \"The writing is so tough. I love doing it but it's so tough.\"\n\nSophia added that she's quit multiple hobbies because she feels like she has to be \"perfect\" or held to a higher standard due to her family name.\n\n\"I want this book to work but I already know that people are going to want this to look stupid and people are probably going to say it's shitty,\" she tells her father. \"I just have this added pressure. No one's pressuring me but I'm pressuring myself now and I'm just shutting down a little bit.\"\n\nShe later said that she feels \"insecure\" about the book because it's a venture that she's doing by herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine Rose Stallone is 25.\n\nSistine Rose Stallone is Stallone's second child with Flavin and was born in 1998. She originally followed in her mother's footsteps, signing with IMG Models in 2016.\n\nThat year, Sistine walked her first fashion show for Chanel at the age of 18 and was featured in Glamour magazine.\n\nIn 2017, she was on the cover of Elle Russia and also walked the Dolce & Gabbana runway at Men's Fashion Week in Milan, Italy, with her sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine loves riding horses.\n\nIn episode six of \"The Family Stallone,\" Sistine reconnects with her love of horse riding.\n\nShe said that she started riding when she was 15, competing in several contests in LA, and also qualified for the national championship for her age group.\n\nHowever, that all ended when Sistine decided to pursue her modeling career in New York.\n\n\"Which sounds quite embarrassing to say out loud, that I would choose to be a coat hanger instead of a cowgirl. I don't understand how I just didn't see it at the time,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine originally said she wasn't interested in acting but has since changed her mind.\n\nSistine has starred in a TV show and two films, including the Bruce Willis and Megan Fox movie \"Midnight in the Switchgrass.\" However, in 2017, she didn't seem keen on acting.\n\n\"As for me, I don't think I could ever act,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. \"I'm good for modeling because I don't have to talk. Acting is something you're born with. My mother is a model. I have dreamed about being a model since I was a little girl.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine is producing a horror movie.\n\nAccording to episode seven of \"The Family Stallone,\" Sistine has been working on her own horror movie since 2018.\n\nSistine discussed the script for the upcoming \"Scavenger Hunt,\" with director Elle Callahan as they were about to pitch to MGM.\n\n\"I've gone through countless meetings. Pandemic hit so had to restart again. So it's just been a long process,\" she continued. \"We've probably interviewed 40 to 50 different writers and directors, and I landed on this brilliant mind named Elle Callahan. We are just about done with the script, and it's going to be sent to MGM. So I'm really happy it's happening right now.\"\n\nThe MGM deal was successful and Sistine signed on as a producer for the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine and Sophia started a podcast together in 2020 called \"Unwaxed.\"\n\nSistine and Sophia talked about their personal lives on the podcast — from fitness to breakups and everything in between.\n\nReality stars such as \"Real Housewives of New York\" cast member Leah McSweeney, and actors Greg Sulkin and Cameron Fuller have appeared on the podcast.\n\nSistine told Numero magazine that the podcast was originally Sophia's idea. The elder sister wanted to do a literature podcast where she interviewed authors.\n\n\"And I, as an annoying little sister, was just bugging her to let me do it,\" Sistine added. \"She said no at first, that this is her thing, but I broke her down enough to let her have me on, and then we sort of just reworked the whole podcast idea.\"\n\nSistine also told Dolce magazine that they fought during the early recordings and had to learn not to cut each other off.\n\n\"I can say there were at least 30 unused podcast episodes because my sister and I would talk over each other,\" She said. \"And then it just became a mess!\"\n\nAfter a 10-month hiatus, the sisters started the podcast again on October 31. They said in their return that the reason for the hiatus was because they were so busy with the reality show, and couldn't find the time to record episodes for their podcast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine and Sophia moved to New York together\n\nIn episode six of \"The Family Stallone,\" the sisters talked about their new living conditions after moving into apartments next to each other in LA.\n\nHowever, in November 2022, the pair said on their podcast that they wanted to move together to New York.\n\nThey made the move in March.\n\nSistine told Numero magazine that many of her friends had already moved there, while her family had also moved away to Florida.\n\n\"Honestly, really sad to admit, but I was very lonely in LA,\" Sistine said. \"Going to bed at 9 p.m. every night with a book is not how a 25-year-old should be living.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine and Sophia said their last name has made dating complicated.\n\nIn episode two of \"The Family Stallone,\" Sophia and Sistine said that being a Stallone has made dating more difficult because men only want to date them because of their famous last name.\n\n\"Dating with the last name that I have is incredibly hard,\" Sophia said. \"One time I dated a guy, he was wondering how long it would take to date me until he got courtside seats. And that's when I knew I was going to be in for a really tough ride in the dating scene.\"\n\nSistine added: \"You never really know someone's intention when you first start dating. They just think it's cool to date a Stallone. One guy brought his resumé on the date. One guy brought a script. One guy said he was an aspiring actor, and I said, 'Do you want to date me or Sly?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlet Rose Stallone is the youngest daughter at 21.\n\nScarlet Rose Stallone is Stallone's youngest child. She was a track-and-field star at her middle school, St. Paul the Apostle School in Westwood, Los Angeles. She graduated high school in 2021 and now attends the University of Miami.\n\nIn \"The Family Stallone\" finale, she said that she had joined a sorority.\n\nThe reality star also appears to be dating Louis Masquelier-Page, another student from her university.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScarlet acted alongside her father in the first season of the Paramount+ series \"Tulsa King\"\n\nScarlet starred in five episodes of Sylvester's new series, \"Tulsa King.\"\n\nIn \"The Family Stallone\" episode five, Scarlet said that she \"fell in love with acting\" as a child and did numerous plays and acting classes as she grew up.\n\nIn the episode, Stallone said that he helped her get a part on \"Tulsa King\" to see if she had the acting skills to make it in the industry.\n\n\"When 'Tulsa King' came along, I thought, 'I'd love to do something with her.' I mean while I'm still on this earth wouldn't it be nice to have some moments with my daughter?\" the \"Rocky\" star said.\n\nScarlet said she was \"super nervous\" but had a great time on her first day in front of the camera.\n\n\"She blew me off the screen,\" her father said.\n\nOn her sisters' podcast, Scarlet said it was a \"dream come true\" to star in the show.\n\n\"I've wanted to act my whole life,\" she said. \"And I kind of manifested it a little bit. Ever since I was 14, I wrote in the back of my book, 'I'm going to star in a movie with Dad.'\"\n\nShe continued: \"It's also really funny to work with him because he likes to mess with me a little bit on set while filming.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three sisters are very close.\n\nDuring an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sistine spoke about the sisters' close relationship.\n\n\"I've never seen such a close sisterhood bond. How we are perceived through paparazzi is really how it is,\" Sistine said in 2017, when the sisters shared the Miss Golden Globe title.\n\nScarlet and Sophia supported Sistine at her acting debut in the 2019 survival horror film \"47 Meters Down: Uncaged\" and at the premiere of the 2021 movie \"Midnight in the Switchgrass,\" in which she appeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sisters also said that their father often scares off their romantic partners.\n\nSistine said on the premiere episode of \"The Family Stallone\" that the sisters struggle to date due to their father.\n\n\"Dating when you have the dad that we do is rough,\" she said. \"The first time a boy came over to meet my parents, he's going in for the first kiss, and I was so nervous, but I was excited. And he looks up at the balcony, and he goes, 'Oh, my god. What is that?'\"\n\nShe continued: \"It was my dad. Standing on the second-floor balcony backlit so you just see a silhouette. He's so cinematic in the most unnecessary reasons. And let me tell you. This kid jumps in the car. Went down the driveway. Never saw him again.\"\n\nSophia said that when they bring a boy home, their father becomes \"full-on Rambo with guns,\" referring to his famous acting role.\n\nSistine said: \"It has been a struggle for my sisters and I to even find a relationship. Not only do we have Stallone attached to our last name, my dad is also very overprotective and quite intimidating.\"\n\nShe continued: \"But now that we're older and currently in relationships, you'd think that he would really want to make that effort to get to know the boyfriend, and that hasn't exactly happened yet. This is someone that is very special in my life. I've never had a relationship as good as this one before so it does hurt my feelings that there has been very minimal effort on his part.\"\n\nIn episode one, Stallone shot down a golfing trip with his daughters' boyfriends. His excuse for being so hard on them was that he wanted to get rid of the \"creeps.\"\n\nBy the end of the show, Sistine and Sophia confronted their father about it, and the \"Rocky\" actor agreed to be more open.\n\nDuring their appearance on the \"Today\" show earlier this year, Scarlet said that her boyfriend is the only man Stallone has approved of.\n\n\"Now they're best friends,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSistine and Sophia are currently both single.\n\nIn the latest episode of their \"Unwaxed\" podcast, Sistine and Sophia offer an update about their lives.

I remember we got into a fight because you came up to me and you said, 'Sophia, my ex got a job offer, and I'm going to go with him.' Just randomly, no context, nothing and I got so mad at her. I go, 'You weren't even going to ask me to go with you,'\" Sophia said. \"I'm like, what about our podcast, what about our sleepovers, what about our life.\"\n\nSistine said that eventually, the ex-boyfriend backtracked on the move, so she broke up with the man and told her sister to come with her instead.\n\nSophia said that she broke up with her own long-distance boyfriend, who was living in New York, around the same time they moved to the city. Sistine also said later in the episode that she was briefly banned on Hinge — accused of being a catfish — because people didn't believe she was who she said she was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sisters said their father raised them like \"little military brats.\"\n\nIn the premiere episode of \"The Family Stallone,\" the sisters spoke about growing up with their celebrity father.\n\nSistine said it was \"really hard\" when her father was away on movie sets as a child.\n\n\"I don't think I ever expressed those emotions as a kid,\" she said. \"I kind of just accepted that that was his job, but he just brings so much love and warmth to the house.\"\n\nSophia described Stallone as a \"girl dad.\"\n\nShe added: \"He wants to bake with us. He watches 'The Bachelor' with us, and it's a totally different side to him than you've ever seen.\"\n\nSistine said of growing up with Stallone: \"It's really interesting because he would have us train every morning, but he wasn't training us in normal sports that our friends were doing.\"\n\nShe added in a cutaway: \"My dad raised us like little military brats.\"\n\nSistine and Sophia then listed several exercises they had to do before breakfast, including push-ups, swinging golf clubs, chess, reading out loud, shotput, and boxing in the kitchen. They added that breakfast was usually eggs, inspired by a character from one of his films.\n\nSistine said: \"I would literally throw up my breakfast, and he would make me another plate of eggs.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family's reality show has been renewed for a second season.\n\nIn May 2023, the family's Paramount+ reality show was renewed for a second season a week after it premiered.\n\nAccording to Paramount+, the first episode of \"The Family Stallone\" was the most-watched original reality series premiere in the streaming service's history.\n\nIn July, Sistine told Numero magazine they had begun filming season two. She also said that the season would have episodes focusing on each family member \"to show their personalities.\"\n\n\"We felt like the first season was a really good dipping of our toes in the water, introducing us, but I'm really excited because we're showing more vulnerable sides, more silly sides,\" Sistine added.\n\nIn the latest episode of their \"Unwaxed\" podcast, Sistine and Sophia teased season two, claiming that it is \"so much better\" than season one.\n\nThey said Scarlet's boyfriend would appear in season two; the Stallones would go to Italy to meet family; and Sistine would participate in a live dating show.\n\nSistine and Sophie also said they're more open to discussing their personal lives now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStallone briefly mentions his three daughters in his new Netflix documentary.\n\nIn November 2023, Netflix released a documentary about Stallone, which the \"Rocky\" actor participated in.\n\nToward the end of the film, Stallone's wife and daughters make brief appearances.\n\nStallone said his family struggled seeing him injure himself a lot on the set of the first \"The Expendables\" movie.\n\nHe later added that he eventually realized that taking care of his family was more important than his film work.\n\n\"There's always that regret. I could have learned so much more if I hadn't been so self-absorbed and dealing with other people,\" he said. \"You think about what you should have done at this age. And now they're this age. What did I mess up on? I'm there making a stupid movie instead of making their life.\"\n\n\"I had to almost lose it to respect it,\" he added.\n\nRead next\n\nCelebrity Family\n\nAdvertisement"
