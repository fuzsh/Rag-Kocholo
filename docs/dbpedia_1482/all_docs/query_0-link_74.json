In 1833 he removed with his parents to the town of Shelby where he has since continued to reside. He received a good education at the common schools and at the Gaines and Millville Academies, and for several years was a successful and influential teacher. In 1844 he married Miss Ann R. BECKWITH, who, with four of six children born to them, still survives to cherish his memory. By industry, economy and judicious management they established at East Shelby, for themselves and children, a beautiful and pleasant home.\n\nMr. JACKSON was a public spirited citizen and judicious friend and an earnest advocate of all measures calculated to benefit the community. About the year 1850 he was influential in establishing the post office at East Shelby, and was himself the first postmaster appointed at that place. He was also chiefly instrumental in getting School District No. 12 established with school house at East Shelby, a measure of very great local importance. Mr. JACKSON has held, and honorably discharged, the duties of offices of trust and responsibility in town and county. He was for several years one of the Justices of the Peace for the town of Shelby, and one of the Justices of Sessions for Orleans county. Richly endowed by nature, possessing a well balanced mind and a discriminating judgment his counsel was much sought after and greatly relied upon, while his genial manners and sociability, his intelligence and agreeableness made him a most welcome, as he was a most valuable, member of society.\n\nHe was an impressive speaker, but he was also a good listener, and like most men of large caution he was naturally conservative. He was notably slow in his welcome to, and in his appreciation of, speculative thought. He was intensely practical and far from being a visionary or an enthusiast. He cultivated a habit of looking at a subject in a slow, cautious, all around sort of way, that was sometimes disappointing and not seldom almost exasperating to warm impulsive natures; but the value and steadiness of his judgment, when it was once formed, amply compensated for any seeming over caution in its formation.\n\nHis mother was a woman of deep personal piety and of excellent judgment. He used often to say that to her example and instruction he owed the foundation of whatever was best and most enduring in his life and work. Mr. JACKSON seems to have been naturally devout. I think reverence was one of his marked traits of character. His religious experience began early in life and grew richer with the years. His favorite themes of conversation with congenial and reverent spirits were the goodness of God, the richness of His revelation and the hope of blessed immortality.\n\nFor forty years he had been a highly esteemed member of the Congregational Church, at Millville, and for about thirty years had been the efficient superintendent of its Sunday School. But much as he loved his Church home, and dearly as he cherished its interests, his labors of love were not confined there but were generously bestowed in other places, as he had opportunity. He was distinguished above most men for his very cordial dislike of sectarianism in any of its narrow, begoted or exclusive forms.\n\nLike all other men of real worth he was valued most by those who knew him best. To the inner circle of family and intimate friends he revealed most fully the richer, stronger, more generous side of his nature. These curious lives of ours are capable of so being bound up with other lives in all the dearer interests of humanity, that when a much loved friend goes away from us on the long journey that knows no return, something real and substantial seems to go out from our own life, and the Here becomes poorer, and the Hereafter richer because of his removal hence. Our dear friend will, of course, be most missed by his family, but he will also be long and gratefully remembered in Church, educational and social circles, and in all the public interests of the community where he has lived so long and useful a life.\n\nDying at the age of sixty-six from pneumonia, occasioned or rendered fatal by a fall he had sustained nearly two weeks before, in the full possession of all his mental faculties until a few hours of the last, in the presence of his wife and children, without pain and without fear, he sank gently and peacefully to his rest. The funeral took place on Saturday, the 28th ult. from the family residence and from the Church at East Shelby. Rev. C. W. Drake, of Millville, conducted the services, assisted by Revs. E. B. Furbish, of Lockport, N, Y., and J. H. Whitmore, of Sterling, Massachusetts.\n\nMay his memory long be gratefully cherished, and may we who survive remember that we can best honor him by practicing the virtues that adorned his life, and by helping those public interests whose welfare he had most at heart.\n\n(Interment in Millville Cemetery)\n\nPosted by: Orleans County Genweb staff, 25 Jun 2007\n\nREUBEN G.

About five weeks ago he had a stroke of paralysis and a second stroke two weeks ago, after which he failed rapidly until his death.\n\nMr. JACKSON was born in Duanesburg, N. Y., October 24, 1799. In 1822 he married Martha COMSTOCK in Onondaga county. In 1826 he came to the town of Ridgeway, where he bought 100 acres of land, built a log house, returned for his family and installed them therein. Though his original purchase was at that time considered a large farm, he soon bought more land, which in the course of the years he made one of the finest farms in the county. He remained upon this farm until thirteen years ago, when he purchased a home in this village, and retired to rest which he had well earned by nearly three-score years of active industry.\n\nMrs. JACKSON died in 1872, their married life having covered a period of nearly 50 years. Afterwards Mr. JACKSON married Mrs. Charlotte GRIFFEN, who died about three years ago. Eleven children were the fruit of his first marriage, six who are still living, as follows: Orange L. JACKSON of Canandaigua, N. Y.; Edwin R. JACKSON, of Holley, N. Y.; Mrs. L. L. OSTROM, of Albion, Mich.; Mrs. E. H. KNAPP, of Homer, Mich.; Mrs. E. I. HUNT, of Medina, N. Y. and Mrs. Geo. C. BROWN, of Tennessee. Three brothers, James and Benjamin, of Medina, and Amos of Syracuse, and one sister, Mrs. Clarinda WILEY, of Dansville, also survive him, and their ages will average 90 years.\n\nMr. JACKSON was an honored and respected citizen both in his old home in Ridgeway and during his later residence in this village. In spite of increasing feebleness and his great age, he retained his faculties and interest in village affairs and matters of general concern up to his last illness. He was a faithful and honored member of the Methodist church for many years.\n\nThe funeral was held Tuesday afternoon at 2 o'clock from his late residence, and the body was interned in the family lot in Hillside Cemetery. The funeral services were conducted by Rev. F. W. Hemenway, pastor of the Methodist church, and were largely attended.\n\n(Note: The following article was published 10 years before his death)\n\nNewspaper: Holley Standard, Thursday, October 28, 1880 p. 1\n\nMr. William JACKSON, formerly of Medina, but now an honored citizen of this village, attained to his 81st birthday on Sunday last. He is in remarkable good health and mind for one of his age. Mr. JACKSON has several children married, and living in this state and in Michigan. An effort was made to get the family together on this occasion, but in the case of a number who were so far distant it was not convenient for them to leave their homes, their own appearance was substituted by kind and cheering words through the medium of a pen. We are permitted to select a few extracts from these messages of love and give them to our readers.\n\nMrs. P. OSTRUM, living at Albion, Mich., among other things says: \"My Dear Father: Next Sunday is your birthday. When I think of it, and your age, good health and ability, I can but thank the All-wise Father that you have been spared to us so long. How I want to be with you, but circumstances conspire to make it impossible. Sending my regrets and love, I wish you all a happy time and one to be remembered in after years.\"\n\nAnother daughter, Mrs. Jane KNAPP, of Homer, Mich., writes: \"I am reminded by the year, and the day of the year, that you near the 81st birthday of the flight of time. How gladly would I be with you on that day if fate, Providence or fortune willed it. A part of your children will meet and shake the parental hand, and gather around the festive board and engage in social conversation, and I hope and truly believe that the absent ones will not be forgotten. It seems but yesterday that this circle was unbroken; but death entered uninvited and made its selection of the choicest of the flock, and among the rest the wife and mother, which rent the home circle to its very foundation. Others may welcome, but we see the vacant chair. May it never be said that they children brought thee down to the grave sorrowing, but may all strive to lighten they footsteps, lifting the shadows from they pathway.\"\n\nMrs. Celia BROWN of Albion, Michigan, another daughter, writes: \"I thought I would write you and congratulate you on your 81st birthday. I wish, with my precious family, I could be with you, but it seems it cannot be. Our thoughts are with you, and the brothers and sisters that gather around your circle. Well, Pa, I your baby, living away out here; who would have thought a few years ago that Cel. would have got so far from home. I well remember when you told me I could sit on your lap until my feet touched the floor. If I were with you today I should feel like trying it once more -- ha! ha! I imagine I hear you say, \"A big baby indeed.\" I should dearly love to visit my dear Father and Old Orleans again, but we have good examples, and I think we shall profit by them; and as we commence on the lower round, we expect to reach the top sometime in the future. I thought that I would print this letter so you might read it without specs. A happy time to all.\"\n\nOrange JACKSON of Rushville, N. Y., sends regrets that he cannot be present, and thinks if he follows, as he has tried to do, the lines his father laid down for his children, he will be prepared for a reunion in the hereafter.\n\nWilliam JACKSON, Jr., of Middleport, writes to his father and we extract the following: \"Few men at 81 years can sit in judgment on a past life and be troubled by no regrets. Few but would wish to mark out some of the foot-prints they have made; but those who follow yours will find them tending towards justice, humanity and truth, and feel that the end is victory. I love you all. We shall try to see you soon.\"\n\nWe have hardly ever seen or heard so many heartfelt tributes paid to parents, by children grown up, as the children of Mr. and Mrs. JACKSON have contributed to them.\n\n(Note: The following article was published 2 years before his death)\n\nNewspaper: The Holley Standard, Vol. XIX #7, p.1, 25 Oct 1888\n\nNinetieth Anniversary\n\nA pleasant company gathered at the home of E.

The high esteem in which he was held was shown by the sympathetic tear, the neighborly kindness, and by the many beautiful floral tributes.\n\nThe funeral services were conducted by Rev. Thomas Melvin, at the house, Monday afternoon at two oclock, and interment was made in Lynhaven Cemetery with services conducted by Yates Lodge 675; F. and A. M. The service at the house consisted of scripture reading and prayer.\n\nComrade C. F. Barry of S. and P. Gilbert Post, G. A. R., of which Mr. JOHNSON was Commander, was asked to speak in his memory, which he did as follows: We are here today to pay the last tribute of love to the memory of our comrade whom the Supreme Commander has called to join the great majority in the life beyond. His marches and battles of life are over. He heeds no more the bugle call nor the voice of mourning. We lay him away today in the narrow house appointed for all, and by this act we are reminded of the frailty of human life, and the question naturally comes to us, Who will be the next?\" This matters not if we so live and perform the duties of life with right views of our relation to God and our fellowmen that when the muffled drum beats taps and lights out we can respond cheerfully with no vain regrets or idle murmurings. The comrade we mourn today was one of the youngest members of Gilbert Post, of which he has been a faithful member from nearly the first, but few having been in the ranks longer than he, and none more faithful in the performance of every duty. He has occupied every position of honor and trust in the Post, having been elected our commander more times than any other member, always responding promptly to every call of trust, and never sparing time, trouble or money in advancing the interests of our order. Many of his comrades are reminded of his ready sympathy, kindliness of heart and material aid in time of trouble. To such his memory will be cherished as of those of whom we say:\n\nWe love and deem good\n\nHim who hath a creed of Brotherhood;\n\nWho hath no creed, but humbly shared\n\nWith some poor wretch who hapless fared\n\nLife's highway, food and sympathy.\"\n\nIn the old days of march, comrades were always ready with kind words of sympathy to the dear ones who listened for the footsteps of the comrade who had fallen by our side, and t oday we extend our heartfelt sympathy to those who are near and dear to him who lies cold in death, and we commend them to the care of a kind and loving God, the same who guarded him and us in our marches and whose protecting hand was over us in battle, in sickness, and in prison. We trust you may be able to say with us, \"He doeth all things well.\"\n\nMr. JOHNSON was long engaged in the manufacture of evaporated fruits, serving for several seasons as manager of the American Fruit Products Companys plants located here and at Barker. He was also a prominent fruit grower and farmer. A wife (Bessie), a daughter, Ethel, and two brothers, Harvey and Charles B. of Michigan, are left to mourn.\n\n(taken from the scrapbooks of Theda Powley Millis, Waterport)\n\nPosted by: Orleans County Genweb staff, 17 Jan 2004\n\nCORDELIA ANN JOHNSON (Jun 1818 - 15 Dec 1902)\n\nNewspaper: The Medina Tribune; Thurs., 25 Dec. 1902\n\nSurnames: JOHNSON, GASCOIGNE\n\nMrs. Cordelia Ann JOHNSON died Monday of last week at the home of her daughter Mrs. M.(Mary) E.

Her grandfather, Stephen JOHNSON, was a soldier in the war of the Revolution under General Putnam. Her father, Stephen Burr JOHNSON, was a soldier in the war of 1812, while she was a nurse in the Civil war. She was a direct descendant, on her grandmother's side, of the historic BURR family. Stephen Burr JOHNSON, her father, was born in Washington county, New York, May 19, 1794. He came to the town of Yates in 1817, and the next year purchased a farm which now is partly included in the village of Lyndonville. In 1819 he married Maria GILBERT. Five children were born to them, Lydia Selina being the youngest. Her passing marks the removal of the last of the children. Two pioneer families were united in her parent¬age, the JOHNSONs and the GILBERTs.\n\nShe was born April 21, 1830. In early life she taught school for one term. During September, 1862, she enlisted as an army nurse under Miss Dorothy Dix and went to Washington. Here she ministered to the wounded federals for about nine months, when she was stricken with typhoid fever, and returned to the North. After eight months of convalescing she returned, and was placed in charge of the dietary kitchen in the \"Old Seminary\" hospital at Fortress Monroe. At the close of the war she returned home. In local affairs she always had been a pioneer. She was the prime instigator and organizer of the Literary and Historical club of this town, and was a member and staunch supporter of the Methodist Episcopal church. In years she passed the age of eighty-five, and on May 13, 1915, closed her eyes in rest. Death resulted from the shock she received from a fractured hip, in a fall, following a general decline in health.\n\nThe funeral services were held from the home of her niece, Mrs. Bessie Johnson, conducted by Rev. B. R. Germer, assisted by Rev. H. H. Brown. At the cemetery the exercises were in charge of the Sons of Veterans. Her body was buried in Lynhaven Cemetery.

JOHNSON, November 4th, 1819. Since which time, the old farm a little north of this village has been her home. Mr. and Mrs. JOHNSON were intimately connected with all the labors and privations, incident to the transformation of a wilderness to the beautiful thriving town, and actively engaged in the improvements of our village from the first. They raised a family of five children, two sons and three daughters, all still living. Nearly twenty years ago, (February, 1855,) Mr. JOHNSON was called from the activities of life, to cross the majestic river of death. All these years the widowed one has clung to the old home, the home endeared by the ever present improvements, made by the united labors of the two, years ago. Here she lives respected and loved, patiently waiting for the master's call to the blissful rest and reunion above.\n\nThe funeral on Wednesday, at the M. E. Church, conducted by Rev. I. T.
