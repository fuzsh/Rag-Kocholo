        "text": "''SYLVESTER,'' which opens today at the Guild and other theaters, is about a pretty, 16-year-old Texan nicknamed ''Charlie'' (Melissa Gilbert), who's obsessed by horses. She likes to break them in, train them, ride them and care for them. When other girls her age are working as supermarket checkers or learning how to type or worrying about their hair, Charlie is hanging out with horses. ''It's just a phase, Charlie,'' says Mr. Foster (Richard Farnsworth), a crotchety but lovable trainer. ''All girls go through it.''\n\nIf you know your girl-and-her-horse movies, you know that horses are much more than a phase for someone like Charlie. You may also suspect that Charlie will fall in love with one particular horse, a white gelding she names ''Sylvester'' after Sylvester Stallone, and that, against all odds, she and Sylvester will compete in what in horse circles is called a major ''event.''\n\n''Sylvester'' was directed by Tim Hunter (''Tex'') and written by Carol Sobieski, who wrote ''Casey's Shadow,'' a boy-and-his-horse movie. It meets all the obligations of such fiction with a sincerity that only the owner of a glue factory could hate it. However, only someone as obsessed as Charlie might really be exalted by it.\n\nThe film is nicely acted by Miss Gilbert, of television's long-running ''Little House on the Prairie''; by Michael Schoeffling as Matt, the handsome young suitor who must accept the fact that he takes second place in Charlie's affections, and particularly by Mr. Farnsworth, whose screen presence is one of Hollywood's most reliable assets. The film was shot on location in Texas, where Charlie has grown up, and in Kentucky, which is the setting for the three-day ''International Kentucky Horse Trials'' that climax the story. Some of the steeplechase material is very good but nothing here comes close to ''National Velvet,'' which is 41 this year."
