        "meta_description": "Mirroring is a prevalent trope in the CW network teen drama The Vampire Diaries. The television series is itself a 'doubling' in that it is an adaptation of a series of novels by L. J. Smith. It creates a situation wherein the same central characters inhabit the parallel townships of the novels' Fells Church and television's Mystic Falls, and consequently have histories which are, at times, contradictory. The television version also explicitly explores the concept of the doppelganger, and thus the idea of reflection, even as it manipulates the historical and cultural contexts of the characters. The evil and good doppelgangers and the two fluid representations of the vampire simultaneously draw on the popular fascination with supernatural romances, while reflecting that adolescence is fundamentally a period of change and personality development.",
