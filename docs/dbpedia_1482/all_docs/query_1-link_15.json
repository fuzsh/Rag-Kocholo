Ordered by the court that same be recorded and filed for future reference. /s/ Ross Philips Judge of Probate.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nJilson, or Gilson as it often appears in records, is an unusual name and not previously seen in the Spartanburg Daniel Gilbert Sr. line. It looks like a surname. Often in the 18th and 19th century south, sons were given maiden names of their mother, or grandmother, as a given name. This could be a clue in identifying Jilson's mother's maiden name, or that of a grandmother.\n\nFact: Also Known As Gilson Olen Gilbert\n\nFact: Residence (1840, 1850) St. Clair, Alabama,\n\nSources\n\n↑ Jilson Olen Gilbert Find A Grave: Memorial #11653628\n\n↑ http://familysearch.org/v1/LifeSketch Jilson\n\n↑ Find A Grave: Memorial #37320266\n\n↑ Note- \"Rubye Sisson,\" St Clair County Marriages 1818-1899: Jibson Gilbert married Elizabeth Alberson 6 Apr 1822.
