        "text": "In our continuing series of notes on colonial genealogies, we give here the the complete appendix containing all early lists of emigrants to Virginia, taken from Jews and Muslims in British Colonial America (2012). This was the second volume in a series that began with When Scotland Was Jewish (2007) and concludes this month (May 2014) with the publication of The Early Jews and Muslims of England and Wales: A Genetic and Genealogical History.\n\nAre any of your colonial ancestors listed? If they are it is likely they bore Jewish ancestry, even if they did not practice Judaism and even if they presented themselves as Christian.\n\nLeft: As discussed in the associated chapter, “Virginia – First and Not So English – Colony,” William Byrd was undoubtedly crypto-Jewish.\n\nFrom the book by Hirschman and Yates\n\n“William Byrd, the ancestor of the Byrds of Virginia, was the son of John Bird, a London goldsmith.[i] The earliest firm genealogical record for the family is mention of a Thomas Bird, apprenticed to Henry Sacheverell (Hebrew anagram),[ii] vintner, in 1608, subsequently admitted to the Wine Merchants Company in 1616. Thomas Bird married his first cousin Elizabeth Bird. It was Thomas’ son, John who became a goldsmith. What is transparent from these records, given the occupations of wine merchant and goldsmith and first cousin marriage, is that the Birds/Byrds were Jewish. Byrd was not an English name before this family became prominent. The first of that name probably came to England as a court musician like the Sephardic Anthons mentioned earlier: a relative was William Byrd, the Renaissance court composer (circa 1540-1623). Publicly they were not Jewish, as Jews were officially banned from England until 1664. They were privately Jewish or crypto-Jewish as so many other persons in London at the time. It is likely that at least the first generation officially practiced Catholicism, the religion of their parent country. English custom in London and other major cities allowed Spanish and Portuguese Jews as foreigners to worship at their own parish churches, which were presumed to be Catholic.\n\n“William Byrd came to Virginia at the request of his uncle Captain Thomas Stegge, who was childless and designated William his heir. Although the exact date is unknown, his arrival was probably around 1670. The Stegges were traders with the Indians, primarily Catawbas and Cherokees, another profession markedly Jewish. Upon reaching adulthood and receiving his inheritance, Bird entered the lucrative triangular trade between Virginia, Barbados and Africa. Tobacco, deerskins, sugar, rum, and slaves were the primary commodities of exchange. Typically, those who plied this trade imported slaves from Portuguese middlemen off the Guinea Coast of Africa. In Barbados, rum and sugar were taken onboard to be transported to Virginia. American planters paid for rum, sugar and slaves in tobacco or deerskins and received credit in England or Scotland paid out to them in manufactured goods supplied on the steady stream of ships carrying new colonists. Except for the profit margins of the merchants, frequently Jews, no money changed hands, this only in England, thus preserving the mother country’s prohibition about allowing specie to flow into the colonies or accumulate there.\n\n“In 1673 Byrd married Mary Horsmanden, whose lineage goes back to the St. Leger family of Cornwall mentioned in chapter one. Very importantly, biographer Alden Hatch tells us that this St. Leger family traced its ancestry back to Baudoin III, King of Jerusalem during the Crusades, who was evidently of Jewish descent. Byrd soon became Receiver General of the King’s Revenue, as well as Auditor of Virginia. As Hatch notes, he both collected the taxes and audited them!\n\n“There are other strong cues regarding Bird’s ancestry and religious leanings. Hatch states that Byrd “regarded Catholics as but one degree above the devils from hell.” In 1699 when the Huguenots were under attack once again by a Catholic monarch, it was William Byrd of Virginia who championed their cause. About three hundred of them were brought to safety in Virginia and another two hundred the following year. “Largely as a result of the arguments presented by William Byrd to the Board of Trade, between 700 and 800 [Huguenots] settled in Virginia.”[iii] Such activities are in complete conformity with the efforts begun in the late 1500s by Raleigh and Drake to settle their Sephardic and Morisco kinsmen in the New World. Both Raleigh and Drake had assisted the Huguenots in France before and after the infamous St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572. In the 1705 edition of his History, Robert Beverley wrote of “the Goodness and generosity of Colonel Byrd toward these distressed Huguenots.” Beverly goes on to say,\n\nUpon their first Arrival in that country, he [Byrd] received them with all the tenderness of a Father, and ever since has constantly given them the utmost assistance… employing all his Skill, and all his friends to advance their interest both publickly and privately…. What Liberties has he not all along allowed them on his own plantations to furnish themselves from thence Corn and other necessaries? His Mills have been at their Service to grind their Corn toll-free…. With what Zeal did he represent their Cause to the Assembly? And with what earnestness did he press all his Friends in their favor”? [iv]\n\nByrd was attended in his final days by one of them, his valet Jean Marat – who bears a common Sephardic/Arabic surname.\n\n“William Byrd’s son William II was educated in England, where he learned Hebrew, Greek and Latin. Micajah Perry (nearly invariably a Sephardic name, as we have seen) was William Byrd, Sr.’s factor and agent in London and looked after William Byrd Jr.’s welfare as a student abroad. In 1705 young William returned to Virginia and took over the family’s several mercantile and milling interests. He had an avid interest in medicine and special fascination with the properties (and profits) in ginseng. This was a root gathered by Melungeons and shipped as far away as China during the late 1700s by Daniel Boone and John Jacob Astor (“from Asturia”). William Byrd II married Lucy Parke. Lucy’s sister Frances would later marry John Custis (Costas), probably of Sephardic ancestry.\n\n“Hatch also reports from transcriptions of Byrd’s private diary that he would read one or two chapters of the Bible in Hebrew every morning. Since the Hebrew Bible does not contain the New Testament, we must assume that William was reading the Torah. Hatch continues, “Byrd was very strict about keeping the Sabbath. He would allow no work to be done that could possibly be avoided; and even when it could not be helped… he was uneasy in his conscience and sought a Biblical excuse.” Also according to Hatch, Byrd “frequently ducked going to [Christian] church.” In our view, these descriptions illustrate crypto-Jewish behavior (appendix B).”\n\n–pp. 55-56, Jews and Muslims in British Colonial America © Elizabeth Caldwell Hirschman and Donald N.
