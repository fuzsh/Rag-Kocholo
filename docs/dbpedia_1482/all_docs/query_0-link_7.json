Esther died in 1688, she was 25. Esther married Charles DICKINSON.\n\n29. Capt. Samuel GILBERT. Born on 5 Aug 1664 in Hartford, CT.[50],[51],[52] Samuel died in Paugwonk, in Lyme, New Salem, CT on 5 Aug 1773, he was 109.[50],[51],[52],[53] Religion: owned the covenant of First Church of Hartford, 19 October 1686.[53] Residence: Colchester, CT.\n\nSamuel Gilbert, while in Hartford, seems to have assisted his mother in carrying on the inn, but he did not neglect public duty. He was a member of the militia, as every able-bodied man upwards of sixteen years of age was obliged by law to be. In October, 1698, he was commissioned Ensign of the North Train Band at Hartford. In July, 1705, he sold land in Hartford to his brother, Thomas Gilbert of Boston, mariner. He sold the inn property in Hartford to Captain Caleb Williamson, who had come from Barnstable, MA, to Hartford. About the same time he leased to William Worthington a place on the highway running south from Wyllys Street in Hartford. Worthington bought the property in 1709 and kept an inn there until his removal to Colchester in 1717. This estate lay east of the South Green in Hartford, known now as Brenard Park. An inn was kept there for many years after Worthington left it, probably by Amos Hindale.\n\nSoon after this, perhaps in 1706, Ensign Gilbert removed himself and family to Colchester. In May 1707, he was confirmed the Captain of the Train band in Colchester. In 1709 he was Captain of a company in Colonel William Whiting's regiment in an expedition to Canada.\n\n\"Roll of Col. William Whiting's Regiment, 1709. An accompt of Bounty Paid Coll Whiting's Regiment on the Late Expedition formed against Canada, 1709. The Colls. Perticular Compa. Capt. Samuel Gilbert $2.\" [54]\n\nOn April 8, 1724, Capt Samuel Gilbert, then of Lyme but late of Colchester, sold to Joseph Otis of Scituate, Mass., for $770 \"all my farm in Colchester, 280 acres.\" In the same month he gave or sold land to his son, Nathaniel Gilbert. He had removed to Paugwonk within the limits of Lyme. Paugwonk, consisting of territory partly in Colchester, partly in Lyme, became the town of Salem in 1803. The efforts of the inhabitants there to obtain convenient parish privileges is shown by the following docoments:\n\n\"Petitions of Several Inhabitants of Lyme and Colchester, bordering on North Parish in New London. Your petitioners, being at so great a distance from ye Place of Publick Worship of God on ye Lord's Day in our respective Towns yt but few of them and those with great Difficulty, can attend Upon it there; and living so near to ye Place whereabouts we conclude the meeting house in ye said North Parish in New London will be erected, yt ye most of us may be able in a constant way to attend ye worship of God there, We therefore humbly desire that we may be annexed to and made a part of ye said North Parrish.\"\n\nThis petition is preserved in CT Archives, Ecclesiastical, vol. 3, doc. 131, was signed by the autographs of eight men, and was presented to the General Assembly at the May session of 1722. The signature of Captain Samuel Gilbert, clearly made and elegantly formed, followed after the first signature on the petition, that of Col. Samuel Brown of Salem, MA, the largest (absentee) landowner in the vicinity, proprietor of about 3,000 acres.\n\nAnother petition was presented to the Assembly May 13, 1725, this time asking for the establishment of a new parish in Paugwonk, and bears the names (not all autographs) of seventeen signers, of whom Capt. Samuel Gilbert was one.\n\nIn October, 1725, thomas Gustin was Society Clerk, showing that the parish (not the church) had been legally organized.\n\nIn May, 1726, the society was legally called New Salem, no doubt in honor of Col. Samuel Brown of Salem, MA, its largest landowner. About this time Colonel Brown sent a cordial letter to the inhabitants of the new parish, expressing his good wishes at the good work they were ingaged in and telling them to draw upon him to the extent of œ50.\n\nMay 30, 1726, another petition, signed by thirty-eight names, was sent to the General Assembly, among which the name of Samuel Gilbert comes first. The parish, owing to its small numbers and low estate had great difficulty in settling a minister. It was some years before the first minister, Rev. Joseph Lovett, was settled. There exists, however, a warrent ordering James Harris, Jr., collector of the parish called New Salem, to collect \"the minister's rate herein delivered unto you and to pay unto the Revd. Mr. Samuel Seabury the sume of œ52,15,6. you are forthwith to gather the onehalf part and to pay it to Mr. Seabury. Per order of John Holmes, Samuel Gilbertt, comtt.\" The rate bill on which the foregoing order is written contains thirty-seven names. Lieutenant Harris' and Captain Gilbert's names appear as the largest taxpayers.\n\nRev. Samuel Seabury, here mentioned, afterwards became a Church of England minister and had pastoral charge of a number of parishioners, scattered over a considerable territory in eastern CT, who owned connection with a church established at Hebron, CT, about 1738, or with St. James Church in New London.\n\nJoshua Hempstead of New London, in his Diary, writes of lodging at Gilbert's, at Paugwonk. On Monday, August 6, 1733, Hempstead entered this: \"Capt. Samuel Gilbert att Paugwonk died yesternight.\" Captain Gilbert left no will and no administration or distribution of his estate seems to be extant. Captain Gilbert's gravestone, much broken and decayed, might have been seen in a neglected field east of the road running south through the New Salem Parish, somewhat south of the old meetinghouse, now standing, but abandoned. A new stone has been erected by descendants in recent years.\n\nAnother entry in Hempstead's Diary, under a date of Jan. 5, 1741/2, page 387 of the printed volume, is of interest. Hempstead wrote: \"I was at home all Day till evening. I went to Madm. Christophers to hear a young man preach that is stark blind and hath been so many years, his name is Prince of Boston. His mother was Capt. Samuel Gilbert's daughter, late of New Salem deceased. he is going to see his uncle at Southhold.\"\n\nThe mother of this young blind preacher is supposed to have been Mary Gilbert, daughter of Capt. Samuel Gilbert, born Dec. 3, 1696. No other daughter appears who could have been the mother of the young man Hempstead mentions, as far as known. His father has not been identified among the inhabitants of Boston bearing the name of Prince. His Uncle at Southold may have been the brother of his father or of his mother. If the latter, he was a Gilbert, but no son of Capt. Samuel Gilbert is known who could have been the young man's uncle, unless he was the Jonathan Gilbert born June 29, 1685. But this Jonathan is supposed to have died young. In January, 1742, Mary, daughter of Captain Samuel Gilbert, if then living, was forty-six years of ages and could have had a grown son at that date. The sons of Captain Gilbert, Nathaniel, John and Daniel, are not known to have ever resided at Southold.\n\nThe following is taken from Lyme, CT, volume 5, p.227:\n\nA deed of Capt. Samuel Gilbert's negro man.\n\nTo all people unto whome these presente Bill of Sale shall come Gilbert Bant of Boston in ye country of Suffolk and Province of ye Massachutes Bay in New England, merchant, sendeth greeting.
