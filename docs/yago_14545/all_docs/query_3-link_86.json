        "text": "The past 1 year has been a life altering experience for me. Breaking away from my usual advertising, short films and feature domains, I completed my first documentary film. It is one of the most defining projects of my life – a 75 min. documentary feature on the quintessential film auteur – Saeed Mirza – The Leftist Sufi.\n\nSaeed, fondly referred to as Angry Young Man, is considered to be one of the pioneers of parallel cinema in India during the late 20th Century. Drawing from his emotions, poetry, dilemmas, angst and epiphanies in search of the ever changing reality, the documentary covers Saeed’s indefatigable journey as a human being and a film maker.\n\nThis is the same man who wrote and Directed classics such as Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon aata hai, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro, Mohan Joshi Haazir Ho and the inimitable popular TV series NUKKAD.\n\nSaeed has also passionately championed various causes, lending strong support against human rights violations and intolerance, fighting for an egalitarian society. Paradoxically termed “Leftist Sufism\", Saeed adheres to key leftist values of pluralism and inclusiveness, wrapped with a mystic Sufism, unique to the man's charismatic persona.\n\nSeveral eminent and contemporary film makers eulogise Saeed and his work that left an indelible mark on Indian cinema. Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, Kundan Shah and Aziz Mirza are among the few of the stalwarts who have been mentored by Saeed. They talk about how Saeed provoked society holding out the mirror to the society, chronicling it fearlessly.\n\nThis documentary traverses with Saeed from the harsh, unforgiving underbelly of Mumbai to the vast tranquil spaces of Ladakh. In this visual contrast, we see the transition of Saeed, a filmmaker filled with angst, to a calmer, poetic guiding light. The world is perhaps moving further away from Saeed’s ideals of a compassionate and humane place. Saeed feels poetry is missing, but also firmly believes it can be retrieved.\n\nI really enjoyed making this film and I thank my co-director and partner – N. Padmakumar for lending his talent and sensitive support which made the journey even more soulful, immersive and enjoyable.\n\nEvery moment with this beautiful soul called Saeed Akhtar Mirza was sheer power, vibrancy, provocation and bliss.\n\nThe documentary is now available on NETFLIX: https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80182105"
