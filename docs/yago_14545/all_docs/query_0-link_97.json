The poster shows Manav looking angrily at the camera and also defines anger.\n\nSoumitra Ranade will direct the new film that is slated to hit theatres on April 12. Directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, the original film starred Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil in lead roles.\n\nAlso read: Happy Birthday Janhvi Kapoor: Sara Ali Khan wishes her with glam pic, Sonam Kapoor sends love to her ‘baby Jannu’\n\nTaran Adarsh tweeted, “Manav Kaul, Nandita Das and Saurabh Shukla... #AlbertPintoKoGussaKyunAataHai - an official remake of the cult classic by Saeed Akhtar Mirza - to release on 12 April 2019... Directed by Soumitra Ranade...
