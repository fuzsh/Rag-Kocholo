        "text": "Scroll through OTT platforms and you will certainly spot a movie or series starring talented actor Manav Kaul. His recent performance in Netflix’s Ajeeb Daastaans and movie Saina has put him in the spotlight like never before. But the man who wears multiple hats — he’s a director, playwright, author, thespian, filmmaker and more — has been around the block for decades, known for his excellence in all that he does. Kaul will soon be seen in Finding Anamika, directed by Karishma Kohli and Bejoy Nambiar, alongside Madhuri Dixit Nene. Before that arrives, let’s re-watch some of his outstanding performances.\n\n9 Manav Kaul movies & shows you need to watch right now on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and Zee5\n\n1. Ajeeb Daastaans – Netflix\n\nThe Netflix anthology revolves around complex relationship equations. In “Ankahi”, he plays a photographer with a speech impediment who finds the company and easy conversation he wants in Shefali Shah. The movie’s central device is sign language, which Kaul and Shah are effortless at.\n\n2. Saina – Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe biographical sports film around badminton star Saina Nehwal, starring Parineeti Chopra, recently released on Netflix. The movie didn’t score very highly, but Manav Kaul’s performance as coach Pullela Gopichand has certainly left an impact.\n\n3. Tumhari Sulu – Amazon Prime Video\n\nImagining Tumhari Sulu without Manav Kaul is next to impossible. Suresh Triveni’s comedy-drama was a refreshing story that every person could relate to. The beautiful equation of a supportive husband and wife between Vidya Balan and Kaul was a treasure to watch. The movie showed Kaul dancing, singing, laughing – making it one of the best feel-good movies.\n\n4. Kai Po Che! – Netflix\n\nKai Po Che! wasn’t just the film that catapulted Sushant Singh Rajput, Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh to stardom. It also gave Manav Kaul the space to exhibit his greyer side, as a villainous right-wing politician.\n\n5. Jai Gangajaal – YouTube\n\nPrakash Jha’s Jai Gangajaal was the second installment in what was supposed to be a franchise. Priyanka Chopra took on the role of an IPS official, and she up against powerful MLA Babloo Pandey played by Manav Kaul. The officers of her department liaise with Pandey and her work is cut out for her. Chopra’s powerful performance and Kaul’s vicious act make it a solid watch.\n\n6. Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? – Netflix\n\nWhen Saeed Mirza’s 1980 classic cult movie Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai was remade in 2019, it featured Nandita Das, Manav Kaul and Saurabh Shukla. Albert Pinto goes missing one day, his girlfriend and family reach out to the police for an investigation. However, they are unaware that he is on his way to Goa to complete an assignment as a hitman. The act of vengeance is due to the angst he holds toward society.\n\n7. Madam Chief Minister – Netflix\n\nA new addition to the list is Madam Chief Minister. The chilling political drama starred Richa Chadda, Saurabh Shukla and Manav Kaul, the film is set in Uttar Pradesh, the movie shows Dalit politician Tara rising to power despite all the risk and struggle that comes to her way. Manav Kaul as Danish Khan is seen as a supportive aide, helping Tara rise to power against all odds. The movie is a bit of a bumpy watch, but the strong performances make up for some of it.\n\n8. Nail Polish – Zee5\n\nStarring Arjun Rampal and Manav Kaul, Nail Polish is a thrilling watch. Kaul who plays a decorated ex-army officer is accused of murdering migrant children, his lawyer Sid Jaisingh does everything to protect him and show another side of the story. Directer Bugs Bhargava Krishna’s is an edge-of-the-seat watch all thanks to the gripping script and both actor’s stunning performance.\n\n9. Ghoul – Netflix\n\nIf you are looking for horror, Netflix’s mini-series Ghoul is the right pick. Radhika Apte, Rohit Pathak and Manav Kaul in this series will certainly give you goosebumps. According to Arabic folklore, Ghoul is a demonic being believed to inhabit burial grounds and other deserted places. They belong to the class of spirits often referred to as jinn in Islam tradition. They feed on people’s bodies and souls and have the power to change forms. The story is set in a totalitarian near-future India, where a secretive and mysterious prisoner is sent to a remote military interrogation center. Things appear deceptively simple until he starts exposing people’s darkest and shameful secrets.\n\nBest Manav Kaul movies & shows on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Zee5, YouTube and Zee5"
