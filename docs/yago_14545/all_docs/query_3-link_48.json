        "text": "Prem would the ideal person to ANSWER this but I can HAZARD a guess.\n\nI have seen some others also doing this. The answers I got are a mixture of the following.\n\n-If you are an unbiased audiophile with an open mind, you will notice that after a certain level in digital audio, the sound is very analogue and natural sounding. The cost is high (unless you DIY) but if you can afford it, the result is extremely satisfying.\n\n-The question of what music you listen to and which format does most justice to your kind of music !\n\n-Availability of music for your choice of music.\n\n-How much you want to push your expenditure in a certain direction to achieve your minimum level of expectations. Most of the time it is easier to achieve a very high level of quality in the digital domain at a much lower cost than analogue.\n\n-Analogue is a tweakers domain. If you do not have the time or inclination, it can be a frustrating experience. Note: Most casual music lovers who play analogue will not agree to this statement but the sound from such casually setup analogue setups are a nightmare for an audiophile. It will sound very romantic and mushy but will be far away from what can be achieved by a dedicated audiophile.\n\n-Convenience\n\nhehehe! moktan! -\n\ni read the article through -\n\nhere is an excerpt -\n\n\"\"The way the industry is going, pretty soon there's not going to be any vinyl, there's not going to be any CDs,\" Weiland said. \"I've been doing this for 25 years. This is the biggest opportunity for change I've ever seen. It is what it is. We all love vinyl, we all love CDs. But how long do we want to fight over the same 300 customers that are left in ten years? We just can't do it. We've got to expand our base. We've got to get the young people who are interested in good sound and are interested in the new music, somehow we've got to infect them with the disease. Computer downloading and music playback from computer are the wave of the future.\"\n\nOr, as another attendee put it, \"Everything that's all-analog is obsolete.\"\n\nlooks like that Moktan!"
