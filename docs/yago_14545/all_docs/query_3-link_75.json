We have no biggies this time but some really intriguing stories up for release. You can enjoy four very different films - a thriller, a comedy-drama, a remake of the 1980s and a biopic.

Commenting on the story of the film the director Vivek said that it is going to be the country’s first crowd-sourced thriller.

He is noble from his childhood days due to his strict father and thus is an introvert person. He doesn’t have any experience of dealing with women and trudges along in his life. His father plans an arranged marriage for him and he can't have no for an answer. Marudhar marries a sweet and pretty girl from Lucknow named Chitra. But the twist comes when they are under the pressure of bearing a child right after their marriage. Marudhar sets on an emotional and equally entertaining journey as he tries to find his feet in the middle of love life, and family.\n\nIn case you missed it, here's the trailer of the film...\n\nAlbert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai\n\nCast: Manav Kaul, Nandita Das, Saurabh Shukla, Kishore Kadam, Atul Kale\n\nDirector: Soumitra Ranade\n\nSynopsis: The film is a remake of 1980's classic of the same name.

What she doesn't know is that Albert is traversing a road journey from Mumbai to Goa. Nayar who drives the vehicle accompanies him on his mission. Punctuating their cynical, witty and devastating conversations, we see Albert's flashbacks of a world where he and Stella try and weave a life together. Albert's anger stems from experiences that life has presented to him.
