        "text": "Mumbai puts on mask to show Modi his real face\n\nHundreds of Narendra Modis emerged at the Kherwadi traffic junction on the West ern Express Highway on January 12. In sharp contrast to the beaming Modis face staring at you all over Mumbai, this Modi looked like a devil, and had blood on his hands.\n\nThis was part of a unique spontaneous protest planned by citys Leftist groups this afternoon on the highway where Modis cavalcade was expected to pass en route to Shivaji Park. Young men and women wearing black Tshirts and jeans used a black and white sketch of Modi with devils teeth as a mask and painted their palms red to condemn Modis alleged role in the Gujarat riots.\n\nWe decided to organise the protest last night. And we just had to make a few calls. We are protesting as citizens of Mumbai, and not as any single organisation, explained Teesta Setalvad who edits magazine Communalism Combat.\n\nMore than 150 people participated in the protest, including journalists like Mahanagar editor Nikhil Wagle, Jatin Desai of Mumbai Union of Journalists, filmmakers Saeed Mirza, Anand Patwardhan, Chitra Palekar, activists like Neera Adarkar, Abhay Mehta, textile workers union leader Datta Iswalkar.\n\nWhats happening in this country? They are making a hero out of a man like Modi, said Mirza who has made critically acclaimed films like Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro, and Naseem.\n\nNikhil Wagle said: A devil doesnt become human just because he has been elected. He is a murderer and he should be punished. The fact that the BJP has invited him for a public felicitation means that they want another riot in Mumbai. But we will not allow another riot in this city.\n\nA little later, BJP supporters stopped their buses mid-way and began countering the protest group with slogans hailing Modi. Policemen and SRP platoons posted on the spot had a tough time controlling the mob as it threatened to turn violent.\n\nWhen Modi did not arrive till 6 p.m., the protesters began shouting Modi Dar Gaya, Bhag Gaya (Modi developed cold feet)\".\n\nAfter landing at the airport, Modi drove to (Hotel) Centaur before arriving at the RSS office at Shivaji Park before driving to the venue."
