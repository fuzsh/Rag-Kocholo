        "text": "Actor Manav Kaul, who has portrayed a character played by Naseeruddin Shah in the original Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? says the forthcoming movie is his tribute to the veteran actor.\n\nThe new rendition of cult classic Saeed Akhtar Mirza's film, Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? features Manav Kaul and Nandita Das.\n\nTalking about the film during his recent media interaction, Manav said, \"The story is completely different, though the spirit and name are the same as the old one, but the story is totally different. It is a different journey; it is a journey from Bombay to Goa. It is an edgy and entertaining film. The interpretation of this film is totally different and I thought, at least I love the name and it is very edgy, so I thought what could be a bigger tribute\"\n\n\"I consider this film is a tribute to Naseeruddin Shah because I love him. I have seen his plays, which I loved, I have seen his cinema, his performance and I love his seriousness on screen and he is one of the finest human beings. So, if I manage to get his 10% in performance, I'd consider myself lucky\"\n\nThe film is written and directed by Soumitra Ranade, the modern take of Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai explores the theme of personal and societal struggle in today's times.\n\nTalking about going from character artist to lead hero in films, Manav said, \"The level of responsibility goes up, especially when you're doing a character on whose shoulders the entire movie rests. I think when the time is right; you'd start getting right films, people have more confidence in you, and people start thinking that he can do more than what he is getting right now. So within this month alone two of my solo films are releasing, Albert Pinto and Music Teacher on Netflix\"\n\nAlbert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? Releases on April 12."
