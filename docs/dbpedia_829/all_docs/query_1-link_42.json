[4]\n\nLeft: This list of buildings is drawn from Harriet Edquist's 'Pioneers of Modernism'​\n\nGuyen Purchas\n\nArchitect Guyen Purchas was one of the most prominent architects in Melbourne around the turn of the century, one of the first to be influenced by the English Arts and Crafts movement, and helped to establish the journal Arts and Crafts in 1895.\n\n​\n\nRead more: Guyon Purchas - Wikipedia\n\nBoisdale Homestead\n\nBoisdale is situated on the Avon River 10 km north of Maffra and about 212 km east of Melbourne.\n\nThe Boisdale run, taken up for Lachlan Macalister in 1842, stretched from the Avon River west to the Macalister River.\n\nIt is thought to be named after a village in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.\n\nIn 1850, the lease was secured by John Foster, one of many runs he held in Gippsland.\n\nIn 1861 he still controlled about 6000 acres at Boisdale.\n\n​\n\nIn 1892 a son, Askin Foster, took over the management of the property. Previously thousands of cattle and sheep had been grazed on the undulating plains.\n\nFrom 1896 Askin Foster subdivided part of the property into smallholdings of 120 to 260 acres for dairy farming.\n\n1\n\nBoisdale Homestead, Maffra/Briagolong Road, Boisdale,1892\n\nBoisdale Homestead was erected in 1892 for Askin Morrison Foster, son of pioneer pastoralist John Foster, who leased the run in 1841.\n\nR G W Purchas, the Melbourne architect, designed the present single storey brick and timber residence with a steep broken pitch roof clad with Marseilles tiles and capped with a monitor skylight.\n\nBoisdale House, with its outbuildings and water tower, was built of handmade bricks. The roof was constructed from oregon pine and covered with tiles from Marseilles.\n\nThe V plan form and exterior form reflect American influences in the design.\n\nBoisdale Homestead 557\n\n702983983\n\nBoisdale Homestead 229\n\nBoisdale Homestead 557\n\n1/6\n\nBoisdale Homestead is a distinctive East Gippsland residence and a notable work of R G W (Guyon) Purchas, an innovative architect working in the late 19th century.\n\nThe style of Boisdale is clearly derived form contemorary American developments and contrasts with Purchas's revivalist work, of which his own house, Tay Creggan, in Hawthorn, is the most important.\n\n​\n\nBoisdale is an early settled pastoral run and the present residence is dramatically situated on a granite outcrop overlooking the Avon River.\n\nIn 1892 Askin Foster had a new house built on a ridge overlooking the plain. It was constructed of Hawthorn bricks and Marseilles tiles, with red pine used internally. The interior was finely crafted.\n\nIts modern design included electricity, running hot water and drainage.\n\nThe stables were equally modern, and of the same brick and tiles.\n\nSeven acres of garden and orchard surrounded the homestead. The estate, now reduced in size, including Boisdale homestead and outbuildings, are maintained intact and in excellent condition.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nVictoria Heritage Database - Boisdale Homestead\n\nBoisdale, Victoria - Wikipedia\n\nTay Creggan\n\nTay Creggan, 30 Yarra St, Hawthorn, VIC, 1892-1893\n\n2\n\nTay Creggan was built by the prominent Melbourne architect Robert Guyon Whittlesey Purchas (known as Guyon) as his own home.\n\nHe bought the land, a 1.5 hectare sloping site between the railway line and the Yarra River, in 1889 and built the house in 1891-2, but ran into financial difficulties at the beginning of the 1890s depression and sold the house in 1892.\n\nThe house was bought by Michael Spencer, whose family crest appears above the fireplace in the hall.\n\nPurchas designed a number of changes to the house for Spencer, including the conversion of the ballroom to a grand billiard room.\n\nFollowing Spencer's death in 1900 his widow married A H McKean, and the house was further altered, with the enlargement of the entrance hall and new stairs constructed.\n\nIn 1937 the house was purchased by the Catholic Church for the Sisters of the Holy Grail, who added the Tudor Hall and dormitories, now used as classrooms.\n\nIt was sold to the Baptist Union of Victoria in 1969 for use by Strathcona Girls School, and is now their Year 9 campus.\n\nSince then extensions and renovation works have been carried out, including the replacement of the roof tiles and the addition of a large new kitchen in place of the original.\n\n​\n\nTay Creggan_Hawthorn_front gates 499\n\nTay creggan rt69496-32380\n\nTay Creggan_Hawthorn 504\n\nTay Creggan_Hawthorn_front gates 499\n\n1/15\n\nTay Creggan is a picturesque asymmetrical red brick two storey Victorian Queen Anne Revival style house set amidst spacious grounds overlooking the Yarra River.\n\n​\n\nThe roof is elaborated with turrets, and with dormers and gablets with finely-worked barge boards and finials, and is covered with Marseilles pattern tiles and terracotta ridging.\n\nThe red brick walls have rough-cast with brown woodwork on the front facade, and the windows are casements with small diamond-paned leadlights.\n\nThe house is notable for its fine detailing, including\n\nthe slender decorative chimneys characteristic of the Elizabethan period,\n\nthe weather vane on the candle-snuffer roof of one of the turrets, and\n\nthe small entrance porch with scalloped tiles.\n\nInternally a number of the rooms are interesting for their timbered ceilings, fireplaces, ingle-nooks and bays.\n\nThe staircase is of finely worked kauri timber and the landing has a notable stained glass window by William Montgomery depicting a hunting scene, with contrasting art nouveau decoration above.\n\nThe most outstanding room is the billiard room, which is remarkable for the three stained glass domes above, the enormous Scottish Oak fireplace with Art Nouveau style copper repousse work, and the carved decoration of the roof timbers, which have carved dragons on the beam ends.\n\nThere are several former servants' rooms in the attic. The house retains its original entrance gates and driveway, a row of Bhutan Cypresses along Yarra Street, and some original terracing in the garden area to the east of the house.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nTay Creggan is a National Treasure - Jenny Brown Domain FEB 21, 2012\n\nThe History of Tay Creggan - Strathcona Baptist Girls School\n\nVictorian Heritage Database - Tay Creggan (Strathcona Baptist Girls School)\n\nPastoria Homestead\n\nPastoria Homestead, 589 Baynton Road Pastoria, Macedon Ranges, 1890s\n\n3\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNestled in the foothills of Australia's Great Dividing Range, Pastoria Homestead at Currabubula Station offers a unique experience of the Australian countryside.\n\nPastoria Homestead is predominantly an Arts and Crafts styled building developed in two main stages.\n\nThe first stage consists of a simple single storey homestead building which is now subsumed into the present building.\n\nThe second stage of development occurred c.1890 and constitutes the present form.\n\nPastoria has an attic-gable, an open ground level verandah and enclosed rear verandah.\n\nThe interior contains a wide upstairs gallery overlooking the living area and the drawing and dining-rooms have been decorated with Arts and Crafts wall-papers.\n\n​\n\nWhilst Australian architecture was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement early in the 20th century, Pastoria demonstrates very early influences of the stylistic movement, having been constructed late in the late 19th century.\n\nPastoria is architecturally advanced and largely intact; the interiors have been skilfully executed and finely finished.\n\nPastoria retains many of its original 1890s wallpapers and also its superb full length French windows which open out into the garden once tended by Chinese gardeners.\n\nThe collapse of the economy in the 1890s resulted in a substantial decrease in building activities and thus Pastoria is of significance for its use of stylistic elements which were uncommon at the time due to economic depression.\n\nPastoria was the residence of early pastoralist George Govett who bought the run in 1853 from William Piper.\n\nBetween 1853 and 1854 Govett secured a pre-emptive right to the 640 acre homestead block and constructed a single-storey weatherboard homestead.\n\nIn the late 1850s and the 1860s, Kyneton flourished as a result of gold mining activities.\n\nThe area had been mainly a rural district, however as people made their way to the gold fields the size and wealth of the township grew.\n\nGovett died in 1888 and J.B. Watson junior, the son of mining magnate and financial investor John Boyd Watson, purchased Pastoria with his inheritance money.\n\nAlthough Victoria was in a state of depression, building works soon followed with the erection of a first floor attic and the remodelling of many of the ground floor rooms; these works led to the present form of Pastoria.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nPastoria Homestead\n\nVictorian Heritage Database: Pastoria Homestead\n\nPurrumbete Homestead\n\n4\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPurrumbete aerial\n\n3551-Princes-Highway-Camperdown-VIC-3260\n\nPurrumbete Front\n\nPurrumbete aerial\n\n1/7\n\nPurrumbete was established by the brothers John and Peter Manifold in 1839, when they became squatters on the land around Lake Purrumbete.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century the Manifold family became one of the largest landholders in Victoria, and Purrumbete developed into a substantial and prosperous farming complex, accommodating the growing demands of cattle, sheep and later bullock and dairy farming.\n\nA small house was first constructed on the site of the present homestead in 1842, and in 1857-1860 a large bluestone wing was added, part of which remains.\n\nMajor additions which doubled the size of the homestead were made in 1882 to designs by the Camperdown architect, Alexander Hamilton.\n\nThe resulting single storey bluestone Italianate style house included a verandah with elaborate ironwork and an extensive cellar.\n\nIn 1884 an elaborate conservatory was constructed at the western end of the house.\n\nBy the early 1890s at least twenty outbuildings had been constructed at Purrumbete, all built in timber except for the bluestone men's quarters. The Manifolds made good use of the lake as a water resource, and installed an advanced water reticulation system.\n\nIn 1901 architect Guyon Purchas was commissioned by W.T. Manifold to again enlarge and modify the house, resulting in a highly unusual Federation Arts and Crafts style building.\n\nThe most significant changes were made to the rooms along the front wing with addition of a first floor, the inclusion of a substantial hall with minstrel's gallery, and the modification of the drawing room.\n\nExternally the resulting homestead is Arts and Crafts in character, with remnants of the earlier phases evident.\n\nThe textured bluestone and red brick building is highly asymmetrical in composition with dominant multi-gabled roofs containing dormer windows, and encircling verandas.\n\nDetailing includes terracotta shingles in gable ends and bulbous terracotta veranda columns, exaggerated timber brackets and dressed with bluestone quoining and architraves.\n\nDecorative Art Nouveau lamps remain at the porch steps.\n\n​\n\nPurrumbete Great Hall 1\n\nPurrumbete Drawing room\n\n3551-Princes-Highway-Camperdown-VIC-3260\n\nPurrumbete Great Hall 1\n\n1/6\n\nInternally the mains spaces are Arts ad Crafts in character with Art Nouveau detailing.\n\nExtensive timber work, such as panelled walls and ceilings, frieze brands, sliding doors, screens, newell posts, fire surrounds, overmantles and inglenook seats, and metal work incorporate sinuous details.\n\nThe timber fittings were crafted by Melbourne joiners, Murray and Crow, between 1902 and 1904 and, together with the metal work, were probably designed by Guyon Purchas.\n\nManifold commissioned the leading Heidelberg School artist, Walter Wither, to executive six paintings depicting the early settlement and development of the family at Purrumbete, to line the main hall of the homestead.\n\nRead more:\n\nPurrumbete, with its Walter Withers farming murals, sold in Victoria’s Western Districts By Jonathan Chancellor Thursday, 14 February 2013\n\nSix Walter Withers murals – with a 10-bedroom Victoria Western District homestead thrown in – listed for $6 million By Jonathan Chancellor Thursday, 03 May 2012\n\nPurrumbete Homestead - Sydney Morning Herald\n\nPurrumbete Homestead, Camperdown - Walking Melbouren\n\nVictorian Heritage Database - Purrumbete Homestead\n\nDomain Property Report: 3551 Princes Highway, Camperdown, VIC, 3260\n\nLater Arts and Crafts Houses\n\nLater Federation Era\n\nArts and Crafts Houses in Victoria\n\nHarold Desbrowe-Annear\n\nHarold Desbrowe-Annear was an influential Australian architect who was at the forefront of the development of the Arts and Crafts movement in this country.

Yet . . . he’s not quite finished.\n\nThere is one side of the house still to be excavated by removing a Federation (i.e. 1919) tack-on extension.\n\nWhen that comes off, the vision of one of Melbourne’s most notable Arts and Crafts architects, Harold Desbrowe Annear, will be fully revealed in its richly detailed and lyrically woody splendour.\n\nThe ceiling beams are Douglas fir from Oregon; the interior panels are Sequoia, from California’s giant redwoods – aged claret. “Dark, but we like it,” says artist Jane Crone.\n\nTheir beautiful, flowing “unusually open-plan” home known as “the Chadwick House” by National Trust and Heritage Victoria, is the middle of three similar classified Arts and Crafts houses designed by Annear for himself, for his father-in-law, and for the Officer family. All share incredible north-eastern views to the Dandenongs.\n\nPeter Crone has his now-practiced eye for the way one of his architectural heroes crafted unique houses on a new project to restore another Annear house. It will be another mightily protracted renovation, yet he has already started in with a crowbar.\n\nLast year, his mother-in-law Margaret Bennett bought Annear’s own home, the one just up the hill and the first thing Crone uncovered was the architect’s studio on the lower floor.\n\nHe broke unsympathetic add-on bathrooms and bedrooms to reveal the bones of the big square room in which Annear worked 100 years ago. “Quite unique. Wonderful,” he marvels.\n\nIt’s an understatement when it comes to describing Arts and Crafts houses in any respect. They resulted from an aesthetic movement – born initially in Britain in the late 1800s but a movement that found expression in many Western countries – as a reaction against the mass production of the industrial era.\n\n​\n\nChadwick House, 32-34 The Eyrie, was designed in 1904 by the architect Harold Desbrowe Annear for his father-in-law, James Chadwick.\n\nThe house is a two-storey, Medieval inspired Arts and Crafts style building with half-timbered roughcast walls, a hipped and gabled Marseilles-patterned tile roof, arcaded chimney stacks and cantilevered gables. Internally the house has extensive timber panelling with built-in furniture and storage space.\n\nChadwick House has the half-timbered rough- cast walls the hipped and gabled marseilled-pattern tile roof arcaded chimney stacks and cantilevered gables.\n\nThe swagged and ogee-arch slatted balustrading to its balconies and the overall picturesque disposition of elements have been borrowed from northern European 14th and 15th century domestic styles.\n\nThese are exemplified in the white rough cast and black stained timbering (i.e. black and white houses) both internally and externally it may be seen as an early example of medieval revival style unique to Heidelberg.\n\n​\n\nchadwick house eaglemont front view 249.\n\nChadwick house\n\nChadwick House Eaglemont\n\nchadwick house eaglemont front view 249.\n\n1/9\n\nJames Chadwick owned this house after its construction and leased it to a civil servant Charles Stanesby until he himself became the occupier in 1907. A later occupier was Arthur V Walker.\n\n​\n\nChadwick House is architecturally significant as an outstanding example of the work of eminent and influential architect Harold Desbrowe Annear.\n\nAnnear was instrumental in introducing the open plan form into Australian domestic architecture and Chadwick House, along with 28-30 The Eyrie and 36-38 The Eyrie, is an early example of his work which demonstrates this Modernist doctrine.\n\n​\n\n\"Our first project was to restore the vandalised main Living Room area.\n\nThe original sequoia timber paneling,window brackets and fireplace surround and overmantle had been removed.Timber fragments found beneath the house assisted in gaining an understanding of Annear's original detailing.

[5]\n\nThe house was constructed in the Arts and Crafts idiom, finished with a distinctive render with pebbles pushed into the surface (pebble-dash).\n\nThis finish was complemented by a terracotta shingle roof.\n\nThe interior contains many distinctive Arts and Crafts features, such as carved woodwork, stained glass and beaten metal ornamentation.\n\n​\n\nThe 2420-square-metre estate surrounding the home accommodates a tennis court, pool and several private garden zones. The elevated block captures distant easterly views to the Dandenongs.\n\nGlyn is architecturally significant as one of the finest examples of Arts and Crafts movement architecture in Victoria, and for its associations with one of the movement’s best practitioners, Rodney Alsop (1881-1932).\n\nAlsop was influenced by English architects such as Voysey and Lutyens who in turn were working in the tradition established by Ruskin and Morris in the 1850s.\n\nAlsop was a founding member of the Arts and Crafts Society of Victoria and played a major role in the introduction of the style into Victoria in the early 1900s.\n\nArchitecturally, the Arts and Crafts movement emphasised\n\npicturesque massing,\n\nreferences to vernacular architecture and\n\nthe exposure of building materials and textures.\n\nAll these elements are evident in Glyn.\n\nThe original fireplaces, light fittings, switch plates and joinery were rare examples of English arts and crafts influence in Australia, although some of these features have been lost in alterations in recent decades.\n\nThe arts and crafts influence is further reflected in the different decorative treatment of each room.\n\nAn interesting Australian touch is the eucalypt decorative scheme in the main hall, stair hall, entrance hall and upstairs gallery.\n\nAs a committed Arts and Crafts practitioner, Alsop not only designed houses, he engaged in their decoration, with built-in furniture, carved woodwork, stained glass of his own design, and beaten metal ornamentation often made with his own hands.\n\nAlsop envisaged his houses as all-encompassing designs and works of art, and Glyn is a fine instance of this philosophy.\n\nStonnington - City of Malvern Heritage Study\n\nAuthor: Nigel Lewis and Richard Aitken P/L\n\nYear: 1992\n\nGrading: A1\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nVictorian Heritage Database - Glyn\n\nYou Wish: A $12 million-plus mansion in Toorak - MARC PALLISCO, MAY 20, 2016\n\nSales Listing and Photographs Nov 2016\n\nThe Gables\n\n11\n\nArchitect Walter Butler's nearby commissions:\n\nAbove: Myrniong (1907), and below;\n\nMurndal Homestead Extensions (1906)\n\nThe Gables, 69 French St Hamilton VIC, 1908​\n\nA very English version of the Federation style, the house was probably designed by Walter Butler and has important associations with leading townsmen.\n\nThis building has regional significance for its architectural interest as a fine example of the Queen Anne style, and for its historical associations with Harold Learmonth (1863-1933) of Peter Learmonth & Co., stock and station agents and auctioneers, a prominent Hamilton townsman and mayor.\n\n​\n\nThe Gables was probably designed by the leading society architect, Walter Butler.

They would remain an influence on each other throughout their careers.\"\n\nThe friendship between Butler, Lethaby, Cimson, Schultz and the Barnsleys formed a key coterie in the London Arts and Crafts movement.\" [6]\n\n​\n\nWalter Richmond Butler (1864-1949), architect, was born on 24 March 1864 at Pensford St Thomas, Somerset, England, fourth son of Henry Butler, farmer, and his wife Mary Yeoman, née Harding.\n\nButler showed an early talent for sketching and at 15 was articled to Alexander Lauder of Barnstaple.\n\nIn 1885 W. R. Lethaby encouraged Butler to move to London and work with J. D. Sedding. He was accepted into the arts and crafts and domestic revival circles centred on William Morris and R. N. Shaw, among whom his closest friend was Ernest Gimson (1864-1919).\n\nIn June 1888 Butler left Sedding's office and sailed for Australia, perhaps at the prompting of the young Melbourne architect Beverley Ussher then visiting London.\n\nFrom 1889 until 1893 Butler was in partnership with Ussher. In 1896 he was joined by George C. Inskip but they parted in 1905 after a dispute with the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects over the conduct of a competition.\n\n​\n\nAbove: Butler family and friends at ‘Avalon’; Tom Watson, Walter Butler, Harry Butler, Howard Butler, A.

Butler, which briefly included Marcus Martin. In the late 1930s Butler was in partnership with Hugh Pettit, but he retired when Pettit enlisted for World War II.\n\n​\n\nButler was rightly considered an architect of great talent, and many of his clients were wealthy pastoralists and businessmen. His country-house designs include\n\nBlackwood (1891), near Penshurst, for R. B. Ritchie,\n\n(the Richie family sold out for $14.5801 million in February 2014 to Chinese interests:\n\nRifa Salutary, the Australian arm of China's Zhejiang Rifa Holding Group)\n\nWangarella (1894), near Deniliquin, New South Wales, for Thomas Millear (destroyed by fire Sunday 1 Dec 1935), and\n\nNewminster Park (1901) near Camperdown, 'A Folly' for A.

Members of the Pratt dynasty are planning a $10 million renovation and extension of their heritage mansion Thanes that will span six house blocks along Monaro and Avenel roads.\n\nMelbourne packaging billionaire Raphael Geminder and his wife Fiona, daughter of late Visy Group chairman Richard Pratt, have paid millions to buy and demolish five neighbouring homes over the years to make enough room for the sprawling abode.\n\nThe approved extension plans include a 12-car garage with car wash, gymnasium, at least three swimming pools, theatre, staff quarters and a separate wing for their four children.\n\nRead more:\n\nFirst there was Raheen, now the Pratt family goes one (or two) better -

Butler at the turn of the century built a ﬁne home for himself and his wife, who was Millicent Howard, ot the Howards who established a grazing property east of the city, named Studley Park.\n\nButler named his Toorak house Studley, but its character changed to a remarkable degree about 1918 when he had the idea of adding some ﬂats to it.\n\nHe built some on the tennis court,\n\na few more on the main block near the house and\n\nalso turned the house proper into a series of maisonettes.\n\nThis man however was no speculator. He was not in search of a fast buck, it seems; his aim was more in line with creating a garden setting where “respectable” people (vetted by Butler himself) could live in peace and tranquillity.\n\n​\n\n16\n\n9-41 Tintern Avenue, Toorak VIC 3142-h83\n\n9-41 Tintern Avenue, Toorak VIC 3142--w1\n\n10-41 Tintern Avenue Toorak, Vic\n\n9-41 Tintern Avenue, Toorak VIC 3142-h83\n\n1/11\n\nThe idea took otf. and Butler’s ﬂats were always in demand. He did not sell his ﬂats, preferring to rent them to the right folk, among them in later years being Dame Nellie Melba.\n\nButler wrote to her in 1924 asking if she would care to become a tenant, and she wrote back from Coombe’ Cottage, Coldstrearn saying how delighted she was with his proposition.\n\nSoon alter that. she did agree to rent a flat and her letter of acceptance was produced for our perusal by the present owner of in. who sent us a copy of it and a later note from her to Mr Butler inviting him to dinner and the opera, but also asking him to tell his gardener not to mix red and magnolia ﬂowers in the grounds “quite so much”.\n\n​\n\nStudley is a complex of early flats which particularly exemplifies changing attitudes and a semi-servantless lifestyle as developed by the end of the Great War.\n\nIt comprises the earlier house of the architect Walter Butler as converted by him into flats in 1918, together with\n\na new detached block to Tintern Avenue of the same date,\n\nand extensions to the west and a detached flat, (The Cottage) apparently conceived at the time and executed soon afterwards,\n\ntogether with various ancillary spaces, stairs, cellars and\n\nthe large courtyard garden with its terrace, fountain and decorative ceramic plaques.\n\n​\n\nThe flats have suffered some re-subdivision and remodelling, but are still characterised internally by late Arts and Crafts detailing such as\n\nledged and braced doors,\n\nbeaten brasswork and\n\nstained timber.\n\nThe Tintern Avenue block especially is notable for forward-looking labour-saving gadgetry such as\n\ndouble-sided doors and hatches,\n\nrubbish bins located so as to be removable from an exterior hatchway,\n\nand a remarkable set of milk delivery boxes with adjustable pointers to indicate the numbers of bottles required.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nNational Trust - Studley (Park Flats)\n\nMarathon, Mt Eliza\n\nMarathon, 12 Marathon Drive Mount Eliza, 1914​\n\nMarathon, constructed in 1914, is significant because of the relationship between house and garden.\n\nDesigned by the architectural partnership Butler and Bradshaw, with substantial extensions designed by Walter and Richard butler in 1924, it is an interesting example of a large beachside residence designed in the Arts and Crafts manner.\n\nDesigned with substantial extensions by Walter and Richard butler in 1924, it is an interesting example of a large beachside residence designed in the Arts and Crafts manner.​\n\nBelow: Timber cottage in Arts and Crafts style with roughcast walls and half-timbered and roughcast gable ends in the English domestic revival manner, for Major Grimwade.\n\nArchitect's name: Butler + Bradshaw, Architects, 413 Collins St. Melbourne 1909\n\n17\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nWoburn Cottage\n\n18\n\nWoburn Cottage, 6-8 Redesdale Road Ivanhoe, 1911​\n\nWoburn is a large example of the half-timbered Arts and Crafts style, popular in Heidelberg and Ivanhoe in the early 20th century.

An area of natural bushland east of the house was retained.\n\n​\n\nWith the onset of World War II Australia's supply of many essential plant-derived drugs was cut off, and Grimwade, with the aid of the Federal Government, obtained seed from England and cultivated at Westerfield crops of poppies, foxgloves, deadly nightshade, henbane and colchicum.\n\nHe constructed a drying shed, and with the resources of the family firm's laboratories developed extraction techniques to produce many of the drugs essential for Australia's war effort.\n\nThe poppy seed grown at Westerfield was distributed to farms around Australia, and was able to satisfy all of Australia's morphine requirements until after the war.\n\nGrimwade was knighted in 1950. The property was sold and subdivided after his death. The Westerfield estate is now on 14 hectares and incorporates a house, garden, paddocks, dam and bushland.\n\nBushland owners to fight bid for overpass\n\nSimon and Joyce Welsh, who own Westerfield in Frankston South, have been battling for two years to keep their bushland, home to more than 200 native plant species, birds and mammals, since the Government decided to extend EastLink via Frankston.\n\n​\n\nThey have nurtured the property, with gardens and bush area, formerly owned by pharmaceutical entrepreneur Sir Russell Grimwade, for the past 50 years and are devastated at the possible loss of an environmental asset that also includes a wading dam, created by Sir Russell, home to many birds of state significance.\n\n​\n\n''The loss of the birds' habitat would be dreadful but also the connectivity with other reserves in the area,'' Mrs Welsh said.\n\nShe said Sir Russell valued his bushland, as did she and her husband, which was why they were prepared to fight to maintain it for future generations.\n\nAlso of importance was the fact that Sir Russell, an environmentalist, had kept the land intact rather than clearing it.\n\nThe two storey Arts and Crafts style house has ground floor walls of uncoursed locally-quarried granite rubble and a half timber and stucco upper floor.\n\nThe plan is unconventional with three wings radiating out from a central stair hall. The house has no corridors, and many rooms have unusual shapes. The interior is remarkably intact, with many original details such as built-in furniture and door furniture.\n\nMuch use was made of stained timber, for floors, skirtings, architraves, doors and built-in cupboards, but some is now painted white.\n\nA small timbered tower containing a water tank rises from the centre of the cement-tiled roof. In the angle between two wings is an east-facing semicircular porch, now glassed in, axially aligned to the main garden\n\npath.\n\nAbove the porch is a balustraded deck, intended as a lookout towards Westernport Bay. To the south of the house are a caretaker's cottage and a garage.\n\nThe landscape still reflects the original design, with distinct but integrated features. A driveway lined with Corymbia maculata leads to the house. To the west is Grimwade's eucalypt paddock, with many species of gums remaining, including Corymbia ficifolia, Eucalyptus saligna, E. cladocalyx, and E. sideroxylon.​\n\nTo the east of the house is a long formal garden with a terraced lawn, flower beds, a fuchsia hedge, and a lily pond at the north end. The garden retains many of Grimwade's plantings, including a crab apple (Malus floribunda), Washington thorn, two old Lilacs and a Liquidamber. 'Sunny South' roses, which were once grown\n\ncommercially on the property have been transplanted to the garden from the paddock where they were grown.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nNational Trust - Westerfield\n\nVictoria Heritage Database - Westerfield and Garden\n\nArchived - Architect Harold Desbrowe-Annear\n\nLittle Milton\n\nLittle Milton, 26 Albany Road Toorak, Stonnington City, 1926\n\n​\n\n20\n\nNothing little about Milton, or its neighbours\n\nMARC PALLISCO - MAY 7, 2011\n\n‘‘Little Milton’’, the luxurious Toorak house of late businessman and Corona group executive John Batkin, hit the market this week.\n\n​\n\nThe circa-1926, five-bedroom mansion at 26 Albany Road, said to be Toorak’s most expensive street, is at the north-east corner of Whernside Avenue.\n\n​\n\nA tennis court was installed recently atop a 12-car underground garage.\n\nLittle Milton has an overall block size of 2476 square metres.\n\n​\n\nLittle Milton 902\n\nVHD 903\n\n26 Albany Road, Toorak image10\n\nLittle Milton 902\n\n1/20\n\nEdna Walling, Landscaper\n\nEncouraged by her mother, Edna studied at the School of Horticulture, Burnley, gaining her government certificate in December 1917.\n\nShe then began work as a jobbing gardener around Melbourne.\n\nAsked by an architect to plan a garden, she jumped at the opportunity. More commissions followed and by the early 1920s she had built a flourishing practice in garden design.\n\nEdna developed a sophisticated style, which attracted an equally sophisticated clientele, and rapidly became the leading exponent of the art in Victoria.\n\nSoon her reputation spread to other States. Her regular gardening columns (1926-46) in Australian Home Beautiful enhanced her reputation and extended her influence. She also contributed articles to other magazines.\n\n​\n\nLittle Milton is was built in 1926 on two allotments subdivided from the former Whernside estate.\n\nThe house was designed in the Old English/Arts and Crafts style by Muriel Stott (1889-1985) in association with the architectural firm Stephenson and Meldrum for the Moran family who were prominent in the grocery business.\n\nIt is claimed that Stott, whose family conducted a business college, modelled the house on Great Milton, a large residence in the Cotswolds.\n\nShe had previously designed Rainbow End (1918) in Olinda for the Morans who were family friends. Little Milton was her largest commission and her last work in Australia before she emigrated to South Africa.\n\nThe two storeyed house is of brick with ochred stucco. The roof is tiled.\n\nThere is an attached garage to the north which forms an integral part of the design.\n\n​\n\nThe landscape design is by Edna Walling and features the extensive use of red brick paving.\n\nThere is a timber pergola which is about half its original length and in poor physical condition.\n\nApart from mature larger trees, some of which predate the house, the garden planting has not survived.\n\nLittle Milton is of architectural significance as an outstanding example of an Old English/Arts and Crafts style, inter-war mansion.\n\nIts massing and detailing are skilfully executed and\n\nthe house sits comfortably in its landscaped environs,\n\nalthough, perhaps unusually, it makes no attempt to capitalise on its corner siting;\n\ninstead it sits rather demurely behind a high, but open, timber paling fence screened by relatively dense perimeter planting.\n\nThe house is the most important work of architect Muriel Millicent Stott who was one of only a handful of women architects working in Melbourne in the 1920s.\n\nIt is also architecturally significant for its surviving landscape elements by Edna Walling the most celebrated landscape designer of the era.\n\nLittle Milton is historically significant for its fifty year association with the Moran family of the famous grocery firm Moran and Cato.\n\nIt is socially significant as an outstanding example of an inter war mansion which typified the breaking up of the large 19th century Toorak estates such as Whernside.\n\nIt is also of social interest in that, unusually for the time, its architecture and landscape design were executed by women.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nToorak’s Little Milton Hits The Market, Price Expectations Circa $13 Million - May 12, 2011 Marc Pallisco\n\nNothing little about Milton, or its neighbours - MARC PALLISCOMAY 7, 2011\n\nVictoria Heritage Database - Little Milton\n\nMawarra\n\nMawarra, 6 Sherbrooke Road, Sherbrooke, VIC 1925-1927​\n\n21\n\nNational Trust Statement\n\nMawarra, the residence erected and the garden laid out by c.1928-32 to a design of Edna Walling and rockwork constructed by Eric Hammond, and carefully maintained with few changes of ownership, is of State cultural significance:\n\nAs one of the undoubted masterpieces of Edna Walling's landscaping (an opinion shared by Walling herself), a bold and confident essay which blends her architectural or formal style with softer woodland planting;\n\nWalling had by this date developed an enviable reputation as Victoria's (and one of Australia's) foremost landscape designers and Mawarra represents the peak of her early formal style, which increasingly gave way to a less formal style with greater use of Australian plants;\n\n​\n\nfor the design, which is a brilliant blend of accomplished workmanship, confident handling of the steeply sloping site by use of terracing and steps, technically difficult elements (such as the curved steps) and careful planting (ranging from large trees to the detailed planting of bulbs);\n\nfor the retention of buildings, structures and works from the Walling design and first period of development; these include the original section of the residence, children's playhouse, summerhouse, stone walls, steps, paths and pools;\n\nfor the survival of considerable planting from the early development of Walling's plan for the garden; this includes a fine collection of trees, exotic shrubs and bulbs,\n\nfor its aesthetic qualities; these are derived from the sense of expectation inherent in the long drive, the maturity of the original planting, seasonal contrasts through the use of deciduous plants, the strong axis with steps leading to the pond, the contrast between dense shrubberies and open woodland, the use of straight paths which permit long and controlled vistas and careful planting combinations;\n\nfor the high level of intactness of the garden, the survival of Walling's plan which enables this intactness to be assessed and the relatively high level of maintenance which has continued since the initial development of the garden;\n\nfor its setting in the hills, which permits wide range of cool climate plants to be grown, and which assists in an understanding of a wave of development of the Dandenong Ranges (following the period of land selection in the 1890s).\n\nMawarra, Sherbrooke comprises a house designed in 1925-27 and attributed to the architect Harold Desbrowe-Annear and a garden designed by the prominent and influential garden designer, Edna Walling, in 1932.\n\nOriginally known as The Grove, the c1.4 hectare property Mawarra was developed for three sisters, Mrs A W McMillan and the Misses Marshall in the popular Dandenong Ranges.\n\nThey appear to have commissioned noted architect, Harold Desbrowe-Annear, to design a large house in the mid-1920s and some five years later they engaged Edna Walling to design extensive gardens.\n\nBy the time of their involvement at The Grove, both Desbrowe-Annear and Walling had established themselves as fashionable and prolific designers.\n\nAfter a disagreement between Walling and the sisters, the garden was completed by Eric Hammond, Walling's principal contractor, who was retained to finish constructing the garden and its extensive stonework.\n\nAs was common at the time, the sisters hosted a number of fundraising events at the property in the 1940s, before selling it in 1960.\n\nWalling became friends with the subsequent owners, and was highly complimentary of their care of the garden.\n\nEdna Walling described Mawarra as a 'symphony in steps and beautiful trees' and the structure of the garden is strengthened and enhanced by the carefully positioned trees and shrubs.\n\nThe garden has a woodland character and uses a diverse variety of trees and shrubs, herbaceous plants and bulbs, evergreen, deciduous and conifer plants, many displaying spectacular autumn colour, and a variety of leaf shapes and variegations, and plant forms.\n\nThe planting is dominated by maples, oaks, beeches, magnolias, silver birches, tulip trees, linden, lilly pilly, Douglas firs, and dogwoods.\n\n​\n\nMawarra, Sherbrooke\n\nOriginal landscape plan 1932 743\n\nMawarra, Sherbrooke Edna Cottage\n\nMawarra, Sherbrooke\n\n1/19\n\nThe property changed hands in 2002 and again in 2010.

Formal architectural design, similar to that of the Italian Renaissance, was used to create a series of rooms, or pictures, and the illusion of space within the overall composition.\n\nA central stairway, leading from the house to a reflecting pool below, provides the spine of the garden and enables access to five parallel terraces that run across the site, each of which was given its own distinctive character.\n\nCarefully constructed stone walls, steps and stairways are a feature of the garden including the symmetrical walled house terrace with curved stone walls and stepped ramps either side.\n\nA tennis court was built to the north-east of the site, a sun dial positioned adjacent to the house and a small cottage, Wendy Cottage, was constructed to the north of the main house by the late 1930s.\n\nReputedly based on the playhouse for Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret built in 1932 at Royal Lodge, this \"Edna Walling\" cottage remains.\n\n​\n\nRead more:\n\nNational Trust - Mawarra Garden\n\nVictoria Heritage Database - Mawarra\n\nMawarra Manor - Heritage listed mansion and garden - AirBnB\n\nReferences\n\nReferences\n\n​\n\n[1] The art and craft of living by JENNY BROWN NOV 8, 2010\n\n[2] Harriet Edquist, The Arts and Crafts aesthetic\n\n[3] Arts of living: Arts and craft houses having their time in the sun - SUE WILLIAMS MAY 20, 2016\n\n[4] Arts & Crafts Architecture and How To Spot Arts & Crafts Homes\n\n[5] You Wish: A $12 million-plus mansion in Toorak - MARC PALLISCO, MAY 20, 2016\n\n[6] Walter Richmond Butler: an English arts and crafts architect in Australia\n\n[7] Corangamite Heritage Study Stage 2​\n\n​"
