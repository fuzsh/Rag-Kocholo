Hill Jr. began his career at North Carolina College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts upon its opening in 1889. He engaged in the common nineteenth-century practice of serving as both a professor of English and the first college librarian. This responsibility was not a major burden, as the early library occupied only a reading room in the Main Building, and later Holladay Hall. For the first ten years of the college, Hill ordered all books and supervised student assistants. Due to his scholarly interests, the early collection was dominated by the humanities and history, despite the agricultural and mechanical focus of the school. In 1908, Hill became president of the college.\n\nLess\n\nThe original textile equipment was housed in the basement of Holladay Hall.
