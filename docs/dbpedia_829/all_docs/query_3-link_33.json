Burch\n\nI, too, have stood―paralyzed at the helm\n\nwatching onrushing, inevitable disaster.\n\nI too have felt sweat (or ecstatic tears) plaster\n\ndamp hair to my eyes, as a slug’s dense film\n\nbecomes mucous-insulate. Always, thereafter\n\nliving in darkness, bright things overwhelm.\n\nOriginally published by The Neovictorian/Cochlea. I wrote this poem in 2001 after the 911 terrorist attacks.\n\nDavenport Tomorrow\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nDavenport tomorrow ...\n\nall the trees stand stark-naked in the sun.\n\nNow it is always summer\n\nand the bees buzz in cesspools,\n\nadapted to a new life.\n\nThere are no flowers,\n\nbut the weeds, being hardier,\n\nhave survived.\n\nThe small town has become\n\na city of millions;\n\nthere is no longer a sea,\n\nonly a huge sewer,\n\nbut the children don't mind.\n\nThey still study\n\nrocks and stars,\n\nbut biology is a forgotten science ...\n\nafter all, what is life?\n\nDavenport tomorrow ...\n\nall the children murmur through vein-streaked gills\n\nwhispered wonders of long-ago.\n\nBurn\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Trump\n\nSunbathe,\n\nozone baby,\n\ntill your parched skin cracks\n\nin the white-hot flash\n\nof radiation.\n\nIncantation\n\nfrom your pale parched lips\n\nshall not avail;\n\nyou made this hell.\n\nNow burn.\n\nBikini\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nUndersea, by the shale and the coral forming,\n\nby the shell’s pale rose and the pearl’s bright eye,\n\nthrough the sea’s green bed of lank seaweed worming\n\nlike tangled hair where cold currents rise ...\n\nsomething lurks where the riptides sigh,\n\nsomething old, and odd, and wise.\n\nSomething old when the world was forming\n\nnow lifts its beak, its snail-blind eye,\n\nand, with tentacles like Medusa's squirming,\n\nit feels the cloud blot out the skies' ...\n\nthen shudders, settles with a sigh,\n\nunderstanding man’s demise.\n\nThis poem has over 800,000 Google results for the eleventh line. That's a lot of cutting and pasting!\n\nFirst They Came for the Muslims\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nafter Martin Niemoller\n\nFirst they came for the Muslims\n\nand I did not speak out\n\nbecause I was not a Muslim.\n\nThen they came for the homosexuals\n\nand I did not speak out\n\nbecause I was not a homosexual.\n\nThen they came for the feminists\n\nand I did not speak out\n\nbecause I was not a feminist.\n\nNow when will they come for me\n\nbecause I was too busy and too apathetic\n\nto defend my sisters and brothers?\n\nPublished in Amnesty International’s Words That Burn anthology, and by Borderless Journal (India), The Hindu (India), Matters India, New Age Bangladesh, Convivium Journal, PressReader (India) and Kracktivist (India)\n\nIt is indeed an honor to have one of my poems published by an outstanding organization like Amnesty International. A stated goal for the \"Words That Burn\" anthology is to teach students about human rights through poetry.\n\nWarming Her Pearls\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nWarming her pearls, her *******\n\ngleam like constellations.\n\nHer belly is a bit rotund ...\n\nshe might have stepped out of a Rubens.\n\nSafe Harbor\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Kevin N. Roberts\n\nThe sea at night seems\n\nan alembic of dreams—\n\nthe moans of the gulls,\n\nthe foghorns’ bawlings.\n\nA century late\n\nto be melancholy,\n\nI watch the last shrimp boat as it steams\n\nto safe harbor again.\n\nIn the twilight she gleams\n\nwith a festive light,\n\ndone with her trawlings,\n\nready to sleep . . .\n\nDeep, deep, in delight\n\nglide the creatures of night,\n\nelusive and bright\n\nas the poet’s dreams.\n\nPublished by The Lyric, Grassroots Poetry, Romantics Quarterly, Angle, Poetry Life & Times\n\nDistances\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nMoonbeams on water—\n\nthe reflected light\n\nof a halcyon star\n\nnow drowning in night ...\n\nSo your memories are.\n\nFootprints on beaches\n\nnow flooding with water;\n\nthe small, broken ribcage\n\nof some primitive slaughter ...\n\nSo near, yet so far.\n\nOriginally published by The Poetry Porch/Sonnet Scroll\n\nFascination with Light\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nDesire glides in on calico wings,\n\na breath of a moth\n\nseeking a companionable light,\n\nwhere it hovers, unsure,\n\nsullen, shy or demure,\n\nin the margins of night,\n\na soft blur.\n\nWith a frantic dry rattle\n\nof alien wings,\n\nit rises and thrums one long breathless staccato\n\nand flutters and drifts on in dark aimless flight.\n\nAnd yet it returns\n\nto the flame, its delight,\n\nas long as it burns.\n\nOriginally published by The HyperTexts\n\nKin\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nO pale, austere moon,\n\nhaughty beauty ...\n\nwhat do we know of love,\n\nor duty?\n\nWater and Gold\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nYou came to me as rain breaks on the desert\n\nwhen every flower springs to life at once,\n\nbut joy's a wan illusion to the expert:\n\nthe Bedouin has learned how not to want.\n\nYou came to me as riches to a miser\n\nwhen all is gold, or so his heart believes,\n\nuntil he dies much thinner and much wiser,\n\nhis gleaming bones hauled off by chortling thieves.\n\nYou gave your heart too soon, too dear, too vastly;\n\nI could not take it in; it was too much.\n\nI pledged to meet your price, but promised rashly.\n\nI died of thirst, of your bright Midas touch.\n\nI dreamed you gave me water of your lips,\n\nthen sealed my tomb with golden hieroglyphs.\n\nPublished by The Lyric, Black Medina, The Eclectic Muse, Kritya (India), Shabestaneh (Iran), Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry, Captivating Poetry (Anthology), Strange Road, Freshet, Shot Glass Journal, Better Than Starbucks, Famous Poets and Poems, Sonnetto Poesia, Poetry Life & Times\n\nescape!!!\n\nby michael r. burch\n\nfor anaïs vionet\n\nto live among the daffodil folk . . .\n\nslip down the rainslickened drainpipe . . .\n\nsuddenly pop out\n\nthe GARGANTUAN SPOUT . . .\n\nminuscule as alice, shout\n\nyippee-yi-yee!\n\nin wee exultant glee\n\nto be leaving behind the\n\nLARGE\n\nTHREE-DENALI GARAGE.\n\nLeave Taking\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nBrilliant leaves abandon battered limbs\n\nto waltz upon ecstatic winds\n\nuntil they die.\n\nBut the barren and embittered trees,\n\nlament the frolic of the leaves\n\nand curse the bleak November sky ...\n\nNow, as I watch the leaves' high flight\n\nbefore the fading autumn light,\n\nI think that, perhaps, at last I may\n\nhave learned what it means to say—\n\ngoodbye.\n\nThis poem started out as a stanza in a much longer poem, \"Jessamyn's Song,\" that dates to around age 14 or 15.\n\nPassionate One\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Beth\n\nLove of my life,\n\nlight of my morning―\n\narise, brightly dawning,\n\nfor you are my sun.\n\nGive me of heaven\n\nboth manna and leaven―\n\ndesirous Presence,\n\nPassionate One.\n\nStay With Me Tonight\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nStay with me tonight;\n\nbe gentle with me as the leaves are gentle\n\nfalling to the earth.\n\nAnd whisper, O my love,\n\nhow that every bright thing, though scattered afar,\n\nretains yet its worth.\n\nStay with me tonight;\n\nbe as a petal long-awaited blooming in my hand.\n\nLift your face to mine\n\nand touch me with your lips\n\ntill I feel the warm benevolence of your breath’s\n\nheady fragrance like wine.\n\nThat which we had\n\nwhen pale and waning as the dying moon at dawn,\n\noutshone the sun.\n\nAnd so lead me back tonight\n\nthrough bright waterfalls of light\n\nto where we shine as one.\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nbachelorhoodwinked\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\n(for anyone struggling with self-image)\n\nShe has a comely form\n\nand a smile that brightens her dorm ...\n\nbut she's grossly unthin\n\nwhen seen from within;\n\nsoon a griefstricken campus will mourn.\n\nYet she'd never once criticize\n\na friend for the size of her thighs.\n\nDo unto others—\n\nsisters and brothers?\n\nYes, but also ourselves, likewise.\n\nWar is Obsolete\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nTrump’s war is on children and their mothers.\n\n\"An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.\" ― Gandhi\n\nWar is obsolete;\n\neven the strange machinery of dread\n\nweeps for the child in the street\n\nwho cannot lift her head\n\nto reprimand the Man\n\nwho failed to countermand\n\nher soft defeat.\n\nBut war is obsolete;\n\neven the cold robotic drone\n\nthat flies far overhead\n\nhas sense enough to moan\n\nand shudder at her plight\n\n(only men bereft of Light\n\nwith hearts indurate stone\n\nembrace war’s Siberian night.)\n\nFor war is obsolete;\n\nman’s tribal “gods,” long dead,\n\nhave fled his awakening sight\n\nwhile the true Sun, overhead,\n\nhas pity on her plight.\n\nO sweet, precipitate Light!―\n\nembrace her, reject the night\n\nthat leaves gentle fledglings dead.\n\nFor each brute ancestor lies\n\nwith his totems and his “gods”\n\nin the slavehold of premature night\n\nthat awaited him in his tomb;\n\nwhile Love, the ancestral womb,\n\nstill longs to give birth to the Light.\n\nSo which child shall we ****** tonight,\n\nor which Ares condemn to the gloom?\n\nOriginally published by The Flea. While campaigning for president in 2016, Donald Trump said that, as commander-in-chief of the American military, he would order American soldiers to track down and ****** women and children as \"retribution\" for acts of terrorism. When aghast journalists asked Trump if he could possibly have meant what he said, he verified more than once that he did.

Burch\n\nWhen you were in my house\n\nyou were not free―\n\nin chains bound.\n\nManifest Destiny?\n\nI was wrong;\n\nmy plantation burned to the ground.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis is my song,\n\nthis is my plea:\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWhen you are in my house,\n\nnow, I am not free.\n\nI feel the song\n\nhurling itself back at me.\n\nWe were wrong.\n\nThis is my history.\n\nI feel my tongue\n\nstilting accordingly.\n\nWe were wrong;\n\nbrother, forgive me.\n\nPublished by Black Medina\n\nShock\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nIt was early in the morning of the forming of my soul,\n\nin the dawning of desire, with passion at first bloom,\n\nwith lightning splitting heaven to thunder's blasting roll\n\nand a sense of welling fire and, perhaps, impending doom―\n\nthat I cried out through the tumult of the raging storm on high\n\nfor shelter from the chaos of the restless, driving rain ...\n\nand the voice I heard replying from a rift of bleeding sky\n\nwas mine, I'm sure, and, furthermore, was certainly insane.\n\nI may have been reading too many gothic ghost stories when I wrote this one! I think it shows a good touch with meter for a young poet, since I wrote it in my early teens.\n\nIn Praise of Meter\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe earth is full of rhythms so precise\n\nthe octave of the crystal can produce\n\na trillion oscillations, yet not lose\n\na second's beat. The ear needs no device\n\nto hear the unsprung rhythms of the couch\n\ndrown out the mouth's; the lips can be debauched\n\nby kisses, should the heart put back its watch\n\nand find the pulse of love, and sing, devout.\n\nIf moons and tides in interlocking dance\n\nobey their numbers, what's been left to chance?\n\nShould poets be more lax―their circumstance\n\nas humble as it is?―or readers wince\n\nto see their ragged numbers thin, to hear\n\nthe moans of drones drown out the Chanticleer?\n\nOriginally published by The Eclectic Muse, then in The Best of the Eclectic Muse 1989-2003\n\nCompleting the Pattern\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWalk with me now, among the transfixed dead\n\nwho kept life’s compact and who thus endure\n\nharsh sentence here—among pink-petaled beds\n\nand manicured green lawns. The sky’s azure,\n\npale blue once like their eyes, will gleam blood-red\n\nat last when sunset staggers to the door\n\nof each white mausoleum, to inquire—\n\nWhat use, O things of erstwhile loveliness?\n\nThe Communion of Sighs\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThere was a moment\n\nwithout the sound of trumpets or a shining light,\n\nbut with only silence and darkness and a cool mist\n\nfelt more than seen.\n\nI was eighteen,\n\nmy heart pounding wildly within me like a fist.\n\nExpectation hung like a cry in the night,\n\nand your eyes shone like the corona of a comet.\n\nThere was an instant . . .\n\nwithout words, but with a deeper communion,\n\nas clothing first, then inhibitions fell;\n\nliquidly our lips met\n\n—feverish, wet—\n\nforgotten, the tales of heaven and hell,\n\nin the immediacy of our fumbling union . . .\n\nwhen the rest of the world became distant.\n\nThen the only light was the moon on the rise,\n\nand the only sound, the communion of sighs.\n\nPublished by Grassroots Poetry and Poetry Webring\n\nThe Harvest of Roses\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Harvey Stanbrough\n\nI have not come for the harvest of roses—\n\nthe poets' mad visions,\n\ntheir railing at rhyme ...\n\nfor I have discerned what their writing discloses:\n\nweak words wanting meaning,\n\nbeat torsioning time.\n\nNor have I come for the reaping of gossamer—\n\nimages weak,\n\ntoo forced not to fail;\n\ngathered by poets who worship their luster,\n\nthey shimmer, impendent,\n\nresplendently pale.\n\nOriginally published by The Raintown Review when Harvey Stanbrough was the editor\n\nWhite in the Shadows\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhite in the shadows\n\nI see your face,\n\nunbidden. Go, tell\n\nLove it is commonplace;\n\ntell Regret it is not so rare.\n\nOur love is not here\n\nthough you smile,\n\nfull of sedulous grace.\n\nLost in darkness, I fear\n\nthe past is our resting place.\n\nPublished by Carnelian, The Chained Muse, Poetry Life & Times, A-Poem-A-Day and in a YouTube video by Aurora G. with the titles “Ghost,” “White Goddess” and “White in the Shadows”\n\nThe Octopi Jars\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nLong-vacant eyes\n\nnow lodged in clear glass,\n\na-swim with pale arms\n\nas delicate as angels'...\n\nyou are beyond all hope\n\nof salvage now...\n\nand yet I would pause,\n\nno fear!,\n\nto once touch\n\nyour arcane beaks...\n\nI, more alien than you\n\nto this imprismed world,\n\nnotice, most of all,\n\nthe scratches on the inside surfaces\n\nof your hermetic cells ...\n\nand I remember documentaries\n\nof albino Houdinis\n\nslipping like wraiths\n\nover the walls of shipboard aquariums,\n\nslipping down decks'\n\nbrine-lubricated planks,\n\nspilling jubilantly into the dark sea,\n\nparachuting through clouds of pallid ammonia...\n\nand I know now in life you were unlike me:\n\nyour imprisonment was never voluntary.\n\nThe Children of Gaza\n\nNine of my poems have been set to music by the composer Eduard de Boer and have been performed in Europe by the Palestinian soprano Dima Bawab. My poems that became “The Children of Gaza” were written from the perspective of Palestinian children and their mothers. On this page the poems come first, followed by the song lyrics, which have been adapted in places to fit the music …\n\nEpitaph for a Child of Gaza\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nI lived as best I could, and then I died.\n\nBe careful where you step: the grave is wide.\n\nFrail Envelope of Flesh\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers and children of Gaza\n\nFrail envelope of flesh,\n\nlying cold on the surgeon’s table\n\nwith anguished eyes\n\nlike your mother’s eyes\n\nand a heartbeat weak, unstable ...\n\nFrail crucible of dust,\n\nbrief flower come to this―\n\nyour tiny hand\n\nin your mother’s hand\n\nfor a last bewildered kiss ...\n\nBrief mayfly of a child,\n\nto live two artless years!\n\nNow your mother’s lips\n\nseal up your lips\n\nfrom the Deluge of her tears ...\n\nFor a Child of Gaza, with Butterflies\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhere does the butterfly go\n\nwhen lightning rails\n\nwhen thunder howls\n\nwhen hailstones scream\n\nwhile winter scowls\n\nand nights compound dark frosts with snow?\n\nWhere does the butterfly go?\n\nWhere does the rose hide its bloom\n\nwhen night descends oblique and chill\n\nbeyond the capacity of moonlight to fill?\n\nWhen the only relief's a banked fire's glow,\n\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nAnd where shall the spirit flee\n\nwhen life is harsh, too harsh to face,\n\nand hope is lost without a trace?\n\nOh, when the light of life runs low,\n\nwhere does the butterfly go?\n\nI Pray Tonight\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the children of Gaza and their mothers\n\nI pray tonight\n\nthe starry Light\n\nmight\n\nsurround you.\n\nI pray\n\nby day\n\nthat, come what may,\n\nno dark thing confound you.\n\nI pray ere tomorrow\n\nan end to your sorrow.\n\nMay angels' white chorales\n\nsing, and astound you.\n\nSomething\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers and children of Gaza\n\nSomething inescapable is lost―\n\nlost like a pale vapor curling up into shafts of moonlight,\n\nvanishing in a gust of wind toward an expanse of stars\n\nimmeasurable and void.\n\nSomething uncapturable is gone―\n\ngone with the spent leaves and illuminations of autumn,\n\nscattered into a haze with the faint rustle of parched grass\n\nand remembrance.\n\nSomething unforgettable is past―\n\nblown from a glimmer into nothingness, or less,\n\nand finality has swept into a corner where it lies\n\nin dust and cobwebs and silence.\n\nMother’s Smile\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers of Gaza and their children\n\nThere never was a fonder smile\n\nthan mother’s smile, no softer touch\n\nthan mother’s touch. So sleep awhile\n\nand know she loves you more than “much.”\n\nSo more than “much,” much more than “all.”\n\nThough tender words, these do not speak\n\nof love at all, nor how we fall\n\nand mother’s there, nor how we reach\n\nfrom nightmares in the ticking night\n\nand she is there to hold us tight.\n\nThere never was a stronger back\n\nthan father’s back, that held our weight\n\nand lifted us, when we were small,\n\nand bore us till we reached the gate,\n\nthen held our hands that first bright mile\n\ntill we could run, and did, and flew.\n\nBut, oh, a mother’s tender smile\n\nwill leap and follow after you!\n\nSuch Tenderness\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nfor the mothers of Gaza\n\nThere was, in your touch, such tenderness―as\n\nonly the dove on her mildest day has,\n\nwhen she shelters downed fledglings beneath a warm wing\n\nand coos to them softly, unable to sing.\n\nWhat songs long forgotten occur to you now―\n\na babe at each breast? What terrible vow\n\nripped from your throat like the thunder that day\n\ncan never hold severing lightnings at bay?\n\nTime taught you tenderness―time, oh, and love.\n\nBut love in the end is seldom enough ...\n\nand time?―insufficient to life’s brief task.\n\nI can only admire, unable to ask―\n\nwhat is the source, whence comes the desire\n\nof a woman to love as no God may require?\n\nwho, US?\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\njesus was born\n\na palestinian child\n\nwhere there’s no Room\n\nfor the meek and the mild\n\n... and in bethlehem still\n\nto this day, lambs are born\n\nto cries of “no Room!”\n\nand Puritanical scorn ...\n\nunder Herod, Trump, Bibi\n\ntheir fates are the same―\n\nthe slouching Beast mauls them\n\nand WE have no shame:\n\n“who’s to blame?”\n\nMy nightmare ...\n\nI had a dream of Jesus!\n\nMama, his eyes were so kind!\n\nBut behind him I saw a billion Christians\n\nhissing \"You're nothing!,\" so blind.\n\n―The Child Poets of Gaza (written by Michael R. Burch for the children of Gaza)\n\nI, too, have a dream ...\n\nI, too, have a dream ...\n\nthat one day Jews and Christians\n\nwill see me as I am:\n\na small child, lonely and afraid,\n\nstaring down the barrels of their big bazookas,\n\nknowing I did nothing\n\nto deserve their enmity.\n\n―The Child Poets of Gaza (written by Michael R.

Burch\n\nLike twenty impossibilities\n\nin Lydda, Ramla and Galilee ...\n\nhere we shall remain.\n\nLike brick walls braced against your chests;\n\nlodged in your throats\n\nlike shards of glass\n\nor prickly cactus thorns;\n\nclouding your eyes\n\nlike sandstorms.\n\nHere we shall remain,\n\nlike brick walls obstructing your chests,\n\nwashing dishes in your boisterous bars,\n\nserving drinks to our overlords,\n\nscouring your kitchens' filthy floors\n\nin order to ****** morsels for our children\n\nfrom between your poisonous fangs.\n\nHere we shall remain,\n\nlike brick walls deflating your chests\n\nas we face our deprivation clad in rags,\n\nsinging our defiant songs,\n\nchanting our rebellious poems,\n\nthen swarming out into your unjust streets\n\nto fill dungeons with our dignity.\n\nLike twenty impossibilities\n\nin Lydda, Ramla and Galilee,\n\nhere we shall remain,\n\nguarding the shade of the fig and olive trees,\n\nfermenting rebellion in our children\n\nlike yeast in dough.\n\nHere we wring the rocks to relieve our thirst;\n\nhere we stave off starvation with dust;\n\nbut here we remain and shall not depart;\n\nhere we spill our expensive blood\n\nand do not hoard it.\n\nFor here we have both a past and a future;\n\nhere we remain, the Unconquerable;\n\nso strike fast, penetrate deep,\n\nO, my roots!\n\nLabor Pains\n\nby Fadwa Tuqan\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\n\nHamza was one of my hometown’s ordinary men\n\nwho did manual labor for bread.\n\nWhen I saw him recently,\n\nthe land still wore its mourning dress in the solemn windless silence\n\nand I felt defeated.\n\nBut Hamza-the-unextraordinary said:\n\n“Sister, our land’s throbbing heart never ceases to pound,\n\nand it perseveres, enduring the unendurable, keeping the secrets of mounds and wombs.\n\nThis land sprouting cactus spikes and palms also births freedom-fighters.\n\nThus our land, my sister, is our mother!”\n\nDays passed and Hamza was nowhere to be seen,\n\nbut I felt the land’s belly heaving in pain.\n\nAt sixty-five Hamza’s a heavy burden on her back.\n\n“Burn down his house!”\n\nsome commandant screamed,\n\n“and slap his son in a prison cell!”\n\nAs our town’s military ruler later explained\n\nthis was necessary for law and order,\n\nthat is, an act of love, for peace!\n\nArmed soldiers surrounded Hamza’s house;\n\nthe coiled serpent completed its circle.\n\nThe bang at his door came with an ultimatum:\n\n“Evacuate, **** it!'\n\nSo generous with their time, they said:\n\n“You can have an hour, yes!”\n\nHamza threw open a window.\n\nFace-to-face with the blazing sun, he yelled defiantly:\n\n“Here in this house I and my children will live and die, for Palestine!”\n\nHamza's voice echoed over the hemorrhaging silence.\n\nAn hour later, with impeccable timing, Hanza’s house came crashing down\n\nas its rooms were blown sky-high and its bricks and mortar burst,\n\ntill everything settled, burying a lifetime’s memories of labor, tears, and happier times.\n\nYesterday I saw Hamza\n\nwalking down one of our town’s streets ...\n\nHamza-the-unextraordinary man who remained as he always was:\n\nunshakable in his determination.\n\nEnough for Me\n\nby Fadwa Tuqan\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

If my interpretation is correct, Elis hears the blackbird's cries, anticipates the danger represented by a harbinger of death, but elects to continue rather than turn back. From what I have been able to gather, the color blue had a special significance for Georg Trakl: it symbolized longing and perhaps a longing for death. The colors blue, purple and black may represent a progression toward death in the poem.\n\nHabeas Corpus\n\nby Michael R.

Burch\n\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\n\nGod has been heard to speak\n\nin many enraged discourses,\n\nhigh, high from some mountain peak\n\nwhere He’s lectured man on compassion\n\nwhile the sparrows around Him fell,\n\nand babes, for His meager ration\n\nof rain, died and went to hell,\n\nunbaptized, for that’s His fashion.\n\nIn His kingdom of corpses,\n\nGod has been heard to vent\n\nin many obscure discourses\n\non the need for man to repent,\n\nto admit that he’s a sinner;\n\ngive up ***, and riches, and fame;\n\nbe disciplined at his dinner\n\nthough always he dies the same,\n\nwhether fatter or thinner.\n\nIn his kingdom of corpses,\n\nGod has been heard to speak\n\nin many absurd discourses\n\nof man’s Ego, precipitous Peak!,\n\nwhile demanding praise and worship,\n\nand the bending of every knee.\n\nAnd though He sounds like the Devil,\n\nall religious men now agree\n\nHe loves them indubitably.\n\nUyghur Poetry Translations\n\nWith my translations I am trying to build awareness of the plight of Uyghur poets and their people, who are being sent in large numbers to Chinese \"reeducation\" concentration camps.\n\nPerhat Tursun (1969-????) is one of the foremost living Uyghur language poets, if he is still alive. Unfortunately, Tursun was \"disappeared\" into a Chinese \"reeducation\" concentration camp where extreme psychological torture is the norm. According to a disturbing report he was later \"hospitalized.\" Apparently no one knows his present whereabouts or condition, if he has one. According to John Bolton, when Donald Trump learned of these \"reeducation\" concentration camps, he told Chinese President Xi Jinping it was \"exactly the right thing to do.\" Trump’s excuse? \"Well, we were in the middle of a major trade deal.\"\n\nElegy\n\nby Perhat Tursun\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

For the Uyghur people the Mongol period ended around 1760 when the Qing dynasty invaded their homeland, then called Dzungaria. Around a million people were slaughtered during the Qing takeover, and the Dzungaria territory was renamed Xinjiang. I imagine many Uyghurs fleeing the slaughters would have attempted to navigate treacherous mountain passes. Many of them may have died from starvation and/or exposure, while others may have been caught and murdered by their pursuers.

Burch\n\n“I began to realize the fog was similar to the shadows.”\n\nI began to realize that, just as the exact shape of darkness is a shadow,\n\neven so the exact shape of fog is disappearance\n\nand the exact shape of a human being is also disappearance.\n\nAt this moment it seemed my body was vanishing into the human form’s final state.\n\nAfter I arrived here,\n\nit was as if the danger of getting lost\n\nand the desire to lose myself\n\nwere merging strangely inside me.\n\nWhile everything in that distant, gargantuan city where I spent my five college years felt strange to me; and even though the skyscrapers, highways, ditches and canals were built according to a single standard and shape, so that it wasn’t easy to differentiate them, still I never had the feeling of being lost. Everyone there felt like one person and they were all folded into each other. It was as if their faces, voices and figures had been gathered together like a shaman’s jumbled-up hair.\n\nEven the men and women seemed identical.\n\nYou could only tell them apart by stripping off their clothes and examining them.\n\nThe men’s faces were beardless like women’s and their skin was very delicate and unadorned.\n\nI was always surprised that they could tell each other apart.\n\nLater I realized it wasn’t just me: many others were also confused.\n\nFor instance, when we went to watch the campus’s only TV in a corridor of a building where the seniors stayed when they came to improve their knowledge. Those elderly Uyghurs always argued about whether someone who had done something unusual in an earlier episode was the same person they were seeing now. They would argue from the beginning of the show to the end. Other people, who couldn’t stand such endless nonsense, would leave the TV to us and stalk off.\n\nThen, when the classes began, we couldn’t tell the teachers apart.\n\nGradually we became able to tell the men from the women\n\nand eventually we able to recognize individuals.\n\nBut other people remained identical for us.\n\nThe most surprising thing for me was that the natives couldn’t differentiate us either.\n\nFor instance, two police came looking for someone who had broken windows during a fight at a restaurant and had then run away.\n\nThey ordered us line up, then asked the restaurant owner to identify the culprit.\n\nHe couldn’t tell us apart even though he inspected us very carefully.\n\nHe said we all looked so much alike that it was impossible to tell us apart.\n\nSighing heavily, he left.\n\nThe Encounter\n\nby Abdurehim Otkur\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI asked her, why aren’t you afraid? She said her God.\n\nI asked her, anything else? She said her People.\n\nI asked her, anything more? She said her Soul.\n\nI asked her if she was content? She said, I am Not.\n\nThe Distance\n\nby Tahir Hamut\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWe can’t exclude the cicadas’ serenades.\n\nBehind the convex glass of the distant hospital building\n\nthe nurses watch our outlandish party\n\nwith their absurdly distorted faces.\n\nDrinking watered-down liquor,\n\nhalf-****, descanting through the open window,\n\nwe speak sneeringly of life, love, girls.\n\nThe cicadas’ serenades keep breaking in,\n\nwrecking critical parts of our dissertations.\n\nThe others dream up excuses to ditch me\n\nand I’m left here alone.\n\nThe cosmopolitan pyramid\n\nof drained bottles\n\nmakes me feel\n\nlike I’m in a Turkish bath.\n\nI lock the door:\n\nTime to get back to work!\n\nI feel like doing cartwheels.\n\nI feel like self-annihilation.\n\nRefuge of a Refugee\n\nby Ablet Abdurishit Berqi aka Tarim\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI lack a passport,\n\nso I can’t leave legally.\n\nAll that’s left is for me to smuggle myself to safety,\n\nbut I’m afraid I’ll be beaten black and blue at the border\n\nand I can’t afford the trafficker.\n\nI’m a smuggler of love,\n\nthough love has no national identity.\n\nPoetry is my refuge,\n\nwhere a refugee is most free.\n\nThe following excerpts, translated by Anne Henochowicz, come from an essay written by Tang Danhong about her final meeting with Dr. Ablet Abdurishit Berqi, aka Tarim. Tarim is a reference to the Tarim Basin and its Uyghur inhabitants...\n\nI’m convinced that the poet Tarim Ablet Berqi the associate professor at the Xinjiang Education Institute, has been sent to a “concentration camp for educational transformation.” This scholar of Uyghur literature who conducted postdoctoral research at Israel’s top university, what kind of “educational transformation” is he being put through?\n\nChen Quanguo, the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, has said it’s “like the instruction at school, the order of the military, and the security of prison. We have to break their blood relations, their networks, and their roots.”\n\nOn a scorching summer day, Tarim came to Tel Aviv from Haifa. In a few days he would go back to Urumqi. I invited him to come say goodbye and once again prepared Sichuan cold noodles for him. He had already unfriended me on Facebook. He said he couldn’t eat, he was busy, and had to hurry back to Haifa. He didn’t even stay for twenty minutes. I can’t even remember, did he sit down? Did he have a glass of water? Yet this farewell shook me to my bones.\n\nHe said, “Maybe when I get off the plane, before I enter the airport, they’ll take me to a separate room and beat me up, and I’ll disappear.”\n\nLooking at my shocked face, he then said, “And maybe nothing will happen …”\n\nHis expression was sincere. To be honest, the Tarim I saw rarely smiled. Still, layer upon layer blocked my powers of comprehension: he’s a poet, a writer, and a scholar. He’s an associate professor at the Xinjiang Education Institute. He can get a passport and come to Israel for advanced studies. When he goes back he’ll have an offer from Sichuan University to be a professor of literature … I asked, “Beat you up at the airport? Disappear? On what grounds?”\n\n“That’s how Xinjiang is,” he said without any surprise in his voice. “When a Uyghur comes back from being abroad, that can happen.”…\n\nThis poem helps us understand the nomadic lifestyle of many Uyghurs, the hardships they endure, and the character it builds...\n\nIz (“Traces”)\n\nby Abdurehim Otkur\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWe were children when we set out on this journey;\n\nNow our grandchildren ride horses.\n\nWe were just a few when we set out on this arduous journey;\n\nNow we're a large caravan leaving traces in the desert.\n\nWe leave our traces scattered in desert dunes' valleys\n\nWhere many of our heroes lie buried in sandy graves.\n\nBut don't say they were abandoned: amid the cedars\n\ntheir resting places are decorated by springtime flowers!\n\nWe left the tracks, the station... the crowds recede in the distance;\n\nThe wind blows, the sand swirls, but here our indelible trace remains.\n\nThe caravan continues, we and our horses become thin,\n\nBut our great-grand-children will one day rediscover those traces.\n\nMy Feelings\n\nby Dolqun Yasin\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\n\nSo often in my busy mind I sought,\n\nAround the advent of the fledgling year,\n\nFor something pretty that I really ought\n\nTo give my lady dear;\n\nBut that sweet thought's been wrested from me, clear,\n\nSince death, alas, has sealed her under clay\n\nAnd robbed the world of all that's precious here―\n\nGod keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nFor me to keep my manner and my thought\n\nAcceptable, as suits my age's hour?\n\nWhile proving that I never once forgot\n\nHer worth? It tests my power!\n\nI serve her now with masses and with prayer;\n\nFor it would be a shame for me to stray\n\nFar from my faith, when my time's drawing near—\n\nGod keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nNow earthly profits fail, since all is lost\n\nAnd the cost of everything became so dear;\n\nTherefore, O Lord, who rules the higher host,\n\nTake my good deeds, as many as there are,\n\nAnd crown her, Lord, above in your bright sphere,\n\nAs heaven's truest maid! And may I say:\n\nMost good, most fair, most likely to bring cheer—\n\nGod keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nWhen I praise her, or hear her praises raised,\n\nI recall how recently she brought me pleasure;\n\nThen my heart floods like an overflowing bay\n\nAnd makes me wish to dress for my own bier—\n\nGod keep her soul, I can no better say.\n\nConfession of a Stolen Kiss\n\nby Charles d'Orleans (c.1394-1465)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nMy ghostly father, I confess,\n\nFirst to God and then to you,\n\nThat at a window (you know how)\n\nI stole a kiss of great sweetness,\n\nWhich was done out of avidness—\n\nBut it is done, not undone, now.\n\nMy ghostly father, I confess,\n\nFirst to God and then to you.\n\nBut I shall restore it, doubtless,\n\nAgain, if it may be that I know how;\n\nAnd thus to God I make a vow,\n\nAnd always I ask forgiveness.\n\nMy ghostly father, I confess,\n\nFirst to God and then to you.\n\nTranslator note: By \"ghostly father\" I take Charles d'Orleans to be confessing to a priest. If so, it's ironic that the kiss was \"stolen\" at a window and the confession is being made at the window of a confession booth. But it also seems possible that Charles could be confessing to his human father, murdered in his youth and now a ghost. There is wicked humor in the poem, as Charles is apparently vowing to keep asking for forgiveness because he intends to keep stealing kisses at every opportunity!\n\nCharles d'Orleans translations of Rondels/Roundels/Rondeaux\n\nNote: While there is some confusion about the names and definitions of poetic forms such as the rondel, roundel, rondelle and rondeau, these are all rhyming poems with refrains.\n\nRondel: Your Smiling Mouth\n\nby Charles d'Orleans (c.1394-1465)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\n\nNow the sun passes under the wood:\n\nI rue, Mary, thy face: fair, good.\n\nNow the sun passes under the tree:\n\nI rue, Mary, thy son and thee.\n\nIn the poem above, note how \"wood\" and \"tree\" invoke the cross while \"sun\" and \"son\" seem to invoke each other. Sun-day is also Son-day, to Christians. The anonymous poet who wrote the poem above may have been been punning the words \"sun\" and \"son.\" The poem is also known as \"Now Goeth Sun Under Wood\" and \"Now Go'th Sun Under Wood.\"\n\nFowles in the Frith\n\n(anonymous Middle English lyric, circa 13th-14th century AD)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R.

Burch\n\nRemembrance like a river rises;\n\nthe rain of recollection falls;\n\nfrail memories, like vines, entangled,\n\ncling to Time's collapsing walls.\n\nThe past is like a distant mist,\n\nthe future like a far-off haze,\n\nthe present half-distinct an hour\n\nbefore it blurs with unseen days.\n\nResurrecting Passion\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nLast night, while dawn was far away\n\nand rain streaked gray, tumescent skies,\n\nas thunder boomed and lightning railed,\n\nI conjured words, where passion failed ...\n\nBut, oh, that you were mine tonight,\n\nsprawled in this bed, held in these arms,\n\nyour ******* pale baubles in my hands,\n\nour bodies bent to old demands ...\n\nSuch passions we might resurrect,\n\nif only time and distance waned\n\nand brought us back together; now\n\nI pray that this might be, somehow.\n\nBut time has left us twisted, torn,\n\nand we are more apart than miles.\n\nHow have you come to be so far—\n\nas distant as an unseen star?\n\nSo that, while dawn is far away,\n\nmy thoughts might not return to you,\n\nI feed your portrait to the flames,\n\nbut as they feast, I burn for you.\n\nPublished in Songs of Innocence and The Chained Muse.\n\nCurrents\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nHow can I write and not be true\n\nto the rhythm that wells within?\n\nHow can the ocean not be blue,\n\nnot buck with the clapboard slap of tide,\n\nthe clockwork shock of wave on rock,\n\nthe motion creation stirs within?\n\nOriginally published by The Lyric\n\nRighteous\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nCome to me tonight\n\nin the twilight, O, and the full moon rising,\n\nspectral and ancient, will mutter a prayer.\n\nGather your hair\n\nand pin it up, knowing\n\nthat I will release it a moment anon.\n\nWe are not one,\n\nnor is there a scripture\n\nto sanctify nights you might spend in my arms,\n\nbut the swarms\n\nof bright stars revolving above us\n\nrevel tonight, the most ardent of lovers.\n\nPublished by Writer’s Gazette, Tucumcari Literary Review and The Chained Muse\n\nR.I.P.\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen I am lain to rest\n\nand my soul is no longer intact,\n\nbut dissolving, like a sunset\n\ndiminishing to the west ...\n\nand when at last\n\nbefore His throne my past\n\nis put to test\n\nand the demons and the Beast\n\nawait to feast\n\non any morsel downward cast,\n\nwhile the vapors of impermanence\n\ncling, smelling of damask ...\n\nthen let me go, and do not weep\n\nif I am left to sleep,\n\nto sleep and never dream, or dream, perhaps,\n\nonly a little longer and more deep.\n\nOriginally published by Romantics Quarterly\n\nThe Shape of Mourning\n\nby Michael R. Burch\n\nThe shape of mourning\n\nis an oiled creel\n\nshining with unuse,\n\nthe bolt of cold steel\n\non a locker\n\nshielding memory,\n\nthe monthly penance\n\nof flowers,\n\nthe annual wake,\n\nthe face in the photograph\n\nno longer dissolving under scrutiny,\n\nbecoming a keepsake,\n\nthe useless mower\n\nlying forgotten\n\nin weeds,\n\nrings and crosses and\n\nall the parapherna"
