        "text": "The home at 849 Bluff Drive in Sequoyah Hills does not jump out at a passerby like perhaps some other nearby homes in terms of size or ornamentation. But it does have its own appeal and an immaculate yard.\n\nThe historic home that has been expanded and modernized — and is now for sale — actually has more than meets the eye from the front curb.\n\nThe French country manor-style home has in excess of 10,000 square feet of living space. And some of the rooms inside are almost deceptively quite expansive.\n\nHowever, the family living and gathering spaces and six bedrooms all seem to flow together in such a connected and circular way that the home does have an intimate feel. In fact, the home’s rooms seem to be as intricately joined as links on a bracelet.\n\n“There’s always a sense of being in your whole house,” said Whitney Ray-Dawson of Alliance Sotheby’s International Realty in describing this effect. “Sometimes in a big ‘McMansion,’ so much is never seen or felt.”\n\nMore: Sequoyah Hills: The 'Great Gatsby' of Knox neighborhoods\n\nThe steep-roofed home is currently for sale for $3.95 million, making it one of the most expensive properties on the market in Knoxville/Knox County. As part of a recent short series the Bearden Shopper News has been doing on upper-market homes for sale around the Sequoyah Hills area, listing agent and affiliate broker Ray-Dawson offered to give a tour of it last week.\n\nUpdated in the last 10 years or so by contractors Gerald and Matt Jenkins with plans from architect Brian Pittman, the house has several large gathering rooms and a dining room, as well as an open kitchen with a large island.\n\nMore: Rose Busch was murdered in her Sequoyah Hills home in '68. Now the crime scene is gone.\n\nSeveral rooms also have access to other rooms, as well as to numerous outside doors, as if the inside is almost part of the outside. A highlight of this effect is a circular patio porch leading from the master suite on the first floor.\n\nAnother feature of another bedroom is a guest loft room above the garage that Ray-Dawson said has a Blackberry Farm-like feel.\n\nThe structure also has a large media room with three TV sets, a large office room, and a nice hallway – which could also double as an art gallery. The latter leads out to a veranda/terrace surrounded on two sides by wings recently built onto the home.\n\nAnd if that is not enough, it has eight full baths, two half baths, two washers and dryers and various ovens in a catering kitchen/laundry, five indoor gas fireplaces and one outdoor one. A salt-water pool located on its own walled patio area sits out back and definitely adds a little glamour feel to the home.\n\nThe home also has a poolroom of the billiards variety, a gym befitting a club or at least a motel, and original leaded glass windows in diamond patterns at several strategic places. There are also a gathering room with a wood ceiling, closets that are each bigger than a typical New York City efficiency apartment, and a master bathroom with both a large walk-in shower and an old-fashioned-style tub.\n\nBut with the way the home is laid out and displayed, a visitor might just as easily be tempted to examine individual parts of the home instead of the extensive offerings collectively.\n\n“One thing I love about the house is, although it’s a large house, the spaces are such that they are perfect for large gatherings, yet conducive to intimate gatherings with family and friends,” she said.\n\nRay-Dawson said the home was built about 1930 and was lived in for a period by the late Kent and Martha Anne Withers. The son of one of the stockholders of Alcoa company, Kent Withers had been sent by his father from his home in Pittsburgh to help at the Alcoa plant in Blount County.\n\nMore: Sequoyah Hills home inspired by 1933 World's Fair wins award\n\nThis man who worked with aluminum became known along with his wife for their hearts of gold in helping various needy charities and nonprofit organizations around Knoxville through their Christian philanthropic and volunteer work.\n\nBefore her death in 2010, Mrs. Withers was also known for her exquisite dinner parties. And her yard was a must-see stop on the annual Dogwood Trail.\n\nRay-Dawson said she heard the area around the home was originally an arboretum when Sequoyah Hills was in the earlier stages of development.\n\nApproximately a decade ago, J.W. and Whitney Haslam Johnson – the son-in-law and daughter of Jimmy and Dee Haslam – moved into the home after it was extensively remodeled and enlarged.\n\nThey later sold the home to a former CEO of Scripps Networks Interactive and the house was updated. It also was named Magnolia Bluff due to some magnolia trees by the house..\n\nMore: Lyons View home with Smoky Mountain view heads to auction for $1.6M\n\nAt $3.95 million, Ray-Dawson knows there are not a lot of potential buyers in the immediate Knoxville area, even though she said the house has had several showings.\n\nBut she is confident that if someone in that price range did see the home, they would like it. She certainly does, she says.\n\n“This is a fabulous house,” said Ray-Dawson. “It has been completely updated with modern amenities, yet it has maintained the integrity of its original build.”"
