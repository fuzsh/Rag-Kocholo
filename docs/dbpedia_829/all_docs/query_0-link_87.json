Purple flowers, a color that has long been a symbol of royalty, also suggest richness and elegance.\n\nPlants with purple flowers and green leaves provide a stunning addition to any garden and landscape. Purple flowering plants are available in many shade variations, from graceful lavender to dark and rich violet. They come in spring bulbs, fall-blooming wildflowers, ground covers, climbing plants, and more.\n\nHere are our favorite purple flowers with pictures that will add beautiful hues to your garden.\n\n01 of 64\n\nMay Night Salvia (Salvia x sylvestris 'May Night')\n\nMay Night salvia, a deep bluish-purple perennial, produces small blooms on flower spikes about 2 feet tall. It is known for its long blooming period from May through June, making it a valuable landscape plant. Like other salvias, this one is a great choice for perennial borders, cottage gardens, butterfly gardens, or wildflower gardens. Early spring is the best time to cut plants back to encourage fresh new growth.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Purple with blue tints\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained\n\n02 of 64\n\nCaradonna Salvia (Salvia nemorosa 'Caradonna')\n\nCaradonna salvia is similar to May Night, but it is a deeper shade of purple and features a more slender flower stalk that highlights the flowers. It grows 1 to 2 feet high. And like other salvias, it has a very long bloom period from June to September. It does well in dry conditions, but it flowers best if it gets regular moisture.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Deep shades of purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, moist\n\n03 of 64\n\nLamium (Lamium maculatum 'Purple Dragon')\n\nLamium maculatum is perhaps best known as a ground cover plant with silvery foliage, but the cultivar 'Purple Dragon' adds light purple flowers. (It also comes in pink, mauve, red, and white, depending on the cultivar.) Lamium plants don't tolerate foot traffic, so they should be situated out of the way. Leaves also will easily scorch, so it's best to keep the plants away from direct sun.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple\n\nSun Exposure: Part sun, Shade\n\nSoil Needs: Average, medium moisture, well-drained\n\n04 of 64\n\nAllium (Allium spp.)\n\nAlliums are a welcome addition to the landscape, not only for their color but also for their globular shape. The flower head is made of clusters of individual florets that create a full and lush round shape. Like other spring-flowering bulbs, they need to be planted in the fall. Heights range from 2 to 5 feet, depending on the variety. Flowering occurs in the late spring to early summer.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 10\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, yellow, white, green\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Slightly acidic, well-drained\n\nContinue to 5 of 64 below\n\n05 of 64\n\nPetunia (Petunia x hybrida)\n\nPetunias are one of the most well-known purple flowers, recognized by their wide, trumpet-shaped blooms. The petals come in a variety of looks, including double blooms, ruffled, smooth, striped, solid colors, and even varieties with heart-shaped patterns. Petunias are commonly used in hanging baskets, in window boxes, and as bedding plants. They bloom from early May right up until frost. And they need lots of sun and water to keep them full and blooming.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 10 to 11, typically grown as an annual\n\nColor Varieties: Pink, purple, yellow, orange, red, green, white\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, moist, well-drained\n\nTip\n\nPlant the same flower in various purple shades for added interest in your garden. Also, incorporate plants with purple foliage to add texture.\n\n06 of 64\n\nChrysanthemum\n\nChrysanthemums or mums are a well-loved garden flower often purchased as an annual to display in containers. But mums do beautifully as perennials, too. Pinch them back by removing the stem and top two leaves until late June; this promotes bushier growth and more flower buds. Mums come in a wide array of colors including purples; try 'Purple Andrea', 'Grape Queen', and 'Grandchild' cultivars for gorgeous color in the autumn garden.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, red, orange, yellow, white, pink\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained\n\n07 of 64\n\nAzalea (Rhododendron spp.)\n\nAzaleas are gorgeous evergreen shrubs with spring blooms that light up the garden with their delicate shapes and vibrant hues. They bloom well in partial shade to full sun, making them a versatile ornamental plant. There are some compact varieties, while some older heirlooms get very large. The wide range of colors includes some lovely purples, including 'Autumn Lilac', 'Lee's Dark Purple', and 'Purple Splendor'.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 6 to 10\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, red, orange, yellow, white, pink\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained\n\n08 of 64\n\nColumbine (Aquilegia vulgaris)\n\nColumbine plants have delicate flowers that appear in April and May. Aquilegia vulgaris and its cultivars mature at about 1 to 3 feet tall. They work well in cottage gardens and rock gardens. Although this plant loves the sun, it does not like excess heat. Add a layer of mulch around the plant to keep the roots cool and moist.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Blue, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Sandy or loamy, medium moisture, well-drained\n\nContinue to 9 of 64 below\n\n09 of 64\n\nLarkspur (Consolida ajacis)\n\nTrue larkspurs are annual flowers (Consolida ajacis is the most common species grown in gardens) that are tough and hardy. These plants grow to around 3 to 4 feet tall, with spiky blooms that show up on the main stalk. They grow quickly from seed, blooming in spring and summer. These annuals may self-seed freely, producing plants year after year. But be aware that larkspurs are toxic, so avoid planting them where kids or pets might eat them.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 2 to 10\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, white, blue\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Medium moisture, well-drained\n\n10 of 64\n\nLobelia (Lobelia erinus)\n\nLobelia blooms from summer through the first frost. There are numerous varieties of lobelia plants, but the cultivars providing trailing blue/purple flowers are usually Lobelia eranus. Lobelia flowers have five petals, and some have white eyes. They don't need deadheading (removing spent blooms) because they self-clean. If they suffer from heat, revive the plants by cutting them back and then providing regular water.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 10 to 11, typically grown as an annual\n\nColor Varieties: Blue, purple, pink, white, red\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, moist, well-drained\n\n11 of 64\n\nJackman's Clematis (Clematis 'Jackmanii')\n\nJackman's clematis is a flowering vine that produces large, deep purple flowers in mid-summer. The clematis has pretty and profuse flowers that have four velvety petals. The vines are best trained to climb on trellises, arbors, walls, and fences. A trick to success with clematis vines is growing the plants in sunlight but keeping the roots cool. This can be achieved by mulching the root area or adding short plants over the root zone to provide ground shade.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 11\n\nColor Varieties: Lavender to deep purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, moist, well-drained\n\n12 of 64\n\nDahlia (Dahla spp.)\n\nDahlias require a bit of work in colder zones, to plant each spring and lift to store for winter, but many gardeners think their lush beauty is worth the effort. There are a number of gorgeous purple dahlias available, including the vigorous deep plum 'Thomas Edison', the blue-violet 'Lilac Time', and the purple-tipped pink 'Mikayla'.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 8 to 10\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, red, orange, yellow, white, pink\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, loamy\n\nContinue to 13 of 64 below\n\n13 of 64\n\nHeliotrope (Heliotrope spp.)\n\nHeliotrope is a shrub-like plant with clusters of fragrant blooms, growing 1 to 4 feet high. These plants begin blooming in summer and continue through the first frost. Maintaining even soil moisture is key to their growth. They will wither away in either soil that is too dry or too soggy. Moreover, these plants are toxic to eat, so keep them away from kids and pets.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 9 to 11, typically grown as an annual\n\nColor Varieties: Lavender to deep purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, loamy, moist, well-drained\n\n14 of 64\n\nCrocus (Crocus spp.)\n\nHarbingers of spring, crocuses and other bulb plants are welcome flowering visitors to gardens in March and April. Crocuses are small plants with star-shaped blooms that grow close to the ground, reaching just 3 to 6 inches tall depending on the type. Looking like blades of grass, the foliage is marked down the middle with a light stripe. Make sure your crocuses aren't sitting in soggy soil, which can cause them to rot.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, blue, pink, yellow, gold, orange, white\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained\n\n15 of 64\n\nVerbena (Verbena spp.)\n\nThe Verbena genus includes both annual and perennial species, many of which produce purple flowers. The flowers are tiny and fragrant, creating saucer-shaped clusters that can span 3 inches. The plant itself is airy, ethereal, and tends to sprawl. Although they easily spread, they can be trained to grow in a more compact space with new blooms through regular pruning.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, red, white, orange\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Dry to medium moisture, acidic, well-drained\n\n16 of 64\n\nDelphinium (Delphinium 'Black Knight')\n\nDelphiniums grow as high as 8 feet and are often featured in cottage gardens. The 'Black Knight' cultivar adds a robust burst of dark purple into a garden thanks to its spiked flowers. Delphiniums are relatively short-lived perennials, rarely surviving more than three to four years. The blooms appear in clusters along the stalk in June to July, sometimes reblooming in the fall. Staking is suggested to help them grow well. Delphinium is toxic, so avoid planting it in areas with children and pets.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 7\n\nColor Varieties: Blue, purple, white, pink\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, moist, well-drained\n\nContinue to 17 of 64 below\n\n17 of 64\n\nPurple Ice Plant (Delosperma cooperi)\n\nThe purple ice plant features flowers with finely textured petals surrounding solid centers. It blooms through most of the summer and fall. The \"ice\" in this plant's common name comes from the sparkle on its leaves, which is the result of sunlight reflecting off tiny hairs on the leaf surface. This perennial demands soil that drains sharply, so ensure that it's not sitting in soggy soil.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 6 to 11\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, red, orange, yellow\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Sandy, dry, well-drained\n\n18 of 64\n\nPacific Rhododendron (Rhododendron macrophyllum)\n\nPacific rhododendron shrubs can grow quite high. They produce showy bell-shaped flowers in the spring and summer. Their foliage is evergreen. These shrubs don’t actually need fertile soil to grow well; rather they prefer fairly low-nutrient soil. They are hardy shrubs, but they do like even soil moisture. So you must have a consistent watering schedule. However, good drainage is important because soggy soil can kill them.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Pink, purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Acidic, well-drained\n\n19 of 64\n\nButterfly Bush (Buddleja davidii)\n\nThe butterfly bush is a deciduous shrub with arching branches. It produces brightly colored flower spikes throughout the summer that are highly attractive to butterflies and other pollinators, hence the shrub’s common name. This shrub is quite easy to grow, and because of that it is considered invasive in some areas. So be sure to check for any local restrictions on planting it. Consider newer varieties with sterile flowers that don't spread invasively.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, white, yellow\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Average, medium moisture, well-drained\n\n20 of 64\n\nBougainvillea (Bougainvillea spp.)\n\nBougainvillea is a genus of tropical vines. These showy plants can act as ground covers if they’re left free to grow. Or they can easily be trained to grow on a support, such as a trellis or fence. The foliage is evergreen in tropical areas. And the large, brightly colored blooms appear seasonally. These vines do have thorns, so care should be taken when working with them.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 10 to 11, typically grown as an annual\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, red, pink, yellow\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Acidic, well-drained\n\nContinue to 21 of 64 below\n\n21 of 64\n\nMidnight Blue Rose (Rosa 'Midnight Blue')\n\nThe Midnight Blue rose is a beautiful cultivar with deep purple flowers that stretch around 2 to 3 inches across. The blooms are known to have a strong fragrance. These shrubs can flower from spring to fall, and deadheading can help to encourage further blooming. But be careful of the thorns on these shrubs.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 6 to 11\n\nColor Varieties: Deep purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Loamy, well-drained\n\n22 of 64\n\nRhapsody in Blue Rose (Rosa 'Rhapsody in Blue')\n\nThe Rhapsody in Blue rose cultivar is another stunning plant with purple flowers. Its blooms, which stretch around 2.5 inches across, appear from late spring all the way until fall. They start out as a vivid purple color and then fade to a mauve-gray. In their centers, they have bright gold stamens. They also feature a strong orange-like fragrance. Deadheading is ideal to promote repeat-blooming.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Loamy, well-drained\n\n23 of 64\n\nBlue Beard (Caryopteris × clandonensis)\n\nBlue beard, also known as blue spirea and blue mist, is a small shrub with a mounding growth habit. It only reaches around 2 to 4 feet tall and wide. It features aromatic foliage, and in the late summer, the flowers appear. The small, blue-violet flowers are said to look like clouds of blue mist on the plant. This shrub needs sharp soil drainage, as it is particularly intolerant to soggy soil.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Blue-violet\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Average, medium moisture, well-drained\n\n24 of 64\n\nWinter Heath (Erica spp.)\n\nWinter heaths are small evergreen shrubs with dense foliage and a mounding growth habit. Like heather, they also look best when planted en masse for maximum impact. Their flowering time depends on location and variety. But often the small clusters of blooms will appear during winter (in mild climates) and in early spring. Prune as needed just after the shrubs are done flowering.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, red, yellow, white\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Acidic, moist, well-drained\n\nContinue to 25 of 64 below\n\n25 of 64\n\nLilac (Syringa vulgaris)\n\nLilac bushes are popular plants with purple flowers. These deciduous shrubs bloom in the mid-to late spring with branching clusters of tiny flowers. The flowers have an exceptionally sweet fragrance. The foliage ranges from blue-green to gray-green. These shrubs are fairly low-maintenance once established. Prune to clean up growth just after flowering is finished. Newer varieties are available that perform well in warmer climates.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 7\n\nColor Varieties: Lavender-blue, white, burgundy, deep purple, lilac\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Loamy, well-drained\n\n26 of 64\n\nHeather (Calluna spp.)\n\nMany species of heather shrubs feature dainty purple flowers along long stems that appear from summer to fall. Heather shrubs look especially striking when planted en masse. And they do particularly well on slopes and in rock gardens. Make sure to give your heather plants consistent moisture, but ensure that the soil has good drainage. Prune them as needed in the early spring before new growth starts.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 6\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, white\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Acidic, moist, well-drained\n\n27 of 64\n\nHydrangea (Hydrangea spp.)\n\nHydrangeas long have been popular garden plants for their flowers that come in many different colors, including purple. Some varieties have large, round flower clusters while others have smaller, flatter flowers. They generally bloom from mid-summer to fall. Water hydrangeas at least weekly unless you’ve had rainfall, but make sure they’re not sitting in soggy soil. Note that soil pH affects bloom color.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: White, blue, green, red, pink, purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, well-drained\n\n28 of 64\n\nMorning Glory (Ipomoea purpurea)\n\nMorning glories are fast-growing annual flowering vines that are a favorite of many gardeners. They’re low-maintenance, and they don’t require pruning or deadheading to look their best. They can grow along the ground or up on a support structure. Their colorful trumpet-shaped flowers appear in the summer and fall. Be sure to water weekly unless you’ve had rainfall. Note that morning glory can be invasive in some areas.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 2 to 11\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, blue, white\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Moist, well-drained\n\nContinue to 29 of 64 below\n\n29 of 64\n\nWisteria (Wisteria frutescens)\n\nWisteria is a woody vine with deep green foliage that can stretch to 30 feet or longer under prime growing conditions. It bears fragrant purple flowers on drooping stems in the spring. Narrow, smooth seed pods follow the flowers. Provide this vine with a sturdy trellis, post, or other support structure to fully enjoy its beautiful growth.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Humusy, moist, well-drained\n\n30 of 64\n\nLavender (Lavandula spp.)\n\nLavender is an herb that’s popular not only for its fragrance but also for its purple flowers. The tiny clusters of flowers appear in the summertime on upright spikes. The aromatic foliage is a gray-green color. Make sure to situate your lavender plant in a spot that gets full sun and has well-drained soil. In an optimal growing site, the plant needs relatively little care.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 5 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained\n\n31 of 64\n\nPurple Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea)\n\nThe purple coneflower is a particularly showy plant. It has an upright growth habit, reaching around 2 to 5 feet high. And in the summer, daisy-like flowers with a spiny center cone bloom. The flowers can stretch up to 5 inches across. The stiff stems also bear dark green foliage. This plant will often self-seed if the spent flower heads are left in place. So if you wish to control its spread, remove the spent blooms.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Purple-pink\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Average, well-drained\n\n32 of 64\n\nIris (Iris reticulata)\n\nIrises come in a number of varieties with slightly different appearances and growth habits. These flowers feature blooms made of two types of petals. The outer petals droop downward while the smaller inner petals stand upright. This gives the whole flower an interesting shape. Irises often attract butterflies and hummingbirds. Deadhead spent blooms, and trim back the foliage once frost arrives in the fall. Reticulata irises are dwarf irises that bloom early in spring.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, blue, white, yellow\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, well-drained\n\nContinue to 33 of 64 below\n\n33 of 64\n\nPansy (Viola x wittrockiana)\n\nPansies are a popular but short-lived garden plant. Outside of their hardiness zones, they’re often grown as annuals. They prefer cool weather and tolerate frosts. In southern climates, they're typically planted in fall and overwinter, blooming through spring until summer temperatures arrive. They rarely reach more than a foot in height and spread, but they have large, colorful flowers that bloom in the spring.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 6 to 10, typically grown as annuals\n\nColor Varieties: Blue, purple, red, pink, yellow, orange, white, bicolors\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Rich, moist, well-drained\n\n34 of 64\n\nMonkshood (Aconitum napellus)\n\nMonkshood blooms late in the season and adds a gorgeous deep violet color to the garden. There's a range of colors in the many cultivars from white to deep purples and blues, with many hues and colors in between. Note that monkshood is toxic if ingested.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, white, deep blue\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, moist\n\n35 of 64\n\nWild Violets (Viola papilionacea)\n\nViolets are a common low-growing ground cover that spread eagerly and often appear in lawns. Their sweet-smelling colorful flowers arrive in mid spring, and their heart shaped dark green leaves remain through autumn. Some think of violets as a weed, but their early blooms are important food for pollinators.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, white, lavender\n\nSun Exposure: Part sun to part shade\n\nSoil Needs: Tolerates a wide range of soil\n\n36 of 64\n\nGrecian Windflower (Anemone blanda)\n\nGrecian windflowers (Anemone blanda) are also known as Balkan windflowers. They grow from a hard, nut-like tuber and the flowers naturalize readily in loamy, well-drained soil. The daisy like, spring blooming flowers come in shades of periwinkle blue, white, light purple, and pink.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, pink, white, periwinkle blue\n\nSun Exposure: Partial shade to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, loamy\n\nContinue to 37 of 64 below\n\n37 of 64\n\nGrape Hyacinth (Muscari)\n\nGrape hyacinths are a spring blooming bulb that provide gorgeous color in the garden. The classic Muscari armeniacum has deep violet blue flowers. Two great cultivars to try for purple shades are Muscari latifolium (a bicolor with periwinkle and plum flowers) and Muscari latifolium 'Purple Rain' (which has light lavender purple flowers).\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Shades of blue, purple, white, pink\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained but moist\n\n38 of 64\n\nAster (Symphiotricum 'Wood's Purple')\n\nAsters, also known as Michaelmas daisies, bloom for weeks in early autumn. The most commonly grown asters in North America are New England Asters. There are a number of purple asters, but one of the most reliable is 'Wood's Purple'. This light purple aster with yellow centers grows about 12 inches tall, loves a sunny spot, and spreads out happily, weaving in among other perennials.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Light purple\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, loamy\n\n39 of 64\n\nDutch Hyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis)\n\nDutch hyacinths are reliably fragrant, colorful spring bloomers. One cut flower will perfume an entire room. The bulbs are toxic to cats, dogs, and horses, so exercise caution when planting or digging them. The best deep purple varieties are 'Peter Stuyvesant', 'Purple Sensation', and 'Atlantic'.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 4 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Shades of blue, purple, white, pink, yellow\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained but moist, slightly acidic\n\n40 of 64\n\nBachelor Buttons (Centaurea cyranus)\n\nBachelor buttons, also called cornflowers, are a colorful annual flower that looks lovely in the cottage style garden. They reseed readily but can also be planted from seed in late fall or early to mid spring. Cornflowers come in a wide range of cool colors, including purple. Two great varieties to try are 'Mauve Boy' (light purple) and 'Black Ball' (deep burgundy purple).\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 2 to 11\n\nColor Varieties: Shades of blue, purple, white, pink\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained but moist\n\nContinue to 41 of 64 below\n\n41 of 64\n\nFlowering Catmint (Nepeta)\n\nFlowering catmint has tiny pale purple flowers that grow on tall spikes from rounded clumps of grey-green leaves. Cats love the minty-smelling leaves and hummingbirds, bees, and other pollinators love the nectar-rich flowers. Catmint likes sun and well-drained soil, but is otherwise not fussy and is a great addition to the cottage garden, where it blooms for weeks in summer. There are a number of cultivars that vary in height, but most have light blue and purple flowers.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Light purple and blue\n\nSun Exposure: Full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, sandy or loamy\n\n42 of 64\n\nSnapdragon (Antirrhinum majus)\n\nSnapdragons don't come in deep royal purple, but there are many shades of pale orchid, fuchsia pink, deep burgundy, and bright magenta to lend vivid color to your garden. They come in deep solid colors and lovely bicolors and bloom from late summer until after frost. They're considered an annual in colder zones, but some varieties will often reseed themselves, so watch for the tiny seedlings to appear in mid spring.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 7 to 11\n\nColor Varieties: Magenta, fuchsia, pink, white, red, yellow, burgundy\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, acidic\n\n43 of 64\n\nSweet William (Dianthus barbatus)\n\nThere are over 300 varieties of dianthus. The perennial, needle-leafed spreading Dianthus grataniapolitensis known as \"Cheddar pinks\" has small flowers. The clumping semi-perennial variety (often called \"Sweet William\") is the most common, with some cultivars being the double-petaled, clove-scented carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus). Trim spent flowers to encourage a second round of buds. Dianthus come in a range of hues including bicolors in magenta and light purple.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 9\n\nColor Varieties: Magenta, fuchsia, pink, white, red, bicolors\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained, loamy\n\n44 of 64\n\nBlue Waterfall Bellflower (Campanula poscharskyana 'Blue Waterfall')\n\nBellflowers come in a wide range of types, in different sizes and shapes, but nearly every variation has shades of purple from light to dark. 'Blue Waterfall' (Campanula poscharskyana) is native to Serbia, a vigorous creeping variety with lavender-blue flowers. It grows very well on slopes and in rock gardens.\n\nUSDA Growing Zones: 3 to 8\n\nColor Varieties: Purple, violet\n\nSun Exposure: Partial to full sun\n\nSoil Needs: Well-drained\n\nContinue to 45 of 64 below\n\n45 of 64\n\nTall Phlox (Phlox paniculata)\n\nTall phlox, also known as garden phlox, are indispensable in the late summer garden. Their sturdy structure and long-lasting blooms are a vibrant color boost at a time when many summer blooms are fading. They do need some air circulation to avoid powdery mildew, so give them some room and divide frequently.
