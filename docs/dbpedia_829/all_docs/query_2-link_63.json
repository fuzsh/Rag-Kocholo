See also ‘The testimonial’ (poem 5). Bruen (1789–1852) resided on the family’s Oak Park Estate on the northern outskirts of Carlow and was the colonel of the Carlow Regiment of Militia. A wealthy Protestant, Tory landowner and man of influence, he represented Carlow County in Parliament from 1812 until 1831 and then stood again in 1835, but the result was contested. He returned to Parliament later that year after a contested by-election but was defeated in the General Election of 1837. He won a by-election in December 1840, following the death of the standing Liberal MP, and was re-elected at the General Election in July 1841.\n\n2 Tyndall was in Kinsale, working for the Irish Ordnance Survey.\n\n3 Erin: romantic name for Ireland.\n\n4 Barrow’s beauteous banks: the River Barrow, which flows through Carlow.\n\n5 Breathes there … native land: Walter Scott, The Last Lay of the Minstrel (1805), VI.i.1–3.\n\n6 See also John Tyndall to his father, 22 July 1841 (letter 0080, TC1).

His widow Jane Lucretia D’Esterre (1797–1868) angrily refused O’Connell’s remorseful offer to share his income with her, although she did accept an annuity to support her daughter. A ban is an imprecation of a curse, an execration or malediction expressing anger (OED).\n\n7 See also John Tyndall to Editor of The Carlow Sentinel, 26 October 1841 (letter 0106, TC1).

The published version has different punctuation in places.\n\n3 Bruen’s: see poem 2, n. 1.\n\n4 Mononia’s: Mononia is the Province of Munster, comprising Counties Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford. The principal source for ‘Mononia’ was the poem ‘Remember the Glories of Brien the Brave’ in Thomas Moore’s Irish Melodies (1821).\n\n5 Ullin’s hills: ‘And Ullin’s hills be silent as the grave’ (G. Harvey, trans., Ossian’s Fingal: A Ancient Epic Poem (London: Valpy, 1814), II.xv.8).\n\n6 Hibernia’s new Thermopylae: Colonel Henry Bruen’s electoral success at Carlow in 1841 is here compared with the famous battle at Thermopylae in 480 BCE, when the Greek forces repelled a far larger army of Persian soldiers. Hibernia is the Classical Latin name for Ireland.\n\n7 Chimborazo’s lofty peak: one of the highest mountains in the Andes in South America and the highest mountain in Ecuador at 6,263 m (20,549 ft).\n\n8 gorgon: in Greek mythology the Gorgons were three sisters whose hair was made from venomous snakes and who turned those who looked at them into stone.\n\n9 Brucelike: The Scottish warrior king, Robert the Bruce (1274–1329), defeated a far larger English army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He later invaded Ireland to assist the Irish struggle against England.\n\n10 surpliced fiends: wearing the loose vestment of white linen worn over a cassock by Roman Catholic priests.\n\n11 Lerne: possibly the Lernaean Hydra that, in Greek mythology, was a many-headed serpent.\n\n12 See also John Tyndall to Editor of The Carlow Sentinel (letter 0110, TC1).

For a commentary on this poem, see DeArce, McGing and McMillan (2013–14).\n\n3 Child of the North!: according to DeArce, McGing and McMillan (2013–14) this refers to a specific section of the voting population of Carlow.\n\n4 “IRELAND’S BATTLE” fought and won!: in the General Election of 1841, the Conservatives Colonel Henry Bruen and Thomas Bunbury had beaten Liberals (Whigs) in both County Carlow seats.\n\n5 harp of Erin: traditional Irish symbol.\n\n6 Thy gallant son: Henry Bruen, as revealed in the final line.

that stern reality should crush\n\nThy visionary towers.—I reached my home,\n\nAnd eyes that once beamed kindly passed me by\n\nUnheedingly—dark strife had raised her flag\n\nWhere kindred hearts had throbbed in unison.\n\nOne smiling morn, by inclination led,\n\nI wandered forth reflecting as I went\n\nOn bygone days.—There is a peaceful spot\n\n(Thought I,) where discord has not raised his brand;\n\nI’ll to’t, and view fair happiness once more.\n\nI climbed a hill, and from its mossy peak\n\nI viewed the scene around—no smoky curl\n\nDanced on the eddies of the atmosphere.\n\nOnward I went towards the happy spot—\n\nFor so I deemed it still—no sound arose\n\nTo wake the sleeping echoes of the shade;\n\nEach tree appeared to weep, as from the bough,\n\nthe leaflets seared and severed dropped to earth;\n\nA sad foreboding filled my anxious mind,\n\nWhen what I sought now burst upon my view!\n\nBlack, desolate and dreary—roofless walls\n\nUpreared themselves, on which each passing breeze\n\nLavished a sigh—fixed to the spot I stood,\n\nAnd traced the work of ruin’s ruthless hand.\n\nUpon a rugged stile a being sat;\n\nHe seemed inanimate—as if his mind\n\nAbstracted from the earth, had wandered from\n\nIts tenement, which waited its return.\n\nHis forehead pale was by a grisly hand\n\nIntensely pressed.—I, wondering, asked the cause\n\nOf all I saw.—He started at my voice,\n\nAnd, like a reckless maniac answered—“THERE!”\n\n“The darkest shroud is cast o’er all my hopes;\n\n“THERE have I lived in happiness—and THERE\n\n“My aged father heaved his dying sigh;\n\n“I see his angry ghost indignant frown\n\n“Upon his guilty son.—Oh! here I might\n\n“Have spent a happy life, wer’t not for ONE!\n\n“Damn him, ye furies!—on the guilty thing\n\n“Heap burning coals, and oh, ye vengeful skies\n\n“Rain black perdition on his lonely grave!\n\n“Oh! I could the darksome thoughts which now revolve\n\n“Within my tortured mind, be quick enrobed\n\n“In hottest flame!—and were my burning breast\n\n“A thunder-cloud to roll the lightning on—\n\n“In dire explosion, on the miscreant’s head,\n\n“I’d shower the vengeance of a ruined man!\n\n“Curst be the hour he came with silver tongue,\n\n“And Syren sounds5 to woo me to my doom!\n\n“To suit my taste a bauble first he dressed,\n\n“And called it “Freedom”—God! I’ve found it false!\n\n“False as the fruit that blooms in hell’s abyss!\n\n“He talked of pampered tyranny—he said\n\n“I was a slave—and I, poor fool, believed.\n\n“Mis’ries, ’till then unknown, sprung up before\n\n“My jaundiced view—imaginary wrongs\n\n“Lent fuel to the furnace of my brain,\n\n“And viper-like, I turned and madly stung\n\n“(Oh! base ingratitude,) the man that fed me.\n\n“T’was done!—He cast the reptile from his breast—\n\n“Deserted by the fiend who worked my woe—\n\n“Dark desolation scowling o’er my fate,\n\n“A wretched houseless wanderer I roam.”\n\nCarlow Sentinel, 11 and 18 November 1841, [3]6\n\nTypewritten transcript only\n\n1 Landlord and Tenant: in his journal, Tyndall made several references to relationships between landlords and tenants in Ireland, particularly during the time of the emerging Great Famine, after the failure of the potato crop. Though he saw many of the (implicitly Catholic) tenants as dirty and indolent, he believed that the absentee landlords should shoulder their share of the load in relieving poverty and helping their tenants to work and survive.

I love you—the feelings which bind\n\nUs are strong as o’er bound things material with mind;\n\nBut my heart!—shall I utter the working that’s there?\n\nShall my stanza be marred by the clink of despair?\n\nAs autumn complains of the blight of the spring,\n\nOf the mildews which summer has shook from her wing;\n\nThus, thus, will I warble my woe-begone tale,\n\nTill the chimneys of Liverpool4 echo my wail.\n\nOh! why has just heaven permitted the snare?\n\nOr why wert thou made so surpassingly fair?\n\nWere the soft downy cheek and the roseate smile\n\nBestowed thee to strengthen each hope-crushing wile?\n\nCan I ever forget the perfection of bliss,\n\nWhich pervaded my soul when my first burning kiss\n\nWas with ardour impressed on thy beautiful cheek,\n\nAnd my eyes volumed forth what my tongue could not speak.\n\nHas the ruby a glow?—round thy sweet lips it shone:\n\nHas a Nainde a grace?—it was surely thine own:\n\nHas the rosebud a fragrance?—the tulip a hue?\n\nHas an angel a glory?—it beamed around you:\n\nWhen it twinkles in beauty o’er Italy’s skies,\n\nHas the eve-star a ray?—oh! it dwelt in thine eyes.\n\nWith a Persian’s high favour, when called to adore,\n\nI gazed on thee—loved thee—what could I do more?\n\nOh! talk to me not of the gay vernal bloom,\n\nOf the jessamine’s dyes, or the lily’s perfume;\n\nCan the joyance of spring to the mouldering heart,\n\nHope’s promises bring, or hope’s soothings impart?\n\nAh! no—in the depths of Cimmerian night,5\n\nLie buried my prospects, erst gloriously bright:\n\nMy Mary is false! oh! the thought is a hell;\n\nYe records of trampled affection—FAREWELL.\n\nPreston Chronicle, 28 January 1843, [4]\n\nTypewritten transcript only\n\n1 Signed ‘W. Ginty’, this poem is a prank by Tyndall, narrating Ginty’s discovery of his ‘false’ Mary. He even sent a copy anonymously to her, following which there was a scene amid some concern that her family might see it (James Sinnett to John Tyndall, 2 February 1843, RI MS JT/1/TYP/11/3863, letter 0184 in TC1), especially since Mary’s engagement to someone else had just been announced (William Ginty to John Tyndall, 31 January 1843, RI MS JT/1/TYP/11/3591, letter 183 in TC1). Ginty found the affair highly amusing.

A ‘decent church’ is presumably a Protestant one, and may relate to directives on ecclesiastical furniture in the English Church Canons such as ‘A decent Communion-table in every Church’ (Canon LXXXII) (letter 0217, n. 9, TC1).\n\n5 merle: a blackbird.\n\n6 lofty mote: the Moat of Ballyknockan, the only remaining part of the Dinn Righ, the ancient seat of the Kings of Carlow, south of Leighlinbridge near the west bank of the River Barrow (letter 0146, n. 17, TC1).\n\n7 the brooklet near: presumably Maudlin stream, a tributary of the Barrow (letter 0146, n. 18, TC1).\n\n8 Burgage: a parish in County Carlow.\n\n9 ‘The Lodges’: possibly Burgage House, seat of the Vigors family (letter 0217, n. 14, TC1).\n\n10 the castle’s hory pile: the remains of Carlow Castle, a Norman structure built between 1207 and 1213 (letter 0217, n. 17, TC1).\n\n11 Not always thus: Carlow Castle was besieged in 1495 amid the repercussions of a plot to seize the English crown, and again during the Confederate Wars of 1641–2, when more than 400 Anglo-Irish Protestants were trapped by Catholic Confederate forces and starved for three months.

From whom the beacon’s glare\n\nShone like a comet o’er the startled land\n\nBidding the hardy sons of youth prepare\n\nTo fight for home against each hostile band.\n\nAnd now as then these homes are worthy all\n\nThe high devotion of true hearted men\n\nAnd should the clarion of th’invader call\n\nHis belted legions to thy hills again.\n\nTo stand in battle for those starry eyes\n\nTo shield their bosoms pure from slight or wrong\n\nYou champions of the ‘rose of snow’ arise\n\nDie if you must! Ye live in deathless song.\n\nWat Ripton\n\nRI MS JT 8/2/1/18\n\n1 Beacon Hill overlooks Halifax from the east.\n\n2 Probably written while Tyndall was based in Halifax, between late 1844 and August 1847.\n\n45 [To Fanny]1 23 August 18462\n\nThere is a grace intangible\n\nAn attribute of soul\n\nWhich sets details in harmony\n\nAnd beautifies the whole\n\n‘A mind—a music to the face’\n\nAnd tho’ the critic sneer\n\nHere dwells thy mystic influence\n\nSweet witch of Lancashire\n\nRI MS JT/2/3/82; RI MS JT/2/13a/144\n\n1 Fanny Smith, who Tyndall referred to as ‘the Witch’, with whom Tyndall had some relationship. Bob Allen told Tyndall she broke off her engagement because of him. See Robert Allen to John Tyndall, 2 July 1847, RI MS JT 2/13a/224–5 (letter 333 in TC2).\n\n2 Tyndall was in Preston, where Fanny Smith lived, after a visit to Ireland and before going back to Halifax.\n\n46 Retrospective poem1 c.1845\n\nChance led my wandering hands today\n\nMid dusty papers, grave and gay\n\nSome sparkled with Sam Weller’s2 wit\n\nWhile here and there were, stewed a bit\n\nOf Cupids rusty prose—again\n\nFrom George’s methodistic pen3\n\nUnravelled came a friendly page\n\nA page appeared—a warning page\n\nOf holy love and counsel sage\n\nNext rise to view a pair of poems\n\nFrom Cuddy’s4 pen, a line from Holmes5\n\nAnother from Foy,6 a scratch from Davy7\n\nA sheet from Chad8 as rich as gravy\n\nAn invitation to a party\n\nA cherished scrap from Miss McCarthy9\n\nA mathematical solution\n\nOf sundry “probs” in evolution\n\nA Valentine where love in roses\n\nA lazy little boy reposes\n\nA rhyme from Ginty10 when his heart\n\nFirst felt the little blind boys dart\n\nA curse from ditto loud and long\n\nAnother oath and then a song\n\nA shady grove a flowery dell\n\nMoonlight and love from Berkenfell11\n\nAnother essay most uncivil\n\nWherein I’m called “an ugly devil”!\n\nRI MS JT/2/5/181–2\n\n1 This poem exists in three very similar versions. It was probably written around 1845, and a version also appears on 10 December 1848 (RI MS JT/2/13b/404), where Tyndall noted in a letter to Ginty that this, written in Halifax, had turned up. He copied it into his journal. The version here is from RI MS JT/2/5/181–2. The others are RI MS JT/8/2/1/51; RI MS JT/2/13b/404.\n\n2 Sam Weller’s: the pseudonym for John Roberts.

This poem includes three drawings of Tidmarsh’s nose.\n\n48 Tidmarsh’s nose1 c.1846\n\nThou ugly sample of the nasal throng\n\nDirty within and misshapen without\n\nWith thee what poet would pollute his song\n\nThou huge offensive miscreated snout\n\nThou libel upon all the human race\n\nUnlucky Tidmarsh I to thee appeal\n\nSay why the Furies planted on your face\n\nA type so ugly of an infants heel\n\nI’ve heard of many beaks & nose"
