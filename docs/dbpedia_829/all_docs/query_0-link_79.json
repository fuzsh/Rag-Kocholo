        "text": "Spoiler warning:\n\nThe following page contains spoilers for the plot of the Dream SMP.\n\nThis page is about the character from the Dream SMP. For the streamer who plays this character, see Nihachu.\n\nNihachu, more commonly referred to as Niki, is the nineteenth member of the Dream SMP, joining on August 6, 2020. She is a member of the Syndicate and a former loyal member of L'Manberg.\n\nShe was a citizen of L'Manberg during the presidency of Wilbur Soot. During the Manberg Rebellion, she spoke out strongly against the Jschlatt Administration, leading to her banishment and subsequent joining of Pogtopia at the culmination of the Manberg Festival. She fought alongside the Pogtopians during the retaking of L'Manberg, and afterwards was appointed as the Secretary of Treasury by the new President, Tubbo. She expressed tentative sympathy for Tommy during his exile, although she still thought that he was responsible for the consequences of his own actions, and would become frustrated by his apparent destruction of the Community House.\n\nShe and Fundy later left to form Dry Waters, and Niki grew more detached from L'Manberg, ultimately turning against her former nation and burning down the L'Mantree during the Doomsday War. She has since displayed resentment towards Tommy due to all of the conflict he has caused in the past, and collaborated with Jack Manifold in an attempt to kill him before he could start any more turmoil. She was also a L'Manberg traitor during Doomsday alongside Fundy.\n\nNiki is currently living in her underground city, as well as being a member of the Syndicate. As a member of the Syndicate, Niki participated in operations including scouting out Snowchester to verify it's non-governmental status and facilitating the escape of Dream from Pandora's Vault.\n\nPhysiology[]\n\nNiki is a human with light skin, long-lashed brown eyes, and shoulder-length blonde hair which dyes pink. She has many casual outfits, but the one she currently uses is a gray jacket over a black crop top, camo-patterned shorts, and black boots. During peacetime and while expanding her horizons with dates and more builds, she often wore a striped red, orange, cream, and blue sweater, long black pants with a belt, and blue shoes.\n\nHer L'Manberg uniform was different from that of the founders, as she joined after the initial war for independence, but it was similar in the fashion of being a blue suit with gold patterns and a sash across the middle, and in the fact that it included a black-and-white tricorn hat.\n\nShe also had a business suit worn only when needed, which appeared to be a typical tuxedo with the addition of the tricorn hat, and a temporary Christmas outfit where she sported a checkered sweater, long leggings, and a Santa hat.\n\nAs an outcast from Manberg and a member of Pogtopia, she sported an outfit similar to Wilbur's in atmosphere - a beige shirt with short black sleeves and a hood, long black jeans with straps (presumably to hold weapons), and buckled brown shoes. She also kept her hair tied back.\n\nHer villain outfit is similar to her outcast one, with her owning some new peach pink hair, brown boots, and a cream white shirt, as well as Wilbur's old coat and cloak that he wore back in his own spiral. She now sports some dark blue eyes instead of her usual light brown eyes. She tied her hair back once again and her skin tone has darkened by a little. She also wears some black jeans, a brown belt, and a golden necklace around her neck, all of which is from her outcast era.\n\nNiki's new casual skin, has light pink hair with cat ears. She also sports a black jumper with a grey patterned stripe and grey trousers. She has also worn variations of her causal skin; for Pride Month the grey stripe was changed to the Bi Flag, during a black and white stream she wore a color-drained version of the outfit and has worn 3D glasses in tribute of The Gays, The Girls and Jack Manifold (Her MCC Team).\n\nNiki has also stated that no matter what skin she puts on, her character is still wearing Wilbur's cloak and coat.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nIndependence/Election Arc[]\n\nDuring her early days on the server, Niki was very generous and thoughtful. She often gifted people items, specializing particularly in handcrafted cakes from her bakery. Upon first glance, she was easy to dismiss as a stereotypical quiet girl, as she tended to steer clear of avoidable conflict and was always polite and friendly with everyone she came across, but in actuality, there was far more to her than met the eye.\n\nWhile she did often keep to herself, she was by no means a pushover. She was independent, resilient, and very strong-willed, believing firmly in her morals and having no qualms with standing up to and speaking out against those she saw as enemies. When Sapnap killed her pet fox, Fungi, she was fierce not in exacting revenge, but rather securing an apology from him and ensuring that it would not happen again.\n\nWhen Jschlatt took charge of L'Manberg, she was very vocal with her disapproval, heedless of the danger that she was putting herself in. She later pledged her full loyalty to Tommy and Tubbo in order to retake the country. A lot of the time, she felt overlooked and unnoticed by everyone, but kept this hidden, leading to her rising feelings of internal resentment. Although not intrusive, she has always been very observant and curious, and watches things that intrigue her until they are out of sight.\n\nPost-Green Festival[]\n\nAfter seeing L'Manberg and the people tied to it go through so much, Niki's character changed considerably.\n\nShe still stays true to herself and to her own beliefs, and that has not changed, but she no longer shows empathy for the people she blames for the downfall (namely Tommy, who seemingly committed grave wrongs and faced zero punishment in her eyes).\n\nShe feels like the original ideals of L'Manberg have been warped beyond the point of repair, and finally agrees with the prior assessment made by both Eret and Wilbur - that the nation was never meant to be. She's been unintentionally betrayed enough times that she no longer cares about breaking people's trust herself, and she has grown tired of giving everyone second chances and the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAll of her negative resentments have finally begun to spill, resulting in a harsh change in her former beliefs of forgiveness over revenge. She now actively seeks reparations from the person she thinks wronged her, and is desperate to be recognized for herself for once in her life. In these pursuits, she has even been partnering with Techno's Syndicate, despite her former allegiance against him.\n\nBefore joining the Syndicate[]\n\nAfter working with Jack for a while, Niki had a change of heart. She realized that her anger at Tommy was only because of the built up emotions of other events such as her partner (Puffy) not speaking to her and Wilbur dying at the hands of Philza. These things led her to direct the anger at an easy target - Tommy.\n\nDespite these realizations, Niki still wishes to be recognized for what she had done for everyone. She still believes that the old members of L'Manberg do not appreciate what she had sacrificed and done for them. Wishing to find people who will understand and care for her, Niki joins her old enemy - Technoblade. Her ideals change to anarchist ones, but she also wishes to rekindle her old L'Manberg habits.\n\nWilbur has said that Niki's D&D alignment is neutral good.[3]\n\nHistory[]\n\nBefore the Dream SMP[]\n\nPerfect SMP/Bear SMP[]\n\nSee also: Bearbubb § bearSMP (WikiTubia)\n\nNiki was a part of another Minecraft SMP called the Bear SMP, created by bearbubb. On the server, she played the same character as Nihachu in Dream SMP. Content creators bearbubb and Niki have confirmed that the only thing that connects both SMPs is Niki, and everything else that happened on the Dream SMP or the Bear SMP is not canon to both SMPs' storylines.[4] On June 30, 2021, the day of Niki's first appearance on the Bear SMP, Niki's backstory with bearbubb was provided.\n\nBefore the creation of the \"Dream SMP\" civilization, Niki used to live in the \"Perfect SMP\" civilization and had a good friend called bearbubb. However, she left the SMP because she felt she \"needed a new beginning,\" abandoning the town and her friend. She came across the Dream SMP sometime after this.[5][6]\n\nL'Manberg Independence Arc[]\n\nFirst days[]\n\nNiki joined The Dream SMP during the first interwar period between Dream Team SMP vs. L'Manberg War and the L'Manberg Elections. She was picked up from spawn by TommyInnit and Wilbur Soot, who became her first friends on the server and led her to L'Manberg. Tommy continuously killed her over and over, but the two became friends anyway. There, she had her first interactions with the other L'Manberg members as well as with Eret. Wilbur and Tommy painted Eret as a murderous traitor, still angry with them for their betrayal in the previous war, which was a far cry from what Niki thought of them. She and Eret ended up becoming good friends as well, and Niki created L'Manberg's flag as a symbol of pride for her country. Fundy joined their little posse before too long and gave a pet fox to Niki, which she named Fungi, wanting its name to sound like his. She also built a bakery in order to make the most of her talents and to have an easier time making gifts for everyone.[7]\n\nPet War[]\n\nMain article: Pet War\n\nOn August 25, 2020, Sapnap accidentally killed Fungi, creating a brief period of tension that eventually escalated into the first Pet War.\n\nAttempt at making demands[]\n\nHours after Sapnap's killing, Niki learned from Tommy about the death, expressed anger, and vowed to take revenge, asking Tommy to help her.[8] Shortly after, Niki rejoined and teamed with Tommy to make demands for reparations for both of their pets' deaths by kidnapping fish from Sapnap's house. With the help of Tubbo, the two gained possession of Mars (Sapnap's fish) and Beckerson (George's fish). Niki made it clear that she was not planning to kill the fish and only wanted a written apology, and Tommy asked if he could use the opportunity to make a demand for one of his discs from Dream. Niki agreed, and the three put the plan into motion by attempting to contact Sapnap. Sapnap did not respond, so the three got ahold of Dream. Speaking with Dream, Niki stated that she only wanted an apology and did not want to hold grudges or make enemies. Moments after, Dream demanded proof that they were in possession of the fish. Tommy proved that they had the two fish and started making his demands, and Dream taunted Tommy by playing Tommy's \"Mellohi\" disc, starting a new conflict between him, Tommy, Tubbo. Niki eventually figured that Dream had no control over Sapnap and that she would have to speak to Sapnap instead, leading her to helping Tommy with his conflict. At the end of the conflict, Dream regained possession of the two fish, and Tommy regained possession of his disc.[9]\n\nThe next day, Sapnap logged on. Sapnap briefly apologized to Niki, but remained focused on getting back at Tommy for griefing his house and for taking Beckerson.[10]\n\nRevenge with Fundy[]\n\nDays later, on August 28, Fundy learned of the news. Fundy insisted Sapnap must pay and searched for Sapnap's pets to torture or kill while Niki attempted to maintain peace and wanted to avoid killing pets. Niki's attempts at deescalating the situation ultimately failed, as Fundy pressured Niki into killing Sapnap's fox Skechers, provoking Sapnap and making the situation worse.[11]\n\nAfter war was declared and Dream and Sapnap hid their pets, Niki joined Fundy in locating, kidnapping, and hiding their pets as leverage. At the same time, the two also adopted a bee as a new pet, naming it Beelloon and hiding it in an obsidian bunker across from L'Manberg. In response, Sapnap took Niki's fish from her bakery and blew Fungi's grave up.[12][13] Fundy responded by initiating a duel with Sapnap. Fundy would get Niki's pet fish and his \"drip but brown\" if he won, and Sapnap would get his pets and items he lost while keeping Niki's fish if he won. Sapnap won the duel, but returned Niki's fish to Fundy as a sign of peace.[14][15] Things settled into uneasy peace and Fundy eventually returned the fish to the bakery.[16] Beelloon also later went missing during Fundy's attempt to relocate it,[17] but it is unknown whether or not Niki is aware of this.\n\nElection[]\n\nMain article: SWAG2020 vs POG2020 Election\n\nOn September 14, 2020, Fundy approached Niki about starting a new party for the election since he didn't believe that the candidates in POG2020 and SWAG2020 were loyal to the country. After catching up on the recent events, Niki agreed, and the two decided to name the party \"Coconut2020.\"[18] On the day where the parties announced their endorsements in a rally, Niki and Fundy showed up late to announce their run. Although the other candidates disliked the party, pressure from the crowd forced them to give Coconut2020 a chance to speak and a place on the ballot. However, the two left the rally early since they had no endorsements.[19] In the end, the party was the least popular among viewers, only gaining 9% of the votes. The party was also accused of voter fraud, but the blame was pinned on Fundy since he was the only programmer of the group.[20]\n\nManberg Rebellion Arc[]\n\nMain article: The Manberg Rebellion Arc\n\nDuring the Manberg Rebellion Arc, Niki was the most vocal member when it came to opposing Jschlatt.\n\nElection aftermath[]\n\nWhile Schlatt made his first decrees as self-appointed \"Emperor\" of L'Manberg, Niki became upset and appalled. After Schlatt made the order to banish Tommy and Wilbur from L'Manberg, Niki shouted out in distress and watched the two get chased out.[21] She later messaged Tommy offering to give armor, but was rejected since Wilbur wanted to lay low.[22] After Schlatt's order to tear down the country's walls, Niki protested against it by refusing to assist and by confronting Fundy about helping Schlatt.[23]\n\nNiki later confronted Quackity, and Quackity agreed to have a private meeting in Jack Manifold's house. Quackity agreed with Niki that the changes were \"too harsh,\" but pushed back at Niki's statement that they had no power to do so. After Quackity asked for a solution, Niki suggested that he turn against Schlatt since Schlatt didn't show much respect to anyone and didn't care about what he took. Quackity began freaking out, and Schlatt started approaching the house. In panic, Niki hit Quackity, who was on half a heart, killing him and causing a commotion. Quackity temporarily became a ghost, and Schlatt and the Manbergians imprisoned Niki behind bars in Jack's house. Schlatt told her that there was no more L'Manberg and that she was his new country's first ever prisoner. In response, Niki told Schlatt that he would pay for the changes and escaped shortly after Quackity secretly helped break the walls of the prison.[24] Due to her retaliation, Schlatt decided to raise Niki's taxes.[25] Alongside Eret, Niki watched in dismay as Fundy burned the flag of L'Manberg that she had worked for hours to make.[26] Niki refused to give up on L'Manberg, however, and instead began working with her own group of allies with the aim of overthrowing Schlatt.\n\nTax day[]\n\nOn tax day (September 23, 2020), Niki began discussing with HBomb about a potential revolution they could hold. She attempted to recruit Tubbo to her cause, unaware he was a spy already. Not wanting to break his cover, Tubbo purposefully avoided her questions. Afterwards, Niki argued with Fundy and discovered he was rebuilding the flag he burnt down. She climbed to the top and attempted to fight him, but he ignored her. She then began destroying blocks whenever he placed them, and the two argued further before Niki left, telling Fundy she hated him.[27][28]\n\nWhile Niki walked towards the Camarvan to access an ender chest to grab iron for a flint and steel, Schlatt noticed her. Niki attempted to hide, but failed, as he had already spotted her when she noticed. Schlatt reminded her about it being Tax Day, and Niki refused to pay. While Schlatt attempted to look for her home to collect taxes and talked about the country's plans, Niki grabbed iron from her ender chest and began burning the flag. Managing to start a fire on the pole, Niki fled the scene and hid from Fundy. She eventually snuck her way back to her bakery, and Wilbur contacted her to offer help with recovering any items that Schlatt might have stolen.[29]\n\nAfter finishing her conversation with Wilbur, Niki decided to move out of Manberg into Tommy's holiday home since she feared that the administration would take action against her for burning the flag. Arriving at the Holiday Home, Niki gave Henry a speech, sparking hope in herself for the future. Whilst taking items from her bakery to bring with her and returning to set the flag on fire again, she discovered that the administration was holding a meeting and hid.[30] The administration noticed that the flag was burning, but decided not to take action since they were already planning to rebuild the flag with nonflammable materials.[31]\n\nStating that the flag burning was just the beginning, Niki decided to try to trap the Second White House. After collecting some supplies, Eret contacted her offering to help. However, since Eret was busy, the two decided to meet later.[32] After Schlatt announced the Manberg Festival, Niki and Eret made plans to try and assassinate Schlatt with TNT.[Citation needed] However, their plan never came into fruition.\n\nWhilst living out in Tommy's Holiday Home, Niki was allowed back into Manberg whenever she wanted due to leaving on her own accord not being exiled. While looking after Henry, she started writing letters to an unknown person who she only ever referred to as \"friend.\" She told them about everything that had happened and that she didn't think that people would live through it. Niki also asked them to come and help her, but it is unknown if they ever came.[33]\n\nWar of the Burning Eiffel Tower[]\n\nFollowing Sapnap's accidental killing of Henry, Niki expressed sympathy for Tommy and helped him build a grave for his cow, as she had experienced something similar with Fungi. Following the grieving, Niki helped Tommy come up with the idea to grief Sapnap's Eiffel Tower for revenge and griefed it with him alongside Dream. She also attempted to help Tommy distract Antfrost, BadBoyHalo, and Skeppy after they attacked him for griefing Bad's mansion and attempting to frame Bad, but died by falling off the Reverse Coaster.[34]\n\nAfter Sapnap joined the server, Niki returned to Tommy's side to support him. She was unarmed, unprotected, and only had an iron sword, but still tried to kill him after he ate Henry's remains in front of Tommy and he crowed. Niki was killed, but returned to the Eiffel Tower with a sword and full iron armor she received from HBomb shortly after. Upon arriving, Niki, Tommy, and Dream were ambushed by Sapnap, who was supported Bad, Skeppy, and Ant. Since Tommy and Dream had fled to safety, Niki was left alone, allowing the four to take Niki as hostage.[35]\n\nAttempting to lure Sapnap's group away from Niki so she could escape, Tommy offered to show Sapnap his kidnapped fish in exchange for her release. Her captors were swayed by this and left her trapped with only Antfrost to protect her. Unarmed, Niki couldn't get past Antfrost, so she secretly asked Ant if he was willing to negotiate. Ant remembered the time she had given him free food from her bakery. Niki agreed to help him with his zoo if he let her escape. Tommy shouted for her to run, which she did and ended up running down the Prime Path. However, Ant chased her and told Sapnap he was going to kill her which led to her yelling at him that they had a deal. Sapnap immediately grew suspicious of Ant, who said that he was killing her again. Realizing he was lying to cover up her escape, Niki thanked him and ran to safety whilst Ant lied and said he lost her.[36]\n\nWhilst hiding nearby, Niki witnessed the Battle of the Lake and tried to help Tommy, Technoblade, Dream, and Punz. However, she was accidentally killed in the confusion by Techno.[37]\n\nManberg Festival[]\n\nMain article: Manberg Festival\n\nPrior to the festival's start, Niki chatted with Tubbo and other guests while walking around and looking at the festival area. In addition, Niki also played Ponk's Drop the Man Minigame. Niki was dropped into the tank by Awesamdude, and Fundy walled her in, causing her to drown. After some time, the Manberg leaders called the guests to the podium and announced the beginning of the festival.[38]\n\nDuring Schlatt's welcoming speech, Niki shook her head and refused to cheer for him. In addition, she also made thinly disguised remarks about L'Manberg and how it was better then Manberg. Throughout the party, she grew more frustrated and tried to make Schlatt drunk enough so he would tell her and Technoblade state secrets. When it failed, she went to the boxing match with the others and watched everyone fight it all out, much to her disgust. Deciding to take a break, she walked to the nearest ender chest where she put her sword. Looking up, she saw Tommy standing opposite her and immediately returned to the boxing as if she saw nothing.[39]\n\nDuring Tubbo's speech, Niki expressed annoyance at everything he said in favor of Schlatt. Following Tubbo's speech, Schlatt revealed that Tubbo was a traitor and called for his execution. Niki cried out in his defense and attempted to get Technoblade to stop by screaming from the crowd, but was silenced as he executed Tubbo. She herself was then caught in the crossfire and returned to seeing Tommy being hunted by the crowd. Witnessing Tommy's death, she tried to kill Schlatt with her fists, but failed. Not noticing Niki's punches, Schlatt called everyone back to the podium for his second speech.[40]\n\nAs Manberg's administration and the guests settled down for the speech, Niki, horrified disgusted by the events, began berating Schlatt before the crowd. In response, Schlatt declared her banished and ordered for her to be executed as well. She was saved by Wilbur, who had been present and in hiding. With Schlatt distracted, Niki made a run for it. Unarmed due to Techno's crossfire, Niki was chased by an equally badly equipped Ponk. Despite holding out for a long time, Ponk killed her (non-canonically).[41]\n\nRespawning at the boxing arena, Niki quickly made her way out of Manberg towards Pogtopia. Wilbur and Tommy invited her to live with them in Pogtopia along with Tubbo and Technoblade. Once there, Tommy and Tubbo informed her of Wilbur's plot to destroy all of Manberg with TNT, which frightened and angered her. She formed a small sub-faction with the two in which they agreed to retake L’Manberg and keep it safe by any means necessary. Watching the sunset behind Manberg with Tommy's disc playing, the three agreed to stick together no matter what.[42]\n\nSecret city & birthday party[]\n\nAs events compiled leading up to the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, Niki began grinding for gear along with many of the others. She was not present when Quackity turned on Schlatt and joined Pogtopia, but she was willing to trust him anyways.\n\nOn Niki's birthday, Karl decided to hold a party at the Haunted Mansion he and Niki built together. Whilst he and Niki worked on crafting a cake, Skeppy and Bad called people and sent invitations, stating that Niki would cry if they didn't appear, much to her protest. After the guests gathered at the haunted mansion, people began arguing with Wilbur over the festival due to the attendees being on different sides. The situation was defused shortly after, and Niki got everyone to dance. Everyone then went outside and began to party properly together. Karl gave Niki her birthday present, which was Quackity stripping, singing, and dancing on the table in front of her. Wilbur played the guitar and sung her happy birthday.[43]\n\nAfter the party, Niki, Karl, Quackity, and Wilbur hung out together for a bit. Quackity sung Wilbur a song, and things began going sour. Wilbur insulted everyone, began running towards Manberg, and said he was going to blow up the country. Niki chased after Wilbur along with Quackity, and Karl. Arriving at Manberg, Wilbur asked to sing Niki a song and then began to sing the L'Manberg Anthem to her. Niki screamed at Wilbur to stop, interrupting the song. Quackity eventually dissuaded Wilbur by stating that he will speak to Schlatt, and Karl and Niki were left on Party Island together where they had a short disagreement on whether to call it L'Manberg or Manberg. After thanking Karl for the party, Niki logged off.[44]\n\nShortly before the assigned date of the war, Niki started working on digging out a secret underground city. It was intended to be used by refugees and those who wished to live in peace, or potentially as a last resort if the war went badly. She shared her secret with no one but Karl, and while Karl decided to fight on Manberg's side, he promised not to tell anyone about it.[45]\n\nRutabagville[]\n\nMain article: Rutabagville\n\nIn the time leading up to the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, Niki and Karl also started a small nation of peace of their own named Rutabagville on November 5, 2020. Niki enjoyed Rutabagville and even mentioned the possibility of leaving Pogtopia to live there in peace.[46] However, in the time between the creation of the country and the day of the war, Karl made a major decision to the country while Niki was away. Karl agreed to join Manberg in the war and let Jschlatt incorporate Rutabagville into the country as a state or district. Schlatt also asked Karl not to tell Niki due to her known ties to Pogtopia.[47][48]\n\nManberg vs Pogtopia War[]\n\nMain article: Manberg vs Pogtopia War\n\nDuring the prelude of the war, Niki walked around and spoke to many members about the upcoming war and who the traitor could be. First, Niki spoke to Karl. Karl told Niki about and apologized for his decisions of joining Manberg and giving Schlatt Rutabagville. Niki expressed disappointment at Karl for selling out Rutabagville, but still agreed to stay friends and trusted Karl with the secret of her city. Karl left call while pretending to tell the others about the city, breaking her trust.[45]\n\nWhile making her way back to the Greater Dream SMP region from her city, Niki joined Techno, Tubbo, and Quackity's voice chat. Niki, who was not present during Dream's announcement, learned that there was a traitor. After a while, Niki and Techno were left alone. Niki mentioned that she didn't trust Techno since he killed Tubbo, and Techno attempted to defend himself.[49]\n\nAfter Fundy joined, Niki asked to speak to Fundy privately. Niki asked Fundy to put aside their differences (the burning of the L'Manberg/Manberg flags) and work together, stating that she was not the traitor. Fundy shared that he'd been on Pogtopia's side all along and told her about his diary. Fundy then questioned if Niki was a traitor, leading to Niki telling him about the secret city and stating that she wanted to live in peace. The two started discussing Wilbur, his plan to blow L'Manberg up, and the potential traitor. In the end, the two decided that they could trust each other.[50]\n\nNext, Niki, Fundy, Eret and others met near Tommy's holiday home to discuss each server member's side in the upcoming war and the potential traitor. When Eret's name came up in the conversation, Niki defended Eret and stated that Eret wouldn't betray them again. After Fundy put Wilbur on the board on the side of Pogtopia, Niki became upset and stated that Wilbur had gone too far to the point where she couldn't recognize him. She stated she had joined L'Manberg and supported this war because of her best friend (Wilbur) and that she felt like she had no reason to continue in this war. However, she also felt obliged to fight to protect L'Manberg and reminded Fundy that L'Manberg was important.[51]\n\nWith the discussions over, Niki started crafting weapons and armor. Using supplies from her ender chest, Eret, and HBomb, Niki crafted a diamond sword and an almost-full set of netherite armor. Upon returning one last time to Pogtopia to go over plans, Wilbur showed a pet fox named Mushroom that had been left for her by Antfrost as a peace offering, telling her to think of it as something to fight for. Niki stared at it and started remembering \"an old friend,\" and the conversation moved onto Pogtopian preparations. Technoblade led everyone to his own secret bunker, and Niki became amazed by all of the loot he had amassed. For the first time since she'd joined the server, Niki donned a enchanted tools and a full set of enchanted netherite armor. Equipped with tools and armor, the Pogtopians rolled out and pushed towards Manberg.[52]\n\nDuring the actual fighting, she mostly stuck with her close friends and was able to snipe down a few of her enemies. Although she expressed concern for Wilbur due to his lack of armor and \"loose canon\" mentality, Niki remained positive throughout the fighting. She witnessed Schlatt's death in the Camarvan and was delighted upon their apparent victory, congratulating Tubbo on becoming the new president of the restored L'Manberg. Whilst taking down Manberg decorations to make way for the return for L'Manberg, Niki accidentally destroyed a brick beneath the podium revealing that it had been filled with TNT. She became shocked and looked back on the others, but decided to replace the block and continue taking the decorations down.[53]\n\nWhen Philza joined and Technoblade turned on the L'Manbergians, Niki became confused and blindsided, having been unaware of his anarchist ideals. She was devastated when Wilbur set off his explosives, destroying the majority of central L'Manberg. She nearly lost heart in the face of the destruction and the withers Techno had summoned, but was encouraged by Tommy to keep fighting because \"it isn't gone yet.\" Keeping her distance from the fighting, Niki used her bow from the top of an undestroyed hill and helped to kill the withers.[54]\n\nNiki was unaware that Wilbur had lost all of his canon lives and was dead, instead insisting that he had gone missing in action. She was integrated into the Tubbo Administration, being appointed as New L'Manberg's Secretary of Treasury.[55]\n\nRetribution Arc[]\n\nWar aftermath/reconstruction[]\n\nOnce L'Manberg had been partially rebuilt and everyone had time to settle, Niki decided to meet up with Fundy on November 25, 2020. The two began doing a recap of what happened in the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, as Niki had been MIA since the war and had not seen anyone for months. Together, they walked around the server and made note of everything they saw. Somewhere along the way, Fundy mentioned Wilbur's demise and Niki was shocked. It slowly sank in that her best friend was dead, and nobody had told her about it for months.[56]\n\nUpon arriving at L'Manberg, Niki became awed at the new flag's design and at how well it was recovering from the damage it had suffered. When Fundy credited Ghostbur for most of the reconstruction, Niki became bewildered and uneasy, and dismissed the concept of Wilbur's return as a ghost, instead interpreting it as a hope that he was still alive. Fundy also showed Niki Ghostbur's house, but she thought he made it in remembrance. Fundy didn't try to change her mind, and so they continued onto other whereabouts such as Philza's home and her bakery. After they finished their tour, she resumed work on her underground city.[57]\n\nWhen Ranboo joined the server on November 27, Niki was one of the first people to greet him. They quickly became friends, and she gave him a tour around the different factions. When he shared with her that he was planning on running for president in the next L'Manbergian election, she helped him come up with ideas for his campaign.[58] He joined at around the same time as CaptainPuffy, whom Niki also became quite close with.\n\n[]\n\nThe next couple of weeks were relatively uneventful for Niki, save for her date with Captain Puffy on November 28. The date began after Puffy gifted Puffy a red poppy. Puffy accepted it with gratitude, and the two then went together to the Holy Land, where Puffy had pre-arranged a picnic spot for them. It consisted of a classic red and white carpet surrounded by sunflowers and roses. There was a lantern at each corner as well as rendered images of Niki's IRL pets, Zuko and Toph. The food they shared was lettuce, baked potatoes, pie, and \"champagne.\" Niki was openly enthusiastic and heartfelt about the date, and they were able to joke and laugh about a mistake in the images' plugin, setting them off on a good start.[59]\n\nTheir main goal was to build something together once they'd finished their picnic. After a brief discussion, they decided to visit Niki's bakery while they asked Niki's chat for suggestions on what to build. They eventually narrowed it down to either a cottage, a coffee shop, or a flower shop, and ultimately decided on a flower shop. Whilst mapping out the location, the two saw Tommy and Ranboo run past them on the Prime Path and try to get out of Niki's vision. Additionally, both Tommy and Ranboo acted awkwardly and seemed to be confused. Puffy and Niki brushed it off as their normal behavior.[60]\n\nLater, Niki and Puffy both found George's house on fire and attempted to extinguished it. Niki quickly deduced that Tommy did it and was attempting to blame her. They confronted Tommy and Ranboo about it, but the two played dumb and left, so they returned to the flower shop. They enjoyed building it together, and although Fundy and Ranboo later jokingly attempted a takeover, the two women defended their shop, leading the other two to instead build a rivalling ice cream shop nearby.[61]\n\nThings seemed to be going pretty well until Dream ran across the flower shop while removing the walls of the Holy Land. Shortly after, Dream started asking them questions such as where the border was drawn between the Dream SMP and L'Manberg. They answered to the best of their ability, but were then shocked when he began building an obsidian wall around the borders. He didn't directly answer any of their questions, which they found to be unsettling, as Puffy was a member of the Dream SMP while Niki was not. They informed Tubbo, Fundy, and Ranboo of the turn of events, and Tubbo declared that he would meet with Dream to discuss what was happening. Their date ended on unsure terms, but Puffy gave Niki a \"promise ring,\" stating that she was happy with the date.[62]\n\nTommy's trial and exile[]\n\nMain article: Exile Conflict § Trial day\n\nAs Niki later learned, the conflict was because Tommy and Ranboo had burned down George's house.\n\nBefore and during a L'Manberg administration meeting where they discussed the possible suspect, Tommy attempted to place the blame on Niki. Fundy defended Niki and cleared her name, stating that she was building a flower shop and on a date with Puffy.[63][64] Nonetheless, Tommy continued attempting to place the blame on Niki. After failing to use Niki and Ranboo as alibis during a meeting with the L'Manberg administration, Dream, and George, Tommy attempted to convince Ranboo to support him in his story where Niki was the one responsible. However, Ranboo did not support the idea and suggested that Tommy take responsibility. After Tommy and Ranboo finished their private conversation, Tubbo called for a trial.[65]\n\nNiki was present during Tommy's trial. After Ranboo was named by George as one of the suspects, Niki defended Ranboo by denying his involvement and telling the group to listen. However, Niki remained silent and shook her head after Tommy attempted to use Niki for his defense by making her one of his witnesses. During Tommy's confession where he stated that he was responsible for everything and said that Ranboo had no involvement, Niki remained silent. After attention shifted to Ranboo, Niki protected Ranboo by stating that he wasn't there and that he did nothing wrong.[66]\n\nNiki was unaware of Tommy's exile until being told by Fundy on December 11, 2020.[67] The same day, she and Ranboo helped Tommy by supplying him with cobblestone for his Nether path.[68]\n\nDry Waters[]\n\nMain article: Dry Waters\n\nAround December 11, 2020, Niki received a message from Tubbo that her fox, Mushroom, had died of a stroke whilst being transported by him back from Pogtopia. She was upset, but didn't blame Tubbo because it had happened of natural causes. Later, Fundy joined the two of them and told Niki that Tubbo had killed Mushroom and was lying. However, Tubbo denied this. Fundy later approached her and told her that they could flee and build a new city together in \"Australia\" to get away from the chaos in the Greater Dream SMP region and L'Manberg. Niki agreed to join, and they began preparing for their leave. Tubbo was sad to see them go, but understood their mindset.[69]\n\nAfter preparing supplies, the two decided to invite more members. The two ended up inviting Ranboo, and the three walked for about a thousand blocks before Fundy told them he'd forgotten the coordinates. Failing to locate the country, Fundy decided to leave the group to find the country on his own. Niki and Ranboo decided to help Tommy in the meantime.[70]\n\nFundy eventually found Dry Waters, and Niki did return to it for a bit. They built a few places and held a mining competition which Niki easily won, forcing Fundy to tweet that he's a furry.[71] After this however, the idea of Dry Waters was soon abandoned. Dry Waters hasn't been mentioned since, and Niki moved permanently into her Underground City.\n\nGreen Festival[]\n\nMain article: Green Festival\n\nNiki returned to L'Manberg after some time away alone in time to catch the festival that Tubbo had planned out in an attempt to assassinate Dream. She participated in party games alongside her friends and former co-citizens, including Puffy, Fundy, Eret, and Ranboo.[72]\n\nAfter Dream arrived and attracted the attention of the festival attendees, Niki followed along with the crowd and witnessed the confrontation between Tubbo, Dream, Technoblade, and Tommy at the destroyed Community House. She, along with Jack Manifold, agreed with Dream on his claim that Tommy was unreliable and a liar. As Niki watched Tubbo and Tommy fight it out, she seemed upset and walked away from the Community House in disproval. After hearing that the fight stopped, Niki returned to the Community House to watch the two apologizing and the fallout of Tubbo giving Dream the disc.[73]\n\nNiki was disappointed and angry to see Tommy so easily allowed back into L'Manberg, especially after seemingly condemning the country to the mercy of Techno and Dream, and expressed resentment towards him for all of the lies he'd told and mistakes he'd made in the past. She yelled from the crowd at him, and Fundy teamed up with Tommy to shut down her feelings of doubt. Niki also yelled that Tommy hesitated following requests that he swear that he didn't destroy the Community House, and Tommy spat on Niki in response. Despite efforts to convince Niki to join Tommy, Niki remained unconvinced that Tommy could be trusted.[74]\n\nNiki was also upset at the reveal of Ranboo's treachery. At first, she argued with him after his outburst regarding sides, but soon came to wonder if he was making a valid point after all. After some reflecting, Niki decided that she did not care about L'Manberg anymore because she didn't want to fight alongside Tommy due to his history of lying.[75]\n\nAfter all was said and done, Niki returned to her prior business and talked with Eret and Jack Manifold, where she was able to cool off.[76] She also formulated an \"upcoming goal\" of her own, although she told no one what it was. Niki started changing her secret city into a secret library to store anything that can help her accomplish her own means. While her intentions are not fully known, she made one thing very clear: she no longer trusted anyone.[77]\n\nDoomsday prelude[]\n\nOn the day of the attack, Niki joined together with Fundy after he stated that he agreed with her assessment and destroyed a large amount of L'Manberg's stored materials. Hours before the war, Niki told Fundy that she was excited for everyone to learn their lesson and realize that L'Manberg had a cycle of fighting and destruction. Niki also stated that she was constantly ignored and that everyone blindly followed Tommy. Fundy clapped at what she said and excitedly told Niki that his reflection led him to the same conclusion. Niki was surprised and expressed skepticism at Fundy, as he had betrayed her multiple times. Fundy attempted to build trust by showing that he had destroyed the L'Manbergian supplies. While Fundy's action made her happy, Niki continued expressing skepticism at the idea of trusting Fundy. The two also made a list of names to teach the lesson to and attempted to get Eret on their side before splitting to prepare.[78]\n\nAfter connecting with her diary, Niki announced that she would not fight and would instead allow L'Manberg to be destroyed, as she wanted everyone else to open their eyes and see that the country's current state was nowhere near what it had been intended to be. The way she saw it, it was no longer about freedom or peace, which were the two things she ever wanted from it. Niki reasoned that the fighting and the killing would disappear if the country was destroyed, as she thought that all of the conflict was around this one place and the people part of it. She also mentioned Fundy, stating that he was selfish and untrustworthy but had the same ideas and always ended up being an ally she fought alongside.[79]\n\nWhile announcing her plan to her diary, Tubbo and the L'Manbergians noticed that there were no supplies and asked Niki to join them in the voice chat. The group did not suspect that Niki was against L'Manberg and offered her diamonds for a set of armor.[80]\n\nBefore the war began, she apologized to Ranboo for lashing out at him the day before. Niki and Ranboo had a long conversation about picking sides and the reactions to Ranboo's speech from the previous day. Ranboo stated that he didn't want to pick a side, but had to defend his friends and show them they he cares for them. Niki stated that she didn't want to defend L'Manberg because of how everyone that cared about it had changed. She explained that everyone involved had hurt her and talked over her. In the end of the conversation, Ranboo told Niki that she had a chance at making herself heard and redeeming herself by fighting with them. Niki thanked Ranboo for his words and promised to fight, and the war began.[81]\n\nDoomsday[]\n\nMain article: Doomsday War\n\n“ \"It was never meant to be.\" ”\n\n—Niki while burning down L'Mantree[82]\n\nDuring the majority of the fighting, Niki watched from the sidelines, occasionally dropping her own TNT on any areas that she saw had not yet been demolished. A little way through, Quackity confronted her about doing nothing. Niki questioned Quackity on why she should fight, stating that Tommy was a liar and that she couldn't support him, even if it was to take Dream down. In the end of the conversation, Niki told Quackity that she had promised Ranboo that she would fight and walked towards the withers. However, Niki did not attack and had conflicting thoughts about what to do. Niki also saw Puffy and attempted to protect her, stating that Puffy had nothing to do with it. After walking around for a while, Niki decided that she was not going to fight for L'Manberg and covertly ignited TNT around L'Manberg[83]\n\nNear the end of the \"battle,\" she saw that the L'Mantree - a tree that had been on the server since before L'Manberg was founded, the last marker of the nation's purity - was still standing. She'd once loved the tree, but upon approaching it, stated that there is nothing left to fight for and burnt it down. She afterwards found a high perch and watched L'Manberg burn from above, delivering her own soliloquy.[84]\n\nWhile looking at the damage, Niki overheard a conversation between Philza and Jack Manifold where she discovered that Philza was the one who killed Wilbur. Niki then realized that the nonstop destruction was a bit much even for her and began moving in to assist, but soon stopped. After everyone discovered the L'Mantree destroyed and questioned who did it, Niki announced to everyone that she was the one who burned down L'Mantree. Technoblade congratulated her, and she thanked him.[85]\n\nNo longer knowing who to trust, she wandered along the sidelines where she saw Ghostbur. Having thought that she was hallucinating, she broke down and ran, blowing up her own house and bakery. Whilst running, she set fire to most of wooden builds that survived the TNT before fleeing to her secret city, proclaiming that she wants to \"burn the memories\" and anything that reminded her of Wilbur and her former allies, officially breaking the new alliance she and Fundy had made only an hour earlier.[86]\n\nShe stayed there until after the Doomsday War had concluded, then hesitantly returned to L'Canyon (what was left of L'Manberg) and met up with Jack Manifold. She angrily told him about her newfound hatred of the former L'Manbergians and of how they looked down on everyone else, saying that she'd burned their tree down right in front of them and they hadn't even noticed until too late. Although at first disagreeing, Jack agreed with her points, and they formed a plan to teach them a lesson about valuing everyone and not just themselves.[87]\n\nPlot against Tommy[]\n\nSee also: Project Dreamcatcher\n\nJack had his own vendetta against TommyInnit, and Niki remembered that all of the conflict was caused by Tommy. The two decided that if Tommy was around, everyone would have someone to hate and if he was gone then maybe the server would be more peaceful.\n\nDays later, while working on her underground city, Niki was contacted Jack Manifold. Upon meeting in her underground city, Jack told her what he knew: In Snowchester, Tubbo was setting up a top secret nuclear defense program, named Project Dreamcatcher, in an effort to kill Dream. As this was considered top secret, only Jack and Tubbo held the knowledge of the program. Tommy was not yet aware of the nukes. Still begrudging Tommy nearly everything that had happened during her time on the server, Niki worked with Jack on a revenge plot, the goal being to lure him onto the test site and get him killed. The two worked out a plan where Niki would pretend to befriend Tommy by claiming that Dream had manipulated her into burning the L'Mantree down. In an effort to get on his good side, she started constructing a cobblestone tower containing pictures of Vikkstar and the Queen of England.[88]\n\nHelping HBomb[]\n\nOn January 19, 2021, Niki met HBomb in L'Canyon. HBomb expressed feelings of doubt about living in Eret's Castle, and the two spoke about the other server members' lack of respect for them. HBomb shared that he wanted to leave the Greater Dream SMP region and live in isolation. He explained that this was triggered by many instances of people taking items from his home without knowing it was his. To prove his point, HBomb showed Niki Tommy's signs and told her about how Sapnap admitted to stealing from him. Niki agreed with his desire to leave, but asked that he keep in contact with her and that he show her the location of his new home. After giving his valuable possessions to Niki and telling her that she can have everything he owned including his armor and trident (which was something Niki had not possessed before), he set out with Niki to find a new location. Niki said that she knew a direction where nobody else lived, so they walked for a while until they eventually found a savannah village. With the help of Niki, HBomb established a new home in the village. In the process, Niki also shared with HBomb that she and Jack were planning to kill Tommy. HBomb expressed concern for her and told her to not take it too far.[89]\n\n[]\n\nMain article: The Syndicate\n\nThe same day, Technoblade set out on a mission to recruit members for his and Philza's newly-formed underground anarchist organization, The Syndicate. Knowing that Niki fought against L'Manberg in Doomsday, Techno requested a meeting with Niki. Niki told Technoblade the location of her secret base, and he met her there. Techno asked what she knew about anarchy, but she told him that she knew it hurt her and everyone else. She was then told that it was more than that, although she needed little convincing. She was then given a choice to join The Syndicate. In response, Niki stated that she was too focused on killing Tommy to go full anarchist and that she would think about it. Technoblade wished her luck with killing Tommy and left. After the meeting, Niki stated that she was allied with Jack and that they needed to finish the job before taking a new commitment. She reiterated that it was hard for her to trust people, including Jack, as she she had realized he wasn't telling her everything, only what he wanted her to know. However, she also added that Techno was hurt the most by Tommy and will return to Techno later.[90]\n\nDisc Confrontation[]\n\nMain article: Disc Confrontation\n\nNiki stood on the path watching Tommy and Tubbo walk to their supposed deaths. Tommy stopped to half-heartedly say sorry to her, although he also did it to everyone else.[91] Niki also was part of the group that followed Punz through the Nether portal to stop Dream from killing Tubbo and Tommy. She then watched as Dream was taken to prison.[92]\n\nEmpowerment Arc[]\n\nAttempted assassination[]\n\nMain article: Project Dreamcatcher § Testing day\n\nOn January 26, 2021, Niki and Jack put their plot in action. Niki went to try and find Tommy in order to lead him to the Nuclear Testing Site and kill him. She couldn't find him, but instead found Jack Manifold who told her that Tommy was at the Big Innit Hotel building site and that Sam Nook had been paid off to give him instructions to find spruce wood, which could only be found at the nuclear testing site. Finding Tommy at the hotel, Niki attempted to catch Tommy's attention but failed, forcing her to wait for him to finish talking to Sam Nook and messing up the timing of their plan.[93]\n\nDespite trying her best, Niki was forced to continuously stop to wait for Tommy on the journey to the test site. Tommy constantly got distracted, walked off, and conversed about watching Avengers: Endgame. He also began acting rude to her and even compared her to Wilbur, making Niki feel extremely overwhelmed and upset. This caused them to be a few seconds late to the test area and miss the target spot. Rather than Tommy dying, they discovered a huge crater where the nuke had landed. Jack and Tubbo were there, but no suspicion was put on her because she had no known connection to Jack or Tubbo.[94]\n\nDisappointed by the results and wanting to discuss the failure, she and Jack told Tommy and Tubbo that they were going to leave and explore together. Alone, the two had a huge argument where Jack got extremely angry at Niki. Whilst the two of them tried to think about what to do next, Niki suggested teaming up with the Eggpire since she knew they didn't like Tommy. Jack didn't like this idea and wanted to team up with the Syndicate instead. Niki was hesitant about this because she knew that would mean using Techno for their own personal gain. The two rejoined Tommy and Tubbo shortly after.[95]\n\nAfter traveling back to Snowchester, Niki and Jack were forced to party at Snowchester in order to seem normal. Whilst at the party, Tommy got the effects of radiation poisoning after being at the test site and was only on half a heart. However, Jack stopped Niki from killing him since Tubbo was there. After the party concluded, Niki and Jack reflected on the events. Jack felt discouraged at the idea of killing Tommy, but Niki convinced Jack to continue pursuing the goal. In the end, the two were unable to develop a new plan and decided to take more time to reflect on the failures.[96]\n\nUnderground city[]\n\nWith the failure of the nuke plot, Niki returned to work on her underground city. Due to her feelings of Wilbur and the lack of food, she refused to eat food and simply jumped off a ledge to reset her food bar.[97] While working on the city, Niki explained certain features that were added. Niki suffered from insomnia and \"night terrors.\" The lack of sleep sometimes caused her to hallucinate. As a result, she built a \"sleeping chamber,\" which looked like a jail cell, with bars across the front to stop her from sleepwalking. Due to her lack of sleep and food, Niki also devoted a lot of time to writing in her diary. Whenever she woke up or thought of something, she sat down and started writing to her diary as if it is a real person so she would not feel alone. This led to her building multiple writing stations throughout the city.[98]\n\nDespite becoming a villain and wanting to kill Tommy, Niki maintained her plan of building the city as a refuge for those who wanted to live in peace. Niki planned to build a large jungle and garden to supply food and house pets. In addition, she planned to build a large throne room with statues and fancy lighting. In this time, Niki also built an aquarium in the city.[99]\n\nWhile traveling home from helping Hannah in the nether, Niki discovered a giant library almost directly next to her secret city. She explored it and found out it was Karl's. Not wishing to cause any harm, she left.[100] She continued work on her underground city, spending a lot of time talking to herself.\n\nAfter joining the Syndicate, Niki decided to change the goals back to an underground city rather than a library. She planned to build apartment rooms, tree farms, and shops so anyone could visit as they please. She also crafted a beacon from a wither star that a wither dropped on Doomsday. Niki later showed Ponk and HBomb around her apartments, also offering to rent it out for one iron ore per night. Ponk was the first person to rent out one of her rooms. Whilst there, she provided him with food and company. She also treated his arm, which Awesamdude chopped off, and managed to heal it.[101]\n\nAfter Kinoko Kingdom was established near her base, Niki explored the country. She didn't seem to mind it being built close to her base, although she expressed a little concern about a country sprouting up on her doorstep. While working, she also mentioned accidentally digging into Karl's Library whilst making a new room underground. While mining during construction of Kinoko Kingdom, Foolish accidentally dug into her city, falling through the roof. Niki gave him lots of stone, so he offered to make her a huge build. However, she asked for tips on how to renovate her city instead. She later hired him to make an underground waterfall and garden in her city, but Foolish insisted to do it for free.\n\nAfter the Red Banquet, Niki had a long period of absence from the SMP. When she returned, she spent most of her time renovating the city and spending time with other members of Syndicate, assuming people who were there would learn to deal with the conflict as death happened so often. The main effect the Banquet had on her was that Ponk moved out, believing she wouldn't want a member of the Eggpire living with her.\n\nJoining the Syndicate[]\n\nSee also: The Syndicate\n\nOn March 6, 2021, Niki made her decision about joining the Syndicate. Niki was tired of her and Jack's plans failing and thought that any further plans would not work out, so she decided to end the alliance with Jack. She stated that she enjoyed working with Jack and would help her, but not continue pursuing the goal they had. Niki also stated that other members had not spoken to her in a while, leading her to feel lonely. She specifically mentioned named Puffy, as they were closest before Doomsday. After walking for a bit, Niki shared that she realized that she never wanted to hurt Tommy. She explained that Tommy was just a child and didn't cause any of her problems such as Wilbur's death. Niki continued, stating that her built-up anger at Wilbur's death caused her to take it all out on Tommy, leading to her making a lot of enemies and becoming alienated. She finished her conversation with her diary by saying that the people living with Technoblade wanted her there and she felt that she finally had a place where she belonged.[102]\n\nArriving at the arctic, Niki followed the compass Techno gave her and discovered Technoblade's cabin. Getting close to the cabin, Niki began faltering, not wanting to speak to him in case it hurt her friends. She also saw Phil there and started walking away since he killed Wilbur. However, her diary convinced her to turn back around because the Wilbur she loved had already been lost long before Phil had intervened. Niki entered the house, deciding she finally wanted a family who would care for her as a person rather than just a member of a faction.[103]\n\nTechnoblade and Phil arrived after her, and the three began speaking. Niki Told Techno that she wanted to accept his deal and join him, and Phil and Technoblade decided that she was ready to tell her everything, giving her a book which explained the Syndicate. Additionally, Technoblade's emotional support bear, Steve, also took a like to her, causing them to trust her even more. While the three prepared for their trip to the Syndicate base, Techno noticed something outside his window. Niki discovered that Ranboo was watching them, and the three asked him why he was spying on them. Since Ranboo overheard the conversation and Niki accidentally revealed that they had a secret, Phil and Techno decided it would be best if he joined as well.[104]\n\nAfter giving Ranboo the same recruitment talk, Phil led Niki, Techno, and Ranboo to the meeting room. At the entrance (a lava pool with a hidden entry that the members jump into), they asked Niki if she was willing to die for them. She replied that she was and decided to jump with all her belongings including her netherite tools and armor. Jumping in, Niki survived and discovered that it was a secret passage. Phil then led the group to the Syndicate room for Niki and Ranboo's first Syndicate meeting. She is told to come up with a codename, and her diary recommend Athena, Hecate, Artemis, and Persephone. Niki considered the names, but decided to defer the decision until later (naming herself Nemesis). Moving on from the codenames, the Syndicate discussed The Egg. Niki was aware of it, but had not seen it. After hearing Techno's explanation of it, she decided that she didn't like it.[105]\n\nWith the discussion of the Egg finished, the Syndicate moved onto their next topic, Snowchester. Not knowing much about the country, the four decided that they would check out Snowchester to see how powerful it was getting. Before leaving for Snowchester, Ranboo realized that the group didn't know about Tommy's death and asked if anyone knew about the recent happenings on the server. Niki revealed that she was underground for the past few weeks and had no contact with anyone. Ranboo then broke the news to them. Niki laughed at the fact he was dead, saying that Tommy was unable to die and would find a way out of the afterlife somehow. Phil and Techno also agreed with her, joking that they needed to see his body to confirm it. The Syndicate then wrapped up their meeting to go investigate Snowchester. While Ranboo and Phil had a private talk, Techno asked Niki about her plan to kill Tommy. Niki admitted that she failed and wished that it was her who killed Tommy, and Techno joked about her taking credit for it.[106]\n\nDiscovering Tommy's revival[]\n\nAfter Jack learned about Tommy's revival on March 12, 2021, Jack met up with Niki in her underground city to spread the news. Niki told Jack that she heard about Tommy dying and didn't believe it. Jack then filled Niki on all the details, telling her that Dream beat him to death with a potato and then revived him. After catching her up with the news, Jack asked Niki if she wanted to rejoin him in a quest against Tommy. Niki refused, saying that she didn't want to hurt Tommy anymore and that Tommy wasn't the source of her issues. Jack questioned her motives for not joining him, stating that Tommy sacrificed L'Manberg for his discs and that they were in the right because they did not sacrifice a nation. Niki questioned Jack about if they needed nations, and Jack questioned her about what her city was. Niki then revealed that there was no government and that the city was a free place for everyone. Frustrated, Jack pushed back at Niki's anarchist argument and questioned her about how the city ran without any sort of structure. In an attempt to make a point, Jack slaughtered some of her chickens, saying that she had no reason to stop him if she believed in no laws and thought that everyone was equal. Niki responded that she forgave him for making the point, but added that he needed to calm down and not be too rash. She also added that she didn't know what to do and needed time to think about it. As Jack left, Niki told him that he would always be welcome in her city.[107]\n\nGeorge's first dream and hell[]\n\nNiki was present in George's first dream. Niki followed Mexican Dream, Bad, and George when they went to look at El Rapids, which was destroyed. After some chaos and confusion on who was responsible for the country's destruction, the four deduced that it was Quackity and made their way to the dating house. There, Mexican Dream set it on fire. After Mexican Dream's departure and the extinguishing of the fire, Niki accused Bad of framing Quackity. The conversation turned to the Egg, with Niki being the only person present not knowing much about it. She soon began growing weary of Bad, and Bad forced George and Niki to visit The Egg. However, before they made it to the Egg Room, DreamXD arrived. George and Niki told him what was happening, causing DreamXD to kill Bad. After a scuffle over Bad's dropped items, Bad fled with his items. DreamXD's voice changed, and DreamXD told George that he should have taken Bad's items. Niki then asked George if he was still dreaming, and George responded that it was real and pinched himself to prove it. Niki left shortly after.[108]\n\nWhile DreamXD learned how to prank, George and DreamXD decided to prank Niki. DreamXD \"sniffed\" for Niki, and the two found Niki on the Prime Path near Punz's base. DreamXD then scared Niki with a scary voice. In response, she ran away in search of someone to comfort her. After George told DreamXD how his actions weren't a prank, DreamXD and George found Niki hiding outside Puffy's therapy office. George told her that DreamXD had learned how to make a good joke and asked her for another chance. DreamXD began making squeaking noises and told Niki that he and George had placed her shoes at Church Prime.[109]\n\nWhen Niki arrived at Church Prime, she found that her shoes weren't there. DreamXD told Niki that they were on her feet the whole time, and Niki felt embarrassed but unimpressed at the joke. After deciding to tell another joke and getting consultation from George, DreamXD sent Niki to the afterlife, killing her permanently. He eventually brought her back, but she was extremely scared and told George she had \"seen things.\" In her time in hell, she was there for around sixteen minutes. It is unknown what she saw in hell, as she ran back to her underground city, crying when she was brought back.[110] It is unknown if DreamXD truly took Niki to hell or if the trip was canon at all.\n\nWilbur's revival[]\n\nOn Techno's birthday, Niki and the rest of the Syndicate members threw a surprise birthday party at his house. The members ate cake, joked about blowing up more countries, and had a good time. After some celebration, Techno decided to catch up on what he had missed during his vacation. Philza brought up the revival book and how Wilbur had been revived. Shocked by how casual the other members reacted and how they thought Wilbur had changed, Niki went into a state of panic. She spoke about how she was terrified of Schlatt coming back and tried to change the subject several times. When Ghostbur was brought up, Niki got even worse - realizing that Wilbur had been back as a ghost and he'd never even tried to visit her in the long time he's been on the server.[111] After Technoblade noticed that Quackity was watching from a nearby mountain, Techno went off to speak with Quackity. When they finished their conversation and Techno went back to the party, he told the group that it was an IOU discussion. Niki gave him pumpkin pies she baked, told him that it sounded like the IOU was from someone who often gave empty promises, and named Wilbur as someone who fit the description.[112]\n\nMourning and changing[]\n\nAfter Techno's celebration concluded, Niki reflected on Wilbur's resurrection and his history in a soliloquy. Niki started where she had left off at Techno's birthday table and walked to Phil's house while wondering why Wilbur had to be revived. Inside Phil's house, Niki told the picture of Wilbur there that he was out of her head. She then asked why he returned and what he wanted. After, Niki head outside and wondered what his plans were because she planned stop them, no matter what the plans were. She stated that she wouldn't join him, as she knew his lies.[113]\n\nNiki began making her way back to her city while wondering who Wilbur might manipulate next. She considered Wilbur targeting Jack while comforting herself by saying that Jack was too smart to fall for Wilbur's lies. She continued, stating that Wilbur never cared or changed, that he and Dream were people who ruled over countries and did not care about the people; Wilbur had sacrificed his life for power, and that now that he had returned, everything would revolve around him again. Before returning to her city, Niki repeated that Wilbur invaded her safe haven and that she had blamed herself for Wilbur's mistakes, betrayal, and how he had hurt her and others. Niki elaborated that the blame brought her nowhere and stated that she was to weak to sleep or eat to continue work on her city.[114]\n\nAfter searching through her chests, Niki found Wilbur's diamonds that he had given her at her bakery and took them. She stated that nobody had told her that Wilbur had been revived and began mining a tunnel in one of the rooms of her underground city. Niki then said that nobody told her that Wilbur had been revived since they knew what would happen and that they did not care. She then began thinking that she should not care about it.[115]\n\nNiki stated that Wilbur had been Ghostbur, that she had seen Wilbur's body, and that the TNT he had placed; She trusted Wilbur so much that she had told nobody about it and hid the TNT with blocks. Niki stated that in the end, Wilbur still blew up L'Manberg. She added that Wilbur never cared about the people, was selfish, and only wanted power. Ghostbur had just forgotten about her, and she was alone for months because Wilbur never checked in with her. Niki then placed her and Wilbur's diamonds in a chest in the tunnel, stating that Wilbur was just a memory and that he couldn't hurt or promise her anything anymore.[116]\n\nAfter burying Wilbur's diamonds, Niki left her city for a walk, questioning Dream's motive for reviving Wilbur and Wilbur's purpose of returning. Making her way towards L'Manberg, she then stated that Wilbur had promised to get her out of Manberg and that she waited for so long. Niki explained that Wilbur had changed into a different person when the time came and she met Wilbur again. He wasn't the person she used to know, and he only loved L'Manberg's idea.[117]\n\nLooking over the L'Manberg crater, Niki said that Wilbur was not the only one who fought for L'Manberg and that he had turned people who trusted him against each other. She continued, questioning what he would fight after his resurrection. She made her way to the remains of her bakery, which she blew up during Doomsday. Niki stated that she wanted to know why Wilbur never came back to her. Niki then left the L'Manberg crater and glanced at Tommy's bench before continuing down the Prime Path. While walking down the Prime Path, she paused near the ice cream and flower shops to reminisce the fun she had with Puffy. Continuing, she walked back through the community nether portal, finally at peace with herself.[118]\n\nVisit to BearSMP[]\n\nApproximately five years since leaving the Perfect SMP, Niki decided to visit her friend Bear and sent him a few letters saying that she would visit him soon. Upon meeting with bear, Niki told Bear about the Dream SMP and spoke of her experiences there with bitterness, saying it didn't work out and she regretted leaving the Perfect SMP. After some catching up, Bear toured her around the Bear SMP. Niki resisted Bear's idea of having any sort of ruling structure, displaying her hatred of government. In addition, Niki also reconnected another one of the Perfect SMP members, Ori. At the end of the tour, Niki was asked if she would stay in the BearSMP. She replied that she had responsibilities back in Dream SMP, but would not leave bear again. Niki added that she would have to travel back and forth a lot, meaning that the two SMPs occur in roughly the same timeframe.[119]\n\nPrison Break[]\n\nMain article: Pandora's Vault jailbreak\n\nNiki was in her underground city when she received a message from Techno to meet at the Syndicate headquarters immediately. Confused, she headed over to his house through her garden Nether path with haste, and although she got lost for a while, she managed to find her way through the snowy desert. She jumped through the lava and into the Syndicate meeting room where Techno and Phil were waiting.[120]\n\nWhilst Niki noticed that Ranboo wasn't present, Techno informed Niki of his time in the prison and how he was going to break Dream out. Niki and Phil expressed shock and displeasure at the idea, and Techno then told them about how he thought Ranboo was imprisoned. Techno then pitched the idea if simultaneously breaking Dream and Ranboo out, and the two agreed to help him, even if it meant Dream being freed. With the decision made, the three plus the new member of the Syndicate, Techno's dog Apollo, went to the blueprint room where Techno explained his plan. He instructed Niki to stay outside the prison to pull him out if necessary and to keep her involvement with them a secret because she publicly had no known ties with the Syndicate. She was given the task of mingling with people and creating a distraction if necessary. Niki was also given materials to build withers and instructed to secretly set off as many withers as possible if Phil set off the signal. Prepared to execute the plan, the three rode over to the prison on horses.[121]\n\nTechno and Apollo entered Pandora's Vault, and Niki and Phil stood outside chatting and waiting for a while. Niki and Phil began to feel uneasy, and Niki turned around to see Fundy and Foolish standing on a hill watching them. Niki thought the two were prison guards, and Niki and Phil came up with a cover story for her whilst Phil hid himself in a cave. Turning around, Niki noticed that the guards had vanished and looked around the area. Failing to find find them, Niki waited alone and began having an existential crisis, breaking down from the stress. Suddenly, the prison alarm went off. Philza told Niki to pretend to be an innocent bystander, although she was jittery and terrified.[122]\n\nNiki eventually bumped into Eryn, Sapnap, Michaelmcchill, and Punz. None of them heard the alarms, but Niki mentioned them and pretended she didn't know what the alarms were for, making the group suspicious. Niki managed to talk through the suspicion, welcoming Michael and Eryn to the SMP and saying that she had been alone in her city for six months. The members became intrigued with her city and asked her to show, and Punz insisted that they visit McPuffy's first to grab food. As the members began \"buying\" food, Sam arrived and instructed everyone to run to the prison to stop Dream from breaking out. Niki acted shocked and followed the group to the beach. In shock and disbelief, the group ran around on the beach shouting at one another whilst Niki watched from a distance silently. Sam then teleported away, and Tommy took charge. Eryn became suspicious of Niki and began interrogating her, but Tommy interrupted them, leading to Eryn riding away with the others. As Dream escaped outside the prison, Niki set off many withers after Phil sent the signal. In the process, Sapnap ambushed Niki as she attempted to spawn more, forcing her to flee and causing her to drop her pickaxe.[123]\n\nIn haste, she escaped to L'Manberg and used the portal to navigate to the Nether. However, upon arriving in the Nether, she spot everyone in pursuit of the others running down the path. Sapnap and Eryn saw Niki and attempted to chased her. Eryn managed to catch up with her, but decided to let her go due to his conflicting thoughts and ignorance of Dream's actions. Niki arrived in Logstedshire and searched the area in confusion, wondering what it was and finding its blown up remnants as well as a pile of blue left by Ghostbur. After a while, she silently returned to the Nether and then to Techno's house.[124]\n\nArriving near the cabin, Niki informed the others that Sapnap saw her spawning withers. During a sellout session, Niki noticed that Connor there but not Ranboo. She was informed that Ranboo had been killed in the escape and was horrified. Connor accepted Techno's invitation to join the Syndicate before leaving to build a dirt house nearby, and the three discussed how weird it was that he was in prison. Connor returned, and the four sat down to discuss things further. Techno showed Niki the picture Ranboo dropped before he died, and it was a picture of MICHAEL, Ranboo's son. The four realized they needed to protect and help MICHAEL. Techno left to speak with Tubbo, and Niki returned to her city to hide.[125]\n\nLegacy Arc[]\n\nJack's confrontation[]\n\nHours later, Jack Manifold traveled to Niki's city to question her about what she had done that day. Niki initially gave vague answers, but soon broke down, saying that she had to help Ranboo and that she wished that it had never gotten to the withers. The two argued, with Jack saying she shouldn't have let Dream out for Ranboo and her saying she couldn't let Ranboo stay in there. Jack asked why she helped Techno with his favor, and Niki argued that Techno was his friend leading to this confrontation.[126]\n\nAfter they stopped arguing, Jack told Niki about where he'd been and said that he felt that the world was against him and that Niki was the only one who seemed to agree with him. They soon argued again, but this time over the value of their friendship. Niki admitted to Jack that she never tried to look for him, but added that she was busy and that he wasn't the center of attention. Niki stated that wasn't going to help him, as she felt like she tried her best to do what's right - get Ranboo out of prison. As the two continued, emotions ran high until Niki gave in and said that she only wanted to give people happy lives and second chances. Niki mentioned that she wanted Jack to help her in her underground city of peace instead of running away, adding that she wouldn't have to be involved with Technoblade anymore. The two made up and apologized, accepting their own flaws. In addition, Jack gave Niki the coordinates to New Manifold Land so they could keep in touch.[127]\n\nReconciliation with Wilbur[]\n\nOn August 10, 2022, Niki reunited with Wilbur in the Community House, who was crafting a cake as a gift for Niki. Niki told Wilbur that she came there after Eret informed her that he was looking for her, and Wilbur awkwardly admitted that he wasn't ready yet. Niki then asked cautiously why he was there, and Wilbur offered to fill her in on what happened and did so.[128]\n\nWith Niki caught up, the two exchanged small talk awkwardly. Niki then brought up his broken promise, quietly expressing her emotions about having been abandoned, and Wilbur explained that he was unwell mentally. Niki went on to explain to him about feeling left in Manberg, and Wilbur expressed remorse for his actions, acknowledging how he couldn't do anything about it regardless. Despite everything, Niki expressed that she was both happy and angry that he was back simultaneously, stating she could forgive him while adding that she'd never forget.[129]\n\nWilbur presented Niki with the cake he'd finally managed to make, and it was awful because he mixed up salt and sugar, but Niki still appreciated the gesture. Relieved at that catastrophe, Wilbur recounted his experiences of his apology tour, explaining that he knew he had wronged her the most and that he wanted a clean slate. He explained that he wanted to do one good deed with her, but got interrupted by ConnorEatsPants, who ended up getting carted along to do the good deed. After a few interruptions, Wilbur expressed that there was one person (Ghostbur) who he could not apologize to. Wilbur mentioned a desire to find and threaten DreamXD, so that he could apologize to his ghost counterpart properly. The three dug up friend the sheep, with Wilbur explaining that he wanted to send friend to limbo with Ghostbur.[130]\n\nWilbur offered Connor up as the guinea pig to threaten DreamXD, informing him that he needed to break the rules and use an X-Ray texture pack in order to summon the god. As expected, DreamXD arrived near instantly, teleporting to the group. Wilbur popped the question with Niki's support, but DreamXD said he would kill Connor and Friend. Niki disagreed, but Wilbur asked for Connor's permission. Connor disagreed before being instantly killed (he was on his last life), and DreamXD left without touching Friend. Wilbur and Niki recoiled from having gotten a man killed before going off to ritualistically sacrifice Friend in a hole, shearing his blue wool for one last time to keep a memory of him. Before leaving, Wilbur handed Niki some diamonds she had given to him during L'Manberg, saying he had no need for them anymore.[131]\n\nEnding[]\n\nOn December 17, 2022, Niki traveled to Phil's base to give him baking lessons. During the baking lesson, Phil became increasingly stressed and jumped multiple times until Niki asked him what was wrong. Phil replied that he was tired and jumped in a puddle outside. Eventually, he jumped again and asked her if she heard \"the voice\" too, but she was confused and attempted to calm him down.[132]\n\nWhilst standing on the porch, The Goddess of Death, Kristin, appeared in a lightning strike and introduced herself. Much to Niki's shock, Kristin already knew her name and learnt that the Goddess watched over her from another world. Phil explained his history with Kristen to Niki before Kristin explained that something (Tubbo's nuke) was coming and would destroy them. In order to survive, they would need to travel into The End using a portal. However, neither Niki nor Phil knew what that was, and Kristin soon gathered, to her horror, that it was in fact the Syndicate meeting table.[133]\n\nThe pair led Kristin to the table, and whilst Kristin was preparing it, Niki discovered Connor and his sheep, Rosie. Connor revealed he was now a ghost, and the two had a quick chat, catching up on what had happened. Kristin activated the portal and ordered everyone to jump into it so they could survive, as well as assuring them that Ranboo and MICHAEL were safe. Niki then jumped in after Connor and Rosie, protecting herself from the nuke and ending her story on the Dream SMP.[134]\n\nItems[]\n\nPersonal items Name Notes Promise Ring Given to Niki by CaptainPuffy after their date. She held it in her offhand everywhere until the item was accidentally blown up by a creeper.[135] After the loss of the item, the ring was seen integrated into the left arm of her outcast coat skin.[136] Wilbur's Coat Retrieved by Niki after returning to L'Manberg. She wore it everywhere in remembrance of her friend.[Citation needed] THICCAXE Efficiency V, Fortune III, Mending, Unbreaking III\n\nHBomb's pickaxe. Currently in Niki's possession.\n\nNiki's Diary Despite only been seen once, Niki's diary takes an important part in her life as she carries it in her pockets everywhere. It takes the form of her chat, with its messages appearing as writing on the pages.[2] Niki's Diamonds Three diamonds that Niki gave to Wilbur during his first days on the server. He renamed them \"Niki's Diamonds\" and kept them in his ender chest. Wilbur gave the diamonds back to Niki before leaving for Utah.[137]\n\nPets[]\n\nPets Name Status Residence Notes Fungi Dead (August 25, 2020) Niki's bakery Gifted to Niki by Fundy. Niki named it Fungi since she wanted it to be related with Fundy due to their resemblance.\n\nFungi was accidentally killed on August 25, 2020 by Sapnap when he was pretending to shoot him. The accidental murder of Fungi enraged Fundy and caused The Pet War. Fungi's grave has been robbed and blown up due to events during The Pet War.\n\nBeelloon Dead (September 28, 2020) Beelloon's secret shelter Beelloon was a pet bee belonging to Fundy and Niki adopted during the Pet War. Niki took him to a place opposite the lake in L'Manberg, where they hid him in a cave covered with andesite on the outside and obsidian on the inside as a safety shell. The inside was decorated with cyan wool and flowers so he wouldn't starve.[138] Beeloon was left there for about a month until Fundy had remembered him. Beelloon disappeared when Fundy attempted to free the bee from the bunker and bring it back via boat.[17] Niki Jr Dead (November 3, 2020) Haunted Mansion Niki Jr. was created, named, and gifted to Niki by Karl in the Haunted Mansion after her birthday party celebration.[139] Niki Jr. mysteriously died and could not be found when Niki logged on a day after.[140] Zuko Zuko was gifted to Niki as a birthday gift by Ponk.[141] It is based off of Niki's real life pet cat Zuko. Mushroom Dead (December 11, 2020) Pogtopia Mushroom was an fox left in Pogtopia gifted by Antfrost to Niki before the Manberg vs Pogtopia War. Wilbur also used Mushroom to try to motivate Niki to fight alongside Pogtopia in the war.[142]\n\nWhile Tubbo and Dream were attempting to transport it out of Pogtopia, Mushroom died from fall damage.[143] Tubbo later lied to Niki about Mushroom's death. Although Niki didn't express resentment towards Tubbo for it, she and Fundy decided to leave L'Manberg to create a new country, Dry Waters.[69]\n\nMeowth Alive Underground city Meowth is a parrot that flew into Niki's underground city. She adopted him and planned on turning one of the rooms into a rainforest for him to live in.[144] He was named after the Pokémon Meowth because of the many times Niki and Jack Manifold have been compared to Team Rocket from the series. Shy Alive Underground city Shy is an enderman who lives in a glass case in Niki's city.[145] Niki has mentioned that enderman are one of the only things that her character loves and that they make her feel less alone in her city.[146]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRelationships with members Name Notes\n\nNegative\n\nThough they were on opposite sides of a war in the War of the Burning Eiffel Tower, they formed a truce and were friendly with one another since Antfrost helped her escape after being held hostage.[36]\n\nAfter Niki joined the Syndicate, it is likely their relationship soured a bit due to the Eggpire's plan to conquer the SMP. This is further worsened when the Eggpire attempted to sacrifice all the guests to the Egg.\n\nPositive\n\nDespite the two seldom interacting, they are respectful and kind towards each other.\n\nNeutral/positive\n\nThe two are very kind towards each other, as Niki respects BadBoyHalo's wishes for others to not curse.\n\nAfter Niki joined the Syndicate, it is likely their relationship soured a bit due to the Eggpire's plan to conquer the SMP. This was further worsened when the Eggpire attempt to sacrifice all the guests to the Egg.\n\nDuring December, Niki gifted Bad a diamond block labeled \"Skeppy Jr.\" It's safe to say they are on somewhat good terms now.\n\nPositive\n\nAlthough the two don't interact often, they are kind to each other and exchange items such as food to reassure one another.\n\nPartner\n\nNiki and Puffy went on a date in late November, which allowed them to get to know each other more. Along with building a flower shop together, Puffy gave Niki a diamond \"Promise Ring.\"[147] During the Doomsday War, Niki expressed her claims to not let Puffy die and save her.[148] However, Puffy fought for L'Manberg while Niki betrayed the country by burning down L'Mantree.\n\nLater, the two having opposing feelings towards Tommy (with Niki planning to kill Tommy but Puffy wanting to protect him) put strain on their relationship. When Niki decided to join the Syndicate, she shared that she tried to get in contact with Puffy but had no response.[149][150] Unbeknownst to Niki, it was because she was dealing with the Egg. This led her to feel abandoned by Puffy. However, during the Red Banquet, the two seemed closer - dancing together and talking.\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki and Connor met during the prison break and had some friendly interactions while he followed Techno and Phil back to their base and joined the Syndicate.[125]\n\nNeutral/negative\n\nDream and Niki had a relatively neutral relationship until they took opposite sides during the Pogtopia Manberg War. Since then, Niki has shown a consistent dislike towards Dream. However, these feelings did not convince her to side with L'Manberg during the Doomsday war, as Niki didn't want to side with the L'Manbergians since she felt that they only used her for their own gain.\n\nAfter forming an alliance with Jack to kill Tommy, Niki agreed with Jack in his action of helping Tommy and Tubbo gearing up to fight Dream since Dream was also one of their enemies.[151] Niki later helped imprison Dream by showing up during the Disc Confrontation.[92] The imprisonment of Dream also worked in their favor, as Dream wanted to keep Tommy alive. After the nuke test, they agreed that they had to act before Dream was released from Pandora's Vault.[95]\n\nHoping to help her friend Technoblade, Niki helped break Dream out of Pandora's Vault by providing distractions to cover the breakout. She did not seem to have any outward reservations about this, and when later confronted about her role by Jack, she made no negative references to Dream (even implying she is unsure of her views on him, as she also felt they had also gotten it wrong with their hatred of Tommy). Niki also told Jack that being her friend won't require him to be involved with \"the Syndicate, Techno, or Dream\" implying that she remains open to being involved with Dream again in the future, at least if her friends need her to be.[152] At present, she doesn't seem to harbor much animosity towards him, but is likely still cautiously uncertain.\n\nPositive\n\nAlthough Wilbur and Tommy told her that they disliked Eret, she grew to be really friendly with them. They are also linked by a trio called TEN (Tubbo, Eret, Niki). Eret supported her in The Manberg Rebellion by trying to stop Fundy from burning her flag and supplying her with TNT.[26][32] Additionally, Eret and Niki shared Ranboo's view that people should choose people, not sides.\n\nNeutral/positive\n\nNiki first met Eryn outside McPuffy's while she was trying to distract the group he was with from the then ongoing prison break of Dream, initiated by the Syndicate. She welcomed Eryn to the server and the two exchanged pleasantries. Following this, things turned briefly sour as suspicion of Niki's behavior grew and the alarms at the prison were confirmed to have been tripped.[123] When Niki was ultimately exposed by Sapnap trying to spawn withers to cover the escape of Dream and Technoblade, Eryn went in pursuit of her with the others. However, in a callback to their earlier amiability, Eryn passed up the chance to prevent Niki's escape, allowing her to run right past him in the Nether and reach an exit portal. Eryn repeatedly crouched to show his friendly intent, and Niki returned the gesture as she waited to travel through the portal. Recognizing his help in her getting away, Niki is likely currently on positive terms with Eryn.[124]\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki and Fundy were on the same side in The Pet War and in the L'Manberg Elections. However, Niki was furious with Fundy after he burned down her flag and pretended to take Schlatt's side in The Manberg Rebellion. In the end, Fundy revealed his true intentions, and although it took a while for Niki to be convinced, the two fought together in the Manberg vs Pogtopia War.\n\nFundy and Niki later ran away together and formed Dry Waters far away from the general area of Dream SMP.[153] Though Fundy and Niki had an argument during the Green Festival, they both took the same stance in the Doomsday War and thus created a neutral relationship.[78] Despite this, Niki has said several times that she does not trust Fundy due to his unpredictable changes in opinions and allegiances. She also hasn't completely forgiven him for burning down her flag and feels that he still betrayed her in a way.[78][79]\n\nNeutral\n\nAlthough the two were on opposing sides previously, Niki and George mutually agreed in their distaste for L'Manberg.[Citation needed] Niki was also present during George's first dream where he met DreamXD and taught DreamXD jokes.[154]\n\nNeutral\n\nThe two have never spoken to each other, although they are aware of each other. Ghostbur remembered everything bout her, as Wilbur and Niki had almost no bad memories. Niki also believed that Ghostbur was a figment of Fundy's imagination. When Fundy told her he wasn't, she refused to believe him.[57][155]\n\nDuring the Doomsday War, Niki saw Ghostbur. Since she didn't know he existed, she thought she was hallucinating. This caused her to have a mental breakdown and flee the scene.[86]\n\nPositive\n\nHaving talked to each other directly before Doomsday, they had both agreed that L'Manberg and what it stood for changed and for the worse. They also agreed on refusing to take a side in the war. Niki stated HBomb was the only person she could truly trust, as the two have stuck by each other and been friends since HBomb joined the server. When HBomb left to start anew, he gave Niki all his possessions and allowed her to help him find a new home.[89] Niki visits him regularly.\n\nWhen HBomb was being chased by Foolish and Tubbo, Niki helped him hide from them and said that she doesn't believe that he was involved with the disappearance of the nukes.[156]\n\nNeutral/positive\n\nJack and Niki have always been respectful to each other. Following the events of Doomsday, Niki and Jack formed a tentative alliance with the goal of killing Tommy, who they both saw as a bully and threat to the server. The two have worked together for a while and generally got along okay. Although they didn't trust each other at first, they eventually came to consider each other friends. Even after parting ways ideologically following Tommy's revival, with Jack still seeking revenge and Niki embracing peace and forgiveness, they still maintain a fairly positive relationship.\n\nVery negative\n\nNiki massively disliked Schlatt's sweeping changes as President, especially the exile of Wilbur and Tommy. Her toleration of his administration deteriorated as time went on. She openly and strongly opposed the president multiple times in various decisions. Jschlatt found her frequent protests annoying and mocked her about her relationship with Wilbur and the complaints about his actions. He frequently made life hard for Niki by imprisoning her, raising her taxes multiple times, stealing things from her bakery, and threatening to kill her. He saw Niki as \"a thorn in my side.\" Niki burned down the Manberg flag and left to live in Tommy's holiday home after the taxes were too much for her. Tubbo's execution at the Manberg Festival led Niki to lash out at Schlatt. Schlatt decided to banish Niki and attempted to personally execute her, having heard enough from her. Niki would soon fight against Schlatt as a Pogtopian, getting the vengeance she wanted.\n\nNeutral/positive\n\nKarl and Niki have a warm relationship, as they went on a date together and have had several positive interactions.[46][157] Although Karl sold Rutabagville to Manberg and was on the opposite side in the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, they remained good friends.[45]\n\nNeutral\n\nPonk gifted Niki a grey cat named Zuko for Niki's birthday along with several enchantment books, diamonds, and emeralds. Niki was incredibly grateful for this.[141]\n\nPonk is the first person to rent out one of her rooms. Whilst there, she provides him with food and company. She also treated his arm, which Awesamdude chopped off, and manages to heal it. After Niki joined the syndicate, it is likely their relationship soured a bit due to the Eggpire's plan to conquer the SMP. This is further worsened when the Eggpire attempt to sacrifice all the guest to the Egg, but Niki doesn't seem to phased by Ponk leaving the city or trying to kill her so it is likely their relationship is neutral.\n\nNeutral/negative\n\nNiki and Punz ended up on the same side after Punz's betrayal in the Battle of the Lake. Following the battle, Punz gifted her a netherite helmet from the loot they got from the battle.[37] After Niki joined the Syndicate, it is likely their relationship soured a bit due to the Eggpire's plan to conquer the SMP and the events of the Red Banquet.\n\nPositive\n\nNiki has an almost motherly bond with Purpled, but they still hold mutual respect for each other. During the Red Banquet, Purpled rescued all the guests in the chamber and help them escape through the tunnel he dug.\n\nNeutral\n\nQuackity and Niki have acted pretty friendly to each other, even during The Manberg Rebellion when they were still on opposite sides of the war.\n\nHowever, in the Doomsday War, Quackity was horrified to see the L’Mantree burnt down by Niki. During the Red Banquet, Quackity saved all the guests in the chamber and fought against the Eggpire.\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki showed Ranboo around the SMP on his first day. She showed support for Ranboo's presidential campaign for L'Manberg, wondering if she could vote twice for Ranboo.[158] During the spat about the ownership over the shop she and Puffy were building, she and Ranboo were sending each other whispers trying to think of a way to stop the conflict. She also showed concern for him, asking if Fundy was holding him hostage.[159] During Tommy's trial, Niki protected Ranboo by lying that he wasn't involved in the burning of George's house and that Tommy was the sole perpetrator.[66]\n\nOn January 5, Ranboo was revealed as a traitor to L'Manberg.[160] Niki said that she was not on Tommy's side because he burned George's house, which caused all the drama, and added that exploding the community house was something he would do. Ranboo jumped in and said that the burning of George's house was not just Tommy's fault. She immediately refuted Ranboo by yelling at him for betraying L'Manberg. While he believed he didn't betray anyone, Niki disagreed.[161]\n\nSince then, Niki and Ranboo had a conversation and each apologized for yelling at each other. They talked things out, and Niki stated that she actually agreed with Ranboo’s ideals. She also mentioned that she \"always believed in Ranboo\" and would follow his lead.[81] However, instead of following his ideals, she burned down L'Mantree. He did not condone her actions and said that she still picked a side.[162]\n\nAfter the nuclear bomb launch, Niki and Ranboo had a talk where he confirmed that he doesn't know how to feel about Niki and stated that she is neutral to him.\n\nPositive\n\nAt first, Niki and Techno had a fairly positive relationship due to the both of them siding with Pogtopia. After he destroyed L'Manberg, Niki's opinion of him turned negative. However, she ended up doing Techno's job during the Doomsday War and burned down L'Mantree.\n\nAfter the destruction of L'Manberg and the formation of the Syndicate, Techno reached out to Niki and asked her if she wanted to join. At the time, Niki said that she had to think about it and shared with Techno that she was plotting to kill Tommy alongside Jack Manifold.[90] Following the plot's failure, Niki accepted the invitation to the Syndicate, explaining that she felt that the members of the Syndicate were welcoming and offered a place for her to belong.[102] Niki remained loyal to Techno and the members of the Syndicate. Despite having other feelings about Dream, Niki decided to help Techno in breaking Dream and Ranboo out of Pandora's Vault. During her confrontation with Jack after the prison break, Niki explained that she felt obligated to help Techno because he was her friend.[126]\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki and Tommy took Sapnap's fish and bargained with Dream for an apology before the formal start of The Pet War.[9] Many events later, she immediately asked Tommy if he wanted to get revenge and offered assistance after he found out about Henry's death. They were on the same side in the War of the Burning Eiffel Tower.[163] During the aftermath of the Manberg Festival, she created a sub faction with him and Tubbo, agreeing to stick together no matter what.[42]\n\nAt the Green Festival, Niki cried out in anger about Tommy's foolish actions, saying that she had no longer personal possessions due to Tommy's poor decisions. She blamed Tommy for constantly lying and eventually declared that he was no longer her friend.[74] Following the events of Doomsday, Niki spoke to Jack about the root of their problems, specifically naming Tommy. She and Jack then formed an alliance and plotted to kill Tommy to try and stop the pain.[87]\n\nTheir plans ultimately failed, causing Niki to lose interest and reconsider het attitude towards Tommy. On the day that Niki joined the Syndicate, Niki shared with her diary that she no longer wanted to kill Tommy. She explained that her hatred of Tommy was an attempt to stop the pain caused by Wilbur’s actions. She regret wanting to kill him and felt ashamed.[102]\n\nUpon finding out that Tommy is dead during the first Syndicate meeting, Niki denied the news, joking around with the rest of the Syndicate that Tommy can’t die.[106]\n\nWhen Jack later confronted her about Tommy's revival, she said that he had gone through several things and that he shouldn't have died. Niki rejected Jack's request to reform their alliance and got mad at her, calling her actions and anarchy dumb. Nonetheless, she ignored this and remained firm on her position on Tommy.[107]\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki and Tubbo have a sibling-like relationship often hang out with each other. She is also seen as a somewhat motherly figure to him. However, after the Green Festival, she is bothered by Tubbo immediately being on Tommy's side, though this doesn't bother her as much anymore. She also supported L'Manberg's destruction in the Doomsday War, presumably worsening their relationship. Though, it is unknown where their relationship is at, as they seldom interact.\n\nNeutral\n\nNiki and Wilbur were really good friends. Niki was always on the same side as him and was loyal to him in the early days of L'Manberg. It is likely that Niki thinks lesser of Wilbur since his betrayal to L'Manberg and previous members of Pogtopia (with the exception of Technoblade).\n\nThe more she thinks about it, the more she justifies her anger towards Wilbur for casting her opinions aside and exploding the home she always cared for. Despite always sticking up for her, Wilbur ended "
