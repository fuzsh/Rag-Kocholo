        "text": "Modern Magazine: Could you tell me about the original commission? What do you think was Norman’s intent and plan?\n\nMiles Jaffe: The original house was not intended as a full-time residence. Norman designed it as a prototype for a simple weekend getaway: two and a half bedrooms, two baths, with only two materials—wood and glass. The intent was to create a modern vacation house at a modest price point. This was in part a reaction to the rapidly growing demands of ever-wealthier clients.\n\nMM: When you were tapped to take on the renovation and addition, what was your thought process and approach in both restoring and expanding the house?\n\nMJ: The renovation transformed the existing 1,800-square-foot building into a one-bedroom house with living spaces sized to support a three-bedroom addition. Functions were updated to contemporary standards and the interior was completely refinished. I imagined the house as if my father were tuning it up, adding stone— the missing signature Jaffe element—and the fine detailing necessary for a full-custom project. Further enhancements included re-creating a few of Norman’s early furniture designs and the addition of a copper roof with a solar energy system.\n\nMM: What were some of the challenges of the project, and how did you resolve them?\n\nMJ: The most difficult design problem was how to add on. The challenge was not to upstage my father’s work but rather to enhance it. What would Norman do? Eventually I found the solution—a reflection of the same form positioned to complement the original. Within this envelope I riffed on the established themes to create a family wing that fulfilled the program requirements.\n\nHaving responsibility for both interior design and landscaping allowed me to do what Norman had only been able to achieve on a few select projects—create a comprehensive, harmonious design unmolested by competing professionals. This is the sweet spot in architecture. Even better, this project was a chance to work with my father again. It’s been a labor of love."
