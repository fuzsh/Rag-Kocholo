        "text": "A RIVER ran through them.\n\nClouds still linger on the craggy green cliffs overlooking the Hudson River. And if you stand on the wide Gothic revival verandas of houses that began a 19th-century design revolution here and squint past the subdivisions, it is possible to feel the kinship that Andrew Jackson Downing, Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers had with this place. But the story has largely slipped into history's mists.\n\n''This was the most ugly house you can imagine -- really nasty,'' Julian Hogan, a 48-year-old psychologist, said of the hilltop house she later learned was built in 1857 by a young architect named Vaux, who would meet Frederick Law Olmsted, a sometime farmer, on Newburgh's fertile ground and go on to design Central Park with him. ''But something about the light was amazing.''\n\nAfter buying it she removed an inch and a half of wire-lathed stucco -- and uncovered an extraordinary, forgotten legacy. ''I kept thinking, If people only knew.''\n\nSoon they will know. On June 6 and 7, this scrappy river city, home to one of the state's largest and most significant historic districts, will be the host of ''Taste Makers of an Era,'' a two-day symposium and house tour that will examine the lineage of four 19th-century apostles of taste -- Downing, Vaux, Withers and Olmsted -- and the city that nurtured them. Among the featured scholars at the event will be Francis R. Kowsky, whose new book ''Country, Park and City: The Architecture and Life of Calvert Vaux'' (Oxford University Press) has prompted a reappraisal of the more silent partner in Olmsted & Vaux (the one whose name rhymes with fox).\n\nDowning, Vaux's mentor and the son of a Newburgh wheelwright and nurseryman, became the leading taste maker of his generation, mostly through his writings. He drowned in the Hudson when fire broke out on a steamboat ferrying him to visit clients. It was 1852. He was 36. Vaux, the ''clever young architect'' Downing had plucked from obscurity in England and eventually made his partner, grimly identified the body. The coffin was laid out in the library of Highland Garden, Downing's house in Newburgh. ''A terrific storm burst over the river and crashed among the hills,'' an observer wrote, ''and the wild sympathy of nature surrounded that blasted home.''\n\nDowning had forged a naturalistic link between house and garden, a revolutionary idea that -- perhaps forever in America -- threw the corset of classical formality to the winds. Frederick Withers, another young English architect discovered and hired by Downing, would become a leading church designer and architect of wondrous Gothic revival buildings like the Jefferson Market Courthouse in Greenwich Village. The last collaboration between Vaux and Olmsted would be a park in Newburgh in Downing's memory.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
