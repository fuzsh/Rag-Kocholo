        "text": "D R Horton has a new community of quality mid-priced homes in the Market Common district, just off Farrow on Fred Nash Blvd. With twelve floorplans in 3, 4, and 5 bedroom homes, there is a model to please every buyer and most budgets. Plans are for 200-300 new homes, in ranch and two-story styles.\n\nThe homes will have most upgrades, including granite countertops, vaulted ceilings, landscaped lots, and covered porches. Some will have views of a community pond. Several models can be WIFI controlled from a smartphone - watch your doors, pets, and kids on a webcam, or control your garage, unlock doors, and set the thermostats with a flick of the thumb! Of course, the homes are energy efficient and built for convenience.\n\nThe amenities of Meridian are impressive! Residences will enjoy walking and nature trails, a large pool, clubhouse and amenity center, hot tub, fire pit, and a pickle-ball court. Convenience is key with close proximity to Hwy 17 Bypass, Myrtle Beach International Airport, Myrtle Grand Mall, and of course, all that Market Common offers! The beach is just a short drive away as well. Kids attend Myrtle Beach Primary, Intermediate, and Myrtle Beach High School.\n\nAs with most all the Market Common communities, Meridian will be popular. Get in early to choose the home you want and the colors and upgrades you need. Let us represent you as your buyer's agent with the developers. We can negotiate and often get you extra perks and better pricing. Call us for more information on the homes for sale in Meridian at Market Common.\n\nNew Homes in Meridian"
