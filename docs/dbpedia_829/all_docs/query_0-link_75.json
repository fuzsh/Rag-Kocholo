        "text": "“This is a special Australian terrace – one of the six grand old terraces of Paddington,” says homeowner Penny. “It is in an amazing location, with a 6.5-metre frontage in a densely populated part of Sydney.” A recycled clay chandelier made to order from The Design Hunter, reigns over the Dritto dining table from Boffi Studio with Arne Jacobsen ‘Series 7’ chairs from Cult. Antlers are from 1803 Artisan Deer Design.\n\n“One of the highlights of the renovation occurred when rendering the downstairs walls. We saw light flooding onto the render and quickly decided not to paint over it,” says Penny. The generous hallway entrance of ‘Mimosa’ features a recycled timber mirror inherited from the first house the Hanans restored in this area of Paddington, and a chandelier that came with the house and was restored by Edwards Chandelierium. The two paintings are by Peter Boggs.\n\nPenny says renovating an old house “really gets your blood running … The melding of the old and the new is very emotional.” At the right of the mantel is a work by Graeme Drendel. The Great Disruption by James King from Becker Minty sits on the fireplace mantel next to a West African carved head from Macleay on Manning and a Kelly Wearstler sculpture from Becker Minty. Floors from Salvage were milled and hand-finished in Belgium.\n\nPenny was raised in Orange on the Central Western slopes of NSW, where her family has had a deer farm for more than 30 years. This rural aesthetic adds finishing touches to the interiors. Underwood by Felix Forest sits on the sitting-room mantel with an Indonesian fossilised wood sculpture on a metal base, both from Becker Minty. Votive from Elements I Love. Tinker stool from MCM House. Hair-on hide cushions from 1803 Artisan Deer Design. Lektor floor lamp by Niclas Hoflin from Fred.\n\nThis is the third house the couple have renovated in 10 years, all within the same area of Sydney’s Paddington. Will they embark on more renovation collaborations in the future? “Oh no,” Penny says, “After three renovations in the past 10 years we are hanging up our hard-hats for a while to enjoy the results – but there may be one left in us should we move back to Orange.” The kitchen and stools are from Boffi Studio. The Domain After a Storm by Robert Malherbe sits above the bench and next to a bronze champagne bucket from Zuster. Knitted neoprene bowl from Macleay on Manning .\n\nPenny launched 1803 Artisan Deer Design, which uses by-products of the family enterprise farming venison to craft stunning homewares and accessories, including bone-handled knives, antlers, throws and bags. Penny has a studio at the rear of the property and her elegant designs are evident throughout her home. In the guest room, Black and Blue II and III, both by Angus McDonald from Olsen Irwin, hang above a glass lamp by Blainey North from Becker Minty. Jade stool from Zuster. Pearl Necklace cushion from Becker Minty. Suede throw in Storm from 1803 Artisan Deer Design.\n\n“Edwina Withers is a friend, who – by happy coincidence – works for Boffi Studio, a brand with an aesthetic I love. Together we installed a Boffi Studio powder room,” says Penny.\n\nPowder room vanity, basin and light all from Boffi Studio. Reclining Nude by Robert Malherbe. Leather basket from Zuster.\n\nAnnie Wilkes of Annie Wilkes Design was instrumental in the renovation. “She created a wonderful courtyard garden of river birch, which now has its own ecosystem and is an amazing feature,” says Penny. On an Eagle’s Wings by Sophie Cape rests behind a sofa and coffee table from The Country Trader Contemporary Collection. Water feature from Annie Wilkes Design in the foreground. The atrium solution for the rear of the house was designed by Marsh Cashman Koolloos and built by F&D Normoyle Engineering.\n\nSign up for our newsletter\n\nSign up to the latest news from Belle, delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nDisclaimer: By joining, you agree to our Privacy Policy & Terms of Use"
