Name: Wendy Withers + Gavin Lester, their two sons Boots + Oscar, two dogs Olive + Bear

Location: Mar Vista — Los Angeles, CA

Size: 1,100 square feet

Years lived in: 3 years — own

Wendy and Gavin share this incredible and cozy cottage with their two boys and two dogs. They have built a joyous home full of artwork and inspiration, designed with traditional and eclectic elements; an adorable family home.

Raising a baby and toddler can keep you on your toes. It also means you need space for comfort and family time. Wendy believes that the most important element in designing a home is “creating a comfortable living space that reflects who you are.”

When you first approach the home, you are overwhelmed with the lovely garden and luscious yard. There are benches and a tire swing, a play house for the kids and an incredible deck that overlooks the yard. Wendy says, “Because we have such great weather we spend a lot of time outside. It was important to design a space where we could flow in and out with ease and it was also important to create an outdoor living and play space with a sustainable design.”

One of my favorite aspects of the home are the personal art pieces by Gavin. He has created some incredible work that is spread out around the home; the Yours Sincerely typography sign in the master bedroom, the neon sign above the front door, the larger than life receipt in the boys room.

Apartment Therapy Survey:

Our Style: Eclectic

Inspiration: Life before and after kids, our collections, flea markets, art, travel and our talented friends and colleagues who have inspired us along the way.

Favorite Element: Pretty much everything

Biggest Challenge: lack of S P A C E

What Friends Say: “Ooooh, charming”

Biggest Embarrassment: Our couch that has been trashed by out kids

Proudest DIY: Gavin’s artwork

Biggest Indulgence: Our garden

Best Advice: : Research, references and a solid plan. We have learned, from one or two projects, that any kind of home improvement must be done with 100% certainty regarding design and execution. Of course, there will always be the unforeseeable, but enlisting the help of those you trust implicitly, makes the process much more pleasant. Also, always follow your instincts. If a project doesn’t look or feel right then it’s probably not.

Dream Sources: ABC Carpet and Home and Parisian flea markets.
