We will then notify you when a spot becomes available.\n\nThe 5th of May marks a significant date for our past and present Dutch society. Every year on Liberation Day, we celebrate our valuable, not self-evident, freedom. On this special day, Humanity in Action is pleased to announce the Dutch premiere of ‘My Father’s War’.\n\nMy Father’s War animates the experiences of Peter Hein and his son David. As a Jewish toddler in the Netherlands in the 1940s, Peter was separated from his parents and whisked from hiding place to hiding place to escape deportation. Peter and his parents somehow survived, one day at a time, even as capture and death surrounded them. Narrated by both Peter and David, the film depicts an intergenerational conversation, reverberating across the decades.\n\nMy Father’s War is the third part of Humanity in Action’s animated documentary trilogy Traces: Portraits of Resistance, Survival and Resolve.\n\nThe premiere of My Father’s War will take place on May 5, 2022 from 19:00 until 20:30 at LAB111 in Amsterdam. The movie is in English with Dutch subtitles and the talk afterwards will be in English. This event is part of the Theater Na de Dam program.\n\n>> Reserve your seat here\n\nDonation\n\nThis is a donation-based event. We greatly welcome your support.

The program is moderated by Raissa Biekman.\n\nModerator\n\nRaissa Biekman is a policy officer for the D66 parliamentary fraction in the House of Representatives of the States General.

Since then he has been a guest speaker, writer and sculptor. As a Jewish child he was hidden in the Netherlands during World War II, as were his parents. He wrote the books The sixth year about his own hiding and the first year after the liberation and The hiding, on the dramatic hiding of his parents.\n\nDavid Hein is the Head of the Defense Office of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers (KSC), an international court in The Hague tasked with adjudicating cases concerning international crimes committed in Kosovo before, during and after the war there.
