        "text": "1:26p ET Wednesday, April 22, 2015\n\nDear Friend of GATA and Gold:\n\n\"Regulating the gold price in the free market\" was recommended to central banks by the president of the Bank for International Settlements,\" Jelle Zijlstra, in a speech at International Monetary Fund headquarters in Washington in September 1981.\n\nThe speech, located this week by gold researcher and GATA consultant Ronan Manly, was given as a lecture memorializing the former managing director of the IMF, Per Jacobsson.\n\n... Dispatch continues below ...\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDirect Ownership and Storage of Precious Metals\n\nOutside the Banking System in Zurich and Singapore\n\nGoldbroker.com is a precious metals investment company that enables investors to own and store gold directly in their own name (no mutualized ownership) in Zurich and Singapore.\n\nGoldbroker's clients are not exposed to any counterparty risks. They own gold and silver in their own names (the ownership certificate cites the name of the investor and serial number of his bars) and they have storage accounts opened in their own name as well. So Goldbroker.com's storage partner knows the exact identity of each investor. Goldbroker.com doesn't store in the name of its clients; rather, Goldbroker's clients store personally. All investors have direct access to their gold and silver bars.\n\nGoldbroker.com was launched in 2011 so that investors would avoid any counterparty risk when investing in physical gold and silver.\n\nGoldbroker.com is listed among GATA's recommended monetary metals dealers.

It is my conviction that relatively small-scale interventions, though not forestalling the subsequent explosion in the gold price, would at least have reduced it to more manageable proportions. Now that the turbulent emotions seem to have quieted down, we would be wise to reflect anew and without prejudice on these subjects.\"\n\nWestern central banks seem to have heeded Zijlstra's advice, as the BIS now functions largely as their gold broker, buying and selling not only gold but gold futures, options, and other derivatives on their behalf nearly every day for purposes never revealed to the public --\n\nhttp://www.gata.org/node/12717\n\n-- but explained among themselves as \"interventions\" designed \"to influence asset prices (especially gold and foreign exchange) in circumstances where this might be thought useful\":\n\nhttp://www.gata.org/node/11012\n\nhttp://www.gata.org/node/4279\n\nZijlstra's speech is also notable for its candid wish that central bankers should be allowed to run the world without the interference of mere elected officials. Having served in the Netherlands parliament and even five months as the country's prime minister before heading its central bank and the BIS, Zijlstra surely found central banking a lot easier than democracy.\n\nHis speech to the IMF is posted at the Internet site of the Per Jacobsson Foundation here --\n\nhttp://www.perjacobsson.org/lectures/1981.pdf\n\n-- and at GATA's Internet site here:\n\nhttp://www.gata.org/files/JelleZijlstra-PerJacobssonLecture-1981.pdf\n\nCHRIS POWELL, Secretary/Treasurer\n\nGold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc.\n\n* * *\n\nSupport GATA by purchasing recordings of the proceedings of the 2014 New Orleans Investment Conference:\n\nhttps://jeffersoncompanies.com/landing/2014-av-powell\n\nOr by purchasing DVDs of GATA's London conference in August 2011 or GATA's Dawson City conference in August 2006:\n\nhttp://www.goldrush21.com/order.html\n\nOr by purchasing a colorful GATA T-shirt:\n\nhttp://gata.org/tshirts\n\nOr a colorful poster of GATA's full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal on January 31, 2009:\n\nhttp://gata.org/node/wallstreetjournal\n\nHelp keep GATA going\n\nGATA is a civil rights and educational organization based in the United States and tax-exempt under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
