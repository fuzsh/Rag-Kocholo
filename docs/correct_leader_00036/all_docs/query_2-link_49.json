Witteveen's tax based business cycle policy, known as the wiebeltax and Zijlstra's budget norm, known as the Zijlstra-norm are reflections of their very different perception of economic theory. The differences between Zijlstra and Witteveen on budgetary policy were the differences between Keynesians on the one hand and the ordo-liberals and monetarists on the other. Zijlstra’s economics were also firmly grounded in the specific Dutch monetary tradition. In democracies there is a tension between scientific knowledge on the one hand and political intuition and normative judgments on the other. Witteveen was convinced that science-based policy formulation combined with the use of empirical models could improve democratic decision-making. Zijlstra emphasized a strict separation between academic insights and policy. He used science mainly strategically and as a communication tool. Zijlstra was less optimistic about the potential of empirical models for economic policy. He did not want to leave normative decision making to non-democratic policy institutions or economic models.The story of Witteveen and Zijlstra is still of great importance today.
