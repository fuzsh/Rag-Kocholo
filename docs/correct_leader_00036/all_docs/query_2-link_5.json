In another life he used to be a theatre director and actor, which he sometimes still does for fun. His Jewish and queer identities are deeply intertwined with his work as both an activist and an artist.\n\nListen in to our latest incredible journey into the LGBTQ communities’ vulnerable and often hilarious stories of coming out."
