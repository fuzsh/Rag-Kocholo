        "text": "Delft Design Guide provides an overview of the perspectives, models, approaches, and methods used in the bachelor's and master's curriculum of Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). Some of these are unique to the university, others are well known and are used by designers worldwide. Designing products and services at this faculty is considered a systematic and structured activity, deliberately and purposefully, and with moments of increased creativity.\n\nThe methods and techniques are each described in a practical one-page text, illustrated for further clarification and enriched with images that should encourage reflection and further reading.\n\nDesign students can use the book as a reference guide in their design projects and in managing their personal development. Design teachers can use the book as a reference guide to assist students in learning a method. Design professionals can use the book as a reference guide to support their design processes.\n\nIf you would like to buy in bulk, you can enjoy a special discount on orders over 10 copies. Starting from 15% off, the more you order, the bigger the discount.\n\nAuthors\n\nAnnemiek van Boeijen is Assistant Professor in Design, Culture & Society at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at TU Delft, where she obtained her master degree and PhD. Her research focuses on the role of culture in design processes.\n\nJaap Daalhuizen is Associate Professor in Design Methodology at the Technical University of Denmark. He obtained his master degree in Integrated Product Design as well as his PhD at TU Delft.\n\nJelle Zijlstra is industrial designer and head of the Motion department at the Design Academy Eindhoven; he teaches design at IPO Rotterdam and design didactics at TU Delft."
