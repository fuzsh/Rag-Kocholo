        "text": "How many new mammals are discovered every year? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.\n\nAnswer by Jelle Zijlstra, zoologist, on Quora:\n\nHow many new mammals are discovered every year?\n\nIn recent years, about 40–50 per year.\n\nThis chart is generated from my database and shows the number of new living mammal species described by year. By my count, there are currently 6602 recognized species. A couple of interesting features:\n\nA huge peak at the very beginning (1758), which is the beginning point of modern nomenclature. All of these 162 species were named in the 10th edition of Linnaeus’sSystema Naturae. (There were actually more species, but not all are now considered valid.)\n\nEverything is generally pretty spiky early on, because in some years important works were published that named a lot of new species, and in others nothing much was published.\n\nThe 1840s peak is likely mostly the work of John Edward Gray at the British Museum, who named lots of new species.\n\nThe extended peak around 1900 is the result of focused biological exploration all around the world. Biologists like Oldfield Thomas in London, C.H. Merriam in Washington, and Paul Matschie in Berlin named hundreds of new species, many of which are still considered valid.\n\nSince about the 1990s, the number of new species has increased again. This is the result of a couple of factors, including increased interest in taxonomy, changes in species concepts that favored the recognition of more species, and DNA and other molecular data that showed previously unrecognized diversity. The most productive recent year was 2014 with 57 new species.\n\nFor extinct species, the pattern is different (and the numbers usually higher).\n\nVery few extinct species were named in the early history of biological nomenclature—paleontology only really took off in the mid-19th century. You can clearly see the effects of World War I and II. The most productive year is 1987, with 285 new species, and recent years have yielded about 150 new species.\n\nBoth of these charts are derived from my personal database of mammal names. Because taxonomy is never fully settled and these are counts of species I currently consider valid, the exact counts may be different for a different dataset. This is especially true for the extinct species chart in this answer, because the classification of living species is much better established.\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.
