Tilting angles of between 30 and 40 degrees are usually considered as optimal, in particular in Northern Europe countries.\n\nsolutions for cleaning rows of solar panels comprise a moving cleaning device suitable for moving along the direction of the row and guided by two rails situated on top and at the bottom of the solar panels and running all along the length of the row of solar panels.\n\nthe cleaning device can move along a rail normal to the two guiding rails, to clean the whole surface of the panels, or the cleaning device spans over the whole height of the solar panel and moves only in one direction parallel to the guiding rails. Examples of such systems can be found e.g., in JP2002/273351, KR2009/0058624, CN201111305, KR2009/0090722, WO2009/146753.\n\nUS2010/0206294 discloses a mobile cleaning device comprising a frame provided with cleaning means and mounted on wheels, forming a cart suitable for being displaced on the ground on which the tilted solar panels are installed. By pushing the cart along a row of aligned solar panels, the whole surface of a row can be cleaned.\n\nThis versatile system has the drawback that it requires that the solar panels be installed on a ground free of obstacles to the course of the cart, such as cables, tubes, steps, gaps, shingles, and the like.\n\nUS2006/0096050 discloses such a washing robot for cleaning steeply inclined surfaces, such as vertical building surfaces comprising two modules: (a) a housing comprising a liquid application cleaning system connected via a cable to (b) a support component that supports and elevates the washing system.\n\nthe support system is able to move along the upper edge of a building to displace the washing system horizontally and can displace it vertically by actuating a pulley about which runs the cable connecting the two components.\n\nSuch system is, however, designed to clean large surfaces and is ill fitted for cleaning a series of adjacent solar panels aligned in a row.\n\nthe present invention concerns a mobile cleaning device suitable for displacing along, and cleaning a series of adjacent tilted solar panels aligned in a row and requiring therefor no superstructure fixed to said row of solar panels, said device comprising:\n\nthe cleaning means preferably comprise at least one rotating brush or cloth suitable for cleaning a surface parallel to the cleaning plane, and extending preferably over the whole length of the frame such as to span over the whole height of a solar panel.\n\na squeegee can also be provided.\n\nthe rotating brushes can be mounted such as to rotate about an axis normal to the cleaning plane. In an alternative embodiment, the brushes are mounted such as to rotate about an axis parallel to the cleaning plane, and transverseâpreferably normalâto the line formed by the at least two guiding wheels.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention preferably comprises sprinkling means for sprinkling a liquid onto the surface of a solar panel which is parallel to the cleaning plane.\n\nthe sprinkling means are preferably disposed in two rows of sprinklers running transverse to the line formed by the guiding wheels ( 3 A), and on either sides of the washing means.\n\na tank containing a cleaning medium selected from soap, a detergent, an anticalcar agent, or a solvent such as alcohol, to be mixed with the liquid prior to spraying onto the surface of to be cleaned can also be provided on said frame.\n\nthe sprinkling means can be connected to a source of pressurized liquid, such as water, if available close by, or the device may comprise a mobile source of pressurized liquid, as well as of power, which may be mounted on a lorry.\n\na source of pressurized liquid such as water\n\nthe device may comprise a mobile source of pressurized liquid, as well as of power, which may be mounted on a lorry.\n\nthe rotation of the cleaning brush or cloth is driven by a hydraulic motor fed by the same source of pressurized water as the sprinklers.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention preferably comprises at least one support wheel mounted on the same side of the supporting frame as the cleaning means and suitable for rotating about an axis parallel to the cleaning plane and normal to the line formed by the guiding wheels, such as to allow the displacement of the cleaning device along a row of solar panels with the cleaning means in constant cleaning contact with the surface thereof.\n\nthe displacement of the cleaning device along a row of solar panels is preferably driven by motorized guiding wheels and/or motorized support wheels.\n\nthe motorization of the device displacement can be driven by a hydraulic motorâe.g., the same as used for rotating the brushes or clothesâor by an electric motor fed by a source of power, such as a battery, a generator, or the net.\n\na source of power such as a battery, a generator, or the net.\n\nthe cleaning device can be displaced manually by pushing or pulling it along a row of solar panels.\n\nthe distance of the guiding wheels from the frame can be varied easily.\n\nthe upper edge of a row of adjacent solar panels is not continuously smooth and may comprise either features jutting out of the line of the row, such as fastening elements and the like, e.g., bolts, or a gap between two panels.\n\nthe guiding means may comprise at least three guiding wheels, each mounted on resilient means, such as a helicoidal spring, suitable for reversibly disrupting the alignment of the at least three guiding wheels upon hitting an obstacle such as a jutting feature or a gap.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention is meant to clean the whole exposed surface of the solar panels it can additionally be used for scanning and monitoring said surface. For instance, by mounting an infrared camera on the support structure, temperature gradients on the surface of the solar panels can be identified and located, indicative of a malfunctioning of a cell in case, e.g., of a hot spot.\n\nthe cleaning device may further comprise at least one handle for holding and handling the device, and/or at least one transportation wheel assisting to the transportation of the device in the way of a wheel barrow.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention further comprises a CPU for controlling one or more of:\n\nthe present invention also concerns a method for cleaning tilted solar panels arranged on at least one row and requiring no superstructure fixed to the row of solar panels, comprising the following steps:\n\nthe cleaning method preferably further comprises:\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention is particularly suitable for cleaning solar panels aligned in a row and tilted with respect to the horizontal by an angle â comprised between 5 and 85 deg with respect to the horizontal, preferably by an angle between 10 and 60 deg, more preferably by an angle between 20 and 50 deg.\n\nFIG. 1 shows a perspective view of a first embodiment of cleaning device according to the present invention, in cleaning position on a tilted solar panel,\n\nFIG. 2 shows a side view of the length of the cleaning device of FIG. 1 resting on a tilted solar panel.\n\nFIG. 3 shows a perspective view of the cleaning device of FIG. 1 .\n\nFIG. 4 shows a top view of the cleaning device of FIG. 1 .\n\nFIG. 5 shows a side view of the cleaning device of FIG. 1 showing the guiding means.\n\nFIG. 6 shows a side view of the cleaning device of FIG. 1 showing the holding means.\n\nFIG. 7 shows a perspective view of a series of rows of aligned solar panels, with the cleaning device of FIG. 1 in cleaning and displacement position on one row.\n\nFIG. 8 shows a perspective view of a second embodiment of cleaning device according to the present invention, in cleaning position on a tilted solar panel.\n\nFIG. 9 shows a top view of the cleaning device of FIG. 8 .\n\nFIG. 10 shows a side view of the cleaning device of FIG. 8 showing the guiding means.\n\nFIG. 11 shows a side view of the cleaning device of FIG. 8 in cleaning position on a row of solar panels.\n\nthe present invention concerns a mobile cleaning device particularly suitable for cleaning adjacent solar panels ( 20 ) disposed in rows of any length, even if the panels are not perfectly aligned, and requiring no permanent equipment in place nor any particular superstructure, like guiding rails, fixed water supply, fixed power supply, and the like.\n\nthe cleaning device ( 1 ) of the present invention comprises:\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention is characterized in that the guiding means ( 3 ) comprise,\n\neach guiding wheel ( 3 A) being mounted such as to rotate about an axis substantially normal to the cleaning plane ( 2 A) and suitable for resting and rolling on the upper edge of the aligned solar panels ( 20 ) with the cleaning means ( 4 ) in cleaning contact with the surface to be cleaned.\n\nthe term âwheelâ is meant to encompass any rotating device allowing the transformation of a rotating movement into a linear movement, such as a rotating wheel, roller, gear, pin, and the like.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention actually hangs on the upper edge of the solar panels, with the guiding wheels ( 3 A) resting on said upper edge. This is possible even at low tilting angles of the solar panels with respect to the horizontal of the order of 5 to 10 degrees, and at high tilting angles of the order of 70 to 85 degrees, but is most secure of course with intermediate tilting angles of the order of 20 to 60 degrees, preferably of 25 to 50 degrees, more preferably of 30-38 degrees.\n\nthe unique design of the present cleaning device with the guiding wheels ( 3 A) allowing to profit of the upper edge of the solar panels to smoothly displace the cleaning device along a row of solar panels is greatly advantageous as it permits to make without a superstructure permanently fixed to the solar panel rows, such as guiding rails or support bars, as often used in automatic cleaning devices in the art, and which cost is quite high. It also allows the smooth displacement of the cleaning device regardless of the topography of the ground on which the rows of panels are located, such as steps, shingles, cables, pipes, stones, and the like.\n\nthe guiding means ( 3 ) comprise at least three guiding wheels ( 3 )\n\nThis system accounts for small defects in the alignment of the solar panels, which may often occur when the panels are disposed on an area not specifically designed for the purpose, such as a flat roof of a building, loaded with conduits, cables, and the like.\n\nthe guiding wheels ( 3 A) may each advantageously be mounted on resilient means, such as a helicoidal spring, suitable for reversibly disrupting the alignment of the at least three guiding wheels upon hitting an obstacle such as a bolt jutting out of the top edge of the solar panel row.\n\nthe outer edge of the at least three wheels ( 3 A) is profiled to match the geometry of the upper edge of a solar panel. This reduces any risk of slippage of the device off a panel.\n\nthe guiding wheels ( 3 A) are motorized, they may be connected to one another by a flexible sling to form a caterpillar. Such caterpillar allows the device to account for greater defects in the alignment of the solar panels in a row.\n\nthe caterpillar is preferably profiled such as to reduce any risk of slippage off a panel.\n\nthe cleaning means ( 4 ) may comprise any means known in the art for cleaning a flat glass surface. They may include a tank mounted on the frame and containing a cleaning medium such as soap, a detergent, an anticalcar agent, a solvent such as alcohol.\n\nthe cleaning means may comprise blasting means of a particulate matter suitable for cleaning the surface of a solar panel, but it preferably comprises brushes, clothes, and the like, more preferably rotating brushes and/or clothes suitable for sweeping the surface of the solar panels at high velocity as illustrated in the Figures.\n\nthe brushes or clothes can be mounted to rotate about an axis normal to the cleaning plane ( 2 A) as illustrated in the embodiment represented in FIGS. 1 to 7 .\n\nthe brushes can be mounted such as to rotate about an axis parallel to the cleaning surface ( 2 A) and transverse, preferably normal, to the straight line formed by the guiding wheels ( 3 A) as illustrated in the embodiment of FIGS. 8 to 11 .\n\nthe latter embodiment is advantageous because less brushes are needed since one brush can span the whole height of a solar panel.\n\ndriving wheels which can be the guiding wheels ( 3 A) or the support wheels ( 9 A) coupled to a motor.\n\nthe rotation of the brushes or clothes, and optionally of the driving wheels is preferably driven by a hydraulic motor fed by a source of pressurized water, which can also be used for feeding sprinklers, if any.\n\nThis embodiment is highly advantageous, as the cleaning device can thus function without a source of power, which is paradoxically not always readily available close to solar panels.\n\na hydraulic motor is also considerably cheaper and lighter than an electrical motor, which facilitates the displacement of the cleaning device.\n\nthe brushes or clothes may work in dry conditions to remove principally dust from the surface of the panels, but it is preferred to work in wet conditions. In the latter case, a squeegee in replacement of, or in addition to the brushes and/or clothes, may help to remove the cleaning liquid.\n\nWorking in wet conditions can be done by providing the cleaning device with sprinkling means ( 8 ), oriented to spray a liquid onto the surface of the panels.\n\nthe cleaning device ( 1 ) of the present invention should ideally work equally well when running along a row of solar panels from left to right, as from right to left, it should preferably comprise brushes and/or clothes disposed in the middle section of the structure spanning the whole length of the structure ( 2 ), which should optimally cover the whole height of a panel, with sprinkling means ( 8 ) and squeegees disposed on either sides of the brushes.\n\nsprinkling means ( 8 ) and squeegees disposed on either sides of the brushes.\n\nAt least one handle ( 6 ) may be fixed to the frame ( 2 ) for holding and handling the device ( 1 ). It is preferably fixed to the upper side of the supporting frame ( 2 ) corresponding to the side where the guiding means ( 3 ) are located, but extending in the opposite direction with respect to the cleaning plane ( 2 A).\n\nAt least one transportation wheel ( 10 A) to help transporting the cleaning device from one row of solar panels to the next.\n\na single transportation wheel ( 10 A) as illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 11 can be used as a wheel barrow to easily move around the device by a single person.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention may comprise at least one support wheel ( 9 a ), preferably at least two support wheels ( 9 A), more preferably at least three non aligned support wheels ( 9 A) mounted on the same side of the supporting frame ( 2 ) as the cleaning means ( 4 ) and each support wheel ( 9 A) being suitable for rotating about an axis parallel to the cleaning plane ( 2 A) and normal to the line formed by the driving wheels ( 3 A) to support the frame at a given distance from a solar panel it rests upon, such that the cleaning means ( 4 ) are in cleaning contact with the surface thereof.\n\nthe orientation of the support wheels ( 9 A) is such that they follow the lateral displacement of the cleaning device along a row of solar panels.\n\nUsing support wheels ( 9 A) has the advantage of keeping the cleaning means ( 4 ) in optimal cleaning contact with the surface of the solar panels, and of avoiding any scratching of the surface.\n\nAt least three non aligned support wheels ( 9 A) ensure the stability of the supporting frame ( 2 ), but it is clear that more support wheels ( 9 A) can also be used as illustrated in the Figures, provided they are well aligned on a plane.\n\nthe outer edge of the support wheels preferably comprises a soft material, such as a rubber or a polyolefin (e.g., PE, PP), POM, PTFE and the like, to preserve the integrity of the surface of the solar panels.\n\nthe axis of rotation of the support wheels ( 9 A) may be fixed with an orientation normal to the line defined by guiding wheels ( 3 A), or may be allowed to freely rotate around an axis normal to the cleaning plane. In case the support wheels ( 9 A) are idle, the latter solution is preferred, but in case the support wheels ( 9 A) are motorized, it is preferred to keep their orientation fixed, to prevent any inadvertent jump of the device off course.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention with means for easily varying the distance of the guiding wheels ( 3 A) from the frame ( 2 ). Indeed, when the supporting frame ( 2 ) is maintained at an optimal constant distance from the surface of a solar panel by the support wheels ( 9 A), the guiding wheels ( 3 A) must fit exactly to match the top edge of the solar panel frame.\n\nthe design of the frame may vary substantially in thickness, in depth, it could be in recess or, on the contrary, overhanging over the surface of the solar panel to protect it from direct dripping, and so on.\n\neach guiding wheel ( 3 A) is preferably mounted at one end of a rod extending normal to the cleaning plane ( 2 A) and mounted such as to allow the variation of the distance of said rod end from the cleaning plane ( 2 A).\n\na threaded rod engaging in a matching threaded orifice can be used.\n\na smooth rod is engaged in an orifice provided with means for alternatively holding tight the rod into position or letting it run loosely.\n\nAny other means known in the art for varying the distance of a wheel from a support structure can be implemented in the device of the present invention, such as pins or a gear.\n\nthe displacement of the cleaning device ( 1 ) of the present invention may be driven by hand.\n\nthe operator either pushes or pulls the cleaning device along a row of solar panels until it reaches the end thereof, at which point it carries the cleaning device to the next row to be cleaned.\n\nAn embodiment of cleaning device to be displaced manually is illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 11 , wherein all the guiding and hiding wheels ( 3 A, 9 A) are idle.\n\na cleaning device as illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 11 can be as light as 25 to 40 kg, even between 30 and 35 kg, which is easily manageable by a single operator.\n\nthe displacement of the cleaning device may be driven by a motor, preferably but not necessarily, the same motor that drives the rotation of the cleaning means ( 4 ).\n\nThis motor may be an electric motor, but it is preferably a hydraulic motor fed by a source of pressurized water, preferably used also for feeding sprinklers.\n\nthe motor may be coupled to at least one support wheel ( 9 A) or to at least one guiding wheel ( 3 A), to drive the displacement of the device, which allows the cleaning to be performed automatically.\n\nthe embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 7 comprises six motorized support wheels ( 9 A) and three idle wheels ( 3 A). As discussed above, in case the guiding wheels ( 3 A) are motorized, it may be advantageous to connect them with a caterpillar.\n\nthe velocity of the driving means can be controlled independently from the rotational velocity of the cleaning means ( 4 ). This can be done by driving them by two separate motors, which is easy to control, but also more expensive and heavier to handle. Alternatively, a single motor may be used to drive both the cleaning means ( 4 ) and the driving means ( 9 ) with a gear box allowing separate control of their respective velocities.\n\nthe guiding means ( 3 ) comprise at least three guiding wheels ( 3 A) so that at least two of the at least three guiding wheels ( 3 A) are always in contact with the upper edge of the solar panels even when passing over a gap between one panel and the neighbouring panel.\n\na device of the present invention comprising at least three guiding wheels ( 3 A) preferably comprises safety means controlled by a CPU mounted on the frame of the cleaning device and programmed to trigger the stopping of the motor driving the motion of the cleaning device ( 1 ) in case two of the at least three guiding wheels ( 3 A) are unloaded.\n\ntwo of the at least three guiding wheels ( 3 ) are permanently in contact with the edge of one or two solar panels, and support the whole weight of the cleaning device resting on the tilted surface of a solar panel.\n\nthe cleaning device may end up holding to the upper edge of a solar panel by a single guiding wheel ( 3 A), the other two being unloaded in contact with no solid structure.\n\nthe safety feature would immediately stop the motion of the cleaning device to prevent it from falling to the ground.\n\nthe safety device may be programmed for stopping the motor when a given number of guiding wheels are unloaded.\n\nthe safety feature may also be programmed to activate the driving motor in a reverse direction to attempt to re-establish the contact of the last unloaded wheel with the upper edge of a solar panel.\n\nthe CPU can also be programmed to control other features such as.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention is meant to clean the whole exposed surface of the solar panels it can additionally be used for scanning and monitoring said surface.\n\nAn infrared camera could for instance be used to identify hot spots indicative a malfunctioning solar cell.\n\nOther monitoring instruments can be mounted to measure different parameters, such as electromagnetic fields, rugosity, and the like.\n\nthe cleaning device of the present invention can advantageously be used in a method for cleaning tilted solar panels arranged on at least one row, comprising the following steps:\n\ncleaning of the solar panels in wet conditions may be achieved by providing the cleaning device with sprinkling means ( 8 ) for sprinkling a liquid, such as soaped water and/or clear water, onto a surface parallel to the cleaning surface, said sprinkling means ( 8 ) being preferably disposed in two rows of sprinklers running parallel to the length of the device, and on either sides of the washing means ( 4 ), so as to allow the use of the cleaning device in both directions of motion along a row of solar panels.\n\nsprinkling means ( 8 ) for sprinkling a liquid, such as soaped water and/or clear water, onto a surface parallel to the cleaning surface, said sprinkling means ( 8 ) being preferably disposed in two rows of sprinklers running parallel to the length of the device, and on either sides of the washing means ( 4 ), so as to allow the use of the cleaning device in both directions of motion along a row of solar panels.\n\nsprinkling means ( 8 ) for sp\n\na source of power is not always readily available in the vicinity of the solar panels to power the cleaning device.\n\na source of pressurized liquid is not always available for wet cleaning applications.\n\nthe mobile sources of power and pressurized liquid may be loaded on a lorry and connected to the cleaning device by a cable for the power and by hoses for the liquid.\n\nthe cables and hoses may be of considerable length in cases such as when solar panels are arranged on top of a building of considerable height, or when they are arranged in rows of considerable length.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nChemical & Material Sciences
