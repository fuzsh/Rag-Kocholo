        "text": "Dr. Jelle Zijlstra was the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, President of the Central Bank of the Netherlands, and President of the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland, with long-standing engagement with the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in The Netherlands. In honour of this renowned economist, we recognize international leaders whose work champions economic national growth, generational-shifting innovation, global collaboration, or charitable commitments which dramatically improve the quality of life for society.\n\nOver the past two years, bilateral economic relations between Switzerland and Russia have been developing in a positive light. For example, Swiss export volume growth reached double digits in both since 2017. Switzerland currently exports about $2.5 billion to Russia, which amounts to about 80 percent of export volumes prior to the 2013 crisis. We can see this recovery also with regard to the SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), which have recently been entering the Russian market more actively. Similarly, investments from Swiss companies in Russia have seen an upturn as well. Investments grew by 10 percent over the past two years, and Switzerland is currently in the top-10 countries in Russia in terms of in terms of total direct investment. Recently, Swiss Business Hub Russia has been formed as an official branch of the Swiss embassy. Therefore, Russia's economy is important for Swiss business.\n\nThe Russian economy has gone through two distinct periods. From 1999-2008, Russia boomed with an average growth of 7 percent per year. Since 2009, Russia's economy on average grew 1 percent per year. The pandemic and the oil price war are serious threats to the nation's economy.\n\nRussia's economy is undergoing a profound transformation. In the coming years, Russia needs to radically upgrade its economic system to meet the changes and challenges dictated by the new global social and economic order. The pandemic and the global economic crisis require new strategies. On a national level, the common element is the acuteness of the issues at hand, which require re-analyzing Russia's past economic policies and finding solutions that are often unprecedented. The current pandemic has made the situation even more acute.\n\nRussia needs to implement a development model that will help the country attain a prominent position in the modern world. This is a complicated issue. The scientific works of Russian economist and author Dr. Aleksey Ryabinin provide strategies and answers to solve these problems. This is a key consideration for the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in The Netherlands to issue this year's Dr. Jelle Zijlstra Awards in the field of Economic Development to Dr. Aleksey Ryabinin.\n\nAleksey Ryabinin (1970) is the Russian Public Ombudsman for Copyright and Intellectual Property. He is a Russian economist, politician and writer. Ryabinin is the author of many articles about economic development, industrial and scientific progress and innovations. He is chairman of the editorial board of scientific journals \"Industrial Policy in the Russian Federation\" (since 2007) and \"The Municipalities in the Russian Federation\". In the monograph \"The Development of the Scientific and Technical Potential of Moscow\" (2012) Ryabinin proved that abandoning the movement towards a new urban economy and investing in the technological development of Moscow in the future may lead to a narrowing of the \"window of opportunity\" for development. In 2001-2002, under the general editorship of Ryabinin, the two-volume scientific encyclopedia \"All Russia\" on settlements and regions of the Russian Federation was published."
