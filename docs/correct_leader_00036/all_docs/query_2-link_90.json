        "text": "This Netherlands Pavilion was on average the youngest Dutch pavilion ever organized during an airshow and one of the youngest during the show. There was a great energy and potential for change with a collaborative and integrated approach. With not one but two planes of the future: the DragonFly from InHolland and the prototype Phoenix from AeroDelft, the Netherlands Pavilion drew a lot of attention and visitors.\n\nWe are very grateful to the support from Holland High Tech and the presence of Carina Weijma, deputy director International for the TopSector, as well as the support from the Ministry of Defense and the presence of delegations from the Ministry of Economic Affairs – a.o. Jetske Verkerk (MT member Innovation & Knowledge at Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy – and Climate Policy, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Berlin. On Wednesday there was a very interactive tour of the Netherlands Pavilion and a meet and greet with the participants for Vice-Admiral de Waard. The Admiral was very interested in the challenges, innovations and possible cross-sectoral cooperation in the coming years. H.E. Ronald van Roeden, ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Germany, also toured the stand and spoke with participants."
