        "text": "The first time I went to a rave is a moment I will never forget, and it can easily be the most defining moment in my life so far. The minute I started dancing, I knew that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life. Over the years my interest in what dance music is and can be started to grow into other areas like society, fashion, storytelling, and many more. That is why I co-founded Crosscut.\n\nFor Crosscut, I am responsible for all the business aspects and the overall course. My tasks mainly lay in the realms of handling finance, managing the legal side of our art, and defining branding and marketing. Thanks to my experience in the production of television programs for various Dutch media networks, and my current enrollment in Arts & Economics at the HKU, these are tasks that feel like second nature to me.\n\nI am a producer, DJ, and co-founder of Crosscut. As a producer, my interest lies in combining techno with other forms of art and experimenting with new ways of creating my music. To me, techno is a genre that celebrates experimenting and it is hard to give a strict definition since it is very wide. That is why it never bores me.\n\nExpanding the borders of what techno can be, is what I will do at Crosscut. My role with this company is to keep an overview of the production process, make decisions regarding the artistic visions of both the company and our art, find new artists who share our vision, and keep in touch with artists we already know.\n\nOriginally from Curitiba, Brazil, I moved to the Netherlands 5 years ago to chase my dream of becoming a DJ/Producer. I’m into all kinds of genres, but dance music is my thing; being able to explore new sounds without losing the fun of dancing makes the genre so compelling, I couldn’t help but fall in love with it.\n\nCrosscut will give me the chance of scouting new artists and upcoming talents, which is what I will focus on for this project. I am also responsible for communication and social media.\n\nIf we like something, we understand it. The beauty gives us access to the other. But we understand it not by contemplating it, but by living it. A rave to me is the beauty of techno! It gives us access to something different from what techno has to offer than just the music. It is us who by feeling joyful, celebrate for a moment of being. Being in the moment during a rave can bring us together as a whole and can be a liberating experience in many ways! It’s the full scene. A community where you feel at home and connected. A community where you can fully express yourself.\n\nTechno always had a lot of influences on my work as a contemporary artist! I am a creative spirit in Crosscut. I want to give you access to what Crosscut is all about through the visual side of it.\n\nTechno has always been a matter of energy to me, a question of fuel. It’s a fuel that drives me to be free. It opens the secret of life and brings joy to my life. We live in turbulent times, and it’s more important than ever that we have this fuel. It let us discover our own identities and bring us together as a whole.\n\nAs a graphic designer, my goal is to visually let people see the meaning of Crosscut and create art that shows who we are and what we stand for."
