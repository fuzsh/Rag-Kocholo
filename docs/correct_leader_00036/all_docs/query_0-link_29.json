Zijlstra became the lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the Anti-Revolutionary Party for the Dutch general election of 1956 and served as party leader from 23 April 1956 to 3 October 1956, and as the parliamentary party leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the House of Representatives from 14 June 1956 to 3 October 1956 and a Member of the House of Representatives from 3 July 1956 to 3 October 1956. After a slow cabinet formation the third Drees cabinet was formed and Zijlstra remained Minister of Economic Affairs. The Drees III cabinet fell on 22 December 1958 and a caretaker cabinet was formed by former Prime Minister Louis Beel of the Catholic People's Party. Zijlstra remained as Minister of Economic Affairs and simultaneously served as Minister of Finance in the second Beel cabinet. Zijlstra again became the lijsttrekker for the Anti-Revolutionary Party during the Dutch general election of 1959, and served as party leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party a second time from 29 December 1958 until 26 May 1959. After a quicker formation the new De Quay cabinet was formed on 19 May 1959.

On 14 October 1966, the Cals cabinet, the successor of the Marijnen cabinet, fell after the party leader of the Catholic People's Party Norbert Schmelzer introduced a motion of no confidence against the cabinet and Prime Minister Jo Cals, who was a member of his own party. The Dutch political landscape was fractured and Zijlstra was asked to form a caretaker cabinet of which the primary task was to write out an early general election in 1967. Zijlstra became Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs on 22 November 1966 and resigned as a Member of the Senate. Zijlstra simultaneously served as Minister of Finance, leading the Zijlstra cabinet until 5 April 1967 when the De Jong cabinet was installed."
