        "text": "The Dutch deep state, like many European deep states, was rebooted after World War II by the British and Americans. As in most European nations, Operation Gladio was a major locus of control. As the Belgian and Dutch Gladio division were reported to be working in tandem, the Brabant Massacres can be (at least in part) credited to the Dutch deep state as well[1]. The Dutch were the leading drug traffickers in the EU from the 1980s and were named during the 2010s as one of the \"world leaders\" of hosting child pornography by global prevention hotline[2], the British Internet Watch Foundation[3] and the Dutch Internet Domain Registrator[4], with the royal family and their contacts being named in child abuse networks by CAVDEF[5]and multiple newspapers according to ISGP[6]. Free of mass casualty \"terrorist\" attacks for at least 10 years, and housing many Western-backed international courts may reflect its close ties with the Supranational Deep State.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Netherlands, at the mouth of the Rhine river, was an important trading hub in medieval Europe.\n\n17th century\n\nThe Dutch East India Company was chartered in 1602, and competed with the British East India Company to extract profit from the area.[7]\n\n“The Netherlands has a long history with cocaine. In the early 1900s, the Dutch East India Company – having exploited and enslaved millions of people – began growing coca in its colonies in Indonesia. There was even a cocaine factory in Amsterdam, which supplied marching powder to all sides in World War One. When international treaties finally put a halt to the Dutch’s rampant coke dealing, Rotterdam emerged as a key import site for the illicit trade of the drug from South America.”\n\nVice (2020) [8]\n\n20th Century\n\n1901 - Tafelronde\n\nFull article: Tafelronde\n\nEvery year since 1901 the private Tafelronde (English: Round Table) has gathered every six weeks, where important Dutch people within politics, media, the economy and the civil service meet in private to discuss strategy. Membership in the Round Table is reserved for the most select deep state operatives.\n\n1950s - Bernhard's reign\n\nCourtesy of ISGP-Studies.com;\n\nFull articles: Klaus-Georg von Amsberg, Juliana Wilhelmina\n\nDuring the first decades after World War 2, the sole known group to carry out influence was formed and headed by Prince Bernhard. The first decades describe their activities.\n\nBernhard operated a ruthless, secret cluster of NGOs, cheating on his wife (and accused of abusing children)[9] in their palace by corporate outlet De Telegraaf). Among his groups included the Dutch Tie Club and Rijkens Group aimed at gaining control of Indonesia by all means necessary supporting every member of the club who publicly aimed for it, the 1001 club, a club of businessmen with connections to organized crime, environmentally destructive development, and corrupt African politics along with dozens of others. Bernhard enjoyed free reign as his only opponent proved to be his wife, whom he silenced after revealing her to be best friends with a spooky activist hand-healer. The CAVDEF page on gladio shows the enormous abudance and cover up of child abusers postioned in the royal palace and the government, for whom the Netherlands and in particular Amsterdam proved to be a place very open to homosexuality before it became a tool for sexual blackmail.[10]\n\nIndonesian War Crimes\n\nThe Dutch committed war crimes after they tried to reclaim control of the Dutch East-Indies, in 1945, sometimes in cooperation with the British[13]. Many files in the Dutch national archive are still secret, more than seventy years later[14].\n\nBilderberg\n\nFull article: Inlichtingen en Operatiën\n\nBernhard von Biesterfeld appears to have evolved into a key figure in the Dutch deep state after Józef Retinger chose him to head up the first Bilderberg Meeting, which was held in the Netherlands in 1954. The group, initially exclusively male, has had 182 Dutch members[15] over the years, more than other similarly sized European states.[16] (By way of comparison, there have only been two documented Dutch visitors to the Pinay Cercle: Cornelis Bossers & Frans Alphons Maria Alting von Geusau).[17]\n\nPossession, production and trading of Cannabis was made illegal during the 1950s as the main source - Indonesia - was lost.[18] According to a parliamentary inquiry supported by the Dutch MOD and a study from the VU University Amsterdam, Bernhard ordered the launch of what they first named a \"stay-behind network\" of secret service agents that had secretly started opposition groups against the Germans or Russians in the late stages of the war. These agents - around 10 first - tried developing a plan to have a back-up mechanism in place for armed civilians that would fight against Russians.[19]\n\n1960s - Increasing US Deep state influence\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, US Deep state had vastly more money than the BVD, and used it to exert influence into the Netherlands. By 1958, for example, the CIA paid the salaries of approximately 51 of the 691 employees of the Dutch service.[20]\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\n\nFull article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\nThe Dutch became aligned and started to perform missions for the US government, even revealed to have accepted a request from NATO and Germany to place 22 B28 nuclear bombs at Volkel Air Base[21]. These bombs and an US Air Force squadron was placed there with the task to fly to Cuba if the Cuban Missile Crisis would get out of hand. the Dutch would not acknowledge this until 2013, when Ruud Lubbers revealed it himself[22]. NATO did not acknowledge this not until 2019[23].\n\nDrug Trade Resurgence\n\nStarting in the 1960s, the port of Rotterdam became the largest port of Europe. The port has grown into a massive corrupt Harbor, where police, customs officials and North-African and South American gangs import over $4,5 billion in cocaine alone.[24][25]\n\n1970s\n\nAfter fighting for the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies, the South Moluccans were forcibly exiled to the Netherlands, with the Dutch government promising that they would eventually get their own independent state, Republic of South Maluku. The Moluccans were a small pawn for the CIA which resulted in some blowback for the Dutch; multiple train hijackings, attacks, and an attempt to kidnap Juliana - a first in the Netherlands - resulted in 19 deaths in the 1970s.\n\nCIA stealing nuclear secrets\n\nAbdul Qadeer Khan received a doctorate in metallurgical engineering from Leuven University in 1972 and joined the Physics Dynamics Research Laboratory in Amsterdam, a subcontractor of URENCO in Almelo, Netherlands, where he worked on gas centrifuge uranium enrichment technology. In 1974, Dr Khan returned to Pakistan taking drawings of the top-secret centrifuges operated by URENCO with him and, in 1976, established the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), an advanced highly enriched uranium (HEU) facility near Islamabad, to develop a Pakistani nuclear bomb.\n\nHowever, Ruud Lubbers, former Dutch prime minister, revealed in August 2006 that the Dutch authorities came close to arresting Khan twice — first in 1975 and later in 1986 — but the CIA requested that they let him act freely.\n\nBernhard's undoing\n\nPrince Bernhard played a major role until his exposure by the Lockheed/Bribery scandals, which caused the cancellation of the 1976 Bilderberg. When Dutch Prime Minister Joop den Uyl ordered an inquiry Bernhard refused to answer reporters' questions, stating: \"I am above such things\".[26] The results of the inquiry led to a constitutional crisis in which Queen Juliana threatened to abdicate if Bernhard was prosecuted. Bernhard was spared but stepped down from several public positions and from chairing the Bilderberg by the notorious strange minister Henk Vredeling, who smuggled arms for Israel during the Yom Kippur War, resulting in adding the Dutch to the 1973 Oil Crisis according to the official narrative. This formed the peak of Bernhard's reign and iconized an important change of leadership for Dutch deep state leadership.\n\nUnbeknownst to many[27], after the final report revealing the Lockheed scandal with Prince Bernhard was uncovered to Den Uyl and the Dutch public (becoming a bestseller along the way), the Dutch Commission of Three consisting of Henri Peschar, Marius Holtrop & André Donner included a secret chapter of 12 pages in the version to Den Uyl. The secret pages described Bernhard having orchrestrated[28] a similar deal with US Aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman, Den Uyl chose to secretly stash this part away in a secret safe in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam for a minimum of 50 years[29], only to be revealed in 2005 by a scholar from the University of Amsterdam, as Queen Juliana threatened to abolish the whole monarchy (with Queen Beatrix refusing to take the throne), and presumably their contacts and influence as well, as several scholars ensured Bernhard was to be convicted if this passage was not hidden.[30]\n\nNew Deep State organizations\n\nAround the 1980s at the 1981 Dutch Cabinet crisis, several new groups were formed, although some ended up intertwining most notable groups were;\n\nJuliana and her remaining Bilderberg connections like Paul Bremer, Max Kohnstamm and Victor Halberstadt.\n\nKlaas Bruinsma as new drug kingpin of Europe.\n\nOperation Gladio fractions linked to the Brabant Massacres and RaRa.\n\nDeep politicians including head banker of all central bankers Jelle Zijlstra, Ruud Lubbers, Wim Kok and Hans van den Broek and NGOs like the JASON Institute and Clingendael.\n\nKlaas Bruinsma's start\n\nThe Amazing Story Of The Biggest Dutch Kingpin Ever Klaas Bruinsma - Holland Crime Boulevard\n\nFull article: Klaas Bruinsma\n\nThe now-notorious drug policy was strangely green-lit in the 70s with the withdrawal on the complete ban on cannabis and the start of the coffee shops in Amsterdam and Utrecht, which was termed \"an experiment\". The Dutch cities had a favourable location - close to each other and other European cities, high density, and quick and modern infrastructure. As globalization caused companies to outsource to Asia, the oil crisis of 1973 and the loss of jobs caused many people to become homeless (or hopeless) and turn to drugs or working for the Chinese, Russian and Italian mafia that had set-up hubs in Amsterdam as everything was legalized [31]. After an extreme surge of heroin[32], the rise of drug dealers in the main streets of Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam & The Hague, most main drugs except cannabis were banned at the end of the 70s. At that point many Dutch crime bosses had already become skilled drug dealers known for their expertise.\n\nDutch PM Dries van Agt, wanted to legalize drugs, to end the European War on Drugs, but was stonewalled, which causes the Dutch criminals to become skilled dealers. This became the start of the Dutch illegal drug trade where Klaas Bruinsma and his group started their career, first from Amsterdam. In 2018, Bruinsma was part of a documentary of \"most famous drug kingpins of all time\" on Netflix alongside El Chapo, Jemeker Thompson and Christopher Coke.[33]\n\nMax van der Stoel became the main coordinator of the Inlichtingen en Operatiën. Klaus Bruinsma and dozens of other lawyers, politicians and Bernhard and his 1001 Club appear to be connected in one way or another in a sex cult, with alleged ritual abuse all the way to Marc Dutroux, which links the Dutch deep state to Dutroux via a second route, as the first route was the fact that member Paul Latinus of the Westland New Post was a suspected Belgian Gladio member.[34] ISGP has their names pop up several 100 times regarding these matters, Bruinsma's crime syndicate were being called by one news site as being involved at secretive parties in Amsterdam's financial district with child abuse in the 1990s. The editors of the article specifically mentioned stopping the investigation for the moment citing \"the urge to stay alive for quite a while\".[35]\n\n1981 Dutch Cabinet crisis\n\nFull article: 1981 Dutch Cabinet crisis\n\nDries van Agt's opposing Joop Den Uyl didn't go well. Van Agt - a staunch opponent of Israel and of the Dutch War on Drugs - was removed by a refusal of the whole parliament to work with him over his policies aimed at not joining frozen conflicts and promoting the peace dividend in Europe. The shadow cabinet members of the early 70s tried to steer public opinion in Dutch corporate media, who began to lend some Operation Mockingbird language, including terms such as \"Hollanditis\", a word coined in 1981 by US historian Walter Laqueur to describe the rise of Dutch pacifism. In 1983, 550,000 participants demonstrated in The Hague aimed against the deployment of US cruise missiles carrying nuclear warheads, and a media campaign against the Revolutionary Anti-Racist Action or RaRa who bombed property. The Dutch Interior Minister termed them a \"terrorist\" group. One of the victims was a prince and the owner of a leading supermarket-chain member of the 1001 club. Questions remain as if even he didn't receive protection, these attacks - perhaps part of the same group heading the Brabant massacres need further research.[36] After Van Agt, the Dutch political apparatus aligned much more with the UK and US policies and joined the new \"war on terror\" started after the Jerusalem Conference on International Terrorism in 1979 where Joop den Uyl was a speaker. Den Uyl's shadow cabinet's and government coalition's that took control after Van Agt were full of politicians (not known at that time) clandestinely pursuing other goals, varying from being part of child sex networks to leading Gladio divisions, including individuals such as Ed van Thijn, Max van der Stoel, Henk Vredeling, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst & future PM Ruud Lubbers.\n\nAll Dutch Prime Ministers since 1982 have visited the Bilderberg: (Ruud Lubbers (1982-1994), Wim Kok (1994-2002), Jan Peter Balkenende (2002-2010), Mark Rutte (2010-).\n\nGladio 1.0\n\nQuia Oportet\n\nFull article: Quia Oportet\n\n\"When you name 'gladio', alarm bells go off at high-positions, and they'll do their best to kill the case\".\n\nUp until this point the Dutch never admitted Gladio to be existent. Several weapon stashes were found and reported by corporate media, but mayors, prosecutors, and other high-ranking officials all denied knowing the origins. Even when newspaper Elsevier released an article naming several Dutch spooks and \"at least two MPs as KGB-agents by our source, a spook himself.[37], later revealed to be CIA-agent Carl Armfelt.\" Ruud Lubbers admitted[38] the existence in 1990 of a Dutch division of the Operation Gladio-network. Lubbers denied the division to have bombed anything, and downplayed the activities massively. A Belgian agent revealed to Amsterdam main newspaper Het Parool that the Belgian and Dutch Gladio-networks were in fact actively working together, meeting regularly.[39] A company listed Quia Oportet is secretly listed elongation of the Dutch Gladio divisions with a founding date of 1992... with an alleged end date just months after 9-11.\n\n“A year earlier, Dutch crime bosses, Klepper and Mieremet were arrested by police. In their car machine guns and hand-grenades were found. When the EOD discovered that none of the granades had serial- or production numbers, the MiVD was alerted. The MiVD suspected that the grenades were from a depot that was hidden in the forest of Scheveningen near The Hague, containing 40 metal boxes with pistols, machine guns, revolvers, hand-grenades and explosives. It was raided in the 1980s by thiefs. They replaced the boxes with fridges, causing the theft to be only noticed years later as metal detectors found nothing during the inspection. (...) Klepper and Mieremet were sentenced to 16 months in jail. Both were assassinated years later.”\n\nMenno van Dongen (September 2007) [40]\n\nPeter R. de Vries, one of the only two who ever ran a piece on Gladio on Dutch TV was shot dead by the successors of Bruinsma's cocaine group in 2021.\n\n21st Century\n\nMiVD joining the drug trade\n\nWillem Matser\n\nFull article: Willem Matser\n\nLieutenant Colonel in Staff and MiVD spook Willem Matser, an advisor to the Secretary of the NATO Lord George Robertson and Chris Donnelly, was arrested in February 2003[41] after a \"package to Colombia\" was intercepted at Schiphol Airport with €200.000 in bank transfer receipts and \"a CD with €200.000.000 in payment orders\" with a fake document authorizing the transfer of the same amount of money to Romania. A country - according to French state-investigators - hijacked by CIA agents for the war in Iraq. After his very lenient conviction, Matser and articles or even images depicting them - vanished into the mist. Among other things Romanian Secret Service connected a continental pedophile network, with the US lobbyists involved, but that investigation was met with a cover up after convicting one person, who remained silent on the matter.[42][43] The official - a known historian and close friend of head of Romanian intelligence Ioan Talpes - working in Romania, abused at least two girls aged 10 and 13 in the house of the Romanian intelligence service.[44]\n\nWar on Terror\n\nFull article: Jan Peter Balkenende\n\nInfighting[45] between deep state fractions according to ISGP caused Pim Fortuyn to be assassinated on 6 May 2002, a week before prime ministerial elections. His direct opponent Jan Peter Balkenende was elected instead. According to an international weekly journal of science called Nature Balkenende's government oversaw at least 27 instances of the CIA planes using Dutch airports near Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague for extraordinary rendition in his first 4 years. The leaked reports and their findings were not reported in Dutch commercially-controlled media.[46]\n\nOn 26 March 2010, Wikileaks posted a classified CIA analysis of possible PR-strategies to shore up public support in Germany and France for continued war in Afghanistan. After the Dutch government fell on the issue of dutch troops in Afghanistan in April 2010, the CIA became worried that similar events could happen in the countries that post the third and fourth largest troop contingents to the ISAF-mission. The proposed PR strategies focus on pressure points that have been identified within these countries. For France it is the sympathy of the public for Afghan refugees and women. For Germany it is the fear of the consequences of defeat (drugs, more refugees, \"terrorism\") as well as for Germany’s standing in NATO. The memo is a recipe for the targeted manipulation of public opinion in two NATO ally countries, written by the CIA. It is classified as Confidential / No Foreign Nationals.[47]\n\n9-11\n\n9-11 whistleblower Danny Jowenko died in a suspicious car crash after exposing the 9-11/WTC7/Destruction to be bullocks on Dutch national TV. Flight school owners Arne Kruithof and Rudi Dekkers (who trained some of the 9/11 hijackers) were both the target of an investigation and assassination attempt in the 2000s. One of Kruithof his companies was found to be operating a plane used by Manual Noriega, while Dekkers was arrested in an intercontinental drug trafficking ring after admitting to the undercover cop to be \"doing it for years\" in 2012.\n\nMabel Wisse Smit\n\nMabel van Oranje first gained prominence as to-be wife of Prince Friso. An unusual alliance of AIVD-agents, journalists and Wikipedia-admins have hinted she has in fact hidden a far more secretive role - being an intelligence asset.\n\nAIVD Operations\n\nFull article: Erik van Sabben\n\nThe Dutch Intelligence services have been increasingly linked in the 2000s to performing acts of (digital) war on behalf of American and Israeli interest. Erik van Sabben was a \"a well known\" Dutch engineer and spook. De Volksrant and journalist Huib Modderkolk wrote in 2024 that Van Sabben was a spook recruited in a 2005 \"off-the-books\" billion-dollar operation by the Dutch intelligence agencies AIVD and MIVD on the order of the CIA and Mossad, to hack a nuclear facility in Iran with computer virus Stuxnet in 2008. Van Sabben died in a suspicious motor cycle \"accident\" in Dubai two weeks after the infiltration undercover operation had been successfully concluded. An AIVD officer later admitted on the promise of secrecy in 2024 that -- although the official local investigation ruled the single-bike accident \"his own fault\" -- van Sabben was assassinated and \"paid a high price\".[48][49][50][51]\n\nIn 2018 two Dutch-Turkish men were arrested in Greece on suspicion or a plot to kill president Erdogan with 7 others[52]. The AIVD had these two already on the scope because of the fear that the men were being used by a radical left-wing Turkish organisation: the DHKP-C. That is a Marxist movement that has already allegedly carried out several attacks in Turkey, and is labelled a \"terrorist\" organisation by the EU. DHKP-C is also active on Dutch soil, the AIVD claimed. Turkish security services even claim that the order for a suicide attack in 2013 in Ankara was given from the Netherlands.[53] According to local Turkish media according to newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, one of the men was \"shot dead after a firefight\" in November 2023 at the Greek-Turkish border.. Turkish media suspected him of trying to enter Turkiye to stage a \"terrorist attack\", with 3 others travelling with him and a \"guide\".[54]\n\nInstitute for Statecraft\n\nFull article: Dutch Cluster\n\nFull article: Nieuwsuur\n\nSijbren de Jong, Maria de Goeij and the Dutch MOD set up the Dutch cluster of the Integrity Initiative around a meeting called \"Answering Russia's Strategic Narratives\". In March 2019 the Clingendael Institute hosted Strengthening Europe's 'soft' and 'hard' defence, a Chatham House rule meeting attended by at least 4 members of the UK Deep state's Institute for Statecraft.[55] The Dutch governments forcefully retired multiple investigative journalism programs and started its own skilled in Russophobia in the 2010s as well called Nieuwsuur.\n\n“The Dutch, according to secret documents, are an important partner of the NSA, together with Germany, France and Norway as 'Third Party Country'. This puts the Dutch only one step below the other 4 Anglo-Saxon countries the US directly trades info with in their Five eyes-program.”\n\nHuub Modderkolk (2014) [56]\n\nThe Dutch government actively tried to not get any more tests by not outsourcing testing labs. And denies that happened. English subtitles on YT.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nWhile other governments were mandating the wearing of face masks in shops and public places, in an ostensible effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 the Dutch government refused to do so (except for public transport),[57] observing the lack of evidence that such a measure was advisable[58][59] - a possible indication of the limits of the Dutch deep state. The government also forced care workers to work untested in elderly homes, citing a lack of tests, which has caused hundreds is not 1000s of preventable deaths in these elderly homes. In 2020, an average of 25% of all Covid-19 deaths were from these homes.[60][61]\n\nLeading Virologists vocally called for 2nd and 3rd and harder COVID Lockdowns, citing the elderly homes, causing the Dutch to follow the UK and German policies.[62][63] On the 23rd of January the Dutch entered their first curfew since Nazi Germany raided them in World War 2. The curfew was followed by massive riots, widely reported in Dutch and international media, and soon used as reasoning in surrounding countries to even extend and harden the lockdown.[64] State-TV hosts called kids participating in riots \"terrorists\".[65][66]\n\nFunctions\n\nFull article: Netherlands/Deep state/Functions\n\nThe Dutch deep state has a distinctive set of functions in the Supranational Deep State. The country hosts a number of high profile international groups such as the International Criminal Court, International Court of Justice and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which are used for public relations purposes. The country has large illegal drug trade and child pornography industries. Although known as \"socialist\" country, the DS doesn't handle whistleblowers very well; as the suspicious deaths of Danny Jowenko, Bruinsma-investigator Maarten van Traa, Demmink's personal driver, Rob Mostert, Demmink-investigator Fred de Bouwer, spook and soldier Peter Meijer, and also the unexplained murder of former SIGINT-commander Hans van de Ven has shown. Van de Ven was outed and left with a empty resume after leaking the Maximator-Alliance.\n\nExposure\n\nJoël van der Reijden's ISGP has been a useful source for creating this page and analysing the Dutch role in the policies of the SDS.\n\nSecret Service File Missing\n\nIn 2023, the AIVD told newspaper NRC \"a file containing potentially incriminating facts about Prince Bernhard has disappeared from the archives of the Internal Security Service (BVD). It concerns a folder that could contain information about spying by the prince for the Nazis, and about the so-called Stadholder Letter, in which the prince allegedly offered his services to the German occupiers during the war.\". The map appeared to be stolen or replaced by a spook in the national archives with a note \"\"Volume 1 missing. Notes: Feature=C (Pr. B. spy).\" \"[67]\n\nThe NRC revealed more missing documents to be missing: Lockheed affair liason Hans Teengs Gerritsen, a friend of the prince mentioned in the affair.. Lockheed also allegedly tried to bribe MPs Joop van Elsen and Ad Ploeg. Those files also had been taken from the archives, along with the file of KLM director Besançon who is alleged to have received bribes. The previously included info in the file of Chris Lindemans, is also missing. Lindemans was alleged to have betrayed the Allied airborne landing at Arnhem in September 1944 as well as being a friend of the prince. He committed suicide in 1946.\n\nAn example\n\nPage nameDescriptionOperatiën en InlichtingenPrince Bernhard started this division that quite strangely - investigated, confirmed, and even covered up by the MiVD - had most of its weapons ending in the hands of the Dutch leading drug kingpins like Klaas Bruinsma.

At a higher level, this (neo)conservative network actually got its way with the 2004 murder of Theo van Gogh by an Islamic radical.”Joël van der Reijden\n\nJan Peter BalkenendeJan Peter Balkenende“I don't get why you are so annoying and negative about this. Let's be happy together! Let's say: The Dutch are finally able to do this again, that VOC-mentality, looking beyond borders, dynamic! Right?!”Jan Peter BalkenendeKlaas Bruinsma“Boys Club de Amstel ... ran by a certain Mr. Kroner [Kreuner]. A business partner of him was liquidated in the 90's, an acquaintance of de Dominee [Klaas Bruinsma], who regularly visited there. ... Getting back to Piet van Haut: This fantasy-filled caricature also brought along a certain Marc [Dutroux], later known as the Monster of Belgium. This Marc had contacts with Duscedo, of the imperium of the gentlemen Tukkers and consorts. [Incorrect, unclear sentence follows, so loosely translated:] With Charles Geerts pulling the strings.”Joël van der Reijden\n\nISGP\n\nKlaas BruinsmaKlaas Bruinsma“Who is to say that Abbas, Bruinsma and \"the Hakkelaar\" weren't used as pawns in a game much larger than they were, much as Mink Kok seems to have been used time and again? They are allowed to flourish a little bit, receive a little protection, a little legal aid, and when their time is up some rival gang takes them out and that one gets the protection when necessary. It's entirely possible. But where would the manipulation of these mafia groups come from? Most likely CIA Gladio/\"stay behind\" networks, which, during the Cold War, revolved around Prince Bernhard and individuals as Bib van Lanschot and Cees van den Heuvel.”Joël van der Reijden\n\nISGP\n\nKlaas BruinsmaKlaas Bruinsma“Is Bruinsma's early connection with Mabel a coincidence? Maybe. But there are an awful lot of coincidences here. Mafia bosses Klaas Bruinsma, Etienne Urka and John Engelsma all seem to have had close direct or, through Oscar Hammerstein and Frits Salomonson, very close indirect ties to the Dutch royal family. Rutger Schimmelpenninck, partner in Boekel de Neree and curator of Text Lite, also has very close ties to the royal family.”Joël van der Reijden\n\nISGP\n\nKlaas BruinsmaRuud Lubbers“At the foot away, this trouble-field needs to be down-tunneled in a motion, so that appointments along this road with the cabinet can be out-concluded quickest and as best.”Ruud LubbersNetherlands/Deep state/Functions“The accusations against Bruinsma, Geerts, Scala and Videorama speak for themselves. And this same group has its ties to members of the Dutch royal family. Not mentioned yet, in 1989 Geerts put up a $500,000 bail for U.S. porn boss Reuben Sturman, a good friend of his. Back in the 1970s and 1980s Sturman and his partner Robert DiBernardo, both working for the Gambino crime family (DiBernardo was murdered on orders of John Gotti, soon after he (once again) was indicted for production and distribution of child pornography), maintained a virtual monopoly on the hardcore porn industry in the United States. They were also repeatedly accused of involvement in the production and distribution of child pornography, which until the late 1970s still was somewhat sanctioned. A gigantic portion of this type of material actually was imported from the Netherlands at the time.”Joël van der ReijdenPieter Omtzigt“Long I've objected comparing Malta and the Netherlands. But here something else is not functioning. That is power and opposing power. There is such an intimate connection between the coalition and parliament, between the parliament and the media, between the parliament and the justice system. If you ask difficult questions, you become the problem. There is something wrong with the checks and balances. And it goes further. The criminal justice system doesn't work anymore. All the NGOs that hog the government's money, all don't work anymore. Know what happens nowadays? They don't dare to speak, because the government will kill their subsidy. We've organized or system so precisely that our flock of politicians values the party-chairman more than the electorate.”Pieter OmtzigtPieter Omtzigt“I've stopped with that case after Sybrand Buma stormed into my office. Because he had been given an instruction from Mark Rutte that I had to stop with the questions in parliament about Joris Demmink.”Pieter OmtzigtOperation Gladio/Exposure“When we began 4 years ago with this case, we couldn't believe this lawyer, but now I can't deny it any more. We discovered that the justice departments in Belgium, The Netherlands and in particular in Amsterdam have made several cases in international weapons smuggling silently disappear. These departments have consistently remarked that illegal ownership of weapons would be tackled directly. I can't deny that this has happened on purpose. Of course, the Dutch Ministry of Justice makes mistakes that sometimes have sad consequences, but, these volumes, this stubborn, and this simple can only happen if it was your intention all along. Admitting it, they will never do, because you'd have to admit why you did this, and the experiences from the 1980s with Gladio learns that these sort of deals will be denied till the bitter end. Which means we'll probably never know of the exact dealings.”Peter R. de VriesJoël van der Reijden“There most certainly is evidence that quite a bit of child abuse takes place at the highest level of society and that people in this milieu for the most part care little about this problem. Also, there have been very demonstrable ties between the royal house of Orange, Klaas Bruinsma-Etienne Urka-John Engelsma-Charles Geerts Maffia and Intelligence & Operations. This last group was the Dutch brand of CIA Operation Gladio/\"Stay Behind\" network. These ties have to be investigated much deeper, because it appears that it's from this milieu that a lot of manipulation of the Dutch state has taken place, seemingly including paedophile entrapment operations. And isn't it just really strange that all Dutch names that have been leaked over the years with regard to paedophilia include homosexuals?”Joël van der ReijdenMark Rutte“Vision is like an elephant that robs your view. (...) When I think of the word \"vision\" I immediately think: go see an ophthalmologist!.”Mark RutteHenk Vredeling“Congresses don't buy jet-fighters”Henk VredelingPeter R. de Vries“When we began 4 years ago with this case, we couldn't believe this lawyer, but now I can't deny it any more.
