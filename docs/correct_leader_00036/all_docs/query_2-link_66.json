        "text": "The PSF is pleased to announce its fourth batch of PSF Fellows for 2023! Let us welcome the new PSF Fellows for Q4! The following people continue to do amazing things for the Python community:\n\nJelle Zijlstra\n\nThank you for your continued contributions. We have added you to our Fellow roster online.\n\nThe above members help support the Python ecosystem by being phenomenal leaders, sustaining the growth of the Python scientific community, maintaining virtual Python communities, maintaining Python libraries, creating educational material, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in local regions, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.\n\nLet's continue recognizing Pythonistas all over the world for their impact on our community. The criteria for Fellow members is available online: https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/. If you would like to nominate someone to be a PSF Fellow, please send a description of their Python accomplishments and their email address to psf-fellow at python.org. Quarter 1 nominations are currently in review. We are accepting nominations for Quarter 2 2024 through May 20, 2024.\n\nAre you a PSF Fellow and want to help the Work Group review nominations? Contact us at psf-fellow at python.org.\n\nThe Python Software Foundation is pleased to announce our participation in co-starting a new Open Initiative for Cybersecurity Standards collaboration with the Apache Software Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, other code-hosting open source foundations, SMEs, industry players, and researchers. This collaboration is focused on meeting the real challenges of cybersecurity in the open source ecosystem, and demonstrating full cooperation with and supporting the implementation of the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). With our combined efforts, we are optimistic that we will reach our goal of establishing common specifications for secure open source development based on existing open source best practices.\n\nNew regulations, such as those in the CRA, highlight the need for secure by design and strong supply chain security standards. The CRA will lead to standard requests from the Commission to the European Standards Organisations and we foresee requirements from the United States and other regions in the future. As open source foundations, we want to respond to these requests proactively by establishing common specifications for secure software development and meet the expectations of the newly defined term Open Source Steward.\n\nOpen source communities and foundations, including the Python community, have long been practicing and documenting secure software development processes. The starting points for creating common specifications around security are already there, thanks to millions of contributions to hundreds of open source projects. In the true spirit of open source, we plan to learn from, adapt, and build upon what already exists for the collective betterment of our greater software ecosystem.\n\nThe PSF’s Executive Director Deb Nicholson will attend and participate in the initial Open Initiative for Cybersecurity Standards meetings. Later on, various PSF staff members will join in relevant parts of the conversation to help guide the initiative alongside their peers. The PSF looks forward to more investment in cybersecurity best practices by Python and the industry overall.\n\nThis community-driven initiative will have a lasting impact on the future of cybersecurity and our shared open source communities. We welcome you to join this collaborative effort to develop secure open source development specifications. Participate by sharing your knowledge, input, and raising up existing community contributions. Sign up for the Open Initiative for Process Specifications mailing list to get involved and stay updated on this initiative. Check out the press release's from the Eclipse Foundation’s and the Apache Software Foundation for more information."
