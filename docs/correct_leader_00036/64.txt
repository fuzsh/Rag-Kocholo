In our most recent episode of the Gay City News podcast “Thank You For Coming Out,” creator and host Dubbs Weinblatt (they/ them) welcomes Jelle Zijlstra (he/him).

Jelle is a Dutch, Jewish, queer activist, working for Greenpeace as a community organizer. In another life he used to be a theater director and actor, which he sometimes still does for fun. His Jewish and queer identities are deeply intertwined with his work as both an activist and an artist.
