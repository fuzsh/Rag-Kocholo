With a heart for people and a spirit dedicated to service, Rev. Bert Alexander touched the lives of countless individuals through his unwavering faith and compassionate nature. Bert also served in the mission fields in Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, where he led countless individuals to Christ with his heartfelt sermons and compassionate actions.\n\nReverend Alexander leaves behind the love of his life and mother of his children, Ruthie, with whom he shared a relationship and friendship. Their story is a testament to enduring commitment and partnership to and for their family.\n\nHe is survived by his cherished children and their spouses: Amy Alexander; Dr. Stephen Shane and Shalaine Alexander; Jeremy and Katherine Alexander; and Allison and Michael Brown. Each of his children carries forward his legacy of love, faith, and kindness.\n\nHis grandchildren: Dominic Alexander, Savannah Brown, Derek Alexander, Tristan Brown, and Asher Alexander, were the pride and joy of his later years. His boundless love for them will be remembered and cherished forever.\n\nIn addition to his immediate family, Bert is remembered by countless friends and extended family members who loved and adored him. His legacy of love, faith, and service will continue to inspire and guide those who follow in his footsteps.\n\nHarrison Raymond Banks, M.Div. ’68, aged 86, passed away on July 3, 2021. He was born June 11, 1935, on a small farm near Brown City, MI, to Peter Harrison and Gladys L. Banks. His half-sister, Ola Mary, welcomed him to the family. Other siblings came along in the following years: Deloris, in May 1936, Orville, August 1938, Marilene, June 1940, and Eldin in March of 1951.\n\nThey had a full house and enjoyed playing table games together. The farm gave them lots of outdoor fun and work as well; cows to milk and care for, chickens to collect eggs from and a large garden to plant and weed in the summer months.\n\nAfter graduation from Brown City High School as Valedictorian, Ray went to work with his father, an automobile mechanic, in the Detroit area for the summer.\n\nHe was granted a full scholarship and began classes at the University of Michigan where he received his Bachelor of Science degree in June of 1958.\n\nWhile still a student at the U. of M., he courted and married Nancy Lou Cady of Gladwin, MI, in December 1955. To this union was born Garth Raymond (1957), Karla Rae (1958), Paige Nanette (1961), and Peter Melvin (1962). Ray worked for Dow Chemical Co. in Midland, MI for 5 years following his graduation.\n\nIn 1962, Ray answered the call of God on his life and moved the family to Wilmore, KY, where he entered Asbury Theological Seminary. He worked full-time at several different jobs, and carried a three-quarters load at seminary. He was graduated with a Master of Divinity degree in May of 1968. Nancy also was given her PHT (“putting hubby through”) degree at this time.\n\nThe family looked to the West for future employment and Ray joined the Pacific Northwest Conference of the Free Methodist Church. At that time, the conference included WA, British Columbia and Alaska. Ray’s first appointment was to Surrey, B.C. for two years. The next postings were: Seattle, WA for five years, Summerland, B.C. for six years, Olympia, WA for five years, Kamloops, B.C. for two years and then Vancouver for four years. He served seven churches in WA and Canada during his ministry, ending with Roblin, Manitoba for the final six years.\n\nRay took a break from pastoral ministry in 1992-1993 and attended St. Stephen’s College in the University of Alberta for a year of Residency of Pastoral Education.\n\nDuring his years as Pastor, Ray also served as chaplain in local hospitals and with Citizen’s Patrol, community policing and was always involved in various community organizations where he lived.\n\nRay retired in 1999. He and Nancy bought a condo in Abbotsford and settled down to retirement. However, Ray’s missionary spirit revived and he took the position of coordinating Project Missions, a Global program in the Free Methodist Church to raise funds through the collection and sale of used postage stamps and stamp collections. Ray had been a life-long stamp collector off and on throughout his lifetime, so this fit well with his passion for missions and his skill with stamps. Project Missions raised well over $50,000 over the years.\n\nRay had a “pastor’s heart” and in the years of his ministry, many came to faith in Christ. When faced with the human condition, Ray often said, “All have sinned, but we have an advocate with the Father: Jesus Christ, who forgives our sins.”\n\nRay is predeceased by his parents, half-sister Ola Mary and sister, Marilene. He is survived by one sister, Deloris (Jay) and two brothers, Orville (Rita) and Eldin (Holly), his wife, Nancy of 65 and a half years, his four children: Garth (Amy), Karla (Kaskadare), Paige and Peter (Cheryl); six grandchildren and their spouses: Tyson, Elise, Nanette (John), Rilla, Micah (Sara), Hannah (Jerome) and two great granddaughters, Gavia and Pepper.\n\nReverend Herman Boyette, B.Div. ’52, aged 94, of Bowling Green, passed away at Resthaven assisted living facility on Friday, May 29th 2015.

In 2003, Paul and Pat moved to Marion, IN, to work with WGM at its headquarters for the last ten years – as a regional director for six years and with their IT department until he passed.\n\nPaul’s driving force for his life is best stated in his life verse, Romans 10:14: How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they hear without a preacher? Rooted in his obedience to God, his passion was sharing the gospel of Christ with everyone who came into his life. the legacy he leaves his family and friends is one of faith and the strength found in God alone.\n\nIn addition to Pat, his wife of almost 58 years, Paul is survived by his three daughters: Laura (and Bert) Walther of Wilmore, KY and their two daughters, Beth Walther and Becca (and Daniel) Devita; Linda (and Josef) Gafranek of Lexington, KY and their two daughters, Rachael (and Austin) Whitson and Sara Jo Gafranek; and Lisa (and Keven) Fritts of Washington, D.C. and her four children, Violet Powell, Zach Powell, Quin Powell, and Teresa (and Jacob) Bame.\n\nPaul is also survived by his siblings: Faith Shingledecker of Wilmore, KY; Ken (and Connie) Shingledecker of Holland, MI; and Lois (and David) Scroggins of Hallsville, TX; adopted son, Thomas L.

Gary graduated from West Texas State University in Canyon, Texas where he met his wife, Carol Wright. The two wed on August 14, 1971, in Perryton, Texas. Gary worked in banking in Houston and Canadian, Texas until he felt called to full-time Christian ministry. Gary and his family moved to Wilmore in 1988 where he attended Asbury Theological Seminary and earned a Master of Divinity.

Survived by loving family: Ann and Bruce Campbell-Janz (sister in law and brother in law), Doug and Carla Campbell (brother in law and sister in law), nieces and nephews: Victoria (Clayton) Scott, Allison Campbell, Emily Campbell, Isaac Janz, Madeleine Janz. Predeceased by his brother in law, Paul Campbell and nephew Charles Campbell.\n\nJohn was born to farming parents outside Tillsonburg. John’s strong work ethic, zest for life and love of books began early in life. His pastor in grade thirteen influenced John’s decision to go into ministry.\n\nJohn had a keen mind that was fostered through his studies at Roberts Wesleyan College, Rochester, N.Y. (1973), Asbury Seminary, Kentucky (1977), Wycliffe College University of Toronto (1987) and Registered Psychotherapy Degree (2012). His intellectual capabilities complemented his enthusiastic love of people. He made friends in all walks of life.\n\nJohn pastored Free Methodist Churches in Cambridge, Sarnia and Etobicoke. His last 18 years of professional life was as hospital chaplain at Hamilton Health Sciences. His compassionate care to patients and staff was remarked on regularly. They knew him by his fondness for purple shirts and ties.\n\nJohn enjoyed sports, mostly watching them, but had in recent years enjoyed pickleball at the community centres. He could tell you who won the Super Bowl in a given year or who was and is playing for the Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Raptors and Maple Leafs. John loved working with his wood working tools though he was the first to admit he was better at demolition than creating. Many hours were spent in the basement with Jason cutting, nailing and building shelves or other edifices.\n\nRuth and John were to celebrate their 32nd wedding anniversary on October 12th. John loved Ruth deeply and his nickname for her was “Saint Ruth” on a good day – and there were many good days. Though John had never been off the continent prior to their marriage, he embraced Ruth’s love of travel. Within nine months of their wedding, they were on their way for a month long trip to Africa. This was the first of many travel adventures they enjoyed. He was especially pleased to visit his father’s homeland of the former Yugoslavia in 2010.\n\nJohn cut a wide swath and his death leaves a huge hole for Ruth & Jason, family, friends, his church communities and neighbours."
