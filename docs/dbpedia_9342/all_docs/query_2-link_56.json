At the time I wrote this article (2013) I had only seen 29/11 and 38/11 lifepaths come through as clients (remember, I add the date of birth straight across, there are other methods for finding 11‚Äôs in numerology). Even now, I only know of a smattering of pure 11 lifepaths (children), and have never met a 47/11. Please Google Dan Millman 47/11 for info on this lifepath. I do know that 47/11 is the vibration of phrases like ‚Äòmeditation‚Äô, ‚Äòmental illness‚Äô and ‚Äòmental health‚Äô so these topics could be relevant to a 47/11 lifepath or person with a 47/11 name etc. Best wishes Sarah Options\n\n11 Suns on 9/10/2016 7:21 AM\n\nYou forgot 47/11 ‚Ä¶!!!?

I‚Äôve even had many other experiences following that. Recently I found that my life path is 11, and then it all seemed to make sense and come together. I‚Äôve always been a spiritual person, and always felt different. Anyway, just the other day I was filling out paper work for a new job that I was possibly getting. I have no idea why, but on all the dates with my signature‚Äôs I put the month down as 11, instead of 12. Then I realized even my appt. Was set at 11:00. Recently I had asked to be guided down the right path. So it made me smile because I thought maybe this was a sign that this job would be good for me. I just thought it was neat how it happened. I have no idea why I kept putting 11. I thought maybe this is my guide. Right when I was leaving they actually told me I was hired. As soon as I got into my car, I even saw the time 11:11. Excited,I told my husband. With a slight attitude he said, so what are you obsessed with the number 11 now? Then saying I was worse than the guy off the movie 23. I was irritated on so many different levels and reasons. It‚Äôs like I was just shot down. But coincidence or not I thought it was neat and it made me smile. I told him forget it, I won‚Äôt tell you nothing else. I even took this as a sign in itself to not tell him anything. People can be very discouraging, how do you deal with that? Options\n\nSarah Yip on 16/10/2016 2:05 AM\n\nHi Jack, welcome to the community! As another 11 who sees 11:11, and works with clients who are in the same boat, I have an idea what you are going through. Please see my 11:11 on clocks page on this website for many articles and podcasts. Basically, you are a Lightworker and you‚Äôre at a spiritual turning point. I urge you to follow your intuition, no matter how crazy it seems. Life will get better and better as you listen to your Higher Self. I am proof of this. You can stay in touch via email by signing up on my homepage. Best wishes, Sarah Options\n\nJack Ridgewell on 11/10/2016 4:27 PM\n\nThanks for the read. I really think i am going mad.

I‚Äôve been very interested in astrology and palmistry and have been introduced to it from a very young age (since my mom is a Pisces, which I‚Äôve noticed are very spiritual) but numerology are still very new to me, and after researching on a few websites including yours I discovered that my number is number 1 / 09-12-1996 but something‚Äôs just a bit strange, because to be a number 1 you have to be born on either the 1st, 10th, 19th or 28th and I was born on the 9th? And still my calculation gets down to number one! I‚Äôm just curious if this means anything? Options\n\nSarah Yip on 24/05/2015 10:26 PM\n\nHi Danisha, it‚Äôs wonderful to hear from you. I recommend checking out facebook pages like Lifepath 11 (my master numbers page) ‚Äì also consider looking further into numerology and spirit guides. Education is the path to freedom and meeting like-minded people. If you see my page on Find Your Lifepath you can read about personal years, or you are welcome to book a reading sometime.

Options\n\nRick on 7/01/2015 2:56 PM\n\nHey there bday twin! I was born on 1/27 as well and have always been extremely spiritual as of age 11. I had my most prophetic dreams at 11 that have mainly come pass, however, there are still a few that I‚Äôm awaiting. My new years resolution for the past five years has been to TRUST myself (intuition)! I am not a follower, nor a leader, yet I inspire people w/o trying because I have great will power, integrity, and on the flip side I attract a LOT of unwanted attention because of this as well. I am also very insecure, have spent majority of my life lonely (although considered above average in looks and character), and I expect nothing but greatness from my myself and others. I was once a push over and very timid. I am now 33 and have grown (maturity) great deal in the past 3 yrs. I attract a great deal of admirers, however, I repel admirers mainly because I am of great character and self worth. I am also sarcastic, impatient at times, and will choose alone time over partying. That was a mini book, I know. I needed to get that off my chest Options\n\nIrina on 3/01/2015 11:03 PM\n\nDear Sarah, It‚Äôs my first time here, on your blog. I‚Äôm writing with one question which torments me and I haven‚Äôt found anything online about it. I‚Äôm 29 now (born on 22.11.1985) and in the last 7 months I had the following issues with doors/gates: 1. I could not enter one day the door from my job building, even though I was the one to open the door every morning for 3 years and had no problems till then. The building has no.11 as address.; 2. I was accussed by my former boss for breaking the hatch of other door (from other apartment which belongs to the organization) and asked me to even pay for it, because he was told I had been the last person there. It wasn‚Äôt true and I didn‚Äôt break anything and he realised that when the repairman had told him the hatch is fine and the problem is his own key that is broken. The apartment is no.11 as well; 3.I parked my car near the building site next to my building block just like other 40-50 cars. And guess what -the building site wanted to create an exist exactly through my own car and called the police to take my car from there (and made me pay more than 200 Euro, which is a huge amount of money in my country);4. 3 days ago I broke the door handle from my own room and 2 days ago the door handle from the apartment door. I know that 11 is often represented by a door/gate. I‚Äôm an 11 and I‚Äôve just turned 29 (11). Do you think I‚Äôm about to die this year, taking into account all these odd circumstances/messages? 2014 was an awful year for me.. I quit my job, I‚Äôm in a law suit with my former employer for not giving me my salary for several months of working, I am full of debts now, because I have not received my salary on time.. Terrible. I found a new job, but it is part-time so it‚Äôs not like sunshine for me, but it‚Äôs interesting to tell you that the building I now work in has also 11 number (47) :). Please tell me what do you think about all theses messages with doors/gates. Another point to mention : Saturn has just entered the 11th house and it‚Äôs located in the same spot as it was at my birthday. So sorry for my long message and full with grammar mistakes :(. I hope you could give me an answer, because I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening with me üôÅ and what to do. Options\n\nchristmas lights installation on 19/12/2014 9:57 PM\n\nI hope at least.

There is a big difference between intuition and imagination. It takes practice to know which voice is which, but the results are well worth it. Once you trust your self (as in, higher self) you‚Äôll never feel alone again. Plus you can manifest really easily. We choose our lifepath,this is not something that‚Äôs forced upon us.

I was just reading one , and I was curious about your comment that ‚Äò Living at an 11 house, is not for the faint hearted ‚Äò. I am a life path 29/11, I see 7 ‚Äòs and 11‚Äôs my whole life, so when I reads your posts it is all too familiar. I have always lived at a 7 or an 11 house my whole life without even realising it until recently. I am currently getting divorced, and have sold my present 25/7 house in which the sale price added up to 7. My house I have loved since I was a little girl is a 29/11 house. I have just recently approached the owners and asked them if they will sell it to me. They have said yes, hence my curiosity on your comment on 11 houses. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Xo Loretta Options\n\nSarah Yip on 11/06/2014 3:51 PM\n\nHi Valentina, thanks for your comment, it‚Äôs a good question! I believe that Dan Millman‚Äôs method from The Life You Were Born to Live is the most accurate way of reading a lifepath. He adds the date of birth straight across from left to right. This method produces many more Master Number lifepaths (11, 22, 33) and also gives you more detail about what kind of lifepath you are. I would say Tim Burton is definitely more of a 38/11 (Spiritual Messenger, here to be a powerful communicator) than a 20/2 (Diplomat and Peacemaker). This is a personal decision. If you have further questions please post to my facebook page The Numbers Queen. Happy calculating! xx Sarah Options\n\nValentina on 4/06/2014 1:08 PMHi! I‚Äôm from Argentina. I have a doubt on calculating my number path. some people say that it‚Äôs not correct the way you say.For example, Tim Burton -born August 25, 1958 8+2+5+1+9+5+8 38/11 BUT 8 7 5 2O/2 ( 3 cycles.

If that makes sense. I‚Äôm an eleven. And my entire life has been a whirlwind of bad choices and bad luck. A year ago numerology became a part of my life, at twenty eight years old I had finally found something that made sense to me. Something other than spirituality‚Ä¶numerology has been the closest I‚Äôve come to feeling like I am not insane, and my chaotic inner battle is not my own doing and destruction. I hope at least. Your article has highlighted what I‚Äôve already learned since first finding out my life path number, but your way of speaking, your insight, your own experience has done for me what no other author has managed this far. I‚Äôm a recovering heroin addict, on my own pretty much since I was fifteen years old, I have hope now for a future because I have belief in the nagging voice inside that begs me to hold on and tells me that something big is coming. The voice has been there forever. I just tried hard to block it out. I feared my sanity was diminishing. But you have truly inspired me. Seriously‚Ä¶It‚Äôs more important than one can imagine to finally believe there‚Äôs a reason for me and everything I have suffered and done. Thank you so much!"
