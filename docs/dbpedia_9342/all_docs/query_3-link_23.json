        "text": "Data analysis and statistics\n\nThe pictures were analysed by three members of our team (D. Kořanová, F. Čapek, L. Pleskač), who were blinded for the true direction in which the photos were taken. They measured the directional bearings on the screen with respect to the top of the photograph (being set as 0°) of all birds that could be clearly recognized. For each measured flamingo its activity was assigned to one of the following activities: stationary (resting, standing, grooming) or locomotor (walking and feeding) (cf. Fig. 1 and 2 for typical silhouettes). The coded photographs were analysed with Microsoft PowerPoint in a threestep procedure (cf. supplementary material Fig. S1). First, arrows were drawn along the median body axes of every bird visible in the photograph (the arrow direction was marked by the head position) and each activity category was analysed separately. Secondly, the underlying photograph was removed and replaced by a compass rosette divided radially into 36 ten-degree segments. The compass rosette was oval-transformed to compensate for the perspective distortion of the photographs. Thirdly, each arrow was moved to the centre of the rosette and its azimuthal direction was determined by the nearest 10° mark. Subsequently, the topographic bearings were back-transformed to true magnetic bearings (= magnetic alignment) and subsequently also with respect to solar azimuth (= solar alignment) by a researcher (P. Nováková), who knew the true compass bearing of the respective photographs. Circular statistics were carried out with Oriana 4.02 (Kovach Computing). Since birds in one group or flock are, with respect to their directionality, not independent units, we calculated means over all the bearings of flamingos showing the same behavioural pattern on each photograph. From the mean vectors for each photograph a grand mean vector was calculated for each flock at a given place and given time. Note that each photograph/flock records a unique situation differing from that recorded in another photograph/another flock in at least one, mostly in several of the following parameters: locality and site, date, time of the day, and/or weather. Furthermore, photographs were taken from different compass azimuths. In most photographs, most flamingos were resting, standing, or grooming (stationary behaviours), only about 14 % (in Kenya) and about 26 % (in Europe) of the flamingos were assigned as performing locomotor activities.\n\nFrom means for each unique situation (photograph) we calculated separate grand means for Kenya, diverse European localities, and Europe, for stationary and locomotor activities, overcast and sunny conditions, for a.m. and p.m. periods in diverse respective combinations. First order statistics (Rayleigh test) were employed to test for significant deviations from random distribution.\n\nWe related the bearings with respect to magnetic North (= 0°) and to the sun azimuth (= 0°). The sun azimuth for each locality and given time was calculated according to the NOAA solar position calculator ( http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/azel.html). Circular diagrams were plotted in Oriana 4.02. We calculated mean alignment vectors for a.m. and p.m. sun azimuths separately. For graphical illustration only more significant results of either angular or axial analyses were selected.\n\nTable 1.\n\nLocalities and sample sizes of sampled flamingos.\n\nTechnical considerations\n\nThe question to be answered is whether the findings could have been influenced by the method of sampling and measurement. We argue against this possibility. Although errors in estimating the angular value of body direction of birds which are not aligned exactly parallel or perpendicular to the direction of photographing cannot be excluded due to distorted perspective of the picture, this kind of errors would result in rather quadrimodal distribution of values, due to parallel and perpendicular directions acting as value attractors. Since all the directions of photographs were represented in our sample, a random distribution of bearings would be a possible result of too rough measurements from photographs. There would be no reason, why one particular axis should be preferred. In fact, all the directions of photographs, when analysed separately provided the same result: flamingos aligned their body axis roughly along the N-S axis during resting (Table 2, Fig. 1 and 3). Thus the error of measurement represents noise (scatter of values) but is not systematically cumulative to one attractor value. It should be further noted that the researchers who measured the directions of the flamingos did not know the true direction of the photo and the measurements were thus blind. Besides that, should our observation be only an artifact of accuracy there would not be a difference between stationary and locomotor activities as all birds on the photo are “fixed” and thus “stationary”.\n\nTable 2.\n\nCircular statistics for axial bearings in flamingos displaying stationary activities (standing, resting, grooming), for localities in Europe, and separately for overcast and sunny weather and morning and afternoon hours. Magnetic alignment refers to bearing respective to the magnetic North (= 0°); solar alignment refers to bearings respective to the actual sun position (= 0°) calculated for the given locality, date and time of observation. It is apparent that mean vectors counted for magnetic alignment deviate for about 15° from the North-South axis, those for solar alignment deviate for about 30° from the respective sun azimuth. See Fig. 1 for illustration.\n\nAlthough some bird individuals (especially those photographed in zoos) were measured several times, the records were done at different times, at different places, under different weather conditions and during different activities. Thus, the repeated recordings do not represent pseudoreplication within the context of our hypothesis that flamingos express either solar alignment (expected: changes of alignment at different times of the day at the same locality, and congruent changes at different localities at the same sun position) or magnetic alignment (expected: no differences between mean vectors for localities and times of the day). Accordingly, means of individual bearings of birds in one group (flock) were calculated for each locality, each activity, each weather condition, and diverse solar azimuths (times of the day) separately and in combinations. Recognizing and assigning behaviour to one of the given locomotor and stationary categories is in flamingos easy and unequivocal (cf. silhouettes at the Fig. 1 and 2).\n\nTable 3.\n\nCircular statistics for axial bearings in flamingos displaying locomotor activities (walking, wading, feeding), for localities in Europe, and separately for overcast and sunny weather and morning and afternoon hours. Magnetic alignment refers to bearing respective to the magnetic North (= 0°); solar alignment refers to bearings respective to the actual sun position (= 0°) calculated for the given locality, date and time of observation. It is apparent that mean vectors counted for magnetic alignment and solar alignment deviate on average for about 40° from the North-South axis or from the respective sun azimuth respectively. See Fig. 2 for illustration.\n\nTable 4.\n\nCircular statistics for angular or axial bearings (results with higher respective significance are presented) with respect to the magnetic North (= 0°) in flamingos displaying stationary (standing, resting, grooming) or locomotor activities (walking, wading, feeding) observed at Lake Bogoria in Kenya. Note that all observations in Kenya were made under overcast conditions, separately in the morning (sun azimuth 45°), in the early and late afternoon (sun azimuths 320° and 290° respectively). See Fig. 3 for illustration.\n\nInterpretation and conclusions\n\nWe suggest that magnetic alignment calibrated by solar alignment or solar alignment compensated and corrected by magnetic alignment under overcast conditions might serve (under windless conditions) as a “direction (heading) indicator”. This alignment might be an expression of the flamingos' readiness to take off in a given direction, e.g. if the flock was suddenly surprised. In this case, it would be thus the basis of the so-called nonsense orientation, i.e. a strong tendency to fly in one direction, unrelated to any homing ability (Matthews 1961). Thake (1981) explained this phenomenon in the context of escape behaviour, arguing that “birds whose preferred orientations are sufficiently similar to those of birds around them to allow flocking to occur have an advantage over birds whose preferred orientations make flocking difficult”. Magnetic field and/or solar azimuth may also provide a reference direction to arrange the mental map (cf. Collett & Baron 1994). (It is easier to rotate the body than to perform a mental rotation of the spatial map — similarly we turn our paper map so that the north points upwards or forwards and we align accordingly, and similarly dogs seem to align when marking their territories and memorizing the marked places, Hart et al. 2013b). It should be pointed out that the hypothesis of direction indicator (nonsense orientation) does not try to compete with complex models explaining coordinated synchronized movement and direction changes in swarms and flocks of insects, fish or birds (Couzin et al. 2005, Buhl et al. 2006, Katz et al. 2011). A direction indicator applies in situations when the manoeuvrability is limited (e.g. in heavier birds and/or during landing or take-off) and or when the sight control (“what does my neighbour do”) is impeded (e.g. during a simultaneous take-off from positions hidden in dense vegetation or of animals distributed over a large-scale area).\n\nWe assume that there is hierarchy in cues which serve as direction indicators related also to hierarchy in efficacy of senses which register and process them. Because of aerodynamic reasons, the most efficient direction indicator for take-off or landing should be wind direction. If there is no wind, sun may provide an unequivocal direction indicator. Magnetoreception is probably a sense which has a lower rank in hierarchy of senses and is attended to, only in a novel environment and after cues perceived by other more dominant senses are not available or their sensing is impeded. Under sunny days continuous visual monitoring of the actual sun position is arguably easier and faster than monitoring of any cardinal magnetic direction by magnetic sense. This might be the reason why under overcast conditions, when sun position could not be visually determined, more flamingos were trying to “get into the line” with the magnetic field “in order to be ready”. Still unclear is, however, why this alignment was more prominent in the morning hours (a.m.) than in the afternoon and evening (p.m.).\n\nIt would be surely of interest to study body orientation of flamingos at night, under disturbed magnetic fields, either due to geomagnetic storms (cf. Hart et al. 2013b) or due to electromagnetic pollution (cf. Engels et al. 2014), and, of course, to analyse actual directions of take-offs and landings (cf. Hart et al. 2013a)."
