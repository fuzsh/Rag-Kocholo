        "text": "The US is at risk of losing its leadership in artificial intelligence as tighter immigration policies and efforts by rivals to attract talent chip away at the foreign nationals who contribute to most of the AI development in the country, according to a new study from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nMost American workers in AI-related jobs and students in AI-related graduate programs are not originally from the US, with 59 per cent of the country’s employed computer scientists with PhDs born abroad while 65 per cent of the computer and mathematics professionals in Silicon Valley are not US nationals. India and China are the most common countries of origin for non-US tech professionals and international students in AI-related fields.\n\nThe job market for AI talent is tight globally, as shown by the labour market indicators cited in the report. It noted that the number of AI-related job postings on the popular job site Glassdoor have doubled in 11 months and the site predicts demand will outstrip supply for at least another five years. The China-based Tencent Research Institute has estimated there are roughly 300,000 AI researchers and practitioners worldwide, with market demand for millions of roles.\n\nAlthough US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February directing federal agencies to prioritise funding for AI research and development, the Trump administration has made it more difficult for foreign talent to obtain work visas. Administration officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and senior White House figures, have portrayed Chinese studying in the US as potential threats to national security.\n\nFears over growing hostility towards Chinese academics and students working and studying in the US deepened after some Chinese-American professors were removed from their posts at universities for allegedly failing to disclose their ties to institutions in China. Some Chinese scholars also said their 10-year multiple-entry US visas had been revoked without explanation.\n\n“It is tremendously important to have international scholars be able to meet in person to discuss issues in technology ethics, especially in AI, which is transforming the world so rapidly. Visas have supported these meetings,” said Brian Green, director of technology ethics at the Markkula Centre for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University in California, in a policy paper published earlier this month by the non-profit group Partnership on AI.\n\nTo address the global talent shortage, a number of countries have launched and expanded work visa programs to attract AI tech talent. Canada, Britain and France have introduced visa programs for temporary foreign workers, targeting entrepreneurs involved in technology development.\n\nTwo years ago China’s State Council released a road map outlining the goal for the country to become a global AI leader by 2030. At the time the Chinese government vowed to lure top-notch AI scientists in neural networks, machine learning, self-driving cars and intelligent robotics by offering competitive compensation packages.\n\nHowever, the Thousand Talents Plan (TTP), China’s flagship recruitment programme used to hire some of the world’s brightest tech minds, has added to US concerns of potential espionage by China. The plan was described by the US National Intelligence Council as “facilitating the legal and illicit transfer of US technology, intellectual property and know-how” to China.\n\nA report published in July by Macro Polo, the in-house think tank at the Paulson Institute in Chicago, concluded that the US should double down on importing foreign talent because among the main building blocks of a competitive AI ecosystem – which include data, policy, companies and hardware – talent was one area in which the US leads China.\n\nMany foreign experts have become leaders in the American AI industry. Andrew Ng, a Chinese-American computer scientist specialising in the field served as founding leader of the Google Brain team and later as chief scientist at Chinese search engine giant Baidu, responsible for driving the company's global AI strategy and infrastructure. Ng later founded Landing AI and co-founded the Coursera online learning platform.\n\nAnother high profile example is Li Fei-Fei, a professor and co-director of Stanford University's Human-Centered AI Institute, who was born in Beijing and immigrated to the US as a 16-year-old. She served as chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud and in 2016 was named in the Carnegie Foundation’s “Great Immigrants: The Pride of America” honoree list.\n\nFor more insights into China tech, sign up for our tech newsletters, subscribe to our Inside China Tech podcast, and download the comprehensive 2019 China Internet Report.
