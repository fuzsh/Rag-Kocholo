        "text": "While Justin Kenny was alive, he traveled far and wide, blending his loves of music and the outdoors.\n\nSo even though he was born in Fayette, educated in Tuscaloosa and most recently lived in Birmingham, it's not surprising that the 27-year-old had hiked 1,000 miles from home when his life ended at railroad tracks in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nKenny had been hiking the Appalachian Trail as a summer jaunt. According to a report by The Associated Press, his body was found alongside the tracks in Duncannon, Pa., early Saturday morning. He apparently had been struck by a freight train. Police said foul play wasn't suspected.\n\nThe son of Jim Kenny, Shelton State Community College student services director and adviser to the college's newspaper, the Shelton Courier, Justin Kenny had studied both music and fitness at Shelton State.\n\nHe sang with the Shelton Singers, studying under Glinda Blackshear, and earned a wellness personal trainer certificate at the college in 2000.\n\nMilady Khoury-Murphy, director of Shelton State's Wellness Center, described Kenny as a very positive, upbeat young man, always a pleasure to be around.\n\n\"He was always friendly, reaching out to people,\" Murphy said. \"He had a magnetic personality.\"\n\nIn addition to the more classical music training, Kenny also wrote, sang and played rock 'n' roll with bands such as Dust and his own Separate Species.\n\nDecade Music manager Jason Elmore, who played with Kenny in Dust, said he was an \"incredible guy.\"\n\n\"If you ever asked him to do something for you, he was always there,\" Elmore said.\n\nAnother former Dust member, Chris Arnold, described Kenny as adventurous, a real lover of the outdoors.\n\n\"I spent many nights with him, just me and him,\" Arnold said.\n\nDespite the tragic brevity of his life, his friends noted that Kenny made the most of it. He'd hitchhiked across the country, canoed the Cahaba and worked jobs from an airport in Las Vegas to a sheep farm in Norway.\n\n\"He lived it to the fullest,\" Arnold said.\n\nHis family will receive visitors from 2-3 p.m. today at Dowdle Funeral Home, 270 McAdams St. in Millport (20 miles northwest of Reform on Highway 17 North).\n\nA memorial service will be held at the funeral home. Burial will follow in the family plot at Andrews Chapel in Liberty."
