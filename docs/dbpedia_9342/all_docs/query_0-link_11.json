        "text": "DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC/Gray News) - A baby chick born with four legs drew a crowd at an Iowa state fair.\n\nGary Kassa, the owner of Anything is Kassable farm just outside of Eldridge, says he’s been hatching chicks at the Mississippi Valley Fair for about 20 years, KWQC reports.\n\n“We hatch chicks every day here at the fair about three dozen,” Kassa said. “This morning, I went to the incubator to peel out the chicks, as usual, and this one seemed kind of odd to me.”\n\nThe chick was born with four legs. It drew quite the crowd as people flocked to check out something they may never seen again.\n\n“From what I can gather, that’s about a 1 in 10,000,000 occurrence, and a lot of them don’t survive. This one, as you can see, is doing very well,” Kassa said.\n\nHe says the chick seems to be very healthy and has a bright future ahead.\n\n“He’s doing very well. He’s eating, drinking. I don’t see anything other than the legs – two extra legs – that really is anything different,” he said.\n\nKassa says he and his wife plan to take the chick home with them and raise it.\n\n“He will undoubtedly spend the rest of his life with us at our place,” he said."
