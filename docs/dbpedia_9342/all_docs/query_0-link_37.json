        "text": "Dr. Raymond Damadian, who built the first magnetic resonance imaging scanner, which revolutionized doctors’ ability to diagnose cancer and other illnesses — but who, to his dismay, saw the Nobel Prize for the science behind it go to two others — died on Aug. 3 at his home in Woodbury, N.Y. He was 86.\n\nThe cause was cardiac arrest, said Daniel Culver, a spokesman for the Fonar Corporation, which Dr. Damadian founded in 1978.\n\nSince Dr. Damadian and his research assistants finished building the first M.R.I. scanner more than 40 years ago, it has become an essential piece of medical equipment, allowing doctors to peer inside the human body with more detail and greater resolution than X-rays and CT scans provide, without exposing patients to damaging radiation as many other technologies do.\n\n“We take it for granted now, but M.R.I. is absolutely spectacular,” Dr. Burton P. Drayer, the chairman of the radiology department at the Mount Sinai Health System in Manhattan, said in a phone interview. “M.R.I. is better at detecting cancers, particularly in the brain and spine.”\n\nBut the question of who owned the idea, and the device, was a contentious one from the start.\n\nTwo scientists whose research contributed to M.R.I. technology were later awarded a Nobel Prize, an honor that Dr. Damadian felt should have also gone to him. And no sooner had his machine come on the market than a handful of major corporations started producing their own versions, leading to years of court battles over patent rights.\n\nThe vision of scanning the human body without radiation came to Dr. Damadian in the late 1960s, he said, when he was working on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy — which, until then, had been used to identify the chemical makeup of the contents of a test tube — at Downstate Medical Center (now SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University) in Brooklyn.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
