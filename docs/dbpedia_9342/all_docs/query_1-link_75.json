        "text": "Name: Shani Timms\n\nAre you currently a Pathway Member?: Yes\n\nWhat was on your manifestation list?: Partnership, Interstate Move, Selling my business\n\nWhat workshops did you use and what blocks did you discover during the DIs & workshops?: Unblocked Inner Child, Unblocked Love, Unblocked Shadow, but pretty much everything!!\n\nWhat expanders did you find?: My main expanders are for relationship:\n\n- Elle Fergusson & Joel Patfull\n\n- My business coach and her partner\n\n- TBM Magnetic stories\n\n- Lacy (of course)\n\nI had many other fragment expanders for my move and selling my business!\n\nWhat tests did you face? Which did you pass? Not pass?: In June 2020, I was meant to move to Barcelona, but covid hit & my move was no longer possible. I was pretty shattered, but I knew there was a deep-down reason why! At that point, I had not discovered Lacy's work. Fast forward a month, and I stumbled across Lacy's work and was immediately drawn in! Every word she was speaking was talking directly to my heart; I had tried all the manifestation techniques before. I had visualized and been positive until I was, as Lacy calls it, 'Blue in the face'. Things would come through, but it would be super slow, not 100%, which is why I knew I was missing a key process.\n\nTests made SO much sense once I had done Lacy's work... I always thought men coming into my life were a sign they were 'the one', even when they were not anything like my list. I would make myself small and try to make the relationship work. Over and over again, I would settle for WAY less than my worth and get my heart broken time and time again. I know now the Universe was doing me a massive favor; when I have a broken heart, I dive deep into soul work and listen to what it is trying to say.\n\nSelling my business and moving to magical Byron Bay in Australia all seemed to flow easily, I had a few tests, but it all moved fast and landed in place so nicely. But relationships... BOY, was I tested:\n\nTest 01 - We went on a few dates; I didn't sleep with him just as Lacy had said, and three weeks in, I called it quits. In group situations, he acted as if I didn't exist and was very hot and cold with his communications and arranging dates. He also planned a date in which he invited two other guys, and they surfed the whole time and told me to get a lift home with one of the other guys. BIG NO from me, bye boy!\n\nTest 02 - Such a dreamboat, beautiful soul, lots from my list. We met on New Year's and shared the most magical 24 hours, dancing the night away, morning sunrise swim, and cuddles all day. We had another date, and I could feel my gut saying NO. I had felt this feeling before but never honored it, but I felt like he was a big shiny test, so I told him I wasn't interested in seeing him anymore. That following week, I ran into him four times!! WTF UNIVERSE! He ended up calling me and said that he couldn't stop thinking about me and he wanted another shot. So I caved; I went fully in with my heart open and stated I wanted a relationship from the get-go - but two months down the track, I asked him where his head was at. He said he couldn't commit. Again BYE BOY! I definitely ran into the fire with that test!\n\nHow did your manifestation come through?: In regards to selling my business, I had a really strong ping to message a competitor and see if they were interested. He called me straight away and said that he had only been thinking about buying our business that morning (he also called at 4:44 pm, of course). He was a hot prospect but then quickly fizzled out and wasn't responding to any of our emails or calls. We waited another two months, which really felt like a lifetime. I was worried we would never sell and that all of the business would be a waste.\n\nFinally had another ping to pop the business on an online marketplace. Within 24 hours, I was getting three phone calls daily, emails, SMS's about the business. It took us two weeks to find the DREAM buyers; funny enough, they lived around the corner from me too. They were everything we wanted for taking over our business, and they gave us the EXACT price we had asked for! Initially, they offered us 20% less, but we stepped into our worth and held tight on our price.\n\nIn regards to moving interstate and landing our dream home! When I had decided to move to Byron Bay instead of Barcelona, we were in the middle of one of the most strict lockdowns in the world due to Covid. Borders between Victoria and New South Wales were closed and had been for months. I had a super-strong ping to quit my job as my gut told me the move would be happening soon. Everyone thought I was crazy; I gave five weeks notice to my boss.\n\nWork offered me more money and said they would pay for my flights up if I stayed another two months instead. I knew this was a test, and I declined. On my second last week of work, it was announced the borders would be opening in 1 month! This gave me the perfect time to pack up my life and move. The next week we landed our dream home, exactly what was on my list with the most EPIC housemates ever. In regards to partnership, I am still waiting for my man to come along. I kind of love getting tests as I know that each one I am getting closer. I have full faith in this process and Lacy's work. I can feel it is very close!\n\nIf you'd like, please include your IG handle:: @shanitimms"
