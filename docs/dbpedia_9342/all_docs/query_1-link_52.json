        "text": "From the minute you found out you were expecting, you couldn't help but daydream about who exactly you’d be meeting in nine months. While you surely wondered what color eyes your baby might have or what her smile might look like, you likely also imagined her personality.\n\nWould your baby be stubborn, artistic and down-to-earth? Perhaps quiet, emotionally intelligent and magnetic? Or maybe rambunctious, upbeat and fiery?\n\nThose are completely understandable questions to ask, given that getting to know your little one is one of the most exciting aspects of parenthood. And natal, or birth, astrology is a fantastic, fun tool that can help you do just that.\n\nAlthough each child has her own unique, complex astrological birth chart, which is basically a snapshot depicting the location of every celestial body in the solar system at the time of a baby's birth, you’ll do well to start with your little one's sun sign (the zodiac sign that the sun was moving through on your baby’s birthday, which is believed to color her self-image and identity).\n\nYou might also pinpoint your baby's moon sign (which can speak to her emotional personality) and the rising or ascendant (which is thought to influence how your child might present herself out in the world).\n\nYou can find all these astrological placements (and more) by casting a birth chart, or using a moon sign calculator or rising sign calculator.\n\nAs you read on, you’ll learn what each of the 12 sun signs says about baby’s personality — now and in the near future — as well as what you can expect if baby's moon or rising falls in each sign.\n\nAries Baby (March 21-April 20)\n\nYour little one, born under the cardinal fire sign Aries, symbolized by the Ram, is destined to be an independent go-getter. That’s because Aries is ruled by Mars, the crimson planet, which in astrology rules how we take action and express our energy.\n\nMars’ influence means your child will be fired up to get a move on ASAP and preferably at a lightning pace. Whether you’re on the go in a jogging stroller or preparing her next meal, there’s no such thing as too fast for a restless, energized Aries.\n\nHowever, moving too slowly might fuel a red-faced temper tantrum. In other words, you may find that, even more than with the average eager tot, you’ll do well to work on the value of patience with your tiny Aries.\n\nBecause Mars oversees courage, athleticism and assertiveness, you’ll also find your mini Ram is a big fan of any kind of physical activity. And she’ll also be gleeful about any chance to win or come out on top, whether that’s by hitting a “finish line” you set up with blocks or hearing applause after tummy time.\n\nThat said, you could find that your little Aries is particularly motivated and engaged when you lean on competition and the allure of potentially being declared “the winner” of any activity. Once she's learned to walk, it won’t be long before she wants to run! Toddlerhood could see your rambunctious, impulsive, bold kiddo zipping around the playground, excited to learn to ride a tricycle or play catch.\n\nAs the first of 12 signs and the one associated with the First House of Self, an Aries baby will grow to stand strong in her sense of self, valuing independence and inner drive. And as a cardinal sign, your little Ram will excel at taking the initiative and thinking in a big-picture, visionary way.\n\nAt the same time, we think of Aries as the “baby” of the zodiac, so your little one will exude playfulness and wide-eyed innocence well beyond childhood.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Aries: Your Aries moon baby will be quick-tempered but then refocus her attention on the next thing just as speedily. She'll find comfort and security in fast-paced, high-energy, playful activities.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Aries: Your Aries rising baby comes off as truly self-sufficient and capable of taking charge of any situation. She'll also likely be perceived as athletic, dynamic and direct.\n\nTaurus Baby (April 21-May 20)\n\nBorn under the fixed earth sign Taurus, symbolized by the Bull, your little one is down-to-earth and particularly in tune with the world around her, which she enjoys engaging with through all five senses (touch, taste, smell, sound and sight). These characteristics are owed to Taurus’ ruling planet, Venus, which in astrology oversees beauty, art, relationships and values.\n\nVenus’ influence means your mini Bull revels in tender, pleasurable moments, whether that’s feeling cozy in a super soft swaddle blanket or being strolled along on a leisurely nature walk. In fact, spending time outdoors will be particularly centering for your Bull. And because she's highly tactile, skin-to-skin time will be especially beloved by you both.\n\nAs your Taurus grows, you can tap into her Venusian love of art by bonding through creative pursuits like finger painting or listening to music (perhaps especially songs with a heartfelt message, like “Skidamarink” or “My Favorite Things” from The Sound of Music). As an Earth sign, your Taurus baby could flaunt a natural green thumb early on, so involve her in family gardening projects.\n\nBut no matter what activity you’re enjoying together, know that even the tiniest Taurus will be happiest when she can move at her own, typically deliberate, slow, steady pace. If she's pushed to keep up with a faster, even frenetic lifestyle, you could be facing a torrential downpour of tears.\n\nAs one of the fixed signs, Tauruses are creatures of habit, especially connected to familiar surroundings and routines that contribute to a sense of comfort.\n\nSince she was born under the sign associated with the Second House of Material Possessions, your Taurus baby will be especially attached to objects, like a special lovey. Because the Second House also involves self-worth, your little one will grow to have a strong sense of her own value, and when she make friends with people she feels in sync with, she'll be endlessly loyal and reliable.\n\nAs a fixed sign, Taurus babies do have a tendency to be a little bit hard-headed at times, finding it tougher than some kids to adapt to change. So you'll do well to work with her on the power of finding ways to “let it go” like Queen Elsa.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Taurus: Your Taurus moon baby feels nurtured and cared for when she's engaging in routines and practices that are familiar (think: being sung the same “good morning” song daily upon waking or enjoying a predictable rotation of yummy snacks). Her connection to the five senses also means she feels more secure when she's surrounded by familiar scents, sounds, sights and textures.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Taurus: Your Taurus rising baby comes off as peaceful, steadfast, determined and perhaps a bit cautious. Others perceive her as a child who will take her time and has strong preferences that she struggles to divert from.\n\nGemini Baby (May 21-June 21)\n\nYour little one, born under the mutable air sign Gemini, symbolized by the Twins, is communicative, social, curious, vivacious and highly motivated to zip from one activity to the next on a hunt for more mental stimulation. Her nature is informed by her ruling planet, Mercury, the “messenger planet,” which oversees communication, transportation and technology in astrology. (Mercury also rules Virgo.)\n\nMercury’s influence results in Gemini being one of the signs that’s most eager to learn and soak up new information. Thirsty to connect with everyone from you or a sibling to a grandparent or a neighbor, little Geminis are most joyful when they’re out in the world, observing and engaging with people. Destined to be a super-communicator, your little one might “chit-chat“ with you early on, even if that’s just through coos or giggles.\n\nAnd Mercury’s energy is just as much about listening as it is about talking, so you’ll notice that your tiny Twins baby is especially interested in taking in a variety of sounds — whether that’s a bird’s song at the park or your BFF’s laugh. You could be astounded by her flawless mimicry!\n\nInto toddlerhood, your little Gemini will become even more wide-eyed, playful and friendly. She'll channel this energy into a vast number of interests, many of which are based in language and technology, which is Mercury’s terrain.\n\nFor example, as much as your Gemini baby loves diving into one book after the next, she will also adore making up original stories with you at bedtime. And games or learning activities she can engage with via an app or TV show will also carry special appeal.\n\nIn general, any opportunity she has to take in new information will excite your tiny Gemini. And as one of the mutable signs, she’ll also appreciate the freedom to flit from one thing to the next.\n\nYou might also do well to try new \"baby and me\" classes, take her to different playgrounds, or introduce her to new flavors of food on a more regular basis, as your mercurial Gemini relishes change and variety.\n\nAs the sign associated with the Third House of Communication, which also oversees siblings and short-distance travel, your Gemini baby will revel in planned opportunities to connect with others and explore, like playdates and mini trips (even if that’s just to the grocery store with you).\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Gemini: Your Gemini moon baby will be comforted by lots of one-on-one and group interaction and learning activities. Her emotional wellbeing goes hand-in-hand with her cerebral nature, so as she grows up, discuss big feelings, and talk her through emotionally challenging moments to help her feel nurtured.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Gemini: Your Gemini rising baby appears quick-witted, energetic, high-spirited, friendly and fun-loving. Her interest in a wide range of activities will make her a magnet for a wide social circle.\n\nCancer Baby (June 22-July 22)\n\nBorn under the cardinal sign Cancer, symbolized by the Crab, your baby is sensitive, compassionate, heartfelt, intuitive and sentimental. These traits stem from Cancer being ruled by the moon, which not only oversees emotions but represents maternal energy in astrology. Both factors contribute to your little Crab’s desire to be super close to you. Whether you’re babywearing while walking by the nearest body of water or maintaining loving eye contact during a feeding, she’ll feel blissfully happy and secure.\n\nYou’ll also do well to connect with your mini Cancer by offering tender sounds and gentle \"I love yous.\" These can be helpful tips to keep in mind as you consider that being ruled by the moon can result in shifting moods and sensitivities for your Crab. You could find that she's actually even more influenced by lunar phases (like dramatic full moons) than the average child. And in moments that she feels disconnected from you, especially when she's having a tough time, your Crab will be prone to fussiness and tears.\n\nIn fact, if your little Cancer is feeling especially blue, she may get quiet and need dedicated tranquil time to re-center herself. (Think of it as her going into her shell.) But being reminded of how much you care (think: lots of hugs, kisses, and, as she gets older, sweet notes) and enjoying a dedicated, cozy space of her own with a favorite lovey, will help your child feel truly calm.\n\nAs sensitive as she may be, Cancer is the cardinal water sign, after all, which means she can take the initiative and pursue any lofty goal she sets her mind to achieving. Cancers are quite creative and will find a great deal of fulfillment from channeling their big-hearted emotions into artistic endeavors.\n\nThat said, be prepared to applaud your sweet Crab toddler should she present you with a posterboard of colorful scribbles or a song she's made up for you on the fly.\n\nYou’ll also notice that as your baby Cancer grows, your tiny Crab will adore laughing with you and getting you to laugh. Her keen, goofy sense of humor is truly endearing. And because she's innately caregiving, a Cancer kiddo will enjoy learning how to help you feed the family pet or teaching a younger sibling how to use utensils.\n\nYour little Crab’s nurturing nature is also the result of the sign being associated with the Fourth House of Home Life. Your Cancer will cherish even the simplest moments spent with loved ones, and her sentimental nature means that, as she gets older, she’ll enjoy recalling details of family get-togethers and engaging in special traditions. Your child will also hold onto photos and objects she associates with happy memories.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Cancer: With the moon in the sign it rules, your Cancer moon baby is especially in tune with her emotions and incredibly intuitive. She gains a sense of security by fostering strong bonds with you and other loved ones and caring for all the people (and animals!) in her life.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Cancer: Your Cancer rising baby will be perceived as sensitive, sweet and self-protective. Others see her as thoughtful and compassionate, dedicated to caring for everyone and everything, from her playmates to her pets.\n\nLeo Baby (July 23-August 22)\n\nYour little one, born under the fixed fire sign Leo, symbolized by the Lion, is self-assured, big-hearted, outgoing, self-motivated and endlessly upbeat. These characteristics are owed to Leo’s ruler, the vitality-bringing sun, which oversees self-image, confidence and identity in astrology.\n\nYour tiny Lion also gets her take-charge, optimistic nature from being a fire sign. From the time she's made their grand entrance into the world, you’ll notice just how magnetic your little Leo is. Her charisma and innate joyfulness tends to endear her to others, and you’ll get the sense that your regal Lion is positively soaking up the limelight.\n\nDon’t expect much camera shyness from this kiddo, as she adores being the center of attention. And as a summer baby, she'll be a big fan of spending bright, sunny, ideally warm days out in the world, meeting and greeting everyone she comes across.\n\nAt the same time, your baby Leo will be happiest when she feels like she's commanded your attention. Showering your Lion with loads of cheerfulness, playfulness and warm, loving, affirming words (“Wow, you’re so smart!”) will help her feel seen and connected to you.\n\nAs she enters toddlerhood, your little Lion will begin to demonstrate her aptitude for leadership. It wouldn’t be too wild to think of your Leo as a budding auteur — she's just as eager to direct as she is to star in the story of her life. So giving her plenty of opportunities to feel like she's calling the shots — even if that’s by giving her a choice between two outfits or outings — is key to smooth sailing.\n\nAnd as one of the fixed signs, your mini Lion has the tendency to not only prefer to stick to a set, known game plan but to dig her heels in. So she may insist on wearing a favorite Halloween costume to preschool in December or eating only clementines for a snack.\n\nBecause Leo is associated with the Fifth House of Self-Expression, your baby Lion is naturally imaginative and enjoys any kind of theatrical experience, whether that’s putting on a play or initiating a dance party. She excels at owning her voice and, by demonstrating confidence and pride in who she is, might even inspire friends and family to do the same.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Leo: Your little Lion moon baby is truly comfortable roaring about her feelings — of both the positive and negative variety. And she’ll feel most cared for when engaging with loved ones through buoyant, playful activities (like having a funny conversation as two characters from her favorite movie).\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Leo: Your Leo rising baby appears confident, driven, sunny and self-aware. Whether she ultimately opts to be a lawmaker or a TV star, she has a celebrity-like savoir faire.\n\nVirgo Baby (August 23-September 22)\n\nBorn under the mutable earth sign Virgo, symbolized by the Maiden, your little one is thoughtful, detail-oriented, helpful and highly cerebral. And these traits are rooted in the fact that Virgo is one of two signs ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, technology and transportation. (The other is Gemini.)\n\nThanks to Mercury, your little Maiden has a buzzing, information-gathering mind from the time she's tiny, taking in even the most minute specifics of any given situation. She's also quite intuitive, picking up on differences in the tone of your voice or shifts in your mood.\n\nAs she gets older, she’ll want to channel all of this intel into being helpful to you and others. Nothing makes a Virgoan toddler light up like knowing she's learned something that is useful to someone she cares about.\n\nFor example, she’ll take pride in knowing that brushing her own teeth gives you more time to get her younger sibling ready in the morning. And given her innate knack for organization, she’ll be enthusiastic about bonding with you by helping tackle tidying tasks around the house.\n\nMercury’s influence is also responsible for Virgo’s love of language, reading, learning and research (which could initially come in the form of asking a bevy of curious questions — yes, even more than the average tyke). She has the potential to become a real bookworm, so prioritizing storytime together will benefit her intellectually — and emotionally, because she’ll adore engaging in this beloved activity one-on-one.\n\nWith time, little Virgos may find that telling their own stories, ultimately writing or journaling for themselves, proves joyful and even therapeutic.\n\nAs one of the mutable signs, Virgo is innately adaptable, flexible and capable of going with the flow. Sure, she might be particular about certain aspects of a game plan (perhaps she’ll fuss if you’re feeding her in a certain position or she's wearing a stiff or scratchy fabric to a formal party), but for the most part, she's up for following your lead.\n\nAt the same time, the drawback of mutability is that your tiny Maiden can struggle with indecision — usually because she worries she’ll make the “wrong” choice. Empowering her to trust herself, her inner voice and her ability to apply all the logical information she's gathered toward an informed decision can go a long way.\n\nAs the sign associated with the Sixth House of Wellness and Daily Routine, even small Virgos want to learn how to care for their minds and bodies on a regular basis. Because her analytical and at times worried nature can throw her off-kilter, age-appropriate stress management techniques (like breathing exercises or kid yoga) can be invaluable.\n\nShe also has a natural appreciation for all the seemingly minor to-do's that make up a daily schedule, so it’ll be easy — and fun! — to involve her in chores like gardening or grocery shopping.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Virgo: Your Virgo moon kid finds comfort in connecting with you in an intellectual way and being praised for her helpfulness. She might struggle to differentiate what her heart is telling her as opposed to her head, so you’ll do well to foster this skill from the time she's tiny by asking her both “How do you feel?” as well as “What do you think?”\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Virgo: Your mini Maiden rising appears communicative, pragmatic and interested in pitching in to help friends and loved ones whenever possible.\n\nLibra Baby (September 23-October 22)\n\nIf your little one was born under the cardinal air sign Libra, symbolized by the Scales, she's a peace-loving and balance-seeking social butterfly with a great appreciation for all of the aesthetically appealing aspects of life, such as art. That’s because Libra is one of two signs ruled by Venus, the planet of relationships, values and beauty. (The other is Taurus.)\n\nGiven their Venusian rulership, little Libras are bound to be some of the most people-oriented tykes out there. They’ll absolutely light up when they’re around groups of people, whether at their baby swim class or a family reunion.\n\nBecause she's a budding host, she’ll be particularly thrilled by any opportunity to meet and greet people in your social circle on a festive occasion (think: a neighborhood picnic for the Fourth of July or her first birthday party).\n\nVenus’ influence also inspires your mini Libra to express herself artistically and appreciate all forms of art from music and dance to dress-up. Early on, your Scales tot may show a preference for picking out her own stylish outfit or arranging a pretty bouquet from flowers in the garden.\n\nOne of your Libra baby’s most distinct characteristics is her loathing of conflict and preference for tranquility at all costs. A raised voice, cross facial expression, or any other kind of discord could spur fussiness, whereas your Libra will be over-the-moon blissful in moments she senses that everyone’s getting along.\n\nAs Libra grows, this need for harmony can manifest in passive-aggressive behavior, because your Scales kid doesn’t want to rock the boat but, like any child, will experience irritation or anger. Making a point to teach her that it’s okay to experience a range of emotions can preempt stress.\n\nAs one of the cardinal signs, your tiny Libra will actively dive into any activity or pastime she's set her sights on — and you can pretty much guarantee that anything she's drawn to will be super social. From the first day at day care, she'll have plenty of playmates.\n\nHowever, it bears noting that Libra is the sign associated with the Seventh House of Partnership, which involves one-on-one bonding. So your little Libra will be inclined to pair up and forge a tight, special bond with a bestie. Her nearest and dearest loved ones are also her besties, of course, so prioritizing special quality time is sure to make a Scales child’s heart sing.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Libra: Your Libra moon baby will value and feel nurtured by time spent partnering up with you, a sibling or a dear friend and bonding.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Libra: Your mini Libra rising appears stylish, peace-seeking and eager to make the world around her as beautiful as can be.\n\nScorpio Baby (October 23-November 21)\n\nBorn under the fixed water sign Scorpio, symbolized by the Scorpion, your little one is intuitive, magnetic, emotionally intelligent, fearless, super perceptive, and a big fan of family traditions and bonding with loved ones. These traits are owed to Scorpio’s ruling planets (yes, there are two!): their traditional ruler, Mars — the planet of action and energy — and their modern ruler, Pluto — the planet of transformation, control, and power.\n\nPluto, in particular, is the planet that encourages us to look beneath the surface and shed light on aspects of life that we might not notice or discuss every day, like deep-rooted emotions.\n\nThat said, Pluto’s influence on your baby Scorp translates into a child who loves investigating just about anything and everything. She’ll be a lifelong fan of solving all kinds of puzzles or reading books with flaps that flip up to reveal hidden information or pictures. And when picking out books for your Scorpio, consider themes that involve getting to the root of a mystery.\n\nTake note that even if your little Scorpion is quiet — which she may often tend to be, given that she's very particular about when and how she expresses herself — she's still usually in observation mode. And you’ll want to proceed with caution when nudging a Scorp toddler to open up about her thoughts and feelings before she's ready, as she’ll prefer to share on her own watch.\n\nBecause she's also influenced by Mars, the go-getter planet, your Scorpio is a natural-born leader who will adore any opportunity to be “in charge.” So as she grows, allow her to call the shots on a rainy day activity or empower her to be your chief helper while caring for a younger sibling.\n\nOne of the fixed bunch, Scorpios can be quite strong-willed and attached to specific lovies, environments and routines. For example, once she's set her heart on a certain lullaby she enjoys hearing or you’ve kept her nursery lighting at a particular level, diversions from the norm could set off a thunderstorm-level tantrum.\n\nAt the same time, her fixed energy means she's incredibly loyal and devoted to loved ones and will put her whole heart and soul into any undertaking she's committed to, whether that’s playing a game or being potty trained.\n\nAssociated with the Eighth House of Close Bonds, Scorpios — even the tiniest ones! — are naturals at nurturing meaningful emotional connections. And you might be surprised that she's aware of and maybe even wants to talk about complex feelings like heartache as early as toddlerhood.\n\nYour baby Scorpio could floor you with just how wise beyond her years she is, especially when it comes to tapping into and showing compassion for an array of her own and other people’s emotions.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Scorpio: Your Scorpio moon baby feels intensely and wants to know that her nearest and dearest are on the same page. She is also adept at reading the emotional tone of any situation, so try to be straightforward with her — in an age-appropriate way, of course.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Scorpio: Your mini Scorpio rising appears magnetic, intently focused on her aspirations, and likely also a bit mysterious.\n\nSagittarius Baby (November 22-December 21)\n\nYour little one, born under the mutable fire sign Sagittarius, is known for being buoyant, free-spirited, truth-seeking, courageous, knowledge-seeking, and unfiltered. Symbolized by the Archer, a mythical creature that’s half human, half horse, Sag’s joie de vivre and appetite for adventure are owed to the ruling planet Jupiter, which in astrology oversees fortune, abundance, expansion and philosophy.\n\nYou’ll find that from early on, your bouncy, curious little Archer is eager to see as much of the world as possible, whether you’ve planned a playdate with friends who live in a neighboring town or decide to jetset to another place. While some kids might relish reliable routines, your Sag thrives on horizon-broadening experiences.\n\nIn fact, if you’re in a groove with heading to the same park day after day or offering her the same couple of flavors of purees, she might get agitated. Any opportunity to learn and grow, to spread her wings or run free in a big open space, feels positively in line with her sense of self.\n\nSimilarly, as your Archer enters toddlerhood, she’ll be eager to strike out on her own, making big, bold choices, like picking super colorful shoes or saying that she loves a certain song.\n\nAs a mutable sign, your tiny Sag is generally pretty adaptable and flexible, so shifting gears once you’ve established a set game plan is something she’ll welcome, even if that’s a new sleep schedule or dinner routine. A surefire way to get her on board right off the bat: Explain that there’s more adventure or a greater learning opportunity to be found in Plan B.\n\nAnd as the sign associated with the Ninth House of Higher Learning and Adventure, your Sag can’t help but crave more knowledge and new skill sets.\n\nBecause she's inclined to see the world through an optimistic, open-minded lens, you likely won’t have to talk her into trying a vast range of educational and experiential pastimes, from visiting a natural history museum to trying a sport. (As the Archer, she might be particularly fond of visiting a petting zoo to see horses, or, as she gets older, taking horseback riding lessons!)\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Sagittarius: Your Sag moon baby’s sense of security is bolstered by the feeling that she can express what’s in her heart openly and boldly. Enjoying eye-opening experiences with you also help her feel nurtured and loved.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Sagittarius: Your mini Sag rising comes off as lively, joyful, wide-eyed and fired up to experience everything the world has to offer.\n\nCapricorn Baby (December 22-January 19)\n\nYour little one, born under the cardinal earth sign Capricorn, symbolized by the Sea Goat, is pragmatic, industrious, wise, precocious and goal-oriented. These characteristics stem from Capricorn’s ruler, Saturn, the planet of hard work and structure. And because Saturn informs Capricorn’s nature, your baby Sea Goat can come off as quite serious and exuding an impressive work ethic, even from the time she's little.\n\nBecause Saturn rules age, wisdom and maturity, your tiny Capricorn is also an old soul who you might see gravitate to her grandparents and elders more than other kids in the family. She will likely be excited by family photo albums or reading picture books that teach her about particular periods in history.\n\nAs your baby Capricorn moves into toddlerhood, you could be surprised just how quick she is to help you with chores around the house, because she likes to “take care of business.” And any game plan that requires various steps and planning ahead is likely to be of interest to your tiny Sea Goat.\n\nFor example, if an older sibling is getting ready to go back to school, she might like to help with picking out and organizing supplies. Or if you’re having friends over for a holiday party, discuss all the beloved traditions with your Capricorn, who will love pitching in to get all the details in order.\n\nAs one of the cardinal signs, your mini Sea Goat won't have to be nudged to take the initiative. She's quite ambitious and, in her determined, down-to-earth way, she'll move slowly but steadily toward any goal, whether that’s learning how to walk or identifying colors or letters.\n\nAnd while she's not quite spotlight-loving like a little Leo, for instance, she does appreciate recognition and will relish a round of applause and cheering when she's hit a milestone.\n\nAssociated with the Tenth House of Career and Public Image, your Capricorn is interested in making her mark — specifically, earning recognition for a job well-done. In other words, as a toddler, she’ll be particularly motivated by sticker charts that show her accomplishments over time and result in a grand prize once she's proven herself capable of putting in the work.\n\nEven small Caps also have a desire to command respect, so if she makes a mistake or has an accident (like spilling her juice), she might fear she's come off as silly. She’ll benefit from hearing that everyone makes mistakes from time to time — and that those are learning opportunities.\n\nKeep in mind that you’re raising a potential future CEO or entrepreneur, so try to empower your Capricorn by praising and fostering her leadership abilities — as well as reminding her of the value of downtime and fun.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Capricorn: Your Cap moon baby feels nurtured when you’re moving through life with her in a practical, grounded way. For example, introducing her to a healthy new treat (like a different kind of apple) or involving her in a backyard harvesting project will make her light up.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Capricorn: Your mini Cap rising comes off as capable, serious and motivated to tackle any challenge she's been presented with one step at a time. She’ll appear mature and “grown-up.”\n\nAquarius Baby (January 20-February 18)\n\nBorn under the fixed air sign Aquarius, symbolized by the Water Bearer, your little one is friendly, group-oriented, tech-savvy, innovative, humanitarian, a bit contrarian (even more than your average tot!), and dedicated to striking out on her own, rejecting convention at every turn.\n\nThese traits are rooted in Aquarius’ ruling planets: Uranus, the sign’s modern ruler, which oversees electricity, rebellion, revolution, and scientific genius; and Saturn, the sign’s traditional ruler, which oversees hard work, boundaries, and structure. Given Uranus’ influence, your mini Water Bearer is a free spirit who will rarely be convinced to do something because “everyone else is.”\n\nAt the same time, Aquarius is the sign associated with the Eleventh House of Friends, so she's a big fan of hitting it off with all different kinds of people — from buddies she makes in music class to your BFF’s kids who are a few years older. She's capable of mixing and mingling with just about anyone, and spending time as part of a group or team is especially fun to a little Water Bearer, as she loves to feel connected and thrives when functioning as part of a community.\n\nShe also adores diving into activities or playing with toys and games that allow her to experiment, make discoveries and innovate, so she could very well be particularly drawn to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts.\n\nAs open and future-minded as Aquarius is, she's also the fixed air sign, so once she's zeroed in on an activity or game plan she likes, she might find it more challenging than other kids to change course midstream.\n\nHowever, her fixed nature means she's capable of really committing to an approach and seeing it through, whether she's creating her own organizational system for her toys or working her way through a big book of age-appropriate science experiments.\n\nShe might also exhibit stubbornness — but also a flair for the unique and eccentric — by insisting on doing something out of the norm over and over again, like wearing mismatched socks or insisting on an eye-catching, unconventional hairdo. Supporting her desire to express her distinct sense of self will go far in helping her feel seen.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Aquarius: Your Aquarius moon baby feels most secure when she's given plenty of opportunity to act independently. She also thrives when she feels like you’re applauding her appetite for marching to the beat of her own drum.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Aquarius: Your mini Aquarius rising comes off as super friendly, inventive and perhaps a bit daring. From day care and beyond, she’ll find it easy to connect with a wide variety of personalities.\n\nPisces Baby (February 19-March 20)\n\nYour little one, born under the mutable water sign Pisces, symbolized by the Fish, is deeply empathic, heartfelt, sensitive, emotional, and in tune with the mystical side of life. In fact, she might even be a bit psychic. These traits are owed to the fact that Pisces’ modern ruler is Neptune, the planet of spirituality and dreams, and their traditional ruler is Jupiter, the planet of abundance, miracles, growth and expansion.\n\nFrom the start, your little Fish will prove herself to be wildly imaginative, perceptive and intuitive. One of her superpowers is the ability to pick up on the emotional energy of any conversation or situation.\n\nJust be aware that one of Pisces’ challenges, especially as a little one, will be to differentiate between other people’s feelings and her own. It’s a case for working with her on recognizing and exploring her own emotions (both big and small) and understanding the difference between empathy and sympathy from an early age.\n\nShe’ll also light up when she feels like you’re connecting with her in a calm, heartfelt way, whether by humming her a gentle tune at naptime, offering lots of “I love you's,\" or spending quality time together in or near a body of water — be that a community pool or the bathtub. As a sensitive water sign, an upset or fussy Fish will definitely be soothed by hydrotherapy, so splashing in the tub or pool is definitely a fast track to peace and calm with your baby Pisces!\n\nOnce your Pisces enters toddlerhood, be sure to lean on her Neptunian influence and encourage her to tap into her active imagination by channeling emotions into artistic outlets like drawing or putting on a play.\n\nAs the mutable water sign, your Pisces is highly adaptable and capable of trying new approaches or routines; you’ll just want to be tuned into her emotional state before suggesting that you check out uncharted terrain together. In moments when she's feeling particularly tenderhearted and vulnerable, she might need a little more hand-holding than more audacious kids.\n\nShe might also struggle with making up her mind and, as the sign associated with the Twelfth House of Spirituality, tends to get a little bit lost in the clouds. Instead, she prefers to get carried away by dreams versus focusing on any rational action plans, like learning how to help you feed the family pet or picking a location for tomorrow’s playdate. In turn, you might find it’s effective to gently nudge her back to reality and look for creative ways to keep her engaged.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s moon sign is Pisces: Your Pisces moon baby is highly intuitive and connected to the mystical, emotional side of life. She feels nurtured when you hold space for her to work through challenging feelings and explore her daydreams.\n\nWhat it means if your baby’s rising sign/ascendant is Pisces: Your mini Pisces rising appears artistic, big-hearted, and flexible. She can find it tough to make up her mind, because she tends to be more connected to her inner dream world than rational thought.\n\nThe bottom line on your baby’s zodiac sign and personality\n\nNo matter how many tried-and-true tips you pick up from friends or books, you’ll undoubtedly find that parenting requires a lot of going with the flow and learning along the way. Given all the joyful moments and challenges you’re bound to encounter throughout this non-stop adventure, consider adding astrology to your parenting toolbox!\n\nAfter all, one quick glimpse at an astrological birth chart makes it clear that your baby is unique, with a perspective all her own from the time she's born. By tapping into the power of your child’s distinct natal astrology, you may well feel more empowered and prepared to hold space for her to grow into the person she's meant to be."
