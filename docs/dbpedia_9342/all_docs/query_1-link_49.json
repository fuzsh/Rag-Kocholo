        "text": "What is cerebral palsy?\n\nCerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological condition that can present as issues with muscle tone, posture and/or a movement disorder. It’s the result of damage to your brain during fetal development or another developmental disability that affects the way your brain develops. The signs and symptoms of CP appear early in childhood and can vary widely from person to person.\n\nThe main effect of CP is that it disrupts control of muscle movement (conditions that do this are known as movement disorders). It may also affect nearby brain areas and the abilities they control, but that isn’t always the case. Having CP doesn’t automatically cause someone to have an intellectual disability.\n\nTypes of cerebral palsy\n\nThere are three main types of CP:\n\nSpastic: This type involves muscle tightness and spasms.\n\nDyskinetic: This type involves issues with muscle control.\n\nMixed: This type involves features of both the spastic and dyskinetic types.\n\nExperts also organize subtypes of CP by patterns based on what part of your body they mainly affect. Those patterns are:\n\nDiplegic, which affects your arms more than your legs.\n\nQuadriplegic, which affects all your limbs.\n\nHemiplegic, which affects one side of your body (left or right) more than the other.\n\nMonoplegic, which affects one limb.\n\nParaplegic, which affects your legs.\n\nHow common is cerebral palsy?\n\nCP is uncommon overall. Between 5,500 and 13,100 children in the United States are born with it each year. Research indicates that as of 2019, more than 1 million adults in the U.S. are living with cerebral palsy, and experts also expect that number will keep growing.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of cerebral palsy?\n\nCerebral palsy can have several different signs and symptoms. Some affect movement, while others affect certain body parts, appearance and behavior.\n\nSome examples of nonmovement signs and symptoms include:\n\nHead size differences: These can include an unusually small head (microcephaly) or an unusually large head (macrocephaly).\n\nIrritability: Babies with CP may seem fussy or irritable frequently.\n\nLack of interaction: Babies and children with CP may not react to people around them.\n\nHypotonia: This means a lack of muscle tone, giving affected body parts a “floppy” appearance (this usually happens early on and later becomes spasticity or dystonia).\n\nDelayed development: Children with CP often have delays in reaching some expected developmental milestones. Many of these involve movement but can involve other abilities, too.\n\nSome examples of movement symptoms related to cerebral palsy include:\n\nStiffness in your arms and legs that makes them hard to bend or use (spasticity).\n\nUncoordinated movements.\n\nMovements that look like they’re slow and writhing or twisting.\n\nMovements that look like you’re flinging or throwing or fidgeting or dancing.\n\nSpasms or contractions might cause you to hold an uncomfortable or painful pose (dystonia).\n\nWhat causes cerebral palsy?\n\nCerebral palsy happens because of damage to parts of your brain that control movement. The damage might not affect just this section, which can cause other problems. And these kinds of damage can often have multiple causes or factors contributing to them.\n\nThis damage can happen at different times, including before, during and after birth. Damage before birth makes up about 80% of the causes. After birth, it makes up about 10% of causes.\n\nCauses before and during birth\n\nExamples of the causes include:\n\nPreterm (premature) birth.\n\nCongenital malformations due to disruptions in fetal brain development.\n\nInfections in the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord).\n\nStrokes that affect the developing brain.\n\nGenetic issues affecting fetal development.\n\nLack of blood flow or oxygen to the fetal brain.\n\nKernicterus (brain damage from toxic buildup of bilirubin, a chemical made in your liver).\n\nMeconium aspiration.\n\nNewborn hypoglycemia.\n\nCauses after birth\n\nBabies can develop CP after birth due to other events. These are often injury-related, but there are other possible causes, too, including:\n\nAccidental injuries.\n\nPhysical abuse.\n\nAsphyxiation.\n\nInfection, strokes or bleeding in and around their brain.\n\nJaundice and kernicterus.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for cerebral palsy?\n\nThere are certain circumstances or factors that can contribute to cerebral palsy or make it more likely to happen. They include:\n\nPremature birth (babies born before 28 weeks of gestation have the highest risk overall).\n\nLow birth weight (under 3.3 pounds, or 1.5 kilograms).\n\nSubstance use by a pregnant person.\n\nConditions affecting the pregnancy, such as preeclampsia.\n\nMultiple fetuses (twins, triplets, etc.).\n\nInfections affecting the placenta or amniotic fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the complications of cerebral palsy?\n\nCerebral palsy often happens simultaneously with other conditions that affect brain function. These other conditions may happen because of the same damage that caused CP.\n\nExamples of conditions that often happen alongside or because of CP include:\n\nSeizures and epilepsy.\n\nIntellectual disability.\n\nConditions that affect your ability to communicate.\n\nVision and hearing problems.\n\nBone and muscle conditions.\n\nFeeding issues.\n\nBehavior disorders.\n\nHow is cerebral palsy diagnosed?\n\nA healthcare provider can diagnose cerebral palsy using a combination of methods and tools. The earliest signs of CP are usually things most people wouldn’t know to look for. But a trained healthcare provider can often catch these during your baby’s regular checkups with their pediatrician.\n\nA provider may suspect CP before your baby reaches 12 months old, but will often hold off on making the official diagnosis until your baby is between 18 and 24 months old. A provider can diagnose CP using a physical and neurological exam, specialized assessment checklists, and imaging scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If your baby has other symptoms, they may need other tests, too. Your baby’s provider can tell you what tests they recommend and why these are necessary.\n\nHow long does cerebral palsy last?\n\nCerebral palsy can begin before, during or just after birth. It’s a permanent, lifelong condition.\n\nWhat’s the outlook for cerebral palsy?\n\nThe outlook for cerebral palsy can vary widely depending on its severity. When CP is more severe, the outlook is less positive and tends to have a reduced life expectancy. The more severe it is, the greater the reduction.\n\nAt the same time, advances in medical care, supportive treatments and technological innovations are changing the landscape for people with CP. That means people with CP, even moderate or severe cases, are living longer. Because of these shifts in life expectancy and the many variables that can contribute to it, your healthcare provider ( and/or your child’s provider) is the best person to tell you about life expectancy and what can affect that estimate.\n\nHow do I take care of myself?\n\nIf you have CP, many factors can affect how you care for yourself. If you have minor or moderate CP, you’re more likely to be able to care for yourself to some extent. If you have moderate to severe CP, you may have limited ability to care for yourself, and it’s more likely that you’ll need lifelong support or care.\n\nCP is a very variable condition, and it looks different from one person to the next. Because of that, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what you can do to care for yourself (or a child you care for). Their guidance will be the most relevant to your particular circumstances.\n\nWhat questions should I ask my healthcare provider?\n\nIf your child has CP, some questions you might want to ask include:\n\nHow severe is the damage?\n\nWhat abilities does it affect?\n\nAre there any other conditions that are happening along with or because of my child’s CP?\n\nWhat kind of treatments can help my child in the near future?\n\nWhat kind of supportive services, assistive technology or other interventions might my child need?\n\nWhat kind of symptoms should I watch for that indicate serious or dangerous problems?\n\nIf you’re an adult with CP, you may want to ask your provider the following:\n\nWhat symptoms should I watch for as I age that could indicate an issue?\n\nWhat kind of preventive care do I need specific to my CP?\n\nAre there any new treatments or support interventions that might help improve my life?\n\nDoes cerebral palsy always affect intelligence?\n\nNo, cerebral palsy doesn’t always affect intelligence. In fact, about half of all people with CP have no disruptions in their cognitive abilities. That means it doesn’t affect their intelligence at all. Many people with CP have disruptions in how they communicate, but that isn’t the same as an intellectual disability.\n\nIs cerebral palsy genetic?\n\nCerebral palsy may have contributing genetic factors, but that isn’t always the case. Some people with no genetic factors or family history of CP may still develop it from an injury or other event in early infancy.\n\nCan a person with cerebral palsy walk?\n\nSome people with CP may be able to walk without help. Others may need to use support items like crutches, a walker or a cane. Others may use assistive devices like a wheelchair. It varies widely. Some people with CP may be able to walk at times, but fatigue or other temporary symptoms might mean they need to switch to using crutches or a wheelchair.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nIf you have a child diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP), you may wonder if you’re to blame. CP happens unpredictably, and it’s usually because of a combination of factors. While CP is a serious condition and frequently causes disabilities, advances in modern medicine mean there are new treatments that can help with the symptoms and effects. And advances in assistive technology can help people with CP live longer, fuller lives.\n\nIf your child has CP, your child’s pediatrician can help you understand the condition and offer guidance and support. They can also help you find resources that can contribute to your child’s health and well-being. And if you’re an adult with CP, don’t be afraid to talk to your healthcare provider about any challenges you’re experiencing. They may know of new treatments, technologies or services that might help you."
