        "text": "Study Connection celebrates its 36th year of connecting with students at the Annual Celebration and Recognition Breakfast on Thursday, Aug. 22. The event honors tutors and students for their dedication and accomplishments during the 2023-2024 school year.\n\nThe celebration will feature keynote speaker Angela Cervantes, Mexican American author of popular children's novels like Lety Out Loud. Cervantes is the daughter of a retired teacher who instilled in her a love of reading and storytelling. As keynote speaker at the annual Study Connection breakfast, Cervantes kicks off a new year of tutoring Fort Wayne Community Schools students throughout the community.\n\nThe breakfast also honors those who have given their time to improve students’ lives. The 2024 Mike McClelland Outstanding Volunteer is Mary Smith, who volunteered with students from Shambaugh Elementary School and is the site coordinator at Bethany United Methodist Church; Price Elementary student Grace Velez and Northcrest Elementary student Gracelyn Walls are the 2024 Don Wolf Outstanding Students; and Jesse Olden, case manager at Waynedale Elementary School, was named the 2024 Connie Dickey Outstanding FWCS Colleague.\n\nStudy Connection began in 1989, founded by Don Wolf, retired CEO and president emeritus of Do it Best Corp. Volunteers are matched one-to-one with FWCS students who need academic assistance. Students and volunteers meet weekly after school for one hour during the school year. This gives students a chance to receive extra homework help, meet a mentor in the community and learn about local career opportunities.To get involved with or learn more about Study Connection, call 467-8811 or email communityprograms@fwcs.k12.in.us.\n\nThe new school year is almost here, and Fort Wayne Community Schools is kicking it off with a big celebration.\n\nCome out and enjoy a morning filled with fun activities, music and more at the FWCS Back-to-School Block Party from 9 a.m.-noon Saturday, Aug. 3, in the Bill C. Anthis Center parking lot, 1200 S. Barr St.\n\nThe free event will feature more than 70 booths highlighting FWCS departments and community partners. The block party includes:\n\n· Giveaways (while supplies last)\n\n· Free snacks (while supplies last)\n\n· Music\n\n· Free haircut coupons\n\n· Free face painting\n\n· Free immunizations\n\n· Much more!\n\nSeveral local colleges and universities, Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation Community Youth Centers, Boys & Girls Club, YMCA, Big Brother Big Sisters, Fort Wayne Area PTA Council, Allen County Public Library and many other community organizations will be present.\n\nThe 2024-25 school year begins Thursday, Aug. 8.\n\nThe Back-to-School Block Party is sponsored by CareSource and Sodexo.\n\nFort Wayne Community Schools is excited to offer students entering kindergarten, sixth, and ninth grades a sneak peek of their upcoming school year and reduce first-day of school anxieties. These transition events are designed to familiarize students with their new school environments. They will learn school rules, find their lockers and walk through their schedules.\n\nTransition Day for new middle schoolers and high school freshmen will take place from 8 a.m.-noon, Tuesday, July 30, at their respective schools. Blackhawk Middle School will host Transition Day from 5:30-6:30 p.m., Tuesday, August 6. Sixth graders will have the opportunity to experience their new school environment, meet teachers and administrators and begin building relationships. Ninth graders will have those same experiences, along with an introduction to the Freshman Schools of Success powered by 3DE.\n\nNew in the 2024-25 school year, the Freshman Schools of Success program connects core academic learning with real world business experiences, developing essential skills, such as collaboration, communication, creativity and critical thinking. Freshmen will also participate in the Freshman Seminar course to explore their interests, helping them choose their School of Success and pathway.\n\nParents will also have a meeting with the high school principals at 8 a.m. on Transition Day to learn how they can support their children as they enter high school.\n\nKindergarten students will attend Kindergarten Conferences on August 2, where they will meet with their teachers at individually assigned times throughout the day. Engaging parents in these activities helps alleviate their concerns and supports their involvement in their child’s education.\n\nThese transition events underscore FWCS' dedication to providing a welcoming environment for all students and their families.\n\nTeams led by community volunteers will clean, paint and spruce up the landscaping at eight Fort Wayne Community Schools buildings from 8 a.m.-noon Wednesday, July 17, as part of a special Day of Caring sponsored by United Way of Allen County.\n\nMore than 150 employees and volunteers from several local businesses and community organizations will spend the day getting the schools in shape for the new school year, which begins Thursday, Aug. 8.\n\nThe 33rd annual United Way of Allen County Day of Caring will take place Friday, Aug. 23. Because school will be in session then, FWCS and United Way partnered with local businesses to create a special summer Day of Caring to focus on school buildings.\n\nThe connections made on the Day of Caring frequently develop into lasting partnerships between businesses and schools, with employees returning to volunteer or support the schools in numerous ways throughout the year.\n\nBelow are the Day of Caring sites and the teams working at the sites:\n\n• Bill C.
