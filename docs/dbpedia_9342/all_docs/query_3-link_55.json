In our short experience as parents to 5 little ones (between our 2 families), we’ve already experienced little boys, little girls, twins, preemies, 3 under 18 months, and all sorts of labor experiences in a few hospitals. Our mission is to help parents in all that we do,",

Between the two families of Founders Lauren Levy and Lawrence Sheer, they've experienced nursing, bottle feeding, little boys, little girls, twins, preemies, 3 under 15 months, and all sorts of labor experiences in several hospitals—and they've been making innovations to getting dressed all along the way.\n\nSign up to receive emails and texts at the bottom of this page and be the first to receive exclusive access to new launches, special offers, and all things Magnetic Me.

Children's pajamas are mandated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission to meet specific dimensions that create a very snug fit, in order to adhere to fire safety guidelines. As a result, parents often find dressing their child to be a frustrating experience as they struggle to get a child's arms, legs, and stomach into the garment. Magnetic's Me RightFit™ fabric enables a looser silhouette, and when paired with the brand's signature magnetic closures, it makes meaningful progress in combating the children's industry's snug fit issue and dressing growing children hassle-free.\n\nFor standard shipping, we typically ship within 1-2 business days of purchase.

It's that easy!\n\nPlease note that all items in your shopping bag must be eligible for Installments with Afterpay. A minimum purchase amount may apply and you must meet additional eligibility requirements to qualify.\n\nFor pay-in-4 payments, generally customers are required to make their down payment at the time of purchase, with the remaining three payments deducted every two weeks from your chosen payment method.\n\nFor all Afterpay payments, you can log in to your Afterpay account to view your payment schedule and make a payment before the due date if you choose to do so.\n\nSubject to Magnetic Me's return and refund policies, if you have changed your mind, you may be able to return your Afterpay purchase for a refund.
