        "text": "Developers and Designers\n\nOur design team at the Schopfheim facility is developing the access control systems of the future. Would you like to be one of us?\n\nInnovators by tradition\n\nHighly efficient products, modular pedestrian accesses and two-component materials: our ideas guide the development of the entire sector. Join us and be part of it!\n\nThe professionals of versatility\n\nDesign, modularity, efficiency, durability, safety: our barriers and pedestrian accesses are as diverse as the markets in which we demonstrate our abilities every day. What is your skill set?\n\nCosmopolitan\n\nPeople from all over the world work in Schopfheim: our employees speak English, Italian, French, Chinese and even use almost unfathomable local dialects such as Alemannic!\n\nFlexible hours\n\nIn the morning, you can play sports or go to the town centre, in the afternoon you can take your children to the playground. All this is made possible by flexible working hours that allow you to organize your work and private life in the best possible way.\n\nActive and health conscious\n\nWe want you to remain productive and active, even outside your professional environment. This is why we offer you membership at a health centre and provide, for example, free eye tests or skin screening.\n\nSustainability\n\nIf you don't just think about tomorrow, but also about the day after tomorrow, then this is the right place for you. We protect the environment and its resources through our commitment to sustainability and our Pro Nature climate protection program.\n\nGood food lovers\n\nYou can choose to bring a snack with you, but it is not necessary: the bread delivery service is available every day. There is a basket of fruit in the office and you can order the lunch of your choice directly from your desk.\n\nTeamwork\n\nWe’re a great team, we work closely together with mutual trust - so we don’t raise our glasses just at Christmas or New Year's Eve.\n\nSustainable mobility\n\nYou can go to work on a company bike, avoiding traffic and enjoying the benefits of a breath of fresh air. Alternatively, you can explore the Wiese valley and the foothills of the southern Black Forest.\n\nCompany agreements\n\nIt is also worth working at Magnetic for the additional work benefits. Numerous company agreements mean that you can obtain highly competitive prices and discounts or go shopping in Switzerland or France.\n\nAlways active!\n\nIn our team, managers, high flyers and talented young people work together. This is why we are an official partner of SC Freiburg.\n\nSmart - even at work\n\nAt Magnetic, you can go to work in the morning or work from home. We have the right infrastructure to allow you to organize your work flexibly.\n\nSafety at work\n\nWe guarantee safety, not only for our customers, but also for our employees. By adopting specific hygiene protocols and ensuring personal distancing, we are steering our team successfully through the pandemic."
