        "text": "(2 of 3)\n\nBut the critics gave him a pasting, and he admits now that it was well-deserved. \"They wanted to hear a performer play every little note as written,\" he says ruefully. Back in Paris he devoted himself to high living, for which he had almost as much talent as for music. He shared an apartment with a French count, \"had a little carriage and was thin as a stick because I never got to bed until morning.\" One evening Composer Paul (The Sorcerer's Apprentice) Dukas found him breakfasting in a cafe and insisted that he come at once to his studio. There he presented Rubinstein with a handful of pornographic pictures. \"Why?\" asked Artur. \"Because that's the only thing you seem to be interested in these days,\" said Dukas. That slap in the face and the stern lecture that followed sent Rubinstein to the country and a milk diet. But after a short while there was another love affair (\"Terrible, terribleÂ—I had to fight a duel with the husband\"), and Rubinstein was soon thin as a stick again.\n\nNo Might-Have-Been. During World War I he worked for the Allies as translator (he speaks eight languages), was so shocked by German atrocities in Belgium that he vowed never to play in Germany again, and never has. Asked what countries he had not visited in the last 40 years, he once named Tibet, because it is too high, and Germany, because it is too low. In 1938 he returned a decoration awarded him by Mussolini with a telegram signed \"Artur Rubinstein, Jewish pianist.\"\n\nAudiences loved him, but he was squandering his talent, and he knew it. The solution for that was pretty Aniela Mlynarski, daughter of a Polish conductor with whose orchestra Rubinstein had played as a boy. He met her when she was 16, married her when she was 22 and he was 43. Within a year he was a father (of Eva, now an actress in the Broadway hit The Diary of Anne Frank), and the responsibility made a serious and disciplined musician out of him. \"I didn't want people telling my child after I died, 'What a pianist your father might have been!' \"\n\nFor the first time, Rubinstein began to practice regularly, began to explore the musical depths of the composers he had been playing with dazzling facility for so long.\n\nNot Quite, but Almost. These days Artur Rubinstein is on tour most of the time; each year he makes an extended tour of Latin America, with a stopover in Havana, where admirers keep him supplied with his own custom-made cigars.* \"At home I get no rest,\" he complains amiably. \"I must listen sweetly to my children or compliment them on something. My wife wants this or that, and there are friends to see and parties to go to. Touring is easy. I go to my hotel, and there is nothing to do but have my dinner and lie down for a while and read. Peace and quiet. Then the concert with everyone so kind, so good to me.\""
