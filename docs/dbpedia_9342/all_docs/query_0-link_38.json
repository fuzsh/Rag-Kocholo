        "text": "Our Beaches Lead the Nation in Sea Turtle Nest Density\n\nPalm Beach County's beaches are popular places for people to enjoy the sand and surf. And they are also popular places for female sea turtles to visit every year from March through October to nest. Our beaches have more sea turtle nests per mile than anywhere else in the United States producing approximately 2,000,000 hatchings each year!\n\nWhat Brings Sea Turtles Here?\n\n​Sea turtles are marine reptiles that spend their time migrating in the ocean - not an ideal place for a sea turtle hatchling to develop. Because they need air to breathe as they develop in the egg, a sandy beach makes a great incubator for sea turtle embroys. So why here in Palm Beach County? Could it be that our beaches are closest to the Gulfstream Current that migrating turtles use to navigate the ocean? The answer is...scientists have not pinpointed the exact reason some beaches are more favorable than others. But one thing is known - most nesting females return to the same beach they hatched from to nest making our beaches critical to future generations of sea turtles.\n\n​\n\nSea Turtles Are Excellent Navigators\n\nWhile many sea turtles like juvenile greens, can be found swimming in our coastal waters and inshore lagoons like Lake Worth Lagoon estuary, most have migrated thousands of miles through the open ocean to reach our beaches to nest. So how do females know how to get back to the same beach they were born at after swimming for years in the ocean during which time the shoreline changes due to erosion, development, and natural sand drift? By using the Earth's magnetic field and a magnetic mineral found in their brains, they literally have an internal compass that allows them to sense where they are on Earth!\n\nSea Turtles Have Poor Vision On Land\n\nThis makes it difficult for them to crawl around objects on the beach and they are unable to go backwards. Many times, they return to the sea without nesting if an obstacle is encountered.\n\nFor this reason, it is very important to keep our beaches free of debris and potential obstacles.\n\nBEFORE YOU LEAVE THE BEACH\n\nFill in holes dug in the sand\n\nKnock down sand castles\n\nRemove beach chairs, toys, & other equipment\n\nSea Turtles Dig The Dark\n\nArtificial lighting has been linked to hatchlings becoming \"disorientated\" where they crawl toward the artificial light instead of the natural light of the horizon. The picture above shows how lights along the coast from buildings and even miles inland (sky glow) can disorient hatchlings guiding them away from the ocean.\n\nKEEP LIGHTS OFF THE BEACH\n\nMarch 1st - October 31st\n\nTurn off coastal lights (even flashlights and phones) while on the beach at night.\n\nIf you live inland, turn off lights when not needed - your light is called sky glow and it can travel for miles.\n\nYOU Can Help\n\nDo not disturb sea turtles, nests, or eggs - it's the law!\n\nIf you encounter a nesting turtle, keep lights off, remain still, and keep your distance.\n\nBe careful at the beach, not all nests are marked and eggs are only 1 - 3 feet below the surface.\n\nDo not disturb nest markers - organizations monitor sea turtles.\n\nReduce litter and marine debris - especially fishing line and plastic.\n\nKeep pets away from nesting females, nests, and hatchlings.\n\nBe mindful on the water, sea turtles swim offshore and inshore waters all year long, frequently surfacing to breathe and thus are susceptable to boat strikes.\n\nReport all dead, injured, or stranded sea turtles or harassment of adults, hatchlings, or nests to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at 1-888-404-FWCC (3922).\n\nGo on an approved sea turtle walk with a licensed guide:\n\nGumbo Limbo Nature Center, (Boca Raton)\n\nMacArthur Beach State Park, (North Palm Beach)\n\nLoggerhead Marinelife Center, (Juno Beach)\n\nPBC ERM**\n\n**Link goes to email notification list OR follow us @pbcerm for walk times"
