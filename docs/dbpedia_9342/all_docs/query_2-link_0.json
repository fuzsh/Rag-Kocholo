        "text": "Veteran actor and director Robert Selden Duvall was born on January 5, 1931, in San Diego, CA, to Mildred Virginia (Hart), an amateur actress, and William Howard Duvall, a career military officer who later became an admiral. Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I. Bill in 1955, studying under Sanford Meisner along with Dustin Hoffman, with whom Duvall shared an apartment. Both were close to another struggling young actor named Gene Hackman. Meisner cast Duvall in the play \"The Midnight Caller\" by Horton Foote, a link that would prove critical to his career, as it was Foote who recommended Duvall to play the mentally disabled \"Boo Radley\" in Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962). This was his first \"major\" role since his 1956 motion picture debut as an MP in Die Hölle ist in mir (1956), starring Paul Newman.\n\nDuvall began making a name for himself as a stage actor in New York, winning an Obie Award in 1965 playing incest-minded longshoreman \"Eddie Carbone\" in the off-Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge\", a production for which his old roommate Hoffman was assistant director. He found steady work in episodic TV and appeared as a modestly billed character actor in films, such as Arthur Penn's Ein Mann wird Gejagt (1966) with Marlon Brando and in Robert Altman's Countdown - Start zum Mond (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola's Liebe niemals einen Fremden (1969), in both of which he co-starred with James Caan.\n\nHe was also memorable as the heavy who is shot by John Wayne at the climax of Der Marshal (1969) and was the first \"Maj. Frank Burns\", creating the character in Altman's Korean War comedy M*A*S*H (1970). He also appeared as the eponymous lead in George Lucas' directorial debut, THX 1138 (1971). It was Francis Ford Coppola, casting Der Pate (1972), who reunited Duvall with Brando and Caan and provided him with his career breakthrough as mob lawyer \"Tom Hagen\". He received the first of his six Academy Award nominations for the role.\n\nThereafter, Duvall had steady work in featured roles in such films as Der Pate 2 (1974), Die Killer-Elite (1975), Network (1976), Kein Koks für Sherlock Holmes (1976) and Der Adler ist gelandet (1976). Occasionally this actor's actor got the chance to assay a lead role, most notably in Heute und morgen und in alle Ewigkeit (1972), in which he was brilliant as William Faulkner's inarticulate backwoods farmer. He was less impressive as the lead in Wie ein Panther in der Nacht (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective Eddie Egan, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as \"Popeye Doyle\" in French Connection - Brennpunkt Brooklyn (1971).\n\nIt was his appearance as \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in another Coppola picture, Apocalypse Now (1979), that solidified Duvall's reputation as a great actor. He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\"\n\nSubsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in Der große Santini (1979) and Comeback der Liebe (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled \"Oscar curse\" that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners Luise Rainer, Rod Steiger and Cliff Robertson. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in Der Pate 3 (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of Al Pacino, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone.\n\nHis greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series Der Ruf des Adlers (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He received a second Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Stalin (1992), and a third Emmy nomination playing Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Der Mann, der Eichmann jagte (1996).\n\nThe shakeout of his career doldrums was that Duvall eventually settled back into his status as one of the premier character actors in the industry, rivaled only by his old friend Gene Hackman. Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary We're Not the Jet Set (1974), Angelo My Love (1983) and Killing Moves (2002). As a writer-director, Duvall gave himself one of his most memorable roles, that of the preacher on the run from the law in Apostel! (1997), a brilliant performance for which he received his third Best Actor nomination and fifth Oscar nomination overall. The film brought Duvall back to the front ranks of great actors, and was followed by a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod for Zivilprozeß (1998).\n\nRobert Duvall will long be remembered as one of the great naturalistic American screen actors in the mode of Spencer Tracy and his frequent co-star Marlon Brando. His performances as \"Boo Radley\" in Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962), \"Jackson Fentry\" in Heute und morgen und in alle Ewigkeit (1972), \"Tom Hagen\" in the first two \"Godfather\" movies, \"Frank Hackett\" in Network (1976), \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in Apocalypse Now (1979), \"Bull Meechum\" in Der große Santini (1979), \"Mac Sledge\" in Comeback der Liebe (1983), \"Gus McCrae\" in Der Ruf des Adlers (1989) and \"Sonny Dewey\" in Apostel! (1997) rank as some of the finest acting ever put on film. It's a body of work that few actors can equal, let alone surpass.\n\nJennifer Kate Hudson was born on September 12, 1981 in Chicago, Illinois to Darnell Donerson (née Hudson) & Samuel Simpson. She is an Academy Award-winning actress, Grammy Award-winning recording artist and best-selling author. This bright, beautiful and booming-voiced talent is a perfect example of how NOT winning the title of American Idol: The Search for a Superstar (2002) can still be a superstar boon to your career and not the disappointment of a life time.\n\nShe earned minor attention as one of the twelve finalists on the third season of the FOX TV series in 2004, but finished an underwhelming sixth runner-up. Hudson grew up singing in gospel choirs, acting in community theater productions, singing on cruise ships and touring for in Disney's \"Hercules: The Musical.\" With no formal musical training, her raw vocal power initially pleased the panel of Idol judges and she, Fantasia Barrino and La Toya London were initially promoted as the show's very own \"Dreamgirls\" and were expected to be the final three standing at the end of the competition. Surprisingly, all three were midway placed in the bottom group at one point, and Jennifer was cut from the pack. Fantasia eventually won the competition and, seemingly, all the glory and the fame.\n\nHudson appeared with the \"American Idol\" summer tour and performed on the road in concerts over the next two years. When it was time to audition for the coveted role of \"Effie Melody White\" in the long-awaited film version of the Broadway musical Dreamgirls (2006), among Jennifer's competition would be Fantasia herself. This time Jennifer was the winner and earned the right to play the coveted role. Immediately ordered to gain weight for the role, the film was loosely based on the real-life pursuits of The Supremes, with the character of Effie taking on the tragic form of the group's ill-fated co-founder Florence Ballard (1943-1976), but with a far less tragic ending.\n\nJennifer's performance became the most triumphant musical film debut since Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl (1968). Making the role her own, she delivered the same heart-breaking, gut-wrenching one-two punch that made Jennifer Holliday, who originated the role on stage, the toast of the Broadway scene in 1981. It was no easy task to outshine both Beyoncé and Eddie Murphy in one movie, but Jennifer was the movie's heart and soul and easily won over the critics. She went on to win not only the Oscar, Golden Globe, British Film, New York Film Critics and National Board of Review awards for \"Best Supporting Actress,\" she picked up nearly every film critic's award there was to be had!\n\nHudson's meteoric rise made quite an impact in the world of music with the successful release of both her Sony/Arista Records albums. Her 2008 debut, self-titled record debuted at #2 on the \"Billboard Hot 100\" and won a Grammy Award for \"Best R & B Album, and her sophomore album, \"I Remember Me,\" also debuted at #2 and went on to win three awards at the 2009 NAACP Image Awards including \"Best Album.\" Her third album, 2014's \"JHUD,\" released by RCA, was a highly successful throwback to 70's inspired R&B.\n\nContinuing to distinguish herself on the large screen, Jennifer began things off featured in the film version of Sex and the City - Der Film (2008) with Sarah Jessica Parker. She then played the concerned daughter of compulsive gambler Forest Whitaker in the drama Winged Creatures (2008); earned a NAACP Image Award nomination for her moving effort in the tender drama Die Bienenhüterin (2008); portrayed Winnie Mandela opposite Terrence Howard's Nelson in the biopic Winnie (2011); co-starred with Whitaker again and Angela Bassett in the family Christmas drama Black Nativity (2013); co-starred as an amateur singer taken in by talent agent Adam Sandler in the romantic comedy Sandy Wexler (2017); appeared as Grizabella in the film version of the hit musical Cats (2019); and was given the opportunity to play the \"Queen of Soul\" herself, Aretha Franklin, in the biopic Respect (2021). Back in 2013, she was honored, at such a young stage, with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nOn TV, Jennifer has played the recurring roles of Veronica Moore in the musical series Smash (2012) and Michelle White in the dramatic series Empire (2015). She also was given the distinction of playing and singing the role of Motormouth Maybelle in the live TV movie Hairspray Live! (2016).\n\nAs for other special live performances over the years, Jennifer was invited to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl XLVIII in Tampa, Florida on February 1, 2009. It would be her first live performance since the October 24, 2008 family tragedy of losing mother Darnell and older brother Jason in a domestic shooting incident. In January of 2013, she was asked to perform at the Obama Presidential Inaugural Ball and in 2019, was invited to sing the nominated song \"I'll Fight\" from the movie RBG - Ein Leben für die Gerechtigkeit (2018), a documentary chronicling the life and career of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nHonored at VH1's Do Something Awards for her charitable work and also the recipient of the Samsung Galaxy Impact Award at Variety's Power of Women luncheon with the Samsung Galaxy Impact Award, Jennifer, along with her sister Julia Hudson, founded The Julian D. King Gift Foundation in 2009, as a catalyst for change in children's health, education and welfare. The Foundation exists to provide stability, support and positive experiences for children of all backgrounds so that they will become productive, confident and happy adults.\n\nExpanding her talents in the arts, Hudson added author to her list of accomplishments in January 2012 with the release her New York Times best-selling memoir, \"I Got This: How I Changed My Ways, Found Myself and Lost Everything that Weighed Me Down.\"\n\nJim Carrey, Canadian-born and a U.S. citizen since 2004, is an actor and producer famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), Dumm und Dümmer (1994) and Die Maske (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.\n\nJames Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carré\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his résumé to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).\n\nCarrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.\n\nCarrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom Die Entenfabrik (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.\n\nCarrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Einmal beißen bitte (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue hat geheiratet (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Mein Liebhaber vom andern Stern (1988). Impressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).\n\nFollowing his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character's trademark was talking out his derrière). Next up was the manic superhero movie Die Maske (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could stretch.\n\nFinally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers' Dumm und Dümmer (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Forever (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ace Ventura - Jetzt wird's wild (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in Cable Guy - Die Nervensäge (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit Der Dummschwätzer (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.\n\nIn 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir's Die Truman Show (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in Der Mondmann (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo drums, which he'd used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.\n\nAn indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Ich, beide & sie (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (Renée Zellweger). Carrey's real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard's Der Grinch (2000).\n\nAlthough Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Bruce Allmächtig (2003) and Mr. Poppers Pinguine (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Vergiss mein nicht (2004) and the drama/comedy Der Ja-Sager (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in Der unglaubliche Burt Wonderstone (2013).\n\nCarrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later.\n\nHumanitarian and actor Richard Gere was born on August 31, 1949, in Philadelphia, the second of five children of Doris Anna (Tiffany), a homemaker, and Homer George Gere, an insurance salesman, both Mayflower descendants. Richard started early as a musician, playing a number of instruments in high school and writing music for high school productions. He graduated from North Syracuse Central High School in 1967, and won a gymnastics scholarship to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, where he majored in philosophy. He left college after two years to pursue acting, landing a lead role in the London production of the rock musical \"Grease\" in 1973. The following year he would be in other plays, such as \"Taming of the Shrew.\" Onscreen, he had a few roles, and gained recognition in Auf der Suche nach Mr. Goodbar (1977). Offscreen, he spent 1978 meeting Tibetans when he traveled to Nepal, where he spoke to many monks and lamas. Returning to the US, on Broadway he portrayed a concentration-camp prisoner in \"Bent,\" for which he received the 1980 Theatre World Award. Back in Hollywood, he played the title role in Ein Mann für gewisse Stunden (1980), establishing himself as a major star; this status was reaffirmed by Ein Offizier und Gentleman (1982). In the early 1980s, Richard went to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador (amidst ongoing wars and political violence); he traveled with a doctor and visited refugee camps. It is said that Richard was romantically linked with Tuesday Weld, Priscilla Presley, Barbra Streisand and Kim Basinger. In 1990 Richard teamed up with Julia Roberts to star in the blockbuster Pretty Woman (1990); his cool reserve was the perfect complement to Julia's bubbling enthusiasm. The film captured the nation's heart, and won the People's Choice award for Best Movie. Fans clamored for years for a sequel, or at least another pairing of Julia and Richard. They got that with Die Braut, die sich nicht traut (1999), which was a runaway success (Richard got $12 million, Julia made $17 million, the box office was $152 million, which shows what happens when you give the public what it wants!). Offscreen, Richard and Cindy Crawford got married December 12, 1991 (they were divorced in 1995). Afterwards, Richard started dating actress Carey Lowell. They had a son, Homer James Jigme Gere, on February 6, 2000. Richard was picked by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the world in 1991, and as their Sexiest Man Alive in 1999. He is an accomplished pianist and music writer. Above all, Richard is a humanitarian. He's a founding member of \"Tibet House,\" a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of Tibetan culture. He has been an active supporter of \"Survival International\" for several years, a worldwide organization supporting tribal peoples, affirming their right to decide their own future and helping them protect their lives, lands and human rights (these tribes are global, including the natives of the Amazon, the Maasai of East Africa, the Wichi of Argentina, and others). In 1994 Richard went to London to open Harrods' sale, donating his £50,000 appearance fee to Survival. He has been prominent in their charity advertising campaigns.\n\nHighly influential, and always controversial, African-American actor/comedian who was equally well known for his colorful language during his live comedy shows, as for his fast paced life, multiple marriages and battles with drug addiction. He has been acknowledged by many modern comic artist's as a key influence on their careers, and Pryor's observational humor on African-American life in the USA during the 1970s was razor sharp brilliance.\n\nHe was born Richard Franklin Lennox Pryor III on December 1, 1940, in Peoria, Illinois, the son of Gertrude L. (Thomas) and LeRoy \"Buck Carter\" Pryor. His mother, a prostitute, abandoned him when he was ten years of age, after which he was raised in his grandmother's brothel. Unfortunately, Pryor was molested at the age of six by a teenage neighbor, and later by a neighborhood preacher. To escape this troubled life, the young Pryor was an avid movie fan and a regular visitor to local movie theaters in Peoria. After numerous jobs, including truck driver and meat packer, the young Pryor did a stint in the US Army between 1958 & 1960 in which he performed in amateur theater shows. After he left the services in 1960, Pryor started singing in small clubs, but inadvertently found that humor was his real forte.\n\nPryor spent time in both New York & Las Vegas, honing his comic craft. However, his unconventional approach to humor sometimes made bookings difficult to come by and this eventually saw Pryor heading to Los Angeles. He first broke into films with minor roles in The Busy Body (1967) and Wild in den Straßen (1968). However, his performance as a drug addicted piano player in Lady Sings the Blues (1972), really got the attention of fans and film critics alike.\n\nHe made his first appearance with Gene Wilder in the very popular action/comedy Trans-Amerika-Express (1976), played three different characters in Wie geht's aufwärts? (1977) and portrayed real-life stock-car driver \"Wendell Scott\" in Stock Car Race - Höllenjagd auf heißen Pisten (1977). Proving he was more than just a comedian, Pryor wowed audiences as a disenchanted auto worker who is seduced into betraying his friends and easy money in the Paul Schrader working class drama Blue Collar - Kampf am Fließband (1978), also starring Yaphet Kotto and Harvey Keitel. Always a strong advocate of African-American talent, Pryor next took a key role in The Wiz - Das zauberhafte Land (1978), starring an all African-American cast, including Diana Ross and Michael Jackson, retelling the story of Das zauberhafte Land (1939). His next four screen roles were primarily cameos in Das verrückte California Hotel (1978); Muppet Movie (1979); Oh, Moses! (1980) and Dreist und gottesfürchtig (1980). However, Pryor teamed up with Gene Wilder once more for the prison comedy Zwei wahnsinnig starke Typen (1980), which did strong box office business.\n\nHis next few films were a mixed bag of material, often inhibiting Pryor's talent, with equally mixed returns at the box office. Pryor then scored second billing to Christopher Reeve in the big budget Superman III - Der stählerne Blitz (1983), and starred alongside fellow funny man John Candy in Zum Teufel mit den Kohlen (1985) before revealing his inner self in the autobiographical Jo Jo Dancer - Dein Leben ruft (1986). Again, Pryor was somewhat hampered by poor material in his following film ventures. However, he did turn up again in Die Glücksjäger (1989) with Gene Wilder, but the final product was not as sharp as their previous pairings. Pryor then partnered on-screen with two other very popular African-American comic's. The legendary Redd Foxx and 1980s comic newcomer Eddie Murphy starred with Pryor in the gangster film Harlem Nights (1989) which was also directed by Eddie Murphy. Having contracted multiple sclerosis in 1986, Pryor's remaining film appearances were primarily cameos apart from his fourth and final outing with Gene Wilder in the lukewarm Das andere Ich (1991), and his final appearance in a film production was a small role in the David Lynch road flick Lost Highway (1997).\n\nFans of this outrageous comic genius are encouraged to see his live specials Richard Pryor: Live and Smokin' (1971); the dynamic Richard Pryor: Live in Concert (1979); Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip (1982) and Richard Pryor... Here and Now (1983). In addition, The Richard Pryor Show (1977) is a must-have for any Richard Pryor fans' DVD collection.\n\nUnknown to many, Pryor was a long time advocate against animal cruelty, and he campaigned against fast food chains and circus shows to address issues of animal welfare. He was married a total of seven times, and fathered eight children.\n\nAfter long battles with ill health, Richard Pryor passed away on December 10th, 2005.\n\nRichard St John Harris was born on October 1, 1930 in Limerick, Ireland, to a farming family, one of nine children born to Mildred (Harty) and Ivan Harris. He attended Crescent College, a Jesuit school, and was an excellent rugby player, with a strong passion for literature. Unfortunately, a bout of tuberculosis as a teenager ended his aspirations to a rugby career, but he became fascinated with the theater and skipped a local dance one night to attend a performance of \"Henry IV\". He was hooked and went on to learn his craft at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), then spent several years in stage productions. He debuted on screen in Ein Händedruck des Teufels (1959) and quickly scored regular work in films, including Die den Tod nicht fürchten (1959), Aufstand im Morgengrauen (1960) and a good role as a frustrated Australian bomber pilot in Die Kanonen von Navarone (1961).\n\nHowever, his breakthrough performance was as the quintessential \"angry young man\" in the sensational drama Sporting Life (1963), which scored him an Oscar nomination. He then appeared in the WW II commando tale Kennwort 'Schweres Wasser' (1965) and in the Sam Peckinpah-directed western Sierra Charriba (1965). He next showed up in Hawaii (1966) and played King Arthur in Camelot: Am Hofe König Arthurs (1967), a lackluster adaptation of the famous Broadway play. Better performances followed, among them a role as a reluctant police informer in Verflucht bis zum jüngsten Tag (1970) alongside Sir Sean Connery. Harris took the lead role in the violent western Der Mann, den sie Pferd nannten (1970), which became something of a cult film and spawned two sequels. As the 1970s progressed, Harris continued to appear regularly on screen; however, the quality of the scripts varied from above average to woeful.\n\nHis credits during this period included directing himself as an aging soccer player in Bloomfield (1970); the western Bis zum letzten Atemzug (1973); the big-budget \"disaster\" film Achtzehn Stunden bis zur Ewigkeit (1974); the strangely-titled crime film König Ballermann (1974); with Connery again in Robin Und Marian (1976); Eine Reise nach Liliput (1977); a part in the Der weiße Hai (1975); Orca, der Killerwal (1977) and a nice turn as an ill-fated mercenary with Richard Burton and Roger Moore in the popular action film Die Wildgänse kommen (1978).\n\nThe 1980s kicked off with Harris appearing in the silly Bo Derek vanity production Tarzan, Herr der Affen (1981) and the remainder of the decade had him appearing in some very forgettable productions. However, the luck of the Irish was once again to shine on Harris's career and he scored rave reviews (and another Oscar nomination) for Das Feld (1990). He then locked horns with Harrison Ford as an IRA sympathizer in Die Stunde der Patrioten (1992) and got one of his best roles as gunfighter English Bob in the Clint Eastwood western Erbarmungslos (1992). Harris was firmly back in vogue and rewarded his fans with more wonderful performances in Walter & Frank - Ein schräges Paar (1993); Cry, the Beloved Country (1995); The Great Kandinsky (1995) and This Is the Sea (1997). Further fortune came his way with a strong performance in the blockbuster Gladiator (2000) and he became known to an entirely new generation of film fans as Albus Dumbledore in the mega-successful Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (2001) and Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens (2002). His final screen role was as \"Lucius Sulla\" in Julius Caesar (2002).\n\nHarris died of Hodgkin's disease, also known as Hodgkin's lymphoma, in London on October 25, 2002, aged 72.\n\nBruce Lee remains the greatest icon of martial arts cinema and a key figure of modern popular media. Had it not been for Bruce Lee and his movies in the early 1970s, it's arguable whether or not the martial arts film genre would have ever penetrated and influenced mainstream North American and European cinema and audiences the way it has over the past four decades. The influence of East Asian martial arts cinema can be seen today in so many other film genres including comedies, action, drama, science fiction, horror and animation... and they all have their roots in the phenomenon that was Bruce Lee.\n\nLee was born Lee Jun Fan November 27, 1940 in San Francisco, the son of Lee Hoi Chuen, a singer with the Cantonese Opera. Approximately one year later, the family returned to Kowloon in Hong Kong and at the age of five, a young Bruce begins appearing in children's roles in minor films including The Birth of Mankind (1946) and Fu gui fu yun (1948). At the age of 12, Bruce commenced attending La Salle College. Bruce was later beaten up by a street gang, which inspired him to take up martial arts training under the tutelage of Sifu Yip Man who schooled Bruce in wing chun kung fu for a period of approximately five years. This was the only formalized martial arts training ever undertaken by Lee. The talented and athletic Bruce also took up cha-cha dancing and, at age 18, won a major dance championship in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, his temper and quick fists got him in trouble with the Hong Kong police on numerous occasions. His parents suggested that he head off to the United States. Lee landed in San Francisco's Chinatown in 1959 and worked in a close relative's restaurant. He eventually made his way to Seattle, Washington, where he enrolled at university to study philosophy and found the time to practice his beloved kung fu techniques. In 1963, Lee met Linda Lee Cadwell (aka Linda Emery) (later his wife) and also opened his first kung fu school at 4750 University Way. During the early half of the 1960s, Lee became associated with many key martial arts figures in the United States, including kenpo karate expert Ed Parker and tae kwon do master Jhoon Rhee. He made guest appearances at notable martial arts events including the Long Beach Nationals. Through one of these tournaments Bruce met Hollywood hair-stylist Jay Sebring who introduced him to television producer William Dozier. Based on the runaway success of Batman (1966), Dozier was keen to bring the cartoon character the Green Hornet to television and was on the lookout for an East Asian actor to play the Green Hornet's sidekick, Kato. Around this time Bruce also opened a second kung fu school in Oakland, California and relocated to Oakland to be closer to Hollywood.\n\nBruce's screen test was successful, and Die grüne Hornisse (1966) starring Van Williams aired in 1966-1967 with mixed success. His fight scenes were sometimes obscured by unrevealing camera angles, but his dedication was such that he insisted his character behave like a perfect bodyguard, keeping his eyes on whoever might be a threat to his employer except when the script made this impossible. The show was canceled after only one season (twenty-six episodes), but by this time Lee was receiving more fan mail than the series' nominal star. He then opened a third branch of his kung fu school in Los Angeles and began providing personalized martial arts training to celebrities including film stars Steve McQueen and James Coburn as well as screenwriter Stirling Silliphant. In addition he refined his prior knowledge of wing chun and incorporated aspects of other fighting styles such as traditional boxing and Okinawan karate. He also developed his own unique style Jeet Kune Do (Way of the Intercepting Fist). Another film opportunity then came his way as he landed the small role of a stand over man named Winslow Wong who intimidates private eye James Garner in Der Dritte im Hinterhalt (1969). Wong pays a visit to Garner and proceeds to demolish the investigator's office with his fists and feet, finishing off with a spectacular high kick that shatters the light fixture. With this further exposure of his talents, Bruce then scored several guest appearances as a martial arts instructor to blind private eye James Franciscus on the television series Longstreet (1971).\n\nWith his minor success in Hollywood and money in his pocket, Bruce returned for a visit to Hong Kong and was approached by film producer Raymond Man-Wai Chow who had recently started Golden Harvest productions. Chow was keen to utilize Lee's strong popularity amongst young Chinese fans, and offered him the lead role in Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li (1971). In it, Lee plays a distant cousin coming to join relatives working at an ice house, where murder, corruption, and drug-running lead to his character's adventures and display of Kung-Fu expertise. The film was directed by Wei Lo, shot in Thailand on a very low budget and in terrible living conditions for cast and crew. However, when it opened in Hong Kong the film was an enormous hit. Chow knew he had struck box office gold with Lee and quickly assembled another script entitled Todesgrüße aus Shanghai (1972). The second film (with a slightly bigger budget) was again directed by Wei Lo and was set in Shanghai in the year 1900, with Lee returning to his school to find that his beloved master has been poisoned by the local Japanese karate school. Once again he uncovers the evildoers and sets about seeking revenge on those responsible for murdering his teacher and intimidating his school. The film features several superb fight sequences and, at the film's conclusion, Lee refuses to surrender to the Japanese police and seemingly leaps to his death in a hail of police bullets.\n\nOnce more, Hong Kong streets were jammed with thousands of fervent Chinese movie fans who could not get enough of the fearless Bruce Lee, and his second film went on to break the box office records set by the first! Lee then set up his own production company, Concord Productions, and set about guiding his film career personally by writing, directing and acting in his next film, Die Faust des Drachen (1972). A bigger budget meant better locations and opponents, with the new film set in Rome, Italy and additionally starring hapkido expert In-shik Hwang, karate legend Robert Wall and seven-time U.S. karate champion Chuck Norris. Bruce plays a seemingly simple country boy sent to assist at a cousin's restaurant in Rome and finds his cousins are being bullied by local thugs for protection.\n\nBy now, Lee's remarkable success in East Asia had come to the attention of Hollywood film executives and a script was hastily written pitching him as a secret agent penetrating an island fortress. Warner Bros. financed the film and also insisted on B-movie tough guy John Saxon starring alongside Lee to give the film wider appeal. The film culminates with another show-stopping fight sequence between Lee and the key villain, Han, in a maze of mirrors. Shooting was completed in and around Hong Kong in early 1973 and in the subsequent weeks Bruce was involved in completing overdubs and looping for the final cut. Various reports from friends and co-workers cite that he was not feeling well during this period and on July 20, 1973 he lay down at the apartment of actress Betty Ting Pei after taking a headache medicine called Equagesic and was later unable to be revived. A doctor was called and Lee was taken to hospital by ambulance and pronounced dead that evening. The official finding was death due to a cerebral edema, caused by a reaction to the headache tablet Equagesic.\n\nFans worldwide were shattered that their virile idol had passed at such a young age, and nearly thirty thousand fans filed past his coffin in Hong Kong. A second, much smaller ceremony was held in Seattle, Washington and Bruce was laid to rest at Lake View Cemetary in Seattle with pall bearers including Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Dan Inosanto. Der Mann mit der Todeskralle (1973) was later released in the mainland United States, and was a huge hit with audiences there, which then prompted National General films to actively distribute his three prior movies to U.S. theatres... each was a box office smash.\n\nFans throughout the world were still hungry for more Bruce Lee films and thus remaining footage (completed before his death) of Lee fighting several opponents including Dan Inosanto, Hugh O'Brian and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was crafted into another film titled Bruce Lee - Mein letzter Kampf (1978). The film used a lookalike and shadowy camera work to be substituted for the real Lee in numerous scenes. The film is a poor addition to the line-up and is only saved by the final twenty minutes and the footage of the real Bruce Lee battling his way up the tower. Amazingly, this same shoddy process was used to create Der letzte Kampf der Todeskralle (1980), with a lookalike and more stunt doubles interwoven with a few brief minutes of footage of the real Bruce Lee.\n\nTragically, his son Brandon Lee, an actor and martial artist like his father, was killed in a freak accident on the set of The Crow - Die Krähe (1994). Bruce Lee was not only an amazing athlete and martial artist but he possessed genuine superstar charisma and through a handful of films he left behind an indelible impression on the tapestry of modern cinema."
