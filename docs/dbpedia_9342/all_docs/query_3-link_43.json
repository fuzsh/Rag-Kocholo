Sign up here\n\nMagnetic north is on the move\n\nThe world has an official new magnetic model for its navigation systems and it needs it, because in recent years magnetic north has been moving east, towards Siberia, at a rate of around 50 to 60 kilometres per year (The Guardian). The World Magnetic Model update, required to ensure accurate navigation near the North Pole, was moved forward from a planned 2020 release due to the current speed of this movement.\n\nApple to pay €500 million in French taxes\n\nFollowing years of public protests against Apple, the US tech giant has agreed to pay the French government an estimated €500m (£440m) to cover years of taxes it avoided paying on its revenues in the country (The Register). France has been pushing for a Europe-wide tax system to help prevent companies from funnelling their profits away to countries with the lowest tax rates, but these have been impeded by Ireland, where many US tech giants have their EU headquarters.\n\nAn AI has learned to play Pictionary\n\nMost humans a have a bit of trouble working out phrases from scrawled stick figures in a game of Pictionary but now, computer scientists from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence have taught an AI to play (Science). Designed to help bring \"common sense\" to AIs, the system first tries to reduce your drawing to a series of icons for you to select from, and then attempts to parse meaning from those. You can take on the AI yourself at Iconary game site.\n\nMedical cannabis is now in the UK, but nobody can get a prescription\n\nIn November last year, home secretary Sajid Javid introduced legislation which made it possible for people to legally access cannabis for medical reasons (WIRED).\n\nThree months later, campaigners say that only handful have actually received a medical cannabis prescription since November 2018, and that the few who did manage to get a prescription have not actually been able to access medical cannabis – due to problems with persuading specialists that cannabis is the right option, obtaining licenses for cannabis-based products, and even transporting them once they’re in the UK.\n\nThis tool helps you apply Marie Kondo's tidying method to your Twitter feed\n\nEveryone's keen to apply Marie Kondo's tidying methods to their digital life: Tokimeki Unfollow is a tool to help declutter your Twitter feed (TechCrunch). After signing in with Twitter, the tool shows the accounts you follow in chronological, reverse-chronological or random order, optionally - and ideally - without their bios so you can get a proper feel for whether the content they bring to your feed really sparks joy.\n\nPodcast 403: Why you're not a morning person:\n\nListen now, subscribe via RSS or add to iTunes.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK\n\nGoogle DeepMind’s Game-Playing AI Tackles a Chatbot Blind Spot\n\nGoogle’s new advance combines a large language model with a self-learning AI. The technique could address some shortcomings with AI—although there’s a catch.\n\nTo Lead in AI, the US Needs a Silicon Revolution\n\nUS Commerce Department undersecretary Laurie E. Locascio says America needs to invent new chip manufacturing techniques.\n\nGenerative AI Has a 'Shoplifting' Problem. This Startup CEO Has a Plan to Fix It\n\nBill Gross’ ProRata, which has struck deals with partners like Time and Universal Music Group, has a strategy for making AI powerhouses pay for content.\n\nNew Jersey’s $500 Million Bid to Become an AI Epicenter\n\nThe Garden State has enacted a hefty new tax credit specifically for AI businesses. But tax incentives—particularly for data centers—don’t always create a lot of jobs.\n\nZoom Is Going After Google and Microsoft With AI-Driven Docs\n\nThe video-conferencing app is trying to create an \"everything workplace\" app in a crowded market.\n\nInstagram Will Let You Make Custom AI Chatbots—Even Ones Based on Yourself\n\nMeta’s AI Studio will let users build virtual characters, with a few limitations.\n\nAI Is Heating the Olympic Pool\n\nA data center in Paris has been hooked up to the energy system heating the Olympic pool. But critics say that projects recycling data centers’ excess heat are a distraction from the real environmental costs of AI.\n\nYou Won’t Believe What Car Headlights Have in Store\n\nNew technology and a drive toward electrified powertrains have converged to create a flashy new car-lighting landscape. What comes next could be an international light language."
