        "text": "What Is Plantar Fasciitis?\n\nPlantar fasciitis is the most common cause of pain in the heel of the foot. The plantar fascia is a sturdy band of connective tissue that stretches from heel to toe and forms the arch of your foot.\n\nPlantar fasciitis results from overuse and too much stretching of the plantar fascia, which causes swelling. The swelling in turn causes inflammation and pain when you walk. Plantar fasciitis can also be caused when the tissue that makes up the plantar fascia tears. The condition typically affects runners and people who have flat feet, high arches, are overweight, or are on their feet a lot.\n\nThe sharp pain of plantar fasciitis is particularly noticeable when you first start to walk in the morning. The pain may ease as you walk around, but anytime you've been off your feet for a while, the stabbing pain can return.\n\nDifference between a heel spur and plantar fasciitis\n\nMany people have spurs, an extra growth of bone. They most typically occur at joints where bones meet. For most people, heel spurs don't cause pain. Because they are made of bone, heel spurs can be readily seen on X-rays. X-rays can help rule out a spur as the cause of your heel pain. Your doctor will ususally try to reproduce the pain you feel with plantar fasciitis to make a diagnosis.\n\nPlantar Fasciitis Treatment at Home\n\nPlantar fasciitis is typically easy to manage with home treatment and over-the-counter medicines. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy or, rarely, surgery.\n\nMost of the time, one or more of the remedies listed below can relieve your symptoms of plantar fasciitis. It may take 6-12 months for your foot to get back to normal, but doing these things at home can help ease the pain and help your foot heal faster:\n\nRest\n\nIt's important to avoid putting weight on your foot until the inflammation goes down.\n\nIce\n\nThis is an easy way to treat inflammation, and there are a few ways you can use it. To make an ice pack, wrap a towel around a plastic bag filled with crushed ice or around a package of frozen corn or peas. Put it on your heel three to four times a day for 15-20 minutes at a time. Or you can fill a shallow pan with water and ice and soak your heel in it for 10-15 minutes a few times a day. Be sure to keep your toes out of the water.\n\nAnother option is to fill a small paper or foam cup with water and freeze it. Then rub it over your heel for 5-10 minutes or until your heel is numb.\n\nPain relievers\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can make your foot feel better and help with inflammation.\n\nAthletic tape\n\nIt can support your foot and keep you from moving it in a way that makes plantar fasciitis worse.\n\nShoe inserts\n\nAlso called insoles, arch supports, or orthotics, they can give you extra cushion and support. You can get them over the counter (OTC) or have them custom-made. Mostly, your results will be just as good and cheaper with OTC inserts. While choosing, go for firmer inserts with good arch support.\n\nYou might also see advertisements for magnetic insoles to help with plantar fasciitis. Research has generally shown these don't work.\n\nHeel cups\n\nWith each step you take, your heel pounds the ground and puts tension on your plantar fascia. These heel-shaped pads that go in your shoes may help. They raise your heel to relieve tension and give you extra cushion. They often don't work as well as inserts, but they're a cheap option to try.\n\nNight splints\n\nMost of us sleep with our feet pointed down, which shortens the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon. Night splints, which you wear while you sleep, keep your feet at a 90-degree angle. So, instead of shortening your plantar fascia, you get a good, constant stretch while you sleep. They can be bulky, but they tend to work really well. And once the pain is gone, you can stop wearing them.\n\nWalking cast or boot\n\nTypically, your doctor would suggest a walking cast or boot -- called a controlled ankle motion (CAM) walker -- only when other treatments have failed. The cast or CAM walker forces you to rest your foot, which can help relieve pain. But it's not a cure. When the cast comes off, the pain may return. That means you'll need other treatments too, such as insoles and stretching.\n\nDoing stretches and exercises. Stretch your calves, Achilles tendon, and the bottom of your foot. Do exercises that make your hips, lower leg, and foot muscles stronger. This can help stabilize your ankle, ease pain, and keep plantar fasciitis from coming back.\n\nLosing weight. If you're overweight or obese, you may put more pressure on the bottom of your feet. That pressure can lead to plantar fasciitis.\n\nChoosing shoes with good support. Replace your athletic shoes often. Stay away from high heels.\n\nDon't go barefoot on hard surfaces. This includes your first few steps when you get up in the morning. It's common to feel plantar fasciitis then. So, you'll want to keep some supportive footwear by your bed.\n\nYou may also want to ask your doctor if it would help to wear inserts in your shoes.\n\nDoing low-impact exercises. Activities such as swimming or cycling won't cause plantar fasciitis or make it worse. After you're done, stretch out your calves and feet. For instance, curl and relax your toes and make circles with your feet and ankles.\n\nPlantar Fasciitis FAQs\n\nHow do I cure my plantar fasciitis?\n\nTo treat plantar fasciitis yourself, do stretching exercises for the plantar fascia several times a day, ice your foot, take NSAIDs, rest your foot, wear orthotics to support your heel and arch, and decrease the amount or length of activities that cause you pain such as walking or running. Try to switch to non-weight-bearing exercise while your foot heals.\n\nIs it OK to keep walking with plantar fasciitis?\n\nYes, but to ease pain, make sure you walk in supportive shoes with some cushioning. Don't wear worn-out sneakers or athletic shoes. Limit how long and how far you walk if your pain gets worse. If your plantar fasciitis pain is severe, your doctor may recommend a walking boot to keep your full weight off your foot."
