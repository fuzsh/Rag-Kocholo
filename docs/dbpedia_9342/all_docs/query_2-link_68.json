        "text": "\"I apologize if I haven't been the friend you deserve. But I want you to know, in my way, I love you all.\"\n\n―Sheldon Cooper to his friends, The Stockholm Syndrome\n\nSheldon Lee[1] Cooper,[2] B.Sc., M.Sc., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D.,[3] is a Caltech theoretical physicist. Next to his best friend Leonard Hofstadter, he's the main protagonist of The Big Bang Theory and the titular protagonist of Young Sheldon.\n\nOriginally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11 in 1991, receiving his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a \"wunderkind,\" such as his plan to provide free electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan that government pen-pushers stopped, claiming that it is illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly geeky, he has no qualms about speaking Klingon, wearing vintage t-shirts sporting super-hero logos, or spouting various historical and cultural anecdotes (e.g., his account of the introduction of the fork into Thailand). While he may claim to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have his faults. Sheldon is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene, an overly intellectual personality, a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor, and a general lack of humility or empathy, the former of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his admiration for his superior intellect. These qualities, along with his penchant for pranks, are his character's main source of humor. He is often considered to be the most iconic character of the show. Sheldon has developed a more sociable personality due to the influences of his friends especially his friend Penny and his wife Amy.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nSheldon was born alongside his twin sister Missy on February 26, 1980, in a Kmart in Galveston, Texas to the late George Cooper Sr. and Mary Cooper and was officiated at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. He has an older brother named George Cooper Jr., who, along with Missy, is described by their mother to be \"dumb as soup.\" Sheldon was raised according to his mother's Evangelical Christian doctrines, (i.e., learning how to pray and becoming the co-captain of the East Texan Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League Championship team and seven-to-twelve year-old division). Meanwhile, he was forced to watch football by his father.\n\nLike any typical nerd, Sheldon was bullied a lot during his childhood, mostly because he constantly expressed intellectual superiority to his peers as he still does now. The bullying consisted of, but was not limited to, being beaten up, getting wedgies, being stuffed in small spaces, and having his personal belongings stolen. This is further accentuated when he tells Amy Farrah Fowler that the memories of his upbringing were tantamount to that of an insufferably tantalizing \"hell.\" Further anecdotes also reveal that he built a so-called \"Sonic Death Ray\" that failed even to slow down the neighbor kids (all it did was annoy their dog), and constructed an armed robot using integrated circuits from ceramic semiconductor substrates cooked in Missy's modified Easy-Bake Oven, to defend his room from Missy (whose eyebrows were burned off as a result of a malfunction). Sheldon was also beaten up by his brother and sister, with Missy usually kicking Sheldon in his crotch and Georgie farting on his head while Sheldon tries to watch Star Trek.\n\nWhen Sheldon was five years old, his Pop-Pop died. Sheldon missed him and wanted him back and asked Santa to bring him back, but it didn't happen and this soured Sheldon so much that he disliked Christmas altogether.\n\nSince the age of 9, he had been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider. (In \"The Large Hadron Collision\" (S3E15), he voiced those dreams.) Sheldon formerly despised birthday parties because he shared his birthday with his twin sister. Missy and her childhood friends tricked Sheldon that Batman was coming and he waited the whole afternoon at the door and all that came was a robin that flew in the window. He never wanted one after that, until his friends threw him an enjoyable birthday party in \"The Celebration Experimentation.\"\n\nAs a kid, Sheldon wrote a paper entitled \"A Proof That Algebraic Topology Can Never Have A Non-Self-Contradictory Set Of Abelian Groups\" and his grade school science project paper, with the original title \"A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism,\" contains an approach that may change the way how ferromagnetic hysteresis is calculated. Despite his misgivings about being called a 'rocket scientist' as an adult, at nine years old, the boy genius wrote \"Rocket Reentry & Retropropulsion\" in a composition notebook; this provides the solution to the VTVL problem discreetly employed by Elon Musk years later for his successful SpaceX CRS-8 mission. While Sheldon audited Dr. John Sturgis' quantum chromodynamics course at East Texas Tech at 9, as Medford High School no longer academically challenged him, Sheldon formally entered college at 11. At 12, filled with disappointment at not receiving a titanium centrifuge to separate radioactive isotopes, he had to be flown to a hospital by helicopter to be treated for radiation burns following a mishap when he built a CAT scanner, which also resulted in the death of his sister's guinea pig, \"Snowball.\" He also, at this time, conducted experiments involving the height of stairs only to deduce that if a step on a staircase is two millimeters off or more, a person is likely to trip - his findings are evidenced by his father breaking his clavicle. When Sheldon was 13, he attempted to build a nuclear reactor in order to provide free electricity for his town, but it failed after a government agent informed him that it was illegal to store \"yellowcake\" uranium inside a shed; he then erupted as a result. During that same year, he walked in on his father having sex with Mary who was roleplaying a german girl named \"Helga\", however, Sheldon thought that was another woman, and Sheldon decided to start knocking three times to prevent walking in on anything like that again. When Sheldon was fourteen years old, he graduated college East Texas Tech summa cum laude as Valedictorian, began graduate school at the California Institute of Technology, and was the youngest person at the time to receive the Stevenson Award at \"fourteen and a half.\" He received his first doctorate at the age of sixteen, and he then spent four years on his second dissertation before obtaining his current position.\n\nIn 1994, his father died due to a heart attack in \"A New Home and a Traditional Texas Torture\" (S7E12 YS). In \"The Pancake Batter Anomaly\" (S1E11), Sheldon said, at the age of 15, he got sick in Germany, and his mother had to fly back to Texas to help his dad at that time. This creates a continuity error in the episodes \"The Thanksgiving Decoupling\" (S7E9) and \"The Proton Transmogrification\" (S7E22) because Sheldon mentions to Bernadette's father Mike and to the ghost of Professor Proton, respectively, that his father died when he was 14.\n\nWhen Sheldon graduated from college at 14, he got accepted into Caltech. Though he was planning to move in together with Tam, Tam found a girlfriend and decided to stay in Texas instead. This explains Sheldon not having spoken to Tam for a long time.\n\nIt's unknown when he moved into The Apartment Building with Sebastian before he drove him out, and he met Stuart Bloom and the comic book store.\n\nIn 2003, Leonard moved in with Sheldon after all his previous roommates could not stand him.\n\nLater life[]\n\nA few minor details of Sheldon's later life have been revealed through his narration in Young Sheldon. In Vanilla Ice Cream, Gentlemen Callers, and a Dinette Set Sheldon states that he would have children whom he would draw up contracts with similar to the ones he'd made with friends and family over the years. At the end of Graduation, Sheldon mentions that he held a graduation party for his son Leonard, who was named after possibly after his best friend and roomate. Sheldon also mentioned he wanted to name him after Leonard Nimoy but Amy refused so they agreed to just Leonard. An argument between Sheldon and Howard in An Introduction to Engineering and a Glob of Hair Gel reveals that Sheldon never takes off his Nobel Prize so people will ask him about it.\n\nCareer Highlights[]\n\nDr. Sheldon Cooper is a former senior theoretical particle physicist at the California Institute of Technology, focusing on string theory and its alter ego M-theory. He held this position for three-and-a-half years at the outset of the show and up until the eighth season. As he was being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory, he is then promoted to junior professor in order to change his field of study to dark matter, with the stipulation that he'd teach a graduate-level class on analytical mechanics. He returns to string theory research in the eleventh season. Previously, he was a visiting professor at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany at age fifteen and examined perturbative amplitudes in N=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multiloop N=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory at age sixteen. His doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface was the basis of his postdoctoral fellowship. He believes string theory better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does loop quantum gravity. He neither gives credence to the notion that quantized space-time will manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors (as he expects matter consists of tiny strings) nor that only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes. Nonetheless, he is solely responsible for the university's six-loop quantum gravity calculations.\n\nSheldon's work on string theory is concentrated in several different directions. Notably, Sheldon has refocused his research from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory. He wrote a paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states and illustrated mirror symmetry in the footnote of a publication. He determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons and reconciled the black hole information paradox with his theory of string-network condensates following a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate. He also designated time for solving the space-time geometry in higher spin gravity and worked on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Cooper's research spans particle physics in particle cosmology and studies the interplay between particle physics and cosmology during the Physical cosmology of the Universe. With Rajesh Koothrappali, he explored the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, Theories of Supersymmetry breaking, string theory implications of Gamma rays from weakly interacting massive particles as dark matter annihilations, and considered Dark matter detection methods of optimizing a particle detector for 500 giga-Gelectronvolt Weakly interacting massive particles to this end. At a San Francisco conference, he tried to initiate a collaboration with Nobel Prize-winning physicist George Smoot by presenting him his paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the Chronology of the early universe. The famous physicist Stephen Hawking reached out to him during a lecture stay at Caltech after Sheldon's brilliant mind was revealed in a reading of his fascinating, though wrong, paper which posited that the Higgs boson is a black hole Entropy accelerating backwards through time. Sheldon also maintained a correspondence with cosmological physicist Elizabeth Plimpton for years about their mutual interest in effects of a passing gravitational wave signatures of inflations in the Chronology of the early universe. When Caltech received a new open science grid computer, he attempted to schedule a time to run computer simulations of structure formation in the early universe. He was thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy. However, he no longer preoccupies his time with investigating why the Zero-point energy and predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the metric expansion of space.\n\nSheldon has redirected his work to the nature of dark matter. In addition to studying the Weakly interacting massive particles as dark matter, a particle physics point of view, he also considered the scalar field dark matter, an observable large-scale structure of a geometric point of view. This led him to attempt a full mathematical proof of the Riemanni Penrose Conjecture.\n\nBridging theory and experiment, Sheldon is active in the field of particle physics phenomenology at high-energy colliders such as the LHC. Sheldon came close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider had yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle. Though, he was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles southeast of Traverse City, Michigan.\n\nIn a similar capacity, Sheldon has made advances in theoretical plasma physics, studying turbulence and Turbulent diffusion, and how it might be reduced to improve fusion reactor designs. Consequently, Sheldon worked with colleague Barry Kripke on the Grant proposal for a new fusion reactor, as the university was only allowed to submit one proposal.\n\nFrom nuclear physics, he was thought to have discovered a method for synthetic element. Despite the fact that a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron with extremely promising results and reportedly found the element, his calculations were wrong; the table from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, in which he looked up the nuclear reaction rate rates of chemical elements such as mendelevium, was in units of square centimeters (cm2), which he misread as square meters (m2), meaning he was off by a factor of 10,000. Sheldon surmised there must be some atomic particle and molecular resonance between the elements he did not consider. In fact, someone from the Chinese research team added simulated signals to the data files, as Leonard Hofstadter re-ran the tests in his lab and disproved Sheldon's theory.\n\nSheldon additionally engages in condensed matter physics research on occasion and has lectured on topological insulators, as well as given a seminar on thermodynamic fluctuations. With Leonard, he co-wrote a paper titled \"Paradoxical Moment-of-Inertia Changes Due to Putative Super-Solids\", to be presented at an Institute for Experimental Physics topical conference on Bose-Einstein condensates. He discovered that electrons traveling through a graphene sheet on hexagonal pathways possess zero effective mass since they coincidentally exhibit the same dispersion pattern as Dirac fermions and must be considered as a Fermionic field wave. In addition, he had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, Sheldon has grappled with Gedankenexperiments (i.e., \"thought experiments\") to illustrate the quantum measurement problem. He produced four out of the five Gedankenexperiments he thought necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem, before the information was lost.\n\nFor his contributions to theoretical physics, he won a Caltech Chancellor's Award for Science. In \"The Monopolar Expedition\", Sheldon received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to lead an expedition to the Magnetic North Pole in the Arctic Circle for a magnetic monopole experiment in search of slow-moving magnetic monopoles, with Leonard, Raj and Howard as his support team. In the experiment, he detected what he believed was a significant magnetic monopolar magnetic charge, validating string theory, one of the chief predictions of superstring theory. Though Sheldon publicly announced he had confirmed string theory and would receive a Nobel Prize, he learned that the charge detected was actually static electricity from the others' electric can opener, forcing Sheldon to issue a retraction to his announcement and severely damaging his reputation at the university. Soon after, National Public Radio with Ira Flatow from Science Friday interviewed him by phone from his office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of spin ice and magnetic monopoles in spin ice. Based on his supposed discovery of a new stable superheavy element (which was actually a blunder), Sheldon appeared on Science Friday twice wherein a possible Nobel Prize in Chemistry was mentioned, had an article written about him in Physics Today and the National Science Foundation (NSF) wanted to give him a substantial grant.\n\nBased upon a theory from Leonard, Sheldon wrote a paper detailing a theory that space-time is like a super-fluid. The paper was well received by the scientific community that included Professor Stephen Hawking.\n\nIn \"The Anxiety Optimization\", Sheldon is trying to increase his working efficiency by keeping a high anxiety level while driving everybody crazy. The only good point is that he wants his friends to annoy him. Extremely tired, both Penny and Leonard put him to bed singing \"Soft Kitty\".\n\nLeonard gets an idea to compare the universe to the surface of an Nth dimension sphere which he describes to Sheldon, who finds the theory interesting. He works out the math. Together they are praised, lecture on their discovery and get an award. Howard comes up with the idea to turn it into a working guidance system which is patented, and Howard builds a working prototype by the end of season 9.\n\nIn the 11th and 12th seasons, Sheldon and Amy work together on a Super-Asymmetry for string theory which is published and widely applauded. After a couple of Fermi-Lab scientists accidentally prove their theory, all of them are in competition for a possible Nobel Prize.\n\nIn \"The VCR Illumination\", after Sheldon finds the Russian paper that says the Super Asymmetry is not worth pursing, both he and Amy get very depressed. Sheldon locates an emergency VHS tape made by him when he was eleven (for, according to him, the day they stopped making Star Wars movies). His character from Young Sheldon tries to give him a pep talk but it was recorded over by his father with one of his football games. Amy keeps watching it and then finds his father's halftime pep talk which does help Sheldon. His father tells the team that they're not going to win this game, but that that does not make them losers. They can learn from failure as much as they can learn from success. Sheldon is encouraged and even thanks his dead father in the end.\n\nIn 2019, both he and Amy accept the Nobel Prizes in Physics for the development of Super Asymmetry. At the ceremony, Sheldon puts aside his self-centered speech and realizes that his achievement isn't just his but also his family and friends who encouraged him and tolerated him. Sheldon introduces his friends to the world and tells them how much he loves them, even calling him his other family, in the last moments of the show.\n\nSeries Overview[]\n\nThe Big Bang Theory[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nSheldon and Leonard need to get a Fractional T1 Bandwidth Connection, they decide to finance it by going to a sperm bank; however, they change their minds because Sheldon thinks that they are committing genetic fraud.

Penny convinces Leonard to go fly kites with Sheldon in Leonard's last scene in the episode. (The Cornhusker Vortex)\n\nWhile solo in his own apartment, Penny has an accident and dislocates her shoulder. Sheldon comments there wasn't a shower mat or adhesive ducks to help her not get hurt. She foolishly tells Sheldon to help her, not realizing that an ambulance would've helped her MUCH faster and he dresses her up while peaking at her secretly. While filling out a medical form for Penny, Sheldon makes her mad and Sheldon writes down she has episodes of extreme rage. He then takes her home under the influence of powerful pain medication and they sing soft kitty together.\n\nHoward finds out the day Sheldon drove Penny once she broke her arm, he drove through a red light and is scheduled to appear in court the day the guys are supposed to see Stan Lee in Stuart's store. Sheldon's mad at Penny for making the guys miss seeing Stan Lee, though Raj, Leonard and Howard reveal they're not going with Sheldon to his trial. As Sheldon starts preparing his speech for court, Howard says Sheldon's going to jail. When Sheldon objects to paying and proceeds to insult the judge, he denies the chance the judge gives him to say sorry and he gets put in a cell, where he tells a cellmate he has a spot. Once he finds out he has to pee in front of a cellmate if he has to pee, he decides to tell the judge sorry and is let out of jail. Upon Howard teasing Sheldon via mentioning he, Stuart and Leonard went for gelato with Stan, which he said they could call him, Sheldon gives Penny the moving finger and goes. Penny gets Stan's address from Stuart in exchange for going to his cousin's wedding with him and she gets permission to bring Leonard, who Stuart will tell people is Penny's cousin. Penny does most of the talking and Sheldon's lack of understanding sarcasm leads him to go into Stan's house and Penny runs once Stan gives orders to have the police called.

When the call that they won finally comes, Sheldon thinks he's dreaming and Leonard slaps him and the two couples cheer over Sheldon and Amy's victory.

(The Change Constant)\n\nSheldon fixes the DNA model which Sheldon made as a genetic code for an advanced human race in his old apartment that Leonard broke with Leonard, who comments they had a very pleasurable 139.5 hours, which is a subtle reference to the number of Big Bang Theory episodes. Sheldon and Amy hold a discussion on rules of communication in Sweden and head to use The Elevator, which has too much luggage for the seven friends to fit with in. Leonard has an idea, though isn't too thrilled with Sheldon calling him a valuable part of his entourage as a result. Sheldon winning the Nobel prize leads him to start treating his friends with disrespect, evidenced by him dismissing Penny's pregnancy as something he can't catch and calling Howard an idiot in front of Leonard, who's mad at his selfishness and unkind treatment of him and the rest of the group. The three consider leaving when Sheldon dismisses Howard's meltdown and only focuses on his own success and big day. Sheldon hypocritically calls his friends selfish for wanting to leave, which leads Amy to snap at him for mistreating his friends. Sheldon opens his eyes and gives them the respect they've deserved for many years from him, moving Penny to tears. The series ends with them having dinner with all their friends other than Stuart, Bert and Denise, and Sheldon and Amy wearing their Nobel prize, all while the acoustic version of the theme song plays.\n\nYoung Sheldon[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nSheldon starts high school at the age of 9.

(A Rival Prodigy and Sir Isaac Neutron)\n\nSheldon puts up a machine for the Swedish radio, he invites everyone in high school to his garage to listen to the Nobel prize, but no one comes, not even Tam, and due to Dr. Sturgis having an episode, can't come too, Sheldon sits in the garage while the radio announces the winners, Sheldon cries while Adult Sheldon narrates that \"A primary feature of quarks is that they're always bonded together, but in that moment, i felt like a neutrino, destined to be alone forever\", it cuts to an 8 year-old Leonard (listening to the radio aswell), a 4 year-old Penny (sprawled out sleeping), a 9 year-old Raj (studying), a 9 year-old Howard (playing games while his mother yells at him to go to sleep), a 5 year-old Bernadette (sleeping with her pageant trophies next to her bed), and an 11 year-old Amy (reading Little House on the Prairie in bed), it then cuts back to Sheldon while Adult Sheldon narrates that thankfully, he was wrong. (A Swedish Science Thing and the Equation for Toast)\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nSheldon learns about deep emotions when Paige gets emotional about her parents divorce, he finds a new way of comforting someone by offering them a hot beverage, this becomes a tradition and is often used in The Big Bang Theory.

(Graduation)\n\nSeason 5[]\n\nGeorgie's pregnancy news finally reach to the family, but Sheldon doesn't care about it but he makes a new nickname for the unmarried mother, nibling.\n\nSeason 6[]\n\nSheldon is worried about grad school and tries to persuade the college into making him join one, but, Dr. Sturgis pulls some strings and is able to get him into a grad school in Heidelberg, Germany, and with Dr. Linkletter and Pastor Jeff's funds, he's set to go to Germany.\n\nSheldon and Mary go to Germany for his grad school, but, a tornado comes along and destroys Meemaw's house, the news still haven't been sent to Mary and Sheldon. ( A Tornado, a 10-Hour Flight and a Darn Fine Ring)\n\nSeason 7[]\n\nAfter Mary and Sheldon got the news, Mary immediately plans a trip to go home. Sheldon tries to rebel but to no avail, however, after coming home from his former college, he sees George in bed with another woman (whom is Mary roleplaying). Since that day, Sheldon never spoke of it to his father and has since then added three more knocks for people to have time to put their pants on. (A Wiener Schnitzel and Underwear in a Tree)\n\nSheldon's father had died due to a heart attack and the family's grieving in varying ways. Sheldon's way of grieving is thinking of the different ways he could've said goodbye to his father, but it leads to Sheldon not speaking even in his father's funeral, which, he ultimately regrets. The episode ends with adult Sheldon mentioning he loves and will forever miss his father. (Funeral)\n\nSheldon And Amy make their 1st appearances as adults since The Big Bang Theory series finale. Amy Tells Sheldon to get an ice hockey jersey on and take a shower for their son Leonard's hockey game in an hour. Sheldon says he's working on his memoir and disapproves of said sport. In his youth, the chaos continues regarding Sheldon's dad's death and Mary asks her younger kids to get baptized, which they're reluctant to do. Meemaw begs the kids to get baptized, cause Mary's in so much pain and they agree to baptism. At the church, Pastor Jeff sets Missy off and she backs out of the deal. Sheldon's not happy to get baptized, though does so for Mary and Meemaw. Amy's surprised Sheldon got baptized and Sheldon reveals he got an ear infection, which was worth the price for Mary. Adult Sheldon goes to his son's hockey game in a jersey and he says Penny never should've gotten to babysit their kids upon Amy mentioning her daughter wants to take acting classes. Sheldon Wishes Missy farewell prior to heading to Caltech. (Memoir)\n\nCharacterization[]\n\nAside from his characteristic idiosyncrasies, and unpragmatic obsessions Sheldon believes humans are illogical and attempts to be logical himself. [Even though, in reality, he's actually significantly more illogical than most people in so many ways (i.e.; fear of change, fear of birds, using his smarts to make others feel dumb, being immature etc.)] He frequently states that he possesses an eidetic memory although the correct term for this type of recall is hyperthymesia (highly superior autobiographical memory) He also states that he has an IQ of 187, though he claims his IQ cannot be accurately measured by normal tests (further confirming his egotism). Sheldon has a generally excessively extensive knowledge of most philosophical principles of certain topics of interest, as shown, for example, by his comments about various details of anecdotal knowledge (for instance, about the introduction of the fork into Thailand). He can remember everything he's exposed to. It was also revealed in \"The Sales Call Sublimation\" that Sheldon, possibly, has synesthesia. He told Raj that he automatically sees prime numbers as red and that twin primes appear pink and smell like gasoline. These are characteristics of people with synesthesia.\n\nSheldon also has qualities associated with being a prodigy, such as an inflated ego, social ineptitude, and an inability to relate emotionally with other people. Despite his intelligence, he has a distinct lack of emotional maturity and is often baffled by even the most common social interactions. He not only fails to understand the simplest sarcastic jokes made by his friends but also regards their sadness over problems with blatant confusion.\n\nEventually he has begun to understand the concept of sarcasm, attempting unsuccessfully to employ it himself towards Penny in the second season, and successfully employing it towards his other friends in the third season. He appears to have a complete disinterest in romantic relationships, and his eccentricities, direct remarks and demanding nature put him at odds with his own friends and especially Penny. For a few years he also showed a disinterest in being romantic with Amy.\n\nUp until \"The Empathy Optimization\", Sheldon never seemed to have any sense of remorse or guilt. Perfect examples of this include when he ratted out Leonard, Raj and Howard for inappropriate sexual behavior to Human Resources, just because he thought he did nothing wrong (when, in reality, he talked to his assistant about sexually transmitted diseases) and when he puts down Amy by not treating her accomplishments like they were a big deal.\n\nAccording to Sheldon's Meemaw, it's strongly implied that Sheldon takes after his grandfather, Pop-pop, who was known for being \"a stubborn, egotistical man\". When the group find an actual prop of the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings Sheldon immediately snatches it off Howard, bluntly declaring \"Mine!\" and when people protest to this, he claims \"I don't understand why, in this group, I never get my way!\", completely oblivious to the fact that he always gets his way. When he doesn't get the Ring, he constantly tries to retrieve it, to the point of invading his own friends' privacy and boundaries and effectively stealing it off them (e.g.; he tried to steal it off Penny while she was sleeping, only resulting in her reflexively punching him and breaking his nose and later pickpocketing Leonard while he was relieving himself in the men's room). This particular example shows that his great love for a fictional movie or rights cause him to be extremely obsessed with things that don't really matter in the context of the real world. In conclusion, it can be axiomatically ascertained that Sheldon will try to achieve, retrieve or maintain anything if it meant that he would seem (fictionally or genuinely) superior to \"everyone\" else.\n\nSheldon adheres to The Roommate Agreement constantly when things don't go his way and interestingly, Sheldon's styled the roommate agreement so that everything goes his way. Sheldon also officiates in said agreement that he settles all ties, increasing the likelihood that he gets what he wants. That being said, when a clause of the Roommate Agreement applies to him to not do something, he will treat it like it's ridiculous - in the process, hypocritically violating the agreement despite constantly chiding Leonard when he apparently violates it. At one point, when Leonard headed a project for the group, Sheldon labelled him as simply the founder, while he was chief or head of absolutely everything else, making him in charge. He also tried to make the project named after himself, even trying to get by naming the project with his name spelt backwards. Sheldon is revealed by Priya to have repeatedly violated the roommate agreement, and the several demonstrations of this cause deep discomfort and even despair in Sheldon, who becomes vengeful and deliberately damages Leonard and Priya's relationship through blackmail afterwards.\n\nSheldon does not see fault in absolutely anything he does in his life, to such an extent that he doesn't think that, when he commits a serious crime, he is doing anything wrong. He, at one point, insulted a judge while in court, simply because of his belief that his job and status was superior to the judge's, which landed him in jail for his trouble. Sheldon also stalked President Siebert just to get a simple answer out of him, to the point of following him to his home and then calling him anonymously. Sheldon is willing to do anything to get what he wants even if it's against the law. Prime example is when he deliberately puts all of Penny's clothes on the telephone wires without acknowledging, or even probably noticing. When he finds out he's wrong, he just replies, \"Oh!\" and doesn't apologize.\n\nHe sees it as his absolute right to interfere with something that has nothing to do with his business, and alter it so that it benefits or pleases him, shown at one point when he interfered with Leonard's dating another woman despite it not concerning him at all. Another example is when Penny, after an argument with Leonard which upsets Sheldon, says that \"this really isn't about you\", his only (strained) response - after a very long pause - is \"I don't follow\", showing that he doesn't understand why he cannot be priority one in situations that has nothing to do with him. Sheldon also doesn't realize at all that he's an immense burden to everyone around him due to his controlling, condescending, and demoralizing behavior - he rather sees himself as a true privilege to his friends simply out of egomania.\n\nSheldon is openly pompous and condescending towards people like Howard, treating him like a simpleton - to say the least - constantly. His incredible sense of pomposity is so widespread that he immediately places himself in a position of absolute power, credit, benefit, or authority in whatever project, ambition, or situation which is discussed within earshot of him. He will also meet every single opposition to his authority with immense melodrama - he describes Leonard's control of one notable project as 'Leonard's reign of tyranny', despite being a dictator himself. He's also completely taken off guard when he is excluded from the project, because he's absolutely incapable of seeing anything he's done as a bad thing.\n\nSheldon can be conceited as he pictures himself as either/or a mentor, teacher, father-figure, sensei, commander, superior and director simply out of intense self-delusion. He does not do any amount of personal labor if he could avoid it, shown by how he is seen with Howard and Raj both carrying huge workloads of Christmas presents, whilst he is only carrying a small cylindrical present in one hand and eating an ice cream cone with the other. He appears completely indifferent, if not apathetic, to the fact that they are on the edge of collapsing from exhaustion and could be crushed under the weight. Another supreme example is when he realizes that Amy is going to work at the same university as he is, and says \"You can't work where I work\", thinking that he has complete jurisdiction over where she works.\n\nAnother key example of Sheldon's selfishness is when he's ill. Sheldon demands that everyone else take care of him, even if they're occupied with other tasks or could be hurt or ill themselves due to never having been ill alone before. He also believes that being ill motivates him to speak to others as he pleases, shown during \"The Empathy Optimization\". He did not realize how rude he was until Leonard made him remember.\n\nThough not confirmed, Sheldon appears to have extreme megalomaniacal tendencies. When he was a child, the kind of pet he wanted would be one that was capable of killing at telepathic command. He also, at several points in his childhood, tried to build devices and technologies that would enable him to kill or avenge himself on people who had done him wrong. At several points in his life, he fantasizes about \"rising to power\", gaining a planet that he can rule with an iron fist, even declaring that he will, one day, have a robot army at his disposal. In addition to this, Sheldon constantly brags that he will, one day, gain a Nobel Prize and suggests to several people that their contributions to his life will earn them a mention in his memoirs (entitled \"You're welcome, mankind\"). He also sees himself as a world-renowned physicist with an unparalleled understanding of the universe and that he's on the precipice of advancing mankind's understanding of the universe, ignoring the fact that there are some aspects of even science that he has some lack of understanding of, and he is notoriously able to make scientific mistakes - he was rendered absolutely speechless by an equation in a physics bowl which he didn't know the answer to, and was so angry that he couldn't figure it out that he denied the correct answer when it was provided. What this means generally is that he believes that mankind owes him big time, and has done so his entire life.\n\nSheldon's opinion of his own profession is overly ego-oriented, to the point where, if he sees any occupation of someone else's that's unrelated to his, he tacitly and implicitly admonishes them and boasts about his own. This is exemplified by his extremely low opinions of Howard's profession as an engineer (he constantly scorns Howard's intellect based on him not having a Ph.D. and the fact that he's an engineer), his belief that geology is \"the Kardashians of science\" and his discredited opinions of biology as a low point on the scientific ladder simply on the basis that it is, in his own words, \"all about disgusting, squishy things\". However, despite scorning engineering as unimportant, he is shown to be somewhat extremely knowledgeable in the subject himself in terms of general knowledge (certainly not field work) and therefore only condescends the subject because he finds the information and premise \"inferior\" to that of physics. Sheldon has remarked that it is his dream to be an astronaut, and that he was secretly stunned at Howard being chosen to go into space, stating in his own words that it showed him \"they'd just send 'anyone' up there\".\n\nSheldon's expression of his more advanced intelligence has gotten him fired from his job, and even Leonard is surprised to learn that Sheldon is conceited enough to believe that Isaac Newton is intellectually inferior to himself. Sheldon hates it when someone stops him when he is trying to explain something. If he is, a violent tic starts on his face until he can complete what he wants to say, as in \"The Friendship Algorithm\" when he is prevented from explaining why tapioca pudding is a \"jiggling bowl of potential death\". He cannot and will not drive, and thus someone must always drive him, unless in an extreme circumstance (like when he drives Penny to the emergency room in \"The Adhesive Duck Deficiency\".)\n\nSheldon has done some questionable things, such as when he discovered that Penny's apartment was messy, he sneaks in during the night and cleans it up because he can't stand being in the same hallway with something so disastrous. He refuses to sit anywhere other than his designated spot on the couch and follows set routines. A running gag of the show is that, when he knocks on Penny's door, he has to say Penny's name every three knocks (he does this thrice every time). It was never specified by the series creator why Sheldon does those things.\n\nSheldon occasionally uses slang (in a very unnatural fashion), and follows jokes with his catchphrase \"Bazinga!\" He is not entirely sure how to hug someone, and he avoids human contact whenever possible. Despite his ego-centrism, Sheldon appears to be somewhat aware of his social ineptitude, particularly his lack of understanding of sarcasm. He mentioned that he keeps a record of his daily conversations after Penny snapped at him and Leonard asked him why, to which he suggested that Leonard check his conversation records \"to see if I messed up anywhere.\" Sheldon is also a difficult person to work with and generally displays apathy to the world around him. In \"The Toast Derivation\", Sheldon was revealed to have criticized Bill Gates for focusing on his charity work rather than Windows Vista, a remark that earned him a punch in the face.\n\nSheldon also possesses some understanding of other religions such as Hinduism and corrects Rajesh when he says cows are gods, when they are actually like gods, and was also knowledgeable about other Hindu beliefs. However, despite being raised in an extremely religious household, Sheldon possesses no faith in Christianity. Even after moving back to Texas, he planned to teach the religious types evolution and only moved back to Pasadena when his mother calls evolution opinion. Sheldon deems karma as \"nonsense\" and was left baffled when Rajesh deescribed it as Newtonian. Sheldon is extremely germaphobic and is extreme in his methods to avoid catching an illness, such as sterilizing his mouth with whiskey after sipping from Leonard's glass. Sheldon does his best to avoid any human contact; however, as the series continues he became more (albeit only slightly) affectionate person, such as when he hugged Leonard after he returned from Professor Proton's funeral and kissed Amy on board a locomotive. He does not mind Amy touching as their relationship progresses.\n\nSheldon does, on rare occasions, show interest in relationships, which was most prominently seen with Amy Farrah Fowler. However, he does not express it directly; instead, he develops strange behavior patterns, such as buying cats, refusing to open discussion on the matter. Despite this, however, Sheldon remains completely clueless to the sexual innuendos which were present during his and Amy's anniversary when she became intoxicated, causing her to unbutton her blouse and asking that they skip to dessert, for Sheldon to reply \"I just had cobbler.\" This was also evident when their upstairs neighbor \"hooked up\" with the producer of CSI and, while the two are having intercourse, he mistakes it for her jumping up and down on the bed. However, there's one situation where he may have understood an innuendo. When Raj, Leonard, Howard, and Sheldon were competing over The One Ring and Penny appears with \"a bag from Victoria's Secret\", Sheldon and the rest all look at Leonard. He either understood what Penny meant or was looking because everyone else was. Eventually, he does have coitus with Amy but it's only cause that's what she'd want for her birthday. Afterwards, he admits that he enjoyed more than he thought he would.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAppearances\n\nThe Big Bang Theory Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Tot Season 1 17 Season 2 23 Season 3 23 Season 4 24 Season 5 24 Season 6 24 Season 7 24 Season 8 24 Season 9 24 Season 10 24 Season 11 24 Season 12 24\n\nAppearances\n\nYoung Sheldon Episodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Tot Season 1 22 Season 2 22 Season 3 21 Season 4 18 Season 5 22 Season 6 22 Season 7 14 Appeared M = Mentioned Did not appear Not aired/Not available V = Voiced C = Cameo F = Flashback I = Indirectly mentioned P = Pictured\n\nTraits Perceived by Other Characters as Annoying[]\n\nDue to his eccentric behavior and arrogance, Sheldon isn't well-liked by many people. Due to his belief that he's intellectually \"superior\", he's not ashamed to insult his own friends, like Leonard, whose work Sheldon deems derivative and who never appreciated his overbearing mother; Howard, who's merely an engineer and not a real scientist, and also doesn't possess a doctorate (despite the fact that engineering has more practical real-world applications, as well as more related jobs, than theoretical physics does, a fact that Sheldon doesn't take into account); and Penny, who Sheldon considers (and in some ways, is) the polar opposite of an intellectual. He often mocks her for having once dropped out of a community college. In \"The Thespian Catalyst\", Sheldon makes a speech to a class of bored and disinterested grad students, reminding them that they will never be as smart as he is. Teaching is something else that Sheldon fails at having no social skills.\n\nSheldon's obsession with routine constantly causes friction with him and his friends. In \"The Dumpling Paradox\", he has an issue with Penny sleeping on the couch, because he wants to watch Doctor Who and Penny is sleeping in his spot. Leonard offers some alternatives, but Sheldon refuses to accept them, because they're not part of his routine. In the same episode, he states that he, Leonard, and Raj can't order Chinese food without Howard. \"Basic math simply won't allow it\", as Sheldon puts it. Sheldon's routine is even written for everyone to view, except for 2:45 to 3:05 in the afternoons, where he spends some recreational time in a storage room in the Caltech basement. Even his recreational time is planned and he spends it doing the same thing—playing keepie uppie with a hacky sack.\n\nSheldon's also been shown to have issues with closure. An example of this is when he has a near meltdown when he learned that one of his favorite sci-fi shows, Alphas, had been cancelled after a cliffhanger. Amy tries to break him out of it using several exercises. Sheldon seems to overcome his closure issues, but after Amy leaves, he finishes all the exercises.\n\nAlso, due to his lack of emotion and his inability to understand sarcasm, Sheldon never seems to realize when he's in trouble. When other people get mad at him, he blames them (their inability to \"properly\" understand the situation or the fact that they can't control their emotions). In \"The Einstein Approximation\", Sheldon tries to get a menial job. The woman at the employment office doesn't understand his behavior, and when he tells her he works as a physicist at Caltech, she thinks he's crazy and calls security. Sheldon isn't fazed by this, because in his mind, he's done nothing wrong, and he casually waits for her to return so they can finish.\n\nSheldon has also been shown to be very impatient. This would come back to haunt him, as he'd hound Amy after she told him she needed space. Unable to understand this, he showed up after 11 hours, thinking that was enough time. He also continuously asked Amy whether or not they'd actually broken up without giving her time to think about it. He ultimately went too far, causing her to officially break up with him.\n\nSheldon can be selfish, evidenced when he ditched Raj while they were underground while only thinking of his own safety. He also says that the roommate agreement was made to get the right way and that the fact that \"his way\" is the right way's a happy coincidence. In the series finale, his victory of the Nobel Prize leads him to selfishly dismiss Howard's concerns for his kids and Howard says he and Bernadette were going home as a result, with Leonard and Penny joining cause of him dismissing Penny's pregnancy, only changing when Amy called him out on how he was treating their friends.\n\nChildlike Qualities[]\n\nSheldon also possesses many childlike qualities. For example, though unaware of it, he's extremely stubborn. Examples of this include naming the The Physics Bowl Quiz for Caltech, deciding to go to San Francisco by train instead of flying (due to his love of trains), his needing of his mother (or Penny) to care for him when he is sick, which involves singing \"Soft Kitty\", having his Homemade Soup made for him, and rubbing Vicks VapoRub on his chest. He cannot stand to be interrupted, concede when he doesn't know something, or hear people bicker or argue, which results in him crinkling his lips with intense frustration when any of these events occur. Sheldon hasn't attempted to obtain a driver's license (though he does possess a learner's permit) and needs his friends to drive him everywhere; he refuses to take the bus. He attempts to learn to drive on a simulator, but fails instantly. Sheldon's excuse for this is that he is \"too evolved\" to perform \"plebeian tasks\" such as driving. Amy eventually teaches him to drive which he does returning from the desert with Howard. He drives so fast that the police stops him and he just gives his license to the policeman permanently.\n\nIn Season 5's \"The Pulled Groin Extrapolation\", Amy asked Leonard to attend a wedding with her. Leonard asked why she did not ask Sheldon to go instead. Amy answered that Sheldon behaved like a child the last time so he is out. After Amy left, Sheldon said in a sing-song tone to Leonard; \"Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding!\" as he was unwrapping his newly bought toy train set, further emphasizing his childlike qualities (also revealing he didn't want to go anyway).\n\nHe has also shown some slightly childish fear. In the Season 2 Episode, \"The Euclid Alternative\", Sheldon mutters something that shows that he has a night-light (\"Maybe I could keep my sheets if I turn out the night-light\").\n\nHowever most of these problems can be traced back to his root personality fault of stubbornness.\n\nInterests[]\n\nLike his friends, he is scientifically inclined, and is fond of Comic Books, costumes, video games, flags and science fiction, specifically Battlestar Galactica, Doctor Who, the Stargate series, Star Trek, Star Wars, and Firefly, although he strongly dislikes Babylon 5 because he thinks it \"lacks scientific integrity\" and is \"derivative\". He has claimed to be an honorary graduate of Starfleet Academy, and is an avid fan of Science Officer Spock. Other favorite characters of his are Batman, Spider-Man, The Hulk, The Flash, Superman, and Frodo Baggins.\n\nHe likes playing Halo every Wednesday and paintball on the weekend with his friends. He can also play the piano and theremin, and seems to be a very good Tuvan throat singer, but would be better if not for a part in the Roommate Agreement denying him practice.\n\nSheldon also loves making agreements (Roommate Agreement, Relationship Agreement...), one of his dream was even to become a notary public, a dream that became true, as said in season 5. (« The Wiggly Finger Catalyst ») He had a former and very short-lived interest in acting after he lost a science fair.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nSheldon is a tall, lean, yet well-built man, originally in his late twenties, but he's in his late thirties by series end. He is 6'1\" (1.85 m) with brown hair and blue eyes. His wardrobe consists of vintage T-shirts (which he always wears over a long-sleeve shirt) adorned with references to superheroes, quantum physics, Sci-Fi television shows, and robots. Sheldon often expresses his mood through his choice of attire; especially his t-shirts. He's got a collection SO large in fact, that it has its own page. He also owns a dark blue plaid suit which he wears for lecturing and other formal occasions. Later he had a less loud suit.\n\nHe also appears to enjoy Reddit, as he has been seen with a Snoo (the Reddit mascot) shirt. He usually wears a long sleeve shirt underneath it along with plaid pants. Sheldon is tall and thin (setting him apart from his shorter colleagues), with Penny, and later Leonard, saying he looks like a giant praying mantis.\n\nIn Season 1 of Young Sheldon, Sheldon is a rather tall, skinny, adorable 9 year old kid (10 later on). He is about 4'5\" (1.35 m) and his hair is slightly brighter than in The Big Bang Theory. In fact, in The Big Bang Theory, while he is an adult, his fashion is more childlike; however, in Young Sheldon, while he is a kid, his fashion is more adult-like.\n\nDrugs and Alcohol[]\n\nWith few exceptions, Sheldon refuses all drugs, including alcohol and caffeine, as a promise to his mother (though it's suggested in \"The Codpiece Topology\" that he drinks Red Bull, which contains caffeine). In addition, when Penny mixed alcohol into his drink making it \"slutty\", he began to play the piano and sing \"To Life\" from the musical Fiddler on the Roof in front of an audience. A small amount of coffee made him extremely hyperactive, but unproductive in another episode. Taking Valium also affected his behavior. Probably the most infamous time of him being drunk was when he had to give a speech in \"The Pants Alternative\" and he acted like a comedian due to the abundance of wine he drank to calm his nerves. The scene was uploaded on YouTube where it is revealed Sheldon also took off his pants and mooned the audience. Howard once drugged him with his mother's sleep medication to get him to stop talking, but was unsuccessful. He exposed Penny's secret about her college career to Leonard.\n\nWhile it's argued that Sheldon drank beer in the Pilot, it's actually an orange soda (clearly seen when Leonard holds up his bottle in the hallway).\n\nHe does enjoy a Mountain Dew in \"The Vengeance Formulation\", one of the more caffeinated sodas, even calling it \"refreshing\". He also likes \"diet virgin Cuba Libres\", which is essentially a Diet Coke with a slice of lime. It appears that he can drink caffeinated beverages to a certain point, but not to the extent of coffee, which he considers a drug.\n\nIn \"The Habitation Configuration\" Penny serves him numerous glasses of Long Island Iced Tea, which he enjoys; however, he's unaware of the fact it's alcoholic (and not actually tea as he genuinely believes) and Penny makes no move to correct his assumption. This drastically affects his behavior to the point where he attempts to \"beat\" an apology out of Wil Wheaton.\n\nIn \"The Thanksgiving Decoupling\" he drinks beer with Bernadette's father since his own father died before they could do so. As a result, he became drunk and did numerous things, like burping pi, or as much as he could without throwing up, making fun of Howard's mother and her \"bathroom clowns\" by saying you could only fit one of her in a car, and insulting Howard, calling him the \"clown that came out of her\". After apologizing for his behavior, he sent Amy to get him and Mike beers and slapped her on the butt, much to her pleasure. Later, he threw up on the clowns in the bathroom.\n\nIn \"The Dependence Transcendence\", the Flash appears to a sleeping Sheldon and tells him that all superheroes use energy drinks and take performance-enhancing chemicals. The Hulk uses steroids and Batman stalks the night looking for fights because he drinks scotch. He gives Sheldon his first energy drink free because he invested his money in Marvel Comics, the rival comic book company. He goes hyper while working on their gyroscope miniaturization project and then drives everyone crazy thinking that he was addicted to energy drinks.\n\nSofter Side[]\n\nDespite his strange behavior, Sheldon has, at times, demonstrated a much softer side to himself. He does seem to be quite a heartwarming character; however, these moments are rather rare, and usually only reserved for those closest to him, such as his mother, Meemaw, Amy, and his friends.\n\nAlthough his friendship with Leonard is usually strained because of Sheldon's quirky behavior and weird habits, Sheldon has called Leonard \"his little buddy\", or something of the sort on multiple occasions. He also shows an obvious unease whenever his friendship with Leonard is threatened.\n\nSheldon's also shown friendly acts of caring towards Penny. In one instance, when Penny was low on money, Sheldon let her borrow a large amount of his savings, but while she worried about paying it back, he was entirely unconcerned as to when he got it back. Sheldon's willingness to lend money to others was later described by Leonard as \"one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to, you know, kill him\". Also, after Penny let him stay at her place when he locked himself out of his apartment, Sheldon sincerely thanked her for it.\n\nWhen Penny fell and dislocated her shoulder, Sheldon spent the entire night taking care of her, including driving her to the hospital despite the fact that he does not know how to drive. He finished the night by helping her into bed and singing \"Soft Kitty\" to her after she asked him to. He also hugged Penny again when she said she would talk to Leonard about having him take Sheldon to Switzerland rather than her. This prompted him to sincerely thank her and hug her. When Howard's mother died, Howard fell into a depression as Sheldon told him he understood his pain as he lost his own father and though he didn't have friends at the time to help, Howard did causing the latter to smile as these comforting words. This was one of Sheldon's kindest moments as all his friends expected him to be rude especially Leonard and Penny who were moved by his words.\n\nWith the exception of his family, Penny, Wil Wheaton, Amy and Leonard are the only people Sheldon have hugged. With Amy, he specifically cuddled with her in the episode \"The Isolation Permutation\", after a discussion to console a weepy Amy who was craving human intimacy and physical contact. After turning down Amy's previous proposals of getting into bed together and French-kissing, Sheldon agreed with her final offer to cuddle, though he got upset over it later, by yelling at Leonard and Howard to keep Penny and Bernadette in line and have them apologize to Amy since consoling Amy had caused him to miss the time he had designated to solve Space-time Geometry in Higher Spin Gravity and building his Lego Death Star. This particular event of him cuddling with Amy is a huge development of his personality since he is not shown to have much empathy or sympathy for others. Amy is his one big exception.\n\nHis caring attitude towards Amy is also exemplified when he buys her a diamond tiara as a form of apology after having a fight regarding the importance of Amy's accomplishment when her research made the cover of a noteworthy science magazine. In another instance, Sheldon acted disrespectfully in Amy's laboratory when he was taking his required vacation time. The next day, however, he returns and after a few attempts, meekly apologizes to Amy, showing a vulnerable side of him that isn't usually seen considering his egotistical attitude. Perhaps the greatest leap forward in Sheldon's willingness to show his softer, more emotional side to Amy is when he voluntarily, without any prior prompt from Amy, held Amy's hand while Howard's Soyuz Rocket was being launched into space. Amy was shocked at this, since Sheldon had acted confused and oblivious when she had tried holding his hand in \"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis\". In season 6, he objects to Amy making him hold hands as he considers it unhygienic. He also takes care of her when she was sick even though he first starts to leave and then thinks better of himself.\n\nAfter 8 seasons, he finally enjoys making out with Amy after being disturbed by it. On Amy's birthday, he decided to have coitus with her in season 9 to show her how much he cared for her. He later admitted that he gets turned on by interaction with her in season 10. Shamy seems to get turned on discussing or arguing about science.\n\nA long time ago, he always had been rude and offended a lot of people. Mostly he never apologizes for being a jerk. In later seasons, he started maturing and starts apologizing to people every time he is being a jerk or being rude when somebody tells him. In the series finale, he was going to make a self-centered speech when he won the Nobel Prize and rub it in the fact that he won in people's face. Instead he thanked his friends and his family for making him a better person and helping him and tolerating him all the way up to winning the Nobel prize alongside apologizing for his poor treatment of his friends earlier.\n\nReligion[]\n\nIn contrast to his profoundly religious mother and devout evangelistic Baptist upbringing, Sheldon has no interest in religion - he tends to ignore or express dislike for religious celebrations such as Christmas, and wastes no time in bringing up the Pagan origins to each festival. Additionally, his scientific beliefs often come into conflict with the spiritual beliefs of his mother, Mary. Nevertheless, he has an agreement with his mother to attend church once a year, and once exclaims \"Thank you, Jesus!\" upon getting a strike in a bowling match against Wil Wheaton (his arch-enemy). His attitude towards God has been hinted at being of an Agnostic nature, when in the episode \"The Zarnecki Incursion\" he says \"Why hast thou forsaken me deity whose existence I doubt...\" Raj stated that one of the instance where Sheldon got food poisoning and he was \"praying to the god he doesn't believe in to end it quickly\". When he sees his mother having sex, he is very concerned about the hypocrisy shown by his mother having relations outside of marriage yet expounding the Bible to him throughout his childhood, even going as far to declare \"don't turn to him, he's mad with you\" when his mother uttered \"oh dear Lord\" during the conversation. He possesses knowledge of other religions and denominations, such as Hinduism, Judaism, Catholicism (a denomination of Christianity)\n\nLegal Issues[]\n\nSheldon also appears to have problems understanding the law at times. Sometimes, his expertise of lock-picking gets him in trouble. He is shown to drop objects out his window into traffic without any regard, in addition to breaking into buildings. He has also been seen going into various places, such as a kid's ball pit, and even began working at the Cheesecake Factory without being granted permission. He has expertise with picking locks and disarming alarm systems. Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security notifies his mother when he acts contrary to federal law. As he states later, \"Apparently, you can't hack into a top-secret government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.\" This implies that Homeland Security is familiar with him, as instead of arresting and questioning him, they simply informed his mother and let her deal with him. He also states that he has been arrested for jaywalking when he said to a police officer \"You just saw me jaywalk, aren't you going to arrest me. Maybe I should arrest you for impersonating a police officer\". Another notable trouble with the law involves Sheldon going to court for running a red light when taking Penny to the emergency room. This resulted in Sheldon being found guilty and forced to pay the cashier, only for him to insult the judge and being thrown in jail simply because he refused to apologize for his comments. In addition to apologizing to the traffic court judge and paying the fine, Sheldon was forced to accept three points on his non-existent driver's license. Despite these legal mistakes, Sheldon is not above turning his friends and family in for breaking the law.\n\nTraits[]\n\nSheldon has qualities include social ineptitude and many more traits which make him the most eccentric and bizarre of the characters in the show. The writers did not want to identify his condition and have people disagree with his future actions as not consistent with the medical condition. Many of these traits are the reasons why Leonard finds him hard to live with and his friends find him so hard to be around. These include:\n\nObsessive–compulsive disorder: Sheldon exhibits a strict adherence to routine, such as doing specific recreational activities on specific days of the week, going to the bathroom on a specific time every morning, eating specific food items on specific days, being unable to reconcile changes to food orders, doing laundry on a specific day and time (every Saturday night at 8:15), knocking on the door a certain number of times while repeating the name of the person he is seeking with a particular frequency (\"[knock knock knock] Penny [knock knock knock] Penny [knock knock knock] Penny\" being the most common) or sitting in one spot not allowing any one else to sit there. Amy Farrah Fowler notifies this to Sheldon as a symptom of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and she finds he is in denial over it. Sheldon labels all home utensils, appliances, etc., including his label maker. He also makes loud noises (or musical notes with a toy xylophone) in every theater before a movie, attempting to locate the \"acoustic sweet spot\"; however, he can adapt to seats with sub-optimal conditions, such as suitable cushion densities and light dispersion, provided he has the opportunity to test them. Ironically, Sheldon has actually displayed great resilience in cases where his routines and/or living conditions have been severely altered. An example is the expedition to the North Pole; while Leonard, Raj, and Howard all thought it was horrible, he thought it was \"a hoot and a half\". Another is \"The Bozeman Reaction\", when he is able to stay awake long after his usual sleep time out of fear that the apartment will be burglarized. He also makes a habit of comparing his petty dilemmas with more serious situations and events, such as:\n\nSending \"samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on [his] front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis\" to the FBI Crime Lab and stupidly expecting a response (after 18 years, he, unsurprisingly, still hasn't heard back yet).\n\nCalling Pest Control when a bluejay appeared outside his window, and admitting on the phone that he would have called the police if it was actually inside the apartment.\n\nCalling the FBI when his World of Warcraft account had been hacked, then calling the local police when the former predictably hung up on him.\n\nComparing being dragged to the Wolowitz House to being treated like a black slave.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder: Though not technically meeting all of the requirements for a formal diagnosis, Sheldon constantly points out his superiority among his friends and belittles everyone at regular intervals. Sheldon does not treat anyone as his equal, and believes that only his ideas are right. Two exceptions are Stephen Hawking and Amy Farrah Fowler. As a result, he does not take the suggestions of others seriously. He also refuses to admit he did anything wrong, often blaming mistakes on trivial reasons and just says \"Oh.\". Sheldon even admitted he was an egomaniac while drunk once in \"The Habitation Configuration\", although he quickly took it back. This implies he's at least somewhat aware of how he acts, but normally subconsciously denies it.\n\nAphephobia: Sheldon can display symptoms of aphephobia, the fear of human contact. Sheldon admits this in \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\" stating he's been afraid of all forms of physical contact since childhood; however he also reveals he's been purposely trying to overcome it for Amy's sake.\n\nMysophobia: He is constantly worried about others touching his food, washes his hands as often as he can, and showers twice daily. Leonard used his concerns for food to mock him in \"The Einstein Approximation\", as did Raj in \"The Engagement Reaction\". Penny has stated that he still has not learned to not to insult those who handle his food, to which Amy Farrah Fowler agrees. For example, when Penny touched one of his onion rings and put it back, Sheldon threw out all of the onion rings, saying that she had \"contaminated their integrity.\" He does not seem to do much when Penny implies that she spits on his hamburger at the Cheesecake Factory. When Sheldon was making a video for his future crazy self, he tells himself that he can accept any food that Penny gives him.\n\nOrnithophobia: Sheldon has had horrible experiences with birds in his past, which has led to ornithophobia (a fear of birds). When Sheldon was a toddler, a hummingbird, which he describes as the vampire of the flower world, dived down into his stroller and tried to get at his apple juice in his Sippy cup. When he was seven, his neighbor's chicken got loose and chased him up the big elm tree in front of his house. When he was twelve, a magpie tried to take his retainer out of his mouth and when he was 16, a parrot in the pet store window called him \"fat ass\". In Florida he was attacked by a seagull on the beach. This even caused him to fear (and have nightmares of) Sesame Street's Big Bird and put creator Jim Henson on his enemies list. He finally overcame this fear after he was forced to confront a black-throated Magpie-Jay.\n\nHypochondriasis: He is extremely terrified about becoming sick. He became worried about Penny infecting him with influenza and subsequently contracted it. Another time, he wanted a full medical examination by Leonard's girlfriend, Dr. Stephanie Barnett, in order to discover the cause of a high-pitched noise in his head. This was later used against him by saying that he had an inflamed larynx and that he needed to stop talking immediately. When Howard's mother is sent to the hospital, Sheldon refuses to go due to exposure to pathogens and germs, until Penny confronts him. Though, he accidentally wanders into a bio-hazard room at the hospital, after fearing the restroom's cleanliness, and endures a two-week quarantine. Sheldon showers twice a day and washes his hands as often as he can. In addition, Sheldon has a red toothbrush that is kept in a Plexiglas® case under a UV lamp.\n\nInability to lie: When Sheldon is complicit in a lie; he exhausts all of his efforts in his almost always unsuccessful attempt to make it believable. Similarly, he cannot be entrusted with a secret because he develops nervous tics; however, it is easier for him to lie if he has prior knowledge of the deception or an \"ironclad alibi\" thought out in advance, as opposed to it being \"impromptu dishonesty\". Penny taught him a way to lie using sarcasm.\n\nIntolerance of people in his bedroom: One time, he was distraught when Penny entered his room in the middle of the night. On another occasion, Sheldon hesitantly let Penny in his bedroom to get a key for his desk to retrieve a USB flash drive, constantly reminding her that, far from creating a permanent easement, it was only one-time permission; however, he doesn't seem to mind giving up his room to a guest as in \"The Psychic Vortex\", he had no problem with letting Martha sleep in his room while he went to do so in Leonard's room instead. Likewise he also gave up his room to Elizabeth in \"The Plimpton Stimulation\". This probably due to his southern heritage.\n\nStage fright: While perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups, Sheldon cannot speak to crowds deemed large enough to trample him (36 adults or 70 children) without having a panic attack or fainting.\n\nHemophobia: He has fainted at the sight of his own blood. This might just be part of his over active feelings of self-preservation though, as he didn't seem to have a problem seeing Howard or Leonard's blood.\n\nFear of traffic accidents: In \"The Adhesive Duck Deficiency,\" Sheldon laments the irony of possibly dying in a car accident while driving Penny to the hospital. In \"The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification,\" while Leonard is driving Sheldon's Mobile Virtual Presence Device, he relishes the ability to enjoy being a \"passenger\" without the threat of a car accident. In \"The Euclid Alternative,\" he refuses to ride a bus due to the lack of seatbelts and told he was forced to leave a bus after attempting to use bungee cords as seat restraints. This likely also stems from his self-preservation. This is also a likely factor to why he has yet to proceed his driving license past a learner's permit.\n\nPossible sadistic/psychopathic tendencies: Although Sheldon has never actually done anything psychopathic, particularly in the later season, he often implies, and sometimes directly states (always casually) a preference for cruel methods, or even killing. For example, his suggestion to the problem of the elderly being alien to new technology, is to publicly execute a few to give the others some incentive to learn. He also suggested they kill Leonard's old bully when he stayed the night with them, pointing out they had the greatest opportunity to do so. He also mentioned he would like to put, and leave, Amy in a stockade in a public square, for lying to him. On one notable occasion, he even (admittedly half-heartedly) attempted to poison Kripke, when he wouldn't let him have Professor Rothman's office. As Sheldon doesn't lie, and doesn't understand sarcasm, it can be taken he is generally serious.\n\nHe also keeps a record of what he considers faux pas \"strikes\", which he allocates to those who violate his self-imposed conditions. Upon receiving three strikes, Sheldon gives them the choice of apologizing, being \"banished\" from the apartment for a year, or taking a \"class\". For many of the aforementioned characteristics, Sheldon's friends often consider him \"insane\" or \"crazy\" despite Sheldon's repetition of another catchphrase \"I'm not insane/crazy! My mother had me tested.\" His mother later confirms this to Leonard; the doctor said he was sane, but she regretted not following up with a specialist in Houston.\n\nDespite Sheldon's personality disorders and difficult habits, his friends usually just do what he says because it is easier. In the final episode Sheldon learns that his friends only tolerate him because they kn"
