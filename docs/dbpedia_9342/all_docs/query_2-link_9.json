Tributes poured in from celebrities and other journalists alike recognizing Walters for her trailblazing nature and contributions to culture.\n\n02 of 108\n\nPope Benedict XVI\n\nThe Pope emeritus, who served as pope from 2005 until 2013 until he stepped away from the position due to health reasons (becoming the first pope to resign from his position since Gregory XII in 1415) died at age 95 on Dec. 31.\n\n\"To love the church also means having the courage to take difficult decisions,\" he said at the time of his resignation. He continued to serve in a reduced clerical role until recent health issues caused him to retreat from the public eye.\n\n03 of 108\n\nPelé\n\nBrazilian soccer legend Pelé died on Dec. 29 at age 82.\n\nThe three-time World Cup champion had been undergoing treatment for colon cancer since September 2021, when he had a tumor removed from his large intestine.\n\n\"Inspiration and love marked the journey of King Pelé, who peacefully passed away today,\" a message on his Instagram page read Thursday. \"On his journey, Edson enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love.\n\n\"His message today becomes a legacy for future generations,\" it continued. \"Love, love and love, forever.\"\n\nPelé is survived by his six children and his wife, businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.\n\n04 of 108\n\n05 of 108\n\nKirstie Alley\n\nCheers and Drop Dead Gorgeous star Kirstie Alley succumbed to colon cancer on Dec. 5.

It was the episode where Tom Berenger proposes to Kirstie, who keeps saying no, even though she desperately wants to say yes,\" the actor revealed. \"Kirstie was truly brilliant in it. Her ability to play a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown was both moving and hysterically funny.\"\n\nFor his part, Grammer kept his tribute short and sweet telling PEOPLE, \"​​I always believed grief for a public figure is a private matter, but I will say I loved her.\"\n\n\"Kirstie was a unique and wonderful person and friend,\" Pelman said in her statement. \"Her joy of being was boundless. We became friends almost instantly when she joined the cast of Cheers. She loved kids and my kids loved her too. We had sleepovers at her house, with treasure hunts that she created.\"\n\n06 of 108\n\nStephen 'tWitch' Boss\n\nFormer Ellen Show DJ and So You Think You Can Dance alum, Stephen 'tWitch' Boss died by suicide the morning of Dec. 14.\n\nAccording to TMZ, tWitch's wife, Allison Holker Boss, ran into an LAPD station distraught because her husband left their home without a car and had been unreachable.

He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.\"\n\nEllen Degeneres, who had remained friends with Boss since he taught her a routine for the season 8 premiere of The Ellen Degeneres Show, also paid her respects on social media.\n\n\"Right now what I want to do is remember all the love and laughter I had with tWitch,\" the comedian posted on her Instagram page. \"He brought so much joy to my life. I know he brought joy to yours too. I'm going to be sharing some of my favorite moments with him.

I live in Seattle, Washington. I am Grant Wahl's brother. I am gay, I am the reason he wore the rainbow shirt to the World Cup,\" Eric revealed on Instagram. \"My brother was healthy, he told me he received death threats. I do not believe my brother just died. I believe he was killed, and I just beg for any help.\"\n\nHowever, several days later, it was revealed the award-winning journalist suffered from an aortic aneurysm.\n\n\"Grant died from the rupture of a slowly growing, undetected ascending aortic aneurysm with hemopericardium,\" Grant's wife Dr. Céline Gounder wrote on his Substack. \"The chest pressure he experienced shortly before his death may have represented the initial symptoms. No amount of CPR or shocks would have saved him.\"\n\nShe clarified, \"His death was unrelated to COVID. His death was unrelated to vaccination status. There was nothing nefarious about his death.\"\n\n09 of 108\n\nQueen Elizabeth\n\nJust over a year after the passing of Prince Phillip, Buckingham Palace announced Queen Elizabeth II had died on Sept. 8.

He attended the event with fellow group member, Quavo, who didn't sustain any injuries during the incident.\n\n\"This whole time I've been trying to figure out what you really are to me because nephew wasn't it. We hated the word 'nephew' or when they said 'Unc and Phew' because we always knew we were way closer than that and it made me feel old too,\" Quavo wrote in a heartfelt Instagram dedication.\n\nHe continued, \"Now I finally get it… you are OUR angel watching me and watching us this whole time in living form, making sure EVERYONE FELT UR LOVE AND HUGS while u here and u made our dreams come true.\"\n\n11 of 108\n\nBob Saget\n\nBob Saget, stand-up comedian and actor famous for his roles on Full House, How I Met Your Mother, and America's Funniest Home Videos, died on Jan. 9 at the age of 65.\n\nThe comedian was found dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando on the afternoon of Jan. 9 following a performance in Jacksonville, Florida, the night before.\n\nFollowing news of his death, the late Full House star's family released a statement.\n\n\"We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today.
