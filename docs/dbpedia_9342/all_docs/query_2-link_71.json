        "text": "Drinks on a cruise ship aren't cheap, so if you can get free drinks, you could significantly cut down on your bar bill.\n\nWith cocktails on a Royal Caribbean cruise costing $14 and beers as much as $7.99, enjoying a few drinks every day on your cruise can get expensive.\n\nRoyal Caribbean includes some drinks with your cruise fare, but soft drinks, cocktails, beer, and mocktails all cost extra. Each beverage you order that isn't included comes with an automatic 18% gratuity on top of the base cost.\n\nLuckily, there are some easy (and not so easy) ways to get free drinks on a Royal Caribbean cruise that almost anyone can take advantage of and save money along the way.\n\nBook a suite\n\nOne easy way to get free drinks is to pay for a Royal Caribbean suite.\n\nIf you book a Grand Suite or higher cabin, one of the many suite perks you get are complimentary alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages each evening in the Suite Lounge.\n\nDepending on which ship you sail, there are different hours where there's an open bar for suite guests. On Icon and Oasis Class ships, the Suite Lounge serves complimentary beer and wine between 11am and 11pm, with cocktails offered between 4:30pm and 8:00pm.\n\nOn other ships, there's a happy hour for complimentary drinks in the evening that begins around 5pm and ends around 8pm.\n\nThere are two downsides to booking a suite for free drinks. First, you have to pay more to get a suite. Suites can cost a lot and it may still be cheaper to book a standard cabin and pay out of pocket for your drinks.\n\nThe other issue is the free drinks are only available in the Suite Lounge and at limited hours. So when you're at the pool, at a show, or anywhere else on the ship, you're out of luck unless you're willing to walk back to the Suite Lounge.\n\nOf course, you could go for the very top end of Royal Caribbean's suite program and book a Star Class suite.\n\nStar Class suites are the largest suites offered, and they include a complimentary Royal Caribbean drink package.\n\nRead more: A beginner's guide to sailing in Star Class\n\nBecome a Diamond member\n\nMy favorite way to get free drinks on any Royal Caribbean ship is to take advantage of arguably the best customer loyalty perk offered by any cruise line, daily free drinks for Diamond members and above.\n\nIf you can reach Diamond status within the Crown and Anchor Society, you'll get 4 drink vouchers per day, per person to enjoy at any bar, and at any time.\n\nThe vouchers are digital, and you just need to ask the bartender or waiter to use one.\n\nI love this benefit because it works on every cruise and at any bar.\n\nRead more: Crown and Anchor perks you should use on every Royal Caribbean cruise\n\nThe drawback to the Diamond drink vouchers is you need to cruise enough with Royal Caribbean to attain that status. You need 80 points in their customer loyalty program to qualify, and if you booked you and your family in a balcony cabin, you would need to sail on 12 week-long cruises before you hit that number.\n\nThe Diamond drink vouchers won't benefit anyone new to Royal Caribbean, but if you've cruised a few times before, it could be a target for you to hit in the near future.\n\nRead more: 6 ways you should change how you cruise once you hit Diamond\n\nAttend the art auction\n\nAnyone in any cabin or loyalty status can get free champagne by going to one of the art auctions onboard.\n\nArt auctions are where you can bid for pieces of art to have shipped to your house. Art auctions have been around for years, and since it's a niche interest activity, they offer complimentary champagne if you attend.\n\nArt auctions are only held a few times per sailing, and once the auction ends, so does the champagne.\n\nAttend the Top Tier event\n\nAnother opportunity to get a few mixed drinks once per cruise is to go to the Top Tier event held on cruises longer than 4-nights for members of the Crown and Anchor Society.\n\nIt's for anyone that's reached Platinum status, which requires just 30 points.\n\nTop Tier is an event that recognizes the loyalty of Royal Caribbean's customers, and they serve various mixed drinks and champagne during the event.\n\nDuring Top Tier, the Captain, Hotel Director, and Cruise Director make speeches thanking cruisers and recognizing specific ones that have cruised a lot. Usually the house band plays some music and some of the entertainers perform a number.\n\nGamble in the casino\n\nIf you're willing to potentially lose money in the casino, there is an upside to that gambling.\n\nGambling is addictive and dangerous, so please exercise caution, but if you're comfortable with gambling, Royal Caribbean's Casino Royale will give you free drinks for an entire year if you gamble enough.\n\nThe casino has its own customer loyalty program, and if you can get 2500 points within one year between April 1st and March 31st, you'll get unlimited free drinks at the casino bar.\n\nYou can accumulate the 2500 points over different sailings, but once you get the total points, the drink benefit becomes active immediately.\n\nSimilar to the Suite Lounge, you can only get free drinks at the casino and no where else on the ship.\n\nThe other downside to this is you might lose money. In fact, you should expect to lose a lot of money before you reach 2500 points. If you play slot machines, you'll earn 1 point for every 5 dollars you wager, so you can do the math on that.\n\nNonetheless, free drinks in the casino (along with the free cruise you'll also earn when you reach Prime status) is a very lucrative offer, especially for those that cruise a lot.\n\nTip the bartender\n\nAn old school strategy for getting a free drink here or there is to tip your bartender.\n\nIt's not as straight forward as the other ways mentioned in this article, but it could work for you. Basically, find a bartender you like, tip them well, and maybe you get a free drink here or there.\n\nI wouldn't call this a primary strategy for free drinks, rather, something to keep in mind. It works well for casual drinkers.\n\nEven if you don't get any free drinks, you're almost certainly going to get faster service and that makes a difference when the bar gets busy.\n\nBring your own wine\n\nA tried-and-true way to drink for free on a Royal Caribbean cruise is bring your own wine.\n\nYou can bring one bottle of wine (or champagne) per adult on embarkation day, and then enjoy the wine anywhere on the ship.\n\nThere's theoretically a corkage fee if you have the wine opened at a bar or restaurant, but it's been my experience that has rarely been enforced.\n\nNot only will this allow you to have wine without paying Royal Caribbean's prices, but you can bring the exact brand and type you prefer.\n\nOf course, you're still paying for the wine when you buy it at home, but you'll probably get a better deal at your wine store than on the ship.\n\nRead more: How to Cheat The Royal Caribbean Drink Package\n\nBook a shore excursion that includes drinks\n\nMany shore excursions in the Caribbean include free drinks, such as a rum punch or margaritas.\n\nI've seen free drinks served on boats, catamarans, ferries, trains, and at the beach. You might consider booking a tour that brings you to a fun spot and also serves complimentary booze too.\n\nThere are also all-inclusive beach excursions you can book where it's essentially an open bar when you get there. Day passes to beach resorts are a popular choice for time ashore, and some of the best ones tend to be in Mexico.\n\n...or just buy a drink package\n\nIf all of this sounds cumbersome, expensive, or not enough to really make a dent in your bar bill, you might be better off paying for a Royal Caribbean drink package.\n\nRead more: Everything you need to know about a drink package\n\nDrink packages aren't cheap, but they're also a better deal for anyone that might have more than 4 cocktails per day.\n\nThe advantage of getting a beverage package is you will cap your bar bill and be able to enjoy unlimited drinks. No bar tab, no regret choosing a cocktail you don't like, and no hoops to jump through.\n\nMoreover, some drink packages include drinks beyond booze, such as sodas, premium coffees, bottled water, and juice.\n\nDutch environmental protesters have prevented and delayed two Royal Caribbean cruise ships from docking in Amsterdam.\n\nOn August 10, Extinction Rebellion blocked the locks needed for Jewel of the Seas to safely pass through to the port. Instead, the ship was forced to disembark in Ijmuiden about 25 miles from Amsterdam.\n\nThe activist group took responsibility for the protest on their website, stating they demanded an immediate cessation of the destructive cruise industry because of the harm it causes to the environment and its impact on human health.\n\nAccording to Travel Market Report, they delayed Regent's Seven Seas Mariner by about three hours one day later.\n\nMost recently, Extinction Rebellion returned and delayed Serenade of the Seas' arrival. Footage shared to their live stream channel shows the 90,090 gross registered ton ship attempting to dock. Unsuccessful, the mooring ropes were retracted before Serenade of the Seas backed out of the port into open water.\n\nCarlijn van Essen, a spokeswoman for the Port of Amsterdam, confirmed the Radiance Class ship could eventually resume its route, as Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.\n\nThe article continued to explain how police arrived on the scene around 5:00pm to remove eight protestors. They were taken into custody but have been released. A police spokesperson confirmed no arrests were made.\n\nSerenade of the Seas was initially scheduled to arrive in Amsterdam on August 19. However, amidst the disruptions caused by the environmental group, the ship canceled its call at Bergen, Norway, and headed to Amsterdam on August 18.\n\n\"We are on Serenade OTS anchored in open water today. The port of Bergen Norway was cancelled on the 'Ultimate Fjords Cruise' so we could attempt to get to Amsterdam and dock early,\" shared Doug_Texas on Royal Caribbean Blog's discussion forum.\n\n\"The climate change protesters are [gluing] themselves to the docks and shutting everything down. Already Jewel OTS was blocked as well as Regent Navigator...This is sad to see\"\n\nTikTok user @LittleRatBrain shared footage captured onboard Serenade of the Captain's announcement, in which he explains the goal of arriving before noon and giving passengers an overnight stay.\n\nSurprisingly, many of the comments support Extinction Rebellion. \"I don't blame them,\" wrote TofuNinja, \"It's a beautiful place being ruined by large cruise ships.\"\n\n\"Much as I enjoy your account, I completely support these protesters,\" added lolantherosa.\n\nKatie b said, \"I support these protestors. Cruises are disgusting and pollute the ocean.\"\n\nThe protests come a little over one month after the City of Amsterdam announced they'll cap cruise ship visits to just 100 per year (down from 190) starting in 2026. By 2035, the city will end all ocean-going cruise visits.\n\nAccording to Cruise Mapper, the next ship scheduled to arrive in Amsterdam is Jewel of the Seas on August 22, with Norwegian Prima arriving the following day at 7:00am local time.\n\nAnti-tourism protests aren't new in Europe\n\nEarlier this summer, thousands of protestors marched through Barcelona, soaking vacationers with water guns while they dined al fresco in Las Ramblas. The angry locals were chanting \"tourists go home,\" CNN reported.\n\nThe Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turístic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth) has published 13 proposals to reduce the number of visitors and create a new tourism model, including more regulation for tourist accommodations and the closure of cruise ship terminals.\n\nBy November 2028, Barcelona also plans to end short-term rentals to help ensure residents aren't displaced by \"overtourism.\" Reuters reported that the city will revoke all 10,101 apartment licenses approved as short-term rentals.\n\nIn April, a protest took place in the Canary Islands. Locals blamed visitors for increasing the cost of living, pricing them out of their homes, and causing environmental damage.\n\nBefore that, 15,000 people demanded affordable housing while protesting mass tourism in Málaga, as reported by Euronews.\n\n\"Now the city centre is a theme park for tourists,” one of the protestors, Jose, 60, told the news outlet, \"What was once ‘El Café Central’ in Málaga’s main square...is an Irish pub full of tourists.”\n\n“I’m not against tourism, but there has to be a limit and control,\" he says.\n\nSerenade of the Seas is nearing the end of its 274-day Ultimate World Cruise\n\nSerenade of the Seas set sail from Miami, Florida, on December 10, 2023, on an epic 9-month journey. There's less than one month to go, with the cruise concluding on September 10.\n\nThe cruise was slated to sail to over 150 destinations in 65 countries, visiting 11 Great Wonder of the World including the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, and Great Barrier Reef.\n\nWhile inclement weather and political disruptions have caused them to adjust the itinerary, most notably to Africa to avoid the Red Sea, it's been a memorable experience for those onboard.\n\nIn addition to changes in the itinerary, the Ultimate World Cruise has seen its fair share of drama, from an unexpected passenger death to a TikTok user-made bingo card with scenarios that could happen onboard (including a pirate takeover, COVID outbreak, and a minor mystery to solve).\n\nThough nothing's been confirmed regarding dates or ship, Michael Bayley, Royal Caribbean International's President and CEO, said they'd do another Ultimate World Cruise, despite the challenges associated with planning one.\n\nRead more: A passenger on the 9-month cruise is halfway done and lists what they like and don't like about the trip so far\n\nThey say the grass is always greener on the other side, and after twenty Royal Caribbean cruises, I booked my first Celebrity cruise. I thought I was ready for a change, but my seven nights onboard solidified my preference for Royal Caribbean.\n\nI’ve been mostly “Loyal to Royal” ever since my first Royal Caribbean cruise three years ago. Even though I’ve occasionally ventured to other cruise lines, such as Princess and MSC, I’ve always found myself returning to my cruising roots.\n\nRoyal Caribbean, in my opinion, has the most innovative ships at sea. I’ve never once had a bad experience onboard, even when cruising on the line’s oldest and smallest ships. With high quality entertainment, top-notch dining, and a diverse array of onboard thrills, I had little reason to look elsewhere for a cruise vacation.\n\nThroughout the past year, however, several of my fellow Royal Caribbean Blog writers have tried Celebrity Cruises for the first time. Reading about their experiences, I was intrigued by the cruise line’s unique itineraries, adult-focused ships, and more upscale atmosphere.\n\nSo when planning a summer cruise to Europe, I booked a 7-night Norwegian Fjords cruise on Celebrity Silhouette. I figured it was time to experience what Celebrity was all about.\n\nI boarded my first Celebrity cruise feeling optimistic about my next week onboard, but I quickly realized that I preferred Royal Caribbean.\n\nFrom the lucrative loyalty status perks to dining options, here’s why I’m going back to Royal Caribbean for my next cruise.\n\nCrown & Anchor Society offers more useful benefits compared to Captain’s Club\n\nRoyal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises enable guests to match their loyalty status from one cruise line to the other, but the benefits are not equal. For my travel style, I find Royal Caribbean’s Crown & Anchor Society offers more lucrative benefits.\n\nAs a Diamond Plus member with Royal Caribbean, my status was matched to Celebrity’s Elite Plus status. This meant I could enjoy access to exclusive parties, a continental breakfast in a specialty restaurant each morning, discounts on select add-ons, and two complimentary bags of laundry, among other benefits.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Cruises Captain's Club loyalty program info, tips & secrets\n\nI appreciated the benefits not offered by Royal Caribbean, including a free day of access to the ship's thermal suite and a complimentary scoop of gelato at the gelateria. That being said, I didn’t make use of all the benefits, especially because my travel partner did not have status in the Captain’s Club, so I didn’t care to go to private events alone.\n\nI missed certain aspects of Royal Caribbean’s Crown & Anchor Society while on Celebrity, like grabbing evening hors d'oeuvres in the Crown Lounge and using my buy one, get one free benefit at specialty restaurants.\n\nMost of all, though, I missed my free Diamond drinks.\n\nMy favorite benefit of Royal Caribbean’s Crown & Anchor Society are the Diamond drink vouchers, which offer a number of complimentary drinks each day depending on your loyalty status. As a Diamond Plus member, I receive five drink vouchers a day.\n\nOnboard a Royal Caribbean cruise, I can use these drink vouchers whenever and wherever I want with very few restrictions. In addition, the vouchers can be used ashore at Perfect Day at CocoCay. I’m not a huge drinker, but I love utilizing the Diamond drink vouchers to sample cocktails around the ship, whether it be the Toasted Marshmallow Old Fashioned or Cucumber Martini.\n\nRelated: 21 best drinks to order if you have a cruise drink package\n\nCelebrity Cruises also provides a drink benefit to those with Elite status and higher, but it pales in comparison to what Royal Caribbean offers.\n\nYou can order drinks from a Happy Hour menu from 5-7PM each evening. While you can enjoy as many drinks as you'd like during this time, the selection of beverages is extremely limited.\n\nForget trying the Martini Bar’s inventive Bananas Foster cocktail or a refreshing piña colada on the pool deck. The happy hour drinks were far more basic, such as a vodka soda or glass of wine.\n\nI was still grateful to receive complimentary beverages during my sailing, but I really missed the flexibility of the Crown & Anchor Society’s drink benefit.\n\nI thought I would prefer an adult-focused cruise, but I missed Royal Caribbean’s onboard activities\n\nAs a 20-something without kids, I occasionally find Royal Caribbean’s family-friendly atmosphere—particularly on the cruise line’s newest ships—unnecessary for my travel style. While I would have loved that carousel and trendy teen club as a kid, these features don’t necessarily appeal to me as an adult.\n\nNevertheless, it’s pretty easy to “escape” the kid-focused activities on Royal Caribbean’s ships. Most of these amenities are located in a few select areas of the ship, and by venturing elsewhere, you can find a quieter, adult-centered experience onboard.\n\nRelated: The best Royal Caribbean cruise ships for adults\n\nEven so, the lack of family-focused activities on Celebrity Cruises caught my eye. Although the cruise line still has a kids club and activities like family karaoke, there’s a noticeable lack of thrilling attractions like water slides and zip lines on Celebrity’s ships.\n\nI thought this would make the cruise more enjoyable as an adult traveler, since there would be (presumably) fewer screaming kids running around the ship.\n\nInstead, I found myself missing Royal Caribbean’s unique attractions during my Celebrity cruise. Despite attending activities like watercolor class, trivia, and a murder mystery game show, I actually missed my workouts on Royal Caribbean’s rock climbing wall and afternoon rounds of mini golf.\n\nIt’s easy to assume activities like the FlowRider, indoor skydiving simulator, and bumper cars are meant for children, but these activities are a lot of fun for adults, too.\n\nDuring my seven nights on Celebrity Silhouette, I came to the realization that I prefer high-energy, active activities onboard a cruise ship instead of just sitting on a chair for a round of trivia.\n\nIt’s unlikely that Celebrity will ever offer these types of thrills in the future, so I’ll probably book my future cruises with Royal Caribbean instead despite the higher number of kids and families onboard.\n\nIt’s hard to beat the variety of entertainment on Royal Caribbean\n\nAfter sailing on five separate cruise lines, Royal Caribbean's entertainment has been the crème de la crème.\n\nEntertainment is always quite low on my list of reasons to book a particular ship or cruise line. I always appreciate the amount of theater shows available while cruising, but if I’m being honest, I don’t always attend the shows. Most evenings I prefer listening to music at a bar instead or lounging on the outdoor decks to watch the sunset.\n\nThe exception to this is when I cruise with Royal Caribbean. Aside from the oldest Vision and Radiance Class cruise ships, all of the cruise line’s vessels offer unique entertainment venues, whether it’s the ice-skating shows, technology-focused performances at Two70, Broadway productions, or diving spectacles at the AquaTheater.\n\nWith so many unique venues, Royal Caribbean is more the exception than the rule. Traditionally, cruise ships have always offered productions in a theater, and theater shows were the only style of performance offered on Celebrity Silhouette.\n\nI attended the ship’s production of “On Broadway” while onboard, which featured live music and choreography from a selection of Broadway shows, including Hairspray and Les Misérables. I didn’t have any complaints with the show, but it, of course, couldn’t compare to the full-length Broadway productions available on Royal Caribbean.\n\nBoth cruise lines fared equally well when it came to other entertainment, such as live bands and comedians. Yet if I had to pick a cruise line based on entertainment, I would choose Royal Caribbean in a heartbeat.\n\nCelebrity offered upscale dining, but I prefer Royal Caribbean's food options\n\nNearly every review I read about Celebrity raved about the cruise line’s food, but I honestly prefer the dining venues on Royal Caribbean. Given the positive reviews, this was one of the biggest surprises of my vacation.\n\nFood is so subjective that I was apprehensive to even include a food review on this list, so my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. If you ask five cruisers to review food amongst a list of cruise lines, you’d likely see five drastically different rankings.\n\nFor instance, I found the food on both of my MSC cruises to be excellent; the emphasis on high-quality Italian food matched my palette perfectly. Others, however, rank MSC dead-last in their rankings on cruise ship food—some even call it inedible!\n\nAll that said, I thought the food on Celebrity Silhouette was not as seasoned as I prefer, and menu options were sometimes too elegant for my tastes.\n\nAs a traveler who loves spicy, international flavors, I’m not sure I am in the cruise line’s target demographic for menu options.\n\nI enjoyed the variety of food at the buffet, Oceanview Café, and there were items I’ve rarely seen in Royal Caribbean’s buffet, including hummus, ceviche, and even lobster mac and cheese. Despite this, I felt that most dishes could have used more flavor.\n\nMost of the time, I stuck to the stir-fry station so I could customize the dish to my liking with extra spice and seasonings.\n\nAs far as the Main Dining Room, I found myself missing Royal Caribbean’s menu. I love how Royal Caribbean incorporates a theme into each evening, whether Italian or French night. At times, I felt Celebrity tried a little too hard to make classic dishes elevated.\n\nRelated: 21 Tips for the Best Cruise Ship Main Dining Room experience\n\nInstead of a classic basil pesto found in Royal Caribbean’s Main Dining Room, for instance, Celebrity offered a more enhanced version, made with walnut-arugula pesto, asparagus, tomato confit, and parmesan cheese.\n\nWhile fancier, the dish was quite earthy in taste, and I felt the classic dish would have tasted better, despite being more simple.\n\nAgain, food is a subjective topic, and perhaps my palette is not as refined as other cruisers onboard. There were plenty of dishes I enjoyed during the week, especially the Indian curries, but I simply prefer the food offerings and menus offered on Royal Caribbean.\n\nI’d still book a cruise on Celebrity, but mostly for the itinerary\n\nEven though I preferred Royal Caribbean over Celebrity, one reason I would book a Celebrity cruise over the former is because of the itinerary options.\n\nCelebrity Cruises offers a wider range of itineraries compared to Royal Caribbean—you can find cruises to countries like Argentina, Peru, Samoa, and India, along with more traditional itineraries. The line even offers cruises to Antarctica, which allow guests to sail by the continent and enjoy views from onboard, as well as expedition cruises to the Galapagos.\n\nRelated: The best cruise itineraries for every type of traveler\n\nRoyal Caribbean still offers intriguing itinerary options, and I’ve sailed on the line in North America, Europe, and Australia. Nonetheless, as someone who chooses cruises primarily for the destination, Celebrity’s offerings are worth browsing.\n\nIf I were choosing between a similar itinerary, I would likely pick Royal Caribbean over Celebrity. If I wanted to book that bucket-list cruise to Patagonia, though, I wouldn’t hesitate to book another Celebrity cruise.\n\nSometimes it takes trial and error to find the best cruise line for you\n\nEvery cruiser has their own travel style. Some prefer the party atmosphere of a Carnival cruise while others enjoy a luxury experience onboard a cruise line like Silversea. There’s no right or wrong way to cruise, and sometimes it takes a few tries to find the cruise line that fits you best.\n\nAfter taking so many Royal Caribbean cruises, I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a better cruise option out there. Yet after trying five cruise lines in the past three years, I’ve come to appreciate the quality and consistency of Royal Caribbean's product.\n\nWhether it’s the morning mimosa with my Diamond drink voucher, afternoon ride on the zip line, or evening stroll through Central Park, I love how diverse the Royal Caribbean cruise experience can be.\n\nIn the end, I’m happy I tried Celebrity Cruises. I made wonderful memories during my time in Norway, and I had nothing but great experiences with the ship’s condition, service from crew members, and itinerary.\n\nYet ultimately, I’m still loyal to Royal.\n\nI've taken 8 cruises in the past 12 months, and each one taught me something.\n\nAs a new cruiser, I knew I had a lot to learn from personal experience.\n\nNot only was cruising a new form of travel when I started, but my cruises also took me to regions I'd never visited before.\n\nAlthough all my sailings took place on Royal Caribbean ships, I sailed different ships each time; Wonder of the Seas, Freedom of the Seas, Radiance of the Seas, Enchantment of the Seas, Allure of the Seas, Anthem of the Seas, Icon of the Seas, and Oasis of the Seas.\n\nEach different itinerary and ship type introduced me to a new aspect of cruising.\n\nFrom choosing the right stateroom to saving money on shore excursions, I'll explore the top lessons I learned from each sailing.\n\nRead more: I've never been on a cruise, but spent a week researching what I need to know. My top 11 important lessons I think I learned\n\nYour cabin selection has a huge influence on the experience\n\nCruise: Wonder of the Seas\n\nMy first cruise took place on Wonder of the Seas, sailing a 7-night Eastern Caribbean and Perfect Day at CocoCay itinerary.\n\nAny Oasis-class ship would make for the perfect first cruise.\n\nI was blown away by the amount of dining, activities, and amenities onboard, and felt like I barely had enough time to experience it all.\n\nBut while we splurged on specialty dining and shore excursions, we also tried to save money by booking a guarantee stateroom.\n\nIt turned out that this cheaper cabin selection had a huge influence on the entire cruise.\n\nWe were assigned a windowless interior cabin at the very front of the ship, and I quickly learned why other cruisers tend to avoid that location.\n\nThe room was consistently dark, without a view, and we often heard the noise of the anchor chain banging on the ship's hull.\n\nI also learned that I suffer from seasickness while cruising, and the forward location of the stateroom left me even more susceptible to the vessel's rocking motion.\n\nIf I hadn't packed Dramamine, the nausea would have been unbearable.\n\nAlthough I've booked interior cabins since this cruise, and find that the darkness makes for a good night's sleep, I regret not picking a better cabin for my first cruise.\n\nFor a first cruise (or the first one in a while), splurging on a better cabin will upgrade your experience.\n\nSnorkeling is worth it, and you don't always have to pay extra\n\nCruise: Freedom of the Seas\n\nMy Freedom of the Seas cruise took place over a few short days, sailing to Nassau and Perfect Day at CocoCay.\n\nFor this trip, I decided to invest in my experience on Royal Caribbean's private island.\n\nI purchased the snorkel shore excursion, which turned out to be an amazing way to see the beaches of the Bahamas.\n\nAfter renting the snorkel equipment, I took a self-guided tour of the shipwreck and natural life near the shores of CocoCay.\n\nI saw sea snakes, tropical fish, and a jellyfish!\n\nIt was a cool experience, and I later realized that there was nothing stopping me from purchasing and bringing my own snorkel equipment to the island.\n\nAt any visit to Perfect Day at CocoCay, you could experience the snorkel shore excursion for free.\n\nCruising smaller ships is a marvelous way to relax\n\nCruise: Radiance of the Seas\n\nMy third cruise was my first on a smaller ship—the 961-foot Radiance of the Seas.\n\nThe 5-night getaway sailed the Western Caribbean, taking me to ports I hadn't visited before.\n\nWhile I wasn't sure what to expect, I learned that a smaller ship makes for a great way to relax.\n\nThe cruise was a calming getaway. The pool areas were always clear, and the elevators were easy to navigate.\n\nI also noticed a more distinct ship culture; the crew members all seemed to know each other, and the captain even walked around to meet cruisers onboard.\n\nDespite all the flack that smaller ships get, I found the cruise a quiet, enjoyable experience.\n\nPlus, we got to visit exciting ports of call that the large ships can’t visit.\n\nResearch thoroughly before sailing a new region\n\nCruise: Enchantment of the Seas\n\nEnchantment took me to new regions as well: I cruised a 7-night Athens to Barcelona Mediterranean sailing, having never visited the continent before!\n\nI tried to have a more flexible mindset for this cruise, assuming that I'd learn things as I went along.\n\nWhile I'm usually a big researcher, I did less preparation beforehand and expected to learn from experience.\n\nThis isn't the best move when it comes to visiting a new country.\n\nI found myself at a loss when it came to Greek culture or Spanish phrases. Also, when I visited some historical locations such as the island of Crete, I wished that I'd read up on their impact. While the tour guides did give us a lot of information, more reading beforehand would have enhanced my experience.\n\nRead more: 8 lessons learned after trying a European cruise for the first time\n\nThe suite life is very sweet indeed\n\nCruise: Allure of the Seas\n\nMy 3-night weekend cruise on Allure was my first time staying in a suite—and it was luxe.\n\nFor the first time, I realized just what a huge difference splurging on your cabin could make.\n\nWe were greeted with champagne and snacks, and our own coffee machine.\n\nThe stateroom had a huge balcony we could eat dinner on and a deep bathtub I used twice during the 3-day cruise.\n\nPlus, the Grand Suite granted access to the suite lounge and other great benefits.\n\nOnce again, I saw that splurging on your stateroom really makes a difference.\n\nPurchase shore excursions separate from Royal Caribbean to save money\n\nCruise: Anthem of the Seas\n\nFor the majority of my cruises, I was a loyal to Royal shore excursion buyer.\n\nAs soon as the cruise was booked, I would hop on the website to peruse the cruise line's sponsored tours.\n\nWhile I knew that it was more expensive to purchase through Royal Caribbean, I figured the safety and security it gave me would be worth it.\n\nHowever, on my Anthem of the Seas Bahamas and Perfect Days sailing, I decided to branch out and find an excursion on shoreexcursions.com.\n\nI purchased a Glass Bottom Boat Ride with a stop on Pearl Island for about $50 per person.\n\nWhen we arrived at the tour, we had an amazing time, and I discovered that the guests who paid for the same excursion through Royal Caribbean had spent $100-$150 on the excursion.\n\nThat means they spent double or even triple for the same tour!\n\nThe guides winked and told us not to tell anyone how much we'd saved.\n\nTry as many different dining venues and dishes as you can\n\nCruise: Icon of the Seas\n\nMy next cruise took place on the much-hyped Icon of the Seas, and I truly believe she deserves all the praise she gets.\n\nOn this 7-night Western Caribbean and Perfect Day sailing, I was grateful that I made it a priority to try all the different cuisines onboard.\n\nThe ship blew me away with its range of dining options and upgrades to previous Royal Caribbean venues.\n\nRead more: 10 lessons learned after trying Icon of the Seas for the first time\n\nIt was the best food I'd had on a Royal Caribbean ship—and I only tried the complimentary venues!\n\nIf you're planning on cruising Icon, be sure to try as much of the food as you can, and I'd recommend splurging on the specialty dining as well.\n\nA summer trip to Europe is rough, but a positive attitude will take you far\n\nCruise: Oasis of the Seas\n\nOn my second European cruise, I was determined to learn from my past mistakes, and I did tons of research beforehand.\n\nI told myself it would be a great cruise, and it was one of my favorites!\n\nHowever, sailing to Spain, Italy, and Greece during June is a sure-fire way to run into crowds of tourists, and I did.\n\nAlthough my research told me I could expect huge crowds, I was unprepared for how much that affected my experience.\n\nWhen I visited museums, I only got a few seconds in front of the paintings before a group would get in my way. And traffic on the roads cut into our time at port.\n\nAlthough it ended up being an amazing experience, I would have much preferred a less crowded season.\n\nOasis of the Seas shook up the cruise industry when she launched over 15 years ago, and she still has many amenities cruisers will love.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's goal with the Oasis Class mega-ships is for families to travel together, separate to enjoy their interests, and then meet again in the evening for a quality dinner and a show.\n\nWith seven distinct neighborhoods, there's something for everyone.\n\nThe Boardwalk appeals to North American nostalgia and childlike fun, while Central Park offers a quiet, natural area for relaxation.\n\nFor the sports and thrill-lovers, the Pool and Sports Zone houses the ship's pools, hot tubs, slides, and other activities.\n\nCruisers of all ages can find shops, dining venues, and parties on the main thoroughfare, the Royal Promenade.\n\nFor kids and teenagers, the Youth Zone hosts Adventure Ocean and teen programs.\n\nThe Vitality Spa and Fitness Center offers a self-care moment for the body, whether a hot rock massage or an afternoon in the gym.\n\nOasis' Entertainment Place is the hub for nightlife onboard, from the comedy club to the casino to ice skating shows.\n\nThese are our top 13 favorite features onboard Royal Caribbean's first Oasis Class ship.\n\n1. The Bionic Bar\n\nRoyal Caribbean's unique technological wonder, the Bionic Bar, is certainly different.\n\nGuests can order drinks on a tablet and watch robot bartenders mix cocktails.\n\nDrinks at the Bionic Bar cost the same as in other venues, and provide an exciting opportunity to see robotic arms creating alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.\n\n2. Ultimate Abyss\n\nWhen Oasis of the Seas was Amplified in 2019, she received a number of new features, including the then tallest dry slide at sea.\n\nRead more: What was added to each Royal Caribbean ship during its Royal Amplified refurbishment\n\nThe huge purple slide spans 10 decks, taking guests down a 100-foot drop.\n\nNot only is the slide 150 feet above sea level, but it also features exciting twists and turns, and a glass platform that reveals just how high up its riders are.\n\nKids, families, and thrill-seekers will appreciate free access to this slide while onboard Oasis.\n\n3. Portside BBQ\n\nOasis' Royal Amplification also added the cruise line's first barbecue restaurant, Portside BBQ.\n\nIt is a specialty venue, priced a la carte, per dish.\n\nThe food is worth it: cruisers can choose from tender brisket, pulled pork, chicken, beef ribs, burnt ends, and turkey legs.\n\nSides include homestyle cornbread, mac 'n' cheese, and baked beans.\n\n4. Aqua80 Show\n\nRoyal Caribbean's Oasis Class ships go above and beyond with aquatic shows that combine high diving, swimming, and acrobatics.\n\nThe Aqua Theater onboard Oasis of the Seas was the first-ever aquatic amphitheater on a cruise ship.\n\nThe show, Aqua80, features a soundtrack of '80s classics that all generations will love.\n\nIn fact, Aqua80 has been called the best show in the fleet.\n\n5. Central Park\n\nCentral Park is a personal favorite—a gorgeous, open-air venue modeled on New York City's famous park.\n\nThe area is meticulously maintained, with a 25-foot tall plant wall and an accompanying soundtrack of birdsongs or crickets, depending on the day.\n\nThe Central Park on Oasis of the Seas also has access to the library, upscale dining at 150 Central Park, Park Cafe, the Vintages wine bar, Giovanni's Table, and several classy shops.\n\n6. Laser Tag\n\nDid you know you could play laser tag on a cruise ship?\n\nBoth children and adults can face off in an exciting Clash for the Crystal City.\n\nAccess to the laser tag is free but may require reservations.\n\nGuests should wear close-toed footwear and will receive all other necessary equipment when they arrive.\n\n7. Splashaway Bay\n\nMade especially for kids, the Splashaway Bay Aqua Park features exciting cruise water adventures.\n\nChildren of all ages can experience waterslides, fountains, pools, whirlpools, and water cannons.\n\nTwo drench buckets also tip over for more splashing fun, and tethered hammocks offer a place to lay down nearby.\n\nRead more: Oasis of the Seas Cabins to Avoid\n\n8. CATS: The Broadway Musical\n\nMusical lovers will be excited to find CATS onboard Oasis of the Seas.\n\nThe Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is performed live in the Royal Theater.\n\nWith an incredible stage setup and cast costumes, the show tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles.\n\n9. The Rising Tide Bar\n\nThe Rising Tide is another unique, awe-inspiring bar onboard.\n\nThe drink station with live bartenders functions much like an elevator, moving slowly between the Royal Promenade and Central Park (decks 5 to 8).\n\nComfortable seats and stools provide plenty of room for passengers to sit with a drink and enjoy the ever-changing view.\n\n10. Ice Skating Rink\n\nStudio B hosts the vessel's ice skating rink, and features \"Frozen in Time,\" a gorgeous, colorful performance.\n\nThe show is based on the fairytales of Hans Christen Anderson and includes a lights show alongside talented ice skaters.\n\nAnd this rink doesn't just host performances, either—guests can book an ice skating experience of their own on the Royal Caribbean app.\n\n11. Zip Line\n\nWhen she first launched, Oasis had the first zip line on a cruise ship.\n\nCruisers can still ride the zip line today, taking a thrilling 82-foot ride suspended in the air.\n\n9 decks of open space will stretch below your feet as you glide above the Boardwalk.\n\nFor thrill-seekers and anyone looking to try something new, this free ride is an exciting amenity.\n\n12. The Solarium\n\nThe adults-only pool area on Oasis of the Seas is a relaxing venue with comfortable seating, a shallow wading pool, a bar, and several hot tubs.\n\nA large outdoor sundeck is available through the back of the Solarium, where guests can tan and read.\n\nGlass walls and windows allow the light to come in and for guests to see the beautiful ocean view all around.\n\nRead more I chose an inside cabin on my recent Oasis of the Seas cruise because it was the cheapest option, and I actually loved how much space it had\n\n13. The Escape Room\n\nOasis' Amplification also added the Apollo 18 escape room.\n\nInside, you work as a team with other passengers to quickly solve clues and figure out how to escape before time runs out.\n\nThe activity does cost extra and must be reserved.\n\nA cruise in Europe is unlike a Caribbean cruise in many ways, including things you should bring with you on the trip.\n\nI'm headed to Europe for a 7-night Royal Caribbean cruise to Spain and France, and in the weeks leading up to the cruise, I wanted to make sure I have everything I need.\n\nThere are a lot of similarities between a Caribbean cruise and an European cruise, but there are a few items that I think are different or more important to have when going to Europe.\n\nAfter trying Europe last year, I came away with a few takeaways to apply. Plus, I'm headed to different destinations than last time.\n\nRead more: 7 mistakes & 3 things I did right on my Norwegian fjords cruise\n\nHere's the list of things I bought for my European cruise that I think will greatly benefit me. This is of course in addition to the usual assortment of cruise packing list items that I think everyone should rely on as well.\n\neSim\n\nStaying connected is really important to me, and I want to make sure I have a very easy time being able to not only work on this site while on another continent, but be able to easily communicate with friends and family.\n\nRather than rely on an international cell phone plan from my home carrier, I went with an eSim that covers all of Europe.\n\nWhen I went to Europe last year, I was turned onto Orange Travel eSims and it worked flawlessly.\n\nIn the old days, you had to get a physical sim card and have your phone unlocked and it was all super cumbersome. With modern phones, it's all virtual.\n\nBasically, you buy a travel plan that is good for 7, 14, or even 28 days. When you get to Europe, scan a QR code and it downloads the eSim information to your phone and you have a second cellular connection ready to go!\n\nIt's really simple, and I bought the 30GB plan that works for 14 days from the time of activation. I think it's probably more data than I need, but I can always top it off if I need more. Total cost is €39.99.\n\nIt works in all the countries I'll be visiting, and I can avoid having to constantly try to find a WiFi signal somewhere.\n\nUK/EU power adaptor\n\nOne of the best things to pack for any cruise is downright essential on a European cruise.\n\nRoyal Caribbean cruise ships don't always have a lot of power outlets, so a USB hub is very useful. In Europe, you're going to need that and a good power adaptor to go with it.\n\nBetween your phone, laptop, and any other electronic you pack, the outlets in Europe are very different.\n\nThe EPICKA Universal Travel Adapter (this is an affiliate link, which means I get a small commission but there's no extra cost to you) is great because it's small, and it can work with US, EU, or UK power outlets. Plus, it has USB outlets on the side!\n\nIt's an all-in-one adapter that has 4 USB-A ports (2.4A), 1 USB-C port (3A), and 1 AC socket.\n\nI've been able to bring this on cruise ships and use it around Europe, and it's a solid investment.\n\nBetter walking shoes\n\nWhen I'm at home, I wear basic shoes that are far from perfect for walking, so I needed a better pair for Europe.\n\nBetween exploring London and the shore excursions I have planned in France and Spain, there's going to be plenty of walking involved. Getting a blister or just sore feet sounds is not something I want, so I decided to invest in better shoes for walking.\n\nThere are lots of sneakers out there, but I ultimately went with the Nike Men's Sports Low Top Shoes. For the ladies, my friend Sheri recommends the adidas Women's Cloudfoam sneakers. (this is an affiliate link, which means I get a small commission but there's no extra cost to you)\n\nIf you do buy sneakers for your cruise, be sure to break them in before the cruise begins. Don't wear brand new shoes around Europe. Instead, wear them around your house and town so they are worn-in and ready to tackle the old streets of Europe.\n\nTheft-proof bag\n\nRather than stuff all my personal belongings in my pockets, investing in a good bag that doubles against pickpockets seemed like a good idea.\n\nA lot of travel experts recommend a crossbody bag as something to take with you on shore, and I wanted to go one step further to ensure it is theft-proof.\n\nPickpockets are a concern in Europe, and while I won't pretend to know how likely a threat, I figure it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nUltimately I went with the Wander Plus Anti Theft Travel Bag (this is an affiliate link, which means I get a small commission but there's no extra cost to you) because it can be worn as a crossbody bag or as a sling bag.\n\nI've never worn a crossbody bag, and I'm still traumatized by the fanny pack craze of the 1990s. So while I won't wear Zubaz pants anytime soon, I'm willing to give crossbody bags a try.\n\nApple AirTags\n\nI think everyone has a small panic attack contemplating what happens if their luggage would get lost, so that's why I bought Apple AirTags.\n\nAir travel is especially notorious for lost bags, and I would have far more peace of mind knowing where my bags are located.\n\nAn AirTag is a small, button-shaped tracking device that weighs just 11 grams. AirTags can be tracked using Bluetooth in the Find My app on my iPhone.\n\nA single AirTag will cost $29 and a 4-pack costs $99. (These links contain an affiliate link. I earn from qualifying purchases that costs you nothing extra)\n\nIt's an easy and affordable add-on for my trip, and I think I'll have less anxiety about my luggage not making it with me.\n\nRead more: I tried AirTags to track my luggage on a Royal Caribbean cruise\n\nOne thing I'm not packing: toiletries\n\nDon't worry, I'm planning to shower regularly during my European cruise. But I won't bother buying them at home and bringing them with me.\n\nFirst, they take up space in my luggage and add weight. If they're travel size, not that much weight and space, but it all adds up.\n\nBut the real reason I'm not packing toiletries is because I'm always paranoid of them opening/exploding in my luggage. Sure, I can put them in a zip lock bag, but then we're back to the first issue I talked about.\n\nInstead, I'll buy them when I get to London and then toss them when I'm ready to come home.\n\nAnd if you're concerned I'll forget or get lazy, the included 3-in-1 mystery liquid in Royal Caribbean's shower is a non-starter for me, so I'll definitely find the motivation to get it.\n\nIt might sound crazy, but booking a cruise ship cabin for two people if you're sailing alone is actually a good idea.\n\nThe cruise industry's sales model assumes double occupancy and it's been that way for decades.\n\nCruising is by nature, a social form of travel, but solo cruises are rising in popularity.\n\nAccording to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), 8 to 13% of cruisers are traveling solo in 2024. Plus, millennials and Gen Z are more likely to travel solo than other generations.\n\nAs they continue to age and earn more money, they're likely to travel solo more and more.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's Quantum Class ships, for instance, boast over 10 studio balcony cabins and more than 10 studio interior cabins (not available on Odyssey of the Seas) onboard.\n\nHowever, the availability of solo cabins doesn't mean you should book them straight away.\n\nIt's a better idea to book a cabin for two, even if you know you'll be traveling alone—here's why.\n\nHow to avoid the single supplement fee\n\nCruising who travel alone in a double-occupancy cabin are subject to a single supplement fee.\n\nRoyal Caribbean's website states that the typical fee is 200% of the category rate.\n\n\"All rates posted on this website are based on double occupancy. A single guest who wishes to have a stateroom to themselves will be expected to pay 200% of the category rate, unless otherwise noted in the pricing.\"\n\nEssentially, you'll pay the same price as two travelers.\n\nFor example, on a May 2025 7-night Anthem of the Seas Alaska Experience Cruise, oceanview balcony cabins are marked at $1430 per person for two people in a room.\n\nIf you select the same room, for only one person, the price goes up to $2,515.\n\nBecause of this, it's actually cheaper to book your cruise with two people in a cabin.\n\nPlus, by booking a bigger, double-occupied cabin, you'll have more space all to yourself!\n\nRoyal Caribbean's studio staterooms range from 101 to 199 square feet, while typical two-person cabins measure 150 square feet and above.\n\nSolo cabins may not be available on your desired cruise\n\nStudio cabins allow you to cruise alone without paying the single supplement fee, but they're not on every cruise ship.\n\nIcon of the Seas, Royal Caribbean's current largest ship, does not have any studio cabins onboard. This is likely an indication that the rest of the Icon Class won't feature many single cabin options.\n\nUtopia of the Seas, the latest iteration in the Oasis Class, also not does feature any studio staterooms.\n\nAnd the ships that do have studio cabins have a limited inventory.\n\nIf you prefer a certain cabin location to prevent seasickness or avoid noise, it's unlikely you'll be able to book a studio cabin in that location.\n\nPlus, popular sailings or cruises during peak times might be completely sold out.\n\nOn the Anthem of the Seas May 2025, oceanview balcony studios (listed at $2,030) are already sold out, and there are only 8 interior studios still available (which cost $1,222).\n\nBooking a studio cabin severely limits your choices.\n\nRead more: I took my first solo cruise on Royal Caribbean's biggest cruise ships. After 7 nights, here are the pros and cons of cruising alone\n\nBooking a cabin for two is cheaper\n\nEven if you're planning to cruise solo, booking a second person on your reservation gives you a cheaper price.\n\nYou can put in the name and information for any one of your friends or family members without actually bringing them on the cruise.\n\nThat person can skip checking in and turn out to be a \"no-show\" on embarkation day.\n\nI've had no problem doing this on my solo cruises.\n\nWhen I arrive at the cruise terminal, I say that my travel buddy couldn't make it and that I'll be sailing alone.\n\nThe only disadvantage to booking a second person on your reservation is that seat assignments (done for traditional dining) at the Main Dining Room are usually already assigned, based on your travel party.\n\nI've often showed up to a cruise by myself at a traditional, assigned dining time, and found that I was seated at a table for two or more.\n\nIf you find dining alone (especially at a bigger table) awkward, you can ask for a different table or skip traditional dining times altogether.\n\nRead more: I tried eating alone in the Main Dining Room on my cruise. I was worried it would feel awkward, but I liked it a lot more than I expected\n\nIs it worth it to cruise by yourself?\n\nThere are pros and cons to cruising solo, the most obvious con being the potential for loneliness.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you should pass up on a cruise just because you might have to sail alone.\n\nBesides the fact that you get to experience a fantastic vacation, cruising solo allows you to sail at your own pace.\n\nIf you prefer wandering art museums, but your partner is an active beach-goer, a solo cruise is the perfect chance to indulge in your preferences.\n\nRead more: 5 things that surprised me about going on my first solo cruise, from enjoying my own stateroom to conversing with others\n\nA solo cruise also pushes you to make conversations and meet new people, rather than relying on the friends you bring with you.\n\nIf you're up for the adventure, it's the perfect chance to make the most of your experience and get out of your comfort zone.\n\nI was able to take advantage of a few smart strategies to help make my money go further on my first Celebrity cruise.\n\nWhile I’m usually a budget cruiser, my recent cruise on Celebrity Silhouette initially proved otherwise.\n\nI upgraded from my typical interior cabin to a balcony room, and I booked my airfare way too late, which set me back a staggering $1,400.\n\nAdditionally, my cruise itinerary was set to visit Norway, a country frequently listed as one of the most expensive in the world. I felt as if I were setting myself up for failure as far as budget was concerned, but I was still determined to save money wherever I could.\n\nBy utilizing Celebrity’s loyalty status perks, forgoing splurges onboard, and keeping in-port spending to a minimum, I was surprised with the savvy ways I was able to save money throughout my weeklong cruise.\n\nHere are the five ways I saved money on my first Celebrity cruise.\n\nI took advantage of Celebrity’s loyalty status matching program, maximizing benefits to save as much as possible\n\nOne of the easiest ways I saved money on my Celebrity cruise was through matching my Crown & Anchor Society status on Royal Caribbean to Celebrity’s Captain’s Club program.\n\nCelebrity Cruises and Royal Caribbean allow guests to match their loyalty status from one cruise line to the other, allowing passengers to reap the benefits of the reciprocal loyalty program—even if it’s their first time on the cruise line.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Cruises Captain's Club loyalty program info, tips & secrets\n\nAs a Diamond Plus member on Royal Caribbean, I matched my status to Celebrity’s Captain’s Club when I booked my cruise. My status matched Celebrity's Elite Plus status, the second-highest tier of the loyalty program.\n\nThis led to lucrative benefits during my cruise, including discounts on wifi and drink packages, a 15% discount at specialty restaurants, two complimentary bags of laundry, one free scoop of gelato, a day in the thermal suite, and access to exclusive events.\n\nAlthough I didn’t take advantage of every benefit offered, a few select benefits led to great savings. The Elite Happy Hour, for instance, allowed me to enjoy complimentary alcoholic beverages from 5-7PM every evening, and I could also start each day with a complimentary latte from the onboard coffee shop, Café Al Bacio.\n\nI was grateful for these benefits as they enabled me to minimize my onboard spending. I didn’t need to worry about paying for laundry or spending $15 for a single cocktail, and saving nearly $40 on the wifi package was an awesome perk, too.\n\nI planned my own activities in port because Celebrity’s excursion prices were steep\n\nNorway and budget-friendly don’t necessarily go hand in hand, but I was still surprised by the prices of shore excursions offered by Celebrity Cruises.\n\nHaving never been to Norway before, I was looking forward to exploring the four ports of call on my itinerary. The Norwegian fjords looked spectacular, and I knew I wanted to see as much as I could in each destination. As an active traveler, I was particularly interested in excursions involving hiking, kayaking, and other outdoor pursuits.\n\nRelated: Is it better to book excursions through the cruise ship?\n\nUnfortunately, looking at Celebrity’s excursions ahead of my cruise left me disappointed. Organized tours to destinations like Briksdal Glacier and Pulpit Rock (Norway’s most famous hike) were over $200 or $300 a person. Even independent tours I found on GetYourGuide and Viator were expensive. Norway was already living up to its pricey reputation, and hadn’t even arrived in the country yet!\n\nBefore shelling out nearly $1,000 on excursions, I checked whether or not I could get to each port's top attractions on my own. Luckily, I found economical ways to do the same activities I wanted to book with a cruise-sponsored excursion.\n\nInstead of booking a $170 excursion to hike Pulpit Rock, I booked a $40 shuttle bus that departed from central Stavanger and dropped me off at the trailhead. The return trip left five hours later, giving me more than enough time to finish the trail (and grab a well-deserved ice cream at the basecamp).\n\nIn Olden, I booked the Loen Skylift on my own to enjoy enchanting views of Norway’s Nordfjord. The cable car’s ticket was $53 for a roundtrip ride, and I got to and from the skylift in just six minutes on a local bus (just $3 each way).\n\nMy port days in Ålesund and Molde were easier to plan independently, as I planned to stay within the city centers. Each town offered charming, historic streets, quaint cafes, and gorgeous views from the waterfront. My expenses were minimal in both of these destinations.\n\nI took public transportation to the port instead of a taxi or shuttle\n\nOne of the hidden expenses of a cruise vacation is the expense of getting to and from your cruise port. Although you might book airfare far in advance, it’s easy to forget about planning transportation logistics to the ship itself.\n\nMy cruise itinerary departed from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, but my flight arrived at the country’s main airport outside of Amsterdam. As always, I arrived a day prior to my cruise. I spent the night in Amsterdam with a plan of traveling to Rotterdam on embarkation morning.\n\nRelated: How to prepare for a cruise: Last minute things you should do\n\nOne of the most convenient aspects of cruising in Europe is the extensive public transportation network in major cities. In most circumstances, there’s no need to book expensive private transfers or call an Uber to the port when cheaper—and arguably more convenient—options exist.\n\nSo instead of booking Celebrity’s $40 transfer or shelling out over €100 for a taxi, I searched for directions to the port on Google Maps. An $18 train ride from Amsterdam brought me to Rotterdam’s central station in under an hour. From there, a short, $2 metro ride brought me just a 5-minute walk away from the city’s cruise port.\n\nIf you’re traveling with more than two people, or if you have large suitcases, there’s an argument to be made for private transfers. In my scenario, though, taking public transportation made the most sense whilst also saving money.\n\nI kept souvenir shopping to a minimum and avoided expensive meals in port\n\nAfter reading how fellow cruise writer Allie spent over $800 on souvenirs on her recent European cruise, I was worried about whether or not I could keep my shopping budget to a minimum. She stated how the cost of souvenirs in Norway was exorbitant, with $40 t-shirts and $60 crewnecks.\n\nReading this beforehand, I made a mental note to keep souvenir spending to a minimum. Of course, traveling with a carry-on suitcase helped, as I couldn’t fit much more into the bag anyway. So instead of purchasing heavy knickknacks and clothing, I bought small souvenirs like magnets, which were cheaper and easier to pack.\n\nRelated: Top 30 extra cruise costs that aren't included\n\nFurthermore, I saved money by avoiding the more expensive dining options in port. On long port days, it’s inevitable that you’ll spend some money on food, whether a sit-down meal or grab-and-go snack.\n\nMost restaurants in Norway are anything but budget-friendly; sit-down meals seemed to average around $25 for an entrée. I could see these prices breaking my budget on a land-based trip, but because I only had four days in Norway, spending $100 on four lunches while in port wasn’t a huge deal.\n\nEven still, I tended to choose more casual dining venues instead of the fancier sit-down options. One of my best meals, in fact, was from a Thai food truck in Ålesund, and the meal only set me back $13. If I needed a quick snack, I could find a scrumptious pastry at a local bakery for around $3-5.\n\nStaying budget-conscious with souvenir and food purchases in port helped me avoid spending more than I wanted to. Luckily, I didn’t feel like I missed out on anything by doing so.\n\nI stuck to only included dining options, despite the intriguing specialty restaurants\n\nAlthough I usually cruise on a budget, one of the add-ons I frequently splurge for on a cruise is specialty dining. There’s not anything wrong with the included food on a cruise ship, but I prefer the enhanced dining experience of specialty venues, both in ambiance and cuisine variety.\n\nYet on Celebrity Silhouette, I forwent the specialty options and dined at only included restaurants. I split my meals between the Main Dining Room and Oceanview Cafe buffet. Outside of these venues, the ship offered complimentary burgers at Mast Grill, grab-and-go pastries at Café Al Bacio, and health-focused fare at Spa Café.\n\nRelated: What's included on a Celebrity cruise?\n\nI also made sure to avoid food and beverage classes offered by Celebrity. Although the pizza making class they offered onboard was probably fun, I couldn’t fathom spending over $70 for the experience.\n\nThe included restaurants provided enough variety that I didn’t feel the need to spend extra at specialty restaurants. By spending nothing extra for food onboard, I could allocate these savings toward meals and snacks in port instead.\n\nSometimes splurging is worth the convenience, but I was happy to keep to a budget on my Celebrity cruise\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m glad I used these savvy tricks in order to save money on my Celebrity cruise. That being said, there’s a time and a place for using these budget-saving strategies.\n\nThere’s no denying that booking shore excursions through the cruise line is convenient, for example, and not all travelers want to deal with the hassle of planning port days on their own. Sometimes, spending an extra $100 on an organized tour is worth it for a stress-free trip.\n\nPlus, add-ons like drink packages and specialty dining can greatly enhance a passenger’s onboard experience. There were times I wanted to try those picture-perfect cocktails at the Martini Bar, or that steamy bowl of ramen from Raw on 5, without thinking about the cost of each purchase.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, saving money on a cruise enables me to cruise more often. Every cruiser has a different travel style, and I’ll stick to even the tightest budget if it means I can continue booking cruises to far-flung destinations around the world."
