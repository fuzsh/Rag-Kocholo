        "text": "Quiche Lorraine\n\nBy Jenn Segal\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Read my full disclosure policy.\n\nRichly flavored with Gruyère cheese and smoky bacon, quiche Lorraine is one of the most satisfying dishes imaginable.\n\nDuring my college years, I spent a semester studying abroad in Tours, France, a charming university town located an hour away from Paris. One of my daily rituals was visiting a local boulangerie for lunch. I’d treat myself to a mini quiche Lorraine, then savor every bite while strolling back to class through the winding, cobbled streets. While I can’t remember much about my courses, the memory of that simple pleasure still lingers to this day.\n\nNamed after the region of France where it originated, quiche Lorraine is is one of the most iconic French quiches and also one of the most satisfying dishes imaginable. Richly flavored with smoky bacon, nutty Gruyère cheese, and shallots, it’s ideal for brunch, lunch, or dinner, especially paired with a green salad and crisp white wine.\n\n“This is hands down, the BEST quiche Lorraine recipe ever! As a personal chef, I am asked to make dishes that reheat well – this one does, but it’s also exceptional when served fresh out of the oven…People always tell me it’s the best quiche they’ve ever tasted!”\n\nMarsha Gale\n\nWhat You’ll Need To Make Quiche Lorraine\n\nFrozen pie crust: Serves as the base for the quiche. I recommend using frozen crusts over rolled refrigerated crusts—they are ready to cook and won’t shrink during par-baking. Ensure it’s a deep-dish variety to accommodate all the filling.\n\nThick-cut bacon: Adds smoky, savory flavor and meaty texture that is quintessential to the flavor profile of quiche Lorraine. To make it easier to work with, pop it in the freezer for 10 minutes or so before cutting.\n\nShallots: Offer a mild, slightly sweet flavor that complements the richness of the other ingredients without overpowering them.\n\nEggs: Act as the foundation of the custard filling, binding the ingredients together and giving the quiche its signature texture and structure.\n\nHeavy cream: Contributes to the luxurious, creamy consistency of the filling. When making quiche, I always use heavy cream over milk or half-and-half.\n\nSalt, cayenne pepper, ground nutmeg: These seasonings flavor of the quiche, with salt balancing the flavors, cayenne pepper adding a slight heat, and ground nutmeg providing a warm, nutty undertone.\n\nGruyère: This cheese lends a rich, nutty flavor that is essential to quiche Lorraine. Use an authentic Swiss-made Gruyère with the AOP seal for the best flavor and quality, and be sure it’s finely shredded so that it melts easily. It’s a bit pricey, but you only need 4 ounces. Plus, any leftover cheese can be used for making delicious grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nJump to the printable recipe for precise measurements\n\nStep-by-Step instructions\n\nTo begin, remove the pie crust from freezer and thaw for about 10 minutes. Prick the bottom and sides all over with a fork.\n\nBake on until lightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. (Keep an eye on it; if it puffs up while cooking, gently prick it with a fork so it will deflate.) Don’t panic if your crust cracks in the oven. You can easily fix it by making a smooth paste from 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 tablespoon of water. Using your fingers, patch up and fill any cracks with the paste, then place the crust back in the oven for a minute or so to set. It should be good as new.\n\nWhile the crust cooks, dice the bacon. Place the diced bacon in a medium nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes.\n\nUse a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.\n\nPour off all but one tablespoon of fat from the pan and add the shallots.\n\nCook over medium-low heat until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not brown. Set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, and then the heavy cream, salt, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.\n\nWhisk until evenly combined.\n\nSpread the shallots evenly over the bottom of the cooked crust.\n\nTop with half of the bacon.\n\nThen all of the Gruyère.\n\nThen the remaining bacon.\n\nPour the egg/cream mixture over top.\n\nSlide the quiche (still on the baking sheet) into the oven and bake at 325°F for 45 to 50 minutes, until the custard is set and lightly golden. Serve the quiche hot or at room temperature.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I make quiche Lorraine ahead of time?\n\nAbsolutely! You can prepare this recipe a day ahead of time and refrigerate. To reheat, cover the quiche with aluminum foil and heat in a preheated 300°F (150°C) oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until hot in the center.\n\nCan quiche Lorraine be frozen?\n\nYes, quiche Lorraine freezes beautifully for up to three months. After baking and cooling the quiche, wrap it in a layer of plastic wrap and then a layer of aluminum foil. Remove the quiche from the freezer about 24 hours prior to eating. Remove the plastic wrap and reheat it, covered with foil, in a 300°F oven until hot in the center.\n\nWhy do you bake quiche at 325°F?\n\nBaking quiche at 325°F is a technique I learned in French culinary school and while working in a French restaurant. This lower temperature prevents the eggs from scrambling, a common issue at higher heats, and ensures the custard sets to a silky smooth consistency. It makes a difference!\n\nVideo Tutorial\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nQuiche Lorraine\n\nRichly flavored with Gruyère cheese and smoky bacon, quiche Lorraine is one of the most satisfying dishes imaginable.\n\nIngredients\n\nOne 9-inch deep-dish frozen pie crust\n\n8 oz thick-cut bacon (about 6 slices), diced\n\n½ cup chopped shallots, from 2 medium shallots\n\n4 large eggs\n\n1¼ cups heavy cream\n\n¼ teaspoon salt\n\n&frac18; teaspoon cayenne pepper\n\nPinch ground nutmeg\n\n4 oz Gruyère, finely shredded (about 1¼ cups)\n\nInstructions\n\nBlind bake the crust: Preheat the oven to 400°F and set a rack in the middle position. Remove the pie crust from freezer and thaw until just soft enough to easily prick with a fork, about 10 minutes. (If there are any cracks in the crust, see note below on how to patch them up.) Prick the bottom and sides all over with a fork. Place the crust on a baking sheet to make it easy to move in and out of the oven. Bake on until lightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Keep an eye on it; if it puffs up while cooking, gently prick it with a fork so it will deflate. (If it cracks while baking, see note below for instructions on how to patch it up.) Set aside and reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.\n\nIn a medium nonstick sauté pan over medium heat, cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Pour off all but one tablespoon of fat from the pan. Add the shallots and cook over medium-low heat until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not brown. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the heavy cream, salt, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg; whisk until evenly combined.\n\nSpread the shallots evenly over the bottom of the cooked crust. Top with half of the bacon, all of the Gruyère, and then the remaining bacon. Pour the egg/cream mixture over top.\n\nSlide the quiche (still on the baking sheet) into the oven and bake at 325°F for 45 to 50 minutes, until the custard is set and lightly golden. Serve hot or warm.\n\nNote: Don't panic if your crust has cracks -- you can easily fix it. Make a smooth paste by mixing 1 tablespoon of flour with 1 tablespoon of water. Use your fingers to patch up and fill any cracks, then proceed with the recipe. If the crust cracks while blind baking, patch it afterwards and place it back in the oven for a minute or so to set. It should be good as new.\n\nMake-Ahead Instructions: This quiche can be fully prepared up to a day ahead of time and refrigerated. To reheat: Cover the quiche with aluminum foil and heat in a preheated 300°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until hot in the center.\n\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions: The cooked quiche can be frozen for up to 3 months. After baking and cooling the quiche, wrap it in a layer of plastic wrap and then a layer of aluminum foil. Remove the quiche from the freezer about 24 hours prior to eating. Remove the plastic wrap and reheat it, covered with foil, in a 300°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until hot in the center.\n\nNutrition Information\n\nPowered by\n\nPer serving (6 servings)\n\nCalories: 616\n\nFat: 51 g\n\nSaturated fat: 24 g\n\nCarbohydrates: 24 g\n\nSugar: 3 g\n\nFiber: 1 g\n\nProtein: 16 g\n\nSodium: 575 mg\n\nCholesterol: 232 mg\n\nThis website is written and produced for informational purposes only.
