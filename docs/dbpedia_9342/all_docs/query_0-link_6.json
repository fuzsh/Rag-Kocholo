Pre-schoolers all over the United States were shown this picture and asked the same question, and 90% of them gave the correct answer!\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe bus is traveling to the left. When asked why they decided the bus is traveling to the left, they answered: \"Because you can't see the door to get on the bus.\"\n\nYou must cut a gold chain to pay someone for 7 days of service. The chain has 7 links on it, and you agree on a price of one link per day. The employee will not work without receiving that day's pay each afternoon, but you do not wish to give him more than his daily payment for the fear that he will not return. Therefore, you must cut some of the links on the chain to make the daily payments. What is the smallest number of links you need to cut so that the employee receives only one link each day?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe chain can be divided with just three cuts. When you cut a link, you can remove the adjacent link from each side. So first cutting the middle (fourth) link will yield a single link and two chains 3 links long. Then cutting each of those in the middle of the remaining two sections (of three links each) will divide the chain into individual links. HOWEVER, one of our visitors has suggested that IF the worker agrees to not spend his pay until after the week is over AND to do an exchange most days, you can pay him each day by making only ONE cut in the chain. First, cut the link three from the end. This will give you a single link (that has been cut), a chain of two links and a chain of four links. Now pay the man in the following way.\n\nDay 1: give him a single link (Pay = 1 link)\n\nDay 2: Exchange the single link with the double link (Pay = 2 links)\n\nDay 3: Give him a single link (Pay = 3 links)\n\nDay 4: Exchange the 3 links (single link and the 2 link chain)\n\nfor the chain of 4 links (Pay = 4 links)\n\nDay 5: Give him the single link (Pay = 5 links)\n\nDay 6: Exchange the single link for the double link (Pay = 6 links)\n\nDay 7: Give him the single link (Pay = 7 links)\n\nWhile driving home after a hard day's work, I came upon the following problem. An entire town had been painted black; the roads, pavements, buildings, hedges, and everything that did not move had been painted black. In addition, my vehicle's headlights were not working, no moon was visible, and power was off in the area, so there were no street or house lights around. At that moment, I entered a curve where a solid black dog (deaf, and thus unaware of the approaching car) was sitting in the road. He had his back to me, so there was not even a glint in his eye, yet I was able to swerve round him quite easily and without danger. How was this achieved?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nIt was 2 o'clock on a lovely sunny afternoon!\n\nA man has an acreage where grass grows continuously and evenly. If 20 cows eat all the grass in 96 days and 30 cows eat all of the grass in 60 days, then how long does it take 70 cows to eat all of the grass?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nLet's say one cow can eat X pounds of grass per day. The field grows Y pounds of grass per day. At the start the field already has N pounds of grass standing. At the end, the field has zero pounds of grass remaining. So we set up the equations for the amount of grass for the two cases, adding growing grass and subtracting eaten grass:\n\nfor 96 days:\n\nN + 96Y - 20x96 X =0\n\nFor 30 cows eating for 60 days:\n\nN + 60Y - 30x60 X = 0\n\nOr N + 96Y - 1920X = 0 and\n\nN + 60Y - 1800X = 0\n\nSubtract the two equations and we get: 36Y - 120X = 0, or 36Y =120X or 3Y = 10X\n\nIn other words, in one day ten cows can eat as much as the field grows in three days.Now we substitute this back into either of the two starting equationsto find how much grass (N) was in the field at the start:\n\n>N + 60Y - 1800X = N + 60Y -540Y = 0\n\nAnd N = 480Y\n\nNow we set up the equation for 70 cows eating and the field growing for T days, until the grass is gone:\n\nN + TY - 70 TX = 0, or 480Y + TY - 21TY = 0 480Y -20TY = 0\n\nthus T = 24.\n\nSo the 70 cows finish off the field in 24 days.\n\nYou have three houses or squares drawn on paper, and below them three smaller squares representing gas, water, and electric service. Can you draw a line to get each utility into each house (9 total lines) without crossing over any line, changing the size of some of the houses, or going through one house to reach another?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nNo -- the statement 'drawn on paper' implies that this is a 2D surface, and in two dimensions the problem has no solution. The best result you may get using the drawing above is only eight proper connections. But in three dimensions, the problem can pretty easily be solved. There is a real lesson in geometry here -- whether the six objects with connections are houses or just geometric points, the true answer is that one cannot make the nine connections on a two-dimensional surface without one of the lines crossing. Adding size to the houses and/or running lines through the houses, etc., simply avoids the problem by just changing the rules, rather than finding the true solution. One of the lessons, particularly in mathematics, is to discover what is impossible and thus can be excluded in solutions of other problems. The answer is not always to hammer the problem into a different one that looks solvable.\n\nGood at math? Try this one....\n\n1=3\n\n2=3\n\n3=5\n\n4=4\n\n5=4\n\n6=3\n\n7=5\n\n8=5\n\n9=4\n\n10=3\n\nSo what does\n\n11=?\n\n12=?\n\nReveal Answer\n\n11=6 and 12=6 (the number of letters in the number's name)\n\nWhat do these words have in common: age, blame, curb, dance, evidence, fence, gleam, harm, interest, jam, kiss, latch, motion, nest, order, part, quiz, rest, signal, trust, use, view, win, x-ray, yield, zone?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nAll the words can be used as both nouns and verbs.\n\nWhat are the science teacher's favorite states?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nSolid, liquid, and gas...the states of matter!\n\nYou have three containers. One has only red marbles, one has only blue marbles and the third has an equal number of red and blue marbles. The labels on the containers have intentionally been switched so that each container is now marked incorrectly.\n\nYour job is to relabel the containers correctly. Of course you could just look in the containers to find out which labels match, but can you do it without looking into each container? Reach into any one of the containers and select one marble. Can you now correctly label all three containers? If not, select a second marble from any container. What is the fewest number of marbles you need to inspect in order to correctly label each container?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nYou would only need to take out one marble because we know that all of the labels are incorrect. So you pull one marble out of the container labeled \"mixed.\" If red comes out, you know that has to be the all-red container, so you put the red label on it. The container labelled \"Blue\" must then be labelled \"mixed\" because you know it is also labeled incorrectly, and therefore can't be blue. You would label the last container blue because that is the only color/container combo left. Of course, if the first marble you pulled out from the container labeled \"mixed\" is blue marble, then you solve the problem in the same general way.\n\nDuring a school lunch break, ten kids are discussing after school jobs. In particular, they would like to know their average monthly salary (for the ten of them), but no one wants to admit openly exactly what they make. Can you devise a way for them to calculate their average (mean) salary without anyone having to tell anyone else what their individual salaries are?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nAlthough there may be other solutions, here is a simple one: The first person takes his monthly salary (lets say $100), adds an arbitrary amount that only he knows (lets say $475) and whispers that number ($575) to the second person. The second person then adds his monthly salary (lets say $150) to that value and whispers the new total ($725) to the third person. The third person adds in his salary, whispers the new total to the fourth person and so on until the tenth person adds in his salary and whispers the final total to the first person. The first person then subtracts his arbitrary number from that total, divides by 10, which produces (assuming that no one made an error in arithmetic!) the average monthly salary for the group without anyone having to divulge their salary to anyone else.\n\nWhat is the fastest time that a group of four people can row to the other side of the river with the following rules in place?\n\nThe speed of the rowers is as follows:\n\nRower #1 -- rows in 1 minute\n\nRower #2 -- rows in 2 minutes\n\nRower #5 -- rows in 5 minutes\n\nRower #10 -- rows in 10 minutes\n\nAll four people must get to the other side of the river using the rowboat\n\nOnly two people can travel in, on, or around the boat at any one time.\n\nThe person in the boat who rows at the slowest speed must do the rowing (they travel at the speed of the slowest person).\n\nReveal Answer\n\n#2 rows #1 across in 2 minutes\n\n#1 returns in 1 minute\n\n#10 rows #5 across in 10 minutes\n\n#2 returns in 2 minutes\n\n#2 rows #1 across in 2 minutes\n\nTotal is 17 minutes, and steps 2) and 4) can be interchanged. The key is to have #10 row #5 across and have a faster rower waiting on the other side to take the boat back.\n\nFour men are standing in a line as shown above and they cannot turn their heads. There is a brick wall between A and B that they cannot see through. They know that they each have one hat, and that of the four hats two are black and two are white. They cannot see the color of the hat that they are wearing. In order to be released from the line, they must call out the color of their hat. If they are wrong, no one can leave. They are not allowed to talk to each other, and they have been given ten minutes to figure out their hat color. After 1 minute:\n\nOne of them calls out -- which one called out?\n\nHow can he be 100% certain of the color of his hat?\n\nThis is not a trick question and there are no outside influences nor any other ways of communicating. They cannot move or see behind them, nor can they see through the wall.\n\nReveal Answer\n\nC would call out, because he would know that if his hat were the same color as B's hat, then D would have known that his own hat was the opposite color of B and C's hat and would have called out. Since D did not speak then C knows that his hat is the opposite color of B's.\n\nIn a recent random drawing of three digits, the number 361 was drawn; immediately afterward in a random drawing of four digits, 2401 was drawn. Both of these numbers have something unusual in common -- what is it? And what are the chances of this happening again, remembering that in a random drawing numbers can begin with one or more zeroes.\n\nReveal Answer\n\nBoth numbers are perfect squares (19 squared and 49 squared). The three number drawing has exactly 1000 possible outcomes (000-999) The four number drawing has exactly 10,000 possible outcomes (0000-9999). To see how many squares are possible, take the square root of the maximum number and \"round up\" (to count the 000, which is a perfect square). Thus, since the square root of 999 is 31.6, there are 32 possible squares in the three number drawing (the squares of 0 through 31). Similarly, for the four number drawing, there are 100 possible squares (the squares of 0 through 99). Thus, the likelihood of both numbers being a squared number is (32/1000) x (100/10000) or 0.00032 (a little over 3 chances in 10,000).\n\nTwo postmen meet on their routes and they start talking.\n\nPostman A says: \"I know you have 3 sons, how old are they?\"\n\nPostman B says: \"If you take their ages in years, and multiply them together, the result is your age.\"\n\nA: \"That`s not enough info\"\n\nB: \"The sum of the 3 numbers equals the number of windows in that\n\nbuilding over there.\"\n\nA: \"Hmm... that`s still not enough.\"\n\nB: \"My middle son is red-haired.\"\n\nA: \"Ah, now I see!\"\n\nHow old are the 3 sons?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nWith a little bit of work, you can discover that only one solution is possible: the kids must be 1, 5, and 8 because a solution with the same A and B involving twins (2, 2, and 10) is ruled out by the middle son with red hair. The product of both are 40 and the sums are 14. The basis for that solution is as follows: The postman's first statement tells us that x*y*z = A; the postman's second statement tells us that x+y+z = B; and the third statement tells us that x does not equal y does not equal z. We know that the three ages are different because the \"middle\" son has red hair, which implies that none of the children are twins. The most important piece of information in the puzzle is that there must be at least two sets of numbers that add together to give the same sum and multiply together to give the same product -- or he would have been able to figure it out without the third parameter about the middle child (no twins). Thus, there are two sets of three numbers x1, y1, & z1 and x2, y2, & z2 where x1 + y1 + z1 = x2 + y2 + z2 and x1 * y1 * z1 = x2 * y2 * z2 . It is not the fact that there are no twins, but the fact that the postman could NOT figure out the answer UNTIL he knew that there were no twins that is essential. He needed to know that fact in order to solve the problem, and there must be only two different sets of age choices for the kids (one with twins; one without twins) that produce equivalent A's and B's.\n\nNeed a more detailed explanation?\n\nA man is asked what his daughters look like. He answers, \"They are all blondes, but two, all brunettes, but two, and all redheads, but two.\" How many daughters did he have?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThree: one blonde, one brunette and one redhead.\n\nAn old man said to a young man, \"I have a daughter. She has as many brothers as she has sisters. Each one of her brothers has twice as many sisters as he has brothers. How many sons and daughters do I have?\"\n\nReveal Answer\n\n3 sons and 4 daughters (total of 7 children). The answer to this problem can be found with a little algebra. Let S be the number of sons and D be the number of daughters. From the first statement we have: S=(D-1). From the second statement we have: 2(S-1) = D Solving for S and D gives S=3, D=4, i.e., 4 daughters and 3 sons.\n\nThe \"he\" puzzle:\n\nName an English word of more than 2 letters that both begins and ends with the letters 'he' (in that order). (Actually, there are two possible correct answers -- and \"hehe\" is not an acceptable solution.)\n\nReveal Answer\n\nHeadache Or heartache\n\nPill Puzzler\n\nYou've been placed on a course of expensive medication in which you are to take one tablet of medicine A and one tablet of medicine B daily. You must be careful that you take just one of each because taking more of either can have serious side effects. Taking an A without taking a B, or vice versa, can also be very serious, because they must be taken together in order to be effective. In summary, you must take exactly one of the A pills and one of the B pills at one time. Therefore, you open up the A bottle, and you tap one A pill into your hand. You put that bottle aside and you open the B bottle. You do the same, but by mistake, two Bs fall into your hand with the A pill. Now, here's the problem. You weren't watching your hand as the pills fell into it, so you can't tell the A pill apart from the two B pills. The pills look identical. They are the same size, same weight, same color, same everything, and they are not marked differently in any way. What are you going to do? You cannot tell which pill is which, and they cost $100 a piece, so you cannot afford to throw them away and start over again. How do you get your daily dose of exactly one A and exactly one B without wasting any of the pills?\n\n(speaking of throwing things away, don't miss our Reduce, Reuse, Recycle tips!)\n\nReveal Answer\n\nCUT EACH OF THE THREE PILLS IN HALF, AND CAREFULLY SEPARATE THEM INTO TWO PILES, WITH HALF OF EACH PILL IN EACH PILE. You do not know which pill is which, but you are 100% sure that each of the two piles now contains two halves of pill B and half of pill A. Now go back into the pill A box, take out a pill, cut it in half, and add one half to each stack. Now you have two stacks, each one containing two halves of pill A, and two halves of pill B. Take one stack of pills today,and save the second stack for tomorrow. And the problem is solved.\"\n\nVoiceless it cries\n\nwingless flutters\n\ntoothless bites\n\nmouthless mutters\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe wind\n\nIt cannot be seen,cannot be felt\n\ncannot be heard, cannot be smelt\n\nit lies behind stars and under hills\n\nand empty holes it fills\n\nReveal Answer\n\nDarkness\n\nAlive without breath,\n\nas cold as death,\n\nnever thirsty,\n\never drinking,\n\nwhen tired, never winking.\n\nReveal Answer\n\nFish\n\nDies half its life\n\nlives the rest\n\ndances without music\n\nbreathes without breath\n\nReveal Answer\n\nTrees\n\nI live above a star, and yet I never burn,\n\nI have eleven neighbors, and yet none of them turn,\n\nI am visited in sequence, first, last or in between,\n\nPRS (& sometimes Q)are my initials, now tell me what I mean.\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe \"7\" key on a telephone keypad.

The fuses do not burn at a constant rate, so, for example, the last few inches of the first fuse could take 5 minutes or 55 minutes to burn. You have as many matches as you want. With these fuses, you have to measure a time period of exactly 45 minutes. How do you do this?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nFirst light the fuse of 1 hour AT BOTH SIDES AND simultaneously light the fuse of 2 hours AT ONE SIDE. The first fuse will be gone in 0.5 hours. At that time, you light the second end of the fuse of 2 hours: 1.5 hours remain on this fuse. This fuse will now burn in exactly 45 minutes\n\nYou have a rope that will reach around the earth (+/- 40,000 km). If you put sticks of 1 meter high around the world and lay the rope on these sticks, how much longer will the rope need to be?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nONLY 6.28 meter (= 2 PI). And the strange thing is that it even doesn't matter how great the original circle is: it can be 1m, 100m or 1000 km in radius, if you extend the radius by 1 meter, the rope always gets 6.28 meters longer.\n\nProblems in the Elevator: A person lives on the tenth floor of a building. Every day he takes the elevator to go down to the ground floor to go out. When he returns he takes the elevator to the seventh floor and walks up the stairs to reach his apartment on the tenth floor. Only on rainy days does he take the elevator to the tenth floor. He hates the stairs, so why does he do it?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nHe is a young man who cannot yet reach higher than the button for the 7th floor. But on rainy days, he can use his umbrella!\n\nYou have four unmarked bottles of pills each containing 100 tablets. One bottle of pills is poisoned. The good pills weigh exactly 1 gram a piece. The poisoned ones weigh exactly 1.1 gram a piece. You also have use of a scale, but can only use it one time. How can you determine with certainty which bottle of pills is poisoned?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nRemove 1 pill from Bottle 1\n\nRemove 2 pills from Bottle 2\n\nRemove 3 pills from Bottle 3\n\nRemove 4 pills from Bottle 4\n\nCombine the 10 pills and weight them together\n\nIf Bottle 1 has the poisoned pills, the 10 pills will weigh 10.1 grams\n\nIf Bottle 2 has the poisoned pills, the 10 pills will weigh 10.2 grams\n\nIf Bottle 3 has the poisoned pills, the 10 pills will weigh 10.3 grams\n\nIf Bottle 4 has the poisoned pills, the 10 pills will weigh 10.4 grams\n\nAnd the problem is solved.\n\nYou are in a room with 2 doors -- one leads further into the dungeon, one leads to freedom. There are two guards in the room, one at each door. One always tells the truth. One always lies. What one question can you ask one of the guards that will help you pick the door to freedom?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nIf you just wanted to determine which one tells the truth and which lies, you would ask: \"If I were to ask the other guard whether you always tell the truth, what would he say?\" A reply of \"no\" means you are talking to the truth teller, a reply of \"yes\" means you are talking to the liar. So since you only have one question to select the right door, you would have to ask \"If I were to ask the other guard, which door would he say leads to freedom?\" You would then select the door opposite the one he picked.\n\nHere's one for the math wizards: Three companies agree to split the $1,000,000 cost associated with a toxic waste cleanup, as follows: 1) Company A agrees to pay four times the amount of Company B; 2) Company C agrees to pay one-fourth the sum of the amounts paid by Companies A and B. How much will each company pay?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nLet x, y, and z be the amounts paid by Companies A, B, and C respectively. Since the total cost is $1,000,000, we know that x+y+z=1,000,000. From the other two conditions, we have x=4y and z=(x+y)/4 or equivalently, 4z=x+y. Substituting 4z for x+y into the first equation gives 4z+z=1,000,000, 5z=1,000,000 and z=200,000. Of the remaining 800,000 (x+y=800,000), substituting x=4y for x gives 5y=800,000, or y=160,000. Finally x=4y or $640,000. Thus, Company A pays $640,000, Company B pays $160,000 and Company C pays $200,000.\n\nEinstein's Riddle:\n\nEinstein has been widely credited online with the following riddle, and with the claim that 98% of the world could not solve it. But several of our NIEHS scientists were able to solve it, and they said it is not all that hard if you pay attention and are very patient. Give it a try:\n\nThere are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts:\n\nThe Brit lives in the red house.\n\nThe Swede keeps dogs as pets.\n\nThe Dane drinks tea.\n\nThe green house is on the immediate left of the white house.\n\nThe green house's owner drinks coffee.\n\nThe owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.\n\nThe owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.\n\nThe owner living in the center house drinks milk.\n\nThe Norwegian lives in the first house.\n\nThe owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.\n\nThe owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.\n\nThe owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.\n\nThe German smokes Prince.\n\nThe Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n\nThe owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.\n\nThe question is : WHO OWNS THE FISH?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nNote: The suggested steps to the final answer below are not unique and are just one of several logical approaches that one could take to reach the proper solution. First consider color. The Norwegian lives in the first house (Fact 9), which is next to the blue house (fact 14). >Thus, the second house is blue. The green house is to the left of the white house (Fact 4), which means that the green house must be either the third or fourth house. But the green house cannot be the third (center) house, because the owner of the center house drinks milk (Fact 8) and the owner of the green house drinks coffee (Fact 5). Thus, the fourth house is green and the fifth house is white. Since the Norwegian lives in the first house (Fact 9), and the Brit lives in the red house (Fact 1), the first house must be yellow, leaving the middle house red. Next consider drinks. The owner of the red (third) house is a Brit (Fact 1) who drinks milk (Fact 8). The owner of the green (fourth) house drinks coffee (Fact 5). The Norwegian lives in the yellow (first) house. The Dane drinks tea (Fact 3), and must be the owner of either the blue or white house. But he can't be the owner of the white house. If he were, then the beer-drinking Bluemaster smoker (Fact 12) would have to live in the blue house, making the Norwegian in the yellow house drink water. But that can't be right because.... the water drinker lives next to the owner who smokes Blends, not Bluemaster. Thus, the Dane must live in the blue house, and since the beer-drinking, Bluemasters smoker cannot live in the yellow house (because that owner smokes Dunhill), he must live in the white house, leaving the Norwegian in the yellow house drinking water. Next consider nationality. Only the German and Swede are unaccounted for. The German smokes Prince (Fact 13) and thus must live in the green house, since the owner of the white house smokes Bluemaster. Thus, the Swede must live in the white house. What about cigars? Only Blends and Pall Mall are unaccounted for. The Pall Mall smoker rears birds (Fact 6) and thus cannot live in the blue house, which has horses. Thus, the Pall Mall smoker lives in the red house and the Blends smoker in the blue house. Finally, what about pets? The horse and bird owners have been identified. The Swede keeps dogs as pets (Fact 2), which means dogs are pets in the white house. The Blends smoker lives next to the cat owner, which indicates that cats are the pet in the yellow house. And finally, the only pet left (although it is not even mentioned explicitly in the puzzle) is fish, which are the pets of the coffee-drinking, Prince-smoking German living in the green house. And the problem is solved.\n\nSEND + MORE = MONEY\n\nEach letter in the above equation stands for a different number, and each time the same letter appears, it is the same number.

One friend says there is a $100 dollar bill hidden between pages 75 and 76 of a book in the library. But you decide not to go and look for it. Why?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nYou know that the odd number in a book is ALWAYS on the right and the even number is ALWAYS on the left, so since the page numbers you were given could not be facing each other. Therefore, you know for a fact that the money could not be hidden there.\n\nWhere did the other Dollar Go?\n\nThree men check into a hotel, the manager charges them $30 for one room with three beds which they share. The men go to their room and settle in, after a few moments the manager realizes his mistake, he over charged the three men, the room rate was only $25. He sends for the bellhop to return the $5 to the three men. On his way to the room the bellhop realizes that he can't split $5 between 3 men so he decides to give each man $1 and pocket the remaining $2 as a tip. The bellman returns the $1 to each man. In the three mens minds they each paid $9 for the room, or a total of $27, include the $2 tip the bellhop kept and that equals $29, what happened to the other dollar?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nIt's a trick on words that leads you to believe the answer is 30 and has you add the number 2 when you should be subtracting as follows: 3 x $9 = 27, then minus the $2 = $25 which is what they paid for the room. And if you take what they ultimately paid for the room ($25) and add the $3 ($1 each they received), and then add the $2 the bellhop took, you would reach the original $30 that was paid.\n\nSix glasses are in a row.

The blank boxes beneath each word can be used to type in your answers as you think of them.\n\nMonth\n\nOrange\n\nSilver\n\nPurple\n\nReveal Answer\n\nAlthough debated frequently, most sources say that no word in the English language exactly rhymes with any of those words, but that depends on how strictly you want to interpret \"rhyme\". For example, some feel that sporange (the bag that contains spores in some types of mushrooms in the field of botany) rhymes with orange. But the popular \"Ask Marilyn\" column of the newspaper indicated that experts agreed that although the last syllable sounds very similar, neither of the two pronunciations given for sporange in Webster's Third New International Dictionary exactly rhyme with orange.

Try to do so without any coaching!\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe letter e, which is the most common letter in the English language, does not ever appear in the paragraph.\n\nMore detailed explanation for the Postman Riddle:\n\nThe most important feature to recognize in solving this puzzle is that Postman A needed to know that Postman B did not have twins in order to solve the puzzle. That means that there must be two possible solutions that satisfied the \"age in years\" and \"number of windows\" conditions of the problem. He needed to rule out twins to solve the problem. To summarize, there must have been two potential solutions with 3 son's ages having:\n\n(i) equal products (the age condition)\n\n(ii) equal sums (the windows condition)\n\n(iii) one involving twins and one not.\n\nIf you really wanted to be fussy, since a house cannot have a fraction of a window, it also means that the ages of the sons must all be in integers (whole numbers) and not involve fractional ages.\n\nThe one solution to the problem that satisfies all of these conditions is (1, 5, 8) which has the same sum (14) and the same product (40) as another possible solution involving twins (2, 2, 10). There is just no other solution that works involving a postman's age less than 90 years old. That is, another solution that works mathematically is 2-5-9 and 3-3-10, but that would make the postman 90 years old.\n\nIt is a part of us, and then replaced.\n\nIt escapes our bodies to a better place.\n\nThe world becomes its sizable home.\n\nIts passions unrestrained, the planet it roams.\n\nReveal Answer\n\nWater.\n\nI have a face, yet no senses.

About halfway through the trip, it crosses a bridge with a maximum capacity of 2 tons -- any more weight on it, and the bridge will instantly collapse. Just before the truck crosses the bridge, a 2 pound tree limb falls and lands on the roof of the truck and remains there as the truck crosses the bridge. But the bridge does not collapse. Why?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe truck weighs 2 tons only at the beginning of the trip. By the time it reaches the bridge (halfway through the trip) it has used up a lot of gas and therefore weighs considerably less than the maximum limit of the bridge. The weight loss is enough to accommodate the extra weight of the tree limb.\n\nNothing inside, nothing outside, at least that you can see.\n\nI'm as light as a feather, yet ten men can't lift me!\n\nWhat am I?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nA bubble.\n\nWe are five little things of a similar sort.

What is the word?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nHeroine.\n\nA shepherd has one wolf, one lamb, and a bundle of grass. He needs to get all three things from one hill to another. He has to prevent the wolf from eating the lamb and the lamb from eating the grass. The hills are connected by a bridge. He can only carry one thing at a time, so he cannot carry all three at the same time. The wolf will not eat the lamb, and the lamb will not eat the grass as long as the shepherd is there. How does he get them across without one eating the other?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe shepherd should take the lamb first. Then come back for the grass. When he brings the grass to the other hill, he should take the lamb back with him to pick up the wolf. He leaves the lamb on the first hill when he takes the wolf over to the second hill where the grass is. Remember, the wolf and the grass are on the second hill, and the wolf will not eat the grass. Then he can go back and pick up the lamb that he had returned to the first hill. When he takes the lamb back to the second hill, his job is done.\n\nWhat is black when you buy it, red when you use it, and gray when you throw it away?\n\n(speaking of throwing things away, don't miss our Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle tips!)\n\nReveal Answer\n\nCharcoal.\n\nWhat do you throw out when you want to use it, but take in when you don't want to use it?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nAn anchor.\n\nWhen can you add 2 to 11 and get 1 as the correct answer?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nWhen speaking in terms of time -- 2 hours added to 11 o'clock gives you 1 o'clock\n\nYou are given three sacks. Each sack has any number of gold pieces of equal size and shape. However, one sack has only pieces of iron pyrite. The pieces of iron pyrite are equal in size and shape and appearance to the gold pieces, but there is a difference in weight between the gold and the fools gold. Let's say that the pyrite weighs one-half ounce and the gold weighs one ounce. The pieces all look essentially identical, so you cannot tell which sack contains iron pyrite by looking at the pieces. You are then handed a scale, and are allowed to take only one measurement in which you weigh pieces from all three sacks simultaneously. You can decide how many pieces from the sacks that you would like to include in the single weighing. How do you prove which sack has the \"fool's gold\"? Assume that you cannot tell the difference in weight when you are handling the pieces -- you must determine which bag is which only by the total weight reflected on the scale.\n\nReveal Answer\n\nTake one piece from the first bag, two pieces from the second bag, and three pieces from the third bag. Then weigh them. If you get a total of: 5 1/2 ounces= the the first bag had the pyrite (1/2 ounce of pyrite from the first bag, 2 ounces of gold from second bag, and 3 ounces of gold from 3rd bag = 5 1/2 ounces). 5 ounces= then the second bag had the pyrite (one ounce of gold from the first bag, two 1/2 oz. pieces of pyrite from second bag, and 3 ounces of gold from third bag = 5 ounces) 4 1/2 ounces= then the third bag has the pyrite (1 ounce of gold from the first bag, 2 ounces of gold from the second bag, and three 1/2 ounces of pyrite from the third bag = 4 1/2 ounces). You can use this same method to solve the problem regardless of the number of bags involved, or the actual difference in weight.\n\nApples and Oranges: In the garage behind your house, you have three big boxes. One of the boxes is labeled \"Apples\", another one \"Oranges\" and the last one \"Apples and Oranges\". The only thing you know is that none of the labels is correct! How can you correctly re-label all the boxes, if you are only allowed to take out ONE fruit from ONE of the boxes?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nYou take a fruit from the box labeled \"apples and oranges\". If you pull out an apple, then you should put the \"apple\" label on that box. If you pull out an orange, then put the \"orange\" label on that box. Then since you knew all three boxes had incorrect labels, you would switch the remaining two labels as well!\n\nWaiting For A Train: Every day, a wife picks up her husband at the train station at 5:00 p.m. One day he arrives early, at 4:00, and he decides to walk along the same road that his wife will be traveling. She meets him along his way, and takes him home from there. If he had waited at the train station, she would have arrived exactly at 5:00. But having met him along the way, they were able to get home 20 minutes early. So what time was it when she actually picked him up?\n\nReveal Answer\n\n4:50 p.m. (or 10 minutes till 5:00), since she must have saved 10 minutes in both directions.\n\nI know a word of letters three.

A game is played to give the scientists an opportunity to go free. In the game, the scientists are tied in a row so that one scientist can see the backs of the other two in front of him, the scientist in the middle can only see the back of the one scientist in front of him, and the one in the very front cannot see any of the others. They are shown five colored feathers, among which there are three white feathers and two black ones. They are blindfolded and each of them is given a feather from the group of five to put in the back of his hair. Then the blindfolds are taken off, and they are asked to call out the color of their own feather as soon as they can tell what it is, without discussing it with the others first. If even one of them can guess the correct color of his feather, all three of them will be released. A little time passes and none of them speaks...then the man bound to the very first stake (who actually can't see anybody) correctly names the color of his own feather. What thoughts lead to his conclusion?\n\nReveal Answer\n\nIf the third man (who can see both of the others) had seen two black feathers in front of him, he would have immediately been able to say that he himself must have a white feather (since there are only two black feathers). But he didn't say anything. Given this fact, if the second scientist had seen a black feather in front of him, he would have been able to tell that his feather was white. But he, too, didn't say a word. Therefore the man in front can deduce that his feather is white.\n\nThe Family Reunion: At a recent family reunion, the family consisted of 1 grandfather, 1 grandmother, 2 fathers, 2 mothers, 4 children, 3 grandchildren, 1 brother, 2 sisters, 2 sons, 2 daughters, 1 father-in-law, 1 mother-in-law, and 1 daughter-in-law.
