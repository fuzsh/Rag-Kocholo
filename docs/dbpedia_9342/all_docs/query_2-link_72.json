        "text": "You know Sal Vulcano from the hit Tru TV prank show \"Impractical Jokers\" but he's also an accomplished stand up comedian. Sal is very busy right now, his new special \"Terrified\" is available on Youtube and he's out on a new comedy tour, with new material called \"Everything's Fine.\"\n\nThe \"Everything's Fine Tour\" comes to the Warner Theater in Torrington, Connecticut on February 27th. Sal joined us on the Tuesday (08/06/24) edition of the I-95 Morning Show to talk about the tour, the special, the TV show and take shots at Murr. These are some of our favorite moments from that chat.\n\nLou: Let's talk about your stand up comedy. You're latest special is available on Youtube right now, it's called \"Terrified.\" I think this makes sense to fans of \"Impractical Jokers\" because we've seen on the show you have some fears that we're all aware of like germs and things like cats and Amen to that, F-- cats! I always say F-- cats. Was there a deeper meaning to all of this or it's literally about your fears?\n\nSal: \"I didn't know I could say that on air but F-- em'. So yeah, the special is a collection of like stories and things from my life from childhood to adulthood that were just insanely scary to me. You know me now, you could imagine me as a kid like I was afraid of the tooth fairy, I was afraid of thunder, I was afraid of getting my temperature taken with the thermometer up my ass. I mean, \"The rhythm is gonna get you\" was a huge song by Gloria Estefan and The Miami Sound Machine, I was afraid of the rhythm.\"\n\nLou: Is there someone out of the four of you guys on \"Impractical Jokers\" who is known for presenting ideas for the show that are either terrible or just so insane, they're never gonna make it to the air?\n\nSal: \"Haha, well I mean look, we go in a room together and just throw everything against the wall so sometimes it's hard to realize who came up with the seed of it. \"Q\" (Brian Quinn) comes up with a lot of really off-the-wall really insane things. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't like last season he came up with two insane ideas. One failed miserably, like we're in a waiting room and we had to get very, very, very upset about the most minute thing like oh the waiting room didn't have free Wi-Fi. We had to go nuts and then we had to get so worked up that we fake vomited. It was called \"Boot and Rally\" and then after we vomited we had to convince everybody, let's get the hell out of here together, they don't have free Wi-Fi! The idea was that you got so furious over nothing, then you threw up and then after throwing up, you had to convince all of these people to follow the guy who just threw up because it was unacceptable that there was no Wi-Fi.\"\n\nLou: Yeah, it's the whose coming with me Jerry Maguire moment.\n\nSal: \"That is literally, exactly how we phrased it, it was the Jerry Maguire thing. Nobody is even going to look up at us, we're insane for being that mad about the Wi-Fi and then we are vomiting everywhere, no one is gonna and he's like no we've got to try it and no one, no one, no one even looked at us and we leaned into that.\"\n\nHere was Sal's Attempt\n\nThis was Q's Try\n\nMurr's Boot and Rally\n\nListen to our complete two-part interview with Sal Vulcano below.\n\nPart 1 - Sal talked about why people love the Impractical Jokers, how Murr can destroy ratings, his fear of cats and accidentally smoking hash in Amsterdam.\n\nPart 2 - Vulcano shared the story of meeting the other guys from Impractical Jokers during Freshman year of high school in religion class.\n\nCheck out the Ethan, Lou & Large Dave Show Podcast on Apple & Spotify\n\nThese 6 Restaurants Have the Best French Fries in Connecticut\n\n32 Connecticut Street Names That Will Make Any Man-Child Laugh\n\nThe Nutmeg State is loaded with bizzare and funny street names.
