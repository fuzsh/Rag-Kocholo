        "text": "DULUTH, Minn. (KBJR/Gray News) - The Lake Superior Zoo announced Monday the death of Pip, one of the zoo’s red pandas.\n\nZoo officials said Pip died overnight and was found in her den box Friday morning.\n\nZoo staff said security camera footage shows Pip went into her den box at about 10 p.m. Thursday and did not come out again.\n\nThey add there was no unusual behavior or interactions between the animals or guests that would have contributed to Pip’s death.\n\nPip was a 1-year-old red panda who arrived in Duluth on April 8.\n\nShe was introduced to Zoozee, the zoo’s other red panda, in June.\n\nPip came from a zoo in Massachusetts. She was small at birth, leading to her name, Pipsqueak.\n\nThe staff at Lake Superior Zoo said they are heartbroken and seeking answers.\n\n“Each and every staff member at the zoo is devastated by the loss of Pip,” said Haley Hedstrom, chief executive officer of the Lake Superior Zoo. “Though she was with us for only a short time, we all quickly fell in love with her charismatic personality. We appreciate the community’s understanding and support at this time.”\n\nPip has been taken to the University of Minnesota for pathology, which is a standard practice.\n\nThe Lake Superior Zoo will share findings from the examinations and expects to have that information within the next several weeks.\n\nAnimal care staff is monitoring Zoozee, and the zoo said she continues to be in good health.\n\nThe zoo is confident this was an individualized incident.\n\nThe Lake Superior Zoo will continue to support the Red Panda Species Survival Plan for any recommendations of new companions for Zoozee.\n\n“Pip stole the hearts of all who cared for her,” said Director of Animal Care Lizzy Larson. “She had a big personality for her small size. Pip has left a lasting mark on all her keepers and she will be dearly missed.”"
