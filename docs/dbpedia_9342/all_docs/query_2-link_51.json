        "text": "Walking abnormalities\n\nWalking abnormalities can be caused by many different types of problems. Problems with the joints, (such as arthritis), bones (such as deformities), circulation (such as peripheral vascular disease), or even pain can make it difficult to walk properly. Diseases or injuries to the nerves, muscles, brain, spinal cord, or inner ear can affect normal walking.\n\nThe pattern of how a person walks is called the gait. Different types of walking problems occur without a person's control. Most, but not all, are due to a physical condition.\n\nSome walking abnormalities have been given names:\n\nPropulsive gait -- a stooped, stiff posture with the head and neck bent forward.\n\nSpastic gait -- a stiff, foot-dragging walk caused by a long muscle contraction on one side.\n\nScissoring gait -- legs flexed slightly at the hips and knees like crouching, with the knees and thighs hitting or crossing in a scissors-like movement. A scissoring gait is often a more severe form of a spastic gait.\n\nSteppage gait -- foot drop where the foot hangs with the toes pointing down, causing the toes to scrape the ground while walking, requiring someone to lift the leg higher than normal when walking.\n\nWaddling gait -- a duck-like walk that may appear in childhood or later in life.\n\nAtaxic, or broad-based, gait -- feet wide apart with irregular, jerky, and weaving or slapping when trying to walk.\n\nMagnetic gait -- shuffling with feet feeling as if they stick to the ground.\n\nAntalgic gait -- when pain prevents the normal motion of the feet or legs.\n\nShuffling gait -- when the feet don't lift normally and slide on the ground, often due to Parkinson disease.\n\nAbnormal gait may be caused by diseases in different areas of the body.\n\nGeneral causes of abnormal gait may include:\n\nArthritis of the spine, hip, leg, or foot joints\n\nConversion disorder (a mental disorder)\n\nFoot problems (such as a callus, corn, ingrown toenail, wart, pain, skin sore, swelling, or spasms)\n\nBroken bone\n\nInjections into muscles that causes soreness in the leg or buttocks\n\nInfection\n\nInjury\n\nLegs that are of different lengths\n\nInflammation or swelling of the muscles (myositis)\n\nShin splints\n\nShoe problems\n\nInflammation or swelling of the tendons (tendinitis)\n\nTorsion of the testis\n\nBrain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve diseases\n\nVision problems\n\nInner ear problems\n\nThis list does not include all causes of abnormal gait.\n\nCAUSES OF SPECIFIC GAITS\n\nPropulsive gait:\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\n\nManganese poisoning\n\nParkinson disease\n\nUse of certain drugs, including phenothiazines, haloperidol, thiothixene, loxapine, and metoclopramide (usually, drug effects are temporary)\n\nSpastic or scissoring gait:\n\nAutoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus\n\nBrain abscess\n\nBrain or head trauma\n\nBrain tumor\n\nStroke\n\nCerebral palsy\n\nCervical spondylosis with myelopathy (a problem with the vertebrae in the neck)\n\nInfections such as Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, and others\n\nLiver failure\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS)\n\nSpinal cord trauma\n\nSpinal cord tumor\n\nNeurosyphilis (bacterial infection of the brain or spinal cord due to syphilis)\n\nSyringomyelia (collection of cerebrospinal fluid that forms in the spinal cord)\n\nVitamin or mineral deficiency (low Vitamin B12, Vitamin E, or copper levels)\n\nSteppage gait:\n\nNeuropathy such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and hereditary neuropathy\n\nHerniated lumbar disk\n\nMultiple sclerosis\n\nMuscle weakness of the tibia\n\nPeroneal neuropathy\n\nPolio\n\nSpinal cord injury\n\nMuscle diseases\n\nThe conditions that cause spastic or scissoring gait can also cause steppage gait.\n\nWaddling gait:\n\nCongenital hip dysplasia\n\nMuscular dystrophy (group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue)\n\nMuscle disease (myopathy)\n\nSpinal muscle atrophy\n\nAtaxic, or broad-based, gait:\n\nCerebellar ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movement due to disease or injury to the cerebellum in the brain)\n\nChiari or other malformation\n\nAlcohol intoxication\n\nBrain injury\n\nProgressive damage to nerve cells in the cerebellum of the brain (cerebellar degeneration)\n\nMedicines (phenytoin and other anti-seizure medicines)\n\nPolyneuropathy (damage to many nerves, as occurs with diabetes)\n\nStroke or bleeding in the cerebellum\n\nMagnetic gait:\n\nDisorders that affect the front part of the brain\n\nHydrocephalus (increased fluid in the brain)\n\nHome Care\n\nTreating the underlying cause often improves the gait. For example, gait abnormalities from trauma to part of the leg will improve as the leg heals.\n\nPhysical therapy almost always helps with short-term or long-term gait disorders. Therapy will reduce the risk for falls and other injuries.\n\nFor an abnormal gait that occurs with conversion disorder, counseling and support from family members are strongly recommended.\n\nFor any gait problem that is likely to be long term, reduce fall risk by modifying one's surroundings. Keep pathways well-lit and free of clutter like wires and other hazards. Remove loose rugs and install grab bars or railings.\n\nFor a propulsive gait:\n\nEncourage the person to be as independent as possible.\n\nAllow plenty of time for daily activities, especially walking. People with this problem are likely to fall because they have poor balance and are always trying to catch up.\n\nProvide walking assistance for safety reasons, especially on uneven ground.\n\nSee a physical therapist for exercise therapy and walking retraining.\n\nFor a scissoring or spastic gait:\n\nPeople with a scissoring gait often lose skin sensation. Skin care should be used to avoid skin sores.\n\nLeg braces and in-shoe splints can help keep the foot in the right position for standing and walking. A physical therapist can supply these and provide exercise therapy, if needed.\n\nExercises are encouraged.\n\nA cane or a walker is recommended for those with poor balance.\n\nMedicines (muscle relaxers, anti-spasticity medicines) can reduce the muscle overactivity.\n\nFor a steppage gait:\n\nGet enough rest. Fatigue can often cause a person to stub a toe and fall.\n\nLeg braces or orthoses and in-shoe splints can help keep the foot in the best position for standing and walking. A physical therapist can supply these and provide exercise therapy, if needed. For some, a high-top boot may be sufficient.\n\nFor a waddling gait, follow the treatment your health care provider prescribed. Bracing, canes and walkers can be of help.\n\nFor a magnetic gait due to hydrocephalus, walking may improve after the excess fluid is treated.\n\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\nIf there is any sign of uncontrollable and unexplained gait abnormalities, contact your provider.\n\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\n\nThe provider will take a medical history and perform a physical examination.\n\nMedical history questions may include:\n\nTime pattern, such as when the problem started, and if it came on suddenly or gradually\n\nType of gait disturbance, such as any of those mentioned above\n\nOther symptoms, such as pain and its location, paralysis, whether there's been a recent infection\n\nWhat medicines are being taken\n\nInjury history, such as leg, head, or spinal injury\n\nOther illnesses such as polio, tumors, stroke, or other blood vessel problems\n\nIf there have been recent treatments such as vaccinations, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy\n\nSelf and family history, such as birth defects, diseases of the nervous system, growth problems, problems of the spine\n\nThe physical examination will include muscle, bone, and nervous system examination. The provider will decide which tests to do based on the results of the physical examination.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nGait abnormalities\n\nMagee DJ, Manske RC. Assessment of gait.
