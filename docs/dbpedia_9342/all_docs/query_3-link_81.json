        "text": "To help you understand what to expect and feel comfortable about your upcoming MRI, we will email you an online informational video to view in advance. You can also learn more about the process on at radiologyinfo.org and on our website.\n\nBefore your exam, you will need to complete our MRI screening questionnaire to make sure the MRI staff, technologist and radiologist have essential information about any implants or other conditions they need to be aware of. The questionnaire will be available in MyChart prior to your appointment and during check-in the day of your exam.\n\nIf you are running late on the day of your exam, please call the specific UCSF Radiology location where your exam is scheduled to see if your appointment can still be accommodated.\n\nIf you need to reschedule your exam, please call UCSF Radiology Scheduling at (415) 353-3900.\n\nIf your doctor has prescribed medication to prevent claustrophobia or if you will require anesthesia to help you tolerate the MRI, or if you have a pacemaker, you will require additional time to prepare for the exam.\n\nFor pediatric or adult patients requiring anesthesia will receive a phone from a staff member a few days in advance of your appointment to set an earlier arrival time.\n\nPlan on at least 1.5 to 2 hours for your MRI exam from check-in to checkout. If your doctor has ordered multiple exams, your appointment may take longer.\n\nSometimes we encounter unexpected delays, due to emergencies or appointments that take longer than anticipated. We do everything we can to keep things running smoothly and on time, and we will give you the time you need for a thorough exam. However, we recommend leaving enough time between your MRI exam and other appointments or obligations. We also recommend bringing reading material with you in case you need to wait.\n\nMRI usually requires no dietary changes or other special preparations. Unless indicated in your exam preparation instructions in MyChart, you can eat and drink and take your regular medications as usual.\n\nIf you wear a medication patch or glucose monitoring patch it will need to be removed at the time of your exam for your safety. Before your exam, talk to your physician about removing and discarding your patch. Your physician can advise you about replacing your patch after the scan.\n\nYour MRI will be interpreted by a UCSF radiologist, who will then write a report detailing the findings in your exam. After the report is finalized – typically within two to five working days – you can access this report and your images in MyChart.\n\nPlease note, because your results are available in MyChart immediately after they are finalized by the Radiologist, your care team may not have yet reviewed the report.\n\nNotifications about new test results are sent to patients via MyChart once daily between 8 and 9 a.m., Monday through Friday (excluding holidays). If you’d rather receive notifications as soon as test results are available, you can update your preferences in MyChart.\n\nIf you’re not on MyChart, you can sign up online. For any assistance you need signing up, contact MyChart Customer Service at (415) 514-6000.\n\nYour report may contain complex words and information. You can discuss your results with your care team at your next visit, by telephone, or with MyChart messaging. If you do not have a visit scheduled and need to schedule one, please contact your referring provider through MyChart or by calling the referring provider’s office directly.\n\nFor pediatric patients requiring Child Life Services, the responsible family member will be contacted with instructions for an earlier arrival time.\n\nFor pediatric patients requiring anesthesia, the responsible family member will be contacted with instructions for an earlier arrival time.\n\nMRI examinations require that the patient hold still for long periods of time. We provide MRI-compatible CinemaVision goggles (which are found in very few imaging centers) so that our young patients can watch movies during their MRI procedure. Patients can either choose a movie from our movie list or bring one from home. Watching an entertaining movie helps children remain comfortable and still, and it minimizes the need for anesthesia.\n\nWe invite our younger patients to watch this video to get ready for their MRI:"
