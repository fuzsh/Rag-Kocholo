Good morning!

You need to calm the fuck down.

Perfect for people who, even after two cups of coffee, are still not chipper.

This magnet is perfect for your office fridge, showcasing its deeply thoughtful words in a 2 x 3 inch stainless steel rectangle piece with a high gloss finish and a flat magnetic back so it sticks easily to any metal surface, and tells people to maybe tone it the fuck down around you.
