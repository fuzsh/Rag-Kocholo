        "text": "Columbus, Ohio USA\n\nRETURN TO HOMEPAGE www.shortnorth.com\n\nEric Broder\n\nCleveland writer Eric Broder\n\nEric Broder's weekly column, The Great Indoors, ran for many years in Cleveland alternative papers The Cleveland Edition and Free Times.\n\nVisit https://www.facebook.com/eric.broder.7 | email erictbroder@yahoo.com\n\nSEE June 19, 1998 profile Area Humorist hits 'below the belt,' by Michael Drexler in the Cleveland Jewish News\n\nPublications include The Great Indoors: Favorites 1987-1996 (1999) and Below-The-Belt Manager (1998)\n\nRETURN TO HOMEPAGE www.shortnorth.com\n\n[December 1990] January/February 2020 Dream Husband\n\nThe other day I was sitting on our couch quietly weeping. My wife Barbara came up to me and said, “Are you crying, honey?”\n\n“Yes, I am,” I replied, “I was crying tears of joy, thinking about how lucky you are to be married to me.”\n\nAnd I was. I was so happy for her. Imagine, fortune blessing you with a perfect husband like myself, a snappy, peppy bundle of good looks and charm mixed with a childlike sense of wonder. Imagine Lady Luck bestowing on you such a dynamic formula for a mate, made up of equal parts virility (the bushy eyebrows), keen, probing intellect (the high forehead) and imposing physicality (the big breasts and shoulders). Is it any wonder I was moved by this? It’s like a little miracle, every day, for Barbara.\n\nNow you fellows out there might be thinking, How do I hitch my wagon to this guy’s star? Well, I’ll tell you: it’s the little things that matter. I know by bitter experience that it’s sometimes not enough merely to be wonderful. Sometimes you have to give a little, too. I know it hurts. But I do it. And knowing that I do contributes to the overall warmth and joy I feel when I think about my wife’s marvelous gift and blessing: namely, me.\n\nFor instance, when Barbara calls me on the phone at work, I say “Yes, How may I help you?” This is: 1) politeness. There’s no reason not to be polite just because it’s your wife; 2) a genuine and sincere inquiry. The accent on “How” says to Barbara, “Just what is it exactly that you want?” She appreciates the desire for specificity; 3) much better than the grunted “Whut?” that you probably give your mate. Now isn’t it? Alternatives: “Yes. How delightful to hear from you” (for the lighter moment) or “Yes. What can I do to help you today?” The little things.\n\nAt home, I’m just as cordial. When Barbara does something wrong, I don’t get angry. I smile and say, “Now that’s not\n\nthe way we do things. That kind of trash doesn’t fly here.” When she’s bothering me, I respond by crying out, then running into the bedroom. But after a few minutes I come out, saying “I have decided to forgive you,” waving my hands around magnanimously like the Godfather. This shows true humanity—not to mention true class.\n\nWhat about romance? What about toujours, toujours, l’amour? There’s certainly a place for that in any relationship. Just last night, I was in the supermarket with Barbara and I saw an attractive woman go by me in the aisle. I stood there smirking and nodding in approval, much like the fellow in that auto parts commercial several years back. You know, the guy who sold auto parts to those chicks wearing the Daisy Mae outfits, the checked blouses exposing their stomachs and the hot jean shorts. You remember the ad. Anyway, I did that to show Barbara I was a romantic person with a heart alive to love. And I think she appreciated it.\n\nWhen Barbara speaks to me romantically, I know how to give it right back. How important is this? Plenty. When somebody tells you they love you, you don’t say “That’s your problem.” You act nice. You give a response in kind, as I do. When my wife says “I love you,” I say “That’s very commendable. Thanks so much.” Or “Who can blame you?”, or its variant “I don’t blame you.” The confident “Doubtlessly.” The cocky “And why wouldn’t you?” The regal “As you will.” But my favorite is the tender response – those three little words.\n\n“I do, too.”\n\n[12-20-90; Dec. 2005] November/December 2019\n\nLast Year's Christmas Party\n\nAs I sit here waiting to go to our office Christmas party, I think back to last year's bash. I hope this year I don't have to do what I did then.\n\nLast year the party was held at a bar downtown. (I won't mention the name.) For the first hour, not much happened. I chatted with my co-workers and gave them advice on everything from romance to proper nutrition. As usual, they gathered around me and hung on every word.\n\nSomething was missing, though. The music from the bar's stereo system wasn't moving me. I'm a party man and I like to dance - to kick out, as it were. So I mentally devised a playlist and told the bartender to program it on the CD multi-changer.\n\nWhen I heard the first few notes of \"Celebration\" by Kool and the Gang - my signature tune - I spun in place my patented 10 times to signal that I was ready to go. My co-workers gasped and backed away. I stopped in my tracks, pointed up, and began swiveling my hips slowly. I heard moans. I strutted out to the dance floor, the bar patrons parting for me as I advanced.\n\nAs \"Celebration\" continued, I hopped from one foot to the other in perfect synchronization with the beat, my hands fluttering like disco birds. Beautiful women stared at my body as it pulsated to the music, and when I winked at one of them and hollered \"Yeah, hoo!\" along with Kool after the refrain, I saw her fall to the floor, swooning in ecstasy.\n\nWhen I started dancing to the Village People's \"Macho Man,\" there was general panic and screaming. As I thrust my hips and shouted \"Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey!\" at the song's crucial point, several women came at me and pulled at my disco scarf. They looked at me like I was an hors d'oeuvre more delicious than caviar. \"Are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?\" asked one, leering. \"I don't know,\" I replied coyly. \"Maybe.\" Always leave them tantalized!\n\nSuddenly there was a commotion at the door. Two gunmen had busted in, yelling for people to lie down. One stood near the door, waving his nickel-plated Smith and Wesson at the crowd. The other ran through the bar, poking people with his gun while shouting instructions. People dropped to the floor quickly. I got down on my stomach and watched through narrowed eyes the gunman's movements. The guy at the door would stand pat, I knew. I began to formulate my plan.\n\nThe gunman moved through the prone crowd, collecting wallets and purses. When he got to me, I slapped my hand over his as he went for the billfold in my hip pocket. \"I'll hold onto that, if you don't mind,\" I said crisply. \"I work hard for both my cash and credit cards.\" He couldn't believe it.\"\n\nWhy, you ______ fruitcake!\" he exclaimed, and kicked me in the stomach as I lay there.My breath rushed out of me, but I managed to snarl \"You're quite a nerd!\" I was baiting him. I could see he was going to kick me in the face. But this time I was too fast for him.\n\nI grabbed his leg and pulled him down. The gun went off just before I squeezed his wrist, making him release the weapon. Because I had calculated the exact angle of the shot before I made my move, the bullet had been fired harmlessly into the west wall of the bar. I had just enough time, too, to stuff the gun into my pants to keep it from the gunman, who I was now spinning on my feet as I lay on the floor. All my breakdancing skills were coming into play. I stopped spinning the gunman, cocked my legs, and catapulted him against the wall, knocking him out.\n\nThe other fellow was easier. I inserted my pinkie into an empty beer bottle lying nearby, took aim, and flung it at him. It struck him in the forehead, and he fell soundlessly to the floor.\n\nI leapt up and looked around to make sure everyone was all right. After everyone had gingerly gotten to their feet, I called the police to come pick up their goods.\n\nMy job wasn't over yet. People were still shaken up, so I whispered something to the bartender. He nodded and went over to the CD player.\n\nPeople shrieked when they heard the selection. It was \"Superfreak\" by Rick James, my specialty dance that I do only under extraordinary circumstances. The crowd watched, spellbound, as I bumped and ground through the number in the manner that had become legendary. After a few minutes of this spectacle they'd totally forgotten the recent upleasantness.\n\nThis year, though, I'd like to relax at the office Christmas party.\n\n[March 1987] July/August 2019 Amazing Stories! The Great Indoors\n\nI suppose you think that because this article is titled “The Great Indoors” its author never goes outside. Just a couch potato who watches TV and eats Smokehouse almonds all night. A shlub who shuffles around the apartment giving himself carpet shocks. A guy to whom nothing happens.\n\nMost of that is right. I do give myself shocks because I don’t pick up my feet when I walk. I’m trying to conquer this.\n\nI do watch a lot of TV. I admit I lie around on my can quite a bit. However, lots of things happen to me – amazing and exciting things. And they happen indoors.\n\nI’d like to begin with my most exciting indoor incident. It involves Irma La Douce and a roach. Barbara and I went to the video store one summer evening last year and rented two movies on videodisc, Irma La Douce and A Thousand Clowns. We watched A Thousand Clowns and enjoyed it very much. It was funny and heartwarming. Thought-provoking, too. It was dynamite entertainment, and I recommend it without reservation.\n\nAnyway, we finished watching that and put on Irma La Douce. This movie was directed by Billy Wilder, one of my favorites. It wasn’t very good, but it was a handsome production, set in Paris and starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.\n\nI should mention at this juncture that it was brutally hot and humid that night, and I was only wearing shorts. Total vulnerability! Naked human flesh that any vermin would be delighted to chew on! This is important to the story.\n\nSo we are watching this movie and having a fine time when we hear a small scuffling sound come from around the TV. We’re not children. We know this is a bug or a rat. In this kind of weather you expect them. But you don’t like them around, that’s for sure.\n\nI instructed our cat, Vince, to flush the animal out and kill it, but she was not interested and went away. I tiptoed over to the TV and peered behind it. There it was: a roach, a good-sized one. I could say it looked up at me and spit, but that would be embellishing an already exciting story.\n\nI clapped my fingers against my palm like a schoolteacher to frighten it out into the open. That didn’t work. I stomped my foot. The roach only moved his leg a little. At that point I decided to sit back down and just wait and enjoy the rest of Irma La Douce.\n\nWe didn’t have to wait long. The movie was almost over when the roach came out. We expected him to run off to the side of the room somewhere and disappear. But he didn’t. He came charging at us like L.A. Raider defensive lineman Howie Long! I can still hear him galloping across the room: pittapittapittapitta. I’d like to say I met him head on, but I squealed and bounded up onto the couch. Barbara moved fast but didn’t scream like I did. The roach went under the couch.\n\nWe determined that this roach had to go or we’d be hostages to fear. I lifted the couch and there he was, going to the lavatory. Barbara put a plastic cup down on top of him. Caught! But now the hard part. Sliding the top of the container under the bug. I told Barbara that I would do this, since it was my home and thus my bug. She held the couch up, and I carefully started sliding the lid under the roach’s legs.\n\nI got him, and carried the cup to the incinerator in the apartment building’s back hall. I tried to throw the roach down the incinerator, but he flew back at me and landed with a thud near my feet. I jumped around a little, then raced back into the apartment, locking him out. It was a narrow escape.\n\nThat was the roach story. This next one is a little less heroic, but again proves there is as much danger indoors as there is out.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was to take a car trip up to Northern Michigan. The night before I left, I foolishly drank to excess. I woke up early, and felt keen pain all over my body, and was not at my best mentally, either.\n\nIn my little second-floor apartment I had a Carry-Cool air conditioner balanced in the window, held down by the sash. I knew I had to bring the unit in because I would be gone three weeks. I staggered over to the window and had just lifted the sash. Instantly I knew I had made a mistake. I forgot to hold onto the air conditioner!\n\nHow can I possibly convey the thrill I felt at that moment, when I knew my air conditioner was falling out of my second-story window! I was conscious of the sound it was making: whizzzzzzz. And then crash, of course. It was an exciting few seconds in my life; perhaps the most exciting. I really knew I was alive. Though at that particular time I did wish I was dead.\n\nI looked out of the window, and down. There was the air conditioner all right, lying on the concrete driveway. It was broken. It looked like a cartoon burlesque of a broken thing, springs coming out of it, nuts and bolts scattered. It looked like that then, anyway. I rushed outside, gathered it up and put it by the trash.\n\nThat was it for the air conditioner.\n\nThese are just a few stories from the indoor world of adventure. I could think of plenty more, like when the Great Blizzard of ‘78 shattered my storm window when I had the flu. But I think I’ve made my point.\n\n[April 1999] January/February 2019 A Winning Bathroom\n\nSometimes I have to laugh when I look in other people’s bathrooms. These people don’t know what they’re doing. They’ve got tidy, shiny little shrines with glistening glass, porcelain and tile, everything in its place, everything just so. But what I want to know is this: Where’s the humanity in this sterile, clinical milieu? Where’s the magic?\n\nMagic and humanity. Form and function. That’s what I’ve got in my bathroom. You say, “We know your bathroom’s a winner, but why? Describe it, and maybe throw in your general bathroom philosophy.” Excellent! I will!\n\nMy bathroom is small. It has a shower stall rather than a tub, which is fine with me. I don’t like sitting in used bath water, even if it’s my own. If you think I’m persnickety, let me ask you this. How many bad dreams do you have about taking cool, refreshing showers, as opposed to bad dreams about taking baths in filthy, used water? It’s the age-old conflict of standing and receiving health and invigoration in a pulsating shower vs. sitting and wallowing in tepid gray water containing bits of sock material that come floating up from between your toes. My vote’s for health and invigoration. Maybe I’m the one that’s crazy, I don’t know.\n\nIn any event, I don’t have a bathtub. But I do have a shower caddy, which holds my bar of soap. This leads, of course, to the question of how long do I let the bar of soap go before I replace it. Do I let it get to the half- or one-third-bar point, to the medium sliver point – or all the way to the extreme sliver (or breaking) point, where one vigorous rub can split that baby in two?\n\nI replace it somewhere between the medium and extreme sliver point, where it is then transferred to the sink soap dish for hand and face washing use. Not thrown out! Even if I falter and the bar splits during my shower, I then transfer one or both portions to the sink soap dish. Some of you don’t have the stomach – the guts – to keep soap slivers in plain sight in your bathroom. Who are you afraid of? Leona Helmsley? The woman’s in prison, for God’s sake. She’s not going to check up on you. Caked soap scum under the slivers, however ... that’s a different matter. That I try to keep under control. (Hint: When the caked soap scum turns green, you know you’ve waited too long to remove it. Try to get rid of it while it’s still gooey.)\n\nI keep my sink and “facility” fairly clean, but not consistently sparkling. What’s the fun of keeping them sparkling when it’s so much more satisfying to see them freshly, brightly cleaned after several previous weeks of relative dinginess? My rule of thumb is if the top ledge of your white sink begins to get brown, it’s time to sprinkle on the cleanser. While you’re there, you may as well get the basin too. That’s killing two birds with one stone.\n\nAs my “facility” is right next to the sink, I then pour cleanser into the bowl, sponge, and flush. Then a quick swipe with the sponge on the seat and lid. Three birds! And I don’t have to mess with it again for a while.\n\nMirrors pretty much take care of themselves. In five years I’ve probably only Windexed my bathroom mirror four times. Why be a fanatic about it? Every few weeks I give it a wipe with wet toilet paper, followed by a towel rub, which is plenty. As long as I’m getting a general image of myself, that’s all I need. If I absolutely have to see more detail, I can always Windex it. See the flexibility this gives me?\n\nSpace won’t permit me to go into the philosophy and particulars of cleaning my bathroom floor, but I can deal with this exciting annual event in a future column. I’ll also address my utility towel strategy, the in-the-medicine-cabinet-or-out-in-plain-sight question, and the subject Shower Tile Mildew: It May Be Unsightly But You Can Let It Go For A Little While, Anyway.\n\n[March1997, Sept 2009] November/December 2018 Hair Dye\n\nI have been noting with considerable interest the Just for Men hair dye commercials on TV. I’m thinking of doing that – dyeing my hair back to its original brown (the sex color). I can change the way I look in just five minutes. In one Just for Men ad, a cop doesn’t believe the driver he stopped is the same person on the driver’s license, because the guy looks so much younger with his dyed hair. I want to get to that point, where people don’t know who I am anymore. I want people to think I wasn't even born when Saturday Night Fever came out.\n\nI’d even consider really lathering in the Just for Men, so I’d end up looking like a teen. To be carded in a bar again? That’d be heaven. “You got ID, kid? ... Oh, excuse me, sir. You know, I gotta tell ya, you look like you’re fresh out of junior high. This vodka’s on me.” And the bartender would turn to his co-workers and whisper, “Such a youthful appearance. What’s his secret?” I could even slather on the stuff to get myself back to the elementary school look. That would be excellent on so many levels.\n\nPresently I’ve got large patches of gray in my beard and around my ears, in my regular hair. I look at myself and I’m troubled. This isn’t supposed to happen to people like me. Some people tell me it looks “dignified.” I don’t want to look dignified, I want to look “boss” and “cool” and “down with myself.” I want to boogie the night away. If you try to boogie with gray hair, people think you’re an old rat bastard. You just look like you’re trying to hang on to youth. You add to that the wisps of hair growing out of my ear lobes, my growing eyebrow tufts, my various tongue woes – and you’ve clearly got yourself a guy whose best days were in the early ‘80s.\n\nSo I’m going to do it. They say you can dye your hair gradually, so no one will notice the change. I hope that’s the case. You can’t just be gray one day and totally brown the next. You will be mocked at the office. But I read on the box that even you may not notice the change. How can you change the color of your hair without noticing it? This makes me nervous.\n\nI might test an inconspicuous portion of my body hair with a bit of dye – as you would do with bleach on your clothes to test color-fastness – to see what happens.\n\nI could dye my armpit hair, for example, although that’s not graying. If I made my armpit hair a tad browner, no one would notice or, I dare say, care. What I would do is comb some Just for Men in my armpit, hold my arms up in front of the bathroom mirror, and scientifically observe any changes. “Don’t blink, you might miss it,” you say. Don’t I know it! I’ll just stand there until something happens.\n\nIf everything goes well, I’ll comb a little in my chest hairs, repeating the same observational process. Then I’ll put some in the hair on my legs, arms, unmentionables, etc., until I’m fully browner. Then I’ll have the confidence to apply the concoction to my on-top hair.\n\nPerhaps I’ll have my wife Barbara take before and after photos of me, like in the TV ads. What I’ll do is look down-in-the-mouth in the first, gray photos – here’s the old, tired rat bastard – then look progressively more cheerful in the middle photos where you see the gray being gradually eradicated. (I’m rehearsing the different smile levels for these middle photos.)\n\nThen the ultimate photo, where I’m completely brown and happy, with an open-mouthed grin, even displaying a bit of tongue, as Bugs Bunny does in his publicity photos. That’s the youthful look. That’s the now look. In just five minutes!\n\n[2-14-96] July/August 2018\n\nGeneration Gap\n\nI don’t know what’s wrong with today’s young people. The more I talk to them, the stranger they seem to me.\n\nI’ve always been a with it, now, a-go-go person, but these people come from a different world. I don’t understand their points of reference. The way they talk, and what they know ... well, it’s totally different from how I talk and what I know.\n\nSome of the phrases they use ... As if. Whatever. Duuuude. You rule! Babe. Hell-o? Boink. Do. Postal. Jammin’. Well, duh. I’m sure I’m already a couple of years behind on these, but it might as well be thirty years. You might say I’m “clueless” (heh, heh).\n\nFor example, I was talking to Casey, an account executive here, and we were talking about slimming down our pot bellies. He said to me, “I was looking at my stomach and I’m like, whatever.”\n\nWhat this means is that Casey looked down at his pot belly, said to himself (“I’m like”), “I don’t care if I do have a distended belly. I’m going to eat this third piece of peanut butter pie” (“whatever”).\n\nBut I shouldn’t be surprised that I’m “out of it.” As the years go by, fewer and fewer of my co-workers share any of my reference points. I remember once making a remark about Shirley Booth to a co-worker, and he said, “Who’s Shirley Booth?”\n\n“Who’s Shirley Booth?” Remember Hazel? Come Back, Little Sheba? Don’t get me wrong, Shirley Booth has never dominated my thoughts, but who could imagine a person never even hearing of Shirley Booth? That’s like not hearing of Carol Channing, or Ethel Merman, or Mitzi Gaynor, even. What kind of a world are these people living in if they haven’t heard of Shirley Booth?\n\nIf you think that’s bad, I was talking to my office mate Lisa one day, and for some reason I mentioned Fred MacMurray. She said, “Who’s Fred MacMurray?”\n\nGet out of here! you say. True story. She wasn’t kidding, either. She had never heard of Fred MacMurray. Which led me to the startling conclusion that Lisa had never seen Fred MacMurray’s TV show My Three Sons. Which led me to the even more startling conclusion that maybe a lot of people hadn’t seen My Three Sons or even heard of My Three Sons. No Steve. No Chip. No Ernie. No Uncle Charlie. No nothing. It’s impossible for me to fathom that some people have never seen those cartoon feet tapping as the saxophone played the opening My Three Sons theme. Then again, I wouldn’t know a star of Westworld if I fell over one.\n\nA lot of people sure don’t go around singing the theme to Goldfinger to themselves, either, as I’ve done for thirty years. I still walk around singing, “Go-o-o-ldfinger ... he’s the man, the man with the Midas touch.” And then I add my own lyric: “His touch is too much!” (That’s another phrase we always used, too much.) That’s some old stuff, that 1964 Goldfinger, Oddjob and James Bond stuff, but I continue to think about it.\n\nFor nearly as long, the theme to the TV show Secret Agent has been running through my head, as sung by Johnny Rivers: “There’s a man who leads a life of danger/...With every move he makes/Another chance he takes/Odds are he won’t live to see tomorrow.” But there are some who have never heard Johnny Rivers sing “Secret Agent Man,” or, if they have, think it’s no big deal. And I don’t know what to say to that, either.\n\nI sing old TV commercial jingles to myself, jingles unheard since the ‘60s. “Only Mustang makes it happen/Only Mustang makes life great/Only Mustang/Only Mustang/Mustang, Mustang, ‘68.” And “Ford, it’s the going thing/It’s what’s happening.” And “Meet the Swinger, Polaroid Swinger.” And “Happiness is the taste of Kent/ Happiness is the taste of Kent/ Happiness is the taste of Kent/Great taste, fine tobacco/That’s what happiness is.” Some days these jingles are all that go through my head.\n\nI still say “sock it to me, baby.” I still ask my buddies, “How’s it hangin’?” I still sing “Seventy-seven Sunset Strip,” then snap my fingers twice. I still think “Here comes da judge” when I see courtroom scenes on TV. And it goes on and on.\n\nIt’s tough to be a mature person these days.\n\n[--] May/June 2018\n\nMan of Nature\n\nI was working at the computer here in the office the other day when the boss’s friend Conway poked his head in to say hello. Later, when we were talking on the phone, Conway told me the sight of me at the computer disconcerted him. “You just didn’t look right there,” he said. “I’ve always considered you a man of nature.”\n\nI thought about it a moment and decide he was right. I am a “man of nature.” Though I do enjoy watching TV and being inside I’m just as happy to be outside, near nature. A lot of your outdoorsy types make their big noise about camping and canoeing and all that stuff, but I’m outside every single day, taking vigorous walks, humping like 90 over the streets of my neighborhood. While they’re gabbing on the phone about nature I’m out there in it, rain or sleet or snow, being a genuine organism. While they’re busy shopping for their down sleeping bags and fancy bug-proof tents, I’m out there with all the animals!\n\nI’ve talked before about how I get along with the dogs and squirrels and ducks and geese and rabbits I encounter on my walks. They don’t run when they see me coming because they know I’m simpatico with them, a Daniel Boone type with the added plus that I’ve got plenty of food at home so I won’t be coming after them with a bow-and-arrow and a skinning knife as Boone might have. They knew Boone was a natural kind of guy but would get hungry once in a while and chase them. I’m not saying these particular animals knew Daniel Boone, but their ancestors did, so they’ve got a built-in warning system on these matters. In other words, they see me and think of Daniel Boone in a positive sense. Like, “Here comes that Daniel Boone type, but he’s already had dinner and listening to his radio, so we can keep sitting here.”\n\nI suppose you’re going to say that these aren’t “tough” animals, that I’m making a big deal about being a natural guy with poodles and little birds, let’s see how he’d do with real animals, like cougars or sharks. Now, I’m not going to sit here and lie to you and tell you I’ve wrestled alligators. I haven’t. I’ll even admit I’m a little afraid of horses. They’re too tall, and once when I tried to mount one I couldn’t get my leg up over him. I was only seven but this inability to mount the horse has haunted me through the years. I’ve always had trouble swinging my leg over things like barriers in parking lots, and it’s hard for me to imagine that today I’d be able to put one foot in the stirrup, swing the other leg over, and be on the horse. My fear is that the horse will stampede as I’m hugging his side trying to mount him and I’ll be off, holding on for dear life while women of the horsey set laugh at me. I’m not saying this is the dominant fear in my life, but it has kept me off horses.\n\nI hardly think this problem with horses disqualifies me as a man of nature, however. For every horse I haven’t been able to mount there’s a goat who will lick my hand and pucker at me. I’ve mentioned before I fed a goat out of my hand and he didn’t even scrape his teeth on my palm. This goat then looked up at me, and it appeared he was about to pucker his lips. He didn’t, but I’m sure he felt he could have with me. The point is, animals recognize in me a natural attitude and have accepted me into their world.\n\nThere’s more to nature than animals, obviously. There’s air and the environment. On my walks I use all my senses: my sight, my ears and my nose. I’m particularly adept at smelling things. I pass by one house, for example, and always get a strong whiff of cologne. Now what does this mean. Either the people inside the house use way too much cologne or they pour it on their tree lawn, from where the odor seems to emanate. Not that I stand there and sniff their tree lawn, but it is a temporary nasal mystery. I can also smell dryer air cranked out from basement laundry rooms and by the odor identify what kind of fabric softener sheet is being used. I’m like an Indian brave on the trail with my olfactory powers and I can sense danger in my feet, too.\n\nYou add these up and if you don’t get “man of nature” then I don’t know what.\n\n[--] March/April 2018\n\nSecret of Children\n\nI have discovered the secret of children. Jokes, they like jokes. They like screwing around. They like fun, candy, toys. I know this to be true, both through observation and memory. I was formerly a child.\n\nAs a grown-up, I’ve always been a little afraid of children. “Afraid they’d beat you up,” you ask? Of course not! I’ve got 100-120 pounds on most I know. I can easily handle a good 98 percent of any tot you’d care to throw at me.\n\nMy fear was that I’d break them. As I don’t personally have children, any experience I have is, naturally, with other people’s kids. What if I was horsing around with a child and something broke? “Thanks for breaking our child,” the parents would say, their voices dripping with sarcasm. I feel guilty enough about other stuff without that hanging over me.\n\nBut, as is the case with cats, I’ve found there’s no need to handle children as if they were delicate china. Where I was once afraid to touch them, I now feel free to pat them on their heads or, if I know them fairly well, even tickle them. I lift them up, toss a ball around, or apply a noogie if so desired. I’ve discovered you can roughhouse with kids and they don’t mind at all. It brings back memories of my own childhood, when my older brothers would hold me down and mash their smelly socks in my face for a fabled “Gasareeno.” I loved to wrestle around on the floor with my idolized brothers, though admittedly the Gasareeno portion of this business wasn’t a complete delight.\n\nI don’t recoil and raise my arms out of the way, as I used to, when kids climb up on my lap or next to me. Some kids like affection and I can supply it as long as it’s reasonable. I’m certainly not going to go around hugging every child in sight. When I was little I didn’t like hug-happy adults coming up and squeezing me. If you’re my mom, you can do that, otherwise, hands off the material, was my attitude. Familiarity breeds contempt. If a child signals that he or she would like to be hugged, I’ll hug. There’s no sense going hog-wild, however.\n\nAnother aspect of children I feared was that they could see right through me. You hear about the ageless wisdom of children, and how they have infallible bullshit detectors. Who wants to deal with that? I contain tons of bullshit – layer upon layer of it – and I certainly don’t want some wisenheimer kid to call me on it. I’m not that fond of embarrassing questions, either. Recently, the six-year-old daughter of a friend asked me if I had kids. “No-o-o,” I said, sensing a trap.\n\n“Why not?” she asked. I went into a long, unconvincing exposition about why we didn’t have children, ending with a faux-jovial, “Besides, there’s no guarantee we’d have kids as nice as you.” This was sincere, but what I really wanted to say was, “None of your beeswax.” She just said “hmph” after all this, which might be interpreted as “You’re full of shit,” but could have just as easily meant she hadn’t listened to a word. I decided to believe the latter.\n\nI now feel that, even if they could – a big “if” – most kids don’t care enough about your bullshit to see through it.\n\nThey have bigger fish to fry. What, after you leave the room, they remark to their little friends, “Well, he was a bit of a poseur, don’t you think?” It’s idiotic.\n\nNo, jokes are your key. The grosser and dumber the better. Poop jokes, throw-up jokes. Work up an extensive catalog of these and you’ll be aces with the small fry.\n\n[6-12-96] January/February 2018\n\nTacos and Aging\n\nI am distressed by the signs of aging I am exhibiting. My eyes have gone way south. I am one of the few people I know who has to wear glasses over contact lenses. There is no contact lens strong enough to correct my right eye. Maybe NASA could come up with something, but I doubt it.\n\nWhen I’m not wearing my contact lenses or Coke-bottle glasses, I only see blurs of color. Once when I didn’t have my lenses in I mistook a white plastic grocery bag for the cat Dizzy. “Dizzy, come here,” I said and smacked my lips. But she didn’t move. When I went over to try to pet her, I expected her to coyly trot away as she usually does, but she didn’t because it wasn’t her. I had to be right on top of the bag before I realized this. I petted it anyway, just to save face.\n\nI also have pains in the worst places. Old guy stuff, in those regions that receive little to no daylight. I’ve tried to maintain some savoir faire about this, but how can you have a cosmopolitan attitude and insouciance about rectal complaints? You can’t put a cast on it, like a broken arm. It’s not a good conversation piece at parties. Nobody mistakes you for Denzel Washington or Tom Cruise when you’re talking about your rectum. There are rectal anecdotes in Modern Maturity, not Spin or Details.\n\nYou ask, “What about the hair growing in the ears and nostrils?” Absolutely. The nostril hair has to be trimmed once a week, not to mention the eyebrows, which seem to be going crazy too. I not only have tufts growing out of my ear holes, but single hairs growing directly out of my ear lobes, which my wife Barbara tries to pluck while she’s driving. “Stop it!” I say, squirming in the passenger seat. \"\n\n“You can’t let that stay there,” she says. She doesn’t want to live with some stooped-over old carpet salesman whose last good year was 1957. That’s what ear hair’s all about.\n\nMy behavior is old guy behavior too. I have to have things just so. I get upset at bedtime if I don’t maintain my ritual of peeling off my shirt and shorts, opening the bedroom door, tossing them into the bedroom, quickly closing the bedroom door so the cat Dizzy won’t run in, and making sure to face the bathroom at all times while performing this function. If I have my back to the bathroom it doesn’t feel right. I have to be situated correctly and make all the proper movements so I can then enter the bathroom to smoke my three ciggies and freely perform my toilette.\n\nBefore I go to bed, I’m also compelled to check the chains on the front and back doors by tugging down on the chain when it’s in its slot, pop the side of the slot with my index finger several times to check its security, tug at the chain again, then turn the knob repeatedly for good measure. Barbara says sneeringly, “Make sure the doors are locked.” I also check my alarm clock every night, pressing the “Time Alarm” button at least ten times to ensure it’s set at 7 am. In Poland they make realistic and depressing art films about stuff like this.\n\nFood is becoming way too important to me. When I was younger I never could understand older people making such a big deal about food. Now all I think about is food and where I’m going to eat. On Saturdays nights I like to go out to dinner at the finest restaurants, which to me is the height of glamour. I eat steak and drink booze, like Frank Sinatra, and indulge myself in sentimental martini talk. Barbara hates this, calling the Saturday restaurant thing “this obsession you have.”\n\nBut even normal everyday food is affected by aging. The cocktail taco fiasco is a good example. For years I have been searching for frozen cocktail mini-tacos, a special treat of my childhood. As a full-grown man with my healthy appetite I could eat literally dozens of these cocktail tacos, and would certainly like to. But I can’t find them anymore.\n\nDuring a recent trip to the grocery store Barbara spotted a TV dinner in the freezer case that featured mini-tacos. When I saw the box, my heart leapt. At long last, here were my babies! But this was some kiddie dinner, with five lousy tacos. Five cocktail tacos is nothing. Five cocktail tacos is a complete joke to a full-grown man. And the corn niblets, brownie and cheese dipping sauce – pure kid stuff – that accompanied them were taking up critical space that should have been used for twenty more tacos. It was heartbreaking.\n\nThe hippo in the sombrero on the package seemed to mock me: Up yours, man. These are children’s tacos!\n\n[9-14-94] November/December 2017\n\nSecrets of Swinging Singles\n\nAn article in the Plain Dealer about the difficulties of being single in a family town like Cleveland made me think back to my own single days and the problems I had in meeting women.\n\n“The sex machine had problems meeting women?” you ask in surprise. Yes. In my twenties and early thirties I wasn’t at the level of sophistication I am now. In those days I would go to bars by myself and sit and stare grimly at my beers. This is not exactly catnip to women. On occasion I would laboriously turn in my barstool and drunkenly squint at the women in the place, hoping to catch someone’s eye. I never did.\n\nIf only I knew then what I know now.\n\nIf only I knew then that all people, men and women, respond to personality. Looks aren’t all that important if you have personality. I should have taken the hint when the only time I seemed to be successful with women was when I would say things to them like “I’m not wearing any underwear.”\n\nI was raised to be a gentleman, so I was loath to say things like “I’m not wearing any underwear” too often, but really, it all depends on how you say it. I said it brightly: “I’m not wearing any underwear!” When you say it this way you’re not some leering, phlegm-hawking creep; you’re a happy guy who wants to share good news. You’ve worked in your sexual subtext, too; you’ve mentioned “underwear.” The word “underwear” gets people excited because, you know, we’re talking about scanties and undies and such. That’s sex talk. That’s the height of titillation.\n\nIn those morose single days I didn’t know these things. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, I continued to think silence and smoldering looks were the way to go. Maybe that would work for hot studs like Erik Estrada or Randolph Mantooth (this was the ‘70s), but not for me. When people mistake your smoldering looks for gas or a psychotic episode, you’re not getting anywhere.\n\nAnother thing I now realize is that I underestimated the power of dancing in this business. I seemed to do all right on those rare occasions when I overcame my fear of humiliating myself on the dance floor and went out there and “shook my booty” or “let my backbone slip” or what have you. I don’t really know why dancing is sexually exciting to some people, but I have my theories. One is that you’re hopping around and that gets different juices flowing from when you’re sitting in a chair. “Are these sexual juices?” you ask. Maybe. That’s for me to know and you to find out.\n\nAnother theory is that the beat of the music tends to give you “ideas.” I’m not saying you can’t get “ideas” while sitting in a chair, but the thunka-thunka-thunka puts you far more in mind of sex than sitting around watching TV or reading the real estate section of the newspaper. Anyway, that’s the power of dancing, and if I were you, I’d get over any anxieties about looking like a geek or falling down on the dance floor because that’s where the action is.\n\nYou say, “Beyond dancing, what are good methods to meet people, so I don’t spend my autumn years alone in a poorly lit room with a tin of sardines, cracker packets I stole from a cafeteria, an unworking fire detector, and at the mercy of the state? Not that I’m desperate or have a glum view of the future.”\n\nWell, if I were “in the market” today, I’d turn on the aforementioned personality—but plenty. If I went to a public place today with the aim of meeting someone, I’d stand against a wall and grin and whistle and snap my fingers. I’d move my feet around and periodically dip. You know when women would begin approaching me? In about two seconds. Here is how it would go:\n\nWomen: Hey, you look like you’re having a good time.\n\nMe (dipping and grinning): I’m havin’ a decent time, ladies, and how you doin’?\n\nWomen: What’s your name, anyway?\n\nMe (pulling out a referee’s whistle and blowing it): Foul! You ladies want me to tell you my name before I get to hear yours. That’s a five-yard penalty.\n\nWomen: I’m Tabitha and this is Brittainy. You’ve got a million dollar personality, you know that?\n\nIt’s good I’m not out there in the singles scene today. Talk about having an unfair advantage.\n\n[] July/August 2017\n\nHoney Reston’s Pet Panorama\n\nSyndicated in over two publications\n\nHoney:\n\nOur cat, a Siamese named Gail, is ten years old and doesn’t do much anymore. How can we liven her up and make her more fun? - S.Z.\n\nSiamese are unique among cats in that they love to model fashions. Gail would adore a little bonnet and rear high heels, available at all Junior Miss departments in your favorite clothing store. (Look for the smallest size.) Dress her up and watch the fun begin for both you and Gail!\n\nHoney:\n\nMy goldfish are decent pets, I guess, but I feel so passive watching them. I wish I were more involved with them. Any way I could be? - L.W.\n\nCertainly! Ever “dance” with a fish? You can! Just grab one of your little friends by both fins – gently now! – and twitch him around to your favorite music. He’ll love it – so will you!\n\nHoney:\n\nMy daughter’s guinea pig is a squealer. Though I love Mel dearly, his constant racket gets on my nerves. Is there any way to quiet him down? - F.W.\n\nWhen you put your children to bed, do you ever read to them? If so, you know how relaxing it is. Read the fat little spitfire a nice story and watch him settle down. And don’t feel foolish sitting in front of a small cage reading to a guinea pig – more than one U.S. President has done the same thing, believe me!\n\nHoney:\n\nMy canary, Chirpy, is a real songbird – except when I run the vacuum cleaner. Then I don’t hear a thing. Should I be concerned? - S.J.\n\nNo. Chirpy is still singing, but you can’t hear because the vacuum cleaner is drowning out his little tune. Buy a tiny microphone and rig it up in front of Chirpy to amplify him as you clean. You’ll have a regular Jim Nabors on your hands!\n\nHoney:\n\nHow do you housebreak a rhesus monkey? Didi is our pride and joy, but there’s no controlling her when “nature” calls. Any hints from our favorite pet columnist? - R.R.\n\nWhen it comes to rhesus monkeys, you have to catch them in the “act.” As Didi messes, simply pour a mixture of baking soda and water over her. She’ll get the idea – no monkey likes having a mixture of baking soda and water poured over it. And neither would you!\n\nHoney:\n\nOur house is infested with roaches. We’ve tried to get rid of them with no luck, and we figure we may as well quit fighting it and take them in as pets. How do we go about domesticating them? D.K.\n\nEasy! Roaches are a joy to watch when you gather them under the “Big Top,” a roach circus! Just herd them into a little corral and put a clear plastic dome over it. Have the kids fashion little top hats and put them on the roaches’ heads. Slip little red noses on some others and “send in the clowns!” Takes coordination, but it’s well worth it!\n\nHoney:\n\nOur collie, Elmo, is a big fan of Chinese food. Is that unusual among collies? - R.S.\n\nIt’s no “occident” that collies love Chinese cookery; by last count, there were 17,000 of them in Peking alone!\n\nHoney:\n\nWe live in Florida and recently bought a used dolphin. I used to watch the TV show Flipper and thought dolphins grinned and chattered and swam backwards. But this fellow just kind of sneers and floats and keeps his mouth shut. Is this normal? -W.A.\n\nSounds like your dolphin isn’t “used” for nothing! A good many of these mammals are ill-tempered and sullen, and the previous owner unloaded one of these lemons on you. Better luck next time!\n\nHoney:\n\nI bought my son a little backpack to strap onto his turtle a few weeks ago, and the turtle loves it – it’s really got a spring in its step now! Now my son is asking what we should put in the backpack. What do turtles need to carry around, anyway? A.A.\n\nYou forgot to mention if it was a little boy turtle or a little girl turtle. Boy turtles like to carry penknives and string and things of this nature, while girls like to carry cosmetics. Turtle backpacks: an idea that’s time has come, and an idea, by the way, that I’ve been championing for years.\n\n[3-29-95] May/June 2017\n\nFilm Festival Losers\n\nSome of the films that didn’t make this year’s International Film Festival:\n\nThe Sheep (Russia; Vladimir Koussetvsky, director): A tale of a simple village shepherd whose flock’s interior monologues constitute the bulk of the film’s 239-minute running time. The camera follows the animals as they walk through a meadow, focusing on each individual sheep’s overdubbed thoughts about life, the new Russia, and their harsh criticism of the shepherd, a symbol of Russia’s current leadership (“Where is he leading us? Does even he know? I think not.”) Said one film festival judge: “After you listen to about four sheep, the novelty wears off very, very quickly.” Commented another: “If you’re gonna have sheep think out loud, you gotta make ‘em sound peppier than this.”\n\nServing Dish (Sweden; Ola Brugman, director): Brugman frames the momentous events of Sweden’s Vasa Dynasty (1521-1654) by showing the meticulous hand painting of a huge serving dish, done by a family through several generations. We watch the highly detailed work done by this family of artisans, interrupted on occasion by neighbors rushing into the family’s home, relating news about various wars with Denmark and Poland. A judge said that “watching someone paint a dish for two hours is death,” and “during those long, long stretches when there was no news, just dish painting, I really wanted to cry.”\n\nDisappearances (United States; Ronny Fulmer, director) Feature-length animated film employing trick photography: first you see an object, then you don’t. “Fulmer takes a shot of a box, stops the film, moves the box out of the picture, continues filming and we’re supposed to think it disappeared. Then he does it with pop cans, shoes, waste baskets and other stuff,” said a judge. “It’s absolutely pathetic.”\n\nBingo, The Bravest Dog in the Whole World (United States; 1958; Andy Warhol, director) An early film by Warhol, starring the very young Lou Reed as a boy whose life is totally wrapped up in his dog Bingo. An extremely conventional drama\n\ncentering on Reed breaking his ankle in the woods, with Bingo ultimately dragging him to safety and into the arms of his widowed father (Allen Ginsberg), the film was so ridiculed by Warhol’s friends and associates he isolated himself in his apartment for six months. A codicil to Warhol’s will dictated that the film not be shown in public until 200 years after his death. A judge said, “This is Warhol’s dirty little secret. If this thing ever got out...”\n\nRamona (Australia; Susan Lockland, director) Documentary about a woman who believes she is the anointed messenger of intergalactic creatures and delivers her message of peace to embarrassed onlookers at Sydney and Melbourne city parks. “You sit through 100 minutes of this woman’s incomprehensible babbling and then at the end she says she’s just kidding around,” said a judge. “No, no, no.”\n\nThe Brady Bunch Goes To Sex Hell (United States; the artist formerly known as Henry Hole, director) Sexual deconstruction of American icons the Brady Bunch, wherein the female members of the family wear masks representing their male counterpart, and vice versa: Carol wears a Mike mask; Greg wears a Cindy mask, and so on. The family then takes an automobile trip to “Sex Hell,” a fictional town in Indiana where their masks are torn off and they’re beaten to death by rodent people. “You’d think this would be good,” said a judge. “But it wasn’t.”\n\nFestival! (Brazil; Juan Leon, director) Director Leon brings us the festivals and carnivals of Rio, focusing on the common people, their colorful costumes, and the exuberant music of Brazil. Using a handheld camera, Leon strives for immediacy in conveying the fun and color of this special time. “Would someone tell Leon that he can’t dance and film at the same time?” complained a judge. “I thought I was gonna throw up.”\n\nLights of the World (Great Britain; Beatrice and Graham Mobley, directors): Documentary on the various shapes of light bulbs the world over. “The Mobleys put together quite an impressive collection of light bulbs,” remarked a judge. “Unfortunately, who gives a rat’s ass?”\n\n[10-11-95]January 2007, April 2017\n\nThe Old Grocery Guy\n\nMy wife Barbara and I were standing by the celery at our local supermarket when an elderly gentleman rolled his cart up to us.\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” he said to me. “Do you allow your daughter here to accept candy from strangers?”\n\nHe then handed Barbara a piece of hard candy, which she looked at in confusion.\n\n“You get one too,” he said, and gave me a piece. I thanked him, and the old man said, “Did you hear about the Amish hooker? She had 10 men a night. Oh, I’m sorry, that’s terrible,” and he walked away.\n\nI popped the candy in my mouth and Barbara gave me hers, evidently fearing that this could be the gift of an escaped sociopath from a home for the criminally insane attempting to murder strangers with poisoned candy. I ate her piece as well because, sociopath or no, I was hongry. (They were good, too, little butterscotch affairs, and save for a minor bout of diarrhea later I suffered no ill effects.)\n\nThis old fellow really inspired me. A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants. The incident made me completely rethink my thoughts about the kind of elderly guy I could be.\n\nI’d always assumed I’d be a miserable old fart, sullen and withdrawn, snarling at small children. Get away from there. If you break that your parents will pay for it in full, I promise you. But it doesn’t have to be that way. I could be creative and put all this negative energy I have to work making people happy, going up to them and telling them jokes in questionable taste. The man in the supermarket proved it can be done!\n\nWhat I do have to remember is that I can’t do this now. It’s one thing to have a lovable, Gramps-looking gentleman with a cane in his shopping cart approach you and offer you candy and a dirty joke; it’s totally different if it’s a middle-aged stocky goateed guy. Then we’re talking possible arrest and jail time. But there’s nothing wrong in planning for the future.\n\nAll right, I’m 79 years old and I’m in the supermarket. I’ve got a few items in my cart: bran, Beano, rubber tips for my cane, Depends, whatever. By that time my evil-looking goatee would be long gone, and so would the rest of my hair for that matter. I’ll have a bushy white mustache and be wearing eyeglasses. Think Wilford Brimley with a larger snout.\n\nAnd instead of that dyspeptic look I always figured I’d have, I’ll be smiling and have a twinkle in my eye. I’ll have to work on the smile and the twinkle because as of now, it cannot be done. I’ve tried to twinkle at myself in the mirror, but all that happens is my eyes tear up. Barbara tells me I need to smile more, but when I try, she says, “Never mind.” It doesn’t matter, I can certainly master this crap over the next 30 years.\n\nAll right, say you’re a young married couple. You’re in the supermarket, standing by the margarine, inspecting a tub of Fleishmann’s. Suddenly you feel the bony finger of an old man tapping you on the shoulder. That bony finger is me!\n\n“Excuse me,” I say. “Is this margarine party by invitation only?”\n\n“What?” you say.\n\n“I brought the drinks,” I say, handing each person a little bottle of airline vodka. Hard candy might have been OK for the guy we ran into, but I like to splurge. “Here’s looking up your old address,” I say, draining my bottle of vodka. “Say, did you hear the one about the hooker who only liked a certain kind of margarine? It was the high-priced spread. Oh, that’s bad, I’m sorry.” I’ll smile and twinkle at you, then roll my cart away.\n\nMan, this is going to be great. The hell with waiting. Why should old folks have all the fun?\n\n[10-11-95] January/February 2017\n\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy\n\nOn a recent PBS documentary, Rock & Roll, punker Johnny Rotten sneered, “Anyone can be nice.”\n\nThis was like a cold slap in my face. I’ve spent most of my life trying to be nice. If not nice, agreeable. I agree with everyone, all the time. Where has it gotten me? Am I rich? No. Am I famous, like Johnny Rotten? No. I’m the leading citizen of Agreeable Land, the place where nothing happens. Where I get pushed around. Where I don’t make any cash.\n\nWell, I’m done being nice and agreeable. From now on I’m going to be a dirty bastard.\n\nI’ve started being one already, as we speak. Here at the newspaper, my office mate, Lisa, takes sticks of my Beemans gum out of my top desk drawer, gum I paid for. Guess what? She ain’t gonna do that no more. I’ve hidden my Beemans. Yeah! She wants gum she can go over to the drug store like I do and buy it herself. The next time Lisa asks me for gum, I’ll point out the window towards the store and say, “You go on over there, woman. I ain’t supplying you with free gum no more.” I’m letting the grammar go, too, by the way. From now on I’m talking like a biker. I’m gonna put “at” at the end of every question. Like, “Where’s that review at?” or “Where’s my fine-point pen at?” Using superfluous prepositions shows you are ready, willing and able to stomp some booty.\n\nI used to go around this office chatting up my co-workers. Old Mr. Conviviality, spreading his sunshine. Well, I just signed a card for Tom, a sales executive here who’s celebrating his thirtieth birthday, by writing, “In your thirties life becomes progressively more difficult.” Is that “convivial” enough for you? Is Tom gonna have a “nice” day after reading this? No. But this is the message of one tough hombre who won’t be trifled with. I ain’t no simpering daffodil who writes “Happy Birthday! Good luck!” on every card that’s handed to me. I’m a rotten nasty sonofabitch and nobody’s sweetheart!\n\nI’ll tell you what else. Up to now, when publicity people called me on the phone to pitch their events for the listings, I’ve been a pushover. “Sure, send it along,” I’d mewl. “We’ll take a look at it.” The next time I get a call from someone trying to do this, I’m gonna say, “You got a fine chance of getting that crap in here.”\n\nIf they complain about this treatment, I’ll taunt them: “Come on, crybaby! Sell it to me!” Only the strong survive in this world. You go toe-to-toe with me, you snap ‘em back at me, and I’ll reward you with a listing. This is how the big ones – the listings legends – operate. And it’s got nothing to do with being “nice.”\n\nThe same goes for my other management and executive duties. For example, I always line my own wastebasket. Does Donald Trump line his own wastebasket? No way. Leona Helmsley doesn’t take time off from screaming at some chambermaid in one of her hotels to line her wastebasket. Guess who just stopped lining his wastebasket? You got it. From now on, I’m just filling it up au naturel. This is a statement. And the statement isn’t “This is the wastebasket of a nice guy.” It’s “This is the wastebasket of a big-time executive with a massive personality who didn’t get where he is today by worrying about lining wastebaskets and other niceties.”\n\nYou don’t get remembered for being nice. How many gravestones do you see engraved with the words “He/She was nice”? When I’m gone, people are gonna remember me. I’m the guy who hid the gum, was pessimistic on greeting cards, and challenged listings. My grave will say, “Here lies a real scumbag.” And I’ll own the cemetery it’s in.\n\nJust now I went over to the sales executive Casey and gave him the finger and he gave me one right back. Well, no one said this was gonna be easy.\n\n[10-28-92] September/October 2016\n\nMy Congressional Campaign Speech\n\nI know it’s a little late, but I’ve decided to run for the congressional seat in my district. I don’t know which district it is exactly, but one of my first acts as your congressman will be to find out. And I won’t rest until I do – you can depend on that.\n\nThe reason I’ve decided to run is many-faceted. The first facet is that I care about people. As a congressman I will stand up for my constituents. No corporate or special interests will dictate to me how I’ll vote on the issues. Gifts? Perks? Junkets? Special privileges? Sure, I’ll take them. But when it gets down and dirty on that congressional floor, I’ll do the right thing for the people I represent. That’s a promise – from me . . . to you. (Here I’ll point at audience, my other hand placed on my thrust-out hip – my campaign trademark.)\n\nThe second facet is that I want to help people I care about. What good is caring if you don’t help those whom you care about? I’m going to help my constituents; just see if I don’t. If I don’t, you’ll know the reason why! I won’t hide under my desk or behind the sofa or take a quick trip to another state. I’ll be there if you want to complain, or whine, or give me a hard time. I’ll be there for you. If the line’s busy, just keep trying. If I’m not there, I’ll be there later. Just leave a message. I’ll get back to you. Count on it. (Pointing again.)\n\nThirdly, and perhaps most importantly, is I want to be an instrument for change. Change is a hard thing. It involves risk. It involves daring. It involves turning old notions on their heads and trying new ideas.\n\nThat won’t be necessary with me. I can implement change without all that risk stuff. How? With people. That’s right. With you! With my constituents. You’ve had enough of us in the Congress telling you what’s what, and what’s best for you. What we need are congresspersons who listen to their constituents; I mean really listen. This is what I plan to do. I’m going to perk up my ears, put them to the rail, and wait for that train that’s the voice of the people to come rolling into the station. When it pulls in, my head will be on that rail, listening. So . . . all aboard . . . for improved service in your congressional district! All aboard for change! Woo, woo! (Here pantomiming pulling a train whistle.)\n\nBut what are my programs? What are my plans to improve health care, produce jobs in the private and public sector, stimulate growth, and relieve the gridlock in Washington that prevents so many fine plans from being implemented?\n\nI have a Four-Point Plan – a Five-Point Plan, if you count private and public sector job production as two separate things, because there are two different sectors, but originally I thought of it as one big thing: job production. But they wouldn’t give them different names if they weren’t different things, correct? The way I see it is, public sector jobs are like jobs in government agencies, and private sector jobs are say, jobs in art galleries. You can rest assured one of my priorities as your congressman will be to find out the difference between the two, and let you know as soon as I do. Promise. (Point, hip thrust.)\n\nAt any rate, Four-Point or Five-Point, take your pick. I don’t have time to get into specifics, but let me just say that each point – whether it be the First or Second or Third or Fourth (or Fifth, depending on which program you prefer) – will be given equal attention by me and my staff. We’re not going to spend months on the First point and then, because we run out of time, not get to the Second or Third. That’s not the way I’m going to do things. Why? Because that’s not the way you do things. You don’t run your household that way. If you did, you’d be out of a job. The least your congressman can do is budget his time and delegate his responsibilities so his points can be implemented, the way you do at your home and business. Who says we congresspersons can’t learn anything from our constituents? (Laughing warmly here.)\n\nPlease consider voting for me on November 8. Because, really, a vote for me is a vote for yourself. And I think yourself is a pretty good person to run this district. (Nodding sagely as I walk off stage to thunderous applause.)\n\n[] July/August 2016\n\nLife With a Dog\n\nI believe I’ve fallen in love with a dog. We were at Petsmart the other day, and I met a dog there with whom I connected immediately. He was squat and built very close to the ground, but when he looked up at me, his big eyes said, “You the man.” I haven’t had a similar feeling with an animal since that goat in 1993.\n\nI petted his head and he liked it, clicking his tongue against his gums. As we left the store, he looked at me as if to say, “I thought we had an arrangement.” We didn’t, of course; he was on a leash, he was obviously someone else’s dog; but I felt bad nonetheless.\n\nI’ve never personally owned a dog. The last dog we had in our family was during the Kennedy administration. We did have two dogs in the ’50s: Jimmy, who was run over, and Happy, who had fits. The Kennedy administration dog, Spook, liked to bite young people and was asked to leave.\n\nMy siblings have only had a few dogs after they moved out of town. My brother’s dog, Eddie, was haughty with me when my brother wasn’t around, and had two puppies named Gary and Steve. My sister’s dog, Shaker, crashed through closed basement windows. And during my formative years all my friends’ dogs either barely tolerated or completely ignored me, and one looked at me as if she would just as soon have me for hors d’oeuvres. So I’ve never felt a great desire to have a dog.\n\nYet this dog at Petsmart ... he was a good-looking fellow. A dog you could live with. He had stubby legs so he couldn’t run away from you. (I don’t really know if it was a male or not. Plus I’m one of those people who ask dog owners, “What’s his name?” and when they reply, “It’s a she,” I always say, “Well, he’s a handsome brute.”) He wasn’t one of those nervous little yappers who pee on you if you try to pick them up. He was a good, solid, compact dog.\n\nI thought about a life with a dog. My wife Barbara loves all animals – this past weekend she felt so guilty about a squirrel dropping his nut after she honked at him that she wanted to find him and give it back – and would get along easily with Stubby. (That’s the name I’ve given him.) Maybe as she drove us in the car Stubby could sit on my lap in the passenger seat, and we could both put our heads out the window. As a gag I could look one way out the car window and Stubby the other. The comedy potential of this is unlimited.\n\nI’d take good care of Stubby. I’d feed him, water him, and take him on walks. Would you believe I’ve only walked a dog once? It was an awkward affair. The leash constantly got between the dog’s legs and she’d look back at me in irritation. Keep the leash above my heinie. Is that such a big deal? I’d perfect my leash technique, becoming so masterful at it Stubby wouldn’t even know it was there.\n\nI could roll balls for him, and he could run and bring them back. That’s the boy, Stubby! Bring that booger on over here, Stubb Man! Way to be, Stuberoo! He could serve as companion and protector, too. Anyone who got funny with me would have Stubby to contend with, and their ankles would be at serious risk. He’d nip you and bark and raise all kinds of hell. You’d be well advised not to mess with me while the dog Stubby is in attendance.\n\nHowever, I envision Stubby being more of a fireplace dog, lying peacefully on a rug in front of the hearth and making those tongue-against-the-gum sounds I’ve grown so accustomed to. I’d puff on my pipe and talk to him. “You’re a good boy, arent you?” That’s how people talk to dogs – they ask them rhetorical questions. “You’re man’s best friend, am I right?” I take a back seat to no one at asking animals rhetorical questions. And afterwards, as a reward, I’d give him a snout rub and perhaps the odd kibble or two.\n\nYes, I would enjoy finding Stubby and taking him home. However, the cat Dizzy is certainly the joker in that particular deck.\n\n[December, 15, 1999] May/June 2016\n\nWhat Sign Is Your Pet?\n\nTaurus (April 20-May 20)\n\nDogs: Just deliver a trace of urine on that little sweater they’re trying to squeeze you into — you won’t have to wear it long ... That matting on your coat isn’t anything to worry about, so stop gnawing at it! Cats: The clawing-the-couch bit is getting old fast; better knock it off or there’ll be a trip to the vet soon — and it won’t be for a “minor” nail trim.\n\nGemini (May 21-June 21)\n\nDogs: You don’t have to “express yourself” every time a stranger passes in front of the house. You’re getting on everybody’s nerves. ... And don’t fret about the new collar; it’s for your own good. Remember? You almost scratched yourself raw. Cats: Easy on the catnip this week. Your people are beginning to think you might have an issue. ... Just what is it you’re trying to get at behind that wall?\n\nCancer (June 22-July 22)\n\nDogs: You’re going to get a haircut this week, and you are not going to like it. But keep it to yourself ... You’re going to find a nice week-old meatball in the corner of the kitchen. Help yourself. Cats: The new kitten is a threat only if you let it be one. Unlax yourself ... The new scratching post is there for a reason. Use it.\n\nLeo (July 23-August 22)\n\nDogs: Hate to break it to you, but it’s bath time! ... I know you think the Frisbee thing is stupid, but humor the guy. It’s as much exercise for him as it is for you. Cats: I see a balled-up pack of Salem Lights in your future. Have at it ... Listen, those people paid $65 for that cat condo. Just sit in it for a minute or so every day and you’ll score some serious Brownie points. Guinea pigs: The watchword is “quiet” this week.\n\nVirgo (August 23-September 22)\n\nDogs: They took the L.L. Bean bed out to be cleaned, not permanently, so don’t panic ... Expect a barrage of Liv-a-Snaps this week, then a sudden drop-off. Cats: Your people will have a guest this week who won’t appreciate your attention, so steer clear unless you want to get swatted off the sofa ... And quit sniffing that spot on the carpet, there’s nothing there.\n\nLibra (September 23-October 23)\n\nDogs: Big white bowl in bathroom is toilet, not water dish. Get it straight ... I see a nice, fat chewy pig’s ear in your future. Cats: You can’t groom yourself too much this week; put that tongue in overdrive ... You’ll get Pounce treats up the wazoo this week. Hamsters: Take it easy on the wheel this week. You’ll run yourself ragged.\n\nScorpio (October 24-November 21)\n\nDogs: Stop showing all that love to your people’s thighs. You’re beginning to make ’em nervous ... Cats: Your new friend is going to be sharing your litter box, so “patience” is the watchword this week. Don’t spray the walls, it’s counterproductive ... And stop spitting out those antibiotics!\n\nSagittarius (November 22-December 21)\n\nDogs: Keep away from that squirrel carcass you see on your walk this week. Bad medicine... You will smell a nice butt this week, very nice — but don’t let it go to your head. Cats: Tough hairball week.\n\nCapricorn (December 22-January 19)\n\nDogs: Chew up that couch any more than you have already and you’ll be living in a world of hurt ... Your people are taking you on your first hunting trip this week. You won’t have a clue as to what’s going on, so just fake it. Cats: Bringing that dying sparrow into the house isn’t going to win you any style points. To the contrary ... Remember: Aim down into the box!\n\nAquarius (January 20-February 18)\n\nDogs: That porcupine you’ve been seeing can be a real “prick,” so steer clear ... There’ll be a lot of foolish talk about you “licking down there,” but don’t worry about it — they’re just jealous. Cats: You’ll find a dynamite new sleeping spot in the front closet this week ... Vomiting on the new Oriental rug may cause unpleasant ramifications this week.\n\nPisces (February 19-March 20)\n\nDogs: Whining gets you nowhere this week. Take that back: It gets you locked in the basement ... You finally find your rawhide bone, but where you’d least expect to. Cats: A switch from Nine Lives to Cat Chow may cause some momentary concern, but don’t take it personally: It’s the odor issue.\n\nAries (March 21-April 19)\n\nDogs: This could be the week for a chewy, meaty treat, so it’ll pay you handsomely to be on your best behavior ... There’s a pricey new knick-knack on the coffee table, so watch the tail. Cats: A shiny new litter box is on the way; get ready! Also a nice empty cardboard box. Everybody: Careful where you lick this week, there’s something going around.\n\n[Jan. 12, 2000] March/April 2016\n\nInterview with Millennium Marty\n\nEarly this month we noticed an odd looking fellow in the office. He had thick glasses, long stringy hair and a wildly growing beard, and was wearing jeans, a checked 1972-vintage polyester jacket and a filthy derby hat. He didn’t smell too good.\n\nHe was taking out a classified ad to call attention to his self-published book Hark! The New Age Calleth! Prophecies on Humanity’s Course in the Next Thousand Years. He signed his check “Millennium Marty.”\n\nWe asked Millennium Marty if we could interview him about what he foresaw for society in the coming millennium. He was all too eager to cooperate.\n\nEB: What are your credentials to act as a prophet, or seer, if you will, for the millennium?\n\nMillennium Marty: I have been deep in study regarding this subject all of my life, and in all my previous lives, as slave and master, man, woman, child, wildflower, rhinoceros and fish. I have taken internal trips through the use of all-natural herbal and vegetable hallucinogens, as well as extensive use of dental-strength Novocain, to attain my current exalted state of vision.\n\nEB: Are things going to be OK in the next millennium?\n\nMM: “OK” hardly describes it. We will find heaven on earth within this century. Yes, that soon! Utopia is well within our grasp. We will soon experience great revolutions in nature, thought and culture. These revolutions will be so profoundly impactful that our current way of life will be looked back on as Dark Ages. We will reflect ruefully back upon ourselves as a confederation of chuckleheads. Chuckleheads! (Bangs the table with his fist.)\n\nEB: What kind of revolutions are we talking about here?\n\nMM: I have irrefutable evidence that our water supply, thanks to an unusual planetary alignment, is being naturally fortified with certain minerals that will change the physiological and genetic make-up of human beings worldwide. These minerals, which I call “Mighty Mins,” will send disease packing. Off to Toledo with you, disease! People will have good health and an unprecedented sense of well-being. There will be no more wars waged and all debts will be forgiven, personal and national. Men will be able to ejaculate superhuman distances, up to 75 yards. You may start to see the beginning of this process by 2020.\n\nEB: What kind of evidence do you have of this?\n\nMM: I have scientific papers in my apartment, kept in a strongbox secured by a Master lock to which only I have the combination. For $10 I will mimeograph a set of these paper for your examination.\n\nEB: What other changes do you foresee?\n\nMM: I see a great easing of personal restrictions. There will be unfettered nudity throughout the land. There will be massive pavilions created to smoke herb.\n\nEB: Are you saying there will be pavilions filled with nude persons smoking marijuana?\n\nMM: That is precisely what I’m saying. Also underwater colonies.\n\nEB: Underwater colonies? Where?\n\nMM: You may be surprised at my answer. Lake Erie. Yes. Another benefit of Mighty Mins is that they genetically alter the brain for the better. Cleveland engineers, thus fortified, will soon be able to build an underwater city. It will be situated somewhere between Cleveland and Detroit. And there will be nude herbal pavilions down there as well.\n\nEB: What other restrictions do you see being eased?\n\nMM: People will no longer be slaves to artificial grooming products. Take deodorant, for example. I used to be addicted to deodorant. Oh yes. Mitchum, Sure, Arrid Extra Dry, Ban, Right Guard – you name it, I used it. I was deodorant’s bitch. I threw my last Speed Stick out the window three years ago. Deodorant is the Great Inhibitor! Death to deodorant! (Bangs the table.)\n\nEB: So you foresee nothing bad happening at all in the next thousand years?\n\nMM: There will be a minor squirrel revolt late in the 22nd century, but that’s about it.\n\nEB: Do you have any parting words for our readers?\n\nMM: I would tell your readers to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. If they desire to spoon some Tang into it, that is fine. Tang should not unduly affect the Mighty Mins.\n\n[Feb. 7-13, 1985] January/February 2016\n\nSingle Men's Household Hints: Readers write in with single-guy problems\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nI was watching TV the other day and had consumed eleven or twelve beers. The beer I was working on was sitting on the armrest of my lounger and somehow it fell off. I was kind of tired so I just watched the beer soak into the carpet. What do I do now? - Al, Brunswick\n\nDear Al:\n\nNot much, I guess. If you had sprung into action immediately – and who the hell really does that – you could have poured cold water onto the soiled carpet and rubbed it in with your foot. That might’ve helped, I don’t know.\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nHow do I get the grout out between the tiles in my shower? - Bill, Rocky River\n\nDear Bill:\n\nI don’t know – spray it and rub it with something, I guess. What is grout, anyway?\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nBoy do I hate winter! It’s so cold and the car won’t start, etc. Sometimes the heat won’t work in my apartment, either. Anyway, my question is, how do I get the salt stains off my shoes after I come in from Old Man Winter? - Toby, Cleveland Heights\n\nDear Toby:\n\nI heard that if you rub your shoes with vinegar the stains come off. I’m not sure what you rub it with, like a cloth, or a sponge maybe? By the way, next time you write, get to the point, will you? And change that name of yours, it’s stupid.\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nWhen I got ready to turn on my dishwasher the other day, I discovered I was out of dishwashing machine detergent. So I poured dishwashing liquid in the little hole in the thing. Then the dishwasher after a while started whirring, then going “chuffa chuffa” and bubbles came pouring out and water all over. What now? - Hobart, Willoughby\n\nDear Hobart:\n\nIs that Hobart Einstein, or Hobart Oppenheimer? What do you mean, “what now?” You clean up the mess and don’t do it again, that’s “what now.” Read the directions on things, for crying out loud.\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nHow do I get a vinegar smell off my shoes? - Rex, Cleveland Heights\n\nDear Rex:\n\nDab them lightly with Lysol and throw them in the dryer. It may work. I doubt it. What happened, you spill salad dressing on them?\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nI’ve got a dog, and he sheds like crazy. There are dog hairs all over my furniture. What’s the best way to get these hairs off the furniture? - Dave, Shaker Heights\n\nDear Dave:\n\nBoy, I’m not sure. Rub the furniture with a wet Kleenex, maybe that will pick them up. Or you might swipe the furniture with your hairbrush in a counterclockwise motion, though I don’t see how that would work.\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nIs it really necessary to separate whites from colors when doing laundry? To me it seems like a big bother. I’m an attorney, and I simply don’t have time. - Gil, Lakewood\n\nDear Gil:\n\nWell, big shot, if you’re an attorney, you can afford to send your laundry out or have your mama do it. The problem with not separating whites from colors in doing laundry is getting bleach all over the colored articles. Or don’t you use bleach, either? Don’t waste the readers’ time, these fellows have real problems.\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nI’ve invited my fiancé and her parents to my apartment for dinner. I’m having salad, spaghetti with meat sauce, a vegetable and some wine. My question is what kind of wine should I serve, and what kind of vegetable. - Dan, North Olmsted\n\nDear Dan:\n\nSince spaghetti is pasta, either a red or a white wine will be fine, though you might want to serve your future father-in-law a little whisky aperitif. As for the vegetable, I haven’t the slightest idea. Corn?\n\nDear SMHH:\n\nMy girlfriend gave me a big plant for my birthday, and I don’t know how to take care of it. How do you take care of plants? - Harry, Cleveland\n\nDear Harry:\n\nPlants need plenty of water, so water it two or three times a day. Spray it and rub it with something to keep it clean. Beyond that, nothing.\n\n[6-21-90] November/December 2015\n\nClear the Area, Please\n\nDuring my vigorous, healthful post-dinner walks I see many things that disturb, outrage, and yes, sicken me. If you see a paradox there I'm not surprised. You probably think the streets should be cleared of all people and animals when a sensitive type like myself chooses to take a vigorous walk so that I can receive the full benefits of the exercise without being annoyed or irritated. But I realize nothing's perfect in this world, and that other people have rights too, even though they shouldn't be outside at the same time I am.\n\nI don't think it's too much to ask, however, that people stay inside their homes between the hours of 7 and 8 p.m., especially if they own dogs which continually bother me on my walks with their barking and spinning around and other threatening behavior. They sniff my feet as I pass by while their owners hold their leashes and pretend to try to pull them off. Dogs love me because my feet look like little animals to them, no matter what kind of shoes I wear. They think that a pair of chipmunks is headed toward them as I approach. They believe they're going to sniff, shake, bite and pee on my feet when I reach their area. But they better think again. I'm not easy, and I'm not about to stop and let them have their way with me because they find me attractive and my feet possibly digestible. This ain't ancient Rome.\n\nNot only that, but some dogs seem to find me a highly stimulating sight and go out of their way to stare at me no matter what they're doing. If you can take graphic material, I'll describe to you what happened just the other day. I was walking on the sidewalk and this dog on the median strip across the street was squatting on the grass, having a b.m. (I'm sorry. Maybe you better send the children out of the room for this one.) Anyway, he was doing this with a big stick in his mouth, and he was staring at me as I walked. His eyes followed me as I proceeded down the street. Maybe I was some kind of visual laxative to him. We continued to look at each other as I walked away from him, thinking that in all my life this was the dumbest-looking thing I'd ever seen. Finally I just turned away in contempt with the thought, \"You go ahead and do what you want. You must be a source of great pride to your owner.\" Then I realized his owner was standing right there and probably did that sort of thing himself, and the dog was merely imitating him. Believe me, it was no pleasure considering this possibility as I continued on my walk.\n\nPeople, too. There are lots of weirdies out there. I see some of them on my walk and they're walking too, but power-walking, which means they pump their arms as they go. They grin and have a big time of it, strutting like stray majorettes on the road company of The Music Man. Sure, I could tell them to stop it, but since when have people changed their behavior so as not to offend me? Since never. It's tragic.\n\nAt least the power-walkers don't interrupt my aerobicizing. Sometimes people in cars slow down and ask me directions. Then I have to stop, and all the work I've done on my heart rate goes down the toilet. Get this. One woman stopped me right as my heart was surging toward the perfect tempo and asked for street directions. I tried to be helpful. Then she started arguing with me, saying that wasn't the best way! I thought I'd heard it all, but this took the cake. We argued for a while as my heart rate petered out to its usual unhealthy sitting around level and my blood pressure went through the roof.\n\nI realize that it sounds like my walks are filled with outrages directed against me personally, but often I see things that are just plain odd, like the child I saw smiling and waving at me from between the front and screen doors of her house. She was standing in the space between these doors, and both of them were closed. I had to question in my mind the thickness of a child who could fit in five inches of space between two closed doors. And her mom was in the front yard, standing back on the lawn looking speculatively at something on the house. I felt like saying to the woman, \"You better pay less attention to the gutters there and more to your child, who seems to be flat.\" I didn't though. The child was happy mushed in there. I'm the one who felt strange, but I walked on in silence.Yes, plenty of things bother me as I try to stay in shape by taking my vigorous walks, but I go on despite them. Call it courage.\n\n[--] September/October 2015Wild Kingdom\n\nI don’t feel right about meeting up with certain animals. For example, I’m not afraid of rabbits, but if they don’t appear to be afraid of me, then something’s wrong. I was walking down busy Lee Road a couple of weeks ago, and there, sitting on a tree lawn between South Woodland and Parkland, was a brown rabbit. As I approached he continued to sit calmly, and when I got to within five yards of him and he still didn’t move, I began to get nervous.\n\nThis rabbit had no fear of me; he’d obviously been toughened by Lee Road, the street that does not forgive. What if he didn’t know he was supposed to be meek and timid, I thought with growing apprehension, what if all he saw was some large pink thing invading his turf and he came at me, rabid and slobbering? After a rabbit attack you’re supposed to take the animal to the doctor with you so both of you can be checked out. As I began to worry about the rabbit in the box on the way to the doctor’s office, grunting and scratching and foaming, the actual bunny hopped into the bushes.\n\nThat’s not all, however. Not far from where I saw the crazy rabbit I had a run-in with some ducks and geese at the duck pond near the corner of Lee and Parkland. As it happened I was sitting at the edge of the pond, wearing only my running shorts and shoes. It was a hot day, so my T-shirt was off.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw a gang of ducks and geese heading toward me. They weren’t moving too fast on their webbed feet, but plenty fast enough. They stopped a few yards away, ostensibly to pull grass, but they were giving me furtive glances. When I would look openly at them, they’d put their heads down real quick and pretend to eat. But I knew what they really wanted. They wanted a clean shot at my nipples.\n\nI don’t know if you’ve ever had a duck or a goose latch onto one or both of your nipples, but believe me, it’s no day at the beach. They don’t gently place a downy wing across your breast like in some boring poem you studied in high school. They clamp their beaks right down on the nipple, and I mean hard. They’re stuck as fast to you as a pit bull or one of those hospital hemostats we used to use as roach clips in college. They focus on the nipple and nothing short of a grenade can blast them off.\n\nFortunately for me – and I should add for them, too – the ducks and geese decided I wasn’t worth the risk. They turned and waddled off. But my heart was in my throat for those nipple-threatening moments, moments I can’t ever forget.\n\nI won’t soon forget my raccoon-checking days, either, as a garbageman at the Cleveland Metroparks. I used to travel with a crew at the Metroparks’ picnic areas, and we’d toss the big drums of garbage into the bed of our truck. But first we’d have to do some raccoon-checking. Often raccoons would climb into the garbage barrels to forage for scraps. Sometimes they couldn’t get out. This enraged them as you might imagine. So every morning we’d peek into the barrels to see if a raccoon was seething inside.\n\nOne July morning I casually looked in the can, as I had countless times before, uneventfully. But this time a raccoon was staring up at me, his eyes brimming with hate. He was lying in a dark jumble of half-eaten buns, paper and foil. I jumped back, then tipped the barrel over so he could crawl out. He did, but looked back at me as if to memorize my face. This was his implied threat, anyway. I watched him run his sorry ass back into the woods. He didn’t scare me as much as surprise me. Raccoons with their little heads don’t scare me like ducks can with their cruel beaks or bills or what-have-you.\n\nTo prove that animals don’t affect me adversely, as might be concluded, let me end this essay with a joke I thought up on the spot concerning some ants. We here at the office were sitting around the lunch table eating popcorn, and a piece fell on the floor. Within a few minutes a horde of ants rushed out from their home behind the wall and overwhelmed the piece of popcorn. So I said, “They went out for the kernel (Colonel)!”\n\nEveryone laughed at this excellent animal joke, a joke that could only have been made by a person who knows animals and isn’t afraid of most of them. .\n\n[11-29-84] July/August 2015Euro-nuclear Geopolitical Rock: Taking the fun out of dumb music\n\n© G.W. Raresheid\n\nI’m beginning to see the light. For years I thought rock ‘n’ roll was about bumping, grinding, drinking beer, shouting, finger-pops, Elvis, teenage girls, cars, sex.\n\nI was wrong. According to many rock critics at Rolling Stone and The Village Voice, it’s about oppression. Poverty. Fascism. Political commitment. You know: stuff teenagers like to think about.\n\nI’d like to take a whack at writing rock criticism, using a fictional band for my audition review.\n\nThe Files’ debut album, Fangers, is the beginning of a new music I suspect will matter in the coming years: minimalist agitpop. These guys make the Talking Heads look like a Cool Whip dessert: artificial, disingenuous, ultimately meaningless. Where the Walpurgisnacht of the Heads ends in chic posturing, the Files’ concerns cut much deeper. This is a cry of pain from the hinterland of sexual politics.\n\nThe title cut, taken from the black argot of the word “finger,” is a stunning indictment of pervasive white power, kissed off so effectively in Michael Jackson’s “Beat It.” But where Jackson’s monomania negates much of the impact of his cry of pain, “Fangers” goes all the way, to total commitment. The lyrics, if you can take them, convey a heartbreaking helplessness: “The lives we lead/in broken-down dreams/ keep nagging our sexual congress/ pervasive in screams.” This, incredibly, from a white band.\n\nDeath and sex commingle startingly in many of these songs, propelled by a backbeat not heard since the day of the old Chicago R&B master Fats Pelligan. In the third cut of side one, an almost-symphonic effect is achieved with xylophones and cow bells. These guys have balls. The song, “List Me on the List,” is a rave-up on the most unlikely subject of love/death, territory heretofore unexplored by the boho establishment. The drummer (Paddy Hertz, formerly of Wee Wee on the Indians) produces a wrenching solo that tells us more about El Salvador than a thousand articles in the New Republic.\n\nOn the last cut of side one, a thirteen-minute tone poem cum ballad decrying American policy in the Middle East, guitarist Egil Faye’s (formerly Glazia Sondheim of Roach Murders) lyrics cuts so deeply the pain is almost unbearable: “Refugee/ Locked/ Shattered/ Shocked beyond the ladders of the world/ Plying the trade/ In the world he never made/ the world he never made.” Danny Partridge’s bass riffs add an unrelentingly ominous bottom that threatens to undercut the rock ‘n’ roll business itself. It’s almost the death knell of American music fascism, contained in less than fifteen minutes of wax.\n\nIf side one is powerful, side two is a utilitarian textbook on musical terrorism, punishing the listener, and ultimately acting as a catharsis for his sins. In the first cut, “Lick It Down,” by deliberately reversing the dialectic that makes us all so much cannon fodder for the nuclear age, the band pulls us into its obligatory annihilation nightmare. Ironically using the beginning rhythm-guitar riffs of Wilbert Harrison’s “Kansas City,” the Files state categorically that Hell, No, They Won’t Go. “Lick It Down” is as uncompromising a call to arms as Little Eva’s “The Locomotion,” and as terrifyingly felt.\n\nNow the Files make their most numbing statement, the six minutes of complete silence that is the second cut, entitled “The Second Coming.” This is rock’s most shattering moment, and most daring. As you wait for something – anything – to happen, a single sound, the cumulative effect is staggering. You’re so jarred out of your complacency, you’re almost angry at the band for doing this, committing this mental diaspora. Most people are going to lift the needle and jump right over this cut, which is a shame, for this is the most telling and important song on the album, the legitimate heir to “Gimme Shelter.”\n\nAfter the experience of the “The Second Coming,” there’s a sense of physical drain that the band exploits by screaming at the top of their lungs at the beginning of the next tune, “Andrea and Me.” Lead guitarist Walter Lippman Jr.’s lyrics display the band’s all-pervasive hegemony of spirit that indicates that these guys are survivors.\n\nIt’s a lovely ballad, a post-nuclear love song that uses a love-as-wounding-concept peg that nearly throws off the preceding despair. But not quite. The last song on the album, “Pee Shoes,” is a disturbing pre-funk fallout disco satire that closes the Files, so to speak. The lyrics, by harpsichordist/triangle player Pete Wheat (late of Puking) are demonstrably intense: “Absolute peculiar buttons/ Buttons of war/ Feeding devil dogs/ Satan’s dogs of war” followed by small hiccups of agony in the refrain. You can dance to this, folks, but be careful: there’s more here than meets the eye.\n\nA lot of people aren’t going to like this music. It’s too damn uncomfortable, too damn far ahead of its time. But if you care anything about rock ‘n’ roll – if you care anything about life itself – the Files will have to be an essential part of your days and nights. It’s artificial respiration for your head.\n\n[6-28-95] May/June 2015Is The Cat Dizzy Crazy?\n\nI think the cat Dizzy is mentally ill.\n\nI’ve been reading the Globe Mini Mag How to Talk to Your Cat, which I picked up for 99 cents at the checkout counter at Heinen’s. Some of the stuff in the book I don’t buy, like the author’s brother teaching his cats “to go potty on the bathroom toilet. ... Now if he could train his cats to FLUSH the toilet after each use, we’d have a truly purrfect situation!”\n\nI’ve always believed the litter box to be an excellent facility for a cat, and I certainly like the fact that I have my own toilet. If you took the author’s logic to its furthest extreme, dog owners would end up going to the bathroom on tree lawns. No, I think animals and people should have exclusive – and separate – toilet facilities.\n\nRegardless, there are many interesting points in the book to consider. In the section “Mental Health,” the author asks “Why does a previously pleasant pet suddenly turn into the devil cat from hell?” This is the core of the problem with Dizzy.\n\nFor example, during her morning rubdown Dizzy is at first extremely pleasant. However, after a few minutes she begins to get cranky, then bitterly resentful, and then openly enraged. She gets what the book terms “aggressive ears ... indicated by a slight rotation. The ears look like the wings of an airplane, ready for flight.” Once those ears rotate you know she’s ready to commit violence. But why would anyone rotate their ears like airplane wings while they’re getting a massage or a rubdown? She’s the one that wanted the rubdown in the first place! No one’s putting a gun to her head! It doesn’t make sense.\n\nOne possible answer the book proposes is that the cat may have a medical condition, but Dizzy is healthy as an ox. She saunters around the apartment like royalty, eats the finest in chow, and sleeps like a baby. So it’s not that. Another explanation involves territory and dominance. If a new pet or household member is introduced, it may trigger offensive behavior in the cat.\n\nWe certainly haven’t introduced a new household member or pet, but I’m wondering if Dizzy is so crazy she’s perpetually honked off by even brief, temporary additions to our home, like my niece Jane E. Frazier, who on occasion comes to visit and, shrieking, chases Dizzy around the living room. What if she’s enraged by inanimate additions, like, say, a new bookshelf, or groceries? What if when she sees a can of bean soup or box of Ritz crackers, she’s thinking, “There ain’t room enough here for the both of us”? And punishes us later for bringing these things into her home?\n\nAnother factor the book doesn’t bring up – and which I hope is not involved – is that she may be irritated by my personifying her, which I’ve done for years with cats. By this I mean I ascribe human characteristics to her in a variety of situations, and often these characteristics aren’t flattering. When I say stuff in her voice – which I imagine to be a squeaking Brooklynese, similar to Bugs Bunny – I make her out to be fairly stupid and shallow.\n\nFor instance, when I’m watching a movie on TV, I say in her voice, “I don’t care for this picture, this ain’t a wholesome picture. There’s no cats in this picture. I wanna see a picture with cats in it.” When I do this, I glance over at her and she’s usually giving me a dirty look. She also gives me dirty looks when I’m cussing in her voice, as in “Giddadahere, yuh doity bastard. Shuddup and gimme sometin’ to eat, yuh prick yuh. I hate yer guts, yuh lousy schmuck” etc., etc.\n\nI don’t know why I imagine Dizzy talks like a Bowery Boy or Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, but maybe I shouldn’t go on this way around her (which, I should admit, I do all the time). She might be very sensitive. Her behavior might be her way of telling us, “Don’t put me down. Don’t make me out to be a fool, ‘cause I’ll tear you up. I’ll kill you.”\n\nAh, I’ll bet she’s just mentally ill.\n\n[?] March/April 2015Relaxing It Big Time\n\n© Mark Stivers\n\nI had a revelation coming back to the office after my vacation. You know how you feel relaxed after time off and things don’t worry you or get under your skin as they normally do? Well, I like this feeling so much I’m going to be this way the rest of my life. I’m giving up the anxiety, man. I’m giving up the stress. From here on in I’m unlaxing myself big time.\n\nAt the office, I’m going to stop worrying about every little thing. Life’s too short. The stuff I think about on the job – stories coming in, proofreading, writing, doing listings, getting photographs – I’m going to let those things take care of themselves. Why the hell be so linear all the time? The best stories tell themselves. They’ll find their way into the paper if they’re important enough. Same with photos. If we don’t get a photo, we’ll just have restful white space in that spot. There’s nothing wrong with white space. Or we can throw in funny drawings of dogs and cats. Dogs and cats may have nothing to do with a story, but dogs and cats exist, right? So they have a right to be there, with the story. This is what I mean by not being so linear.\n\nAs for listings, I’m going to do them once and not update them week to week anymore. I’ve got all these files on my desk with information about concerts, museums, dance and theater. It’s a drag. My life is measured out in file folders. With my new non-linear listings strategy, if Jesus Christ Superstar is opening at the theater on April 1, as far as I’m concerned it’s there forever. If people go to the theater expecting to see Jesus Christ Superstar and Plaza Suite is there instead and they experience anger with that, the problem is in their heads, okay? I’m not dealing with it. I’m just going to let events happen and stop trying to control everything.\n\nI’m not going to be so compulsive about writing, either. Hey man, I’m not going to worry about punctuation. From now on if it feels good do it. If a comma looks pretty, after a certain word, that’s where I’m going to put it. I’m going to toss words up in the air and fly them like kites, and when they float down to earth people can make their own sense of them. By the same token I’m not going to be so concerned about “mistakes” getting in the paper. Who’s to say what’s “misspelled”? Who’s to say that Cleveland’s mayor isn’t still Joe Biden, or that Tom Brady doesn’t play for the Browns, or that the body of water out there isn’t Lake Erie at all but the Caspian Sea? Facts supply their own reality. I’m tired of being a fact fascist.\n\nIt’ll be like an endless vacation at work. I’ll put my feet up, drink vodka out of my water bottle, and call everyone “Ace” or “Champ.” As in, “I’m on it, Ace.” “You got it, Champ.” I’ll be the Charlie Sheen of the office. If people complain about it? “You tell ‘em, Champ.” When the boss asks me to do something, I’ll just laugh. “Hey, that’s a good one! I’ll get right on that, Ace.” Then I’ll just slide on home, drunk.\n\nThe way I figure it, the worst that could happen if I do this is that I get fired. And the worst that could happen after that is that I don’t find another job. Then I could move back in with my mom. They call this “the Baby Boomerang.” I’ve already floated the idea by her and she said, “Oh, that’d be great.” She was clearly excited about it. So that’s all arranged, too, if need be. And I could help her around the house, you know, by drinking out of her glasses and sitting on chairs and stuff.\n\nWell, gotta go. Got a few of my famous eternal listings to tap in, and then an Amstel Light to pound. The Big Relax has begun.\n\n[2-10-99] January/February 2015Ask Dr. Valentine: He'll bring you right down!\n\n© Mark Stivers\n\nAsk Dr. Valentine: He’ll bring you right down!\n\nGood day. My name is Dr. Arne Valentine, freelance psychologist, and I have been asked by this publication to give to its readers advice on the matters of love and romance, befitting the impending Valentine’s Day holiday.\n\nThough I consider Valentine’s Day to be a rather manufactured and artificial event, one cannot fail to acknowledge its sustained popularity. The editors, too, thought my unusual name would supply added appeal, a “hook,” if you will. I found this all rather ludicrous but not the money I am being paid for my efforts. Therefore, I hope you will receive some benefit from my observations.\n\nI have a co-worker at my office who I’m head-over-heels in love with, and I’m pretty sure he feels the same way about me. I’d like to make a major statement this Valentine’s Day to let him know that “all systems are "
