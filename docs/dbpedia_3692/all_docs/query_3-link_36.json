        "text": "Tweet\n\nSumo\n\nTweet\n\nPalmetto Bay leaders are concerned about safety\n\nWho in their right mind would put the words “Munilla” and “bridge” in the same sentence only six years after the pedestrian bridge at Florida International University collapsed, killing six on Tamiami Trail and providing a lifetime of PTSD to hundreds if not thousands of Miami commuters?\n\nSomeone at the Miami-Dade County decided that Magnum Construction Management, which used to be Munilla Construction Management — they changed the name to rebrand after the collapse, but saved money on letterhead by keeping the same initials, MCM — was best suited to build the road that is really a bridge over the C-100 canal connecting Southwest 163rd Terrace to 164th Street.\n\nThe Palmetto Bay council has opposed the bridge from the get go. The Village sued to stop construction and has called for an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the new developments, which could include a recent court ruling in their favor.\n\n“Dear Palmetto Bay residents, your urgent action is needed,” Mayor Karyn Cunningham wrote in a mass text Monday. “On Friday, we learned that the 87th Avenue bridge contract has been awarded to the company responsible for the FIU pedestrian bridge collapse that claimed six innocent lives.\n\n“This is a direct threat to the safety of our families and our community,” Cunningham wrote. “As your mayor, I’m fighting to stop this dangerous project. But I need your voice to amplify my demand to our county mayor to stand with us and terminate this dangerous project now.”\n\nThe Village also received the news recently that the Third District Court of Deal has granted the Village’s motion to hear oral arguments in the lawsuit brought by the Village and a group of residents against the county.\n\n“As the Third District court does not automatically grant oral argument in each case that is filed in the court, granting the Village’s motion is significant,” said City Attorney John Dellagloria.\n\nCBS4 Miami reached out to Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, who has opposed the bridge since she was the District 8 commissioner, about these new developments.\n\n“My top priority is the safety of all our residents and neighborhoods,” La Alcaldesa told them. “I have opposed the construction of a bridge on 87th Avenue since I was a Commissioner in the District and worked hard to support and put in place different measures to address traffic congestion in the area. Some of these measures include the construction of traffic circles at key intersections, additional Bus Rapid Transit stations on US 1, and extending smart traffic lights on US 1.”\n\nThe construction of the bridge was approved by a majority of the county commissioners in 2021 and the county’s Department of Transportation and Public works began the process. But residents haven’t given up on stopping it. There was a recent protest at the bridge by a small group .\n\nLevine Cava said she had spoke to Cunningham and had requested an “immediate review” of the process that he could share with the council at Thursday’s meeting.\n\n“I have been in touch with Mayor Cunningham over the last few days and requested an immediate review of the contract process in response to concerns from Palmetto Bay residents. The Department will be prepared to share all the facts at the upcoming Council Meeting on Thursday.”\n\nMunilla Construction Management was one of the companies behind the deadly pedestrian bridge collapse. The president of the family owned company told WPLG Local 10 that he wrestled with what could have been done differently to prevent the tragedy.\n\nRead related: Miami-Dade’s Danielle Cohen Higgins rakes in PAC funds on non election year\n\n“We have had many restless nights,” Munilla is quoted as saying. “We wish we would have done more.”\n\nWell here’s an idea: Don’t do bridges. Not for a while. It’s too soon, dude. Magnum/Munilla is involved in other contracts, with water and sewer, at the airport. Be happy with that."
