        "text": "Costa Rica surf is some seriously epic stuff. From the party-mad surf town of Tamarindo to the remote Pacific breaks of Santa Teresa, there’s something special going on in this corner of Central America. We rate it as one of the very best countries for budding beginners because the surf-camp offering is so awesome. But it also covers the bases for improving intermediates and still has epic spots and gnarly barrels for advanced surf travelers.\n\nAn introduction to Costa Rica surfing\n\nAsk 100 surfers to name their top three surf destinations on the planet and it’s likely that Costa Rica will come up time and time again. Now firmly up there with Bali and Portugal among the world’s most revered wave hotspots, this big chunk of Latin America rarely fails to impress.\n\nThe reason for its prowess? Geography, of course. In fact, CR enjoys exposure on two coastlines: The Pacific and the Caribbean Sea. The first is the most famous for surf, but the latter can also shine when the stars align.\n\nThe Pacific side is a real playground for surfers. Different regions work with different seasons, though virtually all work to some degree, no matter if it’s July or December. That’s down to the prevailing easterly trade winds (consistently offshore) and the almost ceaseless SW swells that work their way up from New Zealand. Throw in a trace of NW Pacific swells down from Cali and a dotting of seasonal hurricanes, and you begin to get an idea of just how many waves are up for grabs in these parts.\n\nDon’t discount the Caribbean, either. Towns like Puerto Viejo de Talamanca there sit on the cusp of slabby barrels that are fueled by hurricane swells and the arrangement of coral reefs under the water. It can be pretty epic stuff out east.\n\nFinally, Costa Rica is a joy to explore even if you’re not surfing. On the forefront of eco tourism, it hosts reserves like Monteverde and the adventure mecca of Arenal. You’ll spend non-surf days hiking rainforests to find sloths, watching whales on the Osa Peninsula, and hiking up active volcanoes. So fricking cool.\n\nWe might use affiliate links in this post. Basically, you click em’ and we get a little something from your booking or purchase. They help us keep offering more and more in-depth surf guides to awesome places all around the globe. So, thanks for that!\n\nThis is just one part of our guide to surfing in Central America\n\nCosta Rica surf at a glance\n\nThe good:\n\nUber-consistent SW swells on the Pacific\n\nIt’s one of the world’s best intermediate playgrounds\n\nCosta Rica is SO relaxed\n\nThe bad:\n\nIt’s getting pricier every year\n\nLineups are getting bigger\n\nWhat will I find in this guide to Costa Rica surf?\n\nQuality and quantity – the hallmark of Costa Rica surf\n\nBut it’s not just quantity where Costa Rica really excels. There’s serious quality to the waves. Guanacaste Province harnesses that NW hits into A-frame peaks that turn to cruisy beach breaks for beginners in Tamarindo. Then there’s the Nicoya, which hosts still-remote surf towns like Santa Teresa along a stretch of shoreline that’s a true intermediate wonder – think beefy but forgiving sets of fat water that’s rippable and almost always glassy.\n\nThe surf on the Caribbean is a welcome change for many who are bruised and battered by the Pacific come December (it only works in December-March really). That’s not to say it’s easy. It ain’t. Coming off stray hurricane systems, the waves are punchy and fast, but a whole different beast than the western ocean. The Caribbean Costa Rica surf really focuses around one town: Puerto Viejo de Talamanca.\n\nHow to get to Costa Rica?\n\nMost people fly into either San Jose or Liberia (where there’s a new and growing airport). The first is better for reaching the Caribbean coast and the southern Pacific side of the country, including the likes of Nosara and Manuel Antonio. The latter is a better arrival point if you’ve got your heart set on surfing in the Nicoya Peninsula, which includes everywhere from Tamarindo down to Santa Teresa.\n\nWe use Kiwi to search for our flights, whether coming from the US or Europe. It lists all the major airlines and even lets you compare the prices for dates throughout a whole month at a glance. Pretty handy when airfare can be pricy to San Jose and the like.\n\nGetting around Costa Rica\n\nEveryone has a different opinion on how to get around Costa Rica when surfing. We say: It depends.\n\nIf you’re planning to do a surf camp then the chances are you don’t need to rent your own car. Usually, it’s just a case of transfering to the town where you camp is and settling in. Transport to and from the breaks will be included in the cost of your camp (if it’s not then it’s probably not a very good package).\n\nYou also probably won’t need your own car if you’ve got your heart set on just a single surf destination. Lots of people do it that way. They choose one town – Tamarindo, Nosara, Quepos, wherever – get there, book a hotel or surf lodge within walking distance of the beach, and don’t worry about doing much else.\n\nAll that said, there’s no doubt that a car hire in Costa Rica will take your surf trip to whole new heights of amazingness. You’ll have the freedom to cruise up and down the main regions in search of those empty beach breaks and hidden points that noone knows about. Plus, you won’t have to rely on buses and transfers, so can easily string together mini stays in multiple surf towns – Santa Teresa, Nosara, Tamarindo is a popular itinerary, for example.\n\nIf you do choose to rent a car, then it’s always a good idea to go with a 4X4. Roads are improving here but there are still long sections that are unpaved and the terrain can be difficult.\n\nWe always use RentalCars.com for hires here. We think they’re the cheapest and they tend to do decent cancellation policies. You can search below…\n\nThe top Costa Rica surf destinations\n\nIt can help to split up Costa Rica into individual regions. Each offers something a little different, with varying swell windows and wave types. Let’s take a look…\n\nGuanacaste\n\nGuanacaste is best known for Tamarindo, which is the most famous surf town in Cota Rica by a country mile. It’s home to a big beach break that works wonderfully for all levels, especially in the morning before the winds pick up.\n\nHowever, Guanacaste shouldn’t be judged on Tama alone. Head north and you can enter one of the remoter parts o the country, where the surf territory meets the borderlands with Nicaragua. It’s all largely undiscovered up there, mainly down to protected nature reserves. If you’re willing to travel and have money to burn, it’s the place for boat trips to hidden reef breaks where it should be just you an a few other intrepid surfers.\n\nTop surf spots in Guanacaste\n\nWitches Rock – a remote sandbar break at a rivermouth that’s a fast and zippy left and wonderfully hollow on high tides. Hard to get to because it’s at Playa Naranjo deep inside a national park Boat transfers and 4X4s are pretty much the only option.\n\nPlaya Negra – A mecca for quick right tubes. Fantastic at high tide, but better for experienced surfers.\n\nNosara (click for complete guide) – On the Nicoya Peninsula but still int he state of Guanacaste, Nosara is one of Costa Rica’s surf capitals. It’s got waves for all levels, going from reefy rights at Punta Guiones to more beginner breaks in sheltered coves.\n\nTamarindo (click for complete guide) – The surf town numero uno of Costa Rica, Tamarindo has access to the long stretch of punchy beach breaks along Playa Grande. It’s also packed with surf camps and has buzzing nightlife. We love it but it’s busy.\n\nNicoya Peninsula\n\nWe could wax lyrical about the surf on the Nicoya Peninsula from morning to night. For intermediates who want a chilled intro to Costa Rica surf, this is the the perfect place to come. It’s best known for waves like Santa Teresa and Mal Pais. They’re beefy, fat beach breaks that wedge up nicely and have some good kick in the main season. Rippable to the T, you’ll have fun here if you’re just about starting to turn and shift on the wave.\n\nTop surf spots on the Nicoya Peninsula\n\nSanta Teresa (click for complete guide) – Escape to Santa Teresa to find the more secluded breaks of the Nicoya Peninsular. There smaller line ups and it’s a real intermediate dream, with rippable Pacific swells that work virtually all year round.\n\nMal Pais – Just south of Santa Teresa, Mal Pais has access to similar breaks but has a more upper-intermediate edge thanks to the variety of reef breaks.\n\nMontezuma – Technically in Puntarenas Province (just like Santa Teresa), this chilled hippy town in the jungles is perfect for total beginners.\n\nPuntarenas\n\nPuntarenas is the first region of Costa Rica surf that solely relies on those SW Pacific swell channels. That’s no a bad thing, because they work virtually all year. It just means that there’s a noticeable uptick in the quality of the sets come June and July.\n\nThe town of Dominical is the main anchor of the surf coast here. It provides access to hidden beach stretches backed by jungles that have similarly rippable sets to Santa Teresa.\n\nTop surf spots in Puntarenas\n\nJaco – Get mid to high tide and you’ll find Jaco’s beach break churning out lovely lefts and rights that cater to a whole variety of levels. It’s not for nothing that this one has risen to become one of CR’s top surf destinations!\n\nDominical – An intermediate+ spot that’s got lush drop ins and reliable SW swells in the Pacific channel. Rewards those paddling into the offshore with clean-face A-frames. Usually quite busy.\n\nUvita – Uvita is best known for its whale watching but there’s surf too, much of it shared with the more surfy town of Dominical to the north. We say it’s a great destination for intermediates and beginners.\n\nPlaya Hermosa – Not to be confused with the chilled break of Playa Hermosa on the Nicoya Peninsula near Santa Teresa, this Puntarenas break is a heavy barrel that rocks up on high tides and holds to well overhead. Scary stuff for the pros.\n\nPlaya Esterillos – Come here to escape the crowds and get consistent swell all year round. It’s chilled, the vibes are good, and you can even be alone on the punchy beach breaks. Decent for all levels.\n\nGolfo Dulce\n\nGolfo Dulce pulls in those SW groundswells and turns them into something pretty darn special at Pavones. It’s among the best goofy waves in the country, with a sectiony left that cruises and barrels around three headlands at once. The rest of the region is actually better for rights. They tend to have a bit more pizzazz than other rights and break over sand and rock mixes. The downside is really the accessibility – Golfo Dulce is one of the remotest corners of Costa Rica.\n\nTop surf spots in Golfo Dulce\n\nPavones – A series of two points arranged in a sort of dog-leg pointing SW on the Golfo make up the legendary spot of Pavones. It’s an ultra-long left with rippable peaks and neat hollow sections. One of the best rides in Central America!\n\nCaribbean\n\nThe Caribbean side of Costa Rica surf scene is a whole load more particular. The beaches tend to be rocky and sheltered by out-at-sea reefs. That means you need to go beyond the breakwater to catch anything heavy. Out there, the coral gardens glimmer sometimes only feet below where you’ll be dropping in – it’s scratch-the-board territory extraordinaire. The waves are much more fickle, needing Colombian cold fronts or hurricanes (usually August)\n\nSurf camps in Costa Rica\n\nCosta Rica has shouldered its way into the mainstream of surf-camp destinations. It’s up there with Sri Lanka and Indo as arguably the best tropical spot to come for a planned surf trip. What’s really great is that the offering isn’t limited to beginners – as surf camps usually are. The variety of the waves around the Pacific coast here mean that there’s loads for intermediates and even advanced riders.\n\nThere are two clear hotspots for surf camps in Costa Rica. The first is Santa Teresa. The second is Tamarindo and surrounding towns (Nosara included). There’s oodles to get through, and we touch on the very best of the moment over in our guide to the best surf camps in Costa Rica for 2024/25.\n\nOur absaloute top favs would have to be:\n\nIguana Surf Tamarindo – A seriously good surf camp that offers 4x surf lessons across a 6-day stay in buzzing Tamarindo. All instructors are ISA-qualified and they even throw in transfers to and from Liberia Airport.\n\nZeneidas Garden – Live right on the beach, surf every day, feel the good vibes. Zeneidas Garden is a surf camp with a difference. Packages are heavy on the surf but also include extras like yoga and optional extras like pottery workshops, art workshops, and local adventures to waterfalls and the like. It’s genuinely great!\n\nLa Posada Hostel – Fun, fun, fun, La Posada is all about keeping surfing on the good vibes side of life. They’ve got a cracking 7-day package that includes five surf lessons and free use of the equipment for the whole stay, which is important because it means there’s virtually no limit to the amount you can surf on the beaches here.\n\nA note on why we partner with BookSurfCamps.com: Book Surf Camps are probably the biggest online aggregator of surf camps and surf-yoga packages in the world. We sounded out a quite a few potential partners before we affiliated with them. But, in the end, the abundance of choice for beginners, intermediates, and female-only surfing sealed it. We also love the simplicity of their booking system and the trusted brand name, along with the focus on connecting with homegrown local businesses on the ground.\n\nWant more Costa Rica surf camp options? Search the whole shebang below right now and book in a few clicks.\n\nThe best surf hotels in Costa Rica\n\nThere are more top surf hotels here than you can shake an endangered toucan at – but don’t do that, please! Most are located on the Pacific side, where the waves are more reliable. However, you can also catch a few over in the Caribbean. We’ve included both here…\n\nThe Green House, Santa Teresa – Adults Only ($-$$)\n\nOur top pick\n\nThe Green House, Santa Teresa, has a very special place in our hearts. Perched in the jungles above the uber-consistent beaches of Puntarenas, it’s part luxury hotel, part eco escape. The best units have Bali-style plunge pools overlooking the canopy where you can spot howler monkeys.\n\nMal Pais Surf Camp ($-$$)\n\nBest for: Intermediate surfers\n\nMal Pais Surf Camp offers a stay down at the far end of the wave-bashed Nicoya Peninsular (an intermediates heaven!). The rooms are simple but modern and have access to a private pool. Most importantly, the awesome waves of Carmen Beach are just a short walk away!\n\nPlaya Grande Surf Camp ($-$$)\n\nBest for: Partying and surfing\n\nThe Playa Grande Surf Camp is a top choice for hitting the popular waves of Tamarindo. Okay, so you won’t be alone on the break, but this is Costa Rica’s most lively surf town. The pad has its own colorful pool and tropical garden, along with fun palapa-style bungalows to stay in.\n\nLa Tica y la Gata ($$)\n\nBest for: Surfing the Caribbean\n\nLa Tica y la Gata is just a stone’s throw from Cocles Beach (the main surf spot in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca). It’s a pretty darn cool spot with sleek interiors done out in polished concrete and whatnot. It’s also pretty peaceful, with a pool and a sunning terrace in the private grounds. There’s also lots of space to stash the board.\n\nFor more inspiration on where to stay be sure to check out our in-depth guide to the very best surf hotels in Costa Rica. It’s got some SUMPTUOUS options that are lux right by world-class waves.\n\nTraveling on a shoestring? No worries. Our guide to the best surf hostels in Costa Rica has you covered on the budget front.\n\nStep-by-step guide to planning your Costa Rica surf trip right now\n\nStep one: Book flights to the Costa Rica surf…Lately, we like Omio for searching flights. It’s a nice interface and has lots of airline options. We also use Skyscanner because that sometimes offers deals that even beat going direct to the carrier!\n\nStep two: Book your surf camp Book Surf Camps is the numero uno online booking platform for fully-fledged surf-stay packages on the internet right now. Then there’s Booking.com. That has consistently unbeatable rates for hotels and a nifty map feature that lets you check EXACTLY how close your hotel is to a surf break.\n\nStep three: Get insuranceThis is kinda’ important. Not just for surf trips but for any trips. SafetyWing is great for nomad travelers. They offer rolling contracts that cover amateur surfing.\n\nStep four (optional): Rent a car If you’re surf camping then you might not need wheels. If you’re not then we’ll just say this: We’ve never been on a surf trip that wasn’t improved by having our own car. Use RentalCars – they’re the best.\n\nStep five: Enjoy!\n\nFor paying for stuff when you’re traveling – Get a Wise borderless card/account. They charge NOTHING for POS payments in any country and have some of the best FX rates around in our humble opinion.\n\nWhen to surf in Costa Rica?\n\nThe best time to surf in Costa Rica is the wet season that runs between May and November. That’s nothing to do with the rains, but rather to do with the oncoming SW swells. In fact, they’re the reason the whole Pacific coast here gets reliable sets of 4-foot+ and glassy conditions. Check it out…\n\nWet season/Green Season (May-November)\n\nThe peak surfing season in Costa Rica lasts throughout the so-called Green Season, from May until November. The SW Pacific groundswells turn on the goods about then, reaching all the way across from New Zealand to give quality conditions. They’re bolstered even more by the dominant easterly offshore winds (they usually only hit in the morning before switching to onshore – this is dawnie territory).\n\nMid-season can go pretty gnarly when the hurricane storms that brush Mexico and the Oaxaca coast can be felt along the north-west. They turn the otherwise beginner havens of Guanacaste into something more challenging for a brief day or two.\n\nThe Caribbean surf in Costa Rica tends to be much smaller in May through to November. You might get lucky and find a stray typhoon system hitting somewhere north-east of Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, which can bring storm swells. However, we’d say the Pacific coast is by far the best bet!\n\nDry season (December-March)\n\nYou’ll feel the SW channels that bless Guancaste and the Nicoya Peninsula with their endless sets of 5-10 footers slacken a little around November. They never shut off entirely, so don’t go thinking a Pacific surf trip in Costa Rica is a total no go. Things are just a little less reliable, but arguably better for beginners as the size of most sets dips somewhat.\n\nThe northernmost end of the Costa Rican Pacific coast can get some of the wintertime NW swells down from the northern Pacific. That helps add consistency throughout this season, meaning Tamarindo and north is a decent choice.\n\nMeanwhile, the unique flow-through of cold air from Colombia helps the Caribbean hit a high in December. It usually lasts until March, offering reliability to the reefs and fast shore-break tubes of Puerto Viejo de Talamanca.\n\nWhat to do when you aren’t surfing in Costa Rica\n\nCosta Rica is a wonderland of adventure. From smoking volcanic peaks to hidden Shangri-La national parks filled with howler monkeys, it’s the perfect place for an intrepid traveler, even when there’s not much surf happening (and that’s pretty rare too!).\n\nManuel Antonio National Park\n\nEvery first-time visitor to Costa Rica should consider hitting the wonderful Manuel Antonio National Park. It’s an eye-watering showcasing of the stunning biodiversity of the country, with swinging howler monkeys and gorgeous capuchins making their home within. The beaches are also something else!\n\nWe wholeheartedly reccomend this 3-hour guided tour in the reserve. You’ll learn loads about the local animal life and get taken on secret trails.\n\nCheck out what surfing is like in Manuel Antonio\n\nArenal\n\nThe Arenal Volcano has risen to become one of the top adventure destinations in Costa Rica. There’s no surfing, sadly, but there is hiking in the jungles, whitewater rafting, and camping on the banks of nearby Arenal Lake.\n\nAlso don’t miss the walk to La Fortguna waterfall, which is one of the most photographed spots in the country. There’s a guided tour that includes that and the local hot springs for some hard-earned R&R at the end of the day.\n\nMonteverde cloud forests\n\nMonteverde is the gateway to the famous cloud forests of central Costa Rica. They town is awash with adventure hostels where you can organize canopy treks to walk through the jungle. Keep the eyes peeled for rare monkeys, blooming orchids, and multi-colored resplendent quetzals folks!\n\nIf you’ve got the moolah, a stay at the Koora Hotel-a Cloud Forest Resort is definitely worth it. You wake, walk out the room, and there it is – the lushest cloud forest in the whole world. Bird spotting happens from the comfort of your plush double bed there. It’s an amazing experience.\n\nQuestions about the Costa Rica surf\n\nWhere to surf in Costa Rica for beginners?\n\nTamarindo is widely considered to be one of the best beginner surf spots in Costa Rica. It has lots of peaks and decent shelter from the uber-strong SW swells. We also like the beach breaks of Nosara (on Playa Guiones) when conditions are smaller and the low-tide whitewash around Jaco. The winter months from November to April are perfect for surfing as a beginner in Costa Rica.\n\nWhere to surf in Costa Rica in January?\n\nThe northern breaks of Guanacaste province do well to hoover up the NW Pacific swells when the SW swells go low in the winter. They’re a better bet than down in the Golfo Dulce for sure. Experienced surfers might also want to consider the more challenging Costa Rica surf that waits in the Caribbean, which is at its best in December and January.\n\nIs there good surfing in Costa Rica?\n\nThere’s fantastic surf in Costa Rica. We’d say it’s one of the world’s top five surf destinations, mainly thanks to the uber-efficient ocean swells that hit the west coast all year round.\n\nWe might use affiliate links in this post.
