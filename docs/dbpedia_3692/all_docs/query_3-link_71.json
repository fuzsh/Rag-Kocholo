        "text": "CTS Member\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 7\n\nJoined: 30-October 16\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nBig Brother Australia 4\n\nMy friends in real life think I'm crazy (except for the few that I actually got addicted to these programs) for watching 80+ episodes of these shows. However the voyeur in me thinks they are amazing and I can't get enough of them. Even though I've been trying to catch up and finish these for the last ten years I'm also kind of sad I only have BBAU 5, and 6 left after this. I recently finished Celebrity Big Brother UK 4 which was my last proper British season to finish and I couldn't believe I was finally all caught up in my back log.\n\nBut it is about time, I won't live forever and I should probably finish these and move on with my life (who am I kidding). I'm actually kind of downplaying to the guy I'm seeing right now how much I actually like these shows and he still thinks it is a guilty pleasure of mine.\n\nI started watching Big Brother Australia 7 while it aired and have watched every new season when it aired. I also went back and watch Big Brother AU 1 (a very long time ago), BBAU 2, BBAU 3, and Celebrity Big Brother Australia (I think that came between 1 and 2 but I really don't remember, it has been awhile).\n\nI'm almost done with this. I'm about to start week 12, so I am right at the cusp of finishing this up. I didn't like this series at first at all. The cast was really unlikable right from the start and my loyalty lied with a weepy Elle and the UTR charming Wesley. The whole time I'm thinking though is why are these two my favorites? Elle is an old reality tv type we don't see anymore though so I probably would still like her. I like that she is going through some quarter life crisis here but she has been gone for such a long time it doesn't even matter at this point. But I did start following here on instagram and she has less than 800 followers so I'm definitely a weirdo.\n\nWesley on the other hand is great but was barely on the show. I liked him a lot whenever he showed up but it was just few and far between with them shoving Ryan, Paul, and Bree down our throats. So while Wesley will get a spot on my wall of favorites this season I can't help but think I'd forget about him any other season.\n\nThe tasks have been uninspiring and none of the twists are that fascinating but the series has somewhat grown on me. I'll be a little down when it is done just because I've been 85 episodes plus specials watching these people. I'm definitely curious to see it all play out at this point even though I know the winner.\n\nThe arcs so far:\n\nWeek 1-4 - This was probably the most volatile and exciting part of the series. I can see why they cast people like Paul, Krystal, Merlin, Igor, and Aphrodite but it was just kind of hard to stomach most of them and their opinions. I guess it is hard to really root for anyone in an argument when both people just completely suck. Looking back Aphrodite could've gone through a Sara-Marie like transformation if she had made it longer but I'm glad she was gone when she was. Igor on the other hand was god-awful and probably deserved to go first. He just crashed after the first few days and clearly was very unpleasant to be around if late evictees are still commenting how awful his burping and farting was weeks later. I also just plainly didn't like Krystal's demeanor. She was very forward thinking and progressive and a few years on her maturity would've been great but she was just too abrasive early on.\n\nWeek 5-8 - I found a new appreciation for this series around this time. While the cast is awful it might end up being more memorable than BBAU 2 for me. This is probably also my favorite time of any Big Brother series. You're just right in the heart of it and everyone lets their guard down and becomes more nuanced. The dynamics started to change a lot here as well. I was definitely sad to see Elle go but she was starting to wear a bit on me at this point. I was glad to see Merlin gone. While I clearly sided with him during his confrontation with Paul, I found him exhausting. I was glad to finally get perspective behind his eviction. He was freaking tossed to the wolves though and then handled the aftermath completely wrong. If he was going to protest the eviction he should've had more conviction and confidence behind what he was saying. I'll get to Gretel's transformation (the best part of this series) later but I believe she really overreacted as well. Understandably but man that was crazy. I also grew to really like Terri. She is definitely one of the more complex characters here. She handled her perpetual nominations and eviction survivals like a champ (That's how you do it Halfwit!). And then there is Kane, who I could never really get a grasp on. Top three contestant from the start for me but he fell drastically in the rankings.\n\nWeek 9-11 - It's been a clusterfuck of a season since Merlin's eviction. Between Miriam arrival, the intruders, revealing the million dollars, Bree's wrongful eviction, and Gretel slowly losing her mind. However for a show with such weird fuck ups here at the end it has gotten very boring. The task department has hit the wall. I'm having a hard time remembering anything besides magic tricks, making a music video, and Wesley catching eggs. I hate Paul, because he thinks he is clever and the smartest guy there (which me might be at this point, but I hate that he knows it), but even he has given up trying to one up everyone. Though his final nominations for Ryan and Trevor are inspired. He seems to be going after threats.\n\nAnyway the intruders were a bust. Monica should've come in at the start, I think she would've had a good shot to win but could've also been a mid-series boot. She was pleasant but I don't know why she blew up her relationship for Ryan. Violeta was like an afternoon thunderstorm. She kind of riled everyone up and then was quickly forgotten about. Think Boog from BBAU 10 but just as an angry bitch standing on the street corner giving you a face while smoking a cigarette.\n\nBree's wrongful eviction is strange to me. From my knowledge nothing like that has ever happened on any other series, not quite like this. Sure Charley has her fake eviction in BBUK8 and we get Nikki 2.0 in BBUK 7 but this is different. Bree 2.0 feels like a shell of her former self yet it appears she is more popular than ever from the outside. What's refreshing is that it doesn't go to her head and she doesn't start acting different, she still seems genuine if a little destroyed and exhausted from the whole process.\n\nI was sad to lose Wesley, who again was by far my favorite. Ashalea had an amazing exit interview with Gretel. I miss the excitement and celebration of evictions. While I love Emma's interviews on new BBUK, I feel like the show has turned into calling people out for the shit they pulled. Which is fine but she not what it used to be. That being said I also didn't care much for Ashalea until the end. Her dumb trope didn't play with me and it usually does. She didn't really grow on me until this final week and I regularly ranked her pretty low. I think she was tainted by her early Merlin and Ryan never quite there showmances.\n\nTL;DR - I hated these people, then they grew on me, I love Wesley, and now I'm kind of bored here at the end. I'm mainly watching for Gretel Killeen's mid life crisis.\n\nThis post has been edited by ptcruisn56: Mar 24 2017 , 07:24:38 PM\n\nCTS Member\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 7\n\nJoined: 30-October 16\n\nAge: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nAnd with that BBAU4 is over, definitely turned into a very mid-tier season. More enjoyable than the awfulness of BBAU9 and will certainly be more memorable than BBAU2 (cause I couldn't tell you what Shannon, Brodie, Aaron, and Sahra did) but who knows maybe down the line I'll be like Kane?\n\nMy biggest takeaway from this is how I didn't really enjoy Ashalea for most of it. Her showmance lusting in the first few weeks was obvious and dumb pandering to the audience and I much preferred her later on when she didn't care anymore about anyone. I also enjoyed Ryan and Bree a lot more than I thought. Not that they are top tier housemates and definitely MOR fodder in nearly every season of BBUK, I just felt they at least did something and had the potential to be pleasant. Ryan's sense of humor pretty much equated dressing in drag (hilarious...) and saying how things were gay (oh 2004 you!) but he also ruined Monica's relationship promoted and wasn't Paul, Trevor, Merlin, Kane, Igor.\n\nI actually really appreciated Bree, after Terri and Elle I thought she was the most dynamic of the women and clearly didn't see at first how she controlled all of the girls (even Catherine). However she had no right to be in this position and was kind of thrust into it because of how awful or beta the rest of the women were. She'd be a forgettable lackey of Ja'Mie in private school girl in any other setting. I thought she was even better after her accidental eviction trying to figure out if it was all worth it and why she was still even there. I surely didn't understand because Week 9 seems very fitting but somehow she made it all the way to second. Granted out of the final five she totally deserved to win but I never felt like the audience was really behind her.\n\nTrevor isn't the worst you can do for a Big Brother winner but he didn't even do anything. Ryan from BBAU11 is so much more memorable and Ryan wasn't even on the show. I mean he's better than Benjamin and for crying out loud Pete but I don't know how you go from someone like Reggie to Trevor.\n\nPaul is gross and minus few moments early on where he decided he was just going to fuck up the tasks (and then the producers ruined it by making him the savior of the melon dropping task) he is vile the whole way through. He also apparently had a piece of the shag carpet in his hair for 6 weeks.\n\nThe real star of this season is Gretel's transformation from mild mannered host to raging she-devil who hates production, constantly shushes the audiences, jokes but secretly demands for more money, and screams \"quiet as a mouse\"\n\nThis series played \"This is How Life Should Be\" more tan the actual progressive commercial I know it from\n\nI hated Aphrodite but man I wish she had somehow made it in a few weeks, we would've discussed her wardrobe for years\n\nHere is my chart for the series.\n\nThis post has been edited by ptcruisn56: Mar 28 2017 , 07:39:16 PM"
