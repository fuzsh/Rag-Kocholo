        "text": "Post by DTP. on\n\nRAW is WAR - April 3, 2000\n\nStaples Center in Los Angeles, California\n\nLive on the USA Network\n\nOne night separated from WrestleMania 2000, RAW is WAR kicks off with the opening video package followed by the powerful showcase of pyrotechnics. The Staples Center in Los Angeles was booming, as Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler welcomed us to the fallout of WrestleMania 2000. J.R. and the King talked about the WWF European Championship being on the line when new champion Chris Jericho defends against Eddie Guerrero and cousins collide when Hardcore Holly defends the WWF Hardcore Championship against Crash!\n\nLos Angeles exploded as The Rock made his way out to the roaring crowd, 'the Brahma Bull' coming off of an emotional rollercoaster of disappointment and betrayal last night at WrestleMania. The Rock shunned the capacity crowd's chants by declaring that the Rock was back in Hollywood, but while in normal cases being in Hollywood would be electrifying, there is only one thing on his mind: and that is reclaiming the World Wrestling Federation Championship! The Rock discussed how Triple H, alongside his sl*t of a wife Stephanie played the waiting game all along when Vince McMahon - the biggest assh*le walking God's green earth stabbed the Rock in the ring. Not to mention Shane McMahon, twinkle-toes himself, sticking his head where it doesn't belong. The Rock talked about how it didn't matter that the McMahons stood in his way last night at WrestleMania 2000: because one way or another, the McMahons would feel the Rock's wrath when he kicks their candy-asses up and down LA!\n\nRock's comments must have gone overheard by the powers that be, as Vince McMahon came out to the stage accompanied by his son, Shane McMahon. The Chairman of the company and his prodigal son stood frozen on the ramp, as the Staples Center - as encouraged by the Rock - chanted \"assh*le\" their way, but finally the boss spoke up. Vince told Rock that he had a problem with the way that the Rock was talking about his family. He discussed how Rock was painting his family out to be the bad guys, despite how far from the truth that is. Vince claimed that without Vincent Kennedy McMahon, the Rock would be working the flea markets in downtown LA; that Shane was the mastermind that brought this family back together once more; and how his daughter Stephanie was an angel married to an intelligent WWF Superstar by the name of Triple H: the same Triple H that beat the Rock clean as a whistle at WrestleMania last night! The fact of the matter is: Rock wasn't getting his rematch. The 'Brahma Bull' refused to take no for an answer, telling Vince that it didn't matter - if he isn't getting Triple H, then he wants Vince and Shane to take a walk down to his ring and get ready for an ass-whooping of a lifetime courtesy of the Rock!\n\nShane took the mic and ran down Los Angeles for their lack of hygiene and self-respect, before telling Rock that he is in luck because if anybody wants a piece of the Rock's ass, it is him. After what he did last night, giving his beloved sister Stephanie the Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow - Rock doesn't know or probably care that she can hardly walk! Shane was about to issue the challenge to Rock, when Vince took the microphone, telling Shane that this isn't what they had planned. Vince shut the people up as they attempted to scream slurs at the McMahons, before telling Rock that tonight it would be in fact, The Rock taking on Shane McMahon...but also his father, Vince McMahon himself! LA erupted, as Rock raised an eyebrow, telling the McMahons that they had just signed their death warrant, because tonight in the main event, he would take Shane's prodigal head and take Vince's gigantic head - and what the Rock was going to do was stick the McMahon's heads inside each other's asses! A handicap match with the Rock and the McMahons - one hell of a main event in store tonight!\n\nBackstage, the World Wrestling Federation Champion Triple H and his wife Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were seen arriving at the building, Stephanie complaining about her neck to her husband. 'The Game' and the boss's daughter were stobbed by a stage-hand, and the expression on the WWF Champion's face changed - the power couple storming off in an apparent reaction to what was said in the ring.\n\nBack live, the new WWF European Champion Chris Jericho made his way out to the ring for his very first title defense. With Chyna beside him, 'the Millennium Man' ushered us into RAW is Jericho. Y2J was stoked to represent Europe after ousting Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit last night - although if he had it his way, he would also be WWF Intercontinental Champion right now. But his opponent tonight also claims to be a man of culture, a man of mystique - and that man is Eddie Guerrero. Jericho climbed into the ring declaring that tonight the greasy, greasy mullet of Eddie Guerrero's would hit the ground!\n\n1) Eddie Guerrero def. Chris Jericho (w/Chyna) (c) to win the WWF European Championship (5:24)\n\nAfter enduring a humiliating defeat against 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' last night, Eddie Guerrero hoped to rebound by taking the WWF European Championship from Chris Jericho. Y2J competed in not one but two falls against two highly skilled Superstars in Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, but came out of it with one of Angle's titles. Both men in this contest went back and forth, with Eddie slyly gaining the upper hand. Eddie was in control, but when the fight went outside, Chyna intimidated him back inside! Chyna followed Eddie, the challenger cowering when Chyna went to strike him just to take out the referee! Jericho came back inside, just to eat a shocking clothesline from 'the Ninth Wonder of the World'! Once associates suddenly turned enemies, as Chyna planted Y2J with a DDT, allowing Eddie to take the win!\n\nEddie Guerrero had successfully won his first title in the World Wrestling Federation! But as Chyna handed Eddie the WWF European Championship, Eddie was puzzled - why did his enemy turn on her friend to allow him win the title? Chyna marched out of the ring with Guerrero, when Eddie was stopped by 'the Ninth Wonder of the World', where the amazon French kissed Eddie! His eyes grew wide, as he raised the title in celebration - hand in hand with Chyna, no less!\n\nIn their office, Vince McMahon was seen with his son Shane McMahon - now in an argument with Triple H! Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley looked on nervously as the WWF Champion argued with his father-in-law about how the McMahons had challenged the Rock to a handicap match tonight. Triple H told Vince and Shane that they should have asked him first, to which Vince reminded 'the Game' who was in charge here! Triple H told Vince and Shane to enjoy it, because he wouldn't be there to save the day like he did last night! H walked out, leaving Stephanie - as Vince barked that Rock's ass was toast tonight on their hands! The McMahon-Helmsley alliance was falling apart, only twenty-four hours after forming!\n\nReturning to his office, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley held her neck whilst talking to Vince McMahon about her winning the WWF Women's Championship last week. Vince told his daughter how proud he was of her, before asking how her neck was doing. Stephanie told Vince how she was hurting, but attempted to dissuade him to allowing Triple H to help out. She cited that Hunter may be hot-headed, but deep down he's concerned what the Rock will do to her family in the handicap match tonight. Vince soon relented, telling his daughter that he would consider it: but this is what the Rock has coming tonight - especially after what he did to his precious daughter.\n\nIn the arena, the Godfather and D-Lo Brown were making their way to the ring accompanied by half-a-dozen Hos, presented specially by the Godfather's connections to his escort service. Brown's head gyrated whilst Godfather welcomed everybody to come aboard the Ho Train! Godfather said that WrestleMania was a party, but the fun is yet to take place because tonight they've got T&A in their corner, and in the corner going against them! And of course, he's talking about the newest girl on the block Trish Stratus. Godfather insinuated that if Trish ever got bored of Test and Albert, to just come aboard and 'Pimp Daddy' would take good care of her!\n\n2) T&A (w/Trish Stratus) def. D-Lo Brown and the Godfather (w/Hos) (3:18)\n\nWrestleMania 2000 was a party for D-Lo Brown and the Godfather. They opened the jam-packed house in Arrowhead Pond, whilst Ice-T played them to the ring, rapping to the fans' delight. But unfortunately it was the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan who came out on top, and the Pimps were out for a win, the night after WrestleMania. T&A were fueled by the comments of Godfather about their new manager Trish Stratus, who scowled in 'the Pimp Daddy's direction. Godfather as a result received the brunt of a beating from Test and Albert, who powered him around. D-Lo finally got the tag and ran wild on both men, but at ringside Godfather fought with Test, when Trish suddenly approached him and stroked his chest! The distraction allowed Albert to deliver a chokebomb on Brown, taking the win!\n\nThe Godfather shoved Trish Stratus away from him and slid into the ring as Albert rolled out - D-Lo Brown and the Godfather suffering a second loss in two nights, tonight courtesy of T&A! Trish stood on the ramp with her newly assembled team: and what a unit Test and Albert were becoming, with the poised seductive assistance of the newcomer, Trish!\n\nBackstage, Kurt Angle was seen talking to referee Tim White about the results of last night's two-fall Triple Threat match that saw him lose both the WWF Intercontinental and European Championships. Angle told Tim that he wasn't sure what he saw, but what he did know was that he lost neither fall, and should still be the Eurocontinental Champion. Tim told Kurt that the rules clearly stated that it was every man for himself, and that his result stood. White left, leaving Angle vexed and in denial about the title losses.\n\nIn the parking lot, Michael Cole caught a word with the overjoyed Eddie Guerrero and Chyna following Guerrero's win of the WWF European Championship earlier tonight. Eddie told Michael that it felt so good to be the champion of Europe - citing his ancient ancestors were descendants of Spain in Europe. Michael then asked 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' about her actions, turning on Chris Jericho the way she did. Chyna told Michael it doesn't take an intelligent man to figure it out - the fact is, Y2J is a loser, and although she resisted for as long as she could - she could just not resist \"Latino Heat\". Eddie was glowing, as they entered the lot hand-in-hand, where Eddie and Chyna hopped into a low-rider, driving off and leaving the Staples Center!\n\n3) Crash Holly def. Hardcore Holly (c) to win the WWF Hardcore Championship (4:08)\n\nFollowing the controversial 13-man Hardcore Battle Royal last night at WrestleMania, Hardcore Holly was putting the WWF Hardcore Championship against his own cousin Crash tonight. For Crash, who has become something of a fixture of the the division and was the man behind the institution of a 24/7 rule, it was about re-earning his prize. Hardcore and Crash immediately argued and went at it, each exchanging hard shots with a trash can and a stop sign. Crash was busted open again, twenty-four hours after a hard shot cut him open in the Battle Royal, but despite this he remained resilient against his older cousin. Holly was about to put Crash away with the Falcon Arrow when Tazz hit the ring - the man Hardcore stole the title from in the closing seconds of that match - Tazz locking in the Tazzmission on Hardcore! Tazz looked to win the title, when Crash slammed a trash can over both men's heads, Crash stealing the win!\n\nIn a fashion so similar to how Hardcore Holly came to be WWF Hardcore Champion last night, Crash Holly had successfully regained the title tonight, perhaps with thanks to pay to Tazz in his interference here tonight! Crash hopped the barricade, proudly displaying his title - which he now held for a third time in his career! Tazz was mad, as was Hardcore, who were left behind having words in the ring.\n\nIn the locker room, Shane McMahon spoke with Big Show about a disappointing outcome in the Fatal 4-Way elimination match last night. The big man was not saddened about the loss however, Show telling Shane that he should be over the moon. He said that since Saturday Night Live several weeks ago, the phone has not stopped ringing; he was getting calls - the people want more of Big Show! He explained that tonight they were in Los Angeles, the City of Angels - which meant one thing and one thing only: tonight, the Big Show was live and in living color when he gives Hollywood exactly what they want! Show left, leaving Shane confused about what had just occurred.\n\nMid-ring in the Staples Center Michael Cole stood by as he discussed the match that tore the house down at WrestleMania twenty-four hours ago, of course talking about the Triangle Ladder match for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Cole called it one of the greatest matches of the new Millennium, before introducing the victors in the match. The new WWF Tag Team Champions Edge and Christian made their way down to the ring, dressed to impress whilst also covered in bandages - truly the souvenir of a chaotic and dangerous match that included ladders, tables and chairs. Cole attempted to ask the duo on their feelings about winning the Ladder match, but Edge and Christian quickly took over. Edge was disingenuous, claiming that they rocked the tag team division and that all six of them put in one hell of an effort. But Edge was sarcastic, and Christian repeatedly chimed in saying that the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz were \"second-rate\" and came up short to Edge and Christian. Though Edge spoke out, talking about one tag team that truly gave it their all and came so close - yet so far away! They were talking about the Hardy Boyz.\n\nThe Hardy Boyz made their way out to the rampway, Jeff and Matt not looking as worse for wear as Edge and Christian; whilst the WWF Tag Team Champions continued to talk about how great the Hardys were - but the fact remained if they weren't risking their bodies and seriously harming themselves, they could have taken the whole thing. Christian told the Hardy Boyz that it's alright to win silver, but that there is a long, fine line between silver and gold! The arrogance of the new champions had irked the Hardys, who now stormed down the rampway, but as Jeff and Matt approached the ring, the Dudley Boyz came from behind, attacking Edge and Christian! D-Von and Bubba Ray - the third team in the Triangle Ladder match - traded blows with the champs, when the Hardys got into it with the Dudleys! Jeff and Matt fought with D-Von and Bubba Ray, allowing Edge and Christian to slip out of the ring as fast as they could; Edge and Christian reminding the two sets of brothers in the ring that they were the winners at WrestleMania - and if they thought they could be as good as them, to think again because those titles weren't going anywhere. A wild transformation from Edge and Christian, who have only been champions for twenty-four hours!\n\nIn the DX locker room Triple H was sat on a couch talking with X-Pac and Road Dogg, the World Wrestling Federation Champion continuing to discuss his problems with the Rock facing Vince and Shane McMahon tonight. X-Pac asked why he couldn't get involved where he pleased, being a matter of family. But 'the Game' confessed that Stephanie would be real mad at him. Road Dogg told Hunter that she may be, but he is the WWF Champion - and they are D-Generation X. They left Triple H to contemplate, seemingly caught up with an idea.\n\nBack live, Kurt Angle continued to bicker about losing both the WWF Intercontinental and European Championships last night, but this time with Howard Finkel, who was the ring announcer last night. Kurt once again complained that he lost neither falls, and that he should still be the undisputed Eurocontinental Champion. After all, he is an 'American Hero'. But 'the Fink' was having none of it, telling Kurt that he should take it up with referee Tim white - all Howard did these days was call it like he saw it. Finkel left, once again leaving Angle scorned and bitter.\n\nVal Venis waltzed down to the ring for his match against the Big Show, 'the Big Valbowski' immediately taking to the microphone to discuss how hot and raucous last night's Catfight was! Val asked how much the people liked watching the Kat and Terri rip each other apart - including their clothes! But he knew the ladies out there were really watching the guest referee in that match - sincerely yours, 'the Big Valbowski'. Val asked the women in Los Angeles if they wanted to star in Val's next Hollywood blockbuster, when the Big Show interrupted...dressed up as Val Venis! The Big Show declared himself as 'the Big Showbowski' and wowed the ladies by climbing into the ring and immediately talking about his package: Show whipping off his towel and wowing the ladies by revealing a large pair of Val Venis' trunks! Val whipped his towel off quick, not pleased by Show's imitation.\n\n4) The Big Showbowski def. Val Venis by disqualification (1:50)\n\nWe all heard the Big Show talk about how he wanted to take a new approach with all of the calls from directors he had been receiving since starring on Saturday Night Live several weeks ago, but by appearing as the world's largest chick magnet was something nobody in Los Angeles expected tonight! Val immediately hammered away at the impersonator - but the seven-foot giant clubbed back. Val was resilient and tried to chop Show down, just to get ousted from the ring, leaving Val frustrated. The Big Showbowski thrusted his hips to the screams of women in the audience, which set Venis off, coming from behind and low-blowing the Big Show!\n\nVal Venis had appeared to lose his cool at the Big Show - or should we say, the Big Showbowski - but it appeared that the Big Show within was reawakened with the low blow. As the women booed Val for his outrage, the Big Show recovered quickly and immediately grabbed 'the Big Valbowski' by the throat - dropping him with a thunderous Showstopper! Show left as the man he was last night, but this time the people - ladies in particular - seemed to love him more.\n\nToo Cool were seen watching on a television what they had just witnessed, and Grandmaster Sexay was beside himself with laughter at the Big Show! Sexay mocked the Big Showkowski, calling him the world's largest clown whilst Scotty 2 Hotty thought it wasn't so bad. Sexay called Show a huge idiot, whereas Scotty told Sexay that they needed to head to the ring next, and show the Radicalz what was poppin' with Too Cool.\n\nAl Snow was backstage with his Head Cheese comrade Steve Blackman, Al assuring 'the Lethal Weapon' that they may not have picked up the 'W' last night at WrestleMania, but they gave the fans a moment they won't ever forget when they destroyed Chester McCheeserton. Blackman wasn't so sure, not seeing the importance in entertainment over victory. Kurt Angle appeared, 'the American Hero' once again looking for anybody to complain to about the \"unfair\" two-fall Triple Threat match last night. But rather quickly, Chris Benoit showed up. The WWF Intercontinental Champion glared Angle in the eyes, as he told Kurt to quit running his mouth to everybody but him. 'The Canadian Crippler' told Kurt he'd give him his rematch tonight, before leaving. Angle scoffed, letting out a sarcastic thankyou to the new champion. Two titles have changed already tonight - could a third?\n\n5) Too Cool vs The Radicalz (Perry Saturn and WWF Light Heavyweight Champion Dean Malenko) ended in a no-contest (2:52)\n\nToo Cool were victorious last night in six-person tag team action against the Radicalz, but the loss suffered by Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko surely fueled their fire headed into tag team action tonight. Scotty 2 Hotty in particular brought the fight to both Saturn and Malenko, but the numbers game was too much for Scotty and the technicians went to work on the legs of Scotty. But Scotty showed heart, and began to wow the capacity crowd with his agility - setting up for the Worm on Malenko. But before he had a chance to do so, the Big Show made his way down to the ring, immediately fending Saturn off and causing Malenko to roll out of the ring.\n\nScotty was frozen with fear when glancing up at the no-longer Big Showkowski, when 'the Big Nasty B*stard' turned to Grandmaster Sexay, dragging him into the ring! Show picked Sexay up by the throat, repeatedly asking him about his comments made about him moments ago, asking how much of a clown he was now! Show delivered the Showstopper to Sexay, whilst Scotty watched on - wisely leaving the ring in fear. Show stood in dominance when Rikishi Phatu made his way out to the ring to face off with Show! Too Cool were clearly not about to go after the Big Show - but somebody of Rikishi's size wasn't about to back down from a fight! Show stared the Samoan down before leaving on his own accord, leaving Rikishi and Scotty to tend to the fallen Grandmaster Sexay.\n\nOutside of his dressing room Kevin Kelly was standing by with the Rock. He attempted to ask the Rock about tonight's handicap match and dissension among the McMahon-Helmsley alliance, but Rock hushed him in no time. He mocked Kevin Kelly's question and said that what it came down to was how much the Rock cared about the alliance, how he couldn't give a monkey cr*p about what Triple H said to Vince, what Stephanie said to Vince, what Shane said to the Big Showkowski - it doesn't matter. Because one way or another, they were all getting their candy asses beat by the Rock, and it starts tonight against the McMahons. Rock insinuated there was more than meets the eye with Vince and Shane, father and son. But tonight, the Rock was going to give Hollywood a show that included whooping their candy asses, and when that was all said and done, he was coming back for the gold - he was coming back for Triple H.\n\n6) Kane (w/Paul Bearer) def. Big Bossman (w/Bull Buchanan) (2:42)\n\n'The Big Red Machine' had an eventful night at the grandest stage in sports entertainment. He was successful in teaming with Rikishi Phatu to defeat longtime rivals X-Pac and Road Dogg, but on top of that Kane, for a third consecutive year, sent Pete Rose on a one-way trip to Hell with a Tombstone Piledriver. But he wasn't the only one with success, as the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan scored what some would call an upset victory against the Godfather and D-Lo Brown. Tonight, Bossman tried to match up with Kane and even with distractions from Buchanan, could not quite get the job done. Finally Buchanan distracted the referee, which allowed Bossman to use the nightstick - but the prison guard from Atlanta, Georgia regardless found himself subjected to a big Chokeslam from 'the Big Red Machine', for the win.\n\nKane stood tall and looked to raise his arms for the fire and brimstone to follow, but instead Bull Buchanan jumped him from behind with a shot from the nightstick! Buchanan nailed Kane again with it, causing 'the Big Red Machine' to crumble through the ropes to the floor, and Buchanan wouldn't let up with his ambush! Buchanan scared off Kane's father, Paul Bearer, before looking to exact more punishment but Kane fired back! The brawl continued, but Bossman jumped Kane from behind - the two prison guards hammering on Kane! Kane fought back, knocking Buchanan down and causing Bossman to retreat up the side of the entrance-way - this fight going to the back!\n\nWith the cameras losing the brawl between Kane, the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan, we went to Vince and Shane McMahon, who were talking strategy about tonight's match with the Rock. Shane seemed more nervous than earlier, to which his father explained was just butterflies. Shane asked Vince what to do against Rock, whom he managed as recent as twenty-four hours ago. The Chairman hesitantly told Shane to watch out for the Rock Bottom, before shrugging and leaving. Shane asked how that was real advice.\n\nBack live on RAW is WAR and the fight between Kane and the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan continued! The prison guards had 'the Big Red Machine' on all fours as Buchanan held Kane for a clubbing with the nightstick from Bossman! Bossman and Buchanan had managed to beat down Kane, when the Acolytes showed up, Bradshaw and Faarooq causing Bossman and Buchanan to retreat from the scene of the crime! The Acolyte Protection Agency were in business, as they told Bossman and Buchanan to buck up their ideas in future, because they were coming for them!\n\n7) Chris Benoit (c) def. Kurt Angle to retain the WWF Intercontinental Championship (5:35)\n\nKurt Angle's luck had changed, being issued this rematch against Chris Benoit tonight. 'The American Hero' had been beside himself over losing both the WWF Intercontinental and European Championships last night to Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho - but despite complaining to referee Tim White and ring announcer Howard Finkel, it took Benoit confronting him to get his rematch. Angle and Benoit, both skilled on the mat, went pound-for-pound with the Olympic Gold Medalist managing to gain control. 'The Canadian Crippler' however took Angle to work with submissions, a cross-armbreaker almost costing Angle the match, had it not been for the bottom rope. Angle went on the defense, managing to block the Crippler Crossface, and Angle managed to hit the Olympic Slam, but this time Benoit's foot was on the ropes! Angle went bezerk at Tim White, calling claims of a conspiracy - which in turn allowed Benoit to roll Angle up, retaining the title!\n\nChris Benoit backed up the ramp with the WWF Intercontinental Championship, his first defense coming successful despite Kurt Angle's best efforts! Angle was furious, in disbelief that he had lost to 'the Canadian Crippler' twice in two nights - and 'the American Hero' wasted no time getting in Tim White's face once again! Angle claimed that he trusted Tim, but White wasn't hearing any of it. The referee turned his back, and this allowed Angle to reach from behind and lock the helpless referee in a Chickenwing Crossface! Angle finally relented, but this wasn't going to change the fact Kurt Angle was no longer a double champion.\n\nThe McMahons were seen walking the halls backstage, moments away from the biggest handicap match in recent memory. Shane was looking at his father Vince for some confidence, to which the Chairman ignored his plight, telling Shane to hang in there - the Rock was going down, McMahon-style!\n\n8) The Rock def. Vince and Shane McMahon in a Handicap match (6:03)\n\nAfter the vote of confidence Vince McMahon had shown in the Rock leading up to WrestleMania all a part of the plan from the newly united McMahon-Helmsley alliance, the Rock wanted nothing more than to get his hands on Vince and Shane after last night's screwjob at WrestleMania. The Rock did exact some revenge following the loss to Triple H in the WWF Championship Fatal 4-Way elimination match - but this was a sanctioned World Wrestling Federation match, and in Hollywood the Rock was the hero in everybody's mind. Shane attempted to handle Rock to start, but 'the Brahma Bull' easily took care of him and allowed Shane to tag in his father to wrestle. Vince and Rock sized up, but Shane wisely came from behind - this being a ploy as Vince and Shane bombarded Rock with rights and lefts! Vince postured around whilst Shane interfered where necessary. Despite this, Rock - with much more ring experience than both McMahon combined - fired back, and delivered a Spinebuster to Shane, followed by a Spinebuster to Vince! Rock looked for the People's Elbow, but X-Pac and Road Dogg hit the ring! Rock sent X-Pac flying over the top, then traded blows with Road Dogg - this handicap match appearing to be over!\n\nThe Rock delivered the Rock Bottom to Road Dogg, when Vince low blowed 'the Brahma Bull' from behind! Shane then followed suit, dropping Rock with a Rock Bottom of his own! So much for his nerves, Shane McMahon was on top of the world after ousting Rock with his own move! Suddenly, out came Triple H and his wife Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, the WWF and Women's Champions greeting their family in the ring, where 'the Game' happily hugged his father-in-law and brother-in-law! Triple H then took to stomping away at the Rock, 'the Game' talking trash to Rock that this was their world! He looked to plant Rock with a Pedigree, but Rock back dropped the WWF Champion over the top rope! Rock scared the three McMahons from the ring, before dishing out a Rock Bottom to X-Pac! Rock stood tall on the second rope, glaring down the McMahon-Helmsley alliance - and it was clear that he wanted the WWF Championship!\n\nPost by DTP. on\n\nSmackDown! - April 6, 2000\n\nSan Jose Arena in San Jose, California\n\nBroadcast on UPN\n\nTaped April 4, 2000\n\nThe first edition of Thursday Night SmackDown! on UPN kicked off with a shot from within the DX Bus, where World Wrestling Federation Champion Triple H alongside his wife, WWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, Road Dogg, X-Pac and Tori all arrived at the Arena in San Jose. D-Generation X appeared to be in high spirits, despite coming up short in an ambush attempt on the Rock this past Monday night on RAW. What did DX have in mind for 'the Brahma Bull' tonight?\n\nThe opening video package concluded, triggering a vibrant firework dispay for the capacity crowd here in San Jose! Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler discussed the events following WrestleMania, as tonight the Big Show will do battle with Rikishi Phatu; and the Dudley Boyz will take on the Hardy Boyz, three nights removed from a hellacious Triangle Ladder match!\n\nKurt Angle made his way down to the ring for a match, 'the American Hero' coming off of a loss of epic proportions in losing the two-fall Triple Threat match at WrestleMania, which cost him both the WWF Intercontinental and European Championships. Angle addressed the crowd as he walked, saying that it had not been a great week and that even an Olympic Gold Medalist like himself was man enough to admit it. Not only did he lose his titles to Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho at WrestleMania on Sunday, but he lost his cool when referee Tim White cost him his rematch this past Monday on RAW is WAR. Angle brought up a replay showing himself arguing with White - which led to Benoit rolling Angle up to retain the title - before locking him in the Chickenwing Crossface. Angle said it was unbecoming of a man with intensity, integrity and intelligence. Angle introduced Tim White out to the ring to officiate his match, vowing that he would never lay a finger on White again - also claiming that sooner than later he would once more be a champion of the people: the Eurocontinental Champion.\n\n1) Kurt Angle def. The Godfather (w/Hos) (3:23)\n\nThe people of San Jose loved to see the Godfather accompanied by his Hos, but tonight 'the Pimp Daddy' was riding solo as it was announced that D-Lo Brown was not here due to a family emergency. Tim White appeared hesitant around Kurt Angle following 'the American Hero's anger getting the better of him with Monday's loss to Chris Benoit, and Angle appeared to have turned a new leaf; fighting fairly and following White's rulings throughout the match. Godfather attempted to make a comeback, but when Angle dodged the Ho Train Angle delivered a German suplex before following up with the Olympic Slam, returning the Olympian to his winning ways.\n\nKurt Angle celebrated triumphantly, but contrary to what he told referee Tim White before the match, the Olympic Gold Medalist raised White's hand with excitement; Angle even hugging the nervous official in victory! It appeared that despite losing the WWF European and Intercontinental Championships last Sunday at WrestleMania, the man with the \"Three Is\" was back tonight.\n\nIn the backstage lobby Vince and Shane McMahon were discussing how great last Monday was. They may have come up short against the Rock, but tonight was a different night. Shane admitted that it felt great competing side by side with his old man on RAW. Triple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley showed up, accompanied by D-Generation X - and it appeared this McMahon-Helmsley faction were headed for the ring!\n\nWe returned to SmackDown! to see D-Generation X making their way to the ring, led by the WWF Champion Triple H and WWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. X-Pac, his girlfriend Tori and Road Dogg followed, as last Monday night on RAW was recapped showing DX's involvement in the handicap main event between the Rock and the McMahons. Upon entry, the boss's daughter took the microphone as she demanded these people give D-Generation X the appreciation they deserved! After all, her husband and his friends were the people that saved her family from a vicious assault last Monday night at the hands of the malicious 'Brahma Bull'. The fans chanted \"assh*le\" in the champ's way, whilst calling Stephanie a \"sl*t\" much to her chagrin. Stephanie continued to talk about the Rock and his wicked ways, claiming that she's still sore and shouldn't even be here tonight after the Rock Bottom and People's Elbow she endured last Sunday at WrestleMania. But like her father and her brother, she was a fighter, and she was a survivor - but she was lucky to be married to a man like her husband: the unbeaten and undisputed WWF Champion, Triple H!\n\n'The Game' smirked at his wife's kind words before taking over. Triple H said that this was all one big experiment that was going on day by day with the McMahons. He won't lie - Triple H never thought there would be a day where the McMahon Family and D-Generation X would stand all as one against a common threat - but the Rock has brought out the best in all of them. Which is why the McMahon-Helmsley faction have aligned. Whether you like it or not, Triple H is the leader that the World Wrestling Federation needs right now! And the Rock isn't! And for the greater good of this great company, DX and the McMahons stand united against the Rock, and anybody else that wants to challenge them in the future!\n\nThe McMahons soon made their way down to the ring, the WWF Chairman Vince and his son Shane - both apparently feeling the effects of Monday's handicap match with the Rock. Upon entering, Triple H had the audacity to hug his father-in-law - the two rivals raising one another's hand! Shane hugged his sister, before the McMahons exchanged pleasantries with X-Pac, Road Dogg and Tori. Vince took over, telling Triple H that every single word he said was absolutely true! And maybe it took him a while to figure it all out - but it was indeed for the greater good of this company, and this business quite frankly! Vince said that as long as the Rock stands in their way, the McMahons and the Helmsley clan have banded together to combat 'the People's Champ' - and make sure he will never, ever be the World Wrestling Federation Champion!\n\nVince joked that Rock is an evil, foul excuse for a human being. Not only is he a barbarian that likes to beat up on women like daughter Stephanie, innocent bystanders such as his son Shane, and his employer - yours truly. But the Rock has an infatuation with shoving things up people's asses! Vince talked about what comes out of a person's ass - fecal matter. And as he has proven time and time again, asses aren't the only thing in which fecal matter comes out of - fact of the matter is, the Rock is full of crap! The people chanted \"assh*le\" at the boss, who demanded they shut up while he announces the plan for tonight! Vince said that he and Shane came up just a little short on Monday, but that's not to say that the Rock is out of the woods just yet. Because tonight on SmackDown!, it would be the Rock in a different handicap match: and this time, he would be up against X-Pac and Road Dogg of D-Generation X! And tonight, when DX reigns supreme and 'the People's Champ' has fallen, true justice will be served when the Rock is staring up at the bright lights, and the McMahon-Helmsley faction are standing tall over his carcass! The unit left, another unfair disadvantage that the Rock has been put in - another roadblock between Rock and the WWF Championship!\n\nKevin Kelly was in the locker room with the Dudley Boyz, moments before what should be another instant classic between themselves and the Hardy Boyz. Kevin asked Bubba Ray and D-Von their thoughts about Jeff and Matt Hardy, and where they see themselves in the tag title hunt. Bubba said simply that their focus is on regaining the WWF Tag Team Championships, which is why tonight they are going to go out there and beat the Hardys, and then they are coming for Edge and Christian. D-Von testified, as the Dudleys were set for action next.\n\n2) The Hardy Boyz def. The Dudley Boyz (5:50)\n\nFour nights ago these two teams were a part of history in the making when they stole the show at WrestleMania 2000, competing in a Triangle Ladder match for the WWF Tag Team Championships, in which all four fell at the hands of Edge and Christian. Last Monday on RAW, Edge and Christian antagonized the Hardys, which led to a three-team free-for-all which has raised several questions about the future of the tag team division. Jeff and Matt competed as a well oiled machine against D-Von early on, but quickly the brute force of the Dudleys fought back and went right to work on the older brother Matt. In the ring, Jeff made the tag and ran wild, but soon fell victim to a full nelson bomb from Bubba, and it appeared that the 3D was nigh when Christian hit the ring to distract the referee, which allowed Edge to swoop in and clock Bubba Ray with the Tag title! Jeff hit the Swanton Bomb, and the Hardys had won this match!\n\nEdge and Christian had cost the Dudley Boyz this match, but for what purpose? The newfound arrogance of the new WWF Tag Team Champions was on full display as they high-fived outside of the ring, but little did they expect the victorious Hardy Boyz to come flying over the top rope with stereo-planchas on the champions! Jeff and Matt rained punches down on the champions, causing Edge and Christian to flee up the rampway in shock - whilst the Dudleys remained in the ring, glaring daggers in the champs' direction as well. This three team war was far from over.\n\nBackstage cameras caught up with the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan, who were storming into the locker room of the Acolytes, furious about what went down on Monday. Buchanan tipped over a wooden bench causing Bradshaw and Faarooq to stand up to confront the prison guards, but Bossman raised his nightstick towards them. Bossman was furious that the Acolytes got in their way of making an example out of 'the Big Red Machine' on RAW. Buchanan challenged them to a fight, telling the boys that their Protection Agency was a good idea - but who was going to protect them from Bossman and Buchanan? Bradshaw fired back telling the guards that they were in for the asskicking of a lifetime tonight!\n\nIn the parking lot, the low-rider of Eddie Guerrero pulled up, and the new WWF European Champion hopped out. 'Latino Heat' was riding in style with his new \"mamacita\" Chyna, whom he opened the door for. He watched as 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' stepped out, Eddie kissing the hand of the amazon - Eddie commenting on what a magical few days it had been!\n\nReturning to UPN SmackDown!, Trish Stratus was seen walking with T&A behind her, Trish commenting on the disgusting comments that the Godfather had spoken of her this past Monday on RAW. Test justified that they taught the Godfather and D-Lo Brown a lesson, and that she was nothing like any of his disgusting Hos. That's when they overhead Kaientai saying the word \"Ho\", which upset Albert and Test. The two confronted Taka Michinoku and Sho Funaki, asking what they said. And in broken English, Taka and Funaki explained that Trish was in fact, a Ho! Trish was offended, and Albert told Kaientai that they had just made the worst mistake of their lives. Test said tonight they would get what was coming to them because they were sending them back to the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nElsewhere Hardcore Holly was seen stomping around the corridors, where he came across Kevin Kelly, hoping to get a word with the former WWF Hardcore Champion. Holly ordered Kelly to shut up and demanded to know if he had seen his cousin Crash anywhere tonight. Kevin said that he saw him a half hour ago, but wasn't sure where he went. Holly told Kevin to report to him when he next saw him. In the background Crash Holly was seen cowering behind a suitcase, the new WWF Hardcore Champion hiding from his determined cousin!\n\nIn the arena Latino fever was in the air, as the new WWF European Champion Eddie Guerrero held hands with his new \"mamacita\" Chyna - the two having gotten together this past Monday on RAW is WAR, where Chyna cost longtime ally Chris Jericho the title! Eddie and Chyna reminisced as a replay aired of Eddie and Chyna leaving in the low rider together Monday, as 'Latino Heat' confided in her that he was happier than he's ever been. Eddie said that not only has he captured the one title that has eluded him his entire career, but he has captured the heart of the hottest lady in the World Wrestling Federation tonight, Mamacita! Chyna appeared infatuated with Eddie as she said that she felt similarly - Eddie was the greatest man she had ever been with, if you knew what she meant. 'The Ninth Wonder of the World' compared Chris Jericho to Eddie, how Y2J was all-talk and no action. He never had the balls to ask her out, and when he tried to come onto her, it was as clear as day how he didn't have an ounce of attraction in his putrid body! Chyna called Eddie her 'Latino Heat' and that Eddie was a god in the bedroom, whilst Y2J couldn't even get it up for 'the Ninth Wonder in the World'.\n\nChris Jericho crashed the coming out party for 'Latino Heat' and 'Mamacita', the former WWF European Champion arriving on the rampway and telling Chyna and Eddie that they were a great couple! With the combination of the deep-fried grease coming off of that disgusting mullet of Eddie's, combined with the chiseled, grotesque features of 'the Ninth Wonder of the World's, the pair had the makings of a future Mexican lovechild called Pablo! 'The Millennium Man' defused the rumors of him ever seeing anything in Chyna, but turned his attention to Eddie's obsession with his 'Mamacita'. Jericho asked who was the man in their relationship, which infuriated Guerrero! Chris turned his attention to the title around Eddie's waist - saying he didn't give a damn about his Spanish ancestors, Eddie had something he wanted back - and it wasn't the six-four gargantuan towering over him in the ring! Eddie was hot and wanted to go, but Chyna snatched the microphone from her 'Latino Heat', telling Y2J that if it's a fight he wanted - a fight he'd get, with Chyna - right now! Eddie was shocked, and Y2J was more than game for redemption!\n\n3) Chyna (w/WWF European Champion Eddie Guerrero) def. Chris Jericho (4:15)\n\nThe alliance between Chris Jericho and Chyna that started when the two became reluctant co-holders of the WWF Intercontinental Championship back at the end of 1999 had come to an end on RAW when 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' betrayed Y2J in favor of her new love interest, Eddie Guerrero - who captured the WWF European Champion from Jericho three nights ago. But this was Jericho's chance for revenge, and despite Chyna's powerful arsenal, he flew circles around her, almost scoring the win with a backdrop. Eddie watched nervously biting his nails at ringside, as Y2J delivered a facebuster and attempted the springboard moonsault, but Eddie got on the apron for the distraction - just to receive a springboard dropkick for his troubles! Jericho looked for the Walls of Jericho, but Eddie tripped Jericho, allowing Chyna to take the win with a Sleeper Slam for the upset!\n\nEddie Guerrero played innocent at ringside, but was over the moon that 'Mamacita' had successfully knocked off a victory against Chris Jericho tonight on SmackDown! The WWF European Champion raised his girlfriend's hand and kissed her hand once again, but when Chyna looked to dip Eddie with a French kiss like on Monday, Y2J came back with a dropkick knocking Eddie out of the ring! Chyna went down, and Jericho retaliated by locking in the Walls of Jericho on 'the Ninth Wonder of the World'! Chyna was tapping, and Eddie clasped hands with 'Mamacita' - as referees finally managed to pull Jericho away from Chyna! Eddie helped Chyna out of the ring, but Jericho stood tall - having found the revenge he had been looking for since Monday night!\n\nIn the corridor, we got a unique angle of the rear end of Rikishi Phatu, as Scotty 2 Hotty spoke in disbelief about what happened to Grandmaster Sexay on RAW. Scotty said that the Big Show hurt Grandmaster bad, and that he would be on the shelf for a few weeks after the beating he showed him. Rikishi remained cool, calm and collected as he removed his sunglasses telling Scotty that tonight he was going to back it up, and beat the Big Show for Grandmaster. They bumped fists before parting ways.\n\nWWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley was at the water cooler talking with Tori about the intimate lives they lead with their respective partners, Triple H and X-Pac. Stephanie spoke of 'the Game' as \"a real lion\" in bed, telling her that he was a primate and she felt like his prey. But he was passionate all the same. Tori sipped her water, commenting on how X-Pac was the same: he tied her up last night and poured hot wax all over her. Stephanie was creeped out, awkwardly drinking her water.\n\n4) The Acolytes def. The Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan by disqualification (2:33)\n\nThe Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan did not enjoy suffering a loss at the hands of Kane this past Monday, and in response the two prison guards took it upon themselves to attempt to assault 'the Big Red Machine' after the bell. The two-on-one beating reached backstage, but just when Bossman and Buchanan looked to finish Kane off, the Acolytes saved the day. This bout was a barn-burner as expected, with Bradshaw and Faarooq going right at it with the corrupt guards, cleaning house with the two! The Acolytes weren't playing around, when Buchanan desperately slid a nightstick to Bossman, who slammed the weapon into the side of Faarooq's skull!\n\nDesperation times called for desperate measures, as the Big Bossman had been disqualified for use of his nightstick. Bossman pounded on Faarooq whilst Bradshaw attempted to make the save, just for Buchanan to jump Bradshaw. The guards were hammering on the Acolytes, when hellfire and brimstone lit San Jose Arena up! Kane stormed down to the ring followed by Paul Bearer, but Bossman and Buchanan retreated to the floor upon his entry. Kane stood beside a recuperating Bradshaw and Faarooq, setting off his pyrotechnics and pointing at the breathless Bossman and Buchanan.\n\nIn his locker room, the Big Show was with Shane McMahon who commented on how impressed he was with what the Big Show did last Monday on RAW. Not only did he do Val Venis' shtick even better than 'the Big Valbowski' could ever do, but he knocked Grandmaster Sexay right out of the World Wrestling Federation! Shane called Show a genius, but Show told Shane he hadn't seen anything yet - and everybody was going to see next when he battles Rikishi Phatu! Show left, leaving Shane amazed - the battle of the big men was coming up next.\n\nEarlier today, Al Snow was seen in a neighborhood with Steve Blackman. 'The Lethal Weapon' wanted to know why they were here and not at the Arena, but Al told Steve that he wanted to teach him the importance of entertainment value. Al said it wasn't always about competition and winning matches that got you \"over\", but it was how much you entertained the people. Steve claimed that was dumb, but Al told Steve to follow him. They walked into a building, with the camera panning up to show a sign reading \"Sunny Days Residential Home\".\n\n5) Showkishi def. Rikishi Phatu (3:51)\n\nHoping to expand his portfolio following the famed soundstage debut of the Big Show on Saturday Night Live, on RAW this past week the big man appeared as 'the Big Showbowski', imitating his opponent Val Venis and dismantling him with a brutal Showstopper. But he didn't stop there, injuring Grandmaster Sexay after catching word of Sexay insulting him - which did not go down well in the camp of Too Cool. But tonight, Show had a new character in his arsenal - Showkishi: dressed in a thong similar to his opponents, Showkishi wowed the people in San Jose to compete against the original - Rikishi Phatu. The Samoan and the giant went at it, with Rikishi getting the advantage early, even managing to pick Show up for a Samoan drop. But Show rebounded, splashing Rikishi in the corner and attempting the Stinkface, just to receive a low blow that went undetected by the official. Rikishi gave Showkishi his own medicine, the Stinkface delivered - but Show's laughter turned to a stern look of disdain, as he responded with an astonishing Showstopper on the 400-pounder, taking the win.\n\nThe Big Show was dominant in his victory, his demeanor having changed once again. Jerry Lawler claimed it was proving Show had range to the directors of Hollywood, but Show once again changed his demeanor when he grabbed a microphone and demanded they play Rikishi's music! The lights dimmed red, and Show stole a pair of Phatu's sunglasses - proceeding to dance how Too Cool do, to the amazement and confusion of this capacity crowd in San Jose!\n\nIn the McMahon-Helmsley dressing room Vince McMahon appeared to be having the time of his life hanging out with Triple H, X-Pac and Road Dogg. The WWF Champion talked about how the Rock didn't know what he was in for when he went up against D-Generation X tonight. Vince said he could dig it. Road Dogg and X-Pac then explained what they planned to do to 'the Brahma Bull' tonight. Vince said he could feel it \"playas\". This confused DX, and 'the Game' asked Vince if he was feeling okay. McMahon explained that he was just \"down with the kids\" and said that the Rock's getting got tonight on SmackDizzle! X-Pac appeared to crack up, causing Triple H to punch him in the shoulder to stop. The relations between the McMahons and DX were strengthening ahead of another handicap main event for the Rock.\n\nSpeaking of, the Rock - still yet to be seen tonight on SmackDown! - had remained in his locker room tonight, but he was here and you had to imagine that 'the Brahma Bull' had his mind set on combating D-Generation X and the McMahon family tonight.\n\nBack on SmackDown!, Al Snow was sitting in what appeared to be a leisure hall with a group of geriatric residents, part of the Sunny Days Residential Home. The group heckled Steve Blackman, who was reading cue cards and attempting to do stand-up comedy for the seniors. Snow was the only person laughing, and another elderly lady was telling Blackman that he stinks! 'The Lethal Weapon' complained that these jokes made no sense whatsoever! The heckling elderly lady finally got Blackman to stop, and she was met with a burning glare.\n\n6) Tazz vs Hardcore Holly ended in a no contest (3:28)\n\nBoth of these men had gotten in the other's way this past Sunday at WrestleMania, where they were two of thirteen participants in the WWF Hardcore Championship Battle Royal. 'The Human Suplex Machine' Tazz also got in Holly's way on RAW is WAR, where Hardcore hoped to retain the title, just to lose the title due to Crash's interference. Tazz and Hardcore were having a hard-hitting exchange, where Holly dropkicked Tazz for a near fall, but the Alabama native found himself in deep trouble when Tazz brought out the suplexes - and despite Holly's attempt at a Falcon Arrow, the Tazzmission was locked in! Holly struggled, when Crash Holly came through the crowd, causing Tazz to break the hold and pursue him!\n\nCrash cowered from Tazz, running around the ringside area - but Hardcore recovered and left the ring, clotheslining his younger cousin! Holly tried to attack Crash further, but Tazz continued brawling with Hardcore - allowing the WWF Hardcore Champion Crash to escape through the crowd! Family, friend or foe - where the 24/7 rule counted - it was every man for himself!\n\nKevin Kelly caught up with Chris Jericho in the hallway, wanting to get some words from Y2J after being screwed out of a match with his former friend Chyna, but getting his revenge by locking her in the Walls of Jericho. Jericho called Kevin \"Kieran\" and told him that it felt good to get a little payback on the gargantuan father of the Mex-American lovechild \"Pablo\", Chyna tonight - but that didn't change the fact that he wanted the WWF European Championship back.\n\nHe was interrupted by the appearance of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley; the WWF Women's Champion wanting to get past. Jericho stopped her and commented on how nice she looked tonight - before remarking that she looked extremely tarty tonight. He said he's seen her walking the halls, surely going from man to man, to man to woman, to old man to husband to young adult - but if she thought she could have a taste of Y2J, she had another thing coming to her! Steph was shocked, as Jericho told Stephanie that there was one thing that Jericho knew about McMahon-Helmsley - and that was that she was a \"filthy, dirty, disgusting, bottom-feeding trashbag ho!\" Stephanie warned Jericho to watch himself, it would be a horrible thing to have to strip the rest of Jericho's dignity away from him. Y2J was in high spirits, but was insulting 'the Game's wife a good idea?\n\n7) T&A (w/Trish Stratus) def. Kaientai (2:16)\n\nTest and Albert were defending the honor of their manager Trish Stratus, having been insulted by not only the Godfather and D-Lo Brown this past Monday night, but also Kaientai earlier tonight. The bodacious blonde watched with eager intent, as she watched Test and Albert get ready for action with Taka Michinoku and Funaki from Japan; but what T&A surely weren't expecting was for Kaientai to put up such a fight! Funaki almost rolled Test up for a two-count, whilst Michinoku managed to catch both T&A with an Asai moonsault on the floor! But despite Kaientai's best efforts and the San Jose crowd being firmly behind them, Trish slapped Taka across the face on the apron, before Test planted Taka with a pumphandle slam to give them the win.\n\nT&A had scored a second victory this week tonight against Kaientai, but most importantly to them, Trish Stratus' honor remained intact. Test and Albert weren't yet finished with the Japanese Superstars however, as Trish got into the ring and once again slapped an unconscious Taka across the face. She directed traffic, ordering Albert to splash Funaki in the corner, before dishing out a brutal chokebomb, leaving Kaientai mangled in the ring!\n\nThe Acolytes were in the locker room, Bradshaw and Faarooq recuperating after an attack from the nightsticks of the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan earlier tonight. Bradshaw complained about his shoulder, whilst Faarooq bickered that the nightstick to the head he received hurt worse. In stomped Kane, with Paul Bearer behind him causing the Acolytes to rise - Kane turning his head at the boys. Paul told them to relax, before holding up a wad of cash. Bradshaw reluctantly took Bearer's money, as Faarooq noted the Acolyte Protection Agency was officially in business. Bradshaw got a beer from their cooler and offered it to Kane, who hesitated before cracking open a cold one with the Acolytes!\n\nThe Rock came bursting out of his dressing room for the first time tonight! 'The People's Champ' had been here all day - but it was time to put up or shut up, as the handicap match against D-Generation X awaits next!\n\n7) The Rock def. X-Pac and Road Dogg (w/WWF Champion Triple H, WWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley and Tori) by disqualification (7:20)\n\nThe Rock's rebellion against the newly formed McMahon-Helmsley faction was sure to be a long and troubled path, having come out of WrestleMania with a head full of steam and the WWF Championship on his mind. But after outlasting Vince and Shane McMahon on RAW is WAR, tonight he had X-Pac and Road Dogg to contend with whilst Triple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley watched from ringside. Rock was full of life as the people in San Jose exploded for 'the People's Champ' early, but each time Rock turned his attention to the WWF Champion at ringside, X-Pac and Road Dogg would go right on the attack. D-Generation X were looking good but Rock - resilient as ever - came back with a flurry of punches to X-Pac! Tori got on the apron and got dragged into the ring, just to be saved from a potential Rock Bottom by Road Dogg! Road Dogg connected with the Pumphandle Drop, but Rock powered out at two! Rock was in trouble as X-Pac closed in, just to receive a Samoan drop, and Road Dogg got blasted from the ring! The Rock spinebustered X-Pac and appeared to signal for the People's Elbow, when Triple H hit the ring, dropping Rock with a brutal high knee!\n\nThe bell sounded, as a loud chorus of boos came over San Jose Arena. Triple H mounted and pounded away at the Rock, whilst D-Generation X recovered, aiding to a fallen Tori. 'The Game' wouldn't let up, but Rock soon made a miraculous comeback yet again, just to be cut off by X-Pac and Road Dogg! The two held Rock down whilst the WWF Champion rubbed the title in his face, telling Rock that he wasn't getting his title. Triple H sucker punched Rock before looking at going for a Pedigree, but Rock back dropped H before clotheslining X-Pac over the top rope! Road Dogg received a Rock Bottom, whilst Triple H collapsed out to the floor! Rock stood tall in the ring, whilst D-Generation X watched from the ringside area in disbelief! Rock was high on energy, ready to take on anybody in his way of regaining the WWF Championship!\n\nVince and Shane McMahon were seen watching the action on a monitor, as Shane asked his father what they was going to do. The WWF Chairman chuckled and turned to his prodigal son, telling Shane that the Rock would go down, on Monday night. What did the McMahon-Helmsley faction have in store for Rock on RAW?\n\nPost by DTP. on\n\nRAW is WAR - April 10, 2000\n\nNational Car Rental Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n\nLive on the USA Network\n\nA video package recapped the fallout of WrestleMania, showing the unity of the McMahon-Helmsley Regime as Vince and Shane McMahon banded together with Triple H, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley and D-Generation X with a common goal of preventing the Rock from any success. But as Rock overcame the handicapped threats he faced in the McMahons and DX last week, what is the McMahon-Helmsley Regime's next step in their plan to keep Rock from becoming WWF Champion?\n\nThe opening video package took us to the packed house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where pyrotechnics set the stage ablaze - three weeks out from WWF Backlash, Jim Ross and Jerry 'the King' Lawler welcomed us to the show on a night where Eddie Guerrero defends the WWF European Championship against Rikishi Phatu, and the team from Hell, Kane and the Acolytes do battle with the Big Bossman, Bull Buchanan and a partner of their choosing!\n\nTriple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley made their way down to the ring to kick off RAW is WAR, the World Wrestling Federation Champion and his wife, the WWF Women's Champion being received poorly by the Floridian crowd! 'The Game' took great pride as he grinned through the chants of \"assh*le\", Triple H talking about how confident he was after everything that has happened, that this is the night in which the Rock goes down. He talked about how Vince and Shane McMahon may have fallen to the Rock, but what happened this past Thursday night on SmackDown! the Rock showed weakness against D-Generation X! And it bodes well, because he knows that deep down the Rock cannot handle the pressure that comes with being the WWF Champion ever again! H had a message for 'the People's Champ', to call his spots and stay the hell out of his way if he had any sense, self-respect or dignity left - because one way or another, the Rock would be left bloodied courtesy of the McMahon-Helmsley regime!\n\nStephanie agreed with everything her husband had to say, but the WWF Women's Champion wanted to address the actions of one Chris Jericho, and what he said to her on SmackDown! Stephanie said that it appeared as though Y2J did not get who she was, or what the McMahon-Helmsley regime was all about. Triple H got in a shot at how Jericho had just come off a loss to Chyna, he thought maybe the WWF Women's Championship could be a good title for Jericho at this point. 'The Game' was full of himself, but Stephanie digressed that she wanted to make it clear that Chris Jericho would not get away with what he said, and tonight he would get with the program the easy way or the hard way, announcing that Y2J would take on Road Dogg tonight! Triple H put his arm around his wife, telling Jericho that he will get with the program just like Rock will get with the program - that the McMahon-Helmsley regime rule the World Wrestling Federation and the WWF Championship is right where it belongs over his shoulder!\n\nThe Rock came out to a thunderous ovation, 'the Brahma Bull' defying Triple H's warning to walk with caution! But 'the People's Champ' wasn't alone, bringing a steel chair with him! The Rock immediately talked business, telling that he hears Triple H and Stephanie loud and clear, to not mess with the McMahon-Helmsley regime - but while the Rock heard and understood that, what he didn't understand was Stephanie's frustrations with Chris Jericho: for speaking the words that every single man, woman and child knew about Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley! Rock continued his tirade talking about Triple H crying about Rock finding himself a bloodied mess - but 'the Brahma Bull' is standing here loud and clear telling the McMahon-Helmsley regime to just bring it! Triple H shrugged, telling Rock that he didn't know what Vince McMahon had in mind for him tonight, but in the mean time - he ordered X-Pac and Road Dogg out here! D-Generation X snuck up behind the Rock, clubbing away at the Rock! But Rock gave X-Pac a right hand, then picked up his steel chair, frightening off DX! Rock told Triple H he would have to try with all of his might to take the Rock down! But what was the absent Chairman planning for the Rock tonight?\n\nEddie Guerrero and his newfound 'Mamacita' Chyna were seen walking the halls backstage, as 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' clutched her back. The WWF European Champion asked her how her back was doing following being locked in the Walls of Jericho last week, to which she commented that she'd be fine - 'Latino Heat' had to focus on Rikishi Phatu tonight.\n\nAl Snow and Steve Blackman made their way down the rampway where tonight, they'd be challenging for the WWF Tag Team Championship. A replay aired, showing 'the Lethal Weapon' being coerced into performing stand-up comedy at the Sunny Days Residential Home this past Thursday on Smackdown!, where it was implied that Blackman got mad with the boos he received from the seniors, and pulled out his nunchucks. Edge and Christian followed, the WWF Tag Team Champions uncharacteristically entering down the rampway - but Christian told Snow and Blackman that the people in Fort Lauderdale didn't deserve to see them put their titles on the line! He called Snow a goof, and that he had more charisma in his little finger than Blackman had in his entire body! Edge told the \"hosers\" in the ring that they weren't getting a WWF Tag Team Championship shot, but they would show them who the supreme fighting tag team was in the World Wrestling Federation, right now!\n\n1) Edge and Christian def. Al Snow and Steve Blackman in a non-title match (2:56)\n\nAl Snow has been attempting to teach Steve Blackman about how to entertain the people, but it was clear that performing stand-up comedy to seniors was not the right way to go about it. Edge and Christian meanwhile continued to show their brash true colors, refusing to even put the WWF Tag Team Championships on the line against Snow and Blackman. This motivated 'the Lethal Weapon', who went on the attack and caused Edge to bail early. Snow almost scored the win off of a sit-out spinebuster on Christian, but Edge came from behind clocking Snow with a dropkick which allowed Christian to deliver a reverse DDT for the win!\n\nEdge and Christian were successful in defeating Al Snow and Steve Blackman tonight, but the WWF Tag Team Champions eagerly escaped an irritated 'Lethal Weapon', bailing to the floor! The Canadian brothers high-fived following the win, but the Dudley Boyz suddenly came from behind attacking Edge and Christian! Edge and Christian tried to flee the scene, while D-Von and Bubba Ray clearly had the titles still in their line of sight.\n\nHardcore Holly was taping his wrists in the backstage area when Crash Holly was seen sneaking around. Hardcore blurted out that he could tell the WWF Hardcore Champion was there. In fact, he was lucky that he didn't have a referee with him. Crash apologized to Hardcore for how things turned out, but he really wanted to help Hardcore in his match out there tonight. He didn't want the Holly Cousins to have strained relations. Holly shook his head, telling Crash to get lost.\n\nThe Rock was seen in his dressing room stomping back and forth, 'the Brahma Bull' ready for anything with a chair grasped in hand! With no sight of Vince McMahon still, who knew what was in store for 'the People's Champ'.\n\nIn the locker room the Big Bossman swizzled his nightstick around when talking with Bull Buchanan, saying how they weren't taking any of the Acolytes' shtick tonight. Bossman said that they were the enforcers, they were the ones in charge. And tonight they were going to finish what they started last week by leaving 'the Big Red Machine' down and defenceless. Buchanan uttered that justice would be served. But who would be their partner in the six-man tag team match tonight?\n\nKurt Angle made his way down to the ring for action against the Godfather, the Olympic Gold Medalist grinning despite a rocky week last week. With a microphone in hand Angle talked about the state of Florida and how they didn't share the same morals as most of the United States. But that's okay, because \"their\" 'Olympic Hero' was here to show them the importance of abstinence! Angle talked about the pros of practicing abstinence from sex which - unlike his opponent tonight - he practiced every single day. Kurt recommended trying it, saying that if they were lucky, they could be half the man that he was!\n\n2) Kurt Angle def. The Godfather (w/Hos)\n\nThe Olympic Gold Medalist was coming off the heels of losing the WWF Intercontinental and European Championships at WrestleMania, and a win tonight against the Godfather could do just the trick, putting Angle back in his winning ways. 'The Pimp Daddy' appeared preoccupied by showing off his lovely Hos at ringside, and had Fort Lauderdale strongly behind him much to the chagrin of the supporter of abstinence, Kurt Angle. Godfather had Angle right where he wanted him up until a legdrop off the second rope, and Angle attempted the crossface chickenwing on 'the Pimp Daddy'. Godfather was too big and powerful, backing him up into the corner which allowed Godfather to attempt the Ho Train - just to miss it and back up into the Olympic Slam!\n\nKurt Angle had beaten the Godfather, and as the Olympic Gold Medalist celebrated, three of the Godfather's Hos approached 'the Olympic Hero' to congratulate him on the win. Angle looked appalled to be in their presence, and quickly left the ring to celebrate by himself. Practicing abstinence may in fact be the recipe that made Kurt Angle the athlete that he was!\n\nIn the parking lot Vince and Shane McMahon were spotted stepping out of a limousine, Shane blaming Fort Lauderdale for having a terrible traffic system. Shane said that this place stunk, complaining that they'd been stuck in traffic for the past hour! The WWF Chairman wasn't so tough on Florida however, commenting that tonight Fort Lauderdale was the place where they would see 'the People's Champion' subjugated!\n\nEarlier today The Kat was seen eating a salad in her dressing room, when Terri entered the room to apologize to the Kat for how things have been between them. Terri said that she hasn't been a good person and wanted her to know that so that they could be friends. Terri turned her attention to the publicity that their Catfight from WrestleMania has given them, to which Kat spoke ecstatically about how little her phone had been off the hook. Terri told Kat that she had a surprise for her, inviting the Kat on a spa day! Kat happily accepted, as it seemed that the beef between the Kat and Terri had been squashed.\n\n3) Viscera def. Hardcore Holly (1:48)\n\nHardcore Holly was, seven days ago, the WWF Hardcore Champion. But it was 'the Human Suplex Machine' Tazz that could arguably be at fault for costing him the title, when none other than Hardcore's own cousin Crash Holly pinned him for the title. Since then, relations between the Hollys have been strained, with Hardcore wanting to regain the title his cousin holds - whereas Crash wanted nothing more than to recover his relationship with Hardcore. Viscera was tough to knock off of his feet early, as Hardcore clobbered him, but the 500-pound monster took him down with a sidewalk slam. Things looked dire for Hardcore when Crash ran down to the apron, distracting Viscera. Hardcore came from behind and foolishly tried to power Viscera up for a slam, but Viscera squashed Holly to take the match.\n\nViscera had beaten Hardcore Holly, but Crash Holly quickly got into the ring, nailing the monster with a stop sign! It bent over Viscera's head, but it didn't seem to harm him in the slightest, as Viscera clotheslined Crash and covered him - the referee counting - but Hardcore took the stop sign and slammed it twice on the large back of the 500-pounder! Holly continued batter Viscera while Crash recovered, saw the intensity in his cousin's eyes and fled the ring! Hardcore followed suit, chasing the WWF Hardcore Champion up the rampway!\n\nVince McMahon was speaking with his son Shane, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, as the WWF Chairman soon began making his way up the corridor - it seemed as though the boss was heading to the ring.\n\nWWF Hardcore Champion Crash Holly was rushing up the halls away from his older cousin Hardcore Holly, as it seemed Hardcore was blaming his cousin for costing him the match with Viscera moments ago. Crash tried to apologize to Hardcore, but Tazz came from behind, locking the Tazzmission in on Crash! Tazz had a referee with him to check on Crash, when Hardcore blasted Tazz with a right hand! 'The Human Suplex Machine' and Hardcore Holly went at it, allowing Crash to cradle away from the scene, taking his title with him!\n\nIn the National Car Rental Arena Vince McMahon marched down to the ring to loud boos from the capacity crowd in Fort Lauderdale, as the Chairman was ready to address the Rock as to what he had in store for him tonight. Vince spoke of how great it was to be here in such a foul place, commenting that the traffic stinks, the food stinks, and - quite frankly - the people stink! But alas all is forgiven, because tonight is the night that the Rock will meet his end! He talked about his history with the Rock, how he was once close to the Rock and it was Vincent Kennedy McMahon who made 'the People's Champ' the man he is today! But that doesn't change the fact that he is not suitable to be World Wrestling Federation Champion - no way near! Vince talked about facing the Rock last week on RAW is WAR, and how he saw the hunger in his eyes. But by last Thursday on SmackDown! that luck of hunger was dying down, and he watched it up close when Rock struggled against D-Generation X! McMahon said that 'the Brahma Bull' was not the man everybody thought he was, and that tonight he planned to prove it!\n\nThe Rock once again interrupted the Chairman, as 'the People's Champ' continued to hold tight of the steel chair he had with him earlier tonight. Vince attempted to tell the Rock he wasn't finished, but Rock told Vince that he had heard enough of the talking. He had heard it from all different sides of the story - from the biggest assh*le alive today Triple H, to his sl*t of a wife Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. The Rock knew what he was in for, and like he told Triple H earlier tonight, he wanted Vince McMahon to go ahead and give him another obstacle, so that he could conquer whatever he threw at the Rock, and go on to face Triple H for the WWF Championship! The people chanted Rocky's name in his home state, as Vince laughed telling Rock that he would be surprised if Rock could even get past tonight. He suggested that Rock prepare himself, because he wasn't going to name his opponents - though he was going to tell him that Rock's match would be held inside of the steel cage hanging above the ring tonight! And in the interest of fairness, in the unlikelihood that Rock manages to survive the steel cage match tonight, he would give the Rock the opportunity to face Triple H for the WWF Championship one more time! Rock told Vince that he was the lousiest, dumbest son of a gun going today - and when it's all said and done, after tonight was through and the Rock was victorious, he would take his bastard son-in-law and take him to school, wall to wall inside of that steel cage! The stipulation was named and the match was announced - but who was the Rock's opponent gonna be?\n\nBack live on RAW is WAR, Chris Jericho made his way down the rampway to a loud ovation, as Y2J prepared to take on Road Dogg - a relatiation from Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley - after Jericho insulted the boss's daughter last Thursday night on SmackDown! Jericho welcomed Fort Lauderdale to RAW is Jericho, before talking about what Triple H and Stephanie had to say about him earlier tonight. Jericho commented that he may have lost to Chyna on SmackDown!, but at least he wasn't banging boots with the biggest bottom-feeding, disgusting trash-bag ho walking planet Earth today! Jericho stood in the ring as he told Stephanie that he knew the McMahon-Helmsley regime were watching, because when he breaks the Walls down on Road Dogg tonight, he wants them to know that he's dedicating this match to Stephanie!\n\n4) Chris Jericho def. Road Dogg (w/X-Pac and Tori) by disqualification (5:25)\n\nChris Jericho did not seem apologetic about what he had to say about Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley last Thursday night on SmackDown!, but Road Dogg was about to try and have his way with Y2J, to make Jericho \"get with the program\". Road Dogg talked trash as he pounded on Jericho early, but the young Canadian fired back; 'the Millennium Man' not taking anything Road Dogg threw at him. X-Pac and Tori got involved on two occasions, with Jericho becoming distracted and getting jumped by Road Dogg. Later, Tori got on the apron to distracted Y2J and wound up getting liplocked by Jericho! It was enough to anger X-Pac, and just when Jericho had Road Dogg in the Walls of Jericho, X-Pac hit the ring, a roundhouse kick taking Y2J down!\n\nThe crowd booed loudly as Chris Jericho had the boots given to him by X-Pac, who was extremely unhappy with Jericho's blatant disrespect of his girlfriend Tori tonight! Road Dogg recovered and joined in on the torment - whilst Triple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were seen watching in their office - X-Pac leaving Jericho down and out following the X-Factor! D-Generation X left with their heads held high, and Y2J was feeling the consequences of insulting anybody associated with the McMahon-Helmsley regime!\n\nEdge and Christian were in the locker room, the WWF Tag Team Champions unhappy with how they were treated by the Dudley Boyz earlier tonight. Edge commented that he found Christian's comment about Steve Blackman's charisma funny, saying it even fit D-Von and Bubba Ray like a glove. Christian mocked the way Bubba looks when he drives a woman through a table, to which Edge laughed at. The champs were interrupted by the arrival of the Hardy Boyz, who confronted Edge and Christian - Matt telling them that they weren't finished with them by a long shot. Christian spoke up, telling Jeff and Matt that they had their shot and they blew it. They didn't deserve a thing! Edge told the Hardys that if they wanted to get in the good books of E&C, they had to do something for them - and that was handle the Dudleys.\n\nThe six-man tag team bout loomed near, as Kane was seen with Paul Bearer by his side. 'The Big Red Machine' adjusted his gloved hand, when the Acolytes showed up to talk with the two men. Bradshaw, Faarooq, Kane and Bearer were headed for the ring to face the Big Bossman, Bull Buchanan and whoever their partner of choice is - next!\n\nThe Kat had accepted the invitation of Terri, as earlier today they were seen enjoying cocktails at an exclusive salon in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Terri and Kat discussed the highlights of their stay thus far, when Terri introduced Kat to her close friend, a stylist who appeared glad to assist Kat in giving her a makeover. Kat sipped the last of her drink, to which Terri took to give her a re-fill - but whilst Kat talked to the stylist about her hair, Terri could be seen putting some sort of powder in Kat's drink!\n\n5) Big Show, Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan def. Kane and the Acolytes (4:38)\n\nDespite the recent personality switch of the Big Show, as he attempts to capitalize on recent fame by showing off how versatile a performer he could be, tonight 'the Big Nasty B*stard' was back as the mystery partner of the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan, in the latest installment of their obsession with trying to expose Kane as somebody that is beatable. Bradshaw and Faarooq were hard hitting in their shots at the Georgia prison guards, but when 'the Big Red Machine' came in, so did the Big Show - and the two giants faced off. They exchanged words when Bossman and Buchanan jumped Kane, which Show did not appreciate. Bradshaw took the tag, and Show angrily ducked a Clothesline From Hell, giving the Texan a Showstopper for the win.\n\nThe Big Show scored another victory in tonight's six-man tag team bout, but he did not seem as pleased as his partners for the night, Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan over the moon about defeating the Acolytes tonight on RAW is WAR. They went back to putting the boots on 'the Big Red Machine', when Show suddenly shoved Bossman back, which caused Bossman to shove Show in return! This did not go down well, as Show grabbed Bossman by the throat and ousted him with a Showstopper! Buchanan tried to attack Show, but Show in turn dropped him with a Showstopper for his own troubles.\n\nWWF Women's Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley was talking with Tori in the hallway, when Jacqueline appeared much to the annoyance of the boss's daughter. Jackie told Stephanie that she may have beaten her for the title two weeks ago, but their business wasn't over yet. Jacqueline brought up how she won a number one contender's match last night on HeAT, and she demanded her match! McMahon-Helmsley appeared threatened, telling Tori that although she was a fighting champion and much like her husband, open to any challenge: she was still feeling the effects of the Rock's heinous beating of her at WrestleMania! Stephanie then told Jackie that if she wanted a match, she could face Tori this Thursday night on SmackDown! Jacqueline told Steph that she wasn't surprised, then faced off with Tori, commenting that she was going to beat her so bad, her boyfriend X-Pac would feel it.\n\nT&A were in the locker room talking to Trish Stratus, as Test and Albert listened to what their business manager was saying about being a team and how she wanted T&A to teach everybody the respect that she deserves. In walked Vince McMahon, the Chairman appearing happy to see the hot blonde and her men. Vince wanted to have a word with the trio, but what about?\n\nEdge and Christian were still complaining about their luck tonight, almost having to put the WWF Tag Team Championship on the line against those \"pinheads\" Steve Blackman and Al Snow, but then being confronted by the Hardy Boyz? Edge said Jeff must have lost the last of his brain cells in the Triangle Ladder match at WrestleMania, because they are the champions! Christian commented they deserved better treatment. The Dudley Boyz overheard them, and Bubba Ray Dudley did not seem happy to hear that. D-Von said that they were the champs - but that meant there was now a huge target on their backs and they wanted the gold! Edge and Christian told the Dudleys to go back to putting themselves through tables - but if they wanted to do something good, this Thursday night on SmackDown! they could earn their spot, by taking out the Hardy Boyz! Edge referenced how the Hardys beat them at their own game in the tables match at Royal Rumble - how about a little payback? The champs left - full of themselves - leaving D-Von and Bubba to contemplate their comments.\n\n6) Rikishi Phatu def. Eddie Guerrero (w/Chyna) (c) by disqualification; Eddie retains the WWF European Championship (4:15)\n\nWhile Chyna was recovering from her spinal injury caused by Chris Jericho this past Thursday on SmackDown!, her new boyfriend had his hands full tonight when he had to put the WWF European Championship on the line against Rikishi. 'Latino Heat' helped her 'Mamacita' to ringside before attempting to engage with the 400-pound Samoan - Rikishi easily squashing Eddie's attempts at lifting him early on. Guerrero had to resort to a more agile style, but Rikishi quickly managed to squat him out of the air with a big clothesline! Guerrero tried to recover in the corner, but Rikishi backed it up and attempted the Stinkface! Guerrero was in trouble and he knew it, which is when Eddie kicked Rikishi low out of desperation!\n\nBy the skin of his teeth, 'Latino Heat' had retained the WWF European Championship and avoided the threat of the Stinkface, as Eddie was handed the title by 'Mamacita' at ringside - Eddie looking to swing for Rikishi's head - but Phatu ducked the shot and superkicked Eddie down! Guerrero fell into the corner, as Chyna looked on helpless from ringside! Rikishi backed it up and gave Eddie the Stinkface of a lifetime, whilst 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' charged to aid her boyfriend! Rikishi danced, not as such unhappy by the disqualification victory, but more happy he had gotten to back that ass up tonight on RAW is WAR!\n\nThe Radicalz were in their locker room, Chris Benoit, Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko discussing the strange relationship between their buddy Eddie Guerrero and 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' Chyna. Saturn simply said that he was happy everybody in the Radicalz had gold - Benoit was the WWF Intercontinental Champion; Eddie was WWF European Champion; and Malenko was the WWF Light Heavyweight Champion. But maybe he needed some gold around his waist, too. In walked Vince McMahon, the Chairman asking the Radicalz if they had a minute. What was the Chairman talking to the WWF Superstars about?\n\nElsewhere the Rock - armed with the steel chair - left his locker room! 'The People's Champ' was making his way for a Steel-Cage match that the Chairman had put him in tonight: but who was the Rock's opponent? Would Rock be able to overcome the odds and earn himself another shot at the WWF Championship?\n\nReturning to earlier today at the salon, the Kat was seen passed out in the barber's chair, as Terri told Kat to wake up and see herself. The Kat was made up with heavy eye shadow and thick red lipstick, and the word \"sl*t\" was enscripted on her forehead - but above all - her hair was a cut up mess! Terri showed Kat her reflection in mirror as she came around, causing Kat to scream! Terri laughed evilly, having humiliated the Kat well and truly! It was all a set up in return for WrestleMania!\n\nIn the National Car Rental Arena the steel cage was in the process of being lowered, and the Rock made his way out to an enormous ovation! 'The People's Champ' was still armed with a steel chair, as he was set for a Steel-Cage match in tonight's main event - but he had no idea who his opponent was going to be! The Rock stepped into the cage, where he paced back and forth when Vince McMahon's music hit! The WWF Chairman marched onto the rampway, where he stood with his son Shane - the crowd booing McMahon loudly. Vince told Rock that he had given it some thought, and he had in fact granted Rock a rematch with Triple H for the WWF Championship: if he can manage to overcome the odds. Vince introduced his opponent: the WWF Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit! 'The Canadian Crippler' stepped out and Rock was ready for the challenge - but Vince told Chris to hang on, because his tag team partners tonight would be none other than T&A! A three-on-one handicap match in the Cage, how could the Rock overcome this?\n\n7) The Rock def. WWF Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit and T&A (w/Trish Stratus) in a Steel-Cage match (6:01)\n\nVince McMahon was full of it, himself and Shane McMahon joining commentary for this match. The Rock had twice competed in handicap matches this past week, and this was his third and unarguably his toughest in facing three WWF Superstars. The submission machine Chris Benoit, and the dominant combination of Test and Albert was going to be a lot for Rock to overcome, especially if he wanted another shot at the WWF Championship like Vince McMahon had promised. Rock used the steel chair on T&A, but the numbers game was too much, and quickly it became a prolonged beatdown of 'the People's Champ'! The McMahons talked brashly as Benoit gave him German Suplex after German Suplex, whereas T&A took pleasure in hurling Rock into the cage walls repeatedly. But Rock wouldn't give up yet, as 'the Brahma Bull' delivered a DDT to Test on the chair, before sending Albert into the cage himself! Benoit looked for the Crippler Crossface, but Rock sent him down and used the steel chair when Rock began to look for the doors - Shane inexplicably leaving commentary to join in on the action! It was now four-on-one, when Rock gave Shane a flurry of right hands, knocking him out through the door he came! Rock started climbing the cage instead, when Benoit tried to prevent escape - Rock and Benoit going blow for blow on the top rope - but Rock sent Benoit into the steel and Chris collapsed back into the ring! Rock was on top of the cage and climbed down - but Road Dogg and X-Pac showed up! Triple H walked down the ramp, as Rock decided to drop down anyway, winning the match!\n\nThe Rock had miraculously overcome what became a four-on-one handicap Steel-Cage match tonight to grant him another shot at the WWF Championship, but X-Pac and Road Dogg went right to work on Rock! Rock tried to fight them off, when Triple H slammed the WWF title into the head of 'the Brahma Bull'! DX put the boots to Rock, before tossing him back to the wolves in the ring: T&A and Benoit putting the boots to Rock as well! Shane directed traffic whilst Vince was happier than ever on commentary! It was a collective beatdown of the Rock, but Chris Jericho charged down to the ring! Y2J grabbed a steel chair and stepped inside, nailing Benoit and Road Dogg - but the numbers game was too much for him! Triple H delivered a Pedigree to Y2J, when Rock attacked Triple H! Shane low-blowed Rock from behind, which allowed 'the Game' to drop the Rock with a powerful Pedigree, leaving Rock bloody on the canvas! Triple H knelt over his rival, telling Rock that the World Wrestling Federation Championship belonged to him - and maybe it did, but you had to believe there would be hell to pay come Thursday night on SmackDown!\n\nPost by DTP. on\n\nSmackDown! - April 13, 2000\n\nThe Ice Palace in Tampa, Florida\n\nBroadcast on UPN\n\nTaped April 11, 2000\n\nSmackDown! kicked things off with a recap of what went down this past Monday on RAW is WAR, where Vince McMahon decided to stack the deck once again against the Rock, offering him a shot at the WWF Championship if he could overcome the odds of a mystery opponent inside of a Steel-Cage. The opponent turned out to be three, as Rock had to beat Test, Albert and Chris Benoit. Rock was miraculously able to win the match, but found himself - and Chris Jericho - the recipient of a mass beatdown courtesy of D-Generation X, the Radicalz and T&A. The McMahon-Helmsley regime was growing thanks to the powers that be's connections.\n\nThe opening video package brought us to the sold out Ice Palace in Tampa, Florida where Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler welcomed us to SmackDown! although Triple H and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were wasting no time making their way to the ring. The World Wrestling Federation Champion and his wife were all smiles tonight following their successful beatdown of the Rock this past Monday, and Triple H immediately started by addressing how the Rock went down, and that the regime's plan had gone according to plan! Triple H claimed that he wasn't about to deny Rock of another shot at his gold, because if there was one thing he couldn't deny was how much he loved to humiliate the Rock at his own game! 'The Game' talked about Rock being a deadman, and said that at Backlash the date was set - April 30 in Washington, DC, the Rock would meet his maker when 'the Game' shows exactly how good he is!\n\nStephanie noted to her husband that Rock wasn't the only man that faced their own consequences this past Monday, which brought them to Chris Jericho. Stephanie said that you didn't talk about a McMahon - especially her, the \"billion dollar princess\" - like that. She called Y2J a pest that needed eliminating, and after RAW went down the way it did, perhaps it would be wiser for Jericho to stay the hell out of the McMahon-Helmsley regime's business! Triple H told Steph not to worry however, because he's certain Chris Jericho got the message loud and clear. Not to mention, he's got bigger things to concern himself with when he faces X-Pac later tonight.\n\nBut despite these comments, Chris Jericho made his way out to the stage! Y2J was met with a loud reaction, as he demanded Triple H and Stephanie to shut the hell up. Jericho talked about how there was a paradigm shift in the World Wrestling Federation, and no he wasn't talking about how high Steph's thong was riding right now, nor was he talking about how Triple H's ego was bigger than his nose! He was referring to the rebellion that was going on, and on the front-line was not just the Rock, but Y2J Chris Jericho as well. Triple H asked Jericho if he got a concussion when he planted him with a Pedigree on RAW is WAR, because he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. H ironically spoke of how Jericho runs his mouth so much, it was just a matter of time until he found himself paying for his big mouth, but Jericho responded claiming that he heard that's what he heard Stephanie does every night!\n\nBut Y2J was serious in saying that although Rock and he got their asses beaten down on Monday, it took nine guys to hold them down, and dared Triple H to give X-Pac the night off, because he wanted Triple H! The fans erupted, and Triple H laughed at the idea but told Y2J that as much fun it would be to beat his ass one more time tonight, he already has a match tonight - in fact - he was putting the WWF Championship on the line tonight so he would have to pass. Y2J smirked at the obvious white lie, but then told Hunter that upon further consideration, maybe he didn't need a WWF Championship match to face him - maybe he could come down to the ring right now! Jericho charged to the ring, but Triple H and Stephanie wisely exited the ring, with 'the Game' brandishing a big smile on his face! 'The Game' was playing mind games, and Jericho grinned back at him: but who was Triple H putting the WWF Championship on the line against tonight?\n\nVince and Shane McMahon were seen on a couch in their dressing room, where the WWF Chairman talked about the poise of the WWF Champion Triple H. He didn't need to put the title on the line in this scummy city they call Tampa, but he is! Vince claimed the Rock wouldn't do something like that. Shane told his father that he was excited for Backlash, because he knew 'the Game' would be triumphant, and Rock would learn that the McMahon-Helmsley regime ran the World Wrestling Federation!\n\nEddie Guerrero and his 'Mamacita' Chyna were en route to the ring as SmackDown! returned, the WWF European Champion not having a very good week thus far following a Stinkface from Rikishi Phatu on RAW three nights ago. 'Latino Heat' took to the microphone upon entering the ring, talking about how disgusting and disrespectful Rikishi was. Eddie said that he was still picking up the scent of the Samoan's disgusting rear end, and did not appreciate the WWF European Champion one bit! Eddie claimed Rikishi wasn't a man of culture, he wasn't even European! 'The Ninth Wonder of the World' added that Phatu was a monster for trying to ruin her 'Latino Heat's face. She claimed that he was jealous because the truth was 'Latino Heat' was much sexier than Rikishi could ever dream of being! Fired up, Eddie demanded Rikishi get down here for their match.\n\n1) WWF European Champion Eddie Guerrero & Chyna def. Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi (3:58)\n\nRikishi Phatu lost his shot at the WWF European Championship when Eddie Guerrero kicked him low on RAW is WAR, but he got his retribution in the fashion of giving 'Latino Heat' the Stinkface after the match. But this just made Eddie hot, and he took to hammering on the Samoan as the bell sounded, but the 400-pounder was easily able to diffuse Eddie using his size before tagging in Scotty 2 Hotty. With Grandmaster Sexay on the bench, this make-shift variation of Too Cool were effective in teaming up against Guerrero, but Chyna was the equalizer that clubbed Scotty and allowed 'Mamacita' to take control. Despite the couple's best efforts, Scotty got the tag to Rikishi and he ran wild with a Samoan drop to Guerrero, before bum-rushing Chyna in the corner, causing 'the Ninth Wonder of the World' to drop down in the corner! Rikishi planned the Stinkface for 'Mamacita', but while Scotty was with the referee, Eddie came in with a shot from the European title belt! Guerrero placed his girlfriend on top of Rikishi, scoring a big win tonight!\n\nEddie Guerrero was able to save his 'Mamacita' Chyna in tag team action tonight, gaining a measure of revenge for the Stinkface on RAW this past week - 'Latino Heat' hugging onto his trusty WWF European Championship, when Chyna roped Eddie into a huge kiss of relief! Scotty 2 Hotty attended to Rikishi, the Samoan none too happy about the loss.\n\nKevin Kelly was backstage with the Big Show, Kevin wanting to get a word with 'the Big Nasty B*stard' about his recent change of course this past few weeks. Big Show told Kevin that he was a new man. He just wanted to have more fun, and that ever since he's started to have more fun in the ring, he has become a serious hit - not just with potential business associates - but the ladies too! Show smiled, but his demeanor changed when Kane showed up. Accompanied by Paul Bearer, 'the Big Red Machine' mutely faced off with Show when Paul asked Show to team up with Kane tonight against the Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan! Show smiled as he nodded in agreement, the two giants parting ways. The guards were in trouble tonight!\n\nShane McMahon was in the corridor with WWF Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit back from the break, Shane telling 'the Canadian Crippler' that what he and the Radicalz did last Monday was phenomenal, and Benoit was fantastic in his role. Shane advised Chris that if the Radicalz remained allies with the McMahon-Helmsley regime, then more rewards would come their way. Benoit told Shane that it felt great making the Rock rive in pain in the cage on RAW is WAR, but he wasn't happy. Benoit told Shane that he wanted the Rock, all to himself tonight! Shane smiled, nodding his head and telling Chris that he asked and shall receive. Benoit vowed to make Rock squeal in the Crossface.\n\n2) Crash Holly (c) def. Perry Saturn to retain the WWF Hardcore Championship (4:41)\n\nWith the Holly Cousins seemingly falling apart by the week, Crash Holly was out to defend the WWF Hardcore Championship tonight against Perry Saturn, the sole member of the Radicalz without a championship to his name. It was noted that Saturn received this opportunity due to the Radicalz's part played in the Rock's dismantling on RAW is WAR, and Saturn proved how hardcore he could be by suplexing Crash through a trash can, and almost scoring the win after a dropkick into a trash can held by Crash. When Crash appeared to be in trouble while Saturn held a lead pipe, Hardcore Holly hit the ring and it seemed as though Crash was in dire trouble, but Hardcore instead clotheslined Saturn and delivered the Falcon Arrow! Hardcore glared at an intimidated Crash, then demanded his cousin cover him - and Crash complied, nervously covering for three!\n\nCrash Holly timidly returned to his feet, not turning his back to his older cousin for a second. Hardcore Holly continued to stare at him, but then raised Crash's hand in victory! Hardcore even handed Crash the WWF Hardcore Championship, congratulating him on the title win! Hardcore left, leaving Crash incredibly confused by the sudden revelation that Hardcore was on his side. But with the 24/7 rule looming, who knew who Crash could truly trust.\n\nThe Dudley Boyz were in the locker room, where Bubba Ray stroked a table. D-Von talked about how it had been three long months since the Royal Rumble, where they lost a Tables match to the Hardy Boyz. He preached that they had waited by for far too long, but tonight was their time! It was time for Jeff and Matt to get some wood, and when it was all said and done, the Dudley Boyz would regain the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bubba was in the zone, telling D-Von that he would get his fix, and the Hardys were going down and - after that - so were Edge and Christian. The Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan entered the scene, Bossman telling the Dudleys that they didn't understand. Bossman told them that bad things happened to good people, and when they were done with Kane and the Big Show, they wanted the gold themselves. Bubba and D-Von squared up to them, daring them to try, but Bossman and Buchanan decided to leave instead - the prison guards face Kane and Big Show next!\n\n3) Kane and Big Show (w/Paul Bearer) def. Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan (3:19)\n\nThe Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan had just had some stern words with the Dudley Boyz about their quest for the WWF Tag Team Championship, but they had unfinished business with the Big Show, and most importantly Kane. This past Monday night after a six-man tag action against Kane and the Acolytes with Bossman and Buchanan as his partner, Show found himself unsatisfied with his partnership and laid waste to the prison guards - which prompted Kane to ask Show to team up with him for this match tonight. Bossman and Buchanan went right to work on Kane, but struggled when it came to the Big Show. Show had more flair to his moves tonight, jiving with every chop he planted into the thick chest of Buchanan. Soon enough Bossman and Buchanan figured they couldn't fight fairly - attempting to bring their nightsticks into the equation - but "
