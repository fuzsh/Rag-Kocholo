        "text": "Though credited as the ringmasters of American television, many acclaimed producers often face the question as to how they create the pizazz of the finished product; or, how exactly they produce the magic that forces every American to search for a greater meaning just beyond the surface of a screen box. Well, the Founder and CEO of 3 Ball Productions, creator of The Biggest Loser and East alumnus JD Roth (’86) has an answer: hard work.\n\nAt the young age of ten years old, Roth impersonated his father, a local attorney, on the phone, hoping to land an audition at a Sunday showcase in New York City. Not only did he get the gig, but Roth got his big break, alongside Sarah Jessica Parker and Ricky Lake, who were also cast for the part.\n\nRoth said, “There wasn’t much kid talent [back then]. So, I really had to navigate my way to figure out how to do it. No one in the area had really done anything like that, and no one really knew how.”\n\nRoth booked 22 national commercials within his first year of acting, setting a child acting record still yet to be broken. Since his career continued to skyrocket, as the years ticked by, it would only make sense that Roth’s highs school years were rather eccentric compared to the average teen. In fact, Roth first arrived at East four months into the school year because he had been working on a film in South Africa. His school day finished at 12:50 p.m. so that he could catch the 1:50 bus to New York City, where he either spent the day working or going on auditions. During his sophomore year, Roth got both the starring role in the play “Joseph and The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” and a position on the boys JV basketball team; however, he was forced to sacrifice both opportunities when he snagged the once-in-a-lifetime spot on “Star Search,” a Hollywood television bonanza where young actors competed in various entertainment genres.\n\nRoth’s most revered East teacher, Ed Canzanese, a retired basketball coach, offered him a final ultimatum: “Are you going to [play] basketball or are you going to Hollywood?” To Roth, the answer was clear.\n\nAfter graduation, Roth found the defining moment of his acting career: “Fun House,” a kids’ television game show. As the jolly host of a show that edged its way to the number-one kids’ show in America within the snap of a finger, Roth could not go anywhere without excited aficionados or general public recognition.\n\n“It was a big defining moment not only in my career, but in all the hard work that I had put in. You know, it sounds easy. But every day going to school and getting on the bus, then going to New York, then homework , then [I’d] get home at eight or nine o’ clock, and then [I’d] wake up and have to do it all over again,” Roth said.\n\nHowever wonderful the “Fun House” experience had been, Roth moved on to producing some new ones.\n\nRoth said, “I realized that it was great to be a part of the on-camera talent, but on-camera talent doesn’t last forever. What lasts is creativity.”\n\nRoth commenced a new path with his newly acquired production company, 3 Ball Productions. “Moolah Beach,” the first show the company ever sold, created the foundation of “Endurance,” the number-one kids’ show on the Discovery Kids channel for six years. Both shows’ essential focus was to disconnect teenagers from electronics that daily impede on their communication skills and social interactions.\n\n“Too many kids hide behind electronics in their life, which creates a distance between [them] and other human beings. It stops interacting with other people. When you look someone in the eye, shake your head and acknowledge that they’ve heard you, you lose all those little nuances in human interaction,” said Roth.\n\nAiring in 30 countries, it is safe to say that “The Biggest Loser” can officially be deemed a global sensation. Though, it may seem perplexing that the initial response to the television pitch was anything but optimistic. Roth said, “The guy from the network said, ‘Watching people lose weight could be like watching paint dry. How are you going to make that interesting TV?’”\n\nRoth responded, “When the emotions start to stir inside someone, and they realize what they’ve lost. The fact that they’re trying to get [that part of themselves] back will create a story.”\n\nDuring the show’s first season, reverence for its cause remained a tough nut to crack. Roth could not find one restaurant in Los Angeles that was willing to let him film the contestants. They were embarrassed; it was that plain and overwhelmingly blunt. So Roth paid a 5,000 dollar rental fee to paint the corner of a restaurant a different color, to film an episode without any shots of the entrance. Five years later, during the eighth season, the contestants picked vegetables and fruit out of President Barack Obama’s garden, and were invited to dine at the White House dinner table.\n\nRoth said, “That shows you that in just a five-year time span how you can change a conversation. How you can inspire people so much, that it ends up affecting the President of the United States.”\n\nWith a truly priceless ingenuity, Roth validates that any contemporary Ben Franklin can produce the magic of his or her own future with the proper mindset. “There’s one thing in life that I can’t teach. I can teach how to tell a story, how to edit, how to shoot a camera. I can’t teach passion,” Roth said.\n\nRoth is living proof that stardom is more than just a scotch hop away; but what he ultimately represents is that with the proper mindset and tenacious passion, the world can be anyone’s oyster."
