Includes a letter by E.A. Womack, Postmaster, Chattanooga, Tn., dated 25 August 1913, on the death of his Grandfather from his memory as a young boy. This same letter appeared in the Chattanooga Daily News 25 August 1913.\n\nTHE AFRO-AMERICAN COMMUNITY by Lillard pages 117, 118 & 119. Recorded from Meigs County Library, Meigs County, Tn. 23 February 1982. A letter by E.A. Womack of East Chattanooga to the CHATTANOOGA NEWS (August 25, 1913) records a violent but limited slave revolt at the Big Springs Community during the early years of the Civil War. The writer of the letter was a boy of six years when his grandfather Jacob Womack was murdered by two of his slaves on the eve of September 23, 1862. Jacob Womack had been born May 1, 1799, in Virginia; he immigrated to the Big Springs section of Meigs County (then Rhea County) about two miles north of the Hiwassee River. In this agrarian setting Womack owned several slaves and operated a blacksmith shop on his plantation. Underneath the stones of hearth in the black-smith shop, Jacob hid his gold coins. On the tragic September evening, about sundown, Jim and Kit, slaves of Jacob Womack attacked their owner on the south side of the Big Spring Branch, about one quarter mile from the Womack house and 400 yards from the blacksmith shop. Jim initiated the attack and forced Kit to help him accomplish the deed of cutting Womack's throat from ear to ear with a butcher knife. Then the murdered man's thumbs were cut off the hands. To conceal the body, Jim and Kit dragged it 300 yards southeast and placed it under three logs. Then, the rebellious slaves fed the hogs where Womack's blood had been spilled until \"hardly a sign could be detected on the ground.\" After dark, the slaves moved the body again, this time taking it one quarter mile southesast to a thicket of bushes near a small spring. Finally, John and Kit moved the body before sunlight on the 24th September, this time to the edge of Agency Creek placing the body under a drift, small boat,where it remained until one of the negro slaves who knew of the murder pointed out the hiding place. When the body was found and it was brought back to the Womack plantation house in a common two-horse wagon. The body had remained underwater for about twelve hours. Jacob Womack's wife was not at home; she was down in the forks of the Hiwassee and Tennessee Rivers visitng the Powell settlement. Some of the negroslaves went to notify her of the murder, but she refused to return with the slaves alone. Some members of the white community accompanied her.As widow Womack and her white compainons returned to her plantation home, they discovered cut logs laid for a big fire, and it was supposed that the negro slaves had intended to kill Womack's wife and burn her on the log pyre. Howell Whitmore and a few of the older citizens took the matter in hand and went through some sort of a procedure as was the custom in those days. They condemned Jim and Kit to death by hanging. The two slaves were guarded in the kitchen of the Womack's house during the night of the 24th, but under cover of darkness, Kit escaped. The next morning, the white men hanged Jim from a tree near the blacksmith shop in sight of where he had murdered Jacob, his master. Mrs. Womack and her grandson E.A. Womack, viewed the body of the slave hanging from the tree. Following the flight of Kit from the plantation, Jacob Womack's gold beneath the blacksmith shop was nowhere to be found. As a postlude to the scenario, Jim's body was buried without a coffin at the Dobbs plantation about one mile northwest of Womack's house. Friends of the Womacks believed the murder had been perpetrated in response to Jacob's whipping of several small negroes during an argument about an iron wedge. It is also\n\nimportant to remember that the autumn of 1862 was a time of civil turmoil for the entire state. Secessionist sympathizers feared both the revolt of their slaves and attacks from Union bushwahckers too unmanly to enlist in units and fight by rules of military conduct.\n\nJohn Mason Lillard wrote of these fear in a letter of May 10, 1861, to Esquire Worth of Ashe County, North Carolina: \"...we have a company called the home guard formed of old men... who will attend to the negros and white men that take the Lincoln side in the struggle...there will be about 3 such companies in the county....\" And, E.A. Womack's letter of 1913 recorded a second incident similar in the murder of his grandfather. About the same time as Jacob's murder, a flare-up of racial tensions occured on the Price Creek plantaton of John Womack his brother, John was a slave owner and his son fought with the secessionist army. While the son was home on leave of absence, one of John's slaves had cause to be angry with his master. The slave picked John up and carried him in his arms toward the woodpile where he intended to cut the old man's head off. The soldier son was able to shoot the negro, thereby saving his father.\n\nWebmasters Note: E A Womack was Elder Alexander Womack, son of David Bates Womack and\n\nSallie Ann Cates.\n\nIt it believed the John Womack referred to above was the brother of\n\nJacob who married Sarah Bonner abt 1838--However, only two children listed; and they are both female.
