News posted there also posts to the Mythopoeic Society page on Facebook and is usually copied quickly to the MythSoc *group* on Facebook.

Call For Papers is here\n\nRoom & Board packages are there, too http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-46/room/ - we are in a hotel this summer (yay!) and we have special pricing from the hotel, including meals we can enjoy together as a group. IF you have food allergies, you may want to go for a \"room only\" option so you can order meals which avoid your allergy-inducing foods. I understand that vegetarians are accommodated in the meals packages and that the banquet will have foods accommodating food allergies - please contact the chair, Mem Morman at mythmem rialto org to specify your dietary restrictions so the conference can insure your needs will be met.\n\nPlease remember that rooms MUST be booked through the hotel (this is how we earn our function space and our Mythcon price is lower than any available discount price).\n\nI'll send out another notification when PR#2 is published to remind y'all when the room & board deadline is-- until then, Mythopoeic Announcements out.\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Steward for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n128 Mythcon 46 Registration now open online AND upcoming elections\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nAug 20, 2014\n\nThose of you who attended Mythcon 45 (August 8-11, 2014) know that memberships in next year's Mythcon were sold at the conference. I am pleased to announce that memberships can now be bought online via PayPal. We will shortly have the details for paying by check, for those who want or need a paper trail.\n\nNext year's author GOH will be Jo Walton http://www.jowaltonbooks.com/ and we will let you know who the scholar GOH is, as soon as it is confirmed. The theme is The Arthurian Mythos which is full of riches (do you realize we've only had one other Arthurian themed Mythcon?).\n\n\"www.mythcon.org\" has been redirected to next year's Mythcon:- it's the easiest way to give folks a direct link to the upcoming Mythopoeic Conference.\n\nIN OTHER MYTHOPOEIC SOCIETY NEWS, we do have our triennial election coming up late this fall. We have an almost-complete slate to present to the membership for voting; the position we are missing is the newly revised \"Communications Steward\", formerly the Corresponding Secretary position but updated to reflect the changing realities of social media. A full description of the job was included in Mythprint #369 but I'm including it here, as well:\n\n\"This person is often peopleâs first contact with the Society, and requires someone with excellent written communication skills and great tact. The Communications Steward answers queries about the Society in various forms: paper (very rare); email (most common); and through our presence in a variety of social media. Currently we have accounts on Facebook (several pages and a group); Twitter; Google+; Pinterest; LinkedIn; Goodreads; Flickr; and a Yahoo discussion group.\n\n\"When appropriate, the Communications Steward refers the query (and/or person asking) to another person, our web site, the mythsoc email discussion list, or elsewhere on the Internet. The major portion of this Steward position consists of managing (and preferably expanding) our social media accounts. The Communications Steward coordinates with the various department heads and others to collect and publish news, information and publicity about Society activities. This must be provided on a regular basis to keep the Societyâs social media presence fresh and active. The Communications Steward, as are all Stewards, is a member of the Council of Stewards, the governing Board of the Society. This requires attendance (within reason) at quarterly meetings. Three are via conference call, and one is held at the annual Mythopoeic Conference. All Stewards are expected to contribute to overall governance with information, analysis, and meeting participation. This new(ish) position is an updated version of the former Corresponding Secretary.\"\n\nPlease do consider whether this might be a position which would interest you and, if so, please contact Lynn Maudlin mythcon @ mythsocorg or Gerry Holmes secretary @ mythsocorg.\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Steward for Mythopoeic Conferences and 2014 President of the Society --\n\n127 Mythcon 45 PR#2, 2013 Annual Report, etc.\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nJun 30, 2014\n\nHello, Mythie Friends!\n\nIf you're registered for Mythcon 45 (August 8-11, 2014, at Wheaton College in Norton, MA) you will have received an email with a link for downloading the PDF of the second Progress Report. There's information within the PR which you will probably need at Mythcon 45 so I recommend you download to your phone/tablet or print out a copy. You may also read it on the website (with a download link): http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-45/mythcon-45-pr-2/\n\nMarion VanLoo, our membership Steward, has also just sent out the 2013 Annual Report, as required by law of 501(c)(3) organizations. Remember that we will have our triennial election this fall, discussed in some detail in Mythprint #369, and several Stewards are not standing for re-election. We are still actively looking for a \"Communications Steward\" (see the bottom of this message for a re-posting of the job description).\n\nIf you are interested in serving, please contact either the 2014 Chair of the Council, Lynn Maudlin at mythcon @ mythsoc.org, or the Recording Secretary, Gerry Holmes at secretary @ mythsoc.org The positions on which we will be voting include Treasurer, Recording Steward, Editors of the three Society publications, Orders Department Manager, Communications Steward, Membership and Discussion Groups Steward, Steward for Mythopoeic Conferences, Webmaster, Awards Administrator, and Steward for The Mythopoeic Press. A candidate can file for office by presenting to the Recording Steward, no later than August 11, 2014, a nominating petition signed by 5% of the Societyâs membership (currently 21 signatures). Petitions will be available on request from the Membership Steward, Marion VanLoo at membership@mythsoc.org or by writing her at Box 71, Napoleon MI 49261.\n\nAnd, in case you missed it, the location and date for Mythcon 46 has been announced; we don't have much information beyond that and the theme, The Arthurian Mythos, at this point but memberships will go on sale at Mythcon 45. http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-46/\n\nDO come to Mythcon - it will be lots of fun!\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Steward for Mythopoeic Conferences and 2014 Council President --\n\nOpen job description:\n\nThe Communications Steward is often peopleâs first contact with the Society, and requires someone with excellent written communication skills and great tact.

IF you want to share your room (you know, with your spouse, maybe!) please be sure to notify Conference Registration of your roommate's name (you can write the roommate name in the \"Note to Seller\" space in the PayPal form).\n\nThe price difference this year comes between AIR-CONDITIONED and NON-air-conditioned rooms. Bear in mind, there are a limited number of air-conditioned rooms available, so we cannot guarantee an air-conditioned room if you don't buy your room & board package early.\n\nWe can offer lodging for Thursday night before Mythcon (August 7, 2014), room only. Again, there is a choice between air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned rooms. There is The Cafe on Wheaton College campus which opens at 8:30 a.m. and closes at 3 p.m. so Friday morning breakfast and/or lunch will be available but Thursday dinner will require leaving campus.\n\nSome very interesting and unusual things are being developed for Mythcon 45 so the theme, Where Fantasy Fits, will be examined in several different ways - I do encourage you to come to Mythcon 45 in Norton, Massachusetts (fly into either Boston, MA, or Providence RI) and enjoy Richard C. West, our Scholar Guest of Honor, and Ursula Vernon, our Author (and Artist!) Guest of Honor. Good fun and good scholarship awaits!\n\nFinally, Progress Report #1 is being put together right now and will be published soon in an interim issue of Mythprint - keep your eyes open!\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Steward for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n124 New Webmaster and Mythcon 45\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nAug 14, 2013\n\nHello, friends!\n\nIn our ongoing effort to only send *very* important messages via the Mythopoeic Announcements List (what you're reading right now), I combine two notices in one.\n\nFirst, after more than a year of searching, we were delighted to find David Emerson, right under our respective noses, and he responded to our \"webmaster needed urgently\" plea at the Annual General Meeting of the Mythopoeic Society (held each year at Mythcon) and much huzzah'ing has commenced!\n\nSecond, Mythcon 45 is taking memberships on the website:\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-45/\n\nDr. Richard C. West is our Scholar GOH and our Author GOH will be announced soon, we trust. In any case, we're excited to have another Mythcon in the Northeast after the success of Mythcon 39 in Connecticut. You might start tracking airfares, either to Logan Int'l in Boston or to Providence, RI (which is technically closer). There are other travel options, especially for folks on the East coast.\n\nI encourage you to make plans to attend Mythcon 45, August 8-11, 2014, at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. Chair is Dr. Michael D.C. Drout, our Scholar GOH at Mythcon 42!! :D\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences,\n\nCouncil of Stewards --\n\n123 Mythcon 44 PR#3 now available, Room & Board deadline approaching!\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nMay 30, 2013\n\nHey there, Lynn Maudlin here, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences, making one of our rare Mythopoeic Announcements:\n\n1) Progress Report 3 is now available on the MythSoc website:\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/news/mythcon-44-progress-report-3-available/\n\nIt contains important information about transportation and how the Kellogg shuttle works, so be sure to download it and read it. It will also be sent to Mythcon 44 conference members via MailChimp but, as we are currently \"between\" webmasters, that task is going to take us longer than we would like. So please go download it for yourself.\n\n2) Room & Board deadline for Mythcon 44 is JUNE 11th - this is less than two weeks away, which means that Mythcon 44 is just over five weeks away. You can still join the conference (do come, it will be fun!) and you can even join at the door, but it will cost more.\n\nYou can possibly get room & board packages after the deadline BUT they're not guaranteed and they may well cost more; delay at your own peril. The deadline for MEALS (primarily meaning The Banquet) is July 1; individual meals at Brody can be purchased at the door:\n\nhttp://www.eatatstate.com/diningoncampus\n\n3) At Mythcon 44, you'll be able to join Mythcon 45-- as we have done previous years, there will be a special Mythcon-only rate to join Mythcon 45. We have accepted a bid from Michael Drout (our Scholar GOH at Mythcon 42) to hold Mythcon 45 at Wheaton College in Norton, MASSACHUSETTS, situated between Boston, MA, and Providence, RI. You'll be able to pay for registration with check or credit card, making it very easy (shoot, we'll even take cash). This will be our second Mythcon in the Northeast.\n\nThank you for participating in the Mythopoeic Announcements List - this is the way we get time-critical information to the members of the Society.\n\nSee you in East Lansing!\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin --\n\n122 Mythcon 44 Scholar GOH update\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nFeb 6, 2013\n\nHello friends,\n\nLynn Maudlin here, secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences, and I wanted to let you know that our originally scheduled Scholar Guest of Honor for Mythcon 44, Dr. Christopher Mitchell, director of the Wade Center in Wheaton, had a major life-change and gave us his regrets (he's moving from Illinois to California this summer, making it too big a challenge to *also* be our GOH).\n\nBut never fear! Intrepid Mythcon chair Marion VanLoo has acquired for us Douglas A. Anderson, winner of the Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies for \"The Annotated Hobbit\" in 1990, and this is an especially appropriate pairing of guest and theme - after all, there's a lovely hobbit-hole for our conference logo this year.\n\nPlease note the Call For Papers, Registration, and Room & Board are also linked on that same page.\n\nSee you in Michigan this summer!\n\n-- Lynn --\n\n121 Mythcon 43 Room & Board/meals/parking passes DEADLINE!!\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nJul 8, 2012\n\nDEADLINE for buying room & board packages, meal packages, stand-alone banquet tickets, WEEKEND PARKING PASSES (if you don't want to trek out every morning to feed the finicky machine!) is **JULY 9** yes, that's tomorrow.\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/43/room/\n\nLooking forward to seeing many of you in Berkeley!\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n120 Progress Report #2 for MYTHCON 43 is now available\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nJun 17, 2012\n\nHey there --\n\nIf you're a member of Mythcon 43 you should have already received an email about Progress Report #2, with a link to download it as a PDF (save or print it).\n\nIt's also found on the front page of the Mythopoeic Society website under \"Latest News\" and the Mythcon 43 page under \"Progress Reports\" - do make sure you're all caught up with the happenings!\n\nDEADLINE for purchasing your room & board packages (extra nights, parking permits, banquet tickets, etc.) is JULY 9th and that's coming right up - eeeep!\n\nSee you in Berkeley!\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n119 A Message from the Treasurer of Mythcon 43:\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nApr 6, 2012\n\nHurry Hurry!

Le Guin, Lloyd Alexander, Madeleine L'Engle and Orson Scott Card (McFarland, 2008)\n\nThe Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature is given to the fantasy novel, multi-volume, or single-author story collection for adults published during 2009 that best exemplifies \"the spirit of the Inklings.\" Books are eligible for two years after publication if not selected as a finalist during the first year of eligibility. Books from a series are eligible if they stand on their own; otherwise, the series becomes eligible the year its final volume appears. The Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature honors books for younger readers (from \"Young Adults\" to picture books for beginning readers), in the tradition of The Hobbit or The Chronicles of Narnia. Rules for eligibility are otherwise the same as for the Adult Literature award. The question of which award a borderline book is best suited for will be decided by consensus of the committees.\n\nThe Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies is given to books on Tolkien, Lewis, and/or Williams that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship. For this award, books first published during the last three years (2007Â2009) are eligible, including finalists for previous years. The Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Myth and Fantasy Studies is given to scholarly books on other specific authors in the Inklings tradition, or to more general works on the genres of myth and fantasy. The period of eligibility is three years, as for the Inklings Studies award.\n\nThe winners of this year's awards were announced at Mythcon XLI in Dallas, Texas, on July 11, 2010. A complete list of Mythopoeic Award winners is available on the Society web site:\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/awards.htm\n\nThe finalists for the literature awards, text of recent acceptance speeches, and selected book reviews are also listed in this on-line section.

Improved!!!\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nMar 23, 2010\n\nMy mythie friends, as the Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences, I have a good news-bad news announcement for you. First, the good news:\n\nMythcon 41 won't be held on the campus of SMU after all but will instead be held at the Crowne Plaza Suites-Dallas. This means instead of living in a dormitory and eating college food you'll be staying in a *suite* and eating hotel food.\n\nBut wait, there's more: even better, the double room rate has not changed! (I know, I know, pick yourself up off the floor).\n\nUnfortunately (here comes the bad news) the same cannot be said of the *single* room rate. BUT please remember that Mythcon 41's single room rate is still lower than the single room rate for last year's Mythcon by more than $100.\n\nThe **DEADLINE** for purchasing room & board packages has been moved up to June 1st due to the hotel's requirements.\n\nThe hotel is very nice and has experience with SF conventions, so we won't be out of their realm of experience. You must, however, buy your room & board packages THROUGH Mythcon in order to get the rates we're publishing and be part of the conference.\n\nIf you have further questions, please feel free to email me: mythcon AT mythsoc DOT org will reach me.\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n96 New Mythprint Editor [there is no #97]\n\nI am very pleased to announce that Jason Fisher has been confirmed by the Council of Stewards as the new editor of Mythprint.

Unlike a box of chocolates, a Mythcon membership won't live on your thighs forever, and will provide months of delightful anticipation rather than weeks of regret (\"I can't believe I ate the whole thing!!\").\n\nYou'll also notice that the rates are really reasonable! Much less $$ than UCLA last year and SMU is a nice campus... this will be good! I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.\n\nLet me ALSO announce that MYTHPRINT #330 (Volume 47:1, January 2010) is essentially finished and will be sent as a pdf to those subscribers whose email addresses the Society already has on record. We apologize for any confusion about which issue of Mythprint was delayed - turns out the next issue due is whole number 330 and that's what we're sending.\n\nYou can make sure that Marion Van Loo, our Membership Secretary, has your email address by emailing her: membership AT mythsoc DOT org - and if you want to continue receiving Mythprint in printed format *even if we have your email address* please email Marion and let her know.\n\nAs specified earlier, we will extend all electronic subscriptions by two issues.\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n93 Mythprint delay and evolution\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nJan 15, 2010\n\nMythprint #332 has been delayed.\n\nEditor Ginger McElwee has been forced to resign suddenly due to family care issues. The Stewards will produce an issue as soon as possible while seeking a new editor. For some time we have been discussing the future of Mythprint, and had already come to the conclusion that the time has come to make Mythprint primarily an electronic publication; we will continue with a limited print run for libraries and those subscribers unable to receive Mythprint by email.\n\nWe will extend all electronic subscriptions by two issues.\n\nWe will assume you are willing to receive Mythprint as a PDF by email if we have your email address; please advise Marion Van Loo (membership AT mythsoc DOT org) if you are willing to receive Mythprint electronically. If we only have your physical address, we will assume you require Mythprint in printed format unless you update Marion with your email address.\n\nPlease bear with us as we deal with this unexpected situation.\n\nThe Council of Stewards\n\n92 Mythcon 41 Call for Papers\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nJan 2, 2010\n\nHappy New Year, my mythical friends (wait, that's wrong; I know so many of you in person, I'm quite sure you're real!) - please allow me to direct your attention to http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/41/ where you can still join the 41st Mythopoeic conference at a reduced rate *and* where the Call for Papers is linked.\n\nOr you may go directly to the Call for Papers at:\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/41/papers/\n\nI look forward to seeing many of you in Dallas this July 9-12 for Mythcon 41. Be there or be cubic!\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n91 Mythcon 41: July 9-12, 2010\n\nlynnmaudlin\n\nDec 3, 2009\n\nAt last we have confirmed the dates for Mythcon 41: July 9-12, 2010, at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. This is a couple of months later than we thought we would have the details finalized and we hope it's not been too much of a problem for you faithful Mythies.\n\nThe early registration prices are good through January 31, 2010, so do think about who on your holiday gift list would cherish a Mythcon membership!\n\nVery appropos to the conference theme, War in Heaven, we have author GOH Tim Powers (and his delightful wife, Serena: if you were at Mythcon 26 in Berkeley, you remember well what great guests they are) and our very own brilliant Janet Croft as scholar GOH.\n\nHoliday blessings to you all--\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences --\n\n90 Mythcon 41 (Dallas), Mythopoeic Awards, Membership Meeting\n\nLynn Maudlin\n\nAug 3, 2009\n\nHello my friends and gentlehobbits,\n\nWe have enjoyed a lovely Mythcon at UCLA, enjoying two splendid Guests of Honor in James A. Owen and Diana Pavlac Glyer, and you know what that means: time to buy your membership in *next year's Mythcon* while prices are low!!!\n\nWe also awarded four more Mythopoeic Awards and those details and the acceptance remarks are available at our website:\n\nFinally we enjoyed a well-attended meeting of the membership of the Mythopoeic Society on Monday morning, before closing ceremonies, which included an explanation of the upcoming increase in the price of membership. We've been creeping up for several years, relying on Mythcon to raise funds for the Society to cover the fact that memberships don't quite pay for the expenses of running the Society, but with the necessity of purchasing a large liability insurance policy for Mythcon this year we found we are better served to buy a general liability insurance policy for the Society; this means not only is Mythcon covered but so are other Society meetings (e.g., discussion groups).\n\nOf course we've never had a claim in more than 40 years but that doesn't alleviate the need to have liability insurance for Mythcon.\n\nBottom line, we shopped around, found a good policy and it's expensive so we need to adjust membership with Mythprint upward by $5 per year. Just so you know, when that rate rolls up.\n\nHoping you are enjoying your summer,\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin, SMC --\n\n89 Mythlore Blowout Sale at Mythcon!\n\nJoan Marie Verba\n\nJul 10, 2009\n\nBack issues of Mythlore 1-84 will be sold at Mythcon for only $2 each(regular price $3.50 each). Such a deal! Relive the thrilling days of yesteryear when such big name professional artists as George Barr and Tim Kirk contributed regularly to its pages! See how your respectable middle-aged (and later) friends and colleagues embarrassed themselves as youthful fanboys and -girls! (Or distinguished themselves as precocious scholars.) Help us reduce our back-issue inventory so we can save the Society money on storage fees!\n\nYes, your intrepid Stewards are taking advantage of the relative proximity of said storage to this year's Mythcon site, and the fact that many of us will have cars along. We're making a special trip to the wilds of South Pasadena and bringing back an extra-large number of Mythlores for your purchasing pleasure.\n\nPlease don't make us haul them back!\n\nIf you have special requests for specific issues (or specific artists) please let me know no later than noon PDT next Wednesday (July 15). My art index to Mythlore is only in its infancy as an electronic document, but if you have a particular artist in mind I'll do my best to plow through my worksheets if I have time.\n\nEdith Crowe\n\n88 LAST DAY!!!\n\nLynn Maudlin\n\nJul 6, 2009\n\nIf you haven't paid for your room & board package at Mythcon, TODAY is your final opportunity!\n\nYou can buy membership at the door; it will cost more but you can do it. But room/board packages will NOT be available at the door and I'm not sure it will even be possible to buy banquet tickets at Mythcon.\n\nYou *will* be able to buy individual meals from UCLA but that will be a bit of a pain, compared to having the meal plan.\n\nSo RUN don't walk over to the website and follow the links to registration and room & board.\n\nFun, fun, fun REAL soon now! Hope to see you there\n\n-- Lynn --\n\n87 Mythcon 40 ...tick ...tick ...tick\n\nLynn Maudlin\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nNO, it is NOT Captain Hook's alligator coming back around for another tasty hand - it's TIME running out to preregister & arrange room and board packages (and UCLA parking, I think ...Sarah?) for MYTHCON 40 at UCLA, De Neve Plaza in Los Angeles (basically Westwood).\n\nThe LAST DAY for prereg & room/board is JULY 6th.\n\nPlease note the tentative schedule is now up at the website:\n\nFantasy author & artist James A.

Williams, PhD, Professor of English at Toccoa Falls College in NE Georgia, has just been appointed as editor of The Lamp-Post: The Journal of the Southern California C. S. Lewis Society. Williamsâ task will partly be a resurrection of sorts, for the journal has been published only haphazardly in recent years. He hopes to have it back on a dependable quarterly publication schedule by January, 2010. One does not have to live in Southern California to be the editor, obviouslyânor to be a subscriber . . . nor a contributor. Williams hopes a number of Mythies will submit quality scholarly articles, essays, and poetry on Lewis, his, life, his circle, his works, and his ideas. Send submissions to him as Microsoft Word documents (2003 compatible) at dtw@tfc.edu.\n\nTo subscribe ($10.00 per year), contact Edie Dougherty at marshwiggler@mac.com.

Hope you all enjoyed the winter solstice and ALL the upcoming holidays.\n\nThank you for voting for all your favorite Stewards: we've all been re-elected.\n\nI trust you've subscribed the RSS feed at www.mythsoc.org - if you have, you will already know that the room & board packages for Mythcon 40 (July 17-20, 2009) are posted; UCLA's DeNeve Plaza conference space puts us in a single modern building for dorms, meals, and programming; each dorm room has its own bathroom (YES!). I also understand that the price of conference registration will remain at the current rate through the end of *January* 2009.\n\nI have set up a Twitter account for Mythcon 40 and encourage you to follow it at I encourage any Mythcon 40 related posts to insert #mc40 so we can easily follow everyone's Mythcon 40 posts by using Twitter's search function. I'll provide moreinformation in the new year; folks with questions can email me:\n\nmythcon AT mythsoc DOT org\n\nBefore closing, I would like to remind Mythies far and wide, near and narrow, that a Mythopoeic Society membership might just be the perfect gift for a fellow lover of fantasy: not too expensive, not too flashy. Or perhaps a subscription to Mythlore or Mythic Circle. For that very special loved one we recommend a membership to Mythcon 40. All of these thoughtful and tasteful gifts can be immediately procured online through the Society's website without any shipping & handling fees (hey, we aim to please).\n\nBlessings one and all, stay warm in the Northern Hemisphere, remember your sunscreen in the Southern Hemisphere and I have no message for anyone living on the equator other than, \"come to Los Angeles for Mythcon 40!\"\n\nDon't drink and drive, don't text and drive, don't write your doctoral thesis and drive-- just drive.\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin --\n\n83 Mythopoeic (sorta) Monthly - November 2008\n\nLynn Maudlin\n\nNov 11 5:32 PM\n\nYes, you would be right that we didn't have news to report in October and the purpose of the Mythopoeic Announcements list isn't to burble without meaning.\n\nBut while October news was sparse, November we have news:\n\nThe Society Directory (\"Mything Persons\") will be mailed out shortly along with the ballots for Society elections; the currently serving Stewards are all hoping to be confirmed in our respective roles. Take a look at our Council of Stewards webpage to refresh your memory.\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/leadership/\n\nMythopoeic Conferences are always close to my heart {{grin}} and I'm pleased to announce that Mythcon 40's Call for Papers (CFP) is now available at the Society website and, we trust, other locations shortly. You know what this means - start writing!\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/40/papers/\n\nSpeaking of Mythcons, next year's Scholar Guest of Honor is Diana Pavlac Glyer, whose book, \"The Company They Keep: J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as Writers in Community,\" won this year's Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies. The book has just been released in paperback and is now in-stock at Amazon.com - I encourage you to click through the MythSoc website; you give the Mythopoeic Society a small percentage by using our link at the bottom of the navigation bar on the left side of our pages).\n\nSarah Beach, this year's Mythcon chair, says we should have room and board packages online soon, along with the ability for folks to make a series of payments over the next eight months or so, if that's easier than a single payment.\n\nAnd finally, as the SMC (Secretary for Mythopoeic Conferences), I will simply say that we have a series of interesting possibilities lining up for 2010, 2011, and beyond - it just makes me tingle with delight! If you haven't yet discovered what great fun Mythcons are, Mythcon 40 at UCLA next summer will be a great introduction - do come join us!\n\nhttp://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/about/ [updated: http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon.htm ]\n\nblessings with thanksgiving,\n\n-- Lynn Maudlin --\n\n82 [Fwd: E-Chronicles of the C.S.

Lewis and the Quest for Joyâ\n\n*Come join us on the campus of Brentwood Academy in Nashville, Tennessee on May 5th *as we engage the world of C.S. Lewis in the company of enthusiastic readers from across the region. Together, we will explore his life and works, discovering the essential role of faith in our own quest for Joy. Featuring engaging lectures by Lewis scholars, inspiring performances by leading Christian artists, a variety of breakout sessions on the role of joy in our own lives and work, and a Childrenâs Track for young Narnians (ages 7-12), the Southeast Regional C.S. Lewis Conference offers a feast for the heart, mind, and imagination!\n\nLectures by Leading Lewis Scholars!\n\nWhen C.S. Lewis described his conversion to Christianity in his autobiography /Surprised by Joy/, he spoke of Joy as being the fulfillment of the longing for our Creator, which he called /Sehnsucht.\n\nThis connection between Joy and the longing for God would become a central theme in Lewisâ life and works, so much so that Lewis once stated, âIn a sense the central story of my life is about nothing elseâ¦ It is that of an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction. I call it Joyâ¦.â\n\nSo that we may affirm the essential role of Joy in our own lives, noted Lewis scholars *Joseph Pearce*, *Stan Mattson* and *Andrew Lazo* will take you on a journey through the life and works of Lewis in three insightful lectures:\n\n*â/The Long Journey Home/:/ C.S. Lewis and /Surprised by Joy/* *Stan Mattson*, Founder & President, C.S. Lewis Foundation\n\n*âFaithful and Free: C.S. Lewis and the Joyful Intellectâ *Joseph Pearce*, Professor & Writer-in-Residence, Ave Maria University\n\n*âThe Quest for Joy in The Chronicles of Narniaâ *Andrew Lazo*, Fellow, Rice University; Visiting Scholar, Marion E. Wade Center\n\nInspiring Performances!\n\nIn addition to rich lectures on Lewis, the Southeast Regional C.S. Lewis Conference will feature performances by Christian artists in Joy-filled celebration:\n\n*The *Ad Deum Dance Company* of Houston will pair with guest singer-songwriter *Stacy Jagger *in an exploration of faith, grace, beauty and redemption through music and dance.\n\n*Artist and former pastor, *Joe Castillo* will create an âArt Story,\" a presentation in which he discusses themes from Narnia while illustrating them, ultimately combining the smaller Narnian images into a surprise larger portrait of C.S. Lewis.\n\n*Physician/Musician *Jeff Kepple* and his daughter *Kelsey* will entertain you with songs inspired by their own journey to Narnia.\n\n*Finally, you will be delightfully entertained and greatly informed by a private screening of the recently released and superb Disney documentary, */C.S. Lewis: Dreamer of Narnia/*\n\nSmall Group Breakout Sessions on the Role of Joy in Our Lives!\n\nOne of the special rewards of attending the Southeast Regional Retreat is the rich fellowship with other \"Mere\" Christians and seekers. Our breakout sessions will provide valuable time to engage such relevant topics as Communicating the Gospel through the Arts; The Joyful Business of Songwriting and Recording; Expressions of Joy through Modern Dance; Storytelling: The Oral Tradition; the Apologetics of Joy; Christianity and Popular Culture; and Finally Finding Joy: /Till We Have Faces/.\n\nAn Acclaimed Childrenâs Track!\n\nDesigned for children ages 7-12 (age exceptions gladly considered on an individual basis!), this program will offer children a chance to engage the writings of Lewis on their own level in imaginative, creative and faithful ways. Our goal is to provide purposeful fun so that we might encourage children to enjoy their reading, to find little life lessons all around them, and to become better followers of Aslan in their own unique ways!\n\nDonât miss this feast for the heart, mind, and imagination!\n\n64 [Fwd: Mythcon 38: rates going up soon]\n\nJoan Marie Verba\n\nJan 15, 2007\n\nThe 38th Mythopoeic Conference, Mythcon 38, will be held at the Clark Kerr Center in Berkeley, California, August 3-6.
