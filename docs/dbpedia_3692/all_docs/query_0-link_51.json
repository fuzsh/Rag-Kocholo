The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:09 a.m., in room 1100 Longworth House Office Building, Hon. E. Clay Shaw, Jr., (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding. [The advisory announcing the hearing follows:] ADVISORY FROM THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS SUBCOMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY Contact: (202) 225-9263 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 19, 2001 No. SS-7 Shaw Announces Hearing on Misleading Mailings Targeted to Seniors Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr., (R-FL), Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security of the Committee on Ways and Means, today announced that the Subcommittee will hold a hearing on misleading mailings targeted to seniors. The hearing will take place on Thursday, July 26, 2001, in the main Committee hearing room, 1100 Longworth House Office Building, beginning at 10:00 a.m. In view of the limited time available to hear witnesses, oral testimony at this hearing will be from invited witnesses only. However, any individual or organization not scheduled for an oral appearance may submit a written statement for consideration by the Committee and for inclusion in the printed record of the hearing. BACKGROUND: Social Security affects the lives of almost every American. Nine out of ten seniors receive Social Security benefits. Seniors pay close attention to any information they receive concerning Social Security, as notices often refer to changes in benefits that make up a least half of the income for a majority of seniors. Despite the fact that the law prohibits certain misleading communications, the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) Office of Inspector General (IG) continues to receive complaints and conduct investigations of misleading SSA-related solicitations. Recently, SSA's IG settled a case with the Lead Agency, Inc., who sent approximately 2.6 million death benefit insurance ``lead card'' mailings to seniors that appeared to be from or related to SSA. Information from these cards was then used to sell insurance policies. More recently, the IG completed investigations regarding two types of misleading mailings targeted primarily to seniors. One mailing made claims about a fictional ``Slave Reparations Act'' and the other raised the prospect of $5,000 payments to ``notch babies.'' Both mailings indicated that the payments would be coming from SSA, but that to receive the funds, the individual must supply their personal information, including their Social Security number to a National Victim's Register. All replies were directed to the TREA Senior Citizens League (TSCL), an independent affiliate of The Retired Enlisted Association (TREA). TSCL is a tax-exempt organization that advocates legislative reforms for seniors. According to the IG, these flyers generated more than 29,000 individual responses, many of which included copies of personal documents such as Social Security cards, drivers licenses, birth certificates, and detailed family genealogies. TSCL denied any involvement with the flyer and the IG was unable to identify its origin. However, the IG investigation revealed that TSCL directed its data processing firm to create a database containing the respondent's personal information. This information was then used to send a letter to respondents disavowing any responsibility for the flyers, which included TSCL's standard fundraising brochure. In announcing the hearing, Chairman Shaw stated: ``Misleading mailing scams targeted at seniors are unconscionable crimes. Many of our seniors are particularly vulnerable, due to their limited income or isolated living environment. Deceptive mailings that appear to have the approval or endorsement of SSA are illegal and will not be tolerated. The more seniors know about these scams, the more they and their families can protect themselves from becoming victims of these heartless perpetrators.'' FOCUS OF THE HEARING: The Subcommittee will hear testimony related to several misleading mailings targeting seniors. Testimony will include the experiences of victims and related investigation findings of the SSA/IG and other law enforcement officials.

Good morning. If members and guests would take their seats, I would like to welcome all of you here today. We have a very discouraging issue, however, before us. Senior citizens are being unscrupulously targeted by misleading mailings and flyers, and these are from groups that seek to capture Social Security numbers and other personal information. Why? So they can sell or rent the data for profit or, in some cases, use the information to solicit future sales or donations. How do they get seniors to turn over sensitive personal information? By issuing promises they can't keep or using fear and threats. It is downright deceptive, and this Congress must do everything in our power to make it stop. Nine out of 10 seniors receive Social Security benefits. It is no wonder why seniors pay more close attention to any information they receive which has the appearance of an official government document or otherwise looks like it might have anything to do with their Social Security checks. I represent a large number of senior citizens in Florida, for whom preserving Social Security and Medicare benefits are of paramount concern. The law clearly prohibits certain misleading communications, but the Social Security Administration's Office of Inspector General (OIG) continues to receive complaints from seniors. Last year alone, the inspector general (IG) opened up close to 40 new investigations of misleading Social Security- related solicitations. My office receives countless numbers of letters generated by senior advocacy groups every year. Many of these campaigns serve the public good by informing and organizing individuals of like interests. Others merely fan fear, which then become all the more reason for seniors to support groups that claim to be their advocate here in Washington for change. Today we will hear from the Social Security Administration's Inspector General, who will tell us how and why groups generate misleading mailings and the investigative strategies his office has used to fight these scams. In addition, we will hear perspectives from the Arkansas State's Attorney General's office, whose staff works on the frontline, combating all types of consumer fraud. Lorna Daniels, a targeted victim of these misleading flyers, is here to share her story and experience with us. Betty Severyn will tell us about American Association of Retired Persons' (AARP) many efforts to educate seniors on how to avoid falling prey to these unscrupulous organizations. Finally, we will hear testimony from The Retired Enlisted Association (TREA) Senior Citizens League or TSCL and companies they work with on mailings. The addresses of TREA Senior Citizens League appears on the so-called slave reparation and notch flyers as the reply address. While TREA Senior Citizens League claims no role in the distribution of these flyers, I find it problematic that they retrieved the unsolicited information from their mailbox and dumped it in their solicitation database. You can be sure we will explore these issues fully when they testify. It is unconscionable for rip-off artists to prey on vulnerable Americans in their twilight years, many of whom live from check to check and cannot afford to lose any of their hard-earned benefits and savings. Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but I was taught to respect my elders, not to take advantage of them. It is my goal to shine a bright light on these deceptive mailings so that senior citizens will be on guard and contact the Social Security Administration or their Member of Congress at the first sight of a scam. The best protection against misleading mail schemes is education. We may not be able to completely eliminate these fraudulent groups from targeting senior citizens, but we can expose their schemes and educate seniors on how to protect themselves. Mr. Matsui. [The opening statement of Chairman Shaw follows:] Opening Statement of the Hon. E.

The best protection against misleading mail schemes is education. We may not be able to completely eliminate these fraudulent groups from targeting seniors, but we can expose their schemes and educate seniors on how to protect themselves. Mr. Matsui. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to, first of all, thank you very much, you and your staff, in coordinating with myself and our staff. I think you are doing a tremendous service, not only to the senior citizen population of America, but certainly to the American public. I want to also commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle of this Subcommittee, because I know each and every one of them feels as strongly as you and I do about this particular issue. I intend to pursue this issue with the Chairman as far as it will go. I think criminal fraud was committed on senior citizens in this particular situation. And I know three of those individuals that will be asked to testify this morning are in the audience. There is a fourth one, who claims to be ill, with a doctor's excuse. And as a result of that, he has failed to respond to the subpoena, although obviously a doctor's excuse would give that person that opportunity to do so. But that individual will be eventually deposed or brought before this Subcommittee. I will guarantee you that. And so, he better get well quickly. It is my belief that we need to educate the public. And the Social Security Administration has that responsibility. But also, we need to make sure that individuals who commit these frauds and perpetrate these activities are given the full force of the law, so that they will be used as an example so that this will never happen again. And if they think they are going to get out of this, they are greatly mistaken. The inspector general doesn't have the tools that law enforcement officers have, but hopefully this will get, obviously with the Arkansas attorney general, but also with the U.S. Justice Department as well. And I hope that nobody thinks that they are going to go to sleep at night feeling protected if they commit these kinds of activities. I have had constituents as well that have been sent these flyers, some of whom undoubtedly sent money to this sham group. And as a result of that, I feel very strongly about being able to deal with this in a comprehensive way. And I said, this will not end until we get to the bottom of how this happened and the individuals who are actually responsible for it. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you very much for calling this Subcommittee hearing, and for your commitment to this issue. [The opening statement of Mr. Matsui follows:] Opening Statement of the Hon. Robert T. Matsui, a Representative in Congress from the State of California Thank you, Chairman Shaw, for calling today's hearing. I am hopeful that today's hearing--taken together with the investigations that the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has conducted in recent months-- will help to alert our nation's senior citizens to the unscrupulous activities that some will pursue for the sake of their own gain or advancement. I think it is simply unconscionable that there are some organizations and individuals who are willing to deceive senior citizens and prey upon their anxieties. Solicitations such as the ones we will hear about today seek to profit off of seniors in their seventies and eighties who depend on Social Security to provide a significant part of their income. It is disgraceful that any organization would try to take advantage of our senior citizens' trust in the good name of Social Security. In addition, while the OIG's most recent investigation into solicitations about a fictional ``Slave Reparations Act'' and so-called ``notch'' legislation proved inconclusive, I look forward to hearing from Inspector General Huse about some of the information that came to light as a result of his office's inquiry. Lastly, I am hopeful that today's hearing--and the increased attention that it will bring to the issue of misleading solicitations-- will deter other organizations and individuals from pursuing these scams. Scams like the ``Slave Reparations Act'' not only deceive senior citizens, but erode their faith in their government and its responsiveness to their concerns. Chairman Shaw. All members will be given an opportunity to place an opening statement in the record, including Jerry Kleczka, who is joining us on this panel this morning. [The opening statements of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Kleczka follow:] Opening Statement of the Hon. Sam Johnson, a Representative in Congress from the State of Texas Thank you, Chairman Shaw for calling this hearing on misleading mailings regarding the Social Security ``notch'' issue. The people responsible for sending these misleading mailings are truly reprehensible and you are doing a great service for seniors by holding a hearing to highlight the Inspector General's findings. It's obvious fraudulent groups like this prey on unsuspecting seniors. Luckily my constituents are smarter than this. While the misleading mailings highlighted by the Inspector General were supposed to have been sent last year, just last week I received a letter from a constituent. ``Helen'', had recently received a mailing. That mailing asked for money to be placed on a ``National Notch Victim Register.'' In her letter to me, she asked me to advise her whether ``this is another Scam-Rip off or on the level.'' Well, Tuesday afternoon I spoke with Helen and told her that she does not need to send anyone money in order to benefit from new laws. I also told her that legislation on the ``notch'' is never going to pass. I appreciate AARP coming to testify today on this important issue and I also appreciate their help warning seniors about misleading mailings. Besides the ``notch'' scam, another misleading mailing was scamming money from people for a ``slave reparations'' registry. That mailing also had the Retired Enlisted Association Senior Citizen's League as the recipient of return mail. I will be very interested to learn today how the scam mailings, with a return address of the Retired Enlisted Association Senior Citizen's League, vary from the mailings that this group claims as their own. I am also looking forward to learning why on earth the Senior Citizen's League would ever glean information from fraudulent mailings, and why they would go so far as to use this improperly obtained information for fundraising of their own. Opening Statement of the Hon. Gerald D. Kleczka, a Representative in Congress From the State of Wisconsin Chairman Shaw, Ranking Member Matsui, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for allowing me to join you in today's hearing. Our senior citizens are continually being besieged with misleading mailings from questionable advocacy groups telling them that the Social Security Administration is cheating them. These letters claim that retirees born between 1917 and 1926 are ``Notch Victims'' and are entitled to a $5,000 lump-sum payment. This is simply an attempt to extort money from the most vulnerable among us--those aged 75 to 84--by promising increased Social Security payments. Congress corrected the flaw in the Social Security formula in 1977 and the benefit amount being received today by these retirees is correct. However, upon receipt of these mailings, concerned elderly immediately call us inquiring if the information is true and if the groups sending them are legitimate. I advise my constituents to throw out the material for it is nothing more than a scam! One such group that continually solicits the elderly is The Retired Enlisted Association's (TREA) subsidiary--The Senior Citizens League (TSCL). Chartered by Congress in 1992 to serve the interests of our retired enlisted service members, this group expanded their reach to non-military retirees in 1994. Since then, their repeated solicitations for contributions have been combined with replicas of $5,000 US Government-Social Security Trust Fund checks, plastic Notch Registry cards and requests to seniors to include TSCL in their will. Last year these types of deceptive tactics netted The Senior Citizens League over $12 million! This is all done by telling our elderly that Notch legislation is pending in Congress which will give them more money. Although bills have been introduced to accomplish this, we all know that the Social Security Trust Fund is already strained, and legislation costing $45 to $60 billion to raise existing retiree benefits will never pass. They go on to state that they are maintaining a notch registry and will inform contributors if benefits are increased. Further, the mailing requests that seniors check a box if they want their $5,000 award in four annuals payments or a monthly increase in SS benefits. Who died and left this group in charge of the Social Security program! As we all know, the Social Security Administration is charged with and would notify seniors of any change in benefits. There is no need for this organization to maintain any registry list and clearly they have no say over any future benefit levels. This deception is being perpetrated to accomplish their real goal and that is ``I'm enclosing a contribution to join with you and to help cover the cost of maintaining the register and to pay for our massive national campaign . . .'' The tactics employed by this group have continually raised serious concerns about their legitimacy. In a letter I wrote to The Senior Citizens League last May, I asked them to ``. . . stop soliciting my constituents for money and asking them to include your organization in their wills.'' The time has come for Congress to demand they cease and desist, or serious consideration should be given to revocation of the TREA charter. Again, Chairman Shaw--thank you for allowing me to participate today. Chairman Shaw. Mr. Huse, welcome to the hearing. And you may proceed as you see fit. We have your full testimony, which will be made a part of the record, as will the testimony of all the witnesses here this morning. I would like to point out to the Committee that in about a half an hour, we are going to be called for two votes on the floor. So at that time, we would recess for as long as necessary in order to complete our voting obligations, after which we would return to the hearing. Mr. Huse? STATEMENT OF THE HON. JAMES G. HUSE, JR., INSPECTOR GENERAL, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Mr. Huse. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, and thank you for the opportunity to speak today about direct mail operators that profit by using references to Social Security to trick senior citizens into parting with sensitive personal information. For over 60 years, the words ``Social Security'' have held special meaning for elderly Americans, so when mailings arrive with the official Social Security seal or references to Social Security, many seniors respond reflexively. Today I will describe some of the investigations we have conducted this past year into organizations that misuse the Social Security Administration's (SSA) name and exploit the special bond between the Social Security Administration and its beneficiaries. The first of these involved a company called Lead Agency, which sent solicitations to seniors that appeared to be from or endorsed by the SSA. These mailings offered to provide updated information on Social Security benefits. And in response, thousands of seniors forwarded their personal information to the company. Lead Agency would then market the data to insurance companies and others, generating millions of dollars in revenue. Pursuant to the settlement reached in this State, the Lead Agency agreed to a permanent injunction barring them from violating section 1140 of the Social Security Act and further agreed to dissolve its corporate charter and pay $595,000 in civil monetary penalties to the Social Security trust fund. In a contemporaneous investigation, again working in east Texas with the U.S. Attorneys Office, we uncovered a separate but remarkably similar scam, a corporate doing business as United States Seniors Services, Inc., USSS, Acc-U-Lead, and Mass Mail Media had been sending similarly misleading solicitations to seniors in order to obtain personal information for resale on the open market. The defendants in this matter ultimately agreed to pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty to the Social Security trust fund, and agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction. The last case I will discuss resulted in the issuance of a nationwide alert to seniors, urging them to exercise great caution when responding to solicitations promising additional Social Security payments. This alert was based on the receipt of hoax flyers by more 29,000 seniors. They were duped into surrendering personal information with the promise of a $5,000 lump sum payment or a temporary increase in monthly benefits. Along with the Postal Inspection Service, we initiated an investigation after our fraud hotline received nearly 100 calls about the flyers. A review of the flyers revealed that a post office box maintained by TSCL, a tax-exempt organization that states it advocates for legislative reforms on behalf of senior citizens, was listed on all of the flyers. We contacted TSCL and learned that it had received over 18,000 individual responses to the flyers and had directed its data processing contractor to enter all of the victims' personal information into a database and to send each senior a letter denying any responsibility for the hoax. The letter indicated a solicitation for funds to support TSCL's campaigns. We requested that TSCL discontinue entering the seniors' information into its database, but TSCL refused to comply with this request, disavowing any involvement with the hoax flyers and maintaining that they must have been disseminated by a well-intentioned albeit confused supporter. In an attempt to determine the person, individual or entity responsible for the creation and dissemination of the hoax flyers, we issued subpoenas to TSCL and its database firm to obtain all of the original responses. Unfortunately, the flyers appeared in churches, senior centers, nursing homes, magazines, newspapers, and local government offices nationwide. Because of the informal distribution channels employed, which included hand-posting on cars and bulletin boards, we were unable to identify the source of the flyers. Nevertheless, the investigation served to highlight the vulnerability of senior citizens to exploitation by those who use inaccurate, misleading or false information to solicit information or money from them. Our office has made deceptive Social Security look-alike mailings a top investigative priority. While we have made significant progress, the three cases I previously described illustrate that the problem of deceptive mailing aimed at senior citizens is far from eradicated. And we thank the Committee for its interest in these matters. [The prepared statement of Mr. Huse follows:] Statement of the Hon. James G. Huse, Jr., Inspector General, Office of Inspector General, Social Security Administration Good morning, Chairman Shaw and members of the Subcommittee. Let me first thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on a matter of great importance to the people of the United States--how misleading mailings victimize our nation's senior citizens, specifically, how direct mail operators use veiled references to ``Social Security'' to trick senior citizens into parting with sensitive, personal information. By selling such deceptively gathered information, these direct mailers can generate millions of dollars in revenue. For over sixty years, the words ``Social Security'' have held special meaning for elderly Americans. Social Security checks have lifted millions out of poverty, and have provided an important source of additional income for many others. So when mailings arrive with the official Social Security seal, or references to ``Social Security,'' many seniors respond reflexively. After all, Social Security is their lifeline. They rely on their Social Security check to put food on their table, to put a roof over their head, or simply to pay their bills. Surely, if a communication is arriving from Social Security, it must be important. Today, my testimony will focus on how unscrupulous individuals, companies, and organizations have exploited this special bond between the Social Security Administration (SSA) and its beneficiaries. These parasitic groups recognize the powerful nature of the words ``Social Security,'' and they seek to include them in their direct mail promotions at all costs. They have one simple goal in mind--lining their own pockets at the expense of individuals on limited or fixed incomes. I will also detail the investigative and legal strategies our office has employed to fight such scams. Finally, I would like to recognize the work of this Subcommittee in providing a variety of novel remedies to fight such scams. I can attest to the fact that these legislative remedies work, having used virtually all of these tools during my tenure as Inspector General. The Predators and Their Mailings There are several common themes that pervade the ranks of misleading mailers. First, they recognize the power of the Social Security moniker. Their mailers boldly reference Social Security on the outside of the envelope, promising such things as a ``2001 Social Security Update,'' a ``Social Security Supplement Policy,'' or additional Social Security benefits. These ``teasers'' lure seniors into opening the mailing, often under the mistaken assumption that the mailing is somehow approved by, or affiliated with, the Social Security Administration. Typically, the mailers seek to disguise their true corporate origin. They will frequently use fictitious names such as ``Senior Services'' or acronyms such as ``USSS'' to further the ruse. Additionally, many mailings use Washington, D.C. street addresses or post office boxes in an attempt to confer ``official status'' on their deceptive mailings. By now, the confused senior simply succumbs and supplies the personal information allegedly requested by the Social Security Administration or some SSA-approved entity. This is a grave mistake. This information now falls into the unrestricted hands of these private operators. It is typically resold to insurance firms, mailing-list houses, and other companies pitching products to seniors. In the process, these predatory individuals, companies, and/or organizations can derive millions of dollars in revenue. Meanwhile, the senior has exposed himself or herself to potential identity theft, by parting with personal information such as date of birth, Social Security numbers (SSN), home telephone number, and home address. Our experience indicates that such organizations frequently treat such information as a commodity, rather than protecting its personal nature. Indeed, the irony is that if such information were provided directly to the Social Security Administration as intended, it would be protected under the Privacy Act. In reality, the senior has been tricked into providing their personal information to an organization dedicated to its unfettered sale and proliferation. Typically, the victims of such scams are elderly individuals who enjoy a trusting relationship with the Social Security Administration. Such advertisements cleverly play to their desire for more Social Security-related information or additional Social Security benefits. Indeed, many victims never even realize that they have been tricked into parting with their personal information--they just assume that the Social Security Administration never responded to their request for information. Investigative and Legal Strategies Since my appointment as Inspector General in November 1999, I have made fighting these scams a top investigative priority and, as a result, we have conducted major senior scam investigations. Two, in this past year, have resulted in the imposition of large civil penalties and permanent injunctions against the companies involved, and a third caused us to issue a nationwide alert about hoax flyers. In addition, our office receives many inquiries and reviews allegations relating to political fundraising solicitations that reference Social Security. I would like to briefly discuss each of these topics in turn. One of the most egregious scams perpetrated upon the elderly involves ``lead card'' mailings. Typically, this scam involves sending misleading solicitations to senior citizens nationwide. These solicitations trick seniors into thinking that such mailings originate from the Agency, or are approved or authorized by the Agency, in direct violation of the Social Security Act. In reality, the solicitations are nothing more than a come-on for the sale of private burial and other funeral related insurance. Case One: The Lead Agency, Inc. After receiving complaints about several companies engaged in this type of activity, we took immediate action in two landmark cases pursued under Section 1140 of the Social Security Act, the provision prohibiting the misleading use of Social Security words, symbols or emblems. On February 16, 2001, the United States Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Texas, settled a civil lawsuit filed in Federal court on behalf of our office against The Lead Agency, Inc. (The Lead Agency), a Texas Corporation. The Lead Agency was a private company that formerly sent direct mail solicitations to senior citizens that appeared to be from, or endorsed by, SSA. The direct mail solicitations offered to provide updated information on Social Security benefits, and used explicit terms like ``2000 Benefits Update'' to lure the seniors into completing the enclosed reply card. In response to these solicitations, senior citizens forwarded highly sensitive personal information to The Lead Agency. Unbeknownst to these seniors, The Lead Agency would then market this sensitive data to insurance companies and agents who would, in turn, solicit the seniors to purchase burial and other private insurance policies. The Lead Agency generated millions of dollars in revenue from the sale of this sensitive personal information. On November 13, 2000, U.S. District Judge Paul Brown issued a temporary restraining order (TRO), which authorized a modified workplace search of The Lead Agency, froze substantial corporate funds, and ordered the company to cease mailing the misleading solicitations. Pursuant to the final settlement reached in this case, The Lead Agency agreed to a permanent injunction barring them from violating Section 1140 of the Social Security Act. The company also agreed to pay $595,000 in civil monetary penalties to the Social Security Trust Fund. Additionally, the company agreed to formally dissolve its corporate charter. Case Two: United States Senior Services, Inc., et al. On April 12, 2001, Judge Brown entered a permanent injunction against a series of Texas businesses involved in a separate, but remarkably similar, scam. We learned that a corporate entity doing business as United States Senior Services, Inc. (U.S.S.S.), Acc-U-Lead, and Mass Mail Media had been sending misleading solicitations to senior citizens employing terms such as ``Social Security Update'' to create the false impression that the mailings were from, or endorsed by, SSA. Again, senior citizens were duped into sending sensitive personal information to a private company, which then sold the information to insurance companies and agents. After several unsuccessful attempts to bring the company into voluntary compliance, we, in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Texas, secured a TRO that authorized an administrative search of the business premises, detention of the corporate mail, and the freezing of corporate assets. The TRO also prevented the company from sending further misleading solicitations. The defendants ultimately agreed to pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty to the Social Security Trust Fund, and agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction, which prohibits future misleading mailings to senior citizens as they relate to Social Security. Case Three: OIG Nationwide Alert--Hoax Flyers As you are aware, we recently issued a nationwide alert to senior citizens urging them to exercise great caution when responding to solicitations promising additional Social Security payments. This alert followed a lengthy investigation, which confirmed that more than 29,000 elderly persons had been duped by hoax flyers promising $5,000 in additional Social Security benefit payments, an increase in monthly benefit amounts, and/or slave reparations from the Government. Recipients of the flyers provided their name, address, SSN, telephone number, and date of birth to a post office box listed on the flyers in hopes of receiving the funds. Many seniors were so thoroughly confused by the hoax flyers that they sent copies of identity documents, including Social Security cards, driver's licenses, birth certificates, and military papers along with the completed flyer. Along with the Postal Inspection Service, we initiated an investigation after our Fraud Hotline received nearly 100 fraud allegations on the hoax flyers. A review of these flyers revealed that a post office box address maintained by the TREA Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a tax-exempt organization that states it advocates for legislative reforms on behalf of senior citizens, was listed on all of the flyers. Consequently, we contacted TSCL, and learned that TSCL had at that time received over 18,000 individual responses to the flyers. We became concerned when we learned that TSCL had directed its data processing contractor to enter all of the victims' personal information into a database. TSCL then sent recipients of the flyers a letter denying any responsibility for the hoax that included a solicitation for funds to support TSCL's campaigns. We requested that TSCL discontinue the keying of personal information into its database, however TSCL refused to comply with this request. Therefore, we issued subpoenas to TSCL and its database firm to obtain all of the original responses in an attempt to determine the person, individual, or entity responsible for the creation and dissemination of the hoax flyers. TSCL disavowed any involvement with the hoax flyers, maintaining that they must have been disseminated by a well-intentioned, albeit confused, supporter. These hoax flyers appeared in churches, senior centers, nursing homes, magazines, newspapers, and local government offices nationwide. Because of the informal distribution channels employed, which included hand posting on cars and bulletin boards, we were unable to identify the source of the flyers. Although we were not able to link any individual or entity to the creation of the hoax flyers, the investigation served to highlight the vulnerability of senior citizens to exploitation by those who use inaccurate, misleading or false information to solicit money from them. Our alert advised seniors to contact SSA with questions regarding their benefits and to contact their representative in Congress with questions regarding pending legislation. Fundraising/Lobbying Perhaps the most challenging area of deceptive practices we have encountered with respect to mailings targeting the elderly are direct- mail fundraising solicitations. We recognize that there are nonprofit and charitable organizations that work for the benefit of the American public and it is not these groups that concern my office. The companies that we monitor are the exception--those who shield themselves with the First Amendment while using scare tactics and half-truths to solicit contributions from the population least likely to have such funds to spare. Often, these organizations use the same misleading words and phrases prohibited by Section 1140 of the Social Security Act to entice seniors into opening the mail. Once opened, the senior citizen is faced with urgent and inflammatory notices such as those that describe how the Social Security Trust Fund is being raided by politicians or those that inform the beneficiary that he or she is not receiving the appropriate benefit amount. The Social Security beneficiary is led to believe that the only way to preserve the Social Security Trust Fund, or to receive the correct benefit amount, is to send a contribution to sustain the fight. Time after time, frightened that their future earned benefits are in jeopardy, recipients of the mailings send their money to these organizations to support the cause. After all, better to spend $5, $10, or even $15 now than to risk losing the check from Social Security that most depend on for their livelihood. Frequently, my office receives inquiries from senior citizens regarding the legitimacy of various fundraising organizations that target seniors by focusing on Social Security issues. One senior wrote regarding a fundraising organization that she had been ``making payments to for a long time'' and, she reports, ``[t]hey keep pressing for more.'' See Exhibit 1. The concerned senior speculated that ``the news is not as serious as the company states it is'' and asked my office to advise her of the company's status. Such inquiries demonstrate how, at times, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate fundraising solicitations from scams. Scam mailings are often designed to resemble the inflammatory, yet constitutionally protected, fundraising solicitations that senior citizens are bombarded with daily. Although the OIG has pursued cases against political fundraising organizations where Social Security words and emblems are misused, our hands are tied when it comes to regulating the content of these mailings. For this reason, earlier this month we issued an alert advising seniors to contact their elected officials directly regarding legislation that may affect their Social Security benefits, rather than sending money time after time to intermediary organizations. Progress on Deceptive Mailings On May 14, 1992, this Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Oversight held a joint hearing to examine deceptive mailings and solicitations to senior citizens and other consumers. In addition to highlighting the magnitude and severity of the problem then, the two Subcommittees expressed concern that existing laws designed to address misleading solicitations targeting the elderly were not being enforced. Our office has made deceptive Social Security look-a-like mailings a top investigative priority. Through the judicious use of Cease and Desist letters, we have brought dozens of individuals, companies, and organizations into voluntary compliance with Section 1140 of the Act. In situations where such groups have refused to comply, we have imposed substantial civil monetary penalties against these chronic violators. See Exhibit 2. We have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to seek TROs, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions against chronic offenders who refuse to stop disseminating misleading mailings. In short, we have taken this Committee's request for more aggressive enforcement of Section 1140 extremely seriously. The impact of our enforcement efforts is readily apparent. We have seen a steady decline, since 1996, in the number of new individuals, companies, and organizations engaging in such deceptive SSA-related mailings generally. We have also seen a steady decline in the number of consumer complaints filed with our office about all types of deceptive SSA-related mailings. That said, there is still a core group of deceptive mailers who are unrelenting. Unfortunately, they have chosen senior citizens as their preferred target group. At times, we have been forced to dispatch teams of investigators to determine which entity or individual is ultimately responsible for these misleading mailings to seniors. These entities go to great lengths to disguise their identities and to frustrate potential Federal or State law enforcement activities. As evidenced by the three cases I previously described, the problem of deceptive mailings aimed at senior citizens is far from eradicated. We will continue our aggressive enforcement efforts until all of these senior scams have been exposed and terminated. Social Security's good name is based on decades of trust and good will--I will never permit swindlers to destroy the faith that America's seniors have placed in the Social Security Administration. I would like to thank this Committee for its continuing focus on this important problem. A lasting prevention campaign includes not only aggressive enforcement action, but also requires exposure of the problem accompanied by maximal public outreach. I am grateful for the enforcement tools that this Committee has provided under Section 1140 of the Social Security Act. We have tested these tools, with significant success in many instances. I also look forward to discussing any additional tools that this Committee may have under consideration. Quite simply, we need a continuously changing investigative and legislative arsenal to keep pace with today's misleading mailers. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I am available to answer any questions that you may have. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.027 Chairman Shaw. Thank you, Mr. Huse. In your testimony you state that the seniors who respond to misleading mailings often provide personal identifying information, such as Social Security number, date of birth, address, and so forth. Had this information been provided to the Social Security Administration, it would have been protected under the Privacy Act. But your experience indicates that these organizations treat this information as a commodity. This appears on page 4 of your testimony. What have you learned about what happens to the information collected? Is it sold? To whom is it sold? What specific information is being sold? Once the information is sold, how is it used? And I would like for you to also, in your answer, customize your answer to TREA organization, who will be with us later this afternoon, so they will have an opportunity to respond. Mr. Huse. Well, Mr. Chairman, speaking generally about how this information is used by the people who garner it, there is a commercial opportunity here. These databases and the information that are contained in them have value to companies that are interested in marketing products and services to seniors: insurance companies; medical service companies; in some instances, cemeteries and funeral directors; all people with an interest in providing goods and services to seniors. But these are automatically, because they have been gathered together and they are already definitely a target audience, a quick step into the opportunity to do this. They also have a big value to telemarketers, because if you are representing some of these products and services, here you have a target audience that has already been set up for you. So this is a big business. Now, if you take all of this and you put it into the context of today's information age, you have another dimension, because in the hands of unscrupulous people, this information can be misused to create false identities. And ultimately, the original person providing their identifying data can easily become a victim. So those are concerns. In the last case I discussed, TREA issue, at the point that these hoax flyers were responded to, and we know that there were 29,000 responses that we seized as a result of our investigative efforts, as a result of the issuance of our subpoena. That information---- Chairman Shaw. You had to issue the subpoena to get that information. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Shaw. OK. Mr. Huse. We know that information was put into a database that TSCL had a contractor maintain for them. Now, what we don't know is what they did with that at all. They will have to answer as to what happened to that data. At the point our investigation ended, we know that the data went to them, and they have some representations as to what they did with it. But we have no knowledge of what they did with it. Chairman Shaw. As a nonprofit corporation, they have to file their income tax publicly? Mr. Huse. That is correct. Chairman Shaw. They have to disclose that. But does that organization have subsidiaries that are not required to expose their income tax return to the public? Or affiliated companies? Mr. Huse. My sense is they do, but I just wanted to check with our investigative team. Mr. Chairman, I am informed that they do not. The subsidiaries do not have to file under our tax laws. Chairman Shaw. And they are for-profit? Mr. Huse. No. The subsidiaries are not-for-profit. Chairman Shaw. They are not-for-profit but they don't have to file publicly. I am either misunderstanding your answer or don't understand where we are going with this. Mr. Huse. The big tent agency that they are all subsidiaries of has to make a public filing, but they do not. Chairman Shaw. Well, do you know if they are a for-profit or not-for-profit organizations? Mr. Huse. They purport to be---- Chairman Shaw. What determines that the lead organization has to file its income tax publicly? Mr. Huse. I am not competent to answer that question, because I am not a tax expert. Chairman Shaw. We can explore that. Mr. Huse. But we do know that TREA is a nonprofit agency under the tax law and makes a filing. TSCL also purports to be nonprofit, or says its nonprofit, but they don't file, to our knowledge. Chairman Shaw. We can certainly find out about that, with that distinction. I think it is important to note here also that TREA is a Federally chartered corporation. Mr. Huse. That is correct. TREA stands for The Retired Enlisted Association. Chairman Shaw. How did the ``T'' get on there? Mr. Huse. The ``T'' stands for ``The.'' They just took the phrase ``The Retired Enlisted Association'' and made an acronym out of it. Chairman Shaw. It sounds like an abbreviation for ``Treasury,'' doesn't it? Mr. Huse. It does. It is very close to that. Chairman Shaw. Mr. Matsui. Mr. Matsui. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Huse, let me just understand this. TREA is a Federally sponsored organization. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. It has a congressional charter to conduct its activities. Mr. Matsui. Exactly. But the senior citizen council, TREA Senior Citizens League, is separate. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. It is a sub-function or an entity that derived from TREA, but it is a separate entity. Mr. Matsui. Right. So there are two separate entities that one is, not a subsidiary, but one is a member of TREA, right? The senior citizen council? Is that correct? Mr. Huse. Right, TREA has the Senior Citizens League as part of its array of its---- Mr. Matsui. Because TREA has other organizations as part of it. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Matsui. OK. So we are really talking about the senior citizen council here, in terms of---- Mr. Huse. Exactly. Mr. Matsui. Activities that you did your investigation on. Mr. Huse. The Senior Citizens League was the focus of our investigative efforts. Mr. Matsui. Yes. And not TREA? Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Matsui. OK. And TREA has very little to do with this. And when you mention that this is a congressionally sponsored organization, you have set that aside, right, because that is not the subject---- Mr. Huse. Only in the sense or the context that it is the parent organization. Mr. Matsui. Exactly. But I want to make sure, so that people understand that TREA is not involved in the discussions we are having about possibly fraudulent documents being sent out to senior citizens. Mr. Huse. Right. Mr. Matsui. OK. Mr. Huse. Correct, sir. Mr. Matsui. It is the Senior Citizens League or TREA Senior Citizens League--is that correct--that we are talking about? Mr. Huse. The Senior Citizens League belongs to TREA. Mr. Matsui. I understand that. But it is a separate entity. Mr. Huse. And is a separate entity. Mr. Matsui. And Mr. George Smith is a current executive director of the organization. Mr. Huse. Right. Correct. Mr. Matsui. Now, let me ask you, how many people did you--I want to just set the record straight--how many people did you have from the inspector general's office actually on the investigation on this issue? And then second, how many hours do you estimate you spent on this issue? Mr. Huse. This will be an estimate---- Mr. Matsui. Sure. Mr. Huse. Because I didn't really---- Mr. Matsui. No, no. I understand that. Mr. Huse. I would say probably a dozen or more individuals worked on this, attorneys and investigators, over the period of almost 1 year. Mr. Matsui. But your activities are not to find criminal fraud. Your activities are to try to uncover perhaps fraudulent activities and misleading information sent to senior citizens in this particular situation. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. Initially, our investigation began with complaints to our hotline. And you are correct, we began to look at the nature of those complaints. Mr. Matsui. Exactly. Mr. Huse. But the investigation--and we have the power to take that onto the focus of the United States Criminal Code--we looked at the possibility of criminal fraud. And our investigation came to a point where we had exhausted all leads, and then we closed it. Mr. Matsui. Mainly because everybody denied complicity of this, like no one could really say who was the one who originated this idea and made it happen. Mr. Huse. That is true. But we also employed all of the array of investigative techniques that we would normally employ, to include forensic examination in laboratories of the flyers to see if there were any leads that could be garnered by forensic sciences as to the origin. But we came up empty on that---- Mr. Matsui. But you don't have the tools of subpoenaing somebody before a grand jury, so that they would have to testify under oath, or those kinds of tools that law enforcement agencies have. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. Well, actually, we do. Mr. Matsui. Oh, you do. Mr. Huse. If we had got to--and as you understand, we would have to come to some threshold where we would bring that to---- Mr. Matsui. Have you reached that threshold in this situation? Mr. Huse. Well, no. And I don't think anyone ever will. We worked with the Department of Justice as we went through this. We had an assistant United States attorney working with us as we conducted this investigation always looking for that, because that would be a focus, if we got there. Mr. Matsui. Then you are the focus of part of my attention today, then. Mr. Huse. OK, that is fine. Mr. Matsui. I am going to run out of time, but we have Mr. Smith, we have Michael Zabko, we have Maurice ``Chip'' Heart- field, who has stress problems now, so he will not appear, Christy Turner. I understand Maurice ``Chip'' Heartfield, the president of Squire & Heartfield Direct--that is a direct mail firm, right? Is that right? Mr. Huse. I apologize. Could you ask that part---- Mr. Matsui. Well, we have Maurice ``Chip'' Heartfield, president of Squire & Heartfield Direct. That is a direct mail firm, and Mr. Heartfield is the president of that firm. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. They are a marketing firm. Mr. Matsui. Marketing firm. Mr. Huse. And it is correct. Mr. Matsui. They are the ones that sent the mail out. Mr. Huse. Right. Correct. Mr. Matsui. I don't know whether this is the subject of an open hearing; I have to be somewhat careful. But Mr. Heartfield must have talked to somebody at the Senior Citizens League about sending this material out. And do you know who that person he may have talked to, to get permission to send this material out, this slave reparations flyers and also the notch flyer? Mr. Huse. They deny any involvement with flyers whatsoever. Mr. Matsui. Well, is there some employee that you talked to at Squire & Heartfield that could say, ``Yes, I sent it out''? I mean, there would have to be a pyramid here. Mr. Huse. And those interviews were conducted. But in all cases, and we exhausted every possible lead with all of the entities involved, there was a total disavowal. I know where-- -- Mr. Matsui. Yes, you know where I am going. Mr. Huse. I do. Mr. Matsui. I mean, I can't understand it. I mean, you have a room full of people and everyone denies--they admit they sent it out, but no one can say, ``Yes, this is the person who authorized me to send it out''? Mr. Huse. They say that no one authorized the---- Mr. Matsui. See, this seems to me where you should take somebody to a grand jury and have them say this under oath. I mean, there has to be something in here that--I mean, you can't have this happen. And I am not putting it on you. Mr. Huse. No, no. Mr. Matsui. I am just saying that this is not the way---- Mr. Huse. But there was a decision made, during the course of the investigation, that if in the judgment of the Justice Department they wanted to take it to a grand jury, they could have, based on the evidence we had. But I don't think that threshold, in their minds, was present. Mr. Matsui. OK. I don't want to get involved in a criminal investigation. That is almost improper. On the other hand---- Mr. Huse. But just as long as you are clear that we conducted this from both contexts: a criminal investigation and a civil investigation. We were looking to have it go wherever it went from the leads we---- Mr. Matsui. I am not too sure of that. I mean, that is where my problem is. And I don't know where your threshold is, and maybe we need to have a private conversation. I don't mean to say ``private.'' I mean a conversation, just not in a public---- Mr. Huse. I understand. Mr. Matsui. Because I don't want to do any damage to individuals that should not be damaged. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Matsui. And I am sorry. I know my time has run out. But somehow, you know, you can't have 50 people or 20 people all deny complicity, when their own office sent it out, and not be able to find out how the senior citizen council instructed somebody at this marketing firm to send out this information that was false and fraudulent. I don't know how we cannot find that out. I mean, a lot of folks are going to get away with criminal activity. Mr. Huse. They never admitted that they sent anything out. That was our problem. I am being careful, too. Mr. Matsui. All right, I understand. But you know it came from their office, though? Mr. Huse. We know that the hoax flyers contained their address for the responses by anyone who chose to respond to those flyers. And those are over as one of the exhibits over there. Their address is on the bottom. [The exhibits follow:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5753A.005 Mr. Matsui. And let me just--29,000 people apparently sent---- Mr. Huse. They took advantage of those flyers---- Mr. Matsui. Right. Mr. Huse. And sent them to these people. Mr. Matsui. And then sent it to the Senior Citizens League. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Matsui. And the Senior Citizens League then put it in their computers and then made direct solicitation of these people for additional money. Mr. Huse. Right. Mr. Matsui. And then some people then sent money back to the---- Mr. Huse. In the process of the direct solicitation, though, in the literature that went back to all of the people who filled those flyers out, they called those flyers a hoax. And this brings us to this huge gray area we have here, in terms of these kinds of activities, because they are complex and troubling. Mr. Matsui. Thank you. My time has run out. And I appreciate this, but we may need to further inquire here. Mr. Huse. Yes, sir. Mr. Matsui. Thank you. Chairman Shaw. Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Huse, we don't know who sent the flyers out, but we know that when the flyers were returned with the funds, those flyers were used, put into the database. Can they be held responsible for using those flyers in that way? If they are not the ones who sent them out, mailed them out, placed them around the different communities, can they be held responsible for using them? Mr. Huse. Not under the existing law. And that is a good question, but no. Mr. Lewis. What happened to the information in the database? How was that used? Mr. Huse. With specific focus on TSCL, the Senior Citizens League, we don't know what they did with their database information. For a fact, we don't know. They have made some representations that they stopped that activity, but that is a question to put to them. We don't know. At the point we closed our investigation, we don't know the disposition of that database. Mr. Lewis. Can you theorize what type of supporter it would have been that took these flyers and disseminated them? Who were these---- Mr. Huse. Who were the people that answered, the 29,000 people? Mr. Lewis. No; who handed the flyers out, that placed them in the different communities. Mr. Huse. Well, we found that these flyers were distributed nationwide, so they had a wide broadcast on these. But we never found any person that we were able to talk to. And these were the kinds of flyers that when you come out of church on Sunday would be on your windshield or perhaps in the back of a senior citizens center. They just appeared there. And some of the dissemination or broadcast of these was accidental, where people thought, ``Hey, this a $5,000 benefit coming to me. I had better let Mabel know down the street.'' Like all Xerox copies, we don't know which generation Xerox copy we have. But nevertheless, somewhere they began. And every single one of them contained the information block on the bottom, where to send your name if you wanted to be included on these registries that were purported to be established for obtaining either the notch benefit on the one hand or the slave reparation benefit on the other. I hope that was responsive. Mr. Lewis. It is just---- Mr. Huse. I know. There is a gap. Mr. Lewis. Right. Mr. Huse. And there is a credibility gap there. Mr. Lewis. Yes. Mr. Huse. I admit that. I found it difficult trying to deal with that myself. Mr. Lewis. Thousands of these flyers are out there, and the gap between TSCL and those who disseminated those flyers, it seems like we could nail that down. Thank you. Chairman Shaw. Mr. Becerra. Excuse me. I have been corrected. Mr. Doggett was here when we started. Mr. Doggett. Mr. Doggett. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. If I understand correctly, all of the fraud that was committed here was done exclusively in the name of TREA Senior Citizens League. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. Again, they---- Mr. Doggett. It was done in their name. Mr. Huse. It was done in their name. Mr. Doggett. They do not claim responsibility, but it was all done---- Mr. Huse. It was done in their name. Mr. Doggett. Under their name. Mr. Huse. Although they claim they committed no fraud. Mr. Doggett. All right. TREA Senior Citizens League claims that no fraud was committed by anyone here? Mr. Huse. They recognize that the flyers were a hoax, so there was a fraud committed, but it is not their fault. Mr. Doggett. They don't deny that there was fraud. They don't deny that the fraud was committed exclusively in their name. But they do deny they were responsible for this fraud. Is that a fair summary? Mr. Huse. It is a fair summary, and I would say very well- put. Mr. Doggett. And is it also correct that TREA Senior Citizens League, based on your investigation, benefited financially from the fraud that they admit was committed here? Mr. Huse. Yes; they did. Correct. Mr. Doggett. And I believe you have testified in your written testimony unequivocally to that effect, and Ms. Lorna Daniels, who we will hear from momentarily, has also testified in her written testimony that she was one of the victims who forwarded money to them. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Doggett. But for some reason, Mr. George Smith, the executive director of TREA Senior Citizens League, has denied that they benefited financially in his written testimony. Is that also correct? Mr. Huse. I haven't seen his written testimony, sir. Mr. Doggett. Well, I guess we will hear from him shortly. But that is how I read page 8 of his testimony. As far as the relationship between TREA and TREA Senior Citizens League, I believe that TREA benefits financially from the activities of TREA Senior Citizens League. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. I don't know that for a fact. I would assume that because of their relationship. Mr. Doggett. Well, if you could comment further on their relationship, do they have any common board members, employees or officers? Mr. Huse. Yes. Mr. Doggett. Would you describe those for me? Let's begin with board members. Mr. Huse. We don't have that with us right now. We can respond to that later. Or if you could---- Mr. Doggett. Well, does article 20 of TREA Senior Citizens League proscribe some commonality between the two? Mr. Huse. Our understanding is that TSCL, the Senior Citizens League, pays a fee to TREA to allow its connection with them. Whether there are common board members, I don't know that. Mr. Doggett. Well, as I read section 2 of article 20: ``Control and management of TREA Senior Citizens League shall be vested in the board of trustees consisting of at least seven members elected or appointed by TREA's national board of directors. That would suggest to me that they are a wholly owned subsidiary of TREA.'' Mr. Huse. Based on our analysis, the position of treasurer may be common to both of the boards, but that is---- Mr. Doggett. Well, it does also say that TREA treasurer may be appointed treasurer of TSCL. But isn't it correct that under article 20 of TREA Senior Citizens League that seven of their members are elected or appointed by TREA national board of directors? Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Doggett. Well, then don't the two seem to be one and the same. I mean, they may have established a separate legal entity, just like some private corporation may have a wholly owned subsidiary, but I don't see the distinction in reality between the two. Mr. Huse. Neither do I. But that is, that particular---- Mr. Doggett. We have a congressionally chartered entity that has a wholly owned subsidiary that admits there was fraud here, admits it was done exclusively in its own name, does not admit, though your investigation concluded that they benefited financially from the fraud, and this is a charter that was issued by the Congress to this organization that is described as having been involved here. Mr. Huse. These may be distinctions without a difference. Mr. Doggett. Distinctions without any real meaning. Mr. Huse. But they are distinctions that are allowable under the law. And they make it extremely difficult, in the context of this kind of an investigation, especially where you are brushing up against what are really very possible First amendment activities, in terms of representing citizens' rights and so forth. So we are rather circumspect. But there is no better statement of what you have here for a relationship than the one you made. Mr. Doggett. Just in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, as a former judge, you won't find a more vigorous defender of the First amendment, but I don't think this has anything to do with the First amendment. I think is has to do with defrauding seniors. Mr. Huse. I meant from---- Mr. Doggett. I understand that is the argument that you have heard. Mr. Huse. The difference we have to have as a criminal investigative function---- Mr. Doggett. Of course. Mr. Huse. Looking at these activities, you need to be very careful how you couch---- Mr. Doggett. From your activities, is there any legislation or any changes in our laws in any way that you believe would be helpful in preventing the defrauding of seniors like this in the future? Mr. Huse. Well, we have some tools that come from the Social Security Independence Act that have helped us get to this point. Those tools, in the civil money penalty area, need to be strengthened. And some of those are proposed, I believe, in our legislative requests to the Committee. Mr. Doggett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Chairman Shaw. Mr. Brady. Mr. Brady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, as well, for holding this important hearing. And we have a number of people and organizations here to testify today. I think it is important that we not paint all of the organizations with the same broad brush. But specifically, for TREA Senior Citizens League, just so I understand this in real life, their address mysteriously appeared on two separate senior-targeted flyers. Mr. Huse. Correct, sir. Mr. Brady. And their response was not simply to warn those seniors that this was a hoax. Their response was to warn them and to solicit them for money. Is that correct? Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Brady. So they didn't simply warn the seniors. They said let's see if we can make some money off this. And so there is apparently a difference between a fraud that hurts you and a fraud that makes you some moolah? Is that correct? [Laughter.] And in effect, claiming to be good Samaritans, they simply ran up to the mugging victim and offered to sell them a new purse. [Laughter.] Is that sort of what happened here? Mr. Huse. It is what happened. But we have to be careful about establishing what the financial benefit was, because we don't know. Their claim is there was a very minimal financial benefit. But at the point our investigation ended--and it ended because we had exhausted all remedies we had at that time. Mr. Brady. Sure. Mr. Huse. Now, we didn't go beyond that and get into the actual finances to establish whether it was minimal or great. Mr. Brady. Sure. Mr. Huse. We don't know. Mr. Brady. Well, we are going to get a chance to hear from them today. Thank you for your work. I guess what bothers me the most is we have a congressionally chartered rip-off of our seniors. And I hope, Mr. Chairman, that this Committee takes a hard look at this congressional charter, to see if it, in fact, stands up to how it was originally granted. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Shaw. Thank you, Mr. Brady. Congressional charters are no longer issued. And it was problems arising out of instances like this that was the reason that Congress quit doing it. But I think probably the Judiciary Committee should really have a hearing and look very carefully into all federally granted charters to see how they are being used. Some of them are being used very well, and then others you would be a little bit concerned about, because it is almost like a seal of approval of some sort. Mr. Becerra. Mr. Becerra. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for bringing this to the public's attention, not just the Members of Congress. And to Mr. Huse, thank you very much for the investigation. And hopefully we can continue to pursue this, because we are certainly not done. Let me ask a question with regard to the number of responses that were received as a result of these flyers: 29,000 responses were received by the Senior Citizens League. Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Becerra. I don't know if you have any sense of many responses you usually receive to these types of solicitations, but the response rate is certainly less than 50 percent. It is usually a fraction of what is sent out. Mr. Huse. Right. Mr. Becerra. So if 29,000 responses were received, there must have been 10 times, perhaps even more, of these flyers sent out throughout the nation. How likely is it that a hoax like this, where 29,000 responses were received--not sent, but received, so obviously more were sent--how likely is it that a hoax like this could have been independently conducted by a number of different, unrelated players? Mr. Huse. We both know it flies in the fact of reason to think that something was nationwide broadcast and distribution of these flyers without some kind of organizational effort being involved. Mr. Becerra. It likely is, then, that this was a concerted, orchestrated effort by a particular entity. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Becerra. You report that you could not determine the actual source of the flyer. Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Becerra. And you also report the Senior Citizens League, TREA Senior Citizens League, maintains that this was probably the action of a well-intentioned supporter. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Becerra. Did the Senior Citizens League ever give you any reason to believe that there was some well-intentioned supporter that may have done this? Did they explain what they meant by that? Mr. Huse. They meant that it was an accident, that someone who hewed closely to their efforts got off on some kind of a distracted activity and promulgated this hoax. Mr. Becerra. Are they speculating or are they saying that they knew this to be the case, that some well-intentioned supporter---- Mr. Huse. It was couched in the form of speculation. No one ever produced a name or a person that might have been responsible. Mr. Becerra. And so this would have to have been, if the explanation that the Senior Citizens League gave were to be considered reliable, we would have to assume that there was some well-intentioned supporter who was willing to send out tens of thousands of these flyers throughout the nation. Mr. Huse. All exactly the same. Mr. Becerra. That is a very well-intentioned supporter who probably could support the entire activities of the Senior Citizens League without having to go out there to solicit money from fixed-income seniors. Let me ask another question. TREA Senior Citizens League indicates in some press statements that it sent out that it made efforts to try to help the Social Security Administration, your agency, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in trying to determine who did this, to help in the investigation. They posted advisories on their Web site, claiming that they had reported the scam to the SSA and that they were working with you and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to identify the origins of the flyer. Did they do as they indicated? Did they go out there and cooperate with you to try to make this possible? Mr. Huse. I don't doubt that they posted something on their Web site, although I never looked at the Web site to see what it was. I wouldn't count the relationship during the course of this investigation with them as helpful to the course of our investigation. They opposed our subpoena process at every opportunity. Mr. Becerra. So let me make sure about something. They say that they were trying to help. When you requested documents, first you probably did so informally without any legal document or subpoena. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Becerra. Did they help? Mr. Huse. No. Mr. Becerra. And even when you did say, ``Well, if you are not going to give it to me informally, as a friendly matter, now we are going to issue subpoenas,'' did they help and provide the documents you requested as a result of the first subpoenas? Mr. Huse. As was their right, they attempted to quash the subpoena. Mr. Becerra. Quash meaning to stop enforcement of the subpoena. Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Becerra. And did you have to go to Federal court to actually enforce some of these subpoenas? Mr. Huse. Yes. Yes, we did. Mr. Becerra. So you had to go to Federal district court to get the Senior Citizens League to fulfill the requirements of the subpoenas you issued upon them, even though on the Web site they indicate that they were working hand in hand with the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service to try and get this thing resolved. Mr. Huse. The subpoenas that were contested in court were the subpoenas we issued to their database company and their marketing company. TREA subpoena was not opposed. Mr. Becerra. I see. Mr. Huse. I am being very specific. Mr. Becerra. I understand. Mr. Chairman, one last question, if I may. Because you have turned to the marketing, and as you already indicated in some other responses, TREA and TREA Senior Citizens League, which now has been clarified as pretty much being one and the same, have indicated that they had nothing to do with that solicitation. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Becerra. Yet when that information from the 29,000 people who responded came in, private information, very personal information, they started recording it in their database. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Becerra. And at the same time that they were issuing responses to these 29,000 people that responded, saying, ``We have nothing to do with that initial mailer,'' they were also including solicitations themselves, saying, ``Please contribute to our activities to help you.'' Mr. Huse. Right. Correct. Mr. Becerra. So while they claim that they did not have any responsibility for the initial fraudulent mailer, they took advantage of the 29,000 people who did respond, to try to now solicit them in a more legitimate fashion. Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Becerra. All right, thank you very much. Mr. Huse. It was a windfall promotion. Mr. Becerra. Perhaps, Mr. Chairman, the best thing that is going to come out of this hearing, because I don't think we are going to resolve everything here, is a statement, a notice, a warning, to seniors: Buyer beware. This goes on all the time. Mr. Huse. Which is what led us to the point of issuing the national press release on the hoax portion, even though we were disappointed with the results of our investigation. Mr. Becerra. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Shaw. Mr. Ryan. Mr. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this very, very important hearing. Mr. Huse, I would like to ask you, just to try and get a big picture here, we already established through prior questions that 29,000 people responded to the hoax flyers, correct? Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Ryan. They put the data in the database, sent back a mailing saying, ``We reject these hoax flyers,'' and then they put a solicitation in there, correct? Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Ryan. Have you established whether they have sold that database, sold those mailing lists or not? Mr. Huse. We have not established that. And the information, we understand, is they say they have not. Mr. Ryan. They say they have not. Now, I think a townhall meeting doesn't go by were probably any of us have these townhall meeting where a senior citizen born between 1917 and 1926, the notch years, comes up to us and says, they get this mailing, they are sending $10, $15, $20 a month sometimes to this group that promises to restore their benefits. My colleague, Congressman Kleczka, has provided the Committee with an example of these documents that seems like what they do is, they send us a postcard, a postcard that probably costs a bulk mail stamp rate of about 14 cents, saying, ``Please support efforts to restore the notch,'' and that is about all of the lobbying they. I have never once met somebody up here on Capitol Hill, and we are on the Social Security Subcommittee, lobbying on behalf of this organization to ``fix the notch.'' So it seems as if they are making these solicitations, asking for $5, $8, $10, $15; they send us only a postcard; and pocket the rest of the money and sell these mailing lists. Is that essentially what you have seen from the organization? Mr. Huse. That is correct. I have an aunt that does the same thing, that is a notch baby, and who falls into the category of people who respond to these and has interest in it. Mr. Ryan. Right. And so the goal of a direct mail operation is to grow and expand the list as much as possible, correct? And it has become, I think you mentioned in your opening statement, a commodity that good mailing lists are a commodity because they have respondents that will pony up. Mr. Huse. I would say, in today's age, especially with the kind information technology we have, somebody could tell you how to price a database like this, but I am sure it has great commercial value. We know that as a result of notch activities, TSCL has made $35 million in the last 3 years almost exclusively on notch issue solicitation. Mr. Ryan. On its notch mailings? Mr. Huse. That is correct. Mr. Ryan. Thirty-five million dollars? Mr. Huse. That is right. That is in their tax statements. Mr. Ryan. Have you analyzed what kind of efforts they do to promote passage of notch legislation here on Capitol Hill? The question I am asking is, they bring in $35 million. All we ever see is a little postcard that probably cost them 14 cents in bulk stamps. It is a tiny, little post card. And that is the extent that I and any other Member of Congress I have ever spoken to about this has seen of their efforts to promote notch legislation. $35 million--where is the rest of that money going? Mr. Huse. We did not investigate that. And I would take that charge on if you assign it to me, but that is not one that I took in this instance. Mr. Ryan. I think that is something that we will definitely be looking into. Going on, back to the flyers and the dissemination of the flyers, they are claiming that it was a misinformed, confused, well-intentioned volunteer, acting on their own volition to put out these flyers and to have the mail go back to their post office box. Correct? Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Ryan. And this was disseminated across the country? Mr. Huse. It appeared all over the United States. Mr. Ryan. A lot of times, when you are organizing such a very organized dissemination of some kind of thing like this, oftentimes groups will hire temporary workers. They will go to Manpower or some local temporary agency and hire temps to disseminate these flyers. Have you, in your investigation, notified or found evidence of any temps being hired to disseminate these flyers? Mr. Huse. We looked for that type of lead, and we were not able to find anyone responsible. Mr. Ryan. Have you questioned anybody who has handed out these flyers? Mr. Huse. Yes, we have. Mr. Ryan. And what did they say? Where did they get their instructions? Mr. Huse. Well, unfortunately, the people we were able to find were people who got generations of the flyers---- Mr. Ryan. OK, so they---- Mr. Huse. And they weren't sure. They were just spreading the word, because the $5,000 benefit was too good not to want to get on this registry of potential recipients. Mr. Ryan. And your investigation is still open and you are still looking for the source of dissemination. Who is that well-intentioned, confused volunteer? Mr. Huse. Our investigation was closed at the point we issued the national alert, but I am beginning to think I had better reopen it. Mr. Ryan. I think so. Mr. Huse. I mean, we could reopen it. Mr. Ryan. I think it is important. And, you know, I have been doing this ever since I got in Congress, telling people: Don't send these groups your money. They are not looking at your best interests. Senior citizens are literally--I hear this all the time-- are sending $15 a month to this group because they think that is going to get their notch benefit. And actually, the flyer that my colleague from Wisconsin gave us says right here, you check in a box: Compensation preference, check one. Would you like a $5,000 award in four annual payments of $1,250 or a monthly increase in your Social Security benefits? It is as if this going to come if you just send us some more money, and we will get your notch benefits restored. I would like to know, and if you could take a look at analyzing the level of their lobbying on Capitol Hill, and their express advocacy on behalf of passage of this legislation. The Social Security Administration determines and Congress determines how these benefits get sent out, if they are ever given out. It is legal to send this kind of a mailing out, isn't it? Mr. Huse. Correct. Mr. Ryan. It is. It is legal. It may not be ethical, but it is legal. Mr. Huse. It is legal. Chairman Shaw. Which mailing are we talking about, Mr. Ryan? Mr. Huse. It is not legal to send out a hoax, but it is legal to solicit direct mail---- Chairman Shaw. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. Ryan. Yes, I will yield. Chairman Shaw. If the gentleman would yield for a minute, these flyers that we have looked at, talking about the slave reparations act and these sort of things---- Mr. Huse. That is a hoax. That is clearly illegal. Chairman Shaw. You find out who did that, that is criminal activity. Mr. Huse. That is criminal activity. And if we found a person responsible for promulgating that activity, we would charge them under the United States Code. Mr. Ryan. But there are also legal mailings that this group is putting out, sending to seniors, acting for direct mail solicitations, something like the solicitation that was included in the response to the hoax list that may not be illegal but is unethical, where they raised purportedly $35 million from. It is important, I think, to look at the whole, big picture here. And it seems like an effort is under way to just grow and grow and grow a mailing list, sell the mailing list, and also reap more money off of the direct mail solicitations. Mr. Huse. Mr. Chairman, if it is the Committee's charge on any of these issues, we will certainly follow up on any of the matters that are still open, and I go back to some of the other, earlier questioning. But you can count on that. Mr. Ryan. I see my time has expired. Thank you. Chairman Shaw. I would like I think to follow up to what Mr. Ryan was just saying. It is interesting to look at the income tax return, which Mr. Kleczka brought in, for TREA Senior Citizens League filed for the year 2000, in which it shows, in looking at the expenses, it shows the income in excess of $12 million and just about all of it went out to solicitation: over $2 million for printing and publishing, over $3 million for postage and shipping, and professional fundraising, $1.5 million. I don't see anything on here which would be of any benefit, any of the expenditures here, which would be of any benefit to the people who have sent in the money. It just doesn't appear that their money was spent that way. So it seems like it is just a solicitation machine. That is the appearance that it would give to me by looking at their return. Mr. Pomeroy. Mr. Pomeroy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My colleagues have covered the ground very, very well, and I don't mean to go back over things already covered. I am very interested in the panels to follow. One area of question I would have is, to whom are these lists marketed? Did you do an investigation into that? Mr. Huse. These lists, and I am going to the earlier cases I discussed, because I don't know anything about TSCL's use of their database, but in other mailing activity, the two cases I talked about in my testimony, those lists were sold to insurance companies that are looking to send---- Mr. Pomeroy. Stop right there. I used to be a State insurance commissioner, and I am wondering whether you explored whether or not insurance companies acquiring lists or purchasing lists from groups that used fraudulent means to assemble those lists violates State laws in some way. Mr. Huse. I am certain they do, and maybe the Arkansas attorney general consumer people that follow me can speak to that. But it clearly would violate Federal law. Mr. Pomeroy. I would like you to use subpoena power in the IG's office to find out what insurance companies are acquiring these lists, lists assembled through fraud and deception. I believe that the State regulators in those States ought to commence activities against those insurance companies. I would hope any insurance company paying any attention to this hearing at all ought to understand that when they acquire lists for purposes of going out and trying to sell policies, they are going to be held accountable for the practices used by those assembling those lists. And they may be buying a whole lot of trouble in addition to the lead lists, if they are not dealing with reputable outfits. Mr. Huse. We will respond---- Mr. Pomeroy. Will you get me---- Mr. Huse. We will. Mr. Pomeroy. You will proceed? You will find out the insurance companies? And I personally would like to know, as a Committee member, those insurance companies so I might contact the regulators of those companies. Mr. Huse. We will respond to you, sir.
