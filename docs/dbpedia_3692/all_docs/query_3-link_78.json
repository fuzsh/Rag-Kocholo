        "text": "We had a wet n’ wild blast at Atlantis Aquaventure during our stay at the amazing family resort in Dubai – Atlantis the Palm. We all can’t wait to go back to one of the biggest water parks in the world for more water coasters and body slides. It even holds a Guinness World Record for having the most water slides in a park. After running wild there for 10 days with two little ones, I can tell you all about Atlantis Aquaventure: what you need to know before visiting… what NOT to bring, how to avoid the lines and crowds, toddler and safety tips, and more.\n\nAs a certified travel advisor, I can also get you discounted tickets for the park, dolphin experiences and more! Usually it’s about a 15% discount, which really adds up!\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, I may earn a small commission if you use a link below to make a purchase. I appreciate your support for my site. Thank you!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGeneral Tips\n\nBaby and Toddler Tips\n\nSafety Tips\n\nHow to Book Tickets and Experiences\n\nGeneral Tips\n\nThe early bird gets the…\n\nWwwaterslide, without long lines that is. The earlier, the better.\n\nStay in the hotel as a guest, so you can get to the park early. Read all about our unforgettable stay at Atlantis the Palm if you’re not sure. Then email me if you have questions or before you book it, as I have access to discounted rates and perks as a travel advisor (my services are free for booking hotels, as the commission is built in already).\n\nI think it’s worth it to bust your butt to get there when those pearly gates open. It gets pretty crowded by late morning in the kid’s areas, and even earlier at the slides.\n\nThis was probably around 10am. It gets much busier than this, ohhh believe me.\n\nThe least crowded water slides are those closest to the new(ish) Royal towers (e.g. Trident Tower in the bottom right of the map below). You have to try Vortex and Blackout, my personal favorites in that area. The lines grew longer as the day and week went on of course.\n\nIf you are a true thrill seeker, then Leap of Faith and Poseidon’s Revenge are where it’s at. I conquered Leap of Faith in my younger years, ya know, 30, and I just didn’t feel the need to do it again.\n\nTake note if you are not the thrill seeker you once were… I wanted revenge on my husband after I tried Poseidon’s Revenge, the slide that he said I just had to try. As I stood on the platform waiting to be dropped, yes literally, down the plastic tube, I went through every scenario of what could possibly go wrong, the newspaper headline, the…until it was too late. Luckily, reality beat my imagination that day.\n\nOur taller than average five-year-old was able to ride the group slide, Zoomerango, with us – what a blast we had together! He was a bit nervous in line but ended up doing it six more times after. He’s a McFadden, of course he loved it!\n\nThe protective mama in me had my leg locked over his leg, my hand over his hand, while we held on for dear life. I’m sure someone will comment below saying that I caused more harm than good. But he was over the height requirement, so there!\n\nZoomerango and Poseidon’s Revenge are in Poseidon Tower. There is also a shallow zero entry pool next to that tower, where the kids played while my husband and I took solo turns torturing ourselves.\n\nCheck out the map below of the entire Atlantis Aquaventure Water Park:\n\nWater shoes\n\nThey provide Aquasocks (Atlantis-approved water ‘shoes’) for FREE!!! They were a lifesaver because the water shoes that I brought for the kids weren’t allowed on the slides. The water socks they give you are literally like ankle socks – they are that thin. A lifeguard said that the material on standard water shoes prevents you from sliding so it’s a safety hazard (and would be too slow for me!).\n\nThe Aquasocks counter is on the right, about 150 feet past the entrance.\n\nTo walk through the park, I’d wear something with more cushion, like these crocs and better-priced knock off crocs from Amazon. Although now I wish I had seen these Peppa Pig crocs before I bought these cute pink ones from Walmart.\n\nLeave the Moolah in the Room-ah\n\nYou’ll receive a new Aquaband each day when you enter the park that they will collect when you leave. Use this to charge food and drinks to your hotel room so you don’t have to carry anything valuable.\n\nIf you are just visiting for the day, download the Aquaband+ App and use it to “tap and pay” and check wait times for rides.\n\nOur five-year-old wore his but they did not have our two-year-old wear one. Otherwise, we would have had one heck of a bill in ice cream charges.\n\nOther Perks..\n\nTowels are provided – find them (or if you’re like me, leave it to your sweet husband to find them) in little huts scattered throughout the park. I still don’t know where they are!\n\nIf you didn’t figure it out from the map yet, walking through the park can be time-consuming and tiring depending on your age, your kids’ ages, and the heat. Hop on a “shuttle” golf cart when you see one!\n\nGet your surf on! Yes, they have a wave simulator for surfing! It’s in the Wavehouse and it’s free for hotel guests. Visitors pay 100 AED for all day use, but free all-day access is included with purchase of Atlantis Aquaventure Water Park tickets.\n\nBaby and Toddler Tips\n\nAquasocks\n\nOur five-year-old fit in the smallest pair, no problem. They were too big for our two-year-old, but I just folded over the top and they stayed on her all day (with a couple re-adjustments).\n\nThey were cute little water booties!\n\nThey do sell baby and toddler water socks for about $12-20 depending on how stylish you wanna get.\n\nToddler Options\n\nThere are plenty of slides, splash zones, and water play areas for babies and toddlers.\n\nWho knows, maybe you’ll have some fun yourself on the kiddy slides.\n\nMamas can have fun too, ya know…\n\nMy husband and I are both still kids at heart (as you can see), so we took turns going solo on the bigger slides in Poseidon Tower while the other one had fun with the kiddos.\n\nLeast-Crowded Areas\n\nAlright, it’s the moment you’ve been waiting for…\n\nThe big reveal…\n\nThe least crowded children’s play areas are (drum roll please)…\n\n~ SPLASHER’S LAGOON and SPLASHER’S COVE ~\n\n– two new additions to Atlantis Aquaventure Water Park.\n\nThey are a bit further from the main entrance but much less crowded. There are plenty of shaded sun loungers, little slides, tube rides, and convenient direct access to the beach.\n\nOur little ones had a blast the first few days at Splasher’s Island and Splasher’s Mountain, both of which are near the park entrance (to the left). But as the people poured in later in the day and on the weekend, it became almost annoyingly crowded.\n\nBut if you get to the park early, then start at Splasher’s Mountain and then make your way to Splasher’s Cove before noon.\n\nI know you’re thinking, “what do you expect at a water park?” But I was thrilled when we discovered the more relaxing cove and lagoon. It’s all stimulating enough as it is.\n\nStroller\n\nBring it! Well, ideally reserve one in advance from the hotel so you don’t even have to pack it. Then take it to Atlantis Aquaventure if you plan on walking to Splasher’s Cove. It’s guaranteed your little one will be too tired after going wild on the slides. Besides, it’s easier to carry everything!\n\nSwim diapers\n\nJust another item that I saw them provide to some parents in a pinch.\n\nSafety Tips\n\nAlthough we were always with our kids in the water play areas, one of the structures was so convoluted that it was hard to always see our kid zippity-do-dahhing around.\n\nIf you can use a waterproof watch case or another way to protect it, I’d consider placing an Apple Air Tag on your child. It’s basically a “tracker” using your iPhone.\n\nWe established set rules and to not leave the play area for any reason, but, he’s five. And if your little ones get as amped as ours do, they might be tough to see in those play zones. Our kid might as well have been in another world.\n\nRest assured, there are alert and attentive lifeguards about every 15-20 feet, so your child is safe. They were so helpful, assisting the little ones on and off the slides. They even had our girl laughing and smiling, which is a rarity with strangers.\n\nBring a waterproof phone pouch lanyard. I did not. And I regret it. No, mine didn’t get soaked like it did jumping waves in Cabo. But it came close enough.\n\nAnd you’re not going to want to miss this shot!\n\nBeat the heat and use the provided water shoes. My feet couldn’t take the pounding, so I wore my flip flops to walk to the slides and then through my sandals into the shoe cubbies and threw on my water shoes.\n\nLife jackets are available for the little ones. Our daughter was on the bigger side of a two-year-old and the XS fit her well (even though she wanted the pink, which was a small, of course).\n\nThrow the kids in rash guards for some sunny peace of mind. It’ll save on sunscreen and time. Our toddler can’t stand the rashguard, so she won that one. Pick your battles, especially when on vacation.\n\nHow to Book Tickets and Experiences\n\nThe dolphin experience is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of adventure. I can’t wait until our kids are old enough to do it! You have to be at least 8 years old. I’ve watched this though, and it looks unreal what they’re able to do with these beautiful animals!\n\nBe sure to book your tickets in advance though to get the best times!\n\nEmail me if you want to take advantage of my discounted tickets for the water park, dolphin experiences, and more! As a certified travel advisor I can hook you up with up to 15% off the regular prices.\n\nI highly recommend settling in and staying awhile at the Atlantis hotel. It’s one of our favorite resorts, and it will be yours too if you follow my tips on how to have the best hotel stay ever at Atlantis the Palm!\n\nContact me to help you book your stay there at no extra cost to you (travel agent commission is already built into the cost you’re paying hotels or booking sites). As a certified Fora travel advisor, I have access to extra perks and discounts at both Atlantis Dubai and Atlantis Bahamas."
