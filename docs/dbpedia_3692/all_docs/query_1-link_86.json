        "text": "Nitro Episode 9:\n\nWednesday 27 June 2001\n\nLive late-night on FX\n\n8,642 crowd in Birmingham, Alabama\n\n----\n\nShow opens up with Linkin Park's 'Runaway'\n\nRunaway - Linkin Park (Hybrid Theory) - YouTube\n\nTony Schiavone on comms, sombre, says it's Wednesday night folks, we're here for Nitro live in Birmingham, Alabama... as you can see Shane McMahon is in the ring to open the show to tonight with an announcement after Team WCW's loss in the War Games match at The Great American Bash.\n\nShane McMahon opens up the show looking annoyed and sad. His face is still in a bad way and he has several stitches dotted around his head and neck. Says he takes full responsibility for Team WCW's loss at The Great American Bash. It was his fault. He shouldn't have put himself in the match. He shouldn't have put himself first entrant. He shouldn't have tried that Coast to Coast. Shane says he has a lot to learn about being a promoter and running a wrestling company and on Sunday night he was humbled and embarrassed in front of the world.\n\nShane says he doesn't like The Extreme Alliance but they won that War Games match... whilst he did not agree to give any of them contracts as part of that match as that's not how he wanted to do business... they did win at The Great American Bash and so he is willing to give each member a chance to win a WCW contract at Bash At The Beach... Shane says he will have more to say on that announcement later in the show on Nitro so stay tuned!\n\nIn the mean-time..\n\nWCW Booker T Theme - YouTube\n\nBooker T comes out with the WCW World Heavyweight Champions and says to Shane you just said you got a lot to learn about being a promoter... and now you talkin' 'bout giving those guys the chance to win a WCW contract at Bash At The Beach??\n\nShane says he is a businessman first and he will do what's best for business no matter how unpopular it is or how much he personally doesn't like the people involved. Shane says you will have to trust me on this champ, you'll find out next week that it won't be a walk in the park for any member of The Extreme Alliance to get their hands on a WCW contract and members of the WCW roster will have a chance to stop them from getting the chance at a contract...\n\nBooker says if Shane needs him to fight any one of those suckas he's more than willing... Shane says thanks for the offer champ... but you won't be fighting any of The Extreme Alliance at Bash at the Beach... I'm not just going to give any of those guys a shot at the World Title... no, at Bash At The Beach... live in California... in the main event you will be defending your WCW World Heavyweight Championship and it is only fair that the man who got his shot disturbed by The Extreme Alliance gets a rematch for that title... at Bash at the Beach it will be Booker T vs...DDP!!\n\nWCW DDP Theme Song Self High Five - YouTube\n\nBooker looks slightly annoyed at DDP's sudden arrival.\n\nDDP says he's glad that for the time being they can put The Extreme Alliance fiasco behind them... he says to Booker that at War Games at the Great American Bash they fought together... but he's glad that at Bash at the Beach they will fight against each other in the rematch that he's owed after The Extreme Alliance's interference at Big Bang!\n\nBooker T says he guesses it's only fair that DDP gets the rematch and Shane has already promised it to him\n\nDDP says best of luck at the PPV champ and holds out his hand to show respect to Booker T. Booker T goes to shake his hand when-\n\nThe New World Order (NWO) Theme Song - YouTube\n\nDDP and Booker T look over at Scott Hall pretty shocked he's come out, Shane looks a bit uneasy\n\nTony on commentary wonders why Scott Hall is trying to interject himself in this conversation!\n\nBooker T asks him what the hell he thinks he's doing out here??\n\nDDP says he's got a lot of respect for Scott but if he thinks he's going to get himself in the title picture, he better wait in line, hell if I beat Booker at Bash at the Beach I'll be sure to give you a shot my brother, but this is my time now...\n\nScott Hall says to DDP that's where he's wrong... Scott Hall says to Shane that it's time... he's got a real good feeling about Bash at the Beach...\n\nBooker T says Scott might think he's the big time but he's just got here... the NWO doesn't run things around here anymore... it's Shane McMahon's show now... Scott Hall will have to get to the back of the line for a shot at his title...\n\nShane looking very uneasy now\n\nScott Hall says Booker is mistaken... he didn't just come back to WCW for the money... Scott says he came back to WCW because Shane McMahon offered him something that the WWF wouldn't... a guaranteed shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship!\n\nWHAT! Tony says.\n\nScott says he could take his shot right here in the main event of Nitro tonight in his first show back... but he thinks it's best to get a few matches under his belt first... but at Bash at the Beach... 5 years from the beginning of the NWO... there's going be a new heavyweight champion of this sport... THE BAD GUY! Scott Hall!\n\nDDP just laughs with a bemused look on his face\n\nBooker T says to Shane \"tell meeee he didn't just say that! Tell me you didn't give this jackass a shot at MY championship as part of his contract??\"\n\nShane McMahon reluctantly says he did what he felt was best for business and for WCW and the best thing for WCW was Scott Hall coming back home! Shane says he hadn't anticipated Scott Hall wanting to take his guaranteed shot at the World Heavyweight Championship this soon into his arrival... but Shane says he has no choice but to honour Scott Hall's contract clause... so at Bash at the Beach it will be a Triangle match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship... at Bash at the Beach it will be:\n\nBooker T vs DDP vs Scott Hall!\n\nBooker T looks furious.

Juventud is in good form following his big win at The Great American Bash and whilst Kaz Hayashi comes out of the match looking quite good he doesn't have enough and Juvi gets the win with the Juvi Driver.\n\nJuventud Guerrera wins via pinfall - (61) - (7.38)\n\n-------\n\nAfter the match Juvi grabs a mic and starts to cut a promo.\n\nJuvi says the Cruiserweight title is back where it belongs on his waist... he's now a 4 time WCW Cruiserweight champion and he's in the form of his life... there ain't nobody in WCW's past, present or future that's going to prize this belt off of his waist! Juvi says Helms and Kidman can get to the back of the line... he puts out a challenge to any past WCW Cruiserweight Champion to come on out and stake a claim for the right to challenge him!\n\nWCW Chavo Guerrero Last Theme - YouTube\n\nChavo Guerrero Jr comes out and says Juvi's always been one of the top performers in the ring... he's got all the charisma in the world... but what will always hold him back is his behaviour outside the ring and not knowing when to shut up! Chavo says Juvi might have hold it 4 times... but he's also lost it 3 times too! Chavo says if Juventud wants to a real challenge... then's he's looking at it! He says if Juvi has any guts he will be put the title on the line against him next week on Nitro!\n\nJuvi says it's not that easy! Juvi says he will give Chavo a chance to earn a shot at the title... Juvi says next week he will team up with his brothers the MexiCruisers and if Chavo can find 2 amigos to team with him and they can beat The MexiCruisers... then Juvi will give Chavo a shot at his title!\n\nFreestyle segment with Juventud Guerrera and Chavo Guerrero Jr - (48 rated)\n\n-----------\n\nJJ Dillon with Team Canada (Lance Storm & Mike Awesome)\n\nJJ asks Lance Storm and Mike Awesome what kind of condition they are in tonight. Mike Awesome of course missed the War Games match after Terry Funk took him out, whilst Lance Storm was in the match and seemed to look in a bad way during it.\n\nLance Storm says he's fine to compete tonight and in-fact if he can be serious for one moment tonight is a big night for Team Canada. They will be competing in the Triangle match for a shot at the WCW World Tag Team championships and Lance is convinced they will get the win tonight.\n\nAwesome says he's back with a point to prove tonight. He's sure that cowardly old man Terry Funk isn't here tonight as he's still not recovered from last week... Awesome says he's not finished with Funk yet, but for the mean time they've got the tag titles to win so Funk can wait, but Funk will pay as he cost Awesome his place in the War Games match and ultimately he cost WCW the victory...\n\nFreestyle segment with JJ Dillon & Team Canada (47 rated)\n\n--------\n\nEric Bischoff and Johnny Ace in Shane's office.\n\nShawn Stasiak, Mark Jindrak and Stacy Keibler are in there. Shawn Stasiak is arguing to Bischoff about not getting booked in the 3 way tag team match for a shot at the WCW World Tag Team championships. Stasiak says they beat Windham & Rotunda at The Great American Bash so he doesn't see why they shouldn't be in that match. Bischoff says Stasiak and Jindrak should calm down... their both young and upcoming stars on the roster... they will get their moment in the sun.\n\nAt this moment Kanyon bursts in followed by DDP. Kanyon is unhappy and wants to know why after he beat Axl Rotten from Team WCW at The Great American Bash he can't get a shot at the WCW United States Championship, but La Parka who's had 1 match in WCW since Shane took over gets a shot at Rob Van Dam in the main event...\n\nEric Bischoff tells Kanyon to calm down. DDP tries to get him to calm down. Johnny Ace says Kanyon should calm down, he's not even been medically cleared to compete tonight after his match with Rotten.\n\nBischoff butts in and says Kanyon didn't even win the match outright! Kanyon only won the match via DQ because those extremely crappy wrestlers couldn't behave. Besides, La Parka is an international star who has won titles in Mexico... what has Kanyon ever won?!\n\nKanyon is seething at this injustice. Shawn Stasiak and Mark Jindrak laugh at him. This gets him hot. DDP gets in the middle of them.\n\nMark Jindrak says it's a shame Kanyon isn't cleared tonight as he'd be more than happy to put him in his place and show the world why he doesn't deserve a title shot.\n\nDDP says Kanyon might not be medically cleared tonight... but he is! DDP says he'll see Mark Jindrak in the ring later tonight!\n\nDDP and Kanyon leaves. Mark Jindrak looks a bit concerned but Shawn Stasiak hypes him up and says DDP will be weak from the War Games match tonight is the best time to get a statement win over him!\n\nRicky 'The Dragon' Steamboat then comes in with Meiko Satomura and asks Eric Bischoff when he plans to decide who will be number 1 contender for the WCW World Women's Championship.\n\nStacy quickly interjects and says she wasn't pinned at the PPV so she should get the next shot at Akira Hokuto... it certainly shouldn't be Meiko!\n\nMeiko and Stacy look set to have a fight but Stasiak, Jindrak and Steamboat get in the middle.\n\nBischoff loses his temper and says he won't be organising anything for the women's division! He's said it time and time again if he had it his way they wouldn't even have one. He says Johnny Ace better sort it out and hurry up getting in a General Manager for the Women's division if Shane is so keen on it.

Shane McMahon says ever since he bought WCW a lot of fans have been saying to him \"yo Shane you should bring back the Television title\", \"hey Shane you should bring back the Hardcore belt\" well after much consideration and also after speaking to the good people at FX who have offered WCW a good sponsorship deal I have decided that there will be a new WCW championship belt for everyone on the roster to compete for starting off at the upcoming Bash at the Beach PPV.\n\nSo which belt is coming back to WCW? Well, both actually.\n\nYou see what I have decided is that we will be combining the WCW World Television Championship's history with the WCW World Hardcore Championships history... and our good friends at FX have agreed a sponsorship deal for this new championship... so at Bash at the Beach we will crown the first ever WCW FXtreme Television Champion with a brand new belt paid for by FX to be revealed next week!\n\nAnd this announcement also links in to my opportunity to the Extreme Alliance... they keep saying they're \"too extreme\" for WCW TV, well I never said that and I never agreed with that... I just didn't hire them because I didn't think they were the right fit for WCW... but they came after us and they got the win in the War Games... so I'm not as some people thought giving the 6 members of the Exteme Alliance to fight for a chance to all got their hands on a WCW contract... no... I am giving the 6 members of the Extreme Alliance the chance to win 1 WCW contract!\n\nYou see at Bash at the Beach the WCW FXtreme Television Championship will be fought for in a 6-way no-disqualification match with the winner crowned the new champion. However, if the winner of this match happens to be a member of The Extreme Alliance then along with being the new WCW FXtreme Television champion they will also get their hands on a WCW contract...\n\nBut I hope that the WCW roster makes sure that none of The Extreme Alliance even qualify for that 6-way match at Bash at the Beach.\n\nOver the next 3 weeks on Nitro there will be 6 qualification matches for the PPV.\n\nThese will be:\n\nKanyon vs Sabu\n\nFit Finlay vs Tommy Dreamer\n\nBuff Bagwell vs The Sandman\n\nSteve Corino vs Stevie Ray\n\nBalls Mahoney vs Shawn Stasiak\n\nAxl Rotten vs Tajiri\n\nFreestyle segment with Shane McMahon - (100 rated)\n\nWow! says Tony on commentary.

He doesn't agree with Eric Bischoff's take on this... but he's got Bischoff signed to a contract so at least for the mean time he will remain as General Manager of Men's wrestling in WCW\n\nShane says he wanted Johnny Ace to hire someone who was passionate about Women's wrestling and not just women's wrestling but respect for women. Shane says he doesn't want women's wrestling in this company to be focused on gimmicky bra and panties and mud fight matches (some boos in the crowd but some cheers too)\n\nShane says the person they've hired is someone who cares about women in the business, who promotes women empowering themselves and their beauty, but is also not afraid to stand up to the establishment and call out unsafe work conditions when people cross the line!\n\nShane says the bombshell announcement will be made later tonight!\n\nFreestyle segment with JJ Dillon and Shane McMahon - (92 rated)\n\n------\n\n'The Queen of the Underworld' Dawn-Macaria cuts a promo\n\nDawn-Macaria in Greek underworld style gear speaks in Greek for about 10-15 seconds before then saying ominously that 'The Hounds of Hades' are coming...soon...\n\nThe promo ends with two guys in vicious looking evil dog masks standing next to her\n\n'The Queen of the Underworld' Dawn-Macaria promo with 'The Hounds of Hades' - (38 rated)\n\n-----\n\nMatch 2:\n\nAxl Rotten (with Balls Mahoney) vs Tajiri (with Fit Finlay and Dave Taylor) - WCW FXtreme Television Championship qualifying match for Bash at the Beach\n\nECW Classic/Original Theme Song (youtube.com)\n\nAxl Rotten comes out through the crowd with Balls Mahoney\n\nFinlay's 2006 v2 Titantron Entrance Video feat. \"Lambeg v2\" Theme [HD] (youtube.com)\n\nFinlay comes out and heads to the announce desk as Taylor waits for Tajiri\n\nTajiri's 2001 v1 Titantron Entrance Video feat. \"Imperial City\" Theme [HD] (youtube.com)\n\nTajiri comes out not looking all that good but Dave Taylor eggs him on\n\nOn the commentary desk Tony mentions to Finlay he's heard that after Tajiri took a vicious clotheslines from 'Dr Death' Steve Williams last week he heard rumours backstage that Tajiri isn't even medically cleared to compete tonight.\n\nFinlay laughs and says look Tony I don't expect you or Scott to understand, Arn will, but we're fighting men Tony. If I'm at home with a bad neck, not medically cleared, but an intruder comes into my property and tries to rob me, threatens my family, do I have to be medically cleared to get my ass out of bed and fight this guy out my property? The bottom line, is medically cleared or not, when fighting men have to step up they will step up... sure Tajiri could've taken the cowards way out and forfeited the match... but is that what the fans want?

Once Buff Daddy V becomes the legal man it becomes difficult for Guido or Mamaluke to do much, but Stamboli gets in the ring and his size helps him get some shots in.\n\nIt seems like Buff Enuff manage to get the momentum back though after Chavo behind the refs back gets a low blow in on Stamboli.\n\nBuff Daddy V is still the legal man and looks like he might get his finish off on Stamboli when all of a sudden Curt Hennig comes out to the ring. Buff Bagwell goes over to him and the referee gets out of the ring to intervene to ensure that Hennig plays no part in the match.\n\nChavo noticing the ref is distracted grabs a chair and tries to throw it into Viscera but Stamboli intercepts the chair as he's quicker than him and he absolutely nails Buff Daddy V with the chair several times until he goes down. Guido and Mamaluke take out Chavo, whilst Buff and Curt Hennig are arguing at the entrance way... the ref seems satisfied that Hennig won't interfere and he goes back to the ring to find Stamboli pinning a knocked out Buff Daddy V.\n\nThe ref rushes in and counts the 1...2....3 before Buff Bagwell can notice what's happened\n\nThe FBI win via pinfall - (6.21) - (56 rated)\n\nBagwell runs back to the ring noticing what's happened and is furious!\n\nA big win for The FBI here tonight says Tony on commentary.\n\nCurt Hennig at the top of the entrance way laughing\n\n----\n\nA pre-recorded segment shows The MexiCruisers who look like they're at home.\n\nJuventud says that Chavo must be even stupider than he looks.

Stacy ensured that Meiko didn't qualify for the Triangle match at The Great American Bash as she distracted Meiko in her match with Malia Hosaka.\n\nThis is an open match with Sable on commentary hyping up both of the women as being both attractive but also very talented in the ring...

Akira Hokuto is the future of women's wrestling and will hang onto her title whoever she faces\n\nBischoff says if Mitchell has come to talk to him about women's wrestling then he should get lost because-\n\nMitchell says he's not here for that. Mitchell says he's here to talk to him about tag team wrestling... specifically Sean O'Haire and Chuck Palumbo... Mitchell says he knows that Bischoff has been a big fan of these guys before but in recent weeks they've not really featured on the card.\n\nBischoff says it's nothing personal, they've had busy cards, when they lost the titles they had to know they would be featured less, it's just business.\n\nMitchell says he agrees but he says why not give them a chance to prove themselves next week?\n\nAs they say this AJ Styles enters Bischoff's office\n\nBischoff asks what he wants??\n\nAJ says he thought he put in a good showing against Curt Hennig last week given he's a rookie and he'd like a chance to prove himself as the future of the Cruiserweight division...\n\nMitchell says I don't know about that son, but I've got two big boys looking for a match next week... how about you find your self a partner and we have ourselves a tag team match next week on Nitro?\n\nAJ agrees\n\nBischoff books the match for next week on Nitro!\n\nFreestyle segment with Eric Bischoff, 'Sinister' James Mitchell, Akira Hokuto & AJ Styles - (41 rated)\n\n------\n\nMatch 5:\n\nBalls Mahoney (with Axl Rotten) vs Shawn Stasiak (with Mark Jindrak) - WCW FXtreme Television Championship qualifying match for Bash at the Beach\n\nBefore the match we see Shawn and Stacy arguing slightly in the gorilla position area.

At one point Jindrak and Rotten seem to clash a bit at ringside but the ref stops it threatening to kick both of them out of the match.\n\nAs the match goes on after about 5 minutes Stacy Keibler, wearing formal wear instead of ring attire comes out to the ring to help support Stasiak.\n\nStacy's sudden arrival seems to distract Stasiak a bit, he seems happy that she's made the effort to come out to support him but this distraction causes the momentum to shift to Balls Mahoney who eventually hits a Ball Buster and gets what seems like a bit of a surprise win!\n\nBalls Mahoney wins via pinfall - (6.30) - (52 rated)\n\nBalls Mahoney celebrates with Axl Rotten, who have both now qualified for the match at Bash at the Beach whilst a dejected Shawn Stasiak seems to blame Stacy for the loss.\n\n-----\n\nUpdated qualifying brackets for the WCW FXtreme Television Championship match at Bash at the Beach\n\nSteve Corino defeated Stevie Ray\n\nAxl Rotten defeated Tajiri\n\nBalls Mahoney defeated Shawn Stasiak\n\nKanyon vs Sabu (later tonight)\n\nBuff Bagwell vs The Sandman (next week live on Nitro!)\n\nFit Finlay vs Tommy Dreamer (next week live on Nitro!)\n\n----\n\n'Real Talk with Roddy' segment with Roddy Piper and The Nu Road Warriors (Road Warrior Animal and Road Warrior Dog)\n\nRoddy says let's cut to the chase, you guys were thrown together as a team and now you are champions, some would say you were handed those belts unfairly after Hawk called it a day, hey Animal?\n\nAnimal says he was the rightful champion and they only became champions as The Nu Road Warriors after they won against O'Haire and Palumbo at The Great American Bash\n\nBG James cuts in and gets on the defensive saying they won the titles fair and square... some people wanna say I was given these titles on a silver platter... but that ain't the truth of the matter!

Kanyon has been in the form of his life lately and will be looking to get a chance to win his first ever WCW gold at Bash at the Beach\n\nThis is a really intense match with Kanyon on fire but Sabu matching him for large parts of it. This match gets a lot of time and the commentators even mention at the 10 minute mark that all matches on Nitro, save for the main event, have a time limit of 15 minutes and this match could well go the distance\n\nBut not too long after that Sabu makes a mistake and Kanyon manages to capitalise on it.
