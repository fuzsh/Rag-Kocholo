        "text": "“I wasn’t really aware that I had crossed some bounds. Why are they asking why? For me there are many reasons…the biggest reason of all is that nobody’s ever done it.”\n\nThat was director Gus Van Sant’s response to Newsweek when posed with the obvious question about his recently completed shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. For Van Sant, an idea that baffled most people had long been a dream project, one he’d first pitched in 1989. Nine years and one Good Will Hunting later, Universal relented. Interestingly enough, Van Sant insisted that his Psycho remake was actually an anti-remake. “Why do people take films that are really well done and change the dialogue and change the shots and call it the same movie?” Okay, you’ve got us there.\n\nThe new Psycho wasn’t screened for anyone ahead of its December 4th, 1998 release and there was a hope that all the shot-for-shot talk was a misdirect, a smokescreen for a bold new vision the filmmakers wished not to spoil. Van Sant was the director behind My Own Private Idaho, a landmark of queer cinema, and he’d cast sexually fluid actress Anne Heche has the new Marion Crane. Would this Psycho confront queer themes or ideologies (specifically those perceived in the 1960 Psycho)?\n\nNope. As promised, Psycho ’98 arrived as an almost verbatim love letter to the original. The one artistic liberty everyone remembers Van Sant taking (aside from shooting the entire film in color) is the addition of a scene where Norman Bates pleasures himself while spying on Marion in her motel room. Talk about flattening ambiguity with a sledgehammer. And the execution is straight out of “Saturday Night Live.” It almost seems like a cruel joke on Vince Vaughn, the hangdog comedian who was already fighting an uphill battle in the Bates role.\n\nGus Van Sant’s Psycho also has punk rock and heavy metal on the soundtrack. I admit that’s what got me through the door. I had no intention of ever seeing this film (even though I worked at a movie theater during its release and could have seen it for free at any time!) until I learned “What We Do Is Secret” by the Germs and “Living Dead Girl” by Rob Zombie were both featured. I love the Germs and I wanted to hear them blasting out of massive auditorium speakers. With Rob Zombie, I was more curious about how they’d make his carnival barker style fit the aesthetic (both songs are only used momentarily and faintly to illustrate the happenstance of everyday life).\n\nIn the Newsweek story referenced above, Psycho ’98 co-star William H. Macy compared this production to a theater troupe performing Hamlet. “I think it’s going to be remarkably different even while being the same,” he said, the implication being that the energy and dynamic between the actors would become its own distinct engine. Of course, live theater versus film is apples and oranges — there are less elements for actors to contend with in theater, granting more power to their performance, and film cannot convey the visceral intangibles that make three dimensional human interaction uniquely compelling.\n\nAnd so Heche, Vaughn, Macy, and Julianne Moore do little more than prove they’ve seen Psycho in what amounts to a long, pointless commercial for the original. The whole thing feels beneath the talent involved. Macy admitted in 2001 that he only agreed to be in Psycho because it was Gus Van Sant. “You know, I’m not that much of a fan of Hitchcock, actually,” he admitted. “I think some of his films are stultifyingly boring. And so many of the performances in his films are just dreadful.”\n\nVan Sant made a few (joking?) remarks while promoting Psycho that his next project would be another remake of Psycho. Now that’s a fucking concept — remaking Psycho every year with different actors. Or if Heche, Vaughn, Macy, and Moore had become Van Sant’s annual company for remaking classics. Imagine Casablanca with that team, or The Wizard of Oz, or The French Connection. That’s more fertile than remaking Psycho once.\n\nI’d also like to point out that Gus Van Sant upping the amount of money Marion Crane steals in Psycho from $40,000 to $400,000 is meaningless in 2022. Today you could make a Psycho where Marion steals $400 and it would be believable. Have you tried buying groceries lately? Unaffordable!\n\nThe headlines have been so upsetting lately. Seeking a wholesome reprieve, my wife and I recently binge watched “Shelley Duvall’s Faerie Tale Theatre,” the live action children’s show from the 1980s. Please enjoy these brief reviews of every episode (save the “Greatest Moments” retrospective).\n\n“The Tale of the Frog Prince” — Robin Williams has the titular role but Van Dyke Parks is funnier in his tiny part as the Musician. I guess it isn’t the Frog Prince’s job to be funny. Yes, Williams is shirtless when he transforms back into a human, you so get to see that beaver pelt between his nipples.\n\n“Rumpelstiltskin” — Sometimes the makeup department on “Faerie Tale Theatre” would alter an actor’s appearance so much you wonder why they didn’t just hire an actor who looked like that. Hervé Villechaize is the victim here. Overall, I’d call this version of “Rumpelstiltskin” serviceable.\n\n“Rapunzel” — Shelley Duvall is one of the finest acting talents ever to grace the screen. As Rapunzel, she convinced me radishes are the most succulent and delectable treats in existence. Maybe it’s time to give those gross things another shot, I kept thinking.\n\n“The Nightingale” — Insanely racist episode. All the characters are Asian but the main parts are taken by white actors made to look Asian while actual Asian actors have the smallest, most inconsequential roles. Mick Jagger as the Emperor of China? Jesus Christ.\n\n“Sleeping Beauty” — I never realized how much goes on before Beauty falls asleep. None of it is particularly exciting, which is a shame because there’s a murderer’s row of talent. Beverly D’Angelo, Carol Kane, Christopher Reeve, Sally Kellerman, and Lethal Weapon 4’s Richard Libertini. He was married to Melinda Dillon!\n\n“Jack and the Beanstalk” — One of the strongest entries because it’s slightly more stylized than the others, I think. Or maybe I just love stories where people overcome poverty by outwitting giants.\n\n“Little Red Riding Hood” — For some odd reason they age Little Red up to adulthood and give her a love interest but Mary Steenburgen makes it work. Another creative liberty: they name the wolf Reginald Von Lupin.\n\n“Hansel and Gretel” — Ricky Schroder (Hansel) was a cute kid. It’s a real shame he grew up to be a fascist stooge. All the exterior shots in this episode look like b-roll from your parents’ home movies.\n\n“Goldilocks and the Three Bears” — At one point, Papa Bear is rambling about adding an observation deck to the bear home. So yeah, there’s some padding in “Faerie Tale Theatre.” And yet Tatum O’Neal turns Goldilocks into such a perfect brat maybe they should have spun this off into a series.\n\n“The Princess and the Pea” — In a word? LIZA.\n\n“Pinocchio” — Add Paul Reubens to the pile of truly annoying Pinocchios. Michael Richards is also in this episode. He’s sort of a “Faerie Tale Theatre” regular. Makes you wonder if he and Shelley Duvall keep in touch. I wouldn’t put him in the reboot.\n\n“Thumbelina” — Gets my vote for best of the bunch. A perfect blend of wonder, whimsy, drama, and magic. Might be Carrie Fisher’s best acting. Hey, you try making a conversation with a giant bird look believable.\n\n“Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” — One day her prince will come, but charisma is missing in action during Elizabeth McGovern’s turn as Snow White. If you find some portions a little grim perhaps it won’t surprise you to learn that director Peter Medak also directed the episode of “Breaking Bad” where Jesse Pinkman babysits a neglected kid in a squalid meth house.\n\n“Beauty and the Beast” — Speaking of grim, here you’ve got that noxious demon Klaus Kinski wooing Susan Sarandon. I was never sold on the union, even at the end when Klaus takes human form. He looks like a deranged Buster Brown.\n\n“The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About The Shivers” — A faerie tale completely unknown to me before this program. There’s a kid who never gets scared; worried it might be an irreversible condition, he ventures out into the world to test his mettle. Peter MacNicol has the lead and he is hilarious. Another classic for the MacNicol Heads.\n\n“The Three Little Pigs” — Do you enjoy seeing Fred Willard hit on women? That takes up a significant chunk of “The Three Little Pigs.” I don’t know why they made one pig look and act like a ’70s disco swinger. The other two pigs are played by Billy Crystal and Stephen Furst, and Jeff Goldblum is the Big Bad Wolf. A pretty uneven affair.\n\n“The Snow Queen” — A goblin in outer space breaks up a friendship by giving a boy a weird strain of hypothermia. Am I explaining this correctly? I don’t know. The sets are wonderful, at least.\n\n“The Pied Piper of Hamelin” — This episode has the tenor of a Hammer horror film, which makes sense given its beyond the pale ending. The moral? Always pay your freelancers. I’m not sure Eric Idle needs the Johnny Winters wig as the Piper but this is an admittedly meaningless quibble.\n\n“Cinderella” — It’s okay. A little depressing in the early scenes.\n\n“Puss in Boots” — A brief but very funny opening sequence is all you get before Ben Vereen drags you to Hell. Vereen plays Puss as a screeching, mewling nymph. He’s in heat for the whole performance and I’m amazed anyone made it out of this one alive.\n\n“The Emperor’s New Clothes” — Alan Arkin and Art Carney carry this thing as the “tailors” who create the Emperor’s trendy new “wardrobe.” Up with the proletariat! Dismantle the nude establishment!\n\n“Aladdin” — Tim Burton(!) directs the whitest version of “Aladdin” anyone’s ever seen. It’s almost as bad as the 1990 made-for-tv movie starring Barry Bostwick as the Genie. James Earl Jones is the Genie here and I hope his check had a lot of zeroes. As Aladdin, Robert Carradine is insufferable. You will actively root against his success.\n\n“The Princess Who Had Never Laughed” — This folk tale is Russian but I don’t think the character Howie Mandel plays is called Wienerhead Waldo in the original story. That’s one of those modern flourishes “Faerie Tale Theatre” occasionally implements, usually to its detriment. On the subject of names, Sofia Coppola has a small part in this and she’s credited as Domino. How is the show? Howie Mandel plays a guy named Wienerhead Waldo!\n\n“Rip Van Winkle” — Harry Dean Stanton stars in the role he was born to play. There’s some surreal stuff in this episode that really drives home how disorienting it must be to sleep for twenty years. That’s the master at work. I’m talking about Francis Ford Coppola, who directed “Rip Van Winkle.”\n\n“The Little Mermaid” — Imagine walking down a quiet beach and stumbling upon a tv shoot where Pam Dawber is the Mermaid fawning over a soaking wet Treat Williams. Get out of my freaking head, “Faerie Tale Theatre!” “The Little Mermaid” doesn’t have the happiest ending but perhaps true happiness is in the eye of the fish woman who has become one with the wind.\n\n“The Dancing Princesses” — Kind of a deep cut from the Brothers Grimm. It’s like their “Cold Gin.” Peter Weller is charming as the soldier who tries to solve the mystery of where these Princesses sneak off to at night. He gets into a will they, won’t they thing with Lesley Ann Warren. I ain’t mad at that!\n\nA hapless inventor is so desperate for cash he robs a bank. The teller he accosts earns hero status when she outwits him, but it turns out she’s not exactly on the level either. He tracks her down to even the score. Do hijinks ensue? Does romance blossom? Is there a dramatic finale on a rooftop?\n\nThat’s enough premise for one movie, but 1983’s Two of a Kind tacks on a hokey framing device that makes these two characters unwitting pawns in a high stakes wager occurring in the afterlife. God has grown disillusioned with humanity and wants to wipe us out. A group of angels protest, insisting that people are inherently good. Our world will be spared if the inventor and the bank teller can prove the angels’ thesis.\n\nTwo of a Kind might be more warmly regarded (or remembered at all) had it been a vehicle for Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn. In reality, the film stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John in their first team-up since Grease. Critics in 1983 all but disemboweled Two of a Kind and there’s a sense of betrayal in many of their reviews. Why didn’t they make another musical? Why is this movie so dopey?\n\nNewsflash: Grease is one of the dopiest movies ever made and the whole thing has aged like milk. Two of a Kind isn’t Casablanca but for all its silliness there’s something tangible at the core. The comedy throws a few curveballs and everybody knows the leads have palpable chemistry. If there’s a crime here it’s hiring Scatman Crothers and Charles Durning as two of the angels and treating them like wallpaper. At least when Oliver Reed shows up as the Devil he’s dressed in something memorably garish.\n\nTwo of a Kind was directed by John Herzfeld, who has since complained that creative control was wrested from his grip and his true vision never made it to screen. Again, I don’t think this guy has any reason to be ashamed, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t curious about a director’s cut.\n\nBy the way, the voice of God in Two of a Kind is provided by an uncredited Gene Hackman. Not bad!"
