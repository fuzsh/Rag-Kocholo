        "text": "OCTOBER 24th, 2023, Somewhere outside of Chicago, Illinois:\n\n\"NWA Samhain, one of the worst shows of the year\"\n\n\"What a dull main event\"\n\n\"Why did James Mitchell snort cocaine on live PPV?\"\n\n\"Is that going to jeopardize their deal with The CW?\"\n\n\"Guys, my dad works at CW and he told me that The CW is going to kick off NWA and replace them with NXT\"\n\n\"ENOUGH!\"\n\nBilly Corgan was frustrated. The Smashing Pumpkins lead singer had been running the legendary National Wrestling Alliance since 2017 and it had been a rollercoaster ride. The company looked like it had a ton of momentum for the first few years, but once COVID happened, it was all downhill. Top stars left the company for greener pastures and their replacements couldn't really pick up the weight. Hell, the most attention the company got before the cocaine incident was them putting the legendary NWA World Heavyweight Championship on an old, out-of-shape, ex-WWE jobber just so he could wear the belt on his Fox News show. It was that kind of few years for Corgan and the NWA and this incident with Jim Mitchell (albeit not using real cocaine) was just the icing on the cake.\n\nThis left Corgan in a jam. He was growing frustrated with running the NWA. He thought things were going to turn around when they landed a TV deal with The CW to bring the NWA to nationwide TVs, but that all fell through with one fake snort of coke. That was the straw that broke the camel's back, something needed to change and it needed to change now.\n\nAs Corgan sat in his million dollar mansion in suburban Chicago, trying to think of what to do next, he received a phone call from an unknown number. Curiously, he decided to pick it up.\n\nCorgan: \"William Patrick Corgan, who is this?\"\n\nUnknown Voice: \"Billy! good to hear from you my friend. I hope things are going well, I know they're not, but for you I hope things are good.\"\n\nCorgan: \"Um, who is this?\"\n\nUnknown Voice: \"You don't recognize me Billy? Well, how about I give you a little hint...\n\nI AM THE INNOVATOR OF EXTREME!\n\nI AM THE RABBI OF THE REVOLUTION!\n\nI AM...\n\nPAUL HEYMAN!\n\nCorgan: \"Okay Paul, you didn't have to blow my eardrums out, what'd you call me for?\"\n\nHeyman: \"Well Mr. Corgan, I'm here today to present you with an offer. You see, I saw that show you guys put on yesterday night. I want to be one hundred percent honest with you and tell you that it was one of the worst shitshows I've ever seen and I saw December to Dismember!\"\n\nCorgan: \"So you call me to berate me? Not a very enticing offer Paul.\"\n\nHeyman: \"I was getting to that! Anyway, I was thinking to myself the other day that I've really done everything I wanted to do in WWE and was planning on leaving once my contract expires at the end of the year.\"\n\nCorgan: \"Nice story Paul, what does this have to do with me?\"\n\nHeyman: \"You really are inpatient. So, I've been thinking that the next thing I want to do with my life is to get back in the promoting business. I want to buy the National Wrestling Alliance off of you Billy!\"\n\nCorgan: \"Ok, what makes you think that I'm trying to sell?\"\n\nHeyman: \"Billy, we all saw you last night, you looked like a kid who just got told that Santa wasn't real.\"\n\nCorgan: \"That's just how I normally look okay! But yeah, you're right, I've been a bit bored running the NWA the last few years. COVID really killed my drive. I kinda just want to sell the company and go back to making music and enjoying my time with my family.\"\n\nHeyman: \"I completely understand Billy. Why don't I fly out to Chicago next weekend and we can discuss some details...\"\n\nTHE FOLLOWING WEEKEND AT BILLY CORGAN'S MANSION:\n\nHeyman: \"Well Billy, it's good to see you again! This must be the first time in like, what 23 years?\"\n\nCorgan: \"Yeah, when you were still running ECW and wanted me to invest to become a part-owner.\"\n\nHeyman: \"Probably for the best that didn't work out right? I'm hoping this go-around is much more successful than the last one.\"\n\nCorgan: \"Yeah, me too. So, what do you have planned if I accept your offer?\"\n\nHeyman: *smiles* \"I'm glad you asked Billy. First thing's first, I'm cleaning house. That whole roster's gone except for one man, Matt Cardona.\n\nCorgan: \"Why Cardona?\"\n\nHeyman: \"I've always liked the kid since he was doing the whole \"Woo Woo Woo\" schtick a decade ago. The kid's got talent and he's certainly proved himself over the last few years. I'm pushing him to the moon and hoping WWE doesn't come back knocking.\"\n\nCorgan: \"Okay, continue.\"\n\nHeyman: \"Second, as a consequence of getting rid of the whole roster, save Cardona, and replacing them with people that I know deserve a shot in the NWA, we're putting NWA Powerrr on an indefinite hiatus. No offence Billy, but that name is terrible and I'm going to be working to get a better show name in the meantime.\"\n\nCorgan: \"Harsh, but fair, what's next?\"\n\nHeyman: \"For the titles, we're cutting things down a bit. We can keep the big ones, NWA World Heavyweight, Women's, Tag Team, Television, those are fine. These other ones though? Got to go. I just don't have a big enough roster in mind to support it.\"\n\nCorgan: \"So there goes the Junior Heavyweight, the National, US Tag, Women's Tag, and Women's Television Titles. Did we really have that many titles?\"\n\nHeyman: \"Yeah, just imagine what Sam Muchnick had to deal with back in the day!\"\n\nCorgan: \"I like what I'm hearing Paul. I'll get my lawyers to draw up a contract and the NWA will be under your control by the beginning of the year. Pleasure doing business with you.\"\n\nHeyman: \"Thank you Billy. Now let's hope this goes better than the last time I had to deal with the National Wrestling Alliance...\"\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n(OOC: We're back! In case you're new here, hi! I'm Uncrewed. You may remember me from such dynasties as WWF: Turning the Tide and NJPW: King of Puroresu. Troy McClure impression aside, both of those dynasties ran their course and ended six years and six months ago respectfully (I've really been doing this that long!). Now it's time to move on to a whole new project, one with a lot history, but with a lot of new faces. I'm super excited to show y'all what I have for the NEW National Wrestling Alliance and I hope you come along for the ride!)\n\nCHAMPIONS:\n\nNWA World Heavyweight Championship\n\nCurrent

My name is Paul Heyman! If you haven't heard the news already, then let me tell you once again that I have bought the National Wrestling Alliance. As such, I've decided to remake the National Wrestling Alliance in MY image. Today, we'll be taking a look at some of the newest members of the NWA roster. They were all handpicked by yours truly for one mission, to reclaim the lost glory of the National Wrestling Alliance! We now present your featured presentation...\"\n\n\"Main Event\" Matt Cardona\n\nCardona: \"Y'know, the last few weeks, people have been asking me \"Matt, how does it feel to be the one guy Paul Heyman wanted to keep around from the old era of the NWA?\" \"Matt, are you feeling pressured to not blow it and win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship that you never lost in the first place and only had to drop because you got injured?\" You know what I tell them? I tell them that I was the only guy worthy enough from that talent cesspool to make it to the new NWA. You know what else I tell them? That when the dust settles, I'll still be the only guy worth a damn on this new roster! These eight jabronis entering the NWA World Heavyweight Championship Contenders Tournament can't hold a candle to me, even if it's their best day and it's my worst. Because I'm Matt Cardona and I'm THE MAIN EVENT!\"\n\n\"The Knockout Artist\" Chris Hero\n\nPaul Heyman voiceover: \"Name any company in America and Chris Hero has probably worked for them. This man has over 25 years of professional wrestling experience, wrestling for companies like Ring of Honor, WWE, and Pro Wrestling NOAH. With his hard-hitting style and devastating Rolling Elbow, Chris Hero has made his mark on the professional wrestling industry. Now he comes to the National Wrestling Alliance to help the next generation of stars follow in his footsteps and maybe even win the illustrious 10 pounds of gold along the way!\"\n\n\"The Judge\" EJ Nduka\n\nA video plays showing a group of guys drinking at a bar. The bartender comes up to the group and tells them that it's closing time and they need to pay their tab. The guys refuse and begin to walk to the exit. That's when the bartender grabs his cell phone, calls an unknown number, and tells the person on the other line to \"send in THE JUDGE!\" The doors to the exit are then locked by a tall shadowy figure, who quickly emerges from the shadows to reveal EJ Nduka. The men try to attack Nduka, but they can't do a damn thing to him. Nduka quickly overpowers the four men, chokeslamming each of them through separate bar tables. Nduka lets out a victory approval before a message flashes on screen:\n\n\"THE JUDGE\" EJ NDUKA, BRINGING ROUGH JUSTICE TO THE NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE\n\n\"The Bounty Hunter\" Bryan Keith\n\nA video plays showing a guy running through the woods. After nearly a minute, he stops to catch his breath. He mutters to himself, \"Who is this guy chasing me? What the hell did I do to deserve this?\" Before he could make his next move, Bryan Keith appeared in front of him! The man scurried back as Keith told him \"It's nothing personal man, I'm just here to collect that bounty on your head.\" Keith then grabbed the man by the collar and beat the living hell out of him! He then tied the guy up (Red Dead Redemption style) and carried him back to his pickup truck. Keith started his truck, but before he drove off, he told the man one simple sentence.\n\nKeith: \"And by the way, when my name's called. I ALWAYS COLLECT!\"\n\nThe video then cuts to black with the words \"BRYAN KEITH, COMING SOON TO THE NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE\" flashing on screen\n\n\"Rock Solid\" Alex Hammerstone\n\nPaul Heyman voiceover: \"Despite only wrestling for less than a decade, Alex Hammerstone has made a name for himself as one of the toughest competitors in all of professional wrestling. From his time in MLW, where he won the MLW World Heavyweight Championship, to his time in Japan wrestling for Pro Wrestling NOAH, Alex Hammerstone has brought a level of ferocity to the ring everywhere's he gone. Now, he brings his hard-hitting style to the National Wrestling Alliance, hoping that it'll lead him to the 10 pounds of gold!\"\n\n\"The Tormentor\" Timothy Thatcher\n\nPaul Heyman voiceover: \"Everywhere that Timothy Thatcher has gone, a path of broken bones and crushed spirits have been left in his wake. This man is one of the most technically-sound wrestlers in pro wrestling today. Combining mat-based offense and a wide arsenal of submissions, it's no wonder why Timothy Thatcher has proven to be one of the most feared men in all of professional wrestling. Can his technical prowess lead him to the 10 pounds of gold? Only time will tell!\"\n\n\"The Chairman\" Shawn Spears\n\n*We cut to a dark room, where a singular lightbulb is all that illuminates a single chair sitting in the middle. All of a sudden, Shawn Spears enters the room and takes a seat*\n\nShawn Spears: \"What do I have to prove to you people? Was my four years in AEW not enough to satisfy you? Was cracking Cody Rhodes over the head with a chair not enough? Was kicking ass every time I entered that ring not enough damn it?!?!? WHAT MORE DO I HAVE DO TO PROVE TO THE PRO WRESTLING INDUSTRY THAT I AM NOT TO BE MESSED WITH?!?!?!?\"\n\n*Spears then gets up and flips the chair*\n\nSpears: \"Heh, you know what I need to do? I need to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Maybe then the world will know what being \"The Chairman\" truly means!\"\n\n\"The Samoan Wrecking Ball\" Jacob Fatu\n\nPaul Heyman voiceover: \"The name \"Fatu\" needs no introduction in the world of professional wrestling. From the huge Rikishi Fatu to the wrecking machine Umaga Fatu and even today with three Fatus on top of the biggest company in professional wrestling. Enter Jacob Fatu. The son of former Tag Team Champion Tama, Jacob Fatu has shown himself as a force to be reckoned with. With his raw power and ruthless intensity, Jacob Fatu has shown himself to be one of the most dangerous wrestlers to ever emerge from the Fatu family. Can Jacob Fatu and his unique brand of savagery be enough to bring home the one title that has aluded the Fatu family?\"\n\n\"The Falcon\" Mustafa Ali\n\nMustafa Ali: \"You look at me and you see someone who shouldn't be here. I was born to two immigrants from Pakistan and India, grew up on the mean streets of Chicago. The kids at school used to make fun of me for my name, how I looked, and for my love of professional wrestling. I didn't let that get to me though, I kept chasing my dreams of beocming a professional wrestler. And guess what? Despite some promoters trying to tell me to be a stereotype, I'm still standing. And with my loving wife and three beautiful children, I've got to stay strong. That's why I made my way to the National Wrestling Alliance. I want to prove everyone wrong, prove all the stereotypes wrong, and win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship!\"\n\n\"The Natural\" Nic Nemeth\n\n*We cut to an extravagant yacht, where Nemeth is sitting on the deck, sipping a mimosa*\n\nNic Nemeth: \"The world of professional wrestling needs someone like me. It needs a megastar. It needs someone larger than life. It needs someone who knows they're that much better than everyone else in it! That's why I'm here. I'm Nic Nemeth. Some people have called me a show-off, some have called me perfection. But what I really am, is a natural. No matter what's out there nowadays trying to copy me, you can only have one natural product and you're looking at him baby. And let me introduce you to the woman behind \"The Natural,\" Salina de la Renta!\n\n*Salina de la Renta saunters into view*\n\nSalina de la Renta: \"Nic Nemeth isn't just \"The Natural,\" he is the man the whole damn wrestling world revolves around. And I am more than happy to sit in the corner for this man as he makes his way to the National Wrestling Alliance and wins the ten pounds of gold!\"\n\nNemeth: \"And if you don't like it? Well, I've got two words for ya, CHAMP OUT!\"\n\n\"The King of Bros\" Matt Riddle\n\n*Video plays showing Riddle's MMA career*\n\nPaul Heyman Voiceover: \"When he first entered the world of mixed martial arts, Matt Riddle was unstoppable. With his deadly submission skills, Riddle went 7-3 in the UFC, only being stopped by the inflated ego of Dana White.\"\n\n*Video then shows Riddle's dominant run across the independent wrestling circuit*\n\nHeyman: \"Dana White's mistake was the wrestling world's blessing, as Matt Riddle set out to prove his dominance in the world of professional wrestling. And anyone with a working set of eyes has to say that Riddle succeeded in his mission. From beating the likes of Zack Sabre Jr., Will Ospreay, Ricochet, and Drew Galloway, to winning accolades across numerous different promotions, Matt Riddle has proven himself to be an unstoppable machine.\"\n\n*We then cut to Matt Riddle standing inside a MMA octagon*\n\nMatt Riddle: \"But now bro, I've got something to prove. Have you ever been so close to achieving your dreams, just for a bunch of corporate yes men to take it away from you at the last second? Well, I'll tell you something, it sucks. So when I see these people like Nic Nemeth and Matt Cardona talk about how they're hot sh*t, it pisses me off bro. That's why I've decided to throw my hat into the National Wrestling Alliance, because the only thing that can stop a bunch of arrogant jackasses is The King of Bros!\"\n\n*Riddle gives a thumbs up and flashes a smile*\n\nRiddle: \"But before I go, let's just get one thing clear. Anyone who's standing in my way of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, whether it's Nic Nemeth, Matt Cardona, Mustafa Ali, whoever, there's only three ways you're leaving the ring. It's TAP, NAP, OR SNAP BRO!\"\n\n-FIN-\n\nNWA Youtube Channel- January 15th, 2024\n\nReclaiming the Glory Part Two: The Women of the National Wrestling Alliance\n\nPaul Heyman: \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

She seems to get the best of him at few occasions, but he's a legend in the business for a reason, and ultimately is able to gain control over his daughter.*\n\nRobbie Brookside: \"Patience Xia, you've got to cover up those holes in your defense or you'll get taken over each time!\"\n\nXia Brookside: \"I'm trying dad. You know, I'm no slouch in here right?\"\n\nRobbie: \"Of course, you're a wonderful athlete, but you're too rough around the edges. You need to get that killer instinct in order to get to the next level.\"\n\nXia: \"Really dad?\"\n\nRobbie: \"Yeah Xia, you're just like me when I started. I was young, naive, couldn't tell a wristlock from a wristwatch, just like you.\"\n\nXia: \"What did you just say?\"\n\nRobbie: \"I'm telling you that you're in over your head, you don't belong here Xia. Go home, go to school, do something else.\"\n\nXia: \"That's it, I'll show you what Xia Brookside is all about!\"\n\n*With that, Xia lunges at her father and is quickly able to lock him in a kneebar. Within seconds, Robbie is tapping out.\n\nRobbie: *panting heavily* \"That's my girl! I Just said all that because I knew it would awaken something in you. You're definitely ready.\"\n\nXia: \"Heh, thanks dad. Now, if you need me, I've got my sights on a certain NWA World Women's Title...\"\n\nPretty Powerful (Megan Bayne & Steph de Lander)\n\n*Video plays showing Megan Bayne doing pullups and sled pushes, interspersed with her wrestling in Japan*\n\nMegan Bayne: \"My name's Megan Bayne. Some call me a Greek Goddess, but I just call myself pretty powerful!\"\n\n*Video then plays showing Steph de Lander lifting weights and doing pushups, interspersed with her wide variety of indy matches*\n\nSteph de Lander: \"And my name's Steph de Lander. Some call me a powerhourse, but I just call myself pretty powerful!\"\n\n*The two then meet up and share an Arnold Schwarzenegger/Carl Weathers from Predator handshake*\n\nSteph & Megan: \"TOGETHER, WE ARE PRETTY POWERFUL!\"\n\n*The two women strike a pose before they are interrupted by a doorbell ringing. They go and answer the door to find a young blonde guy in a pizza delivery guy's uniform*\n\n???: \"Did somebody order a pizza?\"\n\nSteph: \"Uh, no.\"\n\n*Before Steph can slam the door shut on him he falls to his knees and begins to beg*\n\n???: \"PLEASE, I'VE SEEN BOTH OF YOU WRESTLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD, I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, JUST LET ME DO SOMETHING!\"\n\nMegan: \"Anything?\"\n\n???: \"YES, ANYTHING!\"\n\nSteph: \"Okay, how about you serve as our little \"problem-solver,\" it's a better job than whatever the hell you're doing now.\"\n\n???: \"OH THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! I PROMISE I WON'T LET YOU DOWN! My name's Bodhi by the way-\"\n\nMegan: \"Not anymore! If you really want to run with us, you need a whole new makeover. From now on, your new name is Brady!\"\n\nSteph: \"Yeah! Now Brady, go get our bags for us, we need to get to a place that needs us desperately.\"\n\nBrady: \"Of course m'am, where is that if I may ask?\"\n\nSteph & Megan: \"THE NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE!\"\n\n\"All-American\" Santana Garrett\n\nPaul Heyman voiceover: \"If you're a female wrestler who has paid her dues on the independent scene, chances are that you have faced Santana Garrett at one point or another. The 15-year veteran Santana Garrett brings a worldwide flavor to the National Wrestling Alliance, having wrestled for companies like TNA, STARDOM, AEW, and WWE. Hell, she's the only one on the women's roster to have actually won the NWA World Women's Championship, holding it for over 300 days back in 2015. Now, she'll look to get one more run at the top before her illustrious career comes to a close!\"\n\n-LOCATION: THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE OWNER PAUL HEYMAN- PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA-\n\n*Paul Heyman is busy doing some sort of paperwork before he hears a knock at his door*\n\nPaul Heyman: \"Come in!\"\n\n*Former NWA World Women's Champion Kenzie Paige bursts in!*\n\nHeyman: \"What do you want?\"\n\nKenzie Paige: \"Hi Paul, I was just here to ask for a spot in the new and improved NWA women's division. Considering I was the most recent NWA World Women's Champion, I think you should give me another shot.\"\n\nHeyman: \"Oh, you're that Kenzie Paige chick. Yeah, no, we don't want anything to do with the old NWA, sorry Ms. Paige, you can leave now.\"\n\nPaige: \"I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying. I'm telling you that you NEED me on the new NWA women's division.\"\n\nHeyman: \"Well, I don't think you heard me, I'm saying that I don't want ANYTHING to do with the old NWA, so bye bye.\"\n\n*Paige then approaches Paul Heyman and grabs him by his collar*\n\nHeyman: \"Hey! What are you doi-\"\n\nPaige: \"PAUL! I AM BETTER THAN ANY OF THOSE EMPTY-HEADED BITCHES THAT YOU SIGNED. I WAS THE LAST NWA WORLD WOMEN'S CHAMPION FOR HELL'S SAKE!\"\n\nHeyman: \"OKAY! OKAY! FINE! YOU'RE ON THE ROSTER ON ONE CONDITION!\"\n\n*Paige lets go of Heyman*\n\nPaige: \"Ok Paul, spit it out.\"\n\n*Heyman cracks a smile*\n\nHeyman: \"Kenzie Paige, you are officially a member of the National Wrestling Alliance's revamped roster, but if you fail to win the NWA World Women's Championship by the end of 2024, then YOU WILL BE FIRED!\"\n\n*Paige initially hesitates at first, but then a convinced grin emerges on her face*\n\nPaige: \"Paul, BRING! IT! ON!\"\n\n\"The Influence\" Tenille Dashwood\n\n*We cut to a gorgeous sandy beach, where Tenille Dashwood is just wrapping up a bikini photoshoot. She saunters off set and grabs a glass of champagne before speaking to the camera*\n\nTenille Dashwood: \"Hello you disgusting rubes. My name is Tenille Dashwood and I have decided to grace the National Wrestling Alliance with my prescence. Why? Because the National Wrestling Alliance NEEDS someone like me. They need someone beautiful, they need someone stunning, they need to experience \"The Influence!\"\n\n*Dashwood sips her champagne*\n\nDashwood: \"So to all you uggos watching at home and to all the wannabe Tenilles on the roster, g'day to you. Drink that in, because that will be the highest praise you'll ever receive from someone as pretty as me! Get ready world, because Tenille Dashwood is coming to the National Wrestling Alliance to win the World Women's Championship and spread \"The Influence\" across the globe!\"\n\nPaul Heyman: \"And that's all the time we have for this edition of Reclaiming the Glory!

Y'know, I said I always wanted to wrestle the best women's wrestlers in the world and win a lot of gold in the process, so what better place to do it than in the National Wrestling Alliance! Paul! I know you're looking for a new NWA World Women's Champion. Let me tell you something, you're looking at her right now! And you can...\n\nBANK\n\nON\n\nTHAT!\n\n-FIN-\n\nNWA Youtube Channel- January 22nd, 2024\n\nReclaiming the Glory Part Three: The Teams of the National Wrestling Alliance\n\nPaul Heyman: \"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! My name is Paul Heyman! Now, if you don't know by now, which you definitely should by this point, I am the new proprietor of the National Wrestling Alliance. As such, I have decided to \"refresh\" the roster. Over the last few weeks, you've seen the newest additions to the men's and women's rosters, so in today's edition of Reclaiming the Glory, let's take a look at the backbone of the new National Wrestling Alliance, the tag team division!\"\n\nThe Von Erichs (Ross & Marshall Von Erich)\n\n-LOCATION: THE VON ERICH RANCH- BOERNE, TEXAS-\n\n*We cut to a wrestling ring inside a barn, where the legendary Kevin Von Erich is watching his sons Ross & Marshall Von Erich train*\n\nKevin Von Erich: \"No Ross, you don't have the Claw locked all the way in, Marshall can easily escape.\"\n\nRoss Von Erich: \"C'mon dad, we've been training for hours now!\"\n\nMarshall Von Erich: \"Yeah dad, I think we're doing pretty good.\"\n\nKevin: \"Pretty good isn't going to cut it in the National Wrestling Alliance guys. Sit down, let me tell you about the family history with the NWA if you really want to understand why I'm pushing you guys so hard.\"\n\n*Ross & Marshall break their hold and start listening to their father*\n\nKevin: \"Well, it all started back when your granddad was wrestling. He did everything to get a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but he just never got it. That really angered him and he passed that anger onto me and my brothers, may God rest their souls. Your uncle David was supposed to win the NWA Wold Title, but he sadly passed away before he could. Then your uncle Kerry entered the scene, took David's spot, and beat the legendary Ric Flair to win the ten pounds of gold. As for me? I had some opportunities, but I just couldn't get it done sadly. So now I want you two boys to follow in the Von Erich Family footsteps. Go on to the National Wrestling Alliance and win those NWA World Tag Team Championships!\"\n\n*Ross & Marshall nod in agreement*\n\nKevin: \"And hey, maybe one day you'll one-up your old man and actually win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship!\"\n\nRoss & Marshall (at the same time): \"I will dad!\" \"Hey, wait a minute!\"\n\n*Kevin laughs*\n\nKevin: \"Alright boys, one more round of training and then it's time for supper. Let's get to it!\"\n\nThe Outrunners (Turbo Floyd & Truth Magnum)\n\n*The video feed suddenly drops in quality as some cheesy 80s power metal starts to play. Scenes then pop up showing two men participating in a generic 80s training montage. From working out in the gym to running across town, this one's got all the hallmarks of a cheesy action move montage. The montage eventually ends with the two men exchanging a big high five, freeze-framing in mid-air*\n\nTURBO FLOYD, TRUTH MAGNUM, THE OUTRUNNERS, COMING SOON TO THE NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE\n\n-LOCATION: VIOLENCE IS FOREVER DOJO, UNKNOWN AREA OUTSIDE OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA-\n\nDan Lambert: \"Hello you disgusting slobs watching from your mom's basement. My name's Dan Lambert, the head of American Top Team and the newest leader of the most dangerous group of wrestlers around today, Violence is Forever! Let's show you around the dojo to see what these deadly warriors are truly made of...\n\n*Lambert first approaches a sort-of kickboxing area, where Janai Kai is training*\n\nLambert: \"This is Janai Kai. We like to call her our \"Kick Demon.\" Why? If you would so kindly demonstrate on this dummy Janai.\"\n\n*Lambert then pulls out a dummy on a cart and places it in front of Kai. Lambert then gives Kai the signal and Kai hits the dummy's head with a high kick so powerful it sends the dummy's head flying off its body!*\n\nLambert: \"Now that's what I call losing your mind!\"\n\n*Lambert then approaches a jiu-jitsu area, where Dominic Garrini is sparring with an opponent*\n\nLambert: \"This right here is Dominic Garrini. He's VIF's resident \"Bone Collector.\" Now Dominic, can you show this poor guy you're working with here why you earned that nickname?\"\n\n*Garrini nods and quickly locks the opponent in an armbar. Within seconds, a loud pop is heard and the guy immediately taps out*\n\nLambert: \"Add another one to the collection! Good job Dominic!\"\n\n*Lambert then heads over to a wrestling mat, where a random dude is trying to warm up*\n\nLambert: \"Finally, we have Kevin Ku. We call him...\"\n\n*Suddenly, the random dude trying to warm up is taken down from behind by Kevin Ku! Ku quickly locks him in a rear naked choke and makes him pass out within seconds*\n\nLambert: \"That's exactly why we call him \"No Warning\" Kevin Ku!\"\n\n*Kai & Garrini then make their way to where Lambert & Ku are standing. Kai, Garrini, & Ku then gather behind Lambert*\n\nLambert: \"With Janai Kai about to take over the women's division and Garrini & Ku getting those NWA World Tag Team Titles in no time, Violence is Forever will be on top of the National Wrestling Alliance in no time! Now tell me guys, why are we so dangerous?\"\n\nKai, Garrini, & Ku: \"BECAUSE VIOLENCE IS FOREVER!\"\n\nLambert: \"Heh, you're damn right it is\"\n\nHEAVY METAL MAYHEM (WARHORSE & BOOGZ)\n\n*Heavy metal music begins playing. It kind of sounds like a weird mix of Megadeth and Pantera, but before the copyright lawyers can sue, we cut to a gym, where WARHORSE and BOOGZ are lifting weights. The two men are working out like mad men, their eyes bulging and both men yelling at nearly all times. The men then share an Arnold Schwarzenegger/Carl Weathers from Predator handshake before screaming at the camera.*\n\nWARHORSE & BOOGZ: \"HEAVY METAL MAYHEM! WE'RE COMING TO ROCK!\"\n\n*BOOGZ then pulls an electric guitar out and begins shredding a sick solo as the video package comes to a close*\n\nGrizzled Young Veterans (James Drake & Zack Gibson)\n\nPaul Heyman Voiceover: \"If you want to talk about the British wrestling scene over the last decade, you can't not talk about James Drake & Zack Gibson, the Grizzled Young Veterans. With their combination of technical wrestling and pure ruthlessness, there's a reason why these two have probably become the most successful tag team to emerge out of the UK since The British Bulldogs! Now they bring their talents to the National Wrestling Alliance in hopes of adding some more gold to their collection!\"\n\nZack Gibson: \"I AM LIVERPOOL'S NUMBER ONE, ZACK GIBSON. THIS IS BLACKPOOL'S NUMBER ONE JAMES DRAKE. TOGETHER WE ARE GRIZZLED YOUNG VETERANS, SOON TO BE RECOGNIZED AS THE NWA'S NUMBER ONE!\"\n\nThe Dreadlock Demolition Machines (Bojack & Tankman)\n\n-LOCATION: UNDERGROUND FIGHT CLUB, LOCATION UNKNOWN-\n\n*We see two guys completely wrecking everyone that tries to fight them. They're destroying them and then talking metric tons of shit about it. The guys ask for their next opponents, telling the ringleader that they're guaranteeing that whoever steps up will be put in the dirt! The ringleader smiles and yells \"BRING OUT THE DDM!\" That's when Bojack & Tankman emerge onto the scene! The two guys are completely shocked and are instantly outmatched when Bojack and Tankman use their immense strength to quickly overpower them. Bojack finishes off one of the guys with a huge spinebuster onto the floor, while Tankman finishes off the other with a big chokebomb through a table! Bojack & Tankman stand tall as the rest of the fight club cheers in approval*\n\nTHE DREADLOCK DEMOLITION MACHINES, COMING SOON TO THE NATIONAL WRESTLING ALLIANCE\n\nMxM (Mansoor & Mason Madden)\n\n*We cut to what appears to be a storage closet, when suddenly we hear someone trying to kick the door. It fails and the guy lets out a big \"DAMN IT!\" before we hear another kick, which is successful. Mason Madden confidently strides in, while Mansoor tails behind him, favoring his leg*\n\nMansoor: \"C'mon, this is the best you guys can do?\"\n\nMason Madden: \"A storage closet? Really? For the hottest tag team in the world MxM?\"\n\nMansoor: \"THAT'S HORSE SHI-\"\n\n*TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVIENCE*\n\nMansoor: \"Ok, ok, I'm calm, don't worry.\"\n\nMadden: \"You sure?\"\n\nMansoor: \"OF COURSE I'M SURE MASON! Anyway, sorry for the rude welcome, you can thank to ol' Paul E for that. My name is Mansoor.\"\n\nMadden: \"And I'm Mason Madden.\"\n\nMansoor: \"Together, we are...\"\n\nMadden & Mansoor: \"MXM!\"\n\nMadden: \"Now, I'm sure you've seen all the cool new tag teams in this video so far. At least, I hope you have, because if we're not going on last, then Paul's got a big problem.\"\n\nMansoor: \"What my partner was trying to say before he got sidetracked was that all those tag teams are lacking one thing that me & Mason have. Let's say it on three Mason. 1! 2! 3!\"\n\nMansoor & Madden: \"THE INSIDE SCOOPS!\"\n\nMadden: \"Now, what does that mean?\"\n\nMansoor: \"It means that we know everything before our opponents know anything!\"\n\nMadden: \"And that's exactly the reason why we're coming to the National Wrestling Alliance.\"\n\nMansoor: \"And show all you jabronis why MxM are always on top!\"\n\nMadden: \"Never bottoms, that's right!\"\n\nMansoor: \"You can call us power tops if you will.\"\n\nMadden: \"Manny, no that's not what that means. Anyway, Watch out NWA, because MxM are here and we're not leaving until we're on top with all the power!\"\n\nMansoor: \"See, power tops!\"\n\nMadden: \"NO, NOT LIKE THAT!\"\n\nPaul Heyman: \"And that's all the time we have for today. Thank you all for watching the Reclaiming The Glory series and we hope you stick around to catch the debut episode of NWA Main Event on FS2 next Thursday.
