last commercial break too early.” Note from the Kids Block Blog: This error was caused by Fox Kids’ scheduling department, not the engineers. / Someone else wrote this about PRTF: “In all three Fox Kids airings, “The End of Time, Pt. 1” featured Cyclobots speaking to Ransik via backmasking. When reversed back to normal, they could be heard to say “You are the size of a [censored] condo” and “You bitch, that’s too much money.” Starting with Disney’s VHS release in April 2002, these lines were replaced with new voices saying clean versions of the same lines: “Hey, sir, you are the size of a condo” and “That’s too much money”, though still presented reversed. Disney’s airings always used this revised version (first shown on ABC Family on November 17, 2002).”)\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “The End of Time, Pt. 1” [three part season finale]\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters: “The Saga of the Devas” [90 min.]\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters: ———-\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters: ———-\n\nMon Colle Knights:\n\nAlienators: Evolution Continues:\n\nMonday, November 5, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/5/01- The “next time” segment was cut out.)\n\nLife With Louie: “Do It or Donut”\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Time Force Traitor”\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nTuesday, November 6, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/6/01- The “next time” segment was cut out.)\n\nThe Woody Woodpecker Show:\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Jen’s Revenge” (re-edited)\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nWednesday, November 7, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/7/01- The “next time” segment was cut out.)\n\nThe Woody Woodpecker Show:\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Undercover Rangers”\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nThursday, November 8, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/8/01- The “next time” segment was cut out.)\n\nThe Woody Woodpecker Show:\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Reflections of Evil”\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nFriday, November 9, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/9/01- The “next time” segment was cut out.)\n\nAM The Greatest Hero of them All: “Storm Front”\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Trust and Triumph” (re-edited)\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nSaturday, November 10, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/10/01- The “next time” segment was cut out.)\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “The End of Time, Pt. 2” [three part season finale continues]\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters: “Digital Beauty”\n\nMedabots:\n\nThe Ripping Friends:\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters: “Impmon’s Last Stand”\n\nMon Colle Knights:\n\nAlienators: Evolution Continues:\n\nMonday, November 12, 2001\n\nLife with Louie: “A Fish Called Pepper”\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Nadira’s Dream Date”\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nTuesday, November 13, 2001\n\nThe Woody Woodpecker Show:\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “Circuit Unsure”\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nWednesday, November 14, 2001\n\nThe Woody Woodpecker Show:\n\nTransformers: Robots in Disguise:\n\nPower Rangers Time Force: “A Calm Before the Storm”\n\nDigimon: Digital Monsters:\n\nThursday, November 15, 2001\n\n-(About “Power Rangers Time Force” on 11/15/01- I don’t know if they actually did it or not, but, the “missing 13 seconds” error was scheduled to happen again.
