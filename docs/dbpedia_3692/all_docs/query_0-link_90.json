        "text": "name: John Cooper, Jr.\n\nnickname: Jackie\n\nborn Sep. 15, 1922, in Los Angeles, CA\n\ndied May 3, 2011, in Santa Monica, CA, of natural causes\n\nSpecial note: Maltin & Bann indicate that Jackie's birth name may have been John Cooperman, Jr. According to Jackie's autobiography, his father may have originally been named Cooperman, but he seemed fairly unsure about the truth of it, which I think would imply that Jackie himself never had the name. Jackie's father abandoned his small family when Jackie was two, and the boy lived in a poor neighborhood with his mother, grandmother, two aunts and an underaged uncle.\n\n1928\n\nAccording to the December 1930 issue of Playmate (a publication for kids), Jackie had appeared in some Lloyd Hamilton comedies. Reportedly, this occurred when he was three years old, which would place it in 1926 at the latest. However, Harrison Carroll, in his May 31, 1931, column, and INS, in a Sep. 4, 1931, article, stated that Jackie's debut was in a Lloyd Hamilton comedy \"three years ago,\" which would place it in 1928. This year is also corroborated by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch of Sep. 23, 1931. INS also added that he was 5 years old at the time, which fits. Alternately, on July 11, 1931, the Associated Press reported that Jackie had been 4 years old when this happened, which would place it no later than 1927. It should be noted, though, that the press was in the habit of shaving a year or two off of Jackie's age by that time. Whenever it happened, Jackie's grandmother, at the time, was turning up at various studios looking for work as an extra, and found that her luck improved when she brought Jackie along, as they would get two extras for the price of one. Jackie wrote in his autobiography that he worked as an extra in dozens of films, but only during school vacations.\n\n1929\n\nSometime early this year, or perhaps in late 1928, Jackie's mother, who was working at Fox as a rehearsal pianist, heard that the studio was casting for the part of a small boy in the upcoming \"Fox Movietone Follies Of 1929.\" Jackie auditioned and got the role, as well as a second part in \"Sunny Side Up.\"\n\nOn May 15th, Jackie worked in the Our Gang series for the first time, albeit as a day player.\n\nOn September 1st, Jackie was put under long-term contract, earning $50 a week. Apparently, the contract had been signed back in July and was a two-year contract. Jackie was said to have a photographic memory, which aided him in memorizing dialogue.\n\nOn November 15th, Jackie, along with Mary Ann Jackson, entertained at a party for the Los Angeles Evening Express newsboys.\n\nAt the end of the year, Jackie's salary was increased to $60 a week.\n\nFox Movietone Follies Of 1929 (uncredited role: little boy)\n\nMay 25, 1929 - Fox - talkie - 14 reels - feature\n\n©May 8, 1929 as William Fox Movietone Follies Of 1929.

This was broadcast from the KHJ studio in Hollywood.\n\nAt the beginning of June, Jackie's salary was increased to $75 a week.\n\nOn September 2nd, Jackie's salary was increased to $100 a week.\n\nOn September 20th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported that Jackie was taking dance instruction from Roy Randolph.\n\nOn September 27th, The Washington Times (DC) reported that Paramount was currently negotiating with Hal Roach to borrow Jackie for the forthcoming film production of \"Skippy.\"\n\nOn October 26th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"The campaigning for and against daylight saving can go on. Skippy has been found. The little rascal, the up-to-date Peck's bad boy, has been tracked down at the Hal Roach studio. His name is Jackie Cooper. Notice the similarity to Jackie Coogan. Hal Roach has loaned Master Cooper to Paramount and one of these days soon we shall have a chance to see how Norman Taurog, director, visualizes 'Skippy.' It's a great responsibility for any director or any film for Percy Crosby has made more breakfasts happy with 'Skippy' than any other newspaper character.\"\n\nOn November 7th, it was announced that a \"Christmas Cheer\" matinee was being planned for the Fox Criterion on December 6th, which would include Jackie Cooper and Mary Ann Jackson among its stars.\n\n95.

Percy L. Crosby's cartoon boy came to life in the cherubic, blue-eyed, yellow-haired, six-year-old person of Jackie Cooper, a member of Our Gang. Skippy goes to work pretty quick on the Paramount lot where Tom Sawyer recently came to life. He says he thinks he'll like it better at Paramount than he did at Roach's, where the Our Gang comedies are made. Paramount has a soda fountain, and his mother gives him ten cents a day to spend.\"\n\nOn January 31st, the Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"In all the history of the screen, no actor ever lived his role more thoroughly than does Jackie Cooper, the blond, tousle-haired lead in 'Skippy.' Jackie looks, walks, talks, acts and probably sleeps like the very incarnation of Percy Crosby's famous comic-strip character. They have given him the battered hat, dilapidated coat and abbreviated trousers of the newspaper Skippy. And Nature did the rest, furnishing two bow legs, prominent knees, an impudent nose and tow-head.\"\n\nOn February 17th, the News Banner of Murfressboro, TN, published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn February 28th, the Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"They are wondering out at Paramount just how much calculation Robert Coogan, brother of Jackie, puts in his wise cracks. In a scene in 'Skippy,' Jackie Cooper has 15 speeches to remember. Robert has one and it is 'I dunno.' In the midst of shooting, Jackie went up in his lines. 'What's the matter?' asked Robert, 'Can't you learn your lines? I'm up in mine.' \"\n\nOn March 3rd, The Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper, who plays the lead in 'Skippy' at Paramount knows all about how hard it is to pronounce difficult words. He was playing a scene with Willard Robertson, as a doctor, was explaining to Skippy why the Shantytown part of their city should be wiped out. 'Places like Shantytown provide dangerous sociological juxtapositions,' said the doctor. Director Norman Taurog explained to Jackie his next move. 'When you hear those big words, Jackie, you look worried and puzzled. Skippy doesn't know what on earth they mean.' 'I know how he feels!' said Jackie, 'Gee, I can't hardly pronounce them myself!' \"\n\nOn March 7th, United Press published the latest installment of Ronald W. Wagoner's column, an excerpt from which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on March 7th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"The adorable baby, Jackie Cooper, who has been loaned to Paramount by Hal Roach, has a new contract. Jackie will play the small boy in 'Big Brother,' opposite Richard Dix. The boy part is really second in importance. If Jackie continues to be so much in demand he will soon be raking in as many dollars as Jackie Coogan. Let's hope his family will be as sensible about investing his earnings as the Coogans were in the days when Jackie ranked with the highest paid stars on the screen.\" \"Big Brother\" was the working title for \"Young Donovan's Kid.\" Jackie was loaned out to RKO from March to April.\n\nOn March 12th, the Daily News of New York reported that Jackie was being considered for the lead role in \"Peck's Bad Boy.\" This never wound up happening.\n\nOn March 17th, the Los Angeles Evening Express included the following in Eileen Percy's column: \"I have seen many an actor play an emotional scene that has brought tears to the eyes of a few on-lookers on the set, but yesterday I saw 6-year-old Jackie Cooper play a scene with Richard Dix for 'Big Brother' that brought tears to the eyes of all. He brought an awful lump to my throat - and that's something.\"\n\nOn April 2nd, The Dayton Herald (OH) reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper, who plays the role of 'Skippy,' is quite fond of dogs, and one of his greatest concerns during the making of the picture was that the division of time between acting and attending school, allowed him no great chance to adopt and take care of one of the pups used in the picture.\"\n\nOn April 5th, the Joplin Globe (MO) reported the following about \"Skippy\": \"After looking over more than 500 potential Skippys, Paramount found itself a bit bewildered but not discouraged. Then someone thought of Jackie Cooper, nine-year-old youngster of 'Our Gang' fame. Cooper was rushed to the studios. Directors, writers, assistant producers, even obscure script girls, took one look at Jackie and grinned. Here was a made to order Skippy, a living counterpart of Percy Crosby's nationally successful cartoon creation. Within twenty-four hours microphones were set up and cameras grinding while director Norman Taurog, faced with a most important directorial assignment put Jackie Cooper, Mitzi Green, Robert Coogan (brother of Jackie Coogan), Jackie Searl and countless others through their amusing, joy spreading paces.\"\n\nOn April 6th, the Pasadena Post (CA) reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper, six-years-old, has the part of 'Skippy,' in the picture of that name. And he wants to be a football player more than he does an actor. And if he can't be that he'd like to write. The last choice is be an actor. Isn't that always the case? Well, Jackie has his idea of what kind of picture he likes, too. It suits him when there is lots of shooting. War pictures delight him and westerns are all right. He plays with wooden guns. Jackie is making a lot of money in the films. He hasn't got to the point where that bothers him.\"\n\nOn April 10th, The Mansfield News (OH) published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn April 11th, Louella Parsons wrote about Jackie in her syndicated column, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on April 11th, the Portland Evening Express (ME) shared the following anecdote about Jackie: \"(Norman) Taurog tells two stories of Jackie's characteristics. One happened the day before Christmas when Taurog had Jackie at his home to help decorate the tree. After it was in order, Taurog ordered Jackie to keep his hands entirely off the lights. A short time later, from the next room, the director heard a terrific crash and rushed in to see the tree resting on the floor. \"Jackie, I told you to leave that tree alone,\" he shouted. \"No, you didn't,\" Jackie replied. \"You just mentioned the lights.\" (The other story is the United Press one mentioned above from March 7th.)\n\nOn April 17th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Hal Roach has begun to realize that he has a find in Jackie Cooper. He ought to realize it after 'Skippy.' At any rate, Mr. Roach now plans to keep Jackie right on the home lot and feature him in a series of pictures. He has signed Marshall Neilan to write, direct and supervise, and one of his first assignments will probably be the Jackie Cooper pictures. Mickey, you see, understands child psychology. He directed 'Penrod' some years ago and owns some of the screen rights to this story.\"\n\nOn April 22th, the ninth annual benefit of National Variety Artists took place at the Shrine Auditorium. Among the multitude of stars that took part was Jackie Cooper.\n\nOn May 9th, Walter Winchell published a poem dedicated to Jackie in his syndicated column, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn May 10th, the Decatur Herald (IL) published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn May 16th, the Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"Rumors that Jackie Cooper, juvenile star who scored a sweeping success in the title-role of 'Skippy,' would be bought by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, were given credence at the studio today. It is reported that M. G. M. has discovered a boy-story that would afford Cooper another chance to play a starred role such as he had in 'Skippy.' If it is possible to secure the services of the boy, M. G. M. will buy the story. Although he has been loaned to Paramount and R. K. O., Jackie is under contract to Hal Roach, where he was discovered and given his first training in pictures. His contract has some four years yet to run with the Roach unit. The fact that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer releases Hal Roach comedies lends weight to the report that young Cooper may eventually make M. G. M. his permanent home, at a handsome profit to the Roach studios.\"\n\nOn May 17th, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported the following: \"The explosive effect of fame derived from an outstanding performance in one picture is now being illustrated in miniature through the experience of Jackie Cooper. Before 'Skippy' people had difficulty in identifying him as one of the kids in the 'Our Gang' comedies. Following his hit in 'Skippy,' Jackie is now being featured prominently in advertisements for the latest comedy of that group, and soon fan magazines should begin asking him for beauty recipes.\"\n\nOn May 19th, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Seen with Richard Dix in one of the leading roles in 'Donovan's Kid'...Jackie Cooper's hobbies are eating and collecting the autographs of screen stars. Recently featured in the title part of 'Skippy,' Jackie proudly showed after Dix had signed that his book contained the signatures of 139 other front rank luminaries. His grandmother, who takes his mother's place while the latter is away on a vaudeville tour, declares the boy's foremost concern, regardless of time or place, is food.\"\n\nOn May 20th, Louella Parsons reported on Jackie in her syndicated column, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn May 21st, Harrison Carroll reported on Jackie in his syndicated column, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn May 22nd, Mollie Merrick wrote the following in her syndicated column: \"A little blond boy with winning ways, a snub nose and a world of devilment behind his laughing eyes, has put most of the male heroes off the boards of late. Jackie Cooper has received the accolade from producers with a good fat contract. Fifteen hundred dollars a week isn't so bad - when you're 7 years of age. The little Heifetz possibly equalled this at 7 - but he was a child prodigy of the violin. And the original Jackie Coogan at 7, was no slouch - as we say in our quaint American fashion. Most significant detail of all is the fact that Jackie Cooper is now considered one of the prime factors in that most necessary move in Hollywood - getting the children back into the theater. That is the slogan for 1932. Child actors can do it in perfection, it seems. But oh! the adults I have heard raving over little Cooper!\"\n\nAlso on May 22nd, the Daily News of New York reported the following: \"Little Jackie Cooper is to be back where he started from, if Hal Roach has his way. Roach, producer of the 'Our Gang' comedies, was tickled to see Jackie of the gang get a big break in 'Skippy' and 'Donovan's Kid.' So tickled, in fact, that he has asked for Master Cooper for the title role in 'Oliver Twist,' which Dickens tale was done silently and splendidly by Jackie Coogan, you'll recall. Roach is to make the film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer release. Looks as though Jackie gets the part.\" This film was never produced.\n\nOn May 23rd, the Los Angeles Record published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn May 28th, the Illustrated Daily News published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on May 28th, The Morning Press of Santa Barbara reported the following: \"Metro is making a hurried search for a story in which it can team Marie Dressler and Jackie Cooper, figuring that the youngster and Miss Dressler as a team can't miss. Several writers have been called in for ideas and old mother-and-son scripts are being looked over for something suitable. Picture will be sandwiched into the schedule ahead of the next Dressler-Moran story, a Reno yarn.\"\n\nAlso on May 28th, Jimmy Starr wrote the following in his syndicated column: \"Now that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has the kid sensation of the age, Jackie Cooper, firmly under contract, right from under the nose of Paramount, the studio is scouting around madly for a story. Jackie was all slated for several at Paramount, but Hal Roach, who had him under contract, turned the agreement over to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a nice piece of change. Now Paramount is after another youngster. MGM is thinking of doing 'Oliver Twist,' in which Jackie Coogan appeared, with young Cooper. Personally, I think this is a terrible choice for the boy. What he should have is another 'Skippy.' \"\n\nOn May 29th, Eileen Percy reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Contrary to published reports, little Jackie Cooper has not yet signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. I understand that the negotiations between Hal Roach, who has Jackie under contract, and MGM, are at a standstill at present and unless satisfactory terms can be arranged, Jackie will remain on the Roach payroll.\" This story was reported a bit late, as Jackie had already left the Roach studio a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nAlso on May 29th, the Fitchburg Sentinel (MA) reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper, juvenile actor, who received $75 per week from Hal Roach to appear in his comedies is said to have signed a contract with Metro for $25,000 a year for the next two years.\"\n\nOn May 30th, the Los Angeles Evening Standard published a review written by Jackie himself, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on May 30th, Universal Service published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on May 30th, Louella Parsons reported on Jackie in her syndicated column, an excerpt of which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn May 31st, the Portland Sunday Telegram and Sunday Press Herald (ME) reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper, juvenile find, contracted for four years to Hal Roach at $50 weekly when idle and $75 when working, is closing with Metro this week for two years at $25,000 gross for both years. Amount is a fraction of what Warners and Howard Hughes offered, highest of which was $2,000 weekly. Roach favored Metro owing to past distribution affiliations.\"\n\nOn June 5th, the Hollywood Daily Citizen reported the following: \"Last but equally interesting in the M-G-M announcements today is that concerning 7-year-old Jackie Cooper. Jackie sat down at a desk opposite Louis B. Mayer to discuss the economic situation and finished the conference by signing a long-term contract which will serve to at least warn away the wolves from his door. 'What do you think of the business depression?' the star was asked after the interview. 'I think it's grand!' said Jackie.\"\n\nOn June 6th, the Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"'Skippy' has signed a long-term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 'Skippy' is young Jackie Cooper, former Hal Roach 'find' and erstwhile juvenile star. Through a deal with Roach, M-G-M secured his services for a period of five years. After the business meeting, Jackie went out on the set and opened negotiations with Buster Keaton and Wallace Beery for a studio football team. He picked Marion Davies' bungalow as a likely dressing room for the team, but agreed to wait for her return from Europe before moving her furnishings out.\"\n\nOn June 12th, The Minneapolis Star reported the following: \"What is the value of a film player's services? Stories of the huge salaries paid in the picture studios have been exaggerated in many instances. A record, however, appears to have been reached with little Jackie Cooper, the child player of 'Skippy' fame. At first Jackie, or his parents or manager, demanded $125,000 for two years' work but now he wants $20,000 a picture with a guarantee of 10 pictures in that time or $200,000 in all. Before Jackie received a salary of $100 a week which is not bad for a youngster.\"\n\nOn June 13th, Lloyd S. Thompson of The San Francisco Examiner related the following story told to him by the visiting Louella Parsons: \"I must tell you something precious about Skippy. He went to the photographers the other day to autograph a few pictures for his lady friends - Skippy insists upon doing his autographing - and there he met Mona Maris, whom he had never seen before. Miss Maris asked him for a photo, and Skippy proudly wrote: 'To my OLD friend Mona Maris, with love, Skippy,' on one and gave it to her.\"\n\nAlso on June 13th, the Los Angeles Record included this tidbit quoted from a New York paper: \"Jackie Cooper is a midget. He is 30 years old and has been touring the country for years in a sideshow.\"\n\nAlso on June 13th, The Times of Munster, IN, included some news about Jackie in their gossip column, an excerpt from which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn June 14th, the Los Angeles Times published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn June 25th, The Rushville Republican (IN) reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper has just received a beautiful wrist watch from Percy Crosby, engraved in appreciation of his work as 'Skippy.' In writing his own letter of thanks, the surprising youth penned: 'It's real gold, too, ain't it?' \"\n\nFrom June 27th to July 3rd, the Los Angeles convention of the National Education Association took place. Jackie was among several movie stars introduced to the assemblage in the first days of the convention.\n\nOn July 1st, The Los Angeles Record reported the following: \"It is war to the death between two of those temperamental Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stars. Jackie Cooper doesn't like La Garbo. He says so. Someone pointed out the glamorous Swede to him the other day and he just looked bored. 'I've seen her lots,' he said bitterly. 'Every time I want to go see a gangster film my mother takes me to see one of her pictures. She isn't box-office with little boys.' \"\n\nAlso on July 1st, NEA Service published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn July 2nd, Eileen Percy reported the following in her syndicated column: \"In Hollywood it's a sure sign one has reached the height of fame when they name a salad after you. Three days after Jackie Cooper signed his contract at Matro-Goldwyn-Mayer an elaborate salad appeared on the studio menu bearing his name, which consists of avacado, pear, orange and whipped cream.\"\n\nAlso on July 2nd, Hubbard Keavy wrote the following in his syndicated column: \"Funny how sluggish typewriters get. Little Jackie Cooper spends most of his spare time at his typewriter, writing about cowboys and Indians and Lindbergh. He has a portable machine.\"\n\nOn July 4th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported the following: \"A gigantic children's show, starring screen juveniles and comedians, will be Hollywood's part of the citywide movement for the benefit of the Parent-Teacher Association's fund for needy children, it was revealed today by Rupert Hughes, president of the Writers' Club. 'We in Hollywood have appreciated for some time the necessity of joining in the drive to aid the children,' Mr. Hughes said. 'A suitable plan, calling for a show July 12 at the Hollywood Playhouse, with child stars featured, has at last been suggested and we will back it wholeheartedly.' \" Among the kid stars who volunteered their services were Jackie Cooper and Mary Ann Jackson.\n\nAlso on July 4th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported the following: \"Jackie (Skippy) Cooper and Wallace Beery wil be costarred by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in a circus story. This is Jackie's first for MGM and he says circus yarns 'are just swell!' \"\n\nOn July 7th, Harrison Carroll reported the following in his syndicated column: \"A screen original, 'O'Shaughnessy's Boy,' will be Jackie Cooper's first vehicle for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The story is by Malcolm Stuart Boylan, who came into a nice piece of luck with the deal. His manuscript had been kicking around for four years without a bidder. Now, he gets one check for the idea and another for collaborating with Harvey Gates on the screen adaptation. Jackie's role in the story is that of a little boy who is adopted by an elephant trainer in a circus. Their adventures under the big top offer varied opportunities for the talented young hero of 'Skippy.' No directed is chosen as yet.\" The making of this film was delayed until 1935.\n\nAlso on July 7th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported the following: \"A list of prizes to be awarded golfers in the Mack Sennett junior golf tournament at the Westwood mashie links was announced this morning. The tournament will be played today, Wednesday (the 8th) and Thursday (the 9th). Boys between the ages of 8 and 16 are eligible. Andy Clyde, referee, will give a gold bag and set of clubs, Mack Sennett will offer two trophies, while 'Bing' Crosby and Jackie Cooper will each offer one trophy. The juniors qualify today and Wednesday, with the final round scheduled Thursday, at which time the field will be divided into two classes.\"\n\nOn July 8th, the Hollywood Reporter reported that Jackie would be among several child stars present at the Writers-Wampas benefit to be held on July 12th at the Hollywood Playhouse for the benefit of needy children. The Los Angeles Evening Post-Record described the benefit as \"By Children, for Children, to Help Children.\"\n\nOn July 11th, the Associated Press published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on July 11th, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles published the following: \"Jackie Cooper, hero of 'Skippy,' is wailing because Percy Crosby, creator of the cartoon kid, sent him a gold watch instead of a nickel one.

Mayer and other Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executives on a week-end fishing and yachting expedition, caught the biggest fish of anyone aboard, supplying the ship's cook with seafood for an entire meal.

For years he has been getting fan mail meant for Jack Cooper, who used to make comedies for Mack Sennett. Now he is getting mail intended to reach Jackie Cooper, the juvenile star at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It even follows him on his vacations. He was in Carmel recently and the postmaster arrived with a bundle of letters under his arm. 'I can't get these in the mail box,' he explained with a searching look, and added, 'How old are you, anyway?' \"\n\nOn August 4th, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nAlso on August 4th, NANA, Inc. reported the following: \"Don Marquis...will write the dialogue for Jackie Cooper's picture 'Sooky'...Before this picture goes into production, however, Jackie Cooper will make 'The Champ,' a prize fight story, in which he will play with Wallace Beery.\"\n\nOn August 11th, George Shaffer reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Jackie Cooper is the one lone male in Hollywood who goes to the Brown Derby who can appear at that fashionable eating place wearing no coat.

Wing related the following anecdote in his syndicated column: \"Jackie Cooper, the infantile star, stopping rehearsal as the camera started. Production ceased, the lights were struck.

'The Champ' is said to be one of the best submitted and will co-star Wallace Beery and Jackie. Those who have read this original by Francis Marion are more than enthusiastic about its screen possibilities. King Vidor, who directs the picture, intends to start rehearsals on Monday (the 24th) and young Jackie may now be seen going in and out of the wardrobe department most any hour with his ever-present package of chewing gum. I hear that one of my favorite stories, 'Limpy,' will be Jackie's next for M-G-M and Harry Pollard, who has been recently signed on a long term contract at this studio, will direct. 'Limpy' will offer new opportunities for this talented youngster and a tense study of a crippled boy's life, full of dramatic moments that tug at your heart strings and humorous incidents that will have you howling with laughter.\" \"Limpy\" was the working title for \"When A Feller Needs A Friend.\"\n\nOn August 23rd, The Napa Journal (CA) reported that there was talk of Jimmy Durante doing a film with Jackie Cooper.\n\nOn August 24th, Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper and Wallace Beery are flying together to Agua Caliente on location for 'The Champ,' their picture.

Jackie and his mother hadn't seen his father in years.\n\nOn August 28th, Eileen Percy reported the following in her column: \"To Jackie (Skippy) Cooper goes my complete admiration and a low and sweeping bow. This youngster's uncanny naturalness is to me more amazing than his brilliant acting. Yesterday he had a very difficult scene with Wallace Beery, in which he had a page or more of dialogue to deliver. It was an exceptionally long scene, and each time it was taken Jackie forgot a word or a line. After the fourth take, Jackie left the set and went off to a corner. Director King Vidor, thinking he wanted to be alone to go over his lines, waited. After a length of time he went after him. He found the young man in tears. King asked what was the crying for. 'Ah, gee, Mr. Vidor, I don't know. Maybe it's the heat, but I'll get it next time,' Jackie answered. With that he took off his plaid cap, wiped his tear-stained face, hurried into the scene, played it like an old trouper and never missed an if, and or but. What a kid!\"\n\nOn September 3rd, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Petition for the guardianship of Jackie Cooper, 8-year-old motion-picture actor, was filed in probate court by his mother, Mabel Leonard Cooper, yesterday, with the request that she be allowed to spend $1600 a month to support the child 'in his profession as juvenile actor.' Assets of the child are listed as a $50,000 thirteen-year endowment policy, $8000 in cash and a motion-picture contract calling for a salary of $1300 a week the first year up to $4000 a week the third year.

Caliente being the Monte Carlo of the West offers many diversions for players after working hours. Naturally all are looking forward to this location trip, but it holds no thrill for Jackie Cooper; the thing that is of most interest to him is the opportunity it offers of spending the night in a Pullman sleeper. When I asked him why he didn't fly down with Wallie Beery his reply was, 'Aw, mother won't let me get six feet off the ground.' \"\n\nAlso on September 4th, INS published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn September 6th, The Brooklyn Daily Times shared the following tidbit: \"Jackie Cooper has a cute little canvas-backed chair on the Metro stage marked 'Jackie'.\"\n\nOn September 7th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported that an electrical parade would wind around the Olympic Stadium on September 11th, as part of La Fiesta, a 10-day celebration of Los Angeles' 150th birthday.

There, to my surprise, I found the innocent reason for it all - Jackie Cooper. However, happiness is short-lived, and I realized I was but one of millions similary attached to this youthful Romeo, who, in the last few months, soared across the cinematic heavens to have the world at his feet. He was playing with a locomotive. It is needless to say that it is of far greater import to him than the bothersome business of acting in 'The Champ,' in which he is working with Wallace Beery.\"\n\nAlso on September 21st, Elizabeth Yeaman of the Hollywood Daily Citizen wrote about Jackie in her column, an excerpt of which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn September 23rd, H.

Mayer, including the following excerpt: \"Seven-year-old Jackie Cooper - chubby, snub-nosed, is L. B.'s favorite star on the lot. They are pals, go fishing together. L. B.'s influence over Jackie is greater than his mother's, greater than his idol's - Wallace Beery. When M. Mayer signed Jackie to a long-term contract - right from under the nose of Paramount which saw him first - the juvenile genius turned to his new boss and congratulated him on securing him. L. B. felt the same way.

I understand negotiations are now being made to purchase the 'Lucky Delano' series by Jennie Harris Olivier, which ran in one of the women's magazines. One of the stories, 'God Save Me a Son,' is to my way of thinking an ideal vehicle for Jackie. After watching this young Cooper at play and at work I am convinced he is not just an actor, he's more than that; he's your son and mine. He does the things they do; at times he says the very things they have said. Haven't you felt it? This is by way of tribute to Jackie because God gave me a son.\"\n\nAlso on October 15th, the Hollywood Daily Citizen reported that the cast of \"Sooky\" was on location in San Bernardino.\n\nOn October 17th, NANA, Inc. published an article on Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn October 21st, Jackie returned to MGM to do a few minor additions to \"The Champ.\" He returned to Paramount on October 22nd to resume work on \"Sooky.\"\n\nAlso on October 21st, Harrison Carroll reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Amusing but touched with pathos is the latest story about Jackie Cooper.

Over at M-G-M, they don't make me really cry.'\"\n\nOn October 27th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported the following: \"They're telling a cute one on Jackie (Skippy) Cooper, who is now making 'Sooky' for Paramount under Norman Taurog's direction. It seems that Jackie was doing a crying scene, but didn't quite get the genuine spirit Director Taurog wanted. 'Come on, Jackie' said Taurog, 'let's make this real. You're just acting and it's not genuine enough.'

Throughout the picture it was necessary to have a tutor on hand to make sure that Jackie's schooling would not be neglected. Once when it was time for Jackie to resume his studies he could not be found. Beery took it upon himself to locate the youngster. After a long search Beery finally located him talking earnestly to a group of stable boys alongside the race track, where the scenes were being filmed. 'For 2 cents,' said Beery, with a 'prop' frown, 'I'd turn you over my knee for running away from your teacher.' 'Listen, you,' replied Jackie, 'any time you want to train down to my weight, 72 pounds, I'll take you on.' \"\n\nOn November 22nd, the Montana Standard of Butte, MT, reported the following: \"If there be anyone who enjoys a punch in the nose, let him get his face low enough and ask Jackie 'Skippy' Cooper about his girl. The waxen-haired youth who created Percy Crosby's screen Skippy and now has the same role with Robert Coogan in 'Sooky,' has no girl, never had one and doesn't want one. His greatest aversion is playing with girls, whom he classifies with a sweep of the hand as 'sissies.' He is never mean to girls but avoids them. He would much rather play with boys four or five years older than himself, even though they rough him.\"\n\nAlso on November 22nd, the Montana Standard of Butte, MT, published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn November 24th, The Detroit Free Press shared the following tidbit: \"Jackie Cooper gave Mitzi Green a narrow band ring of emeralds and diamonds for her eleventh birthday.\"\n\nOn November 25th, the Los Angeles Evening Express published the following tidbit: \"Irene Rich plays Jackie Cooper's mother and Wallace Beery his father in \"The Champ.'

You see, it's so unusual in my type of work. But I got the biggest surprise of my life. Jackie is as seasoned a trouper as an actor with years of experience. I had seen him in 'Skippy,' of course, but had no idea of what he could really do until I saw him work in the emotional scene in the cell, and in the death scene, in this picture. His dramatic sense almost passes belief. When I used to direct, I found out that the child is always a natural actor and that if you can explain the meaning of an emotion to him he can portray it. But here is a youngster who in his brief life could never have experienced the emotions that he had to portray. The way he did it was a constant source of amazement to all of us on the set.\"\n\nOn November 28th, the Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper did his stuff at the Chinese yesterday morning for the Federation of Womens Clubs.\"\n\nAlso on November 28th, the Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"It is understood that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer will buy the six weeks' vacation period of Jackie Cooper which was to be used by the child star in five weeks of personals at $5,550 a week.

The Los Angeles Evening Express of December 1st stated that Jackie would have toured for RKO Theaters for $6,500.

Three stories are ready for young Jackie, 'Limpy,' which has already been announced as his next, to be followed by 'God Gave Me a Son' and 'Big Brother.' I learned Saturday at Metro-Goldwyn that unless Chic Sale could be borrowed from Warner's for 'Limpy' this story would be postponed until Chic would be available. There is a part in the picture made to order for the Sale type of characterization, and no one else seems to be just suited for the role. However, the other stories are both ready, and if 'Limpy' is postponed, 'Big Brother' will be substituted on the December starting date.\" There seems to be some miscommunication in Percy's research, since \"Big Brother\" had already been made as \"Young Donovan's Kid.\"\n\nOn December 1st, The Southwest Wave of Los Angeles published an article on Jackie and co-star Robert Coogan, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn December 4th, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Jackie Cooper, co-star with Wallace Beery in 'The Champ,' which today made its third week at Grauman's Chinese theater, will be the host for more than 2000 boys Saturday morning (the 5th), which has been set aside as 'Annual Y Day in Hollywood.'

Jackie had a terrible crush on Wallace Beery and Red Golden, assistant to King Vidor in 'The Champ.' One day he didn't seem to get into the spirit of the part so King fired Red Golden. Jackie burst into a flood of tears and the scene was photographed. Then to please Jackie and reward him for being a good boy Red was rehired, making a hero of King in the child's eyes. We can forgive King almost anything for giving us that picture.\"\n\nOn December 6th, the Albuquerque Journal published an article about Jackie and co-star Wallace Beery, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn December 7th, the Burbank Daily Review (CA) reported on the Y Day In Hollywood two days previous.

The diminutive star has a complete football outfit now and has written to President Von Kleinsmid of the University to see if he can't arrange to jump right into college without bothering with grade school.\"\n\nOn December 24th, Marion Davies invited 2,500 kids from her clinic in Sawtelle to attend a large Christmas party at MGM, with Santa Claus in attendance. According to Universal Service: \"Santa Claus was dismayed to find a small replica of himself walking about the stage. Jimmy 'Schnozzle' Durante came to Santa's rescue by jerking the whiskers off the diminutive imposter, who was revealed as Jackie Cooper, boy picture star.\"\n\nAlso on December 24th, the Allentown Morning Call published an article about Jackie, which can be accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn December 25th, Christmas Day activities took place at Grauman's Chinese Theater. The matinee portion of the event was emceed by Jackie Cooper. The December 26th Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles published an article with the following tidbit: \"At 2:30 o'clock yesterday little Jackie Cooper rang the gong which officially reopened the Chinese under its original manager.\"\n\nAlso on December 25th, the Venice Evening Vanguard (CA) reported the following: \"Young Jackie Cooper, who spent a number of years in Venice, in spite of his busy screen routine and school hours, at the expiration of seven years, has found time to have his life pretty well mapped out. The tow-headed lad...wants to act, play football, direct, and perhaps write for Paramount, all in turn, to be sure. Of course, he admits, he might change his mind since he recently gave up a long-cherished hope to be a street car conductor, a desire prompted by the fact that this worker wore money containers at his belt and with a jerk of a cord could stop or start the motorman. Jackie wants to act as long as he can, for he thinks it fun. Then while growing up, he is going to college and be quarterback on the football team. Since one can't play football all his life, he will then turn to film directing. 'I've got a two-year-old cousin Roddy Kenmore,' he says. 'And I'm gonna direct him. I'm training him now and he does everything I tell him.' Which, his mother and aunt admit, is sadly correct. 'Then, after I'm old and can't do anything else, I'm gonna write stories,' he confesses. 'I like to write on a typewriter and you ought to read some of my cowboy stories.' \"\n\nAlso on December 25th, the Long Beach Press-Telegram reported the following: \"Here's a ray of physical cheer from the young man who has spread so many mental sunbeams. Husky and seldom quiet tow-headed Jackie Cooper often is pointed to as the ideal healthy American boy. As a matter of fact he and his mother almost died at his birth little more than seven years ago, and for the first two years of his life, Jackie was so sickly that his mother despaired of rearing him. This bit of hope for youngsters who find themselves frequently outdistanced by more rugged playmates was given out by Mrs. Mabel Cooper, mother of the famous kid...\"\n\nAlso on December 25th, The Kansas City Star (MO) published an article on Jackie, which can accessed by clicking here.\n\nOn December 28th, Eileen Percy reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Tommy Meighan tells of this conversation he heard between Jackie Cooper and a young friend: Young Friend: 'Where were you born, Jackie?' Jackie: 'I was born in Los Angeles. Where were you born?' Friend: 'I was born in St. Vincent's Hospital.' Jackie: 'What was the matter - were you sick?' \"\n\nOn December 30th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"A telephone call from Jackie Cooper took me over to his house to see his Christmas toys. He was as thrilled as any youngster his age would be over the gifts. He particularly liked a motion picture projection machine given him by Louis B. Mayer. He ran certain parts of 'The Champ' for me and was delighted with the mechanism of the machine. He liked a sweater given him by his aunt with the U.S.C. emblem on the breast. King Vidor gave him a pair of football pants and these with the helmet and all the regalia delighted his soul. His uncle, Norman Taurog, who directed him in some of his pictures, helped Jackie manipulate his projection machine. He, too, gave him books, sweaters and other gifts. Fred Golden, his idol, was represented with an intricate game.\"\n\nOn December 31st, Mollie Merrick shared the following tidbit in her syndicated column: \"Jackie Cooper wants to learn to ride a horse well enough to become a good polo player.\"\n\nAt some point, probably during this year, Jackie performed at a benefit headlined by Bing Crosby. He sang the Crosby hit \"I Found A Million Dollar Baby (In A Five And Ten Cent Store).\"\n\n103. Helping Grandma (supporting role: Jack)\n\nJan. 3, 1931 - Roach/MGM - 2 reels - prod.

He wasn't able to work at MGM or any other studio during this period. It was brought to an end with a meeting between Jackie, his mother, and L.B. Mayer. Judging by the release dates of his films, it seems that a small portion of late 1932 and a larger portion of early 1933 would easily accommodate this gap in activity.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter of May 10th of this year reported that Jackie had signed a new 2-year contract with MGM, which would result in a maximum of 10 films.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter of June 16th reported that Jackie would play the role of the \"child hoofer\" in MGM's \"The March Of Time,\" which was later released as \"Broadway To Hollywood.\"\n\nAround this time Jackie was set to costar with Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante in the feature film \"Buddies\" for MGM.

Also featuring George \"Spanky\" McFarland.\n\n1936\n\nSometime during 1935 or 1936, Jackie started learning how to play the drums, eventually getting good enough to sit in with many prominent performers of the era.\n\nOn April 14th of this year, Jackie was a guest on Mary Pickford's CBS radio program Parties At Pickfair.\n\nWhile he was unable to attend the 15th anniversary Our Gang reunion on July 18th of this year (due to working in \"The Devil Is A Sissy\"), Jackie did send a wired message that was read aloud during the festivities.\n\nJackie's contract with MGM came to end, which was followed by roughly a year of inactivity.\n\nAround this time, Jackie appeared on the NBC radio program Al Pearce And His Gang.\n\nOn July 14th, the Portland Evening Express (ME) reported the formation that day of the Screen Boys' Club, with Jackie as a charter member. It explains that the idea originated with Jackie, Freddie Bartholomew and Mickey Rooney during the filming of \"The Devil Is A Sissy.\" The club was limited to young actors who had appeared in at least three feature films.\n\nOn August 17th, the Screen Boys' Club met at the home of W.S. Van Dyke to elect its officials, with Jackie being elected their first vice president.\n\nOn September 18th, Movienews of Chicago, IL, published the following article written by Jackie Cooper: \"Next week I'm going hunting for the first time with my Dad. We had been going on a salmon and trout-fishing trip up to the Northwest a couple of weeks ago, but Dad came down with appendicitis and has only just got out of the hospital. So Mom made him spend a week in bed after he got home. He's all right again, but he hadn't been able to sleep much in the hospital. We may still go fishing later on. I've never done any stream or lake fishing before. It's all been out on a barge of Santa Moncia, or off the end of the Ocean Park pier, but I've had pretty good luck there. Mostly sea bass and barracuda. The barracuda really give you a workout.\n\n\"When we were up in Portland and Seattle, on a personal appearance tour last winter, we made a lot of friends who wanted us to come back when the salmon and trout season opened. I'm still hoping we'll get up in the Mt. Rainier country before the summer is over, but right now I'm doing a bunch of electrical transcriptions for broadcasts, so I can't go far from home. When we go hunting next week, it will probably be down by the Mexican border or in the country back of San Diego. Since we live at the beach, I usually get in the ocean every morning before breakfast. I take Champ down on the sand for his morning work-out. He's lived up to his name since I first got him as a pup. He's a German Schnauzer, and last month won two blue ribbons at the Long Beach Dog Show. When he was six months old, he won a ribbon in the puppy class.\n\n\"While I was making 'The Devil Is a Sissy' with Freddie Bartholomew and Mickey Rooney, we all had to be careful about our swimming, so as not to get too much of a tan. Of course, if you get up early enough in the morning and don't stay in too long, you don't get much tan any way. The best time we had in that picture was in the football games. Maybe that's because I get a kick out of sports. Rooney, of course, has his own team that plays all during the Fall season in a midget league. Last year he was quarterback but this year he's going to play center. There were a lot of street football and playground scenes in the picture, so we had Cotton Warburton and Tony Beard and Julie Bescos, who used to star at U. S. C. and Laurie Vejar, who used to be at Notre Dame, giving us pointers. At least I can pass straighter now than I used to, and farther. And Freddie, who was the smallest of us, can do pretty well himself now.\n\n\"Mickey and I went to the night ball games a couple of times while we were making the picture, and all three of us went to Sunday swimming parties up at Mr. Van Dyke's, the director. The day after we finished, we had all the Screen Boys' Club members there. As soon as Dad and I get back from this hunting trip, we're going to have the Screen Boys' Club down at my place at the beach. The members, besides Freddie and Mickey and me, are Bennie Bartlett, David Holt, Spanky McFarland, Buster Slaven, Sherwood Bailey, Billy Lee, Dickie Moore, Jackie Searl, Tommy Bupp and Carl Switzer. I hope I haven't forgotten any names. Then if there's still time later on, as I said, Mom and Dad and I are still going on that fishing trip. We've got to go now, because I bought the tackle.\"\n\nOn November 5th, Jackie appeared on the CBS radio program Then And Now.\n\nTough Guy (lead role: Frederick Martindale \"Freddie\" Vincent III)\n\nJan. 24, 1936 - MGM - 8 reels - feature\n\n©Jan. 24, 1936.
