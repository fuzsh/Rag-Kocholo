Fox Family Channel -- which will conclude the run of its teen reality game

show, Moolah Beach, on Saturdays -- is poised to launch a pair of new

animated daytime series on that day starting next month.

Totally Spies and Da Mob are slated to bow Nov. 3 at 9:30 a.m. and

12:30 p.m., respectively.

Featuring the voice of Jamie Kennedy (Scream, Boiler Room),

Da Mob follows Cornelius 'Rooster' Byron as the leader of an ill-fated

band whose attempts to find hip-hop stardom go awry. The series melds

traditional cell animation with realistic, three-dimensional models as

backgrounds, Fox Family said.

Totally Spies tracks the exploits of Clover, Alex and Sam, three teens

from Beverly Hills who love to shop, talk about boys and save the world as

secret agents employed by WOOHP (World Organization of Human Protection).

Meanwhile, Moolah Beach -- the reality game show that has played well

with teens and tweens -- will end its six-episode original run Oct. 13 at

noon.

The one-hour program -- a half-hour version of which appears on Fox Kids

Network -- began its run Sept. 8 with a half-dozen co-ed teams that were culled

from an open contestant call. The squads competed in various stunts and missions

against a Hawaiian backdrop.

On Oct. 13, the final two-person teams will vie for a $25,000 prize housed

within a Hawaiian idol.

Moolah Beach has performed well for Fox Family in its time slot. The Oct.

6 show scored a 2.4 rating among teens 12 through 17, a 4.4 with girls 12

through 17, a 2.6 among tweens nine through 14 and a 3.8 among girls of that

younger set within Fox Family's universe, according to Nielsen Media

Research.
