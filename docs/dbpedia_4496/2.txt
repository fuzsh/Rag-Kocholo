The San Diego Film Festival has announced Adrien Brody‘s “Septembers of Shiraz” as its opening night film on Sept. 30.

The festival is in its 14th year.

Directed by Wayne Blair, “Septembers of Shiraz” also stars Salma Hayek and Shohreh Aghdashloo. The film is based on the best-selling novel by Dalia Sofer. Set in post-revolutionary Iran, the story centers around a jeweler who is abused and wrongly accused by the Revolutionary Guard for being a spy. It follows his family’s journey after being ripped apart under a harsh and intolerant new regime.

Brody is set to participate in the opening night screening and Q&A that follows. He will also receive the festival’s 2015 Cinema Vanguard Award at “Variety’s Night of the Stars” the following evening.

The festival will also screen “Goosebumps,” based on the R.L. Stine children’s books starring Jack Black; “Mississippi Grind,” starring Ben Mendelsohn, Ryan Reynolds and Sienna Miller; and James Napier Robertson’s “The Dark Horse.”

The five day festival runs Sept. 30 through Oct. 4. Screenings will be held at the Reading Theater in Downtown San Diego’s Gaslamp Quarter and ArcLight Cinemas in La Jolla.
