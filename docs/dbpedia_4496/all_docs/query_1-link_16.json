        "text": "A memorable title will surely attract readers, but when a book becomes a classic, it’s hard to say whether the title has been part of its canonization or has merely become retroactively canonical. Would “Trimalchio in West Egg,” one of Fitzgerald’s initial choices, have in time accrued the same force as “The Great Gatsby”? “The Septembers of Shiraz,” poignant once you’ve read this first novel by Dalia Sofer, is, on its own, a title at once overly poetic and misleading. An American reader might be forgiven for thinking Sofer has written a romance set in the Napa Valley, “Sideways” with Vaseline on the lens. And that would be a great shame because “The Septembers of Shiraz” is a remarkable debut: the richly evocative, powerfully affecting depiction of a prosperous Jewish family in Tehran shortly after the revolution. In this fickle literary world, it’s impossible to predict whether Sofer’s novel will become a classic, but it certainly stands a chance.\n\nTold in the third person, largely in the present tense, the intersecting narratives follow each member of the Amin family over the course of their most difficult year, from September 1981 to September 1982. Isaac, the paterfamilias, is approaching 60. A successful jeweler and gem merchant, he has — to his grave discredit and danger — been patronized by many in the aristocracy, including the wife of the shah. In the opening chapters, he is arrested by two armed Revolutionary Guards, taken from his office at lunchtime on a routine workday: “He looks down at his desk, at the indifferent items witnessing this event — the scattered files, a metal paperweight, a box of Dunhill cigarettes, a crystal ashtray and a cup of tea, freshly brewed, two mint leaves floating inside.”\n\nFrom this beginning, Sofer deftly interweaves Isaac’s experiences with those of the other members of his immediate family: his wife, Farnaz; his 9-year-old daughter, Shirin; and his 18-year-old son, Parviz, who has been sent to New York to study architecture.\n\nThe book’s simple plot is immediately engaging: What will become of Isaac Amin? Will he survive the brutally byzantine, surreal game that his incarceration becomes? Will he die by accident or from illness or torture? What allows one prisoner to survive while his cellmate faces the firing squad? Meanwhile, outside the prison, Farnaz searches for her husband and struggles to maintain their household: Will she find word of him? Will she and her daughter escape the scrutiny of the Revolutionary Guards? How can her life continue — and yet how can it not?\n\nThe Amins’ young daughter is caught between an adult perceptiveness and a child’s belief in magical thinking. “Absence, Shirin thinks, is death’s cousin. One day something is there, the next day it isn’t. Abracadabra.” But “what happens to a house full of nonbeings?” What if she, her mother and the housekeeper should disappear, just like her father? “The house, of course, would not know it. That would be the sad part.”\n\nShirin’s brother, Parviz, strapped for cash in Brooklyn, reduced to working in his Hasidic landlord’s hat shop, has a more practical dismay: “Why is it, he wonders, that no one understands his situation? This is not how his life was supposed to turn out. Only two years ago he was debating between an architecture school in Paris and another in Zurich, and his parents were considering buying him an apartment. ... That he should now be a burden on others both angers and shames him.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
