        "text": "The Book Club was started in 2008 and is still going strong! The friendly group meets every 5-6 weeks in our lower lounge to discuss the book chosen by one of us.\n\n​\n\nWe have read fiction, non-fiction, memoirs, short stories and is there anything else? Discussions are always enjoyable accompanied by snacks and drinks for those interested. It is open to all, even if you'd only like to join for select books.
