        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Chess of the Wind (1976)\n\nLowest Rated: 16% Last Knights (2015)\n\nBirthday: May 11, 1952\n\nBirthplace: Tehran, Iran\n\nThe star of a number of politically controversial feature films in her native Iran during the 1970s, actress Shohreh Aghdashloo had to wait another 20 years before she resumed her career momentum with acclaimed screen performances in American films and television. At the age of 51, she emerged onto the international stage with her Oscar-nominated supporting performance as the wife of a former Iranian military officer reduced to working-class status upon the family's immigration to America in \"House of Sand and Fog\" (2003). From there, the actress was cast in many roles as highly educated, sophisticated professionals on primetime dramas and in films, including \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" (2006). Aghdashloo also maintained a commitment to Iranian social and political issues with productions like \"Maryam\" (2002) and \"The Stoning of Soraya M.\" (2008), which showcased her powerful screen presence and a versatility that helped break down the Western screen's limited notions about Middle-Eastern life and women.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% Chess of the Wind\n\n86% Star Trek Beyond 85% A Simple Wedding\n\n78% Maryam\n\n77% Rosewater\n\n74% The Cuban\n\n74% House of Sand and Fog\n\n66% The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2\n\nPhotos\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, Jennifer Connelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 2003, (c) DreamWorks Bones, Braeden Marcott (L), Shohreh Aghdashloo (C), Tamara Taylor (R), 'The Cold in the Case', Season 9, Ep. #21, 04/14/2014, ©FOX Bones, from left: Braeden Marcott, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Pej Vahdat, Tamara Taylor, 'The Cold in the Case', Season 9, Ep. #21, 04/14/2014, ©FOX Bones, Shohreh Aghdashloo (L), Tamara Taylor (C), Braeden Marcott (R), 'The Cold in the Case', Season 9, Ep. #21, 04/14/2014, ©FOX THE MOB DOCTOR, Jordana Spiro (L), Shohreh Aghdashloo (C), Zeljko Ivanek (R), 'Legacy', Season 1, Ep. #5, 11/05/2012, ©FOX THE MOB DOCTOR, Zeljko Ivanek (L), Shohreh Aghdashloo (R), 'Legacy', Season 1, Ep. #5, 11/05/2012, ©FOX Grimm, Claire Coffee (L), Shohreh Aghdashloo (R), 'The Ungrateful Dead', Season 3, Ep. #1, 10/25/2013, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'The Ungrateful Dead', Season 3, Ep. #1, 10/25/2013, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'Volcanalis', Season 2, Ep. #18, 04/26/2013, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'The Other Side', Season 2, Ep. #8, 10/19/2012, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'Volcanalis', Season 2, Ep. #18, 04/26/2013, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'Volcanalis', Season 2, Ep. #18, 04/26/2013, ©NBC Grimm, Claire Coffee (L), Shohreh Aghdashloo (R), 'The Ungrateful Dead', Season 3, Ep. #1, 10/25/2013, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'The Walking Dead', Season 2, Ep. #21, 05/14/2013, ©NBC Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'Dirty', Season 12, Ep. #14, 01/19/2011, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'The Wild Hunt', Season 3, Ep. #12, 01/24/2014, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo, 'The Wild Hunt', Season 3, Ep. #12, 01/24/2014, ©NBC Grimm, Silas Weir Mitchell (L), Shohreh Aghdashloo (R), 'Eyes Of The Beholder', Season 3, Ep. #10, 01/10/2014, ©NBC Grimm, Shohreh Aghdashloo (L), Claire Coffee (R), 'PTZD', Season 3, Ep. #2, 11/01/2013, ©NBC\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\nCredit No Score Yet 92% Man and Witch: The Dance of a Thousand Steps The Wise Woman (Character) - 2024 56% 60% Damsel Dragon (Voice) - 2024 58% 79% Renfield Unknown (Character) $17.1M 2023 62% 46% Run Sweetheart Run Unknown (Character) - 2020 74% 59% The Cuban Bano Ayoub (Character) - 2019 85% 69% A Simple Wedding Ziba Husseini (Character),\n\nExecutive Producer $54.4K 2018 92% 93% Intent to Destroy Self $13.2K 2017 92% 85% Window Horses Mehrnaz (Voice) $2.1K 2016 51% 92% The Promise Marta Boghosian (Character) $8.0M 2016 86% 80% Star Trek Beyond Commodore Paris (Character) $158.8M 2016 31% 46% Septembers of Shiraz Habibeh (Character) - 2015 16% 47% Last Knights Maria (Character) - 2015 77% 68% Rosewater Moloojoon (Character) $3.1M 2014 42% 54% Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters Oracle (Voice) $68.5M 2013 36% 67% The Odd Life of Timothy Green Adoption Agency Employee (Character) $51.9M 2012 No Score Yet 17% Iranium Narrator - 2011 No Score Yet No Score Yet In NorthWood Dr. Lofton (Character) - 2011 58% 87% The Stoning of Soraya M.
