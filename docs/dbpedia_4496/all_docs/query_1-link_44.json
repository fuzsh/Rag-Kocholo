        "text": "Salma Hayek\n\nHayek spent nearly four years working on an animated adaptation of this 1923 best-seller, a favorite of her grandfather's (who, like Gibran, was Lebanese). \"I read it, and to me, it was like my grandfather was talking to me about life and teaching me about life through this book,\" Hayek told The Hollywood Reporter last year at Cannes, where the film premiered. In addition to producing the film, which GKIDS will release in North America this summer, Hayek surrounded herself with a voice cast that includes Liam Neeson, Quvenzhane Wallis, John Krasinski, Alfred Molina and Frank Langella. She also is an executive producer on Millennium Films' adaptation of Dalia Sofer's 2007 debut novel The Septembers of Shiraz, inspired by the author's own experiences growing up in a Jewish family during the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Hayek stars as the family's mother opposite Shohreh Aghdashloo and Adrien Brody in the thriller, which was filmed last summer and includes Gerard Butler as one of its producers.\n\nJames Franco\n\nAfter directing and starring in back-to-back William Faulkner stories (2013's As I Lay Dying, 2014's The Sound and the Fury), the noted bibliophile recently completed principal photography on his adaptation of this 1936 Steinbeck novel. Franco, who stars alongside Selena Gomez, Vincent D'Onofrio, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris, Bryan Cranston and Danny McBride, also recently played memoirist Stephen Elliott in The Adderall Diaries (which he produced) and has directed and co-written a biopic about author Charles Bukowski that is seeking distribution.\n\nScarlett Johansson\n\nThe actress is making this adaptation of Capote's long-lost first novel her directorial debut. She put together a five-minute promotional reel for buyers at Berlin's European Film Market this winter in advance of a shoot scheduled for New York City later this year. \"Several years ago I began working alongside the Capote estate and writer Tristine Skylar to adapt Summer Crossing, an inspired early work of Truman's which has long captured my heart,\" Johansson said when the project was first announced at Cannes in 2013. \"Being able to bring this story to the screen as my full-length directorial debut is a life dream and deep privilege.\"\n\nBen Affleck\n\nBatman duties have forced Warner Bros. to delay the release of Affleck's second Lehane adaptation from this Christmas to Oct. 7, 2016. The studio picked up the rights to the Prohibition Era novel in spring 2012, back when it was still in galley form. The crime author is a Hollywood favorite — Affleck made his feature directorial debut in 2007 with Lehane's Gone Baby Gone, which he also adapted. This time around, he will again write and direct, as well as appear in front of the camera, and produce alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nFollowing the successful film translations of its first two outings, Gone Girl and Wild, Witherspoon's 3-year-old Pacific Standard continues to mine the print world for female-centric projects to produce. Last month she and Lionsgate announced they had acquired the rights to Knoll's upcoming novel, out May 12, about a New Yorker whose seemingly perfect life unravels when her dark secrets re-emerge. In March, Witherspoon and Fox 2000 partnered to win a rights auction for Gayle Tzemach Lemmon's nonfiction Ashley's War: The Untold Story of a Team of Women Soldiers on the Special Ops Battlefield, which joins a slate of options that include Kimberly McCreight's upcoming YA sci-fi trilogy The Outliers, M.A. Larson's children's series Pennyroyal's Princess Boot Camp (set up at Summit) and Liane Moriarty's Big Little Lies. Witherspoon is set to star in a limited series adaptation of the latter opposite Nicole Kidman, whose Blossom Films also will produce.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nWhat's the status of Warner Bros.' long-awaited big-screen version of Gaiman's celebrated comic series? A year after the project was announced in December 2013 with Gordon-Levitt and David Goyer as producers, Gaiman (who is executive producing) said British scribe Jack Thorne had completed an early draft of the script. Gordon-Levitt has promised an adaptation \"unlike your average big, grand-scale, spectacular movie,\" he told IGN in January 2014. Although the busy actor was initially expected to direct, a DC Entertainment representative says he is currently on board as a star and producer.\n\nLupita Nyong’o\n\nThe 12 Years a Slave Oscar winner will reteam with producer Brad Pitt for Plan B's adaptation of Adichie's 2013 novel, which won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award and the Chicago Tribune's Heartland Prize for Fiction and was named one of The New York Times' 10 best books of that year. The Kenyan actress will produce and star alongside David Oyelowo in the continent-spanning modern love story of a young Nigerian-American couple.\n\nEdward Norton\n\nNorton has been trying to bring Lethem's detective novel to life since it was published in 1999, when the actor first set up the project at New Line. In 2006, he reported that he was 80 pages in to adapting the contemporary story into one set in the 1950s. Hope was renewed in February 2014 when Brett Ratner's RatPac Entertainment came on board to finance, but as a planned late 2014 production start came and went, it looks like it'll be a while longer before the Birdman star (and Keeping the Faith director) helms his sophomore feature.\n\nAnne Hathaway\n\nThe actress is further wading into producing (she also produced last year's Sundance drama Song One) with an adaptation of this 2012 novel about a young widow on trial for murder in 1914. Working Title and Focus Features jointly acquired the rights in June 2013 and attached Hathaway to produce and star. Apollo 13's William Broyles Jr. currently is penning the script.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nHollywood's most in-demand actress is attached to not one but two memoir adaptations, either of which would represent the \"It\" girl's debut as a producer. Lionsgate and Summit picked up the rights to Walls' memoir about her West Virginia upbringing three years ago, and the journalist told The Hollywood Reporter in June 2013 that Marti Noxon was working on a screenplay with Life of Pi's Gil Netter producing. Also in June 2013, FilmNation announced it was financing an adaptation of Smith's tale of her young adulthood. Lawrence would reunite with Serena director Susanne Bier and Silver Linings Playbook producer Bruce Cohen on the project. Progress on either film will likely depend on Lawrence's packed schedule, since she would be starring as the plucky female memoirist in both."
