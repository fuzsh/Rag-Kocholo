        "text": "The lack of emotion and depth makes for a movie that is hard to sit through, and all because it decides to tell and not show.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Aug 22, 2018\n\nThere might be some way to depict the Iranian Revolution on film, but Septembers of Shiraz is not it.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Jan 9, 2017\n\nThough the film has failed to make any impression, it is an effectively mounted portrait of how regime change can help mask the agendas of the lawless. That two highly-regarded indigenous filmmakers would dare take on such a risky project deserves kudos.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 26, 2016\n\nAnother vacuous melodrama/thriller that doesn't lay a glove on the era's historical complexities.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 0.5/4 | Jun 24, 2016\n\n...captures what it must be like to have your life suddenly turned around into total chaos, the hopelessness, the helplessness, and the despair that descends when thrown into a dungeon where people all around you are being executed on a daily basis.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | Jun 23, 2016\n\nThis lifeless, by-the-numbers production is an excruciating exercise in cliche and tedium. Its sole joy is in trying to figure out which of its leads is overacting most.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Sep 18, 2015"
