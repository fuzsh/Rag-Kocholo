I was wondering if you gentlemen could kindly point me in the right direction. I'm looking for a list of all super-hero books put out by this publisher (is it one or two?) and any background information about the company itself. It appears it was a major player during the Golden Age but petered out around 1949-1950.

Just for reference, I've been looking at America's Best Comics, Black Terror, Fighting Yank and Starling Comics war covers in 4.0 or higher grades. But it seems like I'm missing a title stable of the publishers somewhere.

Whet, Thrilling and Wonder are the big titles missing from your list.

From Wikipedia:

Nedor Comics was the comic book line of publisher Ned Pines, who also published pulp magazines under a variety of company names that he also used for the comics. In business from 1939 to 1956, Nedor was a prolific publisher during the Golden Age of comic books. Its best-known character is the Black Terror. In June of 1949, all comics were moved to the "Standard Comics" line, with a "Standard Comics" flag-like cover logo (all titles previously had no publisher logo, which was the norm at the time). In 1956, Standard ended and only two were continued by Pines Comics. What connection this new company had with Ned Pines and his company is unclear.
