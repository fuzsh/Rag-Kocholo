        "text": "Wishing a very happy birthday to comic book & animation artist Will Meugniot, who was born on July 24, 1951.\n\nMeugniot has been working professionally since the early 1970s. One of his earliest assignments was penciling the Tigra feature in Marvel Chillers written by Tony Isabella. Although Meugniot only ever drew Tigra twice, in Marvel Chillers #3 (cover-dated Feb 1976) and #5 (June 1976) he is one of the artists most associated with the character, by virtue of the fact that he was one of the earliest artists to work on her and that he rendered an incredibly striking depiction of Greer Grant Nelson’s feline alter ego, influencing pretty much everyone else who has ever drawn her for Marvel Comics.\n\nMeugniot’s work on Tigra in Marvel Chillers established right off the bat his affinity for rendering beautiful, sexy women. I definitely regard him as one of the best “good girl” artists to have worked in comic books within the last half-century.\n\nBeginning in 1983 Meugniot collaborated with writer Mark Evanier on their creator-owned series The DNAgents, published by Eclipse Comics. The DNAgents were the genetically-engineered creations of the amoral multinational corporation Matrix, Inc. The series chronicled the five superpowered teenage DNAgents’ attempts to establish normal lives for themselves and escape from under the thumb of Matrix’s ultra-manipulative CEO Lucius Krell.\n\nMeugniot penciled the first 14 issues of The DNAgents, and on most of them he was paired up with inker Al Gordon. Meugniot & Gordon did some quality work on the series, depicting both dynamic action sequences and more subtle, character-driven scenes. Meugniot’s wife Jo was the regular colorist on the series.\n\nSince I didn’t start following comic books regularly until the late 1980s, I unfortunately missed the original run of The DNAgents. Fortunately in 2008 Image Comics released The DNAgents Industrial Strength Edition trade paperback, which collected those first 14 issues, with Meugniot providing retouched artwork for much of the book. Evanier and Meugniot both contributed behind-the-scenes material to the collection.\n\nRegrettably, the Industrial Strength Edition was published in black & white. I hope that one of these days Evanier & Meugniot will be able to re-issue it in a color edition that restores Jo Meugniot’s coloring, as well as publishing additional volumes to collect the remainder of the series, which ran for 24 issues, as well as the follow-up The New DNAgents which ran for an additional 17 issues, all of which were written by Evanier.\n\nAn unfortunate fact of the comic book industry that I’ve touched upon in the past is that it is often very difficult to make a living in it. As a result, even though Meugniot did some spectacular work in comics, for most of his career he’s worked in animation as a storyboard artist and director.\n\nAs he explained in a 2011 interview with Comic Mix:\n\n“The shift [from comics to animation] was an economic necessity for me at the time, and was achieved by dumb luck. It started when Mark Evanier ran into Don Jurwich, producer of the Super-Friends cartoons. Don knew Mark had done comics and mentioned that Hanna Barbera was looking for artists with comics experience to help on the new action shows they’d sold for the 1978 TV season. Mark suggested I cold call HB and ask about it, so I did.”\n\nAmong the numerous animated series Meugniot has worked on are Super Friends (1979), Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981-1983), G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985), Jem (1986-1988), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987), C.O.P.S. (1988-1989), The Real Ghostbusters (1990), Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1991-1992), X-Men: The Animated Series (1992-1993) and Silver Surfer (1998), just to name a few!\n\n(All of the above dates courtesy of IMDb, so take ‘em with a grain of salt!)\n\nThe first work I ever saw by Meugniot would have been on those various animated series. There’s often a significant overlap between the comic books and animation industries. Even though the credits on cartoons always flashed by much too quickly, I used to watch them anyway to see if I could spot the names of creators whose work I knew from Marvel and DC. So, I’m sure that was how I came to know Meugniot’s name.\n\nAlthough his primary focus has been animation, Meugniot has fortunately been able to do the occasional comic book work during the last three decades, both for independent publishers and on his own creator-owned projects.\n\nIn the early 1990s Meugniot drew several covers for Femforce for AC Comics writer & editor Bill Black. That was definitely an assignment Meugniot was well-suited for, given his aforementioned aptitude at depicting lovely ladies. Meugniot subsequently did several more covers for AC Comics in 2003, and again between 2011 and 2015, as well as drawing the main story “The Lady Who Said She Could Fly” in Femforce #156 (July 2011). More recently, he’s drawn several pulp sci-fi inspired covers for Antarctic Press.\n\nMeugniot’s series N.E.D.O.R. Agents, featuring new female characters based on heroes such as Fighting Yank, Pyro-Man and Captain Future who had been published by Standard Comics aka Nedor Publishing (hence the series name) between 1939 and 1956. Meugniot extrapolated what could have happened to the various Nedor Comics heroes if their careers had continued uninterrupted into the 1960s and their children began following in their footsteps.\n\nThe N.E.D.O.R. Agents aka the New Earth Defense Organization reserve (and congrats to Meugniot with coming up with a cool acronym to fit the Nedor name) made their debut as a four-part back-up serial that appeared in Femforce #156-159 in 2011 and 2012. The entire story was later collected together by Meugniot in one volume. It’s clearly a project Meugniot enjoyed working on, and hopefully he’ll be able to return to it at some point.\n\nAnother creator-owned project was Adventures of Cat Passmore, Sub: Human, a color one-shot published in 2021. Cat Passmore is a sexy red-headed substitute teacher who finds herself instructing a motley group of extraterrestrial teenagers whose space school bus crash-lands on Earth. It’s a really fun story with cute artwork and vibrant coloring. Again, I hope it’s a series Meugniot is able to do more with in the future.\n\nBoth books were released under the Mineo Entertainment imprint, Mineo being the pronunciation of the name Meugniot.\n\nI’ve been friends with Meugniot for several years on Facebook, and it’s been pleasant to interact with him. I was finally able to meet him last year when he was a guest at New York Con. He came across as a good person. It’s always great when you get to meet creators whose work you enjoy and it turns out they’re also decent people."
