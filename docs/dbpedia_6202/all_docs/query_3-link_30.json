        "text": "Writer and artist Matt Kindt (of BRZRKR (with Keanu Reeves), Apache Delivery Service, BANG! Dept. H, Ether, Fear Case, MIND MGMT, Folklords, Revolver, 3 Story, Super Spy, and Pistolwhip fame) will launch his very own imprint called Flux House in conjunction with Dark Horse Comics this July.\n\nFlux House will be the new home for all of Kindt’s creator-owned comics in a variety of genres (crime, science fiction, and humor) and in a number of different formats, from traditional comics, to magazines, to those that include special print features (such as die-cut and fur) and a punch-card dust jacket that reveals a secret message, each one personally designed by Kindt.\n\nFlux House’s imprint will grace the cover of July’s Mind MGMT: Bootleg mini-series by Kindt and artists Farel Dalrymple, Jill Thompson, David Rubín, and Matt Lesniewski. The latest series continues in the same vein as previous MGMT series, replete with espionage and psychic operatives, but will also mark the first time the series has been illustrated by an artist other than Kindt. Bootleg will also include variant covers by Jim Rugg, Marguerite Sauvage, Aron Wiesenfeld, and Laura Perez, and a retro polybagged variant that comes with a subversive, collectible playing card.\n\nKindt says that “Flux House is inspired by Fluxus – an avant-garde art movement from the 1950s that was an extension of Surrealists and Dadaists. The Fluxus movement focused on the creative process and experimental art forms. Their trademarks include accessibility, absurdism, and a sense of humor. If you’ve seen me burn or cut one of my books apart at a signing, you already have a sense of where I’m going with this. Flux House aims to embody all of these elements. It won’t be limited by traditional forms of books and print. And the story format will, as the name implies, always be in flux.”\n\nDark Horse Comics President and Founder Mike Richardson called Kindt “a smart and innovative artist, who wants to push at the limitations of the comics medium” and “…didn’t hesitate to say yes” when Kindt brought the idea of an new imprint to him.\n\nDark Horse Comics Senior Editor Daniel Chabon also praised Kindt’s new venture, saying that “Whether you’ve been following Kindt’s career or are new to his storytelling, Flux House will deliver compulsively readable stories full of adventure and intrigue, with some very, very strange twists.”\n\nLook for the first Flux House title, the Mind MGMT: Bootleg four issue mini-series, this July and check out the standard cover and variant cover by Dan Brereton for issue one below."
