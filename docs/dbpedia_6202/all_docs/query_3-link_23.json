For the imprint’s first graphic novel — “Darkstorm” — it’s written by seasoned screenwriter and comic book writer Kevin Grevioux, who’s most known for the “Underworld” film franchise.\n\n“If you know anything about me, then you know how much I love comics. I’m the guy who got Wolverine holding a microphone tattooed on his arm when he was 17 because of my love of comics. Partnering with Kevin Grevioux to present this new universe, filled with Black and Brown GOD Level superheroes is a dream come true. A lot of the black superheroes I loved growing up were street level and that’s cool but I want to see Omega Level superheroes that look like me and people around me and that’s exactly what we are giving you with Darkstorm and The Vindicators,” said Charlamagne, according to the press release.\n\nHe continued, “I am blessed and excited to continue the important work with my Black Privilege imprint on Simon & Schuster, and begin partnerships with comic book veterans like Bill Jemas, Axel Alonso and the whole team at AWA Studios. It’s collaborations like this that help to build an empire and I’m grateful to have found good ones.”\n\nThrough Charlamagne and Grevioux’s new partnership, their first released project aims to be just the beginning of the “Signature Superhero Epic Series.”\n\n“I feel blessed to be working with a guy that is as successful as Charlamagne, a one-of-a-kind cultural icon with global reach,” Grevioux said. “He also has an incredible genre IQ for science fiction, comics, and fantasy. So, I truly believe that he is the absolute perfect partner for these ventures. The world’s really not ready for what we have in store.”"
