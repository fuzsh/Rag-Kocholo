Bastei Lübbe AG (ISIN DE000A1X3YY0), which is listed in the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is acquiring the fiction imprint LYX from EGMONT Publishing International. With this specialist publisher for romantic fiction, Bastei Lübbe is rounding out its offering with another successful brand. \"After the recent investment in Buchpartner, with LYX we are again committed to the classic book business.

We set great store in maintaining continuity and transferring the strengths of the relevant fiction imprints to a new editorial home\", explains Firmig.\n\nAbout Bastei Lübbe AG:\n\nBastei Lübbe AG is an international media group based in Cologne.
