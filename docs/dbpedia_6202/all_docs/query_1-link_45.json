        "text": "THE LIBRARYPASS TEAM\n\nIan Singer—Chief Executive Officer\n\nFor over two decades Ian has been committed to innovation in the field of information services and has held leadership positions at some of the library industry’s most well-respected companies. Ian has served as an advisor to Capira Technologies since 2018 and most recently served as Credo Reference’s General Manager, leading the sale of Credo to Infobase Holding in Nov. 2018.\n\nBefore joining Credo, he served as Vice President, Group Publishing for Media Source, Inc., where he was responsible for strategic planning and day-to-day operations of such prestigious publications as Library Journal, School Library Journal, and The Horn Book. Prior to Media Source Inc., he held positions at Bowker LLC and Joint Information Inc; in 1996 he co-founded eComp, a web-based executive compensation database covering all US public companies, which was sold to Aon Consulting in 2002. Ian holds a law degree from New York Law School, and a B.A. in History from George Washington University.\n\nTony Hobdy—Chief Operating Officer\n\nOver the past 20+ years, Tony has focused his time and talents on software development, information architecture, and creative IP development. Using his knowledge and background of digital content delivery, data security, and mass automation, Tony provides technical oversight and infrastructure development as a founder and CTO of LibraryPass. His previous experience includes 3+ years as CTO of Fluent Concepts, a media language translation company, and 8+ years as COO of iVerse Media where he developed the content delivery engine and DRM technology.\n\nBefore joining iVerse, Tony ran a comic book company as CEO of Outlaw Ent., worked on creative IP, film, and animation projects for Coca-Cola, NASCAR, Southwest Airlines, Xbox, and Sega. He has a background in electrical engineering from the University of Texas.\n\nGuy LeCharles Gonzalez—Chief Content Officer\n\nGuy is a media and marketing veteran with extensive B2B and consumer experience in audience development, content strategy, event programming, and market research. Previously, he was the project lead for The Panorama Project; publisher & marketing director for Writer’s Digest; director, content strategy & audience development for Library Journal & School Library Journal; and founding director of programming & business development for the original Digital Book World.\n\nYears ago, he was also executive editor for PopCultureShock / Buzzscope—a website and online community serving diverse comics and gaming fans before that became a hollow marketing buzzword. He’s been an avid comics reader from childhood, a recent manga convert, and active gamer. He has a quote from Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Between the World and Me tattooed on his right forearm: “I was made for library, not the classroom.”\n\nRaquel Ryan, MSEd—Chief Experience Officer\n\nRaquel is passionate about working with at-risk students, working for several years as a child advocate for underrepresented and neglected children, volunteering on service and giving committees, and in her community as a Guardian ad Litem. She’s taught 11th grade reluctant readers, advocating for their needs through reading and literacy programs, and led the initiative for retention of high-risk students at Keiser University where she created a resource center and built partnerships with services in the community. She also conducted market research and analyzed market trends for potential and existing programs, while improving processes and procedures for the student experience.\n\nRaquel’s experience in and out of the classroom gives her a unique perspective on the importance of ensuring equitable access to educational materials and curriculum-aligned instruction, and her ultimate goal is to help librarians and educators ignite a newfound love for reading through the use of comic books, graphic novels, and manga. She has her Graduate degree in Education from Nova Southeastern University and her Undergraduate from Florida State University. (Go Noles!)\n\nJason Sockel—Chief Revenue Officer\n\nJason is an experienced, award-winning sales leader, including recognitions as Sales Director of the Year with Pluralsight and OverDrive. He has built new customer acquisition and account management teams, with specialization in industry segmentation, customer retention, and revenue growth. He served six-and-a-half years with OverDrive, where he achieved aggressive growth targets totaling over $200 million in annual revenue.\n\nHe’s also a fan of all things positivity, an avid distance runner, and proud of his reputation as a trouble-making dad and husband.\n\nMichael Berse—VP, Product Development\n\nMichael Berse is a seasoned technology manager and entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in the library sector. Michael began his career working in public libraries in a variety of roles for over a decade. In 2013, he founded Capira Technologies, a company dedicated to providing innovative mobile application and SaaS solutions for libraries, introducing the flagship CapiraMobile app and various other solutions, including “Text to Checkout” and Curbside Reservation cloud platforms, significantly enhancing library services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Capira Technologies was later acquired by OCLC, Inc. in 2020.\n\nMichael’s expertise in library technology, product development and innovation helps libraries and schools expand their digital offerings and improve patron engagement.\n\nJoshua Oiknine—Vice President, Technology\n\nFor almost three decades Joshua has been obsessed with software development and everything tech. Born in Los Angeles CA Joshua was encouraged by his father at a young age to deconstruct and reconstruct anything technical he could get his hands on. With the explosion of the internet Joshua transitioned into building websites with friends as he earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science from CSUN (California State University Northridge). Joshua’s vast experience spans from working with small startups to leading a tech department at a publicly traded company.\n\nPrior to joining LibraryPass Joshua served as lead developer for iVerse Media where he modernized the company’s software and grew the tech team. Before that Joshua worked as Director of Technology for Wireless Xcessories Group, a publicly traded company, where he was responsible for implementing the company’s integration with a multi-million dollar ERP software package and designed and developed an AI system to help the vendor manage inventory of its customers to maximize profits and minimize losses.\n\nMoni Barrette, MLIS—Director, Collection Development\n\nMoni is a former President of American Library Association’s Graphic Novel & Comics Round Table, and co-founder of the nonprofit Creators, Assemble! Inc. which is dedicated to promoting literacy through the use of comics in classrooms and libraries and guiding career pathways for aspiring creators. As a former public library manager, Moni won the California Library Association PRExcellence Award (2018 & 2019) for library events aimed at underserved adult library users, and has proven success using comics to increase library circulation. She is a frequent panelist at San Diego and New York Comic Con, San Diego Comic Fest and Wonder-Con, hosting industry networking events and providing instruction to educators and librarians.\n\nMoni’s expertise in libraries, comics, and relationship building helps classrooms and libraries maximize access to educational comics and graphic novel content, while helping publishers reach and engage new audiences.\n\nRob Randle—Director, Production\n\nFor over two decades Rob has worked in and around the comic book industry in various capacities, including as a book reviewer for the NY Journal of Books, and a judge for various comic book industry awards—the 2006 Eisner Awards, among others. Before joining LibraryPass, he had been the Director of Publishing for iVerse Media LLC since 2010, and prior to that was a purchasing manager for Diamond Comic Distributors where he helped to manage the monthly Previews catalog for close to a decade starting in 2002."
