        "text": "Vault Comics will team with several musicians for a new line of graphic novels called Headshell. Songwriter and producer Richard Rudolph, who has worked with everyone from Stevie Wonder to 2Pac, will “guide strategy and artist relations” for the new imprint.\n\nAccording to the press release, Headshell will launch with Dying Inside from Fall Out Boy co-founder Pete Wentz, co-writer Hannah Klein and Witchblood artist Lisa Sterle. Alternative Press has a first look at the artwork.\n\n“Creating a new graphic novel with Vault and one of my favorite writers, Hannah Klein, has been an insane experience–in the best possible way,” Wentz said. “Between her perspective, honesty, and super dark sense of humor and Vault’s creative support throughout the entire process, I’m excited to share it with the world soon.”\n\nOther artists working with Headshell include Def Leppard, Metallica, the Beach Boys and Redman. No release dates were mentioned, but they have set up a page for Headshell on the Vault Comics website. They also mention releasing projects as “standard, deluxe and collectors editions, including special one-of-one rarities,” which seems to mirror the approach of Z2 Comics to provide collectible items for music fans.\n\n“We have one overriding goal at Vault: to bring readers the very best comics and graphic novels. We’re thrilled to bring that experience creating amazing, award-winning stories to Headshell in partnership with some of the biggest names in music,” said Vault CEO Damian Wassel. “I can’t wait to share the Headshell line of books with the world.”"
