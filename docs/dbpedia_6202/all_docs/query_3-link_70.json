        "text": "This article examines authorial performance in the context of DC's Vertigo line. In the 1990s, Vertigo gained its reputation as an innovative and progressive imprint by promoting the work of British scriptwriters, who were hailed as true author figures, despite the inherently collaborative nature of the mainstream comics industry. In a manner reminiscent of \" auteur theory \" , writers such as Neil Gaiman, Warren Ellis or Grant Morrison developed attractive authorial personae which they consistently displayed through interviews, letter columns or social media, but also, more importantly, by inserting their avatars within the comics they scripted. Upon closer examination, however, it becomes clear that their work in fact simultaneously asserts and destabilizes writerly authority, in a manner that is consistent with Linda Hutcheon's view of postmodernity. By multiplying author figures and playfully disseminating authority, Vertigo authors question their own authorial control over the text, asserting instead the crucial role played by the reader.\n\nThe turn towards the medium’s past in contemporary comics and graphic novel production has been critically assessed as an instance of a broader ‘nostalgia’ or ‘retro culture’ (Baetens/Frey 2015). In this view, phenomena like facsimile reprints, stylistic references or narratives focussing on obscure or lost works are all symptomatic of a nostalgic longing – which provides us with a commodified, selective view of the past, and thus defies a ‘true’ sense for the history of comics. Such critiques resonate with oft-cited accounts of postmodern nostalgia and its alleged lack of ‘genuine historicity’, i.e., failure to identify the actual agents of historical change (Jameson 1991). However, nostalgia itself is not devoid of agency; its relevance to restorative agendas trying to reinstate an ideal lost home or past has repeatedly been discussed (Davis 1979; Hutcheon 2000). The perils of these politics, Svetlana Boym argues, can only be avoided once nostalgia is relegated to a ‘reflective’ role and acknowledges that what it longs for must remain perpetually irretrievable (Boym 2006). Critically reviewing these notions, this paper will show how nostalgia is involved in transformations of comics’ mediality: I will argue that the changing status of comics as a medium is affected by the past in ways that can neither be confined to identical repetition nor perpetual reflection. Using Lewis Trondheim and Nicolas Keramidas’s Mickey’s Craziest Adventures as an example, I will show how nostalgia as an emotional orientation towards the past (Ahmed 2004) informs how artists and readers, but also non-human actors, are defined by their respective agency to shape the medium of comics in the present. First published in 2016, Mickey’s Craziest Adventures poses as a reissue of a long-lost series from the late 1960s, using aspects like paper quality, printing technology, traces of usage and lost issues to assemble the characteristics of comics from a bygone era. This further relates to a renegotiation of authorship and ownership – of comics as well as their characters – and the elements that are mobilised to assert them. References Ahmed, S. 2004.

Over the years, his stories have evolved from being deconstructions of the superhero archetype to magical explorations of the medium itself and recently with mainstream superhero fiction. Starting with Seven Soldiers of Victory in 2005 and Final Crisis in 2008, Morrison began applying mystical concepts related to the boundaries between fiction and reality, first explored in his creator-owned series The Invisibles, to the mainstream DC Comics universe. The resultant stories are closer in nature to Jorge Luis Borges' Garden of Forking Paths than typical superhero stories. The intent behind this method of storytelling is to engage the reader on a level that does not normally occur within popular superhero fiction. Both Seven Soldiers of Victory and Final Crisis share distinct similarities with what Espen Aarseth calls Ergodic Literature. Morrison's intent is for the reader to connect with the characters in the book and to navigate the fictional world contained within the panels in a manner similar to the concept of Psychogeography. Through this immersion into and navigation through a fictional world, Morrison is attempting to provide for his readers a kind of shamanic experience, accomplished largely because of the strong connections between the reader and text that the ergodic provides.\n\nThe comic-book genre has gone through several important changes along the twentieth century in the Anglo-Saxon world. This verbal-iconical genre seems to have been able to overcome the Manichean vision of the comic-book as something childish, and thus find a new space for the maturation of its own devices. As the latest outgrowth of the comic-book expansion, the graphic novel has become the corner stone whereby a link is established between the pure narrative form of the novel and the visual quality of the verbal-iconical genres. The daring and yet successful combination of these different trends has contributed to elevating the graphic novel to the status of proper art form. Hence, the aim of this essay is to offer a modest and serious proposal for the analysis of the four verbal-iconical genres directly related to the comic-book, to wit: the illustrated novel, the comic strip, the comic-book, and, finally, the graphic novel. The latter has given a new breath to the narrative forms of the verbal-iconical genres, especially to the comic-book, allowing for an experimentalism inside this trend, producing a new independent hybrid genre, and making possible a reorientation of narrative techniques concerning the time factor –chronotope– in the comic-book genre towards a more complex and coherent structure."
