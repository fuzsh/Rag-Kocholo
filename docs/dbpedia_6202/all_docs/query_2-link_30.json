        "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - We have a list of family-friendly events this weekend happening across Calcasieu Parish.\n\nFor a complete list of area events, you can visit www.visitlakecharles.org.\n\nYou can also submit an event to Visit Lake Charles HERE.\n\nALMOSTA RANCH FARMERS MARKET\n\nPRICE: Free\n\nWHO: Almosta Ranch LLC\n\nWHEN: August 10, 2024; 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM\n\nWHERE: Almosta Ranch, 5290 Choupique Rd, Sulphur, LA 70665\n\nWHAT: Farmer’s Market 2nd Saturday of every month except December.

This exhibition will include works not only by Gallery artists, but also pieces contributed by friends and family of some of the artists.\n\nStipelcovich’s works will include pieces she completed in high school, salvaged after Hurricane Katrina destroyed her home in Plaquemines Parish. She decided to also include several more recent creations from loved ones, saying, “I struggled with creativity in the time leading up to the show but realized I was surrounded by talented people who support me personally and could provide artistic support as well. I wanted to share this space and time with them to honor those bonds. That then led to new works that symbolize the connection and community that help us find a home, wherever life takes us.”\n\nStipelcovich’s art journey takes many forms, including pencil drawings, acrylic paintings, paper quilling, and cyanotypes. Her view of trying any and all forms of artistic mediums is a reflection of the eclectic life path that brought her to where she is today. After graduation from law school and admission to the Louisiana Bar, which took place the year of Hurricane Katrina, she changed course and began a career in the casino industry. Another shift occurred in 2020, when she left full-time work to focus more on art. Coincidentally, this was two weeks before Hurricane Laura hit.\n\n“Displaying these works feels like coming full circle and a sort of closure - perhaps completing another round on the spiral of life,” says Stipelcovich.\n\nOther Gallery by the Lake members will contribute art to the exhibition through their own interpretations of the “Finding Home” theme. Some of the artworks will be priced for sale but are required to remain on display for the duration of the exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition will remain on view Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 AM to 6 PM until October 5, 2024.
