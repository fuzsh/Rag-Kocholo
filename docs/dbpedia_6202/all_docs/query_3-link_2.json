        "text": "DC Comics has published a number of other imprints and lines of comics over the years.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Golden Age of Comic Books publishing, DC Comics was also an imprint of Detective Comics and its affiliated companies, All-American Publications and National Allied Publications, that were later all merged into National Periodical Publications, later renamed DC Comics.[1] Before the merger, due to squabbles between the companies, All-American published under its own name/imprint in 1945 starting with the February stand date until the December stand date.[dct 1]\n\nIn 1987, DC started Piranha Press as a mature readers line.[dci 1] The Elseworlds concept was tested in 1989 with Gotham by Gaslight: An Alternate History of the Batman and became an imprint with 1991's Batman: Holy Terror.[dct 2] Using the licensed Red Circle characters, DC launched the Impact Comics imprint in 1991 as an introductory and new talent imprint.[dci 2]\n\nIn January 1993, DC's Vertigo imprint was launched with some former DC Comics imprint titles.[2] DC teamed up with Milestone Media to co-publish Milestone Comics starting in 1993.[dci 3] Impact Comics last saw print in July.[dct 2]\n\nPiranha was shut down in 1994 to be replaced by Paradox Press[dci 1] with Milestone Comics following in 1996.[dci 3] In July, the Helix science fiction imprint was launched.[3][4] In December 1997, the Tangent Comics imprint was published on skip week, then on skip week of September 1998.[dct 3] In August 1998, DC purchased Wildstorm Productions, including imprints Cliffhanger, Homage and ABC.[dct 3] 1998 also saw the end of the Helix imprint as its top title was moved to Vertigo, where reprints of the Helix titles also were printed under.[dci 4]\n\nIn 2001, DC shut down Paradox Press.[dci 1] DC launched a manga imprint, CMX[dci 5] and DC Focus in 2004, but Focus was soon shut down in 2005.[dci 6] Johnny DC was launched in September 2004 with DC Comics' Looney Tunes- and Cartoon Network-based comic books. In November 2006, All-Star DC was launched with All-Star Superman.[dct 4] In May 2007, DC launched a line for young women called Minx.[5] Also that year, DC entered the webcomic market with Zuda Comics.[dci 7]\n\nAfter seeing Tangent characters in the regular DC Universe in Infinite Crisis in 2006, in Ion #9–10 in 2007 and then in Countdown to Final Crisis, the Tangent imprint was revived on March 18, 2008, for a 12-issue maxiseries.[6] The Red Circle line began print in 2008 as DC's second attempt with the Red Circle characters, this time as part of the DC Universe.[7] The Milestone characters were also licensed in 2008 to be included in the DC Universe.[dci 3] With no placement in major bookstores in the young adult section, Minx was canceled in September 2008.[8] With some licensed pulp characters mixed with pulp-like DC characters, DC launched the First Wave line in 2009.[9]\n\nOn July 1, 2010, DC shutdown its CMX imprint and moved Megatokyo to the DC imprint.[10] Then on September 27, as part of DC Entertainment's reorganization, DC announced the end of the Wildstorm and Zuda imprints with Bob Harris named Editor-in-Chief for all remaining imprints: DC, Mad and Vertigo.[dct 4] With the New 52 reboot in September 2011, the Wildstorm characters were adapted into the DC Universe within the \"Edge\" line, which also featured the Western and war comics.[11] The Earth One graphic novel imprint was launched in November 2010.[12] By the end of 2011, the First Wave line was discontinued.[13]\n\nIn a May 2017 editorial leadership reorganization, three Executive Editors split up DC Comics and its imprints. Pat McCallum took the DC superhero titles and Mark Doyle the two mature imprints, Vertigo and Young Animal. Executive Editor Bobbie Chase was given custom comics, DC Kids, Digital First titles, Hanna-Barbera comics, Milestone and the relaunched Wildstorm Universe, plus the young reader imprint expected in 2018.[14]\n\nIn early March 2018, DC Comics announced a number of new imprints and lines. Imprints included DC Black Label, youth-oriented DC Inks and DC Zoom and Brian Michael Bendis' unnamed imprint, while DC imprint Vertigo was announced to be launching a Sandman Universe line.[15]\n\nDC Comics discontinued all imprints as of January 2020 while implementing a new age-specific identification of DC Kids (ages 8–12), DC (ages 13 and older) and DC Black Label (ages 17 and above and a reuse of the former label name). This does not apply to the pop-up imprints like Young Animal and The Wild Storm.[16]\n\nImprints\n\n[edit]\n\nAll Star\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section is about the 2006 DC Comics imprint. For the 1940s comic book series, see All Star Comics.\n\nAll Star, or All Star DC, was a DC imprint that allowed big name creators to make \"out-of-continuity\" stories of DC major characters. All Star was DC's answer to Marvel's Ultimate imprint.[dci 8] The original purposes of the line was to have stories featuring the characters in their \"most identifiable versions as seen by the world outside of comics\", but based on the creators recruited, the purpose shifted to the creators' vision.[17]\n\nOnly two out of the four planned miniseries made it to print. All-Star Superman was considered a landmark series for the Superman character and the creators. The other title, All Star Batman & Robin, the Boy Wonder, was never finished (the last two issues remain unpublished to this day), but created a lot of discussions. The title is expected to get new branding as Dark Knight, if and when it resumes.[dci 8] Due to scheduling issues of the creative team, the status of writer Geoff Johns and artist J.G. Jones' All Star Batgirl by November 2008 was on indefinite hold. Adam Hughes was working on the All Star Wonder Woman book with some pages completed by November 2008.[17]\n\nIn November 2006, All Star DC was launched with All-Star Superman and ran 12 issues.[dct 4]\n\nA direct-to-video animated film was made based on All-Star Superman by Warner Home Video and released on February 22, 2011.[18]\n\nAmalgam Comics\n\n[edit]\n\nAmalgam Comics was a joint imprint from Marvel Comics and DC Comics that published amalgamated characters such as the Dark Claw, Iron Lantern, Spider-Boy, and Lobo the Duck.

Doc Savage's back-up was Justice Inc., starring The Avenger,[43] while The Spirit had additional Spirit black-and-white short tales by various creators.[46]\n\nBy February 2011, DC planned to cancel the line;[47] however, the Doc Savage and The Spirit titles were solicited as late as August 2011.[13] DC listed a First Wave collection for a May 2012 release.[48] Licenses for the non-DC characters the Spirit, Doc Savage and the Avenger ended prior to December 17, 2012.[49]\n\nHanna-Barbera Beyond\n\n[edit]\n\nDan DiDio and Jim Lee began a new partnership between Hanna-Barbera and DC Comics in January 2016, both companies owned by Time Warner, in order to remake most of the studio's comedic characters and adapt them into darker and edgier settings.\n\nThe first four titles in the line were Future Quest, Scooby Apocalypse, The Flintstones and Wacky Raceland. New titles were released in March 2017.\n\nRed Circle\n\n[edit]\n\nRed Circle was a DC Comics line of comic books in the DC Universe featuring the Red Circle characters.[citation needed] The line was the second licensed attempt of DC to use these characters, the previous attempt being Impact Comics.\n\nDC was granted the license to the Red Circle characters in 2008. DC planned to merge the characters into the DC Universe and tapped writer J. Michael Straczynski to write their introductory stories in the series The Brave and the Bold in 2009. The line was instead launched as a series of one-shots in August 2009.[7] The Red Circle one-shots were followed in September by The Shield ongoing series with an Inferno back-up feature and The Web ongoing series with a Hangman back-up feature.[50] Both titles folded after 10 issues, to be replaced by The Mighty Crusaders ongoing series which, by issue #3, was shortened to a six-issue miniseries.[51] By July 2011, DC no longer had the rights to them.[52]\n\nThe New Age of Heroes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New Age of Heroes, originally called Dark Matter, spun out of DC comics' 2017 event Dark Nights: Metal. This line introduced new characters and teams into the DC Universe. This line was headed up by DC Comics' master class with contributors such as Greg Capullo, Andy Kubert, Jim Lee and John Romita Jr.[53] The Dark Multiverse concept is a fluxing reality responding to the viewer's subconscious fears.[54]\n\nThe Dark Nights: Metal six-issue miniseries started in August 2017. The event introduced the Dark Multiverse concept and the Dark Knights, a villainous team that mixed Batman with other Justice League members. Dark Matter was initially announced to have five titles, but had two more added.[54]\n\nTitles\n\nThe Silencer by Dan Abnett and John Romita Jr. (September 2017) - the story in which the world's most deadly assassin unretires due to her past returning to haunt her.[53]\n\nBrimstone by Justin Jordan and Philip Tan[54]\n\nThe Terrifics by Jeff Lemire and Ivan Reis[54]\n\nDamage\n\nSideways\n\nNew Challengers\n\nImmortal Men\n\nThe Unexpected\n\nTSR\n\n[edit]\n\nTSR was a DC comic book line based on games licensed from TSR, Inc.\n\nDragonlance was first to be licensed and published with its first issue hitting the stands in August 1988. Additional titles followed with issue one of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in October and Gammarauders in November. In July 1989, Forgotten Realms began publication. In October, Gammarauders was canceled with issue #10.[dct 11] An annual anthology, TSR Worlds #1, was launched in July 1990 with Spelljammer, beginning a 15 issues run the next month.
