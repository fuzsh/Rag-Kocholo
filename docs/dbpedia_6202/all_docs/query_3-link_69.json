        "text": "AUTHORS AND AGENTS: READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PROPOSAL\n\nRow House and all of its imprints accept proposals from agents and unagented authors on a continuous basis. Generous Press is an independently-run imprint; find their submission guidelines here.\n\nRow House, Wheat Penny Press, 100 Block by Row House, and small. accept proposals from agented authors on an exclusive basis only, which means that we do not accept proposals sent to other publishers for consideration. However, authors without representation can submit their proposal on a non-exclusive basis. All submissions will be answered via email within 45 days. Please do not inquire about the status of your proposal before that 45-day period has passed.\n\nOpen submissions: Row House and our imprints will never require that an author have agent representation to submit their proposal. Nor will agented authors receive preferential treatment of any kind. The submission process is weighted equally for all authors.\n\nNote on accessibility: We at Row House believe that every person—no matter their background, identity, or disability—should have an equal opportunity to tell their story. Therefore, if any of our submission guidelines do not meet your access needs, please email us here and let us know how we can assist you in submitting your proposal.\n\nBefore submitting: Thank you for considering Row House as a potential home for your book! Please read the “ROW HOUSE BOOKS ARE…” section and the guidelines on this page carefully. All elements of your submission must be present to be considered for publication. How your proposal is prepared (overview, bio, marketing plan, etc.) gives our editorial team a good indication of how you will be able to talk about and market your book to potential readers and booksellers. Only complete submissions will be passed on to our acquisition team.\n\nRow House’s standard contracts are available for your review here. This is a chance for you to evaluate whether Row House is the right fit for your book. Our contracts also include an eleven-page Book Launch Success Plan, a proprietary document that provides a step-by-step framework and timeline to help each of our authors promote, market, and support their book using easily-accessible tools and methods.\n\nResponse time and process: Please allow 45 days for our team to review your submission and respond via email. All submissions are reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis, and no preference is given to agented authors. Please email proposal questions only to submissions and refrain from requesting an update on your proposal before the 45-day review period. Also note that we do not offer editorial notes or feedback on submissions."
