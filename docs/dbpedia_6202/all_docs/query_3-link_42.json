The shortlists and winners all demonstrate the combination of unforgettable writing, exceptional sales, and an outstanding approach to publishing which make the book business the original creative sector, and the go-to home of storytelling.\n\nThe Trade Awards celebrate every step in the book creation chain, from independent bookshops, and regional small presses, to the industry’s largest players, from agents championing debut authors to marketers and publicists finding the most creative routes to readers. The book industry is an intricate and deeply collaborative ecosystem, and we are here to shine a light on every bit of it.\n\nThe Awards is a snapshot of the industry’s achievements and output, and reflects a business that is at the heart of many different conversations. It is committed to amplifying publishing talent from traditionally underrepresented communities, and ensures that this is upheld throughout the event and beyond. Publishers make books for everyone, and the Awards echoes their commitment to freedom of expression with texts that can challenge and inform, as well as entertain.\n\nAt its core, the Awards acknowledges the intimate connection between the books, their makers and their audience. And that is always something to celebrate.\n\nDefault Step\n\nSee below for the full list of 2024 categories\n\nBooks, Authors and Illustrators\n\nBook of the Year - Audiobook: Fiction\n\nBook of the Year - Audiobook: Non-Fiction\n\nBook of the Year - Children's Fiction\n\nBook of the Year - Children's Illustrated\n\nBook of the Year - Children's Non-Fiction\n\nBook of the Year - Fiction\n\nBook of the Year - Crime & Thriller\n\nBook of the Year - Début Fiction\n\nBook of the Year - Non-fiction: Lifestyle & Illustrated\n\nBook of the Year - Non-fiction: Narrative\n\nBook of the Year - Pageturner\n\nBook of the Year - Discover\n\nAuthor of the Year\n\nIllustrator of the Year\n\nBook Trade Awards\n\nAcademic, Educational & Professional Publisher of the Year\n\nBook Retailer of the Year\n\nBritish Book Award for Export\n\nChildren's Bookseller of the Year\n\nChildren's Publisher of the Year\n\nDesigner of the Year\n\nEditor of the Year\n\nImprint of the Year\n\nIndependent Bookshop of the Year\n\nIndependent Publisher of the Year\n\nIndividual Bookseller of the Year\n\nLiterary Agent of the Year\n\nMarketing Strategy of the Year\n\nPublicity Campaign of the Year\n\nPublisher of the Year\n\nRights Professional of the Year\n\nSmall Press of the Year\n\nVideo\n\nThe British Book Awards 2023 - Highlights\n\nTop tips from the judges\n\nWe know you’re all working furiously to make your entries the best they can be, and appreciate how much craft and energy goes into the process. And we’re here to help - here are a few tips from the team and the judges, that will help to make your entries really shine.\n\nBook Trade entries\n\nTell Us A Story. Our judges are primed to read your detailed entries, including all of the facts and figures behind your successful years. But they, like you, love a narrative - try to go beyond chronology and the day-to-day to show us something extraordinary.\n\nPresent It Properly. Your document doesn’t need to be professionally designed, but do be conscious of your presentation. You’re delivering a lot of information, and basics like mismatched fonts, long chunks of text without pause or disorganised data can interfere with how our judges process what you’re trying to share.\n\nDon’t Hide the Wrinkles. Not everyone has a good year every year. Tell us the positives, but don’t shy away from what went wrong. Sometimes success is about dealing with adversity first.\n\nGet Granular. Nibbies judges are incredibly knowledgeable, but it’s best not to assume they know all the internal workings of your team. If you secured great PR, tell us what your pitch was. If you had a stellar year, break down the figures and tell us what they mean. We judge hundreds of entries each year, and it is often that extra level of detail that’ll bag you the win.\n\nPivot… PIVOT! Part of the challenge of going above and beyond in publishing is how to adapt to challenges and how to replot our strategy or path. Did this lead to innovation? Finding new revenue streams? Did you do things that surprised you and how did this bring unimagined success?\n\nPolish and re-polish. Clarity and brevity win over filler, every time. Cut the fluff, think about what’s really special about your entry and make it pleasurable to read and where appropriate, quick to scan - think bullet points, charts, screengrabs, where it makes sense to include these.\n\nChange the World. Did your work have a wider impact for the greater good - on the author’s fortunes, the publisher’s confidence, the reading public? What beyond the bottom line did you achieve? Maybe you inspired the next generation of readers through some of your clever marketing activity, or the publicity reached into parts unknown, or you partnered with an organisation whose aims aligned with yours? If you’re a bookseller, how did your work impact your customer base in a positive way? This storytelling paints a picture - we want to know!\n\nWhy you? Why now? If you’re entering your incredible self for one of the trade awards, don’t be shy. Tell us why this was your year - ask others for supporting quotes and illustrate your impact with lists, visuals, charts or whatever really makes your entry sing.\n\nBook of the Year entries\n\nTake Up Space (but not too much space). Have you given yourself enough space to paint a complete picture, and to demonstrate that you’re serious about a win? Consider whether what you’re entering tells the full story of what you’ve accomplished (but edit enough to keep things moving!).\n\nDefine the Difference. We know you had your choice of which titles to enter. What did you do differently for this one? Where did you take a risk, innovate or depart from the norm? Show us why the whole publishing process behind this title sets it apart, not just from the rest of the industry but from the other titles you work on.\n\nCurate Your Quotes. And everything else, really. Judges are reading a lot of entries and after a point, too many quotes, photos or references start to feel like filler. It’s hard to define how many is too many, but if you’re not actively selecting the best of the bunch, do.\n\nPractical stuff\n\nDon’t Sweat the Category. If you aren’t sure which is most relevant for your entry, enter where it feels best and drop us a note to let us know you’re unsure. If we think it needs to move, we’ll move it, with an eye to ensuring it’s placed where it has the highest likelihood of being shortlisted.\n\n5pm on 1st February is not a good time to upload. Our website is amazing, but if/when everyone uploads at that exact time, it will fall over. Then we will be sad, and you will be anxious, and nobody wins.\n\nPut Your Photos Forward. From the print magazine to social media shoutouts, we want to do everything we can to make your work shine. Help us do this as well as possible by sending us a selection of sharp, hi-res images that we can use to represent you.\n\nGot more questions?

Steadman\n\nIn the inaugural episode of The Nibbies Podcast, Hannah MacInnes interviews A.F. Steadman, author of the bestselling series of enormously well received dragon novels for children, Skandar and the Phantom Rider.\n\nIllustrator of the Year\n\nIllustrator of the Year\n\nJamie Smart\n\nBy any measure, Jamie Smart had a remarkable 12 months. Sales of his books grew 84% in 2023, making Smart one of the biggest-selling graphic novelists, outpacing (in growth terms) even last year's Illustrator of the Year, Alice Oseman. Sales of his breakthrough series, Bunny vs Monkey - first published a decade ago - rose 81% year on year.\n\nBunny vs Monkey 7: Multiverse Mix-up! (the Children's Illustrated Book of the Year) marked a step change too; it sold a third more than its predecessor. It topped the indie bookshop charts in the UK, and in Ireland. Published by David Fickling Books for 10 years, Smart's work contributed £3.5m of DFB's £4.3m coffers.\n\nBut is it not just about the numbers. Smart has been working in the weeds of this sector for more than two decades, his first weekly children's comic was in the Sunday Times' children's supplement the Funday Times, before spending a decade at the Dandy. He developed his work at DFB's weekly The Phoenix and continues to draw for it, viewing it as the heartbeat of the UK comics scene, holding events and workshops at the annual sold-out Phoenix Fest.In an interview with The Bookseller, Smart said: \"There's a kind of renaissance happening... I really hope it grows even more and that publishers put their faith in comic creators.\" They seem to be: of the six titles shortlisted for the Children's Illustrated award in 2024, three were comics.\n\nSponsored by Sweet Cherry Publishing\n\nSweet Cherry is a small independent publisher with a great, big mission! Based in Leicester, where one in 10 children live in poverty, we aim to bring fantastic stories within reach of every child. Our mission is to make books fun and accessible for all children, everywhere.\n\nOverall Book of the Year\n\nOverall Book of the Year: Winner\n\nMurdle\n\nG T Karber\n\nSouvenir Press\n\nThe final judging panel crowned the Non-Fiction Lifestyle & Illustrated Book of the Year winner, Murdle, as the Overall Book of the Year. They \"loved the whole concept\", praising the book as a \"really clever idea done really well\" and agreed this \"genius\" book had expanded the market.\n\nOur judges \"admired\" GT Karber for creating a \"truly special\" book that captivated a broad readership of all ages, from puzzle lovers to crime enthusiasts. Souvenir Press actioned an all-year­ round campaign to feed the word-of-mouth frenzy. Everything from bookseller-led \"Murdle nights\" and bespoke merchandise to a week-long author tour meant this book was the word on everyone's lips, and the imprint's work helped Murdle top the charts as the Christmas Number One.\n\nThe discussion was chaired by The Bookseller books editor Alice O'Keeffe and the judges comprised Anita Singh, arts and entertainment editor at the Telegraph; Lorraine Kelly, TV presenter and author; Adrian Chiles, writer and broadcaster; Sarah Gwonyoma, book critic; Claire Walker, co-chief executive of the Society of London Theatre; and Kate Skipper, chief operating officer of Waterstones. Our panel felt Murdle stands as the book of 2023, with \"phenomenal\" sales of more than 360,000 copies.\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nNone of This is True\n\nLisa Jewell, narrated by Nicola Walker and Louise Brealey\n\nPenguin Random House Audio\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Audiobook: Fiction\n\nStrong Female Character\n\nWritten and narrated by Fern Brady\n\nBrazen\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Audiobook: Non-Fiction\n\nBunny vs Monkey: Multiverse Mix-up\n\nWritten and illustrated by Jamie Smart\n\nDavid Fickling Books\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Children's Illustrated\n\nImpossible Creatures\n\nKatherine Rundell\n\nBloomsbury Children's Books\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Children's Fiction\n\nBrilliant Black British History\n\nAtinuke, illustrated by Kingsley Nebechi\n\nBloomsbury Children's Books\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Children's Non-Fiction\n\nLessons from Our Ancestors\n\nRaksha Dave, illustrated by Kimberlie Clinthorne-Wong\n\nMagic Cat Publishing\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Discover\n\nYellowface\n\nRebecca F Kuang\n\nThe Borough Press\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Fiction\n\nNone of This is True\n\nLisa Jewell\n\nCentury\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Fiction: Crime & Thriller\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nAlice Winn\n\nViking\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Fiction: Début\n\nMurdle\n\nG T Karber\n\nSouvenir Books\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Non-Fiction: Lifestyle\n\nPolitics on the Edge\n\nRory Stewart\n\nJonathan Cape\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Non-Fiction Narrative\n\nFourth Wing\n\nRebecca Yarros\n\nPiatkus\n\nWINNER Book of the Year - Pageturner\n\nAuthor of the Year\n\nProudly sponsored by Montegrappa\n\nWinner\n\nKatherine Rundell\n\nThe past 12 months has confirmed Katherine Rundell as the pre-eminent children's author of her generation. On publication of her middle-grade title Impossible Creatures (named Children's Fiction Book of the Year), author Michael Morpurgo asserted: \"There was Tolkien, there is Pullman, and now there is Katherine Rundell.\"\n\nThe award-winning John Donne biographer, essayist, St Catherine's College fellow, tightrope walker, rooftop climber and screenwriter is also a campaigning voice for the importance of books for children, and a powerful cultural figure whose unique mix of brain power, eloquence and fero­cious imagination have delivered dazzling results.\n\nRundell's is the kind of story publishers dream of. Her first book was published in her early twen­ties, her second won the Waterstones Children's Book Prize and the Blue Peter Award, her fourth a Costa. She's an author with a huge imagination, an encyclopedic knowledge, vital and vibrant storytelling, and the ability to infuse any subject matter with warmth, wit and curiosity.\n\nLast year saw the paperback of her Donne biography Super-Infinite, picture book The Zebra's Great Escape and non-fiction title The Golden Mole. Impossible Creatures has sold more than five times her previous children's hardback book: this really has been the year of Katherine Rundell - undoubtedly the first of many.\n\nGallery\n\nPhotos from The British Book Awards 2022\n\nCredit: The British Book Awards and David Parry\n\nFor arrival photography, click here\n\nBook Retailer of the Year\n\nProudly sponsored by Simon & Schuster\n\nWhile book sales volumes softened in 2023, it was an excellent year for these seven retailers. The dominance of internet operators—including two, LoveReading and World of Books, that make this shortlist for the first time—reflects the accelerated migration to online spending during Covid, and leaves Waterstones and the National Trust as the only bricks-and-mortar booksellers.\n\nThis shortlist will be completed by two more retailers: the winners of the Independent Bookshop of the Year and Children’s Bookseller of the Year.\n\nWinner\n\nThe Children's Bookshop\n\nThe Children's Bookshop in Muswell Hill adds this prestigious award to the trophy for Children's Bookseller of the Year. In the 11 years of the Book Retailer of the Year prize in its current format, it is only the second independent to win.\n\nThe shop, SO years young in 2024, is revered by generations of children, parents, grandparents and teachers. It does the fundamentals of bookselling brilliantly, with five in-store book clubs, free storytime sessions, sreat window displays and lively social media, and estimates that four in five books are hand­sold by owner Sanchita Basu De Sarkar and her exceptional team. It is a priority stop on signing tours for just about every big children's author and illustrator.\n\nBut it is the array of activity beyond the shop that really sets The Children's Bookshop apart from other book retailers. World Book Day encapsulated its energy, with 35 external events in five days and, when teacher strikes threatened to scupper school activity, it held a free party of its own for 400 children.\n\nThe emphasis is always on engaging not just keen readers but children of all abilities and backgrounds. That. and a growing aware­ness of the impact of the cost-of-living crisis. led the shop to give away hundreds of books to local schools, charities, shelters, prisons and refusee centres, and work with an autism centre to develop a learning library for children with additional needs.\n\nTestimonials highlight the passion of The Children's Bookshop. \"Its dedication to making sure that children have a joyful, inspirational experience of reading for fun is so impressive,\" said one. As the British Book Awards judges put it: \"It's a simply amazing shop and team ... you just can't fault it.\"\n\nShortlist\n\nBooks2Door\n\nOnline retailer Books2Door is shortlisted for the third year in a row. Orders surged by a fifth in 2023 after it embraced two big trends in bookselling: TikTok, where it already averages £50,000 of sales a month and has struck partnerships and live streams with top BookTokkers; and book boxes, where it introduced new Box2Door subscription deals.\n\nBookshop.org\n\nBookshop.org’s value to independent booksellers during Covid was recognised by this award in 2022. Last year it passed the milestone of £3m profits earned for 600 indies, plus affiliates including the Women’s Prize. It stepped up promo work with social media influencers, added new strands to its children’s books offer and launched a charitable Read It Forward initiative with BookTrust.\n\nLoveReading\n\nLike Bookshop.org, recommendation and retail platform LoveReading has a social purpose that goes well beyond selling books. Its model of sending a quarter of buyers’ spend to schools of their choice is helping cash-strapped libraries to get more children reading for pleasure. It is also starting to support in-person events, including as partner of The Week’s book awards and festival.\n\nMonwell\n\nMonwell, the manager of online bookshops for newspapers, flies under the radar of most consumers—but not of trade publishers. It added the Times to the Guardian, Mail and Express in 2023, and is moving into subscription packages and non-book products. With literary review space under mounting pressure, Monwell has built an important bridge from media coverage to revenue.\n\nNational Trust\n\nWith 121 retail sites, and second-hand shops at many more of its properties, the National Trust is a bigger bookseller than some realise—and a particularly valuable one for its publishing partners, HarperCollins and Nosy Crow. Shortlisted at the British Book Awards for the first time since 2017, its team’s market knowledge, merchandising and promos are the equal of many pure book retailers.\n\nWaterstones\n\nA ninth shortlist place in 10 years shows the consistency of Waterstones since James Daunt took the helm in 2011. It seized good shares of many of 2023’s biggest sellers, especially Prince Harry’s Spare and G T Karber’s Murdle, while helping to break out many more new voices. Events revenue was the best ever and seven new openings showed its confidence for the future.\n\nWorld of Books\n\nWOB has sold second-hand books for two decades now, but consumers’ focus on online sales, sustainability and price has moved it up a gear. By helping individuals and charities to rehome used books it has saved millions from pulping, and its online experience increasingly matches bookshop browsing. An author-share scheme has started to address the tricky issue of compensating creators for secondary sales.\n\nBook of the Year - Audiobook Non-Fiction\n\nMemoirs from stalwarts of British media and royalty, alongside histories and self-development titles, make up this eclectic shortlist. What all the titles have in common is premium author care and innovative campaigns championing the audiobook genre.\n\nWinner\n\nStrong Female Character\n\nWritten and narrated by Fern Brady\n\nBrazen\n\nComedian Fern Brady's \"honest\" and \"heartfelt\" memoir Strong Female Character resonated with our panel of judges, who called the audio edition \"fascinating and beautiful\". Voiced by the author, Brady's \"profoundly impactful\" account of her life as a woman living with autism was called \"eye-opening\" by our panel.\n\nBrazen knew it had something special with Strong Female Character and utilised Brady's existing audience to promote awareness of neurodiversity and help the audiobook find the listeners who needed it most. Brady's tour audiences were also offered a voucher for the audio edition, which was recognised as one of Apple and Audible's audio­ books of the year. Our judges agreed Strong Female Character was an \"intimate\" and \"raw\" listening experience which \"achieved a deep-to­ the-bone honesty\", making it a clear stand-out in this category.\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nAlan Partridge: Big Beacon\n\nWritten and narrated by Alan Partridge\n\nSeven Dials/Orion\n\nSteve Coogan dons his Alan Partridge persona once more in this hilarious account of Partridge’s attempt to return to his primetime TV slot and his efforts to rebuild a lighthouse. Narrated by Coogan and written with long-term collaborators Neil and Rob Gibbons, Big Beacon was Hachette’s biggest ever non-fiction audiobook pre-order. Seven Dials ran animated audio extracts and a pre-order competition in which the lucky winner received a personalised message from Alan himself.\n\nMaking It So\n\nWritten and narrated by Patrick Stewart\n\nGallery UK/Simon & Schuster\n\nThe icon of British television and film Patrick Stewart narrates his charming memoir Making It So in what was a carefully considered and thoughtful publication from Gallery UK that helped this audiobook top the Audible charts on release. The campaign lent into all aspects of Stewart’s life, from his career on screen to his childhood in Yorkshire, with outdoor advertising across the north of England presenting scannable QR codes to play audio clips.\n\nSpare\n\nWritten and narrated by Prince Harry\n\nPenguin Random House Audio\n\nPrince Harry’s record-breaking memoir Spare, written with J R Moehringer, ruled the audiobook charts on release, with deft narration from the royal himself creating an intimate listening experience. Penguin implemented a meticulous, global campaign and made the decision to run no advertising on social media or spaces where users could leave comments, instead running ads with podcasts with a listening base interested in mental health and wellness.\n\nStrong Female Character\n\nWritten and narrated by Fern Brady\n\nBrazen/Octopus Publishing Group\n\nComedian Fern Brady recounts her life as a woman living with autism in her honest memoir, Strong Female Character, which was recognised as one of Apple and Audible’s audiobooks of the year. Brazen utilised Brady’s existing public profile to push audiobook sales, offering her tour audiences a voucher for the audio edition. The memoir triumphed in audio and remains the publisher’s number one title on Spotify.\n\nThe Diary of a CEO\n\nWritten and narrated by Steven Bartlett\n\nPenguin Random House Audio\n\nAuthor and narrator Steven Bartlett brings his conversational podcast style and entrepreneurial and self-development expertise to the audio edition of The Diary of a CEO. With only two weeks of Bartlett’s time available to promote the audio edition, Penguin Random House Audio instigated a no-holds-barred campaign, running its first ever advertising on Apple News and sending padlocked golden boxes to influencers with a download code for the audiobook.\n\nUnruly\n\nWritten and narrated by David Mitchell\n\nPenguin Random House Audio\n\nDavid Mitchell’s witty history of the English monarchy ruled the autumn on release. Penguin Random House Audio launched Unruly's pre-order campaign with a 15-minute video of Mitchell and identified the ‘Twixtmas’ period as a ripe opportunity, running a fresh slew of Guardian advertising. Mitchell also wrote and hosted a pub quiz for Greene King that was then rolled out across 35 pubs.\n\nBook of the Year - Audiobook Fiction\n\nFrom literary icons to genre titans and debut voices, the audio fiction shortlist champions the audiobook as a vital part of a story’s longevity. Well-known voices such as Nicola Walker and Samuel West feature alongside series narrators Robert Glenister and Lauryn Allman.\n\nWinner\n\nNone of This is True\n\nLisa Jewell, narrated by Nicola Walker and Louise Brealey\n\nPenguin Random House Audio\n\nLisa Jewell triumphs again in a watershed year for the author, clinching both Audio Fiction and Crime & Thriller Book of the Year for the ingenious None of This is True, brought to life in audio by actors Nicola Walker and Louise Brealey. Our judges were \"blown away by this audiobook\", proclaiming it a \"groundbreaking\" production.\n\nPenguin Random House Audio produced an \"innovative\" marketing campaign that championed a creative and commercial vision for the novel. The idea to create a true crime podcast using audiobook content and additional material penned by the author was hailed as a \"resourceful and thoughtful\". \"This is Jewell's moment\", our panel agreed.\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nImpossible Creatures\n\nKatherine Rundell, narrated by Samuel West\n\nBloomsbury Children’s Books\n\nActor Samuel West lends his voice to Katherine Rundell’s fantastical tale of a magical archipelago inhabited by the creatures of myth and legend. Bloomsbury Children’s Books ran a slew of digital advertising to promote the audio edition of Impossible Creatures, reaching more than one million people, and reinvigorated the Audible children’s bestseller list, normally dominated by backlist titles.\n\nNone of This is True\n\nLisa Jewell, narrated by Nicola Walker and Louise Brealey\n\nPenguin Random House Audio\n\nLisa Jewell’s crime hit None of This Is True, follows podcaster Alix who becomes immersed in her birthday twin’s life after a chance encounter. With 12 narrators, including actors Nicola Walker and Louise Brealey in the titular roles, Penguin Random House Audio produced an immersive listening experience, incorporating the podcast and true-crime documentary elements of the novel into the audiobook.\n\nPoor Things\n\nAlasdair Gray, narrated by Russ Bain and Kathryn Drysdale\n\nW. F. Howes\n\nIn an example of savvy publishing, W F Howes released Alasdair Gray’s Poor Things with a striking film tie-in audiobook cover.

Selected as a Richard and Judy Book Club Pick, this psychological thriller finished the year in the Nielsen UK Top 50 of 2023’s bestselling titles.\n\nBook of the Year - Non-Fiction: Lifestyle & Illustrated\n\nFrom an instant cookery brand to what not to eat, an addictive murder mystery puzzle to life-enhancing poetry, this year’s Lifestyle and Illustrated shortlist may be broad in scope but these books are united by clever campaigns and impressive sales.\n\nThe Winner\n\nMurdle\n\nG T Karber\n\nSouvenir Press\n\nG T Karber's Murdle smashed all expectations last year as the book of the festive season, uniting puzzle fans and mystery readers alike in a winning combination best described as Cluedo crossed with Sudoku. 'Truly innovative\", said one judge; \"a phenomenon\", added another; \"incredibly charming\", declared a third.\n\nSouvenir Press created an iconic package with Murdle and our panel were impressed with the publisher's decisions at every stage, from \"canny\" acquisition to the production of a \"revolutionary\" book and a non-stop campaign. The team threw their relatively small but mighty weight behind Murdle, nurturing this new brand via influencer mail­ outs and securing Waterstones support before the festive word-of­ mouth flurry began. Our judges agreed that Murdle has \"reinvigorated\" the market and created a new area of publishing.\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nBored of Lunch: The Healthy Air Fryer Book\n\nNathan Anthony\n\nEbury Press\n\nEbury discovered lockdown cooking account @Boredoflunch, run by Nathan Anthony, and turned it into a leading brand. With the cost-of-living crisis looming and people seeking energy-saving alternatives to ovens, Bored of Lunch: The Healthy Air Fryer Book was published at the perfect time. Ebury tailored the campaign to all retailers, achieving great success with The Works, which had the second-largest market share. It is the fifth fastest-selling cookbook of all time.\n\nGhosts: The Button House Archives\n\nMathew Baynton, Simon Farnaby, Martha Howe-Douglas, Jim Howick, Laurence Rickard and Ben Willbond\n\nBloomsbury General\n\nThe official companion to the much-loved hit TV series, Ghosts: The Button House Archives needed to encapsulate the warmth, gentle humour and emotional depth of the show. Working with the six authors, who are also the show’s scriptwriters and actors, to a tight timeline, Bloomsbury produced a beautiful, high-spec treasure trove of historical artefacts belonging to the ghosts for readers young and old. It was Bloomsbury’s third-bestselling hardback of the year.\n\nLet The Light Pour In\n\nLemn Sissay\n\nCanongate\n\nFor 10 years, Lemn Sissay has written a poem as dawn is breaking. Let the Light Pour In is both a collection of his best work, and also a model of how a daily practice of art might improve mental health and well-being. A coveted spot on BBC Breakfast, focusing on morning practices, saw pre-orders spike. Canongate worked with Waterstones, World Poetry Day and the Natural Voice Network choir, who performed one of Lemn’s poems live at sunrise on publication day.\n\nMarr's Guitars\n\nJohnny Marr\n\nThames & Hudson\n\nThis lavish visual guide to the extensive collection of the influential former Smiths guitarist features Pat Graham’s macro photography of each individual guitar interspersed with anecdotes from Johnny Marr. The musician prepared AV material for each guitar, playing and discussing how they had inspired or enhanced a particular song, which was used online. The limited-edition print run of Marr’s Guitars, in a slipcase made of a material more usually found in amps, sold out in four hours, a T&H record.\n\nMurdle\n\nG. T. Karber\n\nSouvenir Press\n\nThe standout Christmas gift bestseller, Murdle is best described as Cluedo crossed with Sudoku; a new type of logic puzzle that invites the reader to solve a murder mystery. The book’s distinctive, eye-catching design made it an irresistible till-side purchase for fans of smart puzzling. With bookshops encouraged to host their own ‘Murdle Nights’, word-of-mouth soon spread. With impressive sales from publication onwards, it took the coveted Christmas number one slot.\n\nUltra-Processed People\n\nChris van Tulleken\n\nCornerstone Press\n\nThe first book from NHS doctor and presenter Chris van Tulleken is an authoritative account of the damage that ultra-processed food (UPF) is doing to our bodies. Cornerstone Press began by establishing the author as the expert on UPF, while the campaign launched with a three-part serial in the Mail and key broadcast interviews from “BBC Breakfast” to “The One Show”. Ultra-Processed People went into the charts at number one, spending nine weeks there and a further 19 weeks in the top three.\n\nBook of the Year - Non-Fiction: Narrative\n\nFrom a pop icon to a sports hero, from a dragon with life advice to a prince with something to get off his chest, this year’s Narrative shortlist is filled with those telling their own story, but there’s also room for a history book that tells the story of many.\n\nWinner\n\nPolitics on the Edge: A Memoir from Within\n\nRory Stewart\n\nJonathan Cape\n\nIn a shortlist dominated by well-known names, Rory Stewart triumphed with his \"honest, candid, dark and funny\" memoir, Politics on the Edge. In a falling market for politics books, our panel agreed that this \"breaks the mould of politics publishing\". Not only did our judges commend the \"captivating\" quality of writing; they also thought that \"in very troubling times, Politics on the Edge asks some very important questions\". The \"striking\" photographic cover helped push Stewart's title beyond a political readership and Jonathan Cape constructed an \"impressive\", egalitarian campaign, securing a host of television interviews and leveraging Stewart's podcast audience to make this memoir the narrative book of the year. Our panel agreed that Politics on the Edge \"ticked all the boxes\" and they admired both the memoir and the author's desire to instigate political change.\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nNormal Women\n\nPhilippa Gregory\n\nWilliam Collins\n\nA radical retelling of English history, Philippa Gregory’s “tribute to the women of England” (not just a handful of famous ones) was acquired in a hotly contested seven-way auction. The publisher launched a bespoke eight-part podcast to accompany publication of Normal Women, to further expand the audience for the book, and the author undertook a big tour complete with a dynamic audio and visual presentation that was adjusted for every city to incorporate regional stories from the book.\n\nPolitics on the Edge\n\nRory Stewart\n\nJonathan Cape\n\nJonathan Cape set out to publish a political memoir “like no other”, a book with an urgent mission to expose the issues at the heart of our government in a falling market for political books. The striking photographic jacket, capturing Rory Stewart mid-stride, perfectly positioned the book outside the Westminster bubble. An impressive raft of TV interviews reached an audience of all political hues and the book hit number one in the non-fiction charts on publication. Indie retailers did particularly well, taking 34% market share.\n\nSpare\n\nPrince Harry\n\nBantam\n\nMeticulous planning with retailer partners, extra tight security and “one of the most complicated and sensitive logistics plan any of us will ever experience” (according to one retailer) underpinned the success of Spare, the first memoir from a serving member of the British royal family. Prince Harry’s book, written with J R Moehringer, which set the news agenda both before and after publication, sold more than 700,000 copies through the TCM. It is the fastest-selling non-fiction hardback since records began and finished 2023 as the biggest-selling book of the year.\n\nThe Diary of a CEO\n\nSteven Bartlett\n\nEbury Edge\n\nEntrepreneur, “Dragons’ Den” star and host of the UK’s number one podcast of the same name, Steven Bartlett’s The Diary of a CEO became the fastest-selling personal development book since records began. Ebury moved beyond the author’s own impressive social media following (7.3 million across all channels) to collaborate with a number of creators (reaching a total audience size of 55 million) in a stunt involving a locked Perspex box, a gold box and a secret code that went viral.\n\nThe Extra Mile\n\nKevin Sinfield\n\nCentury\n\nThe memoir from Rugby League legend Kevin Sinfield, co-written by Paul Hayward, documents not just the athlete’s sporting achievements but also his commitment to raising awareness of motor neurone disease (MND), which has afflicted his best friend and fellow rugby star Rob Burrow. Century worked with the MND Association to deliver an online event for MND sufferers, and during publication week MND charities raised an estimated £40,000. The Extra Mile is the bestselling sports autobiography of 2023.\n\nThe Woman in Me\n\nBritney Spears\n\nGallery UK\n\nThe memoir from international pop icon Britney Spears was acquired in a confidential and highly competitive auction. With no access to the star herself, S&S created a headline-grabbing campaign in which an army of Britney superfans took to the streets of London, resulting in a flood of picture stories across the nationals. A midnight launch at drag venue Mrs Riot and a Waterstones first-of-its-kind, Britney-themed silent disco created huge buzz, making publication day a real celebration.\n\nBook of the Year - Pageturner\n\nSupported by Stylist\n\nThe Pageturner award celebrates bestselling books hailing from all genres and formats. All the shortlisted books managed to cut through in crowded commercial, romance and fantasy markets, with tales set everywhere from the southern Appalachian Mountains to a fantastical dragon school.\n\nWinner\n\nFourth Wing\n\nRebecca Yarros\n\nPiatkus\n\nFourth Wing flew to victory in this category as the first hardback winner of the Pageturner award. Rebecca Yarros' enthralling blend of dragons, academia, magic and a potent enemies-to­ lovers plot converted judges and readers alike to the fantasy genre. A \"ground-breaking\" book, remarked one judge, with another adding: 'The industry and reader impact has been astonishing.\"\n\nAlready a prolific romance writer, Piatkus took the opportunity to launch Yarros in a new direction with an \"impressive\" marketing campaign that covered both digital and traditional routes, establishing an in-store presence with Waterstones, managing an author tour, which considered Yarros' chronic illness, and producing multiple special editions to drive buzz. With a shade under 200,000 copies sold in hard­ back, Fourth Wing was the bestselling SFF book in the UK last year.\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nDemon Copperhead\n\nBarbara Kingsolver\n\nFaber\n\nFaber has not stopped in its quest to cement Barbara Kingsolver as one of the most important writers of today with the paperback release of the garlanded Demon Copperhead. Kingsolver’s modern reimagining of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield was supported with an extensive author tour that maximised her limited time, a new character-led cover and an indie edition to make this Kingsolver’s most successful UK publication.\n\nFourth Wing\n\nRebecca Yarros\n\nPiatkus\n\nContinuing from its explosive launch, Fourth Wing is the first hardback to appear on this shortlist since its inception in 2021. Rebecca Yarros’ compulsive romantasy, fronted with a protagonist with a disability, was the bestselling SFF book in the UK last year. Piatkus produced multiple editions including an exclusive, highly sought after edition with FairyLoot and a slot on the BBC’s “The Radio 2 Book Club” to make Fourth Wing a hit year-round.\n\nIcebreaker\n\nHannah Grace\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\nThe first in Hannah Grace’s Maple Hills romance series scored top points at S&S as its bestselling debut of the year. Acquired and published in three months, S&S worked quickly to position Grace’s originally self-published American sports romance as a social media hit, with a team of TikTok ambassadors helping make Icebreaker the third bestselling romance title of the year.\n\nIt Starts with Us\n\nColleen Hoover\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\nColleen Hoover returns to this year’s shortlist with the chart-topping It Starts with Us, the sequel to It Ends with Us. Written in response to fan demand, the story of Lily and Atlas continues in the bestselling romance title of 2023. S&S held fortnightly TikTok meetings in the lead-up to publication and created a “Lily Bloom’s” florist installation at Waterstones Liverpool, Manchester and Piccadilly for BookFest.\n\nThe Lost Bookshop\n\nEvie Woods\n\nOne More Chapter\n\nOne More Chapter launched debut author Evie Woods into the Sunday Times bestseller chart with this bookshop mystery about the healing power of books, despite having to move publication forward six months. With no time for proofs and no publicist, the team focused on targeted influencer outreach with digital copies and an online readalong, which, coupled with an eye-catching cover, helped The Lost Bookshop soar, with rights now sold in 20 languages.\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\n\nGabrielle Zevin\n\nVintage\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, Gabrielle Zevin’s iconic novel about creativity and connection, was a monumental success in paperback. Chatto & Windus pulled out all the stops in a year-round seasonal marketing campaign that included cover-reveal scratch cards, a branded ice-cream van, extensive outdoor advertising and a Christmas jumper competition. Not only did the novel place in five supermarkets, but it is also the best performing book so far in Waterstones' coveted ‘Books of the Month’ slot.\n\nMarketing Strategy of the Year\n\nProudly sponsored by Nielsen BookData\n\nThese nine marketing strategies stretch across a wide variety of genres, including fantasy, poetry, children’s books, cookbooks and celebrity memoirs. They showed exceptional passion and creativity and took both debut voices and established authors to new audiences, online and in the real world. While some of these books might have thrived regardless, the campaigns ensured publishers beat all their expectations. The shortlist features three marketing teams from Penguin Random House, which has won this award for the past two years, and two from HarperCollins.\n\nWinner\n\nAbbie Salter, Sian Richefond & Emily Merrill\n\nYellowface\n\nThe Borough Press\n\nSome publishers would have balked at the prospects of an anti-publishing, hard-to-position story such as Rebecca F Kuang's Yellowface. But The Borough Press team of Abbie Salter, Sian Richefond and Emily Merrill tore up the marketing rulebook to create one of the most memorable and commercially successful literary releases of 2023.\n\nThe strategy had inclusion at the core from the start and worked exceptionally hard to earn high-street retailers' support. It was bolstered by a bold yellow cover and collateral that was deployed in one of HarperCollins' biggest ever roll-outs of outdoor ads and point-of-sale merchandise, making the book hard to miss. From the first proof roll-out in spring 2022 to festive p.o.s. for the 2023 Christmas gifting market, it was long-run, wide-screen marketing.\n\nImportantly, the HC team recognised the lack of diversity that Yellowface so expertly skewers. They sought help from East and Southeast Asian (ESEA) consultants, content creators and social media influencers, and positioned ads in channels and positions that were most likely to reach ESEA people.\n\nYellowface could easily have misfired, but the results beat all expectations. It spent 20 weeks in the Sunday Times top 10 and sold 100,000 copies across the year, making it the top liter­ary hardback of 2023 and the fifth-biggest in any genre. Somewhat uncomfortably, it was the only book by an author of colour among the top 30 fiction hardbacks - a reminder of just how much Yellowface and this campaign were needed.\n\n\"The success of the book makes you forget how difficult the title was [to sell],'' said the judges. \"It was an audacious, clever and very hard-working campaign that took every opportunity that came its way.\"\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nAlesha Bonser, Sophie Rosewell\n\nImpossible Creatures by Katherine Rundell\n\nBloomsbury Children's Books\n\nBloomsbury’s work on Katherine Rundell’s Impossible Creatures was a masterclass in building anticipation for a release. Alesha Bonser and Sophie Rosewell lifted Rundell to the major leagues with a campaign full of imagination and ambition. There was some great work with Waterstones, who named this its Book of the Year.\n\nSophie Clarke, Imogen Whiteley and Katie Hall\n\nThe Orange and Other Poems by Wendy Cope\n\nFaber\n\nFaber’s marketers didn’t just promote Wendy Cope’s The Orange and Other Poems: they created it. After Cope’s poem caught fire on TikTok, the marketing trio of Sophie Clarke, Imogen Whiteley and Katie Hall turned round a campaign in just six weeks, using brilliant artwork and influencer promos to reach non-traditional poetry buyers.\n\nRebecca Ikin, Lydia Weigel and Cameron Watson\n\n#Merky Books Literature Festival\n\n#Merky Books, Penguin Random House\n\nPRH celebrated five years of its imprint with a #Merky Books Literature Festival in collaboration with Netflix. Rebecca Ikin, Lydia Weigel and Cameron Watson helped put together talks, workshops, seminars, clinics and more, with the emphasis on accessibility and appealing to readers who might not otherwise have been found.\n\nOlivia Marsden\n\nReally Good, Actually by Monica Heisey\n\n4th Estate\n\nLiv Marsden’s campaign made Monica Heisey’s Really Good, Actually the bestselling new debut fiction release of 2023. It built a big buzz before publication, got traction on TikTok and spread vibrant POS material across bookshops. Relentless activity throughout the year earned TCM sales of 200,000 copies in all editions.\n\nHayley McMullan, Genevieve Barratt and Rich Vlietstra\n\nThe Woman in Me by Britney Spears\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\nThe Woman in Me by Britney Spears was always going to be one of the biggest books of the year, but the Simon & Schuster trio of Hayley McMullan, Genevieve Barratt and Rich Vlietstra smashed all forecasts. The campaign had sensitivity as well as blockbuster activity that led to TCM sales of 250,000 copies in just 10 weeks.\n\nKatrina Northern, Helia Daryani and Amelia Rushen\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\n\nVintage\n\nGabrielle Zevin’s Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow was impossible to ignore in 2023. Vintage’s team of Katrina Northern, Helia Daryani and Amelia Rushen, supported with memorable design from Sally Felton, blitzed bookshops and online platforms and helped make it the TCM’s seventh biggest book of the year.\n\nAbbie Salter, Sian Richefond and Emily Merrill\n\nYellowface by Rebecca F Kuang\n\nThe Borough Press\n\nSome publishers would have struggled with Rebecca F Kuang’s Yellowface, a hard-to-categorise skewering of publishing. But the Borough Press team of Abbie Salter, Sian Richefond and Emily Merrill ran a rule-breaking campaign with advocacy and inclusion at its core, and earned huge support from retailers. Hardback sales alone reached six figures.\n\nDemeter Scanlon\n\nBored of Lunch: The Healthy Air Fryer Book by Nathan Anthony\n\nEbury\n\nNathan Anthony’s Bored of Lunch hit the top of the charts in the first week in January and rolled on all year, becoming the fifth biggest seller of 2023. In between, the Ebury team led by Demeter Scanlon led superb marketing through retailers, socials and influencers, and even managed to turn running out of stock into a selling point.\n\nLaura Vile, Katy Brigden, Gemma Shelley and Alex Cooper\n\nFourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros\n\nPiatkus\n\nThe Piatkus team of Laura Vile, Katy Brigden, Gemma Shelley and Alex Cooper deftly made TikTok romance star Rebecca Yarros a smash hit in fantasy. Social media dominated the pre-pub work on her Empyrean series, but there were great proofs and shop promos too. Across all formats and markets, Piatkus sold nearly a million copies of Fourth Wing.\n\nChildren's Bookseller of the Year\n\nProudly sponsored by Macmillan Children’s Books\n\nWith the cost-of-living crisis squeezing families’ spending, children’s book sales were under pressure in 2023, while retailers were hit by soaring costs of their own. It makes the success of the five small businesses shortlisted here – from long-established names such as Sevenoaks and The Children’s Bookshop to newcomers including Next Page and Wonderland – all the more impressive. Alongside Waterstones and two web-based retailers, they show the invaluable work that children’s booksellers do to engage all children and foster the book buyers of the future.\n\nThe Winner\n\nThe Children's Bookshop\n\nThe Children's Bookshop in London's Muswell Hill celebrates its 50th birthday this year - making it not just the longest-standing children's bookstore in the country, but old enough to be selling books to the grandchildren of its first young customers. Yet it's a shop that never seems to age, with a youthful energy for reading and its community.\n\nWhile it generated a 35% increase in sales last year, owner Sanchita Basu De Sarkar and the indefatigable team of five do far more than run the tills. There was great schools outreach work and some joyful World Book Day activity, while new for 2023 were two additions to the range of book clubs - which have years-long waiting lists to join - and a creative writing course.\n\nSignings with children's publishing A-listers such as Julia Donaldson, David Walliams and Michael Rosen created queues around the block.\n\n\"The booksellers work so hard to be part of the beating heart of the local community ... You can feel the love vividly at work,\" said one grateful visiting author. The Children's Bookshop has always supported new as well as big names, and it's put diversity and inclusion at the core of its offering in recent years, supporting Black, Asian and minority ethnic and LGBTQ+ authors and illustrators. It helped run the UCL/ESEA festival for writers from East and South East Asia (ESEA Lit Fest) and supported numerous charities and community projects.\n\nAll this makes the outstanding shop not just the 2024 Children's Bookseller of the Year but the overall Book Retailer of the Year. \"It's everything a children's bookshop should be,\" said the judges, \"They get stellar sales, even for a great catchment area like Muswell Hill, and are so much more than a bookseller.\"\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nBooks2Door\n\nOnline\n\nOnline bookseller Books2Door, also shortlisted for Book Retailer of the Year, has sustained the momentum it built during Covid lockdowns. It has crafted a compelling offer at TikTok Shop and moved smartly into subscription boxes. Keen pricing and support of under-represented communities help it engage readers that publishers otherwise wouldn’t reach.\n\nHalfway up the Stairs\n\nGreystones\n\nThis County Wicklow independent is shortlisted for the fourth year in a row, and is Ireland’s An Post Bookshop of the Year to boot. Its winning formula includes superb customer service, popular subscription deals, great book clubs and school supply. This is a small bookshop that punches way above its weight in Ireland.\n\nImagine Me Stories\n\nOnline\n\nA monthly subscription box set up to promote black children's literature, Imagine Me is one of the most inspiring new children’s booksellers of recent years. Founder Keisha Ehigie has helped fill a glaring gap in representation and worked tirelessly on outreach to primary schools, marketing to parents and the creation of black history resources.\n\nNext Page Books\n\nHitchin\n\nThree years after opening in Hitchin, Next Page Books is shortlisted for this award for the first time. Storytimes and events are popular, and the shop’s indefatigable founders work with schools to curate diverse and accessible library collections and bookfairs. Its focus on neurodiversity and inclusion makes it a special place for children and parents.\n\nSevenoaks Bookshop\n\nSevenoaks\n\nThis Kent independent is a local institution that has welcomed generations of children since the 1940s. It engages readers of all ages through talks, workshops, subscription services, peer book reviews and much more. Inclusivity and representation are at the heart of everything, and there is a particular focus on autism and dyslexia.\n\nThe Children's Bookshop\n\nMuswell Hill, London\n\nMuswell Hill’s Children’s Bookshop turns 50 in 2024 but remains as youthful and energetic as ever. Adding new book clubs and a creative writing course in 2023, it has a special place in the hearts of writers and publishers, attracting big names including David Walliams and Julia Donaldson. “You can feel the love vividly at work,” said one author.\n\nWaterstones\n\nUK\n\nWaterstones, joint winner of last year’s award, revamped its children’s buying team to good effect last year. It ran superb marketing and events for top-flight children’s brand names, and its promotions and awards continue to be transformative for lesser-known authors and illustrators. “They demonstrate the power of passion and creativity,” said one grateful publisher.\n\nWonderland Bookshop\n\nRetford\n\nRetford’s independent battled to overcome the effects of the cost-of-living crisis, rent hikes and flooding in 2023. As with all the indies on this list, it does much more than sell books, acting as a safe and non-judgemental space that all children and families can enjoy. A pay-it-forward scheme and pupil premium book fair showed its commitment to inclusion.\n\nChildren's Publisher of the Year\n\nAfter several boom years, children’s book sales in the trade weakened slightly in 2023. Nevertheless, these publishers – a nice balance of independents and groups – all had excellent years, carving out new sales opportunities across the market. While there were plenty of frontlist hits, for many of them the year was more notable for backlist sales – whether books revived by TikTok or brands stretching back many years. Publishers also made good progress on diversity in all its forms in 2023, both through output and in-house.\n\nWinner\n\nBloomsbury Children’s Books\n\nSix years after its last outing on this shortlist (to be fair it has not always submitted in this period), Bloomsbury burst back from a substantial restructure with a superb 2023.\n\nIt had strength right across the age groups, from big picture-book brands such as Martha Mumford's The Bunny Adventures, to middle­-grade stars including Kalynn Bayron, to Young Adult leaders such as Sarah J Maas. Underpinning everything, as it has done for more than 25 years, was J K Rowling's Harry Potter mega-brand, which earned TCM sales of nearly £9m from a range of more than 100 different editions, including the Wizarding Almanac, developed in-house and the subject of the publisher's biggest ever social media campaign. There were plenty of impactful debuts as well - notably from Zoulfa Katouh and Lex Croucher.\n\nHowever, the standout of the year was undoubtedly Katherine Rundell's Impossible Creatures, a six-figure TCM seller and Waterstones· Book of the Year. It was reward for Bloomsbury's brilliant campaigns and sustained support of Rundell, Author of the Year at the 2024 British Book Awards.\n\nDiversity was a notable theme of the children's team's 2023, with a wider range of authors and illustrators than ever before and good work on Atinuke and Kingsley Nebechi's Brilliant Black British History in particular. So too was sustainability, including through carbon footprint measuring and staff training.\n\nIt also showed excellent author care. \"It has all the detail, care and focus of a small publisher, allied to the weight and ambition of a large one ... there's nowhere I'd rather be,\" said one writer. \"Bloomsbury has bucked the trend in a tricky market,\" added the judges. \"There is a lot of energy about it again ... it's a great story of all-round publishing success.\"\n\nThe Shortlist\n\nBloomsbury Children's Books\n\nBloomsbury is back on the shortlist after six years away. After reinvigorating its team it excelled across the board in 2023, though Katherine Rundell’s Impossible Creatures, Waterstones’ Book of the Year, was the standout. In the background, J K Rowling’s Harry Potter books racked up another £9m of TCM sales.\n\nDavid Fickling Books\n\nDavid Fickling’s eponymous list had a stunning year, with sales rocketing 73% in the TCM, where it is now five times bigger than five years ago. Jamie Smart’s Bunny vs Monkey series had a lot to do with that, but there was much more besides, including S F Said’s multi-award-winning Tyger.\n\nHachette Children's Group\n\nYears of work to pull together Hachette’s disparate imprints and acquisitions into a united unit paid off handsomely in 2023. Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper hit number one and there were big sales across the backlist, especially from Enid Blyton. Globally, the rights and licensing team had a record year.\n\nMacmillan Children's Books\n\nA third of Macmillan’s children’s revenue in 2023 came from Julia Donaldson, the TCM’s top-selling author for the fourth year in a row. But as usual it had huge strength in depth, from big pre-school brands including Rod Campbell to Pari Thompson’s Blackwell’s Children’s Book of the Year Greenwild.\n\nOneworld\n\nOneworld is shortlisted for its YA imprint Rock the Boat, which had another remarkable year. It owes a lot to TikTok, which has powered Kathleen Glasgow’s Girl in Pieces and Amber Smith’s The Way I Used to Be. Hits from its small but focused and diverse frontlist included Josh Silver’s LGBTQ+ thriller HappyHead.\n\nScholastic\n\nScholastic had its best ever year in the TCM, bursting back into the list of top 10 publishers with 9.2% growth. Like Macmillan it benefited hugely from Julia Donaldson. Suzanne Collins was a second big contributor on the back of a film adaptation, and Dav Pilkey had yet another good year.\n\nSimon & Schuster Children's Books\n\nLast year’s winner didn’t rest on its laurels in 2023, creating new imprints Gallery Kids and Gallery YA. It had nearly 100 category top 10s, with stars including Sue Hendra and Paul Linnet’s Supertato in picture books and Lauren Roberts’ Powerless in YA. There was a biggest ever haul of book prizes and shortlist places too.\n\nSweet Cherry Publishing\n\nSweet Cherry has done more than most to improve diversity and accessibility in publishing, and in 2023 it launched Every Cherry, a new special educational needs and disabilities imprint. Elsewhere its focus on box sets and global licensing delivered stellar growth domestically and internationally.\n\nUsborne\n\nPeter Usborne’s passing last March brought an outpouring of admiration and affection from across publishing. The company he leaves behind is in better shape than ever, posting record TCM sales in its 50th anniversary year. An 11th consecutive year on this shortlist is testament to its unstinting excellence under Peter.\n\nPublicity Campaign of the Year\n\nSupported by the Publishers’ Publicity Circle\n\nThis shortlist is made up of ten campaigns honoured in various genre categories at the Publishers’ Publicity Circle’s annual awards—described by The Bookseller’s Caroline Sanderson, chair of judges, as “demonstrating a wealth of creativity, tenacity, flexibility, affability, diplomacy, sensitivity and a ton of hard graft.” These talented publicists, most of whom appear at The British Book Awards for the first time, created campaigns that started conversations, took great care of authors and helped their publishers beat all sales forecasts.\n\nWinner\n\nEtty Eastwood\n\nUltra-Processed People by Chris van Tulleken\n\nCornerstone\n\nCornerstone and Etty Eastwood win this award for the unmissable publicity that was generated by Ultra-Processed People by Chris van Tulleken pictured, one of the most talked about books of 2023.\n\nThe campaign made superb use of an articulate and media-savvy author. It started months out from release by creating a buzz among TV and radio producers and journalists, then found a very good hook-the little-known ingredients and baking processes of mass-produced bread­to grab the attention of the public. Dozens of reviews, features, interviews, events and festival appearances followed. After publication, it moved into sustain mode, filling in the gaps in media coverage from the first round of PR. Especially high-profile slots included \"The One Show\", \"Good Morning Britain\" and \"Channel 4 News\", which all generated huge spikes in sales within minutes\n\nUltra-Processed People was far from a cert for the bestseller lists, and Cornerstone's first print run was only a few thousand. But it became a fixture in the hardback non-fiction charts, and TCM sales were well over 100,000 by the end of 2023. Perhaps even more impressively, its audiobook numbers reached six figures too, boosted by the numerous radio and podcast appearances that Eastwood arranged.
