        "text": "Fostering a culture of innovation\n\nÂ\n\nIn 2015, to strengthen the role innovation plays in its growth strategy, Hachette Livre launched the Hachette Innovation Program (HIP), which became the Business Development and Innovation Department in 2021. The Department aims to identify new growth opportunities â both organic and external â and research investments that could be relevant to the Groupâs development. It also provides support for the imprintsâ development and diversification plans. In 2022, to nurture the Groupâs culture of innovation and experimentation, the Department launched the first Innovation Challenge open to employees all over the world.\n\nÂ\n\nSupporting innovation in education\n\nHachette Livre uses the possibilities created by digital technologies to enhance the tools and resources available to pupils and teachers in primary and secondary schools as well as in higher education. The Group supports evolving teaching practices via a range of innovative initiatives gathered under the umbrella of the e-Education Department as well as a partnership with Educapital and the acquisition of key players like Livrescolaire.fr.\n\nMaking content accessible to the widest possible audience\n\nHachette Livre is constantly expanding the content it makes available to people who are prevented from reading or who encounter obstacles to reading. A fervent believer in interoperability, Hachette Livre is involved in defining and updating open standards for technology.\n\nThe adult divisions at Hachette UK are: Orion, Little, Brown Book Group, John Murray Press, Hodder & Stoughton, Headline, Quercus, Bookouture, Octopus, Laurence King, John Catt and Illuminate. Hachette Childrenâs Group publishes a wide range of books for children of all ages, and Hodder Education is a leader in the teaching resources market. Hachette UK diversified its business with the acquisition of Paperblanks, the global number two in premium stationery. Hachette UK is the market leader in the ebook segment as well, and has subsidiaries in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and India.\n\nHBG is a leading trade publishing group in the United States. Its 43 imprints publish around 2,100 books a year in the adult segment as well as 500 childrenâs and YA books and 750 audio book titles. They also maintain an extensive ebook catalogue. HBG is made up of eight editorial divisions: Little, Brown and Company, Grand Central Publishing, Perseus Books, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, Hachette Nashville, Orbit, Workman Publishing and Hachette Audio.\n\nFor authors\n\nâMon Espace Auteurâ: accessible, everyday support\n\nThis portal provides authors with 24/7 access to resources that make their lives easier, such as real-time sales figures for their books. Hachette Livre and its publishers are committed to providing digital tools and services for their authors to ensure total transparency. âMon Espace Auteurâ is fully in line with that goal. It is yet another tool our publishers can use to build close partnerships with their authors.\n\nFor booksellers\n\nHachette Pro: a professional platform for booksellers\n\nTo provide a high-performance service for bookshops and their teams, Hachette Livre designed a professional website suited to the frequently changing industry. Hachette Pro embodies Hachette Livreâs attitude toward professional booksellers, who play a crucial role in promoting its books and building authorsâ reputations. It reflects the Groupâs commitment to providing them with the best possible support since they are on the front lines with readers."
