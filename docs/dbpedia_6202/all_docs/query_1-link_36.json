        "text": "THE COMPANY\n\nWHAT IS TKO?\n\nSince 2018, TKO Studios has published some of the industry’s most critically acclaimed graphic novels by top creators. Recently, it also introduced illustrated novels by multiple New York Times bestsellers. With 9 Amazon #1 bestsellers and dozens of titles, TKO’s goal is to widen out the readership of comic books, as well as become the industry’s first vertically integrated studio by publishing books and shepherding those projects by producing and financing film and TV adaptations. Fans should look forward to more great titles from TKO as well as blockbuster film and TV projects based on our incredible library of books.\n\nWHY DO SOME BOOKS SAY TKO PRESENTS AND SOME SAY TKO ROGUE?\n\nTKO Presents is our imprint for graphic novels and TKO Rogue is our imprint for illustrated fiction. They both exist under the larger banner of TKO Studios, which also represents our media endeavors.\n\nDO YOU ACCEPT UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS FROM WRITERS AND ARTISTS?\n\nIf you have a graphic novel you want to pitch to TKO, send it via email to info@tkopresents.com. We regret that we won’t be able to respond to each pitch individually.\n\nI’M A BUYER FOR A COMIC SHOP. HOW DO I GET TKO STUDIOS TITLES INTO MY STORE?\n\nThere are two ways to purchase TKO books for your comic shop – retailers can buy from us directly by visiting the Vendor Order Form for 50% off the SRP and free shipping in the US. Or, if you prefer to have all your orders in the same place, you can also order TKO Studios books through Diamond Comic Distributors.\n\nI’M NOT A BUYER FOR A COMIC SHOP. WHERE CAN I BUY TKO STUDIOS BOOKS?\n\nYou’re already in the right place! Our webstore is currently the best place to find all TKO Studios products, but our books are also available in over 600 comic shops worldwide as well as on Amazon and digitally on GlobalComix.\n\nDO YOU ACCEPT REQUESTS FOR REVIEW OR EXAM COPIES?\n\nYes! For any media inquiries and requests for review copies (including the educational market) or to inquire about our influencer program, please email info@tkopresents.com.\n\nTHE STORE\n\nWHAT IS YOUR RETURNS POLICY?\n\nWe accept returns on all items within 30 days of purchase providing they are returned in saleable condition or photographic evidence is provided of damages incurred during shipping and handling. Damaged orders will be replaced or refunded within two weeks of confirmation. Customers are responsible for shipping on non-damaged returns.\n\nSHIPPING IS EXPENSIVE! WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?\n\nShipping around the world has gone up significantly in recent years. In order to try and mitigate some of those costs, we offer Economy shipping for a flat rate of $4.99 on all US orders under 5lbs and US orders over $50 ship free!\n\nDO YOU SHIP OUTSIDE THE US?\n\nWe do! However the costs of international shipping are outside of our control. We regret that we cannot offer free shipping on international orders at this time.\n\nWHEN CAN I EXPECT MY ORDER?\n\nTKO’s warehouse is a small operation at the mercy of the USPS and other carriers. If you selected our Economy shipping option, you should receive your order within 2-8 business days.*\n\nIf you haven’t received a shipping confirmation after 3 business days, please follow up by emailing fulfillment@tkopresents.com.\n\n* Please note that if you select UPS but provide a P.O. Box for delivery, a USPS option will be substituted."
