        "text": "Draw from a community with publishing power\n\nComics culture continues to flourish in San Francisco, and CCA is home to a well-established graduate program in Comics. Our faculty are immersed in the scene, from helping launch the first San Francisco Comics Fest to leading entire publishing imprints dedicated to cartoonists of color and queer storytellers. Our alumni have contributed important works to the collective dialogue, including Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer: A Memoir and Alex Combs’s forthcoming Trans History: A Graphic Novel. In short, we’re changing the types of stories told across the medium.\n\nAs the only undergraduate program like it on the West Coast, CCA’s BFA in Comics prepares you to enter the professional comics industry. You’ll become immersed in a curriculum that engages with the ethical, historical, and social dimensions of the world beyond the college, helping you develop a critical capacity and a singular artistic practice. View an anthology of comics at CCA.\n\nComics faculty have significant professional industry experience and are at the forefront of the creative and intellectual discourse of this vital and emerging storytelling medium. The comics field is inherently multidisciplinary, and the program’s curriculum thrives through collaboration with faculty from a range of adjacent disciplines across the college, including writing, animation, and illustration. With an all-star faculty as your guide, you’ll have unique opportunities to explore different dimensions of your personal comics practice.\n\nComic art as a discipline continues to evolve. We look for students who are excited about the transformative power of visual storytelling on communities, as well as individual lives. Ideal applicants are open to learning interdisciplinary practices to enhance their ideas, and eager to experiment with the craft. CCA Comics students—immersed in the rich potential of the medium in a city renowned for its creative powers—will gain skills to shape the world of comics and visual storytelling for years to come."
