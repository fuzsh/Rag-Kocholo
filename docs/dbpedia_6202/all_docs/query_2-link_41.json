        "text": "BIDDEFORD, Maine (WMTW) - In Maine, the University of New England is celebrating dozens of new additions.\n\nA rare orange lobster gave birth to more orange lobsters, and now students will have the opportunity to study something new.\n\nLast year, the University of New England welcomed “Peaches,” the orange-colored lobster.\n\n“Those orange lobsters are pretty rare in itself. And supposedly there’s about one in 30 million of finding an orange lobster, but rarely we find any egg-bearing females,” said Markus Frederich, a professor at the University of New England.\n\nNow Peaches, along with Norma, a normal-colored lobster, have both given birth to about 140 tiny baby lobsters.\n\n“It’s so exciting. Every day coming in here and I’m on the verge of tears,” one student, Ruby Motulsky, said. “I’m discovering new information that no one else has ever seen or heard of.”\n\nThis offspring allows faculty and students at UNE to study the genetic basis behind these lobsters, and their rare coloration.\n\n“Now we have them while they develop from those different larval stages. They start tiny and then molt multiple times into various different shapes and sizes,” Frederich said. “That gives us so many more options to study what makes them orange and why and how they’re different from the regular-colored lobster.”\n\nAnd this research doesn’t end with Peaches and her orange babies. Another orange lobster, Pineapple, is also carrying eggs.\n\n“And now by surprise, we have a second once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with Pineapple also carrying eggs, which will hatch next June,” Frederich said.\n\nWith new rare opportunities that researchers hope will inspire the next generation.\n\nLast month a rare orange lobster was caught off the coast of Canada, and accidentally delivered to a Red Lobster in Colorado.\n\nIt has since been rehomed to an aquarium."
