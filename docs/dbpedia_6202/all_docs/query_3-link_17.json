        "text": "Global games publisher and distributor Asmodee unveiled a new fiction imprint, Aconyte, to publish novels based on its popular game properties.\n\nAconyte will be part of Asmodee’s Entertainment platform, which was formed last year to capitalize on the publisher’s wealth of intellectual properties by developing them for other formats including films and TV, merchandise, novels and more (see “Asmodee Launches Entertainment Division.”). Anonyte will publish novels based on a selection of Asmodee’s game properties, as well as actively pursing licenses for third-party tie-in fiction. The first of the third-party agreements is currently in the contract stage. The imprint will begin a monthly publication schedule in summer 2020.\n\nAsmodee has hired Marc Gascoigne, former publisher of Angry Robot, who also ran Games Workshop’s Black Library, and Fighting Fantasy gamebooks. He has hired Lottie Llwewlyn-Wells as assistant editor, and Nick Tyler as Publishing Coordinator. The imprint’s offices are in Nottingham, England.\n\n“Asmodee’s stated mission is to bring the world ‘Great Games, Amazing Stories,’ said Andy Jones, head of Asmodee Entertainment. “Aconyte is another key milestone along that path, literally creating those amazing stories and bringing further depth, intrigue, characters, and narrative to some of the best game worlds ever created.”"
