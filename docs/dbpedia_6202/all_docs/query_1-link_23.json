        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nI say it is both Fawcett and Quality in the same boat and that's I like them both for their own artistic and written value. I don't have a favorite but both of these companies are top notch and that's why I say this - both of them were the gems of the Golden Age of Comics.\n\nPost by shaxper on\n\nIn that case, if the issue is importance, then I can make two arguments:\n\n1. Fawcett -- Captain Marvel was, for a time, the biggest superhero of the Golden Age. The only reason Fawcett isn't still dominating the industry today was because of DC's underhanded legal practices. They managed to run Fawcett out of business for allegedly copying Superman when, in fact, most of Superman's powers as we now know them were manifested by Captain Marvel first. Don't forget the immensely successful movie serial either.\n\n2. Dell -- When comics otherwise would have been in serious decline post-WW II, Dell was the company that kept the medium alive with exciting licensed characters and features, snazzy subscription plans, and a wide variety of genres for people to choose from. Dell was the undisputed king by the 1950s, only losing ground once the Silver Age of superheroes came around.\n\nPost by tingramretro on\n\nNot being American, I'm going for \"other\", and \"other\" in this case means DC Thomson Ltd of Dundee, one of the world's oldest comics publishers, and one that's still around today. Why are they important? Well, DC Thomson were (and are) the publishers of two of the world's most enduring comics, Beano and Dandy, two juvenile humour titles which began in the 1930s, and during World War II, despite the fact that paper was strictly rationed, those two comics kept on being continuously published and their creators used them to boost the morale of a Britain under seige by relentlessly mocking Adolf Hitler and the Nazis; so much so, in fact, that one of their most notable cartoonists, Dudey D. Watkins, actually ended up on a list of \"enemies of the third reich\" and would probably have been executed if Germany had won the war!\n\nPost by shaxper on\n\nNot being American, I'm going for \"other\", and \"other\" in this case means DC Thomson Ltd of Dundee, one of the world's oldest comics publishers, and one that's still around today.

I knew none of this.\n\nDistressingly few people do, these days. But these comics did a lot to keep British kids' spirits up at a very frightening time (and more than a few adults, too). Among the more overt attacks on the Axis powers were two now infamous comedy strips, Addy and Hermy-the Nasty Nazis, which basically ridiculed Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering, and Musso the Wop-he's a big-a-da-flop! which did the same to Mussolini.\n\nPost by MDG on\n\nI went with \"other\" meaning Dell. Fawcett was important in showing that lightning could strike twice (no pun intended) and there was room for more than one \"top of the heap\" superhero, but Dell, with its familiar cartoon and newspaper strip characters and wide distribution was probably the company most responsible for getting comics into American homes.\n\nPost by Slam_Bradley on\n\nI went with \"other\" meaning Dell.

Dell Comics were omnipresent in households from their inception through the split with Whitman. Of the comics that my Mom remembered from her youth they were all either Dell or another contender MLJ/Archie.\n\nObviously if it was just based on their super-hero output MLJ wouldn't rate much of a nod. But Archie and his progeny were a huge force in Comics. The other comic my Mom always remember was Katy Keene, the Pin-Up Queen. Archie was a huge presence and a big influence.\n\nDepending on how you define the \"Golden Age\" you can make a very strong case for EC. I would argue that Mad Comic/Magazine had a greater impact on our culture than almost any other comic.\n\nPost by tingramretro on\n\nI went with \"other\" meaning Dell.
