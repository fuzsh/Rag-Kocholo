Other members of the Justice Society: Bart Regan, Doris West, Zatara, the Spectre, and Gabby.\n\nThe Minnesota Heroes Campaign\n\nThe world is at war and heroes are on the front lines...but what happens to the heroes left at home? It's 1943 and a small group of would-be heroes gather in Minneapolis to decide what they can contribute on the home front.\n\nBlue Box JSA Cafe Campaign\n\nThis board archives the epic campaign that was run in an Elgin cafe on Monday nights."
