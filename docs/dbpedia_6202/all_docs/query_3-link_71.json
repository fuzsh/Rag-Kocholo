        "text": "The comic book industry – much like the wider pop culture machine it exists within – owes a greater debt of gratitude to its female talent than it typically acknowledges. So, this International Women’s Day, I’d like to profile one of the most influential figures in comic book history: former Vertigo editor Karen Berger.\n\nWho is Karen Berger?\n\nAfter graduating from Brooklyn College with a dual major in English literature and art history in 1979, Karen Berger joined DC Comics as an assistant editor. Although she was initially assigned conventional superhero books – her first gig was working alongside future DC president Paul Levitz on The Legion of Superheroes – Berger gravitated more towards the publisher’s line of horror comics. So, it wasn’t long before she traded the bright-eyed, futuristic optimism of Legion for the Gothic trappings of the anthology title, House of Mystery.\n\nHer tenure overseeing House of Mystery established Karen’s knack for bringing out the best in DC’s darker books, paving the way for her taking over as editor on another horror-infused property, Swamp Thing, in 1984. Teaming up with legendary British writer Alan Moore – the scribe behind Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and other acclaimed works – Berger helped to redefine what mainstream comics could be. Berger gave Moore and artists such as Jon Totleben and Rick Veitch carte blanche to radically reinterpret the titular plant monster’s history.\n\nShe also encouraged them to explore mature content and themes, with one particularly memorable issue serving as an extended meditation on depression). the result was a runaway sales success.\n\nAt around the same time, Berger also recruited another Brit, Neil Gaiman (of Good Omens and American Gods fame) to reimagine obscure 70s superhero the Sandman as an adult-oriented horror/fantasy title. Like Swamp Thing, The Sandman soon found a devoted audience, and (along with several other comics shepherded by Berger, including Grant Morrison’s Animal Man and Doom Patrol) led to the formation of Berger’s most lasting contribution to the comics medium: the Vertigo imprint.\n\nLaunched in 1993, Vertigo was a place for comics’ unique voices to tell stories that didn’t belong alongside the conventional “cape and tights” books that were (and largely still are) the bread and butter of DC and its rival, Marvel. Until she stepped down in 2013, Berger and Vertigo’s dedicated editorial team toiled away in their own private storytelling garden, cultivating ground-breaking hits such as Preacher, Y: The Last Man, 100 Bullets, Fables, The Invisibles and more.\n\nSo yeah, Karen Berger is kinda a big deal.\n\nOne of modern comics’ most underappreciated architects\n\nI’m not alone in thinking that Karen Berger’s achievements should be celebrated, either. Berger’s been inducted into the Comics Hall of Fame, won three Eisners (think Oscars, only for the comics industry) and an Ink Pot Award, and had the market cornered on Comics Buyer’s Guide’s “Favorite Editor” category for eight consecutive years. So, she’s no stranger to praise.\n\nEven so, Berger remains one of comics’ unsung heroes; someone who doesn’t get namechecked enough whenever the key players in the modern era of comics are discussed. Yet Berger was nevertheless a driving force in elevating the artistic standard of mainstream comics by giving countless writers and artists their big break. What’s more, by allowing them to craft stories that put creative expression ahead of purely commercial concerns, she presaged the steady shift away from superhero comics as the medium’s dominant genre.\n\nBerger was instrumental in changing the entire business landscape of the comic book industry, as well. Notably, she integrated the principles of creator ownership into DC’s otherwise staunchly “work for hire” model, both directly or indirectly (famously, when Gaiman decided to call time on Sandman with #75, another writer wasn’t appointed to continue the lucrative series, despite DC owning the character).\n\nSure, Image Comics rightly deserves the lion’s share of praise when it comes to the creator-owned revolution of the mid-90s, but Berger’s participation shouldn’t be ignored. On the contrary, if the rumour mill is to be believed, her departure from Vertigo (and the imprint’s eventual demise) was at least partly motivated by corporate displeasure at the generous contracts she offered creators.\n\nAnd then there’s the part Berger played in the rise of trade paperbacks in the retail market. Collected editions of comic books existed long before Vertigo, but during Berger’s time at the helm, these were produced regularly and, crucially, they were kept in print. Aside from making Vertigo’s back catalogue more readily accessible to new readers, it also made the imprint’s comics an easier sell to bookstores. This in turn broadened Vertigo’s prospective audience – something the wider comics industry took note of and quickly emulated.\n\nToday, sales of trade paperbacks have largely overtaken those of monthly periodicals. Indeed, several of the highest-selling titles only exist in standalone graphic novel format, and it’s largely due to the pioneering efforts of Berger and Vertigo.\n\nHow did Karen Berger change comics?\n\nSo how did Karen Berger do it? It’s simple. She championed intelligent, challenging storytelling that wore the label “weird” as a badge of honour, and proved there was room for quirky material targeted at a diverse audience of older readers. She advocated on behalf of creators, treating them as valued collaborators and not simply hired guns, and created a space where they could share their stories free of censorship or editorial interference. Plus, she was just plain smart – seeing the long-term value in trade paperbacks long before many of her peers.\n\nAnd best of all, Berger’s still at it. These days, she’s in charge of her own imprint at Dark Horse Comics (the aptly-named Berger Books), where she continues to do what she does best: curating a daring, varied line of off-beat titles produced by new and established creators that pushes the boundaries of sequential art.\n\nKaren Berger isn’t finished changing the comic book industry just yet – and we’re all the luckier for it."
