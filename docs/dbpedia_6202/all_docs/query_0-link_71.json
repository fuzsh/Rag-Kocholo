        "text": "General Introduction\n\nThis guide provides information about usage of the more common or “core” data elements from the MARC 21 bibliographic format, as well as required elements. It also provides information about using RDA in MARC 21 records.\n\nDocumentation describing the MARC 21 bibliographic format in depth is available online, as is a complete list of MARC 21 data elements. A brief description and tutorial called Understanding MARC Bibliographic is also available.\n\nInformation about RDA is available on the Library's Resource Description and Access (RDA) page.\n\nWhat is a MARC Record?\n\nA MARC record is a collection of textual data formatted in a way that follows the requirements of the ISO 2709 standard developed by libraries for sharing bibliographic data. Usually a separate MARC record is created for each bibliographic entity. Multiple MARC records are stored and transmitted in files. There is no limit to the number of MARC records that can be in a single file. Most MARC records contain between 800 and 1,500 characters, but can be shorter or longer.\n\nMARC Fields, Subfields and Indicators\n\nInformation in a MARC record is divided into fields referred to by three-digit numbers called tags. For example, the field tag for the title of a book is “245”. Most MARC fields begin with two character positions called indicators and are then usually divided into subfields that are identified either by lower-case letters of the alphabet or single digits (0 to 9). For example, the main title of a book is in subfield “a” in field 245, while the remainder of the title goes in subfield “b”. Because these lower-case letters of the alphabet can be confused with letters from words in the bibliographic data, a special control character called a delimiter always precedes a MARC subfield code. In this document the character “$” (the dollar sign) is used to represent the subfield delimiter. Please note that the delimiter is not really a graphic character. Other characters may be used to represent it.\n\nThe only exception to the pattern of tag, two indicator positions, and at least one subfield occurs in MARC fields with tags that begin with “00” (fields 000 through 009). These special fields do not have indicators or subfield codes and are usually defined as having a fixed number of character positions in them. For example, field 008 must always have 40 characters in it. Here are some examples of MARC fields.\n\n=245 10$aHistory of Africa :$bfrom early man to modern times /$cby John Dough & Mary Smith.\n\n=264 \\1$aColumbia, S.C. :$bH.W. Williams Co.,$c1982.\n\n=700 1\\$aSmith, Mary.\n\n=008 010226s2001\\\\\\\\||||||||||||||\\|eng\\d\n\nNotes:\n\nAn “=” (equal sign) in front of each field signals the start of a new field.\n\nThe blank spaces between the MARC tag and the rest of the field is to enhance readability.\n\nThe character “\\” (the reverse solidus or “backslash”) is used to represent the spaces that sometimes occupy indicator positions at the beginning of a MARC field or in a fixed field.\n\nThe first two examples of MARC fields have more than one subfield. The third example has only one subfield. The last example, a field beginning with “00” has no indicators or subfields.\n\nThe fill character “|” is for unused spaces in field 008 (since it must always be 40 characters long). Fill characters cannot be used in indicator positions.\n\nCataloging Rules\n\nAn often overlooked aspect of using the MARC format is that the creation of cataloging records is usually governed by the application of cataloging rules, that can often be more complex and more difficult to master than the MARC format itself. This guide incorporates some of the most basic cataloging rules that should be followed for the creation of basic MARC records.\n\nThe Resource Description and Access (RDA) standard has been followed in the recommendations presented in this guide as much as is possible. RDA, like most other important cataloging standards rules and MARC, fully incorporates the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) conventions, developed by the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). Since RDA rules incorporate ISBD principles they are compatible with many other cataloging rules.\n\nInclusion of ISBD punctuation in the cataloging data placed in a bibliographic record is an important part of MARC 21 compliance. This and some other aspects of good and bad MARC practices will be emphasized in this guide. It is strongly urged that you follow recommended proper cataloging practices when creating bibliographic data that will be shared in the MARC format.\n\nRequired Cataloging Information\n\nIn order to meet the minimum requirements of the cataloging rules that libraries follow, certain data elements must be provided in every MARC record. These elements are listed below. The first column contains the common name of each data element. The second column contains the standard MARC content designator (tag, subfield code, etc.) used in a MARC record to identify the data element. The third column contains a code that identifies the data type. The data types are “A” (for alphabetic), “N” (for numeric), and “A/N” (for alphanumeric).\n\nThe last column contains the required lengths for certain data elements.\n\nRequired data elements in a MARC record Data Element Name MARC Tag Type Required Length Record type 000/06 A 1 Bibliographic level 000/07 A 1 Control number 001 A/N System identifier 003 A Date/Time Last Transaction 005 N 16 Date of creation 008/00-05 N 6 Type of publication date 008/06 A 1 Date 1 008/07-10 N 4 Date 2 (if applicable) 008/11-14 A/N 4 Country of publication code 008/15-17 A 3 Language of publication code 008/35-37 A 3 ISBN (if applicable 020$az A/N Cataloging Source 040$a$c A Name field (if applicable) 100 or 110 or 111 A/N Main title 245$a A/N Place of production, publication, distribution, manufacture 264$a A/N Name of producer, publisher, distributor, manufacturer 264$b A/N Date of production, publication, distribution, manufacture, or copyright notice 264$c A/N Extent 300$a A/N Size 300$c A/N Content Type 336$a or $b and $2 A Media Type 337$a or $b and $2 A Carrier Type 338$a or $b and $2 A Series Statement (if applicable) 490$a, x and v A/N Local field(s) for acquisitions/invoice data ** 9XX A/N\n\n** A 9XX field is not required by the MARC 21 format but is a necessary field for the Library of Congress. The field(s) should contain a formatted date, an invoice number and the vendor's MARC organization code.\n\nOptional Cataloging Information\n\nPlease note that the data elements above are the required minimum elements and every MARC record must include them. However, most MARC records contain more than these eighteen elements. The most common optional MARC elements are in the table that follows.\n\nSome of the optional fields in MARC are used for materials other than textual materials. The type of material for which a specific field is appropriate is mentioned in the detailed description of the field.\n\nCommon optional data elements in a MARC record Data Element Name MARC Tag Type ISSN 022$ay A/N Other Standard Identifier 024$a A/N Publisher number 028$ab A/N Language codes 041$ah A/N Remainder of title (if needed) 245$b A/N Responsibility statement 245$c A/N Variant title 246$ia A/N Edition number (if needed) 250$a A/N Musical presentation statement 254$a A/N Cartographic mathematical data 255$a A/N Current publication frequency 310$a A/N Dates of publication and/or sequential designation 362$a A/N General note 500$a A/N Summary, etc. 520$a A/N Subject-Personal name 600$abcqdx A/N Subject-Corporate name 610$abx A/N Subject-Meeting name 611$andcx A/N Subject-Uniform title 630$ax A/N Subject-Topical term 650$ax A/N Subject-Geographic name 651$ax A/N Added entry-Personal name 700$abcqd A/N Added entry-Corporate name 710$ab A/N Added entry-Meeting name 711$andc A/N\n\nDescriptions of MARC Data Elements\n\nThe following section provides additional information about each MARC element listed in the two tables above.\n\nThe descriptions of each MARC element include information about RDA rules used to create basic MARC records. The rules explain: 1) where information is to be taken from; 2) how it should be transcribed in the MARC field; and: 3) what special punctuation and spacing (if any) is required. Please note that not every subfield in some fields will be listed. More detailed information about MARC bibliographic data elements is available from the MARC Standards web site.\n\nLeader and Control Fields (0XX)\n\n01X-09X: Number and Code Fields\n\n1XX: Main Entry Fields\n\n20X-24X: Title and Title-Related Fields\n\n25X-28X: Edition, Imprint, Etc., Fields\n\n3XX: Physical Description, Etc. Fields\n\nSeries Fields\n\n5XX: Notes\n\n6XX: Subject Access Fields\n\n7XX: Added Entries\n\n9XX: Local Fields\n\nLeader and Control Fields (00X)\n\nLeader - REQUIRED\n\nThe first four required MARC elements are one-character codes located at positions 06, 07, 17 and 18 in the field called the record Leader or Field 000. This field is fixed in length: it must always contain 24 characters. (Note: These positions are counted from 00 to 23.)\n\nSince you must only select the correct value for the positions listed above, the remaining 20 character positions contain specific default values that can be supplied automatically as part of the template used when a MARC record is created. Although only the required positions in the leader are described here, all 24 positions are shown in the example since they must all be present in a record. If the value for any position is omitted, it changes the placement of positions which follow it.\n\nExample:\n\n=000 00000nam\\\\22000005i\\4500\n\n000/06 (Record type)\n\nThe type of material described by the MARC record is identified in field 000, position 06 (Record type). Since this value is very important, some MARC users may decide to create different templates for different types of material to control the coding of field 000 if appropriate.\n\nThere are multiple codes that can be used in 000/06; the most common are listed below (for a complete list see here. Most vendors will probably use “a” (for textual materials such as books and serials) most of the time.\n\nValues for 000/06 Code Meaning a Language material (text) c Notated music e Cartographic material (maps, atlases)\n\n000/07 (Bibliographic level)\n\nCharacter position 07 in field 000 is used to indicate whether the item described in the MARC record is a monograph, serial, collection, or part of a larger item. The most common value used is code “m” (monograph). Code “s” is used for serials (periodicals) of any material type. For a complete list see here. Note: Titles in monographic series are coded as monographs, not serials.\n\nValues for 000/007 Code Meaning m Monograph s Serial (periodical)\n\n000/17 (Encoding level)\n\nA one-character alphanumeric code that indicates the fullness of the bibliographic information and/or content designation of the MARC record. “5” (Partial (preliminary) level) is the desired value.\n\n000/18 (Descriptive cataloging form)\n\nA one-character code that indicates characteristics of the descriptive data in the record through reference to cataloging norms. This position should contain the value “i” (ISBD punctuation included).\n\nField 001 (Control Number) - REQUIRED\n\nEvery MARC record created by vendor must have a unique control number. This number is recorded in field 001. Any style of number may be used. Most MARC users generate numeric control numbers, often with an alphabetic prefix that is unique to the creator of the record.\n\nExamples:\n\n=001 lx2013039438\n\n=001 LAW85NQ022\n\nField 003 (Control Number Identifier) - REQUIRED\n\nField 003 contains a MARC organization code that identifies the source of the MARC record. The Library of Congress assigns the MARC organization code for all U.S. organizations and also for organizations in many other countries. Since different creators of MARC records might use the same numbers in field 001, field 003 is used in conjunction with field 001 to determine uniqueness. If you do not already have an official MARC organization code, you may request one online at //www.loc.gov/marc/organizations/.\n\nExamples:\n\n=003 CaSdMM\n\n=003 UK-LoURL\n\nField 005 (Date and Time of Latest Transaction) - REQUIRED\n\nField 005 contains a formatted date and time of the latest transaction (change) made in the MARC record. In new records, this is usually the date when the record was created. The data/time is always 16 characters long in the format: yyyymmddhhuuss.t where:\n\n“yyyy” is the 4-digit year\n\n“mm” is the two digit month, “dd” is the two digit day\n\n“hh” is the two digit hour (using the 24-hour clock)\n\n“uu”is the two-digit minute\n\n“ss” is the two-digit second\n\n“t” represents tenths of seconds\n\nMany MARC users are unable to give such an exact time for the creation of the record. If you are unable to precisely identify the time, zeros can be used for unknown portions. But it is important to supply at least the year/month/day portion with something other than zeros.\n\nExamples:\n\n=005 20130110024319.000000\n\n[formatted date/time that shows year/month/day/hour /minute/second/tenth of second]\n\n=005 20130110000000.000000\n\n[formatted date/time that shows year/month/day of latest transaction; the remainder of field contains 0s]\n\nField 008 (Fixed-Length Data Elements) - REQUIRED\n\nField 008 contains information about the item being cataloged, including codes for the country and language of the publication, the date the record was created, and the year(s) associated with the publication of the item.\n\nLike field 000, field 008 is positionally defined, which means that the codes must be placed at particular positions in the field. Field 008 is always 40 characters in length. These positions are numbered 00 to 39. Each position must contain a value, even if that value is a “blank”.\n\nWith vendor records only the coding for six data elements needs to be determined in field 008. Other elements may contain default values supplied in a template. Description and rules relating to the six data elements follow.\n\nRemember, if the value for any position is omitted, it changes the placement of positions which follow it, so care must be taken to always generate field 008 with all 40 positions. Otherwise the field will not correct. In the example below, the character “\\” represents a blank and the fill character “|” is used where no attempt was made to code the position.\n\nExample:\n\n=008 120314s2011\\\\\\\\fr\\||||||||||||||\\||fre\\\\\n\n[Field 008 in a record created March 13, 2012 for an item in French and published in France in 2011]\n\n008/00-05 (Date of creation)\n\nThe first six character positions in field 008 (positions 008/00 to 008/05) contain a formatted date that records when the record was created. The format of the date is: yymmdd where “yy” is the last two digits of the year, “mm” is the two-digit month, and “dd” is the two-digit day. Many MARC users allow the computer itself to supply this date when a record is created. Supplying the date of creation automatically depends on the sophistication of the system and/or template you are using for input. If possible, make a template that will allow the date to be supplied automatically.\n\n008/06 (Type of publication date)\n\nCharacter position 008/06 contains a one-letter code that identifies the kind of publication date(s) associated with the bibliographic item. The coding of this position is dependent on the kinds of dates recorded in positions 008/07-10 (Date 1) and 008/11-14 (Date 2). The table below lists the most common 008/06 codes and shows the relationship between the code in position 008/06 and the dates in positions 008/07-14.\n\nCoding values for 008/06 008/06 Name/meaning 008/07-10 (Date 1) 008/11-14 (Date 2) s Single year 4-digit year 4 blanks m Multiple years Beginning year of publication Ending year of publication r Reprint & original year of publication Reprint year of publication Original year of publication c Current periodical Beginning year of publication 9999 (latest possible year of publication)\n\nMost items are published in a single year, in which case 008/06 contains code “s”, 008/07-10 contains the year of publication, and 008/11-14 contains blanks. Even if an item does not have a publication date, a probable date of publication should be recorded in positions 008/07-10.\n\nUse of the other codes in 008/06 can make the coding of 008/07-14 more complicated. The most common situation is the need to record multiple years, such as when a publication is in more than one volume and the volumes are published in more than one year.\n\nThe thing to remember is that Date 1 is the earliest year, and Date 2 is the later year. The only exception to this is for reprints, where Date 1 is the year of publication of the reprint, and Date 2 is the year of publication of the original edition. Please note that new editions of a book are not treated as reprints by libraries. A true reprint is somewhat rare, and usually occurs when a new publisher reprints a book that has been unavailable for many years.\n\n008/07-10 (Date 1)\n\nThere should always be a 4-digit year in positions 008/07-10. It is generally the first or earliest date associated with the item. If no date appears on ana item, record a probable year of publication. For multipart items and serials, 008/07-10 contains the year that the first volume was published. If you are cataloging something other than the first volume, the date can be that of the volume in hand.\n\nThe date recorded in positions 008/07-10 has a relationship to the date recorded in field 264 (Production, Publication, Distribution, Manufacture, and Copyright Notice). This relationship will be explained in the description of field 264. The reason MARC requires a coded date in field 008 is that the coded representation of the date of publication in field 008 is standardized. This is important for the purposes of searching and retrieving items.\n\n008/11-14 (Date 2)\n\nWhen only one year is associated with a work, positions 008/11-14 contain blanks. If the item is published in more than one volume and more than one year is involved, 008/11-14 contains the last/ending year of publication. For serials that are still being published, the ending year is not known. In this case, 008/11-14 contains “9999” (representing the latest possible year.\n\n008/15-17 (Country of publication code)\n\nPositions 008/15-17 contain a 3-character MARC country code in lowercase Latin letters. In most cases, the country code is two alphabetic characters followed by a blank. Although many MARC users usually catalog publications from a single country, it is important to be able to modify the country code for publications from other countries.\n\n008/35-37 (Language of publication code)\n\nPositions 008/35-37 contain a 3-character MARC language code in lowercase Latin letters. The MARC language code list is online at //www.loc.gov/marc/languages/.\n\nIf a publication is in more than one language, 008/35-37 contains the code for the primary language of the item, usually that of the title. If the title itself is in more than one language, use the code for the official language of the country of publication.\n\nIf more than one language is associated with an item, field 041 may be added to the MARC record as well. Field 041 (Language Codes) is used to record multiple language codes, especially when an item has been translated from another language. This field is optional but it can be very useful for purposes of searching.\n\n01X-09X: Number and Code Fields\n\nField 020 (ISBN) - REQUIRED (if applicable)\n\nField 020 contains the International Standard Book Number, a 10- or 13-character identifier assigned by the publisher to the title and edition. This MARC field is an important access point used by libraries. It is usually input in subfield $a, unless it is known to be an incorrect ISBN (for example, when it is not 10 or 13 characters long). These incorrect ISBNs are recorded in subfield $z. The field must include two indicator positions before subfield $a, but both positions contain blanks or “\\”.\n\nThe 10 or 13 characters of the ISBN are often printed on an item with hyphens separating them into groups (e.g. 1-4000-4025-6). However, because the placement of the hyphens varies, hyphens are not included in the MARC record. If available, the 13-character ISBN number is preferable to the 10-character number.\n\nExample:\n\n=020 \\\\$a1400040256\n\n[A 10-chracter ISBN]\n\n=020 \\\\9786071609298\n\n[A 10-chracter ISBN]\n\n=020 \\\\$a087779443X\n\n[In some ISBNs, the last digit is the letter “X”, always recorded as a capital Latin letter.]\n\nField 022 (ISSN) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 022 contains the International Standard Serial Number, a 9-character identifier (two groups of 4 characters, separated by a hyphen) assigned by the publisher to a serial. This MARC field is optional but is an important access point used by libraries. The ISSN is usually input in subfield $a, unless it is known to be an incorrect ISSN (for example, when it is not 9 characters long). It is then recorded in subfield $y. The field must include two indicator positions before subfield $a, but both indicator positions contain blanks or “\\”. Because the hyphen always separates the first group of 4 characters from the second group of 4 characters in an ISSN, it is included in field 022.\n\nNote: When an ISSN is associated with a monographic series title, it is not recorded in field 022 but rather in field 490 (Series statement), subfield $x. See the description of field 490 for details.\n\nExample:\n\n=022 \\\\$a0002-9769\n\nField 024 (Other Standard Identifier) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 024 contains a standard number or code published on an item that cannot be accommodated in another field (e.g., field 020 (International Standard Book Number), 022 (International Standard Serial Number), etc.). The type of standard number or code is identified in the first indicator position or in subfield $2 (Source of number or code).\n\nThe field has two indicator positions. The first indicator indicates the type of standard number or code:\n\n0 - International Standard Recording Code\n\n1 - Universal Product Code\n\n2 - International Standard Music Number\n\n3 - International Article Number\n\n4 - Serial Item and Contribution Identifier\n\n7 - Source specified in subfield $2\n\n8 - Unspecified type of standard number or code\n\nThe second indicator contains a value that indicates whether there is a difference between a scanned number or code and the same number or code in eye-readable form:\n\n# - No information provided\n\n0 - No difference\n\n1 - Difference\n\nThe number is input in subfield $a. Do not include any internal spaces or punctuation that appear with the number.\n\nExamples:\n\n=024 1# $a7822183031\n\n=024 7# $a0A3200912B4A1057$2istc\n\n[Subfield $2 is used to identify the source of the number or code; in this case, the list for these codes is the Standard Identifier Source Codes list.]\n\nField 028 (Publisher Number) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 028 contains publishers' numbers found on videorecordings, sound recordings, printed music, and other music-related material. These numbers are usually found on the edge of the container for the item and may also be represented in part in a barcode (although barcodes are usually recorded in field 024). Publisher's numbers vary in length and style since they are not standardized identifiers. Many are alphanumeric. Usage of this number in a MARC record is optional, but can be an important access point.\n\nThe number is input in subfield $a. Transcribe the number as it appears on the item; this means including any internal spaces or punctuation that appear with the number. There are no input standards controlling the number recorded in field 028.\n\nThe publisher or issuing body is named in subfield $b. A brief form of the publisher's name is usually given.\n\nThe field must include two indicator positions before subfield $a. The first indicator may contain the following values (for a full list see Field 028 - Publisher Number.\n\n0 (for sound recordings)\n\n2 (for printed music)\n\n4 (for videorecordings)\n\nThe second indicator contains a value that indicates whether a note and/or added entry generated from the content of the field is required:\n\n0 (for no note, no added entry)\n\n1 (for a note and an added entry)\n\n2 (for a note with no added entry)\n\n3 (for an added entry but no note)\n\nExamples:\n\n=028 00$aSTMA 8007$bTamla Motown Records\n\n=028 00$aVA5366$bVestron Video\n\nField 040 (Cataloging Agency) - REQUIRED\n\nField 040 contains MARC organization codes that identify who cataloged the item and who input the cataloging data. Subfield $a contains the MARC code for the cataloging agency and subfield $c contains the MARC code for the inputting agency. Official MARC organization codes may be requested online at //www.loc.gov/marc/organizations/.\n\nSubfield $b (Language of Cataloging) should contains the code fir the language “eng”.\n\nSubfield $e (Description conventions) should contain the code “rda”.\n\nField 040 has two indicator positions; both indicator positions contain blanks or “\\”.\n\nExample:\n\n=040 \\\\$aDLC $beng$cDLC$erda\n\n[Record created and input by Library of Congress that uses English for cataloging]\n\nField 041 (Language Codes) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 041 contains two or more of the three-character lowercase Latin MARC language codes that identify the languages of the content of the item when there is more than one language (the main language of an item is also recorded in field 008/35-37).\n\nThe primary language(s) are recorded in subfield $a. This subfield is repeated for each language code.\n\nIf the item is a translation, the language code of the translation is recorded in subfield $a and the code for the original language is recorded in subfield $h.\n\nThe first indicator is value “0” when the item is not a translation, value “1” when the item is a translation, or value “#” if no information is provided. The MARC language code list is online at //www.loc.gov/marc/languages/.\n\nExamples:\n\n041 $aeng\n\n041 $aeng$afre$aswe\n\n[The item includes text in English, French and Swedish]\n\n=041 1\\$aeng$hhun\n\n[The item is an English translation of a work originally written in Hungarian]\n\n1XX: Main Entry Fields\n\nA main entry field is used when there is a personal, corporate or conference name associated with the creation of a work. This field is not repeatable. This means that a record cannot have field 100 and field 110 or field 111. Only one 1XX field may be present in a record.\n\n100 (Main Entry-Personal Name) - REQUIRED (if applicable)\n\nField 100 contains the name of the person primarily responsible for the creation of the item. Field 100 can be used only once in a record, and only if no other field beginning with “1” is present. This field is optional because there may not be always be a primary personal name associated with the work.\n\nField 100 has two indicator positions. The first indicator is most often “1”. In cases where the name consists of a forename only, the first indicator is “0”. The second indicator is blank or “\\”.\n\nField 100 always ends in a mark of final punctuation. This is usually a period, but a hyphen, question mark or closing parentheses [e.g. “)”] are also considered final marks of punctuation.\n\n100 $a (Personal name)\n\nThe personal name is recorded in subfield $a, usually in inverted “catalog entry” form. A comma separates the surname from the family name. If the name includes initials, put a space between them.\n\nExamples:\n\n=100 1\\$aAdams, Henry.\n\n=100 1\\$aGarcía Fernández, Rodrigo.\n\n=100 0\\$aCoetzee, J. M.\n\n=100 0\\$aPlato.\n\n100 $b (Numeration)\n\nSometimes a number is associated with a personal name. It is recorded in subfield $b. This situation occurs most often when names lack a surname (and therefore have a first indicator value of “0”).\n\nExamples:\n\n=100 0\\$aJohn Paul$bII.\n\n=100 0\\$aIvan$bIV.\n\n100 $c (Words associated with a name)\n\nSometimes one or more words are associated with a name but are not part of the forename or surname. These are recorded in subfield $c. A comma separates subfield $c from the preceding subfield.\n\nExamples:\n\n=100 0\\$aJohn Paul$bII,$cPope.\n\n=100 1\\$aBrown, Richard,$cDr.\n\n100 $d (Dates associated with a name)\n\nSome catalogers include birth and death dates (if known). These dates are recorded in subfield $d. A comma separates subfield $d from the preceding subfield. If no death date is appropriate or available, the birth date ends with a hyphen.\n\nExamples:\n\n=100 1\\$aShakespeare, William,$d1564-1616.\n\n=100 0\\$aBenedict$bXVI,$cPope,$d1927-\n\n110 (Main Entry-Corporate Name) - REQUIRED (if applicable)\n\nField 110 contains the name of the corporate entity primarily responsible for the creation of the item. Field 110 can be used only once in a record, and only if no other field beginning with “1” is present. This field is optional because there may not be always be a primary corporate name associated with the work.\n\nField 110 has two indicator positions. The first indicator is ”1” when the name is a corporate or jurisdiction name. The first indicator is “2” when the name is in direct order. The second indicator is always blank (or “\\”).\n\nField 110 ends with a period unless there is a closing parentheses.\n\n110 $a (Corporate name or jurisdiction name)\n\nThe corporate name or jurisdiction name is recorded in subfield $a.\n\nExamples:\n\n=110 1\\$aSt. James Church (Bronx, New York, N.Y.)\n\n=100 2\\$aNew York Public Library.\n\n110 $b (Subordinate unit)\n\nSometimes a number is associated with a personal name. It is recorded in subfield $b. This situation occurs most often when names lack a surname (and therefore have a first indicator value of “0”).\n\nExamples:\n\n=110 1\\$aParis.$bMontmartre.\n\n=110 1\\$a United States.$bCongress.\n\n111 (Main Entry-Meeting Name) - REQUIRED (if applicable)\n\nField 111 contains the name of the meeting, congress, conference, etc., that is primarily responsible for the content of an item. Meeting names are recorded in field 111 only when they appear prominently on the item and the item consists of the proceedings or record of the meeting. Field 111 can be used only once in a record, and only if no other field beginning with “1” is present. This field is optional because there may not be always be a meeting/conference name associated with the work.\n\nField 111 has two indicator positions. The first indicator is “1” when the name is a corporate or jurisdiction name. The first indicator is ”2“ when the name is in direct order. The second indicator is always blank (or “\\”).\n\n111 $a (Meeting name entry element)\n\nThe name of the meeting is recorded in subfield $a. When transcribing the name, follow the capitalization and punctuation rules of the language of the name.\n\n111 $n (Number of meeting)\n\nWhen a meeting is numbered, the number is recorded in subfield $n. An opening parenthesis [e.g. “(”] is placed before the number.\n\n111 $d (Year of meeting)\n\nThe year that a meeting was held is recorded in subfield $d. Subfield $d is separated from the number of the meeting by a space and a colon [e.g. “ :”]. If no number is associated with the meeting, the date is preceded by an opening parenthesis [e.g. “(”].\n\n111 $c (Place of meeting)\n\nThe place where a meeting was held is recorded in subfield $c after subfield $d. Subfield $c is preceded by a space and a colon. [e.g. “ :”], unless it immediately follows subfield $a. A closing parenthesis [e.g. “)”] is added at the end of subfield $c.\n\nExamples:\n\n=111 2\\$aCongress on Infant Mortality$d(1988 :$cNew York, N.Y.)\n\n=111 2\\$aInternational Petroleum Conference$n(4th :$d1998 :$cCaracas, Venezuela)\n\n=111 2\\$aComiket($cTokyo, Japan)\n\n=111 2\\$aSan Diego Comic-Con International($d2012)\n\n20X-24X: Title and Title-Related Fields\n\n245 (Title Statement) - REQUIRED\n\nEvery MARC bibliographic record must have a 245 field that contains least subfield $a (it is assumed that all bibliographic items have some sort of title). Cataloging rules generally require transcription of the title exactly as it appears from a chief source of information. For books, this is the title page, for other types of material, this may be some other source.\n\nCapitalize words according to the guidelines for the language involved. Diacritical marks (accents, umlauts, tilde, etc.) are added to words that would normally have them even if they are missing on a title page. This often occurs when a title appears on a work in all uppercase letters without diacritical marks.\n\nTranscribe punctuation as it appears on the source. Donât abbreviate or omit information. If separate letters or initials appear on the source of information without full stops between them, transcribe the letters without spaces between them. If there are errors in the title and the item being described is a monograph, transcribe any errors and include the corrected title and a note in field 246. If the item is a serial/periodical, correct the errors and make a note.\n\nIf an item lacks a title page or source of title information, a title is supplied in square brackets (“[....]”).\n\nField 245 always ends with a period.\n\nLike most other fields, field 245 has two indicator positions. If there is a 1xx field in the record, the first indicator value is “1”. If there is no 1xx field the value is “0”.\n\nThe second indicator position can contain any value from “0” to “9” and is used to indicate how many letters at the beginning of the title should be skipped in filing or indexing. If a title begins with an initial article (for example “The”), the initial article is skipped. The space that follows the article is included in the count.\n\n245 $a (Title proper)\n\nThe main title of a work, as it appears on the chief source of information, is recorded in field 245 subfield $a. This subfield is not repeatable.\n\nExamples:\n\n=245 14$aThe history of Canada during the 19th century.\n\n[Notice that the second indicator is set to value “4” so that “The ” is skipped in filing or indexing]\n\n=245 00$aTeusday's tasks.\n\n=246 3\\$iCorrected title: $aTuesday's tasks\n\n[Title containing a spelling error and an explanation of the error, with the corrected title in field 246]\n\n245 $b (Other title information)\n\nMany works have title information after the main title. This other title information is recorded in subfield $b.\n\nSubfield $b is not required, but it is often added when appropriate because important descriptive information is often found in this other title information. Subfield $b is usually preceded by a space and a colon (“ :”). If there is a parallel title, subfield $b is preceded by a space and an equal sign (“ =”).This subfield is not repeatable, but additional title information may be transcribed, separated by space colon space (“ : ”).\n\nExamples:\n\n=245 10$aHalley's comet :$ba close call for Earth.\n\n=245 10$aPachebel's canon :$bwith selections from other greats.\n\n=245 10$aModernidad urbana =$burban modernity.\n\n245 $c (Statement of responsibility)\n\nMany works include some kind of statement of responsibility. Even though the name(s) may also appear in other MARC fields, such as fields 100 or 700, the statement of responsibility is often transcribed subfield $c.\n\nOften statements of responsibility are simple statements such as: “written by John Williams”. But they can also be complex and include many names and information explaining who did what. Try to transcribe what appears on an item with as little change as possible. This includes terms of address (such as “Dr.”). If more than one name is on the title page, record all names or record the first name and add an explanation about what was left out in brackets. Do not use “ ... ” or “ ... [et. al].”\n\nThe subfield is separated from the rest of the title statement by a space slash (“ /”). If several statements of responsibility are transcribed, they are separated from one another by a space, semicolon, space (“ ; ”). Subfield $c is not repeatable.\n\nWhy is 245 $c important?\n\nThe information in field 245 subfield $c often repeats much of the information also recorded in field 100 or 700. However, it is important to remember that the content of field 245 subfield $c is the transcription of the statement of responsibility from the title page. This means that the information is not formatted like it is in one of the 1XX or 7XX fields. Libraries use the transcription of the title and author statements in field 245 to match an item with a specific bibliographic record. For works that have been published in many editions, this can be an important factor in identifying the appropriate MARC record.\n\nThe statement of responsibility is also used by librarians to determine the best form of name to use in access fields (MARC 1XX, 6XX, and 7XX fields). Prolific authors often vary the way they present their names on title pages. A single form will be used in a MARC access field, but different forms may appear in field 245. This is why correct transcription from the title page is important.\n\nIt is permissible to add information to what is transcribed if this makes the content of the work or responsibility for it clearer. But any additions made should always be recorded in square brackets. This indicates that the information did not appear on the chief source of information.\n\nExamples:\n\n=245 10$aHalley's comet :$ba close call for Earth /$cwritten by John Williams.\n\n=245 12$aA game for all /$c[text by] Margaret Crosbie ; illustrated by Bill Macy.\n\n=245 10$aSee how things go /$c by Susan Brown, Melanie Carlson, Stephen Lindell, Kevin Ott, and Janet Wilson.\n\n[Example of all the names on a title page being recorded.]\n\n=245 10$aSee how things go /$c by Susan Brown [and four others].\n\n[Example of just the first name being recorded, with a summary of what was omitted in brackets.]\n\nField 246 (Variant Title) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 246 is used to provide access to a variant title that appears on an item. These titles appear on the cover, spine, or in other locations. If the variant title appears on the title page, the same title may be found in the transcription of the title page in field 245. This is often the case with parallel titles in different languages. This field is also used to record corrections when the title contains errors.\n\nThe first indicator in field 246 is usually value 3 (a title added entry is generated, but no note). The second indicator value depends on the kind of variant title in field 246. The possibilities for the second indicator are shown below.\n\nIndicator values for Field 246\n\nFirst indicator\n\n0 - Note, no added entry\n\n1 - Note, added entry\n\n2 - No note, no added entry\n\n3 - No note, added entry\n\nSecond indicator\n\nblank or “\\” - No type specified\n\n0 - Portion of title\n\n1 - Parallel title\n\n2 - Distinctive title\n\n3 - Other title\n\n4 - Cover title\n\n5 - Added title page\n\n6 - Caption title (on periodicals)\n\n7 - Running title (throughout text, usually at top or bottom of page)\n\n8 - Spine title\n\nThe variant title is recorded in subfield $a. If none of the second indicator choices shown above is appropriate, you can record a word or phrase in subfield $i that indicates the type of variant title. If subfield $i is used it precedes subfield $a. Field 246 does not end in a mark of punctuation unless the last word in the field is an abbreviation, initial/letter, or data that ends with a mark of punctuation.\n\nExamples:\n\n=246 34\\$aQantas annual report\n\n=246 31$aProblèmes actuels de pharmacopsychiatrie\n\n=246 3\\$iTitle from colophon:$aRossiiskaíà literatura v emigratsii\n\n25X-28X: Edition, Imprint. Etc. Fields\n\nField 250 (Edition Statement) - REQUIRED (if applicable)\n\nField 250 is optional but should be included if an edition statement appears on the item. The statement is recorded in subfield $a in the language in which it appears and should not be translated into another language. Additional information is recorded in subfield $b. Both indicator positions in field 250 contain blanks or “\\”. The field ends with a period.\n\nDo not abbreviate information unless it is abbreviated in the source of information. If the edition statement does not appear on an item but is known from some other source (external to the item), it may be recorded in square brackets (“[...]”).\n\nExamples:\n\n=250 \\\\$a1st edition.\n\n=250 \\\\$aRev. ed. /$bwith revisions, an introduction, and a chapter on writing by E.B. White, 2nd ed. /$bwith the assistance of Eleanor Gould Packard.\n\n=250 \\\\$a2nd enlarged edition, revised.\n\n=250 \\\\$a[New edition].\n\nField 254 (Musical Presentation Statement) - OPTIONAL\n\nThis field is optional but should be included if the item is printed music. The musical presentation statement usually consists of words or phrases such as “Partitura” or “Full orchestral score” that appear on the piece of music itself. Do not translate this statement into another language; record it in the language in which it appears. If it appears in more than one language, transcribe it in the language of the title in field 245.\n\nThe statement is recorded in subfield $a. Both indicator positions in field 254 contain blanks or “\\”. If the musical presentation statement does not appear on an item but is known from some other source (external to the item), it may be recorded in square brackets (“[...]”). The field ends with a period.\n\nExamples:\n\n=254 \\\\$aFull score.\n\n=254 \\\\$aPartitur.\n\n=254 \\\\$a[Játszópartitúra].\n\nField 255 (Cartographic Mathematical Data) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 255 is optional but should be included if the item is an atlas, map, or globe. Information about the scale of the cartographic item is recorded in this field. If the scale is not indicated on the item but is known from some other source (external to the item), it may be recorded in square brackets (“[...]”). If the scale is not known, use the statement “Scale not given” or its equivalent in another language.\n\nThe statement is recorded in subfield $a. Both indicator positions in field 255 contain blanks or “\\”. The field ends with a period.\n\nExamples:\n\n=255 \\\\$aEscala: 1:200,000.\n\n=255 \\\\$aScale not given.\n\n=255 \\\\$aMassstab: [1:160,000].\n\nField 264 (Production, Publication, Distribution, Manufacture, and Copyright Notice) - REQUIRED\n\nField 264 is required in all MARC records. The field provides information that is useful to those users who might want to obtain a copy of the item. Information for field 264 is not always readily available but most catalogers try to provide information in the three main subfields defined for field 264, even if the information is probable or unknown.\n\nThe first indicator position in field 264 is a blank or “\\” and the second indicator value will usually be “1” (for Publication). See //www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd264.html for a complete list of all indicator fields. Square brackets are used to indicate information that does not appear on the item being cataloged.\n\nField 264 ends with a period unless a hyphen, question mark, or square bracket is present.\n\n264 $a (Place of production, publication, distribution, manufacture)\n\nTranscribe places of publication in the form in which they appear on the source of information.Â Include both the local place name (city, town, etc.) and the name of the larger jurisdiction (state, province, and/or country) if present on the source of information.\n\nIf there is no indication of the place of publication, try to provide the most probable place of publication followed by a question mark (“?”). Place this information in square brackets. Do not use “[S.l.]”. If the place of publication is completely unknown, use “[Place of publication not identified]”.\n\nAlthough it is not required, subfield $a can be repeated if more than one place is recorded on the source of information. When subfield $a is repeated, a space and a semicolon (“ ;”) is used to separate the repeated subfield from any subfield that precedes it.\n\n264 $b (Name of producer, publisher, distributor, manufacturer)\n\nField 264 should also always include at least one occurrence of subfield $b with the name of the publisher or distributor of the item. Record the publisher's name in the form in which it appears on the source of information. Record words or phrases indicating the function (other than solely publishing) performed by a person, family, or corporate body as they appear on the source of information.\n\nSubfield $b can be repeated for multiple publishers, but only the first publisher named is required. However, if additional names are listed, generally no more than three are given. If each publisher is located in a different city, subfield $b should follow the subfield $a with which it is associated. A space and a semicolon (“ :”) come before subfield $b with a. If no publisher/distributor is named and no good guess can be made, use the following phrase:“[publisher not identified] :” Do not use “[s.n.]”.\n\n264 $c (Date of production, publication, distribution, manufacture, or copyright notice)\n\nField 264 normally includes subfield $c with the date of publication. Subfield $c is recorded as the last subfield in field 264, separated from the rest of the field by a comma (“,”). Usually the date is given in terms of a single year, or multiple years separated by a hyphen for multipart items. If the ending year is not known, the beginning year is followed by a hyphen and nothing else. If no date of publication/distribution is known, supply a probable date of publication followed by a question mark (“?”). Probable dates are enclosed in square brackets.\n\nExamples:\n\n=264 \\0$aSpringfield, MA :$bMerriam,$c1971.\n\n=264 \\0$aAmsterdam ;$aBrussels :$bElsevier,$c1978.\n\n=264 \\0$a[Paris?] :$bHachette,$c[1988?]\n\n=264 \\0$aMadrid :$b[publisher not identified],$c1948-\n\n[Imprint for a Spanish periodical that began publication in 1948; the name of the publisher is not known]\n\n=264 \\0$aNew York :$bHippocrene Books ;$aLondon :$bRoutledge & Kegan Paul,$c1983.\n\n[Item is published in more than one place and has a different publisher in each place]\n\n3XX: Physical Description, Etc. Fields\n\nField 300 (Physical Description) - REQUIRED\n\nField 300 is required in all MARC records. It is used to record the physical description of the item--in particular its extent and dimensions. This physical description is used to more easily locate an item or to determine the size of an item in general.\n\nThe extent of a item (that is, number of pages, number of volumes, disks, etc.) is recorded in subfield $a. The dimensions of the item are recorded in subfield $c. An optional subfield $b is used to record other physical details, and accompanying material (for example, a DVD) is recorded in subfield $e. Both indicator positions in field 300 contain blanks or “\\”.\n\nThe field may be repeated to record the physical description of components of different material types that are covered by the same MARC record, but this is not required.\n\n300 $a (Extent)\n\nThe extent of a bibliographic item is usually a numeric value followed by additional information that varies depending on what type of material the record describes.\n\nThe extent of textual material is expressed by the number of pages, when the item is complete in one volume, or the number of volumes, when the item is in more than one volume. Do not use abbreviations. Use “pages” and “volumes” instead.\n\nIf the MARC record is for some of the parts of a multipart item, the number of the part being described is recorded in angle brackets (“<...>”) after the extent term. For example, if cataloging only volume 7 of a 10-volume set, the extent would be expressed as “Volume <7>” in 300 subfield $a.\n\nSubfield $a is not repeatable.\n\nNon-print materials use a variety of standard terms in field 300 subfield $a:\n\nThe extent of sound recordings is expressed in terms of the number of sound discs, tape reels, or sound cassettes. The duration in minutes is often included, and is enclosed in parentheses after the number of discs or reels.\n\nThe extent of cartographic materials is expressed in terms of the number of maps, globes, atlases, etc.\n\nMusic is described in terms of the number of leaves of music or number of scores.\n\nThe extent of video material is described in terms of film reels, videodiscs, or video cassettes. The duration in minutes is often included, and is enclosed in parentheses after the number of items.\n\nExamples:\n\n=300 \\\\$a455 pages\n\n=300 \\\\$a3 volumes\n\n=300 \\\\$a2 sound discs (approximately 50 min.).\n\n=300 \\\\$a1 video cassette (21 min.)\n\n=300 \\\\$avolume <4>\n\n300 $b (Other physical details)\n\nMany MARC users want to record other important physical details related to an item. These details include the presence of illustrations (“illustrations”), sound (“sound”), characteristics of sound (for example, “stereo”), recording technique (for example, “digital”), speed (for example, “33 1/3 rpm”), and image characteristics (for example, “color” or, “black & white”). Subfield $b is separated from any preceding subfield with a space and a colon (“ :”). Subfield $b is not repeatable.\n\nExamples:\n\n=300 \\\\$a455 pages :$bcolor illustrations\n\n=300 \\\\$a3 volumes :$bmaps, tables\n\n=300 \\\\$a2 sound discs :$banalog, 33 1/3 rpm, stereo\n\n=300 \\\\$a1 video cassette :$bsound, color\n\n=300 \\\\$a1 map :$bcolor\n\n300 $c (Dimensions)\n\nField 300 should include the dimensions of the item in subfield $c. Dimensions of printed items are usually represented by the height in full centimeters (not fractions), unless the item is wider than it is high, in which case both the height and width are given in subfield $c. Film is measured in full millimeters. For discs, the diameter is given, usually in American inches (2.54 cm = 1 inch).\n\nSubfield $c is required and should not be omitted. In cases where it is not possible to provide dimensions for textual materials, the abbreviation “cm” can just be put in subfield $c as a placeholder. A space and a semicolon (“ ;”) is used to separate the subfield $c from preceding subfields. Subfield $c is not repeatable.\n\nSubfield $c does not end with a mark of punctuation unless the record also contains a 4XX field.\n\nExamples:\n\n=300 \\\\$a248 pages :$billustrations ;$c24 cm\n\n[Note that “cm” does not end with a period].\n\n=300 \\\\$a3 volumes :$bmaps, tables ;$c28 cm\n\n=300 \\\\$a2 sound discs :$banalog, 33 1/3 rpm, stereo ;$c12 inches\n\n=300 \\\\$a1 videodisc (38 min.) :$bsound, color ;$c8 inches\n\n=300 \\\\$a1 map :$bcolor21 ;$c45 x 58 cm\n\nField 310 (Current Publication Frequency) - OPTIONAL\n\nField 310 is optional but should be included if the item is a serial (periodical). The current publication frequency is recorded in subfield $a in the language of the catalog in which the record will reside, not the language of the title. It is usually brief, such as “Quarterly”, “Weekly”, or “Seven times a year”. Both indicator positions in field 310 contain blanks or “\\”.\n\nThe frequency statement does not have to be found in the issue in hand in order for the MARC record to contain field 310. The first issue of a new periodical often has an indication of the planned publication frequency. If the frequency is not known or varies, field 310 can state this. Field 310 does not end in a period.\n\nExamples:\n\n=310 \\\\$aMonthly\n\n=310 \\\\$aAnnual, with five year cumulations\n\n=310 \\\\$aFrequency varies\n\n=310 \\\\$aFrequency unknown\n\nField 336 (Content Type) - REQUIRED\n\nField 336 records the form of communication through which a work is expressed. It is used in conjunction with Leader/06 (Type of record), which indicates the general type of content of the resource.\n\nSubfield $a (Content type term) records the content type of the work being described, while subfield $b (Content type code) contains a code representing the content type of the work being described. Both subfields may be used but generally only one is used.\n\nSubfield $2 (Source) contains the MARC code that identifies the source of the term or code used to record the content type information. The default value of subfield $2 is “rdacontent”â. Both indicator positions contain blanks or “/”.\n\nBelow is a table of of the most common term/codes that would be used in most records along with the corresponding code in Leader/06. For a complete list of all terms and codes, please see Term and Code List for RDA Content Types.\n\nContent terms and and MARC codes for RDA Content Types terms - 336 $a codes - 336 $b Leader/06 notated music ntm c or d text txt a two-dimensional moving image tdi g\n\nExamples:\n\nBook:\n\n=336 \\\\$atext$2rdacontent\n\n=336 \\\\$btdm$2rdacontent\n\nScore:\n\n=336 \\\\$anotated music$2rdacontent\n\n=336 \\\\$bntm$2rdacontent\n\nDVD:\n\n=336 \\\\$atwo-dimensional moving image$2rdacontent\n\n=336 \\\\$btdi$2rdacontent\n\nField 337 (Media Type) - REQUIRED\n\nField 337 records the general type of device required to view, play, run, etc., the content of a item.\n\nSubfield $a (Media type term) records the category of media used to convey the content of the resource. while subfield $b (Media type code) contains a code for the category of media. Both subfields may be used but, generally only one is used.\n\nSubfield $2 (Source) contains the MARC code that identifies the source of the term or code used to record the content type information. The default value of subfield $2 is “rdamediaâ. Both indicator positions contain blanks or “/”.\n\nBelow is a table of of the most common term/codes that would be used in most records along with the corresponding code in leader/06.

Both subfields may be used but, generally only one is used.\n\nSubfield $2 (Source) contains the MARC code that identifies the source of the term or code used to record the carrier type information. The default value of subfield $2 is “rdacarrier”â. Both indicator positions contain blanks or “/”.\n\nBelow is a table of of the most common term/codes that would be used in most records along with the corresponding code in leader/06.

All periodicals must have some sort of sequential designation. This is usually a number and associated month/year, but for annual publications, this can be a year alone. When issues of a periodical have both numbers and associated chronological designations (month, year, etc.), the chronological designation is recorded in parentheses after the number.\n\nField 362 contains the dates/sequential designations of the first and last issues only. However, since many periodicals are still published, this field may contain only the date/sequential designation from the first issue.\n\nIf you do not know the date/sequential designation of the first issue, use the date/sequential designation from the issue you have. The designation is recorded in subfield $a. The first indicator position in field 362 should contain value “0”, the second indicator contains a blank or “\\”. Field 362 ends with a hyphen if the designation of the last issue is not yet known.\n\nExamples:\n\n=362 0\\$aVol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 1998)-v. 1, no. 3 (March 1998)\n\n=362 0\\$a1981-\n\n=362 0\\$a72/1 ([Apr. 1972])-\n\n=362 1\\$aBegan in 2005?\n\nSeries Fields\n\nField 490 (Series Statement) - REQUIRED (if applicable)\n\nField 490 contains the title, ISSN, and volume number(s) associated with monographic series and other collective titles associated with an item. Field 490 is repeatable if an item is in more than one series, however, in most cases where more than one series title appears, one is a main series and the other is a subseries. Catalogers must be careful to identify cases where more than one series title is truly involved.\n\nField 490 does not serve as a series added entry. When field 490 is used and a series added entry is desired, both the series statement (field 490) and a corresponding series added entry (fields 800-830) are recorded in the bibliographic record.\n\nThe first indicator position in field 490 always contains “0” (Series not traced) or “1” (Series traced). If the latter values is selected an 830 field must be present in the record. The second indicator position always contains blank or “\\”.\n\n490 $a (Series statement)\n\nThe first subfield in field 490 is always subfield $a. It contains the series title. This title may also contain a statement of responsibility or other title information.\n\nSubfield $a contains the main series title and is transcribed from the item as it appears. The same rules of transcription applicable to field 245 are applied in field 490. Subfield $a is repeatable if a series has a subseries that is separated from the main series by the numbering of the main series in subfield $v or by the ISSN in subfield $x, or when a series has a parallel title.\n\nExamples:\n\n=490 0\\$aWonderful cooks collection\n\n=490 0\\$aDepartment of State publication ;$v7846.$aDepartment and Foreign Service series ;$v128\n\n490 0\\$aAnnual census of manufactures =$aRecensement des manufactures,$x0315-5587\n\n490 $x (ISSN)\n\nIf an ISSN has been assigned to a monographic series it is recorded in field 490, subfield $x, not in field 022. Only ISSNs associated with serials (periodicals) should be recorded in field 022.\n\nThe ISSN is recorded in subfield $x. The hyphen that separates the first group of four characters from the second group of four should be included. Subfield $x is separated from subfield $a by a comma.\n\nExample:\n\n=490 0\\$aColección Artística de verano,$x0123-110X ;$vt. 3\n\n490 $v (Volume/sequential designation)\n\nVolumes in a monographic series are sometimes numbered. If some sort of sequential designation (numbering) appears on the item, it is recorded in subfield $v and is separated from the preceding subfield by a space semicolon. Record the numbering of the resource within the series as it appears on the source of information. Do not capitalize a term that is part of the series numbering unless the the language involved requires capitalization (e.g., noun capitalization in German)\n\nExamples:\n\n=490 0\\$aLes Cahiers de recherche scientifique ;$vvol. 41\n\n=490 0\\$aEuropäische Hochschulscriften ;$vBd. 257\n\nNote Fields - OPTIONAL\n\nField 500 (General Note)\n\nField 500 is one of over fifty optional 5XX (Note) fields in the MARC 21 format. This field is described here because it can be used instead of one of the other more specific note fields. You may want to look at other 5XX fields if you have a particular need to record more specific note information.\n\nThe text of the note is recorded in subfield $a. Both indicator positions in field 500 contain blanks or “\\”. The most common use of field 500 is to record additional information about the content or publication of the item. Field 500 ends with a a period.\n\nExamples:\n\n=500 \\\\$aIncludes index.\n\n=500 \\\\$aAuthor statement from cover.\n\n=500 \\\\$aReprint of the 1914 ed.\n\nField 520 (Summary, Etc.)\n\nField 520 is optional but popular with those MARC users who want to provide a summary or review of the content of the item. A brief summary, review, etc. is recorded in subfield $a. An expansion or continuation of the summary, etc. is recorded in subfield $b. The brief summary is recorded in a separate subfield to allow MARC users to display or print only the brief summary when space for the full summary is not available. The first indicator is used to indicate the exact type of information recorded in field 520. The second indicator contains a blank or “\\”. Field 520 ends in a period.\n\nSome of the possible first indicator values are:\n\nValue Meaning blank or “\\” Summary 0 Subject 1 Review 2 Scope and content 3 Abstract\n\nExamples:\n\n=520 \\\\$aChildren's work about animals found in a zoo.\n\n=520 3\\$aScientific study of autism.$bIncluded the case histories of 27 patients ages 5 to 21, including text of interviews with pediatricians and parents of the patients.\n\n=520 1\\$aChildrens' tale of three pigs who each build houses to protect themselves from an evil wolf. The tale is predictable, the artwork is uninspiring, and the audience of this work is most likely the parents who would buy it, not the children for whom it is intended.\n\nSubject Fields - OPTIONAL\n\nField 600 (Subject-Personal Name)\n\nField 600 contains the name of a person used as a subject added entry. Field 600 has two indicators. The first indicator is most often value “1”. In cases where the name consists of a forename only, the first indicator is value “0”.\n\nThe second indicator is used to identify the source of the heading in a 6XX field. For example, second indicator value “0” means that the source is LC Subject Headings. Value “4” means that the source is not identified. Value “7” means that the source of the 6XX subject heading is identified by a MARC code in subfield $2. Use of second indicator value “7” requires the presence of subfield $2 with a valid MARC source code.\n\nField 600 always ends in a mark of final punctuation. This is usually a period, but a hyphen or question mark are also considered final marks of punctuation.\n\n600 $a (Personal name)\n\nThe personal name is recorded in subfield $a, usually in inverted “catalog entry” form. A comma separates the surname from the family name.\n\nExamples:\n\n=600 14$aMcCartney, Paul.\n\n=600 04$aElizabeth$bII,$cQueen of England,$d1926-\n\n600 $b (Numeration)\n\nSometimes a number is associated with a personal name. It is recorded in subfield $b. Since this situation is most common with names lacking a surname, the first indicator is often “0”.\n\nExamples:\n\n=600 04$aJohn Paul$bII.\n\n=600 04$aIvan$bIV.\n\n600 $c (Words associated with a name)\n\nSometimes one or more words are associated with a name but are not part of the forename or surname. These are recorded in subfield $c. A comma separates subfield $c from the preceding subfield.\n\nExample:\n\n=600 04$aJohn Paul$bII,$cPope.\n\n600 $d (Dates associated with a name)\n\nSome catalogers include birth and death dates with names associated with an item. These dates are recorded in subfield $d. A comma separates subfield $d from the preceding subfield. If the no death date is appropriate, the birth date ends with a hyphen.\n\nExample:\n\n=600 14$aShakespeare, William,$d1564-1616.$2[source code]\n\n600 $x (General subdivision)\n\nPersonal names used as subjects often include a subject subdivision that indicates the aspect covered by the item. These subdivision terms are recorded in subfield $x. A typical example is the subdivision “History”.\n\nExample:\n\n=600 10$aBrunhoff, Jean de,$d1899-1937$xCharacters$xBabar.\n\n600 $2 (Source of name)\n\nSubfield $2 is required in a 6XX subject field only when the second indicator position contains value “7”.

The first indicator position should contain value 2, unless the corporate name is entered under the name of a jurisdiction (for example, the name of a country). If the first element is a jurisdiction, the first indicator is value “1”.\n\nThe second indicator is used to identify the source of the heading in a 6XX field. For example, second indicator value “0” means that the source is LC Subject Headings. Value “4” means that the source is not identified. Value “7” means that the source of the 6XX subject heading is identified by a MARC code in subfield $2. Use of second indicator value “7” requires the presence of subfield $2 with a valid MARC source code.\n\n610 $a (Corporate name entry element)\n\nThe corporate name entry element is recorded in subfield $a. This is the highest level part of a corporate name. Follow the capitalization and punctuation for the language of the name in transcription.

For example, second indicator value “0” means that the source is LC Subject Headings. Value “4” means that the source is not identified. Value “7” means that the source of the 6XX subject heading is identified by a MARC code in subfield $2. Use of second indicator value “7” requires the presence of subfield $2 with a valid MARC source code.\n\n611 $a (Meeting name entry element)\n\nThe name of the meeting is recorded in subfield $a. Follow the capitalization and punctuation for the language of the name in transcription. The number of the meeting is not recorded in subfield $a.\n\n611 $n (Number of meeting)\n\nWhen a meeting is numbered, the number is recorded in subfield $n. An opening parenthesis is recorded before the number after the subfield code.\n\n611 $d (Year of meeting)\n\nThe year that a meeting was held is recorded in subfield $d. Subfield $d is separated from the number by a space colon (“ :”). If no number is associated with the meeting, the date is preceded by an opening parenthesis after the subfield code.\n\n611 $c (Place of meeting)\n\nThe place where a meeting was held is recorded in subfield $c after subfield $d. Subfield $c is separated from subfield $d by a space colon (“ :”). A closing parenthesis is recorded at the end of subfield $c.\n\nExamples:\n\n=611 24$aCongress on Machinability$d(1965 :$cLondon, England)\n\n=611 24$aInternational American Conference$n(8th :$d1938 :$cLima, Perú)\n\n611 $x (General subdivision)\n\nMeeting names used as subjects often include a subject subdivision that indicates the aspect covered by the item.

This field is only used for works that are not known by an author's name. The first indicator position contains value “0”. The second indicator is used to identify the source of the heading in a 6XX field. For example, value “0” means that the source is LC Subject Headings. Value “4” means that the source is not identified. Value “7” means that the source of the 6XX subject heading is identified by a MARC code in subfield $2. Use of second indicator value “7” requires the presence of subfield $2 with a valid MARC source code.\n\n630 $a (Uniform title)\n\nThe uniform title is recorded in subfield $a.

The field contains a formatted date and the number of the invoice on which the bibliographic item was supplied.\n\nThis field is not required by the MARC 21 format but it is an important field for the Library of Congress. Suppliers of library materials to the Library should always include either field 923 or another 9XX field(s) that contains the information listed below in records for items sent to the Library. Both indicators contain value blank or “\\”.\n\n923 $d (Invoice date)\n\nSubfield $d contains an 8-digit formatted date of the invoice on which an item was supplied. The format of the date is: yyyymmdd where “yyyy” is the year, “mm” is the two-digit month, “dd” is the two-digit day. If the day is unknown, two hyphens can be used instead of digits.\n\n923 $n (Invoice number)\n\nSubfield $n contains the number assigned by the source of the material (often a bookseller) to the invoice on which the item was supplied. There are no special formatting requirements for the invoice number since the style and length of invoice numbers varies from source to source. This subfield is not intended for order numbers that can be assigned by LC or the supplier. No subfield is currently defined in MARC 21 for order numbers.\n\n923 $s (Source code)\n\nSubfield $s contains the MARC organization code for the source of the bibliographic item--this means the supplier to the Library of Congress, not the publisher. This is usually the same MARC organization code as is found in field 003 and field 040."
