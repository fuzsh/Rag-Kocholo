No cost, no charge. It is aimed at readers, writers and artists that are looking for something different, be it totally unknown or fully recognizable to all. We want PDE to be like a magic box whose content will change every time you take it in your hands to pull out something you haven’t thought about. Something that will amaze and entertain everybody, bringing long nights of creativity. We do not dare to think that we will disclose secrets you don’t know about, rather than provide a tool to improve the mindscape we all share, thanks to the creations of people that came before us and left characters and concepts we now can use as we please. It will be an ever-improving work to which everybody can contribute with suggestions, comments and criticism. Most of all, it is something we would like to share.\n\nThe golden age of comics PDE’s issues dedicated to superheroes will cover a chronological period between June 1938 and October 1956. Defining the beginning of the Golden Age of Comics is always a tricky business. Experts and scholars differ in their opinions. Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide’s regular publication “The Golden Age Quarterly” lists comic books from 1933 onwards, as 1933 is the year of publication of the first book in a size that would later define the comics standard format. Several comic book historians, including Roger Sabin (Comics, Comix and Graphic Novels: a History of Comic Art - new ed. 2009), date the beginning of the Golden Age to the publication of the first comics featuring original stories rather than re-prints of newspaper strips (New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1 - Feb. 1935, New Comics #1 - Dec. 1935, with a slightly larger size than today’s comic book format, both published by National Allied Publications). Since in this issues we are dealing with superheroes, we will consider June 1938 (Action Comics #1 featuring Superman) the beginning of the Golden Age. Defining the end of the Golden Age is also a difficult issue. While it is true that the definition of the superhero archetype is probably the most significant Golden Age contribution to pop culture, it is also true that many superpowered characters created in the WWII era did not survive the end of the war, forcing the publishers to die or diversify. Between 1949 and 1951, western, adventure, science fiction, romance and horror stories took the upper hand and ousted many superheroes. Only popular characters such as Superman and Batman went on, regardless of the crisis of the Golden Age. This transitional period (often referred to as the Atomic Era) that would end in October 1956 (first new Flash story - Showcase #4, DC Comics, setting the beginning of the Silver Age), is also included in the current chronology, since it describes the struggle of the comics creative minds to cope with what the future was going to be. The characters created in this span of time blink back at their Golden Age ancestors while trying to keep up with the new world order (e.g. the Atomic Thunderbolt, Atoman).\n\nThe characters\n\namerican crusader Archibald “Archie” Masters\n\nCreated by: Max Plaisted (1902-1956)\n\nHISTORY & BIO Archie Masters is a timid astronomy professor, teaching at the Grand University in the eastern United States. Lost in his thoughts, he accidentally accesses a lab in which an experimental atom smasher is being tested. Bathed by atomic radiations, he is endowed with superpowers. He uses his newly acquired abilities to fight crime as the patriotic American Crusader. In his civilian identity, he keeps pretending to be the geek he was before the accident to the frustration of his secretary, Jane Peters, who would have loved to be his girlfriend. Later on, Archie resigns from the University to fight the Nazis on the European front (Thrilling comics #34 - Mar. 1943). Jane Peters joins the army as a war nurse (Thrilling Comics #35 - May 1943). In Europe, Archie meets Mickey Martin, an American teenager who was in France when the Nazi forces invaded it (Thrilling Comics #39 - Dec. 1943). Mickey becomes his sidekick.\n\nPOWERS American Crusader posseses super strength, invulnerability and the power of flight.\n\nAMERICAN CRUSADER golden age appearances\n\nFirst Appearance: Thrilling Comics #19 (Aug. 1941)\n\nLast Appearance: Thrilling Comics #41 (Apr. 1944)\n\nAmerica’s Best Comics #6 Thrilling Comics #19-35, 37-39, 41\n\n9 8\n\n1\n\n7 6 5 4\n\n8\n\n3\n\n7\n\n5\n\n2 1\n\n1\n\n0 1939\n\n1940\n\n1941\n\n1942\n\n1943\n\nThrilling Comics\n\n1944\n\n1945\n\n1946\n\n1947\n\nAmerica's Best Comics\n\n1948\n\n1949\n\nAMERICAN CRUSADER modern appearances AC Comics FemForce V1 (1-163, 1985-2013) #29-31, 34-36, 59, 60, 67, 127, 156-158 Femforce: Out of the Asylum Special V1 (oneshot, 1987) Fighting Yank V1 (1-5, 2001-2002) #5 Fighting Yank and the Sentinels of America V1 (oneshot, 2003) N.E.D.O.R.

Hughes (1909-1974) Kin Platt (1911-2003)\n\nHISTORY & BIO In a remote mountain lab, young scientist Tom Standish is assisting Dr. Wolfe in developing a serum that mimicks the abilities of the eagles. While carrying a batch of the serum, Tom accidentally spills it onto a cathode-tube, causing a strange black glow. Curious as to how the tube has been changed, Tom inserts it into a projector and is suddenly bombarded by a black light, developing superpowers. As Tom goes to Dr. Wolfe to inform him about the serum reaction, he discovers that Wolfe is conspiring with Nazis to poison America’s water supply. Caught by the Nazis, he is thrown off a cliff, but miraculously survives the fall, thanks to his newly aquired super abilities. Attempting to stop the conspiracy against America, Tom destroys the lab and kills the Nazis. Only Dr. Wolfe manages to survive. Returning to the city to look for work, Tom is saved from being struck by a car by Bud Pierce, the son of a circus strong-man, also looking for a job. Impressed by the youngster’s own strength and bravery, Tom offers Bud to join forces and look for work together. Tom applies for a lab assistantship, only to discover that Dr. Wolfe is alive and still pursuing his criminal plots. To fight against the Nazis, Tom dons the costume of the American Eagle. In his\n\nheroic deeds he is supported by Bud, as American Eagle’s sidekick, the Eaglet.\n\nPOWERS American Eagle posseses near invulnerability, super-strenght and the power to leap large distances.
