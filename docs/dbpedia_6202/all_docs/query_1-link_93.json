        "text": "Grit City Comic Show is an affordable comic con for the entire family with old-school comic book convention sensibilities. Grit City Comic Show takes place in Tacoma, WA at the Greater Tacoma Convention Center annually in the Fall. We focus on comic book creators (artists and writers of all types) and the comic books they create. But we are not limited to only comic books as we include creativity in related genres such as novelists, crafters, gaming, and our annual cosplay contest. Of course, as a comic book convention, we feature some of the largest comic book dealers and toy dealers in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nGrit City Comic Show was born in 2021 out of Jet City Comic Show, a comic book convention that ran from 2009 through 2019 in both Seattle and later Tacoma, WA. We have since decided to run multiple comic book shows throughout the PNW, under our Jet City Shows Brand.\n\nMeet The Team\n\nJames Taylor – Co-Promoter\n\njames@jetcitycomicshow.com\n\nJames Taylor has been working as an artist in the comic book industry since 1997, working on well over 100 comic books over the years.
