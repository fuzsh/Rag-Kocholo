        "text": "In the 1950s, comics were downright scary. Not only were the stories themselves full of ghouls, zombies, lurid murders and bug-eyed monsters, but the medium itself attracted the panicked attention of psychologists, educators and even the United States Senate, who believed comics were contributing to juvenile delinquency. The comics that bore the brunt of this onslaught, with titles like Tales from the Crypt, Vault of Horror, Weird Fantasy and Shock SuspenStories, were published by an outfit called EC, and they are remembered by generations of fans as an early pinnacle in art and storytelling, even as they were driven off the newsstands by the advent of the censorious Comic Code Authority. Creators including Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, Stephen King, John Carpenter and others have cited the comics as inspiration for their movies and books.\n\nNow, William M. Gaines Agent, Inc., the entity that controls the bulk of the EC archive, has entered into an agreement with Hivemind, a recently-founded media and content development company, to produce a number of film and TV projects based on the publishers’ work. The first announced project is Weird Fantasy, a television show “inspired by the shocking and subversive sci-fi/fantasy series that collided visionary genre storytelling with socially conscious themes of racial and gender equality, anti-war advocacy, nuclear disarmament and ecological preservation to create some of the most impactful and hotly debated comic book stories ever produced,” according to the company.\n\nEC Comics have been reprinted in deluxe editions over the years, and the company’s enduring contribution to American culture, Harvey Kurtzman’s cutting satire MAD, continued life as a magazine down to the present day. The company’s trove of terrifying tales has also been mined by film and TV over the years, with movies based on EC’s trademark “snap ending” horror stories and the 1990s anthology series Tales from the Crypt, which ran for seven seasons on HBO and featured some of Hollywood’s top talent.\n\nHivemind also announced the development of a feature length biopic based on the life of William M. Gaines, the provocative publisher and mastermind behind EC’s innovative approach. Gaines grew the small comics firm he inherited from his father into an industry powerhouse in the 1950s, selling millions of copies monthly to an American public hungry for sophisticated, unsentimental tales of grim and grue, drawn by top caliber artists. Gaines stood up to the forces of censorship that tried to drive his comics off the stands, culminating in dramatic testimony before the US Senate on carried on live TV. Though Gaines’s opponents succeeded in banning EC comics through the imposition of the Comics Code, their influence in the culture was no so easily erased.\n\nBoth projects will be produced by Gaines’ daughter and grandson, Cathy Mifsud and Corey Mifsud, for EC, alongside Dinesh Shamdasani, Sean Daniel, Jason F. Brown, and Hunter Gorinson for Hivemind.\n\n“The story of William Gaines is the secret history of American pop culture,” said Gorinson. \"The ideas he presented in the pages of TALES FROM THE CRYPT, WEIRD FANTASY, and so many more would inspire and incite revolutionary countercultures – from comics to comedy to film and music – around the globe for decades to come. As a veteran of the comics industry myself and a lifelong fan of EC, it's a tremendous honor to be working alongside the Gaines family to help bring his story – which has an immense amount to tell us about our own modern moment – to a new generation on the big screen.\"\n\n“It’s very important to us to be able to find a partner that truly understands the significance and influence of Dad and the world-class creators that made EC Comics legendary,” said Cathy Mifsud, Gaines’ daughter. “We’re incredibly excited to have found just such a partner in Hivemind and to embark on the first of several projects that will embrace the company’s legacy in ways never before attempted.”\n\nThe EC deal is the latest move by Hivemind, the company behind the acclaimed science-fiction series The Expanse for Amazon and the highly anticipated television adaptation of The Witcher for Netflix, as well as the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark feature film, based on the best-selling book series, from producer/co-writer Guillermo del Toro and director André Øvredal, which arrives in theaters on August 9, 2019. Hivemind recently signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios for event television, and its leadership team includes former Universal Pictures president Sean Daniel, his producing partner Jason Brown, Bad Robot veteran Kathy Lingg, and former Valiant CEO & Chief Creative Officer Dinesh Shamdasani."
