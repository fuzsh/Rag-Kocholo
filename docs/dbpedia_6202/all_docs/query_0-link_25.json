        "text": "While Bill Everett has often been associated with Marvel comics thanks to him being the creator of Namor and the co-creator of Daredevil, he did do some notable works with other companies. For a brief period before working at Marvel, Bill Everett worked as a freelance artist with the short-lived Centaur Publication. It was at Centaur Publication that Everett would create one of his most influential super-hero, Amazing-Man.\n\nThe Centaur’s Year\n\nAmazing-Man, at first, appears to be Centaur Publication’s own Superman clone. However, several aspects makes him more distinct. While Amazing Man has the unoriginal superpower of being at the peak human ability, he can also disappear into a cloud of green mist. His backstory also stands out from his peers. That backstory see a young orphan trained to be a hero by seven Tibetan monks. Afterwards, John Aman goes out into the wider world to do good.\n\nA major snag, however, soon hits the monks’ plan; one of them has gone rogue seeking to use his psychic power to make Amazing-Man his thrall. Now calling himself the Great Question, he telepathically commands various foes to defeat and capture Amazing-Man.\n\nThis state was Amazing-man status quo until 1941, where the only additions being Amazing-Man gaining some civilian allies. With the US’s entrance into the Second World War, Amazing Man would exchange the Great Question for the Axis Powers.\n\nThese adventures would, however, be cut short by Centaur Publications going defunct in 1942. Centaur Publication went primarily thanks to the company’s poor distribution leading to weak sales.\n\nAn Amazing Legacy\n\nDespite the original run of Amazing-Man lasting only three years, several notable superheroes were directly inspired by him. The first being Thunderbolt from Charlton’s Action Heroes line. Thunderbolt even has a similar backstory of being trained to a superhuman level by Tibetan monks.\n\nRoy Thomas seems particularly fond of Amazing Man, with him creating two different heroes inspired by him. The first one being the Iron Fist. The Iron Fist has a similar backstory to Amazing Man in being a white orphan trained to unlock his full potential in a remote temple in the Himalayas. There are some twists to this story, with both the temple being in an alternate dimension and monks having trained him to use a mystical style of martial arts. Also, he has Chi-based energy powers rather than just being at peak human ability.\n\nThe other Roy Thomas creation inspired by Amazing Man is the DC superhero also named Amazing Man. Introduced in All-Star Squadron, William Everett was a former Olympian who received the superpower to mimic whatever material he touches after being caught up in a lab accident. He notably becomes one of the few Black superheroes active in DC’s version of World War II. After his retirement, Everett would see two of his grandson adopt his codename and become superheroes.\n\nDespite his definite influence, It would not be until the 1990s that the original Amazing Man would finally reappear in comics.\n\nMalibu’s Amazing Man\n\nIn 1992, Amazing Man would reappear in Malibu Comics’ The Protectors. Now the Protectors are the premiere superhero team of Malibu’s Genesis line. A line of comics that feature both characters from companies that Malibu had absorbed and from Centaur Comics.\n\nThe series keeps itself mostly faithful to his Golden Age backstory and powers, except that he rarely used his ability to turn into mist. The series also adds a bit to Amazing-Man’s backstory is that his powers make him functionally immortal. The series starts with John Aman willfully staying in a sanitarium out of a fear that he is losing control of his mind. A fear that results from his tendency to fly into a berserker rage. However, Man of War convinces him to join the Protectors under the idea that he would be safer with his fellow superheroes. He also gains a new costume that is very much a product of its time.\n\nAmazing-Man’s fears were, however, justified. Protectors’ final storyline reveals that the Great Question had brainwashed Amazing-Man to serve as his mole. The Great Question then commanded Amazing Man to betray the Protectors. This betrayal set forth a series of events that eventually destroyed the Earth.\n\nThe Prince of Orphan\n\nAmazing Man has the distinct honor of being one of the few public domain superheroes revived by Marvel Comics. Given that this version first appeared during Ed Brubaker’s and Matt Fraction’s Iron Fist relaunch, Amazing Man’s reappearance here is likely the two creators paying homage to one of the Iron Fist’s influences.\n\nWhile this take on Amazing Man shares similar origins to his Golden Age incarnation, his power is slightly different. For one, he now has mystical martial art abilities. This incarnation also has his green mist power being empathized with the power serving as a dominant part of his combat strategy. He is also given a new look with him being a scarred bald man that tends to wear a black cloak. Finally, he has a brand-new code name, the Prince of Orphans.\n\nImmortal Iron Fist introduced the Prince of Orphans as the champion of the other-dimensional city of Z’Gambo in the Seven Capital Cities of Heaven Tournament. It revealed (during the tournament) that he was also an occasional ally of Orson Randall, the previous Iron Fist. He then would serve as an ally of the current Iron Fist after the tournament.\n\nThe character has been in comic book limbo since 2014 and has only played a significant role during Matt Fraction’s run on The Defenders and a tie-in with the Fear Itself crossover.\n\nProject: Superpower\n\nContinuing Project: Superpower’s trend of using every possible public domain hero. Amazing-Man being has appeared in this series. However, he’s only really a cameo as he has only shown up two times during flashbacks to the 40s.\n\nThe Indie Amazing Man\n\nThe most recent development with Amazing Man was him receiving his miniseries from indie publisher Gallant comics. The series treats itself as a retelling of the original Golden Age series. The character’s costume and powers also hew close to his Golden Age original. The main addition from this reimagining is a proper explanation for why a group of Tibetan monks made an American orphan their champion. That explanation is that John Aman is the reincarnation of an ancient Tibetan superhero. This updated origin also connect him with another Golden Age hero with a Himalayan based backstory, the Green Lama\n\nThe series itself sees him taking on the Great Question and examining his connection with a mysterious artifact connected with the origins of superhuman ability. The series also features a ton of cameo from a bunch of other Golden Age heroes.\n\nOne of these cameos will be the focus of our next installment. The crimson female crime fighter Miss Masque.\n\nBefore I get into the article in full, I am warning any reader that this article includes some images that might be considered NFSW.\n\nOver my past month’s experience at writing on comic book history, I’ve concluded. That compared to researching academic history, researching comic book history is not as straightforward.\n\nA great example is the supposed Russian underground superheroine Octobriana. A superhorine whose more well know origin was actually a hoax created by Czech art critic Petr Sadecký for his book, Octobriana and the Russian Underground.\n\nHer “Orgins”\n\nIn 1971, Sadecký published Octobriana and the Russian Underground. In this book, Sadecký recounts a supposed history of Samizdat publications in the USSR. For those curious, Samizdat was an underground form of publication in the USSR that sought to avoid Soviet censorship by reproducing censored material by hand.\n\nThe book recounts first how Sadecký encountered and assisted an underground comic publisher called Progressive Political Pornography. Sadecký then describes the history of the PPP alongside displaying the comics created by them.\n\nOf the strips featured in the book, one stood out. That strip being one that features a scantily clad superheroine named Octobriana. According to the book, the PPP created Octobriana to represent the principles of the Russian Revolution. They depicted her as a fighter for the little man in Russia. Her two main’s foes were the oppressive Soviets and the imperialist Americans.\n\nOctobriania’s origins, as presented by Sadecký, are quite the wild tale. Octobriana was originally named Mahari, a princess of Viking and Toltec royalty. Her people have her immortality through radiation treatments. Sometime later, Octobriana received superpowers from a radioactive volcano. With her newfound powers and immortality, Octobriana travels through time-fighting for the freedom of the oppressed.\n\nWhile Sadecký paints a rather compelling story about Octobrinia and her creation, it was far from the truth.\n\nHer Real Origins\n\nThe strips within the book revealed that Sadecký’s illusions were very fragile. While Sadecký described the character’s story as politically charged, the strip themselves appear to be psychedelic fantasy adventures, with Octobriania’s primary foe being bizarre monsters like a giant radioactive walrus. The only political element to the comic strips was that they identified some of Octobriania’s opponents as Soviet or American. So what was the reason for this disparity between the text and the strips?\n\nThe answer is that Petr Sadecký made the Octobriana strips out of repurposed artwork from a different project involving him. That project is one given the name of Amazona. However, the panel that most claim to feature Octobriania’s real name has an ambiguous syntax. This syntax makes it hard to determine if Amazona refers to a character or the island that story took place on. However, Amazona will be used to refer to this earlier version of Octobriana for simplicity’s sake.\n\nAmazona started in the late 60s when Petr Sadecký convinced notable Czech artist Bohumil Konečný and Zdeněk Burian to help developed a comic for a Swedish publisher. Sadecký pitch the character of Amazona to the artist as a female 007 created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The strips were then completed and later stored in several envelopes, which allowed Sadecký to smuggle the comics into West Germany.\n\nIn early 1967, Petr Sadecký left Czechoslovakia to get Amazona a publisher. In West Germany, Sadecký decided to rework the Amazona strip due to these strips as they were considered too mature to be published as straight superhero comics in the West. Sadecký resolved, around 1968, to rework the comic strips as a political satire to ride the wave of the Underground Comix movement. Sadecký conducted this rework by changing the strips’ script to be more rooted in real-world issues and gave Amazona a prominent red star on her forehead. Sadecký would then send some of his altered artwork back to Konečný, who was concerned that the new political direction of Amazona might kill his career in Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1969, both Konečný and Burian would sue Sadecký to return the Amazona art to them. The two artists would be granted by a West German court the right to reclaim their artwork. However, Sadecký hid some of this artwork and took them with him when he went to England to find a publisher. Sadecký still had trouble finding a publisher until he met with publisher Tom Stacey, who would publish the book. Around this time, Sadecký decided to create a fake backstory for the character to avoid potential legal trouble.\n\nThe Hoax Revealed\n\nThe first suspicion of Octobriania’s true origins began when Czech readers of the book brought attention to the fact that Octobriania’s art looked similar to artwork made by Zdeněk Burian. A fact quite apparent by the creatures in the strips looks like prehistoric animals seen in Buria’s paleoart.\n\nA couple of months after the book was published, an article in the West German Stern magazine confirmed this suspicion. In that article, the reporter revealed that he was contacted by Konečný, who told him the real story behind Octobriana. While a Western publication revealed the story behind Octobriana, the Eastern Bloc press was the only one interested in reprinting it. These reprints would, however, only help to build the myth of Octobriana. This myth-building occurred due to these articles incorporating over-the-top attacks on Sadecký, like claiming that he and one of his associates were gay.\n\nThe needless libel from the Soviet press made most western readers and scholars discount accounts of Octobriania’s real origins. It was not until 1988 that an article about the hoax appeared in an issue Adventures of Luther Arkwright, that Konečný’s story was treated more seriously by Western comic book scholars. Of course, it was not until the rise of the internet in the 2000s that this fact becomes more well known.\n\nFurther Appearance\n\nMost people have an assumption that Octobriana was already in the public domain. This assumption comes from the myth of her being created by an illegal publisher, which means the character has no proper copyright. This perception leads to a variety of creators to form their interpretations of Octobriana.\n\nThe most well-known take on the character was by British artist Bryan Talbot in Adventures of Luther Arkwright. This story reimagines Octobriana as Russian revolutionary fighter fighting against the Czar in an alternate present. She aided Luther and briefly became his Paramore. She later assisted his escape from the disruptors at the Pyramid of Giza. She reappeared briefly at the original series’ end to reveal that she is planning on storming the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg.\n\nAnother notable artist to have a unique take on Octobriana is Underground Comic creator Larry Welz. This take appears in the second issue of Cherry’s Jubilee. In that issue, Octobriana arrives at a protest against the construction of a nuclear plant. At the protest rally, she meets Cherry and her “friend” Ellie. They then witness Octobriana used her native allies and ancient super-science to take out the plant and then take her to the mall.\n\nIn 1996, indie publisher Revolution Comics would give Octobriana her limited series. The series had two strips: One featured the very fictionalize adventures of Octobriana and the PPP in the 1950s, the other strip featured Octobriana’s return to post-Soviet Russia. Interestingly both strips’ writers would work on other indie comics starting Octobriana. The writer of the former strip, Stu Taylor, would write a two-issue miniseries Octobriana Filling in the Blanks in 1997 and “I Fell In Love With A Russian Devil-Woman” from the 1998 anthology Romantic Tails. The letter writer, John A. Short, would become a prolific writer of comics featuring Octobrina.\n\nJohn A. Short would feature Octobriana in Armageddon Patrol: The Shot. A one-shot featuring Short’s creator-owned team, the Armageddon Patrol, having a run-in with Octobriana. He would also write the character in The Octobriana Special that was a one-issue continuation of his strip from the Revolution Comics series. In 2013, Short would feature Octobriana as a part of a superhero team called the New Amazon. In that series, she would notably take on Vladimir Putin.\n\nOctobriana would also appear in more mainstream works like Nikolai Dante, a comic published in 2000 AD. In a future dominated by a tsarist Russia, Nikolai Dante faces off against the seductive assassin named Octobriana. This take is a lot less powerful take on the character with her being a seductive assassin, easily taken out by Dante’s ally Viktor\n\nOctobriana has been relativity quieted in the 2010s, starting the decade with a fail Kickstarter and starting a new one with a successful one. Maybe the new series Octobriana 1976 will spark renewed interest in the series. If it does, that might mean another new chapter in this Octobriania’s long and complicated history.\n\nIn comparison, my next installment will have a more straightforward story to tell. That story is one whose protagonist is Amazing-Man, Bill Everett’s other shirtless hero.\n\nA major issue faced by a public domain superhero is that their name can be legally claimed by another character. Several public domain characters faced the issue of a newer character claiming the name for themselves. While Captain Marvel is the most well-known case, the Lev Gleason Publication character Daredevil is another notable case.\n\nDueling Origins\n\nWhile the Golden Age was not well known for consistency, most of the era’s heroes usually had a consistent origin. Daredevil had two wildly different origins during the Golden age. The first origin is established with Daredevil first appearance in a backup story in Sliver Streak Comics no. 6\n\nDaredevil’s first origin is presented as a tale told to the story’s artist by a man named Captain Cook. In this tale, Cook tells us how a young boy named Bart Hill witnessed his parents’ death by a group of thugs. The murder also branded Bart with a hot iron giving him a boomerang-shaped scar. The experience was so traumatic that Bart ended up mute. Bart swearing vengeance by beginning to train as a master marksman with a boomerang. After completing his training, Bart starts a one-man war on crime and becomes the vigilante Daredevil.\n\nElements of this backstory were quickly drop in his next appearance, with him becoming more talkative and recoloring his costume to the more well-known red and black costume. Despite the redesign, Daredevil became one of Lev Gleason Publications’ most popular characters, getting a solo title less than a year later.\n\nThe solo title adds several notable elements to the Daredevil mythology. In issue 13, Daredevil gain his most memorable supporting cast members in the Newsboys Legion-Esque Little Wise Guys. In Daredevil issue 18, Daredevil received a revamp origins. Bart Hill was now the son of an Australian gold mine owner whose parent was killed by a group of abdominals hired by his evil uncle. Bart was spared and raised as a member of the tribe. Later as a teenager, he took over the tribe from its chief and gained his costume. A couple of years later, Bart returned to “civilization” to avenge his parent by taking down his uncle.\n\nDaredevil would continue his boomerang base war on crime until the late 1940s. The decline in superhero comics’ popularity leads to the Little Wise Guys becoming the star of Daredevil. Daredevil, himself, was written out of the comic in 1950. The comic itself, now solely starting the Little Wise Guys, lasted until 1956.\n\nRevivals Under Pseudonym\n\nDaredevil, like many of his peers, spends a long time in Comic-Book Limbo. Charlton, in the 1960s, would attempt to revive the character. That effort would, however, revamp as a new superhero called Thunderbolt before publication. So Daredevil would have to wait until 1986 to return to comics. His first emergence out of the limbo was in Roy Thomas’s Golden Age homage miniseries Alter Ego. In the series, Daredevil was one of the many publics domain Golden Age heroes to make a cameo. However, due to Marvel creating a more well-known hero called Daredevil, Thomas changes Daredevil’s name to Doubledare.\n\nAC Comics would have a larger revival of the character under the code name of Reddevil. Reddevil was revealed to be imprisoned by the Black Shroud in the Vault of Heroes. In issue 35 of Femforce, Captain Paragon broke Reddevil and his fellow heroes out of it. From then on Reddevil would make cameo throughout the AC comics line. He would found an organization to help his escapes from the Vault of Heroes readjust to the modern-day world. Reddevil would have a one-shot that would see the introduction of AC comics take of the Lev Gleason Publication villain the Claw. After the one-shot Reddevil would continue to appear as a member of the Sentinels of Justice.\n\nPaling with the Dragon\n\nOf the various Golden Age heroes out there, Erik Larsen seems to be fond of Daredevil. He not only wrote and drawn a Daredevil story for his Next Issue Project. Larsen also features Daredevil as a supporting character in his Savage Dragon series. He was reintroduced in the same storyline that I mentioned back in my installment on the Black Terror. Daredevil was among the heroes freed from being used as an energy source for hero turn villain Solarman.\n\nUnlike the Black Terror, Daredevil turned out to be more than a mere cameo. Later issues revealed that the effort to resettle the various freed heroes had led to Daredevil moving into Savage Dragon’s home city of Chicago. The Little Wise Guys were also revealed to have been freed from Solar Man. Daredevil would continue to play a supporting role throughout the comics, becoming a close ally of Savage Dragon and later his children after his death.\n\nThe Suit Makes The Man\n\nThe other major 21st-century revival of Daredevil was in the series Project Superpower. In this series, Daredevil is renamed as the Death-Defying Devil is one of the superheroes released from the Urn of the Pandora after being imprisoned during the Second World War. For reasons later revealed, Daredevil could no longer speak like his original incarnation. In the original series, he plays a supporting role in helping the other heroes fight off the F-Troop and investigate the potential connection between the terrorist organization the Claw and the villain of the same name.\n\nHe would receive his own four issue spin-off in 2008 by Joe Casey, that sought to answer the mystery of Daredevil’s muteness. The answer is quite strange. The series both reveals that Daredevil’s costume was sentient and mystical and that it was imprisoned in the Urn, instead of Bart Hill.\n\nThis sentient costume version of Daredevil would continue to appear in the two other Project Superpowers series. He also received another series in 2018 with Gail Simone as the writer.\n\nOther appearance\n\nDaredevil would make some other appearance throughout the 2010s. Dynamite Comics featured an alternate version of Daredevil in the series Codename: Action that reimages several obscure spy comic characters and pulp characters during the height of the Cold War.\n\nThe character would also be a part of Antarctic Press entry in the Golden Age revival industry with him starting in a three part serial in the company revival of Exciting Comics. Due to copyright reason, the character is renamed as Darkdevil.\n\nDespite having the same name as a well-known marvel heroes, the original Daredevil is still around fighting crime with a boomerang. Come back after Christmas to see talk about a public domain superhero not from the Golden Age, the Russian underground hoax Octobriaina.\n\nIn this chapter of Evolution of a Public Domain Superhero, we take a look at one of the earliest and strangest superheroine Fantomah: The Mystery Woman of the Jungle.\n\nThe Hanks’ Version\n\nFantomah’s first appearance was in Fiction House’s Jungle Comics no.3, in a story written and drawn by infamous Golden Age artist Fletcher Hanks. In this story, she is the mysterious guardian of an elephant graveyard. Who watches two ivory hunter attempt to locate a local ruler’s dying elephant and then betray another out of greed. The only thing establish is that Fantomah is a mysterious ghostly figure whose face can either be that of a beautiful woman or a skeletal monster. Fantomah’s physical appearance combined with her signature black dress made her stand in a comic filled with many other queens of the jungle.\n\nLater stories would establish Fantomah as a jungle goddess of vengeance with powerful mystical ability. Fantomah would use this power to wreak karmic punishment on those that disrespect the unnamed African jungle she called home. Most Hanks penned Fantomah’s story were formulaic of a villain trying to destroy part of the jungle or steal something from it, and Fantomah would punish them.\n\nThe Post Hanks Version\n\nWhen Fletcher Hanks left the comic books industry in 1941, Fantomah was the only one of his characters to continue to appear in the Golden Age after Hank’s retirement. The unknown creative team that replaces Hanks would tone would down Fantomah to a regular Sheena-clone with some mystical power. Interestingly the first post-Hanks story did try to make Fantomah look like she under Hank, but with a more revealing swimsuit design.\n\nIn March 1942, Fantomah was retcon to be the princess of a lost civilization with ties to Ancient Egypt. Beyond the new backstory, she also gains a new Egyptian queen inspired get-up and a panther companion named Fury. Interestingly this incarnation of Fantomah was the longest-lasting, with this status quo lasting until Fantomah’s last Golden Age appearance in Jungle Comics no. 51 in 1944.\n\nPost-Golden Age Fantomah\n\nUnlike many of her Golden Age peer, it wasn’t until the 21st century that would be any effort to revived Fantomah. Beyond some reprint in AC various reprint titles and a cameo in a group shot in Femforce, Fantomah would not return to comic until 2009.\n\nGiven her more horrific demeanor, Fantomah would be a natural in a horror comic. Writer Time Steely agreed with that sentiment and featured the character in several issues of Hack/Slash. The Hack/Slash incarnation of Fantomah is similar to her Fletcher Hanks incarnation, but with an actual backstory. The series revealed that in the Hack/Slash universe, Fantomah was one of the few superheroes to have superpowers but was at some point imprisoned by a group of evil scientists using her only weakness, Black Ambrosia (an important element of the series mythology). These scientists then used her essence to empower various individuals. She was then later freed by Cassie Hack. The freed Fantomah then punish the scientists and go her merry way.\n\nShe would make one other appearance, where she enlisted Cassie to help her avenge her fallen Jungle. This story also reveals that Fantomah was an individual empowered by the Jungle to protect it. This story concluded with Fantomah losing her power due to the Jungle’s disappointment with her failure. It would then briefly give Cassie Hack this power, but she rejected it.\n\nThe next notable depiction of Fantomah in modern comics was in the Dynamite Comics crossover series Pathfinder: Worldscape, where she serves as an ally for the heroes. She is depicted as a literal goddess of the Jungle, only involved in the series plot as Kulan Gath threatens her Jungle. This series also placed an interesting limit on Fantomah’s power, being that her powers would only work in the Jungle.\n\nWhile the previous two depictions of Fantomah keep her close to her Fletcher Hanks incarnation, Chapterhouse Press went with a full reinvention of the character. The series Fantomah reimagines her as a spirit of vengeance inspired by Mexican folklore. This incarnation of Fantomah is notable in that it’s the only version of Fantomah with an established backstory. This incarnation is 24-year barista Paz Gallos who came back to life after being pushed off a bridge by a local gang and drowning. She is now a local spirit of vengeance-seeking the gang that killed her and looking for her missing younger sister. Despite her being depicted as radically different from the original Fantomah. She does appear after her resurrections visually similar to Hanks’s vision of the character. Beyond this miniseries, this take on Fantomah would appear in a crossover with various Chapterhouse Press character\n\nDespite her memorableness, Fantomah has seen less reinvention compare to other Golden Age characters. This lack of reinvention is likely because her premise of an all-powerful god-like figure that protects her jungle with a fierce vengeance is more appreciatable now. Despite recent efforts, Fantomah is a public domain character that deserves more reinterpretation.\n\nNow, speaking of bizarrely awesome Golden Age character. Come back for my next installment as I cover the boomerang wielding Daredevil.\n\n.\n\nWhile the Black Terror’s public domain status is a non-issue, there are many superheroes with more complex legal status. For example, in this column’s installment, we look at a superhero who is in the public domain, but his alter ego is not. That superhero being the Dan Garret incarnation of the Blue Beetle.\n\nTrend Following at Fox\n\nThe Blue Beetle was created in 1939 by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski for Fox Syndicate Feature for Mystery Men Comics #1. Wojtkowski admits to creating the character to cash in on the popularity of Green Hornet, a fact very obvious from his costume’s appearance in Mystery Men Comics #1. This story doesn’t establish much about the Blue Beetle. The things were that the Blue Beetle is secretly patrolman Dan Garret who takes on a mask identity to take on criminals above his pay grade.\n\nThe Blue Beetle quickly become one of Fox’s popular superhero. He soon gains his solo title within a year. The solo title would establish his origin of avenging his father (who was killed by the mob while working as a cop), his distinctive bulletproof costume, and his Golden age supporting cast. The Blue Beetle, around this time, also had a comic strip drawn by Jack Kirby and a radio show.\n\nDespite being popular in his own right, Fox changed the Blue Beetle to follow larger trends. For example, relativity early in his solo series, the Blue Beetle gains superhuman strength and stamina through ingesting Vitamin 2X. At the onset of World War Two, Garret became a government agent and the Blue Beetle an enemy of the Axis power. After the war, The Blue Beetle went back to fighting domestic crime. By this point, however, editorial oversight diminishes for the Blue Beetle’s comics leading to his power to vary widely from story to story.\n\nBy the late 1940s, with the rise of horror and crime comics, the Blue Beetle has returned to his root of being a masked vigilante with no superpower. This return to the character’s root was, however, not enough to save the character, from the general decline in the market for superhero comics, with the Blue Beetle solo comic being canceled in 1950. By this point, the Blue Beetle served mostly as a narrator for non-superhero crime stories in his comics.\n\nHowever, only five years later, the Blue Beetle would return\n\nThe Charlton Reinvention\n\nIn 1955, The Blue Beetle had a four-issue reprint title by Charlton Comics. This circumstance for this reprint is interesting, as it was created during Charlton’s acquisition period. This period refers to Charlton’s mid-1950s was spent buying out characters and titles from various publishers going under during the decline of the comic book market during the 1950s. When Fox Syndicate Feature went under, Charlton swooped up the right for the Blue Beetle.\n\nWhile there’s a good possibility that this reprint series was created for legal reasons, it also possible that it made of been made to test the waters for relaunching the character during the company’s briefly lived effort to have a superhero line in the 1950s. However, beyond this reprint series, the Blue Beetle would continue to slumber in Comic-Book Limbo.\n\nThe Blue Beetle would make a proper comeback under Charlton, but not as in a familiar form. In 1964, Charlton decided to revive the character for their Action Hero line of comics. While sharing the same costume and real name as the original Blue Beetle, the 1964 revival shared little else with his Golden Age incarnation. Dan Garret, the patrolman was now Dan Garrett, an Egyptian archeologist.\n\nThe new Charlton Blue Beetle also features an entirely new powerset. Thanks to a mystic scarab found at an Egyptian archeological dig, Dan Garret could obtain your standard set of superpowers (super strength, flight, energy blasts, by saying the magic words “Kalji Dha.”\n\nThis all-new, all different Blue Beetle did not last long, lasting only two years. In 1966 in Steve Ditko was given free rein to revamp the character and decide to create a whole new bearer to the Blue Beetle name, Ted Kord. Interestingly despite having a whole new secret identity, Ditko’s take on the Blue Beetle was closer in concept to the Golden Age Blue Beetle, if a bit more gadget heavy. Dan Garett only made one appearance during this era in Ted Kord’s origin story. In the second issue of this Blue Beetle’s solo title, it was revealed that Dan Garett died saving his former student Ted Kord’s life from Ted’s uncle’s army of evil androids. A dying Garett gives Kord the responsibility of being the Blue Beetle but was buried by the collapsing lab before he could give Ted the scarab.\n\nThe Ted Kord lead Blue Beetle series would last until 1967 when Charlton decided to leave the Superhero business. He would return briefly in the early 1980s alongside a larger revival of the Action Heroes, but Charlton went bankrupt before anything came out of it.\n\nA Short Stop at AC Comics\n\n\\For a short period in 1983, AC comics had the license to publish comic books featuring Charlton’s Action Heroes. Due to Dan Garrett’s role in Ted Kord’s origin, he would make a single appearance in AC comics. The third issue of Americomics features two stories featuring the Dan Garret incarnation of the Blue Beetle. In the first story, Ted Kord fights an evil duplicate of Dan Garrett, in what is an unpublished story from the early 80s revival of the character. The second story appears to be the prelude for a revamp of the Dan Garrett incarnation of the Blue Beetle. In this story, it is revealed that Dan Garrett is a reincarnation of Dan Garret as a result of the machination of a mysterious group of gods, who were also responsible for the mystic scarab. After this reveal, the newly reincarnated Dan Garrett saves Ted Kord’s life again. The story ends with Ted Kord giving Dan back the title of Blue Beetle.\n\nThis status quo only existed for three issues, as AC comics lost the licenses to Charlton’s Action Hero as it was sold for a more profitable price to DC comics the same year. Unlike some AC comics characters who had right overlap with DC comics like the Phantom Lady, AC decided to not just simply renamed their take on the Blue Beetle.\n\nD.G at the D.C\n\nDue to DC deciding that Steve Ditko’s run on Blue Beetle was a broad stroke sort of canon for the Post-Crisis DC universe. The DC Blue Beetle series established that the DC universe version of Ted Kord receives the codename of Blue Beetle from Dan Garrett in a similar circumstance to his Charlton’s incarnation.\n\nDespite being based on the Charlton incarnation, the DC incarnation was later established to be one post-crisis Golden age hero. Which makes the DC version of the character a fusion of the two incarnations of the character.\n\nBeyond cameos and his granddaughter being a supporting cast member of the Jamie Reyes incarnation of the Blue Beetle, DC has only used the Dan Garret incarnation of the Blue Beetle in one notable storyline. That storyline, from the Post-Crisis Blue Beetle title, features Ted Kord taking on a crazed resurrected by the Scarab Dan Garrett.\n\nDan Garret with a single T\n\nWhen it comes to superhero’s legal status, the original Blue Beetle has a quite strange one. While the superhero title of Blue Beetle is owned by DC Comics, the character of Dan Garret is in the public domain. This weird legal status has to lead to less utilization of the Blues Beetle in comics compare to contemporary like the Black Terror.\n\nOne of the notable non-DC appearances of Dan Garret is in Dynamic Comics’ Project Superpower in the first issue as one of the heroes contemptuous to the 1940s, but for legal reason is called the Big Blue. The series also introduced an original character called the Scarab that was heavily influenced by the Charlton to take on Dan Garret and Ted Kord.\n\nBeyond that, the only other use of Dan Garret as a public domain superhero is in Gallant Comics reboot of Amazing-Man. Again likely thanks to the Blue Beetle more legally dubious nature make him a character not, many company’s willing to use this character\n\nSince we’re two for two on superheroes, join me next week as we cover the golden age superheroine, the horrifying Fantomah.\n\nWelcome to the second column of Four Color History, Evolution of a Public Domain Super Hero. This column will provide an overview of how different companies reinterprets Superheroes in the public domain.\n\nIn my first installment, I will look at the most visually interesting Superman rip-off, the Black Terror.\n\nThe Black Terror was created for Nedor Comics, a comic imprint of Pines Publications, by Richard E. Hughes and Don Gabrielson for Exciting Comics issue number nine (January 1941).\n\nThe self-proclaimed Nemesis of Crime was a mild-mannered Pharmacist named Bob Benton, who sought to develop a tonic that could help people feeling “run down.” He, however, ran into trouble as the local mob sought to shake him down for protection money. At a loss, Benton finds a solution to his mob problem thanks to his young assistant Tim Rolland accidentally adding red ant formic acid into his tonic. The formic acid changed the tonic to allow whoever drinks it to gain enhanced strength and endurance.\n\nBob and Tim having drunk the tonic soon become the crime-fighting duo the Terror Twins and dealt with the local mobs. Afterwards they would face both regular criminals and various Axis-aligned super villains like the Nazi mad scientist Throg.\n\nThe Black Terror soon afterwards become Nedor’s most popular character ,with him not only headlining Exciting Comics, but also the anthology title America’s Best Comics and his quarterly solo title.\n\nHowever, the good times could not last as Black Terror was one of the many Golden Age Superhero to see their sales decline in the years following World War Two. In 1949, Nedor canceled all of the comics featuring Black Terror. These cancelations were likely the result of Pines Publications consolidating Nedor Comics with fellow publisher mate Better Comics into a singular publishing imprint called Standard Comics. that year.\n\nAfter having all of his comics canceled, the Black Terror entered Comic Book Limbo for nearly 35 years.\n\nIn 1983 AC comics, a publisher that got started reprinting public domain comic books, would make the first attempt in reviving the Black Terror.\n\nIn Americomics issue 2, the Black Terror was brought back as an older incarnation of the original Nedor incarnation called the Terror for copyright reason. In a story starting the Shade, a hero from AC comics predecessor Paragon Publishing, we meet an older Black Terror who has declare a one-man war on the mob after his wife was killed in a tragic reprise of his origin story.\n\nBy his second AC appearance, The Terror has become cynical in his never-ending struggle against crime and focus solely on avenging his dead wife. This lead to him teaming up with a Japanese crime lord and renaming himself as the Terrorist. Afterwards this version of the Black Terror would be a recurring antagonist in the AC superhero universe, having appeared as recently as 2012\n\nAround the time that he broke bad in the AC universe, the Black Terror would also make a cameo in Roy Thomas’s homage to non-big two Golden Heroes Alter Ego.\n\nAround this time, small indie publisher Darkline comic had their own revival of the Black Terror. In this revival, Bob Benton has lost the ability to to age thanks to the tonic that gave him his power. Now in the 1980s, Bob has come out of retirement as Terror Knight to start a new war on crime.\n\nThe last of the eighties revival of the Black Terror was by Eclipse Comics. This revival only lasted for only three issues and compared to the previous two revival was a complete reboot of the character. So much of a reboot that the Black Terror’s real name is no longer Bob Benton. This miniseries was a radical reinvention of the character, with him now being a masked FBI agent with no superpowers.\n\nThe 90s were a quiet decade for the Black Terror, beyond some appearances in the AC universe. The 2000s,however, would see some top talent in the industry take a crack of the character.\n\nThe first Black Terror revival of the 21st century was in Alan Moore’s Tom Strong series. In the series’ eleventh issue, we’re introduced to the world of Terra Obscura. Now Terra Osbcura is an alternate version of Earth inhabited by the Superheroes of Nedor Comic. The Black Terror has a slightly different origins from his original comic incarnation. The main different being that Bob Benton inhaled the Formic acid through a lab accident. Also his costume was stated to influenced by a book on pirates.\n\nThis incarnation of the Black Terror died shortly after his first appearance defending Earth from an alien invasion. Bob, however, had his mind digitized shortly after his death. This digitized copy of the Black Terror’s mind would serve as the basis for a computer program called Terror 2000.\n\nAs Terror 2000, he creates an army of robots to fight crime in Invertica City. However, like most revivals of the Black Terror, this one also turns evil. In this case, Terror 2000 murdered Tim Roland in a plot to gain time travel as a tool in his war on crime.\n\nAround the same time, the Black Terror made some cameos in the works of Erik Larson. Most notable showing up in crowd shot in Next Issue no. 1. He also shows as a cameo up in Savage Dragon as one of the superheroes imprisoned by the rouge superhero Solarman.\n\nA larger revival of the Black Terror occurred in Alex Ross’s Project Superpower. In this series, Black Terror has a similar history to his Golden Age incarnation. However, in 1945, the Black Terror, along with several other heroes, was imprisoned in Pandora’s Urn by the Fighting Yank to prevent the Nazis from unleashing the evil contained in it.\n\nWhen he and fellow heroes were released in 2008, he initially wanted to kill Fighting Yank for tricking him into the urn. He, however, decided to bury the hatchet to deal with Dynamic Man and his Supremacy.\n\nThis incarnation of the Black Terror is also notable for being the star of the first comic to feature the Black Terror as the lead since the late 1980s. This incarnation has an ongoing series in 2009 and a five-issue miniseries in 2019.\n\nThis incarnation of the Black Terror is notable for going full-in on the pirate influences on the character. His ongoing notably feature him gaining a flying ship, and a new parrot inspired sidekick. He also uniquely utilizes a sword in his fighting style.\n\nThe Project Superpower incarnation of the Black Terror is not the only take that Dynamite Entertainment has done with the character, with a take closer to his original depiction being feature in the Pulp crossover series Masks .\n\nThis ends the first article of Evolution of a Public Domain Super Hero. Joins me in around a week as I cover the Dan Garret incarnation of the Blue Beetle."
