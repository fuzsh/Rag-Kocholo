        "text": "By d. emerson eddy — Promethea is one of my favorite comic series. Ostensibly it got its genesis with some of the same ideas as Alan Moore's work on Glory, concepts rooted in the archetypes and mythologies surrounding warrior women in fiction like Wonder Woman, but as it became realized in the America's Best Comics imprint, it became so much more. It worked its way through the standard trappings of “science hero” fiction to become a love letter and guidebook to art, storytelling, imagination, and magick. Although there are countless highlights along the way, I think one of the issues where it all comes together quite literally was in Promethea #14 from Moore, JH Williams III, Mick Gray, Jeromy Cox, and Todd Klein.\n\n“Moon River” was technically the second chapter in this broader story-arc, kicking off Promethea's quest to find her friend and previous Promethea, Barbara, but it set the framework for what would largely come in the remainder of this arc. It was a foundation rather fitting for a story set in/at Yesod. The story uses the Hermetic conception of the Tree of Life as its roadmap for existence beyond the material plane, allowing Moore to essentially give his own interpretation of correspondences and allusions for magick and reality. (There is a lot more to the Tree of Life than just a repository for connections and attributions that tend to feature in ceremonial magick's appropriation of the form, I recommend studying the actual Jewish Kabbalah to see the splendor of its manifestation.) Though you don't need to worry if you don't know anything about it going in, Moore's dialogue gives more than enough explanations to enjoy the story on its own.\n\nWhat makes the story transcendent, elevating it far beyond a narrative version of Aleister Crowley's 777 is the absolutely incredible visual feast delivered by JH Williams III, Mick Gray, Jeromy Cox, and Todd Klein. Hints of the heights that this art team could reach were presented earlier in the series, particularly in the tarot issue (#12, which also featured art from Jose Villarrubia), but this Moon issue took it to another level. Not only did Williams incorporate the bevy of references and cameos that fit with the story, but the entire issue took on the form of a flow down a river. Double-page spreads flowed one into the next, with a ribbon of panels cutting across to end and begin at connecting points were you to piece them together, as structure of story changes to service the location and themes of the sphere of Yesod.\n\nAlong with the blue and yellow color scheme from Jeromy Cox, with many pages emanating a lunar glow, the art here is gorgeous. And it just scratches the surface of what will come as the story continues along higher up the Tree towards godhead. Williams, Gray, Cox, and Klein were great storytellers going into this story-arc, they proved as it went on, weaving through differing styles and approaches as it fit the themes of the locations, that they are among the absolute best in the industry.\n\nPromethea is a journey into imagination and a world beyond our mundane conceptions. It's about storytelling and the stories that we tell in order to make up our existence. In Promethea #14 that foundation on imagination becomes a literal part of the story as Moore, Williams, Gray, Cox, and Klein show us exactly what comics can do when you tap into that imagination.\n\nPrometha #14\n\nPromethea #14\n\nWriter: Alan Moore\n\nPenciller: JH Williams III\n\nInker: Mick Gray\n\nColorist: Jeromy Cox\n\nLetterer: Todd Klein\n\nPublisher: DC Comics / Wildstorm - America's Best Comics\n\nSophie is reunited with Barbara as her road-trip odyssey into the Immateria continues.
