        "text": "A new graphic novel imprint, HarperAlley, is to be launched by HarperCollins Childrens Books, with the first of thirty titles per year to go live in Q3 2020.\n\nDespite being an arm of HarperCollins Children’s Books, HarperAlley will be for readers of all ages, says the press release, and the imprint intends to be a\n\ncollaborative, creator-focused publisher.\n\nHarperAlley’s editorial director will be Andrew Arnold, a former art director and acquiring editor at First Second, Macmillan’s graphic novel imprint. Arnold said in a press release,\n\nWitnessing the rise of the graphic novel over the past 15 years has been amazing. Cartoonists continue to inspire, challenge, and push the form in unexpected directions.\n\nArnold added that the imprint is,\n\nlooking to publish books that readers of all ages can enjoy, from the youngest readers to teens and adults. We believe that a good story is a story that any reader can relate to. That’s what we mean when we say “readers of all ages.”\n\nTitle acquisition is already underway and, significantly, HarperAlley will be looking to bring translated European and foreign-language content to the US market.\n\nThe news comes a week before the San Diego Comic Con, one of the largest comics events in the US, opens July 17-21.\n\nThe comics and graphic novels sector is one of the fastest growing and most vibrant elements of the global publishing industry, driven by Manga and anime as well as the superhero market, but extending across many traditional publishing genres.\n\nBy way of example, Gizmodo is carrying a post titled 10 Most Exciting Panels Happening at San Diego and alongside the usual suspects like Batman and Marvel Studios are His Dark Materials, Westworld, The Witcher, Star Trek.…\n\nRecent comics coverage from TNPS:\n\nComics snapshot: Italy’s Treviso Comic Book Festival set for September. Graphite – a new comics streaming platform. A comics revival in Myanmar\n\nPortugal’s 15th Beja International Comics Festival coincides with the Lisbon Book Fair where more than 500,000 visitors are expected\n\nKa-Pow! Marvel partners with Dreamscape to produce superhero audiobooks from classic Marvel comics"
