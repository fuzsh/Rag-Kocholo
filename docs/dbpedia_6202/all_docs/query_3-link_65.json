        "text": "TOON Books represent a whole new approach to books for beginning and reluctant readers—a rethinking as radical as the first time Theodor Geisel put a hat on a cat. Each book is just right for reading to the youngest child, but this is also the first and only collection ever designed to offer early and reluctant readers comics they can read themselves.\n\nEach TOON book has been vetted by educators to nurture young minds.​The comic format helps every child master core reading comprehension strategies like Visualization & Imagining, Making Connections, or Retelling.\n\nWith TOON Books, parents, caregivers, homeschoolers, teachers, and librarians can help every child become a lifelong reader, one who knows how to read for pleasure and for information—a reader who loves to read. ​\n\n​\"Comics are a gateway drug to literacy.\"\n\n—Art Spiegelman, Pulitzer-Prize winning author of Maus, A Survivor's Tale\n\nOwen says, “No,” but, before long, it’s, “Um…Mom…I gotta go!” He really should have listened and gone when he had a chance. Now, he’s squirming. Even thinking of something else isn’t helping. Luckily for him, grampa knows exactly what to do; he’s had a lot of practice over the years. He teaches Owen the best way to hold the urge off for just long enough, with the help of some fun and funky dance moves: the Tinkle Twist, the Wee-wee walk, the Piddle Patter, and the Leaky shake. Before long, Owen’s jumping in with some moves of his own! Artist Frank Viva, the acclaimed author of A Trip to the Bottom of the World with Mouse and Young Frank, Architect, doesn't mind getting his feet wet as he dives into what can be a harrowing topic for children—and grampas—turning it into a hilarious, liberating, and joyful romp.\n\nFrank Viva's TOON Graphic ​Sea Change and Level 1 A Trip to the Top of the Volcano with Mouse join the previously released A Trip to the Bottom of the World with Mouse as affordable, but still beautifully produced softcovers. With A Trip to the Top of the Volcano with Mouse earning an Eisner nomination and Sea Change garnering praise from multiple starred reviews and authors like Lemony Snicket, both are sure to gain permanent placement on your shelf!\n\nIn Paul Bunyan: The Invention of an American Legend, cartoonist Noah Van Sciver heads back to Minnesota in 1914 to uncover the creation of an American myth. The book takes place during a snowy train journey, when W. B. Laughead, a real-life advertising impresario employed by Minnesota’s Red River Timber Company, spins a yarn for his fellow travelers.In Laughead’s hands, a regional folk figure grows tall enough to touch the clouds, becoming the star of a colorful tale of frontier life that has obscured, for too long, the logging industry’s wholesale devastation of the region’s old-growth forests and its role in the systematic dispossession of Native peoples from their land and way of life.​\n\nThe caterpillar is on its way to one of the most magical transformations in the insect world, from a crawling digestive tube to a fluttering Glasswing, Luna moth, or Monarch. In Caterpillars: What Will I be When I Get to be Me?, the latest addition to KEVIN MCCLOSKEY’s beloved Giggle and Learn series, young readers will explore how caterpillars morph into the many different moths and butterflies that help pollinate our world."
