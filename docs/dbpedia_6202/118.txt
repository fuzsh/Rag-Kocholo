American publisher Ned Pines created Pines Publishing and started out as a Publisher of the Thrilling Group brand of Pulp Magazines in 1928. In 1939 Ned Pines and Pines Publishing entered the comics field under the Standard Comics imprint. Standard in turn was the parent company of two comic-book lines: Better Publications and Nedor Publishing, sometimes referred to as "Standard/Better/Nedor".

In business from 1939 to 1956, Standard was a prolific publisher during the Golden Age of comic books. The Better and Nedor imprints were consolidated as the Standard Comics line, with a "Standard Comics" flag-like cover logo. The titles previously had no publisher logo. In 1956, Standard ended and only two titles continued, published by Pines Comics.

Beginning in the 1980s, Standard/Better/Nedor characters have been revived by other publishers:
