While it wasn’t a huge hit — it closed after 289 performances — a new touring version lands at St. Paul’s Ordway Center for the Performing Arts for a run from Dec. 28 through Jan. 2. It’s a stylish production based on a woman who broke barriers and set the stage for female performers who followed, Ordway producing director Rod Kaats says.\n\nEven when they don’t work on Broadway, Jukebox musicals tend to do well on the road, often playing to fans of the featured artist rather than to just theater buffs. As such, we’ve seen plenty of them performed in the metro over the years.\n\nTo welcome “Summer” to town, here’s a look at some of the most memorable (not always in a good way) jukebox musicals, along with thoughts from Pioneer Press theater critics about each show.\n\n‘MAMMA MIA’\n\nThe backstory: British producer Judy Craymer first envisioned the musical when she worked with ABBA songwriters Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson in 1983 on Tim Rice’s “Chess.” In particular, she thought the group’s song “The Winner Takes It All” was perfect for the stage.\n\nThe ABBA pair wasn’t super enthusiastic about the project, but Craymer kept it in the back of her mind and eventually convinced Ulvaeus and Andersson to give her rights to their music. “Mamma Mia” — which uses ABBA’s songs to tell the story of a young woman who schemes to find the identity of her father — opened in London in 1999 to instant acclaim.\n\nIn its first two decades, “Mamma Mia” has been staged in more than 50 countries on six continents and has played to more than 65 million people, grossing $4 billion worldwide. The Broadway version ran 14 years, making it the ninth-longest-running show in Broadway history. The 2008 film version grossed $611 million worldwide and inspired a hit sequel. Locally, Chanhassen Dinner Theatres’ take on the show was the company’s biggest smash ever and ran for nearly a full year.\n\nOur take: “Yeah, it’s a bit corny, but British playwright Catherine Johnson did a magnificent job of weaving together unrelated pop songs to fuel a smartly paced, good-natured story that feels more like a celebration than just another musical. There’s rarely a dull moment in it, with rousing, high-energy set pieces strategically placed throughout the show.” (March 11, 2019; Chanhassen Dinner Theatres).\n\n(The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts also staged “Mamma Mia” in 2018.)\n\n‘JERSEY BOYS’\n\nThe backstory: The success of “Mamma Mia” ushered in a tidal wave of jukebox musicals hoping to capture that same magic. “Jersey Boys” is the closest to hitting that goal, thanks in part to its terrific songs.\n\nThe Four Seasons scored a string of hits in the ’60s, including the chart-toppers “Sherry,” “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” “Walk Like a Man” and “Rag Doll.” In 1975, the band returned to the charts with the disco-era hits “Who Loves You” and “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night).”\n\nThe were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, but the Four Seasons’ origin story wasn’t well known to the public, nor were any members beyond lead singer Frankie Valli. That all changed with “Jersey Boys,” which tells the group’s history via four “seasons,” each narrated by a different member of the band.\n\nThe show’s 12-year Broadway run kicked off in 2005 and worldwide tours have kept the show in front of appreciative audiences. That said, the 2014 film adaptation, which was directed and produced by Clint Eastwood, was a disappointment, earning mixed reviews and grossing $67 million.\n\nOur take: “That these nearly 50-year-old pop tunes can still jolt a crowd is a testament to the enduring power of the music.” (April 24, 2011; Orpheum Theatre).\n\n‘WE WILL ROCK YOU’\n\nThe backstory: Queen’s manager started talking about a musical with the band’s surviving members soon after the 1991 death of lead singer Freddie Mercury. Initially, the idea was to use the songs to tell Mercury’s life story. At one point, Robert De Niro’s production company expressed interest, but ultimately declined to pick it up due to difficulties with the storyline.\n\nIn 2000, band members approached British actor and playwright Ben Elton to craft an original story with the songs, which include “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Killer Queen,” “Somebody to Love,” “I Want to Break Free,” “Under Pressure,” “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” and “We Are the Champions.”\n\nElton’s story of a dystopian future where rock ‘n’ roll saves the world earned savage reviews from the critics when it opened at London’s Dominion Theatre in 2002, with the Daily Mirror suggesting “Ben Elton should be shot for this risible story.” But audiences turned it into a record-breaking hit that spent a dozen years at the Dominion. It never made it to Broadway, but “We Will Rock You” has been staged across the world.\n\nOur take: “After waiting for two hours and 30 minutes and all the way through the curtain call for the inevitable performance of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ the cast did manage to bring the audience to its feet. It was a good but not great version, an apt ending for a show that ultimately fails to deliver on the potential of its material.” (Nov. 21, 2013; Orpheum Theatre).\n\n‘LOVE, JANIS’\n\nThe backstory: In 1992, Laura Joplin published “Love, Janis,” a biography of her late sister Janis, who was considered by some as the first true female rock star. The book inspired a jukebox musical of the same name.\n\nJoplin rose to fame as the vocalist for the San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. After recording two records with Big Brother, she went solo with 1969’s “I Got Dem Ol’ Kozmic Blues Again Mama.” Her second album, “Pearl,” topped 4 million in sales, but she was never able to enjoy that success. Joplin died of a heroin overdose in October 1970, three months before “Pearl” hit the shelves.\n\n“Love, Janis” debuted Off-Broadway in 2001 and ran for more than 700 performances. It has since been staged regionally, including at St. Paul’s Ordway Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nOur take: “For diehard fans of Janis Joplin, ‘Love, Janis’ will seem like a pleasant ride on the Wayback Machine … (but) this is not a good piece of theater.” (Feb. 16, 2007; Ordway).\n\n‘ROCK OF AGES’\n\nThe backstory: Given its title, one would assume the ’80s rock musical jukebox would feature the 1983 Def Leppard smash of the same name. It does not (the record label wouldn’t give permission), but instead uses songs from Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister, Steve Perry, Poison and Europe to tell the story of an aspiring rock star and his girlfriend, who hopes to become a Hollywood star.\n\nAfter premiering in 2005 at a Hollywood nightclub similar to the one in the musical, “Rock of Ages” landed on Broadway in 2009 and enjoyed a run of 22 previews and 2,328 performances. The 2012 film version starring Tom Cruise fared less well with mixed reviews and a mere $59 million gross.\n\nOur take: “It’s a big, loud show, unapologetically bawdy and absolutely giddy in own vapidity … ‘Rock of Ages’ is, for all of its cheese and corn, monumentally entertaining.” (Oct. 21, 2010; Orpheum Theatre).\n\n‘MOVIN’ OUT’\n\nThe backstory: Legendary dancer and choreographer Twyla Tharp conceived and created this musical set to the tunes of Billy Joel.\n\nIt’s not a traditional musical, however, as Tharp stages a series of dance sequences linked by a thin plot about a generation of youth growing up in Long Island during the 1960s. The characters are drawn from Joel’s songs, including Brenda and Eddie (“Scenes from an Italian Restaurant”), James (“James”), Judy (“Why Judy Why”) and Tony (“Movin’ Out”).\n\nIt premiered on Broadway in 2002 and ran for 28 previews and 1,303 performances.\n\nOur take: “As far as jukebox musicals go, ‘Movin’ Out’ is characterized mostly by what it does right. It delivers the songs audiences want to hear. It entertains on it own merits. And it successfully crossbreeds dance, popular music and theater into a vibrant, hybrid and unique art form.” (Aug. 5, 2005; Orpheum Theatre).\n\n‘FELA!’\n\nThe backstory: Born to intellectual, middle-class Nigerian parents who sent him abroad to study medicine, Fela Kuti instead dove head-first into music. Throughout the ’60s, Kuti lived in England, Ghana and the United States, perfecting what would become Afrobeat, a form that combined traditional African folk with Western jazz and funk.\n\nKuti created music on his own terms, issuing nearly four dozen records in his lifetime, many containing merely a pair of 12-plus-minute, trance-like songs, one on each side of a vinyl album. He resisted efforts to break down his music and make it more palatable to non-African audiences, a point of pride highlighted in “Fela!”\n\nWith financial backing from superstar rapper Jay-Z and Hollywood power couple Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, “Fela!” ran on Broadway from October 2009 to January 2011 and then hit the road for a tour with much of the cast and crew intact.\n\nOur take: “Fela Kuti was many things – a groundbreaking musician, a political dissident and an outsized hedonist. As is evidenced by the exclamation point in its title, ‘Fela!’ portrays the late Nigerian icon as a renegade superhero in an exhilarating and exhausting show that’s part origin story, part jukebox musical and part singing and dancing showcase.” (June 14, 2012; Ordway).\n\n‘BEAUTIFUL: THE CAROLE KING MUSICAL’\n\nThe backstory: Carole King famously began her career as a staff writer at the Brill Building, writing or co-writing classic pop songs like “One Fine Day,” “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin,’ ” “On Broadway,” “The Loco-Motion,” “Take Good Care of My Baby” and “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.”\n\n“Beautiful” uses King’s music to tell her story, from her Brooklyn youth to the Brill Building days to her 1971 breakthrough “Tapestry.”\n\nThe show opened on Broadway to mixed reviews but went on to run for 60 previews and 2,418 regular performances.\n\nOur take: “It shares some flaws of (the jukebox musical) genre, mainly a story that rushes past major life crises — and cribs too much from ‘Funny Girl,’ another story about a self-deprecating gal from the New York boroughs who made it big in show biz — in its haste to pack in the songs.” (Nov. 20, 2015; Orpheum Theatre).\n\n‘PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT’\n\nThe backstory: After the success of “Mamma Mia,” it seemed like a no-brainer to turn the 1994 Australian film “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” into a musical. After all, the song “Mamma Mia” was prominently used in the movie.\n\nWhile ABBA’s hit didn’t make it into the stage version, the show’s dizzying parade of ’70s dance and ’80s pop tunes fill that gap with ease. The story follows a Sydney-based drag queen invited to perform a four-week residency at a casino in the Australian hinterlands. Joined by a younger, more obnoxious queen and an older, recently bereaved trans woman, the trio make the trip in a broken-down old bus they have christened Priscilla.\n\n“Priscilla” earned warm reviews and enthusiastic audiences in Sydney, London and Toronto before hitting Broadway, where it played 23 previews and 526 performances.\n\nOur take: “The raucous, wildly entertaining ‘Priscilla, Queen of the Desert’ is the rare film-to-stage adaptation that might just top its source material.” (Jan. 12, 2013; Orpheum Theatre).\n\n‘Summer: The Donna Summer Musical’\n\nWhen: Dec. 28-Jan. 2\n\nWhere: Ordway Center for the Performing Arts, 345 Washington St., St. Paul\n\nTickets: $122-$44\n\nInformation: 651-224-4222 or ordway.org\n\nOriginally Published: December 23, 2021 at 3:46 p.m."
