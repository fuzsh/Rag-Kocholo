The name’s origins can be traced back to modern Italian, where it means ‘woman.’ In classical Italian, the name has a more nuanced meaning associated with ‘lady’ or ‘mistress.’ However, the original meaning of the name is ‘lady of the home,’ and it was used as a title of respect in Italy. This usage is comparable to how ‘Don’ is used as a title for gentlemen or lords.\n\nThe name Donna can also be used as a feminine variation of the name Donald, which has Scottish Gaelic roots. The name Donald comes from Dòmhnall, which means ‘ruler of the world.’ This name is made up of the Old Irish words ‘domun,’ meaning ‘world,’ and ‘fal,’ meaning ‘rule.’\n\nIn addition to being a popular first name for girls, Donna is a surname with Italian roots. The surname originated from a medieval personal name, ‘Donna,’ which means ‘mistress.’ The name has also been Americanized from the French name ‘Danis.’\n\nThe common variations of the name Donna include Donelle, Dona (English), and Donalda, Donaldina, Donella (Scottish). The name Donna has been used in various fictional characters across TV shows and genres. Donna Bishop appeared in the popular Australian soap opera Home and Away, while Donna Clark was a character in the drama TV series Halt and Catch Fire. Donna Freedman was a character in the long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours, and Donna Hayward was a character in the cult favorite TV series Twin Peaks. Finally, Donna Tubbs appeared in the animated sitcom The Cleveland Show, while Donna Cabonna was a character in the teen sitcom That’s So Raven, created by Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman.\n\nHow To Pronounce Donna?\n\n‘Donna’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Donna\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Donna famous with their contributions in various fields.
