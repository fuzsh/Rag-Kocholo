        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nSummer broke onto the disco scene in 1975 with her first hit, \"Love to Love You Baby.\" It was an instant classic, a sensuous and danceable anthem for the times.\n\nAs disco dominated the rest of the decade, Summer followed up with \"I Feel Love,\" \"Last Dance,\" and a string of other hits. In 1978, she appeared in the disco film \"Thank God It's Friday,\" which won a best song Oscar for \"Last Dance.\"\n\nEven as disco faded, Summer's popularity survived, and she transitioned to develop a pop rock sound vibe with \"Hot Stuff\" in 1979. And that led to one of her biggest hits, \"She Works Hard for the Money,\" released in 1983, playing up women's rights.\n\nIn all, Donna Summer scored 19 number-one dance hits, the final one in 2008. And she won five Grammys, spanning the dance, rock, R&B and inspirational categories.\n\nIn later years, she lived in Naples, Fla., where she died of cancer this morning. Within hours, fans were gathering at the singer's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
