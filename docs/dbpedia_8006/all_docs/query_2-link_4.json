        "text": "Studio albums17Live albums2Compilation albums32Music videos44Singles89\n\nThe discography of American singer Donna Summer includes 17 studio albums and 89 singles, plus several other releases. Her first single, \"Wassermann\", a German version of the song \"Aquarius\" from the musical Hair, was released in Europe in 1968 under her maiden name, Donna Gaines. She would become known as Donna Summer from 1974 onwards. Her first full-length album under that name was Lady of the Night.\n\nSummer has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.[1] Billboard list her as the 14th greatest female soloist of all time (51st overall).[2] She has scored three number one albums on the US Billboard 200, sixteen number one hits on the US Dance Club Songs and four chart-topping singles in the Billboard Hot 100,[2] earning her title as the reigning \"Queen of Disco\".[3] Bad Girls remains the biggest selling album of her career with over 4 million copies sold worldwide.[4] Summer holds the record for most consecutive double albums to hit number one on the Billboard charts (3) and first female to have four number-one singles in a 12 month period; three as a solo artist and one as a duet with Barbra Streisand.[5]\n\nSummer's debut album, Lady of the Night, was released only in the Netherlands by Groovy Records. This was followed by her first international release, Love to Love You Baby, issued by Giorgio Moroder's Oasis Records in association with Casablanca Records in the United States and Canada. (At this time Summer would again become based in the United States, having lived in Germany for several years previously.) \"Love to Love You Baby\" was her first single in the US; it was recorded on Oasis Records, which would join with Casablanca Records to release it in the US. Casablanca would assume responsibility for recording and distributing Summer's albums during the 1970s and in the process became one of the premier labels of that decade.\n\nWhile Casablanca would become the main label responsible for managing Summer, Groovy continued to distribute her work in the Netherlands and other labels were used to distribute her work in other countries, such as GTO in the United Kingdom, Atlantic in Germany and France, Polar in Sweden and Durium in Italy. From 1977's Once Upon a Time... album, Casablanca would take over the distribution of Summer's albums in most countries (though her releases in the Netherlands would be issued by Philips and (until 1978 and 1979 respectively) would continue to be issued by Atlantic in Germany and France). As a result, some of her former labels released hits compilation albums in an attempt to cash in on losing her: GTO even scored a Top 5 placing in the United Kingdom with The Greatest Hits of Donna Summer. Summer remained with Casablanca, who helped make her one of the biggest stars in music and \"The Queen of Disco\" until the end of 1979, when she left due to personal and professional disputes with them and filed a lawsuit against them.\n\nSummer subsequently became the first ever artist to be signed to David Geffen's Geffen Records and, after refusing to release her second album recorded for them (in 1981), they requested that she no longer work with long-term collaborator Giorgio Moroder, who had produced and co-written the vast majority of her hits in the previous decade. From the following album (issued in 1982), her Geffen work outside North America would be distributed by Warner Bros. Records, the umbrella company to Geffen.\n\nBy 1983, Casablanca had been bought out by PolyGram Records, who informed Summer that she still owed them an album as per her legal settlement with Casablanca. She delivered the album She Works Hard for the Money, which PolyGram chose to release on its Mercury Records imprint as opposed to Casablanca, Summer's former label. Following this, she released another album with Geffen a year later, but they reportedly refused to release much of her material in the remainder of the decade and, after they refused to release her album Another Place and Time in 1988, Summer left the label. However, Warner Bros. released the record in Europe the following year where it became a success, resulting in Summer being signed to their Atlantic label in North America. She remained signed to Atlantic and Warner Bros. until the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1990, Geffen Records was sold to MCA Records, which was owned by alcoholic beverage-maker Seagram; although Summer was no longer an artist on Geffen Records. In 1998, PolyGram and its imprints were purchased by Seagram, which merged the company with its MCA Records label and imprints to create the gigantic Universal Music Group. This had the result of Summer's MCA, Oasis, Casablanca, Geffen, and Mercury releases now being owned by one conglomerate, Universal Music. This catalogue of Summer's material stretches from 1971 to 1987 for Universal Music Group.\n\nSummer again signed to PolyGram's Mercury label, who released two hits compilation albums, her 1994 Christmas album and the previously unreleased second Geffen album from 1981. Mercury also re-released some of Summer's Warner Bros. albums in the 1990s. By the end of the decade, she was signed to Sony's Epic Records, who released a live album. Her final album, in 2008, was released by Sony's Burgundy Records.\n\nAfter 1987, Donna Summer owned the masters to her recordings released by Geffen/Warner Bros, Atlantic Records, Epic Records and Burgundy Records releases.\n\nAll albums were released internationally unless otherwise stated. The record labels given are those used to release the records in the US (unless of course they were not released in that country). As explained in the previous paragraph, other labels were sometimes used to distribute Summer's work in other countries (most notably for the Casablanca/Geffen/Atlantic albums). From Once Upon a Time through to the end of the Casablanca albums, this label was used to distribute Summer's work in most nations.\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Certifications Record label US\n\n[6] US R&B\n\n[6] AUS\n\n[7] CAN\n\n[8] GER\n\n[9] NL\n\n[10] NZ\n\n[11] UK\n\n[12] 1974 Lady of the Night [A] — — — — — — — — Groovy 1975 Love to Love You Baby 11 6 7 16 23 — — 16\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Gold[14]\n\nCasablanca [B][C][D] 1976 A Love Trilogy 21 16 32 6 24 — — 41\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Gold[15]\n\nFour Seasons of Love 29 13 — 16 31 — — —\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[16]\n\n1977 I Remember Yesterday 18 11 4 15 7 6 12 3\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Gold[17]\n\nOnce Upon a Time... 26 13 44 27 — — — 24\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Gold[18]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\n1979 Bad Girls 1 1 6 1 7 24 3 23\n\nRIAA: 2× Platinum[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[20]\n\nMC: 2× Platinum[19]\n\nRMNZ: Gold[21]\n\n1980 The Wanderer 13 12 18 — 54 — 16 55\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nGeffen 1982 Donna Summer[G] 20 6 45 32 37 4 — 13\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nNVPI: Platinum[22]\n\n1983 She Works Hard for the Money 9 5 21 23 14 9 47 28\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\nMercury 1984 Cats Without Claws 40 24 91 84 39 19 — 69 Geffen[G] 1987 All Systems Go 122 53 — — — 72 — — 1989 Another Place and Time 53 71 93 60 49 29 — 17\n\nBPI: Gold[23]\n\nAtlantic[G] 1991 Mistaken Identity — 97 — — — — — — 1994 Christmas Spirit[H] — — — — — — — — Mercury 1996 I'm a Rainbow[E][F] — — — — — — — — 2008 Crayons 17 5 244 — 73 — — — Burgundy \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nA Released in the Netherlands only.\n\nB Love to Love You Baby and A Love Trilogy released by Oasis in North America in association with Casablanca.\n\nC Love to Love You Baby, A Love Trilogy, Four Seasons of Love and I Remember Yesterday released by various labels outside of North America including Groovy, who continued to distribute Summer's work in the Netherlands, GTO in the United Kingdom and Atlantic in Germany and France.

The next few singles were one-offs that were not major hits, released on different labels, until she was signed to the Dutch label Groovy Records in 1974 (\"The Hostage\" being her first single for them). Atlantic Records became responsible for distributing Summer's work in Germany at the same time and both labels would continue to distribute Summer's work in the respective countries for the following few years (including the first few years of her signing to Casablanca Records in North America).\n\nYear Title Peaks Album GER\n\n[9] NL\n\n[10] 1968 \"Wassermann\" [A]\n\nb/w \"Finale\"\n\n(Donna Gaines und Ensemble) — — Haare (Hair) 1969 \"If You Walkin' Alone\" [A]\n\nb/w \"Can't Understand\"\n\n(Donna Gains) — — — 1971 \"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\"\n\nb/w \"So Said the Man\"\n\n(Donna Gaines) — — 1974 \"Denver Dream\" [B]\n\nb/w \"Something's in the Wind\" — — \"The Hostage\"\n\nb/w \"Let's Work Together Now\" — 2 Lady of the Night \"Lady of the Night\"\n\nb/w \"Wounded\" 40 4 1975 \"Love to Love You\" [C]\n\nb/w \"Need-A-Man Blues\" — 13 — \"Virgin Mary\" [C]\n\nb/w \"Pandora's Box\" — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nA Released in Germany only.\n\nB Released in the Netherlands, Belgium and France only.\n\nC Released in the Netherlands only.\n\nNone of the above singles were released outside of just a few countries in Europe. \"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\" and \"The Hostage\" were released in the United Kingdom, but were not UK hits. Summer scored hits in the Netherlands with \"Let's Work Together Now\", \"Lady of the Night\", and \"Love to Love You\" (later named \"Love to Love You Baby\").\n\nThese singles were all released commercially in at least one format in one country. Promotional formats may have also been released in that country/those countries or in others.\n\nSummer's recordings during this era were distributed by Casablanca Records in North America and, from late 1977 onwards, in most other nations. Various other labels released Summer's work internationally prior to said time (and in a small number of cases, during it). Summer left the label in 1979 but they continued to issue previously released material for a while afterwards.\n\nSingles from the film soundtracks of The Deep and Thank God It's Friday were distributed internationally by Casablanca, as that label was responsible for releasing the soundtracks worldwide.\n\nYear Titles (A-side, B-side)\n\nBoth sides from same album except where indicated Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[37] US Dan\n\n[37] US R&B\n\n[37] AUS\n\n[7] CAN\n\n[38] GER\n\n[9] IRE\n\n[39] NL\n\n[10] NZ\n\n[11] UK\n\n[24] 1975 \"Love to Love You Baby\"\n\nb/w \"Need-A-Man Blues\" 2 1 3 4 1 6 11 13 8 4\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\nLove to Love You Baby 1976 \"Could It Be Magic\"\n\nb/w \"Whispering Waves\" (from Love to Love You Baby) 52 3 21 — 64 23 — 5 — 40 A Love Trilogy \"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\" [D]\n\nb/w \"Wasted\" 80 1 35 — 68 42 — — — — \"Spring Affair\" [D]\n\nb/w \"Come With Me\" (from A Love Trilogy) 47 1 24 — 80 — — 25 — — Four Seasons of Love 1977 \"Winter Melody\"\n\nb/w \"Full of Emptiness (Reprise)\" (from Love to Love You Baby) 43 21 — 59 — 20 — — 27 \"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\" [E]\n\nb/w \"I Feel Love\" — 1 20 — — — — — — — I Remember Yesterday \"I Feel Love\"\n\nb/w \"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\" 6 9 1 4 3 9 1 2 1\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Platinum[40]\n\nMC: Platinum[19]\n\n\"Theme from The Deep (Down, Deep Inside)\" [F]\n\nb/w Instrumental version of A-side — 3 — 70 — 25 — 5 — 5\n\nBPI: Silver[41]\n\n\"The Deep\" soundtrack \"I Remember Yesterday\" (Part 1) [F]\n\nb/w \"I Remember Yesterday (Part 2)\" — 1 — — — — — 20 — 14 I Remember Yesterday \"Love's Unkind\" [F]\n\nb/w \"Black Lady\" — — — — 18 2 28 — 3\n\nBPI: Gold[42]\n\n\"I Love You\"\n\nb/w \"Once Upon a Time\" 37 1 28 47 27 — — — — 10 Once Upon a Time... \"Fairy Tale High\" [G]\n\nb/w \"I Love You\" — — — — — — — — — \"Once Upon a Time\" [H]\n\nb/w \"(Theme) Once Upon a Time\" — — — — — — — — — 1978 \"Rumour Has It\"\n\nb/w \"(Theme) Once Upon a Time\" 53 21 — 64 21 — 20 — 19 \"Back in Love Again\" [F]\n\nb/w \"Try Me, I Know, We Can Make It\" /\n\n\"Wasted\" (both from A Love Trilogy) [GTO]\n\n\"A Man Like You\" (from Once Upon a Time) [Atlantic] — 1; — — — — — — — 29 I Remember Yesterday \"Last Dance\"\n\nb/w \"With Your Love\" 3 1 5 69 4 — — 10 3 51\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\n\"Thank God It's Friday\" soundtrack \"Je t'aime... moi non plus\" (Part 1) [I]\n\nb/w Part 2 — — — — — — — — — — \"MacArthur Park\"\n\nb/w \"Once Upon a Time (Live)\" 1 1 8 8 1 39 7 8 4 5\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[43]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\nLive and More \"Heaven Knows\" (with Brooklyn Dreams)\n\nb/w \"Only One Man\" 4 10 15 3 — — — 14 34\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\n1979 \"Hot Stuff\"\n\nb/w \"Journey to the Center of Your Heart\" 1 1 3 1 1 5 14 21 7 11\n\nRIAA: Platinum[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[44]\n\nMC: Platinum[19]\n\nBad Girls \"Bad Girls\"\n\nb/w \"On My Honor\" 1 1 14 1 9 23 10 6 14\n\nRIAA: Platinum[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[45]\n\nMC: Platinum[19]\n\n\"Dim All the Lights\"\n\nb/w \"There Will Always Be a You\" 2 54 13 — 13 25 30 28 14 29\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\n\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" [J]\n\n(with Barbra Streisand)\n\nb/w \"Lucky\" (from Bad Girls) 1 1 20 8 2 31 7 27 7 3\n\nRIAA: Platinum[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[46]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\nOn the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II \"On the Radio\"\n\nb/w \"There Will Always Be a You\" (from Bad Girls) 5 8 9 36 2 34 18 27 32 32\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\n1980 \"Sunset People\" [F]\n\nb/w \"Our Love\" — — — — — — — 42 — 46 Bad Girls \"Our Love\" [K]\n\nb/w \"Sunset People\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Walk Away\"\n\nb/w \"Could It Be Magic\" (from A Love Trilogy) 36 — 35 — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nD Not released commercially in the United Kingdom.\n\nE Released commercially in selected countries (including North America and the Netherlands) with \"I Feel Love\" as the B-side.

Promotional formats may have also been released in that country/those countries or in others.\n\nSummer's material during this era was released by three different Warner Bros. labels: Geffen, Atlantic and the main Warner Bros. label. In North America, Summer was signed to Geffen from 1980 to 1988 and Atlantic from 1989 to 1991. Internationally, Geffen released her material from 1980 to 1981 but all subsequent Geffen/Atlantic releases were released by Warner Bros. Records.\n\nSummer's original North American label (Casablanca), now owned by PolyGram, also released two official Donna Summer singles in the United Kingdom in 1982 and 1983 respectively; these were new remixes and/or edits of two of Summer's biggest hits from during her time with that label. See notes below for details.\n\nDuring Summer's court battle regarding her leaving Casablanca, it was decided that she still owed them an album. Subsequently, PolyGram's Mercury Records released the 1983 album She Works Hard For The Money, so all singles from that album were also released by Mercury.\n\nYear Titles (A-side, B-side)\n\nBoth sides from same album except where indicated Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[37] US Dan\n\n[37][47] US R&B\n\n[37] AUS\n\n[7] CAN\n\n[38] GER\n\n[9] IRE\n\n[39] NL\n\n[10] NZ\n\n[11] UK\n\n[24] 1980 \"The Wanderer\"\n\nb/w \"Stop Me\" 3 8 13 6 4 — — 30 5 48\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nThe Wanderer \"Cold Love\"\n\nb/w \"Grand Illusion\" 33 — — — — 30 — — 44 1981 \"Who Do You Think You're Foolin'\"\n\nb/w \"Running for Cover\" 40 — 100 — — — — — — \"Looking Up\" [L]\n\nb/w \"Who Do You Think You're Foolin'\" — — — — — — — — — 1982 \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)\"\n\nb/w \"Sometimes Like Butterflies\" 10 3 4 17 4 — 14 12 40 18 Donna Summer \"State of Independence\"\n\nb/w \"Love Is Just a Breath Away\" 41 — 31 30 — — 10 1 — 14 \"I Feel Love\" (Patrick Cowley Remixes) [M]\n\n12\" single b/w \"Bad Girls\" and \"Hot Stuff\" (both from Bad Girls) — — — — — — 18 — — 21 — \"The Woman in Me\"\n\nb/w \"Livin' in America\" 33 — 30 — — — — 12 — 62 Donna Summer 1983 \"Protection\" [N]\n\nb/w \"(If It Hurts Just a Little)\" [Europe]\n\n\"State of Independence\" [Japan] — — — — — — — — — — \"Love to Love You Baby\" (Young & Strong Edit) [M]\n\n12\" single b/w another mix of A-side — — — — — — — — — — — \"She Works Hard for the Money\"\n\nb/w \"I Do Believe (I Fell in Love)\" 3 3 1 4 4 11 26 18 23 25\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\nShe Works Hard for the Money \"Unconditional Love\" (additional vocals by Musical Youth)\n\nb/w \"Woman\" 43 — 9 57 48 — 28 — 24 14 \"Love Has a Mind of Its Own\" (with Matthew Ward)\n\nb/w \"Stop, Look and Listen\" 70 — 35 — — — — — — — \"People People\" [O]\n\nb/w \"Tokyo\" — — — — — — — — — — \"He's a Rebel\" [P]\n\nb/w \"Love Has a Mind of Its Own\" — — — — — — — — — — 1984 \"Stop, Look and Listen\" [M]\n\nb/w \"Tokyo\" — — — — — — — — — 57 \"There Goes My Baby\"\n\nb/w \"Maybe It's Over\" 21 — 20 52 31 — — 31 — 99 Cats Without Claws \"Supernatural Love\"\n\nb/w \"Face the Music\" (Non-album track) 75 39 51 — — — — — — — 1985 \"Eyes\" [Q]\n\nb/w \"It's Not the Way\" — — — — — — — — — 97 1987 \"Dinner with Gershwin\"\n\nb/w instrumental version of A-side (Non-album track) 48 13 10 — 39 — 13 43 — 13 All Systems Go \"Only the Fool Survives\" [R] (with Mickey Thomas)\n\nb/w \"Love Shock\" — — — — 43 — — — — — 1988 \"All Systems Go\" [Q] / — — — — — — — — — 54 \"Fascination\" [S] — — — — — — — — — — 1989 \"This Time I Know It's for Real\"\n\nb/w \"If It Makes You Feel Good\" 7 5 — 40 6 15 4 6 — 3\n\nRIAA: Gold[13]\n\nBPI: Silver[48]\n\nAnother Place and Time \"I Don't Wanna Get Hurt\" [Q]\n\nb/w instrumental version of A-side (Non-album track) — — — — — 25 3 29 — 7 \"Love's About to Change My Heart\"\n\nb/w another mix of A-side (Non-album track) 85 3 — 71 — — 11 59 — 20 \"Breakaway\" [S]\n\nb/w \"Thinkin' Bout My Baby\" (Non-album track) — — — — — — — — — 49 \"When Love Takes Over You\" [Q]\n\nb/w \"Bad Reputation\" (from All Systems Go) — — — — — — — — — 72 1990 \"State of Independence\" [Q] (re-release)\n\nb/w \"Love Is Just a Breath Away\" — — — — — — — 69 — 45 Donna Summer \"Breakaway\" (Remix)\n\nb/w \"Love Is in Control\" (from Donna Summer) — 31 — — — — — — — 49 Another Place and Time 1991 \"When Love Cries\"\n\n12\" single with four different mixes 77 41 18 — — — — — — — Mistaken Identity \"Work That Magic\"\n\nb/w \"Let There Be Peace\" — — — 147 — — — — — 74 \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nL Released commercially in Japan only.\n\nM Released commercially in the United Kingdom only.\n\nN Released commercially in Belgium, The Netherlands and Japan only.\n\nO Released commercially in The Netherlands only.\n\nP Released commercially in Spain only.\n\nQ Not released commercially in North America.\n\nR Released commercially in North America and Japan only.\n\nS Released commercially in North America only.\n\nThese singles were all released commercially in at least one format in one country.

Summer's final album (2008's Crayons) and the singles from it were released by Sony's Burgundy Records.\n\nUniversal released 2005's \"I Got Your Love\", originally featured two years earlier in the television series Sex and the City.\n\nThe final Donna Summer single, \"To Paris with Love\" was released on her own Driven by the Music label.\n\nThe posthumous remix album released in 2013 (entitled Love to Love You Donna) and its singles were released by Verve Records, by then part of Universal Music Group, who had long since owned the rights to Summer's Casablanca/PolyGram recordings from 1975 to 1983.\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Album US\n\n[37] US Dan\n\n[37] AUS\n\n[7] GER\n\n[9] IRE\n\n[39] NL\n\n[10] UK\n\n[24] 1993 \"La Vie en rose\" [T] — — — — — — — Tribute to Edith Piaf 1994 \"Melody of Love (Wanna Be Loved)\" — 1 79 — — — 21 Endless Summer: Donna Summer's Greatest Hits \"Any Way at All\" [U] — — — — — — — 1995 \"I Feel Love\" (Remixes) — 9 80 — 24 26 8 — 1996 \"State of Independence\" (Remixes) [V] — — — — — — 13 \"Whenever There Is Love\" [W] (with Bruce Roberts) —[W] — — — — — — Daylight 1997 \"Carry On\" (Remixes) (with Giorgio Moroder) — 25 — — — — 65 — 1999 \"I Will Go with You (Con te partirò)\" 79 1 97 — — 59 44 Live & More Encore \"Love Is the Healer\" [W] — 1 — — — — — \"Last Dance\" [X] (Re-release) — — — — — — — — 2000 \"I Feel Love\" [X] (Re-release) — — — — — — — \"The Power of One\" [U] — 2 — — — — — Pokémon: The Movie 2000 2005 \"I Got Your Love\" [U] — 4 — — — — — — 2006 \"Power of Love\" [U] — 43 — — — — — So Amazing: An All-Star Tribute to Luther Vandross 2008 \"I'm a Fire\" — 1 — — — — — Crayons \"Stamp Your Feet\" — 1 195 88 — — — \"It's Only Love\" [U] — — — — — — — 2009 \"Fame (The Game)\" — 1 — — — — — 2010 \"To Paris with Love\" — 1 — — — — — — 2012 \"I Feel Love\" (Download) — — — — — — 45 2013 \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)\"\n\n(Chromeo & Oliver Remix) — — — — — — — Love to Love You Donna \"Love to Love You Baby\"\n\n(Giorgio Moroder Remix) — — — — — — — \"MacArthur Park\"\n\n(Laidback Luke Remix) — 1 — — — — — 2017 \"Enough Is Enough 2017\"\n\n(with Barbra Streisand) — 3 — — — — — — 2018 \"Hot Stuff 2018\" — 1 — — — — — 2020 \"Hot Stuff\"[49]\n\n(with Kygo) — — — 74 — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nT Released commercially in France only.\n\nU Released commercially in North America only.\n\nV Released commercially in the United Kingdom only.\n\nW Not released commercially in the United Kingdom.

Beginning with the February 23, 1991, issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time. Therefore;\n\n\"Wasted\" and \"Come With Me\" charted at #7 due to their inclusion on the A Love Trilogy album, so the chart position is in fact for the entire album. The reason these two tracks have been singled out is because the other two tracks on the album (\"Could It Be Magic\" and \"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\") reached their own peak positions when they were released as singles.\n\n\"Spring Affair\" and \"Winter Melody\" both appear on Summer's Four Seasons of Love album, so their joint #1 position is actually for the whole album.\n\n\"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\", \"I Feel Love\", \"I Remember Yesterday\", \"Love's Unkind\" and \"Back in Love Again\" all appear on Summer's I Remember Yesterday album, so their #1 position is also for the full album..\n\n\"I Love You\", \"Fairy Tale High\", \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"Rumour Has It\" all appear on her Once Upon a Time album, so again the #1 position is in fact for the whole album.\n\n\"Last Dance\" shared its entry with three other tracks from the Thank God It's Friday film soundtrack, none of which were sung by Summer (though she was credited as co-writer and background vocalist on \"Take It to the Zoo\", a track by her sisters' group Sunshine.\n\n\"MacArthur Park\" and \"Heaven Knows\" are both part of a medley titled \"MacArthur Park Suite,\" which was released as a 12\" single for use in clubs. A slightly different version appears on the Live And More album.\n\n\"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\" was released for use in clubs as a continuous medley on a one-sided 12\" single, so these two also count as one #1 on this chart.\n\n\"The Wanderer\", \"Cold Love\", \"Who Do You Think You're Foolin'\", and \"Looking Up\" all appear on Summer's The Wanderer album, so yet again their entry is for the whole album.\n\nAll of the following singles were released commercially.\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[37] US Dan\n\n[37] US R&B\n\n[37] AUS\n\n[7] CAN\n\n[38] GER\n\n[9] IRE\n\n[39] NL\n\n[10] NZ\n\n[11] UK\n\n[24] 1977 \"Shut Out\" (Paul Jabara featuring special guest Donna Summer) — 31 — — — — — — — — Shut Out 1979 \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" [AA]\n\n(with Barbra Streisand) 1 1 20 8 2 31 7 27 7 3\n\nRIAA: Platinum[13]\n\nMC: Gold[19]\n\nWet 1980 \"Foggy Day/Never Lose Your Sense of Humor\"\n\n(with Paul Jabara) — — — — — — — — — — The Third Album 1989 \"Spirit of the Forest\" (as part of charity group Spirit of the Forest) — — — — — — — — — — — 1992 \"Carry On\" (Giorgio Moroder featuring Donna Summer) — — — — — — — — — — Forever Dancing 2012 \"Angel\"\n\n(O'Mega Red featuring Donna Summer) — — — — — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n\nAA Also released by Summer's label on different formats in different countries (hence its inclusion in the main section also).
