She was born LaDonna Adrian Gaines in Dorchester, and got her start singing in local churches while growing up in Mission Hill. Now the street where she grew up — Parker Hill Avenue — will be renamed in honor of the hometown hero.\n\nBoston officials made the announcement during the annual Donna Summer Disco Party in Copley Square on June 16, where revelers danced the night away to DJ Vince 1, heard from Summer’s nephew O’Mega Red, and listened to a tribute from Mary Gaines Bernard, Summer’s sister and backup singer.\n\nBernard told GBH News she hadn't been back to Boston in a few years, but that \"there's so much love here\" and the city will always be home. Bernard said having a street in their old neighborhood renamed for her sister was like a dream come true.\n\n\"It's something we used to always talk about and kid about, and to actually see it happen — I almost can't talk about it because I will start crying,\" she said. \"It's really very emotional.\"\n\nSummer's musical career grew in the 1970s and 1980s, with popular hits including \" Hot Stuff\" and \" I Feel Love.\" She received both popular and critical acclaim, winning five Grammy Awards and being posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe annual event has honored Summer since her death in 2012.\n\nHere are some highlights from the celebration.\n\nA member of the late singer Donna Summer’s family holds up a street sign named in her honor.
