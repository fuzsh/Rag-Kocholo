        "text": "Born: 31 December 1948\n\nDied: 17 May 2012 (aged 63)\n\nBirth name: LaDonna Adrian Gaines\n\nDonna was born in Boston on new year’s eve 1948. She started singing in her church at a very early age and then in high school musicals. Just before graduating high school in 1967 she left Boston for New York and joined a band called The Crow. Failure to secure a record deal led to the band breaking up and Donna audition for the Musical ‘Hair’, getting the part of Sheila in the Munich production. She moved to Germany where she spent a good number of years, mostly performing in musicals such as ‘Godspell’ and ‘Show Boat’. Her first solo release was a German version of the song ‘Aquarius’ from ‘Hair’ which she put out under the name Donna Gaines. In 1973 she married an Austrian actor called Helmuth Sommer and recorded further work going under the name Gayn Pierre. In 1974 she met Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte in a recording studio. Moroder and Bellotte were working on a Three Dog Night album at the time and they were impressed by the strength of Donna’s voice. Together they arranged for Donna to record and release a single called ‘The Hostage’ which wrongly identified her as Donna Summer instead of Donna Sommer. The single fared well in Europe, going to number 1 in France, but it had to be withdrawn from airplay in Germany soon after its release due to a prominent German politician being kidnapped and held hostage at the time. She then began work on what was to become her big US breakthrough hit, ‘Love To Love You Baby’. She added the sexy groans that featured in the song as a joke, but Moroder and Bellotte liked it and released the single which was a top 20 hit across Europe in the early part of 1975. The song came to the attention of Neil Bogart who owned Casablanca records. He played it at a party and the guests kept insisting he play it again and again. That was good enough for him to sign up Donna and the song was released in late 1975 in the US and by February 1976 it was at number 2, stuck behind Paul Simon’s ’50 Ways To Leave Your Lover’. The rest, as they say, is history. Donna went on to see 30 hot 100 hits in the US, including 3 number 1’s in the shape of ‘MacArthur Park, ‘Hot Stuff’ and ‘Bad Girls’. Her final US hit was in 1999 when ‘I Will Go With You’ got to number 79. Sadly, Donna would succumb to cancer in 2012 and died at her home in Florida.\n\nDonna did backing vocals on the following Three Dog Night track:\n\nTotal chart involvement:"
