        "text": "Donna Summer will be forever associated with disco fever, but her staying power belies any musical label.\n\nFrom “Last Dance,” the quintessential disco song of the ’70s, to her latest album, 2008’s “Crayons” that offers a smorgasbord of musical styles, Summer has spent more than three decades seamlessly shifting her musical stylings to fit her moods and the times in which she has lived.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to sing what I’ve wanted to sing,” Summer said in a phone interview.\n\n“I think it’s really important for musicians to keep pressing through the box ... moving towards other types of music and growing.”\n\nShe brings it all together for an 8 p.m. show at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods Friday, with three dancers and four singers for an evening Summer said will entertain audiences.\n\n“It has a good energy and is entertaining,” she said of her show. “I think people will come and have a good time and put thoughts on life on hold and enjoy the moment and take something positive into the future.”\n\nA five-time Grammy winner, Summer, born LaDonna Adrian Gaines, is the only female artist to have three straight double albums rise to No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the United States.\n\nIt’s an achievement Summer doesn’t take for granted. As her song, “She Works Hard For The Money,” Summer wasn’t just the voice behind the songs, she was also the songwriter for many — something then, and now, women don’t get the recognition for as easily as men.\n\n“I think there’s still a little imbalance, women don’t get credit for what we do,” Summer said of the music industry she took by storm in the ’70s and ’80s.\n\nEarly years\n\nBut Summer first made her mark in Europe, where she met and married an Austrian actor named Helmuth Sommer, from whom her stage name was derived.\n\nOriginally from Massachusetts, Summer began singing Gospel in the church, went into rock and roll, and then worked in musical theater before turning to the pop scene in Europe.\n\nYet her amazing versatility isn’t something most people associate with Summer, as her string of hits that kept the disco era burning overshadow the singer herself. Summer has sold more than 130 million albums worldwide.\n\n“I lived in Europe a long time, I have a very eclectic sense of music — I want to do it all. To categorize people in music is ridiculous. I’m a horn, play me. The voice is an instrument and should be used as such,” she said.\n\nSome songs, though, will also be shaded with personal notes from the creator.\n\n“A lot of songs come out of circumstances that are pertinent, some are the successful ones, and came from a moment of intimacy or personal relationships,” said Summer, who cited “Last Dance,” “On the Radio,” “She Works Hard For The Money” and “There Will Always Be a You” as songs that continue to move her.\n\n‘Crayons’\n\nBut there will only be one Donna Summer — the undisputed queen of an era — who is now happy to entertain with her hits, as well as offer up what she’s been cooking on “Crayons.”\n\n“I just wanted it to be a sampler of flavors and influences from all over the world. There’s a touch of this, a little smidgen of that, a dash of something else ... like when you’re cooking,” Summer said of her latest release.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Donna Summer live in concert.\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday.\n\nWhere: MGM Grand, Foxwoods, 39 Norwich-Westerly Road, Ledyard.\n\nTickets: $55, $65 (premium $75 seats sold out).\n\nFor more information, visit www.foxwoods.com or call the box office at (866) 646-0609."
