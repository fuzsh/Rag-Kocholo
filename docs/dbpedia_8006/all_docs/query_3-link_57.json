        "text": "It's hard to think what nightclubs would sound like without Donna Summer or Giorgio Moroder. From the moment they started working together with Pete Bellotte, Summer and Moroder's skill sets fed into each other to produce the music that pushed disco to its extremities and beyond. Summer's powerful voice, wide range and background in musical theatre storytelling helped to make booming, pop operettas that had enough authority to prevent collapsing in on themselves from their sheer campiness.\n\nDuring lockdown, we at GQ have taken the opportunity to reacquaint ourselves with our favourite 20th-century artists and their best songs, in the hope that you, too, might join us – to quote Donna Summer on her acclaimed live album Live And More – “on this magical journey through time and love”.\n\nWe've explored the genius of soul Ray Charles, folk chanteuses Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez, the way The Kinks and Blondie changed rock music and the forgotten classics of Fleetwood Mac. Now, as summer arrives and we all crave a bit of a dance around the living room, let us take you into the back catalogue of one of dance music's most trivialised and most iconic stars. If you thought Diana Ross had some corkers, then hoo boy: Donna Summer would like you to know she has some Hot Stuff of her own.\n\n1. Aquarius (from the 1968 German cast recording of Haare)\n\nSummer started in musical theatre, auditioning for Hair in America and going on tour with it in Germany. There are three reasons her time in German musical theatre is so important. One: it was there that she married the Austrian Helmuth Sommer, giving her the origins of her iconic surname. Two: it was in Munich, while working as a model and back-up singer, that she met Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, with whom she would change the face of dance music. And three: it is a demonstration of just how incredible her voice is. Here she takes on “Aquarius” – a song that is as good on a night out as it is under a proscenium arch – and just rips it to shreds.\n\n2. Lady Of The Night (from Lady Of The Night)\n\nDonna Summer’s first album is hard to describe as anything other than “very European”, and that’s because it was. Only released in The Netherlands, it’s got that sound of Continental European pop in the 1970s: a bit Boney M, a bit Abba and incredibly camp. All you have to do is listen to the absolutely insane “The Hostage” to realise that this album, developed by Summer, Moroder and Bellotte, contains all the signs of their later masterpieces with absolutely none of the finesse. Then again, Chekhov’s early plays were dross too and look how he turned out!\n\nThere are some songs here that have some merit – “Domino” in particular feels like Lady Gaga could have cut it from Chromatica – but title track “Lady Of The Night” is a stone-cold objective bop. Cut and dry. It’s so Frankie Valli and yet has a sensibility completely different from anything you’d have found on Tin Pan Alley. You think it’s exhausted all of its tricks and then there’s a bloody accordion! Truly a classic.\n\n3. Love To Love You Baby (from Love To Love You Baby)\n\nIt is impossible to talk about Donna Summer without referencing a couple of her songs and “Love To Love You Baby” is one of them. Conceived by Summer, Moroder and Bellotte, it is probably the greatest thing to come out of a tense negotiation since the Treaty or Versaille. Summer wanted to do a sexy bop in the vein of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin’s “Je T’aime... Moi Non Plus”. Moroder wanted to explore the new disco sound he was so keen on. He wanted it pornographic; she… didn’t. They wrestled with it, and even when it was released America wouldn’t bite: the original three-minute single, Casablanca Records said, needed to be just shy of 20 minutes.\n\nThus “Love To Love You Baby” in its greatest form was born: the entire first half of the album of the same name and the song that turned Donna Summer into a US phenomenon. It’s a song that spawned controversies, astonishment, intrigue and Donna Summer’s nickname of “The First Lady Of Love”. It’s also – and this is easily forgotten – a truly symphonic masterpiece, whether you focus on the 20-something orgasms within it or not. Just when you think the song is dying out, in come the funk riffs and we’re taken on an instrumental ride that is as good as the four minutes of Summer that came before it. Then there are the flutes! The flutes! Who knew that woodwinds could be softcore? Then the synths take over, edging you into the song’s greatest moment: at about eleven minutes, a chorus of angelic voices reprise the chorus. You can really feel Summer’s experience of doing Hair in this moment: the way the voices undulate over the backing is just like the nude orgy at the end of Act One. This song is remembered as being camp, but it absolutely isn’t. Put this on at any party, 45 years since its release, and watch the inhibitions disappear.\n\n4. Try Me, I Know We Can Make It (from A Love Trilogy)\n\nIt seems astonishing that any musical team could produce quite so many amazing musical numbers over 15 minutes, and yet here we have another one from Moroder, Bellotte and Summer: the entire first half of A Love Trilogy, “Try Me, I Know We Can Make It”, is as heavenly as the album cover suggests. A much subtler, more doe-eyed song than “Love To Love You Baby”, “Try Me…” wasn’t a huge smash, but it is a truly brilliant song. Perfect laid-back disco, it works as well at a club night as it does at a brunch, and that is something worth lauding.\n\n5. Could It Be Magic (from A Love Trilogy)\n\nCowritten by Barry Manilow, “Could It Be Magic” allows Summer’s astonishing vocals the chance to stretch out in a big, sweeping song. In many ways it feels different to a lot of her songs from this period, not being as high-pitched or otherworldly as many of her Moroder songs, feeling more like a sign of what was to come on Bad Girls. But still there’s some of that mock-erotica in there that feels like it’s there to keep the fans of Love To Love You Baby happy. While it’s perhaps slightly kitschier than some of her songs, it’s hard to sit still to this.\n\n6. Spring Affair (from Four Seasons Of Love)\n\nDonna Summer loved a weird album concept and Four Seasons Of Love is the first in many ways: a series of songs based around the seasons, it contains one of Donna Summer’s absolute best songs, “Spring Affair”. Every time you listen to this song, you’re transported to a pastel-pink wonderland, dancing in a flowing pink gown, not unlike Cyd Charisse in Singin’ In The Rain but a bit more… Bacchic. The way the vocals and score build as it goes, the lightness of her vocals and the artificial carbonation of the backing music combine to create something as effortlessly sexy as “Love To Love You Baby” is outwardly racy.\n\nThe live version from Live And More – recorded at the Universal Ampitheatre in Los Angeles in 1978 – is much more fast-paced, much brassier and a very different (but equally delicious) take on the same song.\n\n7. I Feel Love (from I Remember Yesterday)\n\n“I Feel Love”, perhaps the most important song of the late 20th century, comes from a ludicrously contrived place. On her album I Remember Yesterday, Summer, Moroder and Bellotte aimed to write music that sounded like the past, the present and the future: “I Feel Love” was designed to be the last, a sort of hypothetical futuristic pop song. It’s astonishing how completely they succeeded. From the moment it opens, it is truly unlike anything that came before, and better than much of what has aped it since. With its piston-esque beats, the innovative use of the Moog synthesiser and Summer’s heady voice, it sounds like a holographic perfume advert floating high over the darkest slums of a fourth millennium mega city. The Neuromancer found rotting.\n\nDavid Bowie recalling the moment he first heard the song is, perhaps, the best endorsement there is. While recording his Berlin Trilogy, Brian Eno ran into the studio announcing, “This is it, look no further. This single is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.” If anything, he underestimated it: “I Feel Love” not only sounds as fresh today as it did in the 1970s, but it is still shaping how we imagine club music to sound in 2020.\n\n8. Last Dance (from the Thank God It’s Friday soundtrack)\n\nIf there is a micro-genre that Donna Summer helped to define, it is the torch song that turns into a disco bop – and “Last Dance” truly is the height of this particular form. It’s also one of Summer’s most-lauded numbers, winning both the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song (it appeared in the otherwise shaky disco movie Thank God It’s Friday, in which she performs it on stage). Starting sumptuous and romantic, when she says “and when I’m bad I’m so so bad” you know you’re both about to topple into delicious sin together. Other key examples of this Summerian genre: “On The Radio” (also from a movie soundtrack) and her cracking duet with Barbra Streisand, “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)”.\n\n9. MacArthur Park Suite (from Live And More)\n\nThe infamously surreal song “MacArthur Park” was originally performed by actor Richard Harris, who was feeling very confident about his musical chops having just starred in Camelot. It’s a song so unorthodox it’s hard to really say why it works at all, but it undeniably does, especially in Summer’s capable hands. Perhaps her ability telling psychedelic stories in musicals helped her to make the song sound less like the Chaucerian ballad Harris made it into. Moroder had been looking to redo a song from the 1960s and correctly noted that the high notes in the song made it perfect for Summer’s range: she’s having a lot of fun in this one, turning the end of each verse into something gothic and insane. The song went to No1, earned Summer her first Grammy nomination and also made her the first woman of the modern era to simultaneously have the No1 single and album on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWhile the original song is absolutely insane enough on its own, the “MacArthur Park Suite” is 17 minutes of disco perfection, becoming so nonsensical and nonlinear that you just end up caught up in the ever-swelling music. The suite also adds in two new Summer songs: “One Of A Kind” and “Heaven Knows”, the latter of which ended up becoming a single of its own. Which leads us nicely on to…\n\n10. Heaven Knows (from Live And More)\n\nBoth as a segment of the larger “MacArthur Park Suite” and later as a song in its own right, “Heaven Knows” is easily one of Donna Summer’s best songs and criminally underrated. One of the finest sad bangers of the disco age, here is the anthem to that moment in an argument with your partner where you just want to scream to the high heavens that something a bit shit you can work with is better than having nothing at all. It is so high-octane and yet so deeply, deeply sad – it’s the kind of music you’d expect from an Abba single and yet we were blessed to get as a fun addition to a perplexing Richard Harris song from the 1960s. God bless disco!\n\n11. Bad Girls (from Bad Girls)\n\nAlthough Donna Summer would later relinquish her image as a sexy siren of disco, the products of that time in her career were as woke as they often were objectifying: “Bad Girls”, a song that is literally an empathetic anthem for sex workers, was No1 for five weeks. When will your fave, I ask you? It was the second single from arguably Donna Summer’s best album, Bad Girls, and easily the hardest to choose iconic tracks from. The way “Hot Stuff” runs into this song is heavenly, and how it ends on “Our Love” and “Sunset People”… I don’t know a better album.\n\nBut whereas “Hot Stuff” is a true delight, “sexually frustrated singleton” is not as inventive a musical genre as “sex workers are just like you”. The way she makes vocal performances of car noises into a coherent and flirtatious part of the song’s vision, instead of something off of Sesame Street, deserves our respect. The way the second pre-chorus builds (“Now, don’t you ask yourself / Who they are / Like everybody else / They wanna be a star”) is also a complete treat, giving her the chance to belt with all the force in the world, before that beautiful statement of intent: “Now you and me, we are both the same / But you call yourself by different names.” Considering Summer’s distaste for her sexualised public image, there’s something poignant, and quite haunting, about this image of pop stars as prostitutes.\n\n12. Dim All The Lights (from Bad Girls)\n\nDonna Summer loves a switcheroo: “Last Dance”, “On The Radio”, “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)”… she never met a ballad she couldn’t make uptempo by the first chorus. “Dim All The Lights” is a series of musical hairpin turns that deserves recognition along with those three much better-known examples. It keeps swinging from honky tonk to disco to soulful pop banger until it’s less warring sides and more emulsified deliciousness. It was also her only hit single that she wrote alone and deserves to be remembered as one of her most unusual songs that showed how far she could push the instrument she knew inside and out: her voice.\n\n13. Cold Love (from The Wanderer)\n\nIt’s hard to think of a legacy artist whose musical output benefitted from the 1980s. Like the characters in Annihilation, all who crossed that threshold seemed to twist and change to suit the laws of this new world, producing many of the darkest ages in the careers of 20th-century greats.\n\nWhile she went on to release some bops this decade, Summer falls foul of the exact same curse as nearly everyone else. Summer underwent some big changes as an artist: she split from Casablanca Records, accusing the label and its founder of pushing her to become an overly sexualised pop star, as well as meddling in her personal life (she took the label to court over the matter). After a period of depression, she also ended up reconnecting with her Christianity. This might be somewhat obvious to listeners who come across The Wanderer’s subtly named final track, “I Believe In Jesus”.\n\nAlthough The Wanderer was still produced by Moroder and Bellotte, it was the last album the three would work on together in full. During the recording of her next album, I’m A Rainbow, David Geffen (Summer had signed with Geffen Records after Casablanca) came into the studio and wasn’t happy with the quality of the work, pushing Summer to part ways with Moroder and Bellotte. He brought in Quincy Jones instead, which has its merits, but marks the end of one of the great musical collaborations of the 20th century.\n\nBut let us focus on The Wanderer for now: it goes rockier than her previous work, with some successes and some… well, not successes. “Cold Love” is one of its highlights. It is, in the best possible way, very ELO – big, melodic pop rock that builds slow and really gives you a punch on the chorus.\n\n14. Protection (from Donna Summer)\n\nThe Quincy Jones years are not as game changing as the Moroder/Bellotte years, but there are some bangers in the Jones era. The opening song of her self-titled 1982 album, “Love Is In Control (Finger On The Trigger)” is one of her best songs and a fitting demonstration that Summer’s voice can adapt to just about any musical style. The electro-Western sounds and the strange robotic ensemble of men behind her make this into a song that is as conspicuously futuristic as her earlier work was often effortlessly so, but that doesn’t stop it from slapping hard.\n\nBut if you want to hear a completely different sound for Donna Summer, we recommend taking a listen to “Protection”, written by none other than Bruce Springsteen. Where Giorgio Moroder loved a bit of electric guitar, there’s something about the combination of Springsteen’s familiar instrumentations and lyrics, Jones’ production and Summer’s layered vocals that turn this into something quite beyond any of their usual work. Together their sounds almost make – and hear us out here – Abba?\n\n15. She Works Hard For The Money (from She Works Hard For The Money)\n\nDonna Summer provided a song for the Moroder-produced Flashdance soundtrack, and yet it sounded nowhere near as Flashdance-y as this, the title track of her 1983 album. Perhaps because Moroder had already been a bit of a glam rocker even in his disco days, Summer’s sound can translate quite well into the new decade (even if it doesn’t hold, in our opinion, a candle on her early work). That familiarity with overly sincere but very robust music is never clearer than it is here: taking her ability to match Moroder’s synths and proving she can shout down any guitar too.\n\nShe Works Hard For The Money was Summer’s most successful album of the 1980s and for good reason: it’s probably her most consistently quality album of the decade. Its title track is also a truly glorious song and does what many of Summer’s best singles do: it provides an incredibly relatable but under-represented human experience (in this case: the struggle of being a working woman) and turns it into a song that everyone is going to belt out in the club.\n\n16. This Time I Know It’s For Real (from Another Place And Time)\n\nDue to a series of complicated issues with Geffen Records, who let her go before this album, Donna Summer ended up signed to Atlantic Records for Another Place And Time. The label paired her with Stock Aitken Waterman, the British pop makers who had made so much of Kylie and Bananarama’s big 1980s hits. We could try to surprise you that there’s a secret gem somewhere on this album but, simply put, its best-known track, “This Time I Know It’s For Real”, truly is the album’s best song, as well as probably Summer’s last iconic single.\n\nSummer’s rich vocals sound oddly dissonant on this album’s synthetic beats. But here it feels like something really matches up: it’s a big, sweeping song that you can still have a little boogie to if the vibe is right, and Summer feels very comfortable performing it. Though Another Place And Time often has the energy of your aunt trying to do “Never Gonna Give You Up” at a karaoke party, it still produced a song that proved the power and skill of one of the world’s greatest dance music icons.\n\nNow read\n\n16 Diana Ross songs to cushion the blow of missing her Glastonbury set\n\nTen Blondie songs that changed new wave\n\n15 Ray Charles songs that prove he was one of the greats"
