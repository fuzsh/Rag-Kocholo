They are a testament to the continuing relevance of Donna Summer's music in popular culture and the deep and enduring passion of her multi-generational fan base.”\n\nThe top lot of the sale was Billboard Disco Forum VI Award Presented to Donna Summer, 1979, which realized $47,880, more than 120 times its low estimate.

Chairman of the Board, Woman at Sunset, and Scarlet Starlette realized $27,720 each. Another Donna Summer painting, Tokyo Love Song, realized $ 23,940.\n\nPhotographs offered in the sale performed exceptionally well, notably, Two Polaroids of Donna Summer, sold for $13,860, almost 28 times against its low estimate.
