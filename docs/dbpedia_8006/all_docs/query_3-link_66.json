        "text": "The results are in! Let’s begin the countdown of the ten most visited (and hopefully read) posts of 2019. There are now 665 posts on this site for your delectation and it does seem you enjoy digging around for older posts as only one of my 2019 Top 10 actually appeared this year, the rest were posted before 2019 started and in a couple of cases didn’t cause that much interest at the time and have become slow burners. There have been 95 new posts this year which is a little down from my peak numbers but I’m still pretty proud of myself thinking this is pretty good going after nearly 5 years as reviewsrevues.com.\n\nThe counters were all zeroed last January 1st so these reflect the most read posts since then. The figures in brackets relate to when I last has a countdown back in April when I was celebrating the 600th post. To read the original reviews (and bump up their figures even further) just click on the link to the post.\n\n10 (-) 63 Up– This is the only new post from 2019. This seven yearly update of a group of participants began back in 1964 when they were seven years old. In June this year we had the latest in what is always a five star experience. Shown as a three parter with director Michael Apted still at the helm this is an experiment which at the time it commenced was revolutionary and now is just fascinating.\n\n9 (3) Atlantic Ballroom – Waldeck CD review as part of my rather sparse Music Now Thread (although I may have more time to concentrate on this now that the Essential CD rundown is complete). Originally posted in November 2018.\n\n8 (8) Mary Portas; Secret Shopper. Posted in January 2016. This Channel 4 series saw Mary investigating customer service.\n\n7 (7) Once Upon A Time – Donna Summer. Posted in March 2018. This 1977 double album which I placed at #85 on my Essential CD list has this year been the most read of my CD reviews\n\n6 (4) The Diary Of Two Nobodies – Giles Wood & Mary Killen. Posted in Jan 2018. The “Gogglebox” pair still pulling in people interested in finding out more about them away from their TV viewing chairs.\n\n5 (-) Nutshell – Ian McEwan. Posted in April 2016. I will hopefully get round to reading and reviewing author McEwan’s 2019 published “Machines Like Me” (as featured on my 2019- What I Should Have Read post). In the meantime plenty of you still want to know what I thought about this original crime novel.\n\n4 (2) Scott and Bailey – Also posted in April 2016. The 5th and final series of this obviously much missed TV series seems to have become established as the most read of my television reviews.\n\n3(-) Past Caring – Robert Goddard. I was exploring Robert Goddard’s back catalogue in January 2018 when I posted a review of his novel from 1986. I didn’t love this early work and did feel confident that he has written some real gems in the twenty-five or so novels since this. He is one of those authors who people when returning his library books are very keen to recommend to me. I should certainly seek out more by him in 2020.\n\n2(-) The Dark Circle – Linda Grant. Her 2019 published “A Stranger City” just missed out on my end of year Top 10 but you still seem to be seeking out her 2016 novel the review of which I posted in October of that year. This was her 7th novel and is set largely in a TB sanatorium in post-war Britain. This has been the most read fiction review this year.\n\n1(1) This Is Going To Hurt – Adam Kay– Came in as a new entry in the 600th post and is now looking established at the top of the pile. His much awaited “T’Was The Nightshift Before Christmas” was a much slimmer tome than hoped for but no doubt found its way into many stockings over the festive period, but this is the book which Kay fans will return to. The interest in this review is no surprise, despite the book being published in 2017 and not being picked up by me until November 2018 this is (according to the bestseller.co.uk website) the third biggest selling book in Britain in 2019.\n\nThe new entries\n\nIn my next couple of posts I’m intending to look ahead to what should be coming up in 2020 book-wise and also scouting around the blogosphere to see what some of the other bloggers have really enjoyed in 2019 before we knuckle down to the real reviewing business in 2020!\n\nWhat is the right thing to do when just as your biography is going to press the subject dies? Do you hold back publication and revise its contents? I think I would probably say yes to this. Do you carry on and publish anyway after all, knowing that not many readers will know when a book actually came out, that’s a possibility. What Nik A Ramli does in his first piece of biographical non-fiction is acknowledge the passing in an author’s note at the start of the book, use the dates of the life (1948-2012) prominently on the cover but does not change the main text one iota. I’m not sure whether that’s appropriate.\n\nThat decision leads to a slightly off taste as Ramli focuses on the legendary disco star’s past, present and future in later chapters such as “Still Going Strong: A New Departure” and “Into The Future” when he makes it clear elsewhere that he knows that there isn’t going to be any future.\n\nNow I, like Ramli, who is better known as a Malaysian Interior Designer who specialises in “laid back glamour” am a big Donna Summer fan. I have included four of her albums in my Essential CD listings. I feel that up to now she has not been served well by the printed word. I read an early 80’s unauthorised biography which said little and even “Ordinary Girl” her 2003 autobiography written with Marc Eliot was a disappointment which just skimmed the surface. There is room for a definitive examination of the life and career of one of the most successful female artists of all time whose record sales reputedly exceed 130 million. I’d always hoped that someone like J. Randy Taraborrelli would apply his thorough, analytical eye to her and produce something very entertaining but this hasn’t happened.\n\nRamli has produced what is very much a fan’s viewpoint which borders on hagiography. I have no problems with that, the whole work comes across as a labour of love and I always admire these. He’s done tons of research and seemingly watched and read everything and has carried out interviews with people qualified to comment on Donna’s career including DJ Paul Gambaccini, fellow disco-diva Gloria Gaynor and her one-time producer and great supporter Pete Waterman. Unfortunately, what he hasn’t done is put this research all together very well. This is a first-time writer in need of support to structure a convincing narrative and that support (and editing) obviously wasn’t there. The style is breathless throughout, which becomes a little overwhelming, there is so much repetition, an over-reliance on listing the same statistics and song titles to illustrate laboured points, a cheesy use of song titles within the text of the she certainly “works hard for the money” type, factual errors even I’ve spotted, non-sequiturs a-plenty and a tendency to go off on odd tangents, but mainly it’s the repetition that wearies.\n\nHe rattles through her whole career in the first few chapters and with a considerable amount of the book to go a clearer structure would have helped matters. He’s read Taraborrelli’s superior music biogs according to the bibliography, it is disappointing that from these he didn’t get a clearer idea of how to put together his work.\n\nWhat Ramili does well, however, is to get a global perspective. He’s more obsessed about listing chart positions than I am, we get to know how Donna Summer’s work performed in many markets together with listings of weeks spent in both US and UK charts. I also like how he has got contributions from Malaysian performers about the influence of this American girl from Boston who found fame initially in Germany.\n\nThe issue that affected the performer was how much “Donna Summer” was a creation of her producers and then her record label. She was created to fit in with the hedonism of mid 70’s disco, with an aura of soft-porn chic which captured the zeitgeist of the time. This image was different to how Donna Summer wanted to be seen both in terms of her beliefs and her need not to be pigeonholed as an act of a moment. Her disco days were glorious with some superb tracks, brilliantly performed, but she wanted to see and she had the talent to see beyond that, sensing that disco might not last forever. When it did end in the US with that notorious record burning in a Chicago sportsfield which I’ve mentioned a number of times before (see “Turn The Beat Around” by Peter Shapiro), Donna was ready to move on and embrace rock, new wave and more mainstream pop. Over time chart positions dwindled and an alleged comment about AIDS alienated a large gay fanbase. That disco ball would never entirely go away, however, and the demand for the back catalogue of the Disco Donna Summer, like the Disco Gloria Gaynor, would keep re-appearing over the decades. In latter years Donna began once again to fully embrace this and saw a career revival and a demand for new material in the years up to her sudden and shocking death from lung cancer aged 64.\n\nShe should be seen as one of the greatest performers of her era, alongside Barbra Streisand (with whom she famously vocally duelled with on “No More Tears”), Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner and Diana Ross. The fact that she does not always share a pedestal with these artists critically means she is still due for reappraisal. Ramli’s work provided a welcome opportunity for this but he doesn’t quite pull it off.\n\nDonna Summer; The Thrill Goes On was published by Book Guild Publishing in 2012.\n\nAfter The Dance (Telstar 1991)\n\nThis 32 track double CD which came out on the TV promoted Telstar label in 1991 puts together a collection of some of the best sweet soul tunes from the 70’s and 80’s. It is a sophisticated listen with quality performers and a good mixture of the well and lesser known, of hits and tracks that did not make it. There’s a smattering of Motown, Philadelphia International releases alongside Stax and Atlantic with the soul groups who were popular in the early 70’s alongside a few more mid-tempo offerings from artists associated with disco and a few R&B influenced tracks from the 80’s. The earliest dates from a slab of pure soul from Aretha in 1967 and spans to a debut minor 1987 hit for British soulster Paul Johnson of whom big things would have still been hoped for when this album was released in 1991. Once you get by the disturbing cover art there are a lot of gems to be found within.\n\nWith these essential CDs it is important to know what tracks can be found on them so here you will find them listed with their highest chart position (UK/US) if released as a single and links if I have more information on the artist elsewhere on the blog. I’ll pick out a handful of tracks to give a flavour of what makes these CDs essential.\n\nTrack Listings\n\nCD 1\n\n1.Me And Mrs Jones – Billy Paul (1972) (UK#12, US#1)\n\nWhat a gem of a track to kick things off with. A song about adultery written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff with Cary Gilbert would not have seemed an obvious pick for a debut number 1 pop hit but Billy Paul’s superb, tender performance won over audiences worldwide and introduced us all to one of the most unique voices in soul music with his jazz style phrasing . Amazingly, Paul only scored one more US Pop Top 40 hit, the sublime uptempo “Thanks For Saving My Life”. Like most artists who relied on the songwriting talents of Gamble & Huff his material alternated between out and out romance of tracks such as “When Love Is New” and the mawkish “Let’s Make A Baby” and social commentary such as “Am I Black Enough For You?” and “Bring The Family Back”. He was also a great song-stylist as his versions of his trio of 1977 UK hits, in particular, Elton John’s “Your Song” (a UK#37 hit), but also Paul McCartney’s “Let Em In” (UK #26) and Jerry Butler’s “Only The Strong Survive” (UK#33) testify. But it is for tale of a secret rendezvous for which he will always be remembered. Billy Paul passed away in 2016 aged 81.\n\n2. Love Won’t Let Me Wait – Major Harris (1975) (UK#37, US#5)\n\nPerhaps one of the all-time tender love songs Major Harris, is here like much of Barry White’s output concentrating on the bedroom in this soft-porn epic with heavy breathing which would have denied it much daytime radio play and might explain its lowly UK chart placing. The Major had a member of the Delfonics in the early 70’s (but after the hit for the group which appears on this CD) and Atlantic Records had high hopes of him becoming a major solo star but this was his only US chart placing. He continued to record on various labels until the mid 90’s with only his 1983 London label release “All My Life” attracting any attention in the UK. Once again this great performance is what he is remembered for.\n\n3. I’ll Be Good To You- Brothers Johnson (1976) (US#3)\n\n4. Peek-A-Boo- The Stylistics (1973) (UK#35)\n\n5.Didn’t I Blow Your Mind (This Time) – The Delfonics (1970) (UK#22, US#10)\n\n6. Homely Girl – The Chi-Lites (1974) (UK#5)\n\n7. You Are My Starship – Norman Connors ft Michael Henderson (1976) (US#27)\n\n8. Games People Play – Detroit Spinners (1975) (US#5)\n\n9. Walk Away From Love – David Ruffin (1975) (UK#10, US#9)\n\nAnother of the great voices of soul music. Ruffin’s gravelly voice blistered its way through many Temptations hit and as a solo artist did not reach the heights expected of him, although this was at least in part to his own personal demons. For me, his greatest association was his mid 70’s teaming up with Van McCoy. This is where McCoy’s work was strongest, the albums he did with Ruffin, with Melba Moore and Faith, Hope & Charity had powerful gospel-drenched voices cutting through his Soul City Symphony lushness in a way that his work with the sweeter voiced Stylistics did not. This is one of Motown’s great 70’s singles and a welcome comeback for the man whose only US hit had been six years previous and who in the UK was overshadowed by brother Jimmy.\n\nThere was a lot of hat-wearing on 70’s R&B album covers!\n\n10. Loving You, Losing You – Phyllis Hyman (1977)\n\nAnd whilst we are talking about personal demons, the hugely under-rated Phyllis was plagued with them which led to her taking her own life in 1985. Album releases on Buddah, Arista and Philadelphia showed huge potential but she may have been too sophisticated for the commercial masses. There were business disappointments throughout her career, a James Bond theme recording never made it on to the film, collaborations with artists ranging from Barry Manilow, The Four Tops and Michael Henderson (whose “You Are My Starship” also appears here) did not pay the dividends expected and a dependency on cocaine sealed an inevitable and tragic early demise. It’s inexplicable how this club classic from her debut album failed to make chart headway in 1977. It opens with an epic sweep, a great introduction before Phyllis performs beautifully on this Thom Bell song.\n\n11. Risin’ To The Top – Keni Burke (1982)\n\n12. Love Me – Diana Ross (1974) (UK#38) (also on Motown Chartbusters Volume 9)\n\n13.Still Water (Love) – Four Tops (1970) (UK#10, US#11)\n\n14. I’ll Be There – Jackson 5 (1970) (UK#4, US#1)\n\n15. Winter Melody – Donna Summer (1976) (UK#27)\n\nThe first indication that Donna Summer would survive the disco boom was this under-stated ballad track from her themed “Four Seasons Of Love” which surprisingly became a hit in the UK over Christmas 1976. It’s ethereal, whispy Donna and it is always a joy to hear. Because of it’s non-success in her homeland it often does not appear on Summer compilations, for example, its not on the essential “Anthology” release nor on “Hit Singles & More” nor “I Feel Love: The Collection” but can be found here as well us on the three CD “Ultimate Collection”. It’s a lovely track which shows a different side of Donna.\n\n16. Natural High- Bloodstone (1973) (UK#40, US#10)\n\nCD 2\n\n1.Rolling Down A Mountainside – The Main Ingredient (1975)\n\n2.Freedom For The Stallion – The Hues Corporation (1974)\n\n3. Shake You Down – Gregory Abbott (1986) (UK#6, US#1)\n\nWhat on earth happened here? The title track from Abbott’s debut self-written and self-produced album leapt to the top of the US charts and was a big hit worldwide introducing us all to a classy, slick piece of mid-tempo sing-along soul. Record label Columbia must have thought they had the next big thing on their hands. A gifted good-looking all-rounder the album went platinum and then… well, nothing to bother chart compilers although he has continued to record to the present day. It’s one of those weird occasions when the world fell in love with a performer and then fell out of love just as quickly with this highly talented singer becoming one of the ultimate one-hit-wonders on both side of the Atlantic. Obviously, the real strength here must be the song, which Abbott wrote, and it still sounds good.\n\n4. You Can’t Change That – Ray Parker Jnr (1979)\n\n5. Let Me Make Love To You – The O’Jays (1975)\n\n6. When Love Comes Calling – Paul Johnson (1987) (UK#52)\n\n7. Private Number – William Bell & Judy Clay (1968) (UK#8)\n\n8. I Surrender -Heatwave (1990)\n\n9. Could It Be I’m Falling In Love – Detroit Spinners (1973) (UK#11, US#4)\n\nOr the Spinners as they are known in their homeland but here we need something to differentiate them from the folk group of the same name. Whilst at Motown they were known as The Motown Spinners and recorded some great tracks but it was after the move to Atlantic where they really came into their own. There are two of their very best tracks included on these CDs and this is one of their best known although I’ve always been a big fan of the slightly less slick “Games People Play” which was not a UK hit but a Top 5 hit stateside. The magic kicked in when they began working with songwriter Thom Bell and vocalist Phillippe Wynn joined the group. Lead vocals were shared between three members which gave them longevity and yet meant their sound was not as instantly recognisable as some of the R&B groups of the time. They had two chart-topping singles, in the US it was with a duet with Dionne Warwick in 1974 but they had to wait until 1980 to do it in the UK with their medley of “Working My Way Back To You” and “Forgive Me Girl” which sounded a little pedestrian compared to some of the great tracks that came before.\n\n10. I’m Doing Fine Now – New York City (1973) (UK#20, US#17)\n\n11. (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman – Aretha Franklin (1967) (US#8)\n\n12. Free- Deniece Williams (1977) (UK#1, US#25)\n\nWith hindsight there wasn’t a more influential American R&B group in the 1970’s than Earth, Wind & Fire but the only UK number 1 single they were involved with came not from themselves, despite so many classic tracks, nor with The Emotions, who had one of the 70’s biggest hits in the US with “Best Of My Love” but with this subtle, sophisticated performance from Deniece Williams who had moved from working with Stevie Wonder as one of his backing singers to a debut album produced by Maurice White and Charles Stepney. This track doesn’t even feel that commercial even compared to some of the other songs on the album and feels more like a vocal performance highlighting her incredible range than a song yet it topped the charts and Deniece Williams became a much-loved artist in the UK. Amazingly, Deniece became the first black American female solo singer to top the UK charts since Diana Ross in 1971. Post the EWF connection she scored two US chart-toppers which were also Top 3 hits in the UK, helping Johnny Mathis to a resounding comeback with the too warbly “Too Much Too Little Too Late” and the crowning glory of the “Footloose” soundtrack “Let’s Hear It For The Boy”, but this is where it all started for her.\n\n13. Honey Please, Can’t Ya See – Barry White (1975)\n\n14. Superstar/ Until You Come Back To Me – Luther Vandross (1983)\n\n15. Baby I’m Yours – Linda Lewis (1976) (UK#33)\n\nAnother huge vocal range and a greatly under-rated performer who should be treated as a British National Treasure. Too versatile to fit into the constraints of a 1970’s pop career Lewis touched on rock, folk, show tunes, operatics and soul music and was a highly regarded songwriter. Here she is in disco mode which had earlier in 1976 seen her score one of her biggest UK hits with her phenomenal version of “It’s In His Kiss” where her vocals swooped and soared over a huge production. Here she covers a Van McCoy penned song first recorded by an inspiration of hers, 60’s US soul singer Barbara Lewis from whom she took her surname. (Linda’s real name is Fredericks yet even her sisters Shirley and Dee record under the Lewis name). Once again it’s first class, yet did not get the chart position it deserved. Everything is thrown into what is perhaps even a bigger production than its predecessor and even if some felt Linda was selling out in conforming to the demands of the commercial market she certainly gives it 100%.\n\n16. I Want Your Love – Chic (1979) (UK#4, US#7)\n\nA great way to finish this CD is perhaps the classiest thing Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards ever did with Chic. Best known for more out-there disco tracks everything is reined in a little here with a great build, superb orchestration and that familiar scratchy Chic sound. Nile of course, is still very much influencing the music business, a favourite at festivals and it is because of tracks like this that his music has transcended the decades.\n\nAfter The Dance is currently available on Amazon in the UK for £4.97 and used for £0.62.

There are quite a number to choose from but I have gone for the double CD Anthology which appeared in 1993 and was the first up- to -that point complete career collection with 34 tracks spanning 17 years.\n\nDonna Summer was born LaDonna Adrian Gaines in 1948 and as a teenager won a part in the German production of “Hair”. She married Austrian Helmuth Sommer and anglicized his surname to become her stage-name. The marriage lasted three years, the name much longer. In Europe she began working with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte leading to her first smash hit “Love To Love You Baby”, one of my all-time favourite Disco tracks which I covered when I reviewed her first essential album “A Love Trilogy” which was released in 1976. The version on this album is the US single version, which is not actually my favourite. The British single mix is harder to find but feels more of a complete track. From “Love Trilogy” we get the single versions of “Could It Be Magic” and “Try Me, I Know We Can Make It”, which really demands to be heard in its entirety. “Spring Affair” is taken from “Four Seasons Of Love” and was the track which attracted the most attention in the discos but in the UK the ballad “Winter Melody” became the hit.\n\nFrom 1977’s “I Remember Yesterday” we get the 60’s girl-group pastiche of “Love’s Unkind” and her only UK number one, the phenomenal I Feel Love”, which really was the sound of the future and is probably one of the most significant dance tracks of all time, propelling electronic dance music to the forefront, a position it still occupies today, over forty years later. There’s three tracks from the essential “Once Upon A Time” album.\n\nBy this time Disco was huge and her Casablanca record label joined forces with Motown to put together a disco movie starring Donna and featuring a double album soundtrack. The music was at times over-produced and grandiose but the film was actually a rather understated piece which also starred Jeff Goldblum and The Commodores but it was the music that made the most impression with the best , sung by Donna, getting an Oscar , the sublime “Last Dance”, which was written by her co-star Paul Jabara. This is a track which has grown in reputation over the years but I have always loved it. It’s changes of pace were deemed a little confusing at the time which might explain why it did not even make the Top 50 in the UK. In the US it became her second Top 3 hit.\n\nThe double album “Live And More” became a huge seller in the US, giving Donna her first number 1 album. A lot of these sales were fuelled by the “studio” side which comprised three tracks put together in a non-stop close- to- eighteen -minute medley, of which two are included here. “The MacArthur Park” suite took a distinctly weird Jimmy Webb song which had been a hit when growled by actor Richard Harris and turned it into something fabulous. It is here in a lengthy six and a half minute promotional single version which gives it a chance to show its epic sweep and once again the changes of pace which were to be a feature for Donna in the latter disco years. Her first US number 1 single (“I Feel Love” had inexplicably stalled at #6) it got to number 5 in the UK. This eases into, as it did in the original album, the almost as good “Heaven Knows” in which Donna sings with fellow Casablanca signings Brooklyn Dreams. This got to number 4 in the US but a lowly 34 in the UK. This was a significant track in Donna’s life as the following year she was to marry lead singer Bruce Sudano, with whom she would spend the rest of her life.\n\nThe first CD has really peaked here as far as I am concerned but is rounded off by four tracks from the huge “Bad Girls” album. Two of the tracks most associated with Donna are the title track (US#1, UK#14) and “Hot Stuff (US#1, UK#11) both here in their full 12” version. There’s more changes of pace in “Dim All The Lights” (US#2,UK#29). Of the tracks from this US double platinum #1 album, the biggest seller in her career I have always preferred the more electronic European feel of “The Anthology’s” closing track on the first disc, “Sunset People”.\n\nCD 2 opens with a real tour-de-force which topped off Donna’s most commercially successful year with her third US number 1 single of 1979. More of a singing contest than a track it paired the Disco Queen with the Showtunes Queen- Summer vs Streisand. It’s incredible to think that at the start of Donna’s hit career many people thought that she could not even sing and here she is matching one of the most celebrated singers note for note. In the UK this became Donna’s third Top 3 hit. Her final hurrah to disco came with “On The Radio”, another song which has become more familiar in the UK over the years, at one time it was a regular choice for competitors on TV talent shows and soap star turned pop star Martine McCutcheon significantly bettered Donna’s original number 32 placing when she took it to number 7 in 2001. In the US it reached number 5, which was her lowest chart placing for a couple of years. It’s a song with a slightly odd narrative, I never understood how a letter which felt out of a pocket in an old brown overcoat ended up being read out on the radio, but then Donna had been convincing when she left her cake out in the rain. It’s a great vocal but lyrically just a little strange.\n\nAnd then in the US, disco was over. The response from Summer, Moroder and Bellotte was to release an album with a distinct rock-chick feel. Summer had moved away from Casablanca Records with its strong disco emphasis and signed up to Geffen Records. It was a new start but I, for the first time, didn’t really buy into it. As someone who had always preferred her more European sounding tracks it was a step too far into the rock arena. Donna was keen to get away from the sexy disco siren image not least in part because she had become a born-again Christian. Commercially, her UK fans agreed with me as it became her lowest selling album to date. The title track reached number 3 in the US but follow up “Cold Love” stalled at 33, although did garner Donna a Grammy nomination for best female rock vocal. Her next album was not even approved for release by her new label. From it we get the title track “I’m A Rainbow” and her version of “Don’t Cry For Me Argentina” played straight, which became a staple in her live shows. It was not released until 1986 and it marked the last album in the ten year partnership of the artist with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte.\n\nThe next album had more than an element of reinvention about it. It is unusual for an artist this far on in their career to release an eponymous album- 1982’s “Donna Summer” being set out as a new start. Producer Quincy Jones did a very good job, the songs have a range of style from jazz standards, to ballads, to rock tinged tracks. From this we get US#10, UK#18 “Love Is In Control” and the odd but fascinating version of a Jon & Vangelis song “State Of Independence” which put Donna in front of an all-star gospel choir including Michael Jackson and Dionne Warwick. This became the big hit track in the UK reaching number 14 and giving Donna her highest UK studio album chart placing since “I Remember Yesterday”.\n\nThere wasn’t too much that was great about the next couple of album releases, “Anthology” cherry-picks the most worthwhile tracks from “She Works Hard For The Money” and “Cats Without Claws”. The very good title track from “All Systems Go” is here. Her one album dalliance with Stock Aitken and Waterman brought about one of her (and their) best ever recordings. I consider “Another Time And Place” (from this we get “This Time I Know It’s For Real” and “I Don’t Want To Get Hurt) to be an Essential CD. The magic didn’t carry on for her next album “Mistaken Identity” but two of the better tracks are here.\n\nThis CD does end with a good enough reason for the Summer fan to purchase “Anthology” as in 1992 Donna guest vocaled on a track by old friend Giorgio Moroder on a project called “Forever Dancing”. This track “Carry On” seemed to turn back the years and I I wish it could have led on to more recordings with the producer and his greatest muse.\n\nPost “Anthology” Donna made the occasional single -the best being her number 21 UK hit “Melody Of Love” from 1994 and a fairly breath-taking version of “I Will Go With You (Con Te Partiro)” from 1999 which took the song better known as “Time To Say Goodbye” out of the funeral services, for which it has become a staple and into the dance clubs. I thought this would be a huge hit for her but it wasn’t. Her final album “Crayons” released in 2008 after a 14 year gap after her previous very worthwhile Christmas album was a strong attempt at giving Donna a contemporary club edge and healthy sales seemed like it could be the beginning of a new phase in her recording career.\n\nHer death in 2012 came as a complete shock and was one of those passings that makes you feel that a phase in your own life has come to an end. Her final illness was kept quiet as lung cancer claimed her. It was Donna’s belief that this was brought on by toxic dust she inhaled by being in the proximity of New York on 9/11. She was the artist I felt that I had grown up with and even when some of her recordings in the mid 80’s did not inspire me greatly I was always delighted when her music was in the charts and she was in the public eye.\n\nI’ve gone for “Anthology” because it does have a number of those tracks on CDs which I never made the transfer from vinyl to. There are omissions, especially with tracks which hit bigger in the UK (no “Winter Melody”, no “Down Deep Inside” no “Dinner With Gershwin”). If you are looking for these tracks I suggest you go for “The Journey – The Very Best Of”, which got to number 6 in the UK charts in 2004 (but still no “Winter Melody”) or the three disc “Ultimate Collection” (2016 UK#30) which has all of the above, some of Donna’s German pre-hit recordings as well as tracks that I have never owned and which the completist in me is telling me to purchase. 58 tracks, I’m sure it’s only a matter of time…………………………\n\nDonna Summer in a live tribute to David Foster from 2008 bringing the show to a resounding close with “Last Dance”.\n\nThe Donna Summer Anthology now only seems to be available on Amazon UK as a used import with prices ranging from £1.95 to £700.38 (you make your choice!). In the US it is more readily available new currently for $29.99 and used from $1.98. There are many other Donna Summer compilations available.\n\nAnother Place And Time – Donna Summer (WEA 1989)\n\nUK Chart Position – 17\n\nIt had been nearly twelve years since Donna Summer’s previous essential album “Once Upon A Time”. In the meantime her career had reached stratospheric levels with US number 1 pop albums (“Live And More” and “Bad Girls”) and had also hit the doldrums. Disco had been and gone and in the US there had been a backlash against Disco artists so Donna found herself needing to diversify, not always with great results. Her career was also further complicated by her becoming a born-again Christian causing her to play down some of the raunchier hits in her back catalogue and then there was a comment she was reported to have made about AIDS which seriously affected her standing with the gay record buying market, who had been amongst her strongest supporters since day one. Donna Summer always denied making such statements but it did have a significantly detrimental effect on her career.\n\nThroughout the 80’s Donna continued to record with some success but the career lacked consistency and the quality of albums was patchy. She did come very close to being essential with her 1982 release “Donna Summer” produced by Quincy Jones. Donna was pregnant at the time of recording and claimed not to have responded well to Jones’ methods of working. There were some great tracks on this album and a lot of musical styles which showed the versatility of the artist on big gospelesque numbers like the Vangelis penned hit single “State Of Independence”, on Bruce Springsteen rock and with a jazz standard “Lush Life”, in which, whatever Donna herself thought, she turned out one of her greatest vocal performances. This album also marked her move away from Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte for the first time.\n\nLater 80’s albums (here I’m including “She Works Hard For The Money” and “Cats Without Claws” )just didn’t do it for me. Her “All Systems Go” album from 1987 was the first in her hit career not to make any impression on the US and UK album charts. It wasn’t even a bad album, her star had just waned. Around this time I saw her perform live for the first of two times at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where there were protests outside against her reported comments. She was excellent that night, as she was when I saw her again some years later but it did seem like the hits might have dried up.\n\nLike both other veteran female performers Tina Turner and Liza Minelli it was the British who saved the day. Turner had become a global star again following her association with Heaven 17 and Minelli found herself making pop charts for the first time ever when she worked with the Pet Shop Boys a bit later on in the same year that Donna made her comeback. And it was a comeback, scoring in the UK her highest charting album for 11 years and three Top 20 singles. In the US it gave her a first Top 10 single for 6 years. In 1989 Donna was back and it was thanks to Stock, Aitken and Waterman.\n\nThis song-writing and production team, known as the Hit Factory by the time they began working with Donna had scored number 1 singles for Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Rick Astley, Dead Or Alive, Sonia and Mel and Kim amongst others with a high-energy sound which was spawned in the gay discos and taken into the pop charts in the UK and Europe with alarming frequency. Working with one of the original disco legends seemed a sensible move for all concerned.\n\n“Another Place And Time” has ten tracks written and produced by the team with two tracks penned alongside the artist. Why it works so well as an album is that for the first time since her peak of her work with Moroder and Bellotte it gave her a clear identity as a performer, the songs feel cohesive. True, they fitted perfectly into the pop-dance pocket which Stock, Aitken and Waterman had found for themselves and the songs could have worked easily as well for Kylie or even Hazell Dean but the Summer Legend gave the whole thing a little extra sparkle and the end result was something really very special. Stock, Aitken and Waterman were reputed to say that this was their favourite of the albums they worked on, and it is easy to see why.\n\nThe album’s star turn comes in at track three and is certainly indicative of both the best of Summer and SAW’s work. “This Time I Know It’s For Real” is an absolute gem of a single. Released a month or so before the album it soared up to number 3 in the UK, a position she had last attained ten years before with her vocal battle-to-the-death duet with Barbra Streisand “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)”. It got to number 7 in the US, where there had been a certain amount of record label scurrying around before it appeared on Atlantic Records. It saw her back at the top of the Billboard US Dance charts and was a big hit, in amongst other markets, Norway (#3). Ireland (#4), France (#6), Netherlands (#5) and Canada (#7). It’s a joyous song which celebrates love and wants to proclaim it anyway possible.\n\nThe CD opener “I Don’t Want To Get Hurt” followed its predecessor up the charts reaching number 7 in the UK. It was a smaller hit in Europe (although got to number 3 in Ireland) and was not released as a single in the US. It might have been tempting to put out a whole album of tracks aimed at the dance floor but there is variety here, with slower tracks such as the title track and “Breakaway” which was the track on the album which refused to die as it was released as a single not far off two years after the release of the album and made the UK Top 50.\n\nDonna also made the UK Top 20 with the closer “Love’s About To Change My Heart”. On the album this has a great instrumental coda which rounds things off perfectly which was not present on the single mix. The album version was much better. The slow start kicking into an uptempo track brought to mind what felt like a bit of a trademark from Donna’s golden era, present on some of her biggest hits from her golden era (“Last Dance”, “No More Tears”, “On The Radio”, “Dim All The Lights” and, especially, “Macarthur Park”). This felt like a touch of genius from the production team who were showing their ability to update the sound and still please the fans of long-standing.\n\nThey certainly got mileage from the denim jacket photoshoot!\n\nDonna Summer and Stock, Aitken and Waterman. It all seemed to fit together so perfectly as I had expected it to do right when I heard about the collaboration. Perhaps the most surprising thing about it was the front cover art which saw Summer in Japanese Geisha make-up. One gets the feeling that this was Summer’s idea and this is confirmed by credits which state she came up with the concept with photographer Lawrence Lawry. Donna Summer was also a painter and the image has the feel of some of her artwork.\n\nDriven By The Music by Donna Summer\n\nIn the US label issues meant that sales were damaged by high levels of import purchases and by the time the album appeared on the Atlantic label a high chart placing seemed out of the question. Having said that it still performed better than its predecessor. Back in 1989 this seemed just like a taster for more good stuff to come. Donna fitted into the Hit Factory set-up so well that I was ready for a long association with the producers. A second album was proposed but due to difficulties with record label contracts never happened. What felt like a return to previous chart glories was too short-lived. This would also be the last essential Donna Summer release. Her 1991 Atlantic album “Mistaken Identity” was sadly without much identity. Returning to Mercury she put out a first class Christmas album (there’s only one essential Christmas album) in 1994 and her 2008 swansong “Crayons” was a big success in her homeland and certainly had its moments and could have paved the way for an even bigger career renaissance in her sixties. Donna Summer sadly died aged 62 in 2012.\n\nAnother Place And Time is currently available from Amazon in the UK for £7.82 and used from £0.09. It can be downloaded for £7.99.

Her last essential album “A Love Trilogy” had been released in May 1976 and by the end of that year “Four Seasons Of Love” had arrived. This tied in with the Christmas market (I got it as a Christmas present that year, I recall) and actually had a free 1977 calendar inside. Visually, it was certainly different to what had gone before as the soft-focus images of Donna were replaced by strong, sharp photos . Donna was perched on a moon on the front cover and posed as Marilyn Monroe in a recreation of the iconic white dress blowing-up scene from “The Seven Year Itch”. Musically, it felt a little stingy, with four tracks covering the seasons and a reprise of one track which had gone on for too long anyway. It didn’t perform nearly as well as the two albums which preceded it and it did seem like Donna’s career might be one of diminishing returns. In the US it proved to be the second album in a row without a Top 40 hit single. In the UK, bizarrely for a woman known as the Disco Queen, it was the pretty ballad track “Winter Melody” which caught the public imagination and its number 27 chart placing meant she could no longer be considered a one-hit wonder.\n\nEverything changed in the summer of 1977 when the album “I Remember Yesterday” hit the streets. It’s a strong album with a first side of three retro pop tracks, which took in a disco take on the 1940’s with the title track and two 60’s girl-group inspired tracks. On the second side amidst the strong soul ballad and okay disco tracks was the sound of the future. Left until last, “I Feel Love” was completely different to anything we had heard before and set a benchmark for electronic dance music which can still be felt today. It is often credited as being the most influential dance track of all time. The record buyers of 1977 loved it, the single became Donna’s only UK #1 and got to number 6 in the US. Donna’s superstar status which I had believed in from the first moans of “Love To Love You Baby” was confirmed. Each one of the side 1 tracks became a UK Top 40 hit and by mid 1977 Donna was inescapable in the UK. A change of distribution from GTO who had put out her records to her US label Casablanca meant that both labels were putting out product. Her sublime song taken from the soundtrack of the hit movie “The Deep”, “Down Deep Inside” gave her a third Top 5 hit , “Love’s Unkind” from the GTO released album reached number 3 and 10 months later the fourth track to be released from the album “Back In Love Again” reached #29. The album reached #3 in the UK and #18 in the US. At the time I loved it, but I don’t consider it to be essential now. It does have essential tracks upon it and although it felt much more like a traditional album than what had been released before it just falls short, as an album, of her very best releases. I think the first side medley is just a little cutesy although there was no denying its commercial appeal in 1977.\n\n“Once Upon A Time” was the follow-up and Donna fans who were not being saturated in her product didn’t have long to wait as this appeared in November 1977. What’s more this was a double album, which was certainly putting demands on the purse strings of record buyers, as these were expensive and not always the best value for money. On previous albums there had rarely been as many as five tracks, here there were fourteen plus a couple of reprises. This was Donna’s best chance to show us what kind of artist she really was over more than a handful of songs.\n\nOnce again there was a concept. Here (and I know this doesn’t sound that promising as I write it) the concept was based around a poem written by Donna of a girl inhabiting a fairy tale world entering real life and looking for love and the tracks were contained within “Acts” as in a play. It was “Cinderella” with a disco beat and what we have here is really the blueprint for a musical that never happened. You don’t need to buy into the theme to make this album work. It contains some great tracks from the Summer/Moroder/Bellotte team with Donna penning more thoughtful lyrics rather than refrains to fit in with the electronic visions of the musicians. It was a much broader album than all that had gone before and the additional length meant that Donna could offer more variation without disappointing her disco fans.\n\nThis was recorded once again at the Musicland Studios in Munich and yet it is the most American sounding album to date with the European influences which dominated her previous material now used more subtly. With this selection of songs Donna switches between a narrator’s role and main character as it follows (not always perceptibly) the framework of a modern-day fairy story. We start off firmly in fairyland with opener “Once Upon A Time” which always sounded like a hit single to these ears. There’s an epic sweeping film-score introduction which settles into a strutting, mid-tempo number and very good use of backing singers. It’s very much the Overture to Act One . It sets out the concept of the album, musical themes from it will be used from to time to time culminating in the final track where Donna largely speaks the poem which links the whole thing to a slower version of the track, which is nowhere near as bad as it sounds.\n\nThe rest of Act One takes a darker turn with “Faster And Faster To Nowhere” where the tempo speeds up and the whole thing becomes a little trippy;\n\n“It’s a nightmare, daymare, it’s a bad ‘mare not matter which way ‘mare”\n\nAfter the sweetness of the previous track this driving slice of simmering paranoia works really well, even the male bass voice intoning that we are on “a trip to nowhere” hits home. In case we’re getting too chilled there’s an extra sugar coating on “Fairy Tale High” with a wide-eyed coy performance from Donna saved from absolute tweeness by some good things going on in the rhythm arrangements especially handclaps and a good bit of electronic wizardry from Moroder mid-way through. This gives way to the rockier sound of “Say Something Nice” one of the more ordinary tracks on the album. It gives an indication of the direction Donna will increasingly move towards over the next few years as she attempted to move away from the disco tracks which defined her.\n\nBellotte, Summer and Moroder\n\nWhen I bought this album I would have been more than happy with a selection of tracks along the lines of “I Feel Love” so it is no wonder that the side I played most on my vinyl copy was Act 2, which boasted the stronger disco tracks with a couple of them having that bleak, industrial feel that I really loved and were reminiscent of what both Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd were doing at the time. “Now I Need You” is the album’s high-spot and once again was never released as a single. It’s a cross between “I Feel Love” and the later hit she had with Quincy Jones as producer “State Of Independence” with its big gospel-esque choir which manages to add warmth and colour to the coolness of the arrangement. A dominant pulse beats throughout with something sounding like someone pumping up a tyre. The beat, Donna in whispering mode and the choir make a real gem of a track, which has only got better with time.\n\nMoroder, Summer and Bellotte in later years\n\nThe bleakness continues with “Working The Midnight Shift” with its great electronic introduction. These two tracks would still sound good on the dancefloor today and with Donna being a popular choice for remixers , it’s quite surprising that reworking of these two tracks have not ever made the charts. The disco side closes with “Queen For A Day”, a more pop influenced proposition with some pretty daft lyrics but some real creative work from the production team going on really lifts this.\n\nAct 3 sees Donna getting rocky once again with “If You Got It Flaunt It” and slowing the whole thing down for a couple of ballads “A Man Like You” and “Sweet Romance” which show her versatility as a performer as probably never before. “Sweet Romance” is a quasi-religious track as Donna turns to higher forces to find the man she is looking for. There’s a Caribbean feel to “Dance Into My Life” in its which reminds me a little of another hit track she would have in later years when she worked with British teen group Musical Youth for “Unconditional Love”. Although this is Disco flavoured it would be very hard to dance to as it stops and starts throughout.\n\nYou have to wait for Side 4 to get the two UK Top 20 hits off the album and they come back to back. “Rumour Has It” (UK#19) is a track I wasn’t that fussed about at the time and was surprised it was chosen as a single but I do think it has stood the test of time and sounds as good (if not better) than it did then. The bigger hit “I Love You” (UK#10) is a much better proposition which brings us back to the “Cinderella” theme as Donna reverts to being the narrator of the moment when this particular Prince Charming meets his love. It’s warm and joyous and boasts a great performance from Donna. The theme is rounded up with “Happily Ever After”, an attractive but unsensational track before Donna speaks her way through the main musical theme with the poem which is central to the concept. It’s a rather odd finale and veers close to the self-indulgent but there is something about it, especially once it gets going about mid-way through when it has a kind of “War Of The Worlds” feel .\n\nAt this point in her career Donna was performing better chart-wise in the UK and Europe than in her homeland. This album spawned two sizeable UK hits but only “I Love You” would just scrape into the US Top 40. This would change when she began a run of 8 US Top 5 singles (including three #1s) in 1978 and 1979. These were the golden Summer years and there were some great singles but album wise there would be nothing more that I would consider essential with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte and after their partnership ended there would be some substandard work with other producers. I always suspected that she would be back with a top quality album but we had to wait a while for it.\n\nOnce Upon A Time is currently available from Amazon in the UK for £10.30 and used from £5.58. It can be downloaded for £8.99 . In the US it is available for $7.39 and used for $3.39. In the UK it is available to stream on Spotify.\n\nA Love Trilogy -Donna Summer (Casablanca 1976)\n\nUK Chart Position – 41\n\nUS Chart Position – 21\n\nThe worldwide success of Donna Summer’s debut hit “Love To Love You Baby” took everyone by surprise. The singer spoke of the recording of it as just messing around in the studio and did not expect it to be a single. Recorded in Munich, it was the producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte’s nod to another controversial European success, the French legend Serge Gainsbourg’s and English actress Jane Birkin’s “Je T’Aime Moi Non Plus”. Like the French track, the steaminess ensured that it was not going to get many daytime radio plays. With Disco becoming increasingly a commercial force this track took off and when Neil Bogart, head of Casablanca records heard it, he demanded a longer track. Moroder and Bellotte extended it to an 18 minute epic and put it out on one side of Donna’s second album release, named after the track. This is the song that paved the way for the 12 inch single and pop music was never the same again.\n\nIt became a huge hit and the album was propelled into charts worldwide on the strength of this track alone. I believe the 7” version which was released on the GTO label in the UK and got to number 4 is one of the greatest singles of all time. (I think the US had a slightly different edit, which didn’t build to the great choral “Love to Love you baby baby” bit towards the end). As an entire side of an album it felt overly stretched and somewhat looped. There isn’t the great progressive build of the single. The rest of the album, apart from the single’s b side “Need A Man Blues” and the fragile ballad “Whispering Waves” indicated the speed with which it had been put together to capitalise on the title track’s demand and consisted of largely throwaway pop/rock tracks where the artist lacked a clear identity.\n\nDonna Summer with Giorgio Moroder\n\nWith this second album a lot of learning had taken place and all that learning is synthesized (in more ways than one) to produce an absolute classic recording-the finest of Donna’s career and the zenith of her work with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. In the intervening months since the release of the previous album Disco had continue to grow as a musical force and the world was ready for an album that was out and out disco and not one that contained a couple of disco-friendly tracks over a mishmash of soul, R&B and pop. Technically, the production team had also moved on and were able to achieve a greater, more coherent electronic sound than on the previous album. Skills that were continue to build until they came up with one of the most important dance tracks of all time with the genius “I Feel Love” a complete game-changer a couple of years later- but that was still in the future.\n\nAlthough I played the single “Love To Love You Baby” until it virtually wore out I did not, at the time, buy the album. It just didn’t seem very good value, when I knew I had the best tracks as a single but I was determined to buy this one as soon as it was released. On the GTO label in the UK it was a thick slab of vinyl, for some reason, it was certainly the thickest album I ever owned. When vinyl got wafer-thin and the edges razor-sharp by the mid 80’s when we were being pushed to buy CDs, putting on “A Love Trilogy” felt reassuring and solid. And play it I most certainly did. There must be very few albums I have played more than this one over the years.\n\nWhilst browsing on Amazon I discovered a review for this album that I’d written 15 years ago, back in 2003. I think this is the very first review I ever published, so motivated was I to keep this album in the public consciousness and that review is still there today with the massive total of 25 people who have found it helpful! Here is what I said back then:\n\nSummer’s second album is superb. At various times in my life I have worked out what my favourite albums or CDs would be and this one is always there somewhere – it is an album which meant so much to me at the time, I knew every single note of it. Amazingly, it still sounds outstanding today. It was the follow up to her “Love To Love You Baby” album, which was a decidely hit or miss affair and did not suggest that Donna would be around too long as a recording artist. The format is similar, with one long track which took the whole of the first side of the vinyl version and three shorter tracks on the second side. The long track (at 18 minutes) is “Try Me I Know We Can Make It” which is broken down into sections like “Try Me”, “I Know”, “We Can Make It”, before coming together for (you guessed it) “Try Me I Know We Can Make It”. A single was released but it was nowhere as good as the extended mix. It became a small hit in the States but didn’t really do a great deal of business over here in the UK. “Could It Be Magic” was the stand out track, a cover version of a Barry Manilow song, which was just so exciting made even more so by a breathy spoken introduction and a middle section which many ways seemed even ruder than “Love To Love You Baby”! How this wasn’t a huge hit I will never know- the Take That smash revival of the song seemed to owe more to this version than to Barry’s. I was obsessed by this album- I played it over and over again. It seemed so creative, so very then. I would still argue that it was Donna’s best album – yet sales wise it certainly did not capitalise or build on the success of the first album. Do not miss out on this CD.\n\nThe back cover of the original vinyl LP\n\nFifteen years on and I agree with every word. Why this was so far superior to what had come before was largely due to the “Try Me, I Know We Can Make It” track. True, it is largely made of those eight words repeated in various combinations many times over but the whole thing really builds and feels a much more organic piece than the extended version of “Love To Love You Baby”. There is so much going on here and it is so creative. It really is Moroder’s masterpiece. Also, what works well is that the Summer-Moroder-Bellotte partnership here feels equal and this is as much the producers’ album as the vocalist. Donna’s vocals are often wispy and ethereal, sounding as if she’s been recorded in an oxygen tent but it gives the whole thing a beauty and vulnerability and makes the sound extremely intimate (if an eighteen minute disco epic could be called intimate). The mystique of Donna Summer the artist is still strong here. You can’t tell exactly how good a singer she was (that was the case on the first album). Also, like the first album you can’t really tell what she looks like from the album cover which opted for soft focus- maintaining the 70’s soft-core porn aesthetics which had adorned the art work of “Love To Love You Baby”. There was still mileage to be had in portraying her as a kind of mythical sex goddess, which fitted in superbly with the hedonism of disco.\n\nI would imagine Donna would come to hate this picture but it fitted in with the mood of the time.\n\nI still think “Could It Be Magic” is the stand-out track but the second side of the album was not plumped out by filler as its predecessor had been. “Wasted” and “Come With Me” are both great tracks which fit in well with the concept of the album and also sound great on their own.\n\nPhotographers were also keen to convey a more wholesome image\n\nCommercially, it may have been a little ahead of its time. In the UK the Manilow cover version got to number 40, just one place above where the album stalled. It would be many years before Donna would again put out an album that did not have a US Top 40 single on it but I think this was never a singles album. It is heard best as a whole. The Canadians got it, as it became a Top 10 album there, reaching a higher position than “Love To Love You Baby” had but for most markets, commercially it was a bit of a backward step for Donna and The Munich Machine. I think Donna sounds great throughout and that the production team of Giorgio Moroder, Pete Bellotte, arranger Thor Baldurson and engineers Juergen Koppers and Mack & Hans, on the evidence here demand recognition as being amongst the most important pioneers of electronic dance music.\n\nA Love Trilogy is currently available from Amazon in the UK for £14.83 and used from £8.21.
