That song is from Donna Summer’s album, and it has been an anthem for black women who love to dance their way into the night.\n\nDonna Summer had songs that made people want to get up and move – especially her hit single “Last Dance”, which she famously performed at Studio 54 with Bruce Sudano on September 25th, 1977.\n\nShe was known as “The Queen of Disco” because she helped make disco one of the most popular genres back then.\n\nDonna Summer was a black woman who had a successful career in the music industry.

She has sold over 130 million albums worldwide to date, with one of her most famous hits being “Hot Stuff.” Her life off stage is as fascinating as her music on stage.

Born in 1948 and raised on the South Side of Chicago, she dropped out of school at age 17 to pursue a career as a singer.

She is best known for her disco songs “Last Dance,” “Bad Girls” and the theme song from the movie “Scarface.” She started singing at an early age and eventually found her way to the world of disco music.\n\nShe died on May 17th, 2012.\n\nWho was the producer that led to Donna Summer’s first big hit “Love to Love You Baby?”\n\n“What role did George Moroder play in Donna Summer’s success?”\n\nThis question has long been debated and the answer is often disputed. Some say he was her manager, some say he was her producer, but who do we believe?\n\nDonna Summer had a long and successful career in the music industry, but she didn’t start out with her own hit songs. In fact, it took some time before she was able to break into the mainstream. In 1975, Donna got her first big break when producer Giorgio Moroder recruited her for his disco-influenced project called Love To Love You Baby.\n\nThe record label was reluctant to let radio stations play this song because it was so sensual but eventually it was released and went on to become one of Donna’s most famous hits and is still played today on the radio, at parties, and in clubs around the world!\n\nWho is the Queen of disco music?\n\nThe Queen of Disco Music is Donna Summer. She was born in 1948 and died on May 17, 2012, at the age of 63. She had a long career as an American singer who became one of the most successful female recording artists from 1974 to 2008.\n\nHer songs have become classics that are still popular today such as “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “She Works Hard for the Money” and many more! Her first big hit was “Love to Love You Baby” which was recorded at the beginning of the summer in 1975 but it wasn’t released until toward the end of the summer because producers were concerned about how it would be received. It had such a sexy sound, some thought it might receive criticism for being too risque.\n\nMs. Summer was very religious and also concerned about how it would affect her reputation. However, it was played at discotheques like Leviticus and Justine’s in New York City and received such a positive response that producers felt confident in releasing it to the radio stations. It put Ms. Summer on the map and paved the way for a string of major disco hit that established her as the Queen of Disco.\n\nSource\n\nWhat did Donna Summer sing?\n\nDonna Summer was a black female singer who had many hits in the 1970s and 1980s. What did Donna Summer sing? Some of Donna Summer songs are “Hot Stuff”, “Bad Girls” and “Last Dance”. Her voice was often called soulful, powerful, and sexual.

She had 31 top ten singles, including six number ones, with 18 consecutive Top 10 U.S. hits from 1975 to 1983.\n\nIf you grew up in the ’80s, then you know the song Hot Stuff. The disco era had some of the best songs and I love to dance. You probably associate Hot Stuff with Donna Summer but did you know that she didn’t write it? It was actually written by a man named Bruce Forest.\n\nWho wrote the song “Hot Stuff?”\n\nThe answer to this question may surprise you. The legendary Donna Summer didn’t write it! She was just singing someone else’s tune. In fact, she sang many other people’s songs and had a lot of hits in her day.\n\nIt was written by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte for her second album “Once Upon A Time.” They were trying to come up with an English language equivalent of their hit in Germany called “Der Kleine Franz” or “Little Frankie.”\n\nWho sang the song I Feel Love?\n\nWho knew that a song about love could be so controversial? The disco hit “I Feel Love” was released in 1977, and the lyrics were written by Donna Summer. Even though she wrote them, people still credit Giorgio Moroder because he produced the track at his studio. It’s also been debated whether or not Summer sang on this track or if it was somebody else.\n\nThe controversy is rooted in sexism and racism. Some believe that a black woman couldn’t have sung such an electronic dance song, while others think her vocals are too weak for it to have been her voice singing on the album version of “I Feel Love.” That’s cold love, but heaven knows it’s for real."
