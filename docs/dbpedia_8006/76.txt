Donna Summer Biography

LaDonna Adrian Gaines, better known as Donna Summer, was an American singer-songwriter. During the disco era of the 1970s, she rose to prominence and became known as the “Queen of Disco,” with her music gaining a global following.

LaDonna Adrian Gaines was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 31, 1948. Summer made her performance debut at church when she was 10 years old, filling in for a vocalist who was unable to present.

Summer, influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s, became the lead vocalist of the psychedelic rock band Crow and relocated to New York City. She joined a German production of the musical Hair in Munich in 1968, where she lived for several years while acting and singing. There, she met music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, with whom she went on to record significant disco singles including “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love,” launching Summer into international music markets. Summer returned to the United States in 1976, and additional singles followed, including “Last Dance,” her version of “MacArthur Park,” “Heaven Knows,” “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “Dim All the Lights,” “No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),” and “On the Radio.”

Summer had 32 chart singles on the Billboard Hot 100 in her career, including 14 top ten hits and four number one hits. Between 1976 and 1984, she had a top-40 hit every year, and from her first top-ten hit in 1976 until the end of 1982, she had 12 top-ten hits (10 of which were top-five hits), more than any other act during that time period. She returned to the top five of the Hot 100 in 1983, and her final top-ten hit, “This Time I Know It’s for Real,” came in 1989. She was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums debut at the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, and she scored four number-one singles in the country in a 12-month period. She also had two number-one hits in the United States on the R&amp;B Singles chart and one in the United Kingdom. Her most recent Hot 100 hit was “I Will Go with You (Con te Partir)” in 1999. Summer’s fortunes on the Hot 100 dwindled throughout the years, but she remained a force on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart throughout her career.

Summer died of lung cancer on May 17, 2012, at her home in Naples, Florida. She sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the most successful musicians of all time. She received five Grammy Awards. Her obituary in The Times characterised her as the “undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom” and “one of the world’s greatest female singers.”

Summer’s work on the song “I Feel Love” was characterised by Moroder as “truly the commencement of electronic dance” music. Summer was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Billboard rated her sixth on its list of the “Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists” in December 2016.

She became a cultural phenomenon, and her success on the dance charts, for which she was dubbed the “Queen of Disco,” established her as not just one of the defining voices of the era, but also an influence on pop artists ranging from Madonna to Beyoncé.

Summer, unlike several other disco performers who faded as the music became less popular in the early 1980s, was able to expand beyond the genre and transition to a pop-rock style. In the 1980s, she scored one of her biggest hits with “She Works Hard For the Money,” which became another anthem, this time for women’s rights.
