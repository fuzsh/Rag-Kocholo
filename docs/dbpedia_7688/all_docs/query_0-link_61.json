Objective: To evaluate cardiovascular risk factors and analyze the lifestyle of students finishing the first year of studies at selected universities in Krakow. The study was performed in 2015roku. 566 students finishing the first year of study, including 319 (56.4%) men and 247 (43.6%) women were examined. The students were in age from 18 to 27 years, an average of 20.11Â± 1.15 years. They represented 6 different universities in Cracow. In order to assess eating habits, lifestyle and analysis of risk factors of cardiovascular disease was used method of diagnostic survey using the survey technique. BMI was calculated from anthropometric measurements. The program Statistica 12.0 were used in statistical analysis. The analysis showed that most fruits and vegetables consume UR students and AWF, least of AGH. Only 34.8% of students regularly consume fish of the sea, there were no significant differences between universities. Sports frequently cultivate the students of AWF (93% of the students of this university). Academy of Fine Arts students drink the most coffee. Students of AGH frequently consume alcohol. 60% of all students never tried drugs, but only 25.7% of student of Fine Arts never tried drugs. Overweight occurs in 12.6% of students, and obesity in 1.1%. The most risk factors of atherosclerosis occur in students of AGH and ASP. The results of the study clearly indicate on the necessity of implementation of prevention and improvement of health behaviors in students of AGH and ASP universities.\n\nKrakow conference on low emissions sources: Proceedings\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPierce, B.L.; Butcher, T.A. [eds.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThe Krakow Conference on Low Emission Sources presented the information produced and analytical tools developed in the first phase of the Krakow Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Program. This phase included: field testing to provide quantitative data on missions and efficiencies as well as on opportunities for building energy conservation; engineering analysis to determine the costs of implementing pollution control; and incentives analysis to identify actions required to create a market for equipment, fuels, and services needed to reduce pollution. Collectively, these Proceedings contain reports that summarize the above phase one information, present the status of energy system management in Krakow, provide information on financing pollution control projects in Krakow and elsewhere, and highlight the capabilities and technologies of Polish and American companies that are working to reduce pollution from low emission sources. It is intended that the US reader will find in these Proceedings useful results and plans for control of pollution from low emission sources that are representative of heating systems in central and Eastern Europe. Selected papers are indexed separately for inclusion in the Energy Science and Technology Database.\n\nPARTICULATE EMISSION ABATEMENT FOR KRAKOW BOILERHOUSES\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBruce H.

The objective of this program was the formation of business ventures between U.S. and Polish firms to provide equipment and services to reduce air emissions in the city of Krakow. A cooperative agreement was entered into by DOE and LSR to begin work in April 1994 involving implementation of particulate control technology called a Core Separator{trademark} for coal-fueled boilerhouses in the city. The major work tasks included: (1) conducting a market analysis, (2) completion of a formal marketing plan, (3) obtaining patent protection within Poland, (4) selecting a manufacturing partner, and (5) completing a demonstration unit and commercial installations. In addition to work performed by LSR Technologies, key contributors to this project were (1) the Polish Foundation for Energy Efficiency (FEWE), a non-profit consulting organization specializing in energy and environmental-related technologies, and (2) EcoInstal, a privately held Polish company serving the air pollution control market. As the project concluded in late 1998, five (5) Core Separator{trademark} installations had been implemented in the city of Krakow, while about 40 others were completed in other regions of Poland.\n\nBulletin of Materials Science | Indian Academy of Sciences\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nAGH-University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Materials Science and Ceramics, Department of Biomaterials, Al.

This project focuses on such a strategy. In order to reduce dust emissions from coal-fueled boilers, a new device called a Core Separator has been introduced in several boiler house applications. This advanced technology has been successfully demonstrated in Poland and several commercial units are now in operation. Particulate emissions from the Core Separator are typically 3 to 5 times lower than those from the best cyclone collectors. It can easily meet the new standard for dust emissions which will be in effect in Poland after 1997. The Core Separator is a completely inertial collector and is based on a unique recirculation method. It can effectively remove dust particles below 10 microns in diameter, the so-called PM-10 emissions. Its performance approaches that of fabric filters, but without the attendant cost and maintenance. It is well-suited to the industrial size boilers located in Krakow. Core Separators are now being marketed and sold by EcoInstal, one of the leading environmental firms in Poland, through a cooperative agreement with LSR Technologies.\n\nReclamation of alkaline spent moulding sands of organic and inorganic type and their mixtures\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nR. DaÅko\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction of modern moulding sands with organic and inorganic binders requires the reclamation treatments in order to be able to reuse the matrices of spent sands. The spent sands, depending on the applied binding agent, are characterised by various abilities of the matrix reclamation. The results of investigations of the reclamation of spent moulding sands with the Rudal binder and spent sands with the Rezolit binder in the system of uniform sands and of mixed ones, are presented in the paper. Investigations were performed by means of the special experimental stands designed and built in the AGH University of Science and Technology, AGH, in Krakow.\n\nThe selection of the American-Polish joint venture projects for the Krakow program and results of the efforts to date\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGyorke, D.F.; Butcher, T.A.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nTo implement the Krakow Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Program, eight U.S. firms were selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to market their technologies to reduce pollution from low emission sources in Krakow. The eight U.S. firms were selected by a competitive solicitation that required the proposing firms to themselves provide funding to match or exceed the funding provided by the Program. These U.S. firms and their Polish partner companies have begun sales and cooperative work efforts in Krakow, and some have already made initial equipment installations with measurable performance improvements. Following their efforts as part of the Program, these U.S.-Polish joint ventures will market their technologies and achieve the associated environmental benefits elsewhere in Poland and Eastern and Central Europe. As part of the Krakow Program a spreadsheet model was developed to compare technological options for supplying heat to the city by calculation and comparing the heating costs and associated emissions reduction for each option. Comparison of options is made on the basis of the user cost-per-metric ton of equivalent emissions reduction. For all options considered in the Krakow Program, this cost parameter has ranged from -$1469 (best) to $2650 (worst). The costs for technologies associated with the eight projects in the Krakow Program are at the lower end of this range placing these technologies among the most cost effective solutions to the pollution problems from the low emission sources.\n\nPerspectives of co-operation with the World Bank towards elimination of low emission sources in Krakow\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGoerlich, K.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nI am not going to speak about or for the World Bank. More time and a different scope of the conference would be needed in order to more deeply assess the role of the World Bank and other international lenders and donors in the environmental and energy sectors in Poland. I am going to stay within the context of the Krakow Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Project financed by the US AID and managed by the US DOE (called here for simplicity the Krakow Programme). However, in order to assess a role of the World Bank and other international lenders and donors in the pro-environment transformation of the energy systems of Krakow, one needs to briefly discuss: the possibilities and confinements related to the {open_quotes}technology{close_quotes} of disbursement of the financial resources by the multilateral development banks (MDB`s) in Poland, the type of results obtained within the {open_quotes}Krakow Programme{close_quotes} and a concept of involving American commercial companies to implement the clean-air policy for Krakow.\n\nKrakow clean fossil fuels and energy efficiency project\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nButcher, T.A.; Pierce, B.L. [Brookhaven National Lab., Upton, NY (United States)\n\n1995-11-01\n\nThe Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 directed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to undertake an equipment assessment project aimed at developing the capability within Poland to manufacture or modify industrial-scale combustion equipment to utilize fossil fuels cleanly. This project is being implemented in the city of Krakow as the `Krakow Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Project.` Funding is provided through the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). The project is being conducted in a manner that can be generalized to all of Poland and to the rest of Eastern Europe. The historic city of Krakow has a population of 750,000. Almost half of the heating energy used in Krakow is supplied by low-efficiency boilerhouses and home coal stoves. Within the town, there are more than 1,300 local boilerhouses and 100,000 home stoves. These are collectively referred to as the `low emission sources` and they are the primary sources of particulates and hydrocarbon emissions in the city and major contributors of sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide.\n\nAnalysis of Heavy Metals in Surface Sediments from Agh Gel Wetland, Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSoheil Sobhanardakani\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Soil and sediment serve as major reservoir for contaminants as they possess ability to bind various chemicals together. In this study the concentrations of heavy metals Cd, Cr and Cu were analyzed in surface sediments of Agh Gel Wetland in west of Iran. Methods: The sediment samples were taken from 10 stations. The samples were subjected to bulk digestion and chemical partitioning and Cd, Cr and Cu concentrations of the sediments were determined by ICP-OES. Geo-accumulation index (I-geo, Contamination factor (CF and Pollution load index (PLI were used to evaluate the magnitude of contaminants in the sediment profile. Results: The mean sediment concentrations (mg kg-1 dry weight ranged within 0.20-0.29 (Cd, 58-71 (Cr and 23-36 (Cu. According to the I-geo values, the sediments' qualities are classified as unpolluted to moderately polluted category. According to the CF values, the sediments' qualities are classified as low to moderate contamination. Furthermore, the PLI values indicated that there were no metal pollution exists for all sampling stations. Conclusion: The Agh Gel Wetland is potential to be threatened by chemical pollutants such as agricultural effluent. So to preserve the environment of the Agh Gel Wetland from deterioration, periodically monitoring of the water and sediment qualities is recommended.\n\nKrakow clean fossil fuels and energy efficiency program. Phase 1 report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nButcher, T.; Pierce, B. [eds.\n\n1995-06-01\n\nKrakow is one of the largest and oldest cities in Poland. It is situated in the south of the country on the banks of the Vistula River. From the 11th until the 17th centuries, it was the capital of Poland. Today, Krakow is a city of 750,000 residents, one of the largest centers of higher education, an important industrial center, and is of particular importance because of the number and kinds of historic buildings and sites. For this reason, Krakow was included by the UNESCO in the list of the world`s cultural heritages. For about three decades, significant air pollution has been one of Krakow`s most serious problems. Because the city is situated in the Vistula River valley, it is poorly ventilated and experiences a high concentration of air pollutants. The quality of air in Krakow is affected mainly by industry (Sendzimir Steelworks, energy industry, chemical plants), influx from the Silesian industrial region (power plants, metallurgy), transboundary pollution (Ostrava - Czech Republic), and local sources of low pollution, i.e. more than 1,000 boiler houses using solid fuels and more than 100,000 coal-fired home stoves. These local sources, with low stacks and almost no pollution-control equipment, are responsible for about 35-40% of the air pollution. This report presents phase I results of a program to reduce pollution in krakow. Phase I was to gather information on emissions and costs, and to verify assumptions on existing heating methods and alternatives.\n\nInfluence of the meteorological parameters on CFCs and SF6 concentration in the air of Krakow, Poland\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBielewski, JarosÅaw; Najman, Joanna; Åliwka, Ireneusz; Bartyzel, Jakub; Rosiek, Janusz\n\n2013-04-01\n\nauthors wish to acknowledge Prof. R.

The target of this cleanup is the Polish coal industry, which supplies the fuel to generate over 78% of Poland's primary energy production. This project addresses the problem of airborne dust and uncontrolled particulate emissions from boilerhouses, which represent a large fraction of the total in Poland. In Krakow alone, there are more than 2,000 uncontrolled boilers accounting for about half the total fuel use. The large number of low-capacity boilers poses both technical and economic challenges, since the cost of control equipment is a significant factor in the reduction of emissions. A new concept in dust collection, called a Core Separator, is proposed for this important application. The Core Separator is an advanced technology developed through research sponsored by the Department of Energy. It utilizes a highly efficient collector, which functions on the principle of inertial separation. The system is able to control fine particulate matter, as in the PMIO regulations, which limit the emission of dust particles below 10 microns in diameter. Its dust removal performance has been shown to be comparable to that of a medium-efficiency electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Yet, its cost is substantially lower than that of either an ESP or fabric filter. While the Core Separator achieves high efficiency, its power consumption is just slightly higher than that of a cyclone. It functions dry and without the aid of energy-consuming enhancements. It is simple, reliable, and unlike the ESP and fabric filter, easy to maintain. This combination of features make it ideal for the small boiler market in the City of Krakow. A highly qualified team has been assembled to execute this project. LSR Technologies, Inc., a technology-based company located in Acton, Massachusetts, is the developer of the Core Separator and holder of its patent rights.

Since the introduction by Prof. Bojarski of EMPA over 45 years ago, tremendous advances in methodologies and in instrumentation have been made in order to improve the precision of quantitative compositional analysis, spatial resolution and analytical sensitivity. This was possible due to the activity of Applied Crystallography Committee at the Polish Academy of Sciences, as well as the groups of researches working in the Institute for Ferrous Metallurgy (Gliwice), the Technical University of Warsaw, the Silesian Technical University (Katowice), the AGH-University of Sciences and Technology (Krakow), and the Institute of Materials Science and Metallurgy Polish Academy of Sciences (Krakow). Based on the research examples realized by these teams, conferences, seminars and congresses organized, as well as books and academic textbooks issued, the evolution of electron beam X-ray microanalysis in Poland is demonstrated.\n\nNickel, Lead and Zinc Contamination in the Surface Sediments of Agh Gel Wetland, Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSoheil Sobhan Ardakani\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Background & Aims of the Study: Due to the increased human activities around the Agh Gel wetland, this study aimed to measured accumulations of heavy metals (Ni, Pb and Zn in the surface sediment samples taken from this wetland. Materials & Methods: Samples were taken from 10 stations and exposed to bulk digestion and chemical partitioning. Finally, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations were monitored with ICP-OES in the sediments. Also, geo-accumulation index, contamination factor and pollution load index were used to evaluate the magnitude of contaminants in the sediment profile. Results: The results showed, the average of metal concentration in samples (mg kg-1 wet weight were 34.20Â±3.58 for Ni, 25.37Â±2.52 for Pb and 127.20Â±15.21 for Zn, respectively. Therefore, the pattern of metal concentrations in sediment was determined as Zinc>Nickel >Lead. According to the mean I-geo values, sediments' qualities are classified as unpolluted category for Ni and Pb. Also, sediment's quality is classified as unpolluted to moderately polluted for Zn. The CF values for all elements are classified as moderate contamination. The PLI values indicated that metal pollution exists for all sampling stations. Conclusions: The obtained results indicated that the Agh Gel wetland has a potential to threaten by chemical pollutants such as agricultural effluent. So, in order to preserve the environment of the Agh Gel wetland from deterioration, monitoring of water and sediment qualities is recommended periodically.\n\n24 February 2012 - Polish Vice-Rectors AGH University of Science and Technology Cracow visiting the ATLAS underground experimental area with Former Collaboration Spokesperson P.

Mineralization include polymetallic (Cu-Pb-Zn-Au-Ag quartz veins and silicified zones, which occurred as breccia and vein- veinlets with comb, cockade and disseminated textures. Chalcopyrite, pyrite, galena and sphalerite are common ore minerals. Alteration zones consist of silicification, sericitization, argillitic, propelitic and carbonatization. Cu-Au mineralization is associated with silicification and sericitization. Analytical results of the samples from the ore- bearing quartz veins and the silicified zones indicate that the highest grade for Au is 664 ppb (ave.181 ppb. The highest and the average grades for Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn are 120 ppm (300 ppm, 1.3 % (0.38 %, 5.5 % (0.06 % and 4.5 % (0.28 %, respectively. The investigations indicate that the Agh-Otagh mineralization was formed in four stages. In the first stage or the pre-mineralization stage, the host rock, as a result of hydrothermal process, underwent brecciation and some quartz veins and siliceous cap were formed. In the second stage or the mineralization stage the sulfide minerals formed within the quartz veins and silicification zones developed at the third stage, some unmineralized quartz, barite and carbonate vein- veinlets crosscut the previous stages. The last stage of mineralization related to supergene processes. Based on geological, mineralogical, alteration, structural and textural evidences, the Agh-Otagh base- precious metal mineralization is similar to the medium sulfidation epithermal deposits.\n\nUtilisation of Products of the Thermal Reclamation of Post Reclamation Dusts in the Production Technology of Ceramic Building Materials\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHoltzer M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The problem related to the management of post reclamation dusts generated in the reclamation process of waste moulding sands with organic binders is presented in the hereby paper.

The PM10 samples were collected during the winter time study. The highest concentrations of carbonaceous species were observed in Skawina (36.9 Î¼gÂ·m-3 of OC and 9.6 Î¼gÂ·m-3 of EC. The lowest OC and EC concentrations were reported in Krakow (15.2 Î¼gÂ·m-3 and 3.9 Î¼gÂ·m-3, respectively. The highest concentration of carbonaceous species and the highest wind velocities in Skawina influenced the highest values of the dry deposition fluxes. Correlations between OC, EC and chemical constituents and meteorological parameters suggest that a Krakow was influenced by local emission sources and temperature inversion occurrence; b Bialka was under the influence of local emission sources and long-range transport of particles; c Skawina was impacted by local emission sources.\n\nAminoguanidine hydrazones (AGH's) as modulators of norfloxacin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus that overexpress NorA efflux pump.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDantas, Natalina; de Aquino, Thiago MendonÃ§a; de AraÃºjo-JÃºnior, JoÃ£o Xavier; da Silva-JÃºnior, Edeildo; Gomes, Ednaldo Almeida; Gomes, Antoniel Augusto Severo; Siqueira-JÃºnior, JosÃ© Pinto; MendonÃ§a Junior, Francisco Jaime Bezerra\n\n2018-01-25\n\nOne of the promising fields for improving the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents is their combination with efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), which besides expanding the use of existing antibiotics. The goal of this research was to evaluate a series of aminoguanidine hydrazones (AGH's, 1-19) as antibacterial agents and NorA efflux pump inhibitors in Staphylococcus aureus strain SA-1199B. Molecular modeling and docking studies were also performed in order to explain at the molecular level the interactions of the compounds with the generated NorA efflux pump model. The MICs of the antibiotic and ethidium bromide were determined by microdilution assay in absence or presence of a subinhibitory concentration of aminoguanidine hydrazones and macrophages viability was determined through MTT assay. Bioinformatic software Swiss-Model and AutoDock 4.2 were used to perform modeling and docking studies, respectively. As results, all AGH's were able to potentiate the action for the antibiotic norfloxacin, causing MIC's reduction of 16-fold and 32-fold to ethidium bromide. In the cell viability test, the concentration of 10Â Î¼g/mL showed better results than 90% and the concentration of 1000Â Î¼g/mL showed the lowest viability, reaching a maximum of 50% for the analyzed aminoguanidine hydrazones. Molecular docking studies showed that both norfloxacin and derivative 13 were recognized by the same binding site of NorA pump, suggesting a competitive mechanism. The present work demonstrated for the first time that AGH derivatives have potential to be putative inhibitors of NorA efflux pump, showing a promising activity as an antibacterial drug development.

In particular, the low emission sources program has had major successes. Poland and America have a lot to learn from each other in the clean and economical use of coal. Both our countries are major producers and users of coal. Both have had to deal with the emissions of particulate and organics from coal combustion. We were fortunate, since our free market economy and democratic government helped us deal with a lot of these problems in the 1950s. In Poland, the freedom to solve these problems has evolved only in the last few years. In the first phase of the program, Polish and American engineers ran combustion tests on boilers and stoves in Krakow. They also performed analyses on the cost and feasibility of various equipment changes. The results of the first phase were used in refining the spreadsheet model to give better estimates of costs emissions. The first phase also included analyses of incentives for proceeding with needed changes. These analyses identified actions needed to create a market for the goods and services which control pollution. Such actions could include privatization, regulation, or financial incentives. The second phase of the program consisted of public meetings in Chicago, Washington, and Krakow. The purpose of the meetings was to inform U.S. and Polish firms about the results of phase 1 and to encourage them to compete to take part in phase 3. The third phase currently underway consists of the commercial ventures that were competitively selected. These ventures were consistent with recommendations unanimously made by the BSC. The three phases of the Polish-American program are discussed.\n\nA Discovered Ducal Seal Does Not Belong to the Incorporation Charter for the City of Krakow Solving the Mystery Using Genetic Methods\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLech, Tomasz\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Incorporation Charter for the city of Krakow, the former capital of Poland, is one of the most valuable documents stored in the National Archives in Krakow.

The objective of this study was to assess the degree of environmental effect of the secondary solid waste generated during the incineration process of medical waste. The analysis of pollution of the air emissions and leaching test of ashes and slag were carried out. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that (i) the hospital waste incineration plant significantly solves the problems of medical waste treatment in Krakow; (ii) the detected contaminant concentrations were generally lower than the permissible values; (iii) the generated ashes and slag contained considerable concentrations of heavy metals, mainly zinc, and chloride and sulfate anions. Ashes and slag constituted 10-15% of the mass of incinerated wastes; they are more harmful for the environment when compared with untreated waste, and after solidification they can be deposited in the hazardous waste disposal.\n\nThe Agh Band loess-palaeosol sequence in Northern Iran - a detailed archive for climate and environmental change during the last and penultimate glacial - interglacial cycles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLauer, Tobias; Frechen, Manfred; Vlaminck, Stefan; Kehl, Martin; Sharifi, Jafar; Rolf, Christian; Khormali, Farhad\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe northern Iranian loess profiles host important information on quaternary climate and palaeoenvironmental changes in the region. Furthermore, they build an important link to correlate European and Central Asian archives. Due to a significant climatic gradient with decreasing precipitation from the west to the east and from the south to the north, loess-palaeosol sequences which were formed synchronously under different climatic conditions can be studied. The Agh Band profile is located in the so called Iranian \"Loess Plateau\", a semi-arid region with about 300 mm annual precipitation. The loess deposits reach a thickness of > 60 meters and are subdivided by several weak soil horizons in the more upper part and by a pedo-complex of 3 Bw(y) horizons in the lower part of the loess. The Agh Band profile was sampled in 2 cm intervals for multi-proxy analyses (e.g. magnetic susceptibility and grain size measurements). Furthermore, samples for palaeomangentic studies and luminescence dating were collected and a pIRIR290 approach was applied to fine-grain polyminerals. The results show that the Agh Band profile yields a climate archive reaching from MIS 7 to MIS 2. Several chronological hiatuses of some 10 ka show that periods of intense loess accumulation were interrupted by phases of only minor loess sedimentation and/or erosion. The Agh Band profile hosts an extraordinary good temporal resolution for MIS 4 and MIS 5. The pedocomplex at the bottom part of the profile indicates a period of increased humidity and landscape stability during late MIS 7 and MIS 6 following the luminescence ages. The loess-profile is also subdivided by several shifts in grain-size distribution. The coarsening- and fining up trends correlate with increasing and decreasing wind- velocity, respectively.\n\nAwards aplenty in Krakow\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCERN will be well represented this year at the award ceremony organized by the European Physical Society (EPS) in Krakow.

Cogeneration facilities were added in the mid-1970s to supply up to 40% of the regional peak electrical demand and to optimize energy extraction from the low-heating-value coal mined in the region. Several difficulties prevent the district from realizing the potential efficiencies of its technology: the poor condition of the distribution network, the lack of consumption control and metering devices, inadequate plant maintenance, and the lack of economic incentives for operator productivity and energy conservation by users. Environmental concerns have caused the local government and international agencies to plan major improvements to the system. This paper discusses the development of the district heating system, coal use in Poland, cogeneration facilities, environmental concerns and pollution control plans, and improvement strategies\n\nProgram of low emissions elimination and power recovery by the Krakow heat and power plant for the city of Krakow and its residents\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDrezewski, J.; Kasprzyk, T. [Krakow Heat and Power Plant, Cracow (Poland)\n\n1995-12-31\n\nFor over three years the Krakow Heat and Power Plant S.A. (ECK SA) has been implementing its strategy of adapting to operation and growth in the market economy. The accomplishment and results of these efforts are presented. The social and economic conditions prevailing during the transformation from a centrally controlled economy to a market economy have changed the realities and regulations that restricted the availability of energy carriers. The continual shortages and restrictions on supplies of gas, electricity, heat and even solids fuels (coke) that occurred in previous years have been replaced by a surplus. That is why many investment planning decisions have had to be revised. A sharp increase in energy carrier prices has required detailed analyses and viability studies to be made before final investment decisions are made. The choice of fuel and heating methods has begun to be dictated by the market and the economy, and not by rationing and administrative decisions. Clearly, a free market in energy generation and distribution has come into existence in the Krakow urban area. In general, these trends will produce a situation in which the fixed cost (depreciation, repairs, payroll) incurred by manufacturers and distributors will be apportioned among a smaller number of power units (MW), thus increasing the capacity price (fixed payment).\n\nThe Academy of Arts and Sciences in Krakow (1872â1918 and its Czech members (in Polish\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHalina LICHOCKA\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article shows that the Czech humanists formed the largest group among the foreign members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in Krakow. It is mainly based on the reports of the activities of the Academy. The Academy of Arts and Sciences in Krakow was established by transforming the Krakow Learned Society. The Statute of the newly founded Academy was approved by aÂ decision of the Emperor Franz Joseph IÂ on February 16, 1872. The Emperor nominated his brother Archduke Karl Ludwig as the Academyâs Protector. The Academy was assigned to take charge of research matters related to different fields of science: philology (mainly Polish and other Slavic languages; history of literature; history of art; philosophical; political and legal sciences; history and archaeology; mathematical sciences, life sciences, Earth sciences and medical sciences. In order to make it possible for the Academy to manage so many research topics, it was divided into three classes: aÂ philological class, aÂ historicoÂ­âphilosophical class, and aÂ class for mathematics and natural sciences. Each class was allowed to establish its own commissions dealing with different branches of science. The first members of the Academy were chosen from among the members of the Krakow Learned Society. It was aÂ 12Â­âperson group including only local members, approved by the Emperor. It was also them who elected the first President of the Academy, JÃ³zef Majer, and the Secretary General, JÃ³zef Szujski, from this group. By the end of 1872, the organization of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in Krakow was completed. It had its administration, management and three classes that were managed by the respective directors and secretaries. It also had three commissions, taken over from the Krakow Learned Society, namely: the Physiographic Commission, the Bibliographic Commission and the Linguistic Commission. At that time, the Academy had only aÂ total of 24 active members who had the right\n\nBishop Marcin Szyszkowski (1616â1630 as the creator of the Service of Seven Krakow Churches\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBartÅomiej MichaÅ WoÅyniec\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The religious tour of seven Roman basilicas described back in the 16th century by St Philip Neri is thought to have its roots in folk tradition, though undoubtedly was a product of recalling and adapting the memory of an old, ludic prayer tradition to the new circumstances. The itinerary described by the saint listed four major basilicas: St Peterâs Basilica in Vatican, St Paulâs Basilica Outside the Walls, Basilica of St John Lateran, Basilica of St Mary and three minor ones: Basilica of the Cross of Jerusalem, St Basilica of St Lawrence Outside the Walls, and St Sebastianâs Basilica. In 1621 the Krakow printing house of Franciszek Cezary issued a brochure entitled Siedm koÅcioÅÃ³w krakowskich. Its release was initiated by Marcin Szyszkowski, who had stayed in Rome for many years, where he acquainted himself with the work of St Philip Neri. The moment Szyszkowski became the Krakow bishop, he began to implement elements of post-Trent devotion of the Eternal City in his own diocese. One of such innovations was to initiate the Service of the Seven Krakow Churches, which was granted privileges and indulgences of the Roman pilgrimage trail.\n\nHealthcare's Future: Strategic Investment in Technology.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFranklin, Michael A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRecent and rapid advances in the implementation of technology have greatly affected the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery in the United States. Simultaneously, diverse generational pressures-including the consumerism of millennials and unsustainable growth in the costs of care for baby boomers-have accelerated a revolution in healthcare delivery that was marked in 2010 by the passage of the Affordable Care Act.Against this backdrop, Maryland and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services entered into a partnership in 2014 to modernize the Maryland All-Payer Model. Under this architecture, each Maryland hospital negotiates a global budget revenue agreement with the state's rate-setting agency, limiting the hospital's annual revenue to the budgetary cap established by the state.At Atlantic General Hospital (AGH), leaders had established a disciplined strategic planning process in which the board of trustees, medical staff, and administration annually agree on goals and initiatives to achieve the objectives set forth in its five-year strategic plans. This article describes two initiatives to improve care using technology. In 2006, AGH introduced a service guarantee in the emergency room (ER); the ER 30-Minute Promise assures patients that they will be placed in a bed or receive care within 30 minutes of arrival in the ER. In 2007, several independent hospitals in the state formed Maryland eCare to jointly contract for intensive care unit (ICU) physician coverage via telemedicine. This technology allows clinical staff to continuously monitor ICU patients remotely. The positive results of the ER 30-Minute Promise and Maryland eCare program show that technological advances in an independent, small, rural hospital can make a significant impact on its ability to maintain independence. AGH's strategic investments prepared the organization well for the transition in 2014 to a value-based payment system.\n\nApplication of Relaxed Eddy Accumulation (REA) method to estimate CO2 and CH4 surface fluxes in the city of Krakow, southern Poland.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZimnoch, Miroslaw; Gorczyca, Zbigniew; Pieniazek, Katarzyna; Jasek, Alina; Chmura, Lukasz; Rozanski, Kazimierz\n\n2013-04-01\n\nvertical wind component, the variability of the mean surface fluxes of CO2 and CH4 was quantified. In case of CO2 flux, a typical diurnal pattern with the maximum values of around 30 mmol m-2 h-1 occurring during night hours and the minimum values, around -40 mmol m-2 h-1, occurring early afternoon was observed during sunny days (\"plus\" and \"minus\" signs mark upward and downward fluxes, respectively). In addition, some events with much higher fluxes (up to 100 mmol m-2 h-1) were observed, mainly during rush hours. Temporal variability of methane flux turned out to be much higher than that observed for CO2. During summer, it varied from approximately -100 to +500 Î¼mol m-2 h-1, with the mean value of around +100 Î¼mol m-2 h-1 and maximum values occurring predominantly during daytime. In addition to flux measurements, an attempt was made to characterize also the isotopic signature of carbon in the CO2 flux components measured with the aid of REA method. The results showed that the precision of Î´13CO2 measurements performed with Picarro analyser was not sufficient to differentiate the isotopic signatures of upward and downward CO2 fluxes.

In the presented soil section lithological discontinuity (LD) was found, which manifests itself in the form of cultural layers (CLs). Moreover, in this paper LD detection methods based on soil texture are presented. For the first time, three different ways to identify the presence of LD in the urban soils are suggested. The presence of LD had an influence on the content and distribution of heavy metals within the soil profile. The content of heavy metals in the CLs under the MMS in Krakow was significantly higher than the content in natural horizons. In addition, there were distinct differences in the content of heavy metals within CLs. Profile variability and differences in the content of heavy metals and phosphorus within the CLs under the MMS were activity indicators of Krakow inhabitants in the past. This paper presents alternative methods for the assessment of the degree of heavy metal contamination in urban soils using selected pollution indices. On the basis of the studied total concentration of heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn, Cr, Cd, Ni, Sn, Ag) and total phosphorus content, the Geoaccumulation Index (I geo ), Enrichment Factor (EF), Sum of Pollution Index (PI sum ), Single Pollution Index (PI), Nemerow Pollution Index (PI Nemerow ) and Potential Ecological Risk (RI) were calculated using different local and reference geochemical backgrounds. The use of various geochemical backgrounds is helpful to evaluate the assessment of soil pollution. The individual CLs differed from each other according to the degree of pollution. The different values of pollution indices within the studied soil profile showed that LDS should not be evaluated in terms of contamination as one, homogeneous soil profile but each separate CL should be treated individually.

Final report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n1997-07-01\n\nProject aim was to reduce pollution levels in the City of Krakow through the retirement of coal-fired (hand and mechanically-stoked) boiler houses. This was achieved by identifying attractive candidates and connecting them to the Krakow district heating system, thus permitting them to eliminate boiler operations. Because coal is less costly than district hot water, the district heating company Miejskie Przedsiebiorstwo Energetyki Cieplnej S.A., henceforth identified as MPEC, needed to provide potential customers with incentives for purchasing district heat. These incentives consisted of offerings which MPEC made to the prospective client. The offerings presented the economic and environmental benefits to district heating tie-in and also could include conservation studies of the facilities, so that consumption of energy could be reduced and the cost impact on operations mitigated. Because some of the targeted boiler houses were large, the capacity of the district heating network required enhancement at strategic locations. Consequently, project construction work included both enhancement to the district piping network as well as facility tie-ins. The process of securing new customers necessitated the strengthening of MPEC`s competitive position in Krakow`s energy marketplace, which in turn required improvements in marketing, customer service, strategic planning, and project management. Learning how US utilities address these challenges became an integral segment of the project`s scope.\n\nTHE ROLE OF THE PRESS IN CREATING THE IMAGE OF GERMANS FOR THE STUDENTS OF UST AGH\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDorota Zuchowska-Skiba\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper focuses on the assessment of the influence of the mass media on arising and functioning in the students community of stereotypes concerning Germans. The research conducted among students of AGH led to the conclusion that stereotypical images that studentshave about Germany are shaped under the influence of mass media. The most influential in the process of shaping these images are the newspapers, which according to the researchees provide the most reliable information on this particular subject of all the media.This article presents the most characteristic images which the students have about Germans and the part played by the most often read newspapers in the process of creating and maintaining these images.\n\nUse of LIDAR Data in the 3D/4D Analyses of the Krakow Fortress Objects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGlowienka, Ewa; Michalowska, Krystyna; Opalinski, Piotr; Hejmanowska, Beata; Mikrut, Slawomir; Kramarczyk, Piotr\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe article presents partial results of studies within the framework of the international project \"Cultural Heritage Through Time\" (CHT2). The subject of the study were forts of the Krakow Fortress, which had been built by the Austrians between 1849-1914 in order to provide defence against the Russians. Research works were aimed at identifying architectural changes occurring in different time periods in relation to selected objects of the Krakow Fortress. For the analysis, the following LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data was applied: Digital Terrain Models (DTM), Digital Surface Model (DSM), as well as the cartographic data: maps and orthophotomaps. All spatial data was obtained from the Polish Main Office of Geodesy and Cartography (GÅÃ³wny UrzÄ d Geodezji i Kartografii - GUGIK). The majority of the cartographic data is available in the form of Web Map Services (WMS) on Geoportal (www.geoportal.gov.pl). The archival data was made available by the Historical Museum of the City of Krakow, or obtained from private collections. In order to conduct a thorough analysis of objects of the Krakow fortress, DTM and DSM data was obtained, either in ASCII format, or in the source *.las (LIDAR) format. On the basis of DTM and DSM, the degree of destruction of selected fortress objects was determined, occurring as a result of the action of demolishing those objects in the interwar period (1920-1939) and in the 1950s. The research has been made on the basis of all available cartographic materials, both archival (plans, maps, photos) and current (topographic map, orthophotomap, etc.) ones. Verification of archival maps and plans was carried out by comparing current digital images of the existing forms of fortifications with designs developed by the Austrians. As a result, it was possible to identify the differences between the original design, and the current state of the objects concerned. The analyses, which have been conducted, also allowed checking the legitimacy of\n\nAnalysis of Disposal of Public Property without Tender Procedure on the Example of the Municipality of Krakow\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTrembecka Anna\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of this study is to analyze the procedure for the disposal of public property without tender on the example of the Municipality of Krakow, with respect to the scope, purpose, conditions of disposal and generated income, in the period of 2012â2014.\n\nA new Krakow scanning nuclear microprobe performance tests and early application experienc\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLebed, S; Polak, W; Potempa, A W; Stachura, Z; Paszkowski, M\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA new scanning nuclear microprobe (MP) with a short-length probe forming system was designed,installed and tested at the 3MV Van de Graaff accelerator in Krakow.The MP resolution of 3.3 mu m was reached for 2.4 MeV proton beam in the high-current mode (>= 100pA).The MP facility provides a local,non-destructive,quantitative elemental microanalysis using a Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) technique.As example of possible application an analysis of a geological sample containing monazite crystals investigated by PIXE method is presented.\n\nAssessment of the frequency of snack and beverages consumption and stimulants intake in children grown up in orphanages in Krakow.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPysz, Katarzyna; LeszczyÅska, Teresa; KopeÄ, Aneta\n\n2015-01-01\n\nChildhood is a particular period of life, when nutritional habits are emerging, so much attention should be paid to proper dietary habits, which become a nutritional pattern copied in the future. The aim of this study was to evaluate selected dietary habits and preferences in a group of children living in Krakow orphanages (supervising by the Social Welfare Centre in Krakow), by assessing the frequency of snacks and beverages consumptions as well as an intake of beverages with caffeine, alcohol and smoking cigarettes. Studies were performed in the years 2007-2008 in five orphanages located in Krakow. 181 children, 9 to 20 yrs of age, participated in this study. Assessment of dietary habits and preferences was performed based on anonymous questionnaire which included questions about snacking frequency, favorite and most frequently drank beverages without or with caffeine, alcohol and cigarettes smoking. The analysis of nutritional habits showed that the most popular high-calorie snacks were eaten by the youngest children. Children and adolescents asked for the most commonly consumed beverages indicated on fizzy drinks and fruits juice. Among the youngest children (9-12 years old), 5% reported drinking alcohol, 10% of boys smoked cigarettes, 10% of girls and 21% of boys drank coffee. Among the oldest respondents, about 35% declared drinking coffee, 39% girls and 65% boys declared smoking cigarettes, whereas drinking alcohol reported 22 and 38% subjects, respectively. Results obtained in this study, indicate the necessity of intervention, consisting on running training courses and workshops of the assessed population, i.e. children, adolescents and instructing their educators.\n\nInternal friction and ultrasonic attenuation in solids, including high Tc superconductors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMagalas, L.B.; Gorczyca, S.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis volume contains seven invited papers and about eighty refereed contributions from the main sessions of the Sixth European Conference on Internal Friction and Ultrasonic Attenuation in Solids (ECIFUAS-6) held at the Academy of Mining and Metallurgy (Akademia Gorniczo-Hutnicza, AGH) in Krakow, Poland, 5-7 September, 1991.

The document, which was written in 1257 on parchment, grants Krakow the Magdeburg rights and regulates its legal, statutory, economic and settlement-related aspects. The Charter was placed in the National Register of the Memory of the World UNESCO programme in 2014. A ducal seal, considered to be the lost seal detached from the Incorporation Charter, was found in the sphragistic collection after nearly 500 years. Unfortunately, it was uncertain whether the seal in question was indeed the missing part of the document. The aim of the study presented below was to solve this mystery. For this purpose, the parchment on which the Incorporation Charter was written was compared with the fragment of the parchment attached to the discovered seal. The study involved the analysis of selected mitochondrial DNA sequences and additional analysis at the level of nuclear DNA using microsatellite markers in the form of 11 STR (Short Tandem Repeat) loci, to identify the species and individual whose skin had been used to make the parchment. This analysis revealed that seal and parchment was from different individuals and thereby discovered that the seal was never a part of the Incorporation Charter. The study is further an example of informative DNA preservation in cultural heritage objects.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of soils in Krakow, southern Poland\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWojas, Anna\n\n2017-06-01\n\nStudies into the magnetic susceptibility have been used to assess the soils contamination in the Krakow area. The results of topsoil (over a 2 Ã 2 km grid), subsoil (37 shallow holes) and soil samples (112) measurements were presented as maps of soil magnetic susceptibility (both volume and mass) illustrating the distribution of parameters in topsoil horizon (0-10 cm) and differential magnetic susceptibility maps between topsoil horizon and subsoil (40-60 cm). All evidence leads to the finding that the highest values of magnetic susceptibility of soil are found exclusively in industrial areas. Taking into consideration the type of land use, the high median value (89.8 Ã 10-8 m3kg-1) was obtained for samples of cultivated soils and is likely to be connected with occurrence of fertile soil (chernozem). Moreover, enrichment of soils with Pb and Zn accompanies magnetic susceptibility anomalies in the vicinity of the high roads and in the steelworks area, respectively.\n\nExperimental and numerical studies of rotating drum grate furnace\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBasista Grzegorz\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Waste material from the meat industry can be taken into account as a biofuel. Studies confirm, that calorific value is higher and ash content is lower comparing to some conventional fuels. EU directives regulate details of thermal disposal of the waste material from the meat industry - especially in range of the process temperature and time of the particle presence in area of the combustion zone. The paper describes design of the rotating drum grate stove, dedicated to thermal disposal of the meat wastes as well as solid biomass (pellet, small bricket, wood chips combustion. Device has been developed in frames of cooperation between AGH University of Science and Technology (Krakow, Poland and producer focused on technologies of energy utilization of biomass in distributed generation. Results of measurements of selected operational parameters performed during startup of the furnace have been presented and discussed. Furthermore, numerical model of the combustion process has been developed to complement experimental results in range of the temperature and oxygen distribution in the area of the combustion chamber. ANSYS CFX solver has been applied to perform simulations including rotational domain related with specifics of operation of the device. Results of numerical modelling and experimental studies have been summarized and compared.\n\nTHE INVENTORY OF DATABASES ON THE LAND REGISTRATION FOR THE ECOLOGICAL SITES IN KRAKOW\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMonika Mika\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents the results of the inventory of databases for the registration of data on the ecological sites. The area of research concerns the administrative borders of the Krakow city. The research materials ware obtained on the basis of analyzes of existing databases recording ecological sites, which constitute the basis of a district database Register of Land and Buildings (EGiB and database District Water Management Board (Regional Board in Krakow city, responsible for the Water Cadastre. The compatibility of the achieved data were compared with the data of the Municipal Information System (MSIP, and the Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection (RDOÅ, and then performed a descriptive specification for all (registered till April 2016, 12 of ecological sites. In the first stage the analysis of the detailed data in the databases of the ecological water cadastre and EGiB was performed then in other databases of descriptive and spatial available for the research area. In the research part of the paper the authors carried out the inventory of the selected object in the studies area and the documentation descriptive and graphical natural curiosities was created. The main aim of this study was to draw attention to natural and tourism potential which is for the big city in an ecological site and obtaining the data to develop the concept of an interactive thematic map natural curiosities, using integrated techniques of surveying GPS and GIS. Such a map will be the next stage of research and is not the subject of this paper.\n\nElectron Technology: ELTE 2016\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPisarkiewicz, Tadeusz; Kucewicz, Wojciech\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn this paper we present a review of research results and technical accomplishments presented by researchers from technical universities, governmental institutes and research companies during the XIIth Scientific Conference Electron Technology, ELTE 2016.

Observed correlation between isotopic composition and inverse concentration of these gases is used for estimation of mean isotopic composition of the local source. Monitoring of atmospheric CO 2 has been initiated in Krakow in 1982. The sampling point is located in a polluted urban area with strong contribution of anthropogenic gases originating both from local sources (coal burning, car traffic, leakages from city gas network, landfills) and large distant emitters - industrial district located ca. 80 km to the west from Krakow (Silesia district). Quasi-continuous measurements of CO 2 , and CH 4 concentrations in the low atmosphere are performed using gas chromatographic method. For isotope measurements, the atmospheric CO 2 is continuously sampled by sorption on molecular sieve in be-weekly intervals and radiocarbon concentration is measured by liquid scintillation spectrometer, while Î´ 13 C is determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Measurement error (1Ï for single measurement) is in the order of 0.1 ppm for CO 2 concentration, Â±8 per mille for Î´ 14 C, and Â± 0.1 per mille for Î´ 13 C. In 1994, a new station for regular observations of greenhouse gases in lower atmosphere was set up in the High Tatra mountains, at Kasprowy Wierch (49 deg. N, 20 deg. E, 1980 m a.s.l., 300 m above the tree line). Kasprowy Wierch, with only small influences from local sources of trace gases can be considered as a reference station for this region of Poland. The record of CO 2 and CH 4 concentration and their isotope composition obtained at Kasprowy Wierch is considered as a background level for Krakow observations. The presented study was aimed at better characterisation and quantification of the local\n\nHomicides with corpse dismemberment in the material collected by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Krakow, Poland.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKonopka, Tomasz; BolechaÅa, Filip; Strona, Marcin; Kopacz, PaweÅ\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim of the study: To determine the circumstances which can be useful for offenders profiling in homicide cases with victim's body dismemberment. Material and methods: Study of all homicide cases with victim's corpse dismemberment examined in Krakow Department of Forensic Medicine over the last 50 years. Results: Within the past 50 years, a total number of 30 cases of homicides with dismembered bodies were examined in Krakow. 22 cases represent defensive mutilations performed by offender, 3 cases can be classified as offensive muti-lations and 3 cases represent aggressive mutilations - decapitation as a method of committing homicide. In this period the only 1 case of necrophilic mutilations was examined, when the body was dismembered without murder. In most cases the background of homicide was the family conflict, 6 was cause of mental illness of perpetrator and in 3 was sexual motive. Only in 3 cases (from 25 when the offender was known) perpetrator kill a stranger. In the other the offender belonged to the family or friends of the victim. In all cases where the perpetrator was determined, homicide and dismemberment was performed in his place of residence. The findings of the Police investigations indicate that in most cases homicides were not planned, occurred under the influence of emotion, only two have been previously scheduled. Conclusions: Homicides with corpses dismemberment usually are committed by offenders who is in close relationship with victim (family or friend). Dismemberment is almost always performed in the same place as murder - home of perpetrator. This type of homicide usually is not planned.\n\nEarthworks logistics in the high density urban development conditions - case study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSobotka, A.; Blajer, M.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRealisation of the construction projects on highly urbanised areas carries many difficulties and logistic problems. Earthworks conducted in such conditions constitute a good example of how important it is to properly plan the works and use the technical means of the logistics infrastructure. The construction processes on the observed construction site, in combination with their external logistics service are a complex system, difficult for mathematical modelling and achievement of appropriate data for planning the works. The paper shows describe and analysis of earthworks during construction of the Centre of Power Engineering of AGH in Krakow for two stages of a construction project. At the planning stage in the preparatory phase (before realization) and in the implementation phase of construction works (foundation). In the first case, an example of the use of queuing theory for prediction of excavation time under random work conditions of the excavator and the associated trucks is provided. In the second case there is a change of foundation works technology resulting as a consequence of changes in logistics earthworks. Observation of the construction has confirmed that the use of appropriate methods of construction works management, and in this case agile management, the time and cost of the project have not been exceeded. The success of a project depends on the ability of the contractor to react quickly when changes occur in the design, technology, environment, etc.\n\nHomicides with corpse dismemberment in the material collected by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Krakow, Poland\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTomasz Konopka\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Aim of the study : To determine the circumstances which can be useful for offenders profiling in homicide cases with victimâs body dismemberment.

In this respect, paintings by Krakow artists stand out against other works of contemporary art both in Poland and globally. Their art should be discussed in the context of early modern meditatio mortis and tenebristic âbaroqueismâ, to which the artists themselves readily admit. The point of departure (frequently referred to as homage are mystic visions, portraits by El Greco, Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡nâs bodegÃ³ns or eschatological âdeath hieroglyphicsâ by Juan de ValdÃ©s LÃ©al. References to works by the Iberian masters are accompanied by links to Carmelite writings or Jesuit mystics. Formal and ideological analysis also allows us to ask a question of the possibility of presenting the âmystic theologyâ described by St. Theresa of the Infant Jesus, St. John of the Cross or St. Ignatius of Loyola in contemporary religious paintings.\n\nPreliminary studies of the dynamic stiffness modules of soil samples from the Solvay Sodium Plant waste landfill in Krakow\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPilecka ElÅ¼bieta\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article presents the results of laboratory tests for determining the dynamic modules of the elasticity M and the shear G, for soil samples from the landfill of the closed Solvay Sodium Plant in Krakow. The tests were performed using a triaxial apparatus equipped with âbenderâ piezoelements. The samples subjected to these tests were taken from two boreholes, located in the area known as the âwhite seasâ, whose formation is the result of Solvay Plant activity throughout the 20th century. The location of the test holes was planned at the place in which a road known as the âÅagiewnicka routeâ was planned. Studies on soil stiffness were also conducted as part of the one of the dissertation from 2008 to 2010 in the Cracow University of Technology. The results of these tests and the results of the laboratory tests that are presented in the article will be used in the designing of a computer model. This model is intended to help in assessing the dynamic impact of motor vehicle traffic on the planned Åagiewnicka route on the structure of the existing buildings located in the former Solvay Plant.\n\nAssessment the impact of samplers change on the uncertainty related to geothermalwater sampling\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWÄ tor, Katarzyna; Mika, Anna; SekuÅa, Klaudia; Kmiecik, Ewa\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the impact of samplers change on the uncertainty associated with the process of the geothermal water sampling. The study was carried out on geothermal water exploited in Podhale region, southern Poland (MaÅopolska province). To estimate the uncertainty associated with sampling the results of determinations of metasilicic acid (H2SiO3) in normal and duplicate samples collected in two series were used (in each series the samples were collected by qualified sampler). Chemical analyses were performed using ICP-OES method in the certified Hydrogeochemical Laboratory of the Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology Department at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow (Certificate of Polish Centre for Accreditation No. AB 1050). To evaluate the uncertainty arising from sampling the empirical approach was implemented, based on double analysis of normal and duplicate samples taken from the same well in the series of testing. The analyses of the results were done using ROBAN software based on technique of robust statistics analysis of variance (rANOVA). Conducted research proved that in the case of qualified and experienced samplers uncertainty connected with the sampling can be reduced what results in small measurement uncertainty.\n\nTHE IMPACT OFWEATHER TYPES ON AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF KRAKOW(POLAND\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPIOTROWICZ KATARZYNA\n\n2014-03-01\n\nFull Text Available This study set out to identify the impact of weather types in Krakow on the frequency of suicides by hanging in the period 1991-2002, on cases of acute coronary syndrome (2002-2004, high concentration of suspended particles PM10 and tropospheric ozone (2005-2012 and on the pollen seasons of hazel and birch (1991-2012. Attention was also given to trends of change in selected weather types over the study period (1901-2012. The weather types to be investigated were identified using a number of factors, including: air temperature, relative sunshine duration, precipitation, snow cover, thunderstorms, and sultriness. It was found that some of these weather types could have an adverse effect on human health and even contribute to death.\n\n[The role of world opinion in rescuing Krakow scientists involved in the \"Sonderaktion Krakau\"].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBolewski, A\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe Author, participant and victim of the \"Sonderaktion Krakau\", remembers circumstances of insidious imprisonment of Krakow professors performed on November 6, 1939 by SS Operation Group under command of SS-StumbannfÃ¼hrer Bruno MÃ¼ller. Based on archival research and relations of the participants of this action, he reconstructs fate of the imprisoned scientists and he analyses activities of political, governmental and diplomatic centers in Poland and particularly abroad towards liberation of the prisoners. A significant role in this international action was played by foreign scientific centers and universities as well as world press agencies. Due to this multinational solidarity, only 20 person out of 183 scientists imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau Nazi camps lost their lives. The article is supplemented by a list of publications on the \"Sonderaktion Krakau\" written by ex-prisoners.\n\nRisk to Krakow population of gamma radiation from building materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKoperski, J.; Jasinska, M.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA statistics was made of 7128 dwelling-houses considering their age, types of building materials and density of population. Gamma dose rates were measured by means of the TL and pressurized ionization chamber techniques inside 300 buildings and in 44 points outdoors over different kinds of beddings. Personal doses of 49 inhabitants of the buildings monitored were also recorded. By means of the spectrometric analysis of gamma radiation, and basing on a specially developed computational programme ''DOZA'' mean concentrations of 40 K, 226 Ra and 232 Th in 61 samples of building materials were evaluated. It was found that the mean personal dose rate as well as the mean indoor dose rate equals 5.7 urad/h /15.8 pGy/s/ and is about 19% higher than the dose outdoors which equals 4.8 urad/h /13.3 pGy/s/. Gamma dose rates inside the buildings made of gravel-sand concrete elements are about 10% lower than those in the buildings made of red bricks. Mean annual dose equivalent per capita from gamma radiation of building materials equals 40.6 mrem/y /406 uSv/y/, which constitutes about 57% of total annual dose equivalent per capita from all environmental sources of gamma radiation in the residential districts in Krakow.

Implementation of free public transport for citizens is widely considered in different countries, cities and on several administrative government levels. However, there are not may examples of successful implementation if this concept in Europe. This work presents the discussion on multi-dimensional barriers, which make implementation of equity criteria to transport policies difficult. Both advantages and disadvantages of free of charge public transport system are presented, based on current discussions, as well as on some European examples, case studies and scientific evaluations. The case study simulation for the Krakow urban area is initiated and described, testing the effects of free of charge public transport on economic and mobility factors. Considerations presented in this work are based on current challenges to build green with multimodal transport, respecting factors of economy, traffic volumes, safety and environmental factors. It is predicted that success of free public transport for citizens could create a significant shift in travel demand from private car use toward trams and busses, reducing accident costs, decreasing congestion in city centers and limiting air pollution, contributing to social and economic growth of the whole metropolitan area.

THE WAY IN WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE IN KRAKOW PERCEIVE SYMBOLS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarta Jarzyna\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Symbols are essential elements of each culture. Thanks to them the meaning is created and tradition is kept alive. Advertising and marketing specialist quite often use the meanings of the symbols to create trademarks. In this way specialists refer to the assotiations rooted in the tradition.In my article I am trying to answer following questions: Has logo become symbol? Has logo taken over all the function of the symbol? Can we tell the difference between the meaning of the advertisement and the cultural meaning? I also want to find out, what people understand through the meaning of the symbol. Therfore I have conducted the survey among the high school students and the customers of three banks of Krakow. My researches have shown that most young people find it difficult to define the meaning of the symbol. Moreover high school students cannot show the difference between the symbol and the trade mark.\n\nTRACE ELEMENT CONTENTS IN TOPSOIL LOCATED NEAR STEEL PLANT IN KRAKOW-NOWA HUTA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaweÅ MundaÅa\n\n2014-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents the results of cadmium, lead and zinc contents in topsoils of arable land located in vicinity Steel Plant in Krakow-Nowa Huta. Soil samples were collected in autumn 2007 from the 0-20 cm layer placed in a west-east trnsect of 7,5 km length. It started approximately 5km east form the border of the steel plant. .Sampled area is characterized by high level of agriculture, where the dominant crops have been vegetables, mainly cabbage and cauliflower. It was found, the soil was not contaminated with heavy metals. All samples met the requirements of the Polish Minister of the Environment. Also the assessment according to Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation method showed only incerased content 60% in case of zinc and only 13% for Cd. Any levels of pollution were not observed. There also decreasing trend of accumulation were stated as a function of growing distance from the steel plant.\n\nRadioactivity measurements in Krakow surroundings in the aftermath of Chernobyl reactor accident\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCywicka-Jakiel, T.; Grychowski, P.; Hajdas, I.; Jasinska, M.; Kolakowski, L.; Loskiewicz, J.; Mazgaj, Z.; Mikulski, J.; Ochab, E.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA team from different laboratories of the Institute of Nuclear Physics was formed to set a crash program of measurement of water and food contamination after the Chernobyl reactor accident. The main contaminants in the first days were 131 I and 132 Te which were superseded later on by 104 Ru, 137 Cs and 134 Cs. The highest value of contamination of surface waters by 131 I was attained in the Vistula river on the 2-nd of May with 530 Bq/dm 3 . Also measurements of food contamination by 131 I, 134 Cs, 137 Cs and 137 Te were carried out. The additional effective dose equivalent related to Chernobyl accident received by the population of Krakow region in May 1986 was estimated at 0.45 mSV (45 rem). Another rise of 134 Cs + 137 Cs content up to 46 Bq/dm 3 in cows milk was observed during March and April 1987 and was probably explicable by the use of hay harvested in June 1986.

The area is located in close proximity to the center of Krakow and is surrounded by places of worship. The analyzed area is characterized by specific physical and chemical properties of the substrate (soda production waste that manifest themselves e.g. in very high salinity and the presence of numerous processes of water erosion. The former landfill covers an area of 1 km2 and is a natural link between the two large settlements in the southern part of Krakow, namely KurdwanÃ³w and Borek FaÅÄcki. The developed landscape concept is based on a detailed analysis of the physicochemical substrate and the conditions necessary for the foundation of buildings and civil engineering. In the research phase, the technical and natural inventory was made, and a detailed review of the literature in the field of land use with similar properties was performed. The designing process was guided by the information contained in the available planning documents and the needs of the local community, which presented in the literature of other scientists. As a result of the research, the concept of omni-zoning area landfills was established. The main assumptions are based on the concept of the nineteenth-century idea of the garden city, consisting in dividing the area into 6 main thematic areas, i.e. parks, which are described in detail in the article. The main functions (leisure and recreation have been supplemented with historical and touristic elements.\n\nASSESSING THE IMPACT OF WIND SPEED AND MIXING-LAYER HEIGHT ON AIR QUALITY IN KRAKOW (POLAND IN THE YEARS 2014-2015\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRobert OLENIACZ\n\n2016-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper discusses the role of wind speed and mixing-layer height in shaping the levels of pollutant concentrations in the air of Krakow (Southern Poland. The hourly averaged measurements of concentrations of selected air pollutants and wind speed values from the period of 2014-2015, recorded at two of the air quality monitoring stations within Krakow (both industrial and urban background were used for this purpose. Temporal variability of mixing-layer height in the area of the monitoring stations was determined using numerical modelling with the CALMET model and the measurements derived from, i.a., two upper air stations. It was found that wind speed and mixing-layer height are in at least moderate agreement with the concentration values for some pollutants. For PM10, PM2.5, NO2, NOx, CO and C6H6 correlation coefficient is of negative value, which indicates that the low wind speed and low mixing-layer height may be the dominant reason for elevated concentrations of these substances in the air, especially in the winter months. Moderate but positive correlation was found between O3 concentrations and analysed meteorological parameters, proving that the availability of appropriate precursors and their inflow from the neighbouring areas have an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone. On the other hand, in case of SO2, a weak both positive and negative correlation coefficient was obtained, depending on the period and location of the station concerned.\n\nCo-operation Agreement relating to LHC Commissioning\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2005-01-01\n\nCERN Director-General Robert Aymar and Ryszard Tadeusiewicz, the Rector of the AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, after signing the agreement.
