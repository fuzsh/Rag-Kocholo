        "text": "An event at: 10th Language & Technology Conference: Human Language Technologies as a Challenge for Computer Science and Linguistics\n\nApril 21-23, 2023, Poznan , Poland\n\nhttps://www.ltc.amu.edu.pl/\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS\n\nDespite the fast and ever-advancing development of NLP technologies and tools, not all languages benefit from them equally. Most of the state-of-the-art methods and technologies were developed, experienced, and reported for a small number of well-developed and rich-resourced languages, leaving many other, less-resourced languages behind. The 7th LRL workshops cover areas of research interest in underfunded, less resourced, minority and endangered languages. Since 2009, when the this workshop was organized for the first time as a LRLs dedicated workshop, the importance and interest in LRL specific LT problems has been systematically increasing in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Caucasian countries (colleagues from this region were very active already at LTC19). The appearance at the last LRL workshops of contributions from Central Africa and Oceania proves that there is a room for further expansion of the LTC/LRL community. We intend to strengthen this tendency by proposing the 7th LRL workshop as a forum for the presentation of specific problems faced by the LRL community but also as a platform to present recent achievements on the way from the status of a Low-Resourced-Language to the position of a High-Resourced-Language.\n\nCo-Chairs\n\n- Mirsaid Aripov, Uzbekistan\n\n- Elmurod Kuriyozov, Spain\n\n- Sanatbek Matlatipov, Uzbekistan\n\n- Patrick Paroubek, France\n\n- Zygmunt Vetulani, Poland\n\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE\n\n- Mersaid Aripov, National University of Uzbekistan\n\n- Khalid Choukri, ELDA, France\n\n- Irakli Kardava, Adam Mickiewicz University, PoznaÅ, Poland\n\n- Adnan Kavak, Kocaeli University, Turkey\n\n- Elmurod Kuriyozov, University of A CoruÃ±a, Spain\n\n- Khabibulla Madatov, Urgench State University, Uzbekistan\n\n- Belinda Maia, Uni.

Every second this new tangible information-based reality provides large amounts of data filled with 1) emotional expressions, 2) people's opinions on various topics, and 3) their reasoning revealing decision making processes. These three categories are also closely related to each other and as such should be studied together. This, as never before, provides an opportunity for development and application of natural language processing methods, in particular those regarding such topics as emotion processing, decision making and opinion mining.\n\nWe would like to host high quality papers from researchers with the common interests in knowing more about ourselves and about the world we live in by means of opinion and sentiment analysis, recommendations, Web mining, decision making, etc. We are also interested in gathering researchers working on emotions, psychology, sociology or ethics with Natural Language Processing tools.\n\nWe cordially invite experts, researchers and scholars in relevant fields to consider submission of papers and to join us in a constructive discussion on conference topics at the EDO 2023 Workshop in April 2023.\n\nCo-Chairs\n\n- Pawel DybaÅa (Jagiellonian University, Poland)\n\n- Michal Ptaszynski (Kitami Institute of Technology, Japan)\n\n- Rafal Rzepka (Hokkaido University, Japan)\n\n- Zygmunt Vetulani (Adam Mickiewicz University, PoznaÅ, Poland)\n\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE\n\n- Juuso Eronen, Kitami Institute of Technology, Japan\n\n- Magdalena Igras-Cybulska, AGH, Poland\n\n- Yasutomo Kimura, Otaru University of Commerce, Japan\n\n- Pawel Lubarski, PoznaÅ University of Technology, Poland\n\n- Koji Murakami, Rakuten Inc., USA\n\n- Karol Nowakowski, Tohoku University ofCommunity Service and Science, Japan\n\n- Noriyuki OKUMURA, Otemae University, Japan\n\n- Marcin Skowron, Johannes Kepler University, Austria\n\n- Yuzu Uchida, Hokkai-Gakuen University, Japan\n\n- Zygmunt Vetulani, Adam Mickiewicz University, PoznaÅ, Poland\n\n- Motoki Yatsu, Aoyama Gakuin University, Japan\n\nIMPORTANT DATES:\n\n- Deadline for paper submissions: February 1, 2023\n\n- Notification of acceptance: February 20, 2023 February 7, 2023\n\n- Deadline for camera-ready papers submission: March 1, 2023 February 15, 2023 February 25, 2023\n\n- Conference dates: April 21 - 23, 2023\n\n(The deadlines may change, according to the changes made to the main conference dates and for technical reasons, please visit https://www.ltc.amu.edu.pl/ )\n\nTOPICS (alphabetic, non-exhaustive list) * Affect Analysis (and its applications); * Cognitive aspects of decisions and opinions; * Decisions and NLP; * Ethics and NLP; * Knowledge acquisition; * Opinion Mining; * Pragmatics of decision making; * Preference models; * Recommendation Systems; * Sentiment Analysis; * Social Informatics; * Text mining techniques; * . . .
