Results presented here were obtained by the Polish team of the GRAMLEX project using Polish data but are easily portable to all Indo-European languages. They are of special interest for highly inflectional languages (e.g. for all Slavonic languages). The high portability of results follows from the proposed, very general format of morphological description (GRAMCODE) and from the general character and great simplicity of algorithms referring to this format. In the paper we briefly present the GRAMODE format, as well as the fundamental dictionary based tool for morphological lemmatization and tagging of texts (LEXAN).",
