        "text": "Organizer: Constanţa Vintilă-Ghiţulescu, PI – ERC-2014-CoG no. 646489 Bucharest 4-6 June 2018. The conference revolves around People, Objects and Languages. The aim is to inquire what languages were used by the peoples of the European empires in their daily lives in building their social identities, but also in expressing their religious beliefs. Be they subjects of the Ottoman, Habsburg or Russian Empires, or of “European” countries, they were merchants, noblemen and women, artisans, missionaries, consuls, diplomats or physicians, carrying along their travel objects, lifestyles, behaviours, fashions, and vocabulary. We shall investigate/inquire in what ways languages and linguistic borrowings were shaped by people’s mobility and social interactions. Cultural transfers encompassed words and objects alike can we identify them? In the modern period, French and Italian were the languages of the political and cultural elite, spoken at the princely, royal or imperial courts and in salons of the well-to-do. What were the professional languages of the merchants, artisans, teachers or physicians who regularly travelled between the empires? The conference shall revolve around three main topics: I. Words of Common People and Words of the Elite Is the language of trade and commercial exchange a purely “economic” one? Can we trace a specialized trade language in the archives? How are new fashions and manners reflected in language? Do translations alter the meanings of words and objects? How does the transfer into common language modify fashions, ideas or usage of objects? How did fashion, luxury and consumption influence language, as new terms were adopted and old words abandoned, along with the objects to which they referred? II. Words of the „Self” Words and objects shape/fashion a narrative of identity. Are there “European” models copied and followed by such narratives? III. Words of Religions and Believers The overlap between confessional and linguistic diversity a key theme of our conference. How was the religious discourse adapted when directed towards the common people? IV. Words for Images What is the relation between fashion, luxury self-fashioning and words in the context of the many images available from literary and artistic sources? South-Eastern Europe was not just a source of inspiration for Western artists, but also a market. Aristocrats and merchants commissioned portraits to hang up in their houses, and a number of Western painters arrived to meet the new demand. The Ottoman Empire also became a source of inspiration, and profit, for Orientalist painters who set out to discover the mysteries of the East. They spent time among the Christian and Muslim populations of these regions, obliged by history to live together, and painted the similarities and differences between them. What are the meanings of these portraits and images? What could they tell about people, objects and everyday life? Words from the “Oriental” languages were adopted, whether they be Turkish or Greek, and then later words were taken over from Western languages, particularly from French, at or around the same time as the objects they define came into use; likewise, we propose to examine how older words were replaced, fell out of use entirely or changed their semantic content, especially in cases where it the semantic content] acquired a new pejorative meaning.\n\nDate: July 27th-28th, 2024 Location: Trinity College Dublin, University of Dublin, Ireland Submission Deadline: January 31st 2024. The research team of the ERC funded research project Arabic Poetry in the Cairo Genizah (APCG), based at the Department of Near and Middle Eastern Studies, School of Languages, Literatures and Cultural Studies, Trinity College Dublin, invites scholars and researchers to participate in our upcoming international conference exploring the multifaceted dimensions of the Anthropology of Texts. This conference is part of the ongoing APCG project based in TCD in close collaboration with Cambridge University Library. A crucial strand of the project is to conduct an anthropological study of the Jewish people of medieval and Ottoman Egypt through manuscripts of Arabic and Judaeo-Arabic poetry and secondary literature. The focus is on the role that poetry played in cultural life as an expression of Egyptian-Jewish experience in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. The Anthropology of Texts conference others a dynamic platform for scholars from diverse fields to come together and explore in depth the notion of textuality. This conference aims to unravel the rich tapestry of history, culture, writing systems, and practices that characterized the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. By scrutinizing the contexts in which these texts emerged and the networks through which they travelled, we seek to decipher their role in shaping societies and in being shaped by those societies. Some of the engaging questions we seek to explore are: How do texts, whether scripted, spoken, or material artifacts shape their contemporary societies? What insights do they provide into the value systems, ideologies, and everyday lives of various groups? Can texts become conduits for understanding the interplay between local dynamics and global communities at the time? By tracing cultural intersections and geographic links embedded in these texts, can we reveal unexplored connections between seemingly disparate places and people? Additionally, what can the practices of textual production and inscription reveal about the societies they originated from? We invite submissions on a wide array of topics that align with the conference theme including, but not limited to: Text Production and Circulation: Exploring the dynamics of text creation, transmission, and dissemination in various forms—written, oral, and material artifacts. Text Functions and Social Implications: Investigating the roles of texts in societal contexts, their functions, and the social implications they carried. Reception of Texts: Analyzing how texts were received, interpreted, and integrated into diverse cultural landscapes. Socio-historical Relations and Encounters: Uncovering narratives of interaction, conflict, and cooperation reflected in textual materials. Global Connections: Tracing the threads of interconnectedness that spanned regions and cultures through textual channels. Scribal and Material Practices: Exploring the craftsmanship of text creation including scribal techniques and material choices. Rituals, Customs, and Traditions: Examining the role of texts in perpetuating rituals, customs, and traditions within societies. Value Systems and Everyday Life: Decoding the values, beliefs, and quotidian experiences embedded in textual records. People’s Interaction with their Environment: Unveiling how texts mirror human interaction with the physical and cultural environment. Studies on the Genizah Fragments: Exploring the nuanced tapestry of Jewish-Egyptian community through folk and colloquial poems, or other fragments. Uncovering the nuanced expressions of masculinity, femininity, gender dynamics, as well as personal sexuality and public morality through the writings of the Jewish-Egyptian community. We invite submissions for individual papers and panels. Paper proposals should comprise a 250-300-word abstract along with a brief biographical note detailing research interests and relevant publications. Panel proposals should designate a session chair and include a session abstract, title, and concise abstracts for each participant’s paper, along with their respective biographies. A bursary will be provided towards travel and accommodation costs and the selected papers will be published in an open-access volume. Please submit all proposals to Mohamed Ahmed (ahmedm4@tcd.ie) and Sally Abed (abeds@tcd.ie) by January 31st 2024."
