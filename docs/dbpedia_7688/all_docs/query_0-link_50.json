It employed cross-sectional descriptive designed method. The study participants included all nurses and midwives that attended the Kwara State Mandatory Continuing Professional Development Programme. A total of 87 questionnaires were administered using availability and purposive sampling technique, but 75 filled questionnaires were valid for data analysis. The instrument used for data collection in this study was a self-structure questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed through the use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings revealed that majority of the nurses and midwives, 49 (65.3%), attended the workshop for the purpose of equipping self for better service delivery, 33 (44%) attended Mandatory Continuous Professional Development Program workshop for the purpose of licensure renewal while others 29 (38.7%) attended so as to broaden their knowledge. It was also revealed that majority of the respondents, 72 (96%), believe the program added to their knowledge of care, and most 69 (92%) of the respondents said the knowledge gained changed their orientation towards patients’ care, while good number 70 (93.3%) of them believe that the knowledge gained during the program can improve the nursing care they would render. It was concluded that the mandatory continuous professional development programme has a lot of benefits the major motive behind the attendance of nurse and midwives at the mandatory continuous professional development programme workshop is for the purpose of equipping self for better service delivery.\n\nPage(s): 29-37 Date of Publication: 10 March 2023\n\n1.

The data collection sourced from relevant literature review comprised of articles, books, journals, and the web paged.\n\nFrom the structural-functionalist or functionalism, and the conflict perspective termed as the theoretical frameworks, this paper doubts not the efficacy of sports, precisely the County Meet observed in Libera as a unifying force bringing together but a miscalculated prescription for reconciliation in Liberia. It sees sports as an emotional strategy or intervention but unrelated to the root causes of conflict that does not remove the semblances underlying the causes of the very conflict.\n\nThe paper argues that, as a context-driven concept, reconciliation is dictated by a society based on the nature, gravity, or complexity of the conflict. In the case of Liberia, this article argues that evidenced by the demand for justice, the Liberian society does not place a premium on sports (County Meet) as a pillar and strategy for reconciliation.\n\nJudging from other societies that are still struggling with the ugly legacy and semblances of violent conflict despite the observance of sports as a tool for reconciliation, the paper concluded that although the Liberian society embraced the County Meet as a unifier but does not see it as a durable solution because it has nothing to do with the root causes of the 14 years of civil war. In other words, the civil war was not about the denial of sports. So, why use it as a strategy or invention to reconcile Liberia? Instead, the war was also about the issue of justice.\n\nFinally, the paper through recommendation called upon practitioners and experts in the theater of peace and conflict studies to rethink sports as a unifying force to reconcile society emerging from violent conflict.\n\nPage(s): 38-47 Date of Publication: 14 March 2023\n\n1.

But, finding the relevant information, in such sources, became a big challenge and time consumption due to the massive size of data those sources contain. Automatic text summarization is an important facility to overcome such a problem. To this end, many text summarization algorithms have been proposed based on different techniques and different methodologies. Text features are the main entries in text summarization, where each feature plays a different role for showing the most important content. This study introduces the polynomial networks (PN) for Arabic text summarization problem. The role of the polynomial networks (PN) is to compute optimal weights, through the training process of PN classifier, where these weights were used to adjust the text features scores. Adjusting the text features scores creates a fair dealing with those features according to their importance and plays an important role in the differentiation between higher and less important ones. The proposed model produces a summary of an original document through classifying each sentence as summary sentence or non-summary sentence. Six summarizers (Naïve Bayes, AQBTSS, Gen–Summ, LSA–Summ, Sakhr1 and Baseline–1) were used as benchmarks. The proposed model and benchmarks were evaluated using the same dataset (EASC – the Essex Arabic Summaries Corpus). The results shew that the proposed model defeats the all six summarizers. In addition, the rate error results of both the proposed model (PN classifier) and Naïve Bayes (NB classifier), it is a clear that the proposed model (PN classifier) works better. In general, the proposed model provides a good enhancement indicating that the polynomial networks (PN) are a promising technique for text summarization problem.\n\nPage(s): 74-84 Date of Publication: 21 March 2023\n\n1.
