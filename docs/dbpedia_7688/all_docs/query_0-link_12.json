        "text": "The question of the Blue Police appears as fundamentally multivariate. It is impossible to understand the actions of the policemen without integrating them into the broader scope of their tasks. I suggest that three key factors shaped the behavior of the Blue Policemen: the German Order Police, the Underground State, and the local population. This triangular matrix of pressures represents the structure within which the agency of the policemen must be placed. I argue that the behavior of the Polish policemen was far more situational than it was ideological in nature. In particular, the case of the Blue Police points to a less determinate role of antisemitism – especially understood in terms of \"hatred\" – in the spectrum of motivation. This does not negate the presence of antisemitism in its ranks or the deadly role the policemen played in relation to Jews in hiding, but it does question the “attitude-behavior consistency” as a sufficient explanation for participation in murder. The men of the Blue Police emerge here as far more \"ordinary\" than the men of Police Battalion 101. In fact, arguably much less is required to explain their behavior. Further, it also makes little sense to cast the policemen in one-dimensional categories of perpetrators, collaborators or heroes, as individual policemen often embodied these contradictions in one person, dictated by the dynamic situation of the police under occupation.\n\nThis article presents an exchange of letters between Wacław Sierpiński and Paul Montel during the year 1945. This correspondence, translated here into English, provides insight into how and in what form the French learned about the dramatic fate of many Polish mathematician colleagues during the war. We also give a short biography of the two protagonists, as well as some facts about the mathematicians mentioned in the letters.\n\nAstonishingly, we still do not have a history of collaboration in Poland during World War II. Klaus-Peter Friedrich shows that the building blocks for such a history already exist, however. They are scattered throughout the contemporary Polish press and studies on the Nazi occupation regime. Examples include institutionalized cooperation (Baudienst, Polish Police), ethnically defined segments of the population (Volksdeutsche), informal support of Nazi projects on ideological common ground (anti- Semitism and anticommunism), and the stance of the Polish peasantry as well as the Roman Catholic Church. Friedrich concludes that collaboration eludes study because of a mental image according to which ethnic Poles were the foremost victims of the occupiers and heroically resisted them. Questionable views of national self-interest keep Polish society from coming to terms with the past. Nevertheless, debates on “Polish collaboration” continue to recur—as they have since 1939.\n\nThis article is part of the special cluster titled Conceptualizations of the Holocaust in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine since the 1990s, guest edited by Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe. The attitude of the Polish Home Army (AK) to Nazi exterminationist policies is among the most controversial topics of wartime Polish–Jewish relations. Scholarly studies appearing since the 1980s have reconstructed the Home Army’s complex local and national organizations, its many sub-divisions and departments, its policies and objectives, as well as its sacrifice in the Warsaw Uprising of August–September 1944. In this article, I will analyze Holocaust survivor testimonies as a source for evaluating the attitude and behavior of the Home Army towards the Jews during the Second World War. Archival repositories used will include testimonies preserved at the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, the Yad Vashem Archives in Jerusalem, the Fortunoff Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale, and the S...\n\nThe border shifts and population exchanges between Central and East European states agreed at the 1945 Potsdam Conference continue to reverberate in the culture and politics of those countries. Focusing on Poland, this article proposes the term “border trouble” to interpret the politicized split in memory that has run through Polish culture since the end of the Second World War. Border trouble is a form of cultural trauma that transcends binaries of perpetrator/victim and oppressor/oppressed; it is also a tool for analyzing the ways in which spatial imagination, memory, and identity interact in visual and literary narratives. A close analysis of four recent feature films demonstrates the emergence of a visual grammar of cosmopolitan memory and identity in relation to borderland spaces. Wojciech Smarzowski’s Róża (“Rose,” 2011) and Agnieszka Holland’s Pokot (“Spoor,” 2017) are both set in territories that were transferred from Germany to Poland in 1945. Wołyń (“Volhynia,” released internationally as “Hatred,” 2016) and W ciemności (“In Darkness,” 2011), also directed by Smarzowski and Holland respectively, are set in regions that were under Polish administration before the war but were transferred to Soviet Ukraine in 1945. All four productions break new ground in the memorialization of the post-war legacy in Poland. They deconstruct hitherto dominant discourses of simultaneity and ethnic homogeneity, engaging in Poland’s wars of symbols as a third voice: anti-nationalist, but also refusing to essentialize cosmopolitan identity. They show the evolution of border trouble in response to contemporary political and cultural developments.\n\nThe contribution of Russian emigrants to World War II is widely known, but most often it brings to mind their cooperation and engagement on the Axis side. However, there were several individuals among the post-revolution Russian diaspora in Poland, who decided to fight the Germans and their allies as part of the Polish resistance movement and the Grand Coalition 1939–45. Russian exiles were involved in conspiratorial endeavours of various orientations, from communist to nationalist ones."
