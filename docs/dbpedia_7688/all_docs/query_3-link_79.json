The aim of this work is the design and development of pipeline of preprocessing tools for media-corpus of the Kazakh language. Media-corpus is hosted by al-Farabi Kazakh National University and serves linguists as an empirical basis for research in the contemporary written Kazakh language. The development of pipeline of preprocessing tools for media-corpus, the lexical and grammatical features of the Kazakh language were analyzed, on the basis of which the composition of the fundamental rules for changing the words (inflection) of the Kazakh language was determined. In the process of research, the tools for generation and lemmatization of the word forms of the Kazakh language were created. The proposed tools can be applied at the stage of morphological analysis in the systems of automatic analysis of the texts, in the creation of thesauruses and ontologies. For the case of the presence of homonymy, the template method was used, which allow to reduce the level of homonymy.\n\nAB - Nowadays, the Kazakh language belongs to the category of less-resourced languages, as there is a small number of resources developed and accessible to a wide range of users, such as text corpora, electronic dictionaries, morphological analyzers, thesauri, which allow to analyze text documents.
