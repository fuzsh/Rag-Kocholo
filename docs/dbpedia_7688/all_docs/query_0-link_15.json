At the beginning of the 7th Framework Program, recently launched by the European Commission, Human Language Technologies continue to be a challenge for computer science, linguistics and related fields as these technologies become an ever more essential element of our everyday technological environment. Since Ajdukiewicz, Tarski, Turing and Chomsky (i.e. since the very beginning of the Computer Age) these fields have influenced and stimulated each other. Technological, social and cultural globalization has created a favorable climate for the intensive exchange of novel ideas, concepts and solutions across initially distant disciplines. We aim at further contributing to this exchange and we invite you to join us at L&TC'07 in Poznañ, this year. I have pleasure to announce that Piek Vossen (University of Amsterdam) accepted our invitation to give the Keynote Speaker Talk at the conference. Zygmunt Vetulani L&TC'07 Chair vetulani at amu.edu.pl CONTACT Address 3rd Language & Technology Conference (L&T'07) Adam Mickiewicz University Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science Department of Computer Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence ul. Umultowska 87 PL 61-614 Poznañ e-mail: ltc at amu.edu.pl www.ltc.amu.edu.p CONFERENCE TOPICS The conference program will include the following topics (a non-exclusive list): * electronic language resources and tools * formalisation of natural languages * parsing and other forms of NL processing * computer modelling of language competence * NL user modelling * NL understanding by computers * knowledge representation * WordNet technologies, ontologies (cf. L&TC WordNet Special Track) * man-machine NL interfaces * Logic Programming in Natural Language Processing * corpus linguistics * speech processing * NL applications in robotics * text-based information retrieval and extraction, question answering * question answering * tools and methodologies for developing multilingual systems * translation enhancement tools * methodological issues in HLT * prototype presentations * language-specific computational challenges for HLTs (especially for languages other than English) * HLT standards * HLT support for foreign language teaching * communicative intelligence * legal problems connected with HLTs (problems and challenges) * contribution of HLTs to the homeland security problems (application and legal aspects) (cf. L&TC Homeland Security Workshop) * vision papers in the field of HLT * HLT related policies You will have noted that we intend to continue traditional HLT interest areas (cf. L&TC'05 topics). You may also have observed that we have included a new dimension at the frontier between HLTs and the Homeland Security field. We invite authors working in this domain to contribute either on theoretical issues (e.g. legal aspects of development and application of HLTs) or technical developments (applications, software, language infrastructure and tools). Political and mature vision papers in this field are also welcome. (see the Homeland Security Workshop) This list is by no means closed and we are open to further proposals. The Program Committee is also open to suggestions concerning accompanying events (workshops, exhibits, panels, etc). Suggestions, ideas and observations may be addressed directly to the L&TC Chair by email (vetulani at amu.edu.pl). L&TC WORDNET SPECIAL TRACK The WordNet Special Track will be a part of the L&TC'07 event. It will be co-chaired by Karel Pala, Christiane Fellbaum and Piek Vossen. It will focus on development of new WordNets, related tools and WordNet applications in AI. The submission deadlines, fees, registration and payment procedures remain the same as for the rest of the L&TC. For the reviewing purposes only, the contributions should be subtitled \"Submission to L&TC WordNet Special Track\". If you desire to know more please do contact Karel Pala by e-mail (pala at fi.muni.cz). L&TC HOMELAND SECURITY WORKSHOP L&TC Homeland Security workshop will be a part of the L&TC'07 event.
