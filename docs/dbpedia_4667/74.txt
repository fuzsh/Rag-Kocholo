Mr. Mahl is a musician who believes in the transformative powers of music above all else. His hope is to provide meaningful, enriching and educational musical experiences to as many people as possible. Under the belief that the study of music is essentially an exploration of the human condition, and that classical music is infinitely beneficial for every human, he strives to cultivate an appreciation and understanding of music played with the highest possible level of artistry. Mr. Mahlsâ past positions include artistic director of the New Jersey Young Artists Ensembles, the Harmony Program North Orchestra, assistant conductor to the contemporary music ensemble Orchestre 21, in Montreal QC, Urban Playground Chamber Orchestra in New York, New York, Conductor of the Fredonia Symphonia, cover conductor for the Orchard Park Symphony in Buffalo, NY, assistant to all orchestral and operatic activities at SUNY Fredonia, in Fredonia, NY, and assistant to orchestras at Universite de Montreal.

(Eric Mahl cont.) Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music Conducting Workshop, where he worked closely with Marin Alsop and James Ross. His composer in residence program at the WCYO has accounted for four commissions and world premieres for Orchestra and Wind ensemble, as well as the performance of countless contemporary works throughout the season. As a passionate educator, Mr. Mahl has personally taught all ages and instruments at a public and private schools throughout the five boroughs of New York City, and frequently works with student musicians from under-served communities. As a firm believer that music can provide a transformational experience for any child regardless of background, he attempts to engage and inspire students from as many cultural and geographic backgrounds as possible through community engagement activities such as free lectures, workshops, and concerts in addition to working with student orchestras. Mr. Mahl also firmly believes that classical music is for everyone, and that art is an important and necessary vehicle to spur empathy and the understanding of one another, regardless of background. To that end, he continually strives to engage the communities that surround his orchestras through lecture series, interactive workshops, partnerships with other local non-profits and other engagement and educational activities. It is his goal to expose the humanistic meaning behind great works of art, to tear down any and all barriers between the audience and performers and to make everyone feel welcomed and accepted into a symphonic concert. Mr. Mahl received his Bachelors of Music in Education from Ithaca College and continued his studies both at Universite de Montreal and the State University of New York at Fredonia, where he received his masterâs degree. He has studied with some of the foremost conducting pedagogues in the United States including Marin Alsop, James Ross, Harold Farberman, Neil Varon, Marc Gibson, Larry Rachleff, Don Schleicher, Jean-Francois Rivest, Paolo Bellomia, and Joeseph Gifford. He has participated in workshops and competitions in the United States, Canada, the Czech Republic; at the Eastman School of Music, College Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati and Bard College.

Conductors' Notes

Joanna Giordano, String Orchestra This concert program focuses on works by American composers and showcases various moments in American music history. The technique featured in Blue Fire Fiddle r transports the listener back to the very origins of this country in the early 1600s, when settlers played fiddle tunes. Soon Hee Newboldâs fiery melody of sixteenth notes and double stops races ahead atop a sturdy foundation of pizzicato in the lower strings. Next up we have two movements from Serenade for Strings by composer Norman Leyden, who began his professional music career playing bass clarinet in the New Haven Symphony Orchestra. The third movement âNocturneâ uses the unconventional, asymmetrical meter of 5/4 time. It opens and closes with a gentle melody for solo violin which is then passed throughout the orchestra. The fourth movement âCakewalk,â is anything but what the title suggests. A syncopated rhythmic motif punctuates throughout the movement, with constant changes in dynamic and tonality keeping the listener on their toes. Leyden craftily weaves in melodic material from the first and third movements of Serenade for Strings in the violins as the rhythmic ostinato chugs along in the lower strings. Next we turn to It Donât Mean a Thing (If It Ainât Got That Swing) , a jazz standard by Duke Ellington and Irving Mills representing a quintessentially American genre of music. Our musicians have greatly enjoyed learning this famous tune, with its âblueâ notes, scat rhythms, and dramatic articulations. The final piece of our summer program, Warrior Legacy by Soon Hee Newbold, is emblematic not only of the legacy of the United States but also of the WCYO as we celebrate our 20th anniversary. Warrior Legacy opens with a bold and foreboding ostinato followed by a solemn but hopeful melody. The piece transitions into a lively compound meter and finishes in bold, dramatic fashion. However, the most exciting thing about Warrior Legacy is the collaboration between our String Orchestra and our Wind Ensembleâan opportunity that these musicians have greatly enjoyed.

Albert Montecalvo, Wind Ensemble

Warrior Legacy I am happy to combine the Wind Ensemble with the String Orchestra for Warrior Legacy. Because of the differences of beginning string and band instruments such as key signatures, transpositions and fingerings it is often not until high school or beyond that these two instrument groups combine together in an ensemble. Thank you to WCYO for giving me the opportunity to conduct these two groups today and also to Joanna Giordano for preparing the String Orchestra so well. Encanto This is the shortened version of Encanto. I thought of it as a musical "appetizer" for the longer 10 minute Gershwin "main entree" which follows. As usual, Robert W. Smith makes great musical sense despite the complex meter and rhythmic intricacies of this little gem.

Conductors' Notes

Symphonic Gershwin As in several other selections previously performed by the Wind Ensemble, I feel it is important that young band musicians should have the opportunity to experience classic American composers even though most selections of this nature are written for orchestra. Gershwin has always been a favorite of mine. His music straddles classical, modern, jazz, blues and popular styles. This selection features themes from three of Gershwin's most revered pieces, Rhapsody in Blue, An American in Paris and Cuban Overture. I hope that in the future when these students hear these themes they can say "I know that music, we played it in WCYO."

Eric Mahl, Symphony Orchestra

Upon the first few performances of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovskyâs Fifth Symphony in 1888, he was convinced the piece was a failure - stating that âIt was clear to me that the applause and ovations referred not to this but to other works of mine, and that the Symphony itself will never please the public.â Forever a self-doubting perfectionist, the Symphony today stands as one of the great orchestral masterworks, and a pinnacle of the Romantic Era. Romanticism in music, while associated with sweeping strings, long melodies, and emotional depth, had much more to do with philosophy than any particular âsound.â The general ideal for the Romantics was to express what it means to be human through a musical narrative. Every composer in this era had different ideas for how to accomplish this, but Tchaikovskyâs compositional techniques and ingenuity make this piece particularly poignant. Specifically, Tchaikovsky employed the use of a recurring theme that returns throughout the entirety of the symphony. This theme, played at the very beginning of the piece by the clarinets, has a somber, almost dejected tone. Throughout the symphony though, the very same theme changes keys, character, dynamic, instrumentation and purpose. The Second movement for example, one the most remarkable slow movements in orchestral literature and a kind of distillation of the human condition, has this theme return twice; first as a triumphant hero staving off a terrible fate, and second as the terrible fate itself. The final movement sees this theme being used at both the beginning and the end - as a final victory over the forces of evil, both outside of us and within us. As the Symphony reaches a thrilling conclusion, Tchaikovsky also brings back the minor, sinister main theme from the first e minor movement, now in E major and as a heralding call of triumph in the trumpets and horn. This of course harkens back to Beethovenâs 5th symphony which we played at our first concert, and begins in a terrifying c minor, and ends in jubilant C major (itâs easy to see how Beethoven is known for ushering in the Romantic Era!). If we keep our ears open, these returns of thematic material give us something to hold on to. Pillars of sound that we can latch onto as listeners, and guide us through this epic narrative. Ultimately, this narrative is about overcoming - about the greatness of joy, and of finding hope even in the darkest of times.
