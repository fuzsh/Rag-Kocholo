This passion led her to co-found the Pacific Crest Trio in 2020, a group that dives into multiple genres and prioritizes engaging more audiences and community outreach.

Her mother Karen was the first violinist of the quartet before she started her own chamber music organization in Seattle, called Chamber Music Madness. From a young age Ariana participated in this program, which involved monthly all day chamber music marathons with like minded peers, sight-reading difficult string quartet repertoire.

She has played in a number of student composer concerts at the Juilliard School and the Shepherd School of Music.

During Tanglewood’s Festival of Contemporary Music she performed chamber music and orchestral music by composers including Dallapicolla, Druckman, and Messaien.

As soloist, chamber musician, and orchestral performer, he has been heard in 16 countries across four continents. He was recently appointed Principal Second Violin of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.\n\nBorn in Córdoba, Argentina, a teenage Jeremías’ big break nearly got him expelled. While he had finally been accepted to study with the vaunted violinist Fernando Hasaj, Jeremías needed to commute to Buenos Aires—a 20 hour round trip by bus which forced him to miss multiple days of school at a time. When threatened with losing his musical education, the young violinist underwent rigorous study to attain his high school diploma at 15, freeing himself to focus on music as his love.\n\nHis hard work paid off. Eventually plucked out of Argentina to join the New England Conservatory and later The Juilliard School, Jeremías quickly developed a deep orchestral resume: he was a member of both the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Chicago’s Grant Park Symphony. Throughout his career, Jeremías has been invited to the world’s most elite summer festivals, including the Perlman Music Program, Music@Menlo, Taos, Kneisel, Aspen, and Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nOutside the symphony orchestra, Jeremías remains in demand from a variety of ensembles.

He is a founding member of the Frisson Ensemble—with whom he was featured in NPR’s Performance Today—and has served as concertmaster of the New York Classical Players. Jeremías is also a member of the NYC based Sonora Collective, a musicians collective that collaborates with contemporary artists to create vibrant performance experiences in special venues and installation spaces. Holding close to his Argentinian roots, Jeremías also enjoys performing with several tango groups in New York. Most notably, he is a founding member of the Pedro Giraudo Tango Quartet, winners of the 2018 Latin GRAMMY® Award.\n\nIn 2016, following the previous year’s devastating earthquake, Jeremías joined the acclaimed violinist Midori in Nepal for a benefit string quartet tour of refugee camps, hospitals, and schools, culminating in a performance at the United Nations in Kathmandu. Later in 2017, the same group would conduct a quartet tour across Japan, with feature performances in Tokyo’s Oji Hall and Osaka’s Phoenix Hall.\n\nAfter picking up his violin at the age of 3, Jeremías first toured his home country as a soloist at 10, and returned to win First Prize at the Argentine Hebrew Foundation Competition. He owes much of his great fortune to the violinist Miriam Fried who, upon their meeting at a music festival in Brazil, encouraged a young Jeremías to study with her at the New England Conservatory, where he received his Bachelor of Music. Jeremías holds additional degrees from The Juilliard School (M.M.) and the Manhattan School of Music (P.S.C.) and is also deeply grateful to his other primary teachers: Ronald Copes, Glenn Dicterow, Lisa Kim, Sylvia Rosenberg, and Fabricio Valvasori.\n\nHe is based in New York City, where he lives with his wife, the flutist and social media influencer Katherine Althen-Velázquez, and their Havanese dog Miguel.
