        "text": "Lin Baird\n\nDirector, Cormont Music\n\nLin Baird is Professor of Music at Western Michigan University, where she teaches horn, classical music improvisation, and is a member of the Western Brass Quintet and Western Wind Quintet. International performing invitations have taken her to Spain, Russia, China, the Netherlands, Thailand, Colombia, Honduras, and Canada. In Michigan, she often performs with the Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestras. During the summer, she regularly teaches horn at WMU’s High School Summer Music Camp (Seminar) and the Kendall Betts Horn Camp in Lyman, New Hampshire.

Her final project for the DMA degree includes a full-length professional recording and an annotated guide to works for horn and piano by female composers and a Web site at www.linfoulk.org, which lists over 1,000 works with horn by female composers. Her principal teachers include Douglas Hill, Nancy Cochran, Laurence Lowe, and Bruce Heim.\n\nThomas Cowan\n\nPresident and Chair of the Board of Directors, Cormont Music\n\nThomas Cowan now makes his home at Columbia University. This follows the first half of his career at IBM and the second half building software companies.\n\nTom rose through the leadership ranks to become CEO, Board Director, and Board Chair of more than ten companies – including public, private, not-for-profit, and academic organizations.\n\nToday, Tom’s focus is on change, technology, and leadership – with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence and the leadership paths forward.\n\nTom has served on numerous boards, including OutlookSoft, Tivoli, Tagetik, PGA.com, and NHL.com. He has chaired audit, compensation, governance, and nominating committees. He has also been Executive in Residence at RockRidge Capital Partners.\n\nCurrently, Tom is on the faculty at Columbia University and serves as Associate Director of the Columbia University Center for Technology Management.

Rickover and his leadership approach.\n\nTom’s academic background includes undergraduate work at Wake Forest University, an MBA from the University of South Carolina, and doctoral studies at Columbia University.\n\nSteve Eddins\n\nDirector and Technology Advisor, Cormont Music\n\nSteve Eddins develops engineering and scientific software at MathWorks, in Natick, Massachusetts, where he has worked since 1993. He has led software development teams responsible for general-purpose engineering and scientific functions, mathematics, digital image processing, and image and scientific data. He currently specializes in the evolution of technical programming languages and the design of programming language interfaces intended for use by engineers and scientists. Prior to joining MathWorks, Steve was on the engineering faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He coauthored the textbook Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB. Steve holds a bachelor’s degree and a doctorate from the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nSteve is principal horn with the Melrose Symphony and 2nd horn with the Concord Orchestra, two volunteer community orchestras in the Boston area. He has also performed with several other orchestras in the region, including Claflin Hill Symphony Orchestra, Boston Civic Symphony, Wellesley Symphony Orchestra, Symphony Pro Musica, the New England Film Orchestra, and the Carlisle Chamber Orchestra. He studies horn with Hazel Dean Davis.\n\nJohn Ericson\n\nDirector Ex Officio, Cormont Music\n\nJohn Ericson has wide-ranging experience as an orchestral player, soloist, and teacher. Ericson began his professional career with serving for six seasons as Third Horn in the Nashville Symphony. From there, he turned to teaching, first at the Crane School of Music (SUNY Potsdam) and, since 2001, at Arizona State University. Ericson holds degrees from Indiana University (where he served as teaching assistant to Michael Hatfield for three years), the Eastman School of Music (where he studied with Verne Reynolds), and Emporia State University, his hometown university. He has also performed and taught on the summer faculties of the Interlochen Center for the Arts and the Brevard Music Center and is proud to currently serve as an ex officio board member of the Kendall Betts Horn Camp.\n\nHis three solo CDs on the Summit label received critical acclaim. The Horn Call hailed Les Adeiux for “Fantastic playing…. The level of musicality, nuance and artistry is not to be missed” and called Canto a “Terrific collaboration between horn and piano.” Among many other orchestral, chamber music, and studio recording projects, a highlight was performance on the Grammy Award nominated Fourth World of Native American flutist R. Carlos Nakai.\n\nCo-founder of the online magazine Horn Matters, his publications are a reflection of his teaching and interest in problem solving and in improving the pedagogy of the horn. With his additional interest in all instruments of the middle brass and in the history of the horn, Ericson has print and online publications on topics as diverse as the mellophone and the Wagner tuba. Ericson is a recipient of the Harold Meek Memorial Award and the Punto Award from the International Horn Society. He has performed and presented sessions at seven international horn symposiums and numerous regional events.\n\nJulie Gerhardt\n\nDirector of KBHC Operations\n\nA native Atlantan, Julie Gerhardt’s musical endeavors include both performance and teaching. Julie holds positions in the Columbus (GA) Symphony Orchestra, the Valdosta Symphony Orchestra, and the Albany (GA) Symphony Orchestra and has served as a substitute or extra hornist with orchestras throughout the Southeast, including the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, LexPhil, Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, and the Charleston Symphony Orchestra among others.

Additionally, Julie has been an audition finalist for positions in the United States Army Field Band, the Atlanta Ballet Orchestra, the Asheville Symphony Orchestra, LexPhil, the Chattanooga Symphony Orchestra, and the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra.\n\nSince earning her undergraduate degree in instrumental music education from Indiana University in 2001, Julie has served as a middle school band director, marching band technician, horn instructor, and music theory professor. Now, in her role as a horn evangelist, Julie maintains a thriving studio of private horn students and works as a horn section coach for middle and high school band programs in the metropolitan Atlanta area.\n\nPerformance experience during college with both Star of Indiana Brass Theater and the Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps gave Julie the foundation for an ongoing relationship with music in motion. In 2006, Julie was an inaugural member of Star United, helping to begin their championship reign on the mini-corps stage of Drum Corps Associates. Julie was highlighted in 2007 as SU’s mellophone soloist but has since retired from mellophone performance, limiting herself to rare renditions of Kopprasch’s first etude, exclusively in the key of E-flat.\n\nJulie’s graduate study took her to the University of Georgia, the University of New Hampshire, and back to her undergraduate alma mater, Indiana University. Julie earned the Master of Arts in Music: Music Studies at UNH in 2010 and the Performer Diploma at IU in 2012.\n\nJulie attended the Kendall Betts Horn Camp in 2006 and 2007. Her first year on KBHC staff was 2009, she was the camp’s associate operations director in 2017, and she’s been the operations director since 2018.\n\nJulie’s primary teachers include Michael Hatfield, Myron Bloom, Dr. Jean Martin-Williams, Richard Deane, Kendall Betts, Rick Seraphinoff, Dale Clevenger, and Jeff Nelsen.\n\nNikki LaBonte\n\nAssistant Artistic Director, Kendall Betts Horn Camp\n\nNikolette LaBonte, a native of South Florida, is an alumna of KBHC.

In addition to the RPO and HSO, she has had the opportunity to perform with orchestras across the country including the New York Philharmonic, Buffalo Philharmonic, New World Symphony, and Syracuse-based Symphoria and is an award-winning soloist who recently made her concert debut with the Eastman Philharmonia.\n\nMs. LaBonte received her Bachelor’s Degree in 2018 from the Eastman School of Music under the tutelage of W. Peter Kurau and is currently working to complete her graduate degree coursework under the same guidance. In addition to her degree studies, she maintains a private studio, is a guest clinician with the Rochester Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and University of Rochester Symphony Orchestra, and is a member of several chamber ensembles including the Antara Winds and the American Wild Ensemble.
