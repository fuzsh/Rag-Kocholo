Such states were charged with meaning for the image and conduct of naturalists as a group. Since the Enlightenment, however, wonder has become a 14\n\nAT THE LIMIT\n\ndisreputable passion in workaday science, redolent of the popular, the amateurish, and the childish. Scientists now reserve expressions of wonder for their personal memoirs, not their professional publications. They may acknowledge wonder as a motivation, but they no longer consider it part of doing science. The history of wonder, however, extends beyond the history of its role in the study of nature and its positive or negative valuation therein. Won-\n\nder has its own history, one tightly bound up with the history of other cognitive passions such as horror and curiosity — passions that also traditionally shaped and guided inquiry into the natural world. Not only the valuation of these emotions, but also their proximity and distance from one another, and even their texture as felt experience, have changed with context and over time. The domain of wonder was broad, and its contexts\n\nwere as various as the annual fair, the nave of a cathedral, the princely banquet hall, the philosopher’s study, or the contemplative’s cell. Context colored emotion. Wonder fused with fear (for example, at a monstrous\n\nbirth taken as a portent of divine wrath) was akin but not identical to wonder fused with pleasure (at the same monstrous birth displayed in a Wunderkammer). In the High Middle Ages wonder existed apart from curiosity; in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, wonder and curiosity interlocked. Estrangement and alliance shaped the distinctive objects and the subjective coloring of both passions. Thus in writing a history of wonder as a passion, we have attempted to historicize the passions themselves. To this end, we have adopted one fundamental principle: to attend as precisely as possible to what our sources meant by the passion of wonder and by wonders as objects. We here diverge from most recent students of the pre-modern marvelous, who have tended to define their subject in terms of “what we now call marvels,” in the words of Jacques Le Goff.® This corresponds to a loose category coextensive with what might in English be called the fictional or fantastic and is defined mainly in privative terms as that which is excluded by modern views of the rational, the credible, and the tasteful: the products of imagination, the inventions of folklore and fairy tales, fabulous beasts of legend, freaks of sideshows and the popular press, and, more recently, the uncanny in all its forms. Because this view of wonders was a creation of Enlightenment thinkers, it is hardly surprising that, as Le Goff himself notes, medieval writers “did not possess a psychological, literary, or intellectual category” corresponding to the modern merveilleux.’ Accounts of the subject based on this anachronistic definition are evocative for modern readers, but they lack historical coherence and precision. 15\n\nWONDERS AND THE ORDER OF NATURE\n\nWhat words did medieval and early modern Europeans use for the modern English “wonder” and “wonders”? In Latin, the emotion itself was called admiratio and the objects, mirabilia, miracula, or occasionally ammi-\n\nranda. These terms, like the verb miror and the adjective mirus, seem to have their roots in an Indo-European word for “smile.” (The Greek thauma, on the other hand, found its origin in a verb “to see.”)? The etymological ties between wonder and smiling persisted in the romance languages (merveille in French, meraviglia in Italian, marvel in English from c. 1300),\n\nthough not in the German Wunder —a word of mysterious origin that may have to do with intricacy or complexity — or the English wonder.'° We have followed late medieval and early modern English writers in employing the Germanic wonder and the romance marvel interchangeably in our translations and in our own prose.\n\nExcept for this difference between the Germanic and the romance roots, however, the vocabulary of wonder had a unified profile from at least the twelfth or thirteenth century in all the linguistic traditions we have studied. This argues for a strong common understanding. First, the words for passion and objects were, if not identical, then closely related, signaling the tight links between subjective experience and objective referents. Second, these languages all blurred the sacred and the secular objects of wonder — the miraculous and the marvelous. This suggests the impossibility of wholly divorcing these two kinds of wonders in the dominant Christian culture, although theologians and philosophers upheld an analytical distinction between them; the realms of the supernatural and\n\npreternatural can be differentiated in order to focus on the latter, as we have done in this study, but only with considerable care. Despite this difficulty, we have restricted this study to natural wonders, marvels rather than miracles. Finally, from at least the twelfth century the vernacular terms for wonder, like the Latin, admitted a spectrum of emotional tones or valences, including fear, reverence, pleasure, approbation, and bewilderment. Beginning in the late fifteenth or sixteenth centuries, these different flavors of wonder acquired different names: admiration and astonishment in English, for example, Bewunderung and Staunen in German, and étonnement and admiration in French. This multiplication and refinement of vocabulary signals the prominence of the passion and its nuances in the early modern period. Thus wonder was from at least the\n\nHigh Middle Ages a well-defined but also an extraordinarily rich and complex emotion, with associations that crystallized into separate terms over the course of time. The tradition had a strong coherence, which rested in both the objects of wonder and the passion that they inspired. The canon of natural won16\n\nAT THE LIMIT\n\nders had a stable core throughout the period we have studied (and indeed back into the Hellenistic period), with a penumbra that expanded and contracted as ideas, experiences, and sensibilities changed. At the center lay the most enduring marvels, like African pygmies, the mysterious lode-\n\nstone, the glowing carbuncle, or the properties of petrifying springs. Over the course of time, some objects dropped out of this canon for various reasons. The basilisk was debunked, comets were explained, and unicorn horns became too common, even before they were reclassified as narwhal tusks: wonders had to be rare, mysterious, and real. At the same time, such new objects joined the canon of wonders as monstrous births,\n\nrecuperated from the canon of horrors, and the louse, a marvel only under the microscope. Reassessing the meaning (and thus the emotional import) of an object or revealing a previously hidden characteristic could make it grounds for wonder. The passion and the objects mutually defined each other, a process in which neither remained static. In placing wonder and wonders at the center of our narrative, we have had to challenge the traditional historiography of science and philosophy in fundamental ways. Most obviously, we have let go of not only the usual periodization, which divorces the medieval from the early modern study of nature, but also the much more basic ideas of distinct stages, watersheds, new beginnings, and punctual or decisive change. These narrative conventions, imported into intellectual history from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century political historiography, only distort the nonlinear and nonprogressive cultural phenomena we describe. For the most part our story is not punctuated by clearly distinguished epistemes or turning points, but is instead undulatory, continuous, sometimes cyclical. It is not that the six hundred years we discuss saw no changes or that we are talking of the stasis of the longue durée. In our story, individuals change their minds, have remarkable experiences, and make extraordinary discoveries, which dramatically alter the known world. Social and intellectual communities and institutions appear and disappear or develop new allegiances and agendas over a decade or a generation. Since our study encompasses much of western Europe and spans a range of cultural environments, change was always happening somewhere: from the beginning of our period to the end, the canon of wonders was constantly shifting its contents and its meaning in innumerable ways. But change happened smoothly and continuously in its general outlines. The multiplicity of approaches in the interpretation of nature, the layering of cultural levels, the differences between national or linguistic traditions, the gap between the rear guard (usually) at the periphery and the avant-garde (usually) at the center —all acted to smooth out the watersheds and blur the borders 17\n\nWONDERS AND THE ORDER OF NATURE\n\nbetween epistemes that are often projected onto this more complicated historical reality. As a result, our readers must be willing to abandon conventional periodization and a strictly linear narrative. In order to follow the substantive and chronological contours of the history of wonder and wonders we have integrated both periods and topics usually kept asunder — collecting and romances, travel and court spectacle, medical practice and popular prophecy, natural philosophy and aesthetic theory. Despite these departures from historical convention, our story inter-\n\nweaves and intersects with many important and familiar narratives of high medieval and early modern European historiography: the rise of universities, the age of European exploration, the course of the Scientific Revolution, secularization, the rise of absolutism, and the like. Rather than rejecting or supplanting such narratives, we have used our sometimes unfamiliar material as seventeenth-century philosophers used marvels: to “break up our familiarities,” as Foucault put it in our epigraph, “and to regard otherwise the same things.’ We do not propose wonders as the newest key to early modern science and philosophy, nor do we offer our own story as an alternative grand narrative for the Scientific Revolution, as Frances Yates did for magical Hermeticism.\" But the history of science does look different when organized around ontology and affects rather than around disciplines and institutions. Our study is in some ways unusually broad — contextually, chronologically, and geographically — but we have set limits as to who and when. Our book focuses on wonder and wonders as an elite tradition, engaging the attention of princes, clerical administrators, preachers, teachers, court artists and storytellers, naturalists, and theologians. We have begun with the mid-twelfth century for two related reasons. First, the dramatic increase in the number of ancient sources available provided the base for\n\na rich ramification and elaboration of the ancient tradition of writing on wonders. Second, the coeval rise of cities and of royal and imperial bureaucracies, the creation of courts as centers of literary, artistic, and philosophical culture, the emergence of schools and, later, universities as centers of formal learning —all combined to create literate, wealthy, and powerful audiences for wonder and wonders. At the other terminus, we have taken our study well into the eighteenth century in order to trace and analyze the process by which wonder and wonders faded from prominence in elite circles as favored objects of contemplation and appreciation. How marvels fell from grace in European high culture has less to do with some triumph of rationality — whether celebrated as enlightenment or decried as disenchantment — than with a profound mutation in the selfdefinition of intellectuals. For them wonder and wonders became simply 18\n\nAT THE LIMIT\n\nvulgar, the very antithesis of what it meant to be an homme de lumieres, or for that matter a member of any elite.\n\nThis marked the end of the long history of wonder and wonders as cherished elements of European elite culture, and therefore also the one\n\nsharp rupture in our narrative. During the period from the twelfth through the late seventeenth century, wonder and wonders — far from being primarily an element of “popular” culture, much less a site of popular resistance to elite culture’? — were partly constitutive of what it meant\n\nto be a cultural elite in Europe. In the hands of medieval abbots and princes, natural wonders such as ostrich eggs, magnets, and carbuncles represented the wealth of their possessors and their power over the natural and the human world. In the hands of philosophers, theologians, and physicians, they were recondite objects of specialized knowledge that\n\ntranscended prosaic experience. In the hands of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century virtuosi and collectors, they became occasions for elaborate exercises in taste and connoisseurship. All of these groups separated themselves from the vulgar in their physical access to marvels, in their knowledge of the nature and properties of these marvels, and in their ability to distinguish things that were truly wonderful from things that were not. When marvels themselves became vulgar, an epoch had closed. In laying out this long, sinuous history of wonders, we have organized\n\nour book along only roughly chronological lines. Key themes such as the shaping role of court culture, the lure of the exotic, the practices of collecting, the forms of scientific experience, the unstable boundary between marvels and miracles, recur throughout. Chapter One discusses writing on extraordinary natural phenomena in the literature of travel and topography, chronicles, and encyclopedias, which, we argue, constituted the core tradition of medieval reflection on wonders. Chapter Two treats wonders as objects, both textual and material, and describes the way in which they were used for purposes ranging from religious meditation to court ritual, while Chapter Three turns to the culture of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century natural philosophy and its rejection of both wonder and wonders as an integral part of the study of the natural order. Chapter Four shows how various groups of intellectuals, especially court physicians, professors of medicine and natural history, apothecaries, and authors of texts in popular philosophy, rehabilitated wonders for both natural philosophical contemplation and empirical investigation. Chapter Five, on monstrous births, is our only extended case study. The pivot of the book’s argument, it spans the period from the late Middle Ages through the Enlightenment and rehearses the multiple meanings\n\nof wonders as religious portents, popular entertainment, philosophical 19\n\nWONDERS ANO THE ORDER OF NATURE\n\nchallenge, and aesthetic affront. Monsters elicited wonder at its most iridescent, linked sometimes to horror, sometimes to pleasure, and sometimes to repugnance. Chapter Six describes how the preternatural became a central element in the reform of natural history and natural philosophy in seventeenthcentury scientific societies, while Chapter Seven examines how the early modern Wunderkammern, in blurring the ancient opposition between art and nature, served as an inspiration for the union of these ontological categories in the natural philosophy of Bacon and Descartes. Chapter Eight charts the shifting relationships between the two cognitive passions of wonder and curiosity, showing how they briefly meshed into a psychology of scientific inquiry in the seventeenth century — given triumphant expression in the passage from Boyle with which we began this Introduction — only to drift rapidly apart thereafter. Chapter Nine, finally, recounts how wonder and wonders became vulgar, at once metaphysically implausible, politically suspect, and aesthetically distasteful. All of the chapters are the products of joint research, discussions, and writing, but Park had primary responsibility for Chapters One through Four, and Daston for Chapters Six through Nine. We wrote Chapter Five together. The enduring fascination exerted by wonders cries out for explanation. How did a miscellany of objects become and remain so emotionally charged? Wonders and wonder limned cognitive boundaries between the\n\nnatural and the unnatural and between the known and the unknown. They also set cultural boundaries between the domestic and the exotic and between the cultivated and the vulgar. All of these boundaries were electric, thrilling those who approached them with strong passions; to run up against any of these limits was necessarily to challenge the assumptions that ruled ordinary life. No one was ever indifferent to wonders and wonder. Neither the medieval and Renaissance princes who coveted them, nor the readers of romances and travelogues who dreamed with them, nor the Enlightenment philosophes who despised them could be neutral about wonders: markers of the outermost limits of what they knew, who they were, or what they might become.\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThe Topography of Wonder\n\nWhen high medieval European writers invoked wonders, what exactly did they have in mind? Gervase of Tilbury, an early thirteenth-century English noble and imperial counselor resident at Arles, was eager to explain. He devoted the third and longest section of his Otia imperialia, written\n\naround 1210 and dedicated to Emperor Otto IV, to what he called “the marvels of every province —not all of them, but something from each one” (fig. 1.1).! After some introductory remarks, he set out a catalogue of a hundred and twenty-nine such marvels, beginning with the magnet, an Indian stone with the mysterious property of attracting iron, and ending with a spring near Narbonne that changed place whenever something dirty was put into it. In between, he wrote of a garden planted by Vergil in Naples that contained an herb that restored sight to blind sheep; Veronica’s napkin, still imprinted with Christ’s likeness, in St. Peter’s; the portents at the death of Caesar; the sagacity of dolphins; a race of Egyptian\n\npeople twelve feet high with white arms and red feet, who metamorphosed into storks; the phoenix; dracs, who lived in the Rhone and lured women and children by taking the form of gold rings; and werewolves, whose sighting Gervase described as “a daily event in these parts.’ Gervase protested the truth of all these phenomena, noting he had tested or witnessed many of them himself. At first glance, this list appears incoherent. It included plants, animals,\n\nand minerals; specific events and exotic places; miracles and natural phenomena; the distant and the local; the threatening and the benign. Furthermore, Gervase had compiled his wonders from a wide range of sources. Many (the dolphins, the phoenix, the portents) came from classical texts, while others were obviously biblical or belonged to the capacious Christian corpus of wonder-working sites, images, and relics. Still others, like the werewolves and dracs, had their roots in Germanic, Celtic, or other local oral traditions. Yet for all their diversity, Gervase stressed the coherence of this catalogue of wonders, locating it in the emotion 21\n\nORDER OF-NAT NATURE 2RS AND THE OF | WONDERS\n\noo Y 7 _ 7 7 ay oo Ce” o — i a . 7 Ys oe | iy ob ee as , Lal Ra & pes ate oO — 7 Loo . a . _ . . 7 i io _ _ 2 oa L . 2 —e a- ai. y & _7.. _oe . ao | oCe 2coA.- ai.a..fee 7.- 2|.| aa. ~~ ee—oer a. i_.. — oe 2. _7| aecoe ..._ we 2 | oo Co_. oettpe teoY. _ oey —_.

Those things\n\nthat are newly created please naturally; those things that have happened recently are more marvelous if they are rare, less so if they are frequent. We embrace things we consider unheard of, first on account of the variation in the course of nature, at which we marvel [quem admiramur]; then on account\n\nof our ignorance of the cause, which is inscrutable to us; and finally on account of our customary experience, which we know differs from others’... From these conditions proceed both miracles [miracula] and marvels [mirabilia], since both culminate in wonder [admiratio].?\n\nIn this passage, Gervase summarized the principal commonplaces of the high medieval understanding of wonder. First, he traced the emotion to two roots: experience of the novel or unexpected, and ignorance of cause. Marvels were either rare phenomena, astounding by their unfamiliarity (for example, the phoenix of the Atlas Mountains, which immolated itself periodically only to rise again), or more common but puzzling, counterintuitive, or unexplained phenomena (for example, the attractive properties of the magnet or ghostly appearances of the dead). As a result, Gervase emphasized in his reference to “customary experience,” wonder was always relative to the beholder; what was novel to one person might be familiar to another, and what was mysterious to one might be causally transparent to someone better informed.’ For this reason, Gervase continued in a passage cribbed from Augustine, we do not find it marvelous that lime catches fire in cold water, because it forms part of our everyday experience, but if we were told that some stone from India behaved in exactly the same way, we would either dismiss the story as incredible or be “stupefied with wonder.’* Throughout this passage, finally, Gervase emphasized the tight links between wonder, pleasure, and the insatiable human appetite for the rare, the novel, and the strange. It is certainly for this reason that he placed wonders at the apex of a work designed ostensibly for the emperor’s entertainment and relaxation. Like his analysis of wonder, Gervase’s list of marvels was broadly typical of contemporary learned literature. It represented, if not a fixed canon of individual phenomena, then certainly a canon of the types of things that thirteenth-century readers would expect to find in such a list. This canon was not a medieval invention. Gervase’s wonders were for the most part the classic wonders of Greek and Roman paradoxography, a literary genre 23\n\nWONDERS AND THE ORDER OF NATURE\n\nthat had grown out of the Aristotelian project of compiling descriptive histories of natural phenomena and had coalesced in the third century B.C.E. in the form of catalogues of things that were surprising, inexplicable, or bizarre.*> The purpose of the original Greek texts is unclear, but they may have served as commonplace books for rhetoricians. In any case, paradoxographical material later made its way into Roman encyclopedic writing, including the works of the Pliny the Elder and Solinus, who were well known in the medieval Latin West.\n\nGervase of Tilbury’s account of the world’s wonders took the form of a catalogue made up of extremely brief and descriptive entries, with no attempt to relate them either spatially or chronologically or to analyze or explain them in any way. The wonders themselves were overwhelmingly topographical in nature; that is to say, they were linked to particular places (the “provinces” of Gervase’s subtitle) and often to particular topographical features, such as caves and springs, rocks and lakes. The magnet was indigenous to India, for example, and the phoenix to the Atlas Mountains, while there were mountains in Wales so wet that the land moved under travelers’ feet. Such wonders were, in other words, particular, localized, and concrete. Yet despite these similarities to ancient paradoxography, Gervase’s work differed from it in important ways. He introduced his discussion by analyzing the emotion of wonder: its association with novelty, its pleasurable nature, its causes, and its universal appeal. Even more striking, he did not simply repeat the canonical marvels he found in earlier writers —a signal feature of ancient paradoxography — but sought to supplement them with wonders of his own. Many of these came from personal experience, which explains the strong showing of the region around Arles.” These differences mark an important feature of the later medieval tradition of what we will call topographical wonder: its emphasis on verification through personal experience and oral report. Less a purely erudite tradition than its ancient forebear, it had more room for development and growth. Wonders of this sort were not confined to catalogues of mirabilia like Gervase’s but appeared in recognizable clusters in medieval works of many different sorts: encyclopedias (together with the related genres of bestiary, lapidary, and herbal), chronicles, topographical treatises, travel narratives, and the literature of romance. The variety of this literature reflects the growing medieval audience for wonders. In the early thirteenth century, when Gervase was writing, marvels were largely confined to Latin culture, with the important exception of vernacular romance.\n\nThe authors of this material were for the most part clerics, often in the , employ of princely patrons, secular and ecclesiastical. Gervase himself 24\n\nTHE TOPOGRAPHY OF WONDER\n\nclaimed to be writing for the emperor, having previously served as courtier and counselor to England’s Henry II, another European monarch with a taste for natural wonders. Henry was the dedicatee of another of the earliest Latin works to take up the topic, Gerald of Wales’s topography of Ireland, which its author presented to Archbishop Baldwin in 1188.° From the twelfth century on, marvels also figured prominently in vernacular romances. This signals a growing audience for wonders that included not only clerics and princes but also the knightly and eventually the bourgeois readers of that genre. By the middle of the fourteenth century, various earlier Latin books of marvels, including Gervase’s and Gerald’s, had been translated into the vernacular, and other writers had begun to produce original vernacular topographical books of wonders, culminating in the spectacularly popular Mandeville’s Travels.? Some of these, like Mandeville’s Travels and the book of Marco Polo, were in turn translated into Latin. Indeed, as a sign of the growing appetite for wonders, earlier\n\nbooks with no reference to wonders in their titles were renamed to underscore the marvels they contained. One example was Polo’s originally rather prosaically titled Devisament dou Monde (Description of the World), repackaged in Latin as Liber Milionis de magnis mirabilibus mundi (“Million’s” Book of the Great Wonders of the World); the author’s nickname\n\nreflected his reputation for exaggeration.'° This chapter and the one that follows focus on the diverse environments in which wonders, in all their myriad incarnations, were enthusiastically compiled, collated, analyzed, and multiplied in monasteries and convents, the households of urban lay readers, and the high and late medieval courts.\n\nMarvels on the Margins Like the ancient paradoxographers, medieval writers on topographical wonders depicted the margins of the world as a privileged place of novelty, variety, and exuberant natural transgression. In the circular mental map of medieval geography, the central territories — the Holy Land, Europe, and the Mediterranean — had their marvels, but they were far outstripped in this respect by the periphery: the territories and islands bathed by the great ocean thought to cover most of the globe. As the fourteenthcentury English monk Ranulph Higden put it in his world history, “At the farthest reaches of the world often occur new marvels and wonders, as though Nature plays with greater freedom secretly at the edges of the world than she does openly and nearer us in the middle of it.\" Gerald of Wales was of the same opinion: “Just as the countries of the East are remarkable and distinguished for certain prodigies [ostentis] peculiar and native to themselves, so the boundaries of the West also are made remark25\n\nWONDERS AND THE ORDER OF NATURE\n\nable by their own wonders of Nature [naturae miraculis]. For sometimes tired, as it were, of the true and the serious, [Nature] draws aside and goes away, and in these remote parts indulges herself in these shy and hidden excesses,” !?\n\nGerald and Ranulph both had Ireland in mind, but most other medieval writers agreed that the most wonderful wonders lay in the far South and East, in Africa and India. Richard of Holdingham’s great Hereford map, produced in England in the 1280s, illustrated the extraordinary fauna of these regions in vivid detail (fig. 1.2). Although these “marvels of the East,” as they are usually called by modern scholars, had a long and rich history reaching to Hellenistic times and beyond, medieval authors and mapmakers knew the tradition largely through a variety of later Roman writers, notably Pliny, Solinus, Augustine of Hippo, Isidore of Seville, and the authors of a large body of literature associated with the figure of Alexander the Great.!3 The Islamic world had its own well-developed tradition of paradoxography, also shaped by Greek sources, but its central texts were never translated into Latin, and it had relatively little influence in the West.'* Up to this point we have emphasized general characteristics of the high and late medieval literature of topography and travel, but the genre also shifted and changed over the course of the Middle Ages. The exotic Eastern races had not always elicited the enthusiastic and appreciative response found among Gervase and his contemporaries. Early medieval writers tended to follow the Alexander tradition, which reflected the imperialist aims of its hero by portraying the East as adversary and prey.\" The two most widely copied early medieval treatises on the eastern races, the Liber monstrorum and Tractatus monstrorum, both probably written in the eighth century, stressed the threatening nature of their material. The anonymous author of the first described his subject as the “three types of things on earth that provoke the greatest terror in the human race, monstrous human births, the horrible [horribilibus] and innumerable types of wild beasts, and the most terrible [dirissimis] kinds of serpents and vipers,” and he compared his task in writing to diving, terror-struck, into a dark sea full of monsters.'© The creatures in his catalogue included cannibals, harpies, crocodiles, boa constrictors, and enormous ants. One entry will suffice to give the flavor of this work: “There is a certain people of mixed nature who live on an island in the Red Sea. They are said to be able to speak in the tongues of all nations; in this way they astonish men who come from far away, by naming their acquaintances, so that they may surprise them and eat them raw.”””\n\nThis tone of suspicion, if not outright paranoia, also marked various 26\n\nTHE TOPOGRAPHY OF WONDER\n\nversions of the roughly contemporary Iractatus monstrorum, and the images\n\nin an eleventh-century manuscript of the treatise (fig. 1.3.1) showed beings that were at least barbaric and disturbing, if not outright dangerous.'8 In addition to its didactic uses — such beings were easily moralized by poets and sermonizers — this literature may have functioned as recreational reading in the monastic environment in which it circulated, as the number of illustrated manuscripts suggests. But its pleasures seem to have had less to do with wonder as Gervase would later come to understand it,\n\nan emotion rooted in the appreciation of novelty and difference, than with reading of foreign dangers in the safety and familiarity of home. Traces of this earlier attitude also shaped Gerald of Wales’s Topographia Hibernie, composed for Henry II (whom Gerald called “our western Alexander”)\" shortly after the king sent him to Ireland in 1185 as part of the conquest of that island. Gerald emphasized Ireland’s natural marvels: he used the language of wonder appreciatively and specifically to refer to its lack of poisonous reptiles, for example, its petrifying wells, and its dramatic tides. But he was far more severe about its inhabitants,\n\nwhom he described as barbarians, “adulterous, incestuous, unlawfully conceived and born, outside the law, and shamefully abusing nature herself in spiteful and horrible practices,” a fact that explained the unusual number of animal-human hybrids and defective births.*? When nature acted “against her own laws,” as Gerald put it, she produced wonders in a land worthy of conquest, whereas when the Irish transgressed the moral order, they produced horrors, signs of the depravity that justified their dispossession.”!\n\nGerald’s juxtaposition of wonder and horror marks his book as transitional in the genre of medieval topographical writing, portraying the exotic as at times fascinating and at times opaque and dangerous, to be dominated or kept at arm’s length. Gerald was also the earliest writer to inject the element of contemporary experience into this tradition: unlike the earlier treatises on monsters, which were purely literary compilations, his Topographia bristled with personal observations of flora and fauna, criticisms of the blunders of Bede and Solinus, and invocations of the testi-\n\nmony of reliable men.’? The travel literature of the next two centuries shared this emphasis (sometimes more rhetorical than real) on eyewitness experience, but as time went on its authors increasingly characterized the margins of the globe as unambiguously “wonderful,” using language even more extravagant than that of Gervase. From this point on, it is possible to talk without anachronism about the “marvels of the East.” This new attitude coincided with the great age of eastern travel and\n\nthe opening of trade routes facilitated by the Mongol peace.

Partly in response to a growing appetite for marvels on the part of their compatriots, many of these travelers produced descriptions of their experiences.”? For example, Pope Innocent IV had sent the Franciscan John of Pian di Carpini as emissary to the Tartars in 1245. On his return, according to his fellow Franciscan and Italian chronicler Salimbene, he “had written a big book about the deeds of the Tartars and other wonders of the world, and when people tired him with questions on the subject, he had it read out loud, as I myself heard and saw on several occasions. ... The friars read his book in his presence, and he interpreted and explained whatever seemed unclear.’** The relations produced by these travelers, unlike Gerald’s Topographia Hibernie, did not reflect a straightforward imperialist program; the failure of successive waves of Christian Crusaders to expand and consolidate even their relatively modest territorial conquests in the Holy Land had scotched any serious European designs on the lands of India and beyond. Rather, these works expressed more limited aspirations: conversion of military and diplomatic alliances with the Mongols or Tartars, personal profit, or simple adventure. It is as if the failure of the early Crusading movement, together with Europeans’ recognition of their own economic\n\nand technological inferiority, freed them to see the East not just as a reservoir of potential religious and military adversaries, but as a figure of aspiration and desire. Exotic, fertile, beautiful, and fabulously wealthy, it shaped their imaginations through the gems, precious metals, spices, and luxury textiles that made their way onto the western market in increasing volume thanks to the efforts of Mongol, Arab, and Italian traders. Thus the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who had made two extended Asian voyages in the second half of the thirteenth century, stressed the natural endowments of the lands he visited. Writing about the Indian Kingdom of Quilon, for example, he effused: The country produces a diversity of beasts different [devisees] from those of all\n\nthe rest of the world. There are black lions with no other visible colour or mark. There are parrots of many kinds. Some are entirely white — as white as snow — with feet and beaks of scarlet. Others are scarlet and blue — there is no\n\nlovelier sight than these in the world. And there are some very tiny ones, which are also objects of great beauty. Then there are peacocks of another sort than ours and much bigger and handsomer, and hens too that are unlike ours. What more need I say? Everything there is different from what it is with 32\n\nTHE TOPOGRAPHY OF WONDER\n\nus and excels both in size and beauty. They have no fruit the same as ours, no beast, no bird.*°\n\nWhat was the source of this extravagant and aestheticizing language that allowed Marco Polo and other topographical and travel writers to conceive and to articulate a new and more positive attitude toward the East? The answer is suggested by the circumstances under which Polo’s narrative was composed. In fact, Polo was its author in only a dilute sense: while a prisoner of war in Genoa in 1298, he had told his story to a fellow detainee and writer of romances, Rustichello of Pisa, who wrote it up in French, embellishing it with many of the chivalric formulas developed in his earlier work.2© That is, the medieval rhetoric of the marvelous was\n\nfirst elaborated in the twelfth- and thirteenth-century literature of romance — in its rhapsodic descriptions of Eastern luxuries, its emphasis on quest and adventure, its exploitation of the unexpected, its taste for exotic settings, its reliance on magical natural objects, its constant invocation of wonder and wonders, described in terms of diversity, and its association of those wonders with wealth and power.’’? Compare Polo’s prologue, which touted the “very great marvels and great diversity [ grandismes mervoilles et les grant diversités]” in his book with the opening of the\n\nromance Cleomades by Rustichello’s contemporary Adenet le Roi: “I have begun yet another book, one that is very marvelous and varied [divers]... The tale is of great worth and most pleasing to hear. It is so varied and marvelous that I believe that no one ever heard one so unusual [diverse] as this.”’8 Gerald of Wales and Gervase of Tilbury had made considerable use of romance associations in their topographies, but it was only after Rustichello’s collaboration with Marco Polo that the romantic rhetoric of\n\nwonder became an established feature of contemporary exotic travel nar-\n\nratives. Absent from the mid-thirteenth century accounts of the friars William of Rubruck and John of Pian di Carpini, this rhetoric informed the narratives attributed to Odoric of Pordenone (c. 1330), Jordan of Sévérac (c. 1330), and above all John Mandeville (c. 1357), where it was carried to unprecedented heights.’ As Marco Polo’s ecstatic description of the natural wonders of Quilon indicates, late-thirteenth-century authors portrayed difference — in its manifold senses of diversity, novelty, unfamiliarity, and unlikeness —as a highly positive quality: the source of pleasure and delight. In the words of the author of Mandeville’s Travels, “many men have a great liking to hear speak of strange things of diverse countries.’*° European observers did not accept everything Eastern as worthy of praise. They found much to blame, especially in the idolatry and, occasionally, the alleged cannibalism of the 33\n\nWONDERS AND THE ORDER OF NATURE\n\npeoples they described.*'! Nonetheless, their great interest in the strange races and species of Asia and Africa was not primarily an expression of anxiety, as a number of scholars have recently argued,*? and an obsessive attempt to objectify and exorcise pervasive fears of disorder, ignorance, dispossession, or sin. European authors certainly used the exotic races to test and explore fundamental boundaries in their own culture — between male and female, wild and civilized, human and animal —as is clear from the prominence in travel narratives of beings such as centaurs, satyrs, hermaphrodites, and cross-dressers. But these did not appear as scandalous or pathological, as seriously challenging European values or establishing a rival norm. They were too remote and strange to present a real alterna-\n\ntive and thus a conceptual or political threat.*? At their most transgressive, they served to satirize courtly and aristocratic culture or to figure a fantasy realm of freedom from the sexual restrictions and pervasive poverty of European culture. The wonders of the East had overwhelmingly positive associations; liberating precisely on account of their geographical marginality — unlike, say, the real and proximate difference represented by a resident Jewish population — they were viewed with a relatively benign and tolerant eye.** This embracing of exoticism and variety in travel and topographical\n\nwriting was strongly reinforced by the influence of the first-century Roman writer Pliny the Elder, whose massive Natural History in thirtyseven books served as the principal source from which medieval writers took, either directly or indirectly, much of their own material.** Like Marco Polo and his fellows, Pliny loved mirabilia: exotic species, strange topographical features, and unlikely and counterintuitive phenomena.*® He underscored the wonderfulness of exotic eastern peoples, like the Psilli, whose bodies secreted a poison deadly to snakes, or the Indian Sciopodes, each with a single enormous foot. “These and similar varieties of the human race have been made by the ingenuity of Nature as toys for herself and marvels [miracula] for us,” he wrote. “And indeed who could possibly recount the various things she does every day and almost every hour? Let it suffice for the disclosure of her power to have included whole races of mankind among her marvels.’?” Like the medieval romances and travel books, Pliny’s work was permeated by an aesthetic and a sensibility that stressed the variety and diversity of nature.*®\n\nIn thirteenth- and fourteenth-century topographical literature, this sensibility found expression in the topos of the relativity of the marvelous.\n\nJames of Vitry, bishop of Acre in the thirteenth century, sketched this theme in his history of the East:\n\n34\n\nTHE TOPOGRAPHY OF WONDER\n\n| We know that all the works of God are marvelous [mirabilia}, although those who are accustomed to look on them often are not moved by wonder [admiratione]. For perhaps the cyclops, who all have one eye, marvel as much at those who have two eyes as we marvel at them, or at others with three eyes. Just as we consider the pygmies dwarfs, so they would judge us giants, if they\n\nsaw one of us among them.... We consider the black Ethiopians ugly, but among them, the blackest is judged the most beautiful. We do not marvel at many things in our lands that the peoples of the East, if they heard of them, either would not believe or would consider to be marvels.2?\n\nAmong the many natural wonders to which westerners were accustomed, James cited the absence of snakes in Ireland, the midnight sun of Thule (or Iceland), fiery Mt. Etna in Sicily, men with tails in Britain, women with huge goiters in the Burgundian Alps, and broadly familiar phenomena like congenital lepers, the properties of quicksilver, and the loyalty of dogs.\n\nOther authors made the same point, comparing Europe’s elusive barnacle geese (thought to grow on trees) to the Scythian lambs of Mongolia. In the words of the Franciscan Odoric of Pordenone, who traveled to Asia in 1314, Another very marvelous thing can be said, that I did not see but heard from persons worthy of credit. For it is said that in the great kingdom of Candelis there are Mountains called the Capei mountains. It is said that very large gourds grow there, which open when they are ripe, and inside is found a little animal, like a small lamb.... And although this may perhaps seem incredible, nonetheless, it can be true, just as it is true that in Ireland are trees that produce birds.*°\n\nThe same story appeared in many versions of Mandeville’s Travels, where it inspired a charming illustration — an emblem of the relativity of marvels — in the great early fifteenth-century Livre des merveilles du monde owned by the Duke of Berry (fig. 1.4.2).*! This showed representatives of Europe and Asia (identified primarily by their headgear) exchanging a branch laden with barnacle geese for a Scythian lamb, in an act of apparent equality. The empathy involved in this representation, which encouraged readers to place themselves in the minds of exotic people and to imagine their reactions, differentiated the later medieval literature of marvels from the\n\nearlier books of monsters, which presented the inhabitants of the East as barbarians or enemies to be conquered and feared. This change in attitude grew out of shifting circumstances, as western Europeans found them35\n\n= / “a ee = 6S AND WONDERS } THE ORDER O\n\nATURE\n\n_oo. =. :. momcons |. |.a_ee> a -.. 27 .a.Pe |.::SA se ; aa. we | :oo ai |:|\n\n. oO TD LD Do 2Le , Ci LCL a7he Loo UD | _|FF |, LLLD, _as;>ac WeLe ey LF ie |).J_2. —22alyoee, aie Le -CO Lf Co iy - oo 7,\n\net AE ! 7of -,ZUost OC 7~~ op cee |ign sii a sid :— Ta| 7md i.22 LC — ke — aa ge ed ’ i} eA 27:2ia Uo Lowe Boye yy oy Co LO TA diel 7a7iy ok 2CM Qe aLC a,Lee ZO 7EV .

These schools prepared their students for the practical and pastoral activities of spiritual outreach for which the orders of friars had recently been founded: converting and disciplining heretics, instructing the laity, reforming morals, and especially, preaching. The encyclopedias thus functioned as textbooks\n\nfor those whose task was to communicate the biblical message in the wider world.*3\n\nThe authors of these works were explicit about their aims, which they described with frequent references to Augustine. But they differed from one another in the aspects of Augustine’s program they chose to stress. Bartholomaeus Anglicus specifically emphasized exegesis; he wrote that his work was to help its audience to understand the “enigmas of scripture, which have been transmitted and veiled by the holy spirit in the symbols and figures of the properties of natural and artificial things.” For this reason, he included only those phenomena (many of which were relatively commonplace) mentioned in the Bible and its glosses ..* Thomas of Cantimpré and Vincent of Beauvais cast their nets more broadly, emphasizing Augustine’s more general point: the Christian's duty to wonder at creation and, by extension, at its Creator. As a result, they included many more phenomena than Bartholomaeus, describing these with frequent and explicit references to wonder. Of the “sea monsters” in his sixth book, for example, Thomas wrote: “they have been given by the omnipotent God to the wonder of the globe. For in this sense they appear very wonderful, since they are rarely offered to the sight of men. In truth it can be said, that God hardly acted so marvelously in any other things under heaven, except human nature, in which the imprint of the Trinity is to be seen. For what under heaven can appear more wonderful than the whale?” Vincent explained why he had chosen the mirror as his governing metaphor: “mirror refers to almost everything worthy of contemplation [speculationis], that is of wonder [admirationis] or imitation.”** His Speculum naturale was truly Plinian in scope, with close to four thousand chapters divided into thirty-two books, though still organized on biblical principles according to the order of the six days of creation. Vincent invoked wonder at every opportunity, not only in his accounts of standard exotic mirabilia, but also in his rhapsodic descriptions of more commonplace things. He exclaimed over the extraordinary range in the\n\n44\n\nTHE TOPOGRAPHY OF WONDER\n\nsize of living things, from the elephant to the gnat or the tiger to the turtle (“we wonder at the greatness of the one, the smallness of the other”); the remarkable generation of like by like; the extraordinary variety and beauty of the colors of flowers and gems.*’ Citing Augustine in Book XXI of De civitate Dei, he presented the created world as a spectacle of wonders, engineered for human pleasure and delight.** In emphasizing the wonderfulness of all creation, Vincent reflected Augustine’s elaboration of wonder as a religious emotion. His rhapsodic tone, however, as well as his tendency to reserve his most ringing prose for exotica and other rarities, betrays the influence of the medieval topographical tradition. Augustine’s wonder, introduced and framed in terms of God’s power to subject the unfaithful to eternal torture, was appreciative but tinged with fear. Vincent’s wonder, in contrast, was largely informed by pleasure, like that of Marco Polo, Odoric, or Mandeville. Despite the non-Augustinian tone of some of their entries, the thirteenth-century encyclopedias were certainly used for Augustinian ends. Vincent’s Speculum appeared in the 1307 catalogue of the library of the Dominican convent at Dijon, in the same section as biblical concordances, commentaries, and exegetical works, while the encyclopedias of Thomas and Bartholomaeus circulated in abridged manuscript versions for pulpit\n\nuse.°? Their contents, supplemented by material from Solinus, Pliny, Gervase of Tilbury, and the bestiary literature, appeared in compendia for preachers like the Gesta Romanorum. Compiled in the early fourteenth century for the use of English Franciscans, this included chapters on the basilisk, Armenian dragons, wonder-working springs in Sicily, and the exotic human races. Each of these received a moralized Christian meaning: the dog-headed Cynocephali signified ascetic preachers in hair shirts, for example, while the enormous ears of the Scythians stood for willing-\n\nness to hear the word of God. Interest in this material was not confined to clerics. Vincent’s elephantine encyclopedia remained untranslated, but over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the works of Thomas and, especially, Bartholomaeus Anglicus found a broader, lay audience in new vernacular versions.®' Bartholomaeus’ work underwent a shift as it moved into the lay world. In his preface the author had emphasized only the religious and exegetical uses of his book. The prologues added by vernacular translators eliminated these passages entirely, substituting for them a far broader portrayal of the De proprietatibus as a general encyclopedia —in the words of its French translator, Jean Corbechon, “a general summa containing all\n\nthings.” This shift also appeared in the illustrations that accompanied the most lavish French manuscripts, commissioned by princely patrons; 45\n\n87yLiCU - 82ooaA7oo, aGyTU ,.' 1 7Fy, .2 ieLD —., _7a... .oe...ea of as ya aa|oa a aeaUp oe > ae 4 oo 8) oo cc a 2 a _ ae a a oo a a a DD — oC a. lo.
