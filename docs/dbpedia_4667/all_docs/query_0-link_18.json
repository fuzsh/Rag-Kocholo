        "text": "The Charles Ives Music Festival (CIMF) at WCYO continues its 2022 season of performances with “Folksape,” a chamber music concert featuring CIMF violinist and Easton native, Chelsea Starbuck Smith, and pianist Adam Rothenberg.\n\nThe concert begins at 4 p.m. on April 3 at Lounsbury House, 316 Main St. in Ridgefield, Conn. The program will include pieces by Copland, Bernstein, Ravel, Shostakovich, Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, Kala Ramnath and Mason Bates.\n\nThe mission of the CIMF is to honor the legacy of composer Charles Ives by bringing American music to the Fairfield County area. CIMF concerts regularly feature dynamic and unique artists performing the works of Ives, the music of 20th- and 21st-century American composers, and music that transcends the traditional boundaries of classical music to incorporate other musical styles and genres.\n\nCIMF also provides interactive educational events centered around the exploration of chamber music for both children and adults in our community, and will be providing a workshop earlier in the day on April 3 to musicians in the Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra.\n\nTickets are $20 for adults and $10 for seniors and students, and may be purchased in advance at https://charlesivesmusicfestival.org/concerts/ or by cash or check at the door."
