There are areas of the city where you can find shops you wouldn't expect, and then there are historical places like the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, where just a visit to admire it \"is worth the price of admission\".

While some iconic names like Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Tod‚Äôs are focusing on the Venice Biennale, showcasing their connections with contemporary art, Milan remains a vibrant hub for design innovation. Spring 2024 in Italy presents a fascinating dilemma for luxury brands, balancing the expansion of their lifestyle and home offerings with the cultivation of their elitist image through art collaborations. Brands like Herm√®s, Balenciaga, Gucci, and Versace are among the many names showcasing their design prowess, reaffirming Milan's status as a magnet for luxury creativity. As the industry evolves, it's clear that luxury brands are not only defining fashion but also shaping the aesthetic landscape of our living spaces, offering a glimpse into a world where artistry meets elegance. #Luxury #Design #Lifestyle Luxury on show at Milan Design Week - Luxus Plus (luxus-plus.com) https://lnkd.in/dcZU-Z6i\n\nWelcome to Demie L‚Äôatelier The Luxury Design and Marketing Studio. In the year 2024, Demie L'atelier was founded as a haven where artistry embraces the beauty of incompleteness, a testament to the belief that true luxury lies in the art of exclusivity. Our name, Demie, evokes the allure of half-finished art, a canvas waiting to unfold, while L'atelier, the workshop, breathes life into dreams. We specialise in luxury design and marketing, curating experiences for discerning souls drawn to high-end fashion, real estate, fine dining, spa sanctuaries, and more. In our design tapestry, luxury is not just a label; it's a tailored experience. We form brands for those who revel in high-end elegance ‚Äî from Fashion Icons and Luxury Real Estate Visionaries to Culinary Maestros and those crafting moments of grandeur at Exclusive Events. Imagine a tableau bathed in the hues of minimalism, contemporary aesthetics, and the opulence of true luxury. At Demie L'atelier, our strokes are deliberate, each design telling a story of sophistication and elegance that transcends the ordinary. #digitalmarketing #studio #marketing #french #branding #luxury #digitalproducts #launching\n\nAt LEART, luxury isn't just about an item's appearance‚Äîit's an emotion, an experience, a promise of unparalleled quality. üåüüíé From our design philosophy to the handpicked materials, from the craftsmanship to the after-sales service, we redefine luxury at every step. Each piece tells a story, and this narrative, combined with our attention to detail, makes our creations not just items but treasures. Embrace a holistic luxury experience with LEART, where every touch, every look, and every moment is special. üé®üîç Experience luxury like never before. Step into the world of LEART‚Äîlink in bio. Hashtags: #RedefiningLuxury #BeyondAesthetics #HolisticExperience #LEARTLuxury #MoreThanLooks #LuxuryNarrative #DesignPhilosophy #StoryBehindEveryPiece #PromiseOfQuality #LuxuryEmotion #TreasuredCreations #QualityOverEverything #ExperienceLEART #TrueLuxury #HandpickedExcellence #NarrativeDesign #LuxuryFeel\n\nThe value of ostentation can be overstated, argues sought-after Brazilian architect and designer, Arthur Guimar√£es. Indeed, for many wealthy individuals, personalisation has emerged as a counterpoint to the prevailing culture of flamboyance and commodification, he states. ‚ÄúIn an age where luxury has been commodified and flaunted on digital platforms, true connoisseurs of elegance seek solace in the understated, the timeless, and the exquisite,‚Äù the S√£o Paulo-based designer explains. For this more discerning class of wealthy buyer, the habit of customising luxury products has much more to do with a private appreciation for qualities such as ‚Äúartistry‚Äù, ‚Äúcraftsmanship‚Äù and ‚Äúattention to detail‚Äù than it does with a desire for public display, he believes. Consider the recent refit Guimar√£es completed of a Gulfstream G650 jet, replete with custom-made fabrics from Milan-based Loro Piana Interiors and made-to-measure tableware. Do not expect to find any images on Instagram: the UK banker who owns the jet cherishes his privacy ‚Äúwith an almost reverential fervour‚Äù. #luxury #personalization #loropiana #interiors #jet #wealth #experience #fashion #lvmh #yacht\n\nIn case you missed it... üòâ We have taken huge strides this year in our design capabilities.
