        "text": "Press\n\nAugust 24, 2010 Release - \"Hit the Road\"\n\nRural Rhythm Records is proud to announce the August 24, 2010 album release, “HIT THE ROAD” by Kentucky bluegrass music veterans, The Bartley Brothers. The first single is the title track from this exciting new album and is already out to bluegrass radio via the label’s “Fresh Cuts & Key Tracks” radio sampler. \"HIT THE ROAD’ really showcases the bands tight Vocals, Rock Solid Instrumentation and song writing abilities and is sure to propel them to top of the charts,\" said Radio Host, Charlie Hall (WCYO FM).\n\nRick and Shayne Bartley have begun a new chapter in their careers and are now fronting their own band joined by Jayd Raines (formerly with Marty Raybon) and Josh Hymer (formerly with Ernie Thacker and Coal Town). The Bartley Brothers have developed a traditional sound that is radio friendly and will set them apart from other bluegrass groups by utilizing their beautifully blended brother harmonies. \"There's nothing like sibling harmony, and Rick and Shayne Bartley have it in spades. Rick is a mighty talented singer/songwriter and the band they have assembled is top notch.\" - John Lawlass, The BluegrassBlog.\n\nIn addition to their powerful harmonies and masterful instrumental work on the album, Rick Bartley has pulled out all the stops to bring bluegrass fans 8 new original songs from home and real life which has been his songwriting trademark for years. Such songs as: “Blue Side of the Blueridge” which was the single and title track for Junior Sisk’s hit album and “I’M A HOBO” recorded on the recent J. D. Crowe & The New South album. Quality songwriting surely runs in the family. Lou Reid has recorded “My Whole Word in His Hands” (from his #1 album \"TIME\") and was co-written by Shayne Bartley.\n\nKevin Kerfoot, Publisher and Editor of BMP, has high marks for the new album saying, “Veteran bluegrass performers Rick and Shayne Bartley’s decision to hit the road as a duet is great news for lovers of original traditional bluegrass done right. The title track and first single of their debut CD is a catchy barn burner full of great banjo, mandolin and fiddle breaks. 'Loneliness Moved In' is another example showcasing their great brother harmonies and expert pickin’ and singin’. I’m looking forward to hearing much more bluegrass from The Bartley Brothers!”\n\n“The Bartley Brothers are surely no strangers to the bluegrass world. With there joined talents this project is nothing less than I would expect” said fellow label-mate Rickey Wasson.\n\n###\n\nRead More"
