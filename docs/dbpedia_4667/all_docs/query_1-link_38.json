        "text": "Shawn Lane releases New EP \"Family & Friends\"\n\nMountain Rest, SC (October 8, 2021) ~ Shawn Lane of supergroup Blue Highway is releasing a much anticipated solo album called \"Shawn Lane ~ Family & Friends\" on Friday, October 8, 2021.\n\nThe seven-song EP is the third solo release for Lane, and features acclaimed musicians and songwriters like GRAMMY Award winners Barry Bales and Ronnie Bowman, along with cherished and talented family members like Shawn's brother Chad and sons Grayson and Garrett Lane. Songwriters Gerald Ellenburg and Richard Bennett add co-writes to the project, while Clay Hess, Gaven Largent, and Patton Wages shine as contributing instrumentalists.\n\nThe release is Shawn's first EP, with his two prior album releases being \"Mountain Songs\" released in 2014, and \"All for Today\" which was named one of the Top Ten Bluegrass Albums of the Year by CMT in 2003.\n\nSoaring harmony characterizes the project's seven strong tracks which were all written or co-written by Shawn Lane, with the exception of \"I'll Wear a White Robe,\" a classic hymn from the 1930's penned by legendary 2008 Southern Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame inductee, Luther G. Presley. Lane penned the powerful lead track \"I Met the Man,\" as well as the toe-tapping \"Footsteps Falling.\" ACM, CMA, and GRAMMY Award-winning songwriter Ronnie Bowman joined the gifted Lane in penning the second track \"One More.\" Fifteen-time GRAMMY Award winner Barry Bales joined Lane in writing the project's third track, a heartfelt tribute to small-town America, \"American Factory Town.\" \"I'll Wear a White Robe\" and \"Footsteps Falling\" follow as tracks four and five. The gifted Gerald Ellenburg joined Lane in penning track six, the touching \"New Days,\" which shines as a gem on the project, featuring just Shawn and his guitar. Lane's duet partner Richard Bennett co-wrote the final track on the project, lucky number seven, \"Free as the Wind,\" an uplifting song worthy of a sunny Sunday afternoon drive with the windows down and the volume turned up high as the sky.\n\nTwo singles released ahead of the project, \"I Met the Man\" and \"One More.\" \"I Met the Man\" released in May 2018, and relayed the powerful true story of Shawn's dad coming back after 17 days in a coma with a miraculous story to tell. The song soared high, spending seven weeks at #1 and 28 weeks in the Top Ten of the Bluegrass Today Gospel Chart. \"One More\" was the second single released, and it also climbed to top the Bluegrass Today Chart at #1 in November 2020.\n\nOf the deeply personal song \"I Met the Man,\" Shawn wrote:\n\n\" 'I Met the Man' is a song I wrote about what my dad said after not being able to talk for four months following his stroke in 2016. His story has changed many lives, including mine. Since it's not possible for everyone to hear the story directly from him, I feel like it's my duty to relay a small part of his story through this song. It is a duty that I'm honored to have.\"\n\nOf the song \"One More,\" Shawn shared:\n\n\"One common thread we all share in this journey of life that we’re on is that we will be knocked down to the ground several times, by several different things. When that happens, we have two choices: either to stay down, or to get back up. This song is about getting back up, no matter how hard it may seem. With God's help, you can, and it'll sure feel good when you do. I was proud to get the opportunity to write “One More” with one of my best friends, Ronnie Bowman. I hope this song helps someone who may be down to get back up again.\"\n\nShawn Lane is a three-time GRAMMY Nominee and 28-time IBMA Award winner with Blue Highway. As explosive on fiddle as he is on mandolin and guitar, Lane is a heralded instrumentalist, vocalist, and songwriter. Shawn was nominated as 2015 IBMA Songwriter of the Year, and has written multiple #1 hits for the 26-year strong supergroup he co-founded, Blue Highway. Notably, four of his songs have been nominated as IBMA Song of the Year, and Lane also penned his first solo single “I Met the Man,” which topped the Bluegrass Today Gospel Chart at #1 for 7 weeks and spent 28 weeks in the chart's Top 10 in 2018.\n\n\"Shawn Lane ~ Family & Friends\" is available for purchase on Shawn's website, ShawnLaneMusic.com, in both CD and Digital formats.\n\n☆ Songs from the album are also available to Radio Programmers via Airplay Direct.\n\n☆ Video footage of a Live performance of one of the tracks, \"I'll Wear a White Robe,\" is here.\n\n☆ For more information about Shawn Lane, including full Bio, Videos, Music Store, Digital Downloads, and more, please visit ShawnLaneMusic.com.\n\n☆ For full details about the new release, please visit ShawnLaneMusic.com/Family-Friends.\n\n###\n\nPress Release courtesy of: Sherri George\n\nWALHALLA, SC (July 30, 2020) -- Shawn Lane of supergroup Blue Highway is releasing a solo single called \"One More\" on Friday, July 31. The song penned by Shawn Lane and Ronnie Bowman is Shawn's third single from his upcoming album on Cat Town Music, \"Shawn Lane: Family & Friends.\"\n\nThe new single features Shawn on guitar and lead vocals, sons Grayson and Garrett Lane on harmony vocals, Gaven Largent on Dobro, and GRAMMY Award winner Barry Bales on bass.\n\nOf the single, Shawn writes:\n\n\"One common thread we all share in this journey of life that we’re on is that we will be knocked down to the ground several times, by several different things.

As explosive on fiddle as he is on mandolin and guitar, Lane is a heralded instrumentalist, vocalist, and songwriter. Shawn was nominated as 2015 IBMA Songwriter of the Year, and has written multiple #1 hits for the 25-year strong supergroup he co-founded, Blue Highway. Notably, he also penned his first solo single “I Met the Man,” which topped the Bluegrass Today Gospel Chart at #1 for 7 weeks and spent 28 weeks in the chart's Top 10 in 2018.\n\nThe new single will premiere on radio on Friday, July 31, including on Bluegrass Junction with Kyle Cantrell, airing on Sirius XM channel 62 @ 7:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. ET.\n\n\"One More\" is available for purchase at a special price exclusively on Shawn's website under Digital Downloads.\n\nThe single is available to Radio Programmers via Airplay Direct.\n\n###\n\nPress Release courtesy of Sherri George.\n\nBRISTOL, VA (February 15, 2019) -- Shawn Lane has turned heads and garnered cheers since last Summer with a single relaying the true story and miracle of his dad coming back from 17 days in a coma with a supernatural story to tell. The song driven by Lane's songwriting and vocals has been a force on the Bluegrass Today Gospel Chart.\n\nThe powerful \"I Met the Man\" exploded into the Top 10 only two weeks after its release on May 15, topped the chart at #1 by June 15, and shined brightly in the #1 spot for 7 weeks. On a chart known for its continual updated rotation of songs, the staying power of the truth-driven song to hold strong for 28 weeks in the Top 10 has been almost miraculous.\n\nThe song dropped ahead of Lane's third solo album scheduled to release in 2019 called Shawn Lane: Family & Friends. Vocalists and instrumentalists will range from his gifted sons Grayson and Garrett, to Grammy-winning AKUS bass player and long-time friend Barry Bales, to Shawn's beautiful wife Gracie whose angelic vocals and Facebook video posts opened doors to unexpected skyrocketing exposure via social media for the Lane family.\n\nIn the midst of producing his Family & Friends album, Lane is about to drop another dynamic project with a fellow respected musician, the former J.D. Crowe lead vocalist and guitarist, and current Flashback band member Richard Bennett.\n\nRichard is a respected guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter who began his musical journey at the young age of seven. By age 15, the East Tennessee native was touring with former Flatt & Scruggs fiddle player Benny Sims. Gigs at Dollywood followed, with his big break coming in the 1990's as he joined the legendary J.D. Crowe & The New South. Bennett appeared on Crowe's 1995 Grammy nominated album, \"Flashback,\" and went on to tour with greats like Bobby Osbourne and Mike Auldridge. Richard also released several solo and trio albums on Lonesome Day and Pinecastle Records. His projects have garnered radio airplay across the musical genres of Bluegrass, Folk and Americana.\n\nLane is a three-time Grammy nominee and 28-time IBMA Award winner with Blue Highway. Heralded as a vocalist and instrumentalist, Lane is explosive on fiddle, mandolin, and guitar. Shawn is also a respected songwriter, and was nominated as 2015 IBMA Songwriter of the Year, penning such iconic songs as The Game, Sycamore Hollow, and Tears Fell on Missouri. Lane played in the bands of both Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder and Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver prior to becoming a founding member of Blue Highway in 1994.\n\nThe duo of Shawn Lane & Richard Bennett will debut this Sunday, February 17, at the Boston Bluegrass Union's heralded Joe Val Festival at the Sheraton Framingham on the outskirts of Boston. The duo will grace the festival's Main Stage on Sunday morning at 10:00 AM.\n\nThe duo will also release an EP album in early 2019 on Bonfire Records called \"Land and Harbor.\"\n\nShawn and Richard have been co-writing together for a couple of years. A few unique songs seemed to have a natural duo feel, so the two decided to spread their musical wings with a duo project showcasing their songwriting, instrumentals, and vocal chops. The gifted musicians will both play guitar on the five-song EP, with Gaven Largent of Dailey & Vincent adding his dynamic touch on Dobro, and Lane adding a soulful fiddle to one track.\n\nTheir sound has a slightly more folk and jam feel than the music Shawn and Richard release with their respective primary bands. Richard currently helps drive the traditional yet fresh sound of the J.D. Crowe & the New South reunion band, Flashback, while Shawn shines in the legendary multi-award winning supergroup he co-founded, Blue Highway.\n\n\"Shady Grove\" will be the first single dropping this Spring from the duo's new EP. Friends and fans can watch for the single's debut on radio, with the song and duo's Live performance debut this Sunday at Joe Val in Framingham, MA.\n\n\"We're really excited to just go out and have fun with this,\" said Shawn Lane.\n\n\"Always love appearing at Joe Val, and we're really looking forward to this Sunday's duo debut show,\" said Richard Bennett.\n\nFor more info on Richard Bennett, please go to www.FBBand.com/member-bios\n\nFor more info on Shawn Lane, please go to www.ShawnLaneMusic.com and www.BlueHighwayBand.com.\n\nFor more info on the 2019 Joe Val Festival, please go to www.BBU.org/events/joe-val-festival/\n\n###\n\nPress Release courtesy of Sherri George\n\nRED RIVER, NM (September 14, 2018) -- Shawn Lane will headline the 44th Annual Southwest Pickers Festival in the beautiful resort town of Red River, NM, on Friday-Sunday, September 14-16, 2018.\n\nShawn will roll into Red River with his beautiful and talented family to perform three shows and host two workshops during this weekend's event at Brandenburg Park.

The song released on his CatTown Music label ahead of his forthcoming third solo album, Shawn Lane: Family & Friends, which will shimmer with sparkling family harmony and appearances by good friends like GRAMMY-winning Barry Bales of Alison Krauss & Union Station.\n\nShawn has quietly built a strong reputation as he has toured the world with the supergroup he co-founded, Blue Highway, and the legendary bands he began his career with in Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder and Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver.\n\n\"Shawn Lane is unbelievable,\" said Bobby Starnes of Hat Creek Recording Company. \"You think you know how good it's gonna be, and then he comes in and blows your mind.\"\n\n“Shawn Lane is the epitome of a triple threat ~ one of the greatest singers, songwriters, and musicians to ever live,\" said Sierra Hull, GRAMMY nominee and IBMA Award Winner. \"I love his new song, 'I Met the Man,' and can’t wait to hear the whole album!

The Limited Edition Onyx is streamlined jet black with a heavier, thicker feel, due to a special diamond hardening agent being added to the original I-Tone material.\n\nI-Tone Picks are made from the same material used by NASA in construction of the Space Shuttle. The almost indestructible material has one of the highest wear and temperature ratings known to man, and delivers crystal clear tone and clarity when it strikes the strings.\n\nShawn Lane explains the introduction of the Limited Edition Onyx:\n\n\"This Limited Edition of the I-Tone Pick is made of the original I-Tone material, but with a touch of diamond hardener added to it. This hardener was added just to see what would happen. It was never meant to be made into a pick until it turned out so unique. The Onyx brings the feel of a heavier, thicker pick, without physically making the pick any thicker than the Original I-Tone 41, while retaining the same durability and extremely high wear rating as the original ivory colored material. Just like the Original I-Tone Pick, he Onyx version has its own feel and tone characteristics. Also, as an added bonus, the modification process turned the color of this pick to a beautiful, streamline jet black. The I-Tone Onyx will be a limited run of picks. The Original ivory colored I-Tone material will continue to be the main focus of our pick production going forward.\"\n\nThe Original I-Tone Pick debuted nearly a year ago in October 2016 to rave reviews from professional musicians and back-porch pickers alike:\n\n\"Love the I-Tone Pick! Have used it every set with LRB since I got it, and will continue to do so!\" - Jesse Smathers, mandolin player of the award-winning Lonesome River Band.\n\n\"Best pick I have ever used! You can not go wrong with these!\" - Mike Tallent, lead vocalist and mandolin player of Unbridled Strings Band.\n\nThe Limited Edition Onyx will be available for Pre-Sale on Friday, September 22, on the I-Tone Picks website at www.ITonePicks.com, with Free Shipping in the U.S.\n\nThe Official Premier of the Onyx will be at IBMA World of Bluegrass Expo in the Raleigh Convention Center Exhibit Hall ~ Booth 414~ on Friday, September 29. The Exhibit Hall will be open to the public on Friday-Saturday, September 29-30, from 11:00 AM - 6:00 PM. Shawn Lane will be available at the booth to answer questions and sign autographs on Friday only.\n\nShawn Lane is a fan-favorite vocalist, instrumentalist, and songwriter, and a co-founding member of multi-award winning supergroup Blue Highway. Shawn is as explosive on fiddle as he is on mandolin, often lending his talents to the GRAMMY-winning Earls of Leicester when not on the road with Blue Highway. Shawn was nominated as 2015 IBMA Songwriter of the Year, and has co-written such perennial Blue Highway favorites as Tears Fell On Missouri, The Seventh Angel, V-Bottom Boat, Sycamore Hollow, and Sounds of Home, which was nominated as 2012 IBMA Song of the Year, as well as the beloved A Mother's Prayer with Ronnie Bowman, which was recorded by the GRAMMY-winning Hall of Fame legend Dr. Ralph Stanley. Lane played in the bands of both GRAMMY-winner Ricky Skaggs and Hall of Fame member Doyle Lawson prior to becoming a founding member of Blue Highway in 1994.\n\nBrad Poore is a guitarist/vocalist and respected engineer associate at Clemson University.

The response is remarkable when considering it was generated from informal cell phone footage on Gracie's personal Facebook page alone, with no help from any viral app or YouTube.\n\nShawn asked Blue Highway's Tour Manager and In-House Booking Agent Sherri George to schedule a Summer 2017 performance to answer the demand for the duo to appear.\n\nA prestigious co-headlining spot alongside a Hall of Fame legend at a 21-year strong festival honoring one of the Grand Ole Opry's most beloved stars, David 'Stringbean' Akemon, was the spot crafted for the duo's first appearance.\n\nRumors of an album for the pair also swirl as Shawn and Gracie prepare to make their first official appearance.\n\nBlue Highway fans need not worry, Shawn Lane is committed to the 23-year strong powerhouse group he co-founded in 1994. Blue Highway's all-star members make special appearances frequently, from Jason Burleson's performances with 'Father of Newgrass' Sam Bush, to Shawn Lane's frequent guest appearances with the Grammy-winning Jerry Douglas & the Earls of Leicester.\n\nAppearing along with Shawn & Gracie and legend Larry Sparks at Stringbean Park on Friday, June 16, are festival host Phillip Akemon & Flatlick, Wilderness Road, the Fritts Family, Felix Brock & Gospel Harmony, the Sparrow Hawks, and Archie Campbell of Hee Haw's son Phil Campbell.\n\nBluegrass music, food, arts and crafts run Thursday-Saturday, June 15-17, concluding on Sunday with the festival hosting its first ever church service at 9:30 AM on Sunday, June 18, 2017.\n\nHeadliners overall include Ralph Stanley II & the Clinch Mountain Boys; Hall of Fame member Larry Sparks & the Lonesome Ramblers; Eastern Kentucky's Dave Adkins Band, whose most recent Bluegrass album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Chart; and Shawn & Gracie Lane.

His unique stage attire, traditional claw hammer banjo style, and entertaining stage banter endeared him to fans around the world. 'The Kentucky Wonder' was best known for his musical comedic performances on the hallowed stage of the Grand Ole Opry beginning in the 1940’s and on the television series “Hee Haw” until his tragic death in 1973.\n\nWith a rich history and beautiful locale at Stringbean Memorial Park, the festival has hosted the biggest stars in Bluegrass in the heart of Jackson County, Kentucky, for nearly a quarter century.\n\nFestival hosts Phillip and Linda Akemon warmly welcome everyone to enjoy a wonderful family event at Stringbean Memorial Park, a beautiful 25-acre family-owned venue near the Daniel Boone National Forest, just 30 minutes off I-75 Exit 41 for London, KY.\n\nSingle day tickets are $20 each, or a Big Three-Day Pass is only $55.

The almost indestructible material has one of the highest wear and temperature ratings known to man, and delivers crystal clear tone and clarity when it strikes the strings.\n\nThe rare material is almost ivory-like, and dramatically increases the volume, tone, and clarity musicians get from their stringed instruments. Remarkably, it also creates little to no pick noise.\n\nShawn Lane praised the I-Tone Pick, saying:\n\n“One of the first things that made me a fan of the pick, besides the huge sound it brings out of an instrument, is when I dropped it on a hard surface, it sounded like ivory when it hit. It has a crystal clear tone to it, even when dropped against something that doesn’t resonate. It gets the absolute best tone, volume, and clarity out of my mandolin and guitar. As a professional musician for 27 years, I’ve always been looking for something to make my instrument more connected to me. These picks do just that. If you want to bring out the most powerful, most natural, clear tone from your instrument, you are going to love I-Tone Picks!”\n\nProfessional musicians are heralding the I-Tone Pick for the sound it brings from their instrument:\n\n\"The I-Tone Pick has solved the problem of how to get the brightest tone with the least pick noise! These things rock!\" -- Cory Piatt, of the band Mountain Faith.\n\n\"Crystal clear highs and warm woody lows -- with no pick noise! What else could you ask for?! I love these picks!\" -- Harry Clark, of the band Volume Five.\n\nShawn Lane and Jacob Burleson of the Kenny & Amanda Smith Band are featured in a video, showcasing the I-Tone Pick’s sound on mandolin and guitar: https://youtu.be/6_FfqDa0Lko\n\nI-Tone Picks are available at www.ITonePicks.com and www.ShawnLaneMusic.com.\n\nA special Launch Week Promotion will enter all orders placed Oct 4-11 at www.ITonePicks.com to win an autographed set of Shawn Lane’s solo albums.\n\n###\n\nPress Release courtesy of Sherri George."
