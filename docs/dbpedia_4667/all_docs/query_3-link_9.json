        "text": "Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra (WCYO) will host an open rehearsal on Thursday, November 4th for music teachers, youth musicians and their parents.\n\nParticipants are invited to see the WCYO in action, meet our conductors and musicians, and generally learn more about what WCYO has to offer area youth musicians. The rehearsal will be held at Scotts Ridge Middle School, 750 North Salem Rd, in Ridgefield, in the Music Wing just to the right of the main office. Face masks will be required and standard Covid-19 safety protocols will be in place.\n\nThe String Ensemble, conducted by Sasha Ono, will rehearse from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM and offers advancing violinist, violist, cellist, and double bass players in grades 5 through 9 an opportunity to focus on strengthening the various fundamentals of ensemble performance and comprehensive string instruction, and performs intermediate to advanced level traditional and contemporary repertoire. The Symphony Orchestra, conducted by WCYO Music Director Eric Mahl, will rehearse from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM, and offers a full symphonic orchestra made up of advanced string, woodwind, brass and percussion musicians ranging in age from 13 to 18 and performs challenging orchestral repertoire. The Wind Ensemble, conducted by Albert Montecalvo, will rehearse from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM and is comprised of woodwind, brass and percussion musicians at the middle and high school level. This group focuses on strengthening the various fundamentals of ensemble performance and skill development, and performs both woodwind choir and concert band repertoire.\n\nStudent musicians may bring their instrument and join in the rehearsal or simply observe. RSVPs are requested via email to wcyo@wctyo.org. WCYO will follow this event with a round of auditions in November for any student interested in applying. Accepted musicians will take their seat in the WCYO 2021-22 ensembles starting with the Winter Session on December 9th."
