Less than six months later Bob went full time as Evening News Editor. He moved to the midday slot a year later and in 1964 was named News Director. Prior to Watson's appointment as ND, WAKY had never won a national award for news coverage or reporting. However, under Watson's direction WAKY News won national awards for 1964, 1965 and 1966. Left WAKY the final time to work at the Associated Press in Louisville as Kentucky Broadcast Editor. \"That means I'm responsible for making sure the radio and TV stations get good, fast and friendly service,\" Bob explains. \"I write broadcast news mostly from 5:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. M-F. It's a good salary with five weeks vacation, pension, and a 401K. Radio wouldn't have provided that, I don't believe.\" Bob retired from the AP in the summer of 2009 and continues to live in Taylorsville, Kentucky. Inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 2009. (Real name: Thomas Shelby Watson -- The \"Bob\" came in 1961 when ND Tom Perryman preferred Watson use another first name since Tom Hall was leaving.] Bob wrote on August 29, 2011:\n\nWeird Beard Night jock from November 21, 1966 through September 30, 1971. Weird Beard left WAKY for a PD gig at LIN Broadcasting's station in Rochester, New York where he spent two or three years before taking a position with the Rochester Police Department. Another reason many people think he departed Louisville was because of the 1971 tragic drowning death of his young son, Scotty. Mason Lee Dixon recalls: \"We spent many anguish-filled hours searching for the boy, sensing all of the time that he had crawled through the hole in the fence at the Water Company across the street from his house. There were all kinds of rumors flying hell, west and crooked since Burt (Weird Beard) and his wife were separated at the time. People can be cruel in their ignorance. Most of the city was sympathetic, even the competition. Only the cops and some really low-vibing characters were suspicious of Burt. It wasn't until the city finally consented to drain the reservoir that they recovered the body.\" Burt was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 19, but didn't let that stand in the way of successful careers in broadcasting and law enforcement. He returned to Louisville and lived with his mother for a while. Eventually he went into a Pewee Valley, Kentucky nursing home where he died November 22, 1995 due to complications brought on by MS.
