        "text": "Even when we are physically apart, these virtual rehearsals allow us to express ourselves and stay connected to each other, which is something we need now more than ever\n\n-Music Director and Symphony Orchestra Conductor Eric Mahl\n\nThe Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra (WCYO) had its last in person rehearsal for the season on March 5th. The next week schools were closed and rehearsals canceled, but the WCYO ensembles – Symphony Orchestra, String and Wind Ensembles – persevered and have been holding virtual rehearsals ever since.\n\nMusic Director and Symphony Orchestra Conductor Eric Mahl, String Ensemble Conductor Sasha Ono and Wind Ensemble Conductor Albert Montecalvo prepare video tutorials and practice notes to go out via email blast each Monday, ahead of video conference ensemble rehearsals on Thursday evenings. “The power of music, and the greatness of human resilience continues to surprise me every day,” says Music Director Eric Mahl. “Even when we are physically apart, these virtual rehearsals allow us to express ourselves and stay connected to each other, which is something we need now more than ever.” Additionally and starting last week, Executive Director Ruth Feldman has begun coordinating “office hours” for each conductor as well to enable them to work with students in smaller groups, also via video conference.\n\nAll three ensembles will assemble a recorded montage performance to present at an online event on May 31st – the date of the WCYO’s originally scheduled season ending concert. During that event, the graduating seniors will be recognized and the WCYO college scholarship will be awarded. The scholarship is awarded to one senior each year selected by the WCYO Board of Directors based on submitted written essays. The scholarship is generously funded by donations from WCYO member families.\n\nThe WCYO will be holding auditions for the 2020-21 season the first week of June. Auditions will be held via live video conference. Information on audition requirements and an online application is available at https://wctyo.org/auditions/ All youth musicians entering grades 5th through 12th interested in an engaging, inspiring, and fun ensemble experience are encouraged to apply.\n\nThe mission of the Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra is to educate and inspire young musicians through the study and performance of classical and contemporary musical works, participation in enrichment activities, and engagement with the community. The WCYO program provides an opportunity to develop artistry and technique, as well as a profound understanding and appreciation of instrumental music. Our members are challenged not only to perform at the highest level, but also to build character, creativity and self-esteem, with music as their guide. The WCYO is based in Ridgefield, CT and has member musicians from over 20 towns in the regional area.\n\nFor more information, visit https://wctyo.org/ or email wcyo@wctyo.org."
