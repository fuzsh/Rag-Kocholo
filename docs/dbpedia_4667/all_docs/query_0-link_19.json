        "text": "RICHMOND, Ky. – It's been 13 years since the Eastern Kentucky University football team has opened its season at home on a Thursday night. That will all change this Thursday when the Colonels welcome Robert Morris to Roy Kidd Stadium. Kick-off is set for 7 p.m.\n\nThe Colonels, ranked No. 19 nationally in the preseason FCS coaches poll, were picked second in the preseason OVC poll behind defending league champion Eastern Illinois. Since Dean Hood took over as EKU's head coach in 2008, the Colonels have won two OVC championships and 29 league games. Both of those numbers are tops among the nine OVC football teams.\n\nThis is the first ever meeting between the two teams and also the first time EKU has faced a team from the Northeast Conference. Robert Morris was picked second in the NEC preseason poll by The Sports Network. RMU head coach Joe Walton, who is in his 20th year with the Colonials, is set to be inducted into the RMU Athletics Hall of Fame this November.\n\nThere will be plenty of pregame and postgame festivities Thursday evening surrounding the football game. The tailgating lot will open at 4 p.m., while the Colonel Walk is scheduled for 4:45 p.m.\n\nThere will be a Chick-fil-A Junior Colonel Club Inflatable Kids Zone both in the tailgate area and in the stadium. Papa John's will be on hand giving out prizes to lucky fans.\n\nThe brand new Daktronics HD video board will be unveiled prior to kickoff and will feature a Hollywood-produced introduction video for the Colonels.\n\nThe first 4,000 students to enter the stadium will receive an EKU maroon t-shirt. The EKU Student Government Association will be checking in students for E-Ranks and giving out prizes at halftime.\n\nThere will be plenty of performances by the Marching Colonels, EKU Dance Team and EKU Cheerleaders throughout the game.\n\nFireworks will be on display before and after the game. Finally, a student will have a chance to win free Papa John's for a year during an in-game promotion.\n\nGAMEDAY INFORMATION\n\nGame Notes\n\n--Click here for EKU game notes.\n\nOpponent Information\n\n--Click here for the Robert Morris football web site.\n\n--Click here for Robert Morris' game notes.\n\nTelevision\n\n--None\n\nVideo Streaming\n\n-- Thursday's game can be seen on the web for FREE at the new OVCDigitalNetwork.com.\n\nLive Audio\n\n--Thursday's game can be heard locally on WCYO 100.7 FM.

EKU is 204-46-1 all-time at the facility, which opened in 1969. EKU is 10-3 in home openers since 2000 and has won four straight home openers.\n\n--Four defensive starters earned preseason all-conference honors – senior linebacker Anthony Brown, senior defensive lineman Shawn Shupperd, junior defensive back Brandon Stanley and senior linebacker Ichiro Vance. Eastern's defense led the conference in points allowed (21.7 ppg) and rushing defense (108.2 ypg) one year ago.\n\nGAMEDAY EXPERIENCE\n\nParking\n\n• The Alumni Coliseum east side parking lot will close at 11 p.m. on Wednesday night before the game.
