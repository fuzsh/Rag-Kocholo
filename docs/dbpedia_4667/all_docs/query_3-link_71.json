        "text": "Mission: The mission of the Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra organization is to provide an opportunity for young musicians to develop their talents through the highest quality music education and performance opportunities and to provide cultural enrichment to the regional Connecticut and New York areas. The primary goals of our ensembles, beyond education and performance, are to nurture the love of music and develop the knowledge of and encourage appreciation for classical and concert repertoire.\n\nIntro and History: Founded in 2002 as the Ridgefield Symphony Youth Orchestra, our organization provides talented young musicians in the regional Connecticut and New York areas with exceptional learning and performance opportunities, while fostering an awareness and appreciation of the enjoyment and power of music. Twenty-five young musicians were selected as members of the inaugural youth orchestra, which began weekly rehearsals in January 2003. In the fall of 2005, the program grew to include a String Ensemble which allowed the organization to reach and nurture a broader range of musical talents and abilities. In August 2008, as part of our goal to establish greater recognition of the organization's regional focus, we changed our name to the Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra. In 2010, the WCYO added a Wind Ensemble to our program offerings. Together the Symphony Orchestra, String Ensemble and Wind Ensemble currently consist of over ninety auditioned musicians ages eight to eighteen, hailing from twenty towns in Connecticut and New York."
