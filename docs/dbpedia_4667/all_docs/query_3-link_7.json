Our audience is also a significant part of our donor base.\n\nGoal #3 : Provide meaningful opportunities for all members of the orchestra to improve their skills and performance.\n\nThis objective is important because part of our mission is to “cultivating the artistic growth and excellence of both youth and adult members.”\n\nBased upon our Mission, Vision, Values, and Current State Analysis, the Westside Community & Youth Orchestra has determined three strategic goals that will assist in the growth of the orchestra.\n\nGoal #1 Build the capacity of the organization to support long-term growth, sustainability, and resiliency.\n\nThis goal is important because it supports and preserves the continued existence of the orchestra and the programs that are part of its mission.\n\nActivities to achieve this priority:\n\na. Develop new marketing materials to elicit support and donations.\n\nb. Cultivate new short and long-term funding sources.\n\nc. Seek sponsorships and grants for support of the orchestra.\n\nd. Create an endowment for the support of the orchestra.\n\nGoal #2 Strive to serve as much of the community as possible.\n\nThis objective is important because a primary measure of our success as an orchestra is how many people attend our performances. Our audience is also a significant part of our donor base.\n\nActivities to achieve this priority:\n\na. Develop new marketing materials and strategies to increase our attendance and attract players.\n\nb. Build a stronger network of ties to area schools, music teachers, and music education programs to attract student players.\n\nc. Consider using concert programming as a means to engage new audience groups.\n\nd. Consider partnerships with other organizations to broaden our recognition within the community.\n\ne. Consider engaging community members for the Board, who may not be active players, if they can help connect the orchestra with audiences, donors, players, and potential partners.\n\nGoal #3 : Provide meaningful opportunities for all members of the orchestra to improve their skills and performance.\n\nThis objective is important because part of our mission is to “cultivating the artistic growth and excellence of both youth and adult members.”\n\nActivities to achieve this priority:\n\na. Increase number of orchestra members who pursue music lessons outside the formal rehearsal time.\n\nb. Establish a recognition program for those taking outside music lessons.\n\nc. Create more formal mentoring within the structure of the orchestra by encouraging sectional meetings outside formal rehearsal time."
