        "text": "TORNADO WATCH\n\nTornadoes are possible. Remain alert for approaching storms. Watch the sky and stay tuned to NOAA weather radio, commercial radio, or television for information.\n\nBe Prepared! Tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area.\n\nReview and discuss emergency plans.\n\nBe ready to act quickly if a warning is issued or you suspect a tornado is approaching.\n\nMonitor weather announcements.\n\nIf you are on an upper floor, and the likelihood of a tornado warning being issued exists, consider moving to the lowest level of a permanent structure while the elevator (if there is one) can be safely utilized.\n\nLocal Emergency Alert System Radio Stations: WCBR 1110 AM, WEKY 1340 AM, WKXO 1500 AM, WIRV 1550 AM, WEKU 88.9 FM, WCYO 100.7 FM, WLFX 106.7 FM\n\nTORNADO WARNING\n\nA tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar.\n\nTAKE SHELTER IMMEDIATELY.\n\nD = Downstairs: Get to the lowest level you can, a basement if you have one, or just the ground floor.\n\nU = Under: Get under something sturdy like a heavy table or staircase to protect yourself from flying objects. Protect your head.\n\nC = Center: Go to the center part of a permanent structure. Put as many walls as you can between you and the outside. A closet, hallway or bathroom in the middle of the building is a good choice.\n\nK = Keep Away: Keep away from exterior doors and windows, which can be sources of flying glass and debris.\n\nIF YOU ARE IN A STRUCTURE\n\nGo to a pre-designated shelter area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside. Get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your head and neck. Do not open windows.\n\nIF YOU ARE IN A VEHICLE, TRAILER, OR MOBILE HOME\n\nGet out immediately and go to the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a storm shelter. Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes.\n\nIF YOU ARE OUTSIDE WITH NO SHELTER"
