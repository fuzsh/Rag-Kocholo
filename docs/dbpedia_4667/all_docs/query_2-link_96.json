        "text": "AngryCountry.com Interview - AngryCountry.com\n\nThe AngryCountry.com Interview: Con Hunley\n\nBy Christine Bohorfoush\n\nFor those of our readers who are younger and new to country music, the name Con Hunley may not be familiar. But Con is no stranger to the country music scene. In the 70s and 80s, he had numerous hit singles including his biggest \"Oh Girl\" recorded in 1982. During that time, he was touring with various artists including George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Alabama, The Gatlin Brothers, The Oak Ridge Boys and others. In 1984, Con went with Capital Records. One of his recordings for them, \"What Am I Going to Do About You,\" was a hit and one of twenty of his songs that made the top ten on the charts. It stayed on the charts for fifty-eight consecutive weeks. It was during these years that Con was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year and Newcomer of the Year by ACM and CMA.\n\nCon has played in venues large and small and still loves to perform more than just about anything. He has an active tour schedule and does appearances between recording sessions. He has continued to participate in charity golf tournaments, which makes the circle complete since his recording career was launched during the Acuff-Rose Tournament in Nashville. His latest project is a marriage of the old and new. He and Norro Wilson, his first producer at Warner Brothers Records, kept in touch and began talking about another project a few years ago. \"We decided to do a new album, Sweet Memories, and enlisted the top musicians in Nashville,\" Con says.\n\nAfter Con Hunley was brought to the attention of AngryCountry and upon reviewing his new album, I was so impressed with his soulful voice and the return to true traditional storytelling songs that Sweet Memories brought, I knew that I wanted to reintroduce Con to our readers and ask the questions that both his fans, old and new, wanted to ask of him.\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nChristine: Con, as one of six children, I understand that your first entrance into the world of music was singing gospel songs at church with your family... could you tell our readers more about this?\n\nCon: Well, you know, Christine, for a number of years I thought that everybody played some instrument and sang. From the time that I was born, I was surrounded by that... all my aunts and uncles, on both sides of my family, on my mother's and father's side, all played and sang. And there were people in the neighborhood who played and sang. Of course, at that time a lot of the relatives kind of lived close. So I thought that everybody played and sang. There was a number of years before I realized that this wasn't really the case. They both inspired me to want to play; and of course, the early beginnings was in church. My grandfather on my mother's side was a preacher in a Church of God, and from a early time my mother always sang in church as well as with her brothers and sisters... they sang harmony and were very talented. And so when I was born, there was just me and my sister, Beth, for a while and then my brother, Steve, came along. We were all encouraged to sing and to sing gospel music and we did. Then I learned to play guitar; I remember that I got an old used Stella guitar when I was like nine years old... I think it was a Christmas present. I drug that thing around the house and they taught me chord patterns and several songs. Actually at the time, my hands were too small to really make the chords, but I managed to learn some simple songs. That's really the early beginnings... it was just family.\n\nChristine: Well, you first taught yourself to play guitar by ear and learned Ray Charles' \"What'd I Say\"... what was it about Ray Charles that so influenced you?\n\nCon: My first hero... the first person whom I idolized musically... was Chet Atkins. I really wanted to be a thumb style guitar player. I worked on the thumb style playing and I used to listen to all of his albums. Back in the 60s, Ray Charles came out with the song \"What'd I Say\" and just the kick-off on the piano kind of reached out and grabbed me and I just loved it. Of course, I was a fan of Jerry Lee Lewis and I never really had thought much about learning to play piano. But when I heard the song, it just kind of set me on fire. During that time, my folks had bought an old used upright piano to give my sister, Beth, piano lessons... to be able to accompany the family group singing in church. So when my sister wasn't on the piano - and there was this local guy in the neighborhood who was teaching her how to read music - I was on the piano. You've heard of the old hunt and peck on the typewriter? That was sort of what I was doing on the piano. With the Ray Charles thing, I was doing my best to learn the intro and finally did and that is what really influenced me and that particular song. Of course, the more I became acquainted with Ray Charles' music, the more I enjoyed it and the more I appreciated it because it always seemed like he sang from the very pit of his soul and from his heart. It was always so inspired and it just touched me. I was a huge fan from the get-go!\n\nChristine: In May of 1965, you joined the Air Force to learn a trade... could you tell our readers about your military experience?\n\nCon: It was really a great experience... the draft was still in effect at that time and I was going to be drafted into the Army. I thought, 'Well, I'll just go ahead and join the Air Force because I thought that they had some great programs available as far as learning a trade.' I was always pretty mechanically inclined; I could fix things and figure things out from an early age. When I went into the Air Force, I went through basic training in Texas. I was shipped out to a base in Illinois for Air Training Command, so I went through tech school there. I made really good grades and it came pretty easy for me. And so after going through tech school, they pulled me out to become an instructor in what I had chosen as a career field... that was Aircraft Hydraulic and Pneumatic Systems. I taught that for two years at the Air Training Command in Illinois. That was during the Vietnam War and they needed technicians and mechanics and what have you. So they pulled me as an instructor and that is where I was for the better part of two years.\n\nChristine: I understand that a golf tournament helped lead to a record deal in 1977 with Warner Brothers Records... could you explain more about how this came to be?\n\nCon: Well, when I got out of the service, I spent a little time in California... I had a good friend that I was in the service with; he got shipped to Vietnam and I stayed in Illinois. Then I wound up in Castle Air Force Base in California. But he and I got out of the service about the same time and so I spent some time with he and his family in California. Anyway, I moved back to Tennessee and at that time I was into the music thing and tried to play as much as I could. But when I moved back home, I was kind of a stranger in my own town... I didn't know a lot of the people, especially musicians or anyone who was playing in a band. I started playing at a place called the Corner Lounge which was a Thursday night gig that I started doing just to be heard. And then there was a place called the Village Barn and I played there for quite some time. Just out of the clear blue a friend of mine at WIVK Radio, Bobby Denton, played every year in the Acuff-Rose Golf Tournament in Nashville. It just so happened that this particular year he asked me if I wanted to go with him to the golf tournament. I said, 'Sure.' He said, 'Well, I think that I can get you an invitation.' I love to golf! I wasn't great at it, but I love it and I enjoyed it; and I certainly enjoyed the music part of the tournaments. So anyway, I went down there and we played golf. Generally after golf, they have a little banquet and they give the awards. After that they generally have what they call \"a guitar pulling\" and it is like a big suite at a hotel and there is a number of songwriters, singers, pickers, and grinners in the room. We went there just to listen... I mean, I was just sitting there on the floor with my legs folded listening to all the great songs... Chet Atkins was in the room. They were passing the guitar around and people were doing new songs and old songs and songs they had written and all of this. Out of the blue, the guitar was sitting pretty close to me, having gone around and around the room. My friend, Bobby Denton, said, 'Well Con, why don't you sing one?' I thought, 'Oh my God.' It scared me to death... I mean, I was sitting there listening and very relaxed and suddenly the heat was turned on me and I'm sure my heart rate jumped to 160. (we laugh) As it turned out, I sang a couple of songs. I did not know it at the time, but there were a couple of people from Warner Brothers Records in the room. Everyone seemed to like what they had heard. I did not think about it much at the time, but about two weeks later Warner Brothers chartered a plane and flew to East Tennessee and brought a bunch of people in. I was playing at the Village Barn and they came out to hear me and the next thing you know, I got offered a contract. People ask me how it happened, and I said 'well, playing golf.' After Warner Brothers began pursuing me for a contract, I had offers from a total of five major labels in a matter of two weeks. It was unbelievable! I was almost overwhelmed by it all.\n\nChristine: In the 70s and 80s, you recorded many hits to include your biggest \"Oh Girl\" and you were nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year and Newcomer of the Year... with so much success under your belt, what led you to leave country music behind? And why do you feel now is the right time to return to it?\n\nCon: Well, Christine, I don't know if I left it or it left me or if it was a combination of both... but I had been with Warner Brothers for five years and I had some friends at MCA and they were wanting me to leave Warner Brothers and come to MCA because it was kind of a happening label in the country division. The Oak Ridge Boys were there and they were good friends of mine and I traveled with them a good bit. They sang back-up on the single of \"Oh Girl.\" So we were great friends and they were with MCA. So I decided to leave Warner Brothers when my contract was up in '82. I signed with MCA and Jim Fogelsong was the head of the label at the time. After three or four months, we were kind of beating the bushes and looking for songs; and I had recorded three or four songs... we were probably three or four songs deep into an album. The next thing I know, Fogelsong is removed as the label head and they brought in a new label head and I wasn't going to be a part of their country division. That kind of knocked the legs out from under me, if you know what I mean. It is kind of tough...no label... no nothing... and nobody knocking on the door. As it turned out, Jim Fogelsong wound up at Capital Records after some months. When he went to Capital, he signed me to a contract there. The same thing happened there we were three or four songs deep into an album... in fact, I had a song called \"Quittin' Time,\" which is a pretty big airplay record. And I also had a song called \"What in the World Am I Going to Do About You\" that was on the charts for like fifty something weeks, ya know? Even after the same thing happened to me at Capital that had happened to me at MCA... the changes and stuff and I got let go... they could not kill the record. The record continued to play radio loved it, and the people. After that happened, I thought 'Well, I really take a lot of pride in choosing really good songs... it just seemed like I was butting my head against the wall, so maybe it was best for me to just kind of pull away from it for a while and see what happens.' I really thought that I would get an offer from another label or something would pop up. Although I did not bang on the doors like I probably should have and as time goes by, the industry people forget about you. Once the industry forgets about you, it doesn't take long before the listening audience kind of forgets about you. As it turned out, I didn't have any recorded product for quite some time... probably eighteen years. Then this opportunity came up with IMMI Records and what is probably so nice about this situation is that I have creative control. I do not have to go before a board or a bunch of people who have never played... never sung... never been on a stage... and don't know the first thing about great country music. They may know marketing and they may know this that or the other from a corporate perspective, but they do not know much about the creative process, once you get into the studio. This situation here just offered me the right situation and I could not be happier. Although it has been a while, I am finding out that people really remember me and my style of music... God, the reviews and the response that we have been getting to the album is just been fantastic, Christine.\n\nChristine: I can believe that, Con... in listening to the country music fans that AngryCountry comes in contact with every day, the fans are not being listened to. I repeatedly hear the questions like, What has happened to the real traditional country music?... the storytelling songs? Why are they jamming this \"I Love This Bar\" kind of music down country listeners throats constantly? Quality country music seems to have taken a back seat to the junk.\n\nCon: Well, you know this is one of the things about the situation that I am in with IMMI Records... the music that I am making is real; it's about life and it is life. I saw a quote one time by Louis Armstrong; it read \"What I play is life.\" Well, what I sing is life!\n\nChristine: That is exactly what everyone out here who loves country music... why we love it; because it is songs that one can relate to.\n\nCon: Absolutely! The kind of songs that I do... I don't cut songs that I cannot identify with or that don't speak to me. Ultimately, you can't sing something that you don't feel or don't believe. I am just real thankful and grateful for what is going on right now. I think there is going to be a trend more to what I am doing and what is going on with music right now. You know, I hate to use the term that Norro Wilson used, but you know, the term is \"cookie cutter music.\"\n\nChristine: (laughing hard) Norro must have taken that from our site.\n\nCon: (laughing) He might have. He might have. You know, it is difficult to tell one artist from another... all the styles are the same... there is no individuality, which takes some of the believability out of all of it. We are just going to keep on doing what we are doing... we are going to sing from the heart and from the soul. We just want it to be real. That is what we did in the studio. I remember going into the studio when we were working on Sweet Memories, with some of the greatest musicians in Nashville... I said that what we are going to do here today is let you play what you feel. God, you talk about such a wonderful time in the studio; you could just tell that the guys were having a good time. They played licks that you probably would not hear on any other album because they were not trying to be commercial this or that; what they were being is real and what they were playing came from their hearts. We just had a wonderful time.\n\nChristine: I think that the industry underrates the fans because they get it... they understand, as I do, that an artist always knows their music best and must have the freedom to make their music their way.\n\nCon: Yes, and I want to tell you that with all that is going on and all the various outlets that there are musically for the fans... you can go directly to the fan's ear now. I think that the industry is going to have to say, Oops! Wait a minute, we cannot force this down the fans throats... they want this or they want that.\n\nChristine: Having been away from country music for a number of years, what changes have you found with today's music industry? And with country radio?\n\nCon: Having been away for as long as I have been away, it is difficult for me to get what they call major country radio airplay. What we are doing is working all of the markets; I mean we just aren't leaving any stone unturned. It is a little difficult, but with the Internet and all of the outlets that there are, we are probably in the best place that we could be right now as far as things being the way they are.\n\nChristine: To follow up on that, will you be attending CRS (Country Radio Seminar) this year?\n\nCon: I'm going to try to... I don't know exactly what my schedule is going to be. I do know that we are working on it, as we speak. We are going to do our best to be there.\n\nChristine: After nearly a twenty year absence from recording, you have recently returned to IMMI Records to make your debut album Sweet Memories... reuniting with Producer Norro Wilson... could you tell our readers more about this?\n\nCon: Actually how it came about is that a friend of mine who was with Capital Records, when I was over there, he was kind of helping with A and R... his name was Terry Chote. They were going to have the induction for Norro into the songwriters Hall of Fame in Nashville. And so Terry called me and he was kind of putting the thing together and they were going to not only induct Norro, but Buck Owens and two or three more. He called me and said, \"You know, I think it would be a wonderful surprise and treat if you would come and do the huge hit that Norro had with Charlie Rich called \"The Most Beautiful Girl.\" It would just be you and the piano and you'll be spotlighted and it will be a total surprise.\" I said that I thought it would be great, and so I went down and we had a little rehearsal... they had a couple of spots set up in the venue where people were going to perform the inductees songs. When it came time for Norro to be inducted, they put me on this circular stage and the spotlight panned over to me and I did \"The Most Beautiful Girl in The World\" and I looked around and Norro was crying like a baby. We had not seen each other in quite some time, we talked occasionally, but we had not seen each other in quite some time. It was just a real emotional time and there were a lot of industry people there. When it was all over, there were just a number of industry people who came to me and said, \"Con, you need to be recording again. We miss your style, your voice, it is different and unique. You just need to be recording again.\" Of course, Norro was standing there and that's how one thing lead to another and how Sweet Memories came about. And of course with the help of Dean Dillion, who is a great friend of mine, he had some songs that I loved. In fact, one of the first songs that we cut is \"A Chance,\" which Dean wrote with me in mind.\n\nChristine: (laughing) Oh, that is my favorite cut from the Sweet Memories album.\n\nCon: Well, at the time, we thought that we might be able to get a major label deal... but you know, it is all about the 27/27... you have to be 27 years old and have a 27 inch waist; they don't say anything about being able to sing. (he laughs)\n\nChristine: Now wait a minute! You see, it is different for me... I'm not one of those who is gaga for Kenny Chesney or Toby Keith; they do not do a thing for me. I do not want to hear all about your latest experience in some bar or about lounging on the beach all day; sing me something that moves me and reaches in and touches my soul. I grew up listening to Motown... and there's a lot of difference in singing about some bar and having Smokey Robinson sing \"O Baby Baby.\" Now that's what I'm talking about!\n\nCon: (laughing) You know, all that old R and B stuff... well, I've always loved music - country or otherwise- that touches me. That is really how Sweet Memories came about; and of course, the IMMI Records situation and being an independent. We have had tremendous success with IMMI and the initial response to the album. I am just so thankful for everything, Christine it's going really well. I mean, we aren't setting the woods on fire and probably won't go Platinum - you never know - but the response from the people who appreciate real country music has just been tremendous.\n\nChristine: Con, I speak with country music fans every day and I know that this style of music is what they are yearning to have return to country music radio airwaves... the pure country storytelling songs. It is only the teeny bopper handful who is following these \"flavor of the month\" artists. They do not want the concerts with half-naked women on the stage and the rock show atmosphere. What the true country music fan continues to want is the artist that performs through sheer talent and songwriting ability. Unfortunately, what they are getting is what today's country radio and the industry is jamming down their throats.\n\nCon: That is absolutely right! They make people believe that this is all that is out there. Well, guess what? That is not all that is out there. I think, more and more, you are going to find people doing what we are doing. And I think that you are going to find changes, and you already are seeing changes. There are so many what they call \"classic radio stations\" popping up every day. They are starting to play more of the older songs, I know that WIVK in Knoxville is. I think that they are beginning to get the message; I mean, good God how many times a day can you hear the same ten or twelve records? I also think that there is a whole country music listener audience that is being ignored.\n\nChristine: I think that more and more of the artists are also returning or fighting to continue to record more traditional country music stylings.\n\nCon: Absolutely right! The artists want to go back to where they have creative control... they do not want to have somebody sitting there who is twenty-six or thirty years old who has never been on stage or played an instrument in their life trying to tell them what to do, ya know? Music by community; well, that is a crock! It is just not how it goes.\n\nChristine: I understand that Sweet Memories is also an album that you dedicated to your Mom (Priscilla) who passed away in 1999... could you tell us about why the song \"Amazing Grace,\" for example, from the album meant so much to her?\n\nCon: As I mentioned early, Christine, my early influence and background was in gospel. It was church oriented and very spiritual. Mom had a great deal to do with my early musical beginnings and she had a number of songs that she absolutely loved. I did a little theatre thing for a while in Pigeon Forge and she and Dad used to come up and see the show. I would do the Mickey Newberry thing \"Sweet Memories\" and you could tell that it took her back when she listened to the song. It took her back, I am sure, to the days when she was young or when she was newly married and when we were young. I could just tell that she got lost in the song. She would tell me every time how much she loved the song. In the process of doing this project, I decided that I would dedicate it to her memory because she meant so much to me and she was so influential in my early musical beginnings. I worked up a version of \"Amazing Grace\" and she loved it, so I thought that I would do those two songs and dedicate the entire project to her memory. I remember going into the studio with the guys and we had some time left... \"Amazing Grace\" was kind of almost an afterthought for the album. We had already done \"Sweet Memories\" and I was talking to Norro and some of the guys had already unplugged in the studio. And Norro said, \"You want to do that?\" because I had already told him that I wanted to do \"Amazing Grace.\" I didn't know how it would be received or what the guys would think about it, ya know? But Norro said, \"Hey boys, before we take off, lets do \"Amazing Grace\" right quick... Con's got his own version of it and lets do it right quick.\" Well, I sat down at the piano and started playing it and everyone began to plug back in and get into their parts.\n\nChristine: Isn't it funny how you can always feel when a song begins to touch you and others?\n\nCon: Well, you know what happened? When we began to play \"Amazing Grace,\" I betcha we played it for twenty minutes. They did not want to quit; it was such an inspirational thing... you could just feel it. I mean, there was just chills on me and there was definitely something going on in the studio when we recorded it. I remember that George Clinton, who was the engineer their light went off and we continued to play. There was just something magical about the song and I am real tickled with the way it all turned out.\n\nChristine: With two singles from the album doing well on the charts \"Only Time Will Tell\" and the remake of Bill Anderson's \"Still\"... do you have plans to tour in promotion of the new album?\n\nCon: Oh, absolutely! In fact while I am in Nashville, I am going to try and get some booking agents and we are going to start trying to get out there.\n\nChristine: (laughing) Great! Because I want to be there for one of your concerts.\n\nCon: (laughing) Well, I definitely want to do that... when I was out working on the road before, we stayed out there quite a bit. It was fun to me; that's the part of it that I absolutely loved when you can go and connect with those people who listen to you and who buy your records and you have a personal connection with. It is great to sit there and listen to them sing along or they close their eyes and kind of move back and forth with the music; that is a wonderful feeling!\n\nChristine: While you are in Nashville, it is said that you will be taping Bill Cody's GAC Classic Country TV Show to air on February 9th... could you tell our readers more about this?\n\nCon: Well, Bill Cody and I have been friends for quite a long time. He has been very supportive of me since really we went in and did three or four sides on this particular project. I took it to him, right off the bat, and he played it on SM right off the bat. He and I have really established a great friendship and he is a believer in what we do. He has just been really kind to us, so to go in and spend time with him on GAC is great. He is very knowledgeable, and like I said, he believes in what we are doing.\n\nChristine: You so enjoyed being back in the studio that it is said you are already looking forward to future projects... what is next for Con Hunley?\n\nCon: Initially, Christine, we were talking about maybe cherry picking some of the old stuff... the old Warner Brothers/ Capital stuff and doing maybe a \"Best of Con Hunley\" and putting maybe three or four new songs on the CD. As it has turned out, it looks like we are going to get access to the old stuff, so I know that we are probably going to wind up with the old stuff at Warner Brothers... and we are trying to work out a licensing arrangement with MCA/Capital to get the old stuff over there and to go ahead and bring it over to IMMI. If that does not happen, we will cherry pick the albums and bring some of the hit songs and go back into the studio and re-record them and then do three or four new songs. And if that does not happen, then we are pretty much going to do what we did this time with Sweet Memories... we will pick out great songs that I have done over the years that I have never recorded and some new material and will probably go back into the studio some time in June or July. I am really looking forward to another project; I have mentioned it to Norro and of course, he is chomping at the bit. There will be other projects coming from IMMI and from Con Hunley.\n\nChristine: We have a signature question that we like to ask each artist that we speak with... what is the one thing that your fans would be most surprised to know about you?\n\nCon: Hmmm, I don't really know. And of course, they already know that I like to golf. I am somewhat of a mechanic... I have a couple of old cars and I like to tinker with them. They might be surprised to know that I like to get out the old mechanic's toolbox every once in a while and work on my own cars.\n\nChristine: And finally, is there anything else that you would like to say to your fans and to our readers?\n\nCon: Well, I would just like to say that I am very thankful and grateful for what is going on. I want them to stay tuned and stay with me; we have more music coming.\n\nCopyright 2005 AngryCountry.com\n\nAngryCountry.com Review of \"Sweet Memories\" - August 26, 2004 - from AngryCountry.com's Web Site\n\nCon Hunley - Sweet Memories\n\nBy. Christine Bohorfoush - AngryCountry.com Staff Writer\n\nCon Hunley: New Album, After An Absence From Country Music\n\nNew fans to country music may not be familiar with the name Con Hunley, the soulful singer who was born and raised in Fountain City in the Smokey Mountain foothills of East Tennessee. One of six children, Con had music in his life from birth. His first entrance into the music world was singing gospel songs at church with his family. Con's parents bought him a used \"Stella\" guitar for Christmas when he was nine years old. He was overjoyed. His parents taught him basic chords (G, C, D, A) and some simple songs. Con idolized Chet Atkins and taught himself to play thumb-style guitar while still a youth. When his parents bought a piano for his sister, Beth, Con taught himself to play by ear and learned Ray Charles' famous hit, \"What'd I Say.\" That was the beginning of a lifelong love affair. Con credits Ray Charles with having the greatest influence on his style and his music career. \"That record was like a monster that just grabbed me up,\" Con says, \"and it kept alive my motivation to play.\"\n\nIn 1975 Con went to Nashville after catching the ear of Sam Kirkpatrick who happened to be at the Corner Lounge in Knoxville one Thursday night where Con was performing. Kirkpatrick chartered Prairie Dust Records and Con, with the help of guitarist Larry Morton, who was band leader for Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass, cut five sides: \"Misery Loves Company,\" \"Pick Up The Pieces,\" \"I'll always Remember That Song,\" \"Deep In The Arms of Texas,\" and \"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do.\" \"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do\" received national attention. Soon after, Con, an avid golfer, was at the Acuff-Rose Publishing Company Golf Tournament in Nashville with Bobby Denton of WIVK Radio. After the first day of the tournament the golfer/musicians, made up of the biggest names in country music, had a \"guitar pullin'.\" Bobby Denton asked Con to sing. He sang two songs after a lot of persuasion, but was totally in awe of everyone in the room. A few days after the tournament, his phone started ringing. Major labels wanted to meet him. After the dust settled, Con Hunley signed with Warner Brothers Records in 1977 and cut his first of five Warner albums, Cry, Cry Darling.\n\nIn 1982 Con recorded his biggest hit, \"Oh Girl.\" During that time he was touring with various artists including George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Alabama, The Gatlin Brothers, The Oak Ridge Boys and others. In 1984 Con went with Capital Records. One of his recordings for them, \"What Am I Going To Do About You,\" was a hit and one of twenty of his songs that made the top ten on the charts. It stayed on the charts for fifty-eight consecutive weeks. It was during these years that Con was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year and Newcomer of the Year by ACM and CMA. In 1982 Hunley sang the National Anthem before the Heavyweight Championship between Big John Tate and Gerry Coetzee in Pretoria, South Africa. In 1986 Con performed with the seventy piece Knoxville Symphony Orchestra and his five piece band, a Knoxville first. He played at the White House in 1996 and did an annual New Year's Eve show in the Smokies for many years.\n\nHis latest project is a marriage of the old and new. Con and Norro Wilson, his first producer at Warner Records, kept in touch and began talking about another project a few years ago. \"We decided to do a new album, Sweet Memories,\" and enlisted the top musicians in Nashville,\" Con says. In 1999 Con's mother, Priscilla Clodell Hunley, passed away. It was a year later before Con got back to the album. He had already recorded eight cuts and added six more. Sweet Memories is completed now and is dedicated to Con's mother. She is the reason that the final cut on the album is \"Amazing Grace.\" She loved the song and she loved to hear her son sing it just like in the days of his childhood.\n\nWhen Con Hunley was brought to the attention of AngryCountry, we were so impressed by this album that we knew we wanted to interview Con and speak with him regarding his feelings on the album, Mr. Hunley kindly agreed:\n\nCon: Hey, Michael!\n\nMichael: Hey, Con...how are you doing?\n\nCon: I'm doing fine... how are you, Sir?\n\nMichael: Pretty good...\n\nCon: Great!\n\nMichael: Man, your XM Radio Show last week was just awesome...\n\nCon: Oh, thank you!\n\nMichael: (laughing) We timed a road trip last week to Nashville so that we'd make sure that we'd be on the road during that hour that you were on XM and we could hear you perform. [Con did a one hour live concert on XM Radio from their studios in Washington, D.C. where he discussed and played many of his past hits, as well as new music from his current album.]\n\nCon: Really? That's kind of neat... I mean, I had not done anything like that in quite a long time. I was real happy the way it turned out; of course, what a great facility it was. I enjoyed the heck out of it!\n\nMichael: It was just amazing... for just you, a guitar player, and an empty room.\n\nCon: Yeah!\n\nMichael: Well, I just have a few quick questions for you...\n\nCon: Okay, that's great... I appreciate you taking the time for me.\n\nMichael: No problem at all... for our younger readers who may not be familiar with your work, could you tell us a little about yourself and your music?\n\nCon: Well, I was with Warner Brothers early on... for five years actually and then I ended up signing with MCA and got about five songs deep into an album there and had some changes in leadership at MCA. I wound up going to Capital and got about five deep into an album there and they also had a change in leadership (laughing) I was pretty active during that time, from say 1977 to 1987 to 1990. Things were not happening the way that I hoped it would be happening, so I kind of got away from making country music for awhile. So, I have done a little thing for Norro Wilson, my friend and producer, and we worked on this new album, Sweet Memories. I came to town, as he was being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. They had asked me to perform one of the songs that he had written called \"The Most Beautiful Girl\" and surprise him. I did and I kind of reacquainted myself with a lot of the folks in the business; and Norro and I got to talking and the next thing you know, we are in the studio recording again and this album, Sweet Memories, is the result of that.\n\nMichael: What are some of the reasons that led you to decide that now is the right time to go back in to country music?\n\nCon: Well, it just felt good... and I truly missed it, Michael. Having been away from it, it is my first love. I mean, I just absolutely love it! I kind of got a little bitter, when I left Nashville... you know, I kind of got away from it for a while. The longer that I was away from it, the more I realized how much I missed it. There is a lot of things going on right now, as far as music is concerned... there is room for a whole lot of different kinds of music. I felt that now was the right time for me to come back with what they call \"my style.\" What it is, is that I love country songs, but they just come out a little different, ya know? We have been having a lot of luck; I have had a lot of people who are glad to see that I am back and recording. I've been really getting a lot of great reviews on the album, as well as the single. Everything is positive and I am just so happy to be back and doing what I love.\n\nMichael: Well, to we at AngryCountry your style is pure country... and there is not enough of it going around right now.\n\nCon: Well, I appreciate that... you know, I do love country music! There is nothing better than a good country lyric. I mean, who has not lived a country lyric? I am just so appreciative of the chance to be back and having fun with it and enjoying it and really getting great response to everything.\n\nMichael: Your current single, \"Still\", was written by Bill Anderson... and as you explained on the XM Radio feature, you went to Bill for his approval of your rendition of the song. What was that experience like for you?\n\nCon: It was scary... I mean, it was really scary! (laughing) You know, Bill is a gentlemen, but when you start messing with a songwriter's song and begin changing some words around - the song around - you are kind of treading on thin ice. When I went to him and began to pitch the idea to him, I told him that I wanted his blessing before I recorded the song. Had he not liked it, I would not have recorded it that way. I had the opportunity to sit down and play it for him at his house, and he loved it. From the minute that I started the song, he absolutely loved it. He told me, \"Con, you've taken my song and made it your song. I absolutely love it and I could not be happier with the way that you have arranged it. You have my blessing!\" And so, we went into the studio and cut it and it turned out well; and like I said, we are getting a great response to it.\n\nMichael: What are some of your other favorite songs on the album?\n\nCon: I love \"Sweet Memories,\" which is the title cut written by Mickey Newbury... in fact during the recording of this particular project, I lost my mother. One of her favorite songs is \"Sweet Memories\" and another, of course, was \"Amazing Grace;\" so I dedicated this entire album to her memory and the last two cuts on the album to her. These two are favorites of mine... but, I like \"Since I Fell For You\" and \"No Relief In Sight\"... I like everything that we recorded. And of course, \"Still\" stands out because just being able to take a song and do something completely different with it... I enjoy performing it and sort of creating it. Sort of becoming a stepfather to that song, so to speak, in the studio.\n\nMichael: What would you like listeners to take away from this album? Or what is the message in the music that you choose?\n\nCon: I hope that when they listen to it they are touched... I hope that they can relate to what I have to say in my songs and I hope that they can relate to the lyrics. But more importantly, I hope that they are touched by the way that I perform it and that it's believable. I like to do songs that speak to me and songs that touch me; they are the songs that I like to do. Hopefully, I can do them in a way that speaks to and touches other people.\n\nMichael: We have a signature question that we like to ask every artist... what is the one thing that your fans would be most surprised to know about you?\n\nCon: Hmmm, that's a good one... I suppose that I have become an avid bike rider. I'm sort of into the exercise thing and watching my diet.\n\nMichael: What is it about bike riding that you have come to enjoy?\n\nCon: I just love to be able to get out... you're at a speed where you can really appreciate the beauty of your surroundings. There are a couple of trails where I ride where the views are absolutely magical. It's so inspirational and you feel like you can reach out and touch the creator.\n\nMichael: I know that your time is valuable, so I will let you go... I appreciate your taking time out of your day for AngryCountry.\n\nCon: Well, Michael, I appreciate your taking the time for me.\n\n******************************************************************************************\n\nSweet Memories\n\nTrack One: \"Over Getting Over You\"\n\nPretty heartache ballad about seeing an old flame and realizing that buried feelings remain very close to the surface.\n\nTrack Two: \"A Chance\"\n\nBeautiful ballad that speaks to the loss of a love and knowing that you can never get that love back. My favorite track on this album due to its very soulful stylings.\n\nTrack Three: \"She Ain't You\"\n\nA touch of the Blues Brothers style is brought to this track that looks at having many lovers in one's life; and yet, only that one special person captures your heart.\n\nTrack Four: \"Since I Fell For You\"\n\nI have always loved this song, but Con gives it a special touch that really makes you feel the love that one has for another.\n\nTrack Five: \"She Thinks I Still Care\"\n\nWonderful cut that addresses how one may deny their feelings, but deep down, the love that you feel for someone special cannot really be denied.\n\nTrack Six: \"That's All That Matters To Me\"\n\nA track that speaks to knowing that you may share the one you love with others, but all is right when that love is in your arms.\n\nTrack Seven: \"Don't Touch Me\"\n\nAsking that someone you adore and cannot really have not tempt you with their love... because just their simple touch will make you desire that person too much.\n\nTrack Eight: \"Something You Got\"\n\nAlmost a Sam and Dave soul touch is put on this track about the attraction one feels for a special person.\n\nTrack Nine: \"Still\"\n\nWhat can be better than a great track written by Opry legend Bill Anderson? When Con Hunley puts his soulful voice and touch on it... terrific!\n\nTrack Ten: \"If You Ever Have Forever In Mind\"\n\nPretty familiar ballad about longing for a person to settle down and love only you.\n\nTrack Eleven: \"Only Time Will Tell\"\n\nFinding that a lot of time is needed to get over a lost love. I think everyone has felt those feelings and this song sums up all those feelings.\n\nTrack Twelve: \"No Relief In Sight\"\n\nTrying everything possible to get passed a lost love ... only to find that no matter what you attempt, the pain remains.\n\nTrack Thirteen: \"Dedication To Mother\"\n\nVery touching and heartfelt explanation of Con's feelings over the loss of his own mother and why these songs meant so much to her.\n\nTrack Fourteen: \"Sweet Memories\"\n\nAbsolutely beautiful ballad and vocal that Con brings to this song about the memories that linger even after a loved one has passed on.\n\nTrack Fifteen: \"Amazing Grace\"\n\nThis old familiar standard, once again, comes alive due to the unique and very soulful touch that Con brings to the song.\n\nTotally Awesome! This is an album that receives my highest praise. I have been searching for a country artist who has the soul of my all-time favorite Motown artist, Smokey Robinson. Con Hunley is that country artist. Not only does he have the soulful vocals, but he also knows just what kind of touch to bring to a particular song. Sweet Memories is exactly the kind of album that has been missing in Nashville and on the country radio airwaves... good old \"real\" country music with lyrics that reach out and wrap around your gut. I simply cannot say how much I appreciate Con Hunley and this album, and I want to welcome him back to country music. If there was ever an album and a country artist who exemplifies what I preach on the pages of AngryCountry about \"keeping the music grounded in traditional country lyrics, \" Sweet Memories and Con Hunley are a shining example. You will want this album and will agree that this is country music at its best.\n\nNOTE: AngryCountry wishes to express our sincere thanks to Con Hunley for the time that he took to interview with us.
