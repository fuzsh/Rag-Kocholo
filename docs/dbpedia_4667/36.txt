Western Connecticut Youth Orchestra (WCYO) will host an open rehearsal on Thursday, November 4th for music teachers, youth musicians and their parents.

Participants are invited to see the WCYO in action, meet our conductors and musicians, and generally learn more about what WCYO has to offer area youth musicians. The rehearsal will be held at Scotts Ridge Middle School, 750 North Salem Rd, in Ridgefield, in the Music Wing just to the right of the main office. Face masks will be required and standard Covid-19 safety protocols will be in place.

The String Ensemble, conducted by Sasha Ono, will rehearse from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM and offers advancing violinist, violist, cellist, and double bass players in grades 5 through 9 an opportunity to focus on strengthening the various fundamentals of ensemble performance and comprehensive string instruction, and performs intermediate to advanced level traditional and contemporary repertoire.
