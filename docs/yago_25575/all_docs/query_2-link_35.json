        "text": "Posted in Movies | Parenting | Z\n\nWhen I see things changing like this, it makes me smile and feel better for Z's future.\n\nMore and more on TV there are interracial couples that aren't called out as \"The Mixed Couple.\" Sometimes it's a little played out when entire movies are created about how shocking a mixed couple supposedly is. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was ground-breaking in 1967, but Something New just pandered to racial stereotypes as did FX Network's recent reality show \"Black.White,\" succeeding in little except making both families and their respective races look ignorant. Perhaps it was a West Coast thing. It would have been interesting had they picked families from integrated neighborhoods with a little more savvy.\n\nLife and love are a lot more complicated than just Black and White. Here's a list of popular TV shows with mixed couples on right now.\n\nGrey's Anatomy, ABC, Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT\n\nThe couple: Dr. Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh; Dr. Preston Burke, played by Isaiah Washington.\n\nTheir relationship: Top surgeon falls for intern. Opposites attract.\n\nLost, ABC, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT\n\nThe couple: Bernard, played by Sam Anderson; Rose, played by L. Scott Caldwell\n\nTheir relationship: Viewers didn’t know Rose’s husband was white, but they did know she had unwavering belief in him.\n\nER, NBC, Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT\n\nThe couple: Dr. Neela Rasgotra, played by Parminder Nagra; Dr. Michael Gallant, played by Sharif Atkins.\n\nTheir relationship: She’s an ER doc; he’s just back from Iraq. Was the quickie wedding a good idea?\n\nMy Name Is Earl, NBC, Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT\n\nThe couple: Earl’s ex-wife Joy, played by Jaime Pressly; Darnell, played by Eddie Steeples.\n\nTheir relationship: He works in the Crab Shack; she’s after Earl’s lottery winnings. Earl and “Crabman” remain best buddies.\n\nThere's a great organization in Seattle called the MAVIN Foundation. It's a non-profit that is focused on celebrating the mixed race experience. It is known for its work hunting for mixed-race blood marrow donors.\n\nAbout Scott\n\nScott Hanselman is a former professor, former Chief Architect in finance, now speaker, consultant, father, diabetic, and Microsoft employee. He is a failed stand-up comic, a cornrower, and a book author.\n\nAbout Newsletter\n\nHosting By"
