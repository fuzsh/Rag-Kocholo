        "text": "James Stenson, the estranged husband of actress Parminder Nagra, filed suit against the star Thursday, claiming he is entitled to half her assets from the six years in which they were \"life partners\" before marrying in 2009.\n\nStenson's filing says he gave up a $300,000-a-year photography career to manage the couple's life when Nagra, 41, landed the role of Dr. Neela Rasgotra on \"ER\" in 2003, according to TMZ.com. Stenson claims Nagra funneled money through a shell corporation that only she controlled, and which bought three homes during their premarital relationship.\n\nStenson -- whose case recalls the famous 1977 Lee Marvin-Michelle Triola split that established the term \"palimony,\" in which the court ruled against Triola -- is asking for at least $500,000 in damages, plus half of each of the three properties.\n\nThe couple married in January 2009, a month after announcing Nagra's pregnancy. Their son, Kai David Singh Stenson, was born that May.\n\nNagra's spokeswoman did not return a request for comment."
