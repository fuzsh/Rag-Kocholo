        "text": "Abby Lockhart:\n\nWhy'd you stick me with this guy?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nWhen did everyone become such scheduling divas?\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nWell, I don't need a student. I'm better flying solo.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nIs there something wrong with him?\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nNo, he's excellent. He's very good.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nOh, no, you like him, don't you?\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nOkay, you know what...?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nYou do! You're blushing!\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nWe never had this conversation. [starts to walk away]\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nHey, haven't you had enough of doctors?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\n[Greene and Lewis discussing the hospital gossip about them] Mmm, yeah, and what is that, can I ask you? My car's in the shop, I drop Susie off at my parents, meet up with you to go tequila shopping, and all of a sudden we're having a torrid affair?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWho said it was torrid?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nNo one, I'm just assuming it would be. [Greene looks at her] That's not what I meant.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nThat's OK, I know what you meant... I'm sure it would be too... Why wouldn't it be?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\n...No reason at all. [she stares at Greene and then at her margarita] There's not enough lime in this.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nAll he did was talk about his ex for 45 minutes, who also happened to be named Susan. How much he loved her, how much he wanted to marry her, how much he wanted to have 5 or 6 children with her... Do I want children?... Do I want 5 or 6 children?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nOkay, Tad could be worse.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nI'm not even there yet, Mark. I look over, and he has this drop of red wine hanging from his nose.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWhat?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nYou heard me, this puny little blob just hanging there. So of course I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Is it gonna fall? is it gonna hang there all night? Is his skin gonna absorb it?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nHow did it get there?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nMark!\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nNo really, how do you get your nose that far into a wine glass? Was he smelling it or...\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\n[laughing] Mark, please!\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nI went to the bathroom and snuck out the window.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nYou're kidding.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nNope.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWow.\n\nCarol Hathaway:\n\nWhat were you thinking? What could you possibly have thought would happen tonight? That you would show up on my doorstep at midnight, drunk and I would find that as some sort grand gesture of love? That I would invite you back into my life, into my bed? Is that what you imagined would happen tonight? You have no right to even think about doing this.\n\nDr. Doug Ross:\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nCarol Hathaway:\n\nDo you think you love me? For how long Doug? How long till you start wondering if there isn't someone better in the next room or the next bar? How long until that little voice in your head reminds you of all the infinite 22-year-olds you could be screwing tomorrow, or the next day, or the next? I will not let you do this to me again. [exits]\n\nJohn Carter:\n\n[sighs] I thought I was gonna be sick. [pause] I'm sorry.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nDon't ever say you're sorry. See, there's two kinds of doctors... there's the kind that gets rid of their feelings, and the kind that keeps them. If you're gonna keep your feelings, you're gonna get sick from time to time - that's just how it works. [pause] Keep your head down. [pause] [squats down beside Carter] People come in here and they're sick and dying and bleeding, and they need our help. Helping them is more important than how we feel.\n\nJohn Carter:\n\n[nods]\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nBut it's still a pain the ass sometimes.\n\nJohn Carter:\n\n[laughs]\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nSometimes, I just want to quit and do somethin' else. [looks at Carter and smiles] Yeah. [pause] Why don't you take a few more minutes?\n\nJohn Carter:\n\n[nods] [whispers] Okay.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nBy the way, I was in medical school with Benton... and he used to get sick *all the time*, so... don't let him give ya any crap. You're gonna be fine.\n\nGeorge:\n\nYou'll get a lot of thank-yous from the female population over at Riverview. I don't wanna brag, but...\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nYeah? You a pretty popular guy over there?\n\nGeorge:\n\nWell, I seem to be... I never was much of a Casanova in my day. I didn't go in for all the wild positions and so forth. Ladies need that, all the positions.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nSo I've heard.\n\nGeorge:\n\nAnd the sweet talk. I was never much for that either. I was mostly meat and potatoes. But now, I'm 82, I'm a man, I'm breathing. The odds are 12-to-1 in my favor. I'm getting it any time I want. Not too bad, old age.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nI'm glad to hear it. Glad to hear it. I tell you, it feels good to save a man who's performing such a service to society.\n\nGeorge:\n\nStud service!\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\n[on the phone] I don't care if it's raining fire and brimstone, you are going to get me to that church if I have to ride on your back like a bloody donkey\n\n[hangs up angrily]\n\nIsabelle Corday:\n\nPerhaps you should eat something\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nI do not need to eat. Nor do I need a spot of tea, or a moment of quiet reflection on this, my special day. This is America, and sometimes you just have to kick some ass.\n\nIsabelle Corday:\n\nWe'll take your car and get there early.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nFine. Fine, okay. But unless you can drive stickshift on the right side of the road, I'm driving.\n\nIsabelle Corday:\n\nElizabeth, you cant possibly drive in your condition\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nGet your purse, grab the flowers, and let's go.\n\n[phone rings]\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nNow listen here, you ignorant bastard!\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nOh... Mark... nothing.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nStop spinning, stop spinning!\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nIt's all in the wrist.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nI think I pulled a muscle.\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nI think we should take a break.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nDraft please, Abby?\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nClub soda.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nOkay. So next time, I choose the sport maybe something more civilized? There's a pool table in my hotel.\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nYour hotel?\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nYeah. I don't own it. I just live there.\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nYou live in a hotel?\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nYeah, as a doctor. I take care of the tourists. They give me a break on the rent. [Abby laughs] No! It's a good deal! Maid service, laundry, amenities. [Abby gives him a pensive look] No, no! It's great. You'll have to come see it.\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\nYour hotel room.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nYeah. I mean, I mean no. I mean yes. I mean... I'd never ask such a thing from a lady. Especially after just one kiss.\n\nAbby Lockhart:\n\n[Abby Grins] No, I should hope not.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\n[Luka kisses Abby] Of course, that makes it two.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nI wanted him to die. I saw what he did to that old lady and the others before her, and I wanted him to die. I didn't think he should have that blood. I mean, if someone had come in and they really needed it... If some little kid had been hit by a car, or some old guy had been accidentally shot; if someone like that had died because we wasted the blood on that guy... I don't know. It was my decision, and I made it, and if he died, I don't know how I'd feel, but I can't say that I'm sorry. I mean, was I wrong?\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nWhat's the big hurry?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nZoe's here, she's in exam two.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\n[looks pleased] She is?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nYes, she is. Oh, and I almost forgot. She's fourteen years old.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nShut up.\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nShe was born in 1990, Ray.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\n[shocked] What?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nThat's the decade immediately preceding the one that we're in.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nAre you for real?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nYes. And in prison math, I believe fourteen equals 5 to 10?\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nWhere is she?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\n[amused] Exam two. And here's the kicker, Jerry Lee, your prepubescent penis pal has Chlamydia.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nI had no idea she was that young!\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nYoung? She's still teething. Although, I don't know, maybe you enjoy that.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nShe didn't say anything, how was I supposed to know?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nTake her out for coffee, converse with her a bit, before you start boffing and handing out house keys!\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\nI don't card my dates, okay?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nOh, well maybe it's time that you started.\n\nDr. Ray Barnett:\n\n1990?\n\nNeela Rasgotra:\n\nIt was a very good year for Chlamydia.\n\nDr. Doug Ross:\n\nI'm confused now. Your father's still alive, right? He's still with your mother.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nSo that's the criteria for a good father? Longevity?\n\nDr. Doug Ross:\n\nDid he smack you around a lot? Used to smack your mom around?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nPoor Doug.\n\nDr. Doug Ross:\n\nWait. Poor Doug? Your father, did he, did he come into your room in the middle of the night and throw up on your bed and pass out? Did he do that? Did he leave you in a hallway in Atlantic City while he screwed some hat check girl, Mark? Did he do that? Did he do that, Mark? Your father was there for you every night, you and your mother. And that's love. Now, whether it's the way you want it or not, it's love, Mark. You grew up in Ozzie and Harriet land. Get your head out of your ass.\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nI'm sorry, I should have never left you unsupervised. There are nuances in neonatal surgery. The liver's more friable in newborns.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nI wanted a clean field before I closed.\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nYeah, you said that.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nIt seemed appropriate.\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nWhat's at issue here is that you ignored my specific instructions.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nI didn't ignore anything! I followed standard operative procedure. Look, I've done it at least a dozen times in other patients.\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nThis is not \"another patient\"! This is an infant! Outside, now.\n\n[they step out of the NICU and into the hall]\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nYou don't know anything about pediatric surgery!\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nLook, I thought it was necessary -\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nAre you unwilling to learn from your mistakes?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nIt doesn't say in the text not to stitch a liver!\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nIt isn't in the text! You didn't know what the hell you were doing! The second you realized you screwed up you should have called me. Why did I find 3 stitches in there?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nBecause I tried to -\n\nDr. Abby Keaton:\n\nBecause you arrogantly and blindly think that you have all the answers! If that baby dies, it'll be my responsibility, but it'll be your fault!\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nCarol! [drops chart on desk]\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nCareful!\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nI'm having problems with Haleh.\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nSo I heard.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nI'd like you to reschedule her, so we don't have to work together anymore.\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nFrom what I hear, you're the one that needs to be rescheduled.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nSo, what does that mean? You won't do it?\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nNo, I won't. The nursing schedule is my prerogative.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nEven if that situation is endangering patient care?\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nYou work every day and every third night. Haleh's got four kids to support. When is she supposed to work?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nThe woman refuses to follow my instructions!\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nWhy should she? You're still in training, remember? She already graduated.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nOh, come on, Carol, don't give me that! I mean, we are NOT equals!\n\nNurse Carol Hathaway:\n\nLook, she may not know how to cross-clamp an aorta, but Haleh has been working in emergency medicine for twenty years, and if you would ever hop off that pedestal you've put yourself on you might see that the nurses make this place work, not you.\n\n[the lights flicker]\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nJerry!\n\nJerry Markovic:\n\nI called maintenance 4 times, they're working on it.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nOhhh, maybe it's the ghost from the 5th floor.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nNot you, too.\n\nNurse Lydia Wright:\n\nIt's a true story, Mark! It's up there!\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nPoor guy, still pining away for the woman he loved.\n\nNurse Lydia Wright:\n\nI thought he broke her heart.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nBroke his own heart is more like it.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nAnd how do you know this?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nBecause that's the story. It was Halloween night, the 1930s or something, up on the 5th floor. There was rain and thunder and lightning... he was a doctor, she was an intern...\n\nNurse Lily Jarvik:\n\nShe loved him, didn't she?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\n[nods] But a really wealthy, handsome patient had fallen in love with her, and asked her to marry him.\n\nNurse Chuny Marquez:\n\nWhat did she say?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nShe didn't know what to say. So... she told the doctor.\n\nNurse Chuny Marquez:\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nHe said nothing.\n\nNurse Lily Jarvik:\n\nI thought he loved her!\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nHe did love her, but he just stood there, he couldn't get the words out. And then, after she walked across the room, she turned back and looked at him... she put her hand to her lips, and blew him what would be their first and only kiss. They say it blew through him like a rush of cold wind.\n\nNurse Chuny Marquez:\n\nThat's so sad!\n\nJerry Markovic:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nUnfortunately, the doc fell out the 5th floor window, so that's kind of it.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWell, I'm sure they worked on him in the O.R. for awhile.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nI can't do this. I can't pretend everything's gonna be ok. Premies don't make it out of the OR.\n\nMaggie Wyczenski:\n\nLet it go. Abby, Abby. All the bad things you've seen, let it go.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nAnd I can't believe I let myself get talked into this.\n\nMaggie Wyczenski:\n\nStop it!\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nI spent a month in the NICU, I know how this ends.\n\nMaggie Wyczenski:\n\nAbby! You have a lot of great qualities, but optimism is not one of them.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n[Abby laughs] Whose fault is that?\n\nMaggie Wyczenski:\n\nYeah. Alright. I did not create a good environment for a child to grow up believing things would work out. But you're not a child any longer. You're the mother now. And that baby down there needs you to believe he's gonna be ok.\n\nDr. Donald Anspaugh:\n\nAnother round of epi! Guys, he's grey. Point 2 of epi. 10 cc's of pav, now!\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nI'm trying! I am really, really trying!\n\nNurse Samantha Taggart:\n\nI remember when Alex was 3, I took him to one of those bounce houses at the carnival. And of course, he's in there with 5- and 6-year-old kids. So he gets knocked down, right? And every time he tries to get up, he keeps getting knocked down again, and he's crying, \"Mommy! Mommy!\" And the attendant won't let me in because he thinks I'm some stupid teenager, right?\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nSo what did you do?\n\nNurse Samantha Taggart:\n\nI stood there and I cheered him on. And every time he got knocked down, I told him, \"I know you can get up.\" But that's when it hit me. They fall. And all you can do is be there and hope they keep getting up.\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver:\n\n[a female patient has complained about Pratt's breast exam] Did you TUBE her?\n\nDr. Greg Pratt:\n\nWhat? Where did you hear that?\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver:\n\nTotally Unnecessary Breast Exam. You made up the term.\n\nDr. Greg Pratt:\n\nFirst, that term has been around since I was a 3rd year med student. Second, a 35-year-old woman complaining of pain between the third and fourth rib, no evidence of muscle strain and who's never had a mammogram. What would you have done?\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver:\n\nShe said you didn't find anything. She also said you seemed to be enjoying it.\n\nDr. Greg Pratt:\n\nAnd if I had found a lesion, I would be a hero for saving her life. Besides, I did find a small cyst. Come on, Kerry; haven't you ever been turned on while giving a breast exam?\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver:\n\nI'm a woman.\n\nDr. Greg Pratt:\n\nWho dates other women. Come on, can you say it's never happened?\n\nDr. Kerry Weaver:\n\nUh, leave me out of this; no more TUBEs.\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nHe to young to go, and shouldn't even be listening to that kind of music anyways.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nI did't know you already said no.\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nLuca, I'm trying to teach him the value of a dollar and you go and give him everything that he wants.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nIt was only fifty bucks.\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nFor a concert ticket for a ten year old, NO. That's ridiculous.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nI just don't think you should be worried about money so much.\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nLook, I appreciate your generosity, but I am not going to let you start paying for everything.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nBut you don't have to pay exactly half the rent and half the bills every month, that's ridiculous.\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nYou know I've been taking care of me and Alex for 10 years on my own, I think I can handle it.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nYou know, this isn't about money at all. You're worried about losing your independence or something. And about my role in Alex's live. What are you worried you're losing control or something.\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nYou know what, you always do this.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nDo what?\n\nNurse Sam Taggart:\n\nThis! Telling me what I'm really mad about.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nMost of the time you don't know what you're really mad about. [Sam walks to the door]\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nSam, this isn't our stop.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\n[Two elderly patients start bickering] Larry, Laverne, they're all yours.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nYou think those two can handle it\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nYeah, I think they could handle a lot if you'd let them.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nThat's right you said that before.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nYou know, no disrespect Brenner, but you're making it real hard for me to respect you. You're taking the procedures away from the residents, you're not even letting them do physicals.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nThey don't know what they're doing.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nThey've been to med school.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nSo what, look you've either got it or you don't.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nExcuse me?\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nYou know what I'm talking about. Some people catch on, other people never get it.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nYeah but it's our job to train them.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nThat is sweet Greg, but it's also a complete waste of time.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nAre you serious?\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nLook, I teach people that can benefit.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nAnd what about Larry and Laverne?\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nThey're, they're adorable, and eager, and absolutely clueless. Look I could spoon feed them everything I know, and it'd just pass straight through them like a bad case of cholera.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nAnd so what do you suggest instead?\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nEncourage them to find new careers.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nI don't know where you came from, but this is a teaching hospital. So if you can't accept the fact that everybody needs to learn, then you don't belong here.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nOkay, sorry, remind me again Greg, you're not the chief of the department, right?\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nNo I'm not.\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nOkay, that's great. So you do things your way, and I'll stick with the way that works. Now, my shift's over, it's been an absolute pleasure, but I gotta go, I got a date, I got two actually. [Dr. Brenner walks out of the room]\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nHey I'm not the only one that thinks...\n\nDr. Simon Brenner:\n\nNight, Dr. Pratt\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\n[discussing what they'll need to get ready for the baby. Abby realizes that they'll need two of everything, one for her place and one for his] So if we have twins, are we going to need four of everything?\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nI'm not having twins.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nAh, identical twins run in my family.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nWhat? The chances are really small.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n[laughing] If your mutant, Croatian seed causes me to have twins, I'm going to...\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\n[grinning] Look at it from the sunny side. If we have a custody fight, each one of us can take a kid. [Abby rolls her eyes at him] Identical twins.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n[still laughing] Got it. Let's go.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n[Abby and Luka are shopping for baby things] Oh crap! [Abby pulls Luka behind a rack of clothes]\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nWhat?\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nIt's Debbie Dawkins from the pharmacy.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nWho? [he tries to look around the rack, Abby hits him]\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nDon't look! If she sees the two of us in a baby store together, holding bags of stuff, she's gonna tell everybody.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nI don't even know who she is!\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nShe knows who you are!\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nI don't think so!\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n[Abby rolls her eyes] Oh, Luka, every woman who works in the hospital knows who you are, trust me.\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\n[about Neela's dying patient Sheryl Hawkins] I know what it's like to be close to a patient, but you're not a little intern anymore and I expect you to handle bad outcomes like a professional.\n\nDr. Neela Rasgotra:\n\nWhat does that mean? That I should stop giving a damn?\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\nNo. It means that no matter how much we care, sometimes the people we try to save die.\n\nDr. Neela Rasgotra:\n\nAre you actually trying to rationalize this? 'Cause we both know you should never have left that room this morning!\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\nThat's enough. Please. There are more patients than there are doctors in this place and I can't be everywhere. None of this should be news to you, this is the job.\n\nDr. Dustin Crenshaw:\n\nThe human shish-kebab will be fine, no thanks to that incredibly imbecilic stunt of yours.\n\nDr. Archie Morris:\n\nHey, how were we supposed to know the handle would break off?\n\nDr. Dustin Crenshaw:\n\nOkay, all right, Just for fun, let's pretend that you each had even a modicum of gray matter that you somehow managed to fashion into some crude, rudimentary semblance of a brain. You would know that you never pull out something near a vital structure unless you're in the OR.\n\nHope Bobeck:\n\nWe remove foreign bodies all the time in the ER.\n\nDr. Dustin Crenshaw:\n\nPulling a vibrator out of someone's ass? Not the same thing.\n\nDr. Archie Morris:\n\nHey, hey, Dr. Bobek acted under my supervision and my orders.\n\nDr. Dustin Crenshaw:\n\nPerfect! You've got the half-wit leading the dimwit.\n\nDr. Archie Morris:\n\nLook, you obnoxious boor! The ER works damn hard for every patient we see. We acted in this guy's best interest, when no one, not even Surgery, would give him the time of day! Now, did we do something that didn't work? Yes. Fine. It happens sometimes. I will take full responsibility. But at least we got off of our asses and tried to help!\n\nDr. Dustin Crenshaw:\n\nOh, well, gold stars for the ER asses!\n\nDr. Archie Morris:\n\nHey! What is it about your need to belittle other people? Does insulting someone make you feel like a man? Bolster what little self-esteem you're clinging to? Wow, you know, I can't even begin to imagine what happened in your life, to make you the kind of person that everybody hates.\n\nDr. Dustin Crenshaw:\n\n[drops clipboard as he turns to walk away]\n\nHope Bobeck:\n\nI could kiss you right now.\n\nDr. Archie Morris:\n\nReally?\n\nHope Bobeck:\n\nHmm. Now it's gone.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nWhy is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul. To those that long for death that does not come, that search for it for more than for hidden treasure. For are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave. For sighing comes to me instead of food. My groans pour out like water. What I feared has come upon me. What I dreaded has happened to me. I have no peace, no quietness. I have no rest, but only turmoil.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n-Have the gates of death been shown to you. What is the way to the abode of light And where does darkness reside.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\n-Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth. Tell me if you know all this.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nI sometimes talk to kids about you know... stuff. So why don't we just go right over here, and if you have any questions about sex, or drugs, or alcohol, you can just shoot. I know it's hard for kids your age to talk about this stuff, but I think...\n\nCurly Weddington:\n\nWe can ask you anything?\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nYes.\n\nCurly Weddington:\n\nIs it true that if you sneeze with your eyes open, they'll pop out?\n\nLarry Weddington:\n\nCan vampires get AIDS?\n\nCurly Weddington:\n\nIf you put a penny on the El track, will the train crash?\n\nLarry Weddington:\n\nWhy can't we wear pajamas in the daytime?\n\nCurly Weddington:\n\nOur brother got a girl pregnant, but he won't marry her. Why do you think he won't?\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nOkay, am I - ? Am I being punk'd?\n\nDr. Donald Anspaugh:\n\n[during the M&M] Sit down, Lucien! You're out of line!\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\nNo. I won't sit down and I'm not out of line, I'm not out of line at all. That's a joke. Wanna know what's out of line? I'll tell you what's out of line: a system so pathetically underfunded that we have a *single* trauma attending to cover the *entire* hospital at night. That's out of line. Letting a patient bleed out in the ICU because of a *stupid* rule; that's out of line. And you wanna know what else? Wanna know what else? Sitting by and watching my resident try and hide the fact that I left her alone in the OR; that's out of line. It's all out of line.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nIt just started snowing, and you look like you're freezing.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nI am\n\nLucy Knight:\n\n[Luka walks over and drapes his coat around her] No, that's okay\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nI'm European, we like to be gallant. Are you off? I've got two tickets to the circus.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nJust coming on.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nWhat are you doing here all day?\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nNot enough as it turns out. It's never been very easy for me to be here. Sometimes I felt like I would never fit in.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nThat's something I know about. But I moved around a lot, and I'm used to it.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nBut at the beginning of every day, I've been grateful that I'm walking in here on my own choosing, and not carried in on some gurney. And at the end of the day, if I've helped just one person, it's been worth it. And that didn't happen today, and that makes me sad.\n\n[last lines]\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\n[at the hospital's rooftop] Hi.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nThought you went home.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nNo - we're on in an hour. It's better not to sleep unless you can get at least three.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nI wouldn't sleep anyway.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nThe crit's up three points, but the renal failure may be permanent. That's if she wakes up.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\n[Upset] I thought we were saving her.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nNo... we were giving her her only chance...\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nThat's not good enough!\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nIt has to be.\n\nLucy Knight:\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nSome patients get to you more than others, I know. But when you do everything that you can, sometimes even more than you thought you could, you've got to walk away knowing you fought the good fight. You fought the good fight, Lucy. [pauses] Tomorrow you'll fight another one.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nShe was my patient!\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nYes, and if I hadn't treated her, she would still be here. Now she's at home and feeling better.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nSo, that's it? This is how I'm supposed to learn? Either I do it your way or you take it away from me?\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nPratt, I'm trying to teach you the way you practice medicine here is inefficient.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nOh, and letting babies die is?\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nYou really think you saved that kid today? For what? 24-hours nursing care. He's probably gonna require a lifetime committment. Are you gonna be around to give it to him?\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nListen, I'm sorry I'm not in some mud-hut doing amputations with a pocketknife. We have the technology and expertise to give that kid a chance! What's the sense in having it if we don't use it?\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nThat kid has about a 5% chance of having a normal life. You have any idea how many other kids we could have treated with those resources?\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nI do everything I can for my patients! That's how I practice medicine. This is Chicago, not the damned Congo. Maybe you should go back to Africa.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nMaybe you should go to Africa.\n\nDr. Gregory Pratt:\n\nI know you didn't just say that to me.\n\nDr. Luka Kovac:\n\nMaybe then you'd learn that there's more to being a doctor than ordering tests and calling consults for every patient just to cover your ass.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nI can't believe they call it a tumor board.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nWhy? They discuss tumors.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nThink they'd come up with something less esoteric.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nLike what?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nI don't know, like \"You're completely boned\" board.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nI heard they used to call it the \"Poor bastard\" board, but too many people kept showing up.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nSomeone told me they tried \"Take me out back and shoot me now\" Board for awhile.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nIt didn't stick?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nNo, surprisingly.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nWhy not?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nToo many letters I guess.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nHmm. I see.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nElizabeth?\n\n[pauses]\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nWill we have this baby either way?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWhat?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nIf that man comes out, and tells me we won't beat it, will we still have the baby?\n\nDr. Elizabeth Corday:\n\nOf course.\n\n[Dr. Greene's note]\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nDear ER Gang, So here I am, out on the beach at 5:30 in the evening. Elizabeth is drinking juice, but I'm all about the Mai Tai's. The sun is going down, Rachel is dipping Ella's toes in the ocean as they head off on their quest for the perfect seashell. Weirdly enough, I find myself thinking, you know what would make this moment complete? Some jogger dropping to the sand, short of breath, so I can sweep in with a piece of bamboo to perform a nice, clean intubation, fix the guy up, and send him off with a good, simple dispo. Which I guess is my way of saying I miss you all and that dingy place. Lots of times I thought I should have chosen a different career or go into private practice, something easier, less grinding, more lucrative, but since I've been gone, I realize that outside of doing what I'm doing right now, sitting on this beach with my family, staying at County all those years, doing what we do on a daily basis was the best choice I ever made. I know what you're thinking, but trust me, it's not hard to appreciate once it's over. As much as a part of me would like to believe that the ER can't go on without me, the smarter part realizes that you are an incredible group of doctors and nurses who approach every day with such skill, compassion and thoroughness, that when it comes to patient care, I know my absence will hardly be felt. In order to leave, I had to go the way I did, but I wouldn't want any of you to think that I didn't value each of you and the years we worked together, or that I didn't have things of a more personal nature to say. Most of you, I think, have an idea of what those things might be without me writing them down, but still... Ella is laughing and waving for me. Rachel found her shell. Mark.\n\n[a footnote from Elisabeth]\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nMark died this morning at 6:04 a.m. The sun was rising, his favorite time of day. I sent this on so that you might know he was thinking of you all and that he appreciated knowing you would remember him well.\n\nNurse Shirley:\n\nAre those baked beans?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nYeah, and french fries. Oh.\n\nNurse Shirley:\n\nOoh, that's rank.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nWhat's this? Coleslaw. Ah, here's a good one, what is that? Mystery meat?\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nWhat the hell do you think you're doing operating on my patient?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\n[to Romano] Saving his life. [to himself] You jerk.\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nGet me a gown and gloves now! And Peter get your hands out of my patient.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nOkay, give me a little suction here.\n\nNurse Shirley:\n\nSucker's clogged.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nYeah, it's a cranberry.\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nGloves Shirley, gloves. [Enters OR] Where the hell is she?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nWho?\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nWho do you think? What d'you do, give her extra work to hang her up here?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nI have no idea what the hell you're talking about.\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nStep away.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nAlright. [He does so]\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nWho gave you permission to start without me?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nHe was going into septic shock.\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nYou are a resident Peter, you don't take a piss without getting permission. And where the hell's Lizzie, off doing your scut?\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nShe left an hour ago.\n\nDr. Robert Romano:\n\nWhat the hell d'you use to make this incision, a chainsaw?\n\nNurse Shirley:\n\n[to Benton] He's been drinking.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nWhat?\n\nNurse Shirley:\n\nHe's drunk.\n\nDr. Peter Benton:\n\nGo, call Anspaugh now.\n\nDr. Skye Wexler:\n\nWhat kind of creepy loser hangs out in the break room all night, second-guessing the Attendings when he's not even on the schedule? I don't know if I'm being Punk'd, or if you haze all new Attendings this way, but I don't need you double-checking my work. The only reason I am here is to make some extra cash for a surf trip. Come December, I am gone. So you can stop worrying that I'm after your job, or your promotion, or whatever you and your micropenis are so afraid of.\n\nDr. Archie Morris:\n\nHi. Archie Morris. I have no idea who you are or what you're talking about. Gotta bounce. You good?\n\nDr. Kevin Moretti:\n\nYou know why we're here? Because of war. Without it, you would be a pediatrician, or an oncologist, and I'd probably still be losing my mind in the ICU.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nWar, huh?\n\nDr. Kevin Moretti:\n\nUh-huh. Emergency medicine is actually the result of centuries of warfare. It's a field that was defined by doctors and nurses in bombed-out buildings, trying to take care of patients on dirty canvas stretchers, and performing procedures in tent hospitals that were literally hundreds of feet away from where the battles raged. And these people, our predecessors, they had a simple primary focus: survival. And down in the bunkers, they dug in deep, to try to save their patients' lives, and to try to save their own lives. And they ended up giving life to this whole new art form, this great collaborative enterprise that we still carry on today. That's why we're here.\n\nDr. Abby Lockhart:\n\nYou don't get out much, do you?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWhat Happened to your student? I thought she was gonna stick around.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nShe went up to watch Benton operate. I think she got bored.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWe're not here to entertain, Carter.\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nYou know, she seemed so interested. I was supposed to inspire those students but I don't think I did a very good job.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nInspire them? How?\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nThrough our passion. For what we do.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nPassion?\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nYeah, you know what I mean.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nCarter, you come here everyday. Sometimes you're relly cooking and sometimes you're not. But you're here everyday doing your work. One day you'll look up and, maybe, ten years will have passed. It'll be the sum total... of what you've done... that counts. Not the passion. Wanna review some of this charts?\n\nDr. John Carter:\n\nYeah.\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\nForgive me for being so slow, Skye. I'm finally getting it now.\n\nDr. Skye Wexler:\n\nGet what?\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\nThat the whole Bohemian, drifter, 'love the one you're with' thing is nothing but a bogus justification to screw *anything* that catches your eye.\n\nDr. Skye Wexler:\n\nWell... good. Good, you finally figured me out. And you're absolutely right. I've done everybody: Pratt, Morris, Gates, security guards, Mel the Roach Coach Guy. And I'm having a damn good time with Simon Brenner. We've worn the varnish right off my desk. You know, it's too bad. It really is. I was starting to let my guard down with you. [hands him a gift bag] I bought this to keep you company while I'm on my dive.\n\nDr. Lucien Dubenko:\n\nSkye...\n\nDr. Skye Wexler:\n\nGotta run, scheduled a quickie with Frank.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\n[chasing after Lewis' train, shouting] Susan! Susan! Susan!\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nMark!... My God, are you okay? You came to say goodbye?\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nNo... stay. I want you to stay.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nBut, Mark, I...\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nI love you. And I'm stupid for not saying it before.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nNo, it's OK. I knew. In a way I knew.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWe belong together. Tell me you don't feel the same.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nWe're right together.\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nMark, you are my best friend in the whole world, I don't know how I'm gonna make it without you.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nDon't go!\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nI have to. I don't belong here any more, I have a new life, it's going in a different direction.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\nSusan... I don't wanna lose you! [they kiss and Lewis boards the train]\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nI'll never forget you. [as the train pulls away] I *do* love you.\n\nDr. Mark Greene:\n\n[can't hear] What?\n\nDr. Susan Lewis:\n\nI love you!"
