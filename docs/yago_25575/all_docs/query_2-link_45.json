        "text": "Code blue! The cast of ER is reuniting for a good cause.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 13, it was revealed that George Clooney, Noah Wyle, Julianna Margulies, Anthony Edwards and other ER alums are coming together for an episode of Stars in the House. For those unfamiliar with Stars in the House, the YouTube series was created by Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley to support The Actors Fund amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe highly anticipated reunion will take place on Thursday, April 22 on the Stars in the House's YouTube channel and on People's social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Not only will the ER cast look back at their time on the beloved medical drama, their reunion will also serve as a special Earth Day episode as it will benefit the Waterkeeper Alliance.\n\nIn fact, the idea came from Gloria Reuben, who played Jeanie Boulet on ER between 1995 and 1999, and is now the president of the Waterkeeper Alliance.\n\nThe Michael Crichton-created series ran for an impressive 15 seasons on NBC between 1994 and 2009. Grey's Anatomy has since surpassed ER as the longest-running medical drama in the U.S. And, back in 2019, Clooney even quipped that they had to \"do some more\" episodes in order to beat the Shonda Rhimes series. In a way, Clooney lived up to his word.\n\nFor an update on what the cast is up to today, scroll through the images below!"
