It is with great sadness that I learned last night of the death of Dr. Michael Galant – a Military Doctor who was serving in Iraq. He was killed in the line of duty when his convoy was destroyed by a road-side bomb.

Dr Gallant is survived by his wife, Dr Neela Rasgotra – an ER doctor at County General in Chicago and his parents. His father is an active serviceman.

Michael was a character on ER, my favourite show. Every part of my being is embarrased about the fact that I was truly upset last night to learn of his death. Its a very sad state of affairs that this is how the war effects me.

It is truly amazing that I don’t think about the women and men serving across seas everyday.

I know I’ll think about it today.

RIP Micheal Gallant.
