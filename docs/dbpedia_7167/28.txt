The Best Picture winner at the 38th Academy Awards was “The Sound of Music”, starring Julie Andrews, 1964’s Best Actress winner for “Mary Poppins.” But it was Julie Christie who picked up the Best Actress award for “Darling”, also a best picture nominee.

Also nominated for Best Picture was “Doctor Zhivago” with just as many nominations (10) and wins (5) as “The Sound of Music”. The other two films nominated were “A Thousand Clowns” and “Ship of Fools”, Viven Leigh’s last film. (Simone Signoret was nominated for Best Actress for that one).

Other films of the year with multiple nominations were: “The Agony and the Ectasy”, “Cat Ballou”, “The Great Race”, “The Greatest Story Ever Told”, “Patch of Blue”, “Othello”, “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg”, “Inside Daisy Clover”, “King Rat”, “The Spy who Came in From the Cold” and “The Pawnbroker”.

In terms of top grossing films, “Thunderball” starring Sean Connery; Disney’s “That Darn Cat!” starring Hayley Mills and Dean Jones; and “Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines” with an all star cast, were right behind “The Sound of Music” and “Dr. Zhivago”.
