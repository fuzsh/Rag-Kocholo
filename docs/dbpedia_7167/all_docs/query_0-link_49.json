        "text": "Kristen Anderson-Lopez\n\nAnderson-Lopez’s path to near-EGOT is one structured by the success of her hit movie-turned-musical Frozen. The songwriter co-wrote music for the 2013 animated film, its 2019 sequel and the 2017 stage musical adaptation with her husband, Robert Lopez (who is himself an EGOT). As a result, she won an Oscar (“Let It Go”) and two Grammys (“Let It Go” and best compilation soundtrack) for the work. She also won a second Oscar for “Remember Me” from Coco and an Emmy for “Agatha All Along” from WandaVision. She was nominated for a Tony in 2018 for Frozen, but lost to The Band’s Visit.\n\nJulie Andrews\n\nThe actress needs to win a Tony Award to qualify as an EGOT recipient. She won an Oscar in 1965 for best actress as the titular role in Mary Poppins. Andrews has won three Grammy Awards. Her first was in 1965 for best recording for children for Mary Poppins. Her second was in 2011 for best spoken word album for children for Julie Andrews’ Collection of Poems, Songs and Lullabies. She was also honored with the lifetime achievement award at the 2011 ceremony. She won her first Emmy in 1973 in the outstanding variety musical series category for The Julie Andrews Hour and her second in 2005 for outstanding nonfiction series for Broadway: The American Musical. She was also nominated for an Emmy in 2021 for her voiceover role in Netflix’s Bridgerton, but lost to Maya Rudolph for Big Mouth. Andrews has been nominated for three Tonys, all in the best actress in a musical category. The first nomination was in 1957 for My Fair Lady. The second was in 1961 for Camelot. Her most recent Tony nomination was in 1996 for Victor/Victoria.\n\nBurt Bacharach\n\nThe composer, songwriter and producer, who died Feb. 8, 2023, was nominated for 20 Grammys and won six.

He was also honored with the national trustees award in 1997 and with the lifetime achievement award at the 2008 ceremony. Bacharach won three Oscars. The first two were in 1970 for best original music score for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and for best original song for “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head.” His third Oscar was won in 1981 for best original song for “Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do),” featured in Arthur. Bacharach won an Emmy in 1971 for outstanding single program for Singer Presents Burt Bacharach. The composer was nominated for a Tony in 1969 for his work for the musical Promises, Promises.\n\nHarry Belafonte\n\nThe singer and actor, who died April 25, 2023, at age 96, won two Grammy Awards and was nominated 11 times.

Belafonte also won two non-competitive Grammy Awards. The first was the President’s Merit Award in 1986, and the second was the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000.

He later won an Emmy Award in 1960 in the outstanding performance in a variety or musical program or series category for his work on The Revlon Revue. Belafonte did receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2015 Oscars, but since that’s a non-competitive award, it didn’t give him an EGOT.\n\nAlan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman\n\nThe lyricists and songwriters won their first two Grammys in 1975 for best score soundtrack for visual media and for song of the year for \"The Way We Were,\" featured in the 1973 film of the same name.

She won an Oscar for her role as Loretta Castorini in the 1987 film Moonstruck. Cher has been nominated for five Grammy Awards and won best dance recording for her album Believe, which debuted in 2000. Cher won an Emmy in 2003 in the outstanding variety, music or comedy special category for Cher: The Farewell Tour, which aired on NBC. She only needs a Tony Award to complete her EGOT. She made her Broadway debut in the 1976 play Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean as Sissy, though she has never been nominated for an award honoring her work on the stage. The Cher Show, a jukebox musical that tells the story of her early career and features her songs, debuted on Broadway in 2018, going on to win two Tonys, for best actress in a musical for Stephanie J. Block and best costume design for Bob Mackie.\n\nCommon\n\nThe performer is the first rapper to ever win Grammy, Oscar and Emmy awards.

She was nominated in the best actress and best original song categories at the 2020 Oscars for starring in, co-writing and performing the song “Stand Up” for Harriet. The song also earned her another Grammy nom.\n\nLudwig Göransson\n\nThe Swedish composer, conductor and record producer needs only a Tony win to secure his EGOT status. Göransson, a frequent collaborator with director Ryan Coogler, garnered his first of two Oscars in 2019 in the best original score category for his work on Coogler’s Marvel entry Black Panther, which also earned him a Grammy Award.
