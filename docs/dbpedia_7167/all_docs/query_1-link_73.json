        "text": "In April 2002, Oscar winning actress Julie Andrews appeared at the Arkansas Repertory Theatre. The purpose was a fundraiser for a program the Rep had at the time.\n\nThe evening consisted of reminiscences from her as well as a conversation with Anne Jansen. It included discussions of her Oscar winning role in Mary Poppins as well as her Oscar nominated turns in The Sound of Music and Victor/Victoria.\n\nFollowing the performance, there was a dinner on the Rep’s Second Stage. Though she no longer sings due to vocal chord damage following a late 1990s surgery, she did sing a childhood Cockney song about Henry VIII after Rollie Remmel sang to her a childhood song about Charles Lindbergh.\n\nWhile in Little Rock, she toured the Clinton Materials Project which was processing the papers and items from the Clinton White House in advance of the 2004 opening of the Clinton Presidential Center. She also toured Heifer International."
