        "text": "Pictured Julie Andrews and Sidney Poitier\n\nOn this day in 1965, Julie Andrews accepted an Academy Award® for her role in Mary Poppins, in what became a capper for what is now a legendary Hollywood story. In London and on Broadway, Julie had played the role of Eliza Doolittle in the stage version of My Fair Lady to great critical acclaim. And while Julie hoped she would play Eliza in the film version, Jack Warner chose Audrey Hepburn for the starring role because he felt that Julie had never done a film and was not a big enough name. Gracious as always, Julie understood and accepted why she was not chosen, and was subsequently cast to appear in a Disney film which would be shot at the same time as My Fair Lady. On this day in 1965, My Fair Lady won the Academy Award for Best Picture; however, it was that unknown actress, Julie Andrews, who flew off with the Oscar® for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her role in Mary Poppins. In her acceptance speech, Julie, with typical class and charm, thanked Jack Warner for not casting her in My Fair Lady."
