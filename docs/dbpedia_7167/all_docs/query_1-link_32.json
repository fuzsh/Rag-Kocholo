I only know where to start and that's with Mr. Walt Disney, and naturally he has the largest thank you of all. I wouldn't know where to stop. I would somehow like to try and convey my really deep gratitude and, and well, gratefulness – well I just said that, hadn't I? – for being made to feel so really welcome in this country. Thank you very much indeed."
