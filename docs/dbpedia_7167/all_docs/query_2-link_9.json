        "meta_description": "Julie and I met for the first time in 1960, when mutual friends of ours brought Julie to see me in an off-Broadway show I was doing, “Once Upon A Mattress.” She had already done “My Fair Lady,” and I was pretty much in awe. After the show that night, we all went to a restaurant and those poor guys who were with us didn’t have a prayer – Julie and I never stopped yapping. It was as if I had found my long-lost twin who some evil being had stolen at birth and stuck over there, somewhere in England. That evening kicked off what was to be (so far) a 60-year relationship… professional, and best of all… personal.",
