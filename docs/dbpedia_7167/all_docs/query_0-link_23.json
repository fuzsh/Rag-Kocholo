No actresses were included more than once — apologies to Vivian Leigh, Katharine Hepburn, and Meryl Streep.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n20. Norma Shearer (The Divorcee)\n\nOscar Winners Best Actress • Norma Shearer Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nThe Divorcee is one of the most admired films of Pre-Code Hollywood for the way in which it depicts complex relationships and sexuality. Norma Shearer carries the picture with her powerhouse performance as a socially progressive woman who gets even with her husband after he has an affair.\n\nThe subject matter of The Divorcee may not seem radical by today’s standards, but at the time, it was truly liberal.\n\nList of Best Actress Oscar Winners\n\n19. Diane Keaton (Annie Hall)\n\nBest Actress Award • Diane Keaton Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nDiane Keaton’s performance in the eponymous role of Annie Hall is one of the most iconic performances in cinema history. Annie Hall is a character that has inspired countless copycats, from personality to costume design. Keaton is a three-time Best Actress nominee but her only win was for Annie Hall.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n18. Claudette Colbert (It Happened One Night)\n\nOscar Winners Best Actress • Claudette Colbert in It Happened One Night\n\nIt Happened One Night is just one of three movies to ever win the “Big 5” Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenplay (Original or Adapted).\n\nOf all of the performances in the film, Colbert’s is perhaps the most lauded — which is ironic because she reportedly hated working on the film. Many film historians say that Colbert’s “scandalous” performance in It Happened One Night fast-tracked the implementation of the Hays Code.\n\nList of Best Actress Oscar Winners\n\n17. Olivia de Havilland (To Each His Own)\n\nBest Actress Award • Olivia de Havilland Oscar Reunion\n\nOlivia de Havilland won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in To Each His Own in 1946. Three years later she won the same honor for her performance in The Heiress.\n\nOlivia De Havilland and Joan Fontaine are just one of two pairs of siblings who have won Academy Awards for acting — the other pair was Lionel Barrymore and Ethel Barrymore. Olivia de Havilland died in 2020 at the age of 104.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n16. Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich)\n\nBest Academy Award Actresses • Julia Roberts Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\n2001 was a stacked year for the Best Actress category at the Academy Awards. Joan Allen, Juliette Binoche, Ellen Burstyn, and Laura Linney all gave great performances, but it was Julia Roberts who took home the top honor.\n\nJulia Roberts is captivating in the title role of Erin Brockovich, playing the woman who exposed a massive corporate cover-up.\n\nList of Best Actress Oscar Winners\n\n15. Jane Fonda (Klute)\n\nBest Actress Oscar • Jane Fonda on Klute\n\nJane Fonda has received plenty of praise for her acting, but her performance as the prostitute Bree Daniels in Klute is probably her most acclaimed work. Fonda won her first of two Academy Awards for Best Actress for her work in Klute — the second was for Coming Home.\n\nJane’s father Henry Fonda won the Academy Award for Best Actor ten years after her win for Klute.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n14. Katharine Hepburn (Morning Glory)\n\nWho Won Best Actress in 1932? • Katharine Hepburn in Morning Glory\n\nKatherine Hepburn’s cadence defined an era of cinema. When I think of “old-time talkies,” I think of Katherine Hepburn’s nasally voice. It’s for this reason why her performance in Morning Glory is still referenced in pop-culture today.\n\nHepburn won more Best Actress Oscars than any other actor, for her performances in Morning Glory, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, The Lion in Winter, and On Golden Pond.\n\nList of Best Actress Oscar Winners\n\n13. Charlize Theron (Monster)\n\nOscar Winners Best Actress • Charlize Theron Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nCharlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Patty Jenkins’ directorial debut Monster. To call Theron’s performance unsettling would be an understatement — it’s downright terrifying.\n\nMonster is a nuanced film, full of complex characters and themes, but it would’ve never gotten the exposure that it did if not for Theron’s performance.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n12. Hilary Swank (Boys Don’t Cry)\n\nWho Won Best Actress in 1999? • Hilary Swank Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nHilary Swank won her first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Boys Don’t Cry. In the film, Swank portrays Brandon Teena, a trans-man who was murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska in 1993.\n\nFive years after the release of Boys Don’t Cry, Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for Million Dollar Baby.\n\nList of Best Actress Oscar Winners\n\n11. Julie Andrews (Mary Poppins)\n\nWho Won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1962? • Julie Andrews Looks Back on Marry Poppins\n\nHow could we not put Julie Andrews on this list? Her performance as Mary Poppins in Robert Stevenson’s 1962 film of the same name is perhaps one of the most iconic performances in cinema history.\n\nIf Andrews’ performance wasn’t impressive enough on its own, let’s remember that it was also her feature film debut. Andrews was primarily a theater actor prior to the release of Mary Poppins.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n10. Joan Fontaine (Suspicion)\n\nOscar Winners Best Actress • Joan Fontaine Reflects Back on Her Oscar Win\n\nDid you know that Joan Fontaine is the only actor to win an Academy Award for their performance in a Hitchcock movie? Can we acknowledge how insane that is? No win for James Stewart in Vertigo, Cary Grant in North By Northwest, or Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.\n\nThat’s not to discredit Fontaine — she was great in Suspicion starring across Cary Grant. It’s just amazing that no actors were honored by the Academy for their performances in Hitchcock films other than Fontaine.\n\nBest Academy Award Actresses\n\n9. Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest)\n\nWho Won Best Actress in 1975? • Louise Fletcher Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nNurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is one of the most “hateable” characters of all-time. In many ways, she’s a perfect villain — just completely insidious, maniacal, and rotten to the core.\n\nLouise Fletcher played the character with total control, and made her idiosyncrasies seem effortless. Any and every actor should consider studying her performance if they’re preparing for an antagonistic role.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n8. Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine)\n\nWho Won Best Actress in 2013? • Cate Blanchett on Blue Jasmine\n\nThere aren’t many Woody Allen movies that I’d call “haunting” but Blue Jasmine may be the exception. Blue Jasmine follows the story of a woman who loses everything, including her sanity, after a rough divorce.\n\nCate Blanchett is magnetizing in the title role, dominating the screen with an anxious energy we rarely see portrayed so excellently.\n\nBest Academy Award Actresses\n\n7. Ingrid Bergman (Gaslight)\n\nWho Won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944? • Ingrid Bergman in Gaslight\n\nDid you know that the term “gaslighting” comes from Patrick Hamilton’s play Gaslight, which was adapted into a film of the same name by George Cukor?\n\nThree-time Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman stars in the film-version of Gaslight as a young woman who’s psychologically manipulated by her husband into thinking she’s gone insane.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n6. Julianne Moore (Still Alice)\n\nBest Actress Oscar Winners • Julianne Moore Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nJulianne Moore’s performance in Still Alice is heart-breaking. And when I say heart-breaking, I mean bone-chilling, tear-inducing, heart-breaking. There are no words that can describe the emotional weight that defines the silence of Alzheimer’s.\n\nMoore reportedly researched Alzheimer’s extensively for the role, which paid dividends for her performance. We’re not often gifted performances of the same emotional magnitude as Moore’s in Still Alice.\n\nBest Actress Oscar List\n\n5. Audrey Hepburn (Roman Holiday)\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress • Audrey Hepburn Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nI won’t go so far as to say that Roman Holiday is a perfect movie, but it comes pretty darn close. Audrey Hepburn stars as a royal princess who longs to be treated like a regular person. When she escapes into the night, she finds that ever elusive connection with a newspaperman, played by Gregory Peck.\n\nFor many, Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday is the definition of beauty — don’t sell her acting chops short though. You’d be a fool to say she’s incapable of executing in a leading role.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n4. Sophia Loren (Two Women)\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress • Sophia Loren Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nSophia Loren was the first actor or actress to win an Oscar for a foreign language performance. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Loren is one of the most underappreciated actors of all-time. I’d venture to say that if she had been given better roles in Hollywood, she’d be regarded as one of the top two or three actors ever.\n\nTwo Women is a brutal war-time film from Vittorio De Sica, which features great performances from Loren and French New Wave star Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\nBest Actress Oscar List\n\n3. Meryl Streep (Sophie’s Choice)\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress • Meryl Streep Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nMeryl Streep has been nominated for more Academy Awards than any other actor. Think about that for a second — a serious case could be made that Streep is the greatest actor, man or woman, living or dead, to ever grace the screen. She’s been nominated for 21 Academy Awards, including 17 nominations for Best Actress.\n\nFor her performance in Sophie’s Choice, Streep was awarded her first Best Actress Oscar. Many critics regard Streep’s performance in the film as Holocaust survivor Sophie Zawistowski as one of the greatest film performances of all-time.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress\n\n2. Elizabeth Taylor (Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?)\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress • Elizabeth Taylor Wins Best Actress Oscar\n\nIf you’ve never seen Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, I recommend you go watch it — for better or worse, I can definitively say, there’s nothing like it. Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was a Broadway play before it was a 13-time Oscar nominated film.\n\nTaylor received critical acclaim for her performance in the role of Martha. Few people thought Taylor was a good fit for the character because of her natural beauty, but she put on 30 pounds to quite literally grow into the role.\n\nBest Actress Oscar List\n\n1. Vivien Leigh (A Streetcar Named Desire)\n\nAcademy Award for Best Actress • Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire\n\nThere aren’t many roles in film or theater that are harder to “pull off” than Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. As an audience, we’re simultaneously sympathetic to her plight but repulsed by her actions.\n\nVivien Leigh strikes a tremendous balance between Blanche’s two polar extremes. There’s no doubt about it, her performance is simply masterclass. The scenes with her and Marlon Brando are some of the most explosive in cinema history.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAcademy Award for Best Director\n\nNow that we’ve reviewed all of the Academy Award winners for Best Actress and some of their best works, let’s do the same with Oscar winning directors.
