        "text": "In 1929, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences began awarding on- and off-screen filmmakers for their annual achievements. Each year, standout films and the people who make them happen are honored with golden statues and coveted titles, including the highly sought-after Best Actress award.\n\nEach year, another woman is added to the historical list of actresses who've claimed the Oscar. From four-time winner Katharine Hepburn to 17-time nominee (and two-time winner) Meryl Streep, see every leading lady who added her name to Hollywood history by winning the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\n2023: Michelle Yeoh, Everything Everywhere All at Once\n\nYeoh made history as the first Asian actress to win in the category for her leading performance as Evelyn Wang in the absurdist action film. Everything Everywhere All at Once also won the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\n2022: Jessica Chastain, The Eyes of Tammy Faye\n\nChastain won for her portrayal of the late televangelist personality in this biographical film.\n\n2021: Frances McDormand, Nomadland\n\nMcDormand's award-winning character, Fern, sells her possessions and embarks on a nomadic life, driving a van around the country after the death of her husband. This marked McDormand's third Best Actress win.\n\nNomadland also received the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\n2020: Renée Zellweger, Judy\n\nZellweger retold the life and career of a Hollywood icon in the Judy Garland biopic.\n\n2019: Olivia Colman, The Favourite\n\nColman won for the role of Queen Anne, the real-life ruler of Great Britain in the 18th century.\n\n2018: Frances McDormand, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nWinning her second of three Best Actress accolades, McDormand became the aggrieved mother Mildred Hayes, whose daughter was raped and murdered. In the film, McDormand's character demands a thorough investigation of the crimes that took her daughter's life.\n\n2017: Emma Stone, La La Land\n\nIn the romantic musical set in Los Angeles, Stone played (and won as) aspiring actress Mia Dolan.\n\n2016: Brie Larson, Room\n\nLarson took home the Oscar for her performance of a young woman who escapes the captivity in which she and her son (played by Jacob Tremblay) have been held for years.\n\n2015: Julianne Moore, Still Alice\n\nMoore won for her performance as Alice, a linguistics professor diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\n2014: Cate Blanchett, Blue Jasmine\n\nBlanchett nabbed the Best Actress award thanks to her leading role in Woody Allen's film about a New York City socialite who has fallen on hard times.\n\n2013: Jennifer Lawrence, Silver Linings Playbook\n\nThough she famously (and elegantly) tripped on the stairs as she made her way up to the Oscars stage, Lawrence accepted the award for her starring role as Tiffany, a young widow struggling with her mental health.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n2012: Meryl Streep, The Iron Lady\n\nStreep won for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the biographical drama of the first female British Prime Minister.\n\n2011: Natalie Portman, Black Swan\n\nPortman earned the Best Actress award for her lead performance as Nina Sayers, a professional dancer who suffers a nervous breakdown under the pressure of her lead role as the White Swan in the famed ballet Swan Lake.\n\n2010: Sandra Bullock, The Blind Side\n\nIn the big-screen adaptation of this true story, Bullock played Leigh Anne Tuohy, the resolute Southern mother who adopts teen Michael Oher.
