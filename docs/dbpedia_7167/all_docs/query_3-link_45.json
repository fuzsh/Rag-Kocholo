        "text": "That distinct voice, regal aura, beauty and class are all of the things that define Julie Andrews — on top of her great success in movies and TV shows for more than 75 years.\n\nBorn Julia Elizabeth Wells in 1935, Andrews showed musical talent at a very young age, starting to sing in her mother and step-father’s music hall act at only 10-years old. Throughout her adolescence and young adulthood, she continued to hone her craft both on the stage and screen.\n\nBy 1954, she was making her Broadway debut in The Boy Friend, with stage roles continuing in the wake. In the subsequent years, she made appearances on TV and had roles in television movies like Cinderella (1957) and The Gentle Flame (1959), but it was 1964’s Mary Poppins that launched her to fame and earned her an Academy Award for her performance.\n\nFrom there, her success only continued. Here, take a look at our 10 favorite Julie Andrews movies and TV shows.\n\nJulie Andrews movies and TV shows, ranked\n\n10. The Tamarind Seed (1974)\n\nJudith (Julie Andrews) has a job in the civil service, and while on vacation in the Caribbean, she meets a man and finds herself falling for him. The twist? He’s a Russian agent.\n\n9. S.O.B. (1981)\n\nFelix is a film director whose latest and most expensive film to date is a complete flop. Wildly unsatisfied with the state of his life and career, he pulls himself from the trenches he’s in and re-imagines the original vision for his failed film.\n\nInstead of the family friendly flick he had pictured, he decides to re-shoot it as an adult rated film, meaning his lead star (Julie Andrews) with a good girl image has to make some bold moves — in less clothing than she’s used to.\n\n8. Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967)\n\nRoaring twenties-era Millie (Julie Andrews) has ambitions of marrying wealthy, but this mission she’s set out on isn’t as straightforward as she imagined it’d be.\n\n7. Bridgerton (2020 —)\n\nThough she only lends her voice to this wildly popular series, she does so well enough that not including it on the list would be blasphemous.\n\nBridgerton chronicles the lives of the Bridgerton children, all seeking love in regency era England. While each season follows the intricacies of a new character’s personal and romantic lives, Julie Andrews’ narration remains consistent as always!\n\n6. Duet for One (1986)\n\nStephanie (Julie Andrews) is an accomplished violin player whose ambitions are shattered when she is diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. On top of her life-altering diagnosis, she’s forced to deal with a number of other obstacles in her life.\n\n5. The Americanization of Emily (1964)\n\nAn American Navy officer, Lt. Commander Charlie Madison, is a cynic who does what he can to ensure his contentment and overall comfort. This all changes when he meets Emily (Julie Andrews), an Englishwoman, and is also sent by his commanding officer on a dangerous mission.\n\n4. Victor/Victoria (1982)\n\nIn Victor/Victoria, Julie Andrews is a singer in Paris struggling to make ends meet. The solution? She pretends to be a man, impersonating a woman. Confused yet? While some might buy the ruse, others don’t — and it gets complicated when her character is the object of a Chicago gangster’s affections.\n\n3. The Princess Diaries (2001) Julie Andrews movies and TV shows\n\nMia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is an ordinary teen who is shocked to learn that she’s a princess. Traveling to Genovia, she is taken under the wing of her grandmother, the Queen of Genovia (Julie Andrews), as she shows her the ropes of royal life.\n\n2. Mary Poppins (1964) Julie Andrews movies and TV shows\n\nWhen Jane and Michael’s parents put out an advertisement for a new nanny, they don’t expect the arrival of Mary, a charming, magical woman. While in her care, they embark on adventures of a lifetime together.\n\n1. The Sound of Music (1965) Julie Andrews movies and TV shows\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UY6uw3WpPzY?si=HKxTG7syNRDHozdI\n\nJulie Andrews plays the role of Maria, who is sent by her convent to be the governess of seven children, who make up the von Trapp family. As she spends more time in her role, Maria brings a joy into the home that had been missing. Meanwhile, she finds herself falling in love with the children’s widowed father."
