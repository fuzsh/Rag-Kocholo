Travers, the author of the book Mary Poppins, who encouraged her.\n\nWhile the production was ongoing, her family lived in a house in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, rented by Disney exclusively for them.\n\nMary Poppins was a huge success and was considered the biggest box-office draw in Disney history and nominated for thirteen Academy Awards, winning five of them.\n\nShe also auditioned for the musical, The Sound of Music.\n\nAlthough filming became a challenge due to weather conditions, The Sound of Music was also one of the most successful films in history.\n\nJulie Andrews also starred in two expensive musical films considered flops, Star! and Darling Lili.\n\nIn her active years as an artist, Julie Andrews has proven that she is a very versatile actress by performing in comedy and drama films which gained her awards and nominations.\n\nShe also wrote books and autobiographies such as Home: A Memoir of My Early Years (2008) and Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years (2019).\n\nMarriage\n\nOn May 10, 1959, Julie Andrews married Tony Walton and had a daughter Emma Walton Hamilton, now an author.\n\nHowever, in 1968, the couple divorced.\n\nA year after, she married Blake Edwards, who had two children, Jennifer and Geoffrey.\n\nThey also adopted two Vietnamese children, Amy and Joanna.\n\nBlake Edwards died on December 15, 2010, after 41 years of marriage.\n\nJulie Andrews’ Voice\n\nJulie Andrews was always praised for her voice due to its pure and clear sound.\n\nShe was told to pursue opera music, but instead, she chose musical theatre as she thought it suited her voice more.\n\nIn 1997, she developed hoarseness in her voice, which forced her to quit Victor/Victoria stage play and had surgery to remove the nodules in her throat.\n\nHowever, she found out that the hoarseness in her voice was due to the strain caused by performing in Victor/Victoria.\n\nIn 1999, she sued Mount Sinai Hospital, Scott Kessler, and Jeffrey Libin, the doctors who performed surgery on her, for malpractice, as it had permanently damaged her voice.\n\nShe had undergone four operations in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) by Steven M.
