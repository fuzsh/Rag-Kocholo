It was the first movie I ever made and so I thought, ‘I don’t really feel worthy of this.’\n\n“So I stuck it up in my attic for a while. But it’s now beautifully displayed in my office.”\n\nFellow guest Reese Witherspoon said that she empathised, as she had once “tucked away” her own Best Actress Oscar for the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line.\n\nThe 20 greatest movie musicals\n\nShow all 20\n\n“I felt like it was a little… showy-offy [to have it on display],” Witherspoon said. “And then I went through some personal stuff and I was like, ‘You know what, I’m putting it in the front living room! I might make it into the doorbell! I’m not gonna pretend I don’t have this anymore.’”\n\nWhile Witherspoon did not elaborate on her “personal stuff”, she and former husband Ryan Phillippe announced their separation in October 2006, seven months after she won her Oscar.\n\nAndrews won her Oscar for Mary Poppins in 1965, before being nominated twice more for The Sound of Music in 1966 and Victor/Victoria in 1983.\n\nShe is currently promoting her new autobiography Home Work, which chronicles her career in Hollywood.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
