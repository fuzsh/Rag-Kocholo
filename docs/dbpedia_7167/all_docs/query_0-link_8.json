        "meta_description": "One of the most beloved performers in the world, Julie Andrews made her Broadway debut at age 18 in The Boy Friend. Historic successes followed in the original productions of My Fair Lady and Camelot. She won the Oscar for Best Actress in her first film, playing the title role in Mary Poppins. Perhaps the greatest triumph of her career came with the leading role in The Sound of Music, one of the most popular motion pictures of all time. Her crystalline singing voice, wholesome appeal, natural elegance and sly humor made her a top box office draw around the world. In 1989, she became the first actress to receive the special Tribute Award of the British Academy for Film and Television. Over the course of her career she has also won five Golden Globe Awards, including two for World Film Favorite, and one for her performance in the filmVictor/Victoria, a role she reprised for an acclaimed run on Broadway in 1995. She has enjoyed continued success in films such as The Princess Diaries. Over 30 years ago, she embarked on a second career as an author of children's books, includingThe Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles and the popular Dumpy the Dumptruck series. She was named a Dame Commander of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000 in recognition of her extraordinary career and her service to charities such as UNIFEM and Save the Children.",

        "text": "Let’s go back to the beginning. Could you tell us about Walton-on-Thames? What was that like when you were growing up?\n\nJulie Andrews: Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, which is where I was born, is about 20 miles south-southwest of London, and when I was very young it was just a country stop on the railway line and it is now part of Greater London and very much suburbia. And I know the ins and outs of it, but there are very few places that you recognize in terms of the way it used to be. But, it’s a very sweet place. It’s sort of the middle village between a very up-market village and a very low, poverty village, at least in the early days.\n\nWhat did your parents do?\n\nJulie Andrews: My real father was a school teacher. He taught practical crafts and English and math. My mother remarried when I was about four or five years old, so I then went to live with my mum and stepfather, and he was a fine tenor, he had a singing voice. He was from Canada, from Toronto. He joined forces in more ways than one with my mother in that she was a really wonderful pianist and probably should have been a performing concert pianist but, in fact, due to circumstances and the war and tremendous poverty and things like that, they became part of a vaudeville act. And consequently, I knew nothing else but that, and to their amazement, I think, they discovered when I was about eight years old — my stepfather, I think in an attempt to become a little closer to me, decided to give me some singing lessons because my school had closed down because of the escalation of the war. And, I think he thought it would just sort of “keep me quiet,” so to speak. And, they discovered that I had this four-octave soprano voice, which surprised them since it was my stepfather who sang, not my real dad at all. And so, I knew nothing but vaudeville — music hall — gradually began to appear with my mum and my stepdad and tour the halls, and made a fairly important, for me, debut when I was about 12 years old.\n\nBefore we get to the debut, is it true that you made an appearance on stage at age two?\n\nJulie Andrews: You’ve done your homework! Yes, my mother was the pianist. My aunt was a dancer and they were two extraordinary ladies. I’d love to write about them one day. My aunt founded a dancing school, which she ran for almost 50 years in Walton-on-Thames. She would put on her local shows and that was when I think I made my real first debut. I think I was either Winken, Blinken or Nod, one of the three.\n\nNo speaking role?\n\nJulie Andrews: No speaking role but probably a lot of bouncing about in a baby suit of some kind.\n\nSo really there was never a time that you weren’t on stage?\n\nJulie Andrews: Not really. I enjoyed it immensely.\n\nYou mentioned that at 12 you had an important stage debut. That was a very successful show, wasn’t it?\n\nJulie Andrews: Well, it was a sophisticated London revue and it was at a theater which is no longer there. It was called the London Hippodrome, and it’s now just a sort of nightclub in Lester Square, London. But, it was a very beautiful theater and I was literally the smallest person on the bill. And because it was so sophisticated, the producers thought perhaps it wasn’t right that I would be singing in this show and the night before we opened they decided that they couldn’t use me. And, of course, my mom being somewhat of a stage mum, sort of said, “No, you can’t do this to this child. It’s her great debut,” and so on. And so, she and my stepfather and their agent descended on the poor producer and they said, “She’ll sing a much more difficult song and you’ll see.” And so, I auditioned for a much more difficult song and the end result was that I was in the show, stayed in the show, and on opening night the audience went crazy, and it was a complete standing ovation. The first thing I had ever really done. The first time I had ever really tried anything that important. And, the press followed me home. You know, the kind of thing when you’re a young fluke in a way, and that was the beginning of a very busy few years right through my teens of touring and radio and early, early television and so on.\n\nWhat was the name of that show?\n\nJulie Andrews: The name of the show at the London Hippodrome was Starlight Roof. And it starred English performers: Vic Oliver, Fred Emney, Pat Kirkwood, all very talented. Patricia Kirkwood was a very glorious looking lady with wonderful long legs. She was the leading lady in every sense.\n\nYou mentioned that the schools had shut down during the war. Does that mean there was really no school to go to?\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes. There was a lot of evacuation going on at that time. All the children were being evacuated into the country. I was, too, for a while. The air raids towards the end of the war particularly were coming so fast and furiously — with the doodlebugs (buzz bombs) as we called them — that no housewife could get anything done and everything just ground to a halt for a while.\n\nAnd then, were you eight when you met another voice teacher?\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes. My stepfather was very smart, in that he knew he didn’t have the ability to teach, and because it was such a very young voice, but such a sort of oddly powerful one, he knew that he had to put me in good hands if he could. And so, he took me to his teacher who was a very fine dramatic soprano, an English dramatic soprano. She’d done a lot of Handel. I can’t even think of the right word at this point. But, she was a very gentle woman and I was with her for most of my early life. Only when I went to Broadway did I kind of not work with her, and of course I prepared with her to go to Broadway, but she didn’t actually come with me. But, the foundation that she gave me and the technique — the technical foundation — was terrific.\n\nWhat was her name? Did she have anything to do with the diction that you’re famous for?\n\nJulie Andrews: Her name was Lillian Stiles-Allen and she had an extraordinary voice. A voice much like Kirsten Flagstad or Birgit Nilsson, that wonderful kind of fluted sound that comes out of those extraordinary dramatic sopranos. She firmly believed — and taught me — that your voice would hold up for you if you were true to your words. She said there could be people in the audience that needed to see what you were saying, because maybe they were hearing impaired in some way. But more than anything, she said if you relied on those words the voice would come through for you. In other words, be true to your vowels, be true to the consonants that were strong, and not in a kind of glottal way but just really use them as stepping stones to a good foundation for a voice. She was absolutely right.\n\nWhat else did she teach you?\n\nJulie Andrews: I sang in those days a lot of sort of opera and operetta. I felt that I knew, and I believe that I was right, that I really didn’t have the voice for it. My own voice was very white, very, very thin, and I was able to do these incredible sort of gymnastics with it, tremendous sort of calisthenics, but in a coloratura way, and it was so high that dogs for miles around would howl when I took some of the high notes on. But, she gave me the groundwork of opera and she always said, “Go beyond your reach. If you’re doing something light, practice something even more difficult. Practice it a tone up so that when the night comes and you have to sing it, it is so within your range.” And for many, many years I did that.\n\nThat’s sounds like a baseball player who practices batting with two bats so when he’s holding one it’s very light.\n\nJulie Andrews: Exactly. Yes, very similar.\n\nAt this point were you still close to your real father?\n\nJulie Andrews: Oh, yes.\n\nWhat did he teach you?\n\nJulie Andrews: My dad was a very special human being. He had an innate decency. It didn’t come from…he was very bright. He was a nature-loving man. He treated all of us in the family — including his first wife’s other children — he treated us all the same, and as beloved equals. And, we knew he was special. I mean, obviously any dad to a young girl is special if he does all the right things, and my dad certainly did, but he’s the one that instilled in me any true reality in my life because on the one side I had this mad upbringing of vaudeville and touring a great deal and very little schooling. My father was the one that took me on nature walks, took me to the swimming baths, taught me how to swim, took me down to the seaside in freezing cold weather and we dipped in the sea. We climbed the local hills, and he gave me a love of books.\n\nWhat books did he introduce you to?\n\nJulie Andrews: When I went to see him he would read to me and he would pick what he thought would be appropriate. Alice in Wonderland and things like that when I was a child. He would buy books for me. I didn’t see him all that much, strangely enough. Occasionally, for a two-week period in the summer holiday maybe, or a visit over Christmas. Or he’d come for a weekend and take me and we’d get on our bicycles and ride for 15 miles to get to his place. But what he did give me was always exactly right. Just the memory of him sitting and reading to me was enough to make me love listening to books and the spoken and written word.\n\nOther than Alice in Wonderland, are there any books that you truly remember loving as a kid?\n\nJulie Andrews: There was a book that he gave me. It’s interesting that you ask that. Obviously Wind in the Willows, and all the classic children’s books, but there was a little book that we found and he leafed through it, and he said, “Here you are, darling. I think you’ll like this.” And, it was a very small children’s novel called The Little Grey Men, by an English author called “B.B.” And it was a very simple nature tale of the last four gnomes left on this earth in England. Very much like Watership Down, that kind of big nature study, and it was set in four seasons. It was a terrific adventure story. I swallowed it up and it went out of print. And, I subsequently have started my own imprint at Harper Collins and it’s coming out this fall. I’m bringing it back again and I’m absolutely delighted about it. It’s one of our mission statements is to bring back books that are worthy of a revisitation in a way, and this is the first one. And, I write about it as a little chapter before it begins.\n\nYou’ve become an author yourself, so that must be the influence of your dad.\n\nJulie Andrews: That book probably influenced me as much as anything, that and my dad. Yes, absolutely. And obviously Dickens and Goldsmith and oh gosh, so many. Jane Austen obviously and the Brontë sisters and so on.\n\nI also loved to scribble as a kid. I loved to write and eventually, because I didn’t have a formal education, a governess was found for me who traveled with me wherever I went, because touring in vaudeville you’re a week in one place, a week in another, and you could not settle into any school. So, I had this wonderful lady who traveled with me who quickly recognized that if she wanted me to do anything, all she had to do was say, “Do this first and then you may write your story,” whatever story I was going to write because that was obviously what I loved to do most of all. She was a very gentle, very kind lady, and I loved her.\n\nWhat was her name?\n\nJulie Andrews: Her name was Gladys Knight.\n\nShe didn’t go on to become a famous soul singer?\n\nJulie Andrews: No, not that one!\n\nIt’s interesting that you had a governess and famously played governesses. Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp. You knew what it was like to be a governess.\n\nJulie Andrews: She wasn’t that kind of a governess. She was a lot older. Sort of a retired teacher who then became a private tutor. Nevertheless, I guess I must have picked up a few things from her, yes.\n\nDid you ever miss having a normal education and a normal childhood?\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes, I did. I was too foolish in my teens and too busy to fight for it. My mother said, “I think we’ll probably quit school, you’re going to get a much bigger education out there,” and indeed I did, of a sort, but especially as I got older, I really regretted not having a college education. I would have loved that.\n\nThere’s also the socialization value of being with other kids.\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes. I’m not complaining about it. I have retained some very close friends from my home village, but actually I didn’t have many peers, not young friends in those days. It was all mostly adults because of the touring, because of the vaudeville. But, the kind of education I was getting was that strange one of standing in the wings and watching phenomenal performers performing every week, every night, watching everything from comedians, to jugglers, to animal acts and different kinds of comedians and dancers, and it was extraordinary. I didn’t think I was getting an education at the time. It’s only in retrospect that I realize that that stood me in very good stead in my later years.\n\nYou also made a television debut in your teens too, didn’t you? Wasn’t there a show with Stanley Holloway in 1949?\n\nJulie Andrews: On TV or radio? That’s a very good question. The Stanley Holloway one I don’t remember, not until My Fair Lady, when we worked together on Broadway. But I did quite a lot of radio shows, and I did do some very early TV shows but I can’t actually remember specifically what they were.\n\nIt was very early for the history of television as well.\n\nJulie Andrews: It was.\n\nIs it true that you supported your parents financially for a while after they retired?\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes, I did. We all came from such humble beginnings. It’s amazing. It has always staggered me. I wish I could write about it one day. I’d like to try.\n\nMy mother made such a quantum leap from her extremely humble beginnings to being considered — certainly in our local village — fairly big-time for being on radio and touring as she did, and playing the piano so beautifully. And then the next leap that I made, and in like three generations. It’s hard to imagine that it’s possible, but it was because my mother really came from — her mother was just a “below-stairs” maid at the local big mansion, and I don’t think in her lifetime saw any wealth of any kind, and worked continuously and hard. Her father was a manager of one of the coal mines up in the north of England and he was a pit manager, albeit a talented man, somewhat of a poet and a musician. He played the piano very well also and taught my mother to play in the early years.\n\nWere there any singers?\n\nJulie Andrews: No, that’s the extraordinary thing. I do not know where that came from, but I’m very glad it did.\n\nWe all are.\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes, thank you.\n\nCould you tell us about how you came to be cast in The Boy Friend and the impact that had on your career? You were performing in the pantomime Cinderella, weren’t you?\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes. By now I had toured England, endlessly, and I had done a lot of Christmas shows, which in England are called pantomimes. I’m not sure how many Americans are aware of English pantomime. It’s a rip-roaring Christmas festival, usually based on one of the great fairy stories, like Cinderella, Jack in the Beanstalk, Red Riding Hood, all the great fairy stories. They throw in music and slapstick and every year they are reworked and revamped to accommodate whatever talent is brought into that particular show.\n\nI had sort of gone as far as I could go and was playing in a very beautiful production of Cinderella at the London Palladium. That was it in those days. That was about as far as one could go, because although Noel Coward and Gertrude Lawrence, and people like that had gone on to write and to perform in many things, other than another man called Ivor Novello, there wasn’t a lot going on in England in my teens. And suddenly…\n\nI was recommended by a very kind woman called Hattie Jakes, who appeared in one of my radio series — recommended that the director of The Boy Friend come and see me in Cinderella. The Boy Friend was a hugely popular English show that had been running in London for about a year. It was sort of a little, light, frothy musical, a sort of pastiche of the 1920s. And they were going to take it to Broadway with a brand new company. They weren’t going to touch the original English company because they were doing too well and still selling to packed houses. So, the director of the English Boy Friend came to see me and subsequently brought the American producer, and I was asked if I would like to come to Broadway to be in The Boy Friend.\n\nThis was Cy Feuer?\n\nJulie Andrews: Cy Feuer, yes. And Ernie Martin was his partner.\n\nDid they already have big names on the stage?\n\nJulie Andrews: Oh yes, they did. They had done Guys and Dolls. They did Can-Can and Silk Stockings.\n\nSo this was a huge break for you?\n\nJulie Andrews: It was a huge break. I didn’t truly recognize how big it was. I was more terrified at leaving my family. I had an awful separation anxiety about leaving home, because I always was leaving home and rushing back — if I could — weekends. And they were offering me a two-year contract at an incredibly small salary. There were a great many other English performers going as well, because other than one or two Americans it was an English company. All the company should have had English accents, and so it was necessary that they be English.\n\nHow old were you?\n\nJulie Andrews: I was 18. I was 19 the day after we opened on Broadway. And, it’s the first time I had ever really been away from my family for that potential length of time, and suddenly I got so panicked about it, and I called my dad, my real dad. And, I said, “Oh god, daddy, they’re asking me to go for two years. What should I do? I don’t think I can be away from the family for that long.” And he said, “Well chick, it could run two weeks or two months. It might not be two years, and it would open up your head to such an extent, I think you should do it.” I asked him later in life whether that was a hard thing to do and he said it was one of the hardest things, to say, “Go,” to just throw me into the bigger pond, so to speak, and hope that I would swim. And of course, because dad said it, oh, he said a wonderful thing. When I said, “But how will I know what to do?” he said, “Your own good brain will tell you what to do when the time comes,” which was hugely flattering and kind of implied that he thought I could cope. So, I took my courage in both hands and said, “I would like to accept this contract but I will not go for longer than one year.” And lo and behold, Messrs, Feuer and Martin said, “Fine.” And, I was the only one of the company that had a one-year contract, so off I went to Broadway for a year of incredible learning and education.\n\nDoing The Boy Friend on Broadway led to other things of course. Is that what really made your name here in the U.S. too?\n\nJulie Andrews: My life has been so fortunate. I have had most extraordinary good fortune in my life. I sort of put it into three categories, the three major stepping stones. One being that opening night when I was 12, when it started my career. The second being going to Broadway. And the third going to Hollywood. Each one of those happened under the most extraordinary circumstances.\n\nWhat happened with The Boy Friend was that because I said I would only do it for one year, just before I was going to leave to go back to my family in England — and The Boy Friend was a huge success, and it did sort of begin to help my career tremendously, I mean I think people on Broadway certainly began to know my name a little bit — but I got a call about two weeks before I was due to leave. And, it was a man who said, “I’m the manager of two writers called Lerner and Loewe, who are doing a new musical of Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, and could you just answer me one question? How much longer are you in The Boy Friend?” And I said, “Oh, I’m going home in two weeks.” And, he said, “Oh my! I was convinced, as was everybody else, that you had a two-year contract and I said to the guys, ‘Well, let me make a phone call. It’ll only cost a dime.’ ” And because I only signed for one year, I was able to audition for My Fair Lady, and by the most extraordinary good fortune I was able to do My Fair Lady, and that’s really when I think my life just took off in all directions.\n\nEliza in My Fair Lady is an extraordinarily demanding role. It’s hard to find an actress that can look the part and sing, and act the whole transformation she goes through.\n\nJulie Andrews: And also that can sustain the yelling and screaming and the Cockney accent, and the rage that comes in the first two or three songs, and then pure, pure singing in things like “I Could Have Danced All Night.” Plus the big dramatic role, too, as you say.\n\nIt’s a great role.\n\nJulie Andrews: It is probably one of the best roles for a lady in musical theater. That and perhaps Gypsy. There’s a few others. Sweeney Todd is pretty heavy, I would imagine, for all the principals.\n\nBut Eliza evolves so dramatically.\n\nJulie Andrews: It’s the best Cinderella story really, yes.\n\nWhat was it like to do that role eight times a week for two years. What a discipline!\n\nJulie Andrews: It was a discipline. And when I finished it was like, “Well now, what to do with my life? I have no life.” Because it is in a way like becoming a nun or just disappearing into this long tunnel. Wednesdays always seemed very black to me. Black Wednesday was the day that you had two shows and got up feeling awful on Thursday and had to pull yourself up only to be slammed back into the Saturday matinee again, because they were exhausting. It is one of the hardest roles, My Fair Lady. I don’t think I know any of the Eliza Doolittles that truly survived vocally or physically. It took its toll on all of them.\n\nYou got married after doing My Fair Lady in London. How did you meet your first husband?\n\nJulie Andrews: I met my first husband, Tony Walton, long before I became anybody. I had just made that first debut at 12 years old, and he was 13 at the time, and he came to see me in one of those English pantomimes at Christmas. It was the first pantomime I ever did, and I played the egg in Humpty Dumpty, and he was sitting there in the front row. And lo and behold, got on the train going home and got off at the same station and said, “You’re from Walton? I’m from Walton.” And Tony Walton, which is his name, is not linked with the town but it just happened to be similar. And, he said, “Where do you live?” And I thought, “Oh, I will be very clever.” And I said, “Oh, the other side of the bridge.” So he then went and looked up all the Andrews that lived the other side of the bridge in this area and, lo and behold, about two days later there was a knock on my door and he arrived with his brothers and we became firm friends, and eventually Tony and I married. We have a beautiful daughter by that marriage called Emma.\n\nToday you’re married to Blake Edwards. How did the two of you meet?\n\nJulie Andrews: I met Blake in 1967. We both laugh at this. I passed his car and he passed mine on the middle island of Sunset Boulevard on Roxbury Drive. I thought, “That’s a very interesting looking gentleman,” and I presumed he must have thought the same about me in terms of being an interesting looking lady. And lo and behold, a couple of days later it happened again and again. And finally, we were waiting for the traffic to clear on either side of this intersection and he rolled down his window, and I cannot remember which one of us said it but it was sort of, “Are you going to where I just came from?” And we both realized that, being on Roxbury Drive, we had probably both been to see, or were going to see, an analyst. And one of us nodded. I don’t know which one asked the question. And not too long after, I received a phone call asking if he could talk to me about a film, which was a film that we both did together called Darling Lili. It was a huge flop and it was great fun to make, and shortly after Darling Lili we were married.\n\nWe’re very interested in how people recover from career setbacks and failures like the one you mentioned. You must have been very well grounded, because there were a couple of failed movies in this period, but you kept going.\n\nJulie Andrews: I think it’s that early training, if anything, in vaudeville for me that gave me any kind of gumption. Touring endlessly around England, doing the second show on a Saturday night in places like Glasgow or Newcastle or Liverpool or Swansea or Cardiff, that’s pretty dicey. I was very, very young. There were days when they would have to turn all the house lights on in the theater because people were hurling beer bottles and things like that. And, there was this determination to get through. My mum was terrific. She would say, “Don’t you dare complain. Don’t you dare say you can’t sing in cigarette smoke,” because in those days you could see it spiraling down the great arcs on to the spotlights on to the stage. Nothing but cigarette smoke in those days. And she would say, “Don’t you dare get a swollen head,” accompanied by great love sometimes. But, all the good stuff that one needs, “Get up and do it. What are you complaining about? You’re so much luckier than most other people,” just absolutely true.\n\nSo you never lost hope when some of those movies didn’t do so well?\n\nJulie Andrews: You never set out to make a bad movie. You always hope that you’re making a good one. We’re sad about them, inasmuch as they damage the career. In those days it was important, but not as important as it is today, to keep making success after success after success. It’s terrifying today. You can maybe have one so-so movie but you’ve got to come back with another that’s huge, if possible, and that must be very, very difficult for young talent.\n\nYou and Blake Edwards, enjoyed a great success with Victor Victoria in the 1980s.\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes, particularly in all the great cities. Particularly in Chicago and New York, L.A., San Francisco, all the really sophisticated cities. I’m not sure if it was in the middle west. It’s theme was provocative, but actually the underpinning of the theme was about love and being happy with who you are. I had a wonderful time making the film. It was Blake, my lovely Blake, at the peak of his creative talent, and I knew I was in the safest hands possible.\n\nActually it’s a little daunting to be married to your director because quite often he’ll assume that I know what he wants when I’m simply begging for some small morsel that will get me through. But he’d say, “Oh, that’s fine. Just keep doing it.” But we could talk about it, and we did when we needed to, but actually we’d mostly not talk about it when we went home. We had too many kids. We pooled all our children. He had two. I had my lovely Emma and we subsequently adopted two.\n\nAt this point you’ve stopped singing because of a surgery that went awry and it’s a loss to all of us. Is there any chance of your singing again in the future?\n\nJulie Andrews: I remain optimistic but not tremendously so. If I am able to sing again it will be through some miracle operation. There’s a lot of work being done to help singers regain their voices, but in my case I actually lost vocal tissue so it’s very hard for my chords to rub together and I need to replace that tissue. I do have some notes in my voice.\n\nI certainly won’t be able to sing the way I used to, but probably at this vast age that I have now arrived at I couldn’t sing those songs anyway. And, that amazing thing of finding new directions at this time in my life when I never expected to, it was a setback. It was devastating. I miss the music unbelievably, but here am I with a publishing imprint, doing lectures, doing a lot of movies that don’t require singing, still working as hard as ever. In fact, I think I may be even more at work than I used to be, and I simply love it. I couldn’t be happier.\n\nYou directed a new production of The Boy Friend recently.\n\nJulie Andrews: I directed my Emma, Tony’s and my daughter, with her husband and her partner, Sybil Burton, Sybil Burton Christopher, in a wonderful little not-for-profit theater in Long Island, and it’s a great theater and I directed there for them and had a ball. And, of course, it was The Boy Friend in which I had begun on Broadway and felt I might be able to contribute something to it and was stunned at the talent that I found and how easy and lovely it felt and Tony Walton did the sets and costumes for it. I was in Emma’s theater and when I said to Emma, “Emma, if I fail for the family, for you, what if it’s not a success? What if it…” She said, “Mom, what better place to try than our theater? You’re in the safest possible hands and we’ll surround you with people who know what they’re doing so that you just do what you do best.” And all of a sudden it turned out to be this wonderful success.\n\nWould you do it again?\n\nJulie Andrews: Oh, as they say, “In a New York minute!” Yes.\n\nSo one door closes, another door opens.\n\nJulie Andrews: Exactly. To be really slightly corny about it, as Maria von Trapp says, “When God closes a door, somewhere he opens a window.” And this window has just been busted wide open and I’m so busy.\n\nYou’ve spoken several times today about the importance of family, staying close.\n\nJulie Andrews: Yes. I think family matters to me enormously. In fact, family is the first priority. If my family is good, I can do anything. If they’re not, I’m a basket case. There’s a lot of guilt associated with going out and doing a concert or speeches or whatever. In a way I’m kind of glad, now that I’m turning to the writing of children’s books because it allows me to stay home. I know all the family has grown up and they’re all functioning in their own way and in their lives. There are grandchildren now, and I still have Blake to go home to and he has been very patient with me.\n\nIt’s an enduring marriage by Hollywood standards.\n\nJulie Andrews: It’s 35 years this year and that is enduring, yes.\n\nOne last question we like to ask of our honorees. What is your conception of the American Dream? Does it mean something to you personally?\n\nJulie Andrews: It is America that gave me so much in my life. It wasn’t until I came to America that my life just exploded in so many ways. So for me, I think in a way, though I’m English, I’ve been living the American Dream and I’m eternally grateful to Americans for allowing me to do what I love doing the most. And, I feel an enormous responsibility to bridge the gap between England and America, and be a sort of very quiet ambassador for my country to try to sort of do a “hands across the water” thing where they understand England and English people understand Americans. I adore America.\n\nYour performance as the Queen in the Princess Diaries has brought you a whole new audience, a whole new generation.\n\nJulie Andrews: I know. It’s phenomenal. There’s a whole new generation out there that says, “Do you remember Mary Poppins?” “Yeah.” “The Sound of Music?” “Yeah.” “Princess Diaries?” “Oh, cool!” And I just love it.\n\nIt’s been wonderful.\n\nJulie Andrews: I thought that might be a good ending."
