Julie Andrews was nominated for “My Fair Lady” instead “Mary Poppins”\n\nb. Julie Andrews is still nominated for “Mary Poppins”\n\nHaving these two huge films in the same year (Box office and critically wise) would make Andrews unbeatable, ending in one of the most locked Oscar wins.\n\nKeep in mind Andrews won “Mary Poppins” in part per narrative and goodwill. Think about Sandra Bullock winning in 2009, or Julia Roberts in 2000. Adding the competition was so unorthodox and “weak” per Oscar bait (Bancroft and Loren won recently -Also Loren’s film is in Italian), Stanley’s film is anti-Oscar and Reynolds was overshadowed for Andrews narrative. Also, early 1960s Academy was more conservative and those film subjects were so outlandish -Child kidnapping, abortion, daddy issues).\n\nI definitely think she would’ve won if she got to reprise the role of Eliza on film. I also wonder if Mary Poppins would’ve come out that year if she got to be in My Fair Lady. When Walt Disney came to her with the role, she had just recently discovered she was pregnant, and when she told him, he responded saying they’d wait for her. Disney clearly knew she how perfect he’d be for the part, so I could imagine he might’ve been willing to wait for her to finish My Fair Lady.\n\nAnd even if he didn’t, and another actress played Mary Poppins, she still would’ve likely won. After all, there’s no way who ever would’ve played it could’ve done better than Andrews.\n\nThinking about this whole situation, I honestly feel pretty bad for Audrey Hepburn. I find it extremely hard to believe that her snub wasn’t due to her infamous dubbing. Sure, she didn’t do her singing, but her acting in the film is still terrific, holding her own against Rex Harrison.\n\nJoined:\n\nJan 1st, 1970\n\nTopics:\n\nPosts:\n\nThis post was found to be inappropriate by the moderators and has been removed.\n\nJoined:\n\nJan 1st, 1970\n\nTopics:\n\nPosts:\n\nThis post was found to be inappropriate by the moderators and has been removed.\n\nHepburn should have been nominated- honestly it’s time to bring back musical dubbing.La La Land had terrible singing(and terrible music too) and Les Miserables also had issues in the singing department. I would not mind doing the dubbing one bit especially because type casting prevents me from playing certain roles.\n\nI remember when I first got on to watching/reading stuff about the Oscars on the internet and someone said that Julie Andrews’s win for Mary Poppins was one of the worst ever.I mean really? Sure it wasn’t that deserving or Oscar worthy but to trash it like that? I mean do you have any child left in you? And her win was obviously because Jack Warner screwed her in the casting department for My Fair Lady.\n\nI think Julie would’ve have indeed won, but also I think her filming My Fair Lady would make Disney release Mary Poppins on another year since he was fixated on her for the role, and give her another nomination and likely another oscar.\n\nAlso Hepburn’s snub was indeed because of the dubbing, voters probably thought she did half a performance, and also people were angry Julie didn’t get the part so much of the snub came as a favour to Julie, and all those factors propelled her to win, which Julie knows and is the reason she didn’t have her Oscar on full display.\n\nJulie Andrews got a much deserved Oscar for her iconic portrayal in ”Mary Poppins” – no other performance that year can be compared to Julie’s winning triple threat. I love Audrey Hepburn, but she was wrong, wrong, wrong for the Eliza part. To begin with whe was much older – 36 – while Andrews was twenty something – perfect for Eliza. And while Audrey looked great as a lady, she was totally lost as the guttersnipe in the first half of My Fair Lady – a caricature, sometimes. Alas, she was not a soprano. Julie also should have won the Oscar for The Sound of Music. Another back to back hit/nomination. The fact that she was back to the Oscars in 2015 being honored by Lady Gaga was not only a tribute, but also an apology to Andrews for having been robbed of an Oscar for another truly iconic performance.\n\nHepburn should have won for her un-nominated performance.\n\nJulie might’ve won back to back.\n\nNot really sure how one justifies Andrews’ win here for a bad movie when Loren is right there, but whatever. Christie’s win the next year is also unshakable; Darling should have taken Best Picture, too.\n\nAndrews should have her win for Victor/Victoria, but everybody feels the need to fall all over themselves praising Streep that year so I’m sure this will be another unpopular opinion from FairWeatherAffair lol.\n\nHas anyone seen The Pumpkin Eater? Anne Bancroft was utterly SPECTACULAR. Julie herself said she thought Anne was going to win. Anne was clearly the second here.\n\nHas anyone seen The Pumpkin Eater?

Just the most bizarre casting.\n\nHere for the comedies\n\nNot now\n\nViewing 15 posts - 1 through 15 (of 15 total)\n\nYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.\n\nSimilar Topics"
