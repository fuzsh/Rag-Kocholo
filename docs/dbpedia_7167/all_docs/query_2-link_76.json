        "text": "Dame Julie Elizabeth Andrews, DBE, (born Julia Elizabeth Wells; 1 October 1935) is an English film and stage actress, singer, and author. She rose to prominence starring in musicals such as My Fair Lady and Camelot, both of which earned her Tony Award nominations. In 1957, she appeared on television in the title role of the musical Cinderella, which was seen by over 100 million viewers. She made her feature film debut in Mary Poppins (1964), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She received her second Academy Award nomination for The Sound of Music (1965), and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical. In addition to an Academy Award, she has won a BAFTA, five Golden Globes, three Grammys, two Emmys, the Disney Legend honor and the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nLife is Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius.\n\nStar weekly (29 April 1965)\n\nSuccess is terrifying. Like happiness, it is often appreciated in retrospect. It's only later that you place it in perspective. Years from now, I'll look back and say, \"God, wasn't it wonderful?\"\n\nThis Week (18 September 1966)\n\nHopefully, I brought people a certain joy. That will be a wonderful legacy.\n\nThis Week (18 September 1966)\n\nCan I give them what they think they're going to get from me? That's always the big question.\n\nScreen Stories (November 1970)\n\n'I saw The Sound of Music again recently, and I loved it. Probably it's a more valuable film now than when it first came out, because some of the things it stood for have already disappeared. There's a kind of naive loveliness about it, and love goes by so fast … love and music and happiness and family, that's what it's all about. I believe in these things. It would be awful not to, wouldn't it?\n\nPhotoplay (September 1973)\n\nI'm more contented and at peace with myself now than I was as a box-office queen. I'm less uptight. I've even reached a stage where it doesn't shatter me if somebody prints something bad about me.\n\nSaturday Evening Post (February 1980)\n\nI certainly wouldn't compare the rewards of watching one's children grow and mature with that of money piling up at the box office. Both are pleasant, but to varying degrees. As the old saying goes, you can't take an audience home with you. You can't depend on the loyalty of fans, who, after all is said and done, are just faceless people one seldom sees. And few stars have their fans forever. But a child is forever. That bond and relationship is timeless and doesn't depend on your looks, age or popularity at the moment.\n\nSaturday Evening Post (February 1980)\n\nDoes Mary Poppins have an orgasm? Does she go to the bathroom? I assure you, she does.\n\nThe New York Times (14 March 1982)\n\nI think of part of myself as a very passionate person, but I don't think that comes across. I don't know where it comes from, that reserve or veneer of British niceness. But it doesn't bother me if other people don't spot the passion. I know it's there... As long as Blake knows.\n\nThe New York Times (14 March 1982)\n\nAs you become older, you become less judgmental and take offense less. But marriage is hard work; the illusion that you get married and live happily ever after is absolute rubbish.\n\nThe New York Times (14 March 1982)\n\nMy first profession was singing, and I'm always guilty that I don't practice enough... I love to exercise, to write, to be Mrs. Edwards, to be with my kids, and there's just not enough time in the day to do all the things I want to do. I just do what seems to have to be done, but I'm never as ready as I think I should be. I try to deal with priorities, but it tears me apart. Unfortunately something always has to go by the wayside. Ultimately, I guess, it all balances out.\n\nThe New York Times (14 March 1982)\n\nEvery time I do anything, I have to ask myself: Is it a good role, and is it right to do it? There may be sex or nudity or violence in the script, and then you have to say: Is it gratuitous just out to shock people? Or is it there because it has to be? If role demands it, and it isn't gratuitous, I'll do it. It's my job, after all. I'm an actress. I know what I'm capable of — it's other people who have a problem with my image, not me. I hope I can do all sorts of things, not just one type who's all sweetness and light. Unfortunately, people forget it's a role and confuse it with you.\n\nNews of the World (June 1986)\n\nI've learned things about myself through singing. I used to have a certain dislike of the audience, not as individual people, but as a giant body who was judging me. Of course, it wasn't really them judging me. It was me judging me. Once I got past that fear, it freed me up, not just when I was performing but in other parts of my life.\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel {February 2000)\n\nI've never minded being disciplined. I'd always rather have a quiet evening in than go to a wild party. Discipline for me has always been the foundation which leaves me free to fly.\n\nWoman & Home (July 2000)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nJulie Andrews at IMDb\n\nJulie Andrews: Prim and Proper\n\nDiscography at SonyBMG Masterworks\n\nThe American Musical, Stars Over Broadway - Julie Andrews (PBS)"
