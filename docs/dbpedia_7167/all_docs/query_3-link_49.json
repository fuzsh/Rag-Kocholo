Have an account? .\n\nSome actors have won Academy Awards for their first acting role in a feature film.\n\nAt just 11 years old, Anna Paquin won an Oscar in 1994 for her first movie, \"The Piano.\"\n\nLupita Nyong'o secured her Oscar-winning role before she'd even graduated from drama school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarold Russell became the first and only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role — his first — in 1947.\n\nRussell was an American Army veteran who served in World War II and lost both of his hands during conflict. After he was discharged, Russell starred in 1946's \"The Best Years of Our Lives,\" for which he won the Academy Award for best supporting actor and an honorary Oscar for being an inspiration to veterans returning home from war.\n\nHe is the first and only actor to win two Oscars for the same role and was also reportedly the first Oscar recipient to sell their award. According to The New York Times, Russell sold his award for $60,500 in 1992 in order to pay for a cataract operation for his second wife, Betty Marshalsea.\n\n\"I love the Oscar but I love my wife more,\" he told The New York Times. \"Although I've had the Oscar longer.\"\n\nHarold Russell died on January 29, 2002.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShirley Booth won the award for best actress at the 1952 Oscars. After an acclaimed career on the stage, it was her first-ever film role.\n\nBefore winning an Oscar for her role in the 1952 film \"Come Back, Little Sheba,\" Booth already had two Tony awards under her belt, including one for playing the same role in the stage version of \"Come Back, Little Sheba.\"\n\nShe was the first actress ever to win both a Tony and an Oscar for the same role. Booth died on October 16, 1992.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulie Andrews' role in her first film, \"Mary Poppins,\" earned her an Oscar in 1965.\n\nAndrews began her career on the stage, but crossed over to the big screen in 1964 after starring as the titular character in \"Mary Poppins.\" Andrews brought the magical nanny to life with her singing ability and acting talents.\n\nThe following year, she earned the best actress award at the Oscars.\n\n\"I know you Americans are famous for your hospitality, but this is really ridiculous,\" she joked in her acceptance speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1969, Barbra Streisand won the best actress Oscar for her breakout role in \"Funny Girl.\"\n\nBy 1969, Streisand was already an accomplished stage performer, having earned two Tony nominations. In fact, she'd already brought her famous \"Funny Girl\" character, Fanny Price, to life on the stage. She then broke into Hollywood by playing the same role on the big screen in the movie adaptation of the musical.\n\nIn a historic year, Streisand tied for best actress with Katharine Hepburn at the Academy Awards. During her acceptance speech, she famously looked at her Oscar and said, \"Hello, gorgeous,\" a reference to a scene in \"Funny Girl.\"\n\n\"It was lovely to receive an Academy Award, I must say,\" Streisand told Variety in 2018, reminiscing about her first win.\n\nIn 1977, she won her second, for best original song for \"Evergreen\" in her adaptation of \"A Star is Born.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1974, 10-year-old Tatum O'Neal won the best supporting actress Oscar for her performance in \"Paper Moon.\"\n\nO'Neal had no acting experience when she was cast opposite her father, Ryan O'Neal, in \"Paper Moon,\" which was a huge hit. While she was nominated for an Oscar, her father wasn't, which she claims sparked resentment. She is still the youngest Academy Award winner in a competitive category.\n\nWhen asked in a 2020 CBS Sunday Morning interview if she hoped to win another Oscar, O'Neal responded, \"No. Because that's not why I'm in it. Would I like that? I guess. For me, the biggest achievement would be that I did the best audition that I could do, that I got the role that I really wanted, and that I'm self-supporting through my own contributions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimothy Hutton scored an Oscar in 1981 for his debut role in \"Ordinary People.\"\n\nHutton jumped into the spotlight in 1980 when he starred in \"Ordinary People.\" He played Conrad, a teenager who returns home from a psychiatric facility in an attempt to reconnect with his distant mother and cold father.\n\nWhen accepting his Academy Award the following year for best supporting actor, Hutton thanked his own father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1985, Haing S. Ngor won the best supporting actor award for his debut role in \"The Killing Fields.\"\n\nAfter switching from gynecology to acting, Ngor was cast as Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist, in 1984's \"The Killing Fields.\" The performance earned him an Oscar, making him the first Asian person to win best supporting actor. Ke Huy Quan became the second Asian actor to win the award for his supporting role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" at this year's ceremony.\n\nWhile his performance was highly praised by critics, Ngor didn't appear in any other Oscar-worthy films. His career was tragically cut short when he was shot dead by gang members in Los Angeles in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarlee Matlin starred in her first movie in 1986, \"Children of a Lesser God,\" and took home an Oscar.\n\nAfter losing her hearing at 18 months old, Matlin acted on stage for most of her childhood. In 1986, however, she starred in her first film, \"Children of a Lesser God.\" She played a deaf woman who works at a school for the deaf and falls in love with a man — played by William Hurt — who struggles to understand her.\n\nShe became the first and only deaf actress to win an Oscar when she won the best actress award in 1987. (In 2022, Troy Katsur became the first deaf man to receive an Oscar, winning the best supporting actor award for \"CODA.\") At 21, Matlin was also the youngest woman to earn an Oscar in the best actress category.\n\n\"Looking back now, thinking about that moment in the lights, with my heart pounding, Oscar in my hand, all I can say is I am grateful and humbled — still to this day,\" Matlin wrote in EW in 2012. \"Next to marrying my husband and the birth of my children, it is one of the best days ever. Twenty-five years later, it still feels just like yesterday.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt just 11 years old, Anna Paquin won an Oscar in 1994 for her first movie, \"The Piano.\"\n\nIn 1993, Paquin took on her first-ever acting role in \"The Piano,\" playing Flora, a young girl who acts as an interpreter for her mute mother when they are shipped to New Zealand in the mid-19th century.\n\nAt 11 years old, Paquin nervously accepted her award for best supporting actress on the Oscars stage by just staring into the camera and laughing before thanking a few people. She became the second-youngest winner in the category — only Tatum O'Neal was younger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her first movie, Jennifer Hudson stole the show. She won an Oscar for her role in 2006's \"Dreamgirls.\"\n\nHot off the success of her short-lived \"American Idol\" run, Hudson took on her first acting gig opposite Beyoncé in \"Dreamgirls.\" Hudson played Effie White, the lead singer in the 1960s girl group who keeps getting pushed aside.\n\nHudson's singing voice and acting chops earned her the best supporting actress award in 2007. In her acceptance speech, Hudson thanked Jennifer Holliday, who originated the role on Broadway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLupita Nyong'o won an Oscar for her debut role in \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nLupita Nyong'o grew up in Kenya and then studied at the Yale School of Drama, but she landed her first major film role — which would lead to an Oscar — before she'd even graduated. In 2013's \"12 Years a Slave,\" she played Patsey, an enslaved person on a Louisiana cotton plantation.\n\nThe following year, she won the best supporting actress Oscar and thanked the spirit of Patsey for guiding her through the filming process.\n\n\"When I look down at this golden statue, may it remind me and every little child that no matter where you are from, your dreams are valid,\" she said in her acceptance speech.\n\nRead next\n\nOscars Entertainment Movies\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
