        "text": "The first graphic novel ever published by Ice Cube Press of North Liberty struck home with me. Literally. My Northwest Iowa former home.\n\nAccomplished Cedar Falls artist Gary Kelley has expertly crafted through his words and drawings a vivid, historic retelling of the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857 under the title “Moon of the Snow Blind.”\n\nThe dark horror of this Iowa tragedy unfolds over 184 pages laced with some 275 dramatic panels in the comic book style we Baby Boomers once loved. You follow Inkpaduta’s vengeful rampage through a string of primitive lakeside log cabin homes, where his Dakota Sioux band left a trail of 35 dead pioneers.\n\nThe tale held a terrible fascination for us impressionable young boys who grew up near the Iowa Great Lakes, now the state’s premier vacation spot.\n\nMore: From 'truck stop kid' to major UI donor, how World's Largest Truck Stop success has helped Iowa grad give back\n\nWe often visited the Gardner cabin and monument just a stone’s throw from the Arnold’s Park roller coaster on the shores of West Okoboji. The one-room structure marks the spot where young Abbie Gardner was abducted after witnessing the horrific murder of her family.\n\nWe boys would run our hands over the thick tree trunks at this site in a morbid, fruitless search for traces of settler blood — as if those stains might have survived more than a century, or as if these were even the same trees.\n\nNow, in the midst of a surge in graphic novel popularity, Kelley revives the tale after six years of research and artistic labor. He said he was driven not only by respect for the pioneers, but a desire to make sure the Native side gets its due as well.\n\n“It was very important,” the author/artist told me, “for me to follow this idea that there are two sides to every story. And it’s a dark story from both sides.”\n\nKelley’s account begins with the ongoing white settler encroachment of Native lands, mistreatment, broken government treaties and much worse. Inkpaduta’s half-brother’s entire family was murdered by a horse trader who was not held accountable in court. His Wahpekute band of Dakota Sioux was later disarmed and forced from their village with little means to hunt for food. Desperate, starving and resentful, they traveled to the Gardner cabin at Okoboji, where the rampage began.\n\nPrepare for panels that depict a severed Native head on a pole, the smallpox-scarred face of Inkpaduta and the horror of Abbie Gardner huddled in the cabin with small children about to be ripped from her grasp.\n\nThis is Kelley’s first graphic novel of his 50-year career. The Cedar Falls artist is a Northern Iowa graduate and member of the New York Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame, his works having appeared in such publications as Time, Rolling Stone, The Atlantic and Playboy.\n\n“For me, this was really a dark, interesting way to tell the story,” he said. “I want people to be addicted to the composition of every panel.”\n\nHow did he approach this huge artistic undertaking, not to mention the additional challenges of writing the copy and organizing the story flow?\n\n“I really didn’t have much of an outline,” he said. “I would do some research on a particular chapter, then start drawing and see where it led. Sometimes the picture created the dialogue.”\n\nHis research took him to tiny Smithland, to examine the terrain where Inkpaduta spent winters setting up his nearby village. For inspiration on the graphic novel style, he developed a professional relationship with Mike Mignola, the artist who created the pop culture icon of “Hellboy.”\n\nGraphic novel art is getting its proper due these days, as illustrated by the immensely popular superhero movies and niche stores such as Geek City Games in North Liberty, which stocks an estimated 350 titles. Today, you can find graphic novels of everything from “Moby Dick” to “Slaughterhouse Five.”\n\nThis kind of popularity prompted Ice Cube Press publisher Steve Semken to include Kelley’s project as one of the half-dozen carefully selected books he publishes each year.\n\n“I’m interested in Iowa history,” said Semken, “plus I liked how the story was told and that the full side of the story was told. This guy is really talented.”\n\nKelley’s title, “Moon of the Snow Blind,” refers to the month of March in Native lore, which is when the Okoboji/Spirit Lake uprising occurred. Similar references to Native months divide the book sections.\n\nThoughtful, equal play is given to both cultures. And yet, you can’t help but conclude that the continuing mistreatment of indigenous peoples contributed to this violent uprising and the death of innocents.\n\nYou won’t get that message while skiing over West Okoboji’s crystal clear, spring-fed waters, or from the top of its rare wooden roller coaster — restored, still standing and still enjoyed.\n\nBut know that the Gardner cabin still stands as well — silent, but with a dramatic new voice from Gary Kelley.\n\nFor more information: Find the artist’s website at www.garykelleyart.com.
