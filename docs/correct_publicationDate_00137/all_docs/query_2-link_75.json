        "text": "About the Book\n\nA novel of a very different 20th Century\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nIn 1912, history was changed by the Miracle, when the old world of Europe was replaced by Darwinia, a strange land of nightmarish jungle and antediluvian monsters. To some, the Miracle was an act of divine retribution; to others, it is an opportunity to carve out a new empire.\n\nLeaving an America now ruled by religious fundamentalists, young Guilford Law travels to Darwinia on a mission of discovery that will take him further than he can possibly imagine...to a shattering revelation about mankind's destiny in the universe. Robert Charles Wilson has crafted a brilliant science fiction novel--a view of an utterly different 20th century. Darwinia is a 1999 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"In the best tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells...A page-turner.\" --Toronto Globe and Mail on Darwinia\n\n\"Rich, lucid, and literate...Comparable to Philip D. Dick or A. E. Van Vogt. Remarkable indeed.\" --Publishers Weekly (starred review) on Darwinia \"Robert Charles Wilson is a hell of a storyteller.\" --Stephen King, Entertainment Weekly, on Spin\n\nAbout the Author"
