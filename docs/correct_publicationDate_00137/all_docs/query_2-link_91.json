It was mid January 2008 by then. I slept for most of the seven hour journey, arriving in the Portuguese capital an hour after dawn. I was back on British Mean Time. I took a taxi to the Oasis Backpackers, unsure of its destination. Once at the hostel, I crashed for a while, it being early and no staff or bed available.

I wanted to visit Portugal and also enter into Morocco, just across the Strait of Gibraltar. I returned to Seville, because I liked the city’s medieval atmosphere and I wanted to see friends I had made previously. Marco, the crazy Mexican I had shared a dorm with in late December, met me at the airport and we got the bus back into the city.\n\nRead more →\n\nBlog post / Walking in the woods!\n\nCanada\n\nCanada is a land of magnificent beauty and wonder.

I met up with friends from Cuba in Madrid, where it was cold and rained most of the time, typical weather I’m informed for Madrid in December. I did the usual tourist things, walked the streets, visited the many squares, strolled passed the palace walls and went for a paddle in the lake in the large attractive park.\n\nRead more →\n\nBlog post / Inspirational story\n\nI was sent this story by a friend who is totally deaf and visually impaired.

He blazed through four years of psychedelia before his sudden demise in October 1970. However, in that short period he left his mark on the world as he ‘lived in the moment.’\n\nAlthough I have not set the world alight in quite the same fashion,\n\nRead more →\n\nBlog post / Iceland Part Two.\n\nIceland essay — Part 2\n\nThe only place to be is on the road.\n\nMeeting people and having fun is what we do!\n\nMy second week in Iceland was mind blowing — an experience never to be forgotten.\n\nRyan, the young but mature American I had met, and I hit the road for a drive around Iceland’s coast on a journey of inspiration and soul enlightenment.
