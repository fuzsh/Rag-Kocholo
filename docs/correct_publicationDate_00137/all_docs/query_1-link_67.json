        "text": "The Affinities\n\nAn intriguing and seriously innovative attempt to grapple with some of the issues raised by the 21st century's obsession with social media.\n\n-- Kirkus (starred review)\n\nWilson works a fascinating transformation on one of the oldest plot devices in SF: people who are widely hated for their inherent difference from the rest of humankind... Wilson's trademark well-developed characters and understated but compelling prose are very much in evidence in this quietly believable tale of the near future.\n\n-- Publishers Weekly\n\nIn this thought-provoking novel, Wilson deftly explores the drawbacks of groupthink and social networks that come to replace more inclusive, complex personal relationships. What’s chilling is how closely this futuristic plot mirrors our current reality.\n\n-- Washington Post\n\nWilson must have tapped into the Zeitgeist because whenever I shared the premise of The Affinities with others, they were instantly intrigued . . . Wilson takes readers from the mundane to a surreal future in just 300 pages . . . I was hooked from start to finish.\n\n-- Fantasy Literature\n\nRobert Charles Wilson’s latest describes a social network that has evolved into something even more invasive and threatening than Facebook and Google . . . As always, Wilson has grounded his speculations in a suspenseful story focused on real people coping with these changes. It’s a troubling vision of the future, made all the more so by the ambiguity at its heart: are the affinities a good thing? Is this progress, or regression to a more primitive state?\n\n-- Alex Good, The Toronto Star\n\nWilson has always written strongly humanistic tales of relationships with­in SF frameworks, and sometimes the SF itself is mostly a way of exploring the ways in which we cope, or fail to cope, with change. This may be Wilson’s grand theme, and it’s no less skill­fully handled here.\n\n-- Gary Wolfe, Locus\n\nThe distinguishing features of a Robert Charles Wilson novel are a deep and abiding humanism and empathy; delicate yet robust prose; and a commitment to taking core tropes of the SF field, turning them inside out, and then pursuing the implications of their new shapes . . . Wilson’s newest, The Affinities, does not depart from his usual high standards. Beyond the social media hook, there lies a family drama akin to something Karen Joy Fowler or Mary Rickert might write, as well as multiple love stories and the coming-of-age of our protagonist . . . [This is] bedrock science fiction that earns its eternal classicism by embodying human values and concerns as old as the species, no matter what futuristic trappings they wear.\n\n-- Paul Di Filippo, The Speculator\n\n​\n\nVortex\n\nThe final volume of the Spin trilogy.\n\n\"It's rare that the concluding volume of a trilogy can easily draw in newcomers unfamiliar with the back-story, but Hugo-winner Wilson does so without breaking a sweat . . . With relentless momentum Wilson's plot will propel readers along, and the subtle characterizations and sophisticated plotting elevate this to the top ranks of the genre.\" -- Publishers Weekly, starred review.\n\n\"A stunningly good work of science fiction . . . This novel, this series, reveals a thoughtful, seasoned author who went deep and came up with gold.\" -- The Globe and Mail\n\n\"Vortex is Wilson's final, bittersweet farewell to a soaring science-fiction conceit that has provided his readers with so many small, thoughtful -- and compellingly human -- pleasures.\"\n\n-- NPR Books\n\n\"Wilson’s ideas and imagery evoke a wide-eyed, childlike feeling of awe and wonder in the reader. Not to mention the fact that all the characters are very well drawn, something which far too few science fiction writers pay attention to.\" -- National Post\n\n\"Robert Charles Wilson [has] nearly perfected a narrative technique which had already defined him as one of the most distinctive voices in modern SF: juxtaposing stunning high-concept SF spectacle with intimate personal dramas and closely observed characterization . . . As a conclusion to one of the most important series in recent SF, [Vortex] does not disappoint, and attains moments of true brilliance.\"\n\n-- Locus\n\n\"A compelling read and a great series ending. SF that combines far-future sense of wonder with human interest and great characters does not come around that often, and I strongly recommend not to miss it in Vortex.\" -- Fantasy Book Critic\n\nThe Perseids and Other Stories\n\nMy first (and to date, only) short story collection. The stories are all set in Toronto -- in the words of the jacket flap, \"a haunted, numinous Toronto of past, present and future, buzzing with strangeness.\"\n\n\"Beautifully observed, skillfully worked out: stories that flow subtly, almost imperceptibly, from the prosaic to the preternatural.\"\n\n-- Kirkus (Starred Review)\n\n\"There is in these tales such an affection for the numinous, the astronomical sublime, the ineffable -- for the basic stuff of SF and fantasy -- that they are . . . well-nigh irresistable. Wilson sets out to remind us, and possibly himself, of what there is to fall in love with in SF, and he succeeds.\" -- Locus\n\n\"These stories by the author of the prizewinning best-seller Darwinia (1998) are mostly urban fantasies set in Wilson's hometown, Toronto. Readers familiar with that other Canadian master of urban fantasy, Charles De Lint, will certainly find echoes of him in them, and they will enjoy a feast. \" -- Booklist"
