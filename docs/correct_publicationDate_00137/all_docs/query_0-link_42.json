My question is, are most of his books about end of the world type scenarios? Just seems to be very similar themes.\n\nJust a simple yes or no is good.. please don't spoil any other of his books' plotlines for me! I prefer to go into books knowing nothing beforehand.\n\nTry Axis the \"sequel\" to Spin and the second in the loose trilogy ending with Vortex in 2009 or 2010 since Mr. Wilson plans to expand Julian his excellent novella in a novel first. It was as good as Spin but different, no direct sequel.\n\nFrom the backlist my favorites are Blind Lake and the ss collection The Perseids.\n\nI have not enjoyed Darwinia or The Chronoliths as much - they were good, but Spin took Mr. Wilson to another level."
