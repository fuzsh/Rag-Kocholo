        "text": "Blind Your Ponies by Stanley Gordon West, Algonquin Books, 2011, 539 pages, $14.95.\n\nBecause I am known as a “book addict,” I am often asked for recommendations, but it does work the other way also. I read a significant number of books upon the recommendation of reading friends. During this past July one such instance led me to this title. At their northern Minnesota lake cabin, long time friends Dorothy and Bill were discussing the books I had brought as gifts, as well as other books I would recommend. Lying on their coffee table was a book by Stanley Gordon West. I asked about the book since I was not familiar with the author. Aghast, they both exclaimed, “You have not read Stanley Gordon West!” I replied, “Guilty as charged.” They proceeded to tell me stories about this remarkable author who lives in Minnesota but sets his novels mostly in Montana.\n\nI vowed to rectify this reading oversight ASAP; I purchased several of West’s novels and read Blind Your Ponies, his longest at 539 pages, but widely considered his most significant work. It is as marvelous as Dorothy and Bill asserted.\n\nI will sketch out the story, but I will not tell it, because I want other people like me to find the book. It is a “Rocky” type novel (against all odds), on the surface following a small town basketball team through one season. However, it is much more than a traditional losing to winning basketball story.\n\nThe setting is Willow Creek, Montana, about as small as a town can be and still have a basketball team. In fact they are so small that they cannot field a girls’ basketball team. The town is hapless, and the attitude of the townspeople toward themselves is equally hapless.\n\nThe central character in the novel is teacher Sam Pickett. “Sam never expected to settle in this dried-up shell of a town on the western edge of the world. He’s come here to hide from the violence and madness that have shattered his life.”\n\nSam has coached the basketball team for four years, and the team has lost 87 games in a row, plus six more losses in a row before Sam became coach. As the book opens the superintendent, also on the downside of his career, intends to assign another teacher the head basketball coaching position because no one should endure that many losses with no hope on the horizon. Sam declines the offer because he wants to win at least one game before retiring of his own free will. Furthermore, there may be too few players to even field a team.\n\nSam is also the high school’s only English teacher, and when the novel begins he is preparing to teach Don Quixote to seniors. Throughout the book Stanley Gordon West cleverly integrates “The Impossible Dream” in the novel to the impossible dream on the basketball court.\n\nSam Picket first has to find out if there are enough players to field a team. One member of the team has a drunken jackass father who derides losing, the coach, the players and really all team sports. Another talented player has decided to transfer schools after the first semester, and that obviously won’t work in a team sport. A little freshman with little academic talent and no self esteem has be begged too come out. Most of all Sam has to convince a 6’ 10” Norwegian foreign exchange student to play a game he knows nothing about.\n\nWhen the season commences, there are seven total players. Injuries and foul outs often take the team below five eligible players. The tall kid who knows nothing about basketball proves it on the floor. Their early schedule is easy, but they lose all of these games. Then, slowly, something happens. Members of the community show up for practices so they can have a scrimmage, along with parents, grandmothers, and other teachers. Diana, one of the teacher volunteers, becomes assistant coach. She has a background of misery and broken dreams like Sam, and they become attracted to more than basketball. Sam drives the bus to and from games. At the start of the season the team does not even have the same uniforms.\n\nThis book should be read by all students who doubt their abilities or the importance of teamwork. It should be read by coaches of any activity who question the worth of an extracurricular activity if it lo ses. It should be read by parents who sometimes fail to understand the difference between presence and support--or worse yet just pure negativism. It should be read for a fine love story subplot. It should be read by people who need assurance that impossible dreams can come true.\n\nI was most amazed that the author could carry the novel through a full basketball season, about 25 games, while not burying the reader in endless play by play. Only about 50 of the 500 plus pages are devoted to the drama of the games. The book is about the players, coaches, moms and dads, grandparents, and friends who need hope and find it.\n\nThe unusual title of the book comes from an Indian legend and fits the novel perfectly\n\nBlind Your Ponies was a novel that I was sad to see end. Stanley Gordon West is not a perfect writer, but he loves his story so much that you will love it too.\n\nThat’s it for this month’s Book Look. On the first Saturday in October we’ll examine Hampton Sides’ current non-fiction sensation: In the Kingdom of Ice.\n\nDonus Roberts is a former teacher, current advisor to the ABC Book Club, an avid reader/collector of books, and he invites reader feedback at ddrbooks@wat.midco.net."
