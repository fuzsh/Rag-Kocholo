In 2015, it was announced by Syfy that it is going to develop a 6-hour miniseries based on this book. The story opens by introducing Tyler Dupre as a 12-year-old boy. He lives with his mother in a guest house located on a millionaire’s property. The millionaire named E.D. Lawton has an alcoholic wife named Carol, a 13-year-old son named Jason, and a daughter named Diane. Tyler forms a friendship with Jason. He is an intelligent student and is being trained to take over his family business. Tyler is also friends with Jason’s twin sister Diane and also loves her secretly. One night, when the three kids are stargazing, they witness that all the stars have simultaneously disappeared. The telecommunication also suffers due to the falling out of the satellites from their orbit. An opaque membrane called the spin membrane is placed around the Earth in such a way that it slows down the time. Now, every year inside the membrane is equal to 100 million years outside of it.\n\nSpacecrafts can easily fly through the membrane, however, it prevents the harmful stellar radiation from reaching the Earth. A simulation of the sun fitted inside the membrane allows for the life cycle to function normally. However, all life forms on Earth face the danger of extinction in several decades because of the expansion of the sun at a larger scale. Jason shows the obsession of learning about the spin membrane so that he can deactivate it. He becomes a part of Perihelion, a firm that acts as the government and tries to deal with the membrane. Diane joins a Christian movement and marries Simon. Tyler becomes a doctor and gets hired by Jason as his staff physician. As the story progresses further, Tyler, Diane, and Jason work to get rid of the membrane and help normalcy prevail on Earth. While doing so, they get access to Martian technology, which is why the US government tries to arrest them and take possession of the advanced form of technology.\n\nThe second installment of this series is called ‘Axis’. It was published in 2007 by Tor Book. This novel set on a new planet that was introduced at the end of the previous book. This new world was engineered by the Hypotheticals for supporting human life. It is linked to the Earth by means of the Arch that spreads across the Indian Ocean. Humans begin to colonize the new world and started exploiting the abundant resources fiercely. They mainly exploit the large reserves of oil found in the desert region of a continent named Equatoria. Lise Adams is introduced as a young woman, who attempts to unravel the mystery behind the disappearance of her father ten years ago. Turk Findley is a drifter and former sailor.\n\nLise and Turk meet each other when the planet is seeded by the tiny machines of the Hypothetical. Shortly after, the hospitable world turns alien because of the twisting of time’s nature by some unknown entities. Dr. Avram Dvali leads a group of quasi-religious entities from Earth. This group creates a child with the help of Martian technology and name it Isaac. The technology also connects Isaac to the Hypotheticals. The Genomic Security Department searches for Avram Dvali’s group or the ones who disapprove the creation of Isaac. This novel was also liked and appreciated by readers all across the world and was nominated for the 2008 John Campbell Award. The success of this book motivated author Wilson to write one more volume as a part of this series."
