        "meta_description": "Robert Charles Wilson is a master of setting a story near the super-science, but not discussing it from the perspective of the super-scientists themselves. I'm a big fan of his Blind Lake, set at a research lab, and his award-winning Spin is an absolute masterpiece. Wilson's work almost always filters scientific ideas through non-scientific narrators, which lets him gracefully avoid the problems of super-science, and also tell stories with a cosmic background but an intense personal focus. His story \"Divided by Infinity\" is another great piece of work, probably the best story ever about the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, and it's freely available from Tor.com.",
