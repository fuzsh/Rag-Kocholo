        "text": "Since the earliest days of science fiction as an established genre, writers in the field have imagined what has come to be called First Contact with a capital F and a capital C. Most of the early speculation in the so-called Golden Era of Science Fiction (the 1930s and 40s) was laughable. But in more recent times most authors have sought to ground their work in the thinking of scientists rather than fantasists. The result has been a flurry of thought-provoking books and films that raise questions about human existence as well as the prospects for encountering intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And here are ten of those books. One (Arthur C. Clarke’s Rendezvous With Rama) is a classic, but all the others have been written far more recently. They’re arranged in alphabetical order by the authors’s last names, and each is linked to my review.\n\nSemiosis (Semiosis Duology #1) by Sue Burke — Can plants think? These colonists on an alien world learn the answer the hard way.\n\nInterference (Semiosis Duology #2) by Sue Burke — Humans, intelligent plants, brilliant insects, and that’s not all!\n\n3zekiel (First Contact) by Peter Cawdron — A thoughtful treatment of First Contact in this new sci-fi novel\n\nTo Be Taught, If Fortunate by Becky Chambers — An excellent hard science fiction novella from Becky Chambers\n\nRendezvous With Rama by Arthur C. Clarke — Arthur C. Clarke’s believable First Contact novel\n\nTomorrow’s Kin (Yesterday’s Kin Trilogy #1) by Nancy Kress — Hard science fiction doesn’t get much better than this\n\nRemnant Population by Elizabeth Moon — Alien encounters of the strange kind in a captivating sci-fi novel\n\nTransmission (Invasion Chronicles #1) by Morgan Rice — A YA novel about first contact that’s . . . well, childish\n\nSaturn Run by John Sandford and Ctein — First Contact: Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind\n\nBlind Lake by Robert Charles Wilson — An award-winning sci-fi novelist writes a disappointing book\n\nFor further reading\n\nFor more good reading, check out:\n\nThe ultimate guide to the all-time best science fiction novels;\n\nGreat sci-fi novels reviewed: my top 10 (plus dozens of runners-up); and\n\nThe top 10 dystopian novels reviewed here (plus dozens of others).\n\nYou might also check out Top 10 great popular novels reviewed on this site."
