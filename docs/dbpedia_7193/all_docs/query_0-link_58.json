        "text": "The best plot twists make the viewer reconsider everything. Plot twists long predate the medium of film and have been a staple of literature for hundreds of years. However, they have become a staple of cinema. Plot twists are fixtures of the mystery, action, suspense and horror genres, but many great dramas, romances, and even comedies have plot twists. Many of the greatest directors and even actors have become synonymous with this type of twisty-turny movies.\n\nSince this is a list of the best plot twists in movies, this article comes with a big SPOILER WARNING ahead. For some viewers, even knowing a twist is coming is a spoiler, and this article is not for them. However, if you are craving a good twist film, the spoiler warnings are in bold, and the spoilers are separated for those hoping to experience the twists for themselves.\n\nTop Movies With A Plot Twist\n\nFrom anagnorisis to reverse chronology, great twist walks the line between feeling deserved and believable in the narrative while still shocking and surprising the viewer. It should be hinted at — but never too heavily so as to diminish its shock. While many plot twists don’t really make sense if you pull them apart logically, some of the best hold together well.\n\nThe films on this list are ranked by the twist instead of the quality of the overall film. However, all films on this list are good or even great films that are well worth watching, aside from their twist. Unfortunately, this excludes films like Now You See Me, Identity and Last Christmas. While they have fun twists, the films themselves don’t really hold up.\n\n30. Saltburn (2023)\n\nSaltburn is a divisive movie that some viewers will not like. However, it is a fun and bombastic film that captures the excess of the early 2000s. The film follows the mild-mannered Oliver Quick, who is invited to spend the summer at the mansion of his wealthy classmate, Felix Catton, so that Oliver doesn’t have to return to a difficult home situation.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: When Felix tries to mend Oliver’s relationship with “Oliver’s alcoholic and poor” mother, Felix finds that Oliver has been lying about his family situation and is actually from a perfectly nice upper-middle-class home. Oliver has been lying and manipulating everyone the entire time. Once his secret is discovered, he kills Felix and sets himself up to inherit the Catton family estate one day. While this twist isn’t the newest (fans of films like The Talented Mr. Rippley or Teorema will likely see it coming), it is depraved fun until the end and is best viewed as kind of “vampire film.”\n\nThe film was directed by Emerald Fennell, who delivered another great twist in her previous movie, Promising Young Woman. Saltburn’s more shocking scenes became notorious, especially amongst Gen-Z TikTok users; however, the film's real strength lies in its comedy. It is a surprisingly funny film for not really being considered a comedy. Saltburn is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\n29. Coco (2017)\n\nWhile adult audiences will probably see the twist in Coco coming, having a twist in an animated children's movie is pretty fun. While Coco wasn’t the first kids' film with a twist, it is arguably the best. The film follows a young boy, Miguel, who is trapped in the land of the dead during Dia de los Muertos and learns he must find his great-great-grandfather, Ernesto de la Cruz, and get his blessing if he hopes to return home and play music.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Miguel finds Ernesto with the help of a down-on-his-luck skeleton, Héctor. However, Ernesto isn’t actually family. Ernesto murdered Miguel’s great-great-grandfather and stole his songbook. Furthermore, Héctor is Miguel's ancestor, and Miguel must preserve his memory, or Héctor will cease to exist.\n\nCoco was the first Pixar movie to feature an all-Latino principal cast, including Anthony Gonzalez, Gael García Bernal, Benjamin Bratt and Edward James Olmos. Many of the actors also returned for the Spanish-language dub. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song. Coco is currently streaming on Disney+.\n\n28. Scream (1996)\n\nIs the plot twist what makes Scream great? Not really. Honestly, Scream is more of a great movie with a plot twist than a “great plot twist movie.” Directed by Wes Craven, Scream is both a love letter and a gentle spoof of slasher movies while being a great slasher movie. The film follows a group of teens as Ghostface, a ruthless killer in a Halloween mask, terrorizes them. In the climactic scene Sidney and her boyfriend, Billy come face to face with the killer.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Ghostface stabs Billy. However, he doesn’t die. Instead, he reveals that he and his friend, Stu, are the killer. The two then give a famous monologue (well… dialogue?) detailing their crimes because “It's all a movie. It's all one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.”\n\nThe film stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich and Drew Barrymore. It was generally well-reviewed and surprisingly financially successful upon its release, but it has only become more beloved by horror fans and has taken on a legendary status in the genre. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n27. Predestination (2014)\n\nWhile the name of this movie gives a little away, this Australian sci-fi time has one of the better approaches to time travel. Not everything in Predestination works, but it is undoubtedly unique. Written and directed by The Spierig Brothers, the film follows a recently deformed time-traveling agent in pursuit of a criminal called the “fizzle bomber” when he meets with a young man who tells him his life story.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The man is intersex and was raised as a woman until she had a baby and her uterus was removed surgically. Doctors pushed her to live as a man, and the baby was stolen. However, through time travel, not only was the man her own lover and herself, but also the baby, the agent and the bomber are all versions of the same person at different points of time. While it feels like a shocking twist, many will see it coming as it is heavily hinted at throughout the movie with dialogue and even music cues.\n\nThe film stars Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook. Predestination was based on Robert A. Heinlein’s 1959 short story —All You Zombies—. It is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n26. The Village (2004)\n\nMany people do not like The Village; however, it has become a bit of a cult classic and has been called an “underrated masterpiece.” Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, the film follows a young blind woman who lives in a 19th-century isolated Pennsylvania village. When she is sent to get medicine, she is plagued by monsters who live in the surrounding woods.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: After outsmarting a monster, she leaves the woods only to find a present-day paved road and Wildlife Reserve park rangers. The viewer finds out that the village isn’t in the 1800s at all and is a refuge for several families hoping to escape the modern violence of the real world. The monsters were costumes all along. However, the woman returns with the supplies, never seeing the contemporary world.\n\nThe Village stars Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson. The film is a truly “love it or hate it” kind of movie and divided critics. In 2004, it made both the Cahiers du cinéma annual top films list and Roger Ebert’s “Most Hated” list. It is currently available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n25. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)\n\nStrangely, mystery films are sometimes left off of “Best Twist” lists. Possibly because the genre of mystery calls for twists and usually solvable turns. However, the line between “mystery” and “thriller” is razor-thin, and many mysteries have phenomenal twists. Glass Onion is the second Benoit Blanc-led Knives Out film. It plays with the genre of mystery itself. The film follows Benoit as he is called to the billionaire Miles Bron’s island for a lavish murder mystery party. However, Benoit quickly learns everyone at the party has a reason to want Miles dead, especially his former business partner, Cassandra \"Andi\" Brand.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Around two-thirds of the way through the film, the audience finds out Andi has been dead the entire time. Her twin sister, Helen, has been pretending to be her to gather clues about who killed Andi with the help of Benoit. While Andi’s death is a twist, minutes before it is revealed, Benoit calls “Andi” by her real name, “Helen.” Most viewers won’t notice it, but it is foreshadowing about the nature of “come out of nowhere twists” and the mystery genre, because, in the end, there is no twist about who actually killed Andi; it was Miles, the person most likely to do it, which functions as a twist in its own right. As Benoit says, “It’s so dumb.”\n\nGlass Onion starred Daniel Craig, Edward Norton and Janelle Monáe and was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Academy Awards. Many wondered if the film’s Miles Bron was inspired by real-life billionaire Elon Musk. However, director Rian Johnson has refuted this. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n24. The Third Man (1949)\n\nYou will probably guess the twist from The Third Man, but that doesn’t mean this noir masterpiece isn’t well worth a watch. The film is gorgeously shot and perfectly acted. It follows Holly Martins, an American pulp writer who travels to early Cold War Vienna to see a friend of his, Harry Lime. However, when Holly goes to his house, he learns that Harry has died the day before under mysterious circumstances, prompting Holly to investigate the death.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Holly realizes that the accounts of Harry’s death don’t line up. Mainly because Harry isn’t actually dead and has been using the sewer system to traverse the locked-down city in the shadows. He faked his own death after selling faulty medicine to a children's hospital, which causes Holly to turn on his friend. Holly helps the police find Harry and ends up shooting him before the police can take him.\n\nDirected by Carol Reed, the film stars Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Orson Welles and Trevor Howard. The Third Man was nominated for three Oscars, winning Best Cinematography – Black and White. The film's score is also iconic and performed on a zither by Anton Karas. It is currently streaming on Tubi for free or Amazon Prime with subscription.\n\n23. The Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nIf, by some miracle, the twist in The Usual Suspects hasn’t been ruined for you in the last nearly 30 years, the less you know, the better. The film follows the police investigation of a massacre and a con artist who tells them about its perpetrator, a ruthless drug lord named Keyser Söze.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The cops believe they have the identity of Söze and let the con artist leave the station. However, as he exists, the Customs agent who has been interviewing him realizes that the facts don’t quite align. Moments later, a fax comes through with a photo of Söze; unfortunately, it is the same man he just had in custody.\n\nThe film was directed by Brian Singer and stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Giancarlo Esposito and Kevin Spacey. The Usual Suspects has always been divisive and not for everyone. In his review, Roger Ebert quipped, \"To the degree that I do understand, I don't care.\" While the film received mixed reviews, it won two Academy Awards and has since become a cult classic. It is streaming for free on Tubi, Pluto TV and The Roku Channel.\n\n22. Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011)\n\nWhile romcoms don’t usually feature twist endings, Crazy, Stupid, Love proves it can work in the genre. The film was directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and stars Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon. It follows a man going through a divorce, Cal, and a slick-talking lady's man, Jacob, who helps him get back into playing the field. At the same time, Jacob loses his womanizing ways as he falls for a girl.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The girl Jacob is dating turns out to be Cal’s eldest daughter. Cal disapproves of her dating a womanizer and tries to fight him, leading him to have to make even more apologies if he hopes to win his family back.\n\nBesides one slightly uncomfortable plot involving a babysitter, everything wraps up nicely, as you hope a romcom does. However, Crazy, Stupid, Love doesn’t feel too formulaic, and the twist really helps sell the otherwise routine narrative. It also features wonderful comedic performances, especially by Carrel and Gosling. It is currently available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n21. Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nMost contemporary viewers won’t even consider Citizen Kane’s ending to be a “twist ending.” It has permeated pop culture so deeply in the last 80 years that even those who haven’t seen the film probably know how it ends. However, that’s mainly because of the iconic twist. The film tells the story of the rise to power of Charles Foster Kane. On Kane’s deathbed, he calls for just one thing, “Rosebud,” leading a reporter to wonder what it means.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Kane dies, and the reporter never finds the identity of “Rosebud.” However, as the staff of Kane’s mansion sort his worldly possessions, they throw a sled on a fire. The audience sees the name of Kane’s childhood sled was named “Rosebud.”\n\nThe film was Orson Welles’ first feature film and he both directed and starred in it. While it was nominated for nine Oscars, it was controversial upon release. The plot was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who was a powerful enemy to make in the 1940s. Many theaters refused to show the film, and MGM's Louis B. Mayer even offered to pay RKO $842,000 in cash if the studio destroyed the negative and all prints of Citizen Kane. The film is a masterpiece and is also notable for its technical advances, especially the extended use of deep focus, a technique where the fore, mid and background are all in sharp focus. It is currently available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n20. Friday the 13th (1980)\n\nThe original Friday the 13th is a horror/slasher classic. The film follows a group of teenage camp counselors who hope to reopen an abandoned summer camp.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The mysterious Mrs. Voorhees is revealed to be the killer (yes, in the original Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees is not actually the killer). She is taking revenge on behalf of her son, who drowned at the camp. While a final girl, Alice, kills Mrs. Voorhees, Alice is attacked by Jason’s decomposing corpse. Police check the lake but find no boy, so Alice says, “Then he's still there.\"\n\nThe film stars Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan and Kevin Bacon. While it was an independent film with no big-name actors, its popularity led it to be released internationally and the film was a box office success. Friday the 13th helped define the slasher genre and led to 11 sequels and spin-offs (of varying quality; let’s not talk about Jason X, where he goes to space.) It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n19. Side Effects (2013)\n\nDirected by Steven Soderbergh, Side Effects is an underrated gem when it comes to movies with great plot twists. It follows a socialite, Emily, who struggles with suicidality her husband completes a prison term for insider trading. When her new psychiatrist prescribes her an experimental antidepressant, she starts sleepwalking and, in a daze, attacks her husband.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: While Emily is found not guilty due to an insanity defense, her original psychiatrist starts to question if the drug's side effects really caused the murder. He threatens Emily with electroshock treatment, and she admits that she killed her husband on purpose and worked with her new psychiatrist to blame the drug and then collect on its lowered stock price. While the new psychologist is caught, Emily is saved by double jeopardy. However, her original psychiatrist uses his position as her doctor and takes justice into his own hands by forcibly prescribing her a meds cocktail with some intense side effects.\n\nThe film stars Jude Law, Rooney Mara, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum. Side Effects has an almost Hitchcockian feel that is is both familiar and exciting for fans of thrillers. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n18. Psycho (1960)\n\nPsycho is another film that has seeped far enough into the social consciousness that its twist barely registers as a twist. The film follows an embezzler on the run who is killed at a run-down motel operated by the shy Norman Bates. However, when her lover and sister look into her disappearance they learn the truth about the hotel’s owner.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: While the investigation leads to Norman’s mother, Mrs. Bates, being the murderer, she was actually killed years before. She is now an alternate personality of Norman, and he has been dressing up as her to perform the murders. The film has been critiqued by the trans community and by mental illness advocates. However, it is still a favorite of horror and classic film fans.\n\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock, the film was nominated for four Oscars. It stars Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and Janet Leigh. The film is hugely influential, especially on the horror genre. From the shower scene to lines like “We all go a little mad sometimes,” the film is start-to-end memorable. It is currently streaming on YouTube TV.\n\n17. Les Diaboliques (1955)\n\nArguably, this spot should be taken by 1960’s Psycho. However, Pyscho was heavily influenced by the French film Les Diaboliques. Even the novelist who wrote the book Psycho is based off, Robert Bloch, said that Les Diaboliques was his favorite horror movie. If you haven’t seen Psycho, watch it; if you have, watch Les Diaboliques. Les Diaboliques follows a wife and mistress who team up to kill their shared lover, Michel, who works at his wife’s boarding school. However, his wife is haunted by his ghost.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Michel isn’t dead. He was working with his mistress and in on the murder the entire time. He scares his wife to death, knowing about her heart condition, in a ploy to keep his mistress and the school.\n\nWritten and directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the film was based on the 1952 novel She Who Was No More by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. In a 1995 review, Roger Ebert wrote of the film, “The famous plot of the movie usually deceives first-time viewers, at least up to a point. The final revelations are somewhat disappointing, but Clouzot doesn't linger over them. The most disturbing elements of the movie are implied, not seen.\" It is streaming for free on the Roku Channel and with a subscription to Max.\n\n16. Parasite (2019)\n\nBong Joon-ho’s Parasite is a dark comedy/thriller starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. Parasite keeps the viewer guessing until the very end, and it is a masterclass in suspense. The film follows a poor family, the Kims, who con their way into jobs for the wealthy Park family. In the process, they convince the Parks to fire their long-time housekeeper.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The housekeeper’s husband has been living in the Park’s basement. When she comes back for him, she learns the truth about the Kims and threatens to expose them. After a deadly brawl, the father of the Kim family finds himself living in the basement just as the man before him did.\n\nJoon-ho was inspired by another iconic Korean film 1960’s The Housemaid. Parasite premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first Korean film to win the Palme d’Or. It went on to win three Oscars. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n15. Murder on the Orient Express (1974)\n\nFilms based on Agatha Christie's books are often left off “Best Twist” lists, which is odd. As the “Queen of Crime,” her plot twists have helped define the mystery genre. 1974’s Murder on the Orient Express, based on the Christie novel of the same name, follows the detective Hercule Poirot as he tries to solve the murder of a gangster, Lanfranco Cassetti, on a stuck train from Istanbul to London.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Hercule is inundated with clues and comes up with two solutions. While the simpler of the two is that Cassetti was killed by the mafia, the other implicates all the passengers as co-conspirators. While he details how all of them could have done it, he decides to tell the authorities the simpler version.\n\nWhile more recent Christie-inspired films such as See How They Run and A Haunting in Venice are surprisingly good, it's hard to beat the original Murder on the Orient Express. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film stars Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset and Anthony Perkins. It was nominated for six Oscars and was also a commercial success. The film is currently streaming on FuboTV.\n\n14. Atonement (2007)\n\nAtonement is one of three period pieces from director Joe Wright starring Keira Knightley. The two had already collaborated on 2005’s Pride and Prejudice. Atonement is a rare period romance with a true twist ending. It follows a young girl, Briony, who misinterprets a situation and accuses her older sister’s lover of sexual assault. The film follows the lie over several decades and through war-torn Europe.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: While the viewer has seen a version of events where the two lovers live a life together, even though the lie has broken the family apart, they learn that Briony is an unreliable narrator. Later in life, she became a successful novelist, and the scenes are from her book and not real life. In real life, both her sister and her sister’s lover died in the war and were never reunited.\n\nAtonement stars James McAvoy, Knightley, Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave. It opened the Venice International Film Festival, making Wright the youngest director (then 35) to do so. The film is a slow burn, but the ending and twist make it a heartbreaking must-watch. Atonement is currently streaming on YouTube TV.\n\n13. Game Night (2018)\n\nDirected by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, Game Night is a rare comedy with a great twist. The film has several twists and follows a hyper-competitive couple and their friends who host a weekly game night. However, when a successful brother, Brooks, re-enters their life, he plans a murder mystery game that is interrupted by a kidnapping. While the players initially think that the kidnapping is part of the game, they quickly learn they are in real danger.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The kidnapping is revealed to have been part of an elaborate ruse perpetrated by a creepy neighbor, hoping that saving them from a fake kidnapping will allow him to be invited to future game nights. However, it was interrupted by a real extortion plan since Brooks made his money as a black marketeer. The film keeps viewers guessing until the end, and even the final shot makes viewers question if they have the whole story.\n\nGame Night features an ensemble cast that includes Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris, Kylie Bunbury, Jesse Plemons, Michael C. Hall and Kyle Chandler. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n12. Planet of the Apes (1968)\n\nThere are a couple of classic twists from classic sci-fi films (Soylent Green and Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back also come to mind); however, Planet of the Apes probably has the most shocking. The film follows the human crew of a spaceship after they crash land on a planet ruled by humanoid apes.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: In the film's final minutes, the protagonists find the remains of the Statue of Liberty on a beach. The planet wasn’t alien, but rather the crew’s home Earth after nuclear war.\n\nPlanet of the Apes has now become a franchise, and with prequels and an extended universe, the original twist may not hit as hard. It has also been parodied widely, allowing for even first-time viewers to see it coming. Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, the film stars Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore, James Daly and Linda Harrison. It is currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n11. Gone Girl (2014)\n\nGone Girl was written by Gillian Flynn, based on her novel of the same name and directed by David Fincher. The film follows the murder of Amy Dunne and her husband, Nick, who becomes the prime suspect.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Gone Girl has several twists, but the major one comes surprisingly at the film's midpoint and not the ending. The audience finds out Amy isn’t dead at all and faked her own disappearance. However, as she watches the news coverage of her murder, she decides that maybe killing herself to frame her husband isn’t how her story needs to end.\n\nThe film stars Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Carrie Coon. The “Cool Girl” monologue from the film has become iconic and even inspired the song “Cool Girl” by Tove Lo. The film explores the themes of gender, marriage and America’s obsession with true crime. Gone Girl is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n10. Audition (1999)\n\nDirected by Takashi Miike, this film is not for those with a weak stomach. Based on the 1997 Ryu Murakami novel of the same name, Audition follows a widower who sets up fake film auditions to try to help him find a new wife. Through the auditions, he meets the beautiful yet quiet Asami.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: While the film starts as almost a romantic dramedy, a shift happens, and the film becomes one of the more distributing torture flicks of the horror genre. The film influenced the so-called “torture porn” genre. However, unlike later films in the genre, like Saw or Hostel (which features a cameo from Miike), Audition is more restrained. While it is famous for its final torture sequence, the film is more profound than it sometimes gets credit for and is master class in tension.\n\nThe film has both been considered feminist and misogynistic. Love it or hate it, it is a staple of Japan’s J-Horror genre. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n9. Fight Club (1999)\n\nAnother David Fincher film, Fight Club, is based on the Chuck Palahniuk novel of the same name. The film follows an unnamed man as an unlikely friendship with a soap maker named Tyler Durden plunges him into the world of an illegal fight club and an anarchist group that develops from it.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: The unnamed man realizes that he has imagined Tyler the whole time and he himself has actually been running the club and anarchist group right before the group carries out a bombing.\n\nThe film stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. Fight Club has become notorious for being a bit of a “bro” movie due to its graphic violence, sexual content and popularity with young men and specifically the incel movement. However, Fight Club has a lot to say about the nature of masculinity and, while it is more evident in the novel, homoerotic themes. Fight Club is currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n8. The Others (2001)\n\nThe Others is a gothic horror film written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar. The film follows a woman, Grace, and her two photosensitive children who live in a large manor in 1940s Jersey as they start to be haunted by ghosts.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: As the haunting gets worse, Grace is made to realize that she killed herself and her kids years ago. She is one of the ghosts haunting the mansion, and what she thought were ghosts were actually the new living inhabitants of the manor.\n\nThe film stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan and Christopher Eccleston. The film won multiple awards internationally and was nominated for fifteen Goya Awards in Spain and won eight, becoming the first English-language film, without a single word of Spanish dialogue, to win a Goya for Best Film. It is available to stream on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n7. Malignant (2021)\n\nWhile the twist in 2004’s Saw is probably the more famous twist from director James Wan, Malignant arguably packs a bigger punch. The film follows a woman, Madison, who starts to have visions of people being murdered, only to realize that the murders are taking place in real life.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Madison discovers that the killer is named Gabriel, her childhood imaginary friend. However, Gabriel is more than that; he is a parasitic brother living as a half-formed face on the back of her head. While the twist is good, what sets it apart is how the entire film shifts in tone and subgenre. The film's first half feels like a serious, slow-burn horror, and after the twist, it turns into a campy-creature horror. While other horror films have also changed genres with a twist (Cabin in the Woods and Audition come to mind,) Malignant feels notably fresh.\n\nThe film stars Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young and Michole Briana White. Andrew Barker wrote of the film for Variety, “It's hard to say whether a film this bonkers 'works' or not, but it's impossible not to admire both the craft and the extravagant bad taste behind its go-for-broke energy.\" It is currently available to stream on Max.\n\n6. The Prestige (2006)\n\nThere are two 2006 films with a twist ending about the turn of the century magicians. While The Illusionist has a fun twist and is a good movie, The Prestige is better made. Directed by Christopher Nolan, The Prestige is based on the Christopher Priest novel of the same name. The film follows two magicians, Angier and Borden, who constantly try to outdo and screw over each other after Borden accidentally kills Angier’s wife in a trick gone bad. Borden becomes famous for a trick called \"The Transported Man,” and Angier debuts \"The Real Transported Man,” leading Borden to investigate how Angier did it.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Borden finds out that Angier is using a cloning machine built by Nikola Tesla to clone himself every time he does the trick. However, Angier disappears, leaving a dead clone and Borden as the prime suspect for murder. Borden is hung for his crimes, while Angier takes Borden’s daughter as his own. However, Borden does \"The Transported Man” by being a set of twins who share one life, and the surviving twin kills Angier to take back his daughter.\n\nThe film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Andy Serkis and David Bowie. Most of the critiques of the film came from the explanation for Angier’s trick and how it changes the genre of the film. However, looking back, part of the fun of the film is that it makes no promises about what it is “really about.” It is currently available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play, and Apple TV.\n\n5. Knives Out (2019)\n\nBoth Knives Out and its sequel, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, play with the nature of twists in mystery movies. Knives Out was written and directed by Rian Johnson. The film follows the suicide of an acclaimed mystery novelist, Harlan Thrombey, his family and his nurse, who is supposedly the last person to see him alive. However, when a famous detective, Beniot Blanc, joins the investigation, he believes that there is more afoot than a suicide.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: While early on, viewers are led to believe that Harlan’s nurse, Marta, mistakenly gave him the wrong medication, prompting Harlan to take his own life and leave his estate to her, his grandson Ransom actually swapped the medication in hopes of implicating Marta. The film is full of mini-twists and turns, which will keep the watcher reassessing their feelings about the characters and who is in control of the narrative.\n\nKnives Out stars Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield and Christopher Plummer. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and spawned two sequels: Glass Onion and the upcoming Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Knives Out is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n4. Oldboy (2003)\n\nPark Chan-wook’s Oldboy is an action/revenge classic. It is hard to explain the twist in Oldboy because so much happens in this movie. The film follows a man, Dae-su, who has been kidnapped and kept in a hotel room-like cell for 15 years. Dae-su is given an ultimatum: if he can find out why he was imprisoned in five days, his kidnapper will kill himself.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Dae-su’s imprisoner is named Woo-jin and the two went to school together. Dae-su outed an incestuous relationship between Woo-jin and Woo-jin’s sister, causing Woo-jin to seek revenge. Furthermore, Dae-su finds out that the girl he has fallen for is actually his own daughter, completing Woo-jin’s revenge.\n\nOldboy is disturbing for many reasons, including its intense violence. While it might be most famous for its hammer-hallway fight scene, Oldboy is surprisingly emotionally rich. The film is often regarded as one of the best foreign language, Korean and 21st-century films. It stars Choi Min-sik, Yoo Ji-tae and Kang Hye-jung. It is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\n3. Get Out (2017)\n\nJordan Peele’s directorial debut, Get Out, proved that Peele was one to watch in the horror/thriller genre. While his subsequent two films (Us and Nope) also feature good twists, Get Out’s is still arguably the best. The film follows a young black man, Chris, who goes to his white girlfriend’s parents' house for the first time.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Chris discovered that the family runs a sinister business that surgically implants aging wealthy White people’s brains into strong young Black bodies. Furthermore, his girlfriend has been in on it all along in a soul-crushing scene involving his car keys. While the twist is well set-up, viewers usually don’t see it coming unless they have seen the horror film The Skeleton Key, which has a similar, but less poignant, twist.\n\nGet Out is not only a great thriller but also a critique of White America and so-called Neoliberal politics. The film stars Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Lil Rel Howery, LaKeith Stanfield, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones, Stephen Root, Catherine Keener and Betty Gabriel. It was both a critical and commercial success. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning for Best Original Screenplay. It is currently streaming on Hulu and Peacock.\n\n2. Memento (2000)\n\nChristopher Nolan’s Memento is less about one singular twist. The film constantly leaves the viewer searching for meaning through its non-linear narrative. It follows a man, Leonard, with anterograde amnesia and memory loss, who leaves himself notes to help solve the mystery of who killed his wife.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: Memento features two intertwined timelines: a series of black-and-white scenes in chronological order and a series of color scenes shown in reverse order. As the narrative unfolds, the viewer learns that nothing is as it seems, and Leonard is not only responsible for his wife’s death but is also being used by the people around him due to his condition to target their rivals.\n\nThe film is sometimes considered a cult film even though it was a box office success and was nominated for two Oscars, including Best Original Screenplay. In 2017, it was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” It is currently streaming for free on Tubi and The Roku Channel and with a subscription on Peacock and Amazon Prime.\n\n1. The Sixth Sense (1999)\n\nThe Sixth Sense is one of those movies with a famous twist that you probably know, even if you have never seen the movie. The Sixth Sense put director M. Night Shyamalan on the map and helped popularize “the Shyamalan twist.” Starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, the film follows a child psychologist and a boy who claims to see dead people.\n\nTWIST SPOILER: In the film's final minutes, viewers and the psychologist realize that he has been dead the whole time and is one of the ghosts visible only to the young boy, giving a new meaning to “I see dead people.”\n\nThe Sixth Sense was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture, and was also a huge box office success. The film is iconic, primarily due to its twist, and has been referenced in everything from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure to Doctor Who to Supernatural. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\nBottom Line"
