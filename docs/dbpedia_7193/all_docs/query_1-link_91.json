If not circle or star the date now, because that's the date for the 24th Annual Neighborhood House Bicycle Parade and Ice Cream Social!\n\nChildren are invited to bring their bikes for decorating at 5:30 p.m. and then the parade will leave the Neighborhood House at 6 p.m. traveling up the Tracy Road and back down to Main Street ending at the Neighborhood House. The MDI Police and Fire Department will be leading the way, with the lights flashing and the sirens blaring!\n\nThen, it's time to celebrate with a Hot Fudge Sundae!\n\nRemember safety first and bring your helmet for the bike parade!"
