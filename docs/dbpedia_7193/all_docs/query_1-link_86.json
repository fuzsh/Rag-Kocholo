        "text": "Yvonne Furneaux, a French-born English actress known for her icy beauty and continental air who brought jet-setting panache to critically acclaimed films like Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” and Roman Polanski’s “Repulsion,” died on July 5 at her home in North Hampton, N.H. She was 98.\n\nHer son, Nicholas Natteau, said the cause was complications of a stroke.\n\nMs. Furneaux, an Oxford University graduate who studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, got her start on the British stage, including in productions of “The Taming of the Shrew” and “Macbeth.”\n\nDespite her credentials, however, she was often singled out more for her fashion model looks than for her acting prowess."
