[More]\n\nDirected By: Kristian Levring\n\n#98\n\nBlackthorn (2011) 75%\n\n#98\n\nAdjusted Score: 77354%\n\nCritics Consensus: Blackthorn invites comparisons to a classic Western -- and survives, thanks largely to a charismatic performance by a well-chosen Sam Shepard.\n\nSynopsis: Leaving Bolivia and heading back to the U.S., the outlaw formerly known as Butch Cassidy (Sam Shepard) has a final... [More]\n\nDirected By: Mateo Gil\n\n#97\n\nThe Magnificent Seven (2016) 64%\n\n#97\n\nAdjusted Score: 79277%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Magnificent Seven never really lives up to the superlative in its title -- or the classics from which it draws inspiration -- but remains a moderately diverting action thriller on its own merits.\n\nSynopsis: Looking to mine for gold, greedy industrialist Bartholomew Bogue seizes control of the Old West town of Rose Creek. With... [More]\n\nDirected By: Antoine Fuqua\n\n#96\n\nDead Man (1995) 70%\n\n#96\n\nAdjusted Score: 73484%\n\nCritics Consensus: While decidedly not for all tastes, Dead Man marks an alluring change of pace for writer-director Jim Jarmusch that demonstrates an assured command of challenging material.\n\nSynopsis: Circumstances transform a mild-mannered accountant (Johnny Depp) into a notorious Old West gunslinger.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Jim Jarmusch\n\n#95\n\n#95\n\nAdjusted Score: 76897%\n\nCritics Consensus: With a vibrant pastel color scheme and stylized action sequences, Tears of the Black Tiger is a bizarre, yet thoroughly entertaining Thai western.\n\nSynopsis: A handsome bandit (Chartchai Ngamsan) falls in love with a wealthy woman (Stella Malucchi) while a policeman pursues the man's... [More]\n\nDirected By: Wisit Sasanatieng\n\n#94\n\nThe Horse Whisperer (1998) 73%\n\n#94\n\nAdjusted Score: 76409%\n\nCritics Consensus: It might be a bit too eager to tug the heartstrings, but The Horse Whisperer is typically graceful, well-crafted Redford -- on both sides of the camera.\n\nSynopsis: When teenage Grace (Scarlett Johansson) is traumatized by a riding accident that badly injures her horse, her mother Annie (Kristin... [More]\n\nDirected By: Robert Redford\n\n#93\n\nThe Keeping Room (2014) 75%\n\n#93\n\nAdjusted Score: 78522%\n\nCritics Consensus: Aided by its spare setting and committed performances, The Keeping Room is just fascinatingly off-kilter enough to overcome its frustrating stumbles.\n\nSynopsis: During the waning days of the Civil War, two Southern sisters (Brit Marling, Hailee Steinfeld) and a slave (Muna Otaru)... [More]\n\nDirected By: Daniel Barber\n\n#92\n\n#92\n\nAdjusted Score: 80736%\n\nCritics Consensus: In a Valley of Violence offers a smartly conceived homage to classic Westerns that transcends pastiche with absurdist humor and a terrific cast.\n\nSynopsis: A mysterious drifter (Ethan Hawke) and his dog journey toward Mexico through the barren desert of the Old West.

Joseph Blocker reluctantly agrees to escort a dying Cheyenne war chief and his family back... [More]\n\nDirected By: Scott Cooper\n\n#86\n\nAppaloosa (2008) 76%\n\n#86\n\nAdjusted Score: 82416%\n\nCritics Consensus: A traditional genre western, Appaloosa sets itself apart with smart psychology, an intriguing love triangle, and good chemistry between the leads.\n\nSynopsis: Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his longtime friend and partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) travel the 1880s Southwest, bringing justice... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ed Harris\n\n#85\n\nAdjusted Score: 83885%\n\nCritics Consensus: On the strength of its two lead performances Assassination is an expertly crafted period piece, and an insightful look at one of the enduring figures of American lore.\n\nSynopsis: Infamous and unpredictable, Jesse James (Brad Pitt), nicknamed the fastest gun in the west, plans his next big heist while...
