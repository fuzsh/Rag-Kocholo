On the evening after their departure, Richard encounters an attractive young woman (Monroe) who has moved into the apartment upstairs. Over the next two days, he begins to spend time with her, even escorting her to dinner and a movie, but he is constantly wracked with nerves as he desperately tries to control his libido. Finally, beset by guilt and fear, he decides to escape the situation and join his family in Maine.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
