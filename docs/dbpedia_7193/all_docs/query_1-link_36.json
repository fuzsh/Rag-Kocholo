It feels like coming home, it really does. I don’t have to screencap! I have fun facts to share! There are videos and podcasts for research! Seriously, these movies are so much easier to write, you have no idea. I breathed such a sigh of relief when I saw it was next on the list. I have to say, it makes sense that we’d return to some of the better-known films around this point (and I’m including 20,000 Leagues and Davy Crockett). 1955 was a huge year for the company, and not just because it gave us the spaghetti kiss and coonskin caps. At this point in the timeline, Disneyland is only a month from opening!\n\nBut it took a long time before Lady and the Tramp was ready for the big screen. In fact, the idea for this movie dates back to 1937, when story man Joe Grant’s wife had a baby. He expressed interest in what his dog might think about such a thing and began brainstorming ideas for a picture. But Walt wasn’t satisfied with any of the script ideas. He felt that Lady wasn’t an interesting character and the story didn’t lend itself to action. The solution came when he read a newspaper story by Ward Green called Happy Dan, the Whistling Dog, which I cannot find anywhere and I’m sorry. This inspired Walt to add a love story between our rich, privileged heroine and a rough-around-the-edges stray, adding an element of conflict to the tale. Grant left the studio in 1949 before production was completed (once again, everything was delayed by World War 2), but his ideas still provided the backbone for the fledgling movie.\n\nphoto credit\n\nHowever, in the nearly twenty years of development hell, the story went through several major changes. Notably, Lady originally had another suitor, a spoiled wolfhound named Boris who now appears in just one non-romantic scene. Aunt Sarah was originally the stereotypical mother-in-law, with two cats named Nip and Tuck. The rat from the climactic battle was more of a comedic character than a terrifying force of nature, and it was going to be Lady who fought it instead of Tramp. Finally, Lady’s owners were originally called Jim and Elizabeth Brown, but the writers decided Lady only knows them by their pet names for each other. It also marks the final appearances by animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Wilfred Jackson. The former stayed with the company and became a director, while the latter was forced to retire by health issues.\n\nSeveral Disney mainstays can be seen in the voice credits for this film. Bill Thompson is back as no less than five characters including Jock and Bull the English bulldog, the latter of which uses the exact same voice as Smee. Verna Felton returns here, too, as Aunt Sarah, along with her son Lee Miller as Jim Dear. It’s also the first appearance of Dallas McKennon, who plays Pedro and the laughing hyena. This is his only appearance in a Disney movie, but his voice is all over the parks. He’s Zeke in the Country Bear Jamboree, Andrew Jackson (grr) in the Hall of Presidents, Ben Franklin in the American Adventure, and, most notably, the iconic safety spiel from “the wildest ride in the wilderness”, Big Thunder Mountain! His crazy hyena laugh from this film was reused for the hyenas in It’s a Small World, and has become a popular stock sound effect. Fans of the Crash Bandicoot series might recognize the sound as Ripper Roo.\n\nCritics detested this movie, bashing it for being schmaltzy and saccharine, with the action sequences shoehorned in. Yet it was a box office success, earning more than any other Disney film since Snow White. It even won a BAFTA for best animated feature. Like many other older films, history has been a lot kinder to it. It has a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and a place on AFI’s list of best film romances. It does have a reputation for being very sweet, but now audiences think it’s romantic. The spaghetti kiss has become one of the most iconic images in Western film. Not bad for a scene that was almost cut because Walt feared it would look silly! Also it’s getting a live-action remake for some reason.\n\nFor my part, I think it’s a lovely film. It’s one of those ones that I don’t usually think of when people ask my favorite Disney movie, but then I’ll watch it and be like “hey, that was great!” There’s not a lot of action but there doesn’t really need to be. It’s an interesting perspective exercise, seeing a slice of life from a dog’s perspective. And the visuals are stunning. I think I’d like it even more if it weren’t for all the ethnic caricatures. It’s not just the cats, either. But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nSTORY\n\nAfter the beautiful dedication to dogs, we zoom in on a beautiful snow-covered town. Inside one of the houses, a couple is exchanging presents under a Christmas tree. Jim Dear hands Darling a hatbox, and she lifts out… a cocker spaniel puppy! This scene is inspired by a real-life incident in which Walt gave his wife Lillian a Chow Chow puppy in a hatbox as an apology for forgetting a date. Darling is immediately smitten with the little lady, who kisses her new dog mama’s face. Jim Dear sets to puppy-proofing the house and tucks Lady in a little basket like a baby. It’s a nice little bit of foreshadowing, but come on man, have you ever seen a dog sleep? The humans leave and Lady tries to follow, but they put her right back in her basket. She howls and howls and eventually they give in and let her sleep on the bed just for one night.\n\nSix months later, Lady is still asleep on the bed. She nudges Jim Dear awake, despite his unwillingness to get up so early on a Sunday. He takes her outside for her morning routine, which includes digging a hole in a tulip bed (which she then tries to replace). She barks at a rat to scare it off their property in another exquisite piece of subtle foreshadowing. The paperboy distracts her, and she struggles to get the newspaper into her doggy door to bring it to her people. Jim Dear doesn’t mind that she ripped it. He’s just happy not to have any disturbing headline to read about, leading to a clever gag where he reaches through the hole in the paper to get his coffee. They positively dote on their dog, and it’s really sweet to see.\n\nThe owners decide Lady should have a license, so they get her one. Darling holds up a mirror so Lady can admire the way her lovely blue collar looks on her, and can I just say I have never in my life seen a dog react to a mirror like that? Lady races outside to show her new bling to her neighborhood friends, Jock and Trusty. It takes Jock a second to notice it, but his reaction is full of a grandfatherly pride. Trusty is asleep when they find him, dreaming of his glory days as a police dog. Jock breaks the news to Lady that Trusty has tragically lost his sense of smell. He wakes up and shows the same beaming pride in Lady’s new badge of honor, offering words of wisdom from his grandpappy Old Reliable, which Jock dismisses with an eye-roll.\n\nJim Dear calls Lady, and she races him home. He balances a treat on her nose, having her hold it steady so he can examine the collar, and there’s a really cute moment where he holds the door because “ladies first”. Jim Dear and Darling sit together by the fire, talking about how much they love Lady and how nothing will ever replace her. We’re back to the foreshadowing, and this time it’s a lot more obvious than the previous moments. I mean, obviously, if Lady’s perfect life continued there would be no story, but now we’re sitting here waiting for the other shoe to drop. But first, we have to see a contrast to these idyllic scenes.\n\nWe head over to the other side of the tracks. Literally. Our male lead, the Tramp, wakes up in a barrel and gives a big and beautifully animated doggy stretch. He saunters off in search of breakfast, all cocksure and every inch a roguish vagabond. On the way through town, he stops to play with some little puppies in a pet store window. Back to business, he decides that the local Italian joint is the perfect place to grab some chow. The chef, Joe, tosses him a bone with a good-natured laugh, and I promise I’ll talk about the accents later okay? Okay. As he’s munching his breakfast, Tramp hears the dogcatcher’s wagon rattling by and finds that they’re cracking down on unlicensed dogs. Cautiously, he creeps up to the wagon and finds his old friends Bull and Peg trapped in the back. Unafraid, he jimmies the lock and sets his friends free, biting the dogcatcher to distract him so they can get away. He escapes into an open garden gate and slips away to explore his ritzy surroundings.\n\nOn a different day, Jock and Trusty head into Lady’s garden, with Trusty actually yodeling Lady’s name. It is an awful sound. Lady herself is feeling a little down because her humans are acting weird and she blames herself. Jim Dear is preoccupied and freaking out at the thought of Darling walking “that dog” in her “condition”. Darling stops walking her at all and won’t even play with her, eventually hitting her for wanting a little attention! This poor baby! You can tell it was written and set at a time when corporal punishment was okay. As Lady’s flashback fades out, Jock and Trusty exchange knowing smiles. They know exactly why the humans are acting weird: they’re going to have a baby!\n\nJock and Trusty try to explain things to Lady, who’s just not getting it. So Tramp barges in to tell Lady all about how babies ruin dogs’ lives. To make it worse, he explicitly says he’s speaking from experience, meaning he used to have an owner but they threw him out when they had a kid. And those owners are terrible terrible people and they are on my List. Trusty and Jock try to smooth things over, reassuring Lady that her humans love her, but Tramp bursts out laughing. The elder dogs snarl at Tramp for being a “mongrel with radical ideas” and I cannot help thinking of some of the upper execs scoffing at younger employees and their radical ideas like unions and fair wages. Sigh. Anyway, Jock chases Tramp away from the yard, but not before he issues the ominous warning “when a baby moves in, a dog moves out.”\n\nDisney uses the old flipping calendar gag to mark the passage of time, and we enter the only pregnancy montage I’ve ever seen that doesn’t trigger my tokophobia. This is mostly because it’s done incredibly subtlety through the perspective of a character who doesn’t understand it but I do appreciate it. Discussions of the baby’s sex include Jim Dear hauling out sporting equipment while Darling compiles a list of names that all seem to start with Betty. Darling’s cravings drive Jim Dear into a blizzard to pick up watermelon (out of season!) and chop suey. At the baby shower, Darling’s friends titter about how “radiant” she looks, while Jim Dear’s laugh about how terrible he looks. And I really have to ask… why do Darling’s friends call her Darling if that’s Jim Dear’s pet name for her? Finally, the due date arrives on a dark and rainy night. But the ghastly weather doesn’t stop Jim from being so happy he doesn’t know what to do with himself and it’s kind of adorable. It’s a boy!\n\nPoor Lady still feels left out. She carefully creeps up the stairs, wondering what all the fuss is about and what a baby really is. She pushes open the door to the baby’s room to find one of the sweetest, softest scenes in the Disney canon. At its core, it’s just Darling singing a lullaby to her rather terrifying child. But the lighting and the movement is just so gentle, it makes the moment really, truly beautiful. Jim Dear comes in to be with his family and reaches down to Lady. This poor dog flinches like she’s afraid to be struck again, but Jim lifts her up so she can see the baby. She gives a little pup smile and wags her tail. And everything’s going to be all right.\n\nThe warm fuzzies don’t last long. After an unspecified but probably short while, Jim Dear and Darling go out of town because they’re awful parents. Jim Dear’s Aunt Sarah shows up to babysit, shooing them out of the house and slamming the door on Lady in her haste. This is our first sign that she is not a good person. Undeterred, Lady races around the house to get in through her dog door and back up to the baby’s room. Aunt Sarah is horrified that the dog would get close to the baby and chases Lady away. When the baby cries, Aunt Sarah assumes that Lady frightened it and tries to soothe it with a lullaby so screechy that even Lady cringes. And honestly, woman, where do you get off treating someone else’s dog like this? Did you not know she was going to be part of the deal when you agreed to house sit?\n\nBut the worst thing about Aunt Sarah, at least as far as this movie is concerned, is… she’s a cat person! And oh, these cats. These Siamese cats. I miss the days when I didn’t have to talk about race in every review. Can we go back to that? Because I’d much rather do that than mention Si and Am and their slanty eyes, buck teeth, and offensive accents. To put a little cultural context to 1955, this is not terribly long after World War 2 when the US was at war with Japan, so public perception of East Asian people was still not great. That doesn’t make it right. At all. Actually, it kinda makes it worse because they’re not Japanese, they’re Thai, but I’m just saying. It’s that stupid Yellow Peril trope that gives us such characters as Fu Manchu and Sao Feng from Pirates. Anyway, these racial stereotypes wreck the house despite Lady’s best efforts to stop them. The icing on the cake is them pretending to be horribly injured when Aunt Sarah comes to investigate the noise. The horrible woman immediately blames Lady for the mess, and the cats congratulate each other on a job well done.\n\nAunt Sarah leaves the newborn alone in the house with those awful cats to take Lady to the pet store. Who muzzles somebody else’s dog? Like, I know you’re not a dog person but… she’s not your dog! And on top of that, it’s really bad for dogs to have a full muzzle on for more than like half an hour. Aunt Sarah is The Worst. Lady escapes the pet store guy and runs for it, tearing down the street. She escapes that horrible woman but finds herself down an alley, cornered by vicious junkyard dogs. The Tramp hears the commotion and hurries over to help, taking on all three dogs and winning with no effort at all. His fearsome snarling subsides immediately when the dogs run, and he turns to make sure Lady’s okay. When he sees the muzzle, there’s no hesitation. He knows they’ve got to get rid of it. Luckily, he has an idea….\n\nTramp leads Lady to the local zoo. Lady balks at the sign declaring “No Dogs Allowed”, but Tramp’s completely unfazed. He spots a professor walking past and trots up to his side, catching the attention of the stereotypically Irish police officer. The professor protests that Tramp isn’t his dog but Tramp jumps into his arms and licks his face, setting off that Irish temper. Comic violence ensues at the poor professor’s expense, and the two dogs slip into the zoo unnoticed. Now they just have to find someone to get rid of the muzzle. Apes won’t work because they’re basically humans, and the alligator is happy to help but too big to do it safely much to the amusement of the Ripper Roo hyenas. To add to Lady’s bad day, she almost gets hit by a falling tree.\n\nFurious, Tramp jumps into an enclosure to give the culprit a piece of his mind. But it’s a beaver- the perfect solution to their problem! The beaver clearly inspired Gopher from Winnie the Pooh, even sharing a voice actor and a ssssschpeech impediment, and he’s far too busy building his dam to talk. Tramp thinks fast and spins the situation into a sales pitch, tricking the beaver into thinking the muzzle is a log-puller. Even Lady gets in on the con, chiming in that the beaver can keep the thing as a “free sample”. And can I just say that I love when the innocent, sheltered one in these kinds of stories starts to cotton on to the street-wise one’s ways? More on this later, but it’s one of the many reasons I love their relationship.\n\nMission accomplished! Tramp then takes Lady into town. She tells him all the awful things that happened to her (offscreen, thank you), and he tells her all about life when you’re not tied down. He’s got different families for every day of the week in this unusually multicultural neighborhood. One’s German, one’s Irish, and they’re all really willing to throw some table scraps at this stray. They’ve even given him different names. He’s very proud of his freedom, and gives a pretty persuasive speech about how nice it is to be “footloose and collar-free”. His nose leads him to the perfect place for dinner and the scene everyone remembers from this film: Tony’s!\n\nI was all ready to rip Tony apart for being yet another ethnic stereotype. I mean, I’m Italian. My grandfather came over from Ellis Island. This one, of all the caricatures we’ve seen on the blog so far, is near and dear to my heart. But I couldn’t help smiling whenever he and Joe were on screen. They’re just such a warm, fuzzy, homey presence that reminded me of big family dinners with my grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They’re Italian stereotypes, but they’re positive ones, so I’ll give them a pass. He sees the stray he’s affectionately named Butch and greets him with lots of pets and scritches and Tramp licks his face and the two snuggle on the ground before Tony asks Joe to go in and get some bones. And then he notices that Tramp brought a “little cocker Spanish girl” and starts giving this dog dating advice. It’s only weird if you think about it too much. Otherwise, we’re so endeared to Lady and Tramp already that of course this guy wants them to be happy. We want them to be happy.\n\nWhat’s definitely a little weird is the way Tony immediately starts setting a romantic table complete with candlelight. He even sets out a menu! I ruined this joke in my cold open but it is a sloowwwww night at Tony’s. Joe returns with the bones and Tony flies into an Italian rage (“whassamatta you?”) and insists Tramp ordered spaghetti. Joe looks at him like he’s crazy but he does grudgingly bring out the pasta when Tony yells at him again. And so begins one of the most romantic sequences in Disney. The pasta comes out, Tony gets an accordion, and Joe gets a mandolin. They serenade the dogs as they share their meal, eventually picking up the same noodle and accidentally kissing we’ve all seen this part because it’s so cute. She blushes with actual literal stars in her eyes, and Tramp pushes the last meatball over to her. The set-up of dogs eating pasta and being serenaded by restauranters is so ludicrous Walt didn’t want this part in the movie. Animator Frank Thomas was adamant that he could make it work, and after Walt axed it, he went home and animated it all on his own. Walt was so impressed by the work that he decided it could stay. And now it’s the highlight of the film!\n\nOur two young lovers spend a beautiful evening walking through the park and defacing wet cement. They walk across the bridge from Cinderella until they come to Makeout Point. Things get kinda snuggly, and we fade out. The next morning, Lady and the Tramp wake up, still pressed together. It’s heavily, heavily implied that they actually slept together outside of wedlock in a Disney movie in 1955. This is crazy to think about, honestly, but hey, I’m just saying what I’m watching. Lady is horrified at what she’s done and gasps that she needs to get home. Tramp’s like “why” and gives this wonderful speech about how nice it is to be a stray in the big world, and how there are so many experiences she has yet to live. She’s sorely tempted, but her duty is to the baby. He doesn’t push it. He sees how important her family is to her and he respects that, so he agrees to take her home. It’s just one more reason why these two are one of the best Disney couples.\n\nStill, Tramp is an instigator at heart. He stops along the walk to slyly ask Lady if she’s ever chased chickens. She’s appalled, but he leads her right into a fenced-in coop. He assuages her concerns by promising that they won’t hurt them, they’re just giving them exercise. Lady doesn’t see it that way, but Tramp won’t be stopped. He lunges in, barking madly, and sends the chickens into a frenzy. It’s all fun and games until the farmer hears the racket. He rushes out with a shotgun, missing Lady by half an inch. He keeps blasting apart his own fence, but as always, the guy learned to shoot from the Stormtroopers. Lady and Tramp escape with their lives, but the pampered Lady can’t run as fast as the more active Tramp. To make things worse, the dogcatcher’s wagon rattles around the corner. Tramp finally turns around when he notices Lady is no longer answering him, but it’s too late. By the time he retraces his steps, she’s already in the back of the wagon, on her way to a Sarah McLachlan commercial.\n\nSeriously. All the dogs in the pound howl piteously to the tune of Home Sweet Home. Several of them cry. It is heartwrenching and I hate it. But then the tone drastically shifts, and we see that all this heartstring-tugging is a ruse so they can cover the sounds of Dachsie the creatively-named Dachsund digging a hole to freedom. Lady meets Bull the Bulldog, Toughie the Mutt, and Pedro the Chihuahua, all of whom are ethnic stereotypes especially Pedro. There’s also a lot of expensive purebreds in this pound. You know how much people will pay for a bulldog? They all make fun of the little rich girl all locked up in the pound until the best character in the movie saunters in to get them to knock it off. Peg the sassy, world-weary Pekignese promises that the boys are a bunch of boneheads but they don’t mean any harm. Boris the Russian wolfhound chimes in with a little bit of philosophy that can basically be summed up as schadenfreude.\n\nPeg adds that Lady will be just fine. She’s got a license, after all, which means there are people who love her and she’s only there until the dogcatcher calls them. She doesn’t have to worry about the fate that’s about to befall the dog outside the enclosure. The mood switches wildly again, and we actually see the pound workers bring poor Nutsy to be euthanized! Every time I watch this movie, I forget about that scene and have to take a step back. Woah. That got dark. The dogs pour one out for their fallen friend, lamenting fondly that he at least died free, or at least that’s what the Tramp says. They chat about how much they admire the guy for never getting caught, and this piques Lady’s interest. But Tramp has one weakness: women. And this guy really gets around. Even Peg got a piece of him. Thinking she was just a notch in the guy’s proverbial bedpost, Lady is horrified.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Toughie nonchalantly laughs that Tramp is never serious about his girlfriends. But Boris isn’t too sure he can keep up his womanizing ways. He’s sure that someday, some girl will prove to be so special to him that he’ll give everything up. When that day comes, he’ll get careless, and then he’ll get caught. Before the gravity of that statement can sink in, the shelter owners enter to get Lady. Aunt Sarah had the decency to pick her up and take her home, despite her dislike of dogs. The dogcatcher even gets a nice literal pet-the-dog moment. He’s clearly not a villain, just a guy doing his job. It’s just that the job in question is horrible when you look at it from a dog’s point of view.\n\nBack home, Lady is chained to her doghouse, feeling hurt and stupid for ever falling for Tramp. Oh, and then there’s another thing, a direct result of that night on the hilltop. Jock and Trusty come in and offer to marry her to save her honor. It’s a very strange scene, and it’s never been established ever that dogs even have a concept of marriage or chastity. Lady politely declines, saying she just wants to be left alone in her misery. So naturally, Tramp shows up. The other three dogs give him the cold shoulder, but he keeps making dudebro-y excuses about how he can’t possibly have been responsible for Lady’s predicament. Jock and Trusty offer to remove the pest, but Lady declines. Once they leave, she gives the cad a piece of her mind and it is glorious. She’s furious with him for leaving her behind and for his womanizing ways, and she’s not about to hide it. This is the most headstrong and independent thing we’ve seen a female lead do yet and I’m living for it. She may be naïve, but Lady has self-respect. Tramp knows he screwed up, and he slinks away with his tail between his legs.\n\nAs Lady sobs alone in her doghouse, the rat we saw before seizes an opportunity. This thing that’s straight out of the New York City subway creeps through the yard and gets halfway up a tree before Lady notices. She can’t reach to stop it, either, so she starts barking like crazy. It’s not even the slightest bit scared and gets right into the window to the baby’s room (why was that open?). Aunt Sarah doesn’t realize something’s wrong and yells at her to shut up. Luckily, Tramp hasn’t gotten too far away. He rushes back and asks what the matter is, immediately forgetting their tiff and getting serious. She, too, knows when to put aside her feelings and tells him, and Tramp doesn’t think twice about slipping into the house to save his girl’s loved ones. It’s so sweet and so telling about how strong their relationship is.\n\nJim Dear and Darling’s house has always been warm, and cozy, but now it has a feeling of foreboding. The storm outside and the long shadows make it feel tense and unfamiliar, as it would be to Tramp, and adds a lot of tension to the scene. It’s perfectly staged. Tramp noses open the door to the baby’s room. Lightning illuminates the monster rat, who has made it right on top of the cradle. Aaaand then they kill any of the tension by having the monster rat make this ridiculous rubber duck squeak. Was there no other sound effect they could have used? Seriously? Anyway, back downstairs, Lady breaks off the piece of wood her chain is attached to and runs into the house to her beau’s side. Tramp jumps up at the rat, overturning the whole cradle in the process which I think kind of undermines the whole “saving the baby” thing but what do I know? At least he corners the rat behind a chair and presumably kills it.\n\nLady checks on the baby, then on Tramp, who is nursing an injured paw. When Aunt Sarah storms in to see what’s going on, she sees two dogs, one of which is a stray that may be loaded with disease, and an overturned cradle. In her defense, the conclusion she jumps to isn’t really unreasonable. She locks Tramp in a closet and Lady in the cellar, screeching about what vicious creatures they are, then calls the pound to take Tramp away. Just as the dogcatcher pulls away, Jim Dear and Darling return home, wondering what on earth is going on. He tells them that the dog they’re taking away was caught attacking a baby, which understandably raises some alarms. Jock and Trusty lurk at the doorway to their neighbors’ house for some reason, muttering darkly that they always knew he was trouble.\n\nThe two humans let Lady out of the door as Aunt Sarah freaks out about how they need to keep the crazy dog where she can’t hurt anyone. Fortunately, Jim Dear knows his dog well enough to know something’s wrong and follows her up to the baby’s room. She points out the dead rat. Jock and Trusty have a change of heart, realizing how goodhearted Tramp really is and that he was only trying to help. In apology for the way they treated him, the two elderly dogs race after the wagon. Trusty insists he can track the wagon by smell, but Jock tells him to give it up because he knows he can’t. Trusty gives him a truly lethal glare and goes for it anyway… and he does it! His bone-chilling howl splits the night and the two of them flank the wagon. All the while, Jim Dear follows in his own car, looking to save this stray dog because… reasons, I guess. They get there just in time to find the wagon wrecked and Tramp safe and sound. But all isn’t well. Jock howls mournfully next to the overturned wagon. Trusty lies motionless underneath.\n\nTransitions continue to not be Disney’s strong point. Suddenly, it’s Christmas again! Jim Dear tries to get a nice photo of his son, Lady… and Tramp! He’s got a collar! And what’s more, he and Lady have had a litter of their own! Three of them are mini-clones of Lady, while the fourth is a mini-clone of Tramp right down to the troublemaking. I’m pretty sure genetics do not work that way but whatever. Jock trots up to visit (where are his owners?) wearing an adorable tartan sweater. Right behind him is… Trusty! He’s okay! He just broke his leg when he got trampled by a horse.\n\nActually, Trusty was originally going to die, but Walt and Peggy Lee both thought it would be too upsetting for audiences. It’s not like they make freakin’ Old Yeller in two years or anything. Jim Dear rushes to get some dog biscuits from the box Aunt Sarah sent, presumably as an apology. The older dogs remark on how like their parents the new puppies are, and how Tramp finally settled down. It’s a very Walt-esque moral about how the cozy and familiar are far better than adventure in the unknown. Trusty starts another Old Reliable story and finds… the puppies haven’t heard it yet! He’s so stunned he forgot what he was giong to say! Everyone laughs, and the movie ends.\n\nThis is one of those movies that I enjoy a lot more when I’m actually watching it than when I’m thinking of it. I mean, I don’t dislike it, but it does tend to get overshadowed a bit. That said, it’s a great, simple movie with a lot of really beautiful visuals. Its main selling point is the incredible strength of the relationship between our two leads. Our previous two romances have been very idealized and kind of come out of nowhere. They’re in love because the movie says so. I mean, nothing against Snow or Cindy, but their relationships aren’t exactly fleshed out.\n\nOn the other hand, Lady and the Tramp have a much more realistic approach to love. They aren’t sure about each other when they meet, but then they spend some time together. They go on a few dates (the zoo, and of course the spaghetti), and they fall in love gradually. But then things go sour and they find that they have a few differences, causing an argument. When push comes to shove, they realize that they love each other despite their flaws, and it’s happy endings all around. Not until Belle and Beast will we have another couple that really gets to know each other like that, and even that’s arguable. There’s a really excellent video on the subject by The Take here.\n\nOne final point to make is that the subject matter here is very mature for a Disney film now, let alone one made in 1955. I’m not just talking about what happened on that hilltop, although that totally happened and I’m not sure why it gets called a fan theory. Put into human terms, we have a rich girl whose life gets uprooted. She meets a poor scoundrel from the other side of the tracks who her friends don’t like but she gets to know what he’s really like. After a romantic date during which she gives him her innocence, he gets her sent to jail where his seedy friends tell her he’s a womanizer. She returns home, disgraced and pregnant, but danger comes. He saves her life, earning the love and acceptance of her family. It’s a pretty common story, actually, but not a Disney one. I love that they went there, even if they coded it by putting it in dog terms.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nOne quibble I have with this movie is that it relies heavily on the use of stereotypes in lieu of actual characters. It’s rather frustrating, because when the movie actually writes characters they’re excellent. Still, with two exceptions, the stereotypes come off more as playful than offensive. As previously mentioned, this Italian girl loves Tony and I’m sure there are Scottish and English people who feel the same about Jock and Bull. Pedro the Chihuaha is pretty questionable, and then there’s those cats. I’ve already said what needs to be said about the Siamese cats but oof. That said, let’s have a look\n\nLady is probably the most well-rounded female lead we’ve had so far. She’s demure and naïve, which is understandable because she’s six months old. Yet she has a fierce sense of self-respect that she’s not going to let some guy stomp all over. She’s plucky and she knows what needs to be done and she’s not about to let her loved ones get hurt even if she’s chained up. I saw a bunch of reviews that called her a bland character and I’m just like… what? She’s classy and sassy and I love her. Fifty-year-old Barbara Luddy sounds a little too old to play a six-month-old puppy but I do like her raspy voice. So did Walt, because we’ll hear it again at least twice more. Physically, she’s based on two different cocker spaniels owned by animator Hamilton Luske and the previously mentioned Joe Grant.\n\nThe Tramp is definitely the most well-rounded male lead we’ve had so far. He’s the only romantic interest we’ve seen in an animated film who even has a personality. He’s a loveable rogue, a little rough around the edges but brave and selfless when it counts, kind of like an early version of Aladdin or Flynn Rider. We learn pretty early on that he’s got a heart of gold- one of his first scenes shows him playing with some puppies- but he’s definitely flawed with his love of leading girls on. I think the movie’s trying to get across that his life of freedom is kind of empty, but he truly seems to love it. Larry Roberts has a suave, smooth voice that I really enjoyed listening to. I was kind of disappointed to find out that this was his only major movie role! He’s based on a stray the team found wandering around the studio and adopted so she wouldn’t be put down (awww).\n\nJock is the most prominent of the stereotype characters in terms of screen time. In this case, he’s Scottish, hot-tempered and stingy with a thick brogue. Yet, once again, it’s not really a bad thing because he’s such a positive presence. He’s like Lady’s grumpy old grandpa, and I got the impression that his owner is a banker or something by how often he talks about things being “expensive”. Sure he can get a little aggressive, but he loves her and only has her best interests at heart, and when things get real he doesn’t think twice about helping her. He’s voiced by good old Bill Thompson.\n\nTrusty is the other grandfatherly dog. This bloodhound is a retired police dog of some sort, and to hear him talk he was really good at it. He’s got the howly Southern drawl common to Disney bloodhounds (though I guess he did it first) and a habit of yodeling Lady’s name. He also loooooves talking about his grandpappy Old Reliable, much to the frustration of Jock.\n\nJim Dear and Darling are Lady’s owners. They love each other, and they really do love their dog, but they do get a little distracted by having their own kid. They quickly make up for it and form a perfect idyllic family unit. And then they make the decidedly irresponsible decision to go on vacation days after their kid is born, but I digress. We only see their faces a handful of times because the animators made the interesting stylistic decision to keep the camera low at the level a dog would see. That’s also why they’re called what they’re called: Lady doesn’t know their real names, so neither do we!\n\nPeg is me breaking my rule of not talking about all of the minor characters because there’s a lot of them and we’ll be here all day. She’s only in two scenes but I love her. She’s streetwise and sassy, a world-weary showgirl gone to seed, and she acts like a big sister to the naïve and sheltered Lady. She used to be part of a traveling circus type of show, meaning someone took the time to train up a dog to act and then dumped her the second the show ended! That’s horrible! But I love her attitude and her sultriness.\n\nAunt Sarah is the closest thing this movie has to a central antagonist. Her main crime is basically being a cat person. She’s so cruel to Lady for no reason- who muzzles somebody else’s dog and locks it in a basement? I mean, there’s not liking dogs and then there’s abusing your nephew’s beloved pet. She’s also basically the customer from hell to the customer service workers at the pet store and the pound, so that’s not cool. And worst of all, she owns those awful cats. I’m not going to harp more on them because I’ve kind of already said all that needs to be said about them in their scene in Story, but a pet is only as evil as its owner. Verna Felton is back, proving once again that she has amazing range.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nOne of the problems critics had with this movie were flaws in the animation. Which begs the question… what movie were you watching? This film has this beautiful, nostalgic Norman Rockwell quality to it that permeates every cel… until it doesn’t. The pound scenes and the climactic chase with the rat are all dark and gloomy, a visual shorthand that it’s getting real now. Both sides of the coin are brimming with detail. You can really see that this movie was inspired by the same feeling of turn-of-the-century Americana that gave us Main Street.\n\nAnother important thing to note about the visuals here is that this was the first animated film shot in CinemaScope (though not the first Disney movie- that was 20,000 Leagues). This is basically an early form of widescreen, which provided a challenge for animators who were used to working with a more narrow area. Only once most of the film was completed did the studio realize that not every theatre was equipped to handle CinemaScope. Walt made them reanimate everything again in the smaller Academy ratio!\n\nMUSIC\n\nThis film isn’t widely remembered as a musical in the same way some of the 90’s films are, but it still has some excellent numbers. They were penned by Sonny Burke and superstar Peggy Lee (of “Fever” fame), who also performed three of the six songs. Unfortunately, there was a breach of contract in 1988 when she said circulating VHS tapes of the film qualified as a transcription. She won the case and sued for 2.3 million dollars. That unpleasantness aside, the songs range from excellent to cringey, but the good ones are really, really good. Oliver Wallace once again penned the score, giving Lady a wonderfully catchy little lietmotif we mostly hear through whistling.\n\nPeace On Earth is a sweet Christmas song that serves to ease the viewer into the tranquil mindset needed to appreciate the film. I like it, even if the singer’s voice is a bit odd. It’s very high-pitched and warbly for a male singer. It’s the perfect opener for a film that thrives on the saccharine.\n\nWhat is a Baby? is our second song, occuring a full thirty minutes after our opening number! I’m not even really sure this one counts as a song, because it’s entirely recitative. The few lines that are sung straight show that Barbara Luddy isn’t really a strong singer. The dreamy effect meant to convey Lady’s thoughts comes off as just a little creepy and a little out of place considering the whole movie thus far has been Lady’s thoughts. It plays when Lady gets fed up with being shunted aside and decides once and for all she’s going to get to the bottom of things.\n\nLa La Lu, on the other hand, is a beautiful lullaby sung by Darling to her baby. In my opinion, it’s one of the most underrated Disney songs because it’s gorgeous. The lyrics make no sense (who calls their baby fluffy?) but all it needs is the sentiment. Being accompanied by the loveliest visual in the entire movie certainly helps! Seriously, look at this lighting. It’s stunning.\n\nThe Siamese Cat Song is the cringey one. I mean, I went on and on about the cats earlier, but it’s really quite racist. Who came up with the bright idea to write those terrible Engrish lyrics? That said, it is embarassingly catchy. I’ve had the percussion bit that plays at the end of each like (ba dum dum dum) stuck in my head the entire time I’ve been writing this. Just… maybe this one should not be on as many Disney compilation albums as it is.\n\nBella Notte is by far the standout song. Everything about it screams romance, and it just makes me want to snuggle something. Me! The most cynical person on the planet! Tony sings it so passionately, and then the chorus joins in and it gets so soft and dreamlike. It’ll just melt your heart. And yet, it doesn’t go too far into that horrible Valentine’s Day aesthetic I hate. It’s just the right amount of sweet, and that makes it one of my favorite Disney romance songs.\n\nHe’s a Tramp, however, is my favorite song in the movie. It’s the first jazz style number we’ve seen, and as we’ll see in the 60’s when they become prevalent, I love jazz music. I’m also really fond of these sexy showgirl numbers and this one stands up with Let Me Be Good To You and Why Don’t You Do Right?. Peggy Lee’s natural voice is on full display here, a rare alto voice in a long, long pantheon of sopranos and mezzos. Actually, I think that’s why I like it so much– I can actually sing it in its intended key!\n\nTHEME PARK INFLUENCE\n\nphoto credit\n\nOversized statues of Lady and Tramp flank the 50’s themed buildings at Walt Disney World’s Pop Century Resort, and the spaghetti scene appears in topiary form in the Italy pavillion during Epcot’s many festivals. However, most of this movie’s representation in the theme parks comes in the form of food. Immediately on your right when you walk into Magic Kingdom, the smell of Italian food wafts out of Tony’s Town Square Restaurant.\n\nTony’s is decorated in its Victorian best with portraits and a fountain of our canine friends. There’s even a window in the back of the dining room that overlooks a false patio where two sillouhettes can be seen sharing a strand of spaghetti, and at the Christmas parties you might even get a visit from the owner himself! Outside the restaraunt, there is a square of cement market with pawprints and the letters L+T, and the restaraunt’s next-door-neighbor is a hat shop decorated with the very box Lady came in! But don’t let the cuteness fool you. Their food is awful. Disneyland Paris has a similar restaurant called Pizzeria Bella Notte, and one of the four dining rooms in Shanghai’s Mickey and Pals Market Cafe is themed to the same. Hopefully those have better food. Seriously, their red sauce tastes like reheated Olive Garden.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWhat can I say? I’m a dog person. Lady and the Tramp definitely has a tendency towards the saccharine, but I disagree with the critics that that’s a bad thing. Sometimes, you need a movie that’s pure warm fuzzies. There’s some fascinating design choices here, and it’s a really interesting thing to see a slice of life from a dog’s perspective. There is some racial insensitivity that brings everything down, but even that is such a short, inconsequential scene it doesn’t make me as mad as the Natives in Peter Pan. Our leads are more developed than most of the others in Walt’s era, and their romance is one of the most realistically depicted in the entire canon.\n\nFavorite scene: The dog pound, despite all its weird tonal inconsistencies. I just love Peg so much."
