Foster, and written by John D. Klorer and N. Richard Nash.[1] The film starred Dale Robertson, Evelyn Keyes,[3] Frank Lovejoy,[4] Nancy Gates,[5][6] Paul Fix, Robert Arthur,[8][9][10] and Peter Hansen. Composer Albert Glasser composed the music to the film.\n\nTop of the World was released in May 1955, by United Artists.[12] The United States Air Force endeavoured to support the production of Top of the World as a means to inform the public of the work of the USAF in the far north. USAF photographers would work directly with studio cinematographers. Major Stockton Shaw was assigned to the production as a technical advisor.[13][Note 1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nUnable to fly jet missions at his age, Major (soon promoted to Lieutenant Colonel) Lee Gannon (Dale Robertson) is reassigned from a Californian air base to a weather station in Alaska, against his wishes. He perks up on learning that ex-wife Virgie (Evelyn Keyes) now owns a nightclub in Fairbanks.\n\nGannon reports for duty to Major Brad Cantrell (Frank Lovejoy), who explains to a skeptical Gannon how vital the weather situation is, apparently in a remote region near the North Pole that could be vulnerable to a Soviet air attack. Lieutenant Mary Ross (Nancy Gates), who handles public relations, is in love with Cantrell, but he has become attracted to Virgie and plans to marry her.\n\nVirgie reveals a dark secret about her marriage with Gannon, then accuses Cantrell of sending her former husband on a dangerous mission just to get him out of the way. Stationed on a large block of drift ice far north of Alaska, Gannon and his men are at great risk as the floe melts and rescue aircraft are unable to land. Cantrell pilots a glider to rescue the men, with Gannon volunteering to be left behind, then stages a daring return trip. Gannon realizes he still loves Virgie, and a relieved Mary realizes she has not lost Cantrell.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nDale Robertson as Maj.

Clothier were dispatched to Ladd Army Airfield and Baker Island Airfield in Alaska. The group were able to spend a month with USAF units filming their operations.[15]\n\nWhile in Alaska, the Warner Bros. crew were on hand to film a dramatic rescue mission from the B-25 camera ship brought by Paul Mantz. The scene was later incorporated in the final film. Shortly after, in 1954, the film rights were acquired by Lippert Pictures and United Artists.\n\nClothier was in charge of the aerial sequences.[16] He said he used an Arriflex 35 camera to shoot scenes in the film. Paul Mantz used his B-25 bomber as a camera platform for the production, as well as flying as a contract pilot in aerial scenes.[13]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nTop of the World opened in Los Angeles on April 25, 1955 to generally positive critical reviews.[18] Variety noted that, \"Details here are handled in such a fashion as to be interesting without becoming tedious as they blend into and service the personal dramatics.\"[19]\n\nAviation film historian Stephen Pendo in Aviation in the Cinema, considered Top of the World to have \"... some exciting moments during survival and rue scenes.\"[16]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography"
