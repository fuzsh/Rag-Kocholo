        "text": "You'd think it would be enough for filmmaker James Wan (Furious 7, Aquaman) to have two hugely successful horror franchises under his belt — with Saw and Insidious (both co-created with writing partner Leigh Whannell). But then he also went and created The Conjuring, which since its debut in 2013 has produced nine films in total, grossing over $2 billion at the box office.\n\nStarting as a 1970s ghost series, based on the real life investigations of married paranormal snoops Lorraine and Ed Warren, The Conjuring Universe has sprawled into a franchise that not only keeps track of the Warrens' demon-busting adventures, but also delves further into the haunted backstories of these cases with prequel installments set decades before the Warrens show up.\n\nSo are you looking to watch these Conjuring films as they were released - or do you want to absorb all the spookiness via chronological binge, kicking things off in 1950s Romania with The Nun? Whatever the case, you'll find both Conjuring Movies in Order lists below while we wait for The Conjuring 4.\n\nJump to:\n\nHow to watch in chronological order\n\nHow to watch by release order\n\nHow Many The Conjuring Movies Are There?\n\nThere are 9 total movies set within The Conjuring universe — three Conjuring movies, three Annabelle movies, The Nun and The Nun 2, and The Curse of La Llorna. A fourth Conjuring movie has been confirmed, while a TV series is in development for Max.\n\nThe Conjuring Movies in Chronological Order\n\n1. The Nun (2018)\n\nPrequel frightfest The Nun takes place in 1952 Romania, and stars Demián Bichir and Taissa Farmiga (sister of franchise star Vera Farmiga) as a Roman Catholic priest and a nun uncovering an unholy secret involving Bonnie Aaron's evil Nun from The Conjuring 2.\n\nRead our review of The Nun.\n\n2. Annabelle: Creation (2017)\n\nTaking place after The Nun, in 1955 California, Annabelle Creation was the fourth installment in the Conjuring Universe, but the second chronologically, depicting the origin of franchise breakout star -- Annabelle, the creep haunted dolll. It's the story of a story of a doll-maker who opens his home to six orphans and a nun, only to have an ancient evil released in his own house.\n\nRead our review of Annabelle: Creation.\n\n3. The Nun 2\n\nAlthough The Nun 2 takes place after the events of The Nun, it's actually the third movie in the timeline. The events of The Nun 2 take place in 1956, taking place four years after Sister Irene's first encounter with Valak and one year after the events of Annabelle: Creation.\n\nRead our review of The Nun 2.\n\n4. Annabelle (2014)\n\nThe second film made in the Conjuring Universe, even before The Conjuring 2, was prequel Annabelle, taking place in 1967 in Southern California, 12 years after the official origin of the doll. Annabelle tells the story of a young doctor and his wife who bring the doll into their home (to reside amongst other scary-looking dolls) only to have it make their life a living hell.\n\nRead our review of Annabelle.\n\n5. The Conjuring (2013)\n\nThe movie that started it all, The Conjuring, starred Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as real-life paranormal investigators/ghost hunters Lorraine and Ed Warren (whose exploits reportedly inspired The Amityville Horror), as they aid the besieged Perron family in 1971, on Rhode Island. Series creator James Wan directed this first outing, marking the third official blockbuster horror franchise he'd created.\n\nRead our review of The Conjuring.\n\n6. Annabelle Comes Home (2019)\n\nNext up is Annabelle Comes Home. Taking place only one year later in the story, in 1972, the Warrens' young daughter, Judy (McKenna Grace), must contend with Annabelle and other demons who escape the Warrens’ artifact room while the couple is away. Conjuring Universe (and It: Chapter One and Two) writer Gary Dauberman makes his directorial debut here.\n\nRead our review of Annabelle Comes Home.\n\n7. The Curse of La Llorona (2019)\n\nBased on the Latin American folklore of La Llorona, this Conjuring Universe spinoff follows a mother in 1973 Los Angeles who must save her children from a malevolent spirit trying to steal them. Starring Linda Cardellini and Raymond Cruz, The Curse of La Llorona is the most detached and removed tale from the franchise's ongoing story, only featuring Tony Amendola's Father Perez from Annabelle as a connecting character.\n\nRead our review of The Curse of La Llorona.\n\n8. The Conjuring 2 (2016)\n\nBased on the events of the Enfield Poltergeist in England, The Conjuring 2 brings back Lorraine and Ed Warren, now notrious from the Amityville case, as they help a family being haunted by a malevolent spirit in 1977. Whereas the first Conjuring movie brought about the Annabelle films, this one originally introduced The Nun, who would go on to receive her own prequel. James Wan also returned to direct.\n\nRead our review of The Conjuring 2.\n\n9. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021)\n\nThe actual eighth film made in the franchise is also the eighth film you should watch if you're doing a chronological binge. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It brings us into the '80s with a ghoulish tale based on the real life trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, who claimed \"demonic possession\" after murdering his landlord. Lorraine and Ed Warren are drawn into the case after they'd apparently exorcised a demon out of a young boy's body... accidentally causing it to flee into Arne.\n\nRead our review of The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.\n\nHow to Watch The Conjuring Movies by Release Date\n\nIf you're looking to watch all the movies in theatrical release order, the correct list is below:\n\nThe Conjuring (2013)\n\nAnnabelle (2014)\n\nThe Conjuring 2 (2016)\n\nAnnabelle: Creation (2017)\n\nThe Nun (2018)\n\nThe Curse of La Llorona (2019)\n\nAnnabelle Comes Home (2019)\n\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021)\n\nThe Nun 2 (2023)\n\nHow to Watch The Annabelle Movies in Order\n\nWithin The Conjuring Universe exists two separate film trilogies: The Conjuring and Annabelle. The narrative chronology of the Annabelle movies differs from their theatrical release order, so we've created this quick viewing guide to help you out.\n\nChronologically\n\nAnnabelle: Creation (1955)\n\nAnnabelle (1967)\n\nAnnabelle: Comes Home (1972)\n\nBy Release Date\n\nAnnabelle (2014)\n\nAnnabelle: Creation (2017)\n\nAnnabelle: Comes Home (2019)\n\nFuture of The Conjuring Movies\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nFor those wondering what's next for The Conjuring films, have no fear, The Conjuring 4 officially has a release date: September 5, 2025. This announcement also seems to confirm previous reports that The Conjuring 4 will be the last mainline Conjuring movie. Franchise veteran Michael Chaves is set to direct the final installment, which earlier announcements from Warner Bros. have suggested will be titled The Conjuring: Last Rites.\n\nIn 2023, a TV series set in The Conjuring universe was also greenlit for the streaming service Max, though little has been revealed about who will be involved or how the series will fit into the franchise's timeline.\n\nLooking to watch more of the best Horror movies?
