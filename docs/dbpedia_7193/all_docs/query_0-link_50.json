        "text": "The Ballad of Josie (1967)\n\nDoris Day lets her hair down as a western widow in Andrew V. McLaglen's The Ballad of Josie. In the thoroughly feminist film, Day leads a band of women fighting for suffrage. Her killer fashion sense includes denim on denim, plus a burgundy plaid jacket.\n\nDo Not Disturb (1965)\n\nJanet Harper (Day) is an all-American wife who relocates to England with her husband for his new job. When she crosses the pond, her marital and style sensibilities become more formal. Here, alongside her Italian antique-dealer love interest (Sergio Fantoni), she wears a polka-dot, pussy bow blouse and coordinating hat.\n\nDo Not Disturb (1965)\n\nHarper’s life decisions throughout the film may be questionable, but her outfit choices are smart. Here she dons a preppy combo: A v-neck sweater, a corduroy jacket popped at the collar and an ascot as the perfect finishing touch.\n\nDo Not Disturb (1965)\n\nDay wears a monochromatic ivy green hat and dress as Harper, with the pop of a canary yellow gloves and matching handbag.\n\nJulie (1956)\n\nJulie Benton has a look of terror throughout the movie, for fear of her second-husband’s lethal jealously. She also sports some chic outfits, including this timeless white button-down and black trouser combo, with red lipstick fit for a film noir.\n\nLove Me or Leave Me (1955)\n\nThe late actress embodies 1920s jazz songstress Ruth Etting in this Oscar-winning motion picture. Day dazzled in a ruffly royal blue dress with eye-catching sequins and an up-to-there slit.\n\nLove Me or Leave Me (1955)\n\nDay captured Jazz Age style as singer Ruth Etting in a fringed flapper dress with rhinestone earrings and a cropped hairdo.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)\n\nIn this Alfred Hitchcock classic, Josephine Conway McKenna (Day) bests a bunch of assassins and looks sweet while doing it in a delicate floral-print frock.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)\n\nMcKenna (Day) tries to find her kidnapped son, while dressed in a pale blue fit-and-flare shirt dress. Fashion meets function in the search for her missing child in another country.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)\n\nDay sings her iconic, “Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)” number in this sharply tailored grey skirt suit accessorized with a classic black leather bag, matching hair bow and tulip-pink lipstick.\n\nMidnight Lace (1960)\n\nThe actress stars as the wife of an upper-class London financier who receives some alarming phone calls from a mysterious stranger. Day’s character, Kit Preston, speaks volumes in an elegant fur-lined cape with kitten heels and a sleek flipped-up bob.\n\nMove Over, Darling (1963)\n\nIn Move Over, Darling, Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Day) accessorizes a structured sheath dress with a prim bow headband and a coy smile.\n\nMove Over, Darling (1963)\n\nWhile Day plays a wife lost at sea for five years, she didn't lose touch with the fashion of the day. Arden (Day) comes back to reunite with her husband (despite the fact that he remarried) wearing a lemon-yellow tweed suit paired with a crisp white turtleneck and gloves.\n\nMy Dream Is Yours (1949)\n\nStaring as single mother-turned-songstress Martha Gibson in My Dream is Yours, Day shines in a beaded white gown and matching mesh cape, accented with a dazzling gold and diamond necklace.\n\nMy Dream Is Yours (1949)\n\nA beautifully embellished blouse paired with a black quilted skirt resembles an ensemble from a modern-day runway and Martha Gibson's (Day's) half-up hairdo looks equally polished in pin curls.\n\nThe Pajama Game (1957)\n\nStarring as a pajama-factory worker Babe Williams, Day rocks an oversized pajama shirt decked in hearts, symbolic for her unlikely romance with a superintendent, who is tasked with squashing the efforts of factory workers demanding more pay.\n\nThe Thrill of It All (1963)\n\nThe true thrill of the film was witnessing flawless housewife Beverly Boyer (Day) sport this beautifully understated shift dress and a string of pearls while starring in a soap commercial that makes her famous.\n\nTHAT TOUCH OF MINK (1962)\n\nAudrey Hepburn’s Breakfast at Tiffany’s performance is not the only onscreen style moment with an iconic French twist and sleek black dress. Day rocked that look alongside Cary Grant in A Touch of Mink.\n\nPillow Talk (1959)\n\nIn this 1959 classic, Day plays interior decorator Jan Morrow who shares a telephone party line with seductive songwriter Brad Allen (Rock Hudson). Here, a sultry Day is decked out in an ice blue chemise trimmed with lace and kitten heels\n\nPillow Talk (1959)\n\nJan Morrow (Day's) occupation may be an interior designer, but she also knew a thing or two about fashion. She stunned in this fitted white bateau-neck sheath dress ornamented with a silver, jade and diamond brooch and dramatic elbow-length white gloves (replicated for a Doris Day Barbie Doll).\n\nTea For Two (1950)\n\nPlaying well-off Nanette Carter, who longs to be a performer, Day sings a tune in a Peter Pan collar eyelet dress with a matching periwinkle cardigan draped over her shoulders and a classy string of pearls.\n\nTea for Two (1950)\n\nDay was well known for her stellar cap game, and it was on show in David Butler's musical Tea for Two. In this scene, Day sports a conductor style hat that is matched with a cropped, structured cape; the look is softened with a bow-tie blouse."
