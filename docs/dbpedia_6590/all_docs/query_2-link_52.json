        "text": "FewÂ remember – or evenÂ knew – that Gene Pitney’s breakthrough hit, “Town Without Pity,” was both the title and title song of a 1961 film. Even more surprisingly, the melody was written by DimitriÂ Tiomkin, who scored dozens of westerns, fiveÂ films for Frank Capra (includingÂ It’s a Wonderful Life), and composedÂ the score and theme song for Fred Zinneman’sÂ High Noon. He not only wrote the melody forÂ High Noon‘s “Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling,”Â he believed in it enough to buy the rights back and release it as a Frankie Laine single. It was recorded by Tex Ritter for the film and won Tiomkin an academy award for best song.\n\nTiomkin’s other enduring Western classic is the theme song to the late-50sÂ television showÂ Rawhide, which Frankie Laine also took up the charts.Â Two years later, Tiomkin wrote the score and title track for “Town Without Pity,” gainingÂ another Oscar nomination, winning a Golden Globe, and giving Gene Pitney his first Top 20 single.Â Pitney’s recording is included in the film, but the song is also rendered as a jazz instrumental and as a transitionalÂ theme. Tiomkin garnered several more Oscar and Golden GlobeÂ nominations and awards, but never again cracked the pop or country charts!"
