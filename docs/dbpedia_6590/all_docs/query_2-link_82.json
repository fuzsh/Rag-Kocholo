        "text": "DEMO DELIGHTS - Part of my collection being offered over the next few weeks!\n\nPlease make sure you're happy with the shipping costs before bidding. Due to past claims for non delivery, I will now only ship by secure \"Signed For\" service in line with eBay recommended policy with tracking number provided for peace of mind. Please be mindful of this when leaving feedback. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nGENE PITNEY COLLECTORS: Issued during 1961, here's a stunning and rare original UK white and red Demo copy of this classic film score tune from GENE PITNEY with \"TOWN WITHOUT PITY\" on the H.M.V. imprint # 45-POP 952 and backed with \"AIR MAIL SPECIAL DELIVERY\".\n\nThis copy has the 4-prong centre intact and plays superbly throughout with top audible quality and remains in a very strong excellent plus condition verging more towards mint minus with minimal surface sleeve rubs and the lightest of crackle on the run-in and run-out groove. The labels are very clean on both sides other than a written annotation on the 'A' side indicating the release date and with moderate spindle wear. Still paired with an original company sleeve making this very much a top copy for the collector (see picture scans).\n\nFrom my personal collection that I'm downsizing so why not check out my other listings for more great sounds.\n\nThe record will be shipped in a stiffened card outer by Royal Mail First Class Large Letter \"Signed For\" service only at a cost of Â£2.99 in the UK or, overseas by \"Signed For\" service at the costs indicated. This provides protection for both parties in the unlikely event of loss.\n\nPostage discounts available for multiple purchases with up to three 45's at the single record rate. Request total from seller and wait for invoice before making payment.\n\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT FEEDBACK WILL ALWAYS BE LEFT BUT ONLY AFTER FIRST RECEIVING THE SAME."
