Just give us unlimited crafting why is this not a permanent feature in current new gen IP's.\n\n2. Second for me it would be an unlimited amount of grapple attempts , with each of the \"grapple mods\" with no cool down. My personal vote would be an options menu rather than a feature then we can have access to another mod slot which would help allot of builds. I like using mid air but in the \"Grapple systems\" current state it does not allow for being able to. I love to grapple through maps and out in the world but with cool downs and limitations it takes away from my game play experience. I would like to be able to play as free flowing as I like, even without playing bunny. I enjoy fast paced builds that move around and have allot of aoe. Having the ability to have mid air and long range together as a menu option and free that mod slot. I'm going to speak briefly here also about \"collision\" mechanic. Please remove collision everywhere not just players. Trying to maneuver around the open world and bouncing off the landscape when we should be grabbing the ledges. We bounce off everything in this game.\n\n3. This might be controversial but I am going to bring Boss mechanics across the board. We need a better variety of boss fights. Please either do it now with new content. Please don't reuse the orb's. That's not strategy that is one of the most annoying fights and honestly it was lazy writing/design. With that being said, I enjoy challenging boss fights like this. But I am used to a community that know's how to do these heavy mechanics and makes pick up groups better. On the flip side to that though I feel like you need to ease people into heavy mechanics. During the story we had the 3 same boss fights for every single area and it got old real fast. Then you start tossing in boss fights and each one has a mechanic that is not for starters well explained. Nor are their any tutorials for these fights to get people ready. You can't just throw heavy mechanic fights at people when all they had to learn by was the same 3 bosses. You gotta ease into that for all players sake. Then we all get a better sense of how the game works instead of \"oh look it's big, shoot it\".\n\n4. A better system so we can organize our builds better. Let each Descendant have its own inventory and setup or figure out a way to make the current system to allow weapons, reactor and components. It could be as simple as an extra inventory menu to include only those certain things mentioned as to also keep our inventory less cluttered with having to keep up with so many things. I like to have things on me so I'm ready whenever i character switch. This would free up that inventory for people like that as well those who use the stash. Which means you have to port back to town and in this game, time is money with these grinds.\n\nBut that's just me :)"
