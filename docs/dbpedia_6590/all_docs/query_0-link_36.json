This SIXTH EDITION of the book has been exhaustively and painstakingly updated and rationalised to accommodate new, and for the expansion of existing, material. No sections have been omitted although I have taken heed of the feedback from the general public and trimmed areas that might not be as helpful as I originally imagined. The general revision of the book is the most extensive yet and although no information has been lost I have tweaked the sections and adjusted the format to cram in as much useful information.",
