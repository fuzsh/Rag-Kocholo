Special thanks are due to Janos Frecot (Berlinische Galerie); Michael Davidis (Deutsches Literaturarchiv); and Rainer Hering (Staatsarchiv Hamburg). Various grants were received for the writing of this book, including a University of Colorado Twentieth-Century Humanities Grant; a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Grant for Faculty; a German Academic Exchange Service Research Grant for Recent Ph.D.s and Ph.D. candidates; a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Seminar for College Teachers; a University of Colorado Junior Faculty Development Award; and two Travel Grants from the University of Colorado’s Graduate Committee on the Arts and Humanities. This book owes its germination to a 1994 National Endowment for the Humanities seminar on Berlin and the Weimar Republic: my first thanks go to the seminar director, Anton Kaes, as well as to fellow participants for conversations that jump-started the issues pursued in this book.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nagendas of surface and simulacrum It is in our time that the Enlightenment project has reached its ultimate implosion. In visual terms, the twentieth century of the western hemisphere will be remembered as the century in which content yielded to form, text to image, depth to façade, and Sein to Schein. For over a hundred years, mass cultural phenomena have been growing in importance, taking over from elite structures of cultural expression to become sites where real power resides, and dominating ever more surely our social imaginary. As reflections of the processes of capitalist industrialization in forms clad for popular consumption, these manifestations are literal and conceptual expressions of surface:1 they promote external appearance to us in such arenas as architecture, advertising, film, and fashion. Located as we are at the outset of the new millennium, some may recognize with trepidation that mass culture is becoming so wedded to highly orchestrated and intrusive electronic formats that there seems to be less and less opportunity for any creative maieutics, or participatory “wiggle room.” Modernity’s surfaces, entirely site-and-street-specific yet mobile and mobilizing, have been replaced by the stasis of the fluid mobility granted to our perception by the technologies of television, the VCR, the World Wide Web, and virtual reality.2 Perhaps as a result of this underlying discomfort, we appear to have a case of what Fredric Jameson has called “inverted millenarianism”:3 rather than look forward at future developments, we choose, almost apotropai1\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 2\n\n2\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\ncally, to look back at how mass culture emerged in the first place. In other words, postmodernity is living up to its name and engaging in a serious bout of nostalgia for modernity. Our culture of the copy without original, that is, of the “simulacrum” or the “hyperreal”—as the most extreme prophet of postmodern neocapitalism, Jean Baudrillard, has adapted Plato’s term—induces us, quite naturally, to feel a nostalgia for the real.4 We turn, then, from our technologized surface culture to look not for metaphysical origins but for a time when surface played a different, more dynamic, meaningful role in mass cultural formation. We do not, indeed, have to look far. Germany of the 1920s offers us a stunning moment in modernity when surface values first ascended to become determinants of taste, activity, and occupation—a scene of functioning that shows us there was in fact a time when the new was not yet old, modernity was still modern, and spectacle was still spectacular. Certain arenas of Weimar urban spectacle revalorized surface as the dominant “social space” of the era, to use Henri Lefebvre’s phrase.5 It would not be an exaggeration to claim for the culture (or cult) of surface in 1920s Germany the status of the visual embodiment of the modern per se. In order to recapture this spirit of the Weimar modern—both as material condition (modernity) and as aesthetic output (modernism)—it is first necessary to traverse back through the current condition of the “overexposure and transparence of the world,” to cite Baudrillard,6 toward a time when exposure and transparency first offered themselves as emancipatory advances. Rather than dismiss modernist practice for being—despite its avantgardistic focus on surface as the predominant generator of cultural activity— perpetually in depth-seeking error and in search of transformative social hope that postmodernism has long since cynically eclipsed in some undefinably superior way, I find enormous value in examining the tangible perceptual ways in which the modern era is still part of our own. I propose, then, that we reenact the surface terrain of Weimar Germany as one of the most dazzling examples of the modern period and reassess it according to its own merits. While nonetheless admitting that the gate to the immediate contemporariness of modernity is forever closed to us, located as we are within a later historical era,7 I believe there are more ways to understand the modern era than exclusively through the postmodern lens of recording modernity’s representational and conceptual shortcomings; similarly, postmodernist thought cannot, in all intellectual honesty, continue to use modernity to define itself along authoritative lines. A postmodernism that purifies itself from the modernist pursuit of pure form is only engaging in a new kind of epistemological error. Instead, it is the interconnectedness\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 3\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n3\n\nbetween the visual codes of these historical and political alternative cultures that draws us like moths to the Weimar flame. Most crucially, what attracts the contemporary mind to these years is the basic sense of (self-)recognition: for so much of today’s electronically simulational environment was literally in vitro during the high points of Western modernity’s “culture of momentum.”8 A close attention to Weimar is of particular value as an ongoing “bridging” scenario between modernism and postmodernism: Weimar can be seen as the singular era of transition from the modern to the postmodern. In key ways, Weimar design initiated our current state of saturation regarding the visual codes of consumerism. Our contemporary relation to the visual culture of the German 1920s is therefore much closer than we might think, even as we exaggerate and intensify its political and aesthetic trajectories. Hence what is needed is not a reclamation of modernity as any contemporary alternative to postmodernity; the more interesting endeavor lies in a reengagement with those modern elements that still underpin postmodern expression. The spectacularization of consumerist display contained the germination of surface culture’s emergence as a powerful conceptual and exterior entity, which Guy Debord dates as occurring in the mid-1920s.9 Debord’s study The Society of the Spectacle (1967) was written within the Marxist artistic movement of the Situationist International in France (1957–1972); in it, he offers a devastating critique of the (American, “diffused”—as opposed to Soviet, “concentrated”) spectacle as the con of consumerism and the dominant Weltanschauung of modernity and postmodernity alike. Even though Debord’s student-protest-era reaction against consumptionism has retrospectively been dubbed “paranoid,” or as “Adorno gone mad,” or at best a “lone voice of virtue and ethics in a corrupt world,”10 he remains a clear inspiration for current (and especially for Baudrillard’s) theories about how postmodern society actually functions. And, despite Michel Foucault’s attempt to guide us away from Debord (“Our society is not one of spectacle but of surveillance”),11 the latter’s theory illuminates how the spectacle, as the twentieth-century’s visual codification of consumption, is a true descendant of modernity’s homogenizing Benthamite panopticon.12 Debord recognizes how today’s panoramically soaked “spectacle is capital accumulated to the point where it becomes image,” a condition that was made acute by the fact that “commodities are now all that there is to see; the world we see is the world of the commodity.”13 His most pathbreaking insight, and one that Baudrillard subsequently builds upon, is that commodity aesthetics is no longer a cover for any deeper meaning, but has\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 4\n\n4\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nbecome the only option for capitalistic representation, that is, both signifier and signified unite/collapse in an entirely totalizing sense: [The spectacle] is not something added to the real world—not a decorative element, so to speak. On the contrary, it is the very heart of society’s real unreality. . . . It is the omnipresent celebration of a choice already made in the sphere of production, and the consummate result of that choice. In form as in content the spectacle serves as total justification for the conditions and aims of the existing system.14\n\nWriting on the eve of electronic interfaces with modern surfaces, Debord presents an all-out condemnation of how our spectacular society represents to itself, in the guise of the parade of the “autonomous image,” only nonmemory, antihistory, death, deceit, control, and the “autonomous movement of non-life”:15 Understood on its own terms, the spectacle proclaims the predominance of appearances and asserts that all human life, which is to say all social life, is mere appearance. But any critique capable of apprehending the spectacle’s essential character must expose it as a visible negation of life—and as a negation of life that has invented a visual form for itself.16\n\nFor Debord, then, the spectacle, as a spirally negative source of self-reflexivity, is the very furthest from the visual pleasure of consumer freedom that it appears to be. Baudrillard, removing the tragic tone from Debord’s analysis even as he remains entirely indebted to the latter’s thesis, finds that electronic technology has enacted ineradicable perceptual shifts on the spectacle. There is now no more “surface” in the modern sense; there is no more distinction between depth/shadow on the one hand and that which is situated above or outside, because there is no more “original.” Surface culture has become so endemic and our contact with the phenomenal world so permanently mediated that all we have left is an environment of simulation in which even warfare appears more real as a signifier than as an actual event, thanks to (say) the media coverage of the Gulf War of 1991.17 This state of displacement from the experiential real to the mediated hyperreal is so acute that the Three Mile Island nuclear accident happened, Baudrillard suggests, as much as a contagious reflection of the film The China Syndrome as of anything else, since “it is simulation that is effective, never the real.”18 This is the point that Jameson also makes in his assessment of the late capitalist era that has been witness to an “emergence of a new kind of flatness or depthlessness, a new kind of superficiality in the most literal\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n5\n\nsense”—a paradigm that no longer even cares to ask dialectical questions about “essence and appearance.”19 Baudrillard’s rather deterministic vision of the shift from modernity to postmodernity gains self-supporting strength from his emphasis on that epochal break at which, along the post-WWII continuum of exponential growth in communications technologies, the spectacle becomes what Baudrillard refers to as the hyperreal without a site-specific referent. Baudrillard points, with thinly disguised relish, to the pornographic ecstasy of our latter condition: [Modern] consumer society lived . . . under the sign of alienation, as a society of the spectacle. But just so: as long as there is alienation, there is spectacle, action, scene. It is not obscenity—the spectacle is never obscene. Obscenity begins precisely when there is no more spectacle, no more scene, when all becomes transparence and immediate visibility, when everything is exposed to the harsh and inexorable light of information and communication.20\n\nThere is now only surface as postmodern simulation, rather than modern stimulation: an invasion of electronic imagery into all things, a “forced extroversion of all interiority”21 that is our postmodern condition—in short, a perversion of surface culture. We have killed off our amazement at spectacle in situ in much the same way as we previously killed off God (according to Friedrich Nietzsche, in an excess of rationalism): we have developed technologies that turn the display button to an eternal “on,” and in the Global Village there is no difference left between public and private, outer and inner space. There is nothing more to show—no more desire for spectacle in the modernist sense of the word—because we are always constantly displaying all. What we have instead “is the obscenity of the visible, of the all-too-visible, of the more-visible-than-the-visible,” as Baudrillard effusively claims.22 How, then, can we best explain the gap between these bleak contemporary fin-de-millennium configurations of surface and the early twentiethcentury celebratory “primal scene” of the same? In defining the modern, Ernst Bloch’s “synchronicity of the non-synchronous” or “contemporaneity of the non-contemporaneous” (Gleichzeitigkeit des Ungleichzeitigen) is often applied, a phrase whose spatio-temporal sense of crisis initially appears at odds with any timely celebration of the new.23 But, as social historians of Weimar Germany like Detlev Peukert and Peter Fritzsche have noted, it is precisely out of post-WWI Germany’s highly uneven landscape of modernization that such creative intensity of cultural change\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 6\n\n6\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\n(and belief in cultural changeability) also emerged.24 In defining the postmodern, we find instead an ostensible emphasis on celebration, but not coupled with any motivating Blochian sense of contradictory urgency: this causeless playfulness tires quickly. The “key words” of modernity have been updated to appear like mere pastiches of the old (that is, modern): industrialized capitalism has become postindustrial late capitalism; surface, simulation; visible electricity, invisible electronics; film, channel-surfing (or surfing the Web); real place, virtual reality; political engagement, deconstructionist play (or now, its latest form, socially conscious cultural studies). In a state of exhaustion, the modernist new has passed over into what counts as the traditions of postmodernism: Jameson states that the writings of Marcel Proust and the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright, once revolutionary, are now canonical.25 Media theorist Norbert Bolz tries to put a positive spin on this shift: Modernity was an organized distrust of the senses. Today we are told by depthless surfaces to trust our senses again. The modernist insight went into depth, was revelatory, and tore off the veil from appearances— today we search for the meaning of surface on the surface. That is why we are changing our style of perception: instead of reaching into the depths, we are surfing on the crests of the waves.26\n\nBolz appears to replicate Marshall McLuhan’s vision for the role of electronic media in the postmodern age. Nonetheless our era has produced, for the most part, not McLuhan’s sought-after postvisual, electronically alert and interactive “extended” human being, but rather a visually overdependent, stimuli-deadened, debt-laden mass consumer.27 There is more going on here than just an epistemic dualism of modernist past and postmodernist present: material, technological and perceptual differences notwithstanding, we find ourselves today in a state of exchange referred to by the sociologist Mike Featherstone as the “trans-modern.”28 The creative complexities of the Weimar modern provide us, of course, with an important case-in-point.29 Of this “both/and” aspect Susan BuckMorss has stated: Modernism and postmodernism are not chronological eras, but political positions in the century-long struggle between art and technology. If modernism expresses utopian longing by anticipating the reconciliation of social function and aesthetic form, postmodernism acknowledges their nonidentity and keeps fantasy alive. Each position thus represents a partial truth; each will recur “anew,” so long as the contradictions of commodity society are not overcome.30\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 7\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n7\n\nBecause the contradictions of our involvement with consumerism continue to deepen along sociopolitical lines, the postmodern voice should not automatically claim that modernity has by now been emptied out. Perhaps we would do better to hope, along with the (unfashionably modernist) voice of Jürgen Habermas, that on some levels at least “the project of modernity has not yet been fulfilled” (significantly, for Habermas, in the direction of an era beyond that of postmodernity).31 Adopting the notion of the “trans-modern,” the following chapters redress the balance so that the many voices of aesthetic and intellectual modernism, as well as the myriad material facets of everyday life in modernity, are not drowned out by a postmodern revisionism that seeks (even if inadvertently) to reduce all of the modern in a supererogatory gesture to something that on some fundamental level “led to” the Holocaust, Stalinism, and Hiroshima. Jacques Derrida perhaps overeagerly assumes an end to modernity’s “domination” agenda with the advent of postmodernity;32 such claims aside, the entire project of modernity is not going to be leveled off as a false construction to which postmodernity usefully provides a clever deconstruction. Miriam Hansen warns against enacting such reductionism, lest the postmodern critic slide into the same conceptual “totalitarianism” that (s)he is trying to replace: The critical fixation on hegemonic modernism to some extent undercuts the effort to open up the discussion of modernism from the traditional preoccupation with artistic and intellectual movements and to understand the latter as inseparable from the political, economic, and social processes of modernity and modernization, including the development of mass and media culture. In other words, the attack on hegemonic modernism tends to occlude the material conditions of everyday modernity which distinguish living in the twentieth century from living in the nineteenth, at least for large populations in western Europe and the United States.33\n\nThis is why Hansen calls for inquiry that seeks to “reconstruct the liberatory appeal of the ‘modern’ for a mass public—a public that was itself both product and casualty of the modernization process.”34 This book is a response to such a call. Linked to Hansen’s antitotalitarian call for fresh approaches to the study of modernity is my focus on visuality. Evidently, the study of Weimar German mass cultural phenomena runs in its emotional core somewhat against the grain of the anti-graven-image (Bilderverbot) inheritance of Frankfurt School theory. We would do well to remind ourselves that the\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 8\n\n8\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\npostwar influence of the Frankfurt School has had, since Nazism, an understandably problematic effect on the study of visual culture per se. This often unacknowledged nervousness before “graven images” must not lead primary sources of visuality to be regarded peremptorily as symptoms of capitalist social disease in need of ideologically informed dialectical redemption. Nor has this rejection of images been limited to the German intellectual sphere: in Downcast Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in Twentieth-Century French Thought (1993), Martin Jay has delineated French linguistic resistance to ocular metaphoricity in general, a trend that occurred in precise conjunction with ocularity’s cultural ascendance.35 My study, then, is couched within what W. J. T. Mitchell has termed the “pictorial turn,”36 and provides the reader with an unabashed entrée to Weimar Germany’s visual plethora of historiographical-cum-aesthetic symbols of everyday life, to be studied in their own right. I seek to retrieve the consumerist spectacle of Weimar German visual modernity on primarily asymptomatic terms—not always as a proto-Nazi illness or just plain old capitalist “false consciousness,” the manifestations of which are thus eternally in error, but instead as a cultural blueprint of visual life that shows us where our images today have come from. This approach also highlights where our images have journeyed—into postmodernism’s subsequent transformation of modern street-based surface into electronically based simulation. Modernity’s obsession with and representations of surface may yet surprise us, if found to contain a greater degree of conceptual clarity (and even playful joy) than is presently the case in postmodern versions of the same. Despite this book’s return to modernity through the use of New Historicist tactics applied to visual history, it does not engage in a mere duplication of non-self-reflexive positivism: rather, Weimar visuality is resurrected here more as a “communal creation” of then and now, of constantly interacting aesthetic, social, political, filmic, architectural, and economic discourses.37 My scholarly intention here is a balance of historiography that Jean Starobinski defined, and Martin Jay more recently advocates, as one that touches both a panoramic perspective (le regard surplombant) as well as a more intimate, ground-level, close-up gaze.38 This hermeneutically double approach of applying philosophical and social theory to open up contextual source texts can be understood as a combination of theoretical with archival study.\n\nweimar surfaces now In what can be for our eyes a refreshing respite from today’s infinitely variable, unstable, and hence often confusingly schizophrenic hybridity of\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 9\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n9\n\nproducts and clientele, the style and visual effects of Weimar Germany operated as a significantly streamlined phenomenon. The sites of surface in the German 1920s were aestheticizations of function. They were the latest in artistic design and yet served the everyday public, and were very much part of the industrial economy of the era, having been built up along the model of the new industrial technologies’ production lines. Taylorism and Fordism’s demiurgic principles of infinite expansion and efficiency— techniques that determined the predominant system of labor, products, and capital for most of the twentieth century39—were adhered to in Weimar Germany with a unique fanaticism born of a collective need to repair wounded nationhood in the wake of the humiliations of the Treaty of Versailles and the ensuing loss of colonial and military strength. FordistTaylorist focus on the machine climaxed particularly in the context of the relative wealth of the Weimar Republic’s economic “stabilization” or “boom” years, after the inflation crisis of November 1923 and before the Wall Street crash of October 25, 1929. As David Harvey comments, conceptions and practices of space and time change according to a knife-edged capitalist dialectic, such that “capitalism perpetually strives . . . to create a social and physical landscape in its own image and requisite to its own needs at a particular point in time, only just as certainly to undermine, disrupt and even destroy that landscape at a later point in time.”40 In this way, the cult of surface was hewn out of Weimar Germany for a period during the mid-1920s, so as to reflect modernity’s idealized self-image back to itself.41 Consequently, it is not at all coincidental that in the relative boom phase of 1924–1929, Weimar society enjoyed a concomitant upswing in architectural output that entirely matched the economic philosophy of this period. Known as functionalism or Neue Sachlichkeit (New Sobriety or New Objectivity)42 and operative not just in architecture but also in all areas of design, art, and photography, the new constructivist-realist focus replaced expressionism’s rough, religious warmth with smooth, logical coolness. New Objectivity’s “nonstyle,” or rejection of decorative style, constitutes this century’s most concentrated systematization of surface, and has become one of European modernism’s best-known visual codes. Its discursive figures include such terms as “façade culture,” “glamour,” “asphalt,” and “surface” (Fassadenkultur, Glanz, Asphalt, Oberfläche), which appeared repeatedly in the media and literature of the era to describe the modern urban, commercial experience. Moreover, the intensity of people’s conception of the city was amplified by the fact that, due to the Wilhelmine era’s intense industrialization, Weimar Berlin was the world’s third largest city (after New York and London), its population rising to 4.24 million.\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 10\n\n10\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nThus entering the “roaring twenties” with bravado, Berlin acquired the position of industrial and cultural leadership over the rest of interwar Europe.43 The capital was host to 2.5 million workers, or ten percent of all those working in Weimar Germany.44 By 1929, more than one in four of the total population of 64.4 million Germans lived in cities of more than one hundred thousand.45 Evidence of Weimar Germany’s New Objectivist “surface” style was inscribed most strongly in the following ways: the transformation induced by modern architecture and the latter’s relation to parallel metamorphoses in fashion; the interrelation of outdoor electric advertising with the city street; the evolution of the Weimar film industry, with its movie palaces and film set designs as the respective extrinsic and intrinsic “surfaces” of German silent cinema; and the display of actual commodities in shrinelike store display windows. These, then, are the various topoi, the literal surface areas, that form the subjects of the four ensuing chapters in this book— namely, the radical social and aesthetic changes invoked by modern architecture in Weimar Germany, and its relation to the fashion of the New Woman (chapter one); the new architectural spatiality and human sensory perception inspired by electric advertising (chapter two); Weimar cinema as architectural event, both in film production and film reception (chapter three); and the function of the display window as a nexus of Weimar consumerism (chapter four). Thus each chapter that follows is indicative of how in the middle years of the Weimar Republic there emerged a marked celebration of surface culture in everyday urban life. In these chapters’ Geertzian “thick descriptions”46 of surface, where the topographies of high and low culture become almost seamlessly enmeshed, the joint aim is a cross-sectional hermeneutics of Weimar society—a spatial freeze-frame of surface phenomena as they developed during the New Objectivity years of 1924 to 1929. In an intersecting series of collations of surface phenomena produced during the stabilization years, I present here a synchronically based iconology of the German mid-1920s, in order to relocate and re-present that short, even fragile, period of “stable” creative output during which Weimar visual culture was at its most stunning and most sustained.47 Only in Weimar Germany did modernity’s cult of surface extend uniformly into all visual fields and come to dominate cultural and business production so simultaneously and so distinctively. How and when, then, was Weimar urban spectacle expressed? A useful preliminary exercise in this regard is to chronicle a selection of events that are characteristic of the speed of German interwar modernization, in order to gain a sense of the\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 11\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n11\n\nactual “trope” of mid-Weimar surface culture. The Weimar surface era first developed, however, through the U.S.-assisted economic recovery after the inflation of 1923—the year that Henry Ford’s autobiography was translated into German and became, as Jost Hermand and Frank Trommler term it, the “bible of the Weimar stabilization epoch.”48 In 1924, the Rentenmark was able to stabilize postinflation currency, the Bubikopf (page boy) hairstyle for women was introduced to Germany from France, and the first part of the Berlin railway was electrified. One year later, the effect of the Dawes Plan took hold and a steep escalation of visually oriented modernization events began: the year witnessed, for example, the opening of the Osram electric company’s “House of Light” (Osram-Lichthaus) in Berlin, for research into electricity; the prominent installation of the very first “traffic tower” (Verkehrsturm), the predecessor of the traffic light, at Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz, Europe’s busiest intersection; the first escalator in Germany at the Tietz department store on the nearby Leipziger Straße; the advertising journal Seidels Reklame marking its first quarter-century of promoting the German advertising industry; the Ford Motor Company’s first opening of a German subsidiary; the American dancer Josephine Baker’s arrival in Berlin; the opening of Weimar Berlin’s premiere movie theater, the Ufa-Palast-am-Zoo; Eugen Schüfftan perfecting his trick effect of mirrors for use in filmic architecture (the “Schüfftan-technique”); the display window competition “Then and Now” (Einst und Jetzt) in Berlin; the popularization of the Charleston dance; the founding of the first German national window dressers’ guild (Bund der Schaufensterdekorateure Deutschlands); and dozens of exhibitions in Berlin, of, for example, automobiles, shoes, clothing, furniture, radio, hotels, film and photography, and “hygiene.” This incredible pace of production and display was maintained during 1926, the year of several key beginnings, such as those of the Berlin exhibition area with its new radio tower; the movie theaters Gloria-Palast and Capitol opposite the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (Kaiser-WilhelmGedächtniskirche), marking the completion of the cinema area in central Berlin; Parufamet, the German-American film treaty in which the United States bailed out Ufa, the Universal Film-Aktiengesellschaft; and, most radically, Walter Gropius’s ultrafunctionalist Bauhaus building in Dessau (fig. 1). In 1927, the Weissenhof Housing Project (Weissenhofsiedlung), organized by the German Werkbund, opened in Stuttgart. 1928 was famous for such technological events as the “Berlin in Light” (Berlin im Licht) week, followed by electric display weeks in other German cities; the Mercedes Benz eight-cylinder automobile, which was billed as the “biggest\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 12\n\n12\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 1. Bauhaus building, Dessau, designed by Walter Gropius (1926).\n\nevent of the year”; and the Zeppelin airship that flew across Berlin and then on to the U.S.—events the like of which were responsible for the trade journal AEG-Mitteilungen doubling the length of its issues during that year. By 1929 (the ten-year anniversary of the signing of the Weimar Republic’s constitution, and the last expansionist year before the onset of economic depression after the Great Crash), the Berlin railway had been fully electrified; the rebuilding of Berlin’s Alexanderplatz was finally completed; the Karstadt department store opened in Berlin-Neukölln; Ufa built its first sound studios at Neubabelsberg; and Germany’s largest movie palace, the Ufa-Palast in Hamburg (with 2,667 seats), was opened. The heterogeneous events of the above chronicle of Weimar surface culture during the New Objectivity years all reflect the rise of a pervasive urban spirit. Tempo, or being constantly “on the go,” was not just the name\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 13\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n13\n\nof these surface times—although in 1929 it literally became a German brand name (for pocket paper tissues, appropriately enough).49 The pattern emerging from these “exterior” events entirely matched an “interior” rise of antimimesis in aesthetic modernism, which signified an abrupt end to the dominance of realism in art and writing during the nineteenth century. For the art historian Clement Greenberg, archchronicler of modern art’s shift toward the abstract, it was the new focus on visuality as pure, “flat” form that was taking industrial society’s obsession with surface one vital step further toward aesthetic iconoclasm. This was the case with cubism’s self-predication on the eye as the sole verifying agent that could see mechanically in the manner of aerial photography (just developed in World War I)—a mode of vision by which, stated Greenberg, the “world was stripped of its surface, of its skin, and the skin was spread flat on the flatness of the picture plane.”50 Because, however, modernist thought was both obsessed with and repelled by visuality’s rapid expansion into the social imaginary, modernism was also host to an uncomfortable rivalry between visuality and textuality, resulting in a schizoid (antimimetic) condition of representation. As Jay points out in Downcast Eyes, modernism brought with it not just a scopic fascination but also its opposite, namely “visual spleen as well as visual euphoria.”51 This tension within aesthetic modernism helps form an interesting feedback loop for Weimar modernity’s surface images, mirroring and influencing the desires of the urban masses on the street. In the German 1920s, the lines between the world of business and the world of the avant-garde become at times more than blurred: to adopt Jay’s terms for visuality’s role in modernism, it is increasingly impossible to differentiate between a purportedly avant-gardistic “ocularphobia” at work in high culture and a surfaceoriented “ocularcentrism” operating in popular culture. Instead, we find in the Weimar years continual crossovers in art and architecture between artist and society—the Bauhaus sought to realize its mission in applied arts for the masses, such as deornamentalized typography, kitchen units and other massproduced furniture, chinaware, and utensils, while architects like Erich Mendelsohn or Hans Poelzig built some of their most radical designs for the display needs of consumerism and the film industry. Similarly, applied arts like advertising were entirely adept at using those same formal shock techniques of visual crisis that were also the trademark of modernist writing, art and film. Modernist representations, then, as both afterimages and prophecies of industrialization, dared to draw new polysemous distinctions, the bold preconditions for the postmodernist epigenesis to come.\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 14\n\n14\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\ntactility in the city Modern urban surface culture was experienced as an outdoor “reading” of the city’s commercial life force, namely the street. These streets of surface in which zones of business, dwelling, advertising, and entertainment all simultaneously coexisted and intermingled were naturally located in the city center. City centers like New York, London, Rome, and Paris vied with each other for “world-city” status. Berlin, likewise, was an active competitor: “Everyone once in Berlin” was the bid of a tourism slogan about the German capital, and a tourist poster circa 1929 declared that “Germany Wants To See You.” But the world financial markets of the postwar years have since brought about a tectonic shift of urban identities away from their heterogeneous sites of modernity, and toward what social theorist Saskia Sassen has determined to be a far more streamlined postmodern condition of globalization. In The Global City (1991) and Cities in a World Economy (1994),52 Sassen shows us how modernity’s streets of flânerie— which were located in the metropolis, itself in turn the main showplace of the nation-state—have since given way to an erosion of national borders and new transnational market spaces, at least in certain selected cities like New York, London and Tokyo, whose financial markets guide the world economy and out of which worldwide corporations are headquartered. The global city, according to Sassen, is still governed by the rules of agglomeration and centralization, but it has more in common with its interrelated sister global cities than it does with its own host nation. Sassen therefore takes issue with the doomsayers of the urban in postmodern times, pointing out that globalization has not, after all, resulted in total decentralization of power out of the city. From the Weltstadt of modernity, we have thus reached the global city of postmodernity.53 Despite Sassen’s compelling depiction of the global city’s role within the new world economy, we need to account for the modern street experience’s demise in the contemporary metropolis. Here we can refer to French theorist Paul Virilio, who, in “The Overexposed City” (1984), investigates how we have lost the immediacy of street apperception that was so vital to the culture of 1920s Berlin or New York. “Does the greater metropolis still have a façade?” he asks, in the sense of a socio-spatial façade providing a break, boundary, or “urban wall” between the intramural metropolitan area and that which is outside the city.54 The answer, in Virilio’s dystopic vision, is no. Suburbia has denuded the city’s street-fronts of their modern discursivity. Worse yet: electronic transparency is replacing the traditional opacity of buildings’ surfaces to the extent that we are “no longer ever in\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 15\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n15\n\nfront of the city but always inside it”: there is only the “interfaçade of monitors and control screens.”55 In the computer age, continues Virilio, there is a loss of urban tactility, and the “architectonic element begins to drift”: “urban space” has lost its “geographical reality.”56 Here, Virilio is transferring to the spatial logic of the city Baudrillard’s thesis of the postmodern “ecstasy of communication,” where a “nonreflecting surface, an immanent surface where operations unfold” has replaced the Platonic “mirror and scene.”57 As Baudrillard also states of the new virtual urban condition: “To grasp . . . [the] secret [of America], you should not then begin with the city and move inwards toward a screen; you should begin with the screen and move outwards towards the city.”58 But unlike Baudrillard’s ambiguous poetics, Virilio’s vision of the contemporary-futuristic metropolis, where the new production mode of “interface man/machine replaces the façades of buildings and the surfaces of ground on which they stand,” is wholly negative.59 This electronic-human syncretism has supplanted the physicality of humans interacting with the city street and the ensuing act of “tact and contact”: instead we have the “elimination of attention, of human confrontation, of the direct face-à-face, of the urban vis-à-vis.”60 When Virilio looks back at the urban landscape of modernity he sees it sadly as a “‘Monument Valley’ from a pseudolithic era, . . . a ghostly landscape, the fossil of past societies for which technology was still closely associated with the visible transformations of substance.”61 Virilio’s epitaph for the tangibility of the modern city is extreme in its pessimism and is unresponsive to Sassen’s recognition that urbanism is doggedly persisting into the era of the postmodern world economy, albeit under a new understanding of what centralization actually entails. The site-specificity of the modern street is now the globalized centrality of transnational capital. In this context, we can refer back to Weimar Germany both as the apex of the urban modern and as the germination of the urban postmodern. Weimar spectacle no longer encouraged the directionless dandyism of the Parisian nineteenth-century arcades, nor was it (yet) today’s virtual (i.e., immobile) nonexperience of the TV-supplied living room; rather, it demanded one’s physical presence on the city street. “Berlin by night” was both actual and fabulated; that is, it was both real on the Friedrichstraße and “reel” in the genre of the “street film” (Straßenfilm) with its film-set urbanity. The flânerie that took place during the 1920s in such “world cities” as Berlin and Manhattan was rationalized, applied window shopping—a systematic feminization of the masses, as Andreas Huyssen has defined urban modernity,62 that bespoke the Fordist dictates of mass production and consumption, but was still host to a definite sense of place\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 16\n\n16\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nfor the visual effects, a location for the action, a path for the participant (the mass character of the flâneuse). Weimar visual display was created as a spatial experience whose location was still phenomenological and still on the (newly asphalt-covered) street. Postindustrial cities today, in contrast, certainly make use of, but no longer in fact require, a series of commercial streets to be the site of spectacle. They differ conceptually very much from the vision of the city called for by functionalist architect Le Corbusier, who wanted the street to be a “traffic machine,” a new factory “organ,” but not yet eclipsed as a display carrier by vehicular traffic’s demands.63 The electronically commanded surfaces of the renovated Times Square may shine brighter and better than ever before, but even this exterior glory is being undermined from within by Walt Disney and virtual reality arcades setting up shop under its very nose. Window shopping does not, for the most part, take place on the street anymore, but in the electronic home or, at best, in atrium-filled malls: even the recreation of Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz into a millennium-site of urban entertainment amply indicates this shift toward IMAX-enhanced interior space. Walter Benjamin’s claim that “streets are the dwelling of the collective” is no longer true.64 As Anton Kaes has stated, film director Godfrey Reggio’s postmodern commentary on technology run amok, Koyaanisqatsi (Life Out of Balance, 1983), has overtaken Walther Ruttmann’s modern film-poem of machinic celebration, Berlin, Symphony of a City (Berlin, Sinfonie der Großstadt, 1927).65 Such, then, is our loss of tactile urban living for which Virilio is so nostalgic. The majority of Americans no longer actually walk in the city. The city comes to us via the media wherever we live, so there is no more need to experience urban surface culture firsthand. “Real” modern manufacturing industry has sold out to “unreal” service industry, outsourcing, and a sheer excess of retailing. Our age is all but devoid of what Michel de Certeau calls “pedestrian street acts,”66 and the still extant flânerie of old, rich industrial cities has become all but impossible to duplicate. We may well ask: is there any such thing, then, as postmodern flânerie? Yes, but only in those few urban spaces whose infrastructure was established during industrial modernity (especially Manhattan, Boston, and San Francisco, or European city centers like Amsterdam, London, Paris—or even parts of reconstructed Berlin, and this despite its fractured inner city where the Wall once was).67 Or again yes, but only when the flânerie concerned is not based on actually walking in the city itself. Think of Stairmasters and other recreation-center regimentations of postmodern America’s\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 17\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n17\n\nrequired level of “strolling”—fitness in as condensed a temporal and spatial span as possible. The only places currently being designed to be walked (in the United States, but increasingly so in Europe as well) are suburban shopping malls, and even they are increasingly fashioned like Disneyland/Disneyworld/EuroDisney as the replacement village greens of today.68 Indeed, the simulational theme park of postmodernity has replaced the spectacular world trade fair of modernity. Outside of Disney in the postmodern urban dystopia, strolling in the city is all too often associated with the loitering of street persons: as Anne Friedberg states, the flâneuse has become a bag lady; and in “imagineered” shopping malls, where limited walking does take place but only in a safe interior, such ugly sights are banned.69 We can stroll in Disneyland, but when we do so we are moving within a “simulation of the third order,” as Baudrillard states: it “exists in order to hide that it is the ‘real’ country”; its function is to make us think it is imaginary, disguising that “the real is no longer real, and thus . . . saving the reality principle.”70 Umberto Eco agrees, finding the step from Disney’s “total fake” to the “totally real” of hyperreality to be an instant one.71 Las Vegas’s Strip now promotes itself as a pedestrian zone, but one that is an electronic film set intended to seduce the walker-gambler into the casinos waiting behind the constantly performing film-façades that reach out to the sidewalk.72 For Friedberg, the only thing that actually moves with us in the postmodern city is our “spatially and temporally fluid visuality”: if we engage in flânerie, we are not so much street-smart as virtually guided.73 The Weimar German urban street experience, on the other hand, even when driven rather than walked, was still set up for a spectatorship commanded by the peripatetic eye. While Weimar Berlin was one of the first (and last) metropolises to successfully combine mass transit (of train, tram, and bus), pedestrianism, and the new car culture, Los Angeles was the first city whose infrastructure fully superseded foot travel. Already boasting more cars in the 1920s than any other city in the world, L.A. signaled, in 1929, the end of the city-walking era with the opening of Bullocks Wilshire department store: its main entrance was in fact at the back of the building, to suit customers emerging from their cars in the massive parking lot; this back entrance was decorated with a ceiling fresco fittingly entitled “Spirit of Transportation.”74 The rise of the suburban automobile culture that decentered L.A. before any other city did not go unnoticed in the early 1930s by Nazi Germany’s castoffs—the left-wing, Jewish, or otherwise banned antifascist exiles, who soon began to sense that in joining the dia-\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 18\n\n18\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nspora to L.A. they had left behind what was, by comparison, the intellectual “depth” of Weimar Berlin and traded it for, as Bertolt Brecht felt, the false spatiality of the city of the angels.75 In short, in ways far beyond the surface culture of 1920s Berlin, Los Angeles of the subsequent two decades preempted the postmodern emptyingout of the metropolis—even as it seemed initially to fulfill the heavenly garden-city promise as dreamed of by expressionist antiurban utopianists like Bruno Taut.76 As urban critic Mike Davis explains in his City of Quartz (1990), boosterist Los Angeles engaged in a dialectical coalescence of façade “sunshine” and film-set “noir”: devoid as it was (and is) of any “civitas of public places,” L.A. became the “ultimate city of capital, lustrous and superficial, negating every classical value of European urbanity.”77 Erich Maria Remarque, in exile from his native Berlin, complained of his adoptive city’s surface paradise that “real and false were fused here so perfectly that they became a new substance.”78 It was due to the ubiquitous L.A. mode of movie-set-inspired “façade landscapes”79 that Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer felt justified in subsuming their attack on the Culture Industry within their wholesale rejection of the Enlightenment for having produced masses so ready for synchronization (Gleichschaltung) that they would consume or vote Nazi in the same blind breath—a process of massification that facilitated the reduction of the Jews by the Nazis to nonhumans fit only for extermination. The new “hygienic” bungalows on the edges of L.A. make Adorno and Horkheimer nervous in the uncanny resemblance of these “living cells” to the throwaway, transitory architecture (“unsolid structures”) of modernity’s exhibition era; both building-types appear to have been made only to “toss them away after short usage like cans of food.”80 The latter-day “panopticon shopping malls” at which L.A. excels these days are, states Davis, even more unsettling, born as they are of a desire not just to “kill the street” but to “kill the crowd”:81 thus the very harbinger of the urban modern, the (now multiracial) masses, are being eradicated at the same time that the street is being stripped of its walkable traces.\n\nexhibiting superficies And yet postmodern urbanity is not completely without steps toward reinstating flânerie, even in the suburban, electronic age. There are indications that the modern street experience can be revived, if only on the level of postmodern public monuments, which self-consciously lend themselves to the cause. A site of urban spectacle can be created that self-consciously plays with the architectonics of surface and material superficiality: indeed,\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 19\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n19\n\na longstanding landmark of this is Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers’s Pompidou Center (a.k.a. Beaubourg, 1972–1977) in Paris, an exhibition structure that is painted as bright as a playhouse and shows its interior plumbing on the outside, much to the delight of tourists who come for the tactile experience of enjoying its insane surfaces, riding its transparently encased escalators along the exterior wall, and neglecting the exhibits within.82 Another will occur if the artist Christo succeeds in gaining municipal permission to create his temporary Central Park Project: a series of yellow, cloth-draped gateways positioned along the paths of Central Park, designed for people to walk under and view from both near and afar, underneath and aerially, as interconnecting curves. Frank Gehry’s new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, which opened in October 1997, places the postmodern attempt at spectacle (a titanium-covered, silvery play of complex spherical structures, arising as if in whimsical, organic motion out of the ground) in ironically suggestive, dialogic counterpoint to the straightforward city streets around it.83 The most immediate effect of such postmodern re-creations of the walkable city is indeed recreational: for a surface spectacle that encourages, even demands, a participatory pedestrian experience is first and foremost a sign of urban self-confidence, and play. In this way, Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s Wrapped Reichstag (Verhüllter Reichstag) of 1995 (fig. 2), twenty-four years in the making, constituted an acknowledgment of postmodern nostalgia for the advantages of the modern city experience, in that it obstinately sought, for two weeks, to recreate the ludic power of modern urban display and individual flânerie.84 As anyone knows who was there that summer, the only way to experience this event was to go right up to the building and touch it, and then revisit it under a different sky so as to catch the alternating effects of the 330,000 square feet of aluminum-coated fabric covering the façades and the roof of the building—and of course to enjoy the ongoing street-festival atmosphere that its presence produced for the two million people who came to spectate and celebrate. “I have made a building out of a building,” said Christo at the time of construction: “For that I needed material, the structure of a material.”85 Its massive vertical folds sought to create a temporal pause in which surface could rebecome, in an quasi-retro way, the site of new spectacle: a veiling (Verhüllung, the Christos insisted, and not the more commercially inclined term for wrapping, Verpackung)86 that aimed for revelation (Enthüllung) via the play of material surfaces. It was a playful version of Heideggerian ale@theia, whereby Christo’s techne @ inspires a moment of truth that lies, conversely, in the “concealedness” of folding the veil rather than in any unfolding or “unconcealedness.”87\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 20\n\n20\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 2. Wrapped Reichstag by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Berlin, 1995.\n\nChristo’s literal surface-art also had a special meaning for Germany. By draping itself over the German Volk inscription and transforming the architectonic “horizon of expectations” of the building into something quite new, the fabric cover of 1995 temporarily detoxified, or dislodged, the overweighty monumentalism that the 101-year-old Reichstag had always signified for Germans, and opened up the conceptual surface area of the building to new possibilities beyond that of its burning in the Nazi spring of 1933 and its Cold War role as a bulwark of the West against the Berlin Wall only a few yards away.88 Christo’s wrapping, then, can be seen as an optimistic gesture that anticipated the Reichstag’s 1999 grand reopening with its Norman Foster glass dome. One German newspaper article insisted on finding a protofascist sense of foreboding in the wrapping of the Reichstag, linking it to a photograph of the monumental sculpture Kameradschaft (Comradeship) by the Nazi sculptor Josef Thorak in its wrapped condition before the opening of the German pavilion at the Paris Exhibition of 1937.89 Nonetheless, a more accurate hermeneutical gauge would be to state that the rarity of Christo’s Wrapped Reichstag is constituted precisely in the way its monumentality was turned on its head into a mas-\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 21\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n21\n\nterful Verfremdungseffekt, thanks to being remade out of surface, and hence could be experienced guilt-free.90 As Huyssen states, Christo’s Reichstag is a “monumentality that can do without permanence and without destruction, that is fundamentally informed by the modernist spirit of a fleeting and transitory epiphany, but that is no less memorable or monumental for that.”91 The brevity of the Wrapped Reichstag reminds us that surface architecture is a self-conscious expression of the transitoriness of the modern metropolitan experience. Nineteenth-century European exhibition architecture began this mode, with an unashamed emphasis on surface appearance such as the world had never seen before. This utopian construction style, from the Crystal Palace of London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 onwards, emerged in order to best display and fetishize, as in a museum, the industrial nations’ latest technological achievements and colonially gathered goods, promising even greater things to what soon rose to millions of world fair visitors (14,837 in 1851; 32 million at the Paris Exposition of 1889; 27.5 million at Chicago’s Columbian Exposition in 1893; 50.8 million in Paris again in 1900).92 In 1896 the social theorist Georg Simmel suggested that such architectonics of temporary excess was not only permissible but even desired, in that the “exhibition with its emphasis on amusement attempts a new synthesis between the principles of external stimulus and the practical functions of objects, and thereby takes this aesthetic superadditum to its highest level.”93 Simmel was thus the first to promote a clear “exhibition style” in such architecture: a liberated, experimental style that is unabashedly oriented toward surface and transience rather than toward depth and permanence.94 World fairs thus offered the viewer-participant an aesthetic of display on the grandest possible scale, and spectators were to be induced by the extravagance of exhibition architecture into thinking more highly of the commodities on display, which became in turn indivisible from their settings.95 As Buck-Morss emphasizes, here the spirit of advertising was born: “At the fairs the crowds were conditioned to the principle of advertisements: ‘Look, don’t touch,’ and were taught to derive pleasure from the spectacle alone.”96 Likewise, Eco stresses the “semantic apparatus” of exhibitions: “In an exposition, architecture and design explode their dual communicative nature, sacrificing denotation to very widespread connotation. . . . [I]n an exposition we show not the objects but the exposition itself.”97 All of this had of course a pragmatic reason for existing, as the Weimar cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer noted: the Parisian frenzy for “joy and glamour” (Freude und Glanz) was occasioned and stimulated by\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 22\n\n22\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nits serial hosting of world trade exhibitions in the latter part of the nineteenth century; these in turn stimulated the world economy.98 Benjamin, in “Paris—Capital of the Nineteenth Century,” declares: “Exhibitions are the places of pilgrimage for the fetish Commodity. . . . World trade exhibitions glorify the exchange value of commodities. They create a space in which their use value diminishes. They open up a phantasmagoria into which people enter in order to let themselves be distracted.”99 Benjamin finds industrial exhibitions to be a globalizing “synthesis of the arts,” a Gesamtkunstwerk of nineteenth-century aims.100 He invokes Faust for the modern age in the guise of the bourgeoisie who call out to the exhibition’s wondrous show of order, property and production: “Oh tarry yet, thou art so fair.”101 The most decadent, overblown example of the exhibition age’s excesses in ephemeral surface occurred in the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which produced a White City style of neoclassical, white-clad buildings south of the city. It was a surface event, in that it was literally built that way—as fakery. The overly ornate structures looked like marble to last the ages, but they were for the most part not real buildings at all but mere façades composed of “staff” (plaster and fibrous binding over wood and steel), which burned down weeks after the fair closed (the only remaining structure is now the Museum of Science and Industry). This act of consumptive squander notwithstanding, Chicago’s self-image and boosterism were certainly aided by the event: in their famous Plan of Chicago of 1909, Daniel H. Burnham and Edward H. Bennett referred with pride to the grand “transitory city” of the World’s Fair as a galvanizing motor in city planners’ dreams for designing the new, materially purified Chicago.102 Fittingly, it was this exhibition that first introduced picture postcards (as miniature mirror-surfaces of itself) to the world. For modernist tastes, however, such as Lewis Mumford’s, the Chicago fair was a corrupt veneer, a false “municipal cosmetic” whose “monumental façades” concealed rather than revealed or improved housing conditions for the masses.103 Likewise, after having heaped praise on the glass architecture and the Eiffel Tower born of the French exhibitions, architectural critic Sigfried Giedion dismissed the Columbian Exposition’s plaster architecture as the beginning of the end for the exhibition age.104 This point of view is echoed by Stuart and Elizabeth Ewen, who, in their analysis of modern consumerism, satirize Chicago’s 1893 Venetian mock-up for being a “city that was primarily surface, true to the priorities of the age,” namely modernity’s “logic of consumption.”105 But herein, precisely, lies the importance of the Chicago fair: the American modern ethic of\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 23\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n23\n\ninstant mass production and swift consumption that was so characteristic of the exhibition was played out here as an architectural narrative. Even though the Columbian Exposition’s surface architecture was impossibly ornate—a nostalgic shell with which to line the future-oriented technological items on display within—its strength lay in its performance ethos of great spectacle and proliferation of goods, which encouraged an unapologetic eye for the façade, both architectural and commercial. Indeed, we can only imagine that for visitors at this fair, where almost all the states of the U.S. were represented, the playground of surface architecture facilitated a sense of America as a unified entity, wherein social disjunctions could be temporarily set aside.106 The Chicago fair’s emphasis on colonial prowess notwithstanding,107 the rapturous play-experience effected by Christo’s Reichstag does not, in this sense, seem so very far removed. Yet we should not go so far as to think that because the world exhibition age is dead, we have no more equivalent displays of grand self-consumption on the scale of an entire metropolis. Indeed, more contemporary versions of the White City would include Olympic cities, which are created and unmade in the space of months—a recent example being the rapid makeover of temporary, media-clad architecture at Georgia Tech shortly before the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.108 Then there is Las Vegas, whose “decorated shed” architectural style Robert Venturi suggested in 1972 we learn from: a freely applied sign-city of urban commercial sprawl, rich in symbolic iconography.109 But the new Las Vegas of the millennium, America’s fastest growing city, has become the ultimate exhibition-city for the postmodern age. Las Vegas today, as Ada Louise Huxtable comments, is “the real, real fake at the highest,” where it “has finally all come together: the lunar theatrical landscape of the Strip and the casino hotels, the amusement park and the shopping mall, all themed and prefabricated and available as a packaged vacation for all.”110 A dozen or so of the world’s largest hotels are here, including the largest of all, the MGM Grand, with its 5,005 rooms. Each superhotel is a theme park in itself (the Venetian, the Paris, Treasure Island, Excalibur, New York–New York, or Luxor);111 each is a “mini-city,” a “synthetic play world” in itself.112 In Las Vegas, we may think we are experiencing the urban, but it is always and only the urbanas-simulacrum; and unlike Christo’s events, its deracinated surfaces nonetheless seek the conviction of permanence. If it gives to visitors a sense of American identity, it is a Culture Industry character far in excess of the media-oriented commercialism of either Christo’s art or the Chicago Columbian Exposition. The whole city has been effectively rewrapped to become the top tourist destination in the country, the most unabashed\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 24\n\n24\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nexample of surface-play, of architecture as “gaming” (the postmodern word for gambling).\n\nphilosophies of counterfeit In an important sense, Las Vegas’s latest metamorphosis is to be expected. If we are honest readers of ourselves and of our relation to the world—so the prime philosopher of cultural modernity, Nietzsche, tells us—we should admit that on some basic level we all enjoy surface; for human nature has always wanted a play-state of surface values. Nietzsche’s insight into truth covering up for lies reminds us that we naturally desire to glide over the surface of things and envision forms rather than content. His posthumously published essay “On Truth and Lies in an Extra-Moral Sense” (1904) explains how established language covers up its own metaphoricity, claiming it as metaphysical truth;113 and this mere linguistic sleight of hand, perceives Nietzsche, is what disguises human awareness of illusion and dream-image, like the aesthetic Apollonian shield covering over Dionysian abysmal insight. Indeed for Nietzsche, in his transformatory role as architect of surface values and grand proto-postmodern debunker of the Platonic order of representation, there is greater truth in recognizing the meaninglessness of the origin and the ensuing importance of the tangible, superficial-yet-impenetrable world, than in searching for immaterial origins and metaphysical depth.114 In his notes of 1880, he undermines the Kantian premise of the “thing-in-itself” by suggesting: “If we try to look at the mirror-in-itself, we discover nothing but things. If we want to grasp things, then we end up arriving at nothing but the mirror again.”115 All we have is our ability to “scan” relations; we cannot reproduce the world mimetically.116 Underlying the philosopher’s pursuit of truth, asserts Nietzsche, there is an instinct even more basic to all life and pleasure: namely the Will to Power, which asserts itself through what may also be termed a Will to Surface. At the heart of all things, Nietzsche finds affective forces eternally and agonistically inclined toward supremacy and play, toward destructiveness and creation, toward illusionary nonknowledge and forgetting. Those who know what true “depth” is, he suggests in The Gay Science (1882), prefer to exist on the surface, “like flying fish, playing on the peaks of the waves”: they possess a certain “skin-coveredness” (Hautlichkeit).117 Such a focus on Hautlichkeit is also a trademark of the urban culture of the Weimar Republic’s stabilization years. For the purposes of this study, we can infer that Nietzsche’s high praise, in his 1887 preface to The Gay\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 25\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n25\n\nScience, for the ancient Greeks’ surface culture is indeed transferable onto Weimar Berliners: “Oh, those Greeks! They knew how to live. What is required for that is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance. Those Greeks were superficial—out of profundity.”118 But something has ineluctably changed since the Greeks, and even since the Weimar Berliners: the twentieth century’s creation of mass culture, particularly the cult of consumerism in an urban environment, has overtaken Nietzsche’s perception, and has made our all-too-human predilection for display into an absolutely unavoidable optical value system. The way power is nowadays unremittingly located within the realm of commodity display would not have pleased Nietzsche, if his criticism of the Wagner cult is anything to go by. This composer, argues Nietzsche in The Case of Wagner (1888), instigated the “rise of the actor” into music, a new decadent age in which the “whole no longer exists: it is put together, planned, artificial, an artefact.”119 With respect to modern mass consumerism, the “art of appearance,” Nietzsche offers in Human, All Too Human (1878) an aristocratic-Luddite critique of mass taste and of the mechanization of production: “All that impresses the eye and is inexpensive will now gain the upper hand.”120 The unintended great irony of Nietzsche is that he is both a herald of the surface-era of modernity in the realms of philosophy and morality (and of its subsequent technocultures in the postmodern age)121 and a Zarathustran naysayer of the leveling (for him socialistic, democratic), mass consumer manifestations of precisely this transvaluation of values. Indeed, he abhors modern urban society for being so surface-oriented, for the way it “outwardly demands mannerliness and the newest fashions, and inwardly insists on rushed understanding and exploitation of the ephemeral, even the momentary—and nothing besides!”122 The transitoriness of modernity can of course be approached with less conservative resistance than Nietzsche. But for Nietzsche’s aristocratic radicalism, modernity in the material sense of the word signifies the age of the democratized Last Man, the era of the merely journalistic: “the three M’s—of the moment, opinions, and fashion” (des Moments, der Meinungen und der Moden).123 Nietzsche’s fin-de-siècle vision of the downside to surface culture came entirely too late to alter the path of urbanization and its effect on the psyche.124 Other voices acknowledged the ineluctability of this process. In a Baudelairean vein, Simmel recognized the importance not of dismissing but of delineating the tiniest or most superficial instances of modernity’s new “concrete” culture in all its material but short-lived manifestations\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 26\n\n26\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nand permutations.125 In his 1903 essay “The Metropolis and Mental Life” (“Die Großstadt und das Geistesleben”), Simmel posits that an “atrophy” of what is surely Nietzsche’s highest tenet, namely “individual culture,” is the unavoidable consequence of modern massification.126 Urban surface culture encourages social independence but not private creativity. The new metropolitan dweller, states Simmel, cultivates a “blasé attitude” of rational superficiality and indifference in order to survive the onslaught of perceptual and psychological stimuli brought on by “each crossing of the street, . . . [by] the tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational, and social life.”127 The emergence of surface-attitudes among city-dwellers is thus a Darwinian strategy for adapting to life in the industrial age; as far as the actual consequences of the shocks of urbanization for those who fail to successfully adapt, Simmel prefers to sit on the intellectual fence. Simmel’s vision of modernity and its effects upon the individual is decidedly based on the money economy. In his essay on the 1896 Berlin trade exhibition, for example, Simmel notes the ambiguous parallel between the exhibited objects of world trade fairs and the metropolitan individual: in the environment of competitive display, there exists a riskbenefit situation of (self-)depreciation versus (self-)accentuation. The very multiplicity involved in the “stimulus of appearance” offers the metropolitan type, like the value of the items on display, both the very real danger of “levelling and uniformity” (as Nietzsche recognized) as well as the tempting high of further self-aggrandizement.128 Simmel, sharing Karl Marx’s insights if not his transformatory zeal, perceives that the capitalist circulation of money “with all its colorlessness and indifference” is the unstoppable wheel or perpetuum mobile129 of the economy, forever turning these transformations of the collective urban psyche and all ensuing visual expressions of surface culture; for money alone “hollows out the core of things, their individuality, their specific value, and their incomparability.”130 Most significantly, Simmel bases his analysis of the money economy not on Marxist production value but on exchange (i.e., exhibited, sign) value, and the effect that exchange value as driving force has on people.131 Marx’s insight into the modern human condition as one of alienation before the magical autonomy of commodities is thus transformed by Simmel into an oscillating ride with both reifying and liberating experiences—at least for those who are permitted to participate.132 This view of continuous circulation is reiterated as an ideal articulation in urban planning during the Weimar years: improving the flow of money becomes synonymous with improving the flow of traffic.

Hindenburg Platz, Stuttgart (1930).\n\nHans Scharoun’s unrealized design of 1925 for the Berlin exhibition area (fig. 4), the streamlining of building façades and street directionality alike is seen, in true Simmelesque fashion, as a facilitator of traffic flow and as a marker of street-smart efficiency for the urban denizen. A second respondent to Nietzsche’s concerns about modernity is Benjamin, whose unfinished magnum opus, The Arcades Project (Das PassagenWerk, 1927–1940), likewise enters into the consequences and effects of surface exteriority in modern urban culture from the perspective of an unabashed metropolitan participant who was raised in turn-of-thecentury Berlin, attended Simmel’s lectures, and lived through the German 1920s. The Arcades Project effectively gives us the prehistory of Weimar modernity with a vast collection of archival notes on the rise of the fetishistic nature of commodities (and hence the origins of surface culture) in Second Empire Paris. From his enforced exile in Paris from Nazi Germany during the 1930s, Benjamin writes about this city as the implicit forerunner of the Weimar metropolis, while at the same time sketching a de facto epitaph of the latter, for the experimental atmosphere of Weimar urban surface culture had by then been thoroughly condemned by the\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 28\n\n28\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 4.

By calling forth the materiality of this system of commodified display in the act of writing, Benjamin finds he can create an historical picture of “dialectics at a standstill,” in which “that which has been comes together like lightning into a constellation with the now.”133 By far the most important dialectical pictures in Benjamin’s key work on the consumerist mentality of industrial modernity are the Parisian galeries or passages,134 the panoramas of shopping desire that appeared after 1800 in response to the growth of the textile industry and immediately predated the era of grand department stores. Drawing heavily from Giedion’s Building in France: Building in Iron, Building in Concrete (Bauen in Frankreich: Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton, 1928)—whose smoothsurfaced typography was the work of Bauhaus photographer László Moholy-Nagy—Benjamin states that “construction plays the role of the subconscious”135 and is not merely a consequence of the ratio; in this way, Benjamin views the Parisian arcade-constructions as allegorical “dreams around the scaffolding of these body processes.” He is alert to the lightgiving function of the arcades’ glass-covered roofs, and their role as the true predecessors of the contemporary Weimar urban pedestrian expe-\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 29\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n29\n\nrience in that they were “both house and street” for the flâneur—who, as the perambulating spectator of urban life, became therein both within and without, private and public, seller and commodity, in the manner of the prostitute.136 For as long as the flâneur could stroll in the arcades, the “traffic” of commodification was disrupted and disruptable.137 The Parisian arcades are metropolitan modernity’s first site of “dream houses of the collective”; they preempt the late nineteenth century’s rise of the department store in that they are “houses or walkways that have no outside [keine Außenseite]—like the dream.”138 Through the wandering vision of the flâneur or the camera-eye, Benjamin’s Paris most clearly resembles a Gesamtkunstwerk—not a Wagnerian one, but a deconstructed “total artwork” that highlights, rather than veils over, its origins of production and processes of technique. Benjamin muses that the Parisian city map could be rendered into a “passionate film” that could portray, in half an hour, the transformation through the centuries of this labyrinthine network or “concentration” of streets, arcades, métro, and boulevards.139 Note that the Benjaminian city enters the realm of the “total work of art” by the back door, and creates a different kind of vision of the same: the ultimate Parisian monument, the Eiffel Tower, is defined by Benjamin as adhering to the “yardstick of the ‘smallest,’” that is, to the genus loci of the arcades’ own construction motif of iron-andglass montage.140 Both Eiffel Tower and arcades accentuate the modern city as “trace” (Spur).141 That is to say, Benjamin knows how a modern city’s surface traces are montage-Babels and can organically deflate any monumentalism being imposed upon them. The Eiffel Tower is the epitome of this double discourse: built as a display item for the Paris Exhibition of 1889, its twelve thousand metal components are held together by the “principle of montage.” Benjamin thus approves of this implicit presence of the labyrinth within the monument. The collective yet cacophonic vision that The Arcades Project reconstructs, with its surrealism-inspired tableaux of infinite reflections and distortions, is Benjamin’s acknowledgment that what modernity really signifies is at odds with Max Weber’s dictate regarding industrialization. Weber assessed modernity thus: The increasing intellectualization and rationalization does not . . . signify an increasing general knowledge of the conditions of life under which one exists. Rather it means for us something different: knowledge thereof or belief therein: that one, if one only wanted to, could find the answer at any time, that there are therefore basically no secret incalculable forces that play a role here, that on the contrary one can in\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 30\n\n30\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nprinciple control all things through calculation. But this means: the disenchantment of the world.142\n\nThe tale of modernity’s reenchantment charted by Benjamin’s montageepic asserts the other, less often shown side of the Weberian coin, which normally reflects the stamp of modernity’s “disenchantment of the world” (Entzauberung der Welt) as the high price to pay for the rationalization of all spheres. Hence the collective unconscious of the modern industrial age was to be found in the apparently functionalist realm of glass transparency that consistently exteriorized the interior. As Buck-Morss states: “On an unconscious ‘dream’ level, the new urban-industrial world had become fully reenchanted. In the modern city, as in the ur-forests of another era, the ‘threatening and alluring face’ of myth was alive and everywhere.”143 This new mythic dream-state of surface culture, particularly in Benjamin’s own Weimar era, constituted at first impression an antimyth, for it was obsessed with reproducing an anti-auratic, antiornamental, efficient functionality in the name of capitalist profit margins. Nonetheless, Benjamin finds its displacement effect entirely mythologizing; for, rather than serve the masses on the path toward critical self-understanding of their roles in the capitalist production-and-display process, all the surface dream does is support them (and now us) narcotically in a delusionary condition of isolating conformity and unfulfillable desire. Against this Benjamin posits a neo-Enlightenment reading of his Arcades Project, which was to have provided a stimulus to social change and greater autonomy for the reader-consumer.144 While this dream was being continued in modernized, “objectified” format in the Weimar era, it is by extension still being dreamed today, albeit in the electronic media’s far more intrusive acts of simulation. This, indeed, is why we should care about the Benjaminian desire for epiphany, for a wake-up call from our continued virtual slumbering. Yet if Benjamin is open to the active participation of the consumer, his openness remains contingent on various transformations required for the new dream-world of commodity fetishism. What Benjamin is seeking and what he demonstrates in his own texts is not a retrogressive ornamental style, but instead a surface-orientation that is less rigid and will permit a (Nietzschean, or proto-postmodern) play between the traces of surfaces. In One-Way Street (1926)—his first exploration of material, local, street culture—he suggests an almost Gnostic vision of the modern world’s fallen state of disintegration, noting how the best hermeneuts, namely children, are (like dada-artists) fascinated by “detritus” (Abfall) of all kinds, by “any\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 31\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n31\n\nsite where things are being visibly worked on,” where there is building, gardening, housework, et cetera going on: their imaginary games with discarded materials permit them to redeem a new microcosmic “world of things” (Dingwelt) within the larger world.145 If, then, we could create with commodities (the ultimate surface-items for grown-ups) in the same way that children create a “new, intuitive relationship” within the materials and debris they play with, then we would be responding to modernity as Benjamin would have us do.146 Michel de Certeau echoes Benjamin’s sentiment when he writes: “The child still scrawls and daubs on his schoolbooks; even if he is punished for this crime, he has made a space for himself and signs his existence as an author on it.”147 This sort of creative, subversive act from within is, moreover, not so dissimilar from the resistance of the colonized vis-à-vis the colonizer described by Edward Said.148 But despite this visionary claim, even Benjamin senses that for Weimar Germans, particularly after the inflation crisis of 1923, any sense of Geist has been eradicated from the “brazen solidity” (schamlose Massivität) in the display of luxury goods— the strength of which is so complete that “all the mind’s shafts break harmlessly on their surface.”149 His underlying unease with his contemporary consumer culture (and, moreover, with the ensuing Nazi adaptation of the same) is perhaps most apparent in his preference, as an exiled writer during the 1930s, for ensconcing himself primarily not in the present crisis of fascist Europe but in a genealogical re-creation of the (by then already buried) social imaginary of nineteenth-century Paris. Benjamin’s prophecy, his belief in the power of texts to create a new collective subjectivity among readers, one that might awaken them from their repressed state of alienation hidden within the dream factory of urban surface culture, is shared (albeit in a less visionary, less revolutionary way) by Siegfried Kracauer, fellow Weimar discussant and former student of Simmel. Kracauer’s attention to German modernity’s cult of surface is particularly conscientious and astute, due in no small part to the fact that his first profession (until 1919) was as an architect.150 Although Kracauer left behind his rather uninspiring experience with late Wilhelmine architecture— to become, during the Weimar years, a novelist, journalist, literary and film critic, newspaper editor, and social theorist, often all at once—the “primacy of the optical that architecture requires,” as Adorno relates, “remained with him in sublimated form.”151 Even more than Benjamin, Kracauer finds greater social reality in deciphering the “hieroglyphics of any spatial picture” in his vicinity than in more distant metaphysical constructs.152 Unlike Benjamin, however, he finds in surface culture not so much a new\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 32\n\n32\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\ndream-world emerging out of Weberian rationality, but an intensification and multiplication of rationalized work-scenes operating even within that dream. Kracauer’s critiques of social phenomena, particularly those of the Weimar metropolis, remain indebted to Simmel as a master theorist of surface. Through analyzing the material world around him with its “distorted conceptual petrifications,” Kracauer hopes, in a Simmelesque gesture, to ascend above a recognition of the alienated modern condition to an “aware[ness] of the many-sidedness of things” and an ability to interpret “relations between phenomena.”153 But this surface-dance does not quell a desire to penetrate to what lies beneath the upper (Ober-) part of surface (Fläche). In his 1920–1921 essay on Simmel, for example, Kracauer praises an archaeological-cum-Maeterlinckian approach of defamiliarization that “advances from the surface of things to their spiritual/intellectual substrata” in order to demonstrate that “this surface is symbolic in character”: “All dullness and shabbiness disappear from the world’s external surface, as if it had suddenly become as transparent as glass, enabling one to look in and through it into otherwise hidden layers of being which it reveals and simultaneously covers up.”154 Note that Kracauer retains here, in the cause of sociopolitical awareness-raising or exiting from the dream of commodity fetishism, a firmly Platonic belief in the conceptual depth that still remains beneath the fog of material Oberfläche. The opening statement of Kracauer’s landmark essay on Weimar mass culture, “The Mass Ornament” (“Das Ornament der Masse,” 1927), resonates as the author’s plaidoyer for a social history version of a critical hermeneutics of psychological “deep surface.”155 Kracauer declares that what appear to be superficial phenomena in his and indeed any historical era function in fact as nonsupervenient manifestations of the collective unconscious: The position that an epoch occupies in the historical process can be determined more strikingly from an analysis of its inconspicuous surface-level expressions [Oberflächenäußerungen] than from that epoch’s judgments about itself. Since these judgments are expressions of the tendencies of a particular era, they do not offer conclusive testimony about its overall constitution. The surface-level expressions, however, by virtue of their unconscious nature, provide unmediated access to the fundamental substance of the state of things. Conversely, knowledge of this state of things depends on the interpretation of these surface-level expressions. The fundamental substance of an epoch and its unheeded impulses illuminate each other reciprocally.156\n\nWard_intro 1/8/01 2:43 PM Page 33\n\nIntroduction\n\n/\n\n33\n\nThus the task of the anthropologist of material culture is to explain these structures of surface signification. Kracauer reminds us transversely of Claude Lévi-Strauss’s geological metaphor of cultural analysis as an enterprise of digging up the surface to reveal both synchronic and diachronic patterns.157 Michel Foucault updates this proposition in The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969): archaeological (genealogical) exploration seeks not origins but an analysis of the “already-said,” of the “discursive formation, and the general archive system to which it belongs.”158 Foucault’s essay “The Discourse of Language” extends this plaidoyer for surface: referring to his method of “exteriority” or “materiality” in reading historical discourse, he insists that “we should look for its external conditions of existence, for that which gives rise to the chance series of these events and fixes its limits.”159 During his 1921–1933 tenure at the Frankfurter Zeitung (for which he wrote nearly two thousand articles),160 Kracauer repeatedly selected topics that allowed him to excavate the discursive potential provided by the material, exterior phenomena of Weimar culture. As the 1920s progressed, however, and increasingly after his absorption of Marxist theory in 1925, Kracauer displays a more resigned acceptance of the opacity of surface.161 Writing in 1930, for example, about the demise of Berlin’s nineteenthcentury arcades, he asks somewhat helplessly: “What good is an arcade in a society that itself is only an arcade?”162 While the method of inquiry exactly matches the object of inquiry in the Kracauerian universe of Weimar Berlin, the author himself is far from an easygoing observer of what he sees and measures.
