        "text": "Old detective series never die. They return as TV movies. We've seen this phenomenon happen with \"Columbo,\" \"Murder She Wrote\" and \"The Rockford Files,\" and tonight with \"Diagnosis Murder Town Without Pity\" (9 p.m., CBS, TV-PG, L). Sometimes these revivals remind us what we missed about old favorites. But not tonight.\n\nNo one ever accused \"Diagnosis Murder\" of being great or innovative television. But at its best, it could be fun. Star Dick Van Dyke and producer Fred Silverman used the series to lampoon some of the medium's excesses and gimmicks. Van Dyke's Dr. Mark Sloan solved mysteries involving network sweeps, masked magicians, game shows and the death of a chatty talk-show host.\n\nBut don't go looking for whimsy in \"Town Without Pity.\" The drama begins when Sloan's daughter Carol (Van Dyke's real daughter, Stacy Van Dyke) and her new husband have car problems on their way to a birthday party for Steve (Barry Van Dyke). They become victims of foul play just moments after checking into a quaint bed-and-breakfast. Mark receives a desperate call from Carol that ends with an abrupt crash.\n\nAfter arriving in the dusty mountain town of Los Rios to investigate Carol's disappearance, Mark meets resistance and strange behavior from the locals. Everybody appears to have something dreadful to hide. \"Town\" owes much of its plot and spirit to the 1955 Spencer Tracy drama \"Bad Day at Black Rock,\" about a stranger uncovering a town's complicity in a racist murder. This TV film also revives some musty stereotypes about small-town behavior.\n\nAt an hour, \"Town\" would seem padded, but its two-hour length verges on interminable. Heavy drama was never Dick Van Dyke's forte, and his son Barry is completely out of his depth.\n\nPBS won't let us forget about the Queen's Jubilee. Elizabeth II became queen 50 years ago today. She had just embarked on a goodwill tour to Africa when news of her father's death reached her in Kenya on Feb. 6, 1952. These and other facts emerge on \"The Queen's Story\" (8 p.m., TV-G, check local listings). More than 30 friends, colleagues and international figures comment on her sheltered private life and graceful public demeanor.\n\nExperts contend that the queen's class act is the only thing that has saved Britain's monarchy from its wretched reputation. Some argue that Elizabeth II should be Elizabeth the last and that the 1,000-year-old institution should be buried with her.\n\nTurner Classic Movies dedicates every Wednesday in February to films showcasing performances by black musicians. Catch Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong in \"New Orleans\" (8 p.m.), and Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, Armstrong, Ethel Waters and Eddie Anderson in \"Cabin in the Sky\" (10 p.m.).OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\n\nScheduled on \"60 Minutes II\" (8 p.m., CBS) Post-traumatic \"survivor guilt\" in New York; inside Afghanistan with U.S. Special Forces.\n\nScheduled on \"20/20 Downtown\" (10 p.m., ABC) A profile of the Olsen twins; an interview with Bebe Buell, mother of Liz Tyler; racial profiling; parents search for their missing daughter.\n\nArchitects and designers discuss flaws that may have contributed to the Sept. 11 tragedy on \"World Trade Center Anatomy of a Collapse\" (10 p.m., TLC).LATE NIGHT\n\nScheduled guests Chris Matthews and Alan Jackson on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" (1135 p.m., CBS) ...
