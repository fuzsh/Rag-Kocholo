They were great songs -- If I Didn't Have Dime, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, the terrifically exotic Mecca and True Love Never Runs Smooth . . . but to know the Stones were hanging out with him?\n\nKinda tarnished their low reputation.\n\nEven when radio was tossing out great singles with almost casual indifference, Pitney's songs stood out: he had a distinctively sharp voice and was clearly possessed of great vocal power too (check Mecca), and I remember one night a DJ mentioning Pitney had also written He's a Rebel for the Crystal (I had thought Phil Spector did that) and Hello Mary Lou for Ricky Nelson (again, I assumed Ricky or the Everly Brothers had penned it).\n\nAfter that I listened more carefully to Pitney, and was rewarded with I'm Gonna Be Strong and the very camp Backstage. And then later discovered his breakthrough single Town Without Pity on a compilation album.\n\nI loved the way his voice cracked, how the song soared, the slightly sleazy drama of the horns which suggested some cheap cop show on TV . . . and a friend told me it was about \"being a queer and living in a small town\".\n\nThat thought hadn't occurred to my 14-year old brain, but added an allure to it also.\n\nMaybe it was, I didn't know. Could have been, so I imagined Gene and Eden Kane as secret lovers and Eden singing Boys Cry (\"when no one can see them\") as they met in a cheap motel.\n\nSort of Rock Dreams before it was thought up.\n\nAnyway, Gene was married with kids -- although he did get together with Marc Almond later for another version of Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart so . . .\n\nAside from one-hit wonders, few artists start and close their career with the same song -- but that's what happened with Gene. Town Without Pity was his breakthrough single, and it was also the last song he ever performed -- 45 years later.\n\nShortly after finishing it he left the stage in Wales to a standing ovation, went back to his hotel on a high and later his manager found him dead of a heart attack in his room.\n\nOddly enough in all those years I listened to this I never once thought Cardiff would be that town without pity."
