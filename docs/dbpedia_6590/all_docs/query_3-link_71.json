        "text": "Question: I recently got into a dispute with a Baltimore Sun TV columnist over whether Gene Pitney's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is heard in the movie of the same name; I said it wasn't.\n\nI contacted Gene Pitney via the Internet, and he set the record straight. I think his response also would be of interest to your readers:\n\nThe song The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was written for the movie but for some strange reason never was put in the sound track. Because of (my) prior success with Town Without Pity, I was paid a bundle to record the song (Liberty Valance). Burt Bacharach wrote the song with Hal David, and Burt produced it. There was some screw up between the publishing company, Famous Music, and the parent company, Paramount Pictures, about why it never was in the film.\n\nThe most bizarre part of the story I only found out a few years ago. The music used in the film was from a 1939 Henry Fonda film called Young Mister Lincoln. Go figure that out!\n\nRegards, Gene Pitney _Ron E. Hontz, Shrewsbury, Pa.\n\nDear Ron: Since determining whether the tune appears in the film is merely a matter of renting or buying the video of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, I am surprised the Sun columnist challenged your claim.\n\nRegardless, it is great to hear from the man himself _ marvelous Mr. Pitney _ on this interesting topic. Now, while we're in a movie music mood . . .\n\nQuestion: At one point in the film The Accidental Tourist, actress Geena Davis sings a song about Santa Claus. Though not known for her singing, she does a decent job on this cute tune.\n\nI don't know the title, but I am hoping you can research this catchy song for me. Was it written especially for the movie or was it once a hit by another singer? Could it be that it's on CD by someone? _ Victoria Lawson, W. Paducah, Ky.\n\nDear Victoria: No and Yes. Titled I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus, the song first came out in 1956, by Little Brenda Lee (Decca 88215).\n\nBecause this is not one of Brenda Lee's big hits, having it turn up in a film 32 years later is a surprise. Geena's live film version _ not lip synched _ is nearly identical in style to Brenda's recording.\n\nYou can easily obtain I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus on CD. Look for Hillbilly Holiday (Rhino 70195), which, though probably not in stores until Christmas stock comes out, can be special ordered at any time.\n\nQuestion: In the '60s, Ike & Tina Turner were backed by a vocal group called the Ikettes. I would like to know their names. _ Tom Edmond, Oak Park, Ill.\n\nDear Tom: The Ikettes, once a crucial ingredient in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, were Delores Johnson, Eloise Hester and Joshie Jo Armstead.\n\nIZ ZAT SO? Remember the 1968 hit, In the Midnight Hour, by the Mirettes (Revue 11004)? Well, the Mirettes were essentially the Ikettes after a personnel shake-up.\n\n1996 World Features Syndicate, Inc."
