        "text": "Another season six episode and another post inspired by an On-This-Day from earlier this year. No sibling involvement in this one, but continuing to keep the family connection as Henry gives some advice.\n\nFrank and Danny work together to help Nick Constantine (Michael Nouri), a rehabilitated ex-con who Frank put away years ago, when Constantine becomes involved in the murder of an old enemy. Also, as Erin prepares for a murder trial, she learns the prosecutor who previously handled the case is withholding the location of the alleged killer so she can interview him on her popular podcast, on BLUE BLOODS.\n\nParamount Press Express\n\nInitial Thoughts\n\nThese are my thoughts on the eighteenth episode of season six. Much of it is my interpretation of what is not said and may exist purely in my imagination. If you agree or disagree, please let me know, as I’d still love to hear from you regardless. I just ask that you’re polite. It’d be great to debate ideas and see what thought-provoking theories emerge.\n\nIt’s an unusual story: the situation Jamie and Eddie uncover could never be predicted from the opening scene. There’s a bit of humour, a mystery (especially as the storyline wasn’t mentioned in the synopsis), and displays of compassion. One of the most fascinating aspects is how it addresses what the objects left behind reveal about a person’s life and character. It also effectively tells an entire story within a single location.\n\nScene by Scene Breakdown\n\nIf you want to remind yourself of any of the scenes, click on the headings for a link to the relevant clips on YouTube.\n\nAn Alarming Arrival\n\nSuch a simple opening; Jamie and Eddie respond to a nuisance car alarm. Although we don’t see it again after this scene, Harry’s vehicle provides an early indication of what we later learn. Jamie states that it’s an older model, the paintwork has clearly seen better days, and it appears to be jammed full of junk. Plus, the landlady quickly suggests that Harry can afford to replace it.\n\nThe landlady is such a character; she makes an impact during this short appearance as we learn about what kind of life she lived in her youth. Plus, she flirts with Jamie (Eddie turns around to look at her as soon as she greets Jamie with “Hey, handsome”). Although still flirting after they find Harry is not exactly enticing.\n\nMystery Money\n\nEven though there aren’t any expositionary statements, we’re given the impression that barely any time has passed since the previous scene. Jamie and Eddie are still the only officials with Harry, so no one else has arrived to remove the body. That sense of immediacy suggests the bag of money was as easy to find as the note; what does it mean to have that much cash lying around?\n\nNewspaper Clippings\n\nEven though we remain at Harry’s apartment, we’re still given clues about how much time has passed; Eddie and Jamie’s conversation informs us they’re at the start of a new tour, and the supervisors had visited the previous day. They also explain why they’re still having to stay at the apartment. Their chatter includes observations about how Harry lived and what he must have felt – that he was hiding from the world for 25 years.\n\nThen Eddie finds the bundle of newspaper clippings about a bank robbery 25 years ago. Jamie stating how long Harry had lived this way, plus the cash they’d discovered, reinforces the idea that the two events are connected.\n\nWhat’s Going On?\n\nThey may have been assigned to do little more than babysit the apartment and its contents, but that doesn’t mean they’re happy to sit around and do nothing, so it isn’t a surprise that Eddie finds more money. I know I’ve commented on some of Eddie’s recent storylines that there doesn’t always seem to be a justification for why a patrol officer spends so long on a case; here, we’re given another reason for why Jamie and Eddie are hanging around the apartment.\n\nSpending so much time in the apartment leads to self-reflection; what does someone’s home say about them? It leads to Eddie sharing her guilty pleasure DVD; does Jamie seem more disgusted that it’s revealed to be a Disney movie than when it’s just an unspecified DVD? However, the situation is so unusual that Eddie begins wondering whether it’s a test for them; would they be tempted to steal?\n\nSandi’s Story\n\nThis story definitely isn’t flattering of the banks, managing to include the corporate practice of avoiding payouts and the banking crisis of 2008. This isn’t about making Harry’s actions seem virtuous – like he was some modern-day Robin Hood; it just emphasises that he was driven by guilt. However, it provides some justification for Jamie’s choices when Sandi suggests he’s got a judgement to make.\n\nThis is when the story’s focus changes slightly, presenting a challenge for Jamie alone. In the background, Eddie is playing a computer game with the grandson.\n\nHenry’s Advice\n\nOne of Jamie’s hypothetical questions which is obviously not hypothetical. It’s a scene that re-emphasises why Jamie and Eddie don’t have to pass the evidence to another team; it justifies Jamie’s decision. Henry reiterates that it’s a judgment call for Jamie; by sharing one of his anecdotes, he demonstrates his sensibilities align with Jamie’s in this situation. The conversation with Henry doesn’t change Jamie’s intentions; it’s just a way for Jamie to receive validation from someone with more experience.\n\nI know it’s one of my minor obsessions, but Jamie brings brisket for family dinner!! Of course, it’s just an excuse to discuss his problem with Henry.\n\nDoing Their Job – Deleted Scene\n\nThis is my best guess for where the deleted scene would fit within the episode; if this had been included in the episode’s final version, it would have made Jamie’s decision to withhold the money more overt and against the proper procedure. It would also increase Eddie’s opposition to Jamie’s final decision and make their final scene feel inadequate as a resolution.\n\nDoing What’s Right\n\nIt’s easy to tell what decision Jamie made based on his heavy hints to Sandi about where to look in the apartment. Importantly, it’s stated that the public administrator has already assessed the contents, so Jamie and Eddie haven’t actively done anything to hide any of the money; it’s just that the other team’s search wasn’t thorough.\n\nConsidering this is the conclusion to the story, it’s interesting that Jamie and Eddie have different opinions regarding leaving Sandy to take any remaining cash; this is solely Jamie’s decision. They settle on agreeing that it will be Eddie’s choice regarding how she deals with anyone who asks questions, making this a very restrained debate during a season when they would often challenge each other to request a new partner. It’s also an interesting dynamic, considering Eddie’s apparent shock at Jamie’s actions in Careful What You Wish For. Jamie will bend the rules to help people who need it. In both cases, Jamie assists families harmed by the criminal act that was the source of the cash.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis story is as much about revealing something of Jamie’s character as unravelling Harry’s mystery. Jamie’s need to attend Harry’s funeral is understandable, especially after so much time in his apartment. The story successfully creates the sense that Harry was a man haunted by his past.\n\nJamie and Eddie don’t agree about how Jamie handles Sandi’s issues, but this isn’t a conflict-based story. Eddie voicing her concern at the end of their final scene feels like an odd writing choice. As previously mentioned, during a season where there were so many occasions that they both suggested getting a different partner, in the final version it seems like someone remembered at the last moment that they were supposed to disagree even though it didn’t fit the story. Eddie doesn’t seem particularly concerned about the idea someone might ask questions later; she even smiles when Jamie suggests she could report him, which suggests she can’t imagine not having his back. That related smile works in the final version, but I don’t think there would have been enough to justify it if the deleted scene had been included."
