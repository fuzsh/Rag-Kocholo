        "text": "Gene Pitney had a huge hit with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Recently I rented the movie of the same name. As the film began, I expected to hear that eerie, familiar violin opening that begins the song. Much to my surprise, his song did not play then, nor any time during the film. How can this be? The lyrics obviously tell the same story as the movie, so why would they not use it? Was it in the theatrical film but omitted from the video?\n\nI knew that somewhere in my archives would be a note from Gene Pitney about this very topic. Luckily, I found it.\n\nGene confirms the exclusion of the theme from the original film, though even he does not know what prompted that decision. He says: \"Because of my prior success with Town Without Pity, I was paid a bundle to record the The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Burt Bacharach wrote the song with Hal David, and Burt produced it. Though The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was written for the movie, for some strange reason it was never used in the soundtrack.\n\n\"There was some screwup between the Publishing company, Famous Music and the Parent company, Paramount Pictures, and probably that's why it never was in the actual film.\n\n\"I only found out a few years ago what is the most bizarre part of the story. The actual music used in the film is from a 1939 Henry Fonda film called Young Mister Lincoln. Go figure that out! _ Regards, Gene Pitney\"\n\nSince any Gene Pitney hits collection probably includes The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, you can remedy the situation, and set the mood for a shootout, by simply playing the song while you're viewing the film.\n\nBefore Randy was Travis\n\nWhen I bought the first Randy Travis LP, On the Other Hand, I learned he had been making records for many years before finally getting his first hit. Can you supply details of his earlier records?\n\nThis won't take long, as there are only three. The first two are singles and both credit Randy Traywick, which is Randy's real name. Around May 1978, Paula Records issued I'll Take Any Willing Woman, backed with Dreamin' (No. 429). Traywick's debut single didn't attract much attention, but his December '78 followup She's My Woman (Paula 431) made the national charts. I know you refer to On the Other Hand as his first hit, but I think of a record that holds any position on the national charts as a hit. Thus, Randy's first hit is really She's My Woman. In November 1982, while using the stage name Randy Ray, his debut LP came out: Randy Ray Live at the Nashville Palace (Music Valley Records 1215).\n\nIz zat so?\n\nTraywick's first LP, Randy Ray Live at the Nashville Palace, is rarely offered for sale, but when one is on the auction block, the bidding usually ends around $400. If just hearing this live recording will do, and you can live without the pricey vinyl, a CD reissue is easily available for about $10.\n\nJerry Osborne answers as many questions as possible through this column.
