I also contacted via e-mail, telephone, or in person as many relatives or close friends of the deceased directors as possible. Of these I must give special thanks to Fritz Lang’s close friends Cornelius Schnauber and Kevin Thomas; Robert Siodmak’s nephew Geoff Siodmak; Billy Wilder’s wife, Audrey Wilder, and daughter Victoria Roberts; Willy Wilder’s son Miles Wilder, Miles’s wife, Bobbe Wilder, and their daughter Kim Wilder-Lee; Edgar G. Ulmer’s daughter Arianné Ulmer Cipes; Curtis Bernhardt’s son Tony Bernhardt; John Brahm’s daughter Sumishta Brahm; and Henry Koster’s son Bob Koster. Fellow scholars who contributed information, counsel, or constructive feedback include Marc Dolezal, Thomas Elsaesser, Lester Friedman, Jan-Christopher Horak, Klaus Kreimeier, and Michael Meyer. The excellent editors at Rutgers University Press, Leslie Mitchner and Marilyn Campbell presiding, did their yeoman’s duty, as usual. And access to some of the rarer ﬁlms, which were legion, came courtesy of the treasure troves at Eddie Brandt’s Saturday Matinee video store, Video Journeys, Danger and Despair, and the UCLA Film and Television Archives. The greatest godsend was my dear wife, love of my life, and research assistant extraordinaire, Karen Brook, without whose guidance, inspiration, and abiding love this book would never have seen the dark of night, much less the light of day.\n\nix\n\nDRIVEN TO DARKNESS\n\n1\n\nIntroduction I am a German writer. My heart beats Jewish. It’s my thoughts that belong to the world. —Lion Feuchtwanger\n\n“History,” said George Santayana, “is always written wrong, and so always needs to be rewritten.”1 This study of Jewish émigré ﬁlmmakers of the 1930s and 1940s aims to rewrite a wrong in the historiography of American cinema generally and ﬁlm noir speciﬁcally. The error is one of omission, and relates to the crucial contributions of Jewish, German-speaking, refugee directors to the emergence and evolution of ﬁlm noir. Not that these directors’ importance to the noir cycle per se has been neglected; quite the contrary. The disproportionate number and seminal inﬂuence of Austrian and German ﬁlm noir directors—Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, Otto Preminger, Edgar G. Ulmer, and Fred Zinnemann among the Austrians; Robert Siodmak, Curtis Bernhardt, Max Ophuls, and John Brahm among the Germans—has been duly acknowledged in regard to their refugee status, the infusion of expressionist aesthetics into the cycle, and the canonical status of many of their ﬁlms. But the signiﬁcance of these individual’s Jewishness, and the impact of their ethno-religious identiﬁcation on their work, has remained almost wholly unexplored. Occasionally, a noir scholar will allude to the repercussions of exile in a manner that hints at its Jewish inﬂection, such as Tom Gunning on Fritz Lang (“The insecurity of the refugee status shapes his new mode of ﬁlmmaking”), James Paris on Billy Wilder (“Perhaps it took a European who had lost an entire world to see life with such a bittersweet sense of irony”), or Foster Hirsch on the expatriates in general (“They . . . shared a world view that was shaped by their bitter personal experience of living and then escaping from a nation that had lost its mind”).2 But even Susan M. White and Neil Sinyard, who actually name their subjects’ Jewishness and consider it as a component (among others) in their ﬁlms, still apply it (and rather cursorily) only to a single ﬁlmmaker—Max Ophuls for White, Fred Zinnemann for Sinyard—and only to their body of work as a whole. No writer that I’m aware of has collectively analyzed the import of the émigré directors’ Jewishness, or done so speciﬁcally in regard to their ﬁlm noir output.3 The consequences of this oversight are not merely related to identity politics. Certainly the accomplishments of émigré Jewish ﬁlm noir directors deserve to be recognized from an ethno-religious standpoint as much as from a national 1\n\n2\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\none, all the more so given the fraught historical circumstances, both nationally and internationally, under which ﬁlm noir emerged. My concern, however, goes beyond settling the multicultural score. In eliding the Jewishness of a substantial portion of noir ﬁlmmakers, an important piece of the ﬁlm noir puzzle has been left out, leaving a gap in our understanding of this complex and still controversial cinematic form.4 The Jewish identity of a signiﬁcant portion of noir’s prime practitioners affected the noir cycle in several ways. First, all the Jewish émigré directors came to the United States when they did, namely in the 1930s or early 1940s, not because they were German or Austrian (or Ukrainian, in the case of Anatole Litvak) but because they were Jewish. They had left Germany and, most of them, later France (or Austria, in the case of Otto Preminger) under duress. Undoubtedly, some might have been lured to work in the United States at some point anyway, as had a coterie of their Jewish compatriots in the 1920s, such as Ernst Lubitsch, E. A. Dupont, William Wyler, Charles Vidor, and Bertolt Viertel.5 All the “second-wave” European Jewish directors, however, rather than mainly drawn to Hollywood, were driven from Europe by Hitler. They were not merely immigrants, but exiles. As Billy Wilder explained in an interview: “Basically you would have to divide the inﬂux of picture makers from Germany to the United States into two categories: First there were the ones that were hired in the 1920s by the American studios because they were outstanding geniuses like F. W. Murnau . . . and Ernst Lubitsch. . . . Then, in the mid-1930s came an avalanche of Jewish refugees who were looking for jobs on the basis of their experience in the German industry, such as Fred Zinnemann, Otto Preminger, and myself. Most of us didn’t come because we were invited like the ﬁrst group. We came to save our lives.”6 Second, the expressionist style that historians (not without controversy) identify as foundational to the noir aesthetic, and which German-based ﬁlmmakers are credited with importing to the United States, already bore a strong Jewish trace.7 The overwhelming Jewish inﬂuence on German cultural life generally, from the ﬁn de siècle through the Weimar era, has been extensively charted. Peter Gay’s Weimar Culture: The Outsider as Insider already in its title connotes the extent of the Jewish impact.8 Walter Laqueur baldly asserts, “Without Jews there would have been no ‘Weimar culture,’” which is especially impressive given that Jews had been full participants in German society only since the mid-1800s and by the 1920s made up less than 1 percent of the total German population.9 From artists to impresarios, publishers to patrons, critics to curators (not to mention the media, the sciences, politics, and ﬁnance), Jews “were in the forefront of every new, daring, revolutionary movement.”10 Similarly in Austria, where they were also a “minute minority,” Jews, Stefan Zweig wrote, “with their more agile perception less burdened by tradition, became everywhere the champions and sponsors of everything that was new.”11 Jewish novelist Jakob Wassermann went\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nfurther, noting how, in Vienna, “the entire public life was dominated by Jews”: from doctors, lawyers, and professors to actors, journalists, politicians, and poets, “Jews gave their imprint to the city.”12 As for German Expressionism speciﬁcally, Jews did not “invent” this art movement to the degree that they helped build the Hollywood ﬁlm industry, but here also—and to a greater extent than generally has been acknowledged—they played an overarching role.13 Just as Expressionism’s imprint on the German stage is inconceivable without the towering ﬁgure of Jewish impresario Max Reinhardt and the seminal plays of Frank Wedekind, Ernst Toller, and Walter Hasenclever, so is its cinematic incarnation—ﬁrst in the horror ﬁlm, then in offshoots such as the Kammerspiel, street, and crime ﬁlm—unimaginable without the pioneering efforts of Jewish producers Erich Pommer and Seymour Nebenzahl; directors Lang, Dupont, Bernhardt, Robert Wiene, Joe May, Paul Czinner, Karl Grune, and Lupu Pick; writers Carl Mayer, Hans Janowitz, Henrik Galeen, Norbert Falk, and Robert Liebmann; actors Elizabeth Bergner, Fritz Kortner, Alexander Granach, Peter Lorre, Curt Bois, and Greta Mosheim; cinematographers Karl Freund, Eugen Schüfftan, and Curt Courant; and set designers Ulmer, Hans Dreier, Ernö Metzner, Kurt Richter, Ludwig Meidner, and Hans Poelzig, among many others.14 A 1932 Nazi Party survey of the German ﬁlm industry, unlikely to be an undercount, found that 41 percent of the scenarists, 45 percent of the composers, 47 percent of the directors, and 81 percent of the distribution company heads were Jewish.15 Third, even the inﬂuence of French poetic realism on ﬁlm noir can be linked substantially to the Jewish émigré directors. It may well be true, as Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton claim, that non-émigré American noirists such as John Huston and Howard Hawks were unfamiliar with the poetic realist work of Julien Duvivier, Jean Renoir, and Marcel Carné.16 On the other hand, as Ginette Vincendeau points out, several of the Jewish refugees who would help jump-start ﬁlm noir were not only aware of French ﬁlms of the 1930s, but in fact had made many of them. Before moving on to Hollywood, ﬁgures such as Lang, Siodmak, Wilder, Bernhardt, and Ophuls spent time—some only a year (Lang and Wilder), others the entire decade (Siodmak, Bernhardt, and Ophuls)—working in the French studios.17 Given that among ﬁlmmakers who came to the United States after working in France, only two non-Jews, Jacques Tourneur and Rudolph Maté, made any signiﬁcant formative contributions to classical noir (Out of the Past [1948] for Tourneur; The Dark Past [1948], D.O.A., and Union Station [both 1950] for Maté), it would seem, as with German Expressionism, that Jewish émigré directors were prime carriers of poetic realism into the noir aesthetic.18 Fourth, as Nazism advanced in Germany and then throughout Europe, and, concomitantly, as anti-Semitic acts increased (the Nuremberg laws, Kristallnacht, the Final Solution), the disturbing effects of these developments on the consciousness of Jewish émigré ﬁlmmakers would have been particularly\n\n4\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nacute. The bleak worldview and stark exposure of society’s underbelly, which had already characterized Weimar cinema and would permeate ﬁlm noir, also arguably found greater, or at least more overdetermined, resonance among Jewish émigré directors than among their American-born ( Jewish or non-Jewish) counterparts. As for the deep psychological and moral ambivalence of the noir universe, who could possibly have experienced this aspect more profoundly than “wholly assimilated” German and Austrian Jews?19 Beyond the Freudian divided self that all humans are purported to develop upon entry into the social order, and which is said to ﬁnd its most overt expression in ﬁlm noir, German-speaking Jewish refugees brought with them to the United States another deeply conﬂicted yet historically grounded and culturally speciﬁc syndrome. Jews’ post-emancipation assimilation into mainstream Germanic society in the 1800s precipitated a bifurcated lifestyle and a schizoid consciousness, captured in the folk adage, “A Jew at home, a gentleman on the street.” Further duality resulted from assimilated Jews’ alienation from their eastern Jewish cousins, who remained an embarrassing and potentially threatening reminder of their own ghetto roots. Once in the United States, those Jewish émigrés who had become “more German than the Germans” were confronted with a singular irony and an agonizing dilemma. The irony came from the fact that many of the studio and production heads the émigré Jews ended up working for, and often creatively struggling against, were themselves Ostjuden (eastern European Jews). What resulted, as Lawrence Weschler points out, “was a ritual of class revenge. Back in Europe the highbrow cultural ﬁgures of Vienna and Berlin had looked upon these peasants and shopkeepers with disdain, and now they were getting a touch of their own treatment.”20 The dilemma derived from the fact that it was, after all, the émigrés’ Mutterland/Vaterland (for Austrians, their cultural patrimony) that had begun devouring its own and was running roughshod over Europe, if not the world. The effect of this “shadowlike awareness” of personal and collective trauma, with its “antinostalgic resonance of ‘home’”—to extrapolate from Janet Burstein’s analysis of émigré Jewish women writers—“cannot be overestimated.”21 Moreover, such ambivalence was compounded, especially from a psychoanalytic perspective, once the United States entered the war, as the Jewish refugees now found themselves allied, patriotically speaking, with the potential perpetrators of matricide/ patricide. Separating good parent (German Kultur) from bad (Nazism) helped mitigate the crime, but the stigma remained. Animus toward the United States, meanwhile, although signiﬁcantly alleviated by the sanctuary (and employment) their host country provided, was exacerbated by a superiority complex and critical stance similar to that which grounded their disdain for the Ostjuden. Émigré anti-Americanism had both cultural and political components, perhaps most cogently expressed in the critical theory of Jewish émigrés Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. In\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nDialectic of Enlightenment (1944), the two Frankfurt School theorists argued that the “germ of regression” that had led to the fascist outbreak in central Europe was also apparent in the institutional structures of the United States.22 Thus, despite their cognizance of and gratitude for U.S. involvement in the war against fascism, Adorno and Horkheimer “were eager to point out similarities in the forms of mass control and mass entertainment used in Nazi Germany and the United States.”23 Los Angeles, on the one hand, was a “model of the modern city” that “shared with Berlin the exile’s uprootedness, modernity, artiﬁciality, and a constant ﬂow of newcomers in a never-ending process of renewal and transformation.”24 But it was also, for many, a cultural backwater, “a wasteland, anything but a civilized place to the cultivated Europeans,” with Ostjüdische Hollywood representing the epitome of vulgarity and philistinism.25 Yet these “two competing mythologies”—“between innocence and corruption, unspoiled nature and ruthless development, naivete and hucksterism, enthusiasm and shameless exploitation”—are precisely what allowed the exiles, in Ehrhard Bahr’s words, “to adopt a dialectical stance toward the image of Los Angeles as a natural paradise in order to perceive it as a cityscape of modernism.”26 The result, for Joseph Horowitz, was a form of “cultural exchange . . . a twofold posture of openness and retention, a percolating mixture of new ways and old.”27 And ﬁlm noir, especially—as a challenge to both classical Hollywood cinema and U.S. society, and through its associations with Weimar cinema’s artistic aspirations—offered exile ﬁlmmakers the nearest thing to dialectical exchange with the culture industry as was possible from within the belly of the beast. Furthermore, that exchange cut both ways, because not only the émigré ﬁlmmakers but also their studio bosses saw the beneﬁt of, if not burying the hatchet, then at least blunting its blade. For the moguls, whose antipathy toward their émigré “brethren” extended to the aesthetic and budgetary excesses of the UFA (Universum Film AG) “style,” more artistic ﬁlms also served their business interests by weakening the émigrés’ industries of origin while also appealing to both European and U.S. highbrow audiences.28 Attitudes and policies of the Americans themselves compounded the émigrés’ ambivalence toward their host (and in most cases, adopted) country. The strict immigration quotas imposed by the National Origins Act of 1924 had been aimed to a large extent at Jews; much to the country’s lasting shame, the legislation persisted, into World War II, even after the U.S. government knew of the Final Solution. Of course, the émigré directors (and many other refugee artists and intellectuals) were able to circumvent these restrictions, but the sense of collective unwelcomeness was palpable. Also unavoidable was its personal ﬂipside, survivor guilt, as the comparative safety and comfort the émigrés enjoyed clashed irreconcilably with anxiety over the fate of their loved ones abroad and newsreel images of their homeland “being bombed to smithereens.”29\n\n6\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nOvert anti-Semitism in the United States, meanwhile, which had risen with the Depression of the 1930s, continued even after Kristallnacht, with polls in 1939 indicating that upward of 80 percent of the American public “were opposed to increasing quotas for Germany to help refugees.”30 Moreover, those who had already entered the country, particularly the cultural elite, came in for special opprobrium. A letter in Life magazine of 1940, titled “Refugees De Luxe,” decried the “well-to-do refugees taking over expensive hotels, ﬁlling fashionable resorts, and dining in expensive restaurants, displaying assertive and ﬂamboyant behavior.”31 Articles in American Magazine, with headings such as “Refugees—Burden or Asset?” “Spies Among Refugees,” and “Refugee Gold Rush,” “all contributed to the impression that refugees were a problematic issue in America.”32 Adding injury to insult, after Pearl Harbor the German émigrés found themselves “classiﬁed as ‘enemy aliens,’” “had all their foreign royalties and accounts impounded,” and “were also required to observe a strict curfew” during the war—not as stiff a penalty as Japanese citizens had to pay, certainly, but more bitterly ironic.33 The early cold war period proved especially threatening for the émigrés, although in this case there was some method to the madness. None of the Jewish émigré noir directors was a card-carrying communist, but all, like most Jews, were left-leaning, and the strong linkage between anti-Semitism and anticommunism made them ripe targets for the witch-hunters.34 Only one Jewish émigré involved with the ﬁlm industry, composer Hanns Eisler, was actually called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), which began investigating alleged subversive activity in Hollywood in 1947, but he was also the ﬁrst to be interrogated by the committee, preceding the Hollywood Ten by a month. Called “the Karl Marx of music,” a title that might have earned him praise in Weimar Germany, Eisler, despite claiming never to have joined the Communist Party, left the United States of his own accord to avoid deportation.35 The direct repercussions to the émigré directors were, in the end, comparatively slight: Lang claims to have been blacklisted for a year in the early 1950s; Bernhardt barely escaped blacklisting despite being denounced, by a fellow refugee, for his German communist afﬁliations in the 1920s. Billy Wilder and Fred Zinnemann were brieﬂy tainted in the Director’s Guild ﬁght over loyalty oaths mounted by Cecil B. DeMille, during which DeMille notoriously questioned his foreign-born colleagues’ patriotism by emphasizing their German names: “Vilder” and “Zinnemann.”36 Although DeMille’s ploy backﬁred—the guild membership booed him, and even fellow right-winger John Ford openly chastised him—the émigrés’ anxiety over their leftist sympathies was palpable. Billy Wilder was afraid his ﬁrst wife Judith’s communist ties might come back to haunt him, and Ulmer urged his daughter Arianné not to make political waves in high school for fear of the consequences, both to her and to him.37\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nBesides their concern over their susceptibility to persecution, the eerie echoes of Nazism in the anticommunist crusade appalled the émigrés. As Thomas Mann stated in a radio address in 1948: “I am painfully familiar with certain political trends. Spiritual intolerance, political inquisitions—and all in the name of an alleged ‘state of emergency’—that is how it started in Germany. What followed was fascism and what followed fascism was war.”38 Partly from these concerns, partly due to more favorable political conditions in Europe, Mann and many other émigré artists and intellectuals returned to the Continent, some even to Germany, in the late 1940s and early 1950s. And as the decline of the Hollywood ﬁlm industry continued into the 1950s, some of the refugee noir directors (Lang, Siodmak, Ophuls) followed suit. An added bitter irony here, corollary to the Ostjude/Westjude conﬂict limned above, is that the anticommunist crusade in the ﬁlm industry was spearheaded by the still largely eastern European Jewish studio heads with whom the Jewish émigrés had already crossed swords socioculturally. As Billy Wilder sardonically summarized, “We went from Adolph Hitler to Adolph Zukor [head of Paramount Pictures].”39 To claim an overdetermined ambivalence for Jewish refugees is not to grant them a monopoly on historically based suffering. The situation in Europe leading up to and including World War II may have affected refugee Jews most adversely, but Americans of all stripes experienced their share of economic hardship, social turmoil, and psychological anxiety in the Depression and wartime years, and even more apocalyptic fears in the cold war years that followed. What I am proposing is that a Jewish factor be added to the “Zeitgeist theory” of ﬁlm noir, which holds that “the pessimism, cynicism, violence and paranoia that typiﬁes ﬁlm noirs” can be explained as “an articulation of the cultural and social mood of [wartime and] postwar America; a mood that was itself pessimistic, cynical, violent and paranoid.”40 The emotional and psychological trauma induced in all who lived through these trying times, and which found at least partial expression in the emerging cycle of ﬁlms retroactively labeled ﬁlm noir, was necessarily heightened in a group of Jewish ﬁlmmakers who had been driven from a homeland and a culture to which they still felt strongly attached—and yet which in the interim had become the mortal enemy not merely of their adopted country, the United States, but of all humankind. Fifth, and related to all the above, is admittedly the most problematic, but also the most intriguing, issue to pursue in regard to the Jewish émigré directors: Jewish sensibility. Beyond the more immediate inﬂuences of German Expressionism, French poetic realism, and the heightened ambivalence of exile, are their other aesthetic and thematic features in ﬁlm noir that can be ascribed to uniquely Jewish ways of experiencing and looking at the world? If “unique” is understood here in historically grounded and culturally constructed terms, and “Jewish” is taken to embrace an array of identiﬁcations and expressions, then I\n\n8\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\npropose that there can be. And through close readings of individual ﬁlms by the Jewish émigré directors, I will explore the possibilities, and the limitations, of such a proposition.\n\nJewish Émigré Noir: Defined Film noir’s retroactive identiﬁcation as a distinctive ﬁlmic type by French critics in 1946; the lack of awareness of this attribution among most American ﬁlmmakers, critics, and ﬁlmgoers during the classical noir period (circa 1940–1960); and the broad range of films subsequently designated as film noir have led scholars to eschew a generic categorization in favor of more ﬂuid concepts such as cycle, series, movement, historical construct, or cultural phenomenon.41 For our purposes, this “category crisis” poses less of a problem conceptually than practically, where the issue becomes, ﬁrst, identifying which ﬁlms by Jewish émigré directors should be considered ﬁlm noir; and second, determining who should be considered a Jewish émigré noir director. The identiﬁcation issue is notoriously slippery. Even leaving aside absurdly broad noir taxonomies such as Raymond Bellour’s, which manages to include King Kong (1933) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) in the category, the differences among scholarly listings are striking.42 My solution was to interact with and adjudicate among four prominent ﬁlm noir encyclopedias: Michael F. Keaney’s Film Noir Guide, Spencer Selby’s Dark City: The Film Noir, Paul Duncan’s Film Noir, and Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward’s Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style.43 The result is certainly not the ﬁnal word on noir classiﬁcation but rather a compromise of convenience among these reputable, but still signiﬁcantly divergent, surveys. The who’s who of Jewish émigré directors begins with the historical distinction between ﬁrst-wave Jewish immigrants and second-wave Jewish émigrés. That only four of the immigrants—Michael Curtiz, Lewis Milestone, Charles Vidor, and William Wyler—made any ﬁlm noirs (and only Curtiz, who was Hungarian, made any signiﬁcant number) renders the distinction somewhat moot,44 except for its reinforcement of the notion that the “separation anxiety” experienced by Jews who had “arrived in ﬂight” from Europe (rather than by choice) was a signiﬁcant factor in these ﬁlmmakers’ noir orientation.45 As for those Jewish directors, such as Hugo Haas and László Benedek, who were driven from their homelands and might otherwise be considered part of the Jewish émigré noir grouping, the lack of direct involvement with the Weimar film industry is grounds for exclusion. Haas, a noted Czech ﬁlm actor and director, came to the United States directly from Czechoslovakia following the Nazi invasion and occupation in 1938. Benedek worked as a screenwriter and ﬁlm editor in Hungary until World War II, whence he escaped to Hollywood and began directing in 1944. Another second-wave arrival, Boris Ingster, a Latvian-born ﬁlmmaker who directed a key early ﬁlm noir, Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), is left out of\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nthe grouping because he lacked direct contact with Weimar cinema and because he came to the United States of his own accord. Having worked with Sergei Eisenstein on The Battleship Potemkin (1925), Ingster joined Eisenstein on his trip to the United States in the early 1930s, and—unlike his mentor, who returned to the Soviet Union in disillusionment—remained in Hollywood for the rest of his career. One exception to the above criteria is Willy Wilder (aka W. Lee Wilder), who came to the United States in the mid-1920s yet did not become involved in ﬁlmmaking until the mid-1940s. I include Willy among the Jewish émigré noir directors for several reasons: ﬁrst, because of his near total neglect in the ﬁeld until now; second, because his noirs are surpassed in number only by Lang, Siodmak, and Alfred Hitchcock, and one of them, The Pretender (1947), ﬁgures prominently in the noir canon; third, because of his sibling relationship to Billy Wilder, with whose life and work Willy’s signiﬁcantly interfaces; and ﬁnally, because several of his noirs relate intriguingly to Jewish themes.46 Another mildly exceptional case, for a different reason, is Anatole Litvak. Born in the Ukraine and raised in Russia, Litvak is the sole non-German or -Austrian in my Jewish émigré noir director grouping. He makes the cut because, unlike Haas, Benedek, or Ingster, Litvak had considerable contact with Weimar cinema, having worked in Germany off and on from the mid-1920s until his escape to France in the early 1930s.\n\nJewish Émigré Noir: Quantified No serious observer can (or does) deny that Jewish émigré directors—Fritz Lang, Robert Siodmak, Billy and Willy Wilder, Otto Preminger, Edgar G. Ulmer, Curtis Bernhardt, Max Ophuls, John Brahm, Anatole Litvak, and Fred Zinnemann— directed a disproportionate number of the earliest and most deﬁnitive examples of the noir canon. The following list highlights only some of their more salient ﬁlms released in or before 1950: Fury (1936), You Only Live Once (1937), The Woman in the Window (1945), Scarlet Street (1945) [Lang]; Phantom Lady (1944), The Killers (1946), The Dark Mirror (1946), Criss Cross (1949) [Siodmak]; Double Indemnity (1944), Sunset Boulevard (1950) [Billy Wilder]; The Pretender [Willy Wilder]; Laura (1944), Fallen Angel (1945), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) [Preminger]; Detour (1945), Strange Illusion (1945), Ruthless (1948) [Ulmer]; Conﬂict (1945), Possessed (1947) [Bernhardt]; Caught, The Reckless Moment (both 1947) [Ophuls]; The Lodger (1944), Guest in the House (1944), Hangover Square (1945), The Locket (1946) [Brahm]; Out of the Fog (1940), The Long Night (1947), Sorry, Wrong Number (1948) [Litvak]; Act of Violence (1949) [Zinnemann]. (See the appendix for more details.) And the following computation underscores the numerical predominance of Jewish émigré directors (again based on cross-referencing): Lang stands alone as the most proliﬁc noir director with ﬁfteen ﬁlms; Siodmak ties Anthony Mann for second with ten; Hitchcock comes in third with nine; John Brahm and Willy Wilder are close behind with eight; Joseph L. Lewis is next with seven; Preminger\n\n10\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nand Ulmer join Nicholas Ray, Jean Negulesco, Robert Wise, Richard Fleischer, Joseph Losey, Lewis Allen, and Andrew L. Stone with six; and Bernhardt and Litvak are among a crowd with ﬁve that includes Curtiz, Edward Dmytryk, Henry Hathaway, Phil Karlson, John Farrow, and Maxwell Shane. In sum, ﬁve of the top seven, and eight of the top twenty-four, ﬁlm noir directors (in number of ﬁlms made) are Jewish émigrés. Further down the noir list one ﬁnds Billy Wilder with three ﬁlms, Ophuls with two, and Zinnemann with one. But three of these ﬁlms, Wilder’s Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard and Ophuls’s Caught, are quintessential to the noir canon, and Zinnemann’s Act of Violence is not only a key Jewish émigré noir but a vastly underrated noir altogether. Alain Silver, the Andrew Sarris of noir criticism, provides additional, if inadvertent, support for the preeminence of Jewish émigré directors when, in naming his “ten best” ﬁlm noirs (four of which are by Jewish refugees), he states, “I did have one rule: a single movie per director, otherwise Siodmak, Lang, Ophuls and Wilder might have overwhelmed the ﬁeld and made it an all-émigré list.”47\n\nJewish Émigré Noir: Qualified “There is no history of mankind,” wrote Karl Popper, “there is only an indeﬁnite number of histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”48 Similarly, although the Jewishness of the refugee directors undoubtedly played a crucial role in the formation of ﬁlm noir, this is only one of several, sometimes overlapping determinants. The other important factors have been amply rehearsed in the vast and ever-burgeoning ﬁlm noir scholarship.49 These include ﬁrst and foremost, besides the German Expressionist and poetic realist inﬂuences already mentioned, the socalled hard-boiled American crime novels of Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Horace McCoy, Raymond Chandler, and (to a less hard-boiled extent) Cornell Woolrich. These (non-Jewish) writers’ work, which formed the basis for several noteworthy noirs (The Maltese Falcon, 1941; The Glass Key, 1942; Double Indemnity; Phantom Lady; Murder My Sweet, 1944; Mildred Pierce, 1945; The Big Sleep, 1946; The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1946), features noir’s telltale clipped, tough-guy, Hemingway-esque dialogue; frequent ﬁrst-person narration by an alienated, antihero protagonist; a gritty urban environment that includes forays into the haunts of the rich and famous; and, frequently but not obligatorily, a femme fatale. If we look at the Jewish émigré noir output, however, an alternative pattern emerges. Although Jewish émigrés directed a few noirs based on hard-boiled novels (Double Indemnity, The Brasher Doubloon, 1947), these are exceptions. Far more prevalent are works that take a quite different, often decidedly un-toughguy tack. The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street, for example, two of Lang’s early American noirs, feature pointedly soft-boiled protagonists—ordinary men who, like the petty bourgeois antiheroes of the 1920s German street ﬁlm, venture at their peril from their drab middle-class existences into the pulsating nightlife\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nof the city.50 In some ways, shop cashier Christopher Cross of Scarlet Street and professor Richard Wanley of The Woman in the Window, both roles played against type by Edward G. Robinson, seem more like the British-type detective hero to which the hard-boiled American version was concocted as an alternative. These were men, in Gilbert Seldes’s words, of “effeminate manners, artistic leanings, and elaborate deductions,” who compare to a “real man” like “a shop-window full of dummies.”51 The British detective hero, however, at least got his man; the Lang antihero is barely a man at all. Tellingly, he lacks access even to the tough noir’s ﬁrst-person, voice-over narration, denying him even partial control of events through interpretation and commentary. And although he is, like the libidinous tough hero, strongly attracted to the femme fatale, he is also, unlike the tough hero, physically unsuited for the role. The effeminately coded “artistic leanings” of the British detective appear in protagonists and other main characters of Jewish émigré noirs to a striking degree. Chris Cross is a Sunday painter, and Professor Wanley falls for the woman portrayed in a painting. Harry Quincy (George Sanders), the avuncular title character in The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry (1945), is a frustrated painter working as a pattern designer, and Douglas Proctor (Ralph Bellamy), who falls for the femme fatale in Guest in the House, is a painter and magazine illustrator. Detour’s ill-starred hero, Al Roberts (Tom Neal), is a classical pianist stuck playing nightclubs; and two other ﬁgures, Hangover Square’s George Harvey Bone (Laird Cregar) and City for Conquest’s (1940) Eddie Kenney (Arthur Kennedy), are frustrated composers. Joe Gillis (William Holden), the “victim hero” of Sunset Boulevard; Stephen Byrne (Louis Hayward), the murderer-protagonist of House by the River (1950); and Gaston Morel ( John Carradine), the eponymous serial killer of Bluebeard (1944), are, respectively, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, a struggling novelist, and a demented puppeteer. Jack Marlow (Franchot Tone) of Phantom Lady, the leading man’s best friend but also the arch villain, is a schizophrenic sculptor; Mark Lamphere (Michael Redgrave), the Jekyll-Hyde husband of the protagonist in Secret Beyond the Door (1948), is an architect and a magazine editor; The Locket’s Norman Clyde, played by iconic tough guy Robert Mitchum, is here a sensitive artist; and art plays perhaps its most pivotal role in Laura, in which a painting of the eponymous career girl (played by Gene Tierney) embodies the romantic obsession of both the epicene villain, fashion maven Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), and the ostensible tough-guy hero, Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). In addition, three of the refugee-noir protagonists, The Suspect’s (1944) Philip Marshall (Charles Laughton), Uncle Harry’s Harry Quincy (Sanders), and Bluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons’s (1960) Henri Landru (Sanders again), are played by British actors. As for female protagonists, an inordinate number of these, constituting a veritable subset within the noir cycle, appear in Jewish émigré noirs: Celia Lamphere ( Joan Bennett) in Secret Beyond the Door; Carol “Kansas” Richman\n\n12\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\n(Ella Raines) in Phantom Lady; Jackie Lamont/Abigail Martin (Deanna Durbin) in Christmas Holiday (1944); Helen Capel (Dorothy McGuire) in The Spiral Staircase (1945); Terry and Ruth Collins (identical twins played by Olivia de Havilland) in The Dark Mirror; Katie and Pat Bosworth (also identical twins, played by Bette Davis) in A Stolen Life (1946); Louise Howell Graham ( Joan Crawford) in Possessed; Leonora Eames (Barbara Bel Geddes) in Caught; Lucia Harper (Bennett) in The Reckless Moment; Margie Foster ( June Havoc) in Once a Thief (1953); and Jenny Hager (Hedy Lamarr) in The Strange Woman (1946). That Jews, as a historically disenfranchised and maligned people, should identify with other marginalized and oppressed groups such as women and gays, as well as people of color and the lower classes, is psychologically self-evident and empirically documented in Jews’ American voting record and highly disproportionate involvement in various progressive social movements. Additionally, if more subtly, the linkage of Jewish masculinity with effeminacy, and by extension with homosexuality, has a long and ambivalent history. Sander Gilman, in his psycho-semiotic study The Jew’s Body, describes how the European image of the male Jew as feminized was overdetermined: ﬁrst, by his stereotypically stunted physiognomy, ﬂat feet, and awkward gait, which rendered him “innately unable to undertake physical labor”; and second, by his circumcised penis, which was deemed analogous to the clitoris of the woman.52 The Jewish/gay connection was made discursively explicit in the late 1800s, when anti-Semitism was labeled a “scientiﬁc” term for Jew hating at the same historical moment that homosexuality was being clinically designated a new disease.53 Jewish male internalization of the feminizing discourse is evident in the early Zionist movement, whose emphasis on physical exercise and manual labor must be viewed partly as a reaction against the stereotype of the Jewish weakling. Physician and Zionist leader Max Nordau’s notion of the neue Muskeljude (new muscle Jew) was devised as an antidote to Jews’ alleged physical, and thus also political, puniness and ineffectuality.54 Nordau’s therapeutic prescription would be realized, of course, in the new state of Israel’s kibbutznik, Mossad operative, and army soldier. The muscle Jew ideal would inﬁltrate the United States in the twentieth century also, albeit with a more working-class, less patriotic tinge. Where would American organized crime have been without mob kingpins Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and Mickey Cohen, or American boxing without champions Benny Leonard, Max Baer, and Maxie Rosenbloom?55 Despite what some might see as healthy responses to, and others as overcompensation for, the Jewish weakling syndrome, the image of the feminized—or at least less ruggedly masculine—Jewish male persisted, if not prevailed, even in the United States. Harvard president Charles W. Eliot announced in 1907, shortly before the university instituted anti-Jewish enrollment quotas that would last into the 1960s, “Jews are distinctly inferior in stature and physical development . . . to any other race.”56 Sociologist Edward Alsworth Ross historicized the assess-\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nment in 1914, contrasting the American pioneers who crossed the continent by wagon train with the immigrant Jews who came over by ocean liner. These Jews, Ross proclaimed, were “undersized and weak-muscled,” and shunned “bodily activity.”57 Über-anti-Semite Henry Ford summarized the Jewish weakling sentiment in the 1920s, declaring ﬂatly, “Jews are not sportsmen.”58 Little wonder that second-generation American Jew Irving Howe, in his memoir World of Our Fathers, concluded that the “suspicion of the physical, fear of hurt, anxiety over the sheer ‘pointlessness’ of play . . . all went deep into the recesses of the Jewish psyche.”59 Although the existence of the Jewish runt stereotype is beyond dispute, not everyone agrees that it was constructed entirely from without and internalized by Jews, or even whether such a self-image was, or is, “bad for the Jews.” Daniel Boyarin, in Unheroic Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish Man, argues that the sensitive, scholarly male Jew devoted to religious study developed in the early rabbinic period, and was encouraged thereafter, partly as a defense mechanism, partly as an overt rejection of and alternative to the more physical, aggressive masculinity espoused and practiced by the larger, and largely hostile, gentile society.60 Boyarin’s queer reading of the gentle rabbi’s legacy is aimed primarily, and polemically, at the muscle Jew of modern-day Israel. Philip Roth’s alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, applies a similar revisionism to the American scene when he states, in American Pastoral, “Physical aggression, even camouﬂaged by athletic uniforms and ofﬁcial rules and intended to do no harm to Jews, was not a traditional source of pleasure in our community.”61 Nor would such aggression, even camouﬂaged by a private investigator’s license or a Wild West honor code, likely have been a source of pleasure to the Jewish refugee community that helped pioneer ﬁlm noir. Heirs to a Jewish legacy and historical circumstance that privileged intellect over action, brokering over building, the luftmensch (“air man,” or occupational schlemiel) over the man of the world, Lang, Siodmak, Ulmer, and the others were preternaturally less disposed than their American cohorts toward the virile, gun-toting, tough-talking detective.62 Their antiheroes thus tended toward the artist and intellectual, the bank clerk and insurance agent, and to a character they were said, and perhaps sensed themselves, most to resemble: the woman. This is not to assert, of course, that the attitudes of Jewish émigré noir directors toward this and other aspects of the noir aesthetic were monolithic or monocausal. Just as Jewish émigrés were by no means solely responsible for the formation of ﬁlm noir, neither is their European-based, Nazi-inﬂected Jewishness the sole factor to consider in analyzing their noir ﬁlms. Despite their shared history and experience, differences within difference—of class and region, of background and personality, of psychological motivation and cultural orientation—existed among the refugee Jewish directors and expressed itself in their work, to which the case studies that make up the bulk of this book will attest.\n\n14\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nConversely, the refugee Jews were not impervious to the various historical, cultural, socioeconomic, and ideological factors that inﬂuenced all ﬁlmmakers working in the United States during the classical noir period. What I am arguing is that crucial similarities among the Jewish refugees, and differences between them and non-refugees from a Jewish standpoint, have previously been ignored and deserve to be addressed as part of a reassessment of the ontology and epistemology of ﬁlm noir.\n\nWartime Effects The relevance of World War II to the Jewish/noir question goes beyond the unique psychological conﬂicts this universally tragic event may have induced in Jewish émigré noir directors. Recent work by Sheri Chinen Biesen, regarding the war’s importance to the noir formation in general, has special pertinence here. Countering inﬂuential views, such as those of ﬁlmmaker-historian Paul Schrader, that noir was predominantly a “postwar trend pre-empted by the war,” Biesen argues that the war generated “a complex array of social, economic, cultural, political, technological, and creative circumstances” that spurred rather than blunted noir’s emergence.63 To the wartime inﬂuence most frequently cited—namely, that the studios’ wartime rationing of lights, electricity, and ﬁlm stock, and the need to recycle sets and props, encouraged noir’s emblematic low-key lighting and sparse décor—Biesen adds several other factors: (1) increased anxiety over loved ones in combat, fear of possible invasion at home, and hardship caused by government rationing and war-related shortages made moviegoers more receptive to the dark visions of ﬁlm noir; (2) labor-driven migration to the cities made noir’s urban milieu more familiar; (3) nighttime settings and darkened backgrounds resonated with those forced into twentyfour-hour production shifts and with everyone confronting “the shadowy abysses of blacked-out wartime cities at night”; (4) viewers’ experience with dark themes and styles was foreshadowed before the war and reinforced during it through other popular cultural forms such as dime novels, comic books, and radio dramas (e.g., Black Mask novels, Marvel comics, Orson Welles’s War of the Worlds and The Shadow broadcasts), which likewise grew darker during the war; (5) the federal Ofﬁce of Censorship’s lifting of its ban on depicting war-related atrocities in documentary ﬁlms established, in 1943/1944, a precedent for increased screen violence in narrative ﬁlms that was tailor-made for ﬁlm noir; (6) the vaunted sexuality of ﬁlm noir also responded to the shifting gender roles of independent working women and appealed to the desires of combat-hardened military men, both overseas GIs and returning veterans; (7) the studios’ wartime labor needs, with many ﬁlmmakers pressed into wartime service but with most foreign directors over the age for combat, “gave greater creative . . . authority to European émigré ﬁlmmakers (for example Michael Curtiz, Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, and Rudolph Maté).”64\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nOther points add further weight to Biesen’s wartime noir ontology and its connection to the Jewish refugees. First, although ﬁlm noir was initially identiﬁed as an emerging ﬁlm cycle and given its distinctive name by the French after the war, this designation was prompted mainly by a group of ﬁlms made during the war: The Maltese Falcon ( John Huston), This Gun for Hire (Frank Tuttle, 1942), Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend (Billy Wilder), Murder My Sweet (Edward Dmytryk), Laura (Preminger), and The Woman in the Window (Lang).65 Four of the seven were directed by Jewish émigré directors, and a ﬁfth, Murder, My Sweet, was strongly inﬂuenced by Double Indemnity.66 Second, the years 1944–1945 saw a dramatic increase both in the number of ﬁlm noirs released in the United States and in the number of noirs directed by Jewish refugees, and Double Indemnity, again, played a crucial role in the spurt. Silver and Ward’s survey of ﬁlm noirs by year lists only two noirs for 1943, neither directed by a Jewish émigré. In 1944 the total jumps to eight, and in 1945 to ﬁfteen, with ﬁve of the eight and seven of the ﬁfteen, respectively, directed by Jewish émigrés.67 Although the government’s relaxed censorship policies in wartime documentaries encouraged reduced content restrictions in Hollywood ﬁction ﬁlms, the Production Code Administration’s (PCA) approval of a treatment for Double Indemnity in 1943 (an earlier version based on the 1935 Cain novel had been summarily rejected) was regarded by producers as an “an emancipation for Hollywood writing,” and led to a ﬂood of ﬁlm proposals dealing with murder and eros.68 Third, according to Biesen, eight of sixteen ﬁlms that “heralded the ﬁrst deﬁnitive phase of ﬁlm noir” (Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, The Woman in the Window, Scarlet Street, Ministry of Fear, Phantom Lady, Laura, and Detour) were by Jewish refugee directors; and those that “represent the most expressionistic, stylistically black phase of ﬁlm noir” include Double Indemnity, Phantom Lady, and the Double Indemnity–inﬂuenced Murder, My Sweet.69 Finally, Double Indemnity marks, for Biesen (and most noir scholars), the “deﬁnitive, fullblown exemplar of the early noir crime cycle’s steady emergence.”70\n\nCreative Control The alleged “greater authority” granted émigré directors during the war is signiﬁcant from an auteurist standpoint as well. It certainly lends support to the proposition that ﬁlm noirs made by these directors might have reﬂected—within commercial and ideological constraints, and given the collaborative nature of the medium—their personal creative concerns. This contention must be further reconciled with the conventional view of a classical Hollywood system—operating under Fordist conditions of production—that tended to quash, or at least severely restrict, individual expression. Of course, qualiﬁcations to such a monolithic judgment were already present in the text that most ﬁrmly established it: David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson’s The Classical Hollywood Cinema: Film Style and Mode of Production to 1960 (1985). Thomas Schatz, Richard\n\n16\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nMaltby, and Steve Neale and Murray Smith, among others, have offered further revisioning, and outright debunking, of the strict constructionist line. 71 To summarize: even in its most orthodox phase, the Hollywood studio system allowed for, indeed demanded, a measure of independence—“controlled variation,” in Bordwell, Staiger, and Thompson’s phrase—varying according to the particular studio, producer, director, genre, and other contingencies. Many of these factors worked in favor of the émigré directors, who were predisposed to a more autonomous approach due to their work in the directororiented German and French systems, and inclined to be granted (somewhat) greater creative freedom due to their established artistic credentials or European branding potential. As for the studio-producer dynamic, Lang, although he began his Hollywood career at quintessentially classical Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (with the early noir Fury), went on to make two noirs for independent producer Walter Wanger (You Only Live Once, and Scarlet Street); a third for the smallest and most independent-minded of the majors, United Artists (Hangmen Also Die! 1943); a fourth for mini-major International Pictures (The Woman in the Window); a ﬁfth for the studio regarded as the most European in Hollywood, Paramount (Ministry of Fear, 1944); and two others for his own production company, Diana Productions, Secret Beyond the Door and House by the River. Siodmak made most of his noirs for semi-independent producers ( Joan Harrison, Mark Hellinger, Nunally Johnson, Sol Siegel) who granted him comparative independence, and, when they did not, he found other ways to circumvent the system, such as by cutting “with the camera” (reducing editorial choices) and inserting key scenes of his own devising (requiring other new scenes to be built around them).72 Billy Wilder spent his entire early American career at Paramount, where he also became one of the ﬁrst U.S. writer-directors (or cowriters, in his case), thus gaining a correspondingly greater measure of creative control. Preminger became one of the ﬁrst classical-era producer-directors on his ﬁrst noirs, Laura and Fallen Angel, made for Twentieth Century Fox, which, despite being one of the vertically integrated Big Five studios, was headed by the (somewhat) more artistically inclined Darryl F. Zanuck.73 In addition to directing, Litvak produced some of his ﬁlms as well; and Bernhardt and Brahm, similar to Siodmak, claim to have “pre-shot” their ﬁlms to minimize outside tampering.74 Ophuls directed Caught for the newly formed and creative freedom–oriented Enterprise Studios, and The Reckless Moment for Wanger.75 Ulmer made his ﬁrst noirs, Detour and Strange Illusion, at the mini-studio Producers Releasing Corporation, and he continued to work outside the classical studio system—despite the lower budgets, tighter shooting schedules, and lesser talent—because of the greater autonomy that such relative independence afforded.76 Willy Wilder, meanwhile, not only produced but also partially ﬁnanced all his pictures.77 Industry-wide developments in the Hollywood system of the early-to-mid1940s further fueled resistance to the classical studio model. The Consent Decree\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nof 1940, which curtailed block booking and eliminated blind selling and thereby encouraged “that all ﬁlms, A or B, be sold to exhibitors on an individual basis . . . , greatly opened up the marketplace for the proliferation of independent production companies.”78 The Revenue Act of 1941, which raised top-bracket taxes to as much as 90 percent, was another “strong incentive for top talent to engage in independent production or seek freelance proﬁt participation deals that allowed taxation at lower capital gains rates.”79 Several prominent directors, including John Ford, William Dieterle, Allan Dwan, Edmund Goulding, and Sam Wood, began freelancing in 1941 or earlier.80 Frank Capra formed Liberty Films in 1940–1941 (revived, after his government documentaries, in 1944); James Cagney founded Cagney Productions in 1942; and Orson Welles’s landmark ﬁlm Citizen Kane (1941), a major inﬂuence on ﬁlm noir, was coproduced (together with RKO) by his Mercury Productions. Other director-producers who ﬂourished during the studio era include Howard Hawks and Ernst Lubitsch. Howard Hughes and Preston Sturges brieﬂy formed California Pictures, and Hughes later formed his own company, as did Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford. On a more contentious note, actor Olivia de Havilland successfully sued Warner Bros. in 1943–1944 over the talent-contract system, and the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP)—formed in 1941 by Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, Samuel Goldwyn, Mary Pickford, Walter Wanger, David O. Selznick, and Orson Welles— although less immediately successful in combating the studio oligarchy, played a crucial role in effecting the Paramount decision of 1948 that dismantled vertical integration in the industry and paved the way for the New Hollywood.81 Talent agents, whose ascension would radically transform Hollywood’s power relations in the postwar years, ﬁrst emerged as major players in the early 1940s. Some forged independent production partnerships with their former clients, such as Charles K. Feldman did with Siodmak on Uncle Harry and with Howard Hawks on his ﬁrst two noirs, To Have and Have Not (1944) and The Big Sleep. The most important agency to emerge in the war years was Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman’s Music Corporation of America (MCA), future owners of Universal Studios. Starting as early as 1942 with the formation of Bette Davis’s independent production company, B.D. Inc., MCA began brokering lucrative talent deals, eventually becoming the key decision maker in postwar Hollywood.82 All this is not to maintain that the historical moment of postclassical Hollywood should be shifted back from the late to the early 1940s, but rather to indicate that an incipient climate more compatible with creative independence was concurrent with the onset of ﬁlm noir.\n\nThe Genre Question Revisited The ambiguity of ﬁlm noir’s relation to genre further inscribes Jewish émigré directors in the noir discourse. If anyone in the United States would have been privy to the term “ﬁlm noir,” émigré directors—with their strong personal,\n\n18\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\ncultural, and industrial ties to Europe, and France speciﬁcally—were the most likely candidates. But direct knowledge of the French designation may have been irrelevant in any event, because the domestic press had recognized already by 1944 “a bold new trend” in American ﬁlms, featuring unprecedented levels of crime, violence, and sexuality, which they called the “red meat crime cycle.”83 By 1947, Life magazine, in referring to the ﬁlms of the year before, went further, describing in detail many of the traits now universally attributed to ﬁlm noir: “deep shadows, clutching hands, exploding revolvers, sadistic villains and heroines tormented with deeply rooted diseases of the mind . . . in a panting display of psychoneuroses, unsublimated sex and murder most foul.”84 The constitutive elements of crime, violence, and sexuality that the mid-1940s discourse and subsequent scholarship regard as essential to the noir-type ﬁlm do not by themselves separate Jewish émigré directors from the pack. Once the telltale ﬁgure of the ambivalent protagonist, the femme fatale, and expressionist mise-en-scène are added to the mix, however, a critical mass congeals linking noir to the Jewish émigré element. Signiﬁcantly, all these components were evident in, if not fundamental to, the Weimar era in which the Jewish émigré noirists cut their ﬁlmmaking teeth. As I will describe more extensively in subsequent chapters, the German Kammerspiel and street ﬁlm in particular, with their dark look, claustrophobic feel, and everyman antihero caught in a web of urban angst and transgressive sexuality, must be regarded as clear precursors of ﬁlm noir, a notion that is reinforced through these tropes’ foregrounding in several classical American noir titles: City Streets (1931, 1938), Street of Chance (1942), Scarlet Street, The House on 92nd Street (1945), The Street with No Name (1948), Panic in the Streets (1950), Side Street (1950), Road House (1948), Roadblock (1951), Drive a Crooked Road (1954), Plunder Road (1957), Nightmare Alley (1947), Thieves’ Highway (1949), Sunset Boulevard, Where the Sidewalk Ends, 711 Ocean Drive (1951), The Strip (1951), The Hitch-Hiker (1953), and Detour. The femme fatale is a more complex issue. This archetype’s genealogy in western culture extends at least as far back as the biblical Eve and extra-liturgical Lilith, with several variants in Greek mythology and a major literary revival in the nineteenth-century gothic novel. The femme fatale’s ﬁlmic incarnation can be traced pre-Weimar, and extra-Germanically, to Fox Films star Theda Bara’s exotic vamp of the mid-1910s. Nonetheless, “the licentious adulteress or viceridden ﬂapper, the lascivious high-society lady and the man-destroying Lulu of [Frank] Wedekind’s invention,” which had appeared in literary and stage form in Germany before World War I, ﬂourished there again, and for the ﬁrst time on ﬁlm, in the 1920s.85 To add that Wedekind was Jewish (as were Hungarian immigrant William Fox and Cincinnati-born Theda Bara, née Theodosia Goodman) is, again, not to deny other, in this case speciﬁcally American, inﬂuences on ﬁlm noir’s predilection for the femme fatale (such as her privileging in the hard-boiled novel or the threat posed to men by women’s unprecedented wartime entry into\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nthe workplace). Framing the spider woman in relation to her ethno-religious aspect does, however, serve to ground the ﬁgure’s cross-cultural appeal for Jewish émigré directors’ squarely in the Jewish-inﬂected Weimar period. Visual style, for many the distinguishing mark of ﬁlm noir, is for others the main reason to regard noir as a cycle or movement. Paul Schrader’s gloss of the noir aesthetic, for example—nighttime scenes, rain-drenched streets, compositional tension rather than action, a fondness for oblique lines—both ﬁts the street ﬁlm like a velvet glove and leads him to posit greater kinship between noir and German Expressionism than with the thriller or gangster ﬁlm. A group of likeminded ﬁlmmakers working in a speciﬁc time and place, reacting to particular historical conditions and expressing themselves through unconventional or alternative cinematic means—a thumbnail deﬁnition of a ﬁlm movement—are what sets noir apart, for Schrader, more than shared narrative conventions deﬁned by plot and character.86 Janey Place bases her “movement” claim for noir exclusively on “a remarkable homogeneous visual style with which it cuts across genres.”87 As with Schrader, Place’s delineation of the noir style could serve as a brief for cinematic expressionism—chiaroscuro, low-key lighting; an opposition of light and darkness; claustrophobic framing devices; unbalanced compositions; oblique shadows; obtrusive and disturbing close-ups juxtaposed with extreme high-angle shots—in all, a disorienting antirealism.88 Schrader’s division of classical noir into three, sometimes overlapping phases—wartime (1941–1946), postwar realism (1945–1949), and psychotic action/ suicidal impulse (1949–1953)—while it appears to contradict Place’s antirealist ascription (and to some extent the Life article quoted above), comports exceedingly well with the Jewish émigré thesis. Schrader’s ﬁrst phase, typiﬁed by the detective and lone-wolf protagonist, was dominated numerically and in its expressionist aspect, as we have seen, by Jewish émigré directors. The second phase, in which tension between a dominant expressionist and an emergent neorealist style created an intriguing dialectic, also provides an uncanny parallel to the Weimar period’s mid-1920s shift from Expressionism as its dominant cultural inﬂuence, to its reactive opposite, Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity). This stylistic and philosophical paradigm shift will be elaborated on in subsequent chapters, but one can readily perceive how the turn from subjectivity to objectivity, which also crucially informed the street ﬁlm, mirrors—mutatis mutandis—the aesthetic transition of Schrader’s second noir phase (whose deﬁnitive works Schrader himself dubs “‘street’ ﬁlms”).89 The third phase, when “the noir hero, seemingly under the weight of ten years of despair, started to go bananas,” also appears to have resonated strongly with the Jewish refugee directors, and for similar, culturally speciﬁc reasons. The deranged personae in third-phase Jewish émigré noirs such as Sunset Boulevard, Ace in the Hole (Wilder, 1951), Where the Sidewalk Ends, The Big Heat (Lang, 1953), and Angel Face (Preminger, 1953)—not to mention earlier-phase “pathological noirs” by Jewish émigrés\n\n20\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nsuch as The Lodger, Bluebeard, Hangover Square, Possessed, Guest in the House, and Caught—may well have functioned as alter egos for the cold warrior paranoiacs of those post-Holocaust times. But they also found unmistakable Weimar antecedents in the monsters and serial murderers of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Robert Wiene, 1919), Nosferatu (F. W. Murnau, 1922), the Mabuse trilogy (Lang, 1922, 1932), Pandora’s Box (G. W. Pabst, 1928), and M (Lang, 1931). Again, I am not claiming that Jewish émigrés were the only directors to indulge in third-phase Grand Guignol, as attested by Lewis’s Gun Crazy (1949), Raoul Walsh’s White Heat (1949), Norman Foster’s Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950), Maté’s D.O.A., and Ray’s They Live By Night (1949) and In a Lonely Place (1950), among others. But, as before, I am making a case for the substantial inﬂuence and unique motivation, in both the third noir phase and overall, of a group of Jewish ﬁlmmakers who during the Weimar era had experienced ﬁrsthand, and subsequently were most traumatically affected by, Germany’s devolution from Caligari to Hitler.90\n\nThe Jewish Question Because my case for a Jewish factor in ﬁlm noir obviously hinges on the Jewish identity of the émigré directors, the question naturally follows, how Jewish were they? As with questions of class, region, and personality, differences in Jewish identiﬁcation and consciousness obviously existed among the Jewish émigré noirists. Moreover, these differences shifted over time in response to circumstance, some gradually and subtly, some suddenly and starkly. The individual case studies will explore the differences in greater detail, but one can generalize about one factor: these ﬁlmmakers were raised, without exception, in nonobservant, largely secular households and remained detached from religious observance in their adult lives. Almost all married, at least somewhere along the way, non-Jewish wives (Siodmak is the lone exception). Ulmer, however, who himself converted to Christianity upon marrying his ﬁrst (non-Jewish) wife, reverted to Judaism upon marrying his second ( Jewish) wife, and became perhaps the most religiously Jewish of the group. Lang, born to a non-Jewish father and a Jewish mother who converted to Catholicism, is no doubt the most complex case. Protesting his Catholicism to his dying day yet considered a Jew by both the Nazis and his fellow émigrés, Lang lived with a Jewish woman, Lily Latté, from the time that he ﬂed Germany, and he granted her a Jewish wedding before his death. More important for the study of Jewish émigré noir, however, neither interfaith marriage nor secularism, as I can attest from my own situation and experience, necessarily implies a dearth of Jewish consciousness or commitment. Another aspect of Jewish awareness that applies to all the émigrés, and which again separates them from their immigrant coreligionists, is captured in Billy Wilder’s famous (if not necessarily original) quip that Hitler made him a Jew.91 Although the émigrés had been exposed to anti-Semitism since child-\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nhood, through personal confrontation and the pervasive anti-Jewish atmosphere, the full ramiﬁcations, individually and collectively, of Jew hatred only became evident with the rise of the Nazis. And although the existential threat, physically and ﬁnancially, was lessened once sanctuary in Los Angeles and a ﬁlm job in Hollywood had been secured, the fate of relatives or friends left behind (several of whom perished in the Holocaust) remained for many an especially fraught issue. Social interaction among the émigrés (many of whom had already known and worked with one another in Germany) in the various European-style salons that emerged in “Weimar on the Paciﬁc” reinforced a kinship now heightened by their mutual refugee status. Their common background and current predicament occasionally translated into career assistance, such as Siodmak’s help in securing Max Ophuls a directing assignment at Universal-International, and even collaboration, such as Siodmak’s story idea for Bernhardt’s ﬁlm Conﬂict. Not that the narcissism of minor differences, and the cutthroat nature of the ﬁlm business, didn’t also generate rivalry—“every refugee was jealous of the next one,” as Curtis Bernhardt put it.92 But when it came to their identities as refugee Jews, not ﬁlmmakers, the men put aside their selﬁsh interests and collaborated, most tangibly on the European Film Fund—started by the émigré community to help Jews still caught in Nazi-occupied Europe, but which also aided those who were struggling ﬁnancially in the United States, such as Ophuls in his early Hollywood years.93 The various commonalities, although certainly not canceling the differences, do encourage what R. Barton Palmer terms “a group auteurist” approach to the study of the Jewish émigré directors.94 My partial adoption of such an approach comes with full awareness of the pitfalls of auteur theory in general: namely, its tendency to downplay collaboration and to privilege intentionality at the expense of sociocultural and political economic factors. Group auteurism, however, while not eliminating these concerns, does at least offer, especially in regard to Jewish émigré noirists, a more nuanced method of addressing them. The fact that several Jewish Weimer-era actors (Curt Bois, Alexander Granach, Fritz Kortner, Reinhold Schünzel), cinematographers (Eugen Schüfftan, John Alton), set designers (Hans Dreier, Hans Jacoby), composers (Franz Waxman, Frederick Hollander, Hanns Eisler), and editors (Rudi Fehr) worked on noirs directed by Jewish émigrés actually expands, rather than contracts, the collaborative aspect. The focus on an ethnically distinct body of directors making ﬁlms of a speciﬁc type in the same movie industry at a particular historical moment also allows for an analysis that radiates outward into the larger sociocultural sphere. By combining elements of authorship, genre, ﬁlm movement, and historical analysis, the group auteurist approach thus provides a useful framework not only for the study of émigré Jewish noir, but hopefully also for the broadening and enriching of our understanding of ﬁlm noir as a whole.95\n\n2\n\nJews in Germany t o r n b e t w e e n t wo wo r l d s\n\nJews may not have invented the term “ambivalence”—its coining is credited to the non-Jewish Swiss psychoanalyst Eugen Bleuler in 1911—but their relationship to the notion of a conﬂicted self is uniquely overdetermined, both discursively and experientially. The biblical banishment of the ur-couple from paradise planted the seeds of a primal spirit/matter split, not only for Jews but for all humanity. Early Christian theologians reified the schism in the concept of original sin, Cartesian philosophers rationalized it in cogito ergo sum, and the Romantic poet Goethe gave it voice through the ﬁgure of Faust: Two souls, alas, are dwelling in my breast, And one is striving to be separate from the other. One holds, with sensual, passionate desire, Fast to the world, with clinging organs; The other rises strong from earthly mist To the ethereal realms of high ancestral spirit.1\n\nBut it would take the Jewish Freud, in shifting ambivalence’s center of gravity from the metaphorical breast to the unconscious mind, and the Jewish Kafka, in historically grounding the phenomenon in existential angst, to lay the foundation for what Jewish ﬁlmmaker Henry Bean calls “the ambivalent, self-doubting, selfhating modern condition.”2 That Freud’s and Kafka’s mother tongue was the same as Goethe’s is more than coincidental to a discussion of the phenomenological dimension of ambivalence. Jews’ “lived” relation to ambivalence expanded exponentially among modern German-speaking peoples, both in regard to non-Jewish Germans and among Jews themselves. The eighteenth-century Jewish enlightenment, or Haskalah, although indebted to the larger European Enlightenment, emerged and found its greatest affinity in Germany. Christian dramatist Gottfried Lessing’s philo-Semitic play Die Juden (The Jews, 1749) literally set the stage for the Haskalah, which Lessing’s friend, Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, carried to fruition.3 Together with Jewish disciples Hartwig Wessely and David Friedländer, and with the continued non-Jewish support of Lessing and Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, Mendelssohn succeeded in opening the doors of German 22\n\nJews in Germany\n\n23\n\nsociety to Jews and in coaxing them out of their ghettos and into the world of western culture. The Haskalah could not have achieved its full cultural and political purpose, however, without the radical social transformation that the general Enlightenment (and its progeny, the French Revolution) set in motion. Although Hapsburg Kaiser Joseph II’s Edict of Toleration in 1781 granted Jews freedom of movement and residence within the Austro-Hungarian domain, the nascent French Republic in 1791 was the ﬁrst national government to grant equal rights to Jews. A few German cities followed suit in 1798, and Prussia as a whole, under Napoleonic pressure, ofﬁcially freed its Jews in 1812, though the laws were annulled as part of the anti-Jewish reaction to Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The revolutions of 1848 brought with them full legal equality for Jews in Austria, but in Germany Jews didn’t become equal citizens until the uniﬁed German state was proclaimed, under Prussian auspices and with Berlin as the new capital, in 1871.4 Even then, Jews remained excluded from the military, the courts, the state bureaucracy, and, except for the less established academic ﬁelds, from the universities as well. Complete Jewish emancipation in Germany, de jure and de facto, wouldn’t be achieved until the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and then also, of course, not without contention.5 Given the comparatively recent and extremely short period of Jewish entry into German-speaking culture and society, and the substantial obstacles that Jews continued to face during this period, their accomplishments, especially in the cultural arena, are all the more remarkable—though also partly explicable. Similar to the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, where restrictions in the established professions shunted many immigrant Jews into the ﬂedgling mass media and popular entertainment forms of the larger cities, marginalized German Jews gravitated to “the free professions” and “the less organized alternative public spheres that characterize urban life, such as the newspaper, the journal, the art gallery, the café, the theater, and the political group.”6 The reference to the city here is key, for as with the massive immigrant wave that carried eastern European Jews to burgeoning U.S. metropolises, emancipated German Jews who ﬂocked to the fast-growing national capital were, as far as modern culture was concerned, at the right place at the right time. From 1871 to 1905, a stretch that corresponds with the ascendancy of mass media and modern art, Berlin’s population more than doubled to over two million.7 The Jewish population, which had begun the nineteenth-century urbanization process before most other Germans, saw their portion of the Berlin population double over the same period as well, to about eighty thousand.8 Further statistical analysis, however, reasserts the remarkable nature of Jewish cultural achievement. The Jewish percentage of the Berlin population never rose above 4 percent, and nationally it held steady at a little less than 1 percent.9 Yet the impact of turn-of-the-century Berlin Jews on the creation and dissemination\n\n24\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\nof modern art, literature, theater, and ﬁlm was enormous. Few could contradict non-Jewish journal editor Ferdinand Avenarius’s philo-Semitic claim, in 1912, that Jews dominated modern German culture. Berlin’s press and theater, Avenarius noted, were virtual Jewish monopolies, and its musical life “would be unthinkable without the Jews.” German literature and poetry, meanwhile, seemed “to be passing into Jewish hands,” and the art world also was increasingly becoming a Jewish domain.10 Of course not all cultural observers, much less the general public, viewed Jews’ cultural inﬂuence as favorably as did Avenarius. Here a comparison with an analogous situation in the United States is instructive, more for the differences than the similarities. Although Jewish enrollment quotas at some major American universities began in the 1910s, public complaints about Jewish “overrepresentation” in the cultural sphere extended mainly to the Hollywood movie industry, a “low” cultural form whose world prominence and Jewish dominance was only realized after World War I. German disaffection with Jewish cultural involvement, at least initially, applied mainly to high culture, and was evident well before the war. As early as 1821, a scant two decades since emancipation, fears of Jewish domination “in the cultural worlds of literature and journalism were voiced.”11 By the 1830s, anti-Jewish sentiment was directed at the “new Jews”—the modern Jewish intellectuals who had converted to Christianity yet were regarded as interlopers, who “do not belong to any state,” who “roam the world like adventurers,” and who ﬂocked to Berlin because they thrived in “mechanical” rather than “organic” situations.12 In 1850 Richard Wagner penned his infamous indictment of Jewish intellectualism, Judaism in Music. Wagner’s anti-Jewish animus was aimed speciﬁcally at the modern Jewish artist, whose cultural enterprise (as practitioner and patron) “was linked to the commercialization of culture and its concomitant vulgarization.” And Wagnerian-style anti-Semitism would only intensify in the Wilhelmine period (1871–1918) with the rise of industrial capitalism, political liberalism, and popular culture.13\n\nWilhelmine Jews: Parvenus and Pariahs Historian Werner Sombart, a leading anti-Jewish critic in the years leading up to World War I, provided “anthropological” grounding for Wagner’s critique. Drawing on Orientalist associations that would color later American attacks on the Jewish studio “moguls” (evident in the sobriquet itself ), Sombart, in 1912, alleged that Jews’ nomadic roots encouraged both material avariciousness and insatiable intellectual curiosity. The intellectuality, however, owing to its nurturance in the shiftless desert sands, tended toward superﬁciality, and its derivation in nomadic adaptability inclined it toward excessive empathy. Superﬁciality and empathy, meanwhile, predisposed Jews “to excel in journalism, jurisprudence, and theater—the three most distinctive and, to [Sombart’s] mind, most troubling expressions of urban culture.”14 Virulently anti-Semitic publicist Philip Stauff,\n\nJews in Germany\n\n25\n\nfocusing on the art world, dispensed with analytical niceties in attacking the “alien element” of the Jewish dealers, critics, and painters (such as Paul Cassirer, Alfred Kerr, and Max Lieberman), “who are strangers in our land and to our blood, [and yet] who stand today at the apex of the ﬁne arts.”15 Countering the campaign against Jewish cultural inﬂuence, Jewish literary scholar Moritz Goldstein published an article in Avenarius’s prestigious cultural review Der Kunstwart in 1912. Titled “The German-Jewish Parnassus,” the article goes to the heart of the ambivalence being thrust on German Jews in their move from ghetto pariah to torchbearer of the avant-garde: We Jews are administering the spiritual property of a nation that denies our right and our ability to do so. . . . Among ourselves we have the impression that we speak as Germans to Germans—such is our impression. But though we may after all feel totally German, the others feel us to be totally un-German. We may now be called Max Reinhardt and have inspired the [German] stage to unanticipated revival, or as a Hugo von Hoffmannstahl introduced a new poetic style to replace the exhausted style of Schiller; we may call this German, but the others call it Jewish; they detect in us something “Asiatic” and miss the German sensibility, and should they—reluctantly—feel obliged to acknowledge our achievement, they wish we would achieve less.16\n\nGoldstein’s lament over Jews’ lack of full acceptance as Germans has obtained, with historical hindsight, more than a touch of irony. At the time, and since, however, not all Jews, or non-Jews, took such rejection by the “host” culture as necessarily “bad for the Jews.” The moniker Grenzjuden (border Jews), for example, became a popular code word to describe Jews’ perceived straddling of the boundaries between cultures. Living in such a limbo state, sociologist Georg Simmel argued in his 1908 essay “Der Fremde” (The stranger), laid the basis for the cosmopolitan, universalizing outlook of the urban intellectual, of which Jews were considered the prime exponents.17 Himself regarded as the typical Berlin Jewish intellectual despite his parents’ conversion to Christianity before his birth, Simmel held that the modern “stranger’s” lack of commitment “to the unique ingredients and peculiar tendencies of the group” made him “freer, practically and theoretically; he surveys conditions with less prejudice; his criteria for them are more general and more objective ideals; he is not tied down in his action and habit, piety, precedent.”18 American social critic Thorstein Veblen offered support for Simmel’s view. In a 1919 essay, Veblen suggested that the German Jews who had attained “intellectual pre-eminence in Modern Europe”19 owed much of their innovative, iconoclastic spirit to living “at the margins between cultures.”20 The “ingrained skepticism” derived from Jews’ status as simultaneous insiders and outsiders “induced a lingering cognitive\n\n26\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\ndissonance, an abiding irreverence that allowed them to assume a position at the forefront of modern inquiry and imagination.”21 Both philo- and anti-Semites, then, whether from their perception of an innate or a more recently evolved Jewish sensibility, located a propensity for modernist thinking in Jews’ marginalized status vis-à-vis mainstream society. Another contributing factor, however, can be assigned to Jews’ marginalization from their own Jewishness, a self-imposed estrangement that was not only a precipitator but also a by-product of modernism. As Emily Bilski suggests, Jews’ attraction to modernism was “itself a new expression of new possibilities available to Jews in postemancipation Germany, and . . . their embracing the new art constituted a rejection of tradition that was also a declaration of emancipation from the bonds of Judaism and the Jewish community.”22 Indeed, such a “double marginalization” (from both Jewish and German traditions), Isaac Deutscher proposed in his 1958 essay “The Non-Jewish Jew,” gave Jews an “epistemological advantage” that spurred some of the boldest thought of the modern age. “Marx, Freud, Trotsky, and Rosa Luxemburg” had in common “that the very conditions in which they lived and worked did not allow them to reconcile themselves to ideas which were nationally or religiously limited and enabled them to strive for a universal Weltanschauung.”23 But these conceptual advantages came at a psychological cost: a painfully dual identity, both as Germans and as Jews. Jews’ rejection as not fully German was a particularly bitter pill to swallow. Emancipated German Jews had been among the greatest champions of Enlightenment German culture and its liberal cosmopolitan perspective, partly because liberal humanism served as a gateway to bourgeois respectability and acceptance, but also because of their genuine belief in and admiration for these ideals’ aesthetic and ethical value.24 Indeed, Kultur (culture) and Bildung (education), with their presumption of a shared humanity and a quality of spirit based in a “quest for the good, the true, and the beautiful,” became the equivalent of a new Jewish religion.25 Kant, Goethe, and Schiller became the new prophets, universities the new shuls, and Jewish artists and intellectuals the new “meta rabbis.”26 Deutschtum (Germanness) and Judentum ( Jewishness) had merged into a whole gloriously greater than the sum of its parts—so thought assimilated German Jews. Not to be accepted as equals by their non-Jewish countrymen was therefore deeply frustrating, hurtful, and troubling. Additional discontent, if also liberation, stemmed from assimilated Jews’ disconnect from their fellow Jews—particularly those from the ghettos of their own not-so-distant past, whose ranks were being reﬁlled by immigrants and refugees from the shtetls of Russia and eastern Europe. Not only had these generally impoverished Ostjuden not experienced emancipation, but they would be driven in huge numbers into Germany, and a large portion eventually onward to the United States, by the pogroms that followed Tsar Alexander II’s assassination in 1881. Even before this massive inﬂux, assimilating German Jews were encouraged to view ghetto life, on whose renunciation their own emancipation was\n\nJews in Germany\n\n27\n\npredicated, with loathing, dread, and disgust. This Jewish revulsion toward “their own” was facilitated by strong anti-ghetto sentiment within mainstream Enlightenment humanism. 27 The German intelligentsia, not to mention the average German, viewed the ghetto as a repository of religious fanaticism, economic parasitism, cultural barbarism, and material squalor; and its inhabitants were seen as physically disgusting and morally contemptible. 28 Even the personal traits of ghetto rabbis, according to Goethe, consisted of “fanatic zeal . . . repulsive enthusiasm . . . wild gesticulations . . . confused murmurings . . . piercing outcries . . . effeminate movements . . . the queerness of ancient nonsense.”29 Jewish poet Heinrich Heine concurred, calling the ghetto “a dreadful monument of the Middle Ages.”30 Ostjuden were thus both an embarrassment and a threat to German Jews, given the latter group’s newly achieved yet only partially realized and still precarious assimilation. The insecurity and concomitant sense of superiority further fueled antagonism between the “Cravats” and the “Caftans,” as the Westjuden and Ostjuden, based on their contrasting dress styles (and class statuses), were called. Yet in sharing “the general distaste for the ghetto” and participating in “Othering” the Ostjude, Westjuden also renounced both their own past and a part of themselves, thereby compounding the internalized ambivalence and selfhatred generated by their own stubbornly second-class status within mainstream German society.31 Nothing demonstrates this double consciousness more than German Jews’ reaction to the pogrom-driven immigrant wave of the 1880s. In coming to the aid of their ﬂeeing Russian brothers, German Jews’ compassion “was not feigned,” Steven Aschheim suggests: “Social distance, cultural disparity, and political disenfranchisement served to reinforce rather than diminish the German Jewish sense of responsibility for the Ostjuden.” But at the same time, although German Jews, just as their assimilated American Jewish counterparts, “wanted to help the East European Jews and alleviate their plight . . . nobody wanted them in his own country.”32 In Germany, the situation was exacerbated, compared to the United States, by the lack of an “ideology of ethnic and political pluralism” and, more ominously, by the beginnings of scientiﬁc racism and organized Jew hatred (labeled, for the ﬁrst time in the 1870s, “anti-Semitism”).33 Although the rise in anti-Semitism was directed at the liberalism and capitalism associated with the German Jew as much as at the barbarity and depravity connected to the Ostjude, many German Jews, whether from self-hatred or self-preservation, pointed to Ostjuden as the source of the alarming trend.34\n\nOstjuden/Westjuden: Brothers and Strangers German anti-Semitism in its various guises, like emancipation before it, generated varied and conflicting responses among German Jews. Although the emancipation pact permitted Jews to retain their religious afﬁliation, it also\n\n28\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\ndictated that overt expressions of Jewishness—in dress, speech, and ritual—be restricted to the private sphere. The slogan, “A Jew at home, a gentleman on the street” describes, with some irony, the separation of public and private selves. What it fails to capture is the intense emotional conﬂict provoked by the imposed social division, or its perceived and actual relationship to material well-being. Moses Mendelssohn himself had struggled mightily, and against intense outside pressure, to “sustain within himself a two-fold spiritual bond” by embracing both enlightened German humanism and religious Judaism.35 His grandson, however, the musical prodigy Felix Mendelssohn, would be baptized. Heinrich Heine converted to Christianity later in life, as did Karl Marx’s father (like Georg Simmel’s parents) before his son’s birth.36 An estimated two-thirds of intellectual Jews converted during the nineteenth century; for them, as for other Jews seeking to overcome obstacles to career advancement, conversion was seen as a solution to the “Jewish problem” up to and including the Weimar period.37 A compromise approach, although no less anathema to traditional Jews, was the establishment of a Jewish religious denomination more compatible with modernity. Reform Judaism, which “eliminated all those beliefs, rites, ceremonies and practices it deemed anachronistic and in disharmony with modern thought,” first took root in Berlin and Kassel in 1815 and quickly spread throughout Germany and to other countries with assimilated Jewish communities.38 Still other Jews eschewed both conversion and, like Deutscher’s non-Jewish Jews, religious afﬁliation altogether, yet retained a sense of Jewish identity from broadly humanistic or progressive political ideals. As the tide of anti-Semitism swelled in the late 1800s, two vastly different, often clashing Jewish movements arose to confront the worsening situation (as well as the overall crisis of liberalism). The majority of German Jews, “mainly well-established members of the prosperous middle-class,” continued along a staunchly assimilationist course. Organizing themselves into the Central Society of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, known as the Centralverein or CV, this mainstream group remained dedicated to “the ideals of liberalism and the Enlightenment.”39 Another, much smaller, but impassioned group of students, artists, and intellectuals advocated something far more radical: “a ‘new beginning,’ a return to nature, and a rejection of bourgeois values.”40 The latter movement, proclaimed the “Jewish Renaissance” in 1901 by one of its key ﬁgures, Martin Buber, was an offshoot of the ﬂedgling Zionist movement that “sought to create a synthesis between Zionism, Jewish tradition, and modernity.”41 The Jewish Renaissance, however, had a quite different view of early twentiethcentury modernity. Drawing inspiration from avant-garde bohemianism and the “youth revolt” that proposed a merging of art and life, the Jewish Renaissance found itself at odds with political Zionism’s bourgeois-liberal belief in a separation of culture and politics. Meeting in cafés, engaging in artistic pursuits, and\n\nJews in Germany\n\n29\n\ncirculating ideas via journals such as Die Kommenden (The up-and-comers) and Ost und West (East and West), the “cultural Zionists,” as they came to be called, were concerned as much with establishing a new Jewish sensibility as a new Jewish homeland. Perhaps their boldest stroke was their rapprochement with eastern European Jewish culture and an attempted bridging of the Ostjude/ Westjude divide. The East was seen as contributing “a Jewish tradition that had remained authentic and vital,” whereas the West would add “its vibrant and modern mores and values.”42 The political Zionists also made eastern European Jewry the cornerstone of their project; indeed, the proposed securing of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was, until the First World War, seen largely as a sanctuary for the unemancipated and impoverished Ostjude. This philanthropic project still essentially privileged modern western consciousness, however, and left the philo-Ostjude Zionist “with an old ambivalence in a new disguise.”43 For assimilationist German Jews, the Zionist rehabilitation of the Ostjude compounded their own intra-ethnic conﬂict. Demeaning attitudes and discriminatory actions against the Ostjude, which assimilationist Jews in large part supported and even spearheaded, already violated their liberal principles; and reminders of the “authenticity and vitality” of an eastern European culture they had repudiated—be it voluntarily, opportunistically, or under duress—only exacerbated their sense of guilt and shame. 44 Eventually, as anti-Semitism increased and cultural and political Zionism radicalized in the post-1910 period, assimilationist Jews’ unreconstructed self-hatred spilled over onto the Zionists, whose Jewish-nationalist sympathies had always been resented as antiliberal and misguided and who now also were “identiﬁed with Ostjudentum both in clientele and ideological spirit.”45 Such intra-ethnic division both clashed and resonated with a larger, more positive Jewish-based ambivalence that cultural Zionist leader Buber identiﬁed and propounded in his Drei Reden über das Judentum (Three talks on Judaism) of 1909–1910. In these inﬂuential lectures, Buber spoke of a particular Jewish “sensibility” grounded in “the situation of being torn between two worlds,” with a capacity for deep spiritual experience, suffering, and compassion—“all of this preﬁgured in the ‘pathos of the prophets.’”46 “Whoever confronts the pathos of his inner struggles,” Buber stated, “will discover that something continues to live within him having its great, primeval national image in the struggle of the prophets against the diverging multitude of the people’s drives.”47 Going Deutscher one better, Buber thereby located a basis for radical thought, action, and creativity that stemmed from both a marginalization from mainstream society and a centeredness within Jewish tradition. Moreover, and of particular genealogical interest to the Jewish émigré directors, Buber’s emphasis on pathos found cultural expression in a group of mainly Jewish avant-garde artists calling themselves Die Pathetiker (The solemn ones). Emerging from the Expressionist movement, which emphasized intense\n\n30\n\nd r i v e n t o da r k n e s s\n\ninternal experience and affected all the arts in the prewar period, Die Pathetiker gave the “ecstatic-pathetic” character of their work the highest value, “valorizing both deep spiritual experience and heroic posture—the ‘pathetic’ artist portrayed as tragic seer or prophet without honor.”48\n\nWorld War I: Coming Together/Splitting Apart World War I caused the various strands within German Jewry to lay their differences aside, at least initially. United against an enemy in the Russian tsar whose tyrannical regime posed a triple threat—to the German nation, liberal values, and Jewish existence—German Jews of all persuasions found, however brieﬂy, common cause. The internal and external rifts between Jews and their fellow non-Jewish Germans also tended to subside temporarily as the country banded together in support of what seemed, to Jew and non-Jew alike, a just war. As long as the war went well, which it did for the ﬁrst year, the detente generally held. With a downturn in Germany’s fortunes in 1915, however, came a commensurate collapse of the tenuous domestic pact. Renewed conﬂict between Jew and Jew, and Jew and German, was waged, like the war itself, on an eastern and a western front. Yet while the issues remained the same—anti-Semitism, Zionism, and how to deal with the Ostjuden—the discourse around them became more volatile and politicized. Firsthand contact with eastern ghetto and shtetl Jews, as well as a large inﬂux of Ostjuden refugees into Germany, “brought home” the Ostjudenfrage (eastern Jew question) in the starkest terms. The sense of difference, between Ost- and Westjude and between German Jew and non-Jew, heightened; views on how to address this difference, among German Jews and anti-Semites, radicalized. Assimilationist Jews advocated more strongly than ever the westernizing of their eastern cousins; Zionists constructed a hyper-romanticized “cult of the Ostjuden”; anti-Semites revived the specter, ﬁrst raised in the 1880s, of an eastern Jewish “invasion.”49 The AntiSemites’ Petition of 1881—calling for the cessation of alien Jewish immigration and signed by 250,000 Germans but never enacted into law—was resurrected in the Grenzschluss (border closing) appeals of 1915. Demonstrating the perceived threat that a ﬂood of Ostjuden into Germany posed to German Jews themselves, many actually supported the Grenzschluss. Even before it became ofﬁcial policy in 1918, however, German Jews had come to realize the futility of separating their interests from those of the Ostjuden. The Judenzählung ( Jewish census) of 1916 was a hugely disillusioning event for German Jews. Ostensibly aimed at quieting allegations that Jews were shirking military duty, the census was insulting enough for a group that been among the most patriotic supporters of the war effort. But when the army refused to release data showing that Jews were serving in equal levels to other Germans, German Jews “experienced a profound sense of betrayal. It was as if the bubble of German-Jewish symbiosis had been burst.”50 The slight was\n\nJews in Germany\n\n31\n\nmore than personal; the Judenzählung and the Grenzschluss were the ﬁrst signs in twentieth-century Germany of political support for anti-Semitism. Jew hatred had, once again, become respectable.51 Yet rather than bringing the various German Jewish factions together, as had the onset of the war, the latest rising tide of anti-Semitism widened the ﬁssures between them. Assimilationist Jews increasingly, though not exclusively, scapegoated the Ostjuden, berated the Zionists, or converted as a means of entering the German fold; Zionists, for whom the Judenzählung and Grenzschluss demonstrated conclusively that Jews were doomed to second-class citizenship in Germany, now saw a homeland in Palestine as a necessary refuge not only for Ostjuden but for all Jews. Philosopher Franz Rosenzweig, the father of postwar Jewish renewal, proposed a “third way”: one that renounced neither Judentum nor Deutschtum but reinstated the essentialist integrity of both while maintaining a dialectical relation between the two. Unlike Moses Mendelssohn’s attempted reconciliation of Judentum with Deutschtum while keeping the two spheres separate, Rosenzweig’s goal was to recenter Judaism and reintegrate Jewish thinking into western culture. For Mendelssohn, the “and” between German and Jew did not suggest “any coordination, or covalescence.” Mendelssohn may have been the ﬁrst enlightened German Jew, Rosenzweig conceded, but he was, by his own admission, not “a uniﬁed human being . . . not one person but two.”52 Rosenzweig’s dialectical approach promised a synthesis of a higher order, one that would overcome Mendelssohn’s dilemma and rectify the shortcomings of Jewish liberalism. Learning to be a German and a Jew, Rosenzweig reasoned, “was the challenge inherently posed by the Enlightenment and Emancipation.” German Jews did indeed have “a dual destiny,” but it need not tear them apart. Jews were a “metahistorical community,” which placed them “simultaneously within and beyond culture, within and beyond time.”53 Zweistromland (Land of two rivers) was the title of the book that Rosenzweig devoted to this transcendent principle. The title’s metaphorical association, ﬁttingly, was to ancient Babylon—“whe"
