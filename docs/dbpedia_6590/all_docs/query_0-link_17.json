LIPPERT Executive Producer ALL PRODUCTIONS RELEASED BY 20TH CENTURY-FOX BAROMETER Section By AL STEEN OU’VE heard about Monday morn- ing quarterbacks — the football enthusiasts who gather around on Mondays to discuss the previous Satur- day’s grid games and toss out their opinions as to how the plays should have been called. But you don’t hear much about Friday morning quarter- backs for obvious reasons. DIFFICULT YEAR TO FORECAST As a Monday morning quarterback for the film industry, it would be easy to rake 1960 over the coals and point out what was done and what should have been done. But anybody who thinks he can be a Friday morning quarterback for the current year in this business is more than a genius be- cause 1961 shapes up as more of an enigma than almost any year in recent industry history. Why? Well, let’s take a look at the drawing board. We can start off with pay television. With Telemeter fairly well entrenched in a Toronto suburb and the formation of the British syndicate to launch the medium in England, the company has laid the groundwork for the U. S. debut in Little Rock, Ark., and, at this writing, negotiations have started with the Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. for the use of its lines. And the Federal Communications Commission has given Zenith Radio Co. and RKO-General the go-ahead signal for a test of their Phonevision over-the-air system in Hartford, Conn. Meanwhile, exhibition, through the Joint Committee Against Pay TV, has started to bombard Congressmen with pleas for support and for bills calling for the outlawing of pay television of any kind, whether by cable or by air. BITTER LOBBYING MANEUVERS What does this all add up to? A two- prong drive by each faction for Con- gressional and public favor and probably one of the bitterest lobbying maneuvers that Washington has seen in a long time. Exhibition, through the Joint Committee, has done a commendable job, but, remember, the other side has barely started yet. It has millions to spend for lobbying and advertising its story to the public. Neither side has the advantage yet, despite 22,000,000 op- ponents’ signatures. There can be no Friday morning quarterbacking on this all-important issue. And, if exhibitors want to fight it and lick it, they are going to have to carry the ball alone. Distribution and production have too much at stake to take sides. How about censorship in 1961? Well, that is an issue on which all segments of the industry agree. It’s going to be a tough fight, especially in view of the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Chicago Times Film case. Prior to the decision, only a handful of states of- fered threats of possible censorship legislation, but now, Chicago-type or- dinances could mushroom. Exhibition and the most ardent opponents of cen- sorship among laymen appear to be of the opinion that the only way to avoid censorship is to remove the cause of its necessity. And that is to lower the boom on violence and sex in picture themes plus a stricter adherence to the purposes of the Production Code. It is a pretty safe prediction that something along those lines will be accomplished this year. The trend will be to convince the public and the legislators, state, city and national, that the industry has become conscious of the needs for firmer self- regulation and that from now on, censorship by law will be unnecessary. That plan is in the formative stage. It has a good chance of maturing in 1961 because, if it doesn’t, past censorship laws will look tame in comparison. BATTLE OF ALLIED FACTIONS What’s with exhibitor organizations? It would take more than an amateur crystal ball-gazer or even a Saturday morning quarterback to foresee the sit- uation as it might be at the yearend. We can eliminate Theatre Owners of America in this commentary because there appears to be no problem in that camp. But the year started off with the once all-powerful Allied States Ass’n still hanging on the ropes, split by rebels and loyalists. At press time, the rebels were seeking to set up a new organization, while the loyalists were fighting to keep the association intact. Will there be a third national exhibitor association if the rebels carry out their threat? Or would it be a regional organ- ization as a starter? Both sides are vulnerable to overtures from TOA but it is doubtful if that organization would make the first move, even though there have been some underground rumblings that something was cooking between TOA and Allied and/or some of the latter’s units. On the other hand, the new Allied regime under Marshall Fine and Milton London appears determined to write a new chapter in Allied history with constructive new policies. The present status and future of the American Congress of Exhibitors are riddles at the moment. ACE has been a target for criticism among some ex- hibitors because of its apparent lack of accomplishments. Many of its projects were put aside in order to concentrate on the establishment of a structure for the financing, and possible production, of motion pictures. S. H. Fabian, its first chairman, retired from the post after considerable work getting the plan under way. The prospectus will go to the SEC soon. The question is whether ACE will have the time and manpower to go ahead with its other aims, such as trade practices and amending the consent decrees, after the production project has been launched. With Sol Schwartz’s resignation as president of RKO Thea- tres to become an executive of Columbia Pictures, he automatically abdicated his role as ACE chairman, a post to which he had been elected shortly before his resignation. A successor had not been selected at press time. It is true that if ACE is successful in helping to relieve the product shortage, it will have made a big contribution. But it will have to do more to justify its existence as a service to exhibitors on other matters and fulfill the purposes for which it was founded. The industry is looking to ACE for action this year. WORK IS CUT OUT FOR COMPO The Council of Motion Picture Organ- izations has a busy year and its work already is cut out for it. It will concern itself with censorship, the wages and hours legislation, press relations and the so-called Ben Marcus business- building plan among other projects. This year will see the start of produc- tion by Pathe -America, a TOA-spon- sored project designed to place more pictures on the market. The first pic- ture, “The Deadly Companions,” already is in work and more are to follow. Some skeptics thought the plan never would get off the ground, but in less than six months after it first was discussed, the cameras were rolling. While Pathe-America’s contribution might be considered only a drop in the bucket, it could be a mighty big drop. The Hollywood production forecast for the year — from major companies, that is — does not go beyond 175 pictures, far less than theatre requirements. There have been promises of more but exhibitors have their doubts. On the technical side, the only inno- vation on the horizon is 20th Century- Fox’s Grandeur 70 in which the com- pany is releasing “The King and I.” This improvement on the original Grandeur process of 1929-30, plus the development of wide-film, widescreen in more recent years, could have an im- pact and increase the number of thea- tres now equipped for wide-film pres- entations. ALL OLD POTENTIALS PRESENT This new year has all the potentials of past years. It will only be a matter of taking advantage of the potentials and striving to stay on an even keel. Most exhibitors are resigned to the fact that they can’t keep the post- 1948 li- braries away from television, a night- marish thought a year ago. Without being optimistic or pessi- mistic, it stands to reason that this new year will be exactly what exhibitors make of it. They will stand or fall by the opportunities offered. But, like every year in this business, it will be exciting. BOXOFFICE 9 By IVAN SPEAR W HEN, back in 1933, the late, great Franklin D. Roosevelt as- cended to the presidency of a depressed United States, he assured a frightened and harassed citizenry that it had nothing to fear but fear itself. A somewhat comparable admonition might be directed at a slightly confused motion picture industry as concerns its 1961 prospects, if — and it is a signifi- cantly big IF — those who produce, dis- tribute and exhibit film fare remember and dedicate themselves anew to the proposition that the theatrical screen is still the backbone of the trade. Ob- viously the immediate problem bearing on this remembrance and dedication is for the manufacturers of features to in- tensify their efforts to supply the na- tion’s movie theatres with material that cannot be pirated or imitated by tele- vision. MANY FACTORS TO CONSIDER There are so many factors that enter into the makeup of the aforementioned “if” that it renders more difficult than usual the annual chore of trying to prognosticate, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, what is to be available by way of product to run-o’-mill theatre operators. One indication probably can be embraced from scratch, namely, the assumption that Hollywood will produce few, if any, more pictures for conven- tional distribution during 1961 than it did in 1960. An entire article of this type could be devoted to the wind- straws — all of which have been pre- viously reported — that justify such an assumption. A BREAK FOR EXHIBITORS Despite which probable status quo of film fabrication, theatre operators are in line for at least one break. Many of the most costly productions of the past two — in some cases three — years should be available for regular bookings and runs during the year just getting un- derway. These are the mastodons of budgets and casts that spent varied portions of 1960 and early 1961 as roadshow attractions and, resultantly, have been available to theatres in com- paratively few cities. Many, if not all, of them will hit the conventional ex- hibition trail some time during 1961 and their universal availability could well prove a substantial element in alleviating the product shortage that bedeviled many showmen during 1960. Moreover, they are articles of proven money-gamering potentialities, inten- sively publicized and automatically on the long-standing, must-see lists of mil- lions of theatre patrons who, for geo- graphical or economic limitations, were unable to patronize them while they were on two-a-day, metropolitan dis- play. They include such titans of enter- tainment as John Wayne’s “The Ala- mo,” Otto Preminger’s “Exodus,” both being distributed by United Artists; George Sidney’s “Pepe,” which bears the Columbia x-eleasing label; Dore Schax-y’s “Sunrise at Campobello,” a Warner Bros.’s picture; Kirk Douglas’ “Spar- tacus,” being distxibuted by Universal- International; and “Can-Can,” being released by 20th Century-Fox. There is even a possibility — pei-haps a remote one — that Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer’s mighty “Ben-Hur” may be available in a few selected regular-run situations ex-e ’61 comes to an end. And to magnify the average exhibi- tor’s good break is the certainty that thei'e ai - e to be fewer roadshow attrac- tions rolling off of Hollywood’s assembly lines during 1961. Several blueprinted pictures give every promise of being as good and as big as some that wei’e given the hard-ticket treatment, but the rash of roadshows is undisputedly on the de- cline. That’s probably because some producers and distributors were finan- cially damaged by their eagerness to get aboard the reserved-seat, increased- taxiffs bandwagon which was permitted to roll at a precedential and overall- revenue-threatening speed during 1960. HARD-TICKET PICTURES True, there will be some hard-ticket entries in the 1961 pi’oduct lineup, but they will be relatively limited. Candi- dates for the exalted approach include remakes by MGM of a pair of memor- able and highly-profitable hit of yester- year. They are “Mutiny on the Bounty” and “Four Horsemen of the Apoca- lypse.” The former will star Marlon Brando, Trevor Howard and Hugh Griffith, and is being produced by Aaron Rosenberg in color and Ultra- Panavision, directed by Sir Caxol Reed and written by Eric Ambler and Charles Lederer for the screen from the novel by James Norman Hall and Charles Nordhoff. “Horsemen,” in Cinemascope and color, stars Glenn Ford, Ingrid Thulin, Charles Boyer, Paul Lukas, Yvette Mimieux and Paul Henreid. Julian Blaustein will produce and Vin- cente Minnelli direct from a scx-een- play by Robert Ardrey and John Gay, based on the famous classic by Vincent Blasco Ibanez. At Allied Artists there is much talk about the possibility of having “El Cid” debut on a roadshow basis. If this be- comes an actuality, it will be the first time that an AA picture will be so gloxified; and it might be reported, parenthetically, that AA will distribute “El Cid” only in the Western Hemis- phei-e. It was produced in Spain by Samuel Bi'onston for his own produc- tion company, starring Charlton Hes- ton, Sophia Loren and helmed by Anthony Mann. Photographed in Tech- nicolor and Super Technirama 70, the screenplay was penned by Philip Yor- dan. OTHER HARD-TICKET ENTRIES Other forthcoming features that might conceivably be slated for hard- ticket treatment for 20th Century-Fox’s “Cleopatra,” which Walter Wanger is set to produce abroad in DeLuxe Color and Todd-AO, with Joseph Mankiewicz handling megaphone chores, and Eliza- beth Taylor, Stephen Boyd and Peter Finch toplined; Columbia’s “The Guns of Navarone,” in Eastman Color lensed in Greece by producer Carl Foreman, who also wrote the screenplay based on the novel by Alistair MacLean. J. Lee Thompson directed actors Gregox-y Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn. While it cei’tainly will not be com- pleted — much less released — during 1961, no roundup of forthcoming road- shows would be complete without men- tion of producer - director George Stevens’ “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” which celluloid version of the life of Christ is still in its fonnative stages but about which 20th Century- Fox, which will distribute the pi’omised colossus, is already beating the tocsin. Stevens will produce and direct the mastodon in color, possibly in the Todd-AO process, from a screenplay by Ivan Moffat. MORE RELIGIOUS FILMS There will be a sprinkling of other religious pictures. Among them Mighty Metro’s “King of Kings,” another Sam- uel Bi'onston Productions, three years in preparation and filming. The spectacle stars Jeffrey Hunter, Siobhan McKen- na, Hurd Hatfield, Viveca Lindfors, Rita Gam and Robert Ryan in a screenplay written by Philip Yoi'dan, dii'ected by Nicholas Ray and produced by Bronston in Technirama 70 process and color. Pax-amount has “Dear and Glorious Physician” (the inspiring story of St. Luke), which Henry Blanke will pro- duce.

A.

THE CENSORSHIP THREAT Upon how black become the threat- ening clouds of renewed and heightened censorship — at many legislative and re- ligious levels — will depend on Holly- wood's ability to supply the theatrical screen with material which cannot be channeled into video. Such material might be classified as the four “S’s” — sin, sex, sensationalism and spectacle. The first three are barred from televi- sion because they might offend the tender eyes and ears of the young fry who are wont to turn on the living room idiot-boxes the moment they have fin- ished their dinners. Spectacle is ruled out because the postage-stamp size of TV screens cannot possibly do it full justice. Grouping together the sin, sex and sensationalism, there is promise that the production capital will go as far as it can in view of the above-mentioned mentoring threats. The patronage and popularity accorded adult pictures of 1960 — such as MGM’s “Butterfield 8,” and “Go Naked in the World”; Para- mount’s “The World of Suzie Wong,” 20th Century-Fox’s “From the Terrace” and Warner Bros.’ “Girl of the Night”— in itself is sufficient reason for the film-fabricators to give all possible consideration to features that treat with prostitution, adultery, implied incest, narcotics and other subjects that but a few short years ago were rigidly ver- boten by the Production Code. ON ADULTS-ONLY THEMES In any event, there are several pic- tures on the 1961 agenda that are prob- able to attract for-adult-only ratings. At 20th Century-Fox, producer Jerry Wald finally got around to making “Re- turn to Peyton Place,” in Cinemascope and Color, which stars Carol Lynley, Eleanor Parker, Robert Sterling and Tuesday Weld. Jose Ferrer directed from a script by Harry Brown and Ron Alexander, based on Grace Metalious’ tome. Under Universal-International’s releasing banner is “The Grass Is Greener,” toplining Cary Grant, De- borah Kerr, Jean Simmons and Robert Mitchum in Hugh and Margaret Wil- liams’ screen treatment of their sensa- tional London stageplay. Stanley Donen produced and directed for Grandon Productions. To be filmed by The Mirisch Co. for United Artists’ release is John O’Hara’s best seller anent a sex-oriented wom- an, “A Rage to Live.” Wendell Mayes has written the script for producer Wal- ter Mirisch. Out Culver City way, pro- ducer Julian Blaustein will put “Lady L.” before the cameras for MGM, star- ring Gina Lollobrigida and Tony Curtis. The Romain Gary yarn, scripted by Robert Anderson, will be megged by George Cukor and treats with a great English lady whose past is definitely shady. That doesn’t mean that all-is-sweet- ness-and-light themes are being entire- ly discarded. At Walt Disney’s studio, where nothing but wholesomeness grows, they have completed for Buena Vista release “The Absent Minded Pro- fessor,” toplining Fred MacMurray. Nancy Olson and Tommy Kirk. Disney produced in association with Bill Walsh, who also penned the screenplay from Samuel W. Taylor’s story. Robert Stev- enson directed. And Associated Pro- ducers, Inc. (that’s the outfit headed by Robert L. Lippert and whose size- able output is distributed by 20th Century-Fox) will remake such irre- proachable yarns as “The Little Shep- herd of Kingdom Come” and “Tess of the Storm Country” — both in color. The former, produced by Maury Dexter in Cinemascope, was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen from Barre Lyndon’s screenplay. Jimmie Rodgers is starred. THE ‘SIMON-PURE’ VARIETY Others that have no chance of at- tracting censorial lightning from any quarter include “Tammy, Tell Me True,” Sandra Dee-John Gavin starrer which Ross Hunter is producing for Universal- International, in color. Harry Keller di- rects. Then there’s Metro’s “The Won- ders of Aladdin,” an Embassy Pictures- International-Lux Films’ production in Eastman Color being produced in Italy by (Joseph E. Levine and directed by Henry Levin. Donald O’Connor, Noelle Adam and Michelle Mercier star. Looming largely on the spectacle front is producer-director Roger Cor- man’s “Atlas,” being touted as the first million-dollar picture of The Filmgroup, Corman’s own company. It was filmed in Greece, stars Michael Forest, Frank Wolff and Barboura Morris, produced- directed by Corman from an original screenplay by Charles B. Griffith, and, of course, is in color and Vistascope. It should be remembered that many of the other photoplays herein listed also will be in widescreen and color and that many of them will have their respective spectacular sequences, al- though pageantry is not to be con- sidered their No. 1 appeal. Other proposed ventures which will have accented spectacle as their forte include United Artists’ “Hawaii,” based on James A. Michener’s novel depicting the colorful evolution of the Islands over several generations. To be lensed by the Mirisch Co., Fred Zinnemann will produce and direct from a screenplay by Daniel Taradash. “How the West Was Won” is on the agenda at MGM, to be produced in Cinerama. James Webb is writing the screen treatment of this massive, action-filled drama accenting America’s expansion westward. COMPARATIVELY FEW WESTERNS Once the entree of any product meal planned and served by Hollywood, sage- brush has been reduced to the status of a canape — albeit what little remains of it is expensively and impressively pre- pared. In other words, there are to be comparatively few westerns. But those that are on the drawing boards are biggies with a capital B. This is re- flective of a situation that has obtained for the past several years during which periods the magi of theatrical film manufacture have wisely decided to be- queath the low-budget and/or series hoss opera to the fumbling, repetitious hands of television producers. And how those hands have gripped such modest boots-and-saddles stories. Witness “Wa- gon Train,” “Have Gun, Will Travel,” “Cheyenne,” “Wanted, Dead or Alive,” “The Outlaws,” etc., ad infinitum and ad nauseaum. In order to qualify for today’s theat- rical screen, a western must definitely be king-size. For example, there’s MGM’s remake of “Cimarron,” star- ring Glenn Ford and Maria Schell, produced by Edmund Grainger in Cinemascope and Metrocolor, and helmed by Anthony Mann. Sure, that giant of the great open space already is in limited exhibition, but for all prac- tical purposes it can be considered part of 1961’s product lineup. Incidentally, “Cimarron” was seriously considered as still another roadshow attraction, but it was finally decided to accord it ortho- dox release treatment. Just a morsel of additional evidence that distribution brass realizes that in 1960 it went a bit overboard on two-a-day policy. OTHERS IN WESTERN MODE Then there is “One-Eyed Jacks,” which Paramount will bring to market. It was produced by Frank P. Rosen- berg for Pennebaker Productions, di- rected by Marlon Brando, who also starred along with Karl Malden, Katy Jurado and Pina Pellicer. It was lensed in VistaVision and Technicolor. Colum- bia is readying “Two Rode Together,” James Stewart-Richard Widmark star- rer, which Stan Shpetner produced and John Ford directed. Frank Nugent wrote the screenplay based on Will Cook’s Saturday Evening Post yarn, “Commanche Captive.” As one of the two commitments on Hecht-Hill-Lancas- ter’s United Artists slate, the independ- ent outfit is preparing “The Way West,” based on a novel by A. B. Guth- rie jr., as a big budget western opus; and Stanley Kramer may ready his “Invitation to a Gunfighter” for 1961.

Starring Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn and Rita Moreno, Robert Wise pro- duced and codirected with Jerome Rob- bins. Ernest Lehman wrote the screen- play for the musical-drama which was lensed in Panavision 70 and is slated for roadshow presentation later this year. BIG MUSICALS ON WAY Twentieth Century-Fox is preparing the screen version of “Sound of Music,” Broadway hit of last year, and Warner Bros, should complete “Music Man,” which Morton Da Costa will produce- direct starring Robert Preston, Shirley Jones and Hermione Gingold. Marion Hargrove penned the screenplay from Meredith Willson’s stage hit. “Flower Drum Song,” another recent Broadway smash, will be brought to movie patrons by Universal-International, with Nancy Kwan and James Shigeta starred. Ross Hunter will produce and Henry Koster direct the Joseph Fields script based on the novel by C. Y. Lee. Shirley MacLaine and Jack London will topline another musical biggie, “Irma La Douce,” which The Mirisch Co. will make for United Artists release. Billy Wilder will pro- duce, direct and cowrite the screenplay with I. A. L. Diamond. FOR GOOSE PIMPLE TRADE There is to be a fair-to-middlin’ supply of goose pimples. For American International Pictures, Roger Corman has produced and directed “The Pit and the Pendulum,” in Panavision and col- or, starring Vincent Price, John Kerr, Barbara Steele and Luana Anders, from a story by Edgar Allen Poe. Other forth- coming ventures of the spine-freezing variety include “The Devil’s Partner,” a horror yarn which Charles Rondeau produced-directed for The Filmgroup, Inc., starring Edwin Nelson, Jean Alli- son and Edgar Buchanan. In prepara- tion at Paramount is the eerie Victoria Holt tome, “Mistress of Mellyn,” which Henry Blanke will produce and for which Eleanore Griffin has written the screenplay. Then for Columbia release, William Castle has produced and helmed “Homicidal,” a chilling Robb White original screenplay in which Jean Arless and Glen Corbett are toplined. Along the same line of horror fare, Bert I. Gordon Productions has completed “St. George and the Seven Curses,” starring Basil Rathbone and Estelle Winwood, for United Artists distribu- tion. Gordon produced and directed from his own original story for which Bernard Schoenfeld gets script credit. That old staple, the science-fiction drama will be in evidence again, al- though probably not as plentiful as in former years. The paucity is, perhaps attributable to the fact that what was Buck Roger-ish just a short time ago is now in or on the edge of established science. Resultantly, the concocters of sci-fi screen fare have to be more fantastically imaginative than ever be- fore. Nonetheless, American Interna- tional Pictures has come up with “Kon- ga,” an original screenplay by Herman Cohen and Aben Kandel, produced by Cohen and directed by John Lemont. It stars Michael Gough, Margo Johns, Jess Conrad and Claire Gordon in SpectaMation and color. AIP also will bring forth “Reptilicus,” an original yarn by Sidney Pink, who also pro- duced and directed from a screenplay he copenned with lb Melchoir. The opus anent prehistoric monsters stars Carl Ottosen, Ann Smyrner and Bodil Miller. MORE IN SCIENCE-FICTION The Filmgroup organization will re- lease “Creature From the Haunted Sea,” with a cast headed by Betsey Jones- Moreland, Antony Carbone and Ed- ward Wain. Roger Corman produced and directed from an original screen story by Charles B. Griffith. In this sec- tion is not to be omitted “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,” which Irwin Allen produced-directed for 20th-Fox release, starring Walter Pidgeon, Joan Fontaine, Barbara Eden and Peter Lorre. It’s in Cinemascope and De Luxe Color, based on an original yarn by Allen. Another offering that will under- take to look into an illusory future is “Atlantis, The Lost Continent,” which George Pal produced and helmed for MGM release. It stars Joyce Taylor and Anthony Hall in an original screen- play by Dan Mainwaring, and it re- ceived Technicolor and Cinemascope treatment. Presented in a process called Mystimation will be Joseph E. Levine’s “The Fabulous World of Jules Verne,” which Warner Bros, will distribute. Le- vine produced for his Embassy Pictures Corp., and the film will utilize live action, animation and lithography. No annual lineup would be complete without a smattering of biographical features. In fact, it appears that in 1961 such subjects will constitute a slightly higher percentage than usual. There is Allied Artists’ “Operation Eichmann,” treating with the life of Nazi butcher Adolf Eichmann, who will be portrayed by Werner Klemperer. Others in the cast are Ruta Lee and Donald Buka. Samuel Bischoff and David Diamond coproduced and R. G. Springsteen di- rected from Philip Yordan’s screenplay. “The Hoodlum Priest,” starring Don Murray in the story of Father Dismas Clark, Catholic priest, will be released by United Artists. Irvin Tiershner di- rected the Murray-Wood independent production. Also from UA will come “Birdman of Alcatraz,” dealing with the saga of life-prisoner Robert Stroud. Harold Hecht produced and John Frankenheimer directed with Burt Lan- caster starred as Stroud. In preparation at Columbia is “Lawrence of Arabia,” slated to star Marlon Brando as T. E. Lawrence, the man who helped form the history of English-speaking peoples of the world. And, of course, there is the earlier mentioned “Cleopatra” from 20th-Fox, with Elizabeth Taylor as the famous Queen of Egypt. ONLY A PARTIAL LISTING The foregoing paragraphs, because of space limitations, list only a portion of the pictures slated for 1961 production. A more complete catalog is to be found in the Looking Ahead section ap- pearing elsewhere in this issue. But from this highlights resume may be gleaned the information that Holly- wood will continue to make pictures for the theatrical screen, albeit in smaller numbers than during past years when theatres were not confronted with as much competition from other enter- tainment media — television, sports or where are your erstwhile customers spending their time and shekels these days? The symposium illustrates also that the literary sources for films will be about the same and as varied as usual — original screenplays, novels old and new, stage hits, etc. The product short- age being what it is, no one is going to be too choosey about filmplays’ geneses.

FOR ENTERTAINMENT THAT’S TOPS, YOU CAN’T TOP THE ENTERTAINMENT FROM WARNER BROS . ! BritiJi and ddo reign ddilmd Jdn Big lyjear By FRANK LEYENDECKER FTER a steady rise for British and foreign pictures in the art thea- tres, as well as in many regular situations in the U. S. during 1959, this type of product really had a banner year in 1960. The number of theatres showing British, French, Italian, Swedish and German pictures has increased greatly, to the extent that “there are at least 800 of them all over the U. S. today playing foreign films at least a major portion of their operating time,” ac- cording to Albert Floersheimer jr., in charge of public relations for the Thea- tre Owners of America in a recent ar- ticle in Showbill. New York art theatre program. The past year also saw a score of Italian costume spectacles, several starring Steve “Hercules” Reeves of the bulging muscles, dubbed into English by major distributors and booked into cir- cuit houses across the country. These pictures usually bypassed first runs but were great successes with the youngsters and male fans in saturation bookings. NAMED AMONG TEN BEST Also for the first time, the newspaper critics on the New York dailies included several foreign-language pictures in their “Best Ten” lists. Kate Cameron of the News and Rose Pelswick each named foreign pictures in their lists, while Paul V. Beckley of the Herald - Tribune and Archer Winsten of the Post included only two Hollywood pic- tures, “The Apartment” and the in- dependently-made “The Savage Eye,” and Jerry Wald’s “Sons and Lovers,” made in England, and Fred Zinneman’s “The Sundowners,” filmed in Australia. This was the poorest showing ever for Hollywood productions. The others on Beckley’s and Winsten’s lists were either French, British, Swedish, Russian, Ital- ian, Japanese or Indian — quite a con- glomeration of tongues. British pictures on U. S. sci’eens showed another increase, mainly be- cause of Peter Sellers, the comedian who was represented by “The Mouse That Roared,” “I'm All Right, Jack,” both distributed nationally by Columbia Pictures, “The Battle of the Sexes,” dis- tributed by Continental, and “Man in a Cocked Hat,” distributed by Show Corporation. Other British comedies which played many regular dates were “Carry On, Nurse,” which has chalked up the longest runs for any British comedy in the U. S. during 1980 in all the principal cities and is expected to gross $1,000,000 < considered fabulous for a modest-budget British picture which had already paid off its produc- tion cost in England ) , according to Governor Films, the U. S. distributor; “Carry On, Constable,” the sequel, which is just getting started in its key city runs but looks like another British comedy hit, and “Please Turn Over,” also a Columbia release. Unlike the Sellers-Terry-Thomas pictures, these last-named British comedies lack star names. Sevei-al British-made dramas also scored in U. S. art theatres, particularly Sir Laurence Olivier’s “The Entertain- er,” “Expresso Bongo,” starring Lau- rence Harvey, and “Tiger Bay,” starring Horst Buchholtz, all Continental re- leases, Lopert’s “Tunes of Glory,” with Guinness and John Mills, two top Brit- ish names, in addition to the surprise thriller, “Village of the Damned,” an MGM release, which played saturation bookings. FRENCH FILMS GAIN Not far behind the British films, as regards playing time in the U. S., were the French pictures, which always play the art theatres and are rarely dubbed into English. “Hiroshima, Mon Amour,” distributed by Daniel Frankel’s Zenith International, not only won the Joseph Burstyn Award and was named “Best Foreign Picture” by the New York Film Critics but was on every New York newspaper’s “Best Ten” list, except for the two which did not list foreign pic- tures, the Mirror and the World Tele- gram. Other French pictures which at- tracted attention during 1960 were: “The Cousins,” “Rue de Paris,” “The Love Game,” “The Chasers” and two new Brigitte Bardot films, Columbia’s “Babette Goes to War” and “Come Dance With Me,” distributed by Kings- ley, both of which were available in French and English-dubbed versions. Shortly to open is the much -discussed “Breathless,” starring the American Jean Seberg, which has been acclaimed in France. MANY ARE DUBBED Except for the many English-dubbed adventure spectacles, the only impor- tant Italian pictures shown in the U. S. were Rossellini’s “General della Rovere” and “The Big Deal,” but these both re- ceived favorable reviews. Sweden’s con- tribution to the U. S. screens were all from the acclaimed Ingmar Bergman, his latest, “The Virgin Spring,” which was also on the majority of “Best Ten” lists, and his earlier pictures, “A Lesson in Love” and “Dreams” (circa 1954-55). German films held steady during 1960, mainly because of “Rosemary,” which chalked up long runs in the art houses and was later dubbed and played many regular situations. Other German- language pictures included “The Rest Is Silence,” a modern version of the “Hamlet” story; “Confess, Dr. Corda” and several older features starring Lilli Palmer and Maria Schell, both now making Hollywood films. The 30-year- old German version of “The Three- penny Opera” was also brought back by Brandon Films to play many art houses on the strength of the current off- Broadway hit. Soviet pictures gained headway because of the U. S. and U.S.S.R. reciprocal agreement which saw “The Ci’anes Are Flying,” “Othello,” “The Idiot” and the current MGM re- lease, “Don Quixote,” playing many art houses. “Ballad of a Soldier,” an out- side Soviet picture distributed by Kings- ley International, has been widely ac- claimed and is expected to play many art house dates in 1981. The first Argentine -made feature to be shown in America, “End of Inno- cence,” the Indian “The World of Apu,” the Japanese “Ikiru,” all of which re- ceived critical acclaim from New York newspaper critics, and the Greek-made (but largely in English) “Never on Sunday” were the other foreign films which attracted attention during 1960. In addition to the aforementioned “Breathless,” other important French films scheduled to open early in 1961 include: Brigitte Bardot’s “Le Verite” (The Truth) and “Modigliani of Montparnasse,” starring Gerard Philipe and Lilli Palmer, while the two Ger- man pictures, “The Spessart Inn,” one of Germany’s most successful films of recent years, starring Lilo Pulver and Carlos Thompson, and “The Bridge,” shown at many European festivals, will also open shortly. And they will just as likely play in Des Moines, Phoenix, Buffalo and Kansas City art houses as in the New York or Los Angeles class spots. ONE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL Some time in the spring, U. S. film- goers will get their first look at one of the most widely discussed and contro- versial films produced in Italy in recent years. It is “La Dolce Vita,” which Federico Fellini directed from his own screenplay, a sociological drama de- scribing life in Rome’s decadent society as seen through the eyes of a degenerate reporter. As the story involves some re- cent high-level scandals in Rome, and the episodes are generally handled in bold detail, the picture has created a storm of official and church protest — but to no avail. Although a number of independent U. S. distributors, over past months, announced they had ob- tained distribution rights to the film, the final and reportedly official pact has been signed with Astor Pictures Corp. Again, quoting Floersheimer’s article in Showbill: “Yes, Sweden’s Bergman is coming to Main Street, along with Italy’s de Sica, England’s Guinness and France’s Bardot. A revolution? True, but one that is bound to be interesting.” 16 BAROMETER Section THE 2 MOST WONDROUS WONDERS EVER TO EXCITE AND DELIGHT THE SCREEN -- ARE AVAILABLE FROM WARNER BROS, i J — IN JUNE!

SANDRA DEE By VELMA WEST SYKES F OR THE third successive year, Cary Grant has won first place among the top male stars in BOXOFFICE'S annual poll for the All-American Screen Favorites. Leading the feminine contingent is Doris Day, who has been advancing steadily from her first naming to this select circle in 1951. The others chosen by a cross-section of public groups and theatremen are listed in the adjoining column. There have been some changes in positions in the past year and some new names have been added, particularly to the list of male stars, but the long-stand- ing favorites still hold the majority. Securing the honor for the first time are Sandra Dee, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Robert Mitchum, all of whom have been in the runner-up ranks during the past several years. As so much of the popularity of stars is contingent upon the boxof- fice success of their films, it is not surprising that there have been sev- eral notable \"drop-outs” among the top favorites, some over a long period, in recent years. Either they appeared in no new pictures during the current season or the vehicles and the roles they portrayed did not meet with wide favor. In the case of Cary Grant, topping the poll for the third straight year, the great popularity of his last two pictures, \"North by Northwest” and \"Operation Petticoat,” both running to large grosses during 1960, assured his maintenance of the highest pub- lic approval, which has been strongly evidenced at the nation's boxoffices. Doris Day, who had reached sec- ond place among the feminine stars in the poll the last two years, re- ceived tremendous impetus from the success of \"Pillow Talk,” which was followed by two additional winners at the boxoffice, \"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\" and \"Midnight Lace.\" The steady advance of Doris from a singing and dancing star, to a dra- matic actress of stature has been notable. She has been teamed with successful male actors, surrounded by lavish productions and dressed in fabulous gowns, all of which ac- coutrements have contributed to the accolade she has now received. The sure craftsmanship of Jack Lemmon's comedy brought about his almost phenomenal rise to second place in the male ranks this year, from that of no mention among the top winners of last year. \"Some Like It Hot,\" which he and Tony Curtis made with Marilyn Monroe, cata- pulted all three of these stars to high positions of popularity, while \"The Wackiest Ship in the Army\" and \"The Apartment\" brought about the final surge in Lemmon's instance. In fourth place last year, Elizabeth Taylor, who had topped the poll in 1958, now climbs to second place after her two pictures which were winners at the boxoffice, namely, \"Suddenly, Last Summer” and \"But- terfield 8.\" With no major release since \"Pil- low Talk,” Rock Hudson who was top man on the poll in 1957, and sec- ond last year, is still a strong con- tender in the third place bracket this year. Even in cases where a star has not been too active in the current year, this carry-over of popular ap- peal is often noted. Hudson's new- found skill with the comedy situa- tions of \"Pillow Talk\" gave him a whole new category of fans and a resultant continued high regard as evidenced by his strong position this year. Introduced in the Hitchcock thrill- er-comedy, \"The Trouble With Harry,\" Shirley MacLaine has been busy almost continuously ever since and her career received tremendous impetus by the interpretation of her role in “Some Came Running.\" With two successful films to her credit in 1960, \"Can-Can” and the hilarious \"The Apartment\" made with Jack Lemmon, she has now risen from seventh place last year to third place among feminine stars this season. In fourth place, Debbie Reynolds falls from first place last year, but Tony Curtis, who was not among the winners last year, demonstrates great strides in the race for popu- larity. Debbie, even though a few notches lower this year, has a strong hold on the affections of moviegoers as shown by her successful films, \"It Started With a Kiss,\" \"The Gazebo” and \"The Rat Race.\" As for Curtis, after the record-breaking \"Some Like (Continued on page 23) BOXOFFICE 19 JACK LEMMON CARY GRANT ROCK HUDSON TONY CURTIS JOHN WAYNE WILLIAM HOLDEN yul brynner FRANK SINATRA jerry lewis ROBERT M/TCHUM t All-American Screen Favorites for 1960 (Continued from page 19) It Hot,\" he went on to comedy por- trayals in \"Operation Petticoat\" with Cary Grant, \"Who Was That Lady?\" and \"The Rat Race,\" and the heavier role in \"Spartacus,\" which schedule of steady activity brought him into the ranks of the winners. Joanne Woodward, in fifth place among the women stars this year, continues a steady advance through sound dramatic performances in \"The Fugitive Kind\" and \"From the Terrace\" which have brought her from eighth place in 1958 and sixth in 1959. Her Academy Award win- ning role in \"The Three Faces of Eve\" first brought her into the ranks of stars to be reckoned with and her progress since has been only what might have been expected from so auspicious a beginning. Yul Brynner's popularity graph as recorded in the poll would seem to be one of seesaw dimensions. From third place in 1958, to tenth place in 1959, he rises again, to fifth this year. Four films of varying boxoffice success are the result of an ex- tremely heavy schedule, \"Solomon and Sheba,\" \"Once More, With Feel- ing,\" “The Magnificent Seven\" and an excursion into comedy,” \"Sur- prise Package.” Sixth place on the distaff side finds Deborah Kerr one place lower than last year, although it may well be that her current film with Robert Mitchum, \"The Sundowners,\" will be the stimulus for a better rating in the season to come. THE RUNNERS-UP: (Listed in Order of Highest Number of Votes Received) MALE Marlon Brando Laurence Olivier Charlton Heston Dean Martin Gary Cooper David Niven James Stewart Henry Fonda Clark Gable (deceased) Anthony Perkins Alec Guinness Tony Randall Paul Newman Ralph Bellamy Burt Lancaster Laurence Harvey Pat Boone Danny Kaye Fred Astaire Elvis Presley Bing Crosby Stephen Boyd Spencer Tracy Harry Belafonte Montgomery Clift Lee J. Cobb Maurice Chevalier Charles Laughton Gregory Peck Fredric March Bob Hope Yves Montand The hardy perennial, Frank Sin- atra, riding high on two boxoffice bonanzas, achieves a sixth place rating this year as opposed to ninth in last year's poll in a return toward fourth place which he held in 1957. With \"Can-Can\" early in '60 and \"Ocean's 11,\" later, he continues with his boxoffice success and again proves his personal popularity. A star whose popularity as shown in the poll seems to reflect not only the boxoffice grosses of her films, but also the sympathetic appeal of the particular roles she plays, is Audrey Hepburn. She was in tenth place in 1958 and fifth the year be- fore, eighth in 1959 and in 1960 she is in sixth place. Her role in \"The Nun's Story\" had great sympathetic appeal. William Holden has, for several years now, kept a place among the top-ranking male stars, this year placing seventh with the success of \"The World of Suzie Wong\" adding to the carry-over power he has con- sistently shown. Last year found him in fourth place and the two preced- ing years he came in second. Marilyn Monroe, eleventh ranking woman star last year, has moved up to eighth place in 1960, perhaps more due to the smash hit, \"Some Like It Hot\" of the preceding season, than to the current film, \"Let's Make Love.\" This brings her even with the great western star, John Wayne, whose long record of successful films culminated this year in his own pro- duction of \"The Alamo.\" His role in \"North to Alaska,\" a hilarious “north- western,\" added its weight to the overall summary of his popular strength. Susan Hayward drops from third place on last year's poll to ninth this year. Her last two films have been \"Woman Obsessed\" and \"The Mar- riage-Go-Round,\" the latter coming too late in the season to have been able to add to her popular following. Kirk Douglas, who did not appear among the top winners in the 1959 poll, again enters the lists, on this occasion in ninth place, due no doubt to the success of his two most recent films, \"Strangers When We Meet\" and the spectacle, \"Sparta- cus.\" A drop from his last year's rank- ing is registered by Glenn Ford, third then and now tenth. However, in the opinion of most critics, his fine performance in the current \"Cimar- ron\" will give great support to an upward climb during the coming season. In spite of the fact her last picture released here was \"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,\" Ingrid Bergman still wins a position, tenth, on this year's poll. The recurring upsurges in her popular appeal coincide with releases of her new films. Kim Novak, who headed the ag- gregation of women stars in 1957, but dropped to ninth place last year, now maintains her position in the upper twelve by ranking eleventh with one film to her credit, \"Strang- ers When We Meet.\" With three films of major stature, \"Home From the Hill,\" \"The Night Fighters\" and “The Sundowners,\" Robert Mitchum gains a place among the winners at the eleventh level. Sandra Dee, a newcomer to the winning circle, achieves a \"first\" in the popularity poll by making twelfth place in the listing, while \"old- timer\" Jerry Lewis continues among the toppers, albeit a notch below his eleventh position last year. The All-American Screen Favorites Poll is conducted by sending ballots listing the eligible stars to the fol- lowing individuals and groups: 1 . Motion picture editors of newspapers and magazines. 2. Theatres — circuits and independents in both large cities and small towns. 3. The working press comprising domestic, for- eign and radio correspondents. 4. Radio and TV commentators. 5.

Overall, the films scoring in the hit class (120 per cent of average business or more) registered a total of 117, just two under the previous season. But it is two more than were recorded in the year before that- Breaking this into various brackets, a gain was made in the number of films that hit 250 per cent and over. There were six in this top cate- gory, including which the 200 per cent and over bracket showed a total of 14, which is just one under the high mark made in '58-'59. And this leveling of gains previously made carries through the total number of releases that grossed average or better, 214 against 218. The past season was distinguished for another reason: There were more roadshow productions current than in any year in history. As our calculations take into account only pro- duct that is in general release, the super-films are not listed. However, they merit special mention due to their high quality and the prestige they have given to the industry. These roadshow attractions comprise \"The Alamo,\" Ben-Hur,\" \"Can-Can,\" \"Exodus,\" \"Porgy and Bess\" and \"Spartacus-\" They all have attracted high- volume patronage. The top mark for a regular release in the past season was scored by \"Operation Petti- coat,\" with \"Psycho\" a close second, followed by \"Swiss Family Robinson\" and \"Solomon and Sheba.\" It is noteworthy that these and other top hits differ widely as to types of pictures. The entire gamut of variety in entertainment is ranged by these attractions, with a sub- stantial number in the \"family\" classification, ten having won BOXOFFICE Blue Ribbon Awards for their family entertainment value. There were a number of surprises — pictures faring better than had been anticipated; and disappointments — those that did reasonably well above average, but did not quite come up to expectations. And, as in every season, there was a sprinkling of \"sleepers\" and \"gimmick” pictures that scored pleasingly. As for the top company credits, Columbia led with 19 hits; 20th-Fox was next with 18; Warner Bros, had 15; United Artists 12; Para- mount ten; MGM nine, Universal six; American- International five; and Buena Vista five.

TECHNICOLOR® CORPORATION Sales Department , Motion Picture Division 6311 ROMAINE STREET, HOLLYWOOD 38, CALIFORNIA. TEL HOLLYWOOD 7-1101 Technicolor is a registered trademark Cdo o p era ti ve Cda trip ci icj nS Spurred in 60 By HUGH FRAZE “The public is more entertainment - conscious than ever before. But it must be sold and sold hard — super promotion on every picture is the only answer to empty seats.” T HIS quotation appeared in one ot the very first issues of Boxoffice Showmandiser in 1960. They are the words of Art Sills, manager of the Capitol Theatre in Jackson, Mich., of the Butterfield circuit. Later in the year, a report by Nyman Kessler, longtime manager for Stanley Warner Theatres at Bayonne, N. J., be- gins with these words: “Showmanship improves in quality and volume in response to added com- petition and new demands coming from within the industry.” And in the very last issue of the year is this: “That little extra promotion often means a little extra in the boxoffice till.” WIDE RANGE EFFORT In between these quotations, in the more than 200 pages of photos and de- scriptions of promotions by theatremen and producer-distributor publicists and promotion managers, is a montage of industry merchandising skills and policies, stimulating in its indication of the tireless determination theatre and film men everywhere are dedicating to doing a better job of selling motion pictures. The montage of showmen in action through 1960, the 52 issues of Boxoffice Showmandiser, also offers a flash of excitement here and there as they re- veal a fresh adaptation of an old pro- motion or the execution of a new idea. Standing out in the 1960 picture are significant gains in cooperative effort. Several exhibitor associations, both Al- lied and Theatre Owners of America affiliates, got behind business-building programs: groups of theatremen joined distributors in joint sectional newspaper and radio-television campaigns on spe- cific pictures, and there were a number of broad area promotions involving several states in which exhibitor-dis- tributor groups carried out saturation preselling programs. COOPERATIVE TREND In the following paragraphs are ex- amples of this new evidence of a trend toward unity in merchandising the theatre and its product, a trend which is exciting in its possibilities. The de- velopment suggests that all segments of the industry are facing up to the fact that individual, uncorrelated advertis- ing and promotion is no longer doing the job that must be done to keep the theatre seats filled. In Detroit, an informal organization of circuit and independent theatremen, known as the Metropolitan Exhibitors of Detroit, figured up recently that it had spent $150,000 during 1960 in co- operative business-building. Heading this group are Woodrow Praught, presi- dent of the United Detroit Theatres; Milton H. London, head of Allied Thea- tres of Michigan; Adolph Goldberg of Community Theatres; William Wets- man of Wisper & Wetsman, and Alden Smith, executive vice-president of Cooperative Theatres of Michigan. They reported an average expenditure of $4,000 on 37 pictures during 1960, di- vided as follows: 52 per cent on radio, 26 per cent on newspaper ads and 22 on television spots. Theatre owners and managers in the Baltimore and Annapolis areas conduct- ed a month-long “October Is Gala Movie Month” campaign, arranged un- der the sponsorship of the Allied Mo- tion Picture Theatre Owners of Mary- land. Forty-five theatres shared the cost (radio, television, trailers, pennants and ads) and shared the benefit of such stunts as “Penny Day” — one admission for a cent with purchase of a regular admission ticket. Gov. J. Millard Tawes and Mayor Harold Grady helped draw attention to the event by issuing procla- mations. Fifty exhibitors in the lower Michigan and northern Ohio region joined to- gether at Toledo and got the ball roll- ing on a plan for cooperative promotion, under the initiative of A1 Boudouris of Theatre Operating Co., at that time operating six drive-in theatres in the area. AIDED BY ORGANIZATIONS Allied Independent Theatre Owners of Wisconsin extended its prestige and assistance to members in the Milwau- kee area in a joint promotion of “Visit to a Small Planet.” Tieups were made with the Civil Air Patrol, radio station WOKY and shopping centers. Similar cooperation was effected on “A Dog of Flanders” in the southern Illinois area. Uniting on selected bookings for more than a year is the Great Plains Busi- ness Builder’s Ass’n, organized early in 1959 at the suggestion of Harry Greene, general manager of Welworth Theatres of Minneapolis. This group brings to- gether theatremen in seven states; first, to increase their merchandising know- how through showmanship clinics, and second, to provide cooperative satura- tion campaigns on selected “two-legged” pictures. In Montana, Chris Gorder of the Fort Theatre at Poplar, and a group of small-town exhibitors in the northeast part of the state, achieved record grosses as a result of area booking and television promotion of selected pic- tures, including “For the Love of Mike,” which broke a 14-year-old record; “Ten Who Dared”; “Freckles” and “Walk Tall”; “Tess of the Storm Country”; “The 3 Worlds of Gulliver”; “The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come,” and “Can-Can.” Others in this joint effort were Bob Suckstorff, Sidney, Mont., Bill Larcombe of Glasgow, Forrest Pruett and Grace Severson of Wolf Point, Wayne Fugere of Scobey, Myron Bean of Plentywood, and occasionally the Snyders of Willis- ton. Circuits, which always have main- tained advertising-exploitation offices to pep up and assist their theatre staffers, strengthened their cooperation with managers on the grassroots level during the year. The upper-echelon executives increasingly are getting into the act! CIRCUITS PROVIDE IDEAS Ed Hyman, vice-president of Ameri- can Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, put out a 52-page brochure, “Proven Profit-Making Ideas,” collected from managers of his northern division the- atres. This contained detailed pro- grams on how to increase revenue through Theatre Rentals, Special Mid- night Shows, Holiday Goodwill Package Sales, Concessions and Miscellaneous Profit-Making Ideas. Most of these money ideas were published in Box- office Showmandiser. Then AB-PT also provided its show- men with the Markley Plan, which gives a detailed formula for realizing maximum results on every picture campaign. RKO Theatres supplied its New York district theatre forces another booklet of proven profit-makers, “217 Ideas on How to Sell.” Trans-Texas Theatres, headquartered at Dallas, came up with something new in the way of manager-showmanship incentives. Its managers now receive 25 per cent of profits above house nut, even on kiddy and special shows. National Theatres & Television came up with a list of “Top Summer Promo- tions,” a reference booklet of ideas tested and proven for their worth. This circuit also arranged for circuit-wide promotion of Fall Fashion Shows in the Summer, starting them in July. Mats and a complete brochure of suggestions on how to put over “It’s Holiday-Time in Theatreland” was pushed by the NT&T head office for the yearend in cooperation with newspaper amusement sections. PRODUCERS ALSO ASSIST Producer-distributor cooperation is reflected in the pages of Showmandiser by the increased number of reports on gala premieres attended by stars and Hollywood personalities, and by national merchandise tieups. For example. Unit- ed Artists could boast eight national merchandising tieups on “The Boy and the Pirates,” ranging from Cocoa Marsh to Fleer’s Bubble Gum. Among other national assists that come to mind are the Movie Certificates promotion for “Ocean’s 11” and the Quaker Oats package coupons for “Please Don’t Eat the Daisies” by MGM. Bursting on the theatre scene during 1960 for many theatre managers was (Continued on page 48) BOXOFFICE 43 SLSUULJLSLSLSLSULSULSUULSLSULJLJLSLSLSLSLaJLSULSL^ a BOXOFFICE SALUTES TEN TOP NEWCOMERS (Listed Alphabetically) ★ FRANKIE AVALON * GEORGE PEPPARD ★ DIANA DARRIN ★ TROY DONAHUE * FABIAN * RICK NELSON ★ JULIET PROWSE ★ JIMMIE RODGERS ★ JEREMY SLATE ★ TUESDAY WELD FRANKIE AVALON After making an auspicious film de- but in Warner Bros.’ “Guns of the Timberlands,’’ 21 - year - old Avalon copped one of the plum roles of the year by snaring a starring spot in “The Alamo.” Currently, he is starring in “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea” for 20th-Fox, splicing his feature film work with night club and personal appear- ance dates throughout the country. Born in Philadelphia, Pa., he scored in the million sales brackets with his ex- clusive Chancellor recordings, among them “Venus” and the album, “Swing- ing On a Rainbow.” DIANA DARRIN Equally at home in motion pictures, television or recordings, Diana Darrin is a triple talent who so delighted pro- ducer Robert L. Lippert in “The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come” that he signed her to a new three-picture pact. This Easter she will be seen as guest star of Allied Artists’ “Dondi,” while her record, “All Accordin’,” for the Magnet label is jetting to hit prominence. A recruit from off-Broadway plays, she first appeared in 15 comedy shorts for Jules White at Columbia and in “Marty,” “Bachelor Party,” “The Bold and the Brave,” among other features. TROY DONAHUE One of Warner Bros.’ discoveries in the studio’s 1959 nation-wide search for new personalities, Troy first proved himself worthy of notice in a leading role in “A Summer Place,” the picture that shot him onto the lists of top teen- agers’ favorites. He snagged a costar- ring spot in “The Crowded Sky” and then was cast in a big dramatic role in “Parrish” and in his latest, “Susan Slade.” Television fans know him for many top roles and the studio current- ly has him dividing his time between features and the starring chores on its popular new “Surfside 6” series. FABIAN Recently signed to a seven-year, one- picture-a-year contract by 20th-Fox, this youngster proved his claim to film stardom with “Hound Dog Man,” “High Time” and “North to Alaska.” His next release will be “Love in a Goldfish Bowl” for Paramount. Born in Philadel- phia, Pa., the 18-year-old first hit the top with several million-seller record- ings under an exclusive Chancellor pact. His current hit is “You Know You Be- long to Somebody Else.” Both films and records are boosted by a 50,000 member fan club. 44 BAROMETER Section RICK NELSON With 12 years of x - adio and television work on his family’s popular shows be- hind him, Rick proved to be a veteran performer in his first major motion picture, Warner Bros.’ “Rio Bravo.” It won him critical acclaim and major ex- hibitor interest, both of which are being repeated in his current Columbia re- lease, “The Wackiest Ship in the Army.” A top teenage singing idol, the 20-year- old has seven gold records to his credit and draws capacity crowds in every per- sonal appearance. His latest Imperial record hit is “You Are the Only One.” GEORGE PEPPARD A “veteran” of important roles in pictures like “End As a Man” and “Pork Chop Hill,” Peppard really exploded on the filmland scene with a starring role in MGM’s “Home Fi'om the Hill.” He followed it with “The Subterraneans,” then moved to Paramount to costar with Audrey Hepburn in the upcoming re- lease, “Breakfast At Tiffany’s.” Born in Detroit, he is the son of a former opera singer and spent several years playing a variety of stage and television roles before coming to Hollywood, among them Broadway stints in “The Pleasure of His Company” and “Girls of Sum- mer.” JULIET PROWSE A dancer who scored a sensation in her first motion picture, a starring role in 20th-Fox’s “Can-Can,” Juliet came to Hollywood by way of India, South Africa and England, where she was born, raised and educated, respectively. In London, she was featured in various ballet companies and stage musicals, but she reached fame recently with the starring roles in “G.I. Blues,” “The Fiercest Heart” and “The Right Ap- proach” on the screen. A striking red- head, she photographs perfectly for color films and has been spotlighted on several TV spectaculars. JIMMIE RODGERS It took the title role in the 20th-Fox release, “The Little Shepherd of King- dom Come,” to bring this popular Rou- lette recording star to feature films, but the three studio term pact offers that followed indicate a long and happy ca- reer in the field. Jimmie first hit prom- inence with a smash recording of “Honeycomb,” the first of a dozen major hit singles and nine big-selling albums. Television claimed him as guest on all the top shows, as well as star of his own. In features, he hopes to do westerns or films with American history back- grounds. JEREMY SLATE Already firmly ensconced in television as costar of the popular CBS series, “The Aquanauts,” Jeremy recently got his first major break in feature motion pictures with a top role in the Para- mount release, “G.I. Blues.” Critical praise and numerous offers from film producers greeted his performance, giv- ing him a strong foothold in the me- dium. Versatile as an actor as well as in his personal life, he has been a sail- or, radio announcer and publicist and came to Hollywood after a top Broad- way role in “Look Homeward, Angel.” He’s a veteran of top TV roles, as well. TUESDAY WELD At 17, Tuesday has already become something of a Hollywood legend. Hit- ting films and television with a pub- licity bang, she was a Deb Star at 15 and drew top attention from the young fans even before she had half a dozen film exposures. Her big feature break came in “The Five Pennies,” followed by top roles in “Because They’re Young” and “Rally Round the Flag.” Now, she is standing in “High Time,” “Wild in the Country” and “Re- turn to Peyton Place.” Her major tele- vision credits include a regular role on the popular “Dobie Gillis” series.

This type of booking and promotion, used on a limited scale in former years, spread to all the major cities and down to the smaller centers during 1960. Boxoffice Showmandiser supplied its readers with full details on how to han- dle this innovation through “The Hard- Ticket Operation — How It Works,” writ- ten by Harold Meyers, in charge of group sales for the Famous Players Ca- nadian Corp., and Michael King, man- ager of the FPC flagship in Toronto, the Imperial. An idea which was especially helpful to individual theatre operators during the year was the radio station-sponsored screening or opening. Ed Linder set it up this way in his campaign for “Col- lege Confidential,” a film with teenage appeal which he figured would interest a radio station. Linder manages the Gopher Theatre at Minneapolis. WDGY advertised that it was hosting the screening and asked listeners to write in for their tickets. (If a larger response is wanted, listeners are asked to phone in their names and addresses and tick- ets are mailed) . WDGY broadcast ten spots a day for five days in advance. Linder reported the early-bird preview was a “tremendous” success. TIEUPS WITH OTHER MEDIA Manager King planned his preview of “Pollyanna” on a large scale, and the radio station tieup was only one of the means to get a large response. The disc jockeys of all stations were pleased to broadcast invitations to a preview of an “outstanding movie” to their listeners, who were asked to write in for their tickets. In addition, King sent out invitations, most of them RSVP, to press folk, radio, VIP, group sales contacts, and by trailer and lobby display. When replies were re- ceived, names were checked off the list and replies sent. The preview was scheduled at 7:30 p.m., after regular show patrons had been cleared. About 1,000 attended. Leo Young, manager of the Orpheum Theatre in Sioux City, Iowa, promoted seven valuable doorprizes to pull 600 women (and six men) to a morning screening of “The Dark at the Top of the Stairs.” Sol Sorkin, RKO Keith Theatre, Syracuse, N. Y., got Dick Lawrence, the emcee of a morning show on WNDR to “host” a screening for the same picture, to broadcast 65 spots in two days. Some 511 showed up, 490 of them women. In an effort to achieve broader and deeper coverage at lower cost, Wayne Smith of Pontiac, Mich., dropped direct mail and turned to giant-size multiple- color ads in the newspaper, large enough to serve as heralds. A classified ad-theatre pass tieup was one of the cheapest space producers noted during the year. As worked out by Manager LeRoy Ramsey of the Hollywood Theatre, Fort Worth, Tex., and the Fort Worth Press, the theatre puts up 20 passes daily for six days, each good for a double admission. The Press scatters 20 names each day in its want ad section, and uses a banner such as, “There Are No Strangers in the Press Classified Ads . . . But Find Your Name in the Listings and Win 2 Free Tickets to See ‘Strangers When We Meet’ at the Hollywood Theatre, etc. In addition, the theatre gets a 2-col., 4-inch space daily for a mat on the film. The deal is used when the film is right for it. The horror drama was responsible for a new promotion gimmick, which at first was regarded with misgivings by many showmen. Producers have at times recommended that no one be admitted during the last ten minutes of a film, but it remained for Alfred Hitchcock to extend this limitation to the whole run on his “Psycho.” Pinkerton opera- tives in uniforms stood beside entrance signs in first-run openings which read, “Positively No One Admitted After the Showing of ‘Psycho’ Starts.” The film became one of the best grossers of the year. NOVEL HORROR SELL Another distinction went to a horror film in 1960. “Brides of Dracula” was accorded full world-premiere treatment. Richard Lightman, Malco Theatres ex- ecutive at Memphis, Tenn., Watson Davis, advertising manager, and Elton Holland, manager of the Malco Theatre there, gave this picture the works with promotion resurrected from “the golden age of ballyhoo.” “Horror is boxoffice,” Lightman com- mented. “Scare, but don’t offend; frighten, not paralyze.” The three used an oldtime hearse, werewolf cubs, pet bats, spiders, arma- dillos, Fang-Up elixir and a full-fledged stage show. “Hokum,” they conceded, “but it’s the kind of hokum that en- abled us to break all existing records with the picture.” Theatremen who enjoy corn were in their heyday when they booked “Li’l Abner.” The storerooms of sheriffs’ offices in many small towns were raided by happy showmen as they rounded up moonshine stills, whisky jugs and old- fashioned rifles to build “Li’l Abner” front-of-theatre displays, with a few Dogpatch characters thrown in. SUMMER KIDDY SHOWS Ray Niles and Cliff Knoll, Minne- sota Amusement Co. managers in Sioux Falls, S. D., wanted to line up a really big kiddy movies summer series, and had tried unsuccessfully several years to obtain a sponsor able to bring in the youngsters in droves. Turn-downs were received from the Ass’n of Uni- versity Women, and the Boy and Girl Scouts until they contacted the Trades and Labor Council. The latter approved a tieup which called for the council auxiliary to sell series tickets at $1 for a 25 per cent commission. Manager Knoll also came up with an “exclusive,” an all-night all-girl slum- ber party, which he arranged in advance of “Wake Me When It’s Over.” Yes, the theatre doors were kept locked from 12 midnight, when the party started, till 6 a.m., when the girls were taken home after a breakfast of rolls and coffee. Counselors of Future Business Leaders of America, a high school club of girl students in the commercial classes, served as chaperons and sup- plied the list of those who were to at- tend, approximately 210. Another unique promotion during 1960 was a “How Long Is Up” contest, staged by Loew’s publicists in Miami Beach in advance of “The Bellboy” at Loew’s new 170th Street Theatre. A celebration by a nearby shopping cen- ter was the handle for the unusual stunt. All disc jockeys from WCKR par- ticipated in a foot race. On the next night the winner was hoisted in a sta- tion wagon 50 feet in the air for a stay of at least 11 days during the run of “The Bellboy.” The deejay broadcasted at least six hours daily from his perch above the theatre’s street sign and, at least once an hour, the station checked what the deejay was doing. Both television and radio people in the Miami area were invited to esti- mate how many days and hours the WCKR jockey would stay up. The win- ner won an expense-paid trip to Nas- sau and $450 worth of gifts promoted from the shopping center stores. Nat- urally, the stores featured big sales during the stunt. Unusual tieups and promotions: Florida Citrus cartoon matinees in five Waters’ circuit theatres in Birmingham, Ala., were sponsored by the Florida Citrus commission. An empty citrus fruit bag was the price of admission. For a Washington’s Birthday Silver Dollar Party at the Temple Theatre in Temple City, Calif., Manager Stoddard Gumaer lined up 36 stores as sponsors for the gigantic matinee, which featured oodles of prizes, among them 340 silver dollars. “BICYCLES” AUDIENCE At one time bicycling of prints was common, but “bicycling” of an audience is a rare, and as far as we know, a 1960 innovation. Bill Butler did it between the Turnage and Reita Theatres in Washington, N. C. He had promoted a horror-science stage-screen show with considerable hokum at the Turnage, but when a larger-than-anticipated crowd turned up, Butler took over the Reita across the street, also a Stewart & Everett operation, and bicycled his audiences ! Louis M. Sosna, longtime exhibitor of Moberly, Mo., came up with a brainchild he dubbed “Cent-O-Vision,” for the double purpose of testing out “nickel- odeon” prices and getting some mid- week business at his State Theatre. He believes television is not to blame for all the ills of the small-town exhibitor; instead admission prices have gone up out of reach of the masses. So to get his prices, at least on two days (Wednesday and Thursday) down so everyone could afford to attend the State, Sosna lined up 20 merchants for $5 a week each to sponsor Cent-O-Vision. Each merchant received 50 guest tickets (his theatre seats just 1,000), which entitles the showgoer to 25 cents admission on those days. The merchants were signed up for 52 weeks. 48 BAROMETER Section An ALBERT ZUGSMITH Production STARRING DAVID JANSSEN • PATTI PAGE WALTER WINCHELL* MICKEY SHAUGHNESSY ROBERT STRAOSS • ARNOLD STANG and introducing DAVID KORY as •'DONDI\" PATTI PAGE SINGS ‘■DONDI\" AND \"MEADOW IN THE SKY” ADAPTED FROM THE COMIC STRIP BY GUS EDSON & IRWIN HASEN Written and Produced by ALBERT ZUGSMITH & GUS EDSON Directed by ALBERT ZUGSMITH An ALLIED ARTISTS Picture Produced by SAMUEL BISCHOFF and DAVID DIAMOND Directed by JOSEPH M.

Some companies curtailed or eliminated their production of the short films for eco- nomic reasons and so an upcoming gen- eration was deprived of the enjoyment which its elders took for granted when they went to a motion picture theatre. Now, perhaps, that old bugaboo of films — television — has whetted the appetite for more short subjects and producers are waking up to the fact that they are short-changing the customers when a program doesn’t have a one- or two- reeler. INCREASES UNDER WAY A revitalization of short subjects is seen for 1961. Paramount, for one, has taken a new look at the situation, fol- lowing an exhaustive study of the market and its potentials. In association with Sports Illustrated, a program of six subjects was mapped out, covering various phases of sport interest, one of which, “A Sport Is Born,” was described by the Balaban & Katz booking execu- tives as ‘‘one of the greatest shorts ever seen.” A new concept of the travelog was created in the production of “Car- nival in Quebec” and more are in work. The cartoon studio has been modernized in order to bring fresh new animated characters to the theatre. Universal, too, will increase its shorts program in 1961, boosting the output of the Walter Lantz cartoons by one-third. The company this year will give greater attention to its travel pictures, coming out with two new two-reel specials and eight one-reelers, all in color, which al- ready have received acclaim from ex- hibitors and the public alike. With the exception of one company, the distributors — major and independ- ent — are moving toward an expansion in the shorts field, using 1961 as the springboard into more intensified pro- duction in the following years. MORE TRAVEL SUBJECTS Although comedy has been the back- bone of most shorts programs in the past, the travel picture is moving in fast. The appeal of this type of material has increase"
