        "text": "Annapolis, MD - The U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) was designated as an American Physical Society’s (APS) Historic Site, Friday, April 12, during a ceremony held on Radford Terrace, between Michelson Hall and Chauvenet Hall, in recognition of the speed of light measurements taken by Nobel Prize recipient Albert Abraham Michelson.\n\nEvery year, APS recognizes a select number of sites in the United States where important events in the history of physics took place, and this year the Naval Academy was chosen because of the contribution Michelson made to the field of physics.\n\n“In 1877-1879, while [Michelson] was a physics instructor at the academy, he measured the speed with two hundred times greater accuracy than the previously accepted value,” said APS President Young-Kee Kim. “Over his lifetime, he contributed to the fundamental understanding of light and improved the accuracy of its speed by another order of magnitude.”\n\nMichelson was born in Prussia, immigrating to the United States with his parents at two years of age. After high school, Michelson received a special appointment to the Naval Academy’s Class of 1873 after meeting face-to-face with President Ulysses S. Grant in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I love the story of Michelson,” says Naval Academy Provost Samara Firebaugh. “When I taught instrumentation and measurement with the Naval Academy Electrical Engineering Department, I would take my class over to walk the path where the speed of light was measured along the old sea wall of the Naval Academy. I would tell them to think about time and space and the mystery of this former graduate and instructor who performed this experiment, and the connection to their own education about instrumentation and measurements, and the importance of those topics to the Navy then, and to the Navy today.”\n\nAfter graduating ninth in his class, Michelson completed two years of mandatory sea cruises and returned to the Naval Academy as an instructor in 1875.\n\nFirebaugh added, “My favorite thing about him is that the work he did that won him the Nobel Prize and that earned this recognition today was not done at the top of an ivory tower, but it was done as part of classroom instruction to midshipmen in the wonders of physics. This history captures what we seek in our classrooms today, this combination of military professionalism and scholarly expertise, which we have cultivated in our faculty since the founding of this institution in 1845.”\n\nMichelson later went on to become the APS President from 1901-1902, and in 1907 became the first American Scientist awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\n“By designating locations as APS Historic Sites, we aim to acknowledge scientific accomplishments and celebrate the people and places that shape the direction of our field,\" said APS CEO Jonathan Bagger. “It is an honor to recognize the United States Naval Academy for the pathbreaking physics discoveries made on its grounds.\"\n\nThe American Physical Society is a nonprofit membership organization working to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics through its outstanding research journals, scientific meetings, and education, outreach, advocacy, and international activities. APS represents more than 50,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories, and industry in the United States and throughout the world.\n\nFounded in 1845, the U.S. Naval Academy today is a prestigious four-year service academy that prepares midshipmen morally, mentally and physically to be professional officers in the naval service. More than 4,400 men and women representing every state in the U.S. and several foreign countries make up the student body, known as the Brigade of Midshipmen. U.S. News and World Reports has recognized the Naval Academy as #5 best undergraduate engineering program, #1 public school, and #3 liberal arts college. Midshipmen learn from military and civilian instructors and participate in intercollegiate varsity sports and extracurricular activities. They also study subjects such as leadership, ethics, small arms, drill, seamanship and navigation, tactics, naval engineering and weapons, and military law. Upon graduation, midshipmen earn a Bachelor of Science degree in a choice of 26 different subject majors and go on to serve at least five years of exciting and rewarding service as commissioned officers in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps."
