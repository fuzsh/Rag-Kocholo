        "text": "In February 1971, Oskar III, J.W.F. Hansen, an internationally known sculptor displayed his bust of the noted American scientist, Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, at the Navy Memorial Museum (now National Museum of the U.S. Navy). Dr. Michelson was a Naval Academy Graduate who was the first American to receive the Nobel Prize for Physics.\n\nNMUSN-77 : Oskar III, J.W.F. Hansen, 1971. Admires his creation, the bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson after mounting the bronze plaque on the base of the sculpture, May 25, 1971. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nCaptain Shelby C. Gass, Director of the Museum at that time, stated that Oskar's creation was “one of a kind” in that it is the only bust ever made of the noted scientist.\n\nSculpture, alone, has established a niche for Oskar III in the world of art. But to describe him as “Oskar III: Sculptor” would be incomplete. He is a renowned world traveler and author of books and writings on astronomy, biology, theology, and the arts.\n\nNMUSN-84: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Oskar III, J.W.F. Hansen, with the Director of the Naval Historical Center, Vice Admiral Edwin B. Hooper, USN, and Director of the Navy Memorial Museum, Captain Shelby C. Gass. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nOskar III was born in 1892 to Oskar II and Josephine Maximiliana in the dual Kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. He shipped to sea as a cabin boy, worked his way up to seaman, was wounded while serving with the French Foreign Legion in North Africa, rose to General of Brigade in the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution, swam ashore to this country in 1910 and served in the U.S. Army, rising from private to major.\n\nAmong his best known works are the sculptures and “star map” at Hoover Dam; the turquoise Stallion’s Head now in the gem collection of the Smithsonian Institution; and “Excelsior” a bronze figure which was a wedding gift of the people of Norway to King Olav V and his consort, the late Princess Martha. Portrait busts by Oskar III include those of author Joseph Conrad, abolitionist editor Elijah Parish Loveloy, political figure and editor Joseph Meharry Medill, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George, and aviators Wilber and Orville Wright. His Holy Figure of Christendom, faceted and sculptured from a fabulous Morganite beryl crystal, have been exhibited since the 1963 Christmas season at the Natural History Museum of the Smithsonian.\n\nNMUSN-85: Bust of Liberty, 1971. Oskar III, J.W.F. Hansen, with the Director of the Naval Historical Center, Vice Admiral Edwin B. Hooper, USN, looking at his sculpture. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nOskar III work’s is represented in this country and abroad by commemorative works, and in many distinguished permanent collections.\n\nIn 1961, communication to the President signed by 52 Senators, including Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the Senate, Congress eulogized Oskar III for his high ideals and for his sculptural works. Congress placed particular emphasis on his historic sculpture of “Liberty” which crowns the Monument to the Alliance at Yorktown, Virginia, “At Yorktown, we have written into the granite after his name: ‘Sculptor of Liberty.’ This is what he did: This, above all, is the sum of his life.”\n\nNH 64154: Albert Abraham Michelson (1852-1931), American Physicist. NHHC Photograph Collection.\n\nThe subject of the bust by Oskar III, Dr. Albert A. Michelson, was born on December 19, 1852, in Strelno, Prussia, and arrived in America at the age of two. He spent his early childhood at Murphy’s Camp, California, during the gold rush days and attended school in San Francisco.\n\nAt 16, Michelson travelled across the country to request an appointment-at-large to the U.S. Naval Academy. After two personal interviews, President Grant signed the appointment. In 1873, he graduated from the Naval Academy, was commissioned, and sent to sea. After two years of sea duty, he returned to the academy to serve as an instructor in physics and chemistry from 1875 to 1879. It was during this assignment that he conducted his first experiments to determine the speed of light.\n\nNMUSN-78: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Created by Oksar III, J.W.F. Hansen. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nImpressed by Michelson’s experiments, the Navy sent him to Germany to study, experiment and increase his knowledge on the speed of light. Michelson returned from Germany two years later and resigned from the Navy to accept an appointment as professor of physics at Case School of Applied Science. Six years later, he accepted a similar position at Clark University, and in 1892, was appointed professor and head of the department of physics at the University of Chicago.\n\nNMUSN-80: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Created by Oksar III, J.W.F. Hansen. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nMichelson was a member of the Bureau of International des Poids et Measures in 1892 and the International Committee of Weights and Measures in 1897. In 1907, he won the Nobel Prize in physics for his precision optical instrument and the spectrographic and meteorological investigations he conducted.\n\nNMUSN-81: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Created by Oksar III, J.W.F. Hansen. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nDuring World War I, Michelson returned to the Navy as a lieutenant commander and made large contributions in optics and was commended for developing a range-finder for the service. He was a member of the National Research Council and made intensive studies on submarine detection.\n\nNMUSN-82: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Created by Oksar III, J.W.F. Hansen. National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nTwelve honorary degrees were presented to Michelson by colleges and universities such as Cambridge, Yale, Case, Chicago, Stevens Institute, and Western Reserve. He was elected to a large number of scientific societies received numerous medals and awards. He served as president of the American Association of the Advancement of Science, the American Physics Society, and the National Academy of Science. He was the first to be appointed “Distinguished Service Professor” at the University of Chicago in 1925.\n\nMichelson Laboratory at the Naval Ordnance Test Station, China Lake, California, and Michelson Hall in the science building at the Naval Academy are both named in honor of the devoted scientist and distinguished naval officer.\n\nNMUSN-83: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Created by Oksar III, J.W.F. Hansen on display at the Navy Memorial Museum (now National Museum of the U.S. Navy). National Museum of the U.S. Navy Photograph Collection.\n\nNMUSN-2693: Bust of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, 1971. Created by Oksar III, J.W.F. Hansen.
