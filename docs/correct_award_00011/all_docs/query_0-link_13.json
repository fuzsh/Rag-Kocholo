S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, receiving his appointment from President Grant.\n\nAfter graduating in 1873, Michelson entered the United States Navy as an Ensign.\n\nAlbert Michelson taught physics and chemistry as the Naval Academy from 1875 to 1879.\n\nIn 1878, Michelson discovered that light travels at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, later refined to 186,284 miles per second.\n\nThis discovery became the basis for Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.\n\nIn 1880, Albert Michelson studied in Berlin, Heidelberg, and College de France.\n\nFrom 1883 to 1889, Michelson taught at Case University in Cleveland.\n\nFrom 1889 to 1892, Michelson taught at Clark University in Worchester, Massachusetts.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1928, he was the head of the physics department at the University of Chicago, returning to the Navy during WWI.\n\nIn 1907, Albert Michelson won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his optical precision instruments, and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid.\n\nAlbert Michelson was the first American Jew to receive this award.\n\nIn 1928, Michelson returned to California to work for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nCivic\n\nIn 1923, Albert Michelson was elected president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1970, Michelson was elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans.\n\nHe received numerous honorary doctorates.\n\nAccording to Robert Milikan, Albert Michelson is one of the “three most remembered American physicists.”\n\nFamily\n\nAlbert Michelson married Margaret Heminway in 1877.\n\nThey had three children: Albert, Truman (1879-1938), and Elsa.\n\nMargaret Michelson passed away in 1897.\n\nIn 1899, Albert Michelson married Edna Stanton.\n\nThey had three children: Beatrice (1904-1972), Madeleine, and Dorothy.\n\nEdna Michelson passed away in 1931.\n\nProfessor Albert A. Michelson died in 1931 in Pasadena, California.\n\nHe is buried in the Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena, California\n\nAlbert Michelson Elementary School is in Murphy’s Camp, California.\n\nMichelson Drive is one of the major streets in Irvine, California. Three synagogues are located on that street.\n\nSource\n\nNorton B. Stern, “Professor Albert A.

Michelson exhibit"
