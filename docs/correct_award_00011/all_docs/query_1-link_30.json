        "meta_description": "Portrait of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, the first American to receive the Nobel Prize in sciences, ca.1930. Dr. Michelson can be seen at center from the waist up in a dark jacket and vest. His brow is furrowed over his beady eyes and his mustache sits above his thin lips. His thin, lightly-colored hair stands out against the backdrop of the large, glistening, metal pipe which runs behind him. He pushes his left shoulder towards the pip to avoid the large bolt which stands on the right. Originally, the photograph was captioned as \"Portrait of aqueduct engineer William Mulholland, ca.1950\".",
