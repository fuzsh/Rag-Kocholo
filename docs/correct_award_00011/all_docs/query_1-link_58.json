Young-Kee and Jonathan were joined by several U.S. Naval Academy Midshipmen and Faculty, including Professor Paul Mikulski, Professor Emerita Deborah A. Konkowski, Associate Provost Samara Firebaugh, and Superintendent, Vice Admiral Yvette M. Davids. \n\nThe citation reads: \n\n“The United States Naval Academy was the location of the first speed of light measurements by Albert Abraham Michelson. In 1877-1879, while he was a physics instructor at the academy, he measured the speed with two hundred times greater accuracy than the previously accepted value. Over his lifetime, he contributed to the fundamental understanding of light and improved the accuracy of its speed by another order of magnitude.”\".",
