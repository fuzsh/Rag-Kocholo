Although Michelson passed away in 1931, more than a decade before the beginning of the Manhattan Project, work that he did throughout his life provided essential foundations that made Manhattan Project possible.\n\nAs a midshipman at the Naval Academy, Michelson studied optics, heat, climatology and technical drawing.  He became an instructor of physics and chemistry there, and was intensely interested in measuring the speed of light. In 1879 he came up with an estimate of 299,910 +/- 50  Km/second from experiments he did at the academy.  In later years he did measurements from the Mount Wilson Observatory, and in the 1920s, in a vacuum tube 1.6 km long, yielding a value of 299,774+/- 11km/sec. Currently, the speed of light is considered to be 299,792.458, or approximately 300,000, km/sec. When considering the importance of this measurement to the Manhattan Project, present-day physicist William Blumenthal stated, “The speed of light is used as a constant (c) in Einstein’s famous equation correlating mass and energy (E=mc²); this explains how mass is converted to energy in an atomic bomb or reactor.” In addition, work that Michelson did with interferometers influenced Einstein’s theory of special relativity.\n\nDuring the course of his career Michelson was involved in many other aspects of science. He was the founder and first head of the physics department at the then-new University of Chicago in Illinois, which during World War II would be the base for the Metallurgical Laboratory (or Met Lab) and work including Chicago Pile 1, in which the first self-sustaining nuclear fission reaction occurred. In 1907, Michelson was the first American to win a Nobel Prize in Physics, for “his optical precision instruments and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid.” \n\n#ManhattanProjectNPS #WWII #Michelson #Einstein #SpeedOfLight #Mathematics #STEAMpower #GermanAmerican #GermanAmericanHeritageMonth #Physics\n\nPhoto caption: Albert A.
