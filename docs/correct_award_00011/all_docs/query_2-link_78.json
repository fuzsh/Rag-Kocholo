        "text": "Albert Abraham Michelson (19 December 1852 – 9 May 1931) was a renowned American physicist. In 1907, Albert Abraham Michelson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nLife and Career\n\nAlbert Abraham Michelson was born on 19 December 1852, in Strzelno, Prussia. Michelson attended the United States Naval Academy, where he developed a strong interest in science and physics. After graduating, he pursued advanced studies at several institutions, including the University of Berlin. His education laid the foundation for his future research and accomplishments.\n\nThroughout his career, Michelson made significant contributions to the study of light, optics, and spectroscopy. He conducted the famous Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887, which aimed to detect the presence of the luminiferous ether (a hypothetical medium thought to transmit light waves) and played a crucial role in the development of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. Albert Abraham Michelson passed away on 9 May 1931, in Pasadena, California.\n\nAward and Legacy"
