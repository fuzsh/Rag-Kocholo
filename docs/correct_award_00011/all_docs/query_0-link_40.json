        "text": "Albert Abraham Michelson (December 19, 1852 – May 9, 1931) was an American physicist. He was born in Strzelno (in Posen, Prussia, now in Poland) but grew up in California. He was known for his work on measuring the speed of light. That work led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907. He was the first American to receive it in the field of science.\n\nRelated pages\n\nMichelson–Morley experiment\n\nImages for kids\n\nPage one of Michelson's Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Light\n\nConcluding page of Michelson's Experimental Determination of the Velocity of Light\n\nLt. Cmdr. Albert A. Michelson while serving in the U.S. Navy. He rejoined the U.S. Navy in World War I, when this portrait was taken.\n\nThe horizontal structure mounted at the top of the Hooker Telescope implements Michelson's stellar interferometer (1920). Mirrors on that stage (not visible in picture) redirect starlight from two smaller apertures up to 20 feet (6m) apart into the telescope.\n\n\"Albert Abraham Michelson was born in this city on December 19, 1852. He was a professor at the University of Chicago, a Nobel laureate, who, with his famous experiments on the speed of light, started a new era in the development of physics. This plaque was placed to celebrate the foundation of great physics.\" A commemorative plaque in Strzelno, Poland, installed by the Polish Physical Society.\n\nA monument at United States Naval Academy marks the path of Michelson's experiments measuring the speed of light.\n\nSee also"
