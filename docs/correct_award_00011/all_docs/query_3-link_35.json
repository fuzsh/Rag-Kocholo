        "text": "Talented and ambitious from the first, for Indian physicist C. V. Raman, winning the Nobel prize for physics was not so much a distant aspiration as a career plan. He was the first person of colour and the first Asian to receive the award, following the discovery of a light scattering effect that has since become a key characterisation tool in materials science.\n\nPhysics and academia ran in Raman’s family, where he was one of eight siblings. His father was a teacher at the local high school, later moving his family to Andhra Pradesh, where he took on a position in the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College. Raman’s nephew Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar also showed a flair for physics, culminating in the Nobel prize in physics in 1983.\n\nRaman’s own proficiency in physics was recognised early on. He graduated with a BA from the Presidency College at the University of Madras in 1904 aged 16, winning gold medals in both physics and English. He published his first scientific paper as a graduate student aged 18 on “Unsymmetrical diffraction-bands due to a rectangular aperture” in the British journal Philosophical Magazine in 1906.\n\nHowever, health concerns caused him to forgo the chance to pursue his research in England, and he took a post as an accountant in the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta instead.\n\nIn Calcutta, he befriended Asutosh Dey and Amrita Lal Sircar, founder and secretary of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, and Ashutosh Mukherjee, executive member of the institute and vice chancellor of the University of Calcutta. These connections provided access to the necessary resources to continue his research in his spare time.\n\nDespite not having formally been awarded a PhD, he began acquiring research students from the University of Calcutta in 1915, and soon after from several other institutions. He finally took a full professorship at the University of Calcutta in 1917.\n\nAlthough deferred, Raman did make a trip to England, where he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1924 and knighted by the British in 1930. He later joined the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore as its first Indian director in 1933, and founded the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1934, also publishing the academy’s proceedings.\n\nHe was appointed the first National Professor by the new government following India’s independence in 1947 and founded the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore a year later, working there until the day he died in 1970.\n\nDiscovery of the Raman effect\n\nSome of his early work centred around music and acoustics, which, in many ways, laid the path for him to later uncover some of the mechanisms behind light-based phenomena. The first of his more famous breakthroughs came during a trip to England when he was admiring the deep blue of the Mediterranean.\n\nThrough subsequent experiments, he was able to counter the prevailing explanation at the time: that the sea’s colour was merely a reflection of the sky, an explanation offered by Lord Rayleigh, whose discoveries had explained why the sky is blue. Instead, reporting in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London in 1922, Raman explained that “molecular diffraction determines the observed luminosity and in great measure also its colour”.\n\nFrom there followed his discovery of the Raman effect. It was actually his new research associate Kariamanikkam Srinivasa Krishnan who observed an additional scattering line in light scattered by certain liquids, which Raman first described as “feeble fluorescence”.\n\nHe then devised an early spectrograph to measure and photograph the intensity of light at different wavelengths, and was eventually able to conclude that “when matter is excited by light of one colour, the atoms contained in it emit light of two colours, one of which is different from the exciting colour and is lower down the spectrum”.\n\nThis “Raman scattering” is now understood to be caused primarily by molecular vibrations where the chemical bonds stretch and bend in a quantised fashion. Rotations of gas molecules and, in the case of incident light at X-ray frequencies, changes in electron energy can also contribute to Raman scattering.\n\nEssentially, as the incident light bounces off the molecule, it either gives it energy to vibrate (Raman Stokes scattering) or takes energy from its vibrations (anti-Stokes) so that the scattered light has a component with a different frequency and direction. Because molecules can only vibrate in very specific ways, this scattering has a very characteristic spectrum, which describes the intensity of the light at different wavelengths.\n\nIn fact, materials scientists often liken it to a fingerprint. Raman signals are typically weak, but enhancement techniques using resonant structures and lightning rod type effects have made it easier to exploit for identifying materials.\n\nBecoming a Nobel laureate\n\nNever one to undersell his achievements, Raman was sure the discovery merited a Nobel prize, and was consequently a little miffed when the prize was awarded elsewhere in both 1928 and 1929. However, the following year he was so confident he would win, he booked tickets to attend the ceremony in July, four months before the award was announced. As it turns out his money wasn’t wasted. Raman was awarded the 1930 Nobel prize in physics “for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him”.\n\nThe award wasn’t without controversy as it was awarded to him alone, despite the contributions by his research associate Krishnan, as well as independent discoveries of the same effect by Russian physicists Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam at Moscow University."
