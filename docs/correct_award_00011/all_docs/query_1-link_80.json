        "text": "In the spring of 1907, Mittag-Leffler once again went to northern Italy, traveling via Berlin to Lake Como. Signe went with him, both of them making the trip for the sake of their health. Gösta had undergone surgery on his nose at Sofiahemmet Hospital; the stay at Lake Como and the numerous bicycle excursions did him good. He received a visit from Volterra, and he had several discussions with Röntgen, who was also a guest at one of the hotels. Signe enjoyed herself too and was feeling stronger. On their way home, at a first-class hotel in Bordeaux, they celebrated their silver wedding anniversary. Gösta wanted to be home in time for the big Linnaeus anniversary and the celebration at the Academy of Sciences on May 25."
