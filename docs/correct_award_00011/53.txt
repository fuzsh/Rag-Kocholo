In 1869, Albert Michelson began his studies at the U. S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, receiving his appointment from President Grant.

After graduating in 1873, Michelson entered the United States Navy as an Ensign.

Albert Michelson taught physics and chemistry as the Naval Academy from 1875 to 1879.

In 1878, Michelson discovered that light travels at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, later refined to 186,284 miles per second.

This discovery became the basis for Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.

From 1883 to 1889, Michelson taught at Case University in Cleveland.

From 1889 to 1892, Michelson taught at Clark University in Worchester, Massachusetts.

From 1892 to 1928, he was the head of the physics department at the University of Chicago, returning to the Navy during WWI.

In 1907, Albert Michelson won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his optical precision instruments, and the spectroscopic and metrological investigations carried out with their aid.

Albert Michelson was the first American Jew to receive this award.

In 1928, Michelson returned to California to work for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
