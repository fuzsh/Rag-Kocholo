        "text": "CIA WHISTLEBLOWER EXOSING THE ORGANIZED ROLES OF THE CIA, BUSH’S & ROCKEFELLERS\n\nThe following is a powerful sexual abuse victim testimony by; Dr Sue Arrigo.\n\nYet again it points to the CIA and George Bush, as well as the whole criminal cabal running the US Government and associated Corporations and Rockefellers. This may be difficult for some to accept but all the evidence, time after time points to it. The earth and its peoples are a playground for the “elite” criminal cabal of psychopaths ruling our countries.\n\nby Dr. Sue Arrigo, CIA whistleblower and a victim of child sex trafficking herself\n\nPART I:\n\nThis is the story of how the CIA uses “war zones” to garner kids for the sex slave business. You may have heard how the two companies, DynCorp and Halliburton, were caught trafficking in women and children during the war in Yugoslavia.\n\nSome background on this topic can be found at Dyncorp and Halliburton Sex Slave Scandal Won’t Go Away.\n\nhttp://boards.cannabis.com/threads/dyncorp-and-halliburton-sex-slave-scandal-wont-go-away.46204/\n\nPlease see the Rep. Cynthia McKinney Grills Rumsfeld On Dyncorp Sex Rings video:\n\nIn these cases, they were importing and trafficking in Russian and East bloc women as sex slaves.\n\nI want to talk about the children that are native to any war zone. The CIA did this across Africa, and anywhere they went as a standard part of their operations.\n\nThe names of the front companies will change over time. I am writing this down from memory after being inside the CIA for decades. Some of the details may be off, but the gist of the material will be correct.\n\nDr. Sue Arrigo, CIA whistleblower and a victim of child sex trafficking herself\n\nTHE EXPECTED LIFESPAN OF A SEX SLAVE\n\nThe economics of a child being sold into sexual slavery are such that it is very lucrative.\n\nA child in the sex slave business has a useful expected lifetime of two years. They fail to thrive in that setting. They die of disease, neglect, abuse and giving up.\n\nThe kids are killed if they are seriously hurt, refuse to work, or become too jaded to attract customers. They are almost never freed by their owners because they could talk. It is a dead end occupation usually.\n\nChild Sex Trafficker Admits On Camera To Have Killed 400-500 Children\n\nNo one takes a child like that to an ER because the sexual abuse might come to light. They are expendable goods that the owners don’t expect to last anyway. If they are boys, they might grow up up to be a pimp.\n\nSome children run away, but they are often re-captured by other pimps. If they come from another country, they have no papers and poor language skills. If they are picked up by the police, they are detained for months to years and deported, often back to the same war zone.\n\nSome were child soldiers or child spies before being forced into sexual slavery. Even without that, they have disabling Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome intentionally inflicted in them in order to disable them and keep them from being able to run away successfully.\n\nTHE ECONOMICS OF SEX SLAVERY\n\nIf they are transported to a place like New York City, the owner can make about US$50 per hour for about 10 hours a day, roughly US$500 a day or $3,000 a week, which is $150,000 a year.\n\nThe kid’s food costs next to nothing. The owner has to house them. The rent and clothes, etc. are less than $10,000 depending on the location. It is still $140,000 profit per year, or about $300,000 for the expected life span of the child.\n\nThe going price for brothel owners to buy a kid on an auction block in New York City and D.C. is between $500 dollars for a sick kid to $50,000 for a choice virgin who is blond and blue eyed and speaks English.\n\nThe average price for a kid from a war zone is about US$2,000. Then there is about a $10,000 cost to get into the auction at all.\n\n(Note: I have attended a number of these. I used to have a hobby of figuring out how to shut the auction houses down. It is a dangerous hobby. People practicing it are flirting with death. Hopefully, they are good spies or operatives before they try it. For training good spies, it is an intiation practice; like the American Indian practice of slapping a grizzly bear).\n\nThe CIA runs the kids in and sells them in large lots like by the ship full or several hundred on a trainload to the auctioneers. In that regard it is like the CIA drug running,\n\nthe CIA only does the big stuff.\n\nIf you mess with them at that level they order a hit on you without thinking twice. If one interferes with the next level down, after they sold the kids already, they are not so uptight about it — it may not be their financial loss.\n\nGathering the “harvest” of orphans in war zones\n\nThe CIA and its corporate bosses like the Rockefellers and Bushs make about 1,000 USD per kid from a war zone if they sell them to auctioneers. Of that 1,000, the CIA will get about 300, and about 700 will go to the corporate bosses. For drugs the split is more like 15 USD per 100 in profit going to the CIA.\n\nThere is much more money to be made when the bosses keep the kids in their own hands. So the best kids are skimmed off the top and never make it to the auction houses. Kids are skimmed off either because of looks or smarts. A smart kid, like I was, can be a life long asset and make an owner a lot more money.\n\nAbout 1-2 percent of kids are tried that way, as spies or corporate slaves. About 5 percent of the kids are skimmed off by the bosses for looks. The best of these end up as a house boy or girl of a politician that the boss wants to keep happy and controlled. They will also be spying on the politician for the boss. In that position some of these kids make it into adulthood.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL MODELS: HARVESTING THE CHILDREN OF US MILITARY OFFICERS\n\n“Presidential Models” who get trained by the CIA are in that category. Brice Taylor is an example of that. Her books are available at THIS LINK.\n\nShe says that 3,000 women got made into Presidential Sex Slaves per the figure she heard. They are mind control victims.\n\nSee Dr. Colin Ross’s book “Bluebird : Deliberate Creation of Multiple Personality by Psychiatrists” which he wrote after having patients like this and reading 15,000 pages of CIA documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nTheir minds were split using torture at an early age. Mine was split at age 3 to 4. One or more of the parts is often very psychic. There are however much better ways to make accurate psychics without trauma.\n\nPresidential Models often have been trained by the CIA in special ESP skills like having a photographic memory. Other special CIA spy ESP skills they may have been programmed to have include the ability to speak “in tongues” i.e. in any language, the ability to see and hear at a distance, as in clairvoyance and clariaudience) A/K/A remote viewing, shapeshifting, and forecasting the future, including stock prices, etc.\n\nThe CIA needed these skills in spies. Shamans had the skills and the CIA did the R&D to get them. (See John Perkins’ “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man” and “Shapeshifting” books.)\n\nPRIVATE PROFITS FROM TAXPAYER PAID RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)\n\nThe bosses own their own high class call services that make lots of money off of servicing their friendly business men.\n\n(See Washington Post Expose ex-Sen. DeCamp video/writes of FEDERAL OCCULT PEDOPHILIC DRUG/PORN RITUAL MURDERING ELITE)\n\nThis is sometimes associated with an escort type of service allowing children to grow up as well by being charming. But that is really difficult as most of the children are too hardened and jaded after a year or two to carry that off.\n\nIn the highest class settings, the bosses make up to a million dollars a day for the slave’s service. That sounds unbelievable but it is a function of how rich the buyers of the services are and what the skills of a good stock price forecaster are worth to them for a day.\n\nWHITE HOUSE DINNERS – LUCRATIVE PROSTITUTION OF AMERICAN BOYS & GIRLS OF ANY AGE\n\nPresidential models made in CIA mind control fashion, beautiful girls and boys who were charming spies without advanced ESP skills, usually fetched $10,000-30,000 a day for their bosses when used at White House functions.\n\nThe girls would be at the White House dinner and the men would indicate their preferences by talking to them and showing an obvious interest in them.\n\nEither the man was rich enough not to care about the cost until he received the bill later or he was politely informed of the price by having it listed on the bottom of a card placed next to his drink on a silver or gold tray.\n\nIt was up to “the Butler” to know which category the man was in in terms of his wealth and personal preferences.\n\nI usually came into dinner on the arm of the DCI and sat next to him through much of the evening so that he could have me answer his questions as a remote viewer of known accuracy in that personality.\n\nIt was up to him if I was to be surrendered to another man for the evening as it affected national security.\n\nConsider for a moment the usual White House dinner. They range in size from 5 women to about 50 women slaves on a given night.\n\nAt an average profit of $20,000 per night, 5 nets $100,000 and 50 nets $1 million. Not all nights does that happen.\n\nBut roughly the President personally makes a good $30-100 million a year just on the Presidential model sex slaves. That starts to tell you about the conflict of interest in stopping this corrupt system. It has been going on a long time, since about President Kennedy.\n\nPresident Carter is the only exception to the rule that I know of.\n\nSince I personally was forced into the beds of Johnson, VP Nelson Rockefeller, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton and Bush Jr. this is not theoretical for me.\n\nHowever, because I was really a Director of Central Intelligence Model primarily, I ended up mainly in the beds of DCIs from Helms (left) to Tenet (right).\n\nThe $100,000-a-month club to ensure one’s political success through blackmail.\n\nNow let’s talk a little bit about the babies coming out of war zones because I strayed too far into the American children in talking about the escorts for foreign and domestic dignitaries.\n\nWomen are raped in war and often abandon the babies at birth. The CIA helps fund orphanages in the war zones so that it can skim off the kids it wants. The children under 2 usually are too neglected to survive – failure to thrive syndrome.\n\nThe cute ones are bought up by the CIA for the cabal bosses and sold as part of the $100,000 a month club.\n\nRich people like fine wines to show up monthly and this is a variation of that. They are signed up for it almost automatically without any choice in the matter if they attend certain high class estate ceremonies around the world hosted by people like the Rockefellers.\n\nGetting in the door means that you can’t get out it again when the ceremony starts unless you are a very good spy. The ceremony will involve the human sacrifice of some person – often a toddler or young virgin.\n\nThe following articles will shed more light on child sacrifice practices by theLuciferian cabal:\n\nBig Banks Whistleblower: I Was Told To Sacrifice Children At An Illuminati Party\n\nFormer Luciferian (Satanic) Cult Member Exposes the Dark Illuminati Agenda\n\nEx-Model Incarcerated for Exposing Illuminati Child Sacrifice\n\nIlluminati Defector Described Horrifying Satanic Rituals\n\nEuropean Royals Allegedly Killing Children in Human Hunting Parties — 4 Eyewitnesses Testify\n\nEyewitnesses Testify: Pope Francis Allegedly Raped, Trafficked and Killed Children\n\nNew Witnesses Accuse UK Prime Minister of Pedophilia & Ritual Murder\n\nAfter that initiation in the fine art of human sacrifice the guest is expected to carry on that tradition of entrapping others just the same way. Failure to do so is associated with death and blackmail threats. Death can be the result of “accidents.”\n\nFew people are sophisticated enough to know not to get into one of these traps or how to get out of them. They have families and they cave in to the pressure. It then perpetuates itself. They get a baby a month to ritually kill and entrap all the politicians and police chiefs that might try to stop their rise to fame.\n\nREVERSE CHRISTIANITY – THE RELIGION OF PRESIDENTS, POLITICIANS & DCI’s\n\nThey go on practicing Christianity by mouth by day, and satanism by night in their deeds. Some of them are mind controlled by the trauma and drugs at the initial ceremony and do not even know later that they are satanists. Others do know.\n\nI would say that about 20 percent are fully aware that what they are doing is evil and wrong and just don’t know how to stop it. About 50 know what they are doing but deny that it is evil.\n\nThey excuse it as their right to be pagan and uninhibited. Then about 10 percent are full multiples and are clueless during the day as to what is happening at night.\n\nThen about another 20 percent are too lazy and apathic to think about what they are doing. They are just doing it because others do it.\n\nORPHANAGES FUNDED BY THE CIA\n\nLet’s get down to some of the details, where an investigator could start to hit pay dirt, namely Yugoslavia, which had many abandoned babies, many of them light skinned.\n\nThe CIA founded three major orphanages including one of UNESCO’s. The Rockefellers funded four orphanages. There was overlap at one of them which caused some problems. The CIA “talent scouts” came by a week after Rockefeller’s did and that made the nuns suspicious.\n\nIn each case, the nuns were told that the scouts were working for large adoption agencies in the US and the kids were to be quickly processed in a large lot for adoption.\n\nThe local orphanages in Yugoslavia were absolutely swamped. There were tons of babies and large numbers of war orphans, the latter mainly the result of US bombs killing their parents. Some had been dug out of the rubble days later. Many of these kids were extremely traumatized already.\n\nThat saved the CIA some of the work to traumatize them themselves, if they were going to be made into mind control slaves. Some of the bright ones get training to be heads of puppet govt’s later.\n\nThe US sends them back in 20-30 years later as the head of a country or as an important minister.\n\nAny time you hear of a US-educated native of a country returning to it to suddenly assume an important position in its new US-friendly govt. think about this mind control slave possibility. It happens much more often then people realize.\n\nThe CIA and the cabal bosses have been making mind control slaves out of war orphans by the thousands since WWII.\n\nThe CIA has been using children from orphanages since its inception.\n\nRemember that in WW II the UK and US took in Jewish and East bloc refugee children WITHOUT their parents. Their parents were alive the US just didn’t want them.\n\nA woman I know well, who is older than I, ended up training some of the East Bloc orphans picked up by the CIA, not long after the end of WW II. They were trained as child prodigy musicians. Then they were inserted into East Bloc foreign embassies to provide musical and sexual services.\n\nThey spoke the local language and passed as natives. They themselves did not know otherwise. But they had personalities that went to phone booths and called the CIA to report on the actions of their East Bloc “owners” at the embassies. Most of the kids were uncovered and killed by the KGB as “foreign agents.”\n\nThe median time they lasted in the field before discovery and death was about two weeks. Some never made it through their first sonata.\n\nThe KGB figured out the scam after the first couple of months of it.\n\nThe CIA kept on sending in the kids knowing that their operational cover was blown. It did that for another two years just to pretend to its bosses including the Congressional Oversight committee that this was a successful covert operation that justified the CIA’s mind control experiments on children.\n\nI read the reports at the CIA. I was there as a mind control slave for 40 years and I had an interest in the subject in one of my more rebellious personalities.\n\nI never had the heart to tell that woman what actually happened to the kids she helped train as child spies while she was 12. She started training them after the KGB knew about that specific musical ruse at embassies, and after the CIA knew that the KGB knew and was killing them basically on arrival.\n\nI know that is hard to believe. Betrayal of even its own agents is the middle name of the CIA.\n\nThe CIA during the Vietnam War sent thousands of South Vietnamese spies into North Vietnam after it knew that this secret route into the North was blown and the men were ending up being tortured and killed.\n\nThe US got caught betraying their agents because it refused to pay the promised death benefits to the families. Some of the men who later returned after years of horrendous torture sued the CIA. They won a settlement on it.\n\nI remember reading about it a long time ago in Time or Newsweek Magazine. Talk about betrayal. It is the middle name of most intelligence agencies.\n\nAgencies are not run to protect their country’s citizens but to make big bucks for the overlords.\n\nChild Sex Trafficking through Child ‘Protection’ Services Exposed – Kidnapping Children for Sex\n\nThe CIA betrayed Korean children and sent them to almost certain death. The CIA is an equal opportunity “employer” who likes to pay nothing at all whenever possible for its spies.\n\nHere is a little reality check for you on the subject of the US’s use of child spies from Aldrich’s book “The Hidden Hand” in the chapter on the Korean war:\n\n“US intelligence (CIA-DIA unit) Combined Command for Recon Activities, Korea = CCRAK decided to try short penetrations with individual Koreans; inserted 50 miles behind the lines and armed only with a pistol, they were expected to make their way back to their own lines, gathering military information en route.\n\nSenior officers conceded that only about a third of those inserted would return, but they expected “some really good information.”\n\nAnderson, who had direct experience in Korea was less sanguine. Skepticism turned to dismay when he learned that those selected for insertion were fresh recruits and would have 7 days to prepare for their mission. It was clear that these agents were regarded as expendable in the extreme.\n\nWhen the ’15 specially selected Koreans’ he had been promised arrived at Anderson’s facility for training, he could scarcely believe his eyes.\n\nPathetic and malnourished, they were mostly shy rustic youths in their teens, some as young as 15. A week was enough for them to master the use of basic firearms, but they ‘had only the haziest idea of the parachute drill’.\n\nAccompanying his ‘agents’ as far as their dropping zones triggered a sense of black depression:\n\nNever before had I taken unprepared men into battle and now I was about to do something far worse. I was sending untrained men into the most frightening and lonely of battles…the cold night air rushed in through the open jump door…\n\nThe fourth hesitated and was pushed by those behind, and so the procession of fear went on until the fuselage was empty but for myself…\n\nFor one wild moment I longed to jump after them and, like the ancient Mariner, felt that I ‘had done a hellish thing’.” (Page 284 of the Hidden Hand)\n\nIn regard to that dropping Korean teenagers behind enemy lines story, that was the tip of the iceberg. Eisenhower liked the idea, as did other US intel people back in Japan.\n\nThey dropped at least 10 per week, week after week, even though none of the ten sometimes were ever heard of again.\n\nAfter 2,000 to 4,000 teenagers later they decided the intelligence was worthless and called it off. I thought you should know the end of the story.\n\nHOW TO SPOT CIA USE OF ORPHANAGES IN A WAR ZONE\n\nBack to the orphanages in Yugoslavia…\n\nParents want to adopt want 1 kid not 100 at a time. Anytime more than 3 kids move out of an orphanage at a time, a red flag should go up in someone’s mind. The scouts go in and pick out dozens to hundreds at a time.\n\nA CIA scout looking for bright kids might even have them all tested by bringing a psychologist along and say that they are testing the kid’s ability to adapt after the war.\n\nOr they might say that they are studying any number of problems that these kids have, while really they are looking for talent.\n\nSome CIA operatives looking for sex slaves audition kids by having them do blow jobs on local officials on a special outing for the poor orphans. Those kids that are the best at socializing and sucking to stay alive, win a trip to the US. Yes, they do win a trip to the US — but as sex slaves. They are unlikely to ever take a walk in nature again.\n\nSo an investigator should look for who moved kids out of orphanages in batches, who took them on “field trips” or tested them first. Forget about the innocence of foundations.\n\nThe UN, the Girl Scouts of America, the Catholic Church etc. can all be used as fronts for despicable deeds by greedy bosses.\n\nHere is an example of the US Sex Slave trade in Bosnia from my first hand experience —\n\nOne of the worst scams that I know of in Yugoslavia during the US take-over wars in the 1990’s involved an orphanage in Bosnia near Sarajevo.\n\nI kept looking for a reference on it in Canadian General MacKenzies’s autobiography of his time there as head of the UN Humanitarian effort.\n\nReport Finds UN Employs 3,300 Pedophiles, Responsible for 60,000 Rapes in Last 10 Years\n\nThe UN Is Normalizing Pedophilia: The Deep State Is Free to Prey Upon Your Children\n\nI knew that he knew of the incident because I called him on the phone to report it to him and ask him to intervene.\n\nYet I could not find one word of it in his biography — that is how whitewashed the world is of these sex abuse scandals involving US politicians.\n\nI had an assignment in Bosnia shortly before MacKenzie got there. The fighting in that region came later. I was assigned to set up an orphanage for the CIA. They wanted this really big facility built, ten to twenty times as large as anyone could believe was needed for that area.\n\nMy job was just to arrange to buy the land for the building of this big new “Catholic School” for children. The problem was that there were no schoolrooms in the plan, just endless dormitories.\n\nThe CIA wanted 10 acres of dormitories for kids. It looked more like a concentration camp for kids. And they wanted it built next to the train line. That train line to the coast was about the only thing in Sarevjo that did not get hit by bombs and artillery and continued working.\n\nRegular people could not get out of the war zone. MacKenzie’s book shows that very plainly. Planes flew in supplies but the UN did not protect anyone or get anyone out. Those kids were not going to parents and to safety; they were going to sexual humiliation, torment, and eventually their deaths.\n\nNow, I am a remote viewer. I could see what would happen to those kids if I helped the CIA buy land and build that facility so I came back empty handed.\n\nThe reason the CIA asked me to buy the land and not some regular person was that they wanted a piece of land that would be “defensible and not fall into enemy hands” — so they wanted a forecaster.\n\nAN AUSCHWITZ JUST FOR CHILDREN\n\nThe CIA sent out someone else the next month. That person was not a remote viewer and did not know what would happen to kids if they got there. He bought 14 acres of land, and the CIA built its concentration camp for orphans, complete with barbed wire and control towers with armed guards carrying machine guns. An investigator could check this.\n\nAll that happened before a single shot was fired to start that war in Bosnia. MacKenzie notes in his autobiography that when he arrived in Yugoslavia to help protect Croats, he was forced by the UN to open his office in Bosnia hundreds of miles away where nothing was happening – YET.\n\nIt was already planned back at the CIA. The CIA had already bought the land to house the children that they planned to sell into sexual slavery.\n\nRemember that each child that gets sold into sexual slavery makes about $700 for the bosses if sold at auction, about $300,000 over its 2-year lifespan if the boss houses it in a brothel in the US, and millions of dollar if it can be raised in the US and turned into a “presidential model” or a “puppet government model” — if it is male. And all the training, transport, etc. is paid for by the US taxpayer to torture these children into compliance.\n\nOh, yes, and don’t forget the $100,000 for the babies in the $100,000 a month ritual sacrifice category.\n\nKnowing all that, I think that you can envision what that 14 acres looked like. It looked like Auschwitz.\n\nRow after row of barracks for housing children and an small army of childcare workers.\n\nNow I am exaggerating slightly here, because there was a playground and even a baseball diamond included.\n\nIt was built to house 5,000 children, but at the peak of its use per CIA records I saw at Langley it had 12,000 children. The CIA was interested not in having the children there but in moving them.\n\nThe CIA did research studies to see why it took an average of 2 months to move any given child out of there. It wanted them sorted and transported faster than that. The bottleneck was in shipping them by boat out of the war zone.\n\nThe ships were privately owned by front companies in order to give plausible deniability. The private companies did not want to dock that close to the fighting.\n\nThe CIA tried to solve the problem by helping them get cheap insurance that covered wartime loses (i.e. taxpayers subsidized the shipping of the sex slaves for the bosses).\n\nThat helped some but crews for those ships were reluctant to sign on once they knew its true destination.\n\nThe CIA helped the private bosses shanghai some crews — by kidnapping and enslaving mariners.\n\nThe Skull and Bones pirate origins of the CIA and the Cabal bosses were really showing in that maneuver. But that weakness in shipping the sex slaves stateside for the Bones’ Bosses remained a problem for the CIA during the Bosnian war.\n\nHow many children were shipped out of Yugoslavia to be enslaved during the course of the war? The CIA put the number at over a million over the period of the Yugoslavian wars (1992-1999).\n\nThat includes other pick-up centers than this one. Even if one only made $1000 on the average per kid, that is a billion dollar business.\n\nNow you see why the CIA took the trouble of building that concentration camp for kids. They built it before the war started because it is harder to build anything once the shooting starts. So it stood empty during the first 6 months of its existence because the CIA was having trouble igniting the war in Bosnia.\n\nIt was behind schedule and that is why MacKenzie couldn’t see the war and any need for him to be in Bosnia when he was moved into place.\n\nAny competent investigative journalist should be able to find the location of that camp and interview some of its small army of childcare workers. The ships carried all those kids away; someone loaded them.\n\nThe CIA and the UN worked together to enslave the children and not rescue them.\n\nI called MacKenzie from the CIA’s Headquarters because the CIA was training some of them as child soldiers to hit MacKenzie’s headquarters and I thought he should know. The CIA did that because MacKenzie actually wanted to help a few people survive that war.\n\nThat was not on the boss’s agenda, unless they were slaves making them a profit. The 30 odd children that the CIA trained as saboteurs to bomb MacKenzie’s building never got used because of that call I made.\n\nThe CIA recorded the call and called off the attack. But MacKenzie did not do what I wanted and report the CIA’s enslavement of the children to the UN.\n\nI had called the UN about it and they said that MacKenzie had to report it because my report was “unsubstantiated hearsay.” Here I am standing in CIA headquarters with CIA documents on this all over my desk, but whatever I say is discounted because they are too scared to take action. I hung up the phone and cried.\n\nTen minutes later there was a knock on my door inviting me to go down to the CIA’s basement for another torture session. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what was going on, it was just that the rest of the world did not want to hear it and act.\n\nANOTHER AUSCHWITZ FOR CHILDRFEN IN MOZAMBIQUE\n\nLet’s look at another wartime example that I was personally involved in. This one was in the war in Mozambique in the late 1980’s, a few years earlier.\n\nI was asked to look at that war remotely from the Pentagon’s War Room. The Soviet Union had not yet fallen. Blacks were dying in Mozambique in a US-Soviet proxy war.\n\nThat is, Rockefeller was selling weapons to both sides and provoking both intelligence agencies to increase the intensity of the fighting. It was good for arms sales. It was good for the sex slave business.\n\nHe kept his promise to the forces of darkness to rape, pillage, and destroy as much as is humanly possible to do so throughout the world.\n\nI was in the War Room because the CIA sent me over to look for a mole in the Pentagon.\n\nSome Soviet defector had said that a US general was one and the CIA sent out a psychic spy (me) to find and capture him. The place to hang out with and watch US generals is in the War Room.\n\nIt was a place that I had been in and out of since I was 15 and sent in to spy on General Westmoreland both in and out of bed to find out why he was not winning the Vietnam War.\n\nIn short, it was my second home away from home as a US mind-control spy. The US military had trained me starting at age 12 at Miramar base in San Diego in military tactics and I was used often to remotely view wars. So that was my cover as I looked for the Soviet run general.\n\nWhile I was viewing the war in Mozambique I noticed a US run training camp for child soldiers. The average age of the kids was 13. Some were as young as 9 or 10, and some were old worn out veterans of the war at age 16. These were boys.\n\nNext door in a barbed wire compound were the girls of all ages, from babies, to age about 12. The older girls had already been shipped out into sexual slavery.\n\nThere were no black adults to be seen around. I wondered about that for a while. Then I saw why that was.\n\nThe CIA guards at those facilities did not want the black adults to know what was going on there so they had set up and maintained road blocks on all the roads coming into that about 50 square mile area which was informally known as the “children’s base.”\n\nThe number of boys that I saw being trained there was in the thousands, and the number of girls in the adjacent compound, a few hundred. Each girl was holding a baby in her arms even if she was only 4 years old and still there were babies laying listlessly on the ground by themselves.\n\nThere was no housing, just a wire enclosure like for a herd of cows. The boys had a shed for housing the machine guns to keep them dry if it rained, but nothing for themselves.\n\nThat all made me feel quite sad. I cry easily and so I started crying in the War Room.\n\nThe generals did not know why I was crying.\n\nFrom their point of view the war was going well. There were dead bodies to prove it. There were even the right number of flies on the dead bodies on the pictures coming back from the field to show that these bodies were freshly killed and not from yesterday’s kill.\n\nYes, the war was going along and my tears were not appropriate to a war room one of the generals came up and told me.\n\nHe said, “Save your tears for the US dead and hope that you never have to see that day. By the grace of God we will have them [colored folk] all killed before that day comes.”\n\nI started crying harder. I could see where that general was going to end up in Hell.\n\nIt made the life of a sex slave like me look like paradise by comparison.\n\nThat is one of the serious problems I have as a remote viewer—I know too much from a great number of different perspectives.\n\nTo explain my tears I started telling him about the children I was viewing. He told me the US doesn’t have any child soldiers. I asked him why he believed that and he said because all the pictures they received back from the war were of adult deaths.\n\nI asked him who supplied the pictures. He said the CIA and the DIA. I said “See, that proves my point. You don’t know.” He refused to concede the point.\n\nI came the next day with the proof from CIA headquarters about that specific children’s base I had viewed in Mozembique. I brought CIA photos of the children and CIA reports of their military training.\n\nThen he said to me, “The CIA has no right to train them, only we in the Army know how to train soldiers.” He didn’t care that they were children. He only cared about preserving the Army’s turf.\n\nThen to shock him out of his intentional ignorance, I showed him the CIA report on the girls and their being sold into sexual slavery. He was outraged that I would show him such smut. There were some pictures of what the girls had been trained to do in a short period of time, including doing blow jobs.\n\nThe CIA authors of the paper had bragged about how well they had trained these girls in preparation for their new careers and supplied the pictures to prove it. The general refused to let this material affect his view of the US as honorable.\n\nIt was only when I showed him the CIA report and figures on the money made on the sales of weapons and sex slaves that he conceded that the war was corrupt. And that really only happened because I showed him the list of bosses and how much each one had made in the war.\n\nOne of the bosses was a man he had had some run ins with personally. When he saw that man’s name he said, “It figures. He always was a bastard.”\n\nI did find the “mole” that the defector mentioned. He was a US general who did know about the sex slave trade run by the US. He just didn’t know about the Soviet run sex slave trade. He had given the Soviet some very minor secrets for free, thinking it would help shut down the Mozambique and other African wars. It had not unfortunately.\n\nSo then I had to run some information into the US war room about the Soviet use of child soldiers and sex slaves to help them keep a balanced picture. The US general got a slap on the wrist. The children got no help whatsoever.\n\nThe US generals knew the truth but refused to help. I went back to the CIA and cried in private in the woman’s restroom. I couldn’t cry about what had happened to me at the hands of the CIA and bosses repeatedly throughout my life. But I could feel the suffering of other children and know that what was happening to them was wrong.\n\nSHIPPING SEX SLAVES\n\nLet’s talk about the shipping of sex slaves since it is a bottleneck in the sex slave trade. We can try to make it more of a bottleneck by exposing it. It is obvious that human cargo is never listed on the ship’s cargo list.\n\nSo how do you know which ships are carrying the sex slaves? For a remote viewer the answer is easy — one looks inside the ships from anywhere in the world and one sees the bodies of the slaves.\n\nOne can train one’s mind to highlight the ships carrying sex slaves in hot-pink, if one likes. It is not a hard thing to do even for a novice viewing. Any of the naval officers I trained could do that after a week’s training as a remote viewer. But I am going to tell you clues for spotting such shipping that a regular investigative journalist would find helpful.\n\nMost people assume that all ships coming into a harbor are logged in and registered. That is simply not true.\n\nThere is a whole system set up for smugglers and regardless of what they are smuggling it is the same — drugs, sex slaves, art treasures, landmines, chemical weapons, etc..\n\nWhen a ship first comes in and makes contact with the harbor authorities by radio, it has to give the right signal or it will be bordered by the coast guard as an “illegal” vessel. When it radios, it indicates to the harbor authorities whether it wants to be inspected or not and how perishable its “fruit” is.\n\nAny shipper in the “legal” loop knows the informal code that indicates whether the ship is clean and can be inspected to make the harbor authorities and the shipping co. look good, or is dirty and should not be inspected for those same reason.\n\nIt is all just a big game. I used to have my naval remote viewing students play a game in which they screwed up the radio communications for the harbor using their minds.\n\nI scored it a win if they could get a dirty ship inspected and get away with it. It was a bit like the American Indian game of slapping a grizzly bear. It was fun, but dangerous. They were training to be spies so they wanted a bit of danger. It is not a beginner’s game. Beginners should clip the wings on the trade after the goods are sold to the free-lancers.\n\nHaving one or more independent brothel owners mad at you is not too bad. You can go to the police if they give you trouble.\n\nOver 75 percent of sex slaves end up in the hands of the independent brothel owners so it is definitely a worthwhile part of the trade to target in terms of saving lives.\n\nHowever, the bosses that skim off the top 10 percent of the children make more like 90 percent of the profits. It is like designer clothes — that is where the big profit margins are made. In both cases, one is paying more for an illusion of being rich and famous, than you are for the goods themselves.\n\nIf one wants goods shipped off the record it goes “by the way.” That is code slang for “off the record.”\n\nOne throws it into the shipping conversation. Suppose I at the CIA want to ship a load of goods to Iraq for “reconstruction” purposes. I call up almost any shipper in the world and say for instance, ‘I want to send 17 “boxes” of construction goods, and “by the way” two bodies to look after them. Make sure they arrive safely, you know.’\n\nThe shipper then knows that there will be not two people, but two box containers, each containing many girls and boys. But the usual instruction to the shipper is more like “be sure they arrive in not too bad condition” because they want a high spoilage rate, but for some of them to survive.\n\nAnother way I have heard this phrased is, “deliver it ripe but not spoiled” as if one was talking about bananas. The shippers know what the bosses want — they are paid big bribes to know.\n\nThe conversation is like an insider’s language. You have to know it and not slip up on it to place the order to move them. But it is all done plain text, not in encrypted format.\n\nMuch of it is done on cell phones and is not secure at all, anyone could listen in. As soon as I send this to you it may be changed. The point is that an investigator could listen to shipping conversations for awhile and quickly figure out the system.\n\nIt is a system that is worldwide and involves thousands of people that the CIA does not want to send out new memos every week giving them a new code system because that would wreck the plausible deniability and the people loading the containers on the docks would have to learn a new system every week.\n\nIf the CIA goes to such a formal process, that will be easy to expose because any dock worker will be able to tell you that he is being given new terminology to use. The reason that sex slaves and renditions go on is because the average person is not watching the docks and the airports.\n\nIt only takes paying attention, not any special intelligence training to figure out that planes without other markings except a series of numbers and letters are CIA planes carrying people to black detention centers.\n\nAverage people paying attention threw a monkey wrench into the CIA’s kidnapping of people.\n\nAny investigator who was willing to pay some dockworkers under the table would be told what the system is.\n\nChild Trafficking is a Single Worldwide Operation Coordinated by the CIA (Documentary)\n\nHere is the way I would do it if I were an investigator to do it safely…\n\nGo to a dock and watch what the dockers are wearing as they go into bars. Dress according. Then walk into a bar that is near a dock and make some friends drinking.\n\nDon’t ask the questions in the bar that is a little too dangerous because of too many ears, some of them protective of their bosses. Invite a couple of your friends to a party at your hotel room. Listen to their problems for a while and then feel them out.\n\nMost of these dockers do not like having to load human cargo. The smell of urine and feces inside gives it away. Water has to either go in on a two-week trip or be in containers on the inside. The water is almost always drugged.\n\nSome of the people inside the containers die. It is intentional. The percent that die is called the spoilage rate.\n\nThe brothel owners want to buy children from a spoilage rate of 40 percent on up so that they can get kids too traumatized to resist or try to run away. The stench can be dreadful.\n\nDockers sometimes vomit as these containers get unloaded — that is how bad it is. Sometimes, they hose the containers down inside before they go into the harbor so that the smell does not give them away. But then they have to deal with the dead bodies that they find inside.\n\nNo one wants dead bodies floating into the harbor so they either toss them out the day before they get to the harbor, or they have to weight the bodies down to sink them closer in. In any case there are a lot of people who know what is going on — either by the smell or by trying to combat the smell.\n\nThose human cargo containers are often unloaded as far away as possible from the public’s nose. Sometimes they are unloaded next to fishing vessels to confuse the nose.\n\nAmateurs could easily train their dogs to sniff them out, if their own noses were not so good. Look for any dock unloading area which is long past a gate as distance is the major way that the smell is hidden.\n\nIn Vancouver for instance, there are very long docks far out in the bay far from where an unauthorized person can drive.\n\nThe human cargo has to be unloaded in a wherehouse (sic) and cleaned up. It is not like other cargo that can just be loaded straight onto trucks or rail cars because of the recurring stench problem. The wherehouse will thus have hoses and drains in their floors.\n\nMost of the auction “houses” are held in these wherehouses and the buyers are responsible for the next phase of transport onto shore. So a ship comes in, containers are moved into a wherehouse.\n\nA lot of personnel swarm in, water is seen coming out the bottom of the wherehouse for at least 10 minutes as kids are washed inside. Then and only then, after the smell is dealt with, there is a sudden influx of rich men in fancy cars and limos and a bunch of usually unmarked vans without windows.\n\nThe investigator should write down the license plates of all vehicles and make sure that if the investigator suddenly disappears, many people would send them to the police, and human rights organizations.\n\nOne can’t rely just on the police or FBI as the people at the top rungs of those are usually already bought off or blackmailed. One has to rely a lot on informal networks or NGO’s [ Non-Governmental Organization(s) ~ GLA].\n\nEven organizations like the ACLU often have on its board or at its head people who have been “Rockefeller” or “Carnegie” Scholars, or CIA operatives. Some of these people are mind control slaves themselves. They sound good but when you test whether you actually respond appropriately you find out differently.\n\nOrdinary Quakers and other activists are of sometimes more helpful. It has to almost all be done informally. As soon as something is formalized, the CIA moves people in to try to stall it in some way. It all has to be done very ethically and non-violently.\n\nAs soon as someone suggests something the least bit unethical or aggressive, throw them out of your life — they are likely an agent provocateur that could lead you into being labeled a terrorist.\n\nSlave auctions happen fast. People want to be in and out in under two hours max. It is not unusual for the whole thing to take 45 minutes including putting the kids in the vans. The vans are pulled into the wherehouse and loaded inside.\n\nA man wins the auction bid, and has his security man pull the van in and load it and then back it out. He doesn’t want to have “loose cargo” sitting out there for long. The kids are drugged up on the ships but they are coming out of it during the auction so that the buyers can see what kind of personality they have and whether they are going to attract customers.\n\nAs soon as a “lot” of kids, usually 10 to 100 are sold, they are given oral drugs again and loaded into the vans. But it takes up to 10 minutes for the drugs to sedate them again and in that amount of time they can do a fair amount of damage inside a van or make a fair amount of noise.\n\nSome kids are killed in this process because stun guns are used too much or they are given too much of a drug. What drug they are given will depend on how long they have to be transported in the next leg of their journey.\n\nRoutinely the kids are naked the whole time. The vans are often naked inside too, with easy to hose out features. Slavers used to use U-Haul and Ryder vans, but those companies got wind of it and basically managed to get out of it by tightening their rules on recording the driver’s licenses and credit card numbers of the renters. That was all it took, forcing their own workers to follow their policies, to force the slavers to buy their own vehicles.\n\nThat means that their own vehicle license plate numbers are a weak point for them. If the buyers are front organizations for the bosses and the CIA, then those license plates may be “unregistered” — fakes that do not link up to a real name anywhere in the world. But the numbers still help one track the trade, just like the numbers on the rendition planes.\n\nIf the van owners are free lance brothel owners — then those vehicle numbers may go to a person who the police might be willing to prosecute in the sex slave business. Like in the drug trade, the police will prosecute the free-lancers to make it look like they are doing their jobs.\n\nThe free lancers are often fairly obvious — they are less rich and more varied in appearance both personally and in their vehicles. The rich often buy a vehicle, use it for a few months and then turn around and sell it for another purpose. The VIN numbers could be a problem for them even though the plates are false.\n\nHowever, almost all of the vehicles that the rich use to transport the sex slaves on land in the US are made at one plant in the US. That plant in in Atlanta, I believe. It is the only plant that make vans with holes in the bottom of an enamel type of floor.\n\nCattle do not have to be hidden in transport, so this combination of having to be hidden and having to be hosed down and needing some ventilation but good sound-proofing is almost unique in the automotive industry.\n\nOver 80 percent of those vehicles are bought for the slave trade originally. They are bought in lots of 100 or more by the bosses. Putting pressure on that auto manufacturer not to produce those vehicles would slow down the sex slave trade. I believe that it is Chevrolet that makes those vehicles.\n\nThere is a legitimate use for those vehicles, but those people have another vehicle that meets their needs and most of them buy that alternative anyway. My mind has a little trouble bring[ing] this information up which is why there are long lead ins before I get to the point.\n\nI have been to that factory in Atlanta. A Rockefeller took me because he wanted the vehicles re-designed and he wanted my opinion on the plant engineer’s plans and whether the price could be brought down. I was there for about 2 hours in the 1980’s.\n\nIt was during the Iran Contra hearings and I had to get back to testify in them in a closed door session in the afternoon. So we had flown down in a private jet in the morning, and then taken a chopper out to the plant. It was a very short ride. It felt like we just got up in the air and landed again.\n\nThe requirement of needing good drainage and needing soundproofing were almost contradictory. The engineer had wanted the kids just to be better drugged so that soundproofing wasn’t needed. That was an unrealistic expectation on his part but he had to hear it from a doctor to understand why and I guess that that was why that Rockefeller had me flown down to talk to the engineer.\n\nIn the face of the importance of the Iran Contra hearings to the CIA, it is interesting that that Rockefeller was able to cart me off to deal with a sex slave transport problem. I think that tells you something about how much of a bottle neck that was on the Rockefeller fortunes and also how well they believe that they had the congress already bound up as good slaves themselves.\n\nOK, so when one sees a van of this type drive up to a dock, it is extremely likely that it is carrying sex slaves. It would cost the bosses a lot to have the vans redesigned to look differently.\n\nSo groups of concerned citizens could put a dent in having sex slaves brought into their communities by watching the docks and recording the license plate numbers of the vans driving out onto these long docks.\n\nWriting letters to the manufacturer or staging protest demonstrations outside the plant and demanding the list of corporate buyers of these vans would also be useful.\n\nThe vans — let’s see if I can adequately tell you what they look like so that you could recognized one when you see one. They come in a couple of different sizes. The biggest carries a 100 slaves. The smallest about 20, drugged and thrown in on the floor. That is not very big. They are really Ryder sized vans. But they have no over-the-cab van space as no kids go up in such a space.\n\nThe insides are a plain rectangle. The outside walls are about a foot thick and they are rounded on the outside. Their floors are surprisingly low to the ground like Ryders because the drugged kids are heavy and no one wants to lift them up, if one doesn’t have to. It almost always happens that some of the kids do not wake up between the ships and the vans.\n\nThe ships carrying such cargo almost always get first priority for unloading at a harbor. You can almost tell which ships are carrying “by the way” cargo by how fast they get unloaded.\n\nThe harbor authorities are usually well aware of what cargoes they are not supposed to inspect and want them out of the way as soon as possible so that the DEA does not find them and give them, the harbor authorities any trouble. Almost everyone in the harbor authorities is on-the-take from the bosses.\n\nIn fact, how they could get such a job without the approval of the bosses and their agencies is beyond me. It would have to be a bureaucratic snafu or a small harbor not to have an adequate control system in place.\n\nSince only about 2-4 % of all shipping containers are inspected anyway, it is not hard for the harbor authorities to avoid inspecting the “by the way” cargo. The job of the harbor authorities is to prevent competition from “illegals” — all those that the bosses do not authorize.\n\nIt is a monopoly system. The bosses sent up corporate agreements with their friends to share the trade and everyone else is considered an illegal. The distinction is entirely arbitrary. An illegal could sign an agreement with a boss and be legal next week. Or a legal could piss a boss off, and next week be an illegal. This is the way the world really works at this moment in history.\n\nBut I forced the “by the way” cargo off the Naval vessels by training Naval officers in remote viewing and then watching them to make sure that they didn’t let that cargo on board ship without having to answer to me for it. So I do know what it takes to clean up the shipping because I did it in one corner of shipping.\n\nBut the US Navy is not a small enterprise. It has a lot of ships and carries a lot of cargo. So to do [it] in that size of outfit is no small feat. On the other hand I had the support of most of the Admirals and of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) at the time and the status equivalent of a rear admiral.\n\nSince I have not been embedded in US intelligence and military operations since Aug. 2004, the Navy ships may have gone back to carrying “by the way” cargo.\n\nBut while I was at the ONI from 1993-2004, part-time I managed to free it from the control of the bosses including by making it financially independent of their control. I trained Naval officers on how to invest money cleanly and how to watch financial transactions to find corruption. It is possible to do. The results are good.\n\nThat type of “accounting” just needs to be generalized worldwide. I believe that even the bosses will eventually accept a clean system, because it will be to their advantage to do so.\n\nEveryone uses cars and planes these days, even those people who used to own horse buggy cabby monopolies in New York City. Technological advances over ran their monopolies.\n\nIn the case of remote viewing, it is a technological advance in intelligence that in overrunning the old ways of intelligence of blackmail, force, and corruption. Working from the truth of the Akashic records using ethical methods is much more effective then cronyism and cooking intelligence in getting results, even if you still had the some goal of making money.\n\nThe old system has been outclassed. To go on using it is to keep using horse drawn buggies after the arrival of cars. It will be done for a while and then the car will be bought and rule until the next improvement comes along.\n\nThe reason I am sure that intelligence will go this way is because my remote viewing skills were so sought after and fetched such high prices. Tenet used to complain while I was in his bed that most of the phone calls were for me not for him. That was true because in any emergency, the person calling wanted a fast answer and an effective strategy.\n\nIf they talked to Tenet, he asked me what to do anyway. So by asking for me first it saved them time and effort. It is actually much faster and more effective to just see the correct thing to do, than to try to force people to do the wrong thing. The same phenomenon happened when I was with a Rockefeller at his office.\n\nIf another banker or CEO wanted to set up a deal and there wasn’t much time, he would ask to speak to me instead of Rockefeller. I could see the right deal for the two to them to make better than they could even if they spent a week together. Then Rockefeller signed the papers without talking to the man. He was going to have me draw up the agreements and the lawyers put it in legalese anyway.\n\nOnce this happened so fast that Rodman Rockefeller did not even know later that he had just bought a big company. The DCI needed me back at the CIA immediately. It was a year before Rodman really figured out that he owned that company because he didn’t keep up with his homework. In just this way, the old system will be bypassed because it lacks effectiveness and satisfaction.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that more than sex and drugs, people want to be free of their internal doubts and torments. Men paid a lot more to see me than the White House beauties for that reason. A really stunning girl went for 30,000 a day and Rockefeller was getting 30 times that for me.\n\nPeople want truth and to solve the real problems in their life even more that they want sex and drugs. People had sex with me because they were looking for more out of life than they had and didn’t know how to get it. Once a person has the truth and internal satisfaction, sex and drugs are barely of interest to them anymore.\n\nOnce one learns how to be full of joy and contentment even under torture, one has something that is truly priceless. One has everything one needs, without needing anything at all. It is a type of freedom that few people even know exists.\n\nPart II\n\nHow can we shine the light on this problem of sexual slavery so brightly that it vanishes under the exposure?\n\nSuppose I told you that a particular Supreme Court Justice was getting kick backs on the sex slave business from the White House and told you how I knew that was true?\n\nLet us go back to the 2000 election. I believe that Bush got into office because the Supreme Court was paid in favors and in money.\n\nWhat I am alleging is a conflict of interest on the part of at least one Supreme Court Justice. Others of them might be involved as well. It is against the standards of legal practice for a justice not to recuse himself if he has financial ties to the members of a case.\n\nWhen Bush got into office, all of the cabal that backed him and whose fortunes rose with him are members of the case.\n\nNow my having been a sex slave to the Bushs and the Rockefellers is how I know this information. Since I was tortured periodically by Bush, Sr., Rockefellers and their henchmen, I was under considerable duress to do as they said.\n\nExposed: George Bush Pedophile Sex Ring and Blackmail of Congress\n\nI was not a free agent.\n\nRockefeller had me reviewing financial transactions he made as I am a mathematician with some usual and valuable skills. About a year before the 2000 election I flagged a particular transaction, or rather set of transactions as likely to prove highly problematic in the future. I recommended that they promptly be reversed. David Rockefeller declined saying that it would lead to too much trouble.\n\nThe transactions were a series of 6 payments to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The payment amounts were large and curious. They were formed only of 6’s and were progressive. It was like a person with a mathematical obsession was trying to inform the Justice of their problem in a creative way.\n\nThe first check was for 66 dollars. The second was for 666. The next was for 6,666. The fourth was for 66,666. The fifth for 666,666 and the final one was for 6,666,666.\n\nSo we are speaking of a total payment of over 7.5 million dollars which is not a trivial amount to show up in a Justice’s bank account in a period of one week. Now I said these were checks and that is not entirely accurate. It was a bank transfer that was listed as if it was a check on the statement. But there was no paper trail of checks to back it up.\n\nThe transfers came from a David Rockefeller account at his bank to the Justice’s account at that same bank. That bank is one whose records I have monitored for years for unusual transactions per Rockfeller’s orders. Substantial assets of it [‘that’ bank] are the direct result of the sex slave business, mostly from the US side of it.\n\nFor instance, when Rockefeller charged a man a million for my services, a million was received from that man by the bank the next day or two . That was a recurrent and predictable result of my spreading my legs and my mind as Rockefeller’s slave.\n\nI had been in and out of Rockefeller estates and beds as their slave since I was 16 and DCI Helms ordered it. I said to David Rockerfeller who was hard of hearing;\n\n“DAVID, WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU THINKING OF WHEN YOU SENT THOSE SUMS OF MONEY OVER TO THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE?” He appeared not to have heard me because he replied “I was thinking of you, my dear.”\n\nUndeterred, I repeated my question louder and closer to his ear;\n\n“DAVID, WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU THINKING OF WHEN YOU SENT THOSE SUMS OF MONEY OVER TO THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE?”\n\nThis time he looked at me quizzically and said, “Did I forget to put my hearing aid in?”\n\nHe never put it in in the morning before he got out of bed. I moved the cream colored satin sheet off my naked body and got up and got him his hearing aid and after he put it in I repeated my question for the third time.\n\n“DAVID, WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU THINKING OF WHEN YOU SENT THOSE SUMS OF MONEY OVER TO THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE?”\n\nHe said to me “You don’t have to yell at me. I can hear perfectly well.” Meanwhile both the butler and the maid had come to see what the ruckus was about and became witnesses to the answer he gave me. He said, “I wanted him to know who his boss at the Supreme Court was so I sent him the message in a way that I knew he would get it. And don’t forget it. I am your boss too.”\n\nBeing a good slave, I kissed his naked thigh playfully and told him that I would never forget the he was my boss if he would explain to me, a simpleton, why he sent 6 transactions when the last one would have conveyed the same message.\n\nHe looked off at the distance for a moment and then asked me “Don’t you get it?”\n\nThe maid and the butler were both still posed at the edge of the bed awaiting his orders, if there were to be any.\n\n“No,” I said as innocently as possible. “Why?”\n\n“You know why.” He said somewhat angrily. “The devil can not refuse a request when asked 6 times.”\n\n“Asking him what?” I asked.\n\n“Asking him to do whatever I want.” he said somewhat nastily. And then in case I was too simple to have understood. He said. “I want him to serve my interests. I have paid him to serve my interests and that is that. He will do as I say from now on.”\n\nMonths passed and the elections votes were counted and left uncounted both. The case went to the Supreme Court. No more than a month after that I was in that man’s David’s bed again in order to avoid his guards torturing me yet once again. He had his hearing aid in. We were in DC at a White House dinner under Clinton earlier in the evening.\n\nHe had mentioned the Chief Justice’s name once in the conversation. He had gloated to Clinton, “That Justice is a good man. I believe that he would do anything I asked him to, as a personal favor, mind you.” David had paid for my white silk sequined gown and he was removing it at that moment to expose a breast.\n\nI asked him in that opportune moment “David, do you think that I should sleep with the Chief Justice at the Supreme Court?” He asked in a little spasm of jealousy, as he liked to sell me but only if I objected to the man, “Why do you ask?”\n\n“Because you don’t love me anymore.” I lamented.\n\n“Yes, I do.” he lied not so convincingly. “I never loved anyone better than you.” Now that part I did believe. He never loved anyone. He did not know what love was. Love is taking on yourself torture to protect others. I let the gown fall to the floor and he hurried to pick it up. I kissed the back of his neck and asked him. “Why did you want to give my services to that Chief Justice?”\n\nHis neck flushed red and he turned to me and said “I didn’t think that the money would cover the full amount for his election services. I was wrong. It was enough.”\n\n“But 6 transactions!” I fussed. “Surely someone will notice.”\n\n“I will pay them not to.” he said. No one at the bank will tell.\n\nI am not at the Chase Manhattan bank as I tell you.\n\nHow does one get those records to prove the buying of a Presidency? I wonder how one proves that the Chief Justices’s opinion was swayed by that 7 million dollars?\n\nOr is it just enough that he received the bribe? Since I am a sex slave and men deposited money into Rockefellers private account at that bank, the same exact account that the Chief Justice received the money from, I wonder if I can get the records of the money David Rockefeller made from my services and how he distributed my money?\n\nSince my worth to him as a slave was dependent partially on whether the man he wanted got into the White House, and that was wages that he stole from me, don’t I have a right to the records that show he paid the Justice to keep me enslaved to his man at the White House?\n\nReally, I do not understand the law so well. I think that the Chief Justice owes us all a big apology – he put a sex slave boss’s son in the White House. He accepted a bribe that kept me enslaved and tortured to boot.\n\nNow you could say that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court did not know that the money he was given came from the sex slave business. And that is possible. But I think it would be hard for him to say that he didn’t know that David Rockefeller was in that business, because he asked Rockefeller for my sexual services. And that was before he received the 7 plus million dollars.\n\nNow, bear with me as I slow down and try to go through this carefully. It was about in Clinton’s first term. I was at a dinner of State at the White House. David was there and so was that man who became or was chief Justice at the time. He was a rather handsome man for his age, though frankly, I would not have slept with him if I had a free choice without duress.\n\nPart way through the evening he came over to where I was standing next to David holding his drink. He asked David confidentially-like “Why don’t you send her over to see me sometime?” as if I wasn’t there. David and he discussed the price for my services. The justice raised his left eyebrow at the figure and set his drink down saying, “That is too steep for me.”\n\nDavid made him some kind of deal as I wandered off to get another drink for the judge so as to not have to listen to myself discussed as an innate object to be bought and sold at the whim of others. When I returned, a date was discussed. But the justice was impatient and led me into a bedroom in the White House.\n\nNot knowing his way around well, we will give him the benefit of the doubt, he put me on Clinton’s bed. Clinton thus came in later in the middle of the evening to find us in his bed. He chuckled and said, “Expensive date, huh?” and left. I guess that everyone knew Rockefeller was a tightwad. I did see the justice put money or a check in the hand of David.\n\nI am happy to answer questions. The sex slave trade and the drug trade are directly related in a number of ways. They have the same bosses, the same agencies and the same money laundering practices in almost any intelligence setting.\n\nAnother Victim Says the Same: Child Trafficking, Ritual Sex Abuse & MK-ULTRA Are A Single Worldwide Operation, Run by the U.S., U.K. and AUS Secret Services\n\nHowever, the CIA and the KGB are not as separate as one would think. That has been the case since before WW I.\n\nOne of the Rockefellers funded the Bolshevik Revolution for Lenin in order to acquire more of the Southern oil fields of Russia for his Shell Oil.\n\nThat meant that in WW I and WW II the Rockefellers had heavy influence on the KBG and the CIA. This is getting closer to answering your question when you realize since the Rockefeller’s money was originally made in the opium trade in the 1800’s.\n\nThat family has also been one of the major movers in the sex slave business, accounting for about 40 percent of it world wide. They currently have about 28 percent of the drug trade, having slipped in it for a number of reasons.\n\nHaving said how intertwined the two are I now want to say that they usually have different men handling their operations once you get below the level of the chief managers.\n\nFor example, Nelson Rockefeller, was head of both his sex slave and his drug business and the heads of the CIA were his public side “employees” in that he had the power to get them fired or executed.\n\nDCI William J. Casey\n\nCasey died as a result of a hit by the Rockefeller family because he didn’t do what they wanted enough to please them. The brain cancer he had was bogus. It was someone else’s X-rays with his name on them.\n\nAnd he was DCI at the time. He did not fully understand the power structure that he was in. He was fooled by the organizational charts that show the CIA as a public institution headed by the President. I tried to explain to him how things really work. He didn’t want to believe me.\n\nThe US is not a democracy nor a republic and hasn’t been, certainly not since Carter, but I doubt it was functionally one during the whole of the 1900s. Howard Zinn in the “People’s History of the US” would probably agree with me. It is easy to see because the populist movement in the 1930’s did not move the govt. The corporations called in the pinkertons and put down the strikes.\n\nThe CIA itself is divided into departments so that while the Dept of Ops handles moving both drugs and sex slave, different people handle those. It is like at a University, there are professors of Literature and of History and though they both read books and sometimes the same books they are responsible for different aspects of “culture”.\n\nLet me get more specific. There was a Deputy Executive Director of the CIA, #2 man in the agency at one point, who secretly agreed with me that the sex slave business was wrong. In his office was a filing cabinet that had all the contracts between suppliers and distributors in it.\n\nIt was not kept on computers — too insecure. The drug trade contacts were in a separate filing cabinet. He let me destroy the sex slave files in his office one day.\n\nIt set the sex slave trade in the Western World into slow motion. It took it almost two years to regain its momentum. I got tortured for it. I didn’t regret doing it. What I did did not much affect the CIA officers running the delivery of sex slaves in the field much. They still knew where to get the slaves and who to deliver them to.\n\nWhat happened was that the contracts between the bosses were destroyed and they bickered, each claiming more of a share of the market than they were entailed [entitled?] to. In the face of that disharmony they were unable to collaborate well and the trade slowed down about 30 percent, then more as they fought and they eventually recovered.\n\nSurprisingly, it had very little effect on the drug trade even though the ships carry both sometimes. It didn’t slow it because they still had the drug agreements and still honored those. The US Navy was coerced into running both sex slaves and drugs at various times.\n\nMost admirals are strait laced and do not approve and will work very very hard to stop that sort of thing. But unless one is a remote viewer it is not possible to inspect every container coming onto a Navy ship for drugs. People are not as easy to hide.\n\nLet me see if I can go deeper into your question because I think that it is an important one. The real issue for me is whether it is possible to get these immoral soul-destroying trades under control on the planet so that people can have sane lives. I believe that the answer is Yes, it is completely possible. That is after watching this business for 40 years from the inside.\n\nYes, it is completely corrupt and pervasive. Yes, it has corrupted banking, governments, and our every understanding of what intelligence agencies and national security is about and how to do them. Even so, even though this planet has these problems like a terminal cancer patient with several different types of invasive cancers, I still know that it is possible for the patient to recover.\n\nI am going to see if I can explain how I know that to you in a way that you can accept. The simpliest answer is that Nelson Mandela knew he was going to be president of S. Africa and end apartheid. He said that before he went into prison the fist time. He said it at a rally. Winston Churchill as a child knew that England was going to be in trouble later and he would save her.\n\nGandhi knew he could force the British to walk out of India if he persisted. General Billy Mitchell knew in 1923 that he had to get the US to make airplanes because air power would determine who won WW II.\n\nI know that I will reform intelligence and governments world wide to prevent nuclear holocaust. I often know things with certainty which is why I was useful to DCIs. I intend to do this and I will, by the grace of God, because it is the job God has given me and He will not fail me. He never has.\n\nEven though I have been a thorn in the side of Rockefeller, the Bushs, and the CIA and even the KGB for decades, they have tolerated me and used me, because my skills are very useful. I really only have one skill, faith.\n\nNo matter what problem was brought to me, I could figure out how to reduce it to the ethical part of it to do and accomplish it – because I relied on all-knowing all-accomplishing wisdom. Christ walked on water and raised the dead. He healed the sick. People like Padre Pio have also been associated with miracles.\n\nYes, it will take a miracle for the world to change and become sane and stop worshipping death and destruction. But in my experience, miracles are not only possible but can be reliably invoked.\n\nMaybe that is more of an answer than you wanted. I used to take an auditorum full of Naval officers and get them to be psychically very accurate in one evening. (Then it took them a week to get used to it.)\n\nThat, like the 4 minute mile, used to be impossible. It isn’t any more. The corruptions on the planet will disappear because of an advance in technology. That advance is this transmission of being able to directly read the Akashic records[collective consciousness].\n\nThen there is no way to hide corruption. The sex slave trade, the drug trade, the theft of elections, wars etc. all have secrecy as a necessary ingredient, and lies about the consequences of one’s actions.\n\nThey look like a lot of separate problems, all very overwhelming. But there is really only one problem, a very simple accounting problem – people are not adding up the real costs to themselves correctly. They don’t have the skill needed to do so. That can be corrected soon.\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES CHANGE SOCIETIES – RADICALLY AND PERMANENTLY\n\nFor forty years I have been a remote viewing trainer for the US govt. The bosses have liked the results that came out of it but wanted to hide the technology from the public. They are resisting it going public. But they will not be able to contain it. It is rather like the hundredth monkey experiments. The innovation has already become part of the collective unconscious and will manifest.\n\nI trained over 15,000 people. That is a lot of people who actually know the truth about how the world can shift out of annihilation. They may still have a little hesitation to use their skills to expose the corruption to release it into forgiveness and repentance, just like the early pilots had some hesitation to fly across oceans. But the inevitability was there.\n\nThe Akashic records will become the basis of people’s decision making because so many people have tapped into it. Those records are without bias or flaw. The decisions that come out of union with them have certainty of result. Most people have never experienced knowing something with certainty. It seems like a contradiction.\n\nWhen I taught at the Pentagon in 1981, I asked everyone who brought my class a problem to write it down and then later write down if they were satisfied with the solution that we provided them in a week’s time. I had hundreds of difficult problems brought in and at the end I had only one man not sign that he was satisfied. He had died in the meantime.\n\nThere is a good and workable solution to every single problem that is ethical to solve. It is just that it can require a lot of faith, courage and dedication to get to it.\n\nFrom my perspective Finders was a CIA run mind control sex slave experiment\n\nI will first tell you how I knew about the experiment.\n\nThen what the goal of the experiment was.\n\nThen how the experiment was run.\n\nThen what the lives of the children were like under it.\n\nThen what went wrong with the experiment.\n\nThen what the results of the experiment were.\n\nThen what the CIA analysts said what the results were.\n\nThis really should be a full-length book on the enslavement of children.\n\nI have 40 years inside the CIA and it was my intention to someday be able to expose all this abuse of children by the US govt. But I don’t have the time to write out all the details today. I just want to cover the overview of these topics.\n\nMy specific knowledge of the Finders experiment came from reading 3 books in the CIA and talking to two of the in-house researchers who were responsible for administering the Project in the Dept. of Plans, in the Division that should be called Mind Control but due the sensitive nature of the topic was instead called “Future Assets.”\n\nIts main office was on the third floor of the main CIA building, until it moved to the 5th floor under Goss. By then I was gone. The importance of the move was that the higher up in the building the closer to the DCI, the higher the priority. That is the way the CIA works.\n\nThe main facility for that Division is not surprisingly in a separate building because the CIA has grown over time. It occupies 2 floors of a large building and has over 40 full time researchers in it. These are only devoted to mind control.\n\nThe CIA has a separate Division for Assets and their recruiting. The largest “Future Assets” facility is in Maryland, across the Potomac by about 40 miles; a fact one of its researchers we will call Ted Hallsted bemoaned to me as it caused him to be on the road a lot.\n\nThat facility has over 200 researchers in it and has a clinic and psychiatric hospital for children associated with it. Nominally it is a University Research center devoted to the study of childhood mental illness.\n\nHowever, the clients come for minor problems like learning disabilities, and attention deficit and leave as multiples without their parents knowing. The clinic only takes “high functioning” children — not schizophrenics, or cerebral palsy kids. Unsurprisingly, the Rockefellers, and the Carnegies are major funders of it.\n\nTo work there requires a special security clearance that only the CIA can give. I went over to look at the place once to size it up. That was in the 1980’s. Everyone was wearing the same badges that the CIA uses with the same magnetic strips on the back of a picture ID.\n\nTo get into the main research building one inserts the badge into the same type of entry stile as we were using at the CIA at that time. I inserted my badge from the CIA and got in no questions asked.\n\nthat time. I inserted my badge from the CIA and got in no questions asked.\n\nNow I was on a bit of a mission at the time. I wanted to leave a particular book on the desk of a particular researcher — by hand and then leave before it was known who had done that. That action of mine related to an unsolved murder of a child.\n\nThe researcher was supposed to follow up on all of his experimental subjects. I wanted him to know what had happened to that particular child as the result of the experiment that he had designed and run. The book was an internal CIA production FOR EYES ONLY and he was not on the list of EYES to see it. I felt that that was a deliberate oversight that needed to be corrected, so I did so.\n\nThe book had come to my attention at a meeting between the DCI and a CIA risk assessment lawyer on a possible lawsuit for a wrongful death. The DCI wanted me there to ask me if what was in the book was true. I asked for a copy of it to read it, naturally enough.\n\nI was not on the list of EYES either but I had a NEED TO KNOW and so did that researcher. I told the DCI that the contents of the book, produced by a CIA analyst and an FBI homicide officer, were indeed true. The DCI frowned at that.\n\nThe murderer was one George Bush, Sr. who was Vice President of the United States at the time. The book had been commissioned by the CIA to find all the loose ends and suppress them. To do that it had to have the truth.\n\nIt is not possible to do a competent cover-up job if you don’t have accurate intelligence to start with. The DCI wanted me to write a report on what else the CIA needed to know that was not in that book.\n\nMost of what I supplied was a list of over 20 other similar victims of the same Vice President; each one of which needed as thorough an investigation. They did not get it.\n\nPart of how I later ended up as a “pathologist” part-time at the White House when Bush, Sr. was President, was due to this particular case almost coming to trial.\n\nThe boy was 6 when Bush ritually killed him in a Skull and Bones ceremony to curry the favor of the dark lord. The murder was committed within 5 miles of that “University Research” facility. Most of the 20 odd victims were killed at the same spot. It was a quick and easy drive from the White House.\n\nThis is hard on my regular personality to write down. She didn’t ever hear about this before. So bear with us as we try to go through this material in as straight a line as possible; on a thorough fare without taking any turn offs, until you get to the exit and go about 2 miles east through a locked gate onto a military base that is quite small.\n\nThat base was put there just for Bush, Sr. as Vice President. The only function of it, and it is still there, is to skim off some of those research kids for rituals. The base is tiny by most standards. It houses only the guards that work the security of it — about 3. There are no Army offices, no PX, no parade grounds, etc.\n\nIt is still there today as I type this. It may be razed tomorrow, like the McMartin tunnels as a result of what I am saying. But today, as a remote viewer, I can see that it has one main square building on the center of a square lot with the entrance on its West side and a guard standing at it though the gate is locked. Only one person has the key. That is Bush, Sr. It is his private reserve still. The guards are his prisoners inside of it. They are Army recruits in theory and on paper.\n\nNo guard assigned to work there has ever made it out alive. That is to make sure that they don’t talk about what they have seen.\n\nWhat have they seen?\n\nBush, Sr. come in and out. A boy child driven up in a van and unloaded when Bush, Sr. comes.\n\nA “pathologist” and the guards Bush brings with him carries out a coffin as Bush, Sr. leaves. Access to the road to the gate is restricted. So no neighbors or passing traffic sees this strange recurrence of events. While Bush, Sr. was President he didn’t have time to go out there and the White House morgue and incinerator were used.\n\nThat base has no morgue or incinerator in it. Bush, Sr. arrives usually with 3 men – two of his own guards and the pathologist. They wait outside of the building while Bush Sr. sodomizes and tortures the kid to death.\n\nHis counterpart the late Beriawould be proud of him.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? The fact is that the way I have described this makes it possible for any intelligence service with a satellite to document that Bush, Sr. has done this. All they have to do it look back at their land sat images and watch the boy go in and the coffin come out. Time after time. I kid you not.\n\nThey have the proof already in their files if they look closely. What pegs it as that base is the fact that the guards do not go in and out of the gate. That is easy to verify on sat images — that lack of regular traffic. The base has a “secure” phone line, a special type of receiver on the roof.\n\nThat also pegs it. The particular type of receiver is a “Presidential” Model. That is a little harder to see on the sat images but as the sun first rises on a sunny day it would show up due to the distinctive shadow of that model in low angle light.\n\nI bet that that base will be razed tomorrow — gone, wiped off the face of the earth. But the sat data will still be there in Russia, China, and many other places.\n\nBecause my emails are of interest to many intelligence services, they will get this information. What they do with it will depend on future political situations that are hard for the average intelligence person to predict.\n\nBy the way, the guards that work there are mind control subjects, “graduates” of that University Research facility. The research there has been going on a long time. It was one of the early MKULTRA facilities.\n\nGeorgetown University Healy Hall\n\nGeorgetown University should be called CIA U. The mental research facility is not on the main campus near the regular college students. It is on a separate piece of land that makes it harder to run away from. The name of it is not Georgetown, but it is part of Georgetown University.\n\nSome people at the CIA have complained that attention deficit disorder is associated with the fluoridation of water and that the CIA refused to release the data on it in order to keep getting so many almost normal kids delivered to the door of their mind control clinics around North America.\n\nThey also complain that the CIA knows the treatment for attention deficit disorder, a drug to chelate the fluoride and expel it from the body and refuses to publish that data as well.\n\nIt is true that there are a number of books on the subject for internal consumption at the CIA. An ordinary epidemiologist could look at the issue and find out if those rumors within the CIA are true.\n\nWhen this University facility’s history in mind control comes to the public’s attention, it will be a little hairy. Hundreds, no thousands, of parents will suddenly want to know if their child, grown or otherwise, was a mind control subject or in the control group. I will mention in passing three fairly reliable methods of knowing that.\n\nThat information comes from CIA reports about what to do to confuse parents if they get to another therapist later, ie what disinformation to give them to prevent them from uncovering that the kid was mind controlled.\n\nThat first piece of disinformationis — “No one can tell if a person is a mind control victim — certainly not regular family and neighbors, only a qualified therapist could know and since they can’t tell no one can.”\n\nThat is given because the CIA found out that 56% of the children were discovered to have been uncovered by relatives and family members as “robotic” [keep this in mind for a while] or “messed up in their minds” or “with inexplicable behaviors that came from outside of themselves.”\n\nTeachers were particularly good at distinguishing control kids from experimental kids, and a number of teachers near that facility were killed by the CIA — on the order of a dozen in a decade.\n\nAlexander: For example, a lot of people have noticed the very strange behavior of Facebook’s co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, which, IMO, shares the marks of an MK Ultra victim:\n\nHis super strange, robotic, behavior has made people joke about him being non human, android-like, and memes such as these surfaced online:\n\nSince Facebook is believed by many to be a CIA database, as well as a legitimate business that generates A LOT of revenue for the agency, it is only logical that it would be assigned to someone that was/is part of their mind control program.\n\nI, personally, feel very sorry for the victims of mind control and I don’t find the above pictures funny. I just wish there was a way to help them…\n\nThe second piece of disinformation that the CIA primed therapists around the world have dispended is that it is “normal” for kids to act out in their teenage years by cross-dressing. It turned out that just the opposite is true of normal teenagers. They want to define their sexual identity and not cross dress.\n\nTeenagers are the most intolerant to cross dressing per CIA research. Unless of course, they are mind control subjects and have been trained to sexually please chicken hawks by boys dressing as girls. There is no market for girls dressed as boys so the cross dressing only goes in one direction.\n\nSurprisingly, the CIA research showed that homosexual boys rarely cross dressed on their own at that age – unless they had been used by porn filmmakers, chicken hawks and mind controllers. So the presence of cross-dressing in a teenage boy is highly predictive that he is a mind control or abuse victim.\n\nThe third piece of disinformationthat the CIA fed therapists in journals to fool them and the parents is a bit subtler. The disinformation said “There is no normal age at which children should be told about sex. Sex education can occur at any age — it is up to the parents to decide. And sex education may be bad for kids so maybe we shouldn’t have it in our schools…”\n\nThe CIA spent a lot of money to convince parents, churches, and schools not to have real sex education classes. The reason was that when kids were allowed to freely talk in a group about their sexual experiences or fantasies or theories of sex, the kids themselves could see that some of them had very different levels of exposure to and sophistication in these matters.\n\nSo if sex education had to be taught the CIA wanted canned talks in which the kids were not allowed to talk. It thus trained sex educators to control the amount kids could talk and tried to make it taboo for the kids to talk to each other afterwards.\n\nThe CIA also found out that there was a best age for sex education – about the start of puberty. So then they fostered some campaigns to force the education to be earlier. The reason for that was that some young child whose native curiosity would not lead to sophisticated knowledge of sexual action, were coming out with it in front of parents and therapists.\n\nIt was better for the CIA if they could say that the kid learned it in a sex education class than from CIA prostitution of them.\n\nSo although it sounds contradictory, the CIA’s bottom line on sex education disinformation was — don’t have sex education classes, but if you must have them, have them very early and don’t let kids talk at them.\n\nMake it a more taboo subject by the way you skirt it or only allow it to be taught in a very short segment and never referred to again.\n\nThe CIA sponsored conferences for sex educators under a front company call “First Dating Experiences” if I remember correctly. Or maybe just “First Experiences.” When the abstinence-only people objected, the name of the front company was called something like “Wait for Marriage, Inc.”\n\nIt was the same front. The same staff, address etc. The CIA also pushes abstinence and marital fidelity fronts while not practicing these things themselves. It does that to increase the effectiveness of its blackmail ops.\n\nSexual blackmail only works when the society is condemning towards others. It is not the abstinence of fidelity that the CIA is after, it is the condemning of others it is after.\n\nCondemning is a form of hate and the CIA provokes hate and condemning as a way of controlling others. It is a mind control technique that can then be used to get people to fight wars etc against their best interests.\n\nThe CIA is looking for “handles” into a person’s psyche — an emotional issue that drives a person to act. Then it exploits it. It also creates handles by funding songs and lyrics into existence. That is another whole level of mind control directed at a population instead of individuals.\n\nI have gotten off track some here. This is useful information but not staying focused on the main topic.\n\nI want to mention one other way in which I learned about the Finder’s Experiment. The name Finders comes from a CIA slang word that was popular about the time this experiment started.\n\nIt was Fucked Into Not Denying (FIND). A boss at the CIA would tell an employee “Go find out who did this.”\n\nIt was like a game of musical chairs. Everyone would deny that they did it until finally somebody was the scapegoat and was fucked into not being able to deny it.\n\nSo the Finders acronym was a warning to people in the CIA to be careful and not get made into a fall guy for this whole Project by letting a word out about it. A person leaking such stuff usually got blamed for the stuff itself — as people outside the agency couldn’t tell who was above whom and where the buck stopped.\n\nThe first time I heard about the Finders Group was at a party. Some kids were brought in to a fancy DC estate dressed up almost in Halloween type costumes – clowns, witches, ghosts, etc. But the costumes had big buttons on back panels over the bottom so that the kids could easily have their private parts exposed. The kids were trick or treat age. But it was not fall.\n\nThere were about 15 of these kids brought into an upscale party of people in tuxes. I arrived on the arm of the DCI Colby.\n\nMen started messing with these kids sexually, putting them on their laps with their panels unbuttoned.\n\nThey did not even go into a separate room to do it. I felt uncomfortable with that – it reminded me of my own abuse as a child — and I went out on the front steps to look at the night sky and imagine being on some other planet for awhile.\n\n[William] Colby came out and asked me if I wanted to go home — that meant back to his bed. I just couldn’t get away from this issue. I got a little mad at him and asked him who brought the kids, as if I didn’t know as a remote viewer.\n\nHe was defensive and then admitted that they were part of a CIA experiment and this was their “coming out” test — their graduation test to see if they could seduce DC politicians (to stay alive).\n\nThose who flunked the test were liquidated. I had been in that system all my life — be useful sexually or die. I was not amused. Colby went into the technical details of the experiment and a “Wasn’t it a good idea?’ type of pitch to me.\n\nI threw up my dinner on the front steps of the estate and excused myself to go wash up in the bathroom. I was good at throwing up on cue.\n\nWhat was it that Colby had said to me?\n\nColby explained to me that the point of the Finders’ Experiment was to train children to be like drug sniffing dogs — only they were to sniff out who would make good pushers for not just drugs, but illegal weapons, sex slaves, etc.\n\nThe CIA was looking for a down line in these businesses and it wanted to use expendable agents. The CIA was having trouble explaining how many of its operative died. It never put names on the gold stars in the marble panel in the entrance way because that panel was a bald faced lie.\n\nThe CIA had lots of deaths in action of its officers. The gold stars were propaganda for the novices to con them into a sense of false security — like that the CIA cared about them. The CIA did not care how many of them died. The Rockefellers wanted their deaths. It was the GAO [General Accounting Office] who cared.\n\nTraining agents was expensive. Covering up their deaths was even more expensive than that because of the expense of finding the loose ends and tying them off. So the CIA had decided, even before Colby became DCI probably, to go to the cheaper expendables to foster its trade in contraband. The kids were divided into two groups — those that received training on how to pick the people to become a pusher and make them into one, or no training.\n\nIn the no-training group you tell the kid, under hypnosis and torture what you want them to accomplish and let them figure out how to accomplish it. I grew up in that model — General Patton used it. It was cheaper. Kids died all around me. But some figured out what to do to succeed.\n\nIt had a kind of intelligence logic to it that was “if the kid has to figure out what to do on their own, maybe the KGB won’t have seen that strategy before and it will work.”\n\nNext I want to talk about the type of training that the kids received if they were assigned to get any at all. The training consisted of two weeks of hard torture during which they were taught how to do blow jobs, spread their legs, ask for contraband to be moved and sign alias names to the right places on contract forms to “witness” them.\n\nThe contracts bound the pusher to work for the CIA front company without being able to sue. Let me say that another way. Both groups were tortured using electricity and severe pain for two weeks.\n\nThe trained kids, in addition to being told that they had to move contraband because their lives depended on it, also had a couple of hours worth of instructions and practical guidance on how to do it. What do you think were the results of the experiment?\n\nThe CIA found from this experiment that it made no appreciable difference whether the kid was trained or not. Its reports made no mention of the two weeks of torture as that was “off the record” after the 1977 MKULTRA Hearings.\n\nThey also made no mention of the type of training as the CIA wanted to hide from possible future Congressional prying eyes, that the kids were to move contraband by finding buyer-pushers.\n\nInstead, the CIA documents said that the point of the experiment was to detect which kids could “succeed in life” and whether any training that the CIA gave them could make a difference in that.\n\nThe reason everything was limited to two weeks was that was the length of time that the in-hospital psychiatric hospitalization could maximally be extended to to run basically healthy kids “through testing of their condition.” The CIA developed a bunch of bogus tests to run on ADD kids to justify their two-week hospitalization like “withdrawing them from sugar, food dyes, etc.”\n\nIt was a total scam. They just needed something so difficult that parents couldn’t easily do at home to con the parent into letting Johnny stay at the hospital. They withdrew the food alright. They barely fed the kids at all.\n\nThey fed them out of boxes, pre-packaged pototo chips like Pringles and called that a sugar free diet. The last day the parents would come to pick the kid up and the interaction was observed carefully to see how well the kid could lie about his stay and what he had eaten in the hospital.\n\nIt was a complete fantasy. The kid had been down in the basement without a bed, clothes, or single hot meal. The kids that passed had incredible abilities to make believe. So good that they even believed it. They were multiples just like me. They had gone through an hour’s hypnosis at the end of that torture and with the help of the hypnotist had imagined all that had happened to them in that two-week period of time.\n\nThe parents were told that they couldn’t see the kids because the kids needed to learn a new way to relate to them to help their ADD, and that had to be learned well before they saw them again.\n\nThe parents wanted a break from their ADD kids for 2 weeks so it worked. And the kids did relate to their parents differently after two weeks of hard torture without a hot meal. Meanwhile, some say the CIA did actually give them the fluoride chelating drug — a pill once a day so that the ADD was better. The program was popular with parents.\n\nThe University facility touted its benefits. Researchers forged results to show how effective it was and others studied how to torture the kids and split their minds more reliably.\n\nNot all kids split well enough to pretend, or keep up the pretense. These are the ones people know of as the Finder kids. They were taken away from their parents. They were not able to find pushers in their communities, so they were sent to be sex slaves and drug mules where they didn’t have to perform at as high a level.\n\nIf they couldn’t even do that, they were killed. They were not one-use kids for the sexual/torture use of the Ultra-rich, they were already used goods.
