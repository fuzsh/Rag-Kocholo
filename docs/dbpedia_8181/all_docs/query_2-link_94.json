        "text": "Man, phew, where to start. This guy.. is absolutely incredible. In fact, i've never actually gone out of my way to write a review about any artist, ever, in my life, but this guy.. wow. I saw Jimmie while working at a pretty well know Country music venue thats well known for premiering up and coming artists before they get famous... Carrie Underwood, Chris Stapleton.. etc. etc. Anyone who loves country music in Chicago, has been to, or heard of Joes on Weed St. I worked there for two years, and saw sooo many incredible artists and some of the best country music shows ever. Of all of them, Jimmie's music and his performance was easily, the most memorable, amazing show I witnessed in the two years i was there. I actually ended up dropping $20 bucks on his CD, even though i dont even listen to CD's anymore.. I bought it simply because I wanted to have a reminder of that show, and how absolutely awesome it was. Aside from his music, it's also worth mentioning, that when he tells his story about his journey and being able to achieve his dream of singing country music, was so incredibly inspiring. Unlike so many of the artists I not only saw, but ended up meeting in person.. this guy, was one of most genuinely humble, kind hearted musician who genuinely loves what he does and genuinely loves and appreciates his fans so much. Amazing artist, amazing music, AMAZING performer and a genuinely amazing dude. If you have a chance to see him live, before he becomes a household name, I can guarantee you, you will not be disappointed. :)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI have to say\n\nJimmy was the best of the night, except by the time he came on stage it was 10:30. And we had to leave early. The other performers were just ok. We sat at tables in the back by the bar and could not hear or understand the vocals of any band. The venue felt like we were back to school at a dance in the gym ( kind of quaint). I believe ithe problem was the venue and possibly not the performers. Though great to have artists in our town!! But maybe an outdoor concert there would be better!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
