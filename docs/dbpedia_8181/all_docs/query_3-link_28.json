        "text": "Jim Allen, a writer and racing-sports enthusiast, has completed his first book “Smoken Mirrors – A Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Chronicle of Cover-Up and Conspiracy”: a gripping and potent expose chronicling some of the major world events that have been historically questioned as to their accuracy. Jim Allen has recently appeared on many talk shows including Caravan to Midnight with John B. Wells. He will continue his voyage to appear on other talk shows across the United States.\n\nPublished by New York City-based Page Publishing, Jim Allen’s poignant tale sheds a new and more detailed light on conspiracies from UFOs to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It is the story of one man's search for truth amidst enshrouding darkness.\n\nIn this book, author Jim Allen takes readers on a wild ride through some of the greatest tragedies in American History. With the evidence and logic provided, the reader can come to their own conclusions as to which events exhibit cover-up and conspiracy. This book demonstrates that information the general public receives through media sources is often biased and manipulated in content from higher sources. It’s a fast, easy read and will probably have a profound psychological effect on the reader. It will leave readers with an imprint that “nothing is as it appears, it’s all – Smoken Mirrors!”\n\nReaders who wish to experience this gripping work can purchase “Smoken Mirrors – A Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Chronicle of Cover-Up and Conspiracy” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\n\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\n\nAbout Page Publishing\n\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
