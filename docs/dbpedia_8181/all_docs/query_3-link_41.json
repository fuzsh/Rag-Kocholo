        "text": "Has anyone ever scripted any graphing or chart objects that can be used for (say) space type analysis with Schedules?\n\nI am working on secondary school extension and key to the process is analysing use of space to identify waste or surplus.\n\nThe principle is that new building costs a lot more than (simple) internal reorganisation so by identifying underused areas and optimising the layout, the amount of new space that end users want can be minimised.\n\nKey to this is analysing percentage use of floor space by room type.\n\nWhat I have in mind is a 'hollow pie chart' like this:\n\nShowing percentage of total area that specific space types comprise.\n\nI currently have a number of formatted schedules showing the difference between existing and new:\n\nA chart would be a much better way of displaying the information though.\n\nIt can be done with properties or zone classifications or some other means, but it needs to work with renovation status and I think would probably be a really useful thing for many of us to have.\n\nIf no-one has anything like this already (I can't be the first person to think of it) any pointers in terms of making one would be great.\n\nMy GDL skills could do with a bit more development!\n\nOperating system used: Mac Intel-based Monterey\n\nArchicad 27 UKI | OS X 12.7.1 Monterey\n\nThe new zone label is a GDL object, so there must be a way to access zone data. If there's a GDL method for it, it ought to be possible.\n\nI did think about creating a property to duplicate the measured area (I've added 2 for data to compare areas with the BB98 standard) but I don't know how you read object properties in GDL either!\n\nExcel is a workaround but it's not what I want and it's of limited use. The whole point of BIM is to make work more efficient. The minute you are relying on links with external applications which aren't live - that principle fails.\n\nEven if it is live, it's not the same as having all the data in one place.\n\nIt would be really nice to be able to automatically add this object to a sheet with schedules and have the data presented automatically.\n\nEven in terms of design, if when we produce a layout we find out that actually 35% of our area is circulation, it should make us question the design.\n\nSimilarly if we suddenly realise that our Plant Room is only 1.5% of the total area, we will know right away that it's too small.\n\nIf BIM is supposed to have tools that can help us with design (and increasingly we are becoming much more concerned with data analysis to assist us) this sort of thing is the low-hanging fruit isn't it?\n\nArchicad 27 UKI | OS X 12.7.1 Monterey\n\nLabels are attached to elements so can read information from those elements.\n\nObjects can't be attached to elements (except in special circumstances like windows/doors to walls).\n\nEven then your object would have to read information from all of the zones, not just one.\n\nIt might be possible with an add-on, as I am sure I have read about add-ons that can gather zone information and provide % break-downs.\n\nProperties with expressions may be of some use.\n\nYou would need a 'overall area' property that you can associate to all zones and you can give this a 'default' value that ca be used.\n\nThen each zone has another property with an expression that can calculate the percentage in relation to the overall area.\n\nYou would need a different property for each type of zone - i.e. circulation space, plant room, etc so you can schedule and total those percentages.\n\nThe major downside though is you can set a default for your overall area property, but it can not be locked in each element.\n\nTherefore it can be changed per element (zone) and if the overall size changes you can alter the default property, but it will not pass on the other zones unless you reset them to use the default again.\n\nSo it really doesn't work very well.\n\nBarry.\n\nOne of the forum moderators.\n\nVersions 6.5 to 27\n\ni7-10700 @ 2.9Ghz, 32GB ram, GeForce RTX 2060 (6GB), Windows 10\n\nLenovo Thinkpad - i7-1270P 2.20 GHz, 32GB RAM, Nvidia T550, Windows 11"
