        "text": "Frank Zappa was a counter-culture musician before counter culture was cool. He and his band the Mothers of Invention were known for such album titles as “Freak Out!” and “Weasels Ripped My Flesh.”\n\nBut early in his career, the Pomona Valley resident wrote a very mainstream tune, “Memories of El Monte” with bandmate Ray Collins for DJ and producer Art Laboe.\n\nThe song mentions many of the artists that performed at Laboe’s famous dances at El Monte Legion Stadium in the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nALSO SEE: El Monte Legion Stadium was a mecca for rock ‘n’ roll in the ’50s for SoCal teens\n\nThe song was recorded in 1963 by Cleve Duncan of the Penguins.\n\nHere are the groups and songs included in the lyrics.\n\nThe Five Satins: Group fronted by Fred Paris that recorded “In the Still of the Night” in 1956.\n\nThe Shields: The group was said by some rock historians to be essentially session singers put together to back lead vocalist Frankie Ervin on the song “You Cheated,” a hit in 1958.\n\nThe Heartbeats: Quintet fronted by James “Shep” Sheppard that charted with “A Thousand Miles Away” in 1957.\n\nThe Medallions: The group of teenagers recorded “The Letter,” a 1954 song with nonsense words such as pismotality, said to be invented by lead singer Vernon Green.\n\nMarvin & Johnny: This duo of Marvin Phillips and Emory “Johnny” Perry released “Cherry Pie” in 1960.\n\nTony Allen & the Champs: The doo-wop group had a hit with “Nite Owl” in 1955.\n\nThe Penguins: The group fronted by Cleve Duncan released “Earth Angel” in 1955."
