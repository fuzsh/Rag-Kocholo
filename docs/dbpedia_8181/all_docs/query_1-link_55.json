        "text": "IRVINE, CA (WVUE) - We’re only three days away from Saints preseason football. The Black and Gold take on the Cardinals. After 12 practices, the team is ready to see the work translate into a game like situation.\n\n“These games aren’t going to count in terms of our record, but I think they matter. I think they’re important for a lot of people. I think they’re important for us as a coaching staff, with a lot of new pieces on offense,” said head coach Dennis Allen.\n\n“Being able to get into those games situations, understand how to how the communication is going to operate, how the communication from the box down to the field, to the players, the communication to the quarterback on the field, getting our substitutions on and off. Those are all things that I think are important for us to get ironed out over the course of the next three games in the preseason. So that those don’t become issues as we get into the regular season. So yeah, I think we’re all kind of excited about playing games.”\n\nThe injuries have been stacking up this camp. So look for a lot of backups to see work in Arizona.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of guys that are going to play a lot of snaps, and there’s some guys that that need to play a lot of snaps so we can get a good evaluation of them. So we’ll take whatever the number we got, and we’ll go play and put a good product out there for the first preseason game,” said Allen.\n\nThe Saints will practice for 2.5 hours on Thursday, and fly out to Arizona on Friday.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
