        "text": "More Jimmie Allen\n\nItâs the collaboration we didnât know we needed until now! Country singer-songwriter Jimmie Allen has announced heâs releasing the duet, On My Way, with singer, actress, and dancer Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThe pair originally met when Allen auditioned for the tenth season of American Idol, in which Lopez was a judge. Allen advanced in the competition but was cut before the live voting rounds began.\n\nAllen announced the new song on social media when he shared a photo of himself with Lopez in coordinating leopard-print outfits in front of a wooden background with a large glowing star.\n\nJoin our community with our FREE weekly newsletter\n\nAllen first teased the collaboration on May 21. âIâve been a fan of this artist for a long time. Still believe we have a song together,â he reiterated the following day. Allen also defended the cross-genre collaboration stating, âIâm not here to change country music. Iâm just here to add to it.â\n\nPenned by Ivy Adara, Leroy Clampitt, and Michael Pollack, Lopez released a version of the song as part of the soundtrack to her recent movie Marry Me, co-starring Owen Wilson.\n\nShe shared, âThis song means so much to meâ¦in more ways than you will ever knowâ¦ð¤ Itâs about faith and believing in every step of your journeyâ¦ and it makes me so happy that it is touching all of your hearts too!! #NoMistakesOnlyLessons #Trust #BelieveInYourJourney.â\n\nAs well as Lopez, Allenâs forthcoming third album, Tulip Drive, will feature collaborations with CeeLo Green, T-Pain, Katie Ohh and Aadyn. Much like its predecessors, the albumâs title is deeply personal to Allenâs family ties â Tulip Drive is the name of the street his late grandmother grew up on. Mercury Lane was named for the street Allen grew up on; his 2020 and 2021 releases Bettie James and Bettie James Gold Edition were named for his grandmother (Bettie Snead) and father (James âBig Jimâ Allen), who passed away in 2014 and 2019, respectively.\n\nAllen shares, âA lot of the songs on this album are from that time period. This is the first album where a lot of the songs are actually written based off a lot of my own personal life experiences â from relationships, the hardships of life, to the parties and the good times. A lot of these songs are based off things I went through when I was in later in high school and college, at a place where I was just learning a lot of life lessons from my grandmother. I wanted to honour her by naming this album Tulip Drive, after the street she lived on in Lewes, Delaware.â\n\nOn My Way follows Allenâs smash hit single Freedom Was A Highway with Brad Paisley and recent release In Our Blood with Dylan Scott. Allen will head to Australia in September for CMC Rocks, alongside a star-studded line-up of international and Australian country favourites.\n\nOn My Way is set for release on Friday, May 27.\n\nTulip Drive Tracklist:\n\nbe alright\n\nwhat i'm talkin bout\n\nkissin you\n\ndown home\n\nsettle on back\n\npesos (feat. CeeLo Green & T-Pain)\n\nlove in the living room\n\non my way (Jimmie Allen & Jennifer Lopez)\n\nbroken hearted (feat.
