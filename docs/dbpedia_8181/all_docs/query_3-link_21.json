        "text": "American Art of the Depression Era dating from 1930 to 1945 (Art of The Print / www.artoftheprint.com - Artist Index: A to E): The following four pages contain a listing of original American etchings, lithographs woodcuts, serigraphs, watercolors, drawings, linocuts and wood engravings from the Depression decade of the 1930’s and into the early 1940’s. Despite the dire economic times publishers of original prints continued to survive and successfully raise revenue for the artists as well as making original art affordable during the Great Depression years.\n\nListed on the first page of the 'American Art of the Depression Era' directory are over fifty original works of art created by American artists such as, George Elbert Burr, his etchings, Little Canyon, Arizona and Morraine Park were both commissioned by The Print Connoisseur, while his Evening, Arizona was published by The Brooklyn Society of Etchers. Also, works such as, Kenneth Ballantyne's original linocut, Wood Nymphs appeared in The Colophon in New York in 1931. George Elmer Browne’s The Fishing Fleet and Adolf Dehn’s Threshing Near Kilkenny published by the Associated American Artists (A.A.A.), are other outstanding examples of early prints from this decade.\n\nAmerican Art of the Depression Era dating from 1930 to 1945 (Art of The Print / www.artoftheprint.com - Artist Index: F to J): The second page of this directory also contains a list of over fifty original works of art created during the Great Depression years by American artists. One of the more interesting aspects of art of the Depression is how seldom the actual misery and privation of the decade is depicted. On this page, for example, only Hugo Gellert’s original lithograph, Primary Accumulation, protests the contemporary state of affairs. The visual arts (including films) set out to divert and entertain. Perhaps for artists an almost sure recipe for failure would have been to remind the average man of his sorry condition.\n\nOn the contrary most areas of the entertainment industries thrived. The art of Kenneth Hartwell is an excellent example. His lithographs of circus acrobats, jugglers and clowns and of the music, dancing and comedy of the Burlesque shows are worlds into themselves. Gazing at his imagery the viewer is granted a temporary reprieve from the real world.\n\nAmerican Art of the Depression Era dating from 1930 to 1945 (Art of The Print / www.artoftheprint.com - Artist Index: K to P): Even in a Depression the sense of a continuation of normal activities persists. In Joseph Margulies, New England Granny the subject does exactly what grannies do best as she contentedly sits in her rocker, sewing. Philip Parsons depicts a joyful family reunion in Home for Christmas and Henry Pitz depicts the dignity of work in his monumental art deco style in both Maine Fisherman and Man Against the Sky.\n\nPurely by alphabetical accident, page 3 also contains two of my favorite night scenes: Alan Lewis’ delightful color woodcut, Swinging the Gate and Martin Lewis’ renowned Night in New York. This famous etching was published by the Chicago Society of Etchers in 1932.\n\nAmerican Art of the Depression Era dating from 1930 to 1945 (Art of The Print / www.artoftheprint.com - Artist Index: R to Z): Like the previous three pages, page four of this directory provides a full variety of Depression era themes and techniques. Stark realities of the times are provided by W. P. Robinson (Abandoned Farm) and Isadore Weiner (Gardening). In contrast are pieces like John W. Winkler’s playful landscape, Rae Lakes, California and the fine animal studies by Clarence Zuelch.\n\nTwo magnificent drypoints by Albert Sterner -- Meditation and The Promised Land – will also be found listed on that page. In particular, The Promised Land seems like a potent symbol of man’s journey through the decade of the Great Depression. In total, there are over two hundred works of original art created by American artists from the Depression decade of the 1930’s and into the early 1940’s listed in the 'American Art of the Depression' directory."
