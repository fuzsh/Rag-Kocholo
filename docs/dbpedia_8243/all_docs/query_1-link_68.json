        "text": "LAHAINA, Hawaii â Maui residents displaced by last yearâs deadly wildfires are invited to apply for the stateâs latest interim housing program, which offers several different types of units.\n\nThe Hawaii Interim Housing Program is managed by the Hawaii Office of Recovery and Resiliency in partnership with the state Department of Human Services and the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. According to the state, the new program offers ârapid and vitalâ housing relief to wildfire victims.\n\nâThis program adds a new energy to the many initiatives we have launched as part of our supporting the recovery of Mauiâs people from the wildfires,â Gov. Josh Green said in a statement released on Tuesday. âEvery day, families and individuals have been able to leave temporary lodging in hotels to be placed in longer-term housing.â\n\nHIHP includes multiple state-sponsored interim housing sites, including Ka Lai Ola, which is under construction in West Maui and will offer up to 450 modular homes once completed. It also includes Hale O Laie, formerly the Haggai Institute in Kihei, which has more than 150 units.\n\nRecognizing that each household has unique circumstances and needs, the HIHP program offers a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units and modular homes. The lots are designed so multi-generational families can be clustered together to maintain a sense of community.\n\nHIHP is available to those who resided in Maui County before the disaster; were displaced from their primary residents due to the wildfires; and experienced disaster-related unemployment resulting in the loss of their home.\n\nHIHP applicants may need to provide the following documentation:\n\nProof of identity (no citizenship requirement)\n\nProof of pre-disaster residency in Maui County\n\nEvidence of disaster caused income loss and inability to pay rent or mortgage resulting in the loss of your pre-disaster residence\n\nDocumentation of any other assistance received related to the Maui fires\n\nApplications should identify all individuals intending to reside in the interim housing unit and specify any accommodation requests to ensure appropriate housing placement. While applying does not guarantee eligibility or placement, eligible households will be matched with available units based on their specific needs and the availability of suitable housing. All household members aged 18 and older must undergo a background check, with results evaluated on an individual and household basis.\n\nHouseholds are encouraged to apply even if they are unsure of their eligibility. There is no cost to apply, and those placed in interim housing will not be required to pay rent or utility bills through August 2025.\n\nâWe are happy for the opportunity to assist the Maui fire survivors by providing them housing options at Hale O Laie,â said HHFDC executive director Dean Minakami.\n\nFor more information and to apply, visit dbedt.hawaii.gov/hhfdc/hawaiistaterecovers or call 1-808-727-1550. Translation assistance is available for those with limited English proficiency."
