        "text": "Famed musician Mick Fleetwood loses his restaurant in Lahaina\n\nMick Fleetwood of the band Fleetwood Mac says his restaurant, Fleetwood’s on Front St, in Lahaina, Hawaii, has been lost due to wildfires.\n\nThe restaurant “has been lost and while we are heartbroken our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members,” he said.\n\n“On behalf of myself and my family I share my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of MAUI. We are committed to supporting the community and those affected by this disaster in the days month and years to come,” Fleetwood added.\n\nMaui is reeling from deadly and catastrophic wildfires. Here's what you need to know\n\nThe wildfires ripping through Maui will likely be the largest natural disaster the state of Hawaii has ever seen, Gov. Josh Green said Thursday, as the blazes have killed dozens, displaced thousands of others and wiped out communities.\n\nAt least 55 people have died in the fires, though that number is expected to rise as search and rescue efforts continue across the island, officials said.\n\nNone of the fires burning in Maui have been completely contained, officials said Thursday.\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\nThousands still without power or means of communication: Nearly 11,000 people across Maui are without power late Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us. Crippling outages of vital cellular, internet and radio networks are also hindering emergency teams from contacting those who may need help, officials said. The outages are also preventing some from contacting their missing family members or providing loved ones updates on their status. It could take days or even weeks to fix networks, and officials are relying on satellite phones to communicate emergency information.\n\nNumber of people missing is unclear: Officials are still working to determine how many people are still unaccounted for across Maui, island police chief John Pelletier said Thursday, citing challenges in communicating without cellular or radio signals. A search and rescue team from California is headed to join crews from the US Coast Guard, Navy and other agencies, which already searching on the ground, by sea and by helicopter.\n\nFirefighters still working to rein in the infernos: The wildfire that tore through Lahaina was 80% contained as of late Thursday local time, Maui County officials said. Firefighters have also made progress battling two other major fires on the island. The Pulehu fire — located further east in Kihei — was 70% contained on Thursday and another fire in the hills of Maui’s central Upcountry was still being assessed.\n\nHistoric Lahaina is “burnt to the ground”: Maui’s Lahaina Town – a tourism hub and historic whaling village – has been decimated. “None of it’s there. It’s all burnt to the ground,” Mayor Richard Bissen said Thursday. Gov. Green estimated that about 80% of the community is destroyed. CNN’s chief climate correspondent Bill Weir described the scene: “All the iconic buildings are either flattened or just scorched skeletons of their former self.”\n\nState scrambles to house thousands: “Many hundreds of homes” have been destroyed by fires, Green said, leaving Hawaiian officials to seek long-term housing for thousands of displaced residents. The state will begin by seeking 2,000 rooms for the unhoused, he said. Residents with spare rooms or rental properties have also been urged to volunteer to shelter those in need.\n\nApproximately 30,000 people flown out of Maui: As officials have urged travelers to leave the island, more than 14,000 people were taken off the island Wednesday and an additional 14,500 were expected to be moved off by the end of the day Thursday, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. Those individuals were either sent to other Hawaiian islands or were taken back home, it said.\n\nRoad to recovery will be lengthy and expensive: It will be several years before Maui is able to recover and rebuild following this week’s devastation – and it will come at a high cost, Green said Thursday. “It will be in the billions of dollars, without a doubt,” he said. President Joe Biden signed a disaster declaration on Thursday that will direct significant federal resources toward recovery in Maui and the Big Island.

Josh Green spoke Thursday on the impact of climate change in the state and how its government and residents can respond in the future.\n\n“We’ve never experienced a wildfire that affected a city like this before,” Green said at Thursday night’s news conference, mentioning the state has been impacted by wildfires previously but largely in open spaces.\n\nIt was a “shock,” he said, to see the effects of Hurricane Dora — in particular, the trade winds that blow across Hawaii — affect the state in such a manner from hundreds of miles away.\n\n“I think we’re seeing this in many different parts of the world, fires from California to Colorado,” Green said, noting he has been contacted by “several governors” on the impact of the wildfires and shared their experiences.\n\n“It is difficult now in a time where global warming is combined with strengthening storms and drought,” he said, and vowed that the state would do whatever it could in its power to better anticipate such disasters.\n\nThe state is short on supplies and equipment, including helicopters and personnel, he said, including the difficulties of ensuring firefighters and police are paid adequately.\n\n“But this is going to be a priority,” Green said. “Climate change is here and it’s affecting the islands, and I think that’s what we’re seeing with this fire.”\n\nHotel guests staying near wildfire area were told to shelter in place, Maui mayor says\n\nAs wildfires broke out in west Maui Tuesday, ultimately destroying the community of Lahaina, people staying in nearby hotels were told not to evacuate, the mayor of Maui County said Thursday.\n\n“All of the hotels were asked to shelter in place,” said Mayor Richard Bissen during a news conference.\n\nMost full-service hotels in the area are located in Kaanapali — about 4 miles away from Lahaina — which Bissen said was not endangered by the fires.\n\nThe mayor said permanent residents were evacuated, but the roads were not in good enough shape to support a full exit from the hotels, especially as power poles were knocked over.\n\nHe said visitors were told to shelter in place because they were trying to get emergency vehicles into Lahaina and not have this bottleneck.”\n\nMaui mayor says Lahaina is “all gone”\n\nThe heart of Lahaina Town, the Maui community hardest hit by wildfires, has been completely wiped out, the county’s mayor said Thursday.\n\nHe said winds looked like they came from Mauka down to Makai. He detailed structures in the area that were burned beyond repair.\n\nOfficials declined to update the death toll in Lahaina, which had been placed at 53 earlier Thursday afternoon, saying they are still trying to determine how many people are missing.\n\n“We’re going to try our very best to identify those that have perished so that the families can have that closure and have that understanding,” Bissen said.\n\nAt least 36 dead as devastating wildfires sweep across Maui. Here's what you need to know\n\nAt least 36 people have been killed in Maui County as wildfires sweep across parts of the island, county officials said late Wednesday.\n\nIf you’re just joining us, catch up on the latest from Hawaii here:\n\nAmong the most devastated areas: Much of the western Maui community of Lahaina, where about 12,000 people live, is destroyed and hundreds of families there have been displaced, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said. More than 270 structures have been impacted in Lahaina, county officials said. In addition to the homes and businesses that were wiped out, the toll on historical and cultural sites in Lahaina has been devastating, a CNN analysis of new Maxar Technologies satellite imagery shows. The images, taken at 11:03 a.m. local time Wednesday, show that one of the largest banyan trees in the US – the size of an entire city block and more than 60 feet high – has been burnt. It was imported from India in 1873, Hawaii’s Tourism Authority says.\n\nSome are unaccounted for: Three helicopters from the US Coast Guard and US Navy were used in search and rescue efforts along the west Maui coastline, and a federal team arrived Wednesday to help search efforts in the Lahaina area, officials said.\n\nCell service out for thousands in Maui: It could take days or even weeks to fix networks. Officials have been using satellite phones to communicate with providers on the west side of Maui to restore power to the area, Lt. Gov. Sylvia Luke said. Emergency and evacuation response efforts have been hampered by widespread cell service outages, which have prevented people from calling 911 or updating loved ones about their status, according to authorities.\n\nPower outages: More than 11,000 customers on Maui were without power as of 11 p.m. Wednesday local time (5 a.m. ET Thursday), according to PowerOutage.us, accounting for about 15% of the island’s customers. Power crews are working to repair downed lines and additional crews are being deployed from Oahu, Hawaiian Electric said in a news release.\n\nMany in shelters: More than 2,100 people were in four emergency shelters in Maui on Tuesday night, the mayor’s office said. While there’s enough shelter for an emergency response for a few days, “there’s not enough shelter for long term living,” the governor told CNN.\n\nVisitors urged to leave: Maui County officials are asking visitors to leave Lahaina and Maui as soon as possible, noting seats were available on outgoing flights. More than 11,000 people were flown out of Maui on Wednesday, according to Hawaii Department of Transportation director Ed Sniffen. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green strongly discouraged nonessential travel to Maui, but a tourism official of the island state emphasized that other parts of Hawaii, such as Oahu and Waikiki are still open and have occupancy.\n\nHospitals overwhelmed: Hospitals on Maui were overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation, Luke told CNN Wednesday. Some patients should be taken elsewhere because Maui hospitals aren’t equipped for extensive burn treatment, but transportation challenges have made that difficult, Luke said.\n\nHere’s how you can help Hawaii wildfire victims: Click here to support relief efforts. Impact Your World will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates with more ways to help.\n\nWhite House is \"working very closely with Hawaii\" but won't comment on disaster declaration\n\nThe White House is “working very closely with Hawaii” as the state struggles with devastating wildfires that have left dozens dead Thursday, according to National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications Jon Kirby.\n\nHowever, he came short of announcing the approval of an emergency declaration.\n\nA White House official told CNN that Hawaii has asked for shelter supplies from FEMA, including water, food, cots, and blankets. FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton and his team are in Oahu, and he has mobilized an Incident Management Assistance Team to help with the federal response, the official added.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is “treating this with all the due gravity and the seriousness that the climate crisis deserves,” Kirby said.\n\nBiden, in his statement earlier, had said he has ordered federal assets to assist with wildfire response, pointing to the Hawaiian National Guard that’s mobilizing Chinook helicopters “to help with fire suppression and search and rescue on the Island of Maui” as well as response and rescue from the US Coast Guard and Navy fleets. Marines, he added, “are providing Black Hawk Helicopters to fight the fires on the Big Island.”\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green said earlier Wednesday he expects to submit a request for a presidential disaster declaration “in the next 36 to 48 hours.” Green said the White House “has been incredibly supportive.”\n\nThese areas are still affected by the Maui wildfires\n\nWildfires continue to burn the island of Maui, destroying homes, businesses and historic buildings. Search and rescue efforts are still ongoing as more than 11,000 customers remain without power.\n\nHere’s a map of the impacted areas:\n\nThis Maui resident lost his home in the wildfires and is still looking for his family members\n\nMaui resident Dustin Kaleiopu, who evacuated due to the wildfires, said Thursday that he has lost his home.\n\n“I can say everything in Lahaina is gone,” he told CNN, adding that the aerial footage of how his hometown had transformed overnight was “devastating to see.”\n\n“Everyone that I know and love, everyone that I’m related to, that I communicate with, my colleagues, friends, family — we’re all homeless,” he said.\n\nKaleiopu said he and his grandfather met up with his brother and mother after evacuating to the other side of the island.\n\nKaleiopu said he has not been able to establish contact with a lot of his family members.\n\n“I have extended family, my grandmother, my uncle, my friends, family members that we’re looking for,” he said. “So many people have gone missing. I will say that that is an unspoken fact that the death toll is way higher than 36. And we just hope that it is not confirmed to be, like I said, too much higher than that number. But there was a mass casualty event that happened this week,” he said."
