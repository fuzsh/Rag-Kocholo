        "text": "Representative Angus McKelvey has served the 10th House District (Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kapalua, Maalaea, Kihei, North Kihei) since 2006. He was born in Honolulu and has lived in Lahaina his whole life, and knows the importance of infrastructure development in his community, particularly the need for the by-pass and other alternate roads, and a 24/7 emergency medical facility.\n\nAs an advocate of small business, Representative McKelvey continues to push for the streamlining of the Procurement Code and government efficiency to facilitate construction projects which support jobs and our local economy. He is also a strong supporter of renewable energy programs, high-tech, agriculture and sustainability programs.\n\nJob preservation and job creation are critical to Neighbor Island communities, and Representative McKelvey would like to encourage the use of more innovative ways to keep our economy strong, particularly in the area of clean, high-tech jobs to continue to provide opportunities for our college graduates entering the job market, and our service men and women returning home. Providing incentives for companies to invest in Hawaii and our people will keep our economy moving forward."
