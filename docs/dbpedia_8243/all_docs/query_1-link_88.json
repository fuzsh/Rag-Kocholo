She was redistricted to District 5 in 2002 and with Senator J. Kalani English redistricted to District 6, Baker ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, winning with 2,107 votes.[13] She won the general election with 5,556 votes (49.1%) against Republican nominee Don Couch.[14] In 2004, Baker and Couch were both unopposed in their primaries,[15] setting up a rematch. She once again won the general election, with 8,271 votes (56.3%) against Couch.[16] Baker won the 2008 primary with 2,646 votes (67.2%),[17] and won the general election with 8,506 votes (53.7%) against Republican nominee Jan Shields.[18]\n\nIn 2012, Baker was redistricted to District 6, and with English redistricted to District 7, Baker was unopposed in the August primary, winning with 3,457 votes,[19] and won the general election with 9,808 votes (67.3%) against Republican nominee Bart Mulvihill,[20] her primary challenger from 2008, having changed parties.\n\nAfter over 30 years in public service, Baker announced her retirement at the end of the 2022 legislative session.[21][22]\n\nLegislative priorities\n\n[edit]\n\nBaker was the co-chair of the Senate Women's Legislative Caucus and advocated for women's rights.[22] She has also pushed for legislation on health care policy and kupuna care.[23]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBaker is a cancer survivor and has volunteered with the American Cancer Society.[22]\n\nDuring the 2023 Maui fire, Baker lost her Lahaina apartment while giving visitors a ride to the airport.[24]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
