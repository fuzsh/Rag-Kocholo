        "text": "University of Hawaiʻi's Economic Research Organization is working on an analysis of the impact of the fires on Maui. The study is still underway, but the report will likely be out within a few weeks, and it will go far beyond numbers.\n\nAs recovery efforts continue on Maui, more survivors of the historic wildfires are sharing their stories. One of those survivors is Sule Gordon. An artist, musician and drummer, Gordon is the husband of Adi Gordon, and father of three daughters, all under the age of six. His home in Wahikuli was destroyed.\n\nAs relief efforts continue on Maui, many local musicians are using their talents to raise money for those displaced by the wildfires. That includes ukulele master Jake Shimabukuro. He recently turned the upcoming two-day Hana Hou Festival into a benefit concert for Hawaiʻi Community Foundation's Maui Strong fund.\n\nOver the weekend, U.S. Rep. Jill Tokuda and her office had planned a Town Hall to hear from local residents on the West Side of Maui about their concerns. When it became clear that the basic needs of many residents were unmet, Tokuda pivoted. The Town Hall was converted to a federal resource fair. Tokuda called the public’s response \"overwhelming.\"\n\nAs crews continue to identify victims of the Lāhainā wildfire, Gov. Josh Green spoke with The Conversation to provide updates on recovery efforts, share his thoughts on the Emergency Alarm System and discuss the recent reassignment of the Water Commission deputy director.\n\nMuch of the focus on the Maui wildfires has been on the physical needs of the survivors and the property that they lost. But it's also important to address the psychological needs of those impacted. The Hawaiʻi Department of Health is offering crisis mental health services to those experiencing emotional or psychological stress as a result of the fires. Read and listen to the full story from The Conversation's Russell Subiono.\n\nThe Maui wildfire is now the deadliest in the country in the last century. Hilton Raethel, head of Healthcare Association of Hawaiʻi, is doing everything he can to help those affected. He talked with The Conversation's Catherine Cruz about what access to care looks like in West Maui."
