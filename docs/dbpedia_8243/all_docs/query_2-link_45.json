Parents: Rev. Dan McGilvary and Sophia Royce BRADLEY. Cornelia Harriet Petit McGilvary was born on 11 Mar 1868 in Chiang mai. Parents: Rev. Dan McGilvary and Sophia Royce BRADLEY.\n\nShe was married to William Harris in 1897.\n\nRev. Dan McGilvary was born about 1830. He died in 1911 in Chiang mai. From the Chiang Mai Newsletter, by Dr. Ted Brown: \"Dr. and Mrs. Daniel McGilvary are acknowledged to be the first Christian missionaries in Chiang Mai. McGilvary had arrived in Bangkok in 1858, where he met his bride, Sophia. She was the daughter of the pre-eminent Dan Beach Bradley, M.D., who had been practicing missionary medicine in Bangkok for over two decades at that point. McGilvary's father-in-law introduced him to Jao (prince) Kawilorot, the last absolute ruler of Chiang Mai. Kawilorot was on one of his regular visits to Bangkok to pay tribute to the King of Siam. Dr. McGilvary obtained an audience with Kawilorot and soon developed a friendship with him. The Prince invited Dr. McGilvary to \"see the people of Laos,\" and opened the door for his missionary expedition to Chiang Mai.\n\nIn 1867, The McGilvary family, including 2 young children, traveled upriver, embarking from Nakorn Sawan by steamboat, continuing by canoes in the shallows and finally arriving by poleboat. The trip took thirteen weeks.\n\nUpon arrival in Chiang Mai, there was no inn at which the McGilvary family could stay. Such enterprises did not then exist. Following custom, they took shelter under an open-air market sala. There, they used draped cloth to cordon off a section of the sala so as to afford a tiny degree of privacy. With minimal comforts, the McGilvarys remained there for two years, preaching Christian faith, as best they could. People were very curious to see this family of white people, to touch their skin and see them eat with knives and forks. However, little evangelical progress was made.\n\nLater, McGilvary was allowed by the Prince to move to a site which is today the location of Chiang Mai First Church, adjacent to the Nawarat bridge. The Prince gave the land to the Presbyterian missionaries, as was his right. Nonetheless, it already had an owner who wasn't happy about having to summarily give up his land. As he was a neighbour, the mission decided it was best to pay him, but did so quietly so as not to get the attention of Kawilorot.\n\nDr. McGilvary had brought some medications along. Witnessing the great suffering from illness among the natives, he started dispensing medications from his home. He introduced lifesaving quinine to the North. Even fragments of a pill could have miraculous results. Dr. McGilvary lived in Chiang Mai for many years, visiting and preaching to the locals. He was known as \"Pau Kru Luang,\" or \"Great Father Teacher.\" He lived into his 80's, and died in Chiang Mai in 1911. McGilvary Theological Seminary, located on Doi Saket Kao Road, honours the evangelical work of Dr. and Mrs. McGilvary.\n\nMcGilvary was followed by other Presbyterian missionaries who were truly doctors, the first three being Dr. Vrooman, Dr. Cheek and Dr. Cary, in that order. Dr. Vrooman and Dr. Cary stayed only a few years. Dr. Cheek, who arrived in 1875, was the most colourful and tragic missionary doctor in Chiang Mai's history. Dr. McGilvary recruited Cheek from his home state of North Carolina and obviously had high hopes for him. The two became brothers-in-law when Dr. Cheek married one of Dr. Bradley's other daughters, Sarah Adorna.\"\n\nHe was married to Sophia Royce BRADLEY on 6 Dec 1860. Children were: Catherine Emilie McGilvary, Evander Bradley McGilvary, Cornelia Harriet Petit McGilvary, Margaret Alexandra McGilvary, Norwood A.
