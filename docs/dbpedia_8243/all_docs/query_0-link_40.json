This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of MEMA's response to the wildfires, addressing communication failures and identifying areas for improvement in emergency responses. While internal reports from the Maui Police Department and the Maui Fire Department have been conducted, this external review seeks to offer an independent perspective on MEMA's actions during the crisis. The study comes amidst ongoing investigations by the Hawaii Attorney General's office and other agencies into the events surrounding the wildfires.\n\nNon-congregate FEMA sheltering program has been extended, June 10\n\nThe Maui News\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved the State of Hawai’i’s request for a final 30-day extension of the temporary emergency Non-Congregate Sheltering (NCS) program, which has been in operation for nearly 10 months. The program is now set to end on June 10, 2024, according to a press release from the state.\n\nMaui community mobilizes to protect water quality from runoff after Lahaina fires\n\nNPR, Lauren Sommer, Ryan Kellman\n\nDebris from hundreds of buildings destroyed by wildfire in Lahaina, Maui still needs to be cleared. The community is making a slow recovery from the August 2023 fire, which claimed more than 100 lives. And concerns have been high that the disaster could also damage another valued part of Lahaina: the ocean. An urban fire of this magnitude has never been seen directly next to a sensitive marine ecosystem. A big question has been: is the water safe? Liz Yannell, program manager at Hui O Ka Wai Ola, a community-led group that measures water quality, is part of a coalition that mobilized in the wake of the fire to closely monitor the water quality off Lahaina. More than 2,000 buildings burned, including their appliances, plastics, car batteries and other potentially toxic materials. Those chemicals could runoff into the ocean, especially during heavy tropical rainstorms. So far, the water contamination readings have been lower than expected. Even after the group's lab burned down in Lahaina, staff and volunteers mobilized as quickly as they could to keep up their sampling efforts, aided by a FEMA grant. Their results are supplemented by data from a broad coalition also doing water sampling, including the University of Hawaii at Manoa, the Surfrider Foundation and state and federal agencies.\n\nFEMA approves final extension for temporary housing for wildfire survivors\n\nHawaii News Now\n\nFEMA has approved a final 30-day extension of temporary emergency Non-Congregate Shelter for fire survivors. The program which has been running for nearly 10 months is now set to end on June 10. The Red Cross will be assisting the transition out of the program. Meanwhile, the state will be holding two housing resource fairs on May 18 at the Hyatt Mau Regency Resort and on June 1 at the Royal Lahaina resort from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nFEMA specialists to offer advice on how to rebuild stronger, safer homes after wildfires\n\nMaui Now\n\nSpecialists from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be available May 13-25 at Ace Hardware in Kīhei to offer free advice to homeowners on how to rebuild their homes stronger and safer after the August wildfires. The specialists will be at Ace, located at 1280 South Kīhei Road, from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday only. The specialists can answer questions and offer home-improvement tips and proven methods to help reduce damage from disasters. Most information is aimed at general contractors or those who do the work on their own.\n\nSPACE WEATHER\n\n'Extreme' geomagnetic storm that painted Earth with auroras this weekend was the most powerful in 21 years\n\nLive Science, Harry Baker\n\nBetween May 10 and May 12, Earth experienced its most powerful geomagnetic storm in over two decades due to a series of solar storms hitting our planet, causing vibrant aurora displays and temporary disruptions to satellites and power grids. These storms, triggered by solar flares from a massive sunspot, weakened Earth's protective field and led to auroras visible as far south as Florida. While initially forecasted as a severe G4 disturbance, the storm briefly reached extreme G5 status, matching historic events like the Carrington Event of 1859. Despite concerns of potential satellite and infrastructure damage, the impacts were limited to minor power grid irregularities and temporary satellite disruptions.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 9, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nFEMA Is Still Spending Millions on Hundreds of Empty Housing Units For Maui Fire Survivors\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Cammy Clark\n\nFEMA is paying for nearly 500 empty condos, apartments, and houses as part of its program to house Maui wildfire survivors, totaling nearly $200 million paid to three out-of-state property management companies. The program aims to move fire survivors out of hotel rooms and into longer-term housing but has faced challenges in filling these units, largely due to location issues and strict federal regulations. While the program has successfully housed some survivors, such as Joy Newman, others have faced difficulties matching available housing options with their needs. FEMA has also extended its deadline for reimbursing the state for housing costs, with ongoing efforts to find homes for remaining survivors in hotel programs.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MAY 8, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nExpert raises new concerns about Maui County’s ability to respond to upcoming fire season\n\nHawaii News Now\n\nMaui County faces growing concerns about its ability to respond to new wildfire emergencies as the summer fire season approaches. An investigation reveals that during the Lahaina fire disaster, there was no evidence of a wildfire plan in place to guide emergency responses. The lack of a plan hampered response efforts, with leadership appearing fragmented and unaware of the severity of the situation. Experts emphasize the need for a coordinated response plan, training, and resource allocation to prepare for potential future wildfire incidents, highlighting areas where improvements are crucial in emergency management.\n\nHawaii Is Entering a Dangerous Fire Season. Here’s What Will Be Different Post-Lahaina\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Marcel Honore\n\nHawaii is gearing up for a potentially intense wildfire season following the 2023 Lahaina fires, with emergency responders and officials implementing lessons learned to enhance preparedness. Strategies include deploying more resources like engines and tankers, clearing fire breaks, activating emergency operations centers earlier, and implementing power grid shutdown protocols during high-risk conditions. Community involvement and education are emphasized, with efforts to promote defensible spaces around homes and enhance collaboration with residents for effective emergency planning. Utilities are also developing safety plans, albeit cautiously, considering Hawaii's unique weather forecasting challenges. Despite progress, long-term efforts are needed, such as investing in fire-fighting equipment, vegetation management, and community engagement to mitigate wildfire risks across the islands.\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 9, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nHalf of rental units reserved for Maui fire victim are sitting vacant/housing deadline extended\n\nHawaii News Now, Daryl Huff\n\nHawaii News Now reports new details have emerged about rental units being reserved for Maui fire victims. The article says more than 600 units, mostly former vacation rentals, are still vacant even as taxpayers pay above-market rent for them. The article says FEMA is paying about $1,000 a day for his hotel and expenses and $5,100 a month for vacant rentals that are waiting for paperwork to be completed so survivors can move in. The FEMA coordinator for Maui, Curtis Brown said the process takes at best a month for background checks and matching survivors to a unit, but is often longer.\n\nIn related news, the Honolulu Civil Beat reports FEMA announced on Monday that it will continue to reimburse fire survivors for temporary housing for another month, until May 10. The program was supposed to end this Thursday. FEMA’s Bob Fenton, who leads the agency’s Maui fire recovery efforts, expects to have most of the people who are eligible for its direct-lease program moved into the more stable and less expensive housing by that time. The article says to do that, the program will have to greatly pick up its pace as only 697 households have moved into a direct lease over the last five months, a little more than half of the 1,300 or so eligible households. Gov. Josh Green’s office said in a statement Monday that he’s encouraged by the deadline extension, “as we have been in constant collaboration with FEMA and other federal partners in efforts to get our displaced residents into longer-term housing.”\n\nFEMA Extends Deadline To Reimburse State For Maui Fire Survivors Housed In Pricey Hotels\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Cammy Clark\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency will continue to reimburse the state for Maui fire survivors’ housing for another month, picking up the tab for people temporarily housed in pricey resort hotels and condos. The state would have been on the hook starting Thursday for paying the costs of all fire survivors still living in the hotels. But FEMA will continue to pay until May 10, officials announced Monday.\n\nAs of Monday, 2,694 fire survivors are living in 11 hotels. They make up 1,068 households, which is 16 fewer than a day earlier and 100 fewer than a week ago, according to the American Red Cross, which has a $500 million contract with the state to run the program. The Legislature is in the midst of its budget process and already wrestling with how to deal with the escalating Maui fire recovery expenses that the state budget director said in February were expected to cost the state $600 million this year.\n\nTUESDAY, APRIL 2, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nState acquires former hotel to house Maui fire survivors\n\nHonolulu Star Advertiser, Andrew Gomes\n\n(Paywalled) Between 350 and 450 Maui wildfire survivors in early May should begin moving into a former hotel in Kihei now owned by the state.\n\nMONDAY, APRIL 1, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nIndigenous Pacific wildfire survivors on Maui can finally get FEMA help\n\nGrist, Anita Hofschneider\n\nThe community of legal migrants from Pacific island nations is known as the Compact of Free Association, or COFA, citizens. That COFA citizens weren’t eligible for any aid is attributed to an inadvertent mistake in drafting the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. The new law that corrects this error was included in the federal spending bill approved last month. Members of this community who were denied crucial support in the wake of Lāhainā’s destruction are expected to be the first to benefit.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 29, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nCentral Maui property chosen as dump site for Lahaina fire debris\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Cammy Clark\n\nThe Honolulu Civil Beat reports a permanent dump site has been selected for the non-recyclable debris that is being cleared from the five-mile burn zone in Lahaina. The site was chosen because it is a safe distance from the ocean, homes, schools and hospitals. Once the permanent site is designed and built, which will take about a year, all debris and ash staged temporarily in Olowalu will be transferred there.\n\nThe article says FEMA will reimburse the county for most if not all the transportation cost from the temporary to the permanent dump site, as well as the weight-based “tipping fees” in Central Maui, but the county is on the hook for the cost of constructing the $40 million permanent site. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said he hopes the county can quickly get the site up and running so that some of the fire debris does not need to be brought to the temporary site at all.\n\nTemporary Kamehameha III Elementary School campus transferred to DOE, set to open April 1\n\nMaui Now, Wendy Osher\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers announced on Tuesday the successful installation and turnover of the newly constructed temporary campus for King Kamehameha III Elementary School students to the Hawai‘i State Department of Education.\n\nUSACE reports the temporary school comprises 336 modular units across 38 buildings, including classrooms, restrooms, a dining room, community space, administrative offices and learning resources areas. With the key handover, the DOE will proceed with furnishing and installing telecommunication equipment before opening the school in the fourth school quarter on April 1, 2024.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 27, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nConverting Maui vacation rentals to longer-term housing causing frustration for owners\n\nThe Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Dan Nakaso\n\nGov. Josh Green had threatened to ban short-term rentals if owners of 3, 000 Maui vacation rentals did not provide stable housing by Friday. A part-time Maui couple's decision to convert their vacation rentals into longer-term housing for Maui fire survivors followed weeks of frustration, cancellations by repeat loyal visitors over whether they are welcome on the Valley Isle and the threat by Gov. Josh Green to shut down Maui's short-term rental market.\n\nFEMA\n\nWill there be a government shutdown? Congress is running out of time to strike a deal\n\nUSA Today, Riley Beggin\n\nUSA Today reports Congress has until Friday to reach a spending agreement, or the nation will face a partial government shutdown. The article notes a shutdown means all officials and federal agencies that aren't deemed “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors. If the government does shut down, thousands of federal employees would be furloughed. CNN reports federal agencies have already begun taking steps to prepare for a potential shutdown. An additional set of government agencies and programs are funded through March 8, including DHS.\n\nIn New Hampshire, WMUR News 9 reports Rep. Chris Pappas says he’s concerned about what this could mean for damage assessment applications in New Hampshire, specifically in the seacoast region of the state where recent storms battered coastal communities. “All the important work that federal agencies do, including at FEMA, could be disrupted if the government shuts down in March,” Pappas said. Pappas added that the state has made a request for aid following those storms and continues to urge the Biden administration to approve it.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 26, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green speaks on Lahaina recovery efforts, 6 months after the tragedy, while visiting D.C.\n\nSpectrum News, Michael Tsai\n\nSpectrum News reports Hawaii Gov. Josh Green governor praised the support the state has received from the Biden administration and FEMA during an interview while attending the National Governors Association winter meeting this weekend. Green said the state’s focus over the next six months will be to continue moving those displaced by the August 2023 wildfires into more permanent housing.\n\nThe Honolulu Civil Beat reports Maui has become a popular stop for federal dignitaries since the Lahaina Wildfire. The article says five Cabinet members, the speaker of the House, the head of FEMA and the assistant secretary of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers — have made the long trip to the middle of the Pacific to see the devastation for themselves, hear the harrowing stories of survivors and pledge federal support. The administration “has sent out their leadership and their expertise and their money,” U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz said in an interview Saturday. “And the Cabinet, at the direction of President Biden, has been asked to fly to Maui, to be in regular contact on the phone, and to try to be maximally helpful.” President Joe Biden, the first sitting president to make an official visit to Maui, told a large crowd of survivors in August at the Lahaina Civic Center: “The entire country is here for you.”\n\nConverting Maui vacation rentals to longer-term housing causing frustration for owners\n\nHonolulu Star Advertiser, Dan Nakaso\n\nA part-time Maui couple’s decision to convert their vacation rentals into longer-term housing for Maui fire survivors followed weeks of frustration, cancellations by repeat loyal visitors over whether they are welcome on the Valley Isle and the threat by Gov. Josh Green to shut down Maui’s short-term rental market.\n\nHawaii State And County Officials Seeking $1B From Legislature for Maui Recovery\n\nInsurance Journal\n\nHawaii state and county officials have requested about $1 billion from the Legislature to help cover Maui wildfire recovery expenses in the near term.\n\nGov. Josh Green’s administration had budgeted $199 million for such expenses but are now expecting they may need $561 million under a “worst-case” scenario, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 22, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nTiny homes meant for displaced Maui fire survivors are sitting empty\n\nThe Washington Post, Reis Thebault\n\nA paywalled Washington Post story reports thousands of West Maui families have been living in American Red Cross shelters at local hotels since the Lahaina wildfire. The article looks at one family that has been shuffled between facilities seven times as the resorts make space for the slow return of tourists to the island and their plight to move into a promised tiny home community for the next two years.\n\nThe article says a project to provide 88 tiny homes, overseen by a local social services organization called Family Life Center, has been tangled in red tape. The article highlights the often-maddening world of building affordable housing on Maui, where a notoriously long permitting process and a thicket of regulations has stalled projects for decades. The first units arrived on the island within weeks of the August fire, and the center hoped families would be able to move in by October, but they still sit empty as some 4,700 people in hotels desperately wait for more permanent housing.\n\nThe article goes on to say the project initially received international attention, but soon after the spotlight faded, the project became a poster child for postponement. Both families and officials are concerned because the hotel program will end in April if not extended and funding for the vacation rentals, which comes largely from FEMA, will be phased out over the next two years. “The only way we’ll have any place for these people to go is if we have these ADUs built,” said one local official. “We’re going to need to build a lot of new ones — like thousands of new ones.”\n\nHawaii Public Radio also published a story on housing overnight noting state lawmakers are concerned there may not be enough housing in place to shelter displaced Lahaina residents by the time FEMA leaves next February. If residents aren’t re-housed by the time FEMA leaves, the state may need to pay ongoing shelter costs of more than $1 million a day, which is currently not in the state budget.\n\nWEDNESDAY, FEB 21, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nWill An RV Be Better Than The ‘Chaos’ Of A Hotel Room?\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Brittany Lyte\n\nIn Hawaii, the Honolulu Civil Beat reports Lahaina fire survivors are taking a risk by moving ahead with a creative temporary housing solution that they view as an upgrade from FEMA's hotel rooms. The article follows one couple who are buying a trailer from the mainland to give them a more self-sufficient housing option than the FEMA paid hotel room they have been staying in since the fire. Mario Siatris is waiting on the trailer be bought with some of his insurance money and says while he’s grateful for the hotel stay, he doesn’t want to rely on FEMA any longer. “It’s chaos,” he says. “I just want to get back to the land, back home.” Siatris is not eligible for long-term housing through FEMA’s direct-lease program until his home insurance payouts are used up.\n\nMaui Makes A Big Ask As Rising Wildfire Recovery Costs Prompt Talk Of State Budget Cuts\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Kevin Dayton\n\nMayor Richard Bissen made a new appeal to a key Senate committee on Tuesday for $401 million over three years to develop desperately needed housing on Maui as state lawmakers struggled to come to grips with wildly escalating recovery costs from the deadly Aug. 8 Lahaina wildfire. Luis Salaveria, director of the state Department of Budget and Finance, confirmed the fire recovery costs for this year alone are expected to top $600 million, which is the amount Gov. Josh Green’s administration originally budgeted for the recovery effort over four years. Those rising costs have prompted the Senate to ask Salaveria to develop contingency plans for imposing state spending cuts of 10% and 15%, and senators suggested that state grant-in-aid funding for nonprofit organizations may also be dramatically reduced. The state has been incurring about $1 million per day in costs to shelter Maui fire survivors — including many who remain in West Maui hotels — and it appears the state may not get as much federal reimbursement as the state anticipated, according to the memo. State officials knew they would need to cover much of the cost of temporary housing for fire survivors up front, but the Green administration expected some 90% of that cost would be reimbursed by FEMA. In fact, lawmakers report that FEMA has been rejecting large numbers of claims for reimbursement. State and federal obligations for federal operations support and direct federal assistance are at about $1.2 billion so far, and the state’s share of that thus far is $114 million.\n\n‘We need your help’: Maui mayor, state seek nearly $1B for wildfire recovery from legislators (video)\n\nHawaii News Now, Daryl Huff\n\nThe Maui fire disaster is also becoming a crisis for the state budget, as many early estimates of what state taxpayers will cover are proving too optimistic. Maui’s mayor and the state administration came in with budget requests Tuesday, adding up to nearly a billion dollars. It means that the reality of the cost of the Maui wildfire disaster is now sinking in at the capitol, leaders say, potentially dashing hopes for things like more mental health and social services, higher public worker salaries for shortage positions, and even middle-class tax reform. Maui Mayor Richard Bissen made a somber appearance Tuesday before the state Senate Ways and Means Committee, saying he was speaking for traumatized survivors of the fires.\n\nWEDNESDAY, FEB. 14, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\n$15,000 hotel bill for Maui evacuee sparks call for new housing solutions\n\nHawaii News Now, Mahealani Richardson\n\nHawaii News Now offered a lens into the costs and inefficiencies incurred in the provision of temporary housing for Lahaina wildfire survivors, as the hotel bill for a single survivor was reported to be $15,000 per month. FEMA responded to concerns about the costs and challenges following the wildfire, noting, “FEMA is working closely with the American Red Cross and the state to move wildfire survivors from hotels on Maui and O’ahu into more suitable housing. The hotel sheltering program is providing housing until Wednesday, April 10,” with Administrator Criswell underlining FEMA’s commitment to the survivors, adding, “We will continue to support you in this recovery for as long as it takes.”\n\nPerson on MPD's 'missing/unaccounted for' list identified as 101st Lahaina fire victim\n\nIsland News, Matthew Nuttle\n\nAuthorities on Maui have identified another person confirmed to have died in the Lahaina fire disaster – raising the official death toll to 101. The latest fire victim is identified as 76-year-old Paul Kasprzycki of Lahaina. Kasprzycki was one of the three people whose names remained on the Maui Police Department’s “credible list of missing/unaccounted for individuals.” As of Feb. 13, 2024, all 101-known fire victims have been identified. Two individuals remain on the missing/unaccounted for list. Those two have been identified as Robert H. Owens and Elmer Lee Stevens. Meanwhile, as more and more lots are cleared in Lahaina, many people are thinking about the next phase: Rebuilding. The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs wants to make sure everyone understands the importance of using licensed contractors for any job costing more than $1,500.\n\nTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2024\n\nEARTHQUAKES\n\nUnited States: Magnitude 5.7 Earthquake Strikes Hawaii; No Major Damage Reported\n\nThai News Service\n\nA magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the world's largest active volcano on Friday - Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii - knocking items off shelves and cutting power in a nearby town but not immediately prompting reports of serious damage.\n\nThe earthquake, which didn't cause a tsunami and which the U.S. Geological Survey initially reported as magnitude 6.3, was centered on Mauna Loa's southern flank at a depth of 37 kilometers, 2 kilometers southwest of Pahala.\n\nMONDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\n6 months after wildfires, FEMA administrator praises survivors for ‘resolve’\n\nHawaii News Now\n\nLimited media coverage continued over the weekend on FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell’s visit to Hawaii last week to check on Lahaina recovery efforts. Hawaii News Now reports Criswell said FEMA’s consideration of community throughout the recovery process should act as a model for future operations noting, “The federal government, the entire federal family is going to be here with you through the end of your recovery.” The article says FEMA has secured nearly 1,500 leased properties for survivors and more than 160 households have moved into temporary housing through FEMA’s Direct Lease program. Some residents say some landlords are not renewing their current tenants’ leases because they can get more money from FEMA for housing fire survivors. Any landlord who is not renewing their tenants’ leases to receive more federal funding will be disqualified from the program and reported to the state Attorney General.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii Public Radio reports some multigenerational Lahaina families have not yet found long-term housing. The article features the Faʻalogo family who were first placed in a Wailea hotel and are now at the Royal Lahaina Resort, which is only housing fire survivors. The Faʻalogo’s said the Royal Lahaina has been accommodating and helpful, but it's not easy to live in a hotel, \"We don't have a kitchen, we don't have a living room. It's just a standard hotel room. And six months has been a while and we know we have a long road ahead of us, and we know it's gonna be longer.” HPR asked FEMA about situations to accommodate multigenerational families. Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton said that, so far, the largest home they have been able to place a family in was a 7-bedroom unit. \"My parents or my grandma, it's hard explaining to them what's happening or how to deal with Red Cross, or how to deal with FEMA, because there are terms that they use or words that we can't translate into our language,\" Faʻalogo said. He went on to say the family is grateful for all the help and donations.\n\nThe Hawaii Free Press reports Fenton set a goal of moving 1,500 fire survivors out of hotels and into better temporary housing. So far, Fenton said FEMA’s Direct Lease program has moved over 160 households into temporary housing and found 1,500 leased properties for survivors.\n\nHawaii Governor: There’s Still ‘A Ton More Work To Do’ In Maui’s Fire Recovery\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Brittany Lyte\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green was joined by Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, SBA Administrator Isabel Casillas Guzman, and other government agencies during a joint press conference held Thursday six months after the August 2023 Lahaina wildfire. The Honolulu Civil Beat and Big Island Now report the leaders highlighted progress made over the past six months, current efforts, and the path forward for Maui’s recovery to include the money spent, the debris removed, the people housed, and the meals served. The article says more than $1.2 billion has been made available so far for federal agencies to spend on Maui’s recovery.\n\nThere are 4,961 fire survivors still being housed in FEMA-funded hotel rooms and vacation rentals, a number that peaked at nearly 8,000 right after the fire. The article says they continue to deal with ever-changing deadlines to vacate as government officials work on longer term solutions. FEMA has filled only 160 of the 1,415 residential units that it’s secured to shift displaced families out of hotel rooms and into neighborhoods. Nearly 1,400 families have applied for one of these long-term rentals, 40 percent of which are located outside of Lahaina.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said the lag in ushering applicants is partly an issue of matching displaced families with homes close to jobs and family. Some families lost vehicles in the fire, further complicating the prospects of long commutes to work. Other families simply don’t want to move away from the island’s west side.\n\nNBC News reports families whose loved ones died in the Maui wildfires could get $1.5 million each, but they must agree not to sue the state agencies and companies that are contributing to a victims' compensation fund. Gov. Green first announced a victims’ compensation fund in November, saying it would exceed $150 million. The fund, which will be open to applicants March 1, now stands at $175 million, he said on Thursday.\n\nHAPPY LUNAR NEW YEAR!\n\nWhat is Lunar New Year and how is it celebrated?\n\nAP, Deepa Bharath\n\nOn Feb. 10, Asian American communities around the U.S. will ring in the Year of the Dragon with community carnivals, family gatherings, parades, traditional food, fireworks and other festivities. In many Asian countries, it is a festival that is celebrated for several days. In diaspora communities, particularly in cultural enclaves, Lunar New Year is visibly and joyfully celebrated.\n\nIn the Chinese zodiac, 2024 is the Year of the Dragon. Different countries across Asia celebrate the new year in many ways and may follow a different zodiac.\n\nEnter the Year of the Dragon: A 2024 guide to Lunar New Year\n\nCNN, Text by Maggie Hiufu Wong, illustrations by Natalie Leung\n\nAt this very moment, millions of people around the world are busy preparing for one of the year’s biggest festivals – Lunar New Year, which marks the first new moon of the lunar calendar. This year, it falls on February 10, kicking off the 15-day Spring Festival.\n\nThe 15 Days of Lunar New Year & What They Mean\n\nNew York Public Library, Shirley Wong-Li\n\nLunar New Year (農曆新年) marks the first day of the year in the lunar calendar. The celebration generally runs for 15 days, with each day having special meaning and traditions to honor. The days' significance and customs vary between regions and beliefs. Many of the meanings also come from legends and folktales passed down from generation to generation. Among the many myths, there is one about Nüwa (女媧), the goddess who created the world. It is believed that she spent the first six days creating animals, the seventh-day creating humans, and the eighth day creating grains. Hence each day of the new year is considered to be the birthday of her creations. Then some folktales talk about the God of Wealth (財神) bringing good fortunes to people, about the God of Kitchen (灶神) watching households, and many more. No matter how different the meanings and traditions are, Lunar New Year is when people spend time with families and friends to celebrate traditions and make wishes for a good year to come.\n\nIn 2024, the Lunar Year, Year of the Dragon, begins on February 10 and celebrations culminate with the Lantern Festival on February 25.\n\nWEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2024\n\nHawaiian Electric focuses on wildfire safety in $190M grid plan\n\nPower Grid, Sean Wolfe\n\nThe Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has approved Hawaiian Electric’s $190 million Climate Adaptation Transmission and Distribution Resilience Program application, which the utility says is meant to help defend against the increasing threat of wildfires and harden its five island electric grids against severe weather-related events fueled by climate change.\n\nThe decision enables Hawaiian Electric to move forward with $95 million in funding granted under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) by matching it with $95 million to come from customers. By applying for and receiving the grant, Hawaiian Electric says it reduced the cost to customers by half. The estimated impact on a typical monthly bill for a residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours will be $0.17 on Oahu, $0.47 on Hawaii Island, and $0.39 in Maui County.\n\nFEMA and Partners Rally Massive Effort to Help Lahaina Rebound and Wildfire Survivors Heal\n\nTargeted News Service\n\nFEMA, in response to the wildfires in Lahaina, Maui, has played a pivotal role in facilitating the recovery efforts. They swiftly provided assistance to survivors, including financial aid, shelter, and resources for basic needs. FEMA coordinated with other federal agencies to address critical infrastructure and housing challenges, exemplified by the construction of a temporary school and negotiating leases for temporary housing units. They also oversaw the removal of hazardous materials and debris, ensuring public safety and environmental protection. Collaborating with cultural experts, FEMA respected local customs and integrated them into the cleanup process. FEMA's Disaster Survivor Assistance teams and Recovery Centers on Maui facilitated access to resources and applications for federal assistance. Additionally, FEMA initiated programs like Rental Assistance and Direct Lease to support survivors in transitioning to longer-term housing solutions. These efforts reflect FEMA's commitment to aiding individuals and communities in times of crisis and facilitating their journey toward recovery and stability.\n\nHigh school football gave hope after deadly Maui wildfire. Some players will be at the Super Bowl\n\nThe Maui News\n\nTeva Loft, a high school football player from Lahainaluna High School in Hawaii, who, along with three other team captains and three coaches, has been invited to attend Super Bowl LVIII as guests of the NFL. This invitation comes after their town was devastated by a deadly wildfire in August. Despite never having been to Las Vegas or watched an NFL game in person, they will serve as honorary coin toss captains at the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. The article highlights the significance of football in Lahainaluna and the resilience of its community in the face of tragedy. Loft and his teammates received the news of their Super Bowl invitation during a Zoom call with Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Marcus Mariota, who is also from Hawaii. The NFL recognizes the Lahainaluna football team's role in bringing their community together amidst adversity and honors them for their efforts in rebuilding. Additionally, the article mentions the positive developments for one of the players, Morgan \"Bula\" Montgomery, whose family found long-term housing through FEMA after being displaced by the fire.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 31, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nFEMA is developing a ‘last resort’ plan to house Maui fire survivors in Kaanapali\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Cammy Clark\n\nIn Hawaii, the Honolulu Civil Beat reports FEMA is looking at land near Lahaina to construct a temporary modular housing site for wildfire survivors. FEMA has submitted a draft Environmental Assessment of a 63-acres parcel of land called Kaanapali Town and the public has until Friday to weigh in on the plan to install 214 temporary homes. The group housing project won’t be necessary if FEMA can secure enough direct leases for all eligible households. But the agency is moving forward with the review to get it rolling just in case. FEMA’s Victor Inge says, “This is the absolute last resort. But when we go into a community where there’s been devastation, all the options are on the table.” Out of 25 evaluated properties around the island, the Kaanapali location was the top choice of FEMA, which “worked closely with state and county officials” and is only three miles from Lahaina.\n\nInge said FEMA is focusing on the more than 1,068 eligible households willing to participate in its direct lease program with secured units from property owners of second homes, vacation rentals and other rental units. About 750 of these eligible households are currently living in hotels. State Sen. Angus McKelvey, who represents West Maui, said he hopes the temporary group housing project does move forward, but with “dignified” modular homes — not “the next generation of trailers.” McKelvey went on to say, “This is about keeping the community intact. It’s one of the locations that is suitable to do this.”\n\nSome Maui residents fear programs aimed to house fire survivors could make other families homeless\n\nHawaii News Now, Chelsea Davis\n\nHawaii News Now reports some West Maui families say they fear even more people may end up homeless as an unintentional consequence of FEMA’s Direct Lease program designed to house fire evacuees. The article says some landlords are not renewing their tenants’ leases because they can get more money from the government housing fire survivors. The FEMA program pays landlords up to 175-percent of Fair Market Rent to house a fire survivor, which means they could get almost twice as much as they are getting now. FEMA’s Fredia Kelly said, “We have advised our Property Managers that if they believe property owners are giving their tenants notice just to house a survivor, FEMA will not accept their property into Direct Lease and that the tenant may report them to the Attorney General.”\n\nAnxiety Sets In For Family Displaced By Lahaina Fire As Moving Day Looms\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Brittany Lyte\n\nIn recent weeks a gnawing feeling of uncertainty has intensified for Randy and Marilou as more upheaval to their living situation approaches. The family’s time at the FEMA-funded condo where they’ve lived since late October after being displaced by the Aug. 8 wildfire in Lahaina is up at the end of this month. Federal officials have vowed to find the Dadezes new accommodations, but, with the move just days away, the family is still in the dark on exactly where they’ll go to next. All they know is what Randy said FEMA officials told him: his family will be relocated to a five-bedroom house somewhere in Lahaina, on or around Wednesday. Randy said he was told that his family would be able to stay in the house until February of next year. On one hand, the prospect of moving into a house instead of a hotel room is a big step toward normalcy for a family that’s lived in a church and three different resorts in the five months since the deadly fire ripped apart their lives. The lack of details, however, is anxiety-inducing.\n\nTemporary campus opening for King Kamehameha III Elementary pushed back\n\nStar Advertiser, Esme M. Infante\n\nStudents displaced from King Kamehameha III Elementary School, which was ravaged by the Lahaina wildfire in August, will now have to wait until April to occupy a new temporary campus being built for them in Pulelehua, according to the latest timeline from state school officials. The opening of the temporary campus being built in Pulelehua in West Maui, near the Kapalua Airport, has been pushed further back — and closer to the May 30 end of the state Department of Education school year — than at least some observers initially believed it would be. In late February, the site is expected to be handed over to the Hawaii DOE. The Army Corps of Engineers is designing and overseeing the installation; Aina Pono, a Native Hawaiian organization based in Waianae on Oahu, was awarded a $53.7 million contract by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for construction. Starting in the April 1 week, students and employees will be at the Pulelehua campus, where they are expected to finish the school year with quarter four. But complicating the DOE’s planning for quarter four and next school year has been some difficulty in discerning how many families plan to send their students to the Pulelehua campus, which is about 6 miles away from their original school in Lahaina town. Meanwhile, “health and safety remain top of mind in West Maui” in response to community concerns about the second phase of debris removal in Lahaina’s burn zone, just below the town’s three remaining operating public schools.\n\nInsurance companies are going after Hawaiian Electric to reimburse Lahaina fire claims\n\nGrist, Stewart Yerton (Honolulu Civil Beat)\n\nMore than 140 insurance industry plaintiffs have joined the cascade of lawsuits filed against utilities and landowners related to the Maui wildfires, a move that could set up a battle over resources available to pay victims of the disaster that killed 100 people and destroyed much of Lahaina in August.\n\nThe global insurance industry has swept into Honolulu state court, seeking to collect reimbursements for claims paid to policyholders. Those total more than $1 billion in West Maui for residential property alone, according to the latest data from the Insurance Division of the Hawaiʻi Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs.\n\nThe plaintiffs include names familiar to Hawaiʻi homeowners: insurers like State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., USAA Casualty Insurance Co., Island Insurance and Tradewind Insurance.\n\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nMaui County announces additional zones for safe water usage in Lahaina\n\nHawaiʻi Public Radio\n\nThe Unsafe Water Advisory for another portion of Lahaina has been removed. The Department of Water Supply stated buildings and homes in area L-4D now have unrestricted use. The zone is bordered by Honoapi‘ilani Highway, Kahoma Stream, Front Street and Kenui Street. Officials say water may have stagnated in plumbing while advisories were in effect. Customers should flush their lines by opening all taps running water for 10 minutes to remove any standing water in pipes.\n\nBroadbent & Associates Inc. Completes Assignment for Support on Maui Fires Emergency Response Efforts\n\nNevada Business\n\nBroadbent & Associates, Inc. (Broadbent), a leading environmental, water resource, and civil engineering firm, completes assistance to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 9, Emergency Response Section (ERS) in their response and recovery efforts to the devastating Maui fires in Maui, Hawai’i. Broadbent assisted in two primary ways: using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to map impacted fire zones, and assisting with surveying, removing, and disposing of household hazardous waste (HHW) and asbestos containing material (ACM).\n\nWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nMaui Wildfire Cleanup Advances to Debris Removal Phase\n\nENRCalifornia, James Leggate\n\nContractors hauled the first truckload of debris from homes destroyed by last year’s wildfires in Lahaina, Hawaii, on Jan. 16. The move marked the beginning of the second phase of debris removal efforts coordinated by federal, state and local officials. The fires on Maui last August, driven by dry conditions and high winds, killed at least 100 people and did $5.5 billion in damage to thousands of structures. Thousands of residents remain displaced. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green has said debris removal may take a year and estimated its cost at $1 billion. Other wildfire recovery efforts are also still underway. In November, USACE awarded a $53.7-million base contract to Pono Aina Management LLC of Waianae, Hawaii, for construction of a temporary elementary school campus in Lahaina for children whose school was destroyed in the fire. That project is scheduled for completion by the end of February. More temporary housing is also needed for displaced residents. In his “state of the state” address Jan. 22, Green said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing 17,000 survivors with rental assistance into 2025, and the American Red Cross is helping house more than 5,000 more in 30 hotels across Maui. USACE is currently working on the design for hundreds of temporary housing units at three sites. Jeff McCullick, USACE’s mission manager for temporary housing, said in a statement that officials could award a contract for construction at the first site as soon as February.\n\nTUESDAY, JANUARY 23, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nHawaii’s governor hails support for Maui and targets vacation rentals and housing shortage\n\nAP, Audrey McAvoy\n\nA widely distributed AP article reports Hawaii Gov. Josh Green used his annual State of the State address Monday to propose aggressive steps to shift more vacation rentals into residential use to meet both Maui and the state’s acute housing needs. The most urgent unmet need on Maui is now stable long-term housing for some 5,000 residents who are staying in hotel rooms. Green wants all 5,000 to move into long-term housing by March 1 and says the state has locked in about two-thirds of the needed housing. The article says FEMA and charitable organizations will be covering the rental costs.\n\nMaui County to Open a Special Permitting Office to Help Lahaina Rebuild\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Kevin Dayton\n\nLahaina will get a special office to expedite building permits for an estimated 1,200 properties that were damaged or destroyed in the Aug. 8 wildfire, and an outside contractor will be hired to help staff the operation, Maui officials said Monday. Mayor Richard Bissen said 5,368 fire survivors are still living in 32 hotels, and Maui County is pushing forward with an aggressive plan to replace the lost housing in a partnership with private, state and federal agencies. “I humbly stand before you today to express my plea for the prioritization of the care for our survivors, and ask that we stand in unity until every survivor has a place to call home,” the Maui mayor said during a briefing before the House Finance Committee and the Senate Ways and Means Committee. Bissen said the county is expecting $1 billion in support under the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s public assistance program, of which the local government share would be $95 million to $100 million. Maui County is asking the state to support the county by picking up 75% of that cost. Maui County Managing Director Josiah Nishita told lawmakers Monday the county plans to launch the expedited building permitting process for the 2,000 acres that were impacted by the fire. But staffing the new office has been a challenge.\n\nTUESDAY, JANUARY 16 - MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 2024\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nUnity walk draws 4,000 to support Lahaina as it steps closer to rebuilding after fire\n\nHonolulu Star Advertiser, Allison Schaefers\n\nA community that proved its mettle throughout the devastating Aug. 8 fire that wiped out historic Lahaina town and left at least 100 confirmed dead took a significant step forward together Saturday during the Ho‘ulu Lahaina Unity Gathering. A light mist was present as the 4.5-mile march wound from Lahaina Bypass Road to Launiupoko Beach Park where the crews of the four voyaging canoes — Hokule‘a, Hikianalia, Makali‘i and Mo‘okiha o Pi‘ilani — came ashore and were welcomed with culturally significant chanting, dance and ceremony. Some 4,000 people either participated in the walk or witnessed the rare arrival of all four of the Polynesian Voyaging Society canoes and their crews. The arrival of these navigators, including Nainoa Thompson, pwo navigator and Polynesian Voyaging Society CEO, coincided with an important turning point for the Lahaina community as it moves from recovery to rebuilding. They answered the call to show their support from big wave rider and waterman Archie Kalepa, whose Lele Aloha nonprofit group organized the unity gathering. Kalepa, who was born and raised in Lahaina, is a descendant of nine generations of Native Hawaiians going back to the konohiki, or traditional caretakers of their communities. He served as a captain on at least 12 deep-sea voyaging canoes and retired after 32 years as a Maui lifeguard, lifeguard captain and head of Maui County Ocean Safety. He also is one of five unpaid advisers to Mayor Richard Bissen to figure out how best to help the multiple, diverse needs of fire survivors, including the thousands of families still living in hotels who hope to eventually relocate into more comfortable, long-term housing.\n\nSBA extends fire relief deadline for those thought to be ineligible\n\nHonolulu Star Advertiser, Allison Schaefers\n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration has distributed more than $257.3 million in disaster loans for 1,391 applicants who sustained property damage from the Aug. 8 wildfires and high winds on Maui, but officials have extended the application period through Jan. 25 because they believe more people are qualified than have applied. Barbara Nitis, public information officer for the SBA’s Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience, Field Operations Center-West, said the deadline was Dec. 11 for the SBA’s property damage loans. However, a 45-day grace period is in effect and the deadline is rapidly approaching. “Homeowners, businesses, renters and private nonprofit organizations have until Jan. 25 to apply for property damage loans,” Nitis said. “Funds are available and people are not taking full advantage. Usually we only have a two-week grace period, but in this case it’s 45 days.” SBA records as of Wednesday showed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency referred 11,145 home registrations and 4,040 business registrations to SBA’s property damage loan program. Of those, 2,461 home registrants, or 22% of FEMA referrals, applied for SBA’s property damage loan program. Some 920 business registrants, or 22.7% of FEMA referrals, applied. SBA has approved more than $188.4 million for 1,115 Maui disaster loans for property damage for homes, and more than $62.4 million for 260 businesses or private nonprofits. Nitis said homeowners who apply for property damage loans are eligible for up to $500,000 to repair or replace real estate damage and up to $100,000 to replace personal property, including automobiles.\n\nMarking start of next phase, crews remove fire debris from first residential property in Lahaina\n\nHawaii News Now\n\nThe first of more than 2,000 burned properties in Lahaina has been cleared of fire debris. On Tuesday, government contractors scooped up layers of ash and old appliances from a home on Fleming Road. It all went into a plastic-lined dumptruck that slowly made it’s way south to the new Olowalu landfill. In a news release, Maui County said, “This milestone followed months of coordinated re-entry activities that allowed residents to gain access safely to their properties in each zone before debris removal began.” The debris removal is being done through a coordinated effort by FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA, Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, Maui County and private contractors. Officials said this marks the start of Phase 2, in which debris is sprayed with water and wrapped in thick industrial plastic before being transported to the Temporary Debris Storage site in Oluwalu. The 19-acre disposal site was approved by the county despite some backlash from community members. Teams spent over a month prepping the area, lining the ground with plastic to hold about 400,000 cubic yards of ash and debris. The county added that during the dumping process, Maui-based Native Hawaiian cultural advisors work alongside USACE debris removal teams to monitor and provide guidance on cultural priorities. “As operations increase in the coming days, there will be teams conducting debris removal on multiple properties at the same time,” Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said.\n\nMaui Renters Face ‘Increasingly Hostile Housing Market’ Despite Eviction Moratorium\n\nHonolulu Civil Beat, Paula Dobbyn\n\nA heightened wave of housing insecurity is sweeping Maui, particularly for renters.\n\nWhat was already a tight and expensive market before the August wildfires has contracted further as lucrative rent subsidies, scarce inventory and high demand entice landlords to replace existing tenants with those willing to pay much more, according to interviews with housing advocates, renters and property managers.\n\n“We’re seeing waves of displacement,” said Jordan Hocker, a tenant advocate with Maui Housing Hui, a grassroots organization. “People are getting pushed out into an increasingly hostile housing market.”\n\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 11, 2024\n\nHUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS #WEARBLUEDAY\n\n20 Ways You Can Help Fight Human Trafficking (Department of State)\n\nHuman trafficking affects millions across the globe.

FEMA’s TJ Dargan says the number of households living under long-term leases directly funded by FEMA will rise to 1,500 over the next month from 100 currently and would house a large portion of the 2,400 households who are still living in hotels months after August fire. FEMA’s hotel short-term stay funding runs out on Feb. 10 but Hawaii Gov. Josh Green has requested an extension that the agency is considering, Dargan said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Honolulu Civil Beat reports on a new $500 million agreement that aims to get all displaced Maui residents into long-term housing by July. The Maui Interim Housing Plan hopes this will avoid the need for a moratorium on vacation rentals. Funding comes from coalition of state, local and federal officials and nonprofit organizations of which $250 million will come from FEMA.\n\nJan. 25 grace period approaching to submit SBA disaster loan applications\n\nMaui Now\n\nThe deadline to apply for federal disaster assistance has passed; however, Hawaiʻi residents and businesses have been granted a 45-day grace period, until Thursday, Jan. 25, to submit their US Small Business Administration disaster loan applications for property damage caused by wildfires.\n\nThe last day for small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives and most private nonprofit organizations to apply for an SBA economic injury disaster loan is Friday, May 10, 2024.\n\nThe US Small Business Administration has approved more than $289.7 million in federal disaster loans for Hawai‘i businesses, nonprofits and residents impacted by the Maui wildfires. That includes more than $101.3 million for businesses and more than $188.4 million to homeowners and renters to help them rebuild and recover from the disaster.\n\nTHURSDAY, DECEMBER 26, 2023\n\nHawai'i Wildfires - YouTube\n\nPSA FEMA Assistance Videos to Share\n\nMONDAY, DECEMBER 12, 2023\n\nMaui scrambles to sign up wildfire survivors before FEMA deadline\n\nHawaii News Now\n\nHawaii News Now reports FEMA representatives at the Hawaii Civic Center in Lahaina were available on the last day to file for disaster assistance to help those that have not been able to file. FEMA says nearly 7,000 people have applied for aid, but they are not sure how many more still need to apply. FEMA and the SBA have provided over $305 million has been granted to wildfire survivors. FEMA has been working with local non-profits to get more people registered before the deadline.\n\nFEMA closing Kahului Disaster Recovery Center this Friday\n\nHonolulu Star-Advertiser\n\nThe Kahului Disaster Recovery Center on Maui is closing at 6 p.m. this Friday, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Lahaina Disaster Recovery Center, however, will remain open, and other resources will still be available to survivors of the Aug. 8 wildfires, according to FEMA. Today is the deadline to apply for FEMA disaster assistance, as well as disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. FEMA said those applying online have until midnight today to apply at DisasterAssistance.gov or via the FEMA mobile app or by calling the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362. FEMA says survivors can continue to get information, application updates or referrals to programs offered by FEMA, the U.S. Small Business Administration and other federal, state and local agencies and organizations at the Lahaina Disaster Recovery Center.\n\nLahaina school replacement 2-3 months away\n\nHonolulu Star-Advertiser, Esme M. Infante\n\nLate February or March is the earliest that a new temporary school being built to replace the King Kameha¬meha III Elementary School campus lost in the Lahaina fire will be ready for students and teachers to occupy, based on an Army Corps of Engineers timeline. Late February or March is the earliest that a new temporary school being built to replace the King Kameha-meha III Elementary School campus lost in the Lahaina fire will be ready for students and teachers to occupy, based on an Army Corps of Engineers timeline. Construction is already underway, but the school opening is further off — and closer to the May 30 end of the state Department of Education school year — than at least some observers initially thought it would be. Col. Jesse T. Curry, recovery field office commander for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, had said at a Sept. 26 news conference that the temporary campus in Pulelehua, near Kapalua Airport, would take around 95 days to build, but it was unclear then when that countdown would start. Some other media reports suggested that the site might be completed around the end of the current calendar year. Meanwhile, the DOE website update at that time said, “The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is handling the construction of the project and estimates it could take anywhere from 95 days to six months to complete.”\n\nMONDAY, DECEMBER 11, 2023\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nDec. 10 deadline for Maui wildfire survivors to apply for FEMA disaster assistance\n\nHawaii News Now, Annalisa Burgos, Lili Hurd\n\nDec. 10 is the deadline for Maui wildfire survivors to apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster assistance. FEMA spokesperson Debra Young joined HNN’s Sunrise Weekends to talk about resources and what is needed to apply. FEMA’s Individual Assistance program is designed to help with basic, critical, disaster-related needs such as a safe, sanitary and accessible place to live. Assistance includes rental assistance, lodging expenses reimbursement, and home repair and replacement assistance. FEMA advises those who are covered by homeowners’ insurance to file a claim with your insurance company before applying for FEMA assistance. You don’t need to wait for a settlement before applying with FEMA. Anyone initially denied FEMA assistance is advised to contact FEMA to resolve any issues and can file a repeal within 60 days. Applicants can visit two locations on Maui at UH Maui College and Lahaina Civic Center. Maui College will be open until Dec.15, while Lahaina Civic Center will be open through the end of the year. FEMA is partnering with the U.S. Small Business Administration to offer low-interest loans for homeowners and renters whose property was damaged or completely destroyed in the wildfires. Those eligible can borrow up to $500,000 from SBA to repair or replace their primary residence and up to $100,000 to repair or replace personal property. FEMA is also seeking property owners to rent units suitable for families and individuals displaced by the Maui wildfires. Companies and owners would exclusively rent to FEMA for use as temporary housing for 12 months with the possibility of two additional six-month contract extensions, totaling 24 months.\n\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2023\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nRegistration deadline approaches for FEMA meeting on housing for wildfire victims\n\nHawaii Public Radio\n\nFEMA has invited owners of short-term rental properties on Maui to an informational and open forum meeting on Friday to discuss its Direct Lease program. The program aims to help the thousands of displaced wildfire victims who remain in hotels and temporary housing on Maui. Specialists at the event plan to present information about the program and answer any questions owners might have about signing up. Three property management companies have been selected to help facilitate communication between property owners and the government agency. Under the Direct Lease program, FEMA says they will lease the property directly from the short-term rental owners at Fair Market Rent, which currently ranges from about $1,700 to $3,200 in Maui County for 2024. Available properties will be offered to survivors for long-term leasing for up to 24 months. The in-person informational event will be held at the Westin Maui Resort on Friday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. It will also be accessible to stream online. Those interested in the virtual or in-person options must register by Thursday evening.\n\nTHURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2023\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nHawaiian Electric seeks federal trial amid dozens of Maui wildfire lawsuits\n\nHawaii News Now\n\nAttorneys for Hawaiian Electric Company, who face dozens of lawsuits blaming the utility for the Maui fires, are trying to get the cases tried in federal court and not on Maui. Most of the lawsuits say MECO either caused the fires when high winds sparked downed power lines or didn’t do enough to prevent the risk or the damage once the fires began. Now, HECO is asking the federal courts to try the case in Honolulu with a federal judge. They argue that federal jurisdiction is possible because one of the many companies and agencies being sued is out of state. Attorneys suing the company will object to moving the case. Hawaiian Electric argues that the federal courts have more resources to deal with such a massive case. All the lawsuits are expected to be put into a single trial.\n\nDeadline approaching for SBA wildfire loan assistance\n\nHawaii News Now, Mark Carpenter\n\nThere are only a few days left for homeowners and businesses impacted by the Maui wildfires to apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration. Monday, Dec. 11, is the deadline to apply for the SBA loans if your home or business suffered physical damage in the disaster. Homeowners are eligible for loans of up to $500,000, $100,000 for renters, and businesses can apply for up to $2 million in assistance. All are at low interest rates and payments can be deferred up to a year, especially with so many facing a lengthy rebuild. “It might be up to three years, so that’s why we are working with them to accommodate if you are not ready to receive those funds,” said Barbara Nitis, who works with the SBA’s Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience. “You don’t have to worry about the repayment until that date of that first disbursement.” Over the last four months, the SBA has distributed $260 million to victims, which has already surpassed aid given following Typhoon Mawar in Guam. Those interested in applying must first register with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and they will then be directed to the SBA.\n\n$2.5M state program hopes to get more displaced Maui families into stable housing\n\nHawai’I Public Radio, Catherine Cruz\n\nIt’s been almost a week since the state rolled out its plan to entice more property owners of short-term rentals to offer their units for families displaced by the Maui wildfires.

Given the fast-paced nature of disasters, a comprehensive disaster response requires teamwork. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency often collaborate on various environmental and regulatory matters in the United States. These two agencies have distinct roles and responsibilities, but their work often intersects, particularly when it comes to debris removal and environmental cleanup efforts in the event of natural disasters, emergencies, or hazardous material spills. USACE and the EPA have team members deployed to Maui on debris removal mission assignments from FEMA after the Hawaii wildfires that impacted property owners in Lahaina, Kula, and Olinda, on Aug. 8. To be successful, the debris removal mission will require synchronized coordination between USACE and EPA throughout the entirety of the cleanup process. “Since day one, we have been in constant consultation with USACE,” said Michael Brogan, assistant public information officer for the EPA. “Whether it’s our liaison officers, public information officers, incident command, general staff or commander, we always make sure to keep the line of communication open, it’s really a team effort for both our agencies.” Col. Jess Curry, Hawai‘i Wildfire Field Officer commander, said the strong partnership and cooperation between the USACE and EPA teams has been instrumental in getting the hazardous material and debris cleanup started. The debris removal process involves two phases. Phase 1 is currently underway and involves the removal and disposal of hazardous materials by the EPA from all properties impacted by the wildfires.\n\nWildfire, health emergencies elevated in state disaster plan\n\nKHON2\n\nThe state is changing how it gets ready for disasters, and wildfire has been elevated to a high risk.

We do have to worry about other high risks, hurricanes, also flooding, as well as a tsunami. Of course, we have lava and earthquakes.” Health emergencies also got bumped up to higher risk in this edition, in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2023\n\nMAUI WILDFIRES\n\nHawaiʻi House Finance Committee visits Maui to see projects, programs; learn community needs\n\nMaui Now (Hawaii)\n\nMembers of the Hawaiʻi House Finance Committee, led by Chair Kyle T.
