        "text": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - The highly anticipated state Attorney General’s Office report on the Lahaina wildfire is being delayed another month, officials say, because of challenges with getting information and access to Maui County employees and officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the massive effort to deal with nearly 100 lawsuits is moving ahead in Maui Circuit Court, all elements of the hunt for answers and justice in the Maui fires.\n\nInvestigators hired by the the attorney general are looking into a timeline of the fire and how government agencies responded, but the AG’s timeline, which was supposed to wrap up about now, has been delayed until April 17 by the demands of Maui County.\n\nThe attorney general is trying to determine whether more could have been done to save lives or property as hurricane-driven winds blasted the fire through Lahaina.\n\nMaui County wasn’t as quick to cooperate with the probe as hoped.\n\nSpecial Section: Maui Wildfires Disaster\n\nIN a statement, the Attorney General’s Office said:\n\n“The initial responses from the county were often slow and yielded less information than expected. Afterward, the County of Maui stated that it would require subpoenas for subsequent document productions and interviews with any County of Maui personnel.”\n\nFormer Circuit Court Judge Randall Lee said requesting subpoenas for information or interviews doesn’t mean the county is trying to hide something, but may just be trying to ensure it cannot be accused of improperly releasing information unrelated to the fire.\n\n“Might have some even personal information such as social security numbers, things like date of birth address,” Lee said. “You just don’t want the risks that you voluntarily turn something over that, oops, it’s a mistake. I shouldn’t have done that. But now with the subpoena, we’re kind of covered.”\n\nAt HNN’s request, the Attorney General released a list of subpoenas by department and whether they were for documents or interviews.\n\nThe list included 64 subpoenas — six to the Maui Emergency Management Agency and five demanding interviews with MEMA personnel.\n\nMost of the subpoenas went to the police department for interviews with officers, commanders and dispatchers. The fire department only needed three subpoenas for documents, because fire personnel were made available to investigators in the fall, before Maui began requesting the subpoenas.\n\nWest Maui state Sen. Angus McKelvey said he was not upset by the delay.\n\n“It does take time,” he said, “And you’d hate to, in that rush to get those answers now, all of a sudden, potentially, have things precluded legally because of the fact that they may not be admissible anymore.”\n\nLate Monday afternoon, the county issued a detailed explanation of the hold-up:\n\n“In support of the Department’s efforts and the efforts of its consultant FSRI, the County has delivered over thirty (30) different productions of documents (containing nearly 20,000 distinct files, including almost 8,000 video and audio files, 48,000 pages, and over 118 gigabytes of data) and has made its personnel, directors, deputies, and employees available for over 150 technical interviews and numerous site visits into and around the affected areas. The County has shown and continues to show great respect for the Department’s investigative authority in this matter.\n\n“Of course, the County also appreciates the Department’s mutual respect for the realities faced by a significant number of County personnel, who must continue maintaining the operations of County infrastructure and systems while they also grieve, re-orient their lives, and recover physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually from the fires. To this end, subpoenas were requested for personnel testimony following multiple instances of FSRI arriving to interview County personnel, including first responders, without notice, coordination, or legal representation.”\n\n“Document subpoenas were similarly requested to organize and track FSRI’s dozens of requests, many of which FSRI communicated directly to County personnel despite the County’s repeated requests to go through Corporation Counsel. The document subpoenas have greatly assisted in managing FSRI’s more than 150 informal and unorganized document requests and has allowed County personnel to better track the progress of production for each. It has also helped the County identify multiple instances of repeated requests or requests for information that had already been provided.”\n\nMeanwhile, Maui Circuit Judge Peter Cahill has inherited all the lawsuits over the wildfire and told lawyers if there are trials they would be in August 2025.\n\nHe also asked lawyers for advice on a settlement master to and the consensus pointed to either local mediation leader Keith Hunter or mainland mediator Louis Meisinger. Lee said it’s good that the judge is encouraging an early settlement process.\n\n“The costs of going to trial, the risk of going to trial, as well as the fact that regardless of who wins, there’s the potential for an appeal. So that could be dragged on for years,” Lee said.\n\n“So I think the judge is doing a good job in terms of managing the trial, managing these cases, given the magnitude of the cases, it’s not an easy job.”\n\nStill, ongoing is the Maui County Fire Department investigation into the cause of the fire, being aided by federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\nThat finding will determine the course of much of the litigation."
