        "text": "In Hawaiʻi, a woman’s right to control her body was protected before Roe vs. Wade and will be protected after Roe. vs. Wade.\n\nHawaiʻi was the first state to legalize abortion. This historic first did not occur in a vacuum but was part of a holistic effort to create a fair and supportive society for women. In the same effort and era, Hawaiʻi became the first state to create a government agency for women’s rights—the Hawaiʻi State Commission on the Status of Women—and, Hawaiʻi’s own Patsy Takemoto Mink, the first Asian-American women in Congress, opened the door to education for women by passing Title IX.\n\nThese policy landmarks are rooted in our cultures. Traditional birth practices, like those of kānaka ʻōiwi, perpetuated a sacred respect for women. ʻŌmilomilo (abortion) was practiced by ʻōiwi practitioners prior to colonization. Women had the choice to “exercise control over decisions on when to have a child, how many children to have and how far apart they should be.”\n\nThe safety, bodily autonomy, and happiness of women and birthing people should not be controversial. It is not incompatible with religious practice. Women’s rights and māhū rights are part of who we are here in Hawaiʻi.\n\nAccordingly, I pledge to carry on the legacy of women’s rights forged by our ancestors, by Patsy Mink, and countless women leaders.\n\nI pledge to protect and strengthen a woman’s right to her body.\n\nIn 1956, while living in Waipahu, Patsy Mink was elected to the Territory of Hawaii's House of Representatives.\n\nIn 1958, she was elected to the Territorial Senate.\n\nWhen Hawaii became a state in 1959, Patsy Mink unsuccessfully ran for Congress.\n\nThree years later, she won a seat back in the Hawaii State Senate in 1962.\n\nIn 1964, Patsy Mink was elected to the US House of Representatives, where she served in Congress for 12 years until 1977.\n\nMink ran for President of the United States in 1972, the first Asian American to run for a national office. In 1976, she ran for the US Senate, but was unsuccessful.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter appointed Patsy Mink to Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International, Environmental and Scientific Affairs from 1977-1978. Patsy Mink was President of Americans for Democratic Action from 1980-1982.\n\nReturning to Hawaii, Patsy Mink was elected to the Honolulu City Council where she served from 1982-1986. She lost races for Governor of Hawaii in 1986 and Mayor of Honolulu in 1988 before she was again elected in 1990 to the U.S. House of Representatives. She served her second phase in Congress for another 12 years, until her death at age 74 of pneumonia on September 28, 2002 in Honolulu, Hawaii."
