        "text": "Sacred Hearts School announced Principal Tonata Lolesio as a 2024 National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA) Lead, Learn and Proclaim Award Honoree Recipient. The award represents outstanding leaders in Catholic Education. The NCEA 2024 Convention will occur this month in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nLolesio is one of 11 recipients chosen nationwide for their work upholding Catholic education and faith formation to the highest standards.\n\n“I am honored, but I feel deep in my heart that this is a collective effort,” Lolesio said of receiving the award. “It took everyone’s time, talent, and treasure to continue fulfilling our school’s mission. It does not just belong to me but to everyone involved in this current situation, working together to rise from the devastation of our situation and our obligation to move forward for our students and their families. This is at the heart of our mission.”\n\nLolesio began her journey as Sacred Hearts School leader in 2020. Taking on the role of principal was a natural transition for her.\n\n“I am grateful to serve. I remember being overwhelmed as parishioners, family, friends, and fellow teachers welcomed me with excitement and enthusiasm in my new role as principal,” Lolesio said. “It is a Motherly feeling, and quite honestly, I have always felt that my path would eventually lead me here at some point in my life. I was ready to move into my new office and take on my new responsibilities. I knew this would be more than a job for me. It was my calling.”\n\nThe additional outpour of congratulations came from all over the Island, including fellow Lahainaluna Alumni classmates of 1994! Little did Lolesio know of the exciting, emotional, and what would become a tumultuous journey as a school leader. She would become known as the “pandemic principal,” as shortly after she accepted the role of Principal, COVID-19 rattled the world and the quiet and peaceful existence of Lahaina, Maui.\n\nIn 2023, she would become the principal of hope and a beam of light for students, staff, and school families as the devastating fires of August 8th would redefine our existence.\n\nLolesio’s legacy with Maria Lanakila Church began when she was five. Her parents wanted to provide a better education and more opportunities for Lolesio and her brother, Tuifua Sakalia. So, they migrated from Tonga in 1982 and have remained a vital part of the Parish. Sakalia earned a degree in business in Boston and is now a business professional in Australia, with a family of his own.\n\nLolesio has two younger sisters, Atisela, and Milika, who were born in Hawai`i. Son, Benjamin Lolesio, graduated from Sacred Hearts School in 2018 and Lahainaluna High School in 2022.\n\nLolesio’s son has decided to follow in his mother’s footsteps in education and now works for the school as a title one teacher and support staff. Lolesio’s husband, Howard Lolesio, has worked tirelessly as the school’s groundskeeper for many years, and now that the post-fire Sacred Hearts School is located at the Mission Church in Kapalua, he is still finding ways to improve or build something on the makeshift campus.\n\nLolesio earned her bachelor’s of arts in English literature, a minor in speech from UH Manoa, and also worked towards a master’s in elementary education.\n\n“Who knew that a Minor in Speech would help me in life someday? It is not easy to feel comfortable and safe speaking in front of so many people and interviewing for nationwide television stations,” Lolesio said of her education. “But with everything our school ‘ohana and community had experienced, the world had to know what we were doing. We had not given up on these kids and would do everything to keep these kids hopeful. This is something I have had to do a lot of this year. It makes me believe that God has a plan for us all.”\n\nBefore her role as Principal, Lolesio led the religious education program for Maria Lanakila Church, which has positively impacted the lives of hundreds of children. She helped prepare them for their sacraments in addition to her full-time job as a 2nd-grade teacher. She served as the 2nd-grade teacher at Sacred Hearts School for 19 years before becoming Principal. Lolesio said the classroom is like her home. She sometimes misses teaching second grade, but still loves that she still gets to teach middle school religion.\n\nSacred Hearts has been known for its perseverance in trials and tribulations. This was not the first Fire that the school had experienced. In the 1970s, an arsonist, who was never captured, burned the school to the ground. The only thing that survived was the statue of Jesus located in the school’s courtyard. In 2022, at their 160th Anniversary, alumni and State Senator Angus McKelvey represented the Hawai`i state legislature and recognized and awarded our school’s ability to persevere through intense obstacles and continue to provide faith-based education to the children of West Maui.\n\nSacred Hearts proved that it can face obstacles and indeed persevere. In the wake of the August 8th fires, Lolesio refused to throw in the towel. Half of the campus had burned to the ground as well as the Mother Marianne Cope Hall. She reached out to her staff of dedicated teachers and staff, and asked, “who is in? It is completely understandable if you cannot continue with us as a teacher, but if you are on board, let’s do this for the kids.”\n\nShe moved the school to the Mission Church in Kapalua and has been there since then. Howard and his collection of helpful friends got creative and built temporary tents. The outpour of emergency donations from around the country and the world has been heartwarming.\n\nLolesio has always talked about having a large family. Many friends and family believe this new leadership journey through the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst wildfires in the history of Hawaii, has further fueled her passion for Sacred Hearts School, and is the extended family she always dreamed of.\n\nFor more information visit: Sacred Hearts School https://www.shsmaui.org/ and National Catholic Educational Association https://www.ncea.org/.\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\nToday's breaking news and more in your inbox"
