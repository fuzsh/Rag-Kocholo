        "text": "Editor’s Note: In September 2012, Civil Beat sent six questions to each of the candidates running in the Nov. 6 general election for Hawaii Legislature. The questions and answers are reproduced below in full. Click on each topic listed below to read Civil Beat’s question and the candidate’s response.\n\nGeneral Excise Tax\n\nEnvironmental Regulatory Review\n\nGambling\n\nSunshine Law\n\nBest and Worst Legislation\n\nOverlooked Issue\n\nPreferred Candidate Name: Angus McKelvey\n\nParty Affiliation: Democrat\n\nSenate/House District Number: House District 10\n\nDate of Birth: 03/09/68\n\nPlace of Birth/Hometown: Honolulu//Lahaina\n\nCurrent Profession/Employer: State Legislator\n\nEducation/Alma Mater(s): Hawaii Prep Academy (HSD), Whitier College, (BA)\n\n1. With the exception for Honolulu rail, the state has not raised the general excise tax in decades. Would you consider increasing the GET to help the state meet its budget demands?\n\nI am generally disinclined to support a raising of the GET unless it was for catastrophic emergency reasons like our unfounded liabilities issues and even then it would be for a temporary period and only to a ceiling of 5 percent total maximum. The general excise tax is regressive, and as such the biggest impact is on lower income families and those on a fixed-income, like senior citizens. While exportable, the GET is also notorious for pyramiding which adds to the cost of doing business and can substantially raise the costs of goods and services for consumers as well as hinder job recovery and investment. Rather than increase the GET first, I would support continuing some of the GET exemption suspensions that will sunset to help create revenue. But I think others which haven’t worked, like the General to sub contractor exemption suspension, need to repealed as they have not brought in the revenue estimated and have caused considerable economic harm. I think through the tax efficiency and screening projects (which is estimated to bring in approximately $1.4 billion in under and non payment of state taxes) as well as considering other ideas (see below) we can continue to generate revenue and grow the economy so we hopefully need not consider it next session. ↩ back to top\n\n2. Lawmakers proposed relaxing environmental regulatory review to spur development and job growth in the 2012 session, and the issue is expected to resurface next year. Where do you stand?\n\nAs one who championed the plastic bag bill through several legislative sessions and managed to secure 2.1 million for critical watershed restoration and habitat work, as well as launched the initiative to try to secure the preservation of Honolua Bay from the state level, I have been proud to use my position as a lawmaker to champion these and other important measures for the environmental community these past years. I vehemently disagree with the view of those who say we need to sacrifice our environment to create jobs. Contrary to that frame of mind, I believe that in Hawaii, the environment is economy. That being said, I think it’s time for us to move past the shrill rhetoric of the outside special-interest groups and to prudently look at select areas where the state process may truly be duplicative and bring no added protection for our environment whatsoever. One such case was the bill we recently passed into law this last session which allowed Environmental Assessments to be waived if environmental impact statement would be triggered anyway because one of the triggers under Chapter 343 have been met. There are also areas where, because of strengthened federal environmental laws, the same EIS process required by the state is required by the Feds. (Additionally most of the Neighbor Islands, including my district, are within the National Marine Whale Sanctuary, which gives it an extra level of protection in addition to existing federal law). Accordingly, I would support allowing exemptions from state EIS process only for emergency work on existing state infrastructure projects that has been identified as not having significant environmental effects and there is an identical federal process is already in place (so things like cultural impact statements and county compliance would still be required). I would support setting it for a period of five ears so the legislature can review the law and see if it met its targeted policy goals without any unintended consequences. Personally, I think this approach is much more preferable than a state of emergency where everything is suspended and there is no review and input at all to ensure that these critical repairs and improvements to existing state infrastructure are done right so our airports, highways, harbors and schools can remain open and functioning without truly impacting out environment. ↩ back to top\n\n3. Gambling — are you for it or against it? If not, why not? If so, what type of gambling and with what kind of restrictions?\n\nGiven the way the current gambling statutes are written and haphazardly enforced there are already numerous examples of what constitutes gambling under Hawaii Revised Statutes going on right now including things like a popular golf course advertising an incentive on local radio whereby for an additional $10 if you get closest to the hole you win money or prizes, not to mention the various military bingo nights that were occurring at the bases for over 30 years until a recent shutdown by authorities after a media story brought this tradition to light. So to say Hawaii has no gambling is ignore the obvious truth and denies the ability to tax these activities for revenue for things like important social service programs. Furthermore, a recent court ruling has stated that certain forms of competition like poker are not games of chance but of skill, and cannot be classified as such under gambling laws as it is defined now. Given the effect of this ruling on state law, I think we should look at the “World Series of Poker” idea and restrict and manage this activity by allowing wagering as part of games of skill only as part of a tournament at the Convention Center. This would provide revenue for the center and the state as well as the visitor industry in nearby Waikiki, not to mention the free marketing generated through the national and international broadcasting of these events. Because it would have to be affiliated with a major, established and regulated poker leagues and is restricted to only one physical venue, I believe we can see the revenue benefits without the traditional social ills. It is for these very same reasons of realizing revenue without the social ills that I would also support looking at other ideas like an Internet only state-run lottery, which would allow the state to control who plays and ensure that eligibility requirements like barring state benefits recipients from claiming prizes will be enforced and also prevent “Lottery blight” from impacting our neighborhoods. I would also favor looking at the state floating general obligation bonds to invest in a hotel property in Las Vegas to help us capture the local revenue stream as well as possibly allowing gaming only at the international section of the Honolulu Airport as a way of obtaining revenue from participants who will by nature of their flights only be allowed to game for a short time and then have to leave the state of Hawaii. Because I believe all of these proposals offer the revenue benefits of gaming without the social ills that come with traditional venues like casinos in Waikiki or physical lotteries, I would only support looking at them and not these other forms next session. If we are to meet our unfunded liability obligations and restore cuts to essential educational and social programs and create money for much-needed economic development, while avoiding an increase in the general excise tax then we need to look at these certain types gaming that won’t erode our quality of life. ↩ back to top\n\n4. The Sunshine Law is a hallmark of an open democracy accountable to its citizens. Yet, the Legislature exempts itself from this requirement. Do you support more transparency in government operations, or are there legitimate reasons to conduct some of the people’s business behind closed doors?\n\nI have been a supporter of open government and transparency in the State Hose to the furthest extent possible without crippling the legislative process, which is critical for ensuring that services and projects e depend on can function in an orderly manner. Since my first election in 2006 we have done numerous things to expand transparency and participation like mandating an increase in the posted notice times for committee hearings scheduled on a Monday, so that Neighbor Islanders, like my constituents, can have notice and participate in the process as well. We have also instituted changes to require the posting of all testimony online within 24 hours so the public can see the views and input of not only their fellow citizens, but of other government agencies and groups as well. Additionally, we have implemented rules requiring the posting of public notice for hearings, holding of committee hearings open to the public, and have open voting in committees and on the floor. The House also makes all bills, committee reports, and other legislative documents be made available online as soon as possible and personally, as chair, I have welcomed any and all to testify on bills before the committee and as such many of their observations have been included in the measures that were advanced. However it is important to note that the sunshine law was created for small bodies that meet permanently year-round, like the county councils. The reason for this was because you have a small body of 9 people, as opposed to a chamber of 25 to 51 people, meeting all year long instead of within a sixty day time frame that conversations between three or members have deeper impact and can be better vetted in the public eye. Because the Legislature is composed of 76 people spread out over every subject area throughout the state of Hawaii with only 60 days to draft and gather input from the public on thousands of bills across all of these diverse areas and execute a billion dollar budget, if strict application of the Sunshine Law were required then it could literally shut down state government. If the people were to amend the Constitution to make the legislature full time, then I would support looking at application of the Sunshine Law to the Legislature, but until then, we have reformed the system to be more inclusive through technology and implementation of hard and fast House rules to maximize public input. Even so I will continue to look at ways to make the process more transparent and open and to expand the use lf technology to further engage the citizenry while ensuring that the people’s business can still advance within the current sixty day shot clock system currently in place. ↩ back to top\n\n5. What is the best legislation — and worst legislation — that the Legislature has approved in recent years? Please explain.\n\nThe best pieces of legislation would have to be the budgets we passed during the past several years at the height of the recession. By taking away special interest tax breaks, making hard cuts and only raising taxes on the top one percent we were able to restore our bond rating, eliminate furloughs and still find funding for important infrastructure projects for our roads, schools and harbors. As for the worst, I would have to say the General to sub GET exemption suspension since it did not bring in the revenue that was expected because it is largely unenforceable (which is why the state exempted it in the first place) and has kept many projects, especially smaller, residential ones moving forward. ↩ back to top\n\n6. What is an issue that you would champion at the Legislature — one that perhaps has not received much attention, or an issue that is important to your district?"
