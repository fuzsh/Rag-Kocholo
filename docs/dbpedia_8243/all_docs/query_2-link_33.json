He died on 27 Feb 1940 in South Portland, Maine. Parents: Joseph H. MCKELVEY and Helen CRUICKSHANK.\n\nHe was married to Gertrude Hardy on 10 Feb 1889 in Island Pond, Vermont. Congratulations to Geo. B. McKelvey. Last Friday evening he was united in wedlock to Miss Gertrude M. Hardy, a very popular young lady here. The ceremony occurred at the home of the bride's parents, Henry Hardy, a brother of the bride acting as groomsman and Miss Ada Belle Cabana as bridesmaid, and was performed by Rev. E. P. Lee. Mr. and Mrs. McKelvey have gone to housekeeping, being cosily settled in the house recently vacated by J. D. Bates and wife. Bridal Bower ought to be its name. Children were: Ralph MCKELVEY.\n\nHelen \"Nellie\" McKelvey was born about 1876 in Concord, Vermont. Nellie lived in St. Johnsbury and performed with the Vermont Symphony. According to her cousin \"Pink\" Pottle, she was \"a very handsome talented girl - a tragic death.\" Parents: James McKelvey and Helen Gee.\n\nShe was married to Charles K. Green on 18 Apr 1905.\n\nShe was married to Alden M. Briggs on 2 Jul 1890 in Lunenburg, Vermont. She was divorced from Alden M. Briggs on 17 Mar 1897.\n\nHelen Augusta MCKELVEY was born on 22 Apr 1868. She died on 19 Jul 1952. Parents: Joseph H. MCKELVEY and Helen CRUICKSHANK.\n\nShe was married to Irving Edward Quimby on 9 Apr 1890. Children were: Neil Moody Quimby, Geraldine Helen Quimby, George \"Pudge\" Quimby.\n\nHelen Kathleen McKelvey was born on 11 Dec 1901 in Davis, West Virginia. She died on 24 Jan 1996 in Marshfield, Vermont. Helen grew up in Davis, West Virginia, Georgetown, South Carolina, and Northfield, Vermont. She was one of the first women to enroll in the College of Agriculture at the University of Vermont, and was the only woman in her class. Following graduation, she worked for a time for George Aiken at his nursery in Putney. She married her college classmate, Royce S. (Tim) Pitkin in Northfield in 1924, and that fall she became a teacher of English and mathematics at Lamoille Central Academy at Hyde Park, Vermont, where Tim was the principal. She also coached the girls basketball team there. Their daughter Jane was born during their second year at the school (1926), and for the following twenty years, much of Helen's time and energy was devoted to being a mother and housewife, particularly after the birth of twin sons in 1929. In addition to her responsibilities as a wife and mother, Helen was an energetic participant and partner in many of her husbands professional activities. After Goddard was reorganized in Plainfield, Vt. in 1938, Helen served in many capacities on the staff and faculty of the college. She was variously the college librarian, health coordinator, student counselor, instructor, hostess, and emissary. She was also active in the Vermont Conference of Social Welfare, the Upper Winooski Valley Development Association (as chair of the Maple Sugar Festival), the Vermont Adult Education Association (as a board member), and the American Association of University Women. Helen's involvement in community affairs included the PTA, local theater productions, 4-H, church and school functions, Plainfield Home-Dem, and an unsuccessful campaign for the legislature in 1952. Tim and Helen were both supporters of the Universalist Church. As her children grew up, the family developed a potato raising enterprise on the Pitkin farm in Marshfield, which later expanded to include maple sugaring as well. Although much of the work was done by the children, Tim and Helen were both active participants in this effort. In 1969, when Tim stepped down after 31 years as president of Goddard, they built a house on the Pitkin farm and retired there. Helen became active in several senior citizens groups, including the Twin Valley Senior Center, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program. Helen indulged in a number of hobbies, including genealogy, gardening, and stamp collecting. After her husbands death in 1986, she continued to travel for a few years, to Hawaii, Alaska, and often to Florida to visit her brother and sister. Helen remained in her home into her 94th year with the help of her family and friends, and only in her last year did she require professional assistance. She died at home of colon cancer. The following narrative was extracted from an interview with Helen by Linda Goldberg, which was subsequently published in Linda's book \"Here on this Hill.\"\n\n\" I was fourteen when we came to Vermont, in 1915. during the \"back-to-the-land\" movement. The farm we were on was not what you'd call a good farm, and father was no farmer. All we did was cut the hay and raise potatoes and carrots. I changed my mind about what I was going to do in college because I thought our farm was located in an ideal place to have a s fruit farm. It would make a better income for all of us. I transferred from the College of Liberal Arts at the University Vermont to the College of Agricultural Science. I was the one girl in a class of twenty-two boys. In the summer, the crowd of us would arrange what we called a Victrola dance, where we'd take our own records and the Victrola. In winter, Mother would invite the snowshoe club up to our house. Now, our house was a little house, but there would be thirty, thirty- five people. We'd bring our own sandwiches, but Mother served baked beans and cocoa (we raised our own beans and we had our own milk). And she always had special table decorations. I remember one time she made a girl on snowshoes and a boy on skis on this absorbent-cotton hill in the center of the table. Mother was sort of an ageless person. She was very happy with older people, but she loved to have young people around. My mother was a happy individual. As I look back, she had no business to be happy many, many days. She had things to cope with that other women, I know, would not have coped with as my mother did. I always admired my mother because she enabled us to grow up so comfortably. I suppose without realizing it, I adopted her philosophy and adapted it to my own situation. Life was busier when the children were small. All my darning and hand sewing I did at night, so I was available for conversation if Tim wanted to talk. I was able to sit down in the evening and rest enough so that I didn't feel pressure that I know many young women say they feel. I am not patting myself on the back for this; it just was my good fortune not to feel encumbered. The other day a service-station man was pumping gas and said, \"How are you?\" And I said, \"Well, I don't tell all to everybody, but,\" I said, \"really, I have had a pretty good life.\" And he said, \"Well, I'm glad to hear that. That's not true of everybody that stops here.\" \"\n\nParents: Robert Cromarty MCKELVEY and Emily Cummings.\n\nShe was married to Royce Stanley PITKIN Ph.D. on 16 Aug 1924 in Northfield, Vermont.

MCKELVEY - In the days when Brighton was covered with forests and lumbering was its chief industry, Joseph H. McKelvey came to the United States from Leeds, Canada, where he had spent his early manhood and had married Helen Cruikshank, to build a home and rear a family.\n\nOf Irish descent, having been born in Belfast, Ireland, Feb. 12, 1831 and brought to Quebec at the age of two years, his home was a typical one of the race which has developed so much of thrift and cordiality among the American people. Eight children came to this home; two died in infancy, but three boys and three girls were brought to maturity, and with their mother, are all living to mourn the death of the head of the family, which occurred Wednesday, February 16 (1916). The children are Mrs. Fred Wing, WIlliam A. McKelvey, and George B. McKelvey of this town, Robert C. McKelvey of Georgetown, S.C., Mrs, C. Ladd of Lyndonville, and Mrs. I.E. Quimby of Groveton, N.H.\n\nSince coming to the United States, fifty-three years ago, Mr. McKelvey lived for two years at East Charleston, then went to East Brighton where he was sawyer in the Hobson mill. He afterward bought a farm there on which he lived till about twelve years ago when he took up his residence on Pleasant street of this village.\n\nAn interesting feature of his life here was the celebration of the golden anniversary of their wedding tendered to Mr. and Mrs. McKelvey by their children, all of which were present, on December 24, 1906\n\nMr. McKelvey was one of the organizers of the Methodist Episcopal church in this town; having been a member for thirty-eight years, and his funeral was held in the church edifice on Sunday afternoon, February 20th, Rev.

Thy glorious warfare's past, The battle's fought, the race is won, And thou art crowned at last.\"\n\nAmong those attending the funeral from out of town were Chas. D. Ladd, Roger Ladd and wife, Martin Ladd and wife of Lyndonville; Mrs. A. Pottle of Canaan; Geo. Quimby of Groveton, and E.F. Hobson and daughter of Newport.\"\n\nJoseph and Helen resided first in Leeds, on the farm adjoining his mother's. He came to the United States in 1862, and his family followed the following year. He was naturalized in 1888. Parents: Alexander McKelvey and Margaret Stevenson.\n\nHe was married to Helen CRUICKSHANK on 24 Dec 1856 in Leeds, Quebec. GOLDEN WEDDING AN ISLAND POND EVENT - Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H. McKelvey, whose golden wedding, celebrated Christmas eve, was the second event of the kind Island Pond, Vermont has ever known. - (Special dispatch to the Sunday Herald.) ISLAND POND, VERMONT, Dec. 29, 1906. Not often has the celebration of a golden wedding been possible in the village of Island Pond, and only once before, when the 50th anniversary of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Clark H. Ladd was honored, has there been an event of that nature equalling in popular interest the occasion at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H. McKelvey, on Christmas eve. when their many relatives and friends, numbering several hundred, assembled to greet this universally respected couple. Joseph McKelvey and Helen Cruikshank were marreid by the Rev. James McConachy at Leeds, Can., just 50 years ago, where their respective fathers had cleared farms from the primeval forest. Soon after the marriage, Mr. and Mrs. McKelvey came to Island Pond, where for about 15 years Mr. McKelvey was engaged in lumber operations, till he purchased the place now known as the McKelvey homestead at Hobson's Mills. Until recently this couple resided at the old homestead, moving last spring to their present home in the village. . . . .All of the surviving children and several of the grandchildren were present, together with William Cruikshank of Inverness, Can., brother of Mrs. McKelvey, and many other relatives. Col. Porter H. Dale reviewed the lives of Mr. and Mrs. McKelvey and extended to them the best wishes of their neighbors and friends. His remarks were substantially as follows: \"Mr. and Mrs. McKelvey: The solicitude of your children has given your friends the privelege of rejoicing with you in this rare event. That you are tonight where you have toiled together up the heights of half a century makes this occasion one of unusual interest. Many here never looked upon a scene like this; some can recall but one other, and not but a few times, possibly eight, has such an assembly been possible among the residents of this town. Perhaps you are at first surprised when you think how seldom such an event can take place, and yet as you review the years you will wonder more that it has come to you. Looking back through the long vista you behold countless occasions just like that one fifty years ago at Leeds, Que., when the Rev. James McConachy pronounced Joseph H. McKelvey and Helen Cruikshank man and wife. All throught the years, since then you have observed events like that, and yet as you look again how many of them you have seen covered by the fragments of hopes and the ashes of hearts! Thus you are brought to realize how true it is when we, thinking of your lives, say to you, tonight, \"The way is long, O friends! But life is sweet, so sweet, To wander hand in hand Where overhead the swaying branches meet, And birds sing joyous songs, by soft winds fanned, And velvet grasses kiss your wayworn feet, Till just beyond you, where the river bends, You find the summer-time that never ends.\" We must remind you of what, no doubt, you have frequently said of yourselves, that you are fortunate to have avoided, through this long period, the fatalities of illness and disaster. It appears to us that you have in a marked degree attained the objects for which you hoped at the start. You never desired a life of idleness, the Scotch-Irish ancestry behind you made you strong of mind and muscle, and you expected to labor for what you obtained, therefore you have not lived in complaint nor met failure. \". . . . Your fathers came over the sea and cut for themselves a farm out of the primeval forests of Canada. From such and ancestry you obtained the constitutions to meet the conditions as they existed, nearly forty five years ago, when you went into the uncut forests of this town for Nathan L. Woodbury. Some of us with gray hair can recall the old boarding house up the river, the birthplace of some of your children, and where we, as children, used to rest when on our forest expeditions years after you had moved away from it. \"Since thirty years ago you took the farm which was till recently your home, it is doubtful if you realize how many kindly thoughts and pleasant words of you were awakened as the people of this community passed on the railway by your abode. As you think, sir, of the men on the railroad with whom you have exchanged salutes through all these years, you see again many a hand, some vanished now, but all of which waved to you the heart's goodwill. As you think of all that has taken place with you from the time Hobson's mills were built till the grass grew up the meadows where the trees fell and the mills were gone, you recall some illness and bereavement, but, in general, you have so lived yourselves that you could look upon the great world about you as you beheld the railway trains, and from it, as from them, you have been saluted only with the cheerful hand and the friendly smile. \". . . . And now for those who represent your family, to whom you have taught the sacred meaning of the words \"Father,\" \"Mother,\" and the church to which you have given long and consistent service, and the community from which you have gained universal friendship and respect, we wish you, the aged bride and groom of this event, many returns fo the merriest Christmas and the happiest New Year of all that you have known through half a century.\" To Col. Dale's remarks, the Rev. C.D. Lance, make a very happy and appropriate response in behalf of the family. Dainty refreshments were then served after which all enjoyed a social hour, including a solo by Mr. Pottle. In the fifty years of the married life of Mr. and Mrs. McKelvey eight children were born to them, four sons and four daughters, all living, except the eldest son and youngest daughter. They took up their residence in this town in 1862 and all these years have been honored and respected as worthy citizens. They are well preserved, and active, and a large circle of friends hope they may celebrate many more anniversaries, and wish them continued years of happiness and prosperity. They were most bountifully remembered by thier children and grandchildren, who presented them with $105 in gold coin, and friends added $56, also in gold. Then there was a handsome coat presented to Mrs. McKelvey by the grandchildren and Mrs. R.A. McKelvey, and the neighbors on Pleasant Street presented her with a chair. There was also a morris chair from S.D. Hobson and family, a chair from the Methodist church friends, a pair of silver loving cups from D. Stern and wife, and several other gifts, including books, pictures, rugs, linen, etc. Children were: Caroline Glanville MCKELVEY, Margaret Stevenson MCKELVEY , Alexander MCKELVEY, Robert Cromarty MCKELVEY, William Alexander MCKELVEY , Helen Augusta MCKELVEY, George Banks MCKELVEY, Alma Eva MCKELVEY, Infant MCKELVEY.\n\nLouisa McKelvey was born in Sep 1848 in Lower Canada.

William was a lumberman and log scaler for most of his life, working in the woods and in lumber mills of Maine and New Hampshire. Although he seems to have been content with the work of lumbering, he was often depressed by the coarseness and loneliness of camp life. In October of 1910 he wrote to his sister Callie, \"It has been a long time since I rec'd your letter and ought to have answered before but there is not much chance to write so have neglected. And then I was not sure I would stay. For this beats all the crews of dirty low lived Nova Scotia French brutes ever I was in and I just will not stay for would rather live with a lot of pigs. I am going to stay perhaps till the end of the month and then am going to find somewhere that the lice won't carry me away. . . \" His correspondance with his mother and sisters indicate that at least as early as 1906 he had a drinking problem and had incurred substantial debts in Island Pond. These problems remained with him for many years, despite continued efforts to reform himself. In May, 1906 he had written to his mother, \"And another thing Mother, (though I should not mention it) it is a good thing I am here for you will not need to worry about me while I am here on the score of intemperance for even tho' I had any desire to drink I could not get it here. Of course I feel lonesome in this place as any one will that is away from his folks and still I am glad to be here and live soberly. It will take me a long time to get square again but with my health I shall and then try and remain so. . . \" Will never married, and seemed to always be very emotionally dependent on his mother and sister Callie for much of his adult life. His mother's letters to him were always loving and supportive. In January 1913 she wrote to him, \"Dear Will we should all try to do better this new year than we have in the years gone by. And if ask in faith the Lord help us. We all need to for we all do rong. And I trust and pray the Lord will help you and give you strength to over come in time of temptation for you are a good son in all other ways and you never mean to hurt any ones feelings. . .\" In his later years he became a member of the Christ Episcopal Church.

I know you would like to hear of my health Family and that we now have three Daughters and two sons in life beautiful healthy Children. I have plenty for them. Yet as I have a large farm consequently have to pay a large rent. I have between three and four hundred sheep about 40 head Black cattle 4 excelent horses and Colt. My hole stock and implements is considered to be worth about L600 -- Sterling but you may gess it is not all myne clearly. I borrowed the length of L360- from my father when I take this Farm I am eight years in this farm now and but one yeare more of my lease to run and no matter as it did not pay well. I pay L100-rent besides about L10-- a year of taxes. I keep two men and two Maid Servants which comes to be very expensive. I intend dropping this farm at the expiry of my lease. I always have a notion of coming to America.\n\nI forgot to give you the names of our young Highlanders but I will give it heare. The eldest is Margeret 2nd is Jean 3rd Angus 4th Malcolm 5th Janet. Father and Mother is still in life and in Stellaig. Malcolm is dead 4 years since. John is Married to your Cousin Jean a Valie. They are preparing for going to America. This spring if spaired they are for going to Canada Upper where sister Mary is. Hector and Janet is with Father not Married. I think we would do well in America if Father would go as he could command a grand sum of money where as we are doing nothing here but keeping up with life on hard labour and very little in are and times is very bad with Farmers in this country owing to the failure of the potate crops in particular. The first year of the desease I lost upwards of 200 boals of potatoes which did me a great deal of harm being a new beginner in trade. The wool is also very cheap which injures me also, price of sheeps and cattle is also very low this year owing to bad Tread in Townes. The Colera is very rife in Scotland towns. Just now thank god for his mercy to us it is not in Kerry yet nor any other troubles but we must confess that our great Sins call for great corection would to give that his Judgement on our land would be a means to bring us and many more to a sense of our Sins and ask grace to forsake our evil ways and bring us to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. I sometimes console myself in respect of my fore(ig)n friends hoping we shall all yet meet and be found among the shaf (staff) of his right hand for which there is no condomnation. I would like to believe that I would have the pleasure of seeing you and your Wife and Family yet in this life as I was and is fond of you. Your Cousin Malcolm is not yet Married. All the rest of the Family is. He is staying with his mother. Duncan and Robert and their Wives are de(a)d. We had a letter from Saly in Sidney last weack. They are well and doing well. He speaks of coming home. It is some time since I had a letter from Sister Mary (McBride) but Alex More Macleish' family is within 30 miles of her on the Banks of the River Thames. We had a letter from them lately and an account of Sister and Family. I was in Uncle John Buchanan's house in Greenock yesterday. They are all well. Uncle Malcolm's family are well but indeed there is a great number of poor people in Kerry. There is no potatoes to speak of in this Country ______ several Farms without one single shaw and the herring fishing being poor which is was the main support of this Country leaves it altogether in a poor state but the Meale are cheap the year which helps the poor to live easier. If this letter comes to your hand I hope you will not neglect me so long as you well know how to adrefs to me. Let me know the extent of your farm and stock also of your Father and Brothers and Sister give me your mind about my going to that country. Let me know the price of land there or whether the Canada would be a better one. If my parents will not go if I leave ____? and in health. I will not stop long in Kerry but I would consider it very undutiful to leave the old people while in life altho(ugh) they do not require my assistance. Still I am a comfort to them as I have ___? (hole in page). My Sister's adrefs if you would wish to write her you can manage it by this Niel McBride Care Alex McLeish, Williams, London District, Canada West . I can not give you the details of all your friends in Kerry one by one but they are all well that is in life of theirs and much about the old circumstances. When you wryte me make mention of any thing you wish to know and I will consider it a pleasure to serve you the best way I can.\n\nI will now conclude with our best respects to you and yours not forgetting Father Mother Sister and Brothers.\n\nI remain your Belove Cousin\n\nDonald McLeish\n\nwitnefs my hand\n\nParents: John McLeish and Jean Buchanan.\n\nHe was married to Ann Lamont on 10 Jan 1837.
