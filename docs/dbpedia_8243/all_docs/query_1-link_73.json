        "text": "Chair McKelvey, Vice Chair Choy, members of ERB Committee,\n\nThe Leaue of Women Voters of Hawaii strongly supports HB 1509. We applaud the addition to Chapter 92F-12, provisions âto include more information on bid schedules, and contract awards, including any addendums and amendments thereto:â, and beyond that to have that information posted or updated on a publicly available website within one business day of availabiltiy.\n\nThe posting of such information so as to make it available to the public will dispel some of the misunderstandings and suspicions that are the product of the lack of transparency. It will do much to increase trust in the process used in the procurement of goods and services by government.\n\nWe urge the passage of HB 1509.\n\nThan you for this opportunity to testify on this bill."
