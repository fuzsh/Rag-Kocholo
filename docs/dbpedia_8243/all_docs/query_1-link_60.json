It is important to note the ongoing investigation was not directed at DAWSON or any of our operating companies. Although we have not been informed about what they may be specifically seeking, we have been told there may have been financial or tax irregularities, so we have fully cooperated and provided all of the information they have requested.”…\n\nThe FBI Honolulu office said by phone Wednesday that it is “neither able to confirm nor deny such an investigation exists.”\n\nEdward Rivera, regional public affairs specialist for the Army Corps of Engineers, said via email on Wednesday that the agency “does not know the details of the investigation” and that it chose Dawson because, after the vetting process, the company “was eligible for contract award and award was made.” Several Native Hawaiian Organization 8(a) contractors were considered for the sole-source contract, and each were vetted for their technical capability, available capacity and past performance, among other requirements, Rivera said.\n\nWhen asked if the investigation would interfere with Dawson’s work on Maui, Rivera responded, “The Government determined that DAWSON Services LLC (DAWSON) is a responsible contractor eligible for a contract award. DAWSON must perform the required services per the contract. If they cannot perform the services, the Government has an appropriate mechanism with the contract terms to hold DAWSON accountable.”\n\nBut state Sen. Angus McKelvey, whose district covers West Maui and whose condo was damaged but survived the fire, said that he has “concerns across the board” with the selection of Dawson.\n\n“I have huge concerns because of the fact that they got raided,” he said Wednesday. “What’s going to happen in the future if they’re in the middle of an awarded contract job and all of a sudden they’re shut down by the feds and that’s that?”\n\nMcKelvey acknowledged that “they have the right to due process,” but that “my concern is that’s a huge red flag.”\n\nHe said he’s also worried that choosing a company that’s not based on Maui will drive up costs, pointing out that off-island businesses have to ship in equipment and personnel, pay for flights and find lodging. Many of them end up hiring Maui companies anyway to help with the work, turning contractors who get the original project award into “the middleman.”…\n\nread … Debris cleanup phase begins in Kula, Olinda after company lands $52.5M contract | News, Sports, Jobs - Maui News\n\nAgain With This? HART Claims Feds to Resume Rail Funding Soon\n\nCB: … Lori Kahikina, executive director of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, said (claimed) Friday the FTA wants to sign a new Full Funding Grant Agreement with the city in late December. That would immediately clear the way for $125 million in federal funding.\n\n(CLUE: HART bosses have lied about this FTA agreement being around the corner for 9 years now.)\n\nThat would be a major milestone for the Honolulu project because the FTA has withheld $744 million in federal funds since 2014 as the city struggled to resolve cost overruns and a long series of construction delays.….\n\n(REALITY: Most likely it just ain’t gonna happen.)\n\nread … Feds Want To Sign A New Deal By Dec. 31 To Resume Rail Funding\n\nMaui Fire Chief Details Lahaina Fire Timeline\n\nKITV: … Chief Brad Ventura presented a timeline of the August 8th Lahaina on half of the Maui Fire Department.
