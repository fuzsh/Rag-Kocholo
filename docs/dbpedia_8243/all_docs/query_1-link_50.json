        "text": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Hawaii’s state Legislature convened for its annual session Wednesday, sounding more unified than in recent history. Lawmakers say the Lahaina fire disaster has exposed problems in housing, land use and the economy that must be addressed.\n\nTheir commitment was reinforced by a rally organized by Lahaina Strong, a group of Maui residents and wildfire survivors who say they represent the voice of the community.\n\nLahaina Strong founder Paele Kiakona said it’s time for lawmakers to listen to the public.\n\n“Lahaina Stong is getting stronger,” he said. “So I hope that powers that be — you be worried right now you should be worried because we getting stronger and we not stopping.”\n\nSpecial Section: Maui Wildfires Disaster\n\nThe twin legislative sessions were low-key, without entertainment or family and guests in the chambers. In speeches and news conferences that followed, the commitment to act on the lessons of Lahaina was bipartisan — with legislation already in the works.\n\nSenate President Ron Kouchi pointed out that the poor land management, with fallow overgrown acreage that helped fuel the fire, needs to be addressed statewide.\n\n“We want to ensure that it doesn’t happen on any other island and service stewardship and land management — fire mitigation must be done in each of our islands,” Kouchi said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Lauren Matsumoto lauded the house wildfire working groups, which included Republican members and generated a package of bills on multiple issues.\n\n“My hope is that this bipartisan legislation will send a clear message to the residents of Maui that we are putting their needs over politics,” Matsumoto said.\n\nThe most emphasized challenge was the shortage of affordable and rental housing, which was an emergency before the fire and is now a crisis in Lahaina, where many survivors are still houseless.\n\nCourtney Lazo spoke at the Lahaina Strong rally in favor of measures to convert thousands of short-term vacation rentals into long-term housing.\n\n“For the Lahaina families that want stay in Lahaina and heal and grieve and be with our community they are unable to do so,” she said.\n\n“My family and I got pushed out of Lahaina because we don’t have anywhere to stay on that side.”\n\nLawmakers agree short-term regulations are urgent.\n\nHouse Speaker Scott Saiki said it’s a priority for the house.\n\n“I happen to personally believe that this is one of the top issues that we have to address order in order to provide more affordable housing to our residents,” Saiki said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Brenton Awa represents Windward and North Shore, Oahu, and said the governor’s emergency proclamations for wildfire relief and housing give the issue momentum.\n\n“When he said that he was trying to look at rentals to not go for tourists but rentals to locals yeah that makes sense we support that, especially in our district,” Awa said.\n\nThe Lahaina-driven agenda also involves sustainable tourism, restoration of natural streams and local food crops and restoring trust and ending corruption.\n\nIt’s a tall order — that for one day at least, felt doable.\n\nState Sen. Angus McKelvey told the Lahaina Strong group that lawmakers are listening.\n\n“You know what,” McKelvey said. “We are going to figure ‘em out if Lahaina gets a chance to lead, and I am so happy our colleagues recognize that.”\n\nThe annual session includes 60 sessions in the House and Senate, but with recesses and holidays stretches this year to May 3."
