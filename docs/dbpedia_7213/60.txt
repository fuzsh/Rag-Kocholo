In a world increasingly characterised by climate change and ecological destabilisation, the scenario of water scarcity not only appears in dystopian novels and films, but also manifests itself in real social crises. These literary and cinematic works reflect deep societal fears and offer insights into the potential consequences of a world fighting for the last drops.

Dystopian representations

“Dune” by Frank Herbert – Although primarily known for its deep political and religious commentary, water plays a central role in the ecological and cultural landscape of Arrakis. Water is so valuable that it functions as a currency and determines social structures and survival strategies.

“The Water Knife” by Paolo Bacigalupi – A novel set in the near future in the southwest of the USA, where water scarcity leads to extreme social tensions and economic destabilisation. Water wars are part of everyday life here, and control over water sources determines power and powerlessness.

“Mad Max: Fury Road” – Water, or the lack of it, is a central element of this visual epic. Immortan Joe controls the water supply and thus the livelihood of the people, which cements his tyrannical power.

“Tank Girl” – This cult film shows a post-apocalyptic desert planet where water is monopolised by a corrupt organisation and the protagonists rebel against this injustice.

Real-world parallels

The fictional depictions of water shortages and their social consequences are not just fantasies. Examples from the real world show how water becomes a source of conflict:

Cape Town, South Africa – In 2018, the city was on the brink of “Day Zero”, the day when water supplies would have been exhausted. Drastic measures to conserve water and subsequent rainfall prevented this catastrophe.

California, USA – Regular periods of drought lead to strict water usage restrictions and have a massive impact on agriculture. The dispute over water rights is politically and economically highly explosive here

Key technologies and strategies

Desalination plants – Technologies for converting seawater into drinking water are becoming increasingly efficient, but face environmental concerns about energy consumption and the impact on marine life.

Water-saving technologies – From agriculture to everyday consumption, new technologies are helping to minimise water use.

Rainwater harvesting – Old techniques are being revitalised to reduce pressure on traditional water sources.

Fiction often serves as a mirror to reality, and the theme of water in dystopian works is an alarming signal warning us of the potential consequences of global ignorance. By taking these narratives seriously, perhaps we can take action to help prevent such a future. Like the characters in the stories, we too have the choice to become heroes of our own story – through innovation, sustainable practices and respectful use of our most precious resource: water.
