        "text": "Our impact in Uganda\n\nWater.org began working in Uganda in 2009. We launched our WaterCredit solution in 2013. Since then, demand for water and sanitation loan products has grown significantly. We have partnered with multiple financial institutions and a microfinance association (with 22 microfinance institutions) to develop water and sanitation lending portfolios.\n\nWater.org also works with a variety of sector organizations in Uganda, including Water for People, IRC, and Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor. By partnering with other stakeholders, local and national government, and key players in the water and financial sectors, we’re working to remove barriers and build an enabling environment for affordable financing for water and sanitation.\n\nRose's story\n\nRose worked hard to build a good life for her family, though she lacked something critical to survival. She had no toilet or running water at home. It's hard to raise children without these things. Thus, with her little ones in tow, Rose's days consisted of selling charcoal at the market and walking long distances to and from her home to collect water. Now, four years later, Rose’s smile is brighter than ever. The water from the tap she constructed with her small loan is convenient and saves her hours each day. No more walks for water. Now she can dedicate her time to work and to caring for her kids."
