It includes interviews with Drs. Karl and William Menninger and Walter Cronkite, photographs, scenes at the Menninger Clinic and Kansas State Hospital, and simulated dramatizations to illustrate various aspects of the treatment program at the Foundation and Clinic. In part one, the old methods of isolating and punishing mentally ill patients in overcrowded, understaffed institutions are described. The efforts of physicians prominent in the early field of psychiatry are briefly reviewed. Drs. Karl and William Menninger then describe their more progressive approach. At present they have obtained a release rate of 70 percent of patients within 90 days, and an overall release rate of 85 percent. They discuss mental health, mental illness, juvenile delinquency, and criminal justice. In part two, Drs. Karl and William Menninger describe their treatment program for the mentally ill and a training program for psychiatrists and parapsychiatric staff members. A clinical conference is presented and milieu therapy is described.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n12.\n\nTitle: Alcohol as a preventative of experimental neuroses\n\nDate: 1945\n\nRun Time: 12 min.\n\nNames: Masserman, Jules Hymen; Jacques, Mary Grier; University of Chicago, Division of Psychiatry; Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: In a study designed to investigate whether alcoholic intoxication can protect normal animals from developing neuroses as a result of conflict-causing experiences, cats are trained to open a food box at a bell and light signal. Then they are trained to operate an electric switch to get their own signals and food rewards and to pass barriers and work the switch in any position. Normal animals readily enter the box and show no fear of the switch, signals, food, or barriers. However, feeding inhibitions are immediately induced if the animal receives a shock or an air-blast at the moment it takes the food. To ascertain whether mild alcoholic intoxication during the experimental conflict can protect a normal animal from developing a neurosis, cats were deprived of water for 48 to 96 hours, then given milk containing 5 percent ethyl spirit. Upon exposure to the previously fear-producing stimuli, their reactions to the milder shocks and blasts showed more curiosity than fear. With stronger shocks and blasts, mild phobic reactions lasting only several hours were noted. However, control animals retained their neurotic symptoms. When subjected to corresponding traumata when they were sober, the experimental \"drunk\" cats developed the same kinds of phobic reactions as the control animals. The film concludes that alcohol acts as a partial protection against experimentally-induced motivational conflicts. Shots include: cats in glass-sided experiment boxes responding to light and bell stimuli, opening food boxes, tripping an electric switch, finding the switch behind a barrier, exhibiting restlessness and fear as they are shocked and air-blasted, and exhibiting inhibited reactions to food and mice.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n13.\n\nTitle: Alcoholic addiction: differential diagnosis: passive-aggressive personality\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 6 min.\n\nNames: University of Mississippi Medical Center, Dept. of Psychiatry\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this \"telexample\" program is to present a passive-aggressive condition accompanied by alcoholism. The case illustrated is a middle-aged male who has a twelve-year history of drinking. During the interview, the patient expresses his concern about the effect of drinking on his life. The discussion includes his description of why he drinks -- as a method of escape and because of nervousness. The interview continues with the patient realizing that he has not only a drinking problem, but a mental illness as well.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n14.\n\nTitle: Alcoholic patient and his physician\n\nDate: 1964\n\nRun Time: 35 min.\n\nNames: University of Iowa, Motion Picture Unit; University of Iowa, Dept. of Psychiatry; State Psychopathic Hospital (Iowa City, Iowa)\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this program is to differentiate between addictive and nonaddictive alcoholism, emphasizing treatment for each type. Mock interviews with alcoholics are presented, illustrating distinguishing features of the two types, special problems resulting from alcoholism, and the physician's role in a total treatment program. Descriptions of six major steps in the treatment of alcoholism are detailed. The key idea conveyed is the importance of the relationship between patient and physician; if not a strong one, it is unlikely that patients will heed the treatment recommendations. At the conclusion of the program a summary of each step of treatment is given. Statistics are included.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n15.\n\nTitle: American alcoholic, part 1\n\nDate: 1968\n\nRun Time: 31 min.\n\nNames: National Broadcasting Company, Inc.\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this program is to depict the plight of the American alcoholic. He lives in the richest and most technically skilled country in the world and yet he is ignored, ridiculed, and neglected. The film includes interviews with alcoholic patients and footage of alcoholics lying in streets and doorways and being arrested and sent to jail. Patients describe their lifestyles prior to and since becoming alcoholics. The program notes that authorities repeatedly jail the alcoholic for lack of detoxification centers, despite a recent Supreme Court ruling that chronic alcoholism is a valid defense against the charge of drunkenness. It also stresses that there are very few areas in the United States in which a derelict alcoholic is treated as any other sick person and hospitalized for treatment. According to this presentation, there are an estimated six million alcoholics in the United States. All of them drink excessively to make some life situation more tolerable. Many die in the streets or in jail and some are institutionalized for life in mental hospitals. At present there is no known cure for the disease.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n16.\n\nTitle: American alcoholic, part 2\n\nDate: 1968\n\nRun Time: 24 min.\n\nNames: National Broadcasting Company, Inc.; Len Giovannitti\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this program is to present different forms of treatment for the rehabilitation of alcoholics. Three alcoholics undergoing therapy sessions at different treatment centers are profiled. The first case presented is a man undergoing treatment at an alcoholic rehabilitation center in Avon Park, Florida. In this case, a family session with a counselor is shown, and members discuss their feelings and problems with alcoholism. Another form of rehabilitation illustrated in this program is a group therapy session with female alcoholics at Central Islip State Hospital. Through these sessions, the patients gain reassurance by relating similar experiences and feelings about alcoholism. The last type of treatment shown is a one-to-one patient/doctor consultation. In this example, the doctor helps a 24-year-old woman verbalize the feelings of isolation, emotional pain, and fear she has experienced during her six years of alcoholism. The presentation concludes by stating that although there are no cures for alcoholism, the methods illustrated in this film are helpful in controlling the disease. The program emphasizes that rehabilitation is not only the responsibility of the patient himself, but of everyone.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n17.\n\nTitle: Angry boy\n\nDate: 1951\n\nRun Time: 31 min.\n\nNames: Appel, Kenneth E.; Rennie, Thomas A. C.; National Association for Mental Health\n\nAbstract: A nine-year-old was caught stealing in school. Instead of treating the child as a criminal, the court referred his parents to a child guidance clinic for treatment of the child. This film is a presentation of modern child psychiatry in action. It is also the story of a troubled child who is helped by changed parental attitudes brought about by professional help.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n18.\n\nTitle: Anxiety neurosis with phobic features\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 14 min.\n\nNames: University of Mississippi Medical Center, Dept. of Psychiatry\n\nAbstract: This \"telexample\" or televised segment, consists of excerpts from three psychiatric interviews with a patient displaying an anxiety neurosis with phobic features. The case shown in this segment is a young man who shows multiple phobic symptoms, marked tension, and anxiety. The main phobic feature found in this patient is a fear of hospital situations, which he expresses by fainting. The patient also describes other phobias including a fear of meeting new people and a fear of his boss. The anxiety features illustrated by this patient are shown by his inappropriate expression of anger, e.g. laughter, and his dependency needs for acceptance from other people.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n19.\n\nTitle: Anxiety neurosis, chronic\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 7 min.\n\nNames: University of Mississippi Medical Center, Dept. of Psychiatry\n\nAbstract: This presentation consists of televised excerpts or \"telexamples\" from a ten-minute psychiatric interview session. The patient shown in this presentation is a middle-aged man who is plagued by feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy, which he expresses as \"worrying over simple things.\" The patient also worries excessively about his health in general, with special concern expressed about his epididymitis. Throughout the interview he discusses his multiple somatic complaints including \"stomach troubles\" and vomiting. Additional anxiety symptoms shown by this patient include his inability to hold a job, suspiciousness regarding his wife's faithfulness, and a fear of large crowds.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n20.\n\nTitle: Appraisal of competency\n\nDate: 1956\n\nRun Time: 20 min.\n\nNames: Davidson, Henry A.; Nebraska Psychiatric Institute, Community Services Division\n\nAbstract: This film details the criteria physicians should use to make legal decisions regarding a patient's competency.

James; Institute of Psychiatry, the Maudsley Hospital (London, UK); New York University Film Library\n\nAbstract: This silent film was shot in Maudsley Hospital, London, and shows children handling various types of objects, placing them in their mouths, and looking around for the objects when they are removed. Apparently in contrast to non-psychotic children, these subjects search for a missing object only in the place where it was located immediately prior to removal -- the child's left hand, for example.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n22.\n\nTitle: Aspects of childhood psychosis\n\nDate: 1957\n\nRun Time: 33 min.\n\nNames: Anthony, E. James; Institute of Psychiatry, the Maudsley Hospital (London, UK); New York University Film Library\n\nAbstract: This film presents four cases of childhood psychosis: footage of a boy shying away from others, a boy slapping himself while another boy bangs his head against the wall, and a young girl in an uncontrollable temper tantrum. Many young children are shown who are destined to have childhood psychoses resulting from genetic inheritance, cerebral syphilis, or endocrine troubles. In one instance, a child will not let go of his father; this is a case of Mahlerâs symbiotic psychosis. One boy displays a repetitive chopping motion with hands while another boy rocks back and forth, both considered autoerotic behavior. Another boy slaps himself constantly after being released from a straitjacket; this is diagnosed as auto-aggressive behavior. Finally, a child no longer runs away from people but towards them, symbolizing a gradual progression from psychosis to health.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n23.\n\nTitle: Assignment home\n\nDate: 1945\n\nRun Time: 26 min.\n\nNames: U.S. Navy\n\nAbstract: This film follows three sailors who have been discharged from the Navy after being hospitalized for \"nerves\" as they face the uncertainties of civilian life. The first, a farmer, returns home to face the frustrations of rebuilding his farm after several years of neglect. The second sailor deals with an overprotective mother and the search for a job. The third enters college but feels like a misfit because he is older than the other students. Before they left the hospital they were told four basic rules to help them adjust to civilian life. The rules were: stand on your own feet, get to work right away, mix with other people, and learn to solve your own problems. Each man finds encouragement in the people he meets. The men are shown as they gradually adjust to civilian life.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n24.\n\nTitle: Athetoid gestures in a deteriorating parergasic\n\nDate: 1938\n\nRun Time: 5 min.\n\nNames: Leighton, Alexander H.; Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic (Baltimore, Md.); Spring Grove State Hospital (Catonsville, Md.); Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: This film demonstrates the ritualistic, stereotypic hand gestures of a 22-year-old schizophrenic patient. The gestures have a pattern suggesting symbolic meaning, and the same patterns are repeated in various combinations. While superficially the gestures suggest athetosis, the patterns make it evident that the condition really is quite different.

Henry; Helfer, Ray E.; Wille, Lois\n\nAbstract: This title aims to provide an overview of battered-child syndrome using photographs of abused children, actual and simulated interviews with nurses, physicians, children and parents, and scenes from meetings of the Battered Child Team at the University of Colorado Medical Center. This program stresses the importance of recognizing that there are two victims - the child and the parent. Emphasis is placed on the importance of prompt reporting of any suspected case of child abuse. Several children are presented, and their injuries and home conditions described. The future placement of these children is also explored, as are the legal implications of child abuse. Colorado's role in developing legislation in child abuse and in trying to amend the current laws is discussed. The program stresses the importance of developing legislation that will not only protect the child but also protect the rights of the parents while preventing them from harming their children.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n27.\n\nTitle: Behavior disturbances after bilateral removal of the frontal areas of the cortex in cats\n\nDate: 1938\n\nRun Time: 13 min.\n\nNames: Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: This film shows behavioral experiences in cats after either removal of the entire frontal cortex or removal of only the cortex anterior to motor regions. Experimental results include: abolishment of placing and hopping reactions, defects in posture and locomotion, mastication defects, compulsive pursuit behavior, general hyperactivity, and impairment in ability to acquire complex skill.

Initially, a very brief description of behavior therapy is presented by two psychologists. Scenes from an actual session are then presented. Prior to the filming, the child and the therapist had had no contact with each other. During the first fifteen minutes of the session, the child's behavior is guided and controlled by means of social reinforcement. During this time the child is whiny, unruly, and uncooperative. The therapist then uses the systematic application of reinforcement in the form of small chocolate candies to encourage obedience and responsive behavior. Changes in the child's behavior are observed. He doesn't appear whiny, and responds more appropriately and cooperatively to the therapist. The two psychologists then briefly summarize the use of behavior therapy with this child. The benefits of this type of therapy on a long-range basis are noted.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n29.\n\nTitle: Blocks to therapeutic communication\n\nDate: 1970\n\nRun Time: 23 min.\n\nNames: Concept Media (Costa Mesa, Ca.)\n\nAbstract: This program identifies blocks to therapeutic communication. Dramatized interviews with four different patients and nurses are employed to help define and illustrate these ineffective communication techniques. Such techniques include using reassuring clich&#233;s, giving advice, giving approval, requesting an explanation, agreeing with the patient, expressing disapproval, belittling the patient's feelings, disagreeing with the patient, defending making stereotyped comments, and changing the subject.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n30.\n\nTitle: Bold new approach\n\nDate: 1965\n\nRun Time: 27 min.\n\nNames: Yolles, Stanley F.; Kaufman, M. Ralph; Mental Health Film Board (New York, N.Y.); National Institute of Mental Health\n\nAbstract: In an attempt to interpret for an architect the basic concept of a comprehensive community mental health center, a psychiatrist presents several case histories. We see how troubled men, women, and children can be helped by inpatient and outpatient treatment, day and night hospitals, emergency service, rehabilitation services, special services for children, referral to and consultation with other community agencies, preventive programs, and diagnostic and evaluation services. This film also emphasizes that the concept of the comprehensive center is a flexible one that can be molded to meet the needs of different kinds of communities. Seven different locations were photographed to show the various services in action--what they look like, whom they serve, how they function. The film makes the point that these services must mesh to provide comprehensive, continuous care.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n31.\n\nTitle: Booked for safekeeping\n\nDate: 1959\n\nRun Time: 32 min.\n\nNames: Matthews, Robert A.; Louisiana Association for Mental Health; National Institute of Mental Health; Stoney Associates\n\nAbstract: This film was made to show policemen proper procedures for handling mentally disturbed citizens who are causing harm to themselves or others in public. Demonstrations include work with the mentally challenged, spousal abusers, suicidal citizens, and those with senile dementia.

Psychological Cinema Register\n\nAbstract: The case of a seven-year-old child with a diagnosis of chronic organic brain syndrome is presented, with a focus on communication deficits related to the disorder. The child, Bobby, and the psychiatrist, Dr. Margaret Dealy Griffel, are interviewed. The program notes that Bobby is one of four boys to be filmed under similar circumstances to differentiate certain psychiatric syndromes seen in childhood. The physical manifestations of organic brain syndrome are observed to result from disruption of perceptual thought organization and spatial arranging, seen not only in body activity but also in the organization of the ego. Bobby's appearance, speech, intelligence, affect, motor behavior, capacity to relate, reality-testing and thought-life are discussed as he plays with toys and clay and attempts to assemble a toy figure of some sort. According to Dr. Griffel, Bobby demonstrates mild to moderate hypermobility, distractibility, hyperreactiveness, disinhibition, awkwardness of body movement, toe-walking, and difficulties with visual-motor coordination. At times he recognizes his difficulties and either denies or responds to them with regressiveness and resentment. Sibling rivalry and castration anxiety present in all children of this age are heightened by the brain damage.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n33.\n\nTitle: Breakdown\n\nDate: 1951\n\nRun Time: 40 min.\n\nNames: Lehmann, Heinz E.; Mental Health Division, National Film Board of Canada\n\nAbstract: Using the case history approach, this film depicts the onset of a schizophrenic breakdown in a 23-year-old woman, her treatment, and her eventual release from a well-equipped mental hospital.

The interview takes place in what appears to be the day room of a psychiatric treatment center. One female staff member and a young boy join in the interview during the last few minutes. The interview begins with a discussion of Carol's current activity, writing a letter to her parents in response to a letter she has received from her mother. In this letter her mother expresses a desire for Carol to win a swimming meet. Dr. Fischer encourages Carol to talk about her feelings regarding her inability to live up to her parents' expectations and their seeming lack of concern for her. Later on in the interview Carol further explores her feelings toward her parents. Dr. Fischer discusses two of Carol's dreams. In both dreams, Carol reveals fears regarding loved ones leaving her. Carol also is led to describe her feelings and experiences during previous hospitalizations. Near the end of the interview Carol sits on Dr. Fischer's lap and with encouragement writes a letter to her parents in which she expresses her real feelings towards them. She then crumples up the letter and throws it away. Dr. Fischer notes that feelings should not be thrown away.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n35.\n\nTitle: Case of aphasia: showing difficulty in word-finding, in comprehension, and in handling complex ideas\n\nDate: 1939\n\nRun Time: 18 min.\n\nNames: Leighton, Alexander H.; Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic (Baltimore, Md.); Spring Grove State Hospital (Catonsville, Md.); Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: This film shows a psychiatric examination of a 53-year-old male nurse, who, seven months before the film was made, suffered slight hemiplegia and aphasia. The paralysis largely cleared but aphasia persisted. The film demonstrates general narrowing of mental activity, specific difficulties in finding words, and moderate disturbances in comprehension. The case shows amnestic or nominal aphasia, the most apparent defect lying in evocation of nouns.

C.; Carroll, Edward J.\n\nAbstract: This film records a case of multiple personality. A woman (Mrs. X) regresses to a childhood state (Susie). She also has another, less well-developed secondary personality (Jack). Later, in response to the death of her parish priest, Mrs. X goes into a trance state for 24 hours and emerges as a baby with a mental age of about one year. The patient is seen at a family picnic, and later, as Susie, writing down answers to questions. There appears to be a struggle between Susie and Jack, and when Jack appears, he exhibits male posture and handshake. Mrs. X hides from the camera, while Susie enjoys the spotlight. Mrs. X is also seen emerging from a trance state as a baby, exhibiting the behavior of a one-year-old. She plays with a ball and a doll, claps her hands, and puts things into her mouth. The last shots of the film are of the family 15 years later, outside their home. There are an adult male (Mr. X?), Mrs. X. and four children.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n37.\n\nTitle: Catatonia cases after IV sodium amytal injection\n\nDate: 1936\n\nRun Time: 12 min.\n\nNames: Bleckwenn, William J.\n\nAbstract: This film demonstrates the first use of an intravenous barbiturate for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Three catatonic patients are shown before and after treatment of sodium amytal (\"truth serum\"). Before, one patient is a rigid catatonic, another is catatonic with muscular movements, and the last is catatonic with negativism. Three to four hours after injection, each patient is eating, walking, and smiling. In addition, the film shows the third case being injected and the immediate response in her muscles. The film includes a shot of a mother, father, and baby with a revived catatonic patient.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n38.\n\nTitle: Catatonic behavior in a deteriorated parergasic\n\nDate: 1938\n\nRun Time: 7 min.\n\nNames: Leighton, Alexander H.; Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic (Baltimore, Md.); Spring Grove State Hospital (Catonsville, Md.); Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: This film shows the posture, hypertrophied neck muscles, and ritualistic and stereotypic method of eating of a patient, age 45, who lay in bed for a year and a half with his head held unsupported above the pillows during all waking hours.

During the program, two scientists explore, in general terms, the use of drugs in basic psychology. The first is the chairman of the department of psychology at the University of Indiana, Dr. Roger Russell. He discusses the effect of drugs on behavior and describes measurement techniques. For example, rats and barriers are arranged in a field in such a way as to evaluate the rat's ability to solve problems in order to reach food. The influence of drugs on this behavior is described, as are experiments using a rat and a tank of water to test the animalâs escape behavior. Tests to evaluate how drugs affect behavior over a period of time in both monkeys and humans are detailed. Dr. Sebastian Grossman of the University of Iowa describes studies designed to determine where in the brain these behavior-influencing biochemical events occur. Dr. Grossman mentions experiments in which a cannula is placed directly into a specific area of the brain to evaluate the effects of drugs on hunger or thirst in rats. Studies on human clinical subjects to evaluate the biochemical effects of stress on the gastrointestinal system are briefly described. Double-blind studies are used to evaluate the effects of tranquilizers on behavior.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n40.\n\nTitle: Child analyses, Psychoanalytic Sanatorium, Stamford, Connecticut\n\nDate: 1930?\n\nRun Time: 25 min.\n\nNames: Clark, L.

This objective is achieved through a presentation of actual therapy sessions in a children's psychiatric hospital. The three types of childhood schizophrenia illustrated are early infantile autism, symbiotic psychotic, and borderline psychotic. A brief portrayal of the conditions for each type is given. This program proposes three phases of treatment, consisting of breaking through the autistic barrier, helping to develop new ego skills, and resolution of intropsychic and interpersonal conflicts. The methods of treatment illustrated in this film include individual, group, recreational, and occupational therapy. The presentation concludes with a summary of the phases of treatment. Emphasis is placed on the assumption of both biological and psychological factors in the basic etiology.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n42.\n\nTitle: Chronic epidemic encephalitis\n\nDate: 1945\n\nRun Time: 4 min.\n\nNames: Bellevue Hospital (New York, N.Y.); Shiras, Sarah P.\n\nAbstract: Patients suffering from chronic epidemic encephalitis are shown catching and throwing a soft object; walking and running; having a wrist bent; sitting and standing; smiling and laughing.

Early recognition and treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions in the combat zone, the need to understand the exhausted soldier, and treatment by narcosis therapy and chemical hypnosis are presented. In a neuropsychiatric hospital, the chief physician interviews a number of patients, one by one, and then explains their neuroses to the medical officers accompanying him. The three major sections of the facility are shown and explained: admission, treatment, and rehabilitation. Treatment may consist of sleep therapy, appetite stimulation by insulin, electro-shock therapy, exercise, and re-education. For combat zone exhaustion, recommended treatments include separation of exhausted from physically wounded soldiers, calming the hysterical patient, reassurance, food, rest, and tranquilizing agents. The prodromal signs of exhaustion are discussed - poor physical coordination, slowing of mental processes, excessive reaction to noise, inability to relax and rest, and outbursts of temper. Shots include: a \"shell-shocked\" soldier being seen in a combat-zone clearing station, an army physician lecturing to other physicians on combat exhaustion, and patients being treated at a large treatment facility.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n44.\n\nTitle: Combat fatigue irritability\n\nDate: 1945\n\nRun Time: 36 min.\n\nNames: U.S. Navy, Bureau of Aeronautics; Kelly, Gene\n\nAbstract: This film presents the case of a Navy seaman suffering from combat fatigue. He is first shown at his duty station in the engine room of a ship, manipulating water pipe valves. The scene then shifts to a hospital ward; the sailorâs ship has been torpedoed and sunk. The patient has not suffered any physical wounds, but he is jumpy, nervous, combative, and short-tempered. He goes home on a 30-day leave, thinking all will be well once he is away from the hospital and the military. But he blows up at his family, walks the streets, gets drunk, and fights with his girlfriend. The only people he feels comfortable with are other servicemen home on leave. He becomes so distraught when hunting in the woods with his father that he is taken to a doctor and then sent back to the Navy hospital. He is aware now that he is ill and cannot cope with civilian or military life. Talking about his deep feelings and fears in individual and group therapy sessions helps the sailor recognize and deal with his problems. This film acquaints the patient suffering from combat exhaustion with the nature of his illness and the therapy necessary for recovery.

Over fluoroscopic views of the heart, head, back, and stomach, the narrator begins to describe combat fatigue. Although tests show these structures are normal, the patients, who all had seen combat, complain of pain in the indicated areas. A medical officer is shown speaking to a group, explaining that these pains are caused by fear. Animated cartoons are used to explain the effect of fear on the body. Civilian situations which may produce fear, such as a classroom test, seeing a street accident, having to speak in public, and a domestic dispute, are shown. The lecturing officer recommends accepting one's symptoms, then finding the real cause of the symptoms, which will lead to a cure. He performs a shadow show to illustrate his points. Shots include: patients demonstrating their symptoms in a doctor's office; men in various areas aboard a ship.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n46.\n\nTitle: Combat psychiatry: the battalion medical officer\n\nDate: 1954\n\nRun Time: 36 min.\n\nNames: Cascade Pictures of California, Inc.; U.S. Navy\n\nAbstract: This film is an introduction to combat psychiatry for medical officers, line officers, and corpsmen. At sick call the night before a battle, men present with physical symptoms such as upset stomach and headache that signal their mental distress. The medical officer decides, based on his own examination and on information gathered from officers or men in the patient's unit, whether the patient should be sent back to his unit or evacuated. The importance of emotional support is shown. The second reel of this film shows the medical officers and corpsmen dealing with after-action combat fatigue and other casualties. In examining and interviewing the combat fatigue casualties, the medical officers identify those who simply need rest and reassurance versus those having a serious reaction that may require removal from active combat. The implications of this are addressed -- if sent to the rear, a soldier may lose his identification with his own fighting group and develop symptoms that will unconsciously justify his escape from combat. The types of breakdowns that signal that a man should never again be sent to a frontline unit are shown and discussed. The basic principle of combat psychiatry is to treat as far forward as reasonable and return to duty as quickly as possible. Shots include: activity in and around a very small U.S. Marine encampment in barren, rocky terrain; medical officers treating Marines at this same camp.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n47.\n\nTitle: Combat psychiatry: the division psychiatrist\n\nDate: 1954\n\nRun Time: 29 min.\n\nNames: Cascade Pictures of California Inc.; U.S. Navy\n\nAbstract: This film depicts the handling of neuropsychiatric (NP) casualties by a military psychiatrist. The importance of rest, food, drink, and, if necessary, sedation, is emphasized. This is handled as far forward as possible. After the first 24 hours, the man is evaluated. He may be kept another 24 hours, then sent back to combat, or he may need further care. The psychiatrist's assessment of the NP patient takes into account not only his present condition, but his past service record and the position he currently holds. The psychiatrist conducts individual interviews with patients in which the patients can express terror, resentment, and grief. He sees to it that the men engage in sports and games. The psychiatrist also must establish and maintain good relations with the rest of the medical service in his division. The film notes that generally, the chances of returning a man to effective duty diminish with each successive rearward evacuation. The importance of the corpsman in the recovery process is outlined. Shots include scenes of military camps and of casualties being cared for in the admissions tent of an aid station, as well as soldiers suffering from a variety of NP illnesses.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n48.\n\nTitle: Community health in action\n\nDate: 1954\n\nRun Time: 22 min.\n\nNames: Orleans, Sam\n\nAbstract: This film shows the benefit of coordination and collaboration among health departments, volunteer organizations, doctors, nurses, dentists, and other citizens to deliver health services, including mental health, in the community. The film notes that psychiatric therapy has less of a stigma than it once did, and families are more willing to seek help for children with behavior and other difficulties. A psychologist is shown observing a little girl at play and painting and drawing, to help him better understand issues her mother says she is having at home.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n49.\n\nTitle: Conversion reaction\n\nDate: 1962\n\nRun Time: 20 min.\n\nNames: Cohen, Sheldon B.; U.S. Communicable Disease Center\n\nAbstract: This program presents an interview between a psychiatrist and a 19-year-old woman with three children, illustrating a conversion reaction. In the initial part of the interview the patient describes her difficulties with headaches, blackout spells, and paralysis of her right arm and leg, which began during her third pregnancy. She states that she was happy about her pregnancy. Although she says she gets angry with her husband, she denies it is a serious problem. The patient is hypnotized during the interview. Afterward she describes her intense feelings of anger toward her husband and expresses her desire to leave him. During this part of the interview her right arm and leg appear to be paralyzed. At the end of the interview the psychiatrist states that the hypnotism was used primarily for the purpose of exploration. He also says that the girl is a dependent person who can't admit to angry feelings. Her paralysis seems to result from the conversion of these angry feelings.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n50.\n\nTitle: Convulsive and allied conditions\n\nDate: 1944\n\nRun Time: 13 min.\n\nNames: Balser, Benjamin H.; Goodhart, Simon P.; Montefiore Hospital, Neuropsychiatric Division\n\nAbstract: This film shows 11 cases of convulsive and allied conditions.

Addicts discuss their experiences in the United States and in Vietnam. Dr. Stanley Yolles, director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), talks about the drug culture and NIMH's role in prevention and treatment. The tape describes growth in the use of marijuana and heroin. David Bazelon, chief judge, U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., clarifies the narcotics laws. The state of California's attempts to develop a civil commitment program focused on treatment rather than punishment are described. In 1966, the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act is the first law to give the addict a choice of treatment or jail. Synanon in California is a private, self-help, residential community that helps people deal with their addictions. New York's Daytop Village works not only with addicts on addictions, but on developing a new lifestyle. Methadone, though still experimental, has proved to be an effective treatment for heroin addiction.

Sprague Institute, University of Chicago\n\nAbstract: This film shows experiments that are designed to investigate the behavioral dynamics of group dominance and aggression in normal and neurotic animals placed in situations of competition and motivational conflict. After individual conditioning, cats are trained in groups of four to compete for food after a bell-light signal. Together, they form a stable dominance hierarchy, and individuals secure food repeatedly without fighting. Aggressive fighting appears in animals either when displaced by a more dominant animal or when made experimentally neurotic. Goal-directed behavior then deviates into aggression mainly directed against animals higher in hierarchy. Amytal temporarily mitigates neurosis, and restores nonaggressive dominancy.

It presents comments from teenage and adult male and female clinical subjects and various scenes from homes, bars, and schools. People describe why they drink alcoholic beverages and the effects of drinking upon their jobs, homes, and social life. The views of the Women's Christian Temperance Union are presented and the conflicting \"unrealistic\" laws of various states in regard to alcohol consumption are discussed. Two noted physicians present their views on alcohol and possible remedies to the current situation. According to this program, the two main reasons for the increase in alcohol abuse are loneliness and escape. While no remedies are presented, the program does explore measures to enact realistic legislation, educate people, change attitudes, and address the hypocrisy in liquor advertising. The problem of the teenage alcoholic is discussed and current measures taken by the public education system are explored and evaluated.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n68.\n\nTitle: Dynamics of an experimental neurosis: its development and techniques for its alleviation\n\nDate: 1944\n\nRun Time: 56 min.\n\nNames: Masserman, Jules Hymen; Neurophysiological Laboratories of the Division of Psychiatry and of the Otho S.A. Sprague Memorial Institute, University of Chicago; Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: Part 1 shows experiments demonstrating that conditioned responses can be established in cats and that these responses give way to neurotic behavior under certain circumstances. It shows conditioned training apparatus for releasing food pellets into a box, and cats being trained to respond to a light or bell signal by going to the food box, lifting the lid, and obtaining the food. Results of the experiment include inhibition of feeding, sensory hyperaesthesias, phobias, motor disturbances, recurrent physiological signs of anxiety, etc. Part 3 demonstrates that experimentally-induced neuroses in cats can be alleviated. This film demonstrates four therapeutic techniques: 1) diminution of one of the conflicting drives (animal is fed before being put in a cage), 2) retraining in a problem situation (petting, gentle hand-feeding, and reassurance), 3) environmental press (animal with maximally-reinforced hunger drive is brought toward food by a movable barrier), and 4) social example (a normal cat which has learned to feed at a signal is placed in the cage with a neurotic animal). Film shows feed box, with light-flash food signal and air blast.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n69.\n\nTitle: Early recognition of learning disability\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 30 min.\n\nNames: National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke; Churchill Films\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this program is to provide information on detecting minimal brain dysfunction at an early age, so that learning problems later in life are less likely. The film presents comparisons between normally-developing children and children with learning disabilities in an elementary school environment. The program illustrates common characteristics of children with possible brain dysfunction. These include hyperactive behavior, erratic body coordination, incorrect spatial relationships, and difficulties in abstract (conceptual) thinking. Activities are presented in which these problems are apparent, such as children attempting to draw and learning to write. The program concludes that if teachers and parents are familiar with the signs of minimal brain damage, they can prevent a disabled child from the confusion and frustration of falling behind. The methods suggested for helping these students include special teachers, resource rooms, and learning booths to protect against distraction.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n70.\n\nTitle: Effects of electroshock therapy on experimental neuroses\n\nDate: 1945\n\nRun Time: 19 min.\n\nNames: Masserman, Jules Hymen; Jacques, Mary Grier; University of Chicago, Division of Psychiatry; Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: This film shows the effects of electro-shock on normal and neurotic cats' behavior, in relation to possible histologic changes in the brain. Normal cats subjected to cerebral electroshock show impairment of complex and recently learned response patterns, as compared with relative persistence of simpler forms of adaptive behavior. Cats made experimentally \"neuroticâ by motivational conflicts, then subjected to electro-shock, show similar disorganization of complex inhibitions, compulsions, and phobias, thus releasing more nearly \"normal\" goal-directed behavior. Alterations of conduct cannot be correlated with pathologic changes in the brain detectable by standard histologic techniques.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n71.\n\nTitle: Effects of morphine on learned adaptive behavior and experimental neuroses in cats\n\nDate: 1942\n\nRun Time: 11 min.\n\nNames: Masserman, Jules Hymen; Wikler, Abraham; Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College; Neurophysiological Laboratories of the Division of Psychiatry and of the Otho S.A. Sprague Memorial Institute, University of Chicago\n\nAbstract: Normal cats are trained to depress a platform switch that activates a feeding signal, and then to squeeze past a barrier to the feeding box. When morphine is administered, more complex and recently acquired behavior disappears, and the cats finally ignore food entirely. In three to four hours, learned behavior reappears but in the reverse order of its disappearance. In cats made neurotic, an injection of morphine produces a temporary abolition of neurotic behavior and the appearance of previously learned adaptive patterns. As the effects wear off, the neurotic behavior tends to reappear.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n72.\n\nTitle: Electroencephalogram\n\nDate: 1941\n\nRun Time: 10 min.\n\nNames: Bennett, Abram E.; Cash, Paul T.; University of Nebraska at Omaha, Dept. of Neurology and Psychiatry; Bishop Clarkson Memorial Hospital, Psychiatric Dept.

Horsley; Leighton, Alexander H.; Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic, Pavlovian Laboratory (Baltimore, Md.)\n\nAbstract: This film depicts lab experiments and observations of two dogs. A two-year-old male dog, Nick, is required to discriminate between a tone of 1012 frequency and one of 1024 frequency for six months. He fails and does not form a new conditioned food reflex in the laboratory. A \"normal\" dog, Billy, is trained and conditioned on and off-leash and demonstrates \"normal\" responses. Nick, the \"neurotic\" dog, is restless and ill at ease. He is given food but will not eat it; he lets it fall out of his mouth. When a leash is attached, Nick will not even put food in his mouth. Nick is taken outside the lab and fed. He eats, but stops and becomes restless as soon as the stimulus is sounded.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n76.\n\nTitle: Experimental compound MER-17 (Frenquel): new blocking agent against the development of LSD-25 psychosis\n\nDate: 1955\n\nRun Time: 32 min.\n\nNames: Fabing, Howard D.; Hillard, William E.\n\nAbstract: The following experiments are designed to assess the value of MER-17 in preventing and alleviating LSD-25 psychoses. The subject, a healthy 22-year-old male volunteer, is given 100 gamma of LSD-25 orally in distilled water. The investigator interviews the subject periodically over the next nine hours. The subject reports physical restlessness and mental apprehension, depression, confusion, sadness, loss of time perception, and nervousness. Nine hours after taking the drug, as its effects are wearing off, the subject reports feeling confused while under its influence. A day later, the subject reports that his feelings while under the influence of the drug were dissociated; he felt plagued, pounded. The following week, the subject is given a 5 mg. tablet of MER-17 twice a day for six days and one tablet on the seventh day. In interviews over the subsequent six hours, the subject reports feeling physically restless, but has none of the unpleasant mental reaction he had when he first took LSD alone. In the final experiment, the subject is shown under the influence of LSD. He is then given MER-17 intravenously, and his mental state begins to return to normal within minutes.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n77.\n\nTitle: Experimentally produced neurotic behavior in the rat\n\nDate: 1938\n\nRun Time: 16 min.\n\nNames: Maier, Norman R. F.; Glaser, Nathan M.; Psychological Cinema Register of the Pennsylvania State College\n\nAbstract: This film is a pictorial presentation of neurotic behavior in rats, with an attempt at diagnosis. Rats are trained using the Lashley jumping apparatus to react in a certain manner. Afterwards, the stimulus is removed, and a situation is structured in which the only learned responses available are negative ones. The results are either new adaptations to old learned behavior, or neurotic behavior. Neurotic behavior begins with a violent outburst but is followed by passive behavior, even when the rat is returned to his cage with other rats.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n78.\n\nTitle: Faces of depression\n\nDate: 1960\n\nRun Time: 29 min.\n\nNames: Robert Anderson Associates; Montr&#233;al General Hospital; Jewish Hospital of Hope; Verdun Protestant Hospital\n\nAbstract: This film includes an image of a 16th-century artist's sketch of depression, as well as physician interviews with many men and women who suffer from depression. Interviews include: an elderly woman who is soft-spoken and agitated, a young woman who tried to commit suicide and is reticent in answering questions, a female schizophrenic who consistently looks down and is unable to say \"no,\" an elderly man who admits that he drinks heavily in response to depression, and a middle-aged business man who feels hopeless.

(Ray Silvio); Kenna, Marita D.; University of Pittsburgh\n\nAbstract: Originally shown on closed-circuit TV as part of the postgraduate program of the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, this film features Helen Ross, educator, psychoanalyst, and expert on children. On the panel with her are Marita Kenna, M.D., child psychiatrist, and Ray Greco, M.D., general practitioner. The discussion is on the fantasy world of small children, mostly of pre-school age, concerning their own body image, the meaning of illness, what going to the hospital or doctor's office means, etc. Emphasis is placed on the need for the adults (parents, physicians, nurses, etc.) to realize the existence of the fantasy world and the need to understand it.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n80.\n\nTitle: Fears of children\n\nDate: 1952\n\nRun Time: 28 min.\n\nNames: Bryan, Julien Hequembourg; Hellams, Alfred A.; Senn, Milton J. E.; Ridenour, Nina; International Film Foundation; National Association for Mental Health\n\nAbstract: A series of episodes typical of those arising in families with small children shows how the fears of a normal five-year-old named Paul are related to feelings about parents. His fears--of the dark, of being alone, of new situations--not only prevent him from enjoying experiences that other boys enjoy, but tend to widen the gap of misunderstanding between him and his parents. The film points out that Paul's feelings are common to children of his age and may be accentuated when parents become either unduly protective or over-severe.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n81.\n\nTitle: Feeling of hostility\n\nDate: 1948\n\nRun Time: 30 min.\n\nNames: Prados, Miguel; Allan Memorial Institute, McGill University; Royal Victoria Hospital (Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec); Mental Health Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare, Canada; National Film Board of Canada\n\nAbstract: This films covers the case history of a young woman who is outwardly successful, but has an inadequate personality. The cause of her feelings of resentment toward others and the resulting failure in personal relationships are traced in detail through her early childhood, until we see her in a responsible editorial job in a publishing firm, her hostility directed into constructive effort. A trailer is attached to the film, in which a psychiatrist sums up several factors that have contributed to the development of her particular personality, her emotional inadequacy, and her feelings of hostility in personal relationships. He suggests some ways parents can avoid similar patterns of development in their children.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n82.\n\nTitle: Feeling of rejection: its development and growth\n\nDate: 1947\n\nRun Time: 20 min.\n\nNames: Ruddick, Bruce; Allan Memorial Institute, McGill University; Royal Victoria Hospital (Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec); Mental Health Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare, Canada; National Film Board of Canada\n\nAbstract: This is the dramatization of the case history of Margaret, a 23-year-old girl who has physical disorders with no clear cause. A psychiatrist, probing Margaretâs past, shows her the root of her troubles--childhood overprotection and discouragement of her efforts to express herself, resulting in a crippling fear of failure and a complete inability to assert herself. When Margaret understands her problem, she begins to handle it, starting new and healthier habits of behavior.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n83.\n\nTitle: Feelings of depression\n\nDate: 1950\n\nRun Time: 30 min.\n\nNames: Prados, Miguel; Ruddick, Bruce; Cameron, Ewen; Stogdill, Charles G.; Mental Health Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare, Canada; National Film Board of Canada\n\nAbstract: This is the case history of John Murray, in his early thirties, ordinarily a conscientious, hard-working businessman, who suddenly suffers periods of great despondency.

The battlefield conditions that lead to acute anxiety neurosis in a British soldier, his evacuation from the front to an aid station, and his sympathetic treatment by the medical officer there are presented in story form. The medical officer discusses combat exhaustion with his sergeant. Footage is shown of soldiers suffering from confusion, anxiety, hysterical conversion, and dissociation. Basic initial treatment consists of hot food and drink and a sedative. Severe cases are sent to the rear to the corps exhaustion center. Usually, a six-day stay is sufficient for recovery. For the first 48 hours in the center, the patient is allowed plenty of hot food and sedated sleep. For the second 48 hours, he socializes, plays games, and does light work like mending and repairing his gear. During this period, he is interviewed by a psychiatrist. During the third 48-hour period, he returns to normal garrison life. At the end of six days, if he is considered fit, he returns to his unit. A medical officer explains the nature of combat exhaustion to a skeptical line officer.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n86.\n\nTitle: Fountain House\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 29 min.\n\nNames: Fountain House; Beard, John; WTTW-TV (Chicago, Ill.)\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this presentation is to describe the work done by the staff and residents of Fountain House, a mental health community facility in New York City. The history of Fountain House is traced from its beginning in 1948 as a club for women recently discharged from private and public mental health hospitals, through the present day. The old facility is shown first, then the new building that was constructed and opened 18 months before the filming of this program. The residents are shown involved in arts and crafts, social functions, and various jobs such as typing, messenger services, etc. Members operate the switchboard, the canteen, and a thrift shop. Other residents purchase food and operate the lunchroom at the House, serving about 200 lunches per day. The program stresses the importance of determining areas in which a patient can be productive and use his capabilities. The program then focuses on the importance of the community in helping to plan and meet the needs of the residents. A local fast food chain is asked to allow residents to come in and learn the assistant manager's job for several hours each day. This effort led to the employment of other residents on a full and part-time basis. Fountain House also rented 26 apartments in various neighborhoods, in which several members can pool their resources, live within their means, and avoid loneliness.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n87.\n\nTitle: Free-expression painting in child psychiatry\n\nDate: 1966\n\nRun Time: 17 min.\n\nNames: Geigy Pharmaceuticals; Condor-Films Ltd.; Edelmann, Claude; Amado, Georges.; Genti, R.; Lebovici, L.\n\nAbstract: This program shows the use of free-expression painting in child psychiatry, which is portrayed as both an educational and a therapeutic technique. Disturbed children are often more dominated by fantasies than normal children and their paintings can aid in establishing a diagnosis. For the paintings to have therapeutic value, they must be related to the patientâs other paintings, to the medical history, and to clinical findings. Overall, symbols in the paintings are less important than the relationships they represent. Various paintings done by different children are presented and discussed. The paintings are at times discussed as points of reference that represent certain stages of the therapeutic relationship. The program discusses and illustrates pictorially how children represent their own bodies, and their relationships with their mothers, with others, and with the outside world. The program discusses the use of free-expression painting with the following children: an eight-year-old boy who has morbid fears and anxieties about being abandoned; a seven-and-a-half-year-old girl who is intellectually mature but who sees herself as a child of four or five; a ten-year-old who is excessively dependent on her mother; an eleven-year-old girl who is uncommunicative after sexual trauma; and a schizophrenic child.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n88.\n\nTitle: From ten to twelve\n\nDate: 1957\n\nRun Time: 26 min.\n\nNames: Roberts, C.

It looks at the extent of interest in the opposite gender, attitudes toward parents, and how these pre-teens fit themselves into social groupings. The film notes that girls mature earlier and are usually academically ahead of boys at this stage, by as much as a year. It presents a case study of a family in which one son has a problem -- he argued with a referee during a sports match and may be kicked off the team -- and how the parents handle that problem.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n89.\n\nTitle: Gesell developmental and neurologic examination\n\nDate: 1964\n\nRun Time: 27 min.\n\nNames: Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio; Ohio State University, Child Development Service\n\nAbstract: This film describes and demonstrates the Gesell developmental and neurologic examination, using clinical subjects, structural models, and various toys. According to this presentation, key ages provide dramatic views of infant development and foreshadow future development. Immature patterns are shown and discussed and the child's behavioral responses are analyzed and described. The first child is shown at 16 weeks. Various objects such as a dangling ring, rattle, and bell are placed in front of him, and his actions and reactions are described. The program considers his posture, eye movements, coordination, arm movements, leg movements, visual perception, gross and fine motor movements, auditory perception, and social behavior. The program notes that looking, reaching, contacting, grasping, and manipulating constitute a developmental sequence. Children are shown at 28 weeks, 40 weeks, and 52 weeks.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n90.\n\nTitle: Getting ready emotionally/a Coronet film\n\nDate: 1951\n\nRun Time: 11 min.\n\nNames: Coronet Instructional Films; National Education Association of the United States\n\nAbstract: This film is part of the series \"Are you ready for service?\" It helps young men and their parents understand the emotional problems often encountered in military service and the attitudinal changes that can be helpful.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n91.\n\nTitle: Grief, a peril in infancy\n\nDate: 1947\n\nRun Time: 24 min.\n\nNames: Psychoanalytic Research Project on Problems of Infancy; Spitz, Ren&#233; A.; Wolf, Katherine M.\n\nAbstract: This film shows the effect upon infants of prolonged absence of the mother. A number of babies in a foundling home are shown. The film indicates that among infants under a year old, if the mother returns after an interval of fewer than three months, their recovery is rapid. If the absence is prolonged beyond this period, it becomes impossible to achieve contact with them, and they become passive and apathetic and begin to suffer damage to their personalities. The film suggests that it is the emotional climate provided by the mother that allows the child's mind to develop normally.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n92.\n\nTitle: Group studies, social psychiatry\n\nDate: 1966\n\nRun Time: 21 min.\n\nNames: Lindemann, Erich; Mason, Edward A.; Harvard Medical School, Mental Health Training Film Program\n\nAbstract: Emphasizing the importance of the study of social systems, institutional and social structure, and the concept of role, Dr. Lindemann mentions a range of group studies that have contributed to the development of the field of social and community psychiatry.

During the session the therapist tries to help each person express his own feelings while also being aware of the concerns of others. There is no quick resolution of problems, but there are insights made that can be applied to staff members' daily lives, their work with the children, and their future growth in therapy situations. At the camp the group meets twice a week with a senior staff member, in this case, John Brown, the executive director of the camp. The group session begins with a discussion of the members' reactions to the filming crew and the fact that they will be filmed while sharing intimate feelings. John Brown has just returned after being away and members of the group explore their feelings about his absence. During the session the following subjects and the feelings they evoke are explored: a member who is ill with phlebitis and fears being rejected by the group, two males vying for the attention of one female, one male member having difficulty relating to a particular female member, and one female's reaction to the loss of her mother and the group's efforts to try to help her.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n94.\n\nTitle: Handle with care\n\nDate: 1965?\n\nRun Time: 29 min.\n\nNames: Pearson, Paul H.\n\nAbstract: The program demonstrates and stresses the importance of a central agency in the community to assist families in coping with the problem of mental retardation. The program achieves its objective primarily through the use of brief descriptions of cases of specific individuals and the services they received in Los Angeles. The program includes cases of mentally retarded infants, children, and young adults. The program discusses their mental, physical, social, and economic needs. The program also discusses how social workers, hearing and speech therapists, nurses, educational specialists, religious groups, and sheltered workshops help these individuals and their families meet their needs.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n95.\n\nTitle: Hands: psychiatric occupational therapy\n\nDate: 1960\n\nRun Time: 28 min.\n\nNames: Nebraska Psychiatric Institute; University of Nebraska, College of Medicine\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this program is to illustrate treatment of a schizophrenic patient through occupational therapy. This is achieved through a \"case history in clay\" of Jane, a 27-year-old schizophrenic woman. The program focuses primarily on her 18-month hospital stay. Jane shows characteristic schizophrenic behavior such as unpredictable actions, refusal to speak, and distortions in perception. Particular emphasis is given to the patient's use of clay to vent anger and represent feelings about herself. Discussions between the therapist and psychiatrist are illustrated with conjectures on Jane's progress as observed through changes in the clay figures she has made. The program concludes with Jane responding positively to the therapist's reassurance and offers to help, as shown by improved behavior and willingness to return to her job and home life.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n96.\n\nTitle: Help wanted\n\nDate: 1961?\n\nRun Time: 26 min.\n\nNames: Martin, Harold R.; Nebraska Psychiatric Institute, University of Nebraska College of Medicine\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate the importance of including the rehabilitation counselor as part of the team in the total rehabilitation of the mental patient. This objective is achieved with the aid of clinical subjects, drawings, and animation. The program stresses that patients have different problems, and each must be helped according to individual abilities and limitations. Joyce, a 24-year-old schizophrenic patient, is shown applying for a job. When her past mental illness is disclosed, she is not hired, and becomes depressed and discouraged. The work of the rehabilitation counselor is then depicted. He discusses Joyce's preferences regarding employment, determines her aptitude for positions, her interests and abilities, and discusses these with other members of the team. A school is found in which she can take a refresher course while still hospitalized, and with the aid of the counselor begins to rebuild her self-confidence. The program then focuses on Mike, a 63-year-old male with acute depression, who is also a diabetic. He is sent to a pre-vocational work evaluation program to determine what type of work would best suit his physical and mental capabilities. The findings of this evaluation are discussed with the patient. Since the patient lives almost 200 miles from the hospital, the counselor paves the way for the patient to begin adjusting to a new counselor, who will work with him after his return home. The role of the State Office of Vocational Rehabilitation is described briefly as the two counselors meet and discuss the patient.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n97.\n\nTitle: Heredity and pre-natal development\n\nDate: 1950\n\nRun Time: 21 min.\n\nNames: McGraw-Hill Text-Films (New York, N.Y.)\n\nAbstract: This film explains the role of chromosomes and genes in determining sex and transmitting potential physical and mental characteristics to offspring; describes fertilization of the ovum by the sperm cell; and traces development of the fetus until delivery.

It provides a case study of a frustrated, insecure boy whose home life has allowed him no freedom to develop as a normal person, but has instead conditioned him to hate anyone or any group different from him or his group. His situation reaches a crisis point when he is hurt in a teenage gang fight on Chicago's South Side, precipitated by anti-Polish sentiment.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n100.\n\nTitle: Homefires\n\nDate: 1963\n\nRun Time: 28 min.\n\nNames: Mental Health Film Board (New York, N.Y.); National Council for Homemaker Services; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Education, Division of Adult and Vocational Research\n\nAbstract: The Homemaker Service provides physical assistance to families and individuals in their own homes. The camera follows one homemaker as she cares for the families assigned to her. She is shown as she shops, prepares meals, and does light housework for an elderly couple who would otherwise be unable to live on their own. The homemaker works under the supervision of a public health nurse. When a Puerto Rican mother of six is injured, the homemaker looks after the children and helps with the housework as the mother recuperates. Because the mother is unfamiliar with some American ways and is not well-educated, the homemaker teaches her how to use household equipment, how to budget household money, and how to plan nutritionally balanced meals. As the homemaker helps to care for a third, more affluent family, she becomes aware of the strain they are under because of the motherâs hospitalization for depression and the fatherâs negative attitude toward the mother. She calls for expert help in this situation. The homemaker is also shown attending an in-service training session. The film emphasizes that the women who staff the Homemaker Service are, for the most part, women who have raised families and taken care of homes of their own.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n101.\n\nTitle: Horizon House\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 29 min.\n\nNames: Horizon House; Rutman, Irvin D.; WTTW-TV (Chicago, Ill.)\n\nAbstract: This film depicts the work of the staff and residents of Horizon House, a community-based mental health facility in Philadelphia. The program features clinical subjects, staff, and residents, and stresses the importance of community involvement in planning and meeting the needs of all. The challenges facing the patient about to be discharged from a mental hospital are discussed, including housing, employment, and loneliness. The planning done today is compared and contrasted with that of fifteen years ago. The program focuses on the establishment of Horizon House, first founded as a social club. Horizon later added rehabilitation services, residential services, social casework, and sheltered workshops. In a recent innovation it became associated with the Jefferson County Community Medical Center as a community mental health facility, with links to other health and welfare resources in the area. The program then focuses on the work of the Horizon House teams, comprised of professional and nonprofessional staff members and community members. These teams make home visits to patients and are concerned with housing, money, food, clothing and friends, and assistance in problem solving.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n102.\n\nTitle: Horla\n\nDate: 196-?\n\nRun Time: 30 min.\n\nNames: Maupassant, Guy de; Sandoz Pharmaceuticals\n\nAbstract: The purpose of this program is to illustrate, in narrative form, the behavior patterns of a young man who develops a psychosis that eventually leads to suicide. The program deals with the man's thoughts and reactions to changes that are occurring in his life, portraying a man who thinks he is going insane and subsequently records his thoughts and feelings in diary form. The types of feelings and behavior changes illustrated include insomnia, depression, exhaustion, feelings of being possessed, and feelings of leading a double life. The young man gives these feelings an identity, calling them Horla. At the end of the presentation he decides that suicide is the only method of escape from the Horla. The name \"Horla\" derives from an 1887 short story of that name by Guy de Maupassant.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n103.\n\nTitle: Hospitalized person\n\nDate: 1970\n\nRun Time: 25 min.\n\nNames: Concept Media\n\nAbstract: This program focuses primarily on the anxieties and apprehensions that can result from an illness and period of hospitalization. Psychological effects of such lengthy illness include the tendency to become egocentric, demanding, and dependent, and to use regression as a coping mechanism. Also discussed are the effects of pain and the failure to improve on the individual's anxiety level. The effects of hospitalization, depersonalization, dependency, and loneliness are explored. The essentially passive role of the patient and its effect on an individual is also discussed, along with the importance of recognizing the individual as a unique and worthwhile person.

In the film, the developmental task of learning to walk is studied and documented at 23 defined stages. Infants from the ages of one week to 18 months are shown exhibiting motor abilities that Gesell contends are characteristic of the ability to walk upright. Development progresses from cephalo to caudal, and proximal to distal. The infants are shown, usually alone, lying prone on a light-colored mat. In some sequences an attendant appears wearing a lab coat. Most sequences are shot from slightly above or directly above the prone child. Some sequences show the babies on a mat that has been marked with concentric circles so the viewer can easily measure the distance the child moves.\n\nLink to catalog record\n\n105.\n\nTitle: Hysterical neurosis, dissociative type\n\nDate: 1969\n\nRun Time: 10 min.\n\nNames: University of Mississippi Medical Center, Dept. of Psychiatry\n\nAbstract: This presentation consists of televised excerpts or \"telexamples\" of an interview between a psychiatrist and a patient with a hysterical neurosis.
