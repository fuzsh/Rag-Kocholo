        "text": "Clinical Studies\n\nDonald and his team with the benefit of priority made some early breakthroughs and in 1963 had described the early diagnosis of hydatid mole (with its snowstorm appearance), assessment and growth of the early gestation sac (by the full bladder technique) and the diagnosis of early pregnancy complications (Donald, 1962).\n\nPlacentography: Accurate location of the placenta was the holy grail of antenatal diagnosis in the early 1960’s for placenta praevia was the cause of significant maternal mortality due to severe haemorrhage in late gestation. Many radioisotope methods were used at this time but they were unable to accurately define the lower placental edge. In 1966 Ken Gottesfeld and the Denver group published the first paper on ultrasound placentography (Gottesfeld et al., 1966) although they were unable to visualise the posterior placenta (posterior praevia was implied by a space posterior to the fetal head) and it was not till 1968 that Donald and Usama Abdulla in a larger study (Donald and Abdulla, 1968) and with their superior equipment were able to demonstrate placenta in all locations including posterior praevia.\n\nFetal biometry: The initial studies in fetal biometry began with using a blind A- scan measurement of the biparietal diameter (BPD) and James Willocks from Donald’s department published an interesting paper on head growth in the third trimester showing different rates of growth between growth restricted and normally growing fetuses. The method was intrinsically inaccurate however and precision was needed for meaningful biometry. This was provided by one of Donald’s registrars, Stuart Campbell who described the B mode technique in 1968 where the midline echo of the fetal head was visualised in 2D and then an A-scan measurement was made between the parietal eminences at the widest point. It was not until on-screen callipers were introduced several years later that A-scan was no longer required. Campbell demonstrated that the midline echo could be seen reliably from 13 weeks gestation and soon showed that second trimester cephalometry was an effective method of dating pregnancy in women with uncertain dates introducing the concept of an ultrasound expected date of confinement (EDD) (Campbell, 1969). Following this he developed the first cephalometry graph from 13 to 40 weeks and used this to identify the IUGR fetus by showing a sharp slowing of biparietal diameter growth in the third trimester (Campbell and Dewhurst, 1971). Cephalometry graphs were subsequently produced by Manfred Hansmann, Alfred Kratochwil, Rudi Sabbagha and many others and serial cephalometry became a standard method of measuring fetal growth for many years.\n\nThe disadvantage of just measuring the fetal head is that brain is the last structure to be affected in growth restriction and Horace Thompson and Ed Makowsky from Denver in 1971 introduced measurement of the thoracic circumference (TC) and the concept of fetal weight prediction using a combination of this measurement and the BPD (Thompson and Makowski, 1971). Manfred Hansmann in Bonn confirmed these results and demonstrated an asymmetry between the BPD measurement and the thoracic circumference in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses. Stuart Campbell who had now moved to Queen Charlotte’s Hospital in London believed there were intrinsic problems with reproducibility with TC measurements as the chest is cone shaped in the fetus and there was no reliable marker to indicate the level of the scan. In 1975 he introduced the abdominal circumference measurement (AC) at the level of the intra abdominal umbilical vein as a more reliable measurement and this has become a standard measurement since (Campbell and Wilkin, 1975). As the AC measurement is at the level of the liver which is the most severely affected organ in IUGR the head circumference to abdomen circumference ratio was introduced as a means of recognising the brain spared IUGR fetus.\n\nThe value of routine screening of the obstetric population for accurate dating, early detection of twin gestations and placental location was first demonstrated by Lars Grennert and Per Persson from Malmo (Grennert et al., 1978) who described the evolution of a routine screening programme over a 5 year period; 24% of women had an uncertain EDD and 95% of women were delivered within 12 days of the ultrasound prediction. Also 95% of twins were detected in the second trimester as opposed to 70% before the programme was started.\n\nEarly pregnancy: Kratochwil using his transvaginal transducer demonstrated fetal cardiac motion by A-scan from 7 weeks gestation in 1967 but most studies in the 60’s and early 70’s were carried out abdominally by the full bladder technique. For example Bang and Holm from the Copenhagen school reported identifying the fetal heart beat from 10 weeks gestation in 1968 (Bang and Holm, 1968). The seminal work on early pregnancy assessment came from Hugh Robinson from the Glasgow school. In 1973 using an improved Diasonograph he produced the first detailed biometry charts of the fetal crown-rump length from 7 to 16 weeks gestation; his measurements were so meticulous that they are still in use today (Robinson, 1973).\n\nUsing the combined A- and B-mode equipment he subsequently produced charts of the fetal heart rate from 7 weeks gestation and showed that the detection rate was 100%. He was the first to point out the prognostic significance of finding a fetal heartbeat at 8 weeks gestation in relation to subsequent fetal demise (Robinson and Shaw-Dunn, 1973). This work had profound influence on the management of patients with threatened abortion.\n\nFetal abnormalities: Anecdotal reports of the prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities in women with polyhydramnios in the late second or third trimester were made by Bertil Sunden in 1964 (a case of anencephaly) and William Garrett in 1970 who described a case of polycystic kidneys. Ultrasound prenatal diagnosis really began with the Lancet paper by Campbell and his group who in 1972 reported the diagnosis of anencephaly at 17 weeks which resulted in elective termination of pregnancy (Campbell et al., 1972). Subsequent to this he systematically examined the fetal spine in women with raised serum AFP and reported the diagnosis of spina bifida in 1975.\n\nBy 1977 he was able to report on 329 high risk pregnancies examined between 16 and 20 weeks in which ultrasound detected 25 of the 28 neural tube defects; 10 of the 13 cases of spina bifida were detected with the false negatives being low sacral lesions (Campbell, 1977). In the USA, John Hobbins and his team at Yale in 1978 described the prenatal diagnosis of several abnormalities including limb reduction defects (Hobbins et al., 1979). The widespread use of ultrasound in prenatal diagnosis came with the invention of the real time scanning machines.\n\nClinical Studies in Obstetrics\n\nThe development of real time scanning was a great democratising influence in obstetric scanning which was no longer confined to an elite group of experts in a few major centres. Real time scanners being inexpensive were now widely available and many experienced practitioners of static scanning were surprised (and not a little discomfited) at how quickly their junior doctors, midwives and sonographers became experts in scanning almost overnight.\n\nFetal biometry: The ease with which the probe could be manipulated meant that many fetal structures were measured and a great number of charts of different planes and organs were developed. For example charts of inter-orbital diameter (Mayden et al., 1982), long bones, foot length, ear length, the sizes of virtually every fetal organ and multiple ratios between parameters like femur to foot were produced within a space of a few years. However the standard measurements CRL, BPD, head circumference and abdomen circumference which were developed during the static era remained the standard fetal biometric measurements for assessing growth with only the addition of the femur length (which was now easier to measure) incorporated into equations for fetal weight and growth predictions (Hadlock et al., 1985).\n\nFetal activity: Studies of fetal behaviour were inspired by leaders in development biology such as Geoffrey Dawes in Oxford and Heinz Prechtl in Nijmegan. The ability to follow fetal movements by ultrasound inspired much interest as to whether quantification of these movements and especially fetal breathing movements might be helpful in assessing fetal wellbeing. In the late 1970’s detailed studies using event markers on a chart recorder were made by groups led by Karel Marsal in Malmo (Marsal et al., 1976), John Patrick in London, Ontario and Alistair Roberts in London. The time, incidence and number of movement episodes or fetal breaths were quantitatively assessed and behavioural states identified. Both fetal breathing movements and fetal activity are episodic and are rarely concordant so the concept of measuring total fetal activity over a 30 minute period was employed. Although there was an association between reduced total activity and IUGR, the test had a low predictive value for a positive test due to the large physiological variation in the incidence of both breathing and motor activity (Marsal, 1978). For this reason in Europe the measurement of fetal activity fell out of favour as a means of assessing fetal well being. In USA however Frank Manning and Larry Platt in 1980 incorporated both of these measures into a 30 minute fetal biophysical profile test (Manning et al., 1980) which also included an assessment of amniotic fluid, fetal tone and a non stress test (CTG) of the fetal heart. This test with minor modifications became the mainstay of fetal wellbeing assessment in the United States for over 20 years. In Europe however researchers turned increasingly to Doppler Ultrasound to solve the problem as to how to effectively assess fetal wellbeing and optimise the timing of delivery when there is fetal compromise.\n\nDoppler Assessment: The demonstration of the umbilical artery waveform using blind continuous wave (CW) Doppler was reported as early as the mid 1960’s from Osaka, Japan and in 1977 by D.E. Fitzgerald and John Drumm from Dublin using 2D static scans to identify where the probe should be placed but neither of these two groups followed up their observations. Two groups initiated pulsed Doppler studies of the fetus. In Australia, Robert Gill working with the Kossoff group measured flow velocity in the umbilical vein (Gill et al., 1981). However the long path length of the Octason prevented the measurement of high velocity arterial flow and this system was impractical for clinical Doppler studies. Sturla Eik-Nes working in Karel Marsal’s department in Malmo described the first duplex linear array system (Eik-Nes et al., 1980) where an offset pulsed Doppler probe was attached at a fixed angle of 52 degrees. He measured flow velocities from the fetal aorta and found that they were reduced in IUGR fetuses. Equipment similar to the Malmo duplex Doppler system was used by workers in several academic units in the early to mid 1980’s across Europe to define the fetal circulatory response to hypoxia. It was found that absolute velocity measurements were inferior to waveform analysis especially the pulsatility index in the assessment changes in the fetal circulation to hypoxia. Yuri Wladimiroff in Rotterdam was the first to draw attention to the compensatory increase in the cerebral circulation or “centralisation of the fetal circulation” associated with IUGR fetuses (Wladimiroff et al., 1986). Wladimiroff also correlated circulatory changes with behavioural states (Wladimiroff 1994) while Campbell, David Griffin and Kypros Nicolaides at King’s College Hospital in London correlated these changes with blood gases obtained by cordocentesis (Bilardo et al., 1990). In Australia Brian Trudinger and Warwick Giles rediscovered the importance of the umbilical artery waveform and established the significance of absent and reversed end diastolic flow (Trudinger et al., 1986). In 1983 Campbell and his group described the uterine artery waveform and the appearance of notching which together with a high resistance index was associated with pre-eclampsia (Campbell et al., 1982). His group subsequently used this finding to screen the pregnant population at 24 weeks gestation to predict the subsequent development of preeclampsia.and IUGR and showed a high sensitivity for the severe forms of these conditions (Harrington et al., 1996).\n\nThe advent of colour Doppler as an integral part of the ultrasound machine made visualisation of fetal vessels much easier and studies of virtually every fetal artery (such as the renal, splanchnic, cerebral) was investigated and charts made of the gestational changes of PI under different clinical circumstances. In the early 90’s the principal vessels studied to evaluate fetal wellbeing were the umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery. Although these were useful they were no better than the antenatal CTG in determining the optimal time to deliver the compromised fetus. This led to several groups investigating the venous side of the fetal circulation. Initial studies concentrated on the inferior vena cava but in 1991 in a landmark Lancet paper, Torvid Kiserud from the Eik-Nes group in Trontheim, Norway described the measurement of the pulsatility of the ductus venosus (Kiserud et al., 1991) which has become established as a key measure of cardiac function and indicator fetal asphyxia. With modern equipment, Doppler evaluation of the fetal circulation especially umbilical and middle cerebral arteries and ductus venosus is now established as a fundamental requirement in the assessment of fetal wellbeing and the timing of delivery of the compromised fetus. A further important use of Doppler was its use as non-invasive method of diagnosing anaemia in Rh immunised fetuses which was popularised by Giancarlo Mari and the group at Yale University following a paper in the New England journal of Medicine in 2000 (Mari et al., 2000).\n\nThe prediction of pre-eclampsia and IUGR by uterine artery Doppler was further explored by Nicolaides in a very large multicentre studies. They showed in 2001 that the uterine artery PI performed at 23 weeks predicted 85% of women who would develop severe pre-eclampsia for only a 5% screen positive rate (Papageorghiou et al., 2001). One of the problems is that prevention by agents such as low dose aspirin does not seem to be effective. Nicolaides and others are now exploring the possibility of screening for pre-eclampsia in the first trimester (when preventive therapy appears to be effective) using uterine artery Doppler and biochemical markers such as PlGF and PAPP-A (Akolekar et al., 2013).\n\nPreterm birth: Preterm labour is the greatest cause of neonatal death and handicap and the care of the preterm baby is hugely expensive. Although the causes of spontaneous pre-term labour are many and not fully understood, a common final pathway is shortening and effacement of the cervix. Several studies in the early 1980’s using transabdominal sonography drew attention to the association between a short cervix and funnelling with cervical incompetence. Frank Andersen from Ann Arbor Michigan was the first to draw attention to the superiority of transvaginal scanning (Andersen et al., 1990) and provided a risk for preterm delivery based on a cervical length. Subsequent studies by Jay Iams from Columbus, Ohio (Iams et al., 1996), Kypros Nicolaides from King’s College, London have confirmed that screening around 23-24 weeks gestation will predict a large percentage of women who will go into preterm labour. For example Nicolaides screened over 32,000 women at 23 weeks and was able to identify 50% of women delivering before 33 weeks gestation by using a cut-off cervical length of 15mm (Heath et al., 1998). Unfortunately cervical cerclage does not appear to be effective in extending gestation in these women but two major studies from the Nicolaides group in London and the group of Robert Romero at Wayne State University, Detroit have demonstrated that following universal screening between 19 and 24 weeks, a significant prolongation of gestation in women with a sonographic shortened cervix can be achieved with daily vaginal progesterone treatment (Romero et al., 2011).\n\nFetal abnormality screening: Following the introduction of real time scanning there was a large number of review papers documenting the experience of tertiary centres in diagnosing a wide range of abnormalities of virtually every organ of the fetal body. By the mid 1980’s most hospitals had introduced screening for fetal abnormalities as part of the routine 20 week scan. Many of the studies published at this time were invalid because of low ascertainment of anomalies in the newborn (the prevalence should be between 2 and 3 per cent). A controversial American multicentre study (RADIUS) published in 1993 (Ewigman et al., 1993) demonstrated a low detection rate of 17 per cent for the early detection of fetal abnormalities but this was not the experience in European centres. Multicentre studies as a rule had lower detection rates than those from single centres. For example in Salvator Levi’s large Belgian multicentre study conducted between 1990 and 1992 only 40% of fetuses with anomalies were detected before 23 weeks (Levi et al., 1991) while Carrera in a single centre in Barcelona reported an 85% detection rate in a similar time period (Carrera et al., 1995).\n\nFetal Cardiac defects: For the first time the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities was now possible. In 1980, two breakthrough papers on real time fetal echocardiography were published by Lindsey Allan from King’s College Hospital, London and Charles Kleinman from Yale. In her classic study Allan (Allan et al., 1980) was the first to describe the systematic examination of the heart to demonstrate the 4 chamber view and outflow tracts and published images of the 8 classic ultrasound views together with anatomic correlates and was one of the first to promote routine screening for fetal cardiac abnormalities.\n\nIn 1997 S-J Yoo (Yoo et al., 1997) described an additional classic view, namely the 3 vessel view of the outflow tracts. The advent of colour Doppler facilitated studies of intracardiac flow with groups led by Greg DeVore (DeVore et al., 1987), Rabih Chaoui and Ulrich Gembruch making significant contributions.\n\nFetal Chromosome Abnormalities: before the real time revolution amniocentesis was offered to the “high risk” group of women over the age of 35 years but this policy failed to diagnose the 70 per cent of babies with Down syndrome who were born to younger women. In 1985 Beryl Benacerraf and her group in Boston first described that an increased nuchal skin fold measurement in the second trimester was associated with Down syndrome (Benacerraf et al., 1985) and subsequently described the other classic second trimester markers of shortened femur and pyelectasia. For the first time younger women could be offered amniocentesis on the basis of a combination of markers. The decisive breakthrough came in 1992 when Kypros Nicolaides from King’s in London described the first trimester measurement of nuchal translucency in the diagnosis of Down’s syndrome (Nicolaides et al., 1992). Nicolaides and his group subsequently demonstrated the association of increased nuchal translucency, absence of the nasal bone, tricuspid regurgitation and increased ductus venosus PI with Down’s syndrome. They have combined these ultrasound markers with the measurement of serum PAPP-A and free beta HCG (called combined biomarkers) to provide a likelihood ratio for the presence of Down’s syndrome. With the combined biomarker programme 90 per cent of Down’s syndrome fetuses are detected for a 5 per cent screen positive rate. (Nicolaides, 2011) With CVS being offered as the diagnostic test to women at increased risk, this screening programme has been adopted throughout the world. However this is likely to change with the advent of cell-free DNA testing (Lo et al., 1997). Recent studies have shown that cfDNA screening in a maternal blood sample at 10 weeks gestation (called Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing or NIPT) will detect more than 99% of cases of trisomy 21 for a false positive rate of about 0.1% (Chiu et al., 2011) which is a significant improvement of the combined biomarkers of ultrasound and biochemistry. Furthermore in the future cfDNA is likely to be able to screen for a wide range of chromosome and genetic disorders. At the moment “contingency testing” incorporating biomarkers and cfDNA is recommended to reduce cost but there is little doubt that NIPT will become the method of choice in the not too distant future.\n\nInvasive procedures: The importance of identifying the position of the needle during amniocentesis was first highlighted by Jens Bang in Copenhagen in 1973 (Bang and Northeved, 1972) during the static scan era but few practitioners used his transducer with a central hole and scans at this time were usually used to identify a placenta-free accessible pool of fluid prior to the procedure. The advent of real time scanning allowed the performance of invasive procedures under continuous vision thus reducing bloody taps and avoiding placental, cord or fetal injury. In 1974 fetoscopy was introduced by John Hobbins and Maurice Mahoney at Yale for the prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies (Hobbins and Mahoney, 1974) from fetal red blood cells obtained from the chorionic plate. Many believed that this technique would supersede ultrasound guided methods especially when Rodeck and Campbell at King’s in London described the obtaining of pure fetal blood from the umbilical vein by this method and Niels Hahnemann and Jan Mohr with a similar instrument obtained chorionic tissue trancervically for genetic diagnosis. However in 1983 Fernand Daffos and co-workers from Paris introduced pure fetal blood sampling from the cord insertion by direct ultrasound guided needling using two operators (Daffos et al., 1983) and subsequently Nicolaides from King’s perfected the single operator two hands method and called it cordocentesis. He and his team used this technique to assess the severity of fetal anaemia in rhesus disease thus supplanting the old method based on bilirubin measurements in the amniotic fluid (Nicolaides et al., 1988). Nicolaides and others such as Giorgio Pardi in Milan also used this technique to assess aspects of fetal acid base status and biochemistry in the IUGR fetus (Pardi et al., 1987). Another nail in the coffin for fetoscopy came with the introduction of transabdominal first trimester fine needle aspiration of chorionic villi(CVS) by Steen Smidt-Jensen and Hahnemann in 1984 (Smidt-Jensen et al., 1984), a technique which has been adopted universally for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic and karyotype defects.\n\nFetal Therapy: The treatment of severe rhesus disease in the fetus by intraperitoneal transfusion under x-ray guidance was pioneered by Lilley in 1959. Hansmann in 1968 used the Vidoson’s “real time” capability to simplify the technique into an ultrasound guided procedure (Hansmann and Lang, 1971). Access to the fetal circulation however prompted the development of therapeutic procedures firstly by fetoscopy (Rodeck et al., 1981) and then by cordocentesis such as fetal blood transfusion in severe rhesus disease (Nicolaides et al., 1986) and platelet transfusion for alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Ultrasound controlled needling procedures were also used to insert shunts to decompress obstructions in the urinary tract and cerebral ventricles or to drain fluid from pleural effusions but none of these procedures were found to significantly improve outcome and in the case of ventriculomegaly, the condition was frequently made worse. Two prenatal surgical procedures that have been shown to be useful involve the combined use of ultrasound and fetoscopy. In 1995 Yves Ville and Nicolaides from King’s College in London demonstrated the effectiveness of laser ablation to the communicating placental vessels in the treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (Ville et al., 1992) and this technique has been shown to be superior to therapeutic amniocentesis in terms of fetal survival. In 1998 Harrison’s group in San Francisco described occlusion of the fetal trachea by ultrasound guided fetoscopic surgery for the treatment of severe diaphragmatic hernia and subsequently Jan Deprest in Leuven, Eduard Gratacos in Barcelona and Kypros Nicolaides in London described temporary endoscopic balloon occlusion for this condition resulting in a significant improvement in outcome."
