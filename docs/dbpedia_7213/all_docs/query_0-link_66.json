        "text": "Spencer Bogle, Director of Program\n\nI have a passion for developing relational models of justice and charity around one of the common necessities for human life: water. No life exists without water. Clean water access and distribution is a currency that reveals the basic tenets of political and economic systems. As a currency that all people need to survive, it reveals the areas where our global economies succeed and fail at affirming human dignity and value.\n\nMy desire to join the ranks of those working to eliminate the global water crisis began in Kirongo village in the Busoga region of Uganda in 2005. At the time, I was working with a network of churches in the region. While staying with one of the ministers of the local church for a week of learning, teaching, and training, I witnessed firsthand the burden of clean water access for the millions in East Africa who lack it. My gracious host would wake at 5 am each morning, load up 20-liter jerry cans to his bike, travel to the closest protected water point, wait in line, fill the containers, fasten them back to the bike, and then start the journey back to his home with a day’s worth of water for his family. The entire process took almost two hours. Every. Day.\n\nAt the time I was no stranger to the challenges of water access in Uganda. My wife is a nurse and was working in community health at the time. We often heard that clean water access provided the quickest route to improved health for rural communities in Uganda. However, seeing and experiencing the challenges moved me to action. Our team collected some non-earmarked funds and contracted a driller to install a well in the village. My communication with the drilling company was impeccable, and my communication with the community was disastrous.\n\nI perceived the problem as a water access problem and sought to solve it through a unilateral agreement with the landowner near the church property where the well was to be installed. I failed to work through the existing local structures and I failed to negotiate clear lines of ownership and responsibility. Within six months the well was broken and the community was frustrated. Unfortunately, this is the case even today with up to 40% of boreholes in sub-Saharan Africa - hardware installed but not maintained. Fortunately, it is the beginning and not the end of my story.\n\nI consulted a local Ugandan led water development team that had been working in the Busoga region for over twenty years. This team introduced me to a regionally focused strategic sustainable water development plan that established clear lines of ownership and responsibility, and also educated community members on sources of contamination from collection at a public water point to consumption. What I initially perceived as a simple issue of water access I came to understand as a complex network of relationships involving ownership, responsibility, and investment. I witnessed the power of local leaders who had developed a systems-level intervention that included coordination with village leaders and committees, local government officials, and other regional NGOs.\n\nThis experience set me on a journey of inquiry, research, problem-solving, team building, collaboration, reporting, and advocacy that has spanned over 15 years, two organizations, and a doctoral degree. The destination of this journey, however, has never been a degree or a position, but reliable water access for more of the 2.2 billion people that lack safely managed water. My experience and education have taught me that the politics of ownership, decision making, and responsibility necessary to access clean water and sanitation on a community level extend to global networks of power. Water is a defining mark of relationship, and the nature of relationship is revealed by who benefits as water is shared, sold, or redirected.\n\nMy doctoral research takes a hard look at the power dynamics at the heart of developing relationships. I believe that the Christian tradition holds important resources for defining human development, particularly through the way we work charity and justice marked by mutual flourishing in contrast to an imperial desire marked by domination. My research has informed my method. I believe in beginning with specific, verifiable threats to human flourishing, and developing networks of relationships built on a common vision that benefits all involved by addressing specific problems in specific contexts. In other words, a community where people are gathering water from an unprotected spring is a perfect place to start.\n\nFrom the perspective of the thirsty, the most charitable action is one that restores broken relationships and systems fractured from mistrust due to human disregard, devaluation, and domination.\n\nI have seen the impacts of the water crisis while walking with friends to gather a day’s worth of water in Uganda, and also while coordinating with leaders as the director of a global organization. My concern is that, on a large scale, the water is not trickling down to those who need it most as planned. My concern is that the needle on our metrics identifying those who continue to lack access to clean water and sanitation resources is not moving according to the timelines and benchmarks that have been set. We still have work to do in identifying and addressing root causes of the crisis. However, I continue to find hope in the progress we are seeing when we start small- with names and faces of community members, school administrators, and students, and as we build networks that include health and government officials, other NGOs with common vision, and people around the world with a passion for sharing good news in the form of a glass of clean water. My hope swells because of the data we are seeing in the areas where we work and because of the testimonies we hear from schools, communities, and local leaders. The results we are seeing drive me to seek where the following questions might lead.\n\nWhat happens when we reconceive the power structures, the economy, and justice and charity starting with the interests of thirsty? What happens when a Western organization looks to the expertise of leaders in Kenya, Uganda, and Sierra Leone to build networks of water access? What happens when those closest to the problem, those experiencing the greatest thirst, and those facing the greatest challenges from preventable sickness, are the ones who speak into the goals, the parameters, the timelines, and the cultural desires? What happens when Western partners acknowledge the history of political and economic domination and live into an alternative of trust built on verifiable and reliable work, communication, compassion, and partnership?\n\nI am both grateful and excited to be a part of The Water Project - a network of people from all around the globe seeking the answers to some of these questions that push against top-down power dynamics within the WASH sector. My work at The Water Project involves co-developing program strategies, monitoring surveys, and maintenance models with local partners who are in turn coordinating with community and school leadership, local government agents, and other organizations with a common vision. We continue to build a network where success is measured not by project numbers, but by people who can rely on verifiable sustainable access to clean water for years to come.\n\nIn other words, success is measured by a charitable and just redirection of reliable clean water for the thirsty.\n\nTom Murphy, Reporting Officer\n\nGrowing up, my general disposition as a skeptic led teachers to call me the “Devil’s Advocate” for asking so many questions and challenging what I was being taught. Ironically, I owe Jesuit priests and the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur (SNDN) for contributing to decisions that led me to eventually joining The Water Project.\n\nI’ve long been drawn to issues of social justice. Specifically, I found myself concerned about what is needed to create a more equitable society. So when I started to learn about Liberation Theology as a student at the College of the Holy Cross I finally found an ethic that made sense - the preferential option for the poor. Here were people living out a belief system that strove to challenge existing power structures that prevented people from escaping poverty.\n\nAt the end of my senior year in college, I took part in an immersion trip to Mexico. The experience was heavily influenced by the idea of Liberation Theology and involved conversations about the very leaders who contributed to its formation while coming to understand the dynamics of poverty and power in Mexico.\n\nCrucially, the trip was not about action. We did not build a new school or hand out books to children, we spoke with families and learned about their experiences. We heard from Mexican activists and local leaders about the country and their efforts to enable a more just country. The experience taught me the importance of taking a step back to hear from and support the people who live the challenges of poverty. And it forced me to think of the problem of global poverty as one where the solutions lie within communities, not me.\n\nAt the time I was focused on domestic issues. I thought that the most effective way to influence change was through U.S. politics. Specifically, I had the desire to become the chief of staff to a Senator figuring that it would be the best way to advance policy in the deliberative body of Congress without having to run for office. The experience in Mexico and my year working as a teacher in a school in New Haven, Connecticut impressed upon me the need to move away from politics to enable lasting change.\n\nThe program that brought me to Connecticut was run by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur who also happened to run a small international program. I felt the pull to go abroad in the wake of my time in Mexico, so I applied and was accepted into the SNDN program in Kenya. For a year I worked to support a small physical therapy center for children with disabilities in Malava, Kenya.\n\nBlogging became a way for me to stay connected with people at home while I was away and the small hobby eventually turned into a job opportunity as I came back to the U.S. That transitioned into working as a journalist covering the international development sector. Water was one of the areas that interested me most, notably the fact that so many water points are abandoned. I investigated the problem of broken wells in Tanzania and found that a lack of support for ongoing maintenance left communities without the ability to fix breakdowns.\n\nHowever, over time I found that news reporting on issues abroad, while important, actually has little impact relative to the organizations and groups working directly on issues to alleviate poverty.\n\nAt this point, I was living in New Hampshire with my family and learned about The Water Project - an organization that aligns with my values to work directly with communities to solve one of the problems that contribute to poverty. The data-driven work answers my skeptical tendencies that led to my designation as the “Devil’s Advocate” at a young age. And, as it turns out, the majority of The Water Project’s work is in the very region where I once lived.\n\nSo, 10 years after living in Western Kenya I am back working to support the communities I came to know. When our team travels to Kakamega, they stay at the very same hotel where I used to take the 45-minute public bus (matatu) to use the pool. And the values of The Water Project bring me full circle in my long journey to serve in a capacity that fulfills the idea of a preferential option for the poor. I now get to work for an organization that makes decisions in support of communities, not for them. The success of every water point is reliant upon local experts and skilled workers in the countries where we work. This service-oriented approach aligns with the lessons I learned in Mexico and as a journalist.\n\n\"But the poor person does not exist as an inescapable fact of destiny. His or her existence is not politically neutral, and it is not ethically innocent. The poor are a by-product of the system in which we live and for which we are responsible. They are marginalized by our social and cultural world. They are the oppressed, exploited proletariat, robbed of the fruit of their labor and despoiled of their humanity. Hence the poverty of the poor is not a call to generous relief action, but a demand that we go and build a different social order.\" - Gustavo Gutierrez, The Power of the Poor in History\n\nShannon Esrich, Program Officer\n\nI believe my professional work can and should result in service to the community, whether locally or globally. Within the Program Department, I focus on supporting our teams in Western Kenya. I strive to ensure every project page is full of useful, accurate, and engaging information while monitoring water points from proposal to completion and beyond. I am driven by the power of stories and images to help people find their similarities and appreciate their differences from others while creating a shared sense of humanity.\n\nI joined The Water Project in 2019, moving myself and my little orange cat from Vermont to New Hampshire to join the team. In Vermont, I had taken up several roles serving my community in different capacities. Most recently, I was working as a nonpartisan staff member for the House of Representatives in the Vermont State House. There I learned the science and art of compromise, listening, and upholding the highest standards of professionalism regardless of the situation or person in front of me. Seeing how complex and lengthy it was to create change through law also gave me a greater appreciation for the energy required of anyone fighting for change within their community.\n\nBefore the State House, I worked with a nonprofit teaching culinary skills to women with barriers to employment, and then directing a summer camp for youth who identifed as girls or non-binary gender identities. At camp, our all-women staff taught carpentry, welding, and personal and emotional development skills as a way of expanding campers’ horizons beyond typical gender roles and expectations. Though we knew the world did not change overnight for our program participants just because they had gained a new perspective or skill, we often saw how they not just changed but chose their futures because of what they learned.\n\nMy most pivotal experience in international development came after I earned my Bachelor’s in Anthropology and my Master’s in Food Systems from the University of Vermont. Following graduate school, I moved to Senegal in West Africa to serve in the Peace Corps as a Sustainable Agriculture Specialist and spend time serving my global, rather than local, community.\n\nOverseas, my host village and I lived through the daily challenges of accessing enough clean water for our basic needs. This experience was the first for me where water took an equally center stage as food and agriculture.\n\nWhether we were planning crops around the ever-lengthening dry season, or strategically deciding which day to do laundry and how much water to drink, everything centered on our access to water from 4 boreholes spread out around the village. When the boreholes broke down, we were often without a clear path forward for repairs, leaving critical water points unusable for months on end and forcing hundreds of people to crowd at the other water sources still in use. The cycle continued around the village; there was almost never a time when everyone could choose to go to the water point closest to their home.\n\nMy experience in Peace Corps instilled in me a deep sense of compassion for the 1 in 9 people around the world who do not have access to safe, clean, and reliable water.\n\nAs a systems thinker, I understand systemic change is never easy or quick. On a global scale, I know the process for reform is even harder and longer than changing local or state systems, but that it is always worth the energy precisely because of its possibility to change more lives. That is precisely why I fell in love with the challenges and rewards of development work.\n\nI am excited to be once again working with communities in Sub-Saharan Africa while focusing on one of the primary inputs at the heart of not just agriculture, but life itself: water.\n\nWithin the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector, I am particularly passionate about the doors clean water opens for women and girls. Improving access to clean water can help keep girls in school by providing options for safe and dignified menstrual hygiene management. It can mean the difference between a girl staying home and completing her education, leading to a future of choice and agency.\n\nI believe no topic is off the table for discussion when it comes to increasing societal fluency in all matters menstrual hygiene, gender equity, and racial and social justice. I, too, have many questions and a lot to learn.\n\nAn avid outdoor adventurer, plant nerd, and bookworm, I happily fill my downtime with anything that keeps me outside, my brain learning, and my hands busy.\n\nDan Kim, Director of Finance and Operations\n\nThe first 15 years of my career was spent in consulting and technology, not because I loved it, but more because I was chasing startups in the hopes of hitting a big IPO - well, that never came. In 2011, I had what I called an early mid-life crisis where I stopped and wondered what the point of it all was. Why was I just working to help companies make more money? Is this what I wanted to do for the rest of my life? That was the first time the world of non-profits entered my mind - the first time the notion of working to help other people seemed like something I should consider.\n\nBut where would I start? I had no experience in non-profits. Through a family friend, I basically got a crash course - I was introduced to various people working in different sectors, had many conversations, and read several books. At the time, I think because I was coming out of a business/startup environment, microfinance piqued my interest. The thought that something as simple as providing small loans (e.g. $50-$100) to entrepreneurial people could change the trajectory of their lives was amazing. I went all in, leaving the financially comfortable world of technology to jump into a 3-person non-profit helping the materially poor in South Sudan. It was work that was all-new, satisfying, challenging, draining, and relational - an experience that stretched me in incredible ways.\n\nFast forward a few years - now having gained a little more understanding of the lay of the land and learned more about other sectors, I knew there was a lot of good work being done, but personally I had become convinced that clean water was mission critical. For example, while microfinance, and in particular microcredit, is something that certainly helps downstream, if the person doesn't have clean water, then they don't even have the opportunity to think about a business - they're just trying to survive.\n\nEnter The Water Project. One casual conversation with Peter led to several others, and after a year of discussions, I finally had the opportunity to join the team. Knowing that we’re not in it to pump up flashy numbers of new wells dug and millions of people served, but instead that we’re here for the long haul, ensuring that every water point we service is measurable, working and sustainable, and that no community is left behind - that’s the difference maker. It has been a windy road to get to this point, but to feel like I’m exactly where I should be and to be able to use my skills in some small way to help further that mission sure makes it all worth it.\n\nTess Crick, Director of Development\n\nMy first time in Africa changed me. I was standing in the backyard of a mud-sided home in Rwanda, watching a group of men building a place to house chickens when I saw him. A young boy about the age of 8 who was playing with a hand-made invention made of a stick, a few banana leaves, and four round plastic disks that used to be trash. This boy made a toy car of sorts, and he was commanding it with the long stick, pushing it here and there with delight. I thought, “this boy is an engineer in the making!”.\n\nHe was creative, innovative, and could be an incredible asset to his community and country. He oozed with potential. My next thought was, “I wonder if he’ll be able to stay in school and ever realize what’s within him?”\n\nThe mental image of the little boy stayed with me long after leaving Rwanda, and I think of him often. I think about the human potential that lies within each of us that, if the circumstances are right, gets to grow and flourish. I think about what it takes for those circumstances to happen. Children need health, education, good food and water, and a stable environment in which to grow.\n\nThat trip to Rwanda I also saw where children like this boy got water. Water was collected from drainage pipes under roads, from muddy streams, and more rarely, from a well or other improved water source.\n\nUntil a few months before my trip to Rwanda I had never heard of the water crisis. I always had water and so did those around me, and I naively assumed everyone else did. It was a shock to learn that so many women and children, particularly girls, spend hours and hours each day searching for water, and it wasn’t always clean. Something shifted in me, and I knew I had to get involved. I started raising money with the help of my community of faith and friends. We raised a few thousand dollars to help. I began volunteering at local events to tell others about the water crisis, and to invite them to act, to give, to show their care.\n\nIt is so much more than access to clean water. It’s about human dignity, about common respect, and the opportunity to thrive and flourish. In late 2010 I met Peter, our Founder. It was amazing to hear how The Water Project started, and to see the opportunity there was to show donors how their support was helping specific communities. Up to this point in my life, my profession was primarily in the software field implementing enterprise systems as a Consultant and Project Manager. I have also owned my own business and spent a few years in non-profits development and advocacy work. But I knew that lack of clean water was going to be a cause that I would devote more and more of my time to. Peter gave me that opportunity at the start of 2011 to come on full time with The Water Project, a move I gladly accepted. I’ve never looked back.\n\nYou may have guessed from my role at TWP that I work with donors. It’s an incredible gift to take calls from people who are passionate about making a difference in the world. I never tire of listening to the goals people have for their giving, and how they want to put their hard-earned money to work in a way that transforms lives. I love showing them how they can see the results of their giving, that their generosity doesn’t end up in a big black hole with no recognizable impact ... It actually helps real people with names and families and life stories and hopes and dreams. You get to see the results of your giving here at TWP. I love that, and I think you will too.\n\nWe think transparency and relationships are vital to the work we do; both with our donors and with the families we serve every day.\n\nConsider joining us in this life-giving work, won’t you? We need people like you who care and express that through action, through radical generosity. I look forward to meeting you!"
