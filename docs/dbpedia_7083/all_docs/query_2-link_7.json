        "text": "I work for an international company. We all communicate in English although for most of us English isn't our native language. As far as I know we are all expected to speak English to work at the company.\n\nThere's this HR business partner I have to cooperate with, who I simply don't understand and who apparently doesn't understand me. She's assigned to my team, I can't simply chose not to cooperate with her.\n\nI devote plenty of time to decode her written English. She uses English words but it reads like English translated via an online translator - the words make sense, I can't understand the sentences.\n\nI first thought she simply doesn't devote enough attention to her emails, but when I asked her to connect via Skype it became clear her English skills are very limited. She didn't understand most of my questions and tried guessing. She was wrong with most of her guesses. I tried repeating questions several times and rephrasing but it didn't help either. I would think her English is about A2-B1 level, not more than that.\n\nAll the other people I've met at the company speak fluent English. I communicate in English with most of my colleagues, including my managers. I haven't experienced any problems with being understood/ understanding others before. I normally try to rephrase things a lot during discussions anyway in order to make sure we are on the same page and not just assume so. But the situation with this colleague is different. She simply lacks the necessary English skills.\n\nWhat should I do given that I'm new and don't want to cause problems, but any cooperation with her is very difficult?\n\nI don't speak her native language.\n\nI would avoid asking their colleagues to translate it. That would be rude.\n\nI would also avoid translating it yourself. If the translation is poor, they cannot get help from their local colleagues. It is far better to stick to a single language.\n\nIf you have a HR business partner who cannot communicate with your team, that is a fundamental issue. Surely other HR Business Partners are available? If you can't raise this with your boss, you should raise it with the HR Business Partner if possible. Give them a chance to flag it to their boss, and they lose less face. Then you can raise it with their boss if the issue does not get resolved.\n\nIf you need to continue working with this person, things you can do:\n\nAs much as possible, use written communication\n\nUse simple English, not English that utilises an inordinate degree of complexity for no alternative reason other than to attempt demonstrate a point (for instance)\n\nKeep sentences short. Avoid conjunctions.\n\nUse lists because they:\n\nClearly separate different items\n\nMake it easier to translate\n\nAre less daunting compared to walls of text\n\nAvoid sarcasm and humour\n\nIt also helps to appreciate that they are probably feeling even more under pressure to communicate than you.\n\nanswered May 24, 2020 at 6:17\n\nGregory CurrieGregory Currie\n\n60.4k2727 gold badges160160 silver badges227227 bronze badges"
