        "text": "English language provision in the private sector is increasingly competitive. There are ongoing challenges with making your program stand out, but maintaining your margins. Students have so much choice when it comes to English language courses, so how can you differentiate your offer?\n\nAdd Value, Simply\n\nAn effective digital learning program is one clear, simple way to set yourself apart from your competitors. When used creatively, it can even bring new revenue streams by reaching students online that may not be able to join you face-to-face.\n\nReallyenglish provide a world-class, flexible digital program that can help your learners use their time efficiently and deliver better learning outcomes. Our materials can be used purely for self-study, or in tandem with teacher-led instruction. When used to complement a face-to-face, or Skype-type lesson, they provide a solid foundation for receptive skills work, increased vocabulary range and accuracy – leaving more time for teachers to focus on productive skills. Use our complementary blended lessons alongside, and you’ll find your teachers save time, and money on resources.\n\nYour Brand, Your Way\n\nWe also offer custom branding. We recognize that your brand matters, especially when you are building sales and repeat business. Having a digital program that is fully branded to your organization will help support your growth, and keep you ahead of your competitors in the changing landscape of digital delivery.\n\nYou can use our digital solution to attract students to your program by providing access at the time of booking or pre-arrival; as a complement to your core program; or as a post-course incentive. You may include access in your course fees, or charge at a premium. Our flexible delivery means you can add digital in the way that suits your school best.\n\nChoices for everyone - anytime, anywhere\n\nOur material choices for private language school settings are wide and varied. We provide General English from A1 – C1, Business English, Academic English, IELTS, TOEIC and Vocabulary (General and Specialist). This gives you the flexibility to cater for a range of student needs and groups. All of our materials are developed by an experienced team of content writers and editors with real life classroom experience which ensures that every learner makes progress by following engaging, structured lessons that are levelled to the CEFR.\n\nMobile delivery is crucial. Today more than 80% of our learners access course materials on a mobile device. This is where our digital delivery expertise comes in. All of our materials are accessible across devices meaning students can study, pause and pick up where they left off, whenever they want.\n\nHow you choose to structure your digital offer is up to you, but we make it easy to implement and affordable - so you can focus on what you do best."
