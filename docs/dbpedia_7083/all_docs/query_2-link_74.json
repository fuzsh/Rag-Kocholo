        "text": "This checklist may help you to communicate with visitors from overseas.\n\n1. Adjust how you speak\n\nFace-to-face staff should be trained to speak more slowly and distinctly and with more frequent pauses when addressing people who do not have English as their first language. Even if people are native English speakers, the regional accents of Northern Ireland may be unfamiliar.\n\n2. Beware of assumed knowledge\n\nGive explanations of Northern Irelandâ€™s geography and history, keeping them as simple as possible. Use maps to show the locations of places that you refer to.\n\n3. Give international context\n\nWhere possible include reference to other countries, especially the ones that your visitors are from.\n\n4. Give a multilingual welcome\n\nBeing able to greet visitors in their own languages makes a powerful welcoming and hospitable impact.\n\n5. Simplify your narrative\n\nVisitors who are not native English speakers will find it easier to understand familiar words and short sentences with pauses between them. Avoid or explain colloquialisms.\n\n6. Provide written words\n\nReading a foreign language is often easier than listening to it. Short texts, either in print or digital form, in frequently used English words and simply constructed sentences, can help people who are not completely fluent in English.\n\n7. Translate key information\n\nProviding translations into other languages can demonstrate your commitment and care for non-English speakers and add enormously to their experience.\n\n8. Communicate visually\n\nImages and objects enrich the experience and simplify explanations for everyone and are especially helpful for people with limited English.\n\n9. Work with your group\n\nOne member of a group of non-English speakers is often more fluent and can act as interpreter. A guide should adapt to allow time for this, including in question-and-answer sessions.\n\nDC Tours - History of Terror Tour"
