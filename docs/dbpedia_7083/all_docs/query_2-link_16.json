        "text": "For many people, speaking is their preferred way of communicating. It might be fast or easy for them to use and understand.\n\nWhen speaking seems easy, we might not realise how complex it is!\n\nSpeaking starts with breathing out to make sound with our voice. Then we make speech sounds with our mouth. We combine all these speech sounds to say words and sentences. We speak words in a fluent rhythm that helps with meaning. Importantly, speaking also involves using social skills like knowing when to speak, when to be quiet, how to interrupt, and so much more. Listening and understanding are just as complex!\n\nMeet some people who communicate by speaking, but have experienced changes in one of these areas.\n\nCommunication is more than speaking\n\nBut speaking is not everyoneâ€™s preferred way to communicate. Many people use some speaking combined with another way to communicate, like a symbol book. Others use something instead of speaking, like a speech-generating device.\n\nCommunication is always more than words and more than speaking. There are many ways to communicate that donâ€™t involve speaking at all!\n\nIt doesnâ€™t really matter which way we communicate. What matters is exchanging meaning with each other, so the message gets through.\n\nAll ways of communicating are valid.\n\nWe often combine different ways of communicating at the same time. This is sometimes called multi-modal communication. (Mode is another word for way.)\n\nWe are all â€˜multi-modalâ€™ communicators!\n\nMulti-modal communication can look like:\n\nusing gestures and facial expressions when we are speaking\n\nadding emojis ðŸ˜Š GIFS or symbols into our written messages\n\npointing to objects, photos or images of things we want while speaking\n\nsmiling and nodding and making eye contact when we are listening\n\nmaking sounds that are not words, e.g. hmm or eek\n\npointing to things around us in the context to make the meaning clearer\n\ndoing specific actions (behaviour) known to others, e.g. holding up a credit card to show you want to buy food\n\nspeaking into a text output device on a phone which then sends a written message\n\ntyping into a speech generating device to create a spoken message for others.\n\nFor some people, multi-modal communication is essential. If speaking is not a person's preferred way to communicate, they can use additional ways to communicate."
