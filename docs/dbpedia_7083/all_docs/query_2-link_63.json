        "text": "by Londell Buckson\n\nPlain language is as important in spoken communication as it is in writing. When speaking to a group, follow these guidelines:\n\nKnow your audience\n\nYou know your agenda as the speaker. Consider what your audience hopes to gain from listening to you. You must tailor your speech to your audience.\n\nStructure your message\n\nAll speeches require an introduction, body, and conclusion. Think of these sections as your beginning, middle, and end.\n\nCapture your audience with an introduction in which you relate your upcoming message to a current event, say a famous quotation, tell a story, or share a shocking statistic. Use a conclusion that your audience will remember.\n\nSpeak in active voice\n\nWhen the subject of a verb does something (acts), the verb is in the active voice. When the subject of a verb receives the action (is acted upon), the verb is in the passive voice.\n\nActive voice emphasizes the doer of an action. It is briefer, clearer, and more emphatic than passive voice.\n\nKeep it short\n\nIt’s easier for your audience to understand your message when you communicate in short, simple sentences.\n\nKeep your entire message short if you don’t have to stay within a given time frame. Your audience will better appreciate and remember your message if you get it across quickly and effectively.\n\nConsider your language\n\nAvoid offensive language such as racial slurs and curse words.\n\nDefine words or terms that may be new to your audience. Sometimes, you’ll need to define a word the audience uses so frequently that they may not understand the true definition.\n\nSpell out an acronym the first time you say it.\n\nIncorporate literary devices. Use a simile or metaphor to compare a concept the audience may not understand to something they do understand. Similes are like spices, adding flavor to your speech. Use repetition to emphasize important points.\n\nUse personal pronouns\n\nAddressing your listeners with words like you, we, and our makes it easier for them to picture themselves in your message.\n\nAvoid filler\n\nDon’t fill pauses with words and phrases like um, ah, OK, you know, and things of that nature. They can ruin even the most carefully crafted speech.\n\nAvoid “shall”\n\nShall is an ambiguous word. Instead, use must, ought, or will.\n\nAudiovisual aids\n\nTelevision and movies have raised the bar for what excites audiences. We have grown accustomed to processing verbal messages connected with images. An audiovisual aid can help keep your audience engaged. Consider using a chart, poster, picture, PowerPoint presentation, or a combination.\n\nEnsure everyone in the audience will be able to see or hear your aid. If you use PowerPoint or another electronic audiovisual aid, have a backup plan in case the equipment stops working right before or during your speech.\n\nTest your speech\n\nPracticing on your own isn’t enough. Grab a co-worker or two on which to practice your speech. Tell them the purpose of the speech.\n\nHave your practice listeners time your speech and take notes on their reactions. Use their feedback to improve your message."
