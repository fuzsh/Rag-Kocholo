        "text": "Something to chew on - The English We Speak - YouTube\n\nFeifei: Hello and welcome to The English\n\nWe Speak. I'm Feifei.\n\nNeil: And I'm Neil.\n\nFeifei: Hey Neil, would you like to try\n\none of my homemade cookies?\n\nNeil: Well, we shouldn't really eat while\n\nwe're presenting but... go on then...\n\nFeifei: I made them last night and I\n\nthought I'd try them out on you! You've got\n\na sweet tooth so I know you can't resist!\n\nNeil: OK then... Mmmm.\n\nFeifei: Well, what do you think?\n\nNeil: Well, they're... OK. Perhaps not the\n\nbest I've ever had.\n\nFeifei: Oh, so you think my cooking\n\nisn't great?\n\nNeil: Let's say it's something to chew on.\n\nFeifei: Right! So you're saying my\n\nhomemade cookies are chewy?\n\nNeil: No, I'm not. In fact they're... crunchy.\n\nBut when someone says they need to\n\nchew on something, it's an informal way\n\nto say they need to think about it\n\nbefore making a decision.\n\nFeifei: Well, Neil, I will chew on response\n\nto your insult about my cooking while we\n\nhear some examples...\n\nOur extension plans are great but we\n\nneed to chew on it before we give them\n\nthe go-ahead.\n\nHmm, it's very expensive to fly to\n\nAustralia for a holiday.\n\nLet's chew on it shall we?\n\nMy boyfriend asked me to marry him and\n\nI said I'd chew on it.\n\nHe didn't seem that pleased!\n\nFeifei: This is The English We Speak and\n\nNeil has been using the expression\n\n'to chew on something' or\n\n'something to chew on' which\n\nmeans to think about something before\n\nmaking a decision. And Neil, I've made\n\na decision about what to say to you!\n\nNeil: Oh yes?\n\nFeifei: If you don't like my cooking,\n\nI will not be inviting you to\n\nmy dinner party tonight.\n\nNeil: Oh Feifei! Ah well, at least\n\nI'll avoid your cooking.\n\nFeifei: I'm not cooking. We're getting\n\na takeaway curry and lots of wine.\n\nI suppose you could\n\ncome... if you pay for the take away?\n\nNeil: Hmm that is something I don't need\n\nto chew on. The answer's 'no' - I'll stay at\n\nhome and... bake my own cookies!\n\nSee ya.\n\nFeifei: Bye."
