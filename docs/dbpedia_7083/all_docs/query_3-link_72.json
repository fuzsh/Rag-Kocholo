        "text": "Sami refers to a group of similar ancient languages spoken by the Sami, the indigenous people of Norway. It’s an official language, but you probably won’t have much contact with it unless you’re studying in somewhere like Tromso, Longyearbyen or Kirkenes.\n\nAs is the case across Scandinavia, English is widely spoken in Norway. It may be their second language, but many Norwegians speak it like natives.\n\nWhen Norwegians aren’t impressing you with their English skills, they’ll want to show you their country’s incredible nature, something which Norway is renowned for.\n\nThe Norwegian Fjords are known for their sharp cliffs, sweeping mountains and crystal blue waters. They run from Bergen all the way up to the border with Russia, meaning that you’re probably never too far from a fjord. Away from the coast, Norway is also covered in dense pine and spruce forests, for those who enjoy woodland.\n\nNorwegian winters can be harsh, with heavy rain, snow and ice. Be sure that you have a sturdy umbrella, a thick, warm winter coat and a good pair of snow boots. Svalbard and parts of mainland Norway also have polar days and nights. This means that you can enjoy the midnight sun in June, but you won’t see any daylight in December. The seemingly endless summers more than make up for the winters.\n\nFor LGBT students, Norway is an extremely welcoming place. Pride events take place across the country each summer. Norway was the first country in the world to enact anti-discrimination legislation and same-sex marriage has been legal since 2009.\n\nAs for crime, the rate is low in Norway, although pickpocketing can occur in the Grünerløkka district of Oslo. The risk of terrorism is also low in Norway, adding to its safety."
