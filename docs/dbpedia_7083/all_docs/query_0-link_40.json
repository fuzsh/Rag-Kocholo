        "text": "We use ’s after a singular noun and ’ after a plural noun.\n\nWe use ’s with irregular plural nouns (e.g. children, men, people, women):\n\nThe children’s parents decided which university they would go to.\n\nThey have no respect for other people’s property.\n\nThe rules for the pronunciation of a noun with ’s are the same as the rules for pronunciation of plural forms of nouns.\n\nWhen a first or second name ends in -s, we can either add ’ or ’s. It is more common to use ’ than ’s. When we speak, we usually pronounce the final part of the word as /zɪz/ or /sɪz/:\n\nIs that James’ car? (or Is that James’s car?) (both usually pronounced /ˈdʒeɪmzɪz/)\n\nI love Keats’ poetry. (or I love Keats’s poetry.) (both usually pronounced /ˈki:tsɪz/)\n\nWith compound nouns, we add ’s to the final noun:\n\nMy sister-in-law’s friend came with us.\n\nNot: My sister’s-in-law friend\n\nWe don’t usually use the possessive ’s with things:\n\nthe door handle\n\nNot: the door’s handle\n\nthe shop window\n\nNot: the shop’s window\n\nthe kitchen table\n\nNot: the kitchen’s table\n\nIn short answers, we can omit the noun if it is not necessary to repeat it:\n\nA:\n\nIs that your coat?\n\nB:\n\nNo, it’s Sandra’s.\n\nWe use possessive ’s with words such as one, anyone, someone, anybody, somebody:\n\nIt’s important to know one’s rights as a tenant.\n\nIs this someone’s coat here?\n\nWhen we use else with these words, the ’s is added to else:"
