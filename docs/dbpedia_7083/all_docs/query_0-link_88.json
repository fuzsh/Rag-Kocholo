We’ll show you the dorms, dining halls, studios, and more in a journey that’s both immersive and informative.\n\nWho is a Transfer Applicant?\n\nIf you have attended a university or college full time (twelve semester hours or the equivalent) for at least one semester or term or will do so prior to enrollment, you are considered a transfer student.\n\nIf you have or will accumulate at least twelve semester hours (or the equivalent) after graduating from high school and prior to enrollment, you are also considered a transfer student.\n\nIf you earned college credit while still enrolled in high school (summer school, pre-college programs, advanced placement, dual enrollment between your high school and a university or community college, etc.), you are a freshman applicant.\n\nIf you are currently enrolled in Pratt’s Associate degree program (AAS only) and wish to continue into the BFA, you will also apply as a transfer student. Please find specific information about applying towards the bottom of this page.\n\nIf you are a transfer student, it is important to use the appropriate application. Transfers who apply as freshmen may have their offer of admission rescinded, because of different criteria for acceptance. The applicant will be reconsidered for both admission and a transfer scholarship.\n\nIf you already hold a college degree, we recommend applying as a graduate student. Find our program offerings here, and our graduate application process online.\n\nTransfer Admissions Requirements\n\nApplication form with fee (online)\n\nOfficial transcripts from each high school attended or official GED scores (if less than 48 college credits have been earned or college GPA is below 3.0)\n\nAn unofficial transcript from each college attended\n\nTest Scores (*optional)\n\nOptional letters of recommendation\n\nPratt Essay\n\nEnglish Proficiency Scores\n\nVisual or Writing Portfolio (Not required for Construction Management)\n\nDetailed descriptions of each material can be found below.\n\nPratt asks that materials are uploaded to the online application whenever possible.

International students are not eligible based on financial hardship. Questions about fee waivers can be directed to admissions@pratt.edu.\n\n2. OFFICIAL HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS\n\nA high school diploma or the equivalent is required for enrollment to Pratt Institute’s undergraduate program if at the time of applying less than 48 college credits were earned or the combined college GPA from all institutions attended is below 3.0. Transcripts from all high schools attended are required.\n\nApplicants who have received high school equivalency diplomas are required to have official High School Equivalency Examination (GED) scores sent to the Admissions Office in addition to official transcripts from all high schools attended.\n\nPratt receives documents through Naviance, Parchment, BridgeU, EScript, Scrib, National Student Clearing House, or CIALFO.\n\nInternational applicants must submit official transcripts (academic records) of all secondary school studies as well as any postsecondary studies.

All transcripts must be translated into English.\n\nCredential Evaluations for International Students\n\nWhile we do not require credential evaluations for transfer applicants for their international high school transcripts specifically, Pratt strongly recommends it. These credential evaluations must be completed by a NACES member. Options for evaluation services include Span Tran for Pratt, WES, ECE, IEE, Global Credential Evaluators, or another acceptable service, e.g.: your embassy. Credential evaluations do not typically include translations, so documents must first be officially translated into English by a certified translation service. Pratt asks for a course-by-course evaluation.\n\n3. UNOFFICIAL COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS\n\nUnofficial transcripts should be uploaded when you complete your online application. Official transcripts should later be sent directly to Pratt from each college/university attended if you are admitted and decide to enroll. They may be sent through services like the National Student Clearinghouse or by mail to Pratt’s Office of Admissions. Students who are in their first semester of college and applying for spring should upload their student schedule instead.\n\nRequest an unofficial student copy from your school’s registrar, either digitally or physically, scan it, and upload it. It must have your name and the name of the school on the transcript. An unofficial transcript from each institution attended should be uploaded when you complete the application. If you are admitted and decide to enroll, you will need to send final official transcripts to Pratt Institute.\n\nStudents who have enrolled in other institutions of higher education should upload mid-year transcripts from each college or university showing in progress coursework. Students who have completed a four-year degree and are applying as an undergraduate for another program must submit their final official transcript with the degree and date of degree noted.\n\nStudents attending an institution with a pass/fail, credit/no credit, or similar grading scale must submit an official high school transcript in addition to their college/university transcript(s) with their application regardless of the number of credits earned.\n\nStudents with a college GPA below 3.0, must submit an official high school transcript in addition to their college/university transcript(s) with their application regardless of the number of credits earned.\n\nCredential Evaluations for International StudentsCollege transfer students who have studied outside the US are required to submit a credential evaluation of their transcripts.

While working from photographic reference or from your imagination can offer valuable insights as to your technical and creative skills, the ways in which you used line, value, texture and/or composition to capture real life forms and spaces onto the 2-dimensional picture plane can offer a deeper understanding of your creative problem-solving process. We welcome examples of work done in a range of media, which can include pencil, charcoal, paint, collage, clay, wood, stone, photography and film. Design and computer-generated pieces are also acceptable but please make sure this type of work offers insights as to your own creative process and not just the capabilities of software and programs.

Programs\n\nEntrance to the B.F.A. is for fall only.\n\nStudents in their second year of the associate degree who expect to complete by the end of the spring semester must submit a portfolio and brief application through SlideRoom to Pratt’s admissions office to be confirmed for entrance to the B.F.A.\n\nA cumulative Pratt GPA of 2.7 by the end of the fall semester of the sophomore year is required. Your acceptance is contingent on you maintaining your grades in your final semester and completing the requirements/courses for the degree.\n\nYour submission will be in the “AAS to BFA Transfer Application (CURRENT PRATT STUDENTS ONLY)” folder. You will be required to fill out a brief form and submit five (5) images from your time in the AAS program through SlideRoom.\n\nSee AAS transfer scholarship information.\n\nCurrent AAS students who do not meet the minimum 2.7 GPA require or are changing their major; OR students in the AOS program applying to the BFA: You are required to complete the transfer student application as outlined at the top of this page and will be considered for admission among the general application pool. Please email transadm@pratt.edu to request a fee waiver code for the application or if you have any questions.\n\nStudents in the AAS program who decide to change their major upon entering the BFA or students applying to the BFA from the AOS program will need to take at least an additional year’s worth of coursework to make up the coursework they missed in the sophomore year. Students in the program who wish to change their major in the second year of the program would have to take additional coursework to make up the classes missed in the new major. We do not encourage AAS students to change majors either in the program or after transferring to the BFA because of the additional time needed to make up the sophomore required courses in the new major.\n\nTransfer of Credits\n\nResidency Requirement:\n\nEvery undergraduate must complete at least 50% of credits required for graduation—including the final 30 credits—at Pratt. Credits earned through approved study abroad programs will be considered to be earned in residence.\n\nEvaluation of Credit\n\nTransfer credit is granted for coursework that is comparable to Pratt’s coursework and is completed at a school accredited by an accrediting agency or state approval agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education or the international equivalent. Only courses with a grade of C or better will be considered acceptable for transfer to the Pratt record. Credit will not be awarded for courses with grades lower than C (including C-). Credits may be awarded for courses that meet the following:\n\nCredit evaluations will be completed at the time of acceptance. Accepted students who seek AP, IB, or CLEP credit must submit official copies of score reports to the Admissions Office prior to enrollment.\n\nPrior to the deposit deadline, the transfer student receives a credit evaluation for work done at previous college(s). Additional documents may be requested (bulletin, course hours, syllabi, etc.) in order to complete the evaluation. Final official transcripts are required to ultimately award any credits.\n\nPlacement\n\nIn order to place out of foundation year you must submit a portfolio of work from courses similar to Pratt’s first year program. For example, in Art and Design: to place as a sophomore, you must have taken classes similar to the foundation year curriculum to receive credit, and you must submit work from each studio course taken. To receive credit for the sophomore year, you must include examples from your major if you took major classes that reflect Pratt’s second-year. The curriculum for each major is available online. The level of work in the transfer portfolio in addition to credits in courses taken are used to determine placement (freshman first semester, sophomore second semester, etc.) in Pratt’s programs. Failure to show work from particular classes will affect the level of placement. Pratt has very limited space for transfer applicants, much of which is dependent on placement.\n\nTake a virtual tour\n\nGet to know Pratt from anywhere in the world with our virtual campus tour.
