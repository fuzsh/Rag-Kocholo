        "text": "Grammatical category\n\nSee also: Narrative mode\n\nSeveral terms like \"first person singular\" and \"second-person plural\" redirect here. For other uses, see § Works.\n\nIn linguistics, grammatical person is the grammatical distinction between deictic references to participant(s) in an event; typically, the distinction is between the speaker (first person), the addressee (second person), and others (third person). A language's set of pronouns is typically defined by grammatical person. First person includes the speaker (English: I, we), second person is the person or people spoken to (English: your or you), and third person includes all that are not listed above (English: he, she, it, they).[1] It also frequently affects verbs and sometimes nouns or possessive relationships.\n\nRelated classifications\n\n[edit]\n\nNumber\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Grammatical number\n\nIn Indo-European languages, first-, second-, and third-person pronouns are typically also marked for singular and plural forms, and sometimes dual form as well (grammatical number).\n\nInclusive/exclusive distinction\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Clusivity\n\nSome other languages use different classifying systems, especially in the plural pronouns. One frequently found difference not present in most Indo-European languages is a contrast between inclusive and exclusive \"we\": a distinction of first-person plural pronouns between including or excluding the addressee.[2]\n\nHonorifics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Honorifics (linguistics)\n\nMany languages express person with different morphemes in order to distinguish degrees of formality and informality. A simple honorific system common among European languages is the T–V distinction. Some other languages have much more elaborate systems of formality that go well beyond the T–V distinction, and use many different pronouns and verb forms that express the speaker's relationship with the people they are addressing. Many Malayo-Polynesian languages, such as Javanese and Balinese, are well known for their complex systems of honorifics; Japanese,[3] Korean,[4] and Chinese also have similar systems to a lesser extent.\n\nEffect on verbs\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Grammatical conjugation\n\nIn many languages, the verb takes a form dependent on the person of the subject and whether it is singular or plural. In English, this happens with the verb to be as follows:\n\nI am (first-person singular)\n\nyou are/thou art (second-person singular)\n\nhe, she, one, it is (third-person singular)\n\nwe are (first-person plural)\n\nyou are/ye are (second-person plural)\n\nthey are (third-person plural, and third-person singular)\n\nOther verbs in English take the suffix -s to mark the present tense third person singular, excluding singular 'they'.\n\nIn many languages, such as French, the verb in any given tense takes a different suffix for any of the various combinations of person and number of the subject.\n\nAdditional persons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe grammar of some languages divide the semantic space into more than three persons. The extra categories may be termed fourth person, fifth person, etc. Such terms are not absolute but can refer, depending on context, to any of several phenomena.\n\nSome Algonquian languages and Salishan languages divide the category of third person into two parts: proximate for a more topical third person, and obviative for a less topical third person.[5] The obviative is sometimes called the fourth person. In this manner, Hindi and Bangla may also categorize pronouns in the fourth, and with the latter a fifth person.[clarification needed] [6]\n\nThe term fourth person is also sometimes used for the category of indefinite or generic referents, which work like one in English phrases such as \"one should be prepared\" or people in people say that..., when the grammar treats them differently from ordinary third-person forms.[citation needed] The so-called \"zero person\"[7][8] in Finnish and related languages, in addition to passive voice, may serve to leave the subject-referent open. Zero person subjects are sometimes translated as \"one\", although in tone it is similar to English's generic you \"Ei saa koskettaa\" (\"Not allowed to touch\", \"You should not touch\").\n\nEnglish personal pronouns in the nominative case\n\n[edit]\n\nPronoun Person and number Gender Standard I First-person singular we First-person plural you Second-person singular or second-person plural he Third-person masculine singular masculine she Third-person feminine singular feminine it Third-person neuter (and inanimate) singular neuter they Third-person plural or gender-neutral singular epicene Dialectal me First-person singular, dialectal Caribbean English and colloquial special uses thee Second-person singular, literary, dialectal Yorkshire, and occasional use by Quakers allyuh Second-person plural, many English-based creole languages, dialectal Caribbean English unu Second-person plural, many English-based creole languages, dialectal Caribbean English y'all Second-person plural, dialectal Southern American, Texan English, and African-American English ye Second-person plural, dialectal Hiberno-English and Newfoundland English yinz Second-person plural, Scots, dialectal Scottish English, Pittsburgh English you guys Second-person plural, dialectal American English and Canadian English you(r) lot Second-person plural, dialectal British English yous(e) Second-person plural, Australian English, many urban American dialects like New York City English and Chicago English, as well as Ottawa Valley English.
