        "text": "Do you feel different when speaking English versus when speaking your native language? Discover how to be yourself & communicate authentically regardless of the language you speak 👌\n\n“When I speak English, I feel like another person. Perhaps more reserved or shy or less talkative, to say the least. When I speak my mother tongue, I feel myself and free! Is there something wrong with me?”\n\nKeep calm. There’s nothing wrong with you. It’s almost normal to feel that way because English is NOT your native language.\n\nYou may miss some words, find it hard to express a notion or struggle to understand others.\n\nBut you know what? Even Brits may experience the same things. As a half-Brit, I can verify that. 🤷\n\nAnd then it’s the accents and immense judgement you may receive. Some laugh at it, others joke about it.\n\nWhatever the case, judgement holds you back. And as many of my clients tell me, their accents worsen unconsciously when they receive such comments.\n\nJudgement is bad for speaking authentically. The same goes for that feeling I described at the beginning; holding back when speaking English.\n\n𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀?\n\nThis week, I invited Chiara Capuzzo, a brilliant Email Marketing Specialist living in Switzerland but working with different people & with English as the main communication language, to share her stories.\n\nShe stars in the new episode of my “𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲” 𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗼 𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗸𝘀, where professionals like you share their stories about business English.\n\nChiara has gone through the same 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗹𝗲𝘀 as you, most probably. Curious to find out how she took the lead & transformed her English?\n\nWe talk about\n\n🔸 authentic communication in English\n\n🔸 why she feels like a different person when speaking English at work\n\n🔸 how she steps out of her comfort zone to level up\n\n🔸 judgement & negative comments about her (Italian) accent\n\n🔸 tips for networking events where you have to communicate authentically\n\nThe new video episode is out & it’s a must-watch. It’s short, fun to watch (Chiara is so authentic with her Italian temperament), & you can skip to any point you feel resonates with you the most.\n\nWatch it now below or save it in your Watch Later list for when you’ll have free time later.\n\nIf you haven’t already subscribed to my YouTube channel, please do so 🙏https://bit.ly/ProEnglishVideos\n\nMake sure you hit the Subscribe button + the notification bell next to it, to get notified for my new videos."
