        "text": "From business to Bollywood, India is a country filled with culture, history and alongside all of it - languages.\n\nTravel around India, and youâll hear a multitude of languages and musical dialects. In fact, it may feel like you hear hundreds. You wouldnât be wrong.\n\nSo how many Indian languages are there?Â While India has 22 separate official languages , it is home to a total of 121 languages and 270 mother tongues. Itâs also home to the worldâs oldest language, Hindi.\n\nIndian languages spoken in India\n\nAs the worldâs oldest language, Hindi is, unsurprisingly, the most spoken in India. Melodic and unique, it can be heard across much of North and Central India. Itâs also spoken by 366 million people across the world.\n\nHindi belongs to the Indo Aryan Languages family, which represents the largest of the language families in terms of speakers.\n\nAfter Hindi, the languages most spoken within the family are:\n\nBengali\n\nPunjabi\n\nMarathi\n\nGujarati\n\nRajasthani\n\nBhojpuri\n\nOdia\n\nMaithili\n\nSindhi\n\nNepali\n\nAssamese\n\nChhattisgarhi\n\nSinhala\n\nRomani\n\nWhat is the official language of India?\n\nHindi is the official language of India, with English being the second official language.Â\n\nHowever, there is no national language as per the Constitution.Â\n\nEnglish in India\n\nEnglish is the second language in India, and the reason why stems from history. English was the official language during British rule. When India was granted independence, the language lingered, and time hasnât changed that.\n\nIn fact, India is ranked as the worldâs second-largest English-speaking country after the United States, with over 1 billion people speaking it. English in India is primarily used in business, education, and official documents.\n\nA list of Indian languages\n\nThe Indian constitution recognises 22 official languages. These are:\n\nBengali\n\nHindi\n\nMaithili\n\nNepalese\n\nSanskrit\n\nTamil\n\nUrdu\n\nAssamese\n\nDogri\n\nKannada\n\nGujarati\n\nBodo\n\nManipur (also known as Meitei)\n\nOriya\n\nMarathi\n\nSantali\n\nTelugu\n\nPunjabi\n\nSindhi\n\nMalayalam\n\nKonkani\n\nKashmiri\n\nA family affair\n\nIndian languages belong to either the Indo-Aryan language family (the largest) or the Dravidian language family (the second largest).\n\nThe Indo-Aryan languages are spoken by more than 800 million people and are spoken in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The top languages spoken in terms of the number of speakers are Hindi-Urdu, Bengalis, Punjabi, Marathi, and Gujarati.\n\nDravidian languages are spoken by around 220 million people, living in southern and central India. The primary languages spoken are Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam.\n\nOther interesting Indian language facts\n\nHindi ranks as one of the most spoken languages in the world. Bengali is also one of the most spoken languages in the world.\n\nIndia has no national language. After independence, it became too hard to select one from the thousands spoken.\n\nEnglish has many words of Indian origin including; dungarees, avatar, jungle, tank, shampoo, roti, dinghy, chutney and mongoose.\n\nTelugu is an Indian language which is known as the âItalian of the Eastâ.\n\nHindi got its name from the Persian word Hind, meaning 'land of the Indus River'.\n\nSanskrit, Urdu, Nepalese, Bengali and Gujarati all have some similarities with Hindi, either in spoken language or in the written script.\n\nMalayalam, the language spoken in the southern Indian state of Kerala, is the longest palindrome in the English language\n\nExpand your knowledge of languages\n\nÂ"
