I mean, normally when we say \"lock something\", that something is considered some kind of container or opening, as in lock the car/door. So that makes me wonder if I can I say \"lock the lock\" because after all a lock is not a container or opening. What do I say if I want to convey the idea of inserting the key into the lock, turning the key and making the lock functional?Thank you, Susan, Bruce, and Ben, for your prompt and helpful answers. In terms of English learning, I am, as Ben said, in a vacuum that is divorced from the actual linguistic environment. And italki is by far the closest thing I can get that serves as a way out for me. Therefore, when I say thank you, I am not just saying it; I do mean it. Thanks again, you guys!"
