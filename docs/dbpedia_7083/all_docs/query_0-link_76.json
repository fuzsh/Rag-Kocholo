        "text": "The main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanations, see Auxiliaries and contractions in English). Your email address will be used to notify you when your comment has been reviewed by the moderator and if the article author(s) or moderator should contact you directly. Some contractions lead to homophony, which sometimes leads to spelling mistakes. Confusion is particularly common between his (for “it is/a”) and the possessive pronoun sound, and sometimes similar between you and yours. To confuse have or -`ve with from (as in “would of” for would have), see Weak and strong forms in English. Some contractions in the fast language include ~っす (-ssu) for です (desu) and すいません (suimasen) for すみません (sumimasen). では (dewa) is often contracted in じゃ (yes). In some grammatical contexts, the particle の (no) is contracted in simple ん (n). Some contractions tend to be limited to less formal language and very informal writing, such as John`d or Mary`d for “John/Mary would” (compare the personal pronoun forms I`d and You`d, which are much more likely to be found in relatively informal writings).\n\nThis is especially true for constructions with successive contractions, as would have been the case with “do not happen”. At the turn of the 16th century, the Renaissance came to England and with it came further changes in the language, which at that time is recognizable as the beginning of modern English (1450 AD to 1750 AD). The Latin and Greek words have been adopted and amended (para. B example, militia, misery, illegal and explanatory), and men like Shakespeare introduced new words to the masses at a rapid pace (e.g., assassination. B, cold-blooded, eyeball and fashionable). The definition overlaps with the term portmanteau (a linguistic mixture), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau word and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together one after the other, such as .B. do and not, while a portmanteau word is formed by the combination of two or more existing words, which all refer to a singular concept that describes the portmanteau word. I read letters written around 1650 (and anyone writing during this period will be middle-class or upper-class and well-educated), and they use many contractions: I am, I, we, you, `tis, `twas, `twill, on`t (of this one), t`autre (the other), in`t (inside) and with`t (with). Also does not occur. Latin contains several examples of contractions. Such a case is preserved in the verb nolo (I don`t want/don`t want) formed by a contraction of non volo (volo means “I want”).\n\nSimilarly, this is observed in the first-person plural and third-person plural (nolumus or nolunt) forms. Due to the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use, it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of Standard Norwegian and ocular dialectal writing. It is almost universally true that these spellings attempt to convey how each word is pronounced, but it is rare that one writes a language that does not conform to at least some of the rules of official spelling. The reasons for this are words that are written in a non-phonemic way, ignorance of conventional spelling rules or adaptation for better transcription of the phonemes of this dialect. Are the contractions like they don`t and this is typical of “modern” English? To what extent were they present in modern English? This paper attempts to answer these questions. However, it is also a question of answering another question: early modern English had a number of contractions of its own, and the question is why they have disappeared and whether they are still relevant to contemporary English in one way or another. The history of contractions Use contractions in formal written form when it seems stranger to avoid them than to use them. In fact, there were even contractions before the 1600s, but at that time they were usually not given with an apostrophe, as the apostrophe was still a new invention. contractions of auxiliary, negative and question verbs with is; are used in everyday English by all parts of British society. Although there are some regional variations, the basic principles of contractions and connected language are used by almost everyone all the time.\n\nIn 1837, Charles Dickens` Oliver Twist gave us: don`t, you`ll, he`s, who`s, I`ll, warn`t (were not), can`t, has not, it`s, would`t, mustn`t, have`t, should`t, didn`t, mightn`t, needn`t, ain`t, mayn`t, it`t, it`s, there`ve, you`ve, we`s, that`s, where`s, there`ll, you`d, he`d, shan`t, daren`t (dare not) and a variety of other familiar historical contractions that are used generously throughout the dialogue. ."
