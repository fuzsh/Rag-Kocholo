If you slow down more than is required, or alter your speech too much, your client can feel patronised. On the other hand if you speak at natural speed, using all the same words as usual, it will sound like a bewildering stream of noise. How do you pitch it right?\n\nThe key is to start by listening. Is your conversation partner a slow and hesitant communicator, or are they fast and confident? Match their speed. Letting them guide you in this way is a key skill when it comes to having fruitful conversations despite a language barrier.\n\nWhat if your client can't get a word in in the first place? This is such a common problem, and an easy trap to fall into when one of you is more fluent in a language than the other. You know this is happening when you begin to have the feeling that you’re talking to thin air. You say more and more because no response is forthcoming and if you don’t fill the silence, who will?\n\nIf this sounds familiar to you it may be because you find silences awkward. Of course we all do, sooner or later. But when I’m training staff to communicate better with clients who have English as an Additional Language, I ask them to embrace awkward silences. A silence which feels awkward to you feels like oxygen to your conversation partner. If you can stop talking for longer than seems comfortable, that’s when your client will find the words to speak.\n\nIf you would like to improve at this niche skill, English Unlocked training can make a huge difference. In addition to learning the value of silence, here are some of the other things you will learn-\n\n· How to declutter your speech\n\n· The importance of clear word boundaries\n\n· A more intentional use of facial expressions, gestures and body language\n\n· Why phrasal verbs confuse non native English speakers, and how to spot them.\n\n· The problem with using idioms and metaphors\n\n· How to give your listener the processing time they need\n\n· When to rephrase, and when it's better not to.\n\nIf you would like to book a place on our next webinar, click on the link below.\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/how-to-communicate-with-clients-who-have-english-as-an-additional-language-tickets-136289713201"
