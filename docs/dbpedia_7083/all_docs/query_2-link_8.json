As a staff+ engineer, we say that the plain language of communication for articles, lectures, and other things in the area is English. Not knowing English has disadvantages, and your career is difficult to evolve.\n\nCan a musician dream of a career that transcends borders without knowledge of sheet music? He would find it very difficult. It is standard for technology professionals to have many doubts about the language: is technical English enough? Do I need to speak, or is writing/reading enough? Essential to learn another language besides English?\n\nThis article should make you understand that improving this language can bring you great benefits. And I, as a polyglot, give a lot of tips below.\n\nI study Italian, French, and Spanish besides English and my native Portuguese. Three facts helped me learn other languages: The purpose of a language is to communicate and break barriers. Speaking with an accent is not wrong. Mistakes when communicating are better than not communicating.\n\nIs it possible to learn computing and programming with little or no English? Yes. But advancing to a post-senior area becomes unlikely as it makes assertive contact with the world community impossible and relies on translations to read the latest books on the spot.\n\nReturning to the core of the post, let's go to the answers:\n\nIs technical English enough?\n\nThe primary purpose of a language is communication, so the richer your vocabulary, the greater your ability to communicate. Typically there are conversations in parallel during a conference, among other things. And this is where you miss many opportunities - in the absence of networking which expands your vision, knowledge, and ambitions.\n\nNetworking inside or outside the company is vital for your career, in your current or the next job. Technical English is, therefore, a good step. But it is not enough.\n\nDo I need to speak or write/read?\n\nWe covered this answer in the previous section. Yet it is worth emphasizing that the greater the possibility of articulating, the higher the likelihood of integration with people.\n\nKnowing how to read and write will be enough to read or write articles, but it's not worth much at conferences and communicating with someone who doesn't speak your native language.\n\nHow to improve your English?\n\nIn addition to the more classic paths such as courses and intensives, it is worthwhile to have specialized help and a private teacher like Tom Horner. He works with software engineers to improve fluency in the language.\n\nWant to know what helps me a lot to evolve? Setting goals and targets that can be accomplished within the short or medium term, for example, writing four articles a month or giving a five-minute talk on a particular topic three months from now.\n\nThis method helps me identify the vocabulary I need to improve communication.\n\nOne mistake I made was expecting \"perfect\" English or English without an accent. Trust me; this is not the way to go.\n\nThe focus is communication; the accent is part of it. Be careful if it gets in the way of other people understanding you. If this happens, one option is to see a speech therapist.\n\nI don't expect to have perfect English. I focus on continuous delivery; a little day by day is a lot at the end of the month.\n\nIt is always possible to ask for help for reviews from friends or to hire freelancers on sites like Fiverr to write articles.\n\nWhat else can I do besides English?\n\nTo paraphrase a classic quote by Nelson Mandela, \"If you want to touch the heads of the world's people, speak English, but if you want to touch their hearts, speak your native language.\"\n\nWhen someone learns a new language, it expands their universe of experiences and breaks down geographical and cultural barriers. Yes, if you can speak languages other than English, you will be able to experience connections that can deconstruct your thoughts, feelings, thinking, and acting. The number of opportunities and networking tends to grow exponentially in professional life!\n\nI remember getting some opportunities in Italy, as I was the only consultant who spoke Italian in addition to English. Not to mention the invitations to lectures and the pleasure of helping.\n\nThird-world countries do not speak English fluently due to education issues. For example, learning Spanish guarantees excellent communication throughout most of Latin America, except Portuguese-speaking Brazil.\n\nGoing into a third language tends to be easier once you have a sense of the topics and subjects you want to prioritize or even discard. For example, if I don't talk a lot about family and wine, I don't need to study or learn the vocabulary, as I will rarely use it.\n\nIf you love reading as I do, creating a bonus ritual also helps a lot; for example, I start by reading the little prince for each new language I learn, and it's always nice to see the translations as they also touch on cultural points."
