        "text": "Because that’s just how English works. You might as well ask why verbs have a past tense, why nouns have plural forms, why nouns are not verbs, why we use prepositions, etc. Simply because that’s an integral functional part of the English language. I’m guessing by your profile name that your first language is Arabic; so why do you conjugate verbs in masculine and feminine in Arabic? Why is there a dual? Simply because there is—that’s how the language works. It’s not possible to answer why a language works in the way it does."
