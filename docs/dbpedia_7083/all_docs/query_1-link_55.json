        "text": "The current study investigated the attitudes of 140 Iranian English language learners toward World Englishes. The participants were required to listen to recordings of the same natural speech from a series of speakers with ve di erent accents. The results showed that the participants had a more positive attitude toward American and British English. On the other hand, African-American Vernacular English received the lowest level and Persian English and Australian English were in the middle of this scale. While American English was evaluated as the most socially attractive and African-American as the least socially attractive, British and African-American accents were evaluated as of the highest and lowest social status, respectively. The results further showed that, both American and British accents have high quality. Australian English was in the middle point while Persian and African-American accents were at the end of the scale, respectively.\n\nK E Y W O R D S Reviewing the ups and downs of English in Iran indicates that especially in the last two decades it has been a site of growing struggle between two rival sectors. The first one is the private sector which has been the main contributor to the spread of English in its international version and the second one is the public sector which has been the representative of the localized version of English. Due to the low efficacy of the public sector, the private sector, as a booming market, is playing the main role of English education. Considering the fact, the authors first aim to introduce these two rival sectors. Then, based on the available literature on the topic, it is attempted to delve into the reasons of this growing struggle. The findings indicate that the future will be a scene of continuing presence of English in the private sector in its globalized version and English in the public sector in its localized version Iranian Education System Public sector Private sector International English Localized English.\n\nThis article reports on a qualitative study that investigated English learners' attitudes toward English as an International Language (EIL). Four major findings were identified in the current study. First, majority of the participants thought that English belongs to all its users, regardless of being its native speakers or not. Second, lack of knowledge of Outer Circle varieties led the students to stick to the two major Inner Circle varieties of English-American and British Englishes as standard norms. Third, majority of participants embraced localisation of English and considered it as a manifestation of local cultures. Furthermore, the learners admitted that their local government has attached great value to learning English, but they were concerned about the utilitarian view of education, since majority of the learners focus merely on obtaining high scores on English exams. Fourth, the learners expressed their dissatisfaction with the imbalanced contemporary English teaching and stated that developing communication competence should be the main goal of English instruction. Therefore, the authors suggest that effective measures be taken at policy making, materials development and pedagogy levels to promote the legitimacy of all varieties of English and meet the needs of today's English learners.\n\nThe growing presence of English especially through English language teaching (ELT) is going to considerably influence any language education policy and planning worldwide. Alongside such an influence, the appearance of critical voices in the field of applied linguistics has resulted in some controversial discussions around English and ELT. While this topic has received considerable attention, reviewing the literature on the topic shows that the survey of learners' attitudes, as one of the most important stakeholders in any language-in-education planning, has been mostly neglected. In this paper, the author attempts to investigate the Iranian English language learners' attitudes towards English and ELT to study their trends. To gain insight into the issue, a mixed-methods approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods, was designed and conducted. In the first phase, both focus group and one-to-one interviews were conducted. The content analysis along with the rich literature on the topic yielded a twelve-item Likert-scale questionnaire. To survey the learners' attitudes at large, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 548 participants. Presenting and discussing the findings under four categories reveal that Iranian learners mostly tend to the mainstream trend and lack of awareness and sensitivity towards possible influences of English and ELT on their language and culture is tangible.\n\nEnglish today is a conglomerate of a vast array of different varieties of English. This linguistic diversity, captured most prominently in the World Englishes paradigm (Kachru, 1985), poses a challenge to English language teaching (ELT) in countries where English does not have an official status (i.e. there is no codified local norm) and is learned as a foreign language, such as Armenia or Germany. Learners of English in these countries are norm-dependent on ‘standard’ Englishes spoken as a native language (Kachru, 1985) as the models of teaching (Galloway & Rose, 2015: 196–198; Matsuda and Friedrich, 2012: 21–22). These ‘Standard Englishes’ are abstract and idealized concepts as they are never fully realized by speakers in their ‘clearly delimited, perfectly uniform, and perfectly stable’ (Milroy, 2001: 543) form. However, they are powerful ideas in the minds of speakers – and learners in particular – as the models of language teaching. Standard British (StBE) and Standard American..."
