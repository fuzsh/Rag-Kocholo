        "text": "Communication is key to make sure attendees with disabilities know what to expect at your event and how to prepare for it. The following are helpful details to note in your pre-event communication to your attendees.\n\nLighting: Provide details on what the lighting will be like at the event. For example, are there low-lighting areas? Will there be strobe lights or flashing images? Is flash photography allowed?\n\nSound: Let your attendees know if there will be loud, amplified sounds, and if you are providing or recommend bringing ear plugs.\n\nEffects: State if you will be using fog machines or any other chemicals or smells that may make your space inaccessible to individuals with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.\n\nServices: Include if you are providing interpreting services and/or captioning. Include where they will be located\n\nRequests: Provide information on how attendees can request an accommodation on your website, social media, and other advertisements. Leading up to the event, remind the attendees to submit their requests before the event date. You can specify a deadline to help ensure availability, but you still must make a good faith effort to fulfil requests even if they are submitted after the deadline.\n\nSample request for accommodations: “For accommodations requests, please contact (email and phone number). Please note that submitting your request at least 72 hours before the event will help ensure availability”\n\nWelcoming Language: Include that you are hosting an accessible event. This lets the attendees know that this is a space that welcomes them and will work with them.\n\nPrinted materials should be available upon request, in alternative formats such as large print, electronic versions, Braille or audio. (This generally requires an electronic version of any materials. Large print copies of 18 point, sans serif font are recommended). Whenever showing video content you should provide either open or Real-Time Captioned, even if it was not requested. Captioning is a great resource that benefits everyone.\n\nCity and County of San Francisco Authorized Braille Providers\n\nView best practices and guidelines for large print documents used by the low vision community here\n\nLearn everything you need to know to schedule Real-Time Captioners here\n\nOn site staff members or volunteers must be available to answer specific questions about accessibility. An effective method is to establish a clearly marked information area that can be found on a map.\n\nConsider implementing a tactile map for people who are blind or have low-vision. An effective, accessible map should indicate the following areas: passenger loading zones, accessible entrances, information area(s), stage location(s) and viewing platform(s), accessible paths of travel, shuttle routes (if provided), accessible toilets, and nearby public transportation stops.\n\nVisit the website for Lighthouse For the Blind to learn more about braille/tactile maps and how to get one for your event.\n\nView an example of an accessible map here\n\nView tips and resources for communicating effectively with people with disabilities here\n\nIf your event will have 100 or more attendees, it is recommended that you provide Real Time Captioning for speakers or performers. If this service is requested, you are required to provide it. If your event has 1,000 or more attendees you must provide Real Time Captioning, even if it was not requested.\n\nCity and County of San Francisco Authorized Real Time Captioning Services\n\nIf your event will have 500 or more attendees, it is recommended that you provide an American Sign Language Interpreter. If this service is requested, you are required to provide it. If your event has 1,000 or more attendees, you must provide an American Sign Language Interpreter.\n\nCity and County of San Francisco Authorized Sign Language Providers\n\nYou must provide assistive listening devices for a speaker or performance if requested. The minimum number of receivers needed is based on the seating capacity of the space. Receivers only need to be available for the performance, so you can share the receivers between activities and presentations. You must provide receivers at no cost to users, but you can require individuals to leave a valid ID or a small, returnable deposit to check out a receiver.\n\nShow that you have ALDs available by using signage with the international symbol access for hearing loss.\n\nView information on ALDs here\n\nView printable “assistive devices here” signage"
