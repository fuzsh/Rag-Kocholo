It is an honor for me to welcome you to our product that we have created with passion and love for the craft.\n\nIf you have a minute, I would love to use this opportunity to tell you about what’s behind the company and where we are heading.\n\nI loved programming since childhood and started my career as a developer when I was 19. However, I always felt that wasn’t the ultimate goal but a means for creating something more significant.\n\nLater on, when I started working in sales, I found that the process involved a ton of manual tasks – like sending emails and follow-ups to prospects – and was pretty time-consuming. I decided to find a way to automate the process and so Reply was born.\n\nToday, at Reply we are building a communication platform that makes it easier and more effective to communicate with existing and new customers. And with the advance in AI technologies, we are aiming to automate this process as much as possible, while keeping it very personal.\n\nBeing a boutique business by design, we prioritize quality over quantity and strive to preserve the startup culture, no matter the scale. Our goal is to build a great company where we love to work, with outstanding products that customers adore, and constant innovation that drives the industry forward.\n\nWe are looking forward to working with you and hope that you can feel our love through our product and every interaction with the team.\n\nWorking hard for you every day,\n\nOleg Bilozor, CEO & Founder at Reply"
