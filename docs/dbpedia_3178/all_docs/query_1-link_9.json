        "text": "“Austin,” you may be asking yourself, “why do I need a Photoshop alternative? I already know that VIV comes with a built-in Photo Editor that lets me crop and resize images, adjust brightness, add filters that rival Instagram, put funny mustaches on pictures of clients that don’t pay on time, and more.”\n\nWell, inquisitive reader, sometimes you’ll need to take your image editing to the next level, beyond what VIV can reasonably provide inside its already powerful editor. But there’s no need to break the bank to do so!\n\nThe default industry tool for editing images is Adobe Photoshop. And while it’s an amazing tool for power-users, the price tag and the feature set can be a bit overwhelming. The good news is there are lots of free or inexpensive Photoshop alternatives. But which one is right for you? GIMP vs. Paint.NET, Pixlr vs. Canva, PicMonkey vs. BeFunky — there are so many platforms to evaluate and compare.\n\nTo save you some time, we reviewed some of the top PhotoShop alternatives out there, including:\n\nGIMP\n\nPaint.NET\n\nPixlr\n\nCanva\n\nStencil\n\nPicMonkey\n\nBeFunky\n\nWe hope you find these reviews and summaries useful as you look for a tool that meets your advanced image design needs.\n\nThe default industry tool for editing images is Adobe’s Photoshop. And while it’s an amazing tool for power-users, the price tag and the feature set can be a bit overwhelming. A quick Google search will show you a slew of free Photoshop alternatives, but I’ve taken the time to narrow the search down for you.\n\nHere are the top four best (and free) alternatives to Photoshop, that you would actually want to use.\n\nGIMP:\n\nYou may have already heard of GIMP, the free open-source image editor that rivals Photoshop in both power and complexity. GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program, and you can use this tool to accomplish almost anything you’re looking to do in Photoshop — there may just be more steps involved or a few custom plugins to download.\n\nThere are a couple off-shoots of GIMP, including GimpShop and GimpPhoto, which both try to make the user interface more similar to Photoshop. However, these aren’t as actively developed, so I recommend sticking with the original. At the time this post was updated, GIMP 2.10.18 is the latest version of this software and was announced on 02/24/2020. This update includes PSD support improvements, a consolidated user interface for merging down and anchoring layers, and even a new 3D Transform tool to rotate and pan items. If you want something truly comparable to Photoshop, for absolutely zero cost, GIMP is the best you will find.\n\nPaint.NET\n\nPaint.NET isn’t quite as advanced as Photoshop and GIMP. It’s more of a mid-level editor that focuses on ease-of-use, but has many of the essential intermediate features that would normally require Photoshop, like layers, history, an action manager, and a whole host of effects that will make most image tweakers and amateur designers happy.\n\nI’ve personally used Paint.NET for years to create great-looking graphics for websites, video games, online videos and more. It has everything you need to take your image editing to the next level, and will serve you well. Not bad for a program that doesn’t cost anything, right?\n\nUnfortunately, Paint.NET is Windows only (Windows users, you don’t have to read the rest of the article- this is what you’re looking for). Pinta is an attempt to create a tool like Paint.NET for Mac, but in my experience it was unreliable. At the time this post was updated, Paint.NET 4.2.10 is the latest version of this tool and was released on 02/14/2020.\n\nPixlr Editor\n\nDo you need to edit an image right now? No time to wait to download software? Then Pixlr is your answer.\n\nPixlr offers two different free tools for editing images: simple, stripped down version for beginners called Pixler X and a more advanced option for professionals called Pixlr E. Both editors open almost any image format such as PSD (Photoshop), PXD, Jpeg, PNG (Transparent), WebP, SVG, etc. And both products use AI for automatic background removal and other functions to help you create professional looking photo edits.\n\nPixlr is fully cross-platform, so you can use it on WIndows, Mac, Linux, etc. and is surprisingly easy to use.\n\nSince it runs entirely in the browser, Pixlr is handy if you need to edit an image while you’re on someone else’s computer and don’t want to install software, or working on an underpowered computer like a netbook.\n\nPersonally, Pixlr has filled the void Paint.NET left in my heart when I switched to Mac. Give it a try; I think you’ll be impressed. They also offer paid plans with access to additional tools and features.\n\nCanva\n\nCanva has to be one of the most popular image creators around.\n\nOne of the things that immediately sets Canva apart from many of the other other image editors on this list is it comes with pre-sized templates for all kinds of design projects such as posters, online ads, presentations, menus, book covers… the list goes on and on.\n\nCanva also allows you to create custom image sizes, add layers to your images, adjust transparency, and upload your own icons, images or anything else in a .JPEG or .PNG format.\n\nThe image editing tool also offers a free plan that works great for quick and relatively basic projects. Paid plans are also available that provide you with more features intended for larger teams.\n\nStencil\n\nStencil is a lesser known image creating app, but it’s one of the better ones out there if you’re looking to create social media and blog images.\n\nStencil exists online as an app and as a Google Chrome Browser extension and has quite a few editing options:\n\nUse a starter template\n\nCreate custom image sizes\n\nAdd icons, graphics and background from their resource\n\nUpload your own backgrounds or icons\n\nEasily add a watermark for your photos\n\nAdjust transparency on text/images\n\nGo from one image size to another without starting over so your images look the same across all social channels (something Canva doesn’t do unless you upgrade)\n\nThere are quite a few similarities to what this can do compared to Canva, but there are some differences that I like including being able to use the Google Chrome extension to quickly create an image. Both free and paid plans are available.\n\nPicMonkey"
