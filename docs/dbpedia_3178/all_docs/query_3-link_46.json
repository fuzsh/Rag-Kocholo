        "text": "As more businesses turn to cloud-based solutions, Software as a Service (SaaS) has become increasingly popular.\n\nIn fact, according to a recent report, the global SaaS market is expected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2032.\n\nBut what exactly is SaaS? It’s a software delivery model in which users access applications over the Internet rather than installing them on their own devices. This approach offers many benefits, including lower costs, effortless scalability, and improved collaboration.\n\nIn this comprehensive article, I discuss 61 eye-opening SaaS statistics that will help you better understand this rapidly growing market.\n\n1. SaaS is the most essential tech in business success.\n\n(Source: Harvey Nash)\n\nTo stay competitive in today’s business world, you must use Software as a service (SaaS).\n\nSaaS is a cloud-based software delivery model that allows businesses to access software applications online. With SaaS, you don’t need to install or maintain Software on your servers, which can save you time and money.\n\nSaaS is the most critical technology for business success because it offers several advantages over traditional software delivery models. First, SaaS is highly scalable, so you can easily add or remove users as needed.\n\nSecond, SaaS is cost-effective. You don’t need to purchase expensive hardware or software licenses or hire an IT staff member to maintain your software.\n\nInstead, you pay a monthly or annual subscription fee, which includes all software updates and maintenance.\n\nThird, SaaS is highly secure. SaaS providers use advanced security measures to protect your data, including encryption, firewalls, and multi-factor authentication. This means you can trust that your data is safe and secure.\n\n2. The global SaaS industry is worth over $317.55 Billion.\n\n(Source: Fortune Business Insights)\n\nSaaS, or Software as a Service, is a software licensing and delivery model that has become increasingly popular over the past few years.\n\nThis growth can be attributed to many factors, including the increasing demand for cloud-based solutions, the rise of remote work, and the need for more flexible and scalable software solutions.\n\n3. The global Software as a Service (SaaS) market is projected to grow from $317.55 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2032, at a CAGR of 18.4%.\n\n(Source: Fortune Business Insights)\n\nThis growth is driven by the increasing adoption of cloud-based software solutions across various industries.\n\nSaaS significantly benefits businesses, including lower costs, increased flexibility, and scalability. As a result, more and more organizations are shifting towards SaaS solutions to improve their operations and gain a competitive edge.\n\nThe growth of the SaaS market is also fueled by advancements in technology, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which are being integrated into SaaS applications to enhance their capabilities and provide better insights to users.\n\n4. The combined market value of the top 10 SaaS companies is above US$1.3 trillion.\n\n(Source: Mike Sonders)\n\nThe market value of the top SaaS companies is nothing to scoff at. This staggering number shows just how valuable the SaaS industry has become.\n\nThe top 10 SaaS companies are dominated by well-known names such as Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe, and Oracle. These companies have been in the SaaS game for a long time and have established themselves as leaders in the industry.\n\nTheir market value is a testament to their success and the demand for their products and services.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the market value of these companies can fluctuate over time due to various factors, such as changes in the market, mergers and acquisitions, and new competitors entering the space.\n\n5. Salesforce is the largest SaaS company in the U.S., with a market capitalization of $249.1 billion. It is followed by Adobe, at $246.3 billion, and Intuit, at $183.9 billion.\n\n(Source: Mike Sonders)\n\nThis is an impressive feat, considering that the company was founded in 1999 and has only been in business for a little over two decades.\n\nFollowing Salesforce is Adobe. Adobe is known for its creative Software, such as Photoshop and Illustrator, and its marketing software, such as Adobe Experience Cloud. In third place is Intuit. Intuit is best known for its financial Software, such as QuickBooks and TurboTax.\n\nThese three companies are the top players in the SaaS industry in the U.S. They have all achieved significant success and have become household names in the software world.\n\n6. It’s estimated that by 2025, 85% of business apps will be SaaS-based.\n\n(Source: Bettercloud)\n\nThis means that most businesses will be using cloud-based Software to manage their operations.\n\nThe trend towards SaaS solutions will likely continue as businesses look for ways to streamline their operations and stay competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace.\n\nBy embracing cloud-based software solutions, companies can benefit from increased flexibility, scalability, and cost savings while staying ahead of the technology trends curve.\n\n7. End-users have spent over $438k on SaaS subscriptions since 2020.\n\n(Source: Gartner)\n\nThis figure represents the total amount of money end-users have spent on SaaS applications, including productivity, collaboration, and project management software.\n\nThese applications offer various benefits, including increased efficiency, scalability, and flexibility. The demand for SaaS solutions has only grown with the rise of remote work and digital transformation.\n\nAs more businesses adopt SaaS applications, the market for these solutions is expected to expand.\n\n8. There are approximately 30,000 SaaS companies worldwide. Almost 15,000 of those are in the marketing sector.\n\n(Source: Ascendix)\n\nThis makes sense, as marketing is critical to any successful business. With so many SaaS companies, there’s apparent competition in the marketing sector.\n\nIt’s worth noting that these numbers are constantly changing. New SaaS companies are constantly being created; some existing ones may go out of business.\n\n9. The US has nearly 17,000 SaaS companies and 59 million customers worldwide.\n\n(Source: Statista)\n\nIf you’re looking for a place with a thriving SaaS industry, the US is a great place to start. The US is home to some of the biggest names in the industry, including Salesforce, Dropbox, and Slack.\n\nBut it’s not just about the number of companies. The US is also a significant player when it comes to SaaS customers.\n\nThis is partly because the US has a highly developed technology sector, with many companies and individuals eager to adopt new software solutions. Additionally, the US is home to many large corporations that rely on SaaS to manage their operations.\n\n10. The UK follows the US with 2,100 SaaS companies and 3 billion customers worldwide.\n\n(Source: Aaron Wallis)\n\nThe UK is the second-largest SaaS market in the world, following the US. The UK’s SaaS industry is increasing, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% from 2018 to 2023.\n\nThe UK SaaS market is highly competitive, with a mix of large and small companies offering a wide range of services.\n\nSage, Salesforce, and Microsoft are the major players in the UK SaaS market. These companies have a significant market share and constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nThe UK SaaS companies are catering to a global market. They are known for their quality of service, reliability, and innovation. The UK SaaS companies are also expanding their offerings to cater to the changing needs of their customers.\n\n11. The SaaS industries in China, India, and Brazil are expected to grow by over 2x between 2020 and 2025.\n\n(Source: Reply)\n\nChina, India, and Brazil are all emerging markets with a large population and a growing economy.\n\nAs a result, they are becoming increasingly attractive to SaaS companies looking to expand their customer base. These countries offer a vast market opportunity for SaaS companies with enormous growth potential.\n\nIn China, the SaaS industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.5% between 2020 and 2025. India’s SaaS industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30.4% during the same period. Brazil’s SaaS industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.8%.\n\n12. Germany is expected to experience the most significant increase in SaaS market growth from significant markets by 2025, from €6.85 billion to €16.3 billion.\n\n(Source: Statista)\n\nGermany is expected to experience the most significant increase in SaaS market growth from significant markets with an impressive compound annual growth rate of 18.9%.\n\nThis growth is driven by several factors, including the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions, the rise of digital transformation initiatives, and the growing demand for Software that supports remote work and collaboration.\n\nIn addition, Germany’s strong economy, highly skilled workforce, and supportive government policies are contributing to its growing reputation as a leading hub for SaaS innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\n13. By 2026, public cloud spending is predicted to exceed 45% of all enterprise IT spending.\n\n(Source: Gartner)\n\nThe growth of public cloud spending clearly indicates the importance of cloud computing in modern business operations. As more businesses adopt cloud technologies, we expect to see continued growth in this area in the coming years.\n\nThis trend is driven by the many benefits of cloud computing, including cost savings, scalability, and flexibility.\n\n14. Marketing and sales remain the highest expenses of SaaS companies, amounting to 50% or more of their revenues.\n\n(Source: McKinsey)\n\nSaaS companies must continually attract new customers to maintain their growth and revenue. As a result, they spend a substantial portion of their budget on marketing and sales efforts.\n\nIf a SaaS company generates $1 million in revenue, it will likely spend at least $500,000 on marketing and sales efforts.\n\nSaaS companies must demonstrate a clear return on investment to justify these expenses.\n\nSaaS companies must track the effectiveness of their marketing and sales efforts and adjust their strategies accordingly. In addition to attracting new customers, they must focus on retaining them.\n\nThis requires ongoing engagement, support, and regular updates and improvements to the product or service.\n\n15. Private SaaS funding in Europe is seeing 3.2x year-over-year growth.\n\n(Source: Paddle)\n\nIf you’re looking to invest in private SaaS companies in Europe, now might be the time. According to recent statistics, private SaaS funding in Europe is seeing impressive year-over-year growth.\n\nThis growth indicates a substantial market for SaaS companies in Europe and suggests that investors are noticing. With more funding available to these companies, they may be able to expand their offerings and reach new customers.\n\nOf course, investing in private SaaS companies carries some risk. Before making any investment decisions, it’s essential to research and carefully consider the potential returns.\n\nHowever, with such strong market growth, the opportunities are worth considering.\n\n16. In 2021, there were more than 337 SaaS unicorns and 15 decacorns (valued at more than $10 billion) in the US.\n\n(Source: SaaStr)\n\nIf you’re looking for evidence of the growth and success of the SaaS industry, look no further than the number of unicorns and decacorns in the United States.\n\nA unicorn is a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion, while a decacorn is a company valued at over $10 billion. These high valuations are a testament to the growing importance of SaaS in the technology industry.\n\nThe success of these SaaS companies is partly due to the many advantages of the SaaS model, such as lower upfront costs, more effortless scalability, and greater flexibility.\n\n17. The AI SaaS market is expected to grow from US$73.8 billion in 2020 to US$1.5 trillion by 2030.\n\n(Source: Verified Market Research)\n\nOne reason for the growth of the AI SaaS market is the increasing demand for AI-powered solutions.\n\nAI can help businesses automate processes, improve decision-making, and enhance customer experiences. As a result, more companies are looking for AI solutions to help them stay competitive.\n\nAnother reason for the growth of the AI SaaS market is the increasing availability of AI tools and platforms. As AI technology advances, it’s becoming easier for businesses to implement AI solutions.\n\nThis means more companies can use AI without investing in expensive AI infrastructure.\n\n18. 35% of SaaS companies use AI today, while 42% intend to.\n\n(Source: Dorik)\n\nAI is becoming increasingly popular in the SaaS industry. This technology is being utilized in various ways, including customer service chatbots, predictive analytics, and automation of routine tasks.\n\nSaaS companies can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience by implementing AI.\n\nHowever, a significant portion of SaaS companies have not yet adopted AI. According to recent statistics, 42% of companies intend to implement AI soon. This suggests that the use of AI in SaaS will continue to grow in the coming years.\n\nIt’s important to note that implementing AI requires significant investment in both time and resources.\n\n19. AI-native tech companies are predicted to reach US$1 billion ARR 50% faster than other cloud services.\n\n(Source: Bessemer Venture Partners)\n\nThis is because AI-native tech companies leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide their customers with more efficient and effective services.\n\nThese companies can scale quickly and generate revenue faster by automating processes and improving accuracy.\n\nSome examples of AI-native tech companies that have already reached the US$1 billion ARR milestone include UiPath, Databricks, and Snowflake. As the demand for AI-powered solutions grows, more companies will likely follow.\n\n20. 38% of SaaS companies have incorporated generative AI features into their services.\n\n(Source: Panintelligence)\n\nGenerative AI is artificial intelligence that allows Software to create new content based on existing data. This can be useful for various tasks, such as generating personalized recommendations or creating unique marketing content.\n\nSaaS companies can offer their customers more personalized and efficient services using generative AI.\n\nFor example, a customer relationship management (CRM) platform could use generative AI to create customized email templates based on a customer’s past interactions with the company.\n\n21. 15% of SaaS services have launched deep learning to products.\n\n(Source: Panintelligence)\n\nThis means these companies use deep learning algorithms to improve their Software’s performance, accuracy, and speed.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the term, deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. It’s a rapidly growing field, and many SaaS companies are starting to incorporate deep learning into their products.\n\nOne of deep learning’s main benefits is that it can help SaaS companies automate tasks previously done manually.\n\nAnother benefit is that it can help SaaS companies personalize their products to individual users. By analyzing user data, deep learning algorithms can make personalized recommendations, suggest relevant content, and predict user behavior.\n\n22. Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global web/video conferencing SaaS market was estimated at $3.5 billion in 2020. This is projected to reach $7 billion by 2026.\n\n(Source: Report Linker)\n\nThe sudden shift to remote work and virtual communication due to the pandemic has significantly increased demand for web/video conferencing SaaS solutions.\n\nMany businesses have had to adapt quickly to this new way of working, leading to a surge in the adoption of these technologies.\n\nAs the world continues to navigate the pandemic and businesses embrace the benefits of remote work, the web/video conferencing SaaS market is expected to continue its growth trajectory.\n\nWith the rise of hybrid work models and the need for flexible communication solutions, the market is poised for further expansion in the coming years.\n\n23. Zoom reported US$540 million in 2019. This shot up to US$1.96 billion in 2020 and US$4.49 billion in 2023.\n\n(Source: CompaniesMarketcap.com)\n\nIf you’re looking for evidence that SaaS is booming, look no further than Zoom’s revenue growth.\n\nZoom’s meteoric rise is mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many people to work and socialize remotely. As a result, Zoom became the go-to platform for virtual meetings, webinars, and conferences. The company’s user base skyrocketed, and so did its revenue.\n\nBut the pandemic is not the only factor driving Zoom’s success. The company has also invested heavily in product development, adding new features and improving the user experience.\n\nThis has helped Zoom stay ahead of the competition and retain its position as the market leader in video conferencing.\n\n24. Among enterprises, 30% reported significantly higher than planned spending on cloud usage due to COVID-19.\n\n(Source: Finances Online)\n\nIf you’re an enterprise that uses cloud services, you may have experienced unexpected expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis increase in spending can be attributed to several factors. With remote work becoming the norm, enterprises had to adapt to new working methods quickly. This meant relying more heavily on cloud services to support remote collaboration and communication.\n\nAdditionally, enterprises had to scale up their cloud infrastructure to accommodate the increased demand for online services.\n\nDespite the unexpected expenses, many enterprises recognize the value of cloud services in enabling remote work and ensuring business continuity during the pandemic. As a result, they plan to continue investing in cloud services.\n\n25. In May 2020 alone, there was a 176% Increase in Collaboration Apps Installed on Enterprise Devices After the COVID-19 Crisis.\n\n(Source: Impact My Biz)\n\nAs more and more people started working from home due to the pandemic, the need for collaboration tools increased. Companies had to find ways to ensure that their employees could still work together effectively, even when they were not physically together.\n\nCollaboration apps such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Slack have become essential tools for remote work. These apps allow teams to communicate, collaborate, and share information in real-time, no matter where they are.\n\nThe increase in collaboration app installations indicates how important these tools have become in today’s business environment.\n\nAs remote work continues to be a popular option for many companies, collaboration apps will likely remain an essential tool for the foreseeable future.\n\n26. Medium-growth (10-50% annual revenue growth) SaaS companies saw around 11% quits over the year, while companies with less than 10% growth saw an average of nearly 15% of their workforce voluntarily leave during 2021.\n\n(Source: SaaS Capital)\n\nThis trend may be due to several factors, including a more stable and predictable revenue stream for medium-growth companies, which can lead to greater job security for employees.\n\nAdditionally, medium-growth companies may be better positioned to offer competitive compensation packages and benefits, which can help retain top talent.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that voluntary turnover can still be a challenge for any company, regardless of growth rate.\n\nTo reduce turnover, companies may need to focus on creating a positive work environment, providing opportunities for professional development, and offering competitive compensation and benefits packages.\n\n27. The fastest-growing SaaS companies (annual growth rates over 50%) saw only half as much voluntary turnover as the slowest, around 7.5%.\n\n(Source: SaaS Capital)\n\nThere are several reasons why this might be the case. First, fast-growing companies often offer more opportunities for career advancement and development, which makes employees more likely to stay.\n\nAdditionally, these companies may be more likely to offer competitive salaries and benefits packages, which can also help retain employees.\n\nIf you run a SaaS company, you must pay attention to your turnover rates and take steps to reduce them.\n\nThis might include offering competitive salaries and benefits, providing opportunities for career advancement, and creating a positive company culture. Doing so can help ensure that your company continues to grow and thrive.\n\n28. 94% of IT executives believe manual SaaS management methods lead to poor decision-making about SaaS spending.\n\n(Source: Bettercloud)\n\nManual SaaS management methods use spreadsheets, emails, and other manual processes to track usage and spending. These methods are time-consuming and error-prone and do not provide real-time visibility into SaaS usage and expenditure.\n\nAs a result, IT executives may not have accurate information to make informed decisions about SaaS spending.\n\nAutomated SaaS management solutions, on the other hand, provide real-time visibility into SaaS usage and spending. They automate tracking SaaS usage, identifying unused licenses, and optimizing SaaS spending.\n\nWith automated SaaS management solutions, IT executives can make informed decisions about SaaS spending and ensure that the organization gets the most value from their SaaS investments.\n\n29. 48% of businesses want to improve their management of SaaS products in the next year, and 54% want to optimize and find savings in their software spending.\n\n(Source: Flexera)\n\nBusinesses can take several steps to achieve these goals. For example, they can regularly audit their SaaS usage to identify unnecessary or underutilized products. They can also negotiate better pricing and terms with their SaaS vendors to reduce costs.\n\nMoreover, businesses can implement SaaS management tools to automate and simplify their SaaS management process. These tools can help companies to track their SaaS usage, manage licenses, and optimize their software spend.\n\nBusinesses can achieve significant cost savings and increase their operational efficiency by improving their SaaS management and optimizing their software spending.\n\n30. Companies with SaaSOps platforms use twice as many SaaS tools as non-SaaSOps businesses.\n\n(Source: Bettercloud)\n\nThis is because SaaSOps platforms are designed to manage and optimize SaaS applications.\n\nAs a result, businesses that use SaaSOps platforms can easily integrate and manage more SaaS tools, which helps them to streamline their operations and increase productivity.\n\nIn addition, SaaSOps platforms provide businesses with better visibility and control over their SaaS applications. This means that companies can easily monitor and manage their SaaS tools, which helps them to identify and resolve issues quickly.\n\n31. 25% of IT teams say they spend most of their time managing third-party vendors and business solutions. And 31% involves maintaining compliance and security.\n\n(Source: Productiv)\n\nTo alleviate the burden on your IT team, consider outsourcing some tasks to a managed service provider (MSP) or investing in SaaS solutions with built-in compliance and security features.\n\nThis can help free up your IT team’s time and expertise to focus on more strategic initiatives that drive business growth.\n\n32. 56% of enterprise apps aren’t managed, meaning no one pays close attention to renewal dates, licenses, app usage, security, and compliance.\n\n(Source: Productiv)\n\nThis lack of oversight can lead to various issues, including security breaches, compliance violations, and wasted resources. Without proper management, applications can easily become outdated, insecure, and underutilized.\n\nTo avoid these problems, it’s crucial to implement an application management strategy that includes regular monitoring, updates, and audits. This can help ensure your applications remain secure, compliant, and optimized for your business needs.\n\nAdditionally, it’s essential to clearly understand your software licensing agreements to avoid any unexpected fees or penalties.\n\nBy managing your applications effectively, you can reduce the risk of security breaches, compliance violations, and wasted resources while improving your overall business efficiency.\n\n33. On average, it takes 7.12 hours to off-board a user across a company’s SaaS apps–without a SaaSOps platform.\n\n(Source: Bettercloud)\n\nWhen an employee leaves a company, it’s crucial to ensure that their access to company data and applications is revoked.\n\nHowever, manually off-boarding a user across multiple SaaS apps can be time-consuming and take up valuable resources.\n\nWithout a SaaSOps platform, off-boarding can also be error-prone. It’s easy to miss an app or forget to revoke access to specific data, which can lead to security risks and potential data breaches.\n\nBy implementing a SaaS ops platform, companies can streamline the off-boarding process and reduce the time it takes to revoke access to SaaS apps. This can save valuable time and resources while reducing the risk of security breaches.\n\n34. The Biggest Challenges in Using Public Cloud for Business are security (66%), compliance (60%), lack of staff training/experience (58%), privacy (57%), vendor lock-in (47%), and cost (40%).\n\n(Source: Finances Online)\n\nSecurity is the top concern for businesses using the public cloud. This is understandable, as the public cloud is a shared environment, and there is always a risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, robust security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring, must be implemented.\n\nCompliance is another significant challenge. When using public cloud services, businesses must comply with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS regulations. This can be challenging, as different cloud providers have different compliance requirements.\n\nLack of staff training/experience is also a common challenge. Public cloud is a relatively new technology, and many businesses may not have the necessary skills and expertise to manage it effectively.\n\nCompanies should invest in staff training and development programs to address this challenge.\n\nPrivacy is a concern for public cloud services, which store data on servers owned and managed by third-party providers. To address this challenge, businesses should ensure appropriate data protection policies and procedures are in place.\n\nVendor lock-in is challenging, as switching to a different cloud provider can be difficult once a business has invested in a particular platform. To mitigate this risk, companies should choose cloud providers that offer open standards and interoperability.\n\nFinally, cost is a challenge as public cloud services can be expensive, especially for businesses with large data volumes.\n\nCompanies should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of different cloud providers and services to address this challenge before deciding.\n\n35. Insider threats, which include former employees who retain access to an organization’s SaaS apps, are responsible for 22% of security incidents.\n\n(Source: Security Boulevard)\n\nInsider threats are a significant concern in SaaS security. These individuals have access to an organization’s SaaS apps and use that access for malicious purposes.\n\nInsider threats can include current employees, contractors, and even former employees who still have access to the organization’s systems.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with insider threats is that they are often difficult to detect. These individuals may have legitimate access to SaaS apps, making distinguishing between authorized and unauthorized activity hard.\n\nAs a result, organizations must implement strict access controls and monitoring processes to detect and prevent insider threats.\n\nBy taking these steps, organizations can minimize the risk of insider threats and protect their SaaS systems from unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\n36. Around 45% of small and medium-sized businesses have most or all business applications in the cloud.\n\n(Source: AppDirect)\n\nMoving your business applications to the cloud has many benefits. One of the most significant is that it allows you to access your data and applications from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.\n\nThis means that you can work from home, on the road, or anywhere else you need to be. Another benefit of cloud-based applications is that they are often more affordable than traditional Software.\n\nInstead of paying for expensive licenses and hardware, you can pay a monthly or yearly subscription fee. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.\n\nFinally, using cloud-based applications can also help you to improve your business’s security. Cloud providers often have more robust security measures than small companies can implement.\n\nThis means hackers or malicious actors are less likely to compromise your data.\n\n37. A Predicted 99% of companies will use at least one SaaS system by the end of 2024.\n\nAs we move further into the digital age, more and more companies are turning to Software as a Service (SaaS) systems to streamline their operations.\n\nThe benefits of SaaS systems include cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved scalability.\n\nSaaS systems allow companies to access software applications from any location with an internet connection, eliminating the need for expensive on-premise hardware and software installations.\n\n38. On average, young companies (1-2 years old) start with 29 SaaS apps. By the time they’re 3-6 years old, that number spikes to 103 apps.\n\n(Source: Bettercloud)\n\nIf you’re a young company, you probably use many SaaS apps to get your business up and running. However, that number can quickly increase as your company grows and matures.\n\nWhile using multiple SaaS apps can help streamline your business operations, keeping track of which apps you’re using and how much they’re costing is essential. It’s also necessary to ensure your apps work seamlessly to avoid potential issues.\n\n39. The average number of SaaS apps a business uses is 371. That’s 253 for SMBs, while mid-market companies use 335, and enterprise firms average 473.\n\n(Source: Productiv)\n\nAs businesses continue to adopt cloud-based solutions, the number of Software as a Service (SaaS) applications they use is increasing.\n\nThis trend is unsurprising, given SaaS’s benefits, including cost savings, scalability, and ease of use. With so many SaaS apps available, businesses can choose the ones that best suit their needs.\n\nHowever, managing multiple SaaS apps can be challenging.
