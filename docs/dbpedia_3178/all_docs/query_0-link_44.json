        "text": "As Windows 7 approaches the expected end of monthly security patching next January, Windows 7 users who have hesitated to switch to Windows 10 face the critical choice of whether to accept Microsoft’s newest operating system; to switch to an altogether different platform such as Linux, Mac, or Chrome OS; or to look for a way to protect their favorite OS into 2020 and beyond.\n\nIn my case, I have decided to implement a multi-layered defense strategy which, I am confident, will make it possible to use Windows 7 without worries while I continue the slow transition to Linux (Kubuntu). The defensive layers include, in no particular order:\n\n* Resident anti-virus software. My main Windows 7 machine is currently on BitDefender Free, but there are many other good free and paid AV solutions out there.\n\n* Resident anti-exploit software. Several choices are available, such as Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit (MBAE) and Microsoft’s own EMET, but I use HitmanPro.Alert as it also offers keystroke encryption.\n\n* On-demand scanners to catch any baddies that might have gotten past the main defenders. I cycle a variety of free scanners including Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free (MBAM), Sophos Virus Removal Tool, F-Secure Online Scanner, Norton Power Eraser, and ESET Online Scanner. (Once again, there are others, free and paid.) At least occasionally, run the rootkit scanning feature, if available (usually requires a reboot).\n\n* Use a Web traffic-filtering browser extension such as Norton Safe Web or Bitdefender TrafficLight, and/or a security-oriented public DNS resolver such as Quad9, for your Web browsing.\n\n* Keep your router firmware updated, if possible, and consider increasing the router’s hardware firewall settings (it may come set to a medium level that’s less hassle, but offers lower protection). Learn how to block websites and URLs at the router.\n\n* Use a software firewall that will explicitly ask your permission when new programs try to access the Internet for any reason. Over time, you will train the firewall to allow trusted programs and the number of notifications will fall to just new (and possibly unknown) programs. ZoneAlarm Free Firewall is set to ask you “out of the box.”\n\n* Keep your browsers (plus their extensions/plugins) and other programs updated.\n\n* Use ad-blocking extensions on your browsers, as malvertising is one of the main sources of infection nowadays. My main choice for this is uBlock Origin, although I’ve also used Ghostery.\n\n* Change your Windows account from the default administrator account to a standard user account, which has fewer rights to install software and make changes to the system. (You will have to enter a password to do those sorts of things.) This prevents malware from exploiting your administrator status to make changes behind your back, and research suggests that this one measure alone prevents upward of 90% of attacks.\n\n* Use an extensive Hosts file to stop your computer from being led to sites that serve up malware. I also use it to block Facebook, which some researchers claim follows you around the Web even if you don’t have a Facebook account. You can obtain ample Hosts files from here or here.\n\n* Additional protections: I have installed OSArmor by NoVirusThanks and have had a good experience with it. The program, over time, builds a whitelist of programs that you have approved to run on your PC. I am also considering BlackFog Privacy and VoodooShield as useful, supplemental layers of defense; reports on the security community Wilders Security indicates a high degree of compatibility and satisfaction for both of these products.\n\n* I am evaluating 0patch, by Acros Security. This is a service that injects on-the-fly patches to software that no longer receives updates from its vendor. I am currently using it on a Vista test machine and have experienced no problems, although I’m not sure yet how useful it might be as it has rarely kicked in to do its thing. For a more thorough test, I may need to install 0patch on my main Vista PC, but for now at least I’ve determined that it doesn’t make Vista crash or slow down. When Windows 7 goes EOS, 0patch could conceivably fill in for the bulk of security patches that Win7 will not receive.\n\n* Finally, back up the PC (data and programs) regularly. If all else fails and you get infected, you will then have a reasonably current copy of your computer that you can install over the infected system. There are numerous image backup solutions out there; I use the free version of Macrium Reflect.\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou might think that there is considerable overlap in the kinds of protection offered by the above set of measures. And you would be right: the defenses feature a moat, trenches, walls, minefields, sentries, snipers, archers, machine-gun nests, early-warning systems, Patriot missiles, deflector shields, and an escape tunnel. I have deliberately built redundancy into the strategy, so that whatever one misses another one will stop. I’ve neither experienced nor heard of any incompatibilities affecting computer usability. (The only caution is to avoid using multiple resident AV programs at the same time, for example BitDefender and Kaspersky.)\n\nIs this paranoid? No more so than the folks who tell us that you must patch right now or you’re doomed, or that you must upgrade to Windows 10 when Win7 goes EOS or you’re doomed.\n\nWith this combination of defensive measures, I have every confidence that my Win7 box will remain well protected for as long as I care to use it. So long as security vendors continue to support Windows 7, and Win7 browsers continue to load websites, I don’t see any great impediment to keeping this Windows 7 system connected to the Internet for the foreseeable future.\n\nI imagine those products Cybertooth has installed for detecting dodgy Web sites are one way and perhaps the only way of dealing with this widespread problem. But they have, in general, two important drawbacks that are worth noting:\n\n(1) When they incorrectly either block or advise to avoid a site that is actually OK and belongs to some legitimate organization or merchant, the poor organization or merchant can become seriously victimized without the possibility of defending itself, himself, or herself in court, as it were. This I have seen happen and learned just how pitiful, loud and numerous the complaints of the innocent victims can be!\n\n(2) If, again by mistake or by some small and harmless irregularity, a site with some much needed information that one is desperately looking for gets vetoed by the defensive software, one may either never, or not soon enough, be able to find that information somewhere else.\n\nOne can always white list a site, of course, if one (a) knows enough about it already to decide to do so, or (b) somehow can sense both its existence and its URL before discovering it during a Web search — not a very likely proposition, I should think.\n\nSo one must be aware that there are not just pros, but also cons with this as with anything else.\n\nI installed Windows Firewall Notifier a couple of days ago. It generated a lot of notifications that it was blocking various installed programs, and it didn’t seem to be “learning” anything when told to Allow. I disabled it until this morning, when I tried again. Same story.\n\nAs mentioned previously, WFN does not install, but runs from an .exe file in a saved folder. Supposedly it also creates a Scheduled Task that springs to life when needed. It “uninstalls” by opening the program and disabling notifications regarding outbound connections to the web, after which the program folder supposedly can be deleted in its entirety. In case that doesn’t work, there is a separate .cmd file that can be used to disable the program. None of that worked for me, though at various points I saw various confirming messages mixed with error messages. This software is still beta and acts like it. All I can say is that I think I disabled it. I never did see evidence of a scheduled task.\n\nIn hope of finding a Windows Firewall add-on that would “learn” what rules to apply, I installed Windows Firewall Control, which is a product of Binisoft but also carries the Malwarebytes label. This one installs in the traditional manner and has a more useful interface and setup options, including a learning mode, which automatically creates “allow” rules for digitally signed programs and displays notifications only for unsigned programs. When you get a notification, the choices are more clearly explained. After a few initial notifications, things have settled down and are running normally. The plan will be to run it in learning mode awhile, then shift to the stricter “display notifications” mode, which displays a notification whenever an outbound connection is blocked, except for user-specified exceptions.\n\nSo the end result is that I continue to use Windows Firewall with a nifty little add-on that improves the interface.\n\nI have a question about adding a NoScript-type extension to my Opera browser. I am currently running Opera 66.0.3515.36 and after reading though this discussion, think that adding a such an extension might be a good idea. Has anyone had any experience with one they call SafeScript? It is an extension for Opera. Or is there an Opera version of one of the others that might be recommended?\n\nAlso as an update regarding 0patch…\n\nI’m interested in 0patch or any other third-party service that can supply security patches, but need to learn more.\n\n…some of those interested in 0patch may have seen Woody’s reference to it in his recent article in Computer World about it.\n\nTo add to that, I did email Mitja at 0patch to ask when the Win 7 EOS patches would be available from 0patch. His reply – also in the CW article was:\n\n“Post-EOS micropatches will become available as we become aware of vulnerabilities that: (1) affect Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2, (2) pose a high risk (see Which vulnerabilities does 0patch provide micropatches for?), and (3) we have a proof-of-concept or exploit for it so we can analyze it. Having access to the patched code (from Extended Security Updates) will help a lot but will not suffice to compensate for #3.\n\nThat said, we expect the first micropatches will be issued sometime after the February Patch Tuesday, after we have reviewed what was patched in Windows 7 ESU, and whether any other vulns might affect Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2. It may happen though that there will be no Win7/Srv2008 micropatches in any particular month based on the above-described criteria.”\n\nAs to getting the January patches, Mitja also said:\n\n” It is sub-optimal to use 0patch for Windows 7 security micropatches if you don’t have all official Windows 7 updated applied.”\n\nStill sorting through my other options for protecting my Win 7 laptop. Thanks for so much great advice.\n\nOn my current W7 SP1 system, I have 2 partitions, so that my data is on the 2nd one.\n\nI always set my systems up this way. Having separate partitions for data and system files means that if you need to restore the system setup, you don’t need to worry about whether you’ve managed to back up any personal data files that may have changed since the last system image, and the restore process will be much faster. It allows you just to restore what’s needed rather than nuking everything from orbit and starting over.\n\nBefore transitioning to the new laptop, would it be better to go to a 1-partition system so that I can image that 1 partition that would now have everything together (i.e., my data too after moving it)?\n\nI don’t think that would really help anything. As PKCano said, an image can contain any number of partitions within itself, so there’s no need to put it on one partition to image it all at once. Depending on how you have things set up, it may only be necessary to image the data partition, since the system partition will be a new OS, and you’ll be installing things anew into that. If some of the data is still on the system partition, you could either copy that to the data partition prior to imaging, to make it a simple one-step restore, or you could image the whole thing and restore the bits of data that are on the system partition on a file-by-file basis.\n\nSaid another way, what would be the best way to transition to the new laptop with all my data now resident under Windows 8.1?\n\nIf it were me, I’d make sure all the data you want to keep is on the data partition, image that, then use the backup software (whatever one you’re using) to restore that image to the new laptop, then point any shell folder references to that as necessary. Be sure not to overwrite the existing system partition, of course! If there is an existing, available partition already there, you can use that (change the size first if needed), or you can create a new one. The backup software probably will have that capability itself, without having to use anything else.\n\nCybertooth: “…one possible way to enhance your cybersecurity while continuing to use your Windows 7 system might be (in addition to those already listed) to use it for all purposes except email. ”\n\nQuite: I no longer patch Win 7 and do not use Windows 10 (to my profound relief), but have Linux in dual boot with Win 7 and also a Mac that is my actual workhorse. So I do not use the Win 7 browsers or the email client anymore. I have shifted that activity to those other two OS, one sharing the same PC, the other in another computer (and I can easily share files that my AV declares to be “clean” between macOS, Linux and Win 7). Neither system is perfectly safe, but believing that there can be “perfect” safety in anything is to embrace a delusion. “Safe enough” is good enough and I think this fairly describes my situation now.\n\nOn another security related issue: I also connect the PC to the router via an Ethernet cable instead of using WiFi, to avoid leaking over the air information to unknown parties. It helps that I always use the computers in the same room, at home, and very rarely and only for short periods get moved elsewhere.\n\nThanks for taking the time to advise us, at AskWoody, on how to stay relatively safe while still running Win 7.\n\nUmmm ->Error: Duplicate reply detected; it looks as though you’ve already said that.\n\nThat’s nice to know, but how ’bout a solution? Well, I guess I figured one out by myself.\n\n——————————————————————————————–\n\nI see this topic has been moribund since February and that the Bypass ESU scripts available at My Digital Life have been mentioned obliquely. Here at Woody’s there is at least one thread dedicated to the latter: https://www.askwoody.com/forums/topic/standalone-installer-script-for-windows-7-esu-regardless-the-license/\n\nJust for the record, I’d like to add that I’ve used the Bypass with 100% success every month from the very beginning (Feb 2020?). Though it sometimes requires a bit of fooling around, which in turns requires some Windows knowledge and experience, it works – or at least it has, month after month so far.\n\nAs for the problem some people appear to have with creating an account for My Digital Life, that’s up to you.\n\nAlso, someone commented that there’s lots and lots of “junk” postings on the My Digital Life page. I agree, but you really don’t have to read past the very first Bypass posting. It provides all the info you need.\n\nInterestingly to me, most of the postings in this thread were written before the ESU regime went into effect, and I guess the many helpful suggestions made will indeed contribute to your being able to “Keep Running Windows 7 Safely for Years to Come”. Having said this, I’d nonetheless contend that having access to a method that permits installation of the “real” M$ updates deserves consideration.\n\nIn closing, some members of this Forum have questioned the legality of the ESU Bypass. All I can say is that each of us lies alone in the grave or the crematorium urn."
