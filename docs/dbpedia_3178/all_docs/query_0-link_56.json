Macromedia Flash Player is a third party software application that also was redistributed with Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3, and Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. Each vulnerability is documented in the \"Vulnerability Details\" section of this bulletin. The Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11, issued September 12, 2006, describes the vulnerabilities and provides the download locations for customers who have installed Flash Player 7 and higher so that you can install the appropriate update based on the version of Flash Player you are using. Customers that have followed the guidance in the Adobe Security Bulletin are not at risk from these vulnerabilities.\n\nIf a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nWe recommend that customers apply the update immediately.\n\nSeverity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:\n\nVulnerability Identifiers Impact of Vulnerability Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640 Remote Code Execution Not applicable Critical Not applicable Not applicable\n\nNote Flash Player does not ship with Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. Customers who have installed Flash Player on these versions of Windows are encouraged to follow the guidance in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11.\n\nNote The severity ratings for non-x86 operating system versions map to the x86 operating systems versions as follows:\n\nThe Windows XP Professional x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows XP Service Pack 2 severity rating.\n\nThe Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 severity rating.\n\nThe Windows Server 2003 with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.\n\nThe Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition severity rating is the same as the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 severity rating.\n\nThis assessment is based on the types of systems that are affected by these vulnerabilities, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.\n\nWhy was this Bulletin revised on May 13, 2008?\n\nThis bulletin was revised to add Windows XP Service Pack 3 as affected software. This is a detection update only. There were no changes to the binaries, since the same update for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition applies to Windows XP Service Pack 3. Customers with Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition who have already installed the security update will not need to reinstall the update. Customers with Windows XP Service Pack 3 should apply the update immediately.\n\nIs Flash Player a Microsoft technology?\n\nNo. This software is made by Adobe Systems Inc., formerly Macromedia, Inc.\n\nIs MacromediaFlash Player redistributed by Microsoft?\n\nYes. Some versions of Flash Player have been redistributed by Microsoft. The supported versions of Windows that redistribute Flash Player are Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Service Pack 3, and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. No other supported versions of Windows redistribute Flash Player. Other software applications from Microsoft may also redistribute Macromedia Flash Player.\n\nNote that if you use the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer on Windows XP Professional x64 Edition you do not have MacromediaFlash Player available to you. The Macromedia Flash Player included with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is the 32-bit version.\n\nWhat updates does this release replace?\n\nThis security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.\n\nBulletin ID Windows 2000 Windows XP (all versions) Windows Server 2003 (all versions) MS06-020 Not applicable Replaced Not applicable\n\nWhich versions of the Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe are redistributed with Windows?\n\nMicrosoft Windows version Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe Filenames and Versions Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 Flash.ocx 6.0.79 Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Flash.ocx 6.0.79\n\nNoteÂ Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-020 was released on May 9, 2006 and provided updates for customers using these versions of Flash Player. Customers who do not use version 7, 8, or 9 of Flash Player would, if they have applied MS06-020, have version 6.0.84 of Flash Player.\n\nI use a version of Windows that is not listed in this table. Might I still have the Macromedia Flash Player installed on my system?\n\nYes. Flash Player is available for download from Adobe Systems, Inc. (formerly Macromedia, Inc). MacromediaFlash Player also may have been installed or required by another software application. You can determine whether you have Macromedia Flash Player installed and if so, determine what version by visiting the following Adobe Web site. If you have a version of Flash Player earlier than 7.0.65.0 or 8.0.33.0, you have a version that may be affected by the reported vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Adobe Security Bulletin discusses the vulnerabilities and provides the download locations so that you can install updated versions of Flash Player.\n\nNote If you do not have MacromediaFlash Player installed the Adobe Web site will prompt you to install the latest version of Macromedia Flash Player.\n\nI have a MacromediaFlash Player version earlier than version 7 on my system. What can I do?\n\nIf you are using any of the Windows versions called out in âWhich versions of the Flash Player are redistributed with Windows?â you can visit Windows Update to receive security updates for these versions of Windows. If you use any other supported Windows version, or if you are using Flash Player 7 and higher, you can visit the Adobe download center as called out under the affected software section of the Adobe security bulletin to install the update\n\nExtended security update support for Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 1a, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2002 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 1a, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Service Pack 1 ended on October 10, 2006. I am still using one of these operating systems; what should I do?\n\nWindows XP (all versions) Service Pack 1 has reached the end of its support life cycle.

When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ.\n\nCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?\n\nThe following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.\n\nProduct MBSA 1.2.1 Enterprise Scanning Tool (EST) MBSA 2.0 Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 No Yes Yes Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition No No Yes\n\nFor more information about MBSA, visit the MBSA Web site. For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660.\n\nFor more detailed information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723.\n\nWhat is the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST)?\n\nAs part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command-line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.\n\nCan I use a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?\n\nYes. Microsoft has created a version of EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of EST that is being released this month, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894193. SMS customers should review the following FAQ, âCan I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?\" for more information about SMS and EST.\n\nCan I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?\n\nThe following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.\n\nProduct SMS 2.0 SMS 2003 Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 Yes (With EST) Yes Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition No Yes\n\nSMS 2.0 and SMS 2003 Software Update Services (SUS) Feature Pack can use MBSA 1.2.1 for detection and therefore have the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA 1.2.1 does not detect.\n\nFor SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT), can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about SUIT, visit the following Microsoft Web site. For more information about the limitations of SUIT, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460. The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.\n\nFor SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates (ITMU) can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by Microsoft Update and that are supported by Windows Server Update Services. For more information about the SMS 2003 ITMU, visit the following Microsoft Web site. SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.\n\nFor more information about SMS, visit the SMS Web site.\n\nFor more detailed information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723.\n\nCan I use SMS to determine if the Macromedia Flash Player is installed on a system?\n\nYes. SMS can help detect if the Macromedia Flash Player is installed on a system. SMS can search for the existence of the file Flash.ocx. Flash.ocx version 6.0.84.0 or earlier may be vulnerable. This security update installs Flash6.ocx version 6.0.88.0 and removes the version of Flash.ocx it is replacing.\n\nVulnerability Details\n\nMacromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:\n\nSeveral remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe because of the way that it handles Flash Animation (SWF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by constructing a specially crafted Flash Animation (SWF) file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a Web site containing the specially crafted SWF file. The specially crafted SWF file could also be sent as an e-mail attachment. A user would only be at risk if opening this e-mail attachment. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.\n\nMitigating Factors for Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:\n\nCustomers that have followed the guidance in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11 are not at risk from the vulnerabilities.\n\nBy default, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 do not ship with Flash Player installed. However, customers that have installed a version of Macromedia Flash Player on these versions of Windows are encouraged to follow the guidance in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11.\n\nIn a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nThe Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit these vulnerabilities by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously. By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 has been installed.\n\nWorkarounds for Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:\n\nMicrosoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.\n\nTemporarily prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer for Windows XP Service Pack 2\n\nYou can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer. On Windows XP Service Pack 2 use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to disable the ActiveX control.\n\nStart Internet Explorer.\n\nOn the Tools menu, click Manage Add-ons.\n\nLocate and click on âShockwave Flash Objectâ.\n\nTo disable the add-on, click Disable, and then click OK.\n\nNote If you cannot locate the ActiveX control then use the drop-down box to switch from âAdd-ons currently being used in Internet Explorerâ to âAdd-ons that have been used by Internet Explorerâ and follow steps 3 and 4. If the ActiveX control is not present in this list you either have not used the ActiveX control before or it is not present on your system. See the workaround âTemporarily prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorerâ for additional information.\n\nFor more information on the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883256.\n\nImpact of Workaround: Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.\n\nTo regain functionality you need to use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to enable the ActiveX control.\n\nTemporarily prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer\n\nTemporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Flash Player ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.\n\nWarning If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.\n\nWe recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.\n\nUse the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Flash Player ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{1171A62F-05D2-11D1-83FC-00A0C9089C5A}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{D27CDB70-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}] \"Compatibility Flags\"=dword:00000400\n\nClose Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.\n\nFor detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797. Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.\n\nImpact of Workaround: Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.\n\nTo regain functionality you need to undo the kill bits for the Flash Player ActiveX control remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Flash Player ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.\n\nModify the Access Control List on the Flash Player ActiveX control to temporarily prevent it from running in Internet Explorer\n\nTo modify the Access Control List (ACL) on the Flash Player ActiveX control to be more restrictive, follow these steps:\n\nClick Start, click Run, type \"cmd\" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.\n\nType the following commands at a command prompt. Make a note of the current files ACLs, including inheritance settings. You may need this list if you have to undo these modifications:\n\ncacls %windir%\\system32\\Macromed\\Flash\\Flash.ocx\n\nType the following command at a command prompt to deny the âeveryoneâ group access to this file:\n\necho y|cacls %windir%\\system32\\Macromed\\Flash\\Flash.ocx /d everyone\n\nClose Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.\n\nImpact of Workaround: Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.\n\nTo regain functionality you need to undo the modifications to the Access Control List on the ActiveX control you have on your system.\n\nUn-register the Flash Player ActiveX Control\n\nTo un-register the Flash Player ActiveX control, follow these steps:\n\nClick Start, click Run, type \"regsvr32.exe /u %windir%\\system32\\Macromed\\Flash\\Flash.ocx\" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.\n\nA dialog box confirms that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box.\n\nClose Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.\n\nImpact of Workaround: Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.\n\nTo reregister the Flash Player ActiveX control, follow these steps:\n\nClick Start, click Run, type \"regsvr32.exe %windir%\\system32\\Macromed\\Flash\\Flash.ocx\" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.\n\nA dialog box confirms that the registration process has succeeded. Click OK to close the dialog box.\n\nClose Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.\n\nRestrict access to the Macromedia Flash folder by using a Software Restriction Policy\n\nTo restrict access to the Macromedia Flash folder (%windir%\\system32\\Macromed\\Flash\\) on Windows XP and later versions you can create a Software Restriction Policy. To create this policy, use a registry script or create a Group Policy setting to block the loading of the Flash Player ActiveX control.\n\nFor more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set\n\nWindows 2000 Group Policy\n\nGroup Policy in Windows Server 2003\n\nNote Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the \"Change Keys and Values\" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the \"Add and Delete Information in the Registry\" and \"Edit Registry Data\" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.\n\nWe recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.\n\nUse the following text to create a .reg file to restrict access to the Macromedia Flash folder. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Safer\\CodeIdentifiers] \"TransparentEnabled\"=dword:00000002\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Safer\\CodeIdentifiers\\0\\Paths\\{2742f840-c2d8-4eb3-a486-0a9d0879f29f}]\n\n\"LastModified\"=hex(b):10,c3,8a,19,c6,e3,c5,01\n\n\"Description\"=\"Block Macromedia Flash\"\n\n\"SaferFlags\"=dword:00000000\n\n\"ItemData\"=hex(2):25,00,77,00,69,00,6e,00,64,00,69,00,72,00,25,00,5c,00,73,00,\\\n\n79,00,73,00,74,00,65,00,6d,00,33,00,32,00,5c,00,6d,00,61,00,63,00,72,00,6f,\\\n\n00,6d,00,65,00,64,00,5c,00,66,00,6c,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,5c,00,2a,00,00,00\n\nChange your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet security zone and in the Local intranet security zone\n\nYou can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:\n\nIn Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the Tools menu.\n\nClick the Security tab.\n\nClick Internet, and then click Custom Level.\n\nUnder Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.\n\nClick Local intranet, and then click Custom Level.\n\nUnder Settings, in the ActiveX controls and plug-ins section, under Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins, click Prompt or Disable, and then click OK.\n\nClick OK two times to return to Internet Explorer.\n\nImpact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:\n\nRestrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.\n\nAfter you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.\n\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\nIn Internet Explorer, click Tools, click Internet Options, and then click the Security tab.\n\nIn the Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings box, click Trusted Sites, and then click Sites.\n\nIf you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone check box.\n\nIn the Add this Web site to the zone box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click Add.\n\nRepeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.\n\nClick OK two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.\n\nAdd any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are \"*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com\" and \"*.update.microsoft.com\" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.\n\nSet Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones\n\nYou can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.\n\nTo raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:\n\nOn the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click Internet Options.\n\nIn the Internet Options dialog box, click the Security tab, and then click the Internet icon.\n\nUnder Security level for this zone, move the slider to High. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.\n\nNote If no slider is visible, click Default Level, and then move the slider to High.\n\nNote Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.\n\nImpact of Workaround: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:\n\nRemove the Flash Player from your system\n\nIf you want to remove the Macromedia Flash Player, refer to the Adobe Flash Player Support FAQ for instructions.\n\nTo regain functionality you need install the current version of the MacromediaFlash Player ActiveX control from the Adobe Web site.\n\nFAQ for Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:\n\nWhat is the scope of the vulnerability?\n\nThese are remote code execution vulnerabilities. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nWhat causes the vulnerability?\n\nMemory corruptions when loading specially crafted SWF files in the Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe.\n\nWhat might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected system.\n\nHow could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?\n\nAn attacker could host a Web site containing the specially crafted SWF file that is designed to exploit one or more of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The specially crafted SWF file could also be sent as an e-mail attachment. A user would only be at risk if opening this e-mail attachment.\n\nWhat systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?\n\nWorkstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.\n\nWhat does the update do?\n\nThe update removes the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that the Flash Player handles Flash Animation (SWF) files.\n\nWhen this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities been publicly disclosed?\n\nMicrosoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. These vulnerabilities are also discussed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11.\n\nWhen this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these vulnerabilities were being exploited?\n\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities have been publicly used to attack customers.\n\nAffected Software:\n\nFor information about the specific security update for your affected software, click the appropriate link:\n\nWindows XP (all versions)\n\nPrerequisites This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 or a later version.
