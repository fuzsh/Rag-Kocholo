        "text": "by Stephanie Mialki in Landing Page Examples\n\nAdobe’s mission is to give everyone everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences. Adobe post-click landing pages throughout the entire marketing funnel — to increase brand awareness with reports and white papers, promote special events, sell a variety of membership plans and packages (and more) — all help make this possible.\n\nLet’s quickly review the post-click landing page basics and review six persuasive Adobe post-click landing pages that the company depends on to generate conversions.\n\nWhat is a post-click landing page?\n\nA post-click landing page is a standalone web page that uses persuasive elements — compelling headlines, engaging media, valuable social proof, attention-grabbing CTA buttons, etc. — to convince visitors to take action on a specific offer. That action could be to download a guide or ebook, register for an event or webinar, sign up for a free trial or demo, and more.\n\n6 Adobe post-click landing page examples\n\n(For shorter pages, we’ve displayed the entire page. For longer pages, we’ve only shown above the fold, so you’ll need to click through to the page to see some of the points we discuss. Also, some pages may be undergoing A/B testing with an alternate version than is displayed below.)\n\n1. Creative Cloud Plans\n\nA Google search for “Adobe Premiere” displayed this paid search ad:\n\nWhen search users click the ad headline or the “Buy Now” sitelink extension, they’re directed to a sales page where they can learn about the various Creative Cloud plans to select the one that’s best for them:\n\nWhat the page does well:\n\nMessage match between the ad (headline, display URL, and description text) and the post-click landing page ensure prospects they’re in the right place and can find what they’re looking for.\n\nA click-through design removes the lead capture form from the initial page, so visitors don’t immediately feel pressured to make a payment.\n\nThe numbered multi-step form, complete with section titles, breaks up the longer form into smaller sections to remove some of the post-click landing page friction.\n\nBullet points highlight the benefits of each package, without forcing visitors to read through excessive copy.\n\n“Special Offer” creates urgency by letting prospects know that this deal may not last forever, so they’re more likely to take advantage of it immediately.\n\nThe chat feature (“Let’s chat”) allows prospects to contact customer service. However, placing a live chat directly on the post-click landing page would make it more obvious and encourage visitors to utilize it.\n\nWhat could be changed and A/B tested:\n\nMany exit links — Adobe logo, “Sign In”, “Learn more about Creative Cloud”, footer links, and multiple links throughout the copy — make it easy for visitors to leave the page without purchasing.\n\nThe blue CTA buttons don’t stand out as much as they could because there’s blue throughout the entire page. Testing the buttons in a different color, like green, would make them more attention-grabbing.\n\nThe CTA button copy is vague. “Buy Now” doesn’t say much about each offer and isn’t persuasive enough. Instead, something like “I want this package!” is likely to entice more prospects because it would be specific to the bulleted points in each section.\n\nAdding social proof such as customer testimonials would let prospects know that other design professionals have had success with Adobe Creative Cloud, likely encouraging them to purchase a package as well.\n\nAdding an image or demo video would give visitors a better idea of what’s being offered, without having to read through more descriptive copy.\n\n2. Adobe Stock for Enterprise Free Trial\n\nSearching “Adobe Stock” produced this Google search ad:\n\nClicking the “Adobe Stock—Enterprise” sitelink takes prospects to this Adobe post-click landing page to sign up for a free trial:\n\nWhat the page does well:\n\nBoldening the primary benefit of the offer (50 free images) makes it stand out at the top of the body copy and entices visitors to keep reading.\n\nEncapsulating the form with slight color contrast helps draw attention to it.\n\nThe unchecked opt-in box gives visitors the option to be contacted to schedule a product demo, so only highly-interested prospects will be contacted.\n\nWhat could be changed and A/B tested:\n\nThe hyperlinked Adobe logo could potentially send visitors away the page before converting.\n\nThe blue CTA button would stand out more if it was a color that wasn’t already on the page, like green or yellow. Designing it bigger would also make it more attention-grabbing.\n\nThe CTA button copy, “Submit”, isn’t specific or persuasive. Changing it to something more descriptive and personalized, like “I want the free trial” would likely generate more clicks.\n\nExtensive fine print in the footer could intimidate visitors and deter them from converting.\n\nIncluding social proof, such as customer testimonials or company logos, would help visitors view Adobe Stock as a valuable program.\n\n3. Adobe MAX Conference\n\nAdobe advertising also consists of promoting upcoming events. Here’s an event post-click landing page that offers a discount on the cost of Adobe MAX — The Creativity Conference registration:\n\nWhat the page does well:\n\nThe background image appears to be a photo from the 2017 MAX conference, providing visitors with an idea of what this year’s conference will be like.\n\nThe headline, “Sign up & Save”, immediately provides visitors with an incentive to sign up for the conference.\n\nEssential event details (title, dates, and location) listed above the fold make it easier for visitors to spot them immediately.\n\nHighlighting that there’s no financial obligation at this point increases the chances of prospects signing up.\n\nThree form-fields makes it quick and easy for visitors to complete the form.\n\nWhat could be changed and A/B tested:\n\nHeader and footer exit links could distract visitors and take them away from the page without redeeming the offer.\n\nThe blue CTA button doesn’t stand out at all because it’s the exact same color as the background.\n\n“Submit” doesn’t serve well as the CTA button copy because it’s vague and impersonal. Testing more enticing copy, like “Save my spot” or “I want the discount”, would likely generate more conversions.\n\nAdding a countdown timer to indicate the time remaining would add a sense of urgency and help encourage prospects to sign up faster.\n\nThe expired 2017 copyright date might cause visitors to question the validity of this offer.\n\n4. Gartner’s 2017 Magic Quadrant Report\n\nAdobe digital marketing was named a Leader in Gartner’s 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs. This post-click landing page encourages people to download the report to see for themselves:\n\nWhat the page does well:\n\nA two-step opt-in form reduces post-click landing page friction because it allows visitors to learn about the offer before having to complete a form.\n\nMultiple arrows pointing down the center of the page serve as both directional cues and anchor tags, providing for an optimal user experience. These also persuade prospects to see what Adobe wants them to. In this case a short description of where (and why) Adobe stands on the Marketing Quadrant, multiple forms of social proof, the Magic Quadrant image, benefits of Adobe, and a CTA button.\n\nThe sticky bar allows the CTA button to always be visible and ready to click.\n\nThe CTA button copy is action-oriented and tells prospects what they’ll be getting by clicking.\n\nAmple social proof — Ellen Lee’s testimonial, company logos, statistics, etc. — show prospects that Adobe is a trustworthy brand that delivers other companies much success.\n\nWhite space throughout the entire page makes it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to navigate.\n\nThe Magic Quadrant image provides visitors with a visual of where Adobe stands in comparison to other brands.\n\nWhat could be changed and A/B tested:\n\nThe Adobe logo is linked to the company’s homepage, immediately providing visitors with an escape route from this.\n\nThe CTA button color doesn’t stand out because of the monochromatic color scheme.\n\nThe social media buttons and CMO link could distract visitors and send them away from the page before downloading the report.\n\n5. 2017 Digital Trends Report\n\nThis Adobe post-click landing page was also created to generate report downloads. This one came from a link in an Adobe blog post:\n\nWhat the page does well:\n\nA captivating headline lures visitors in without giving away too much information.\n\nMinimal body copy then provides prospects with more information about the report, without overwhelming them with excess text.\n\nBulleted copy makes it easy to scan the key takeaways from the report.\n\nEncapsulating the form helps it stand out a little more and draw attention.\n\nThe blue CTA button “pops” because it contrasts well with the rest of the page. However it could be larger to be even more visible.\n\nThe unchecked opt-in box let’s prospects decide for themselves to be contacted about a product demo, ensuring that only sincerely interested people are contacted.\n\nWhat could be changed and A/B tested:\n\nThe hyperlinked Adobe logo could potentially send visitors away from the page before they get a chance to download the report.\n\n14 form fields is too many for a post-click landing page in the awareness stage of the buyer’s journey, and is likely to deter prospects from completing it.\n\nThe “Submit” CTA button copy is vague, and should be changed to something more specific, like “Show Me the Report!”\n\nThe page is unbalanced. Adding an image of the report underneath the body copy would help balance it out and provide visitors with a preview of the content.\n\n6. Adobe Captivate White Paper\n\nThis last Adobe post-click landing page example came from an organic Google search result for “Adobe white paper”:\n\nWhat the page does well:\n\nNo exit links (aside from a privacy policy) makes it so visitors can only leave the page by clicking the “X” in the top right corner, or downloading the white paper.\n\nThe headline is both descriptive and benefit-oriented.\n\nSmall chunks of copy make the page aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate without overwhelming people.\n\nWhat could be changed and A/B tested:\n\nToo many font styles makes the page look chaotic, and not professional and uniform like it should.\n\n10 form fields may intimidate prospects who are only in the awareness stage of the marketing funnel.\n\nThe orange CTA button would “pop” more if it was a contrasting, complementary color, like green.\n\n“Submit” on the CTA button isn’t very persuasive. Something specific and personalized, like “Send me the White Paper”, would likely produce better results.\n\nAdding the white paper’s cover page or an Adobe Captivate software image would help compel visitors to download the white paper.\n\nWere you inspired by any of these Adobe post-click landing pages?\n\nAdobe recognizes the importance of using optimized, dedicated post-click landing pages to increase the overall success of their marketing and advertising campaigns.
