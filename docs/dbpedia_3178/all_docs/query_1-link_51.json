We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (âAIâ).\n\nThe way individuals and organizations use and interact with technology continues to evolve. A personâs experience with technology increasingly spans a multitude of devices and becomes more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. We believe a new technology paradigm is emerging that manifests itself through an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge where computing is more distributed, AI drives insights and acts on the userâs behalf, and user experiences span devices with a userâs available data and information. We continue to transform our business to lead this new era of digital transformation and enable our customers and partners to thrive in this evolving world.\n\nWhat we offer\n\nFounded in 1975, we operate worldwide in over 190 countries. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peopleâs lives. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\n\nOur products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories, that integrate with our cloud-based offerings. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.\n\nThe ambitions that drive us\n\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\n\nReinvent productivity and business processes.\n\nBuild the intelligent cloud platform.\n\nCreate more personal computing.\n\nReinvent productivity and business processes\n\nWe believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of productivity, communication, and information products and services that span platforms and devices. Productivity is our first and foremost objective, to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily, and to effectively express ideas in new ways. We invent new scenarios that in turn create opportunity for our partners and help businesses accelerate their digital transformation while respecting each personâs privacy choices.\n\nThe foundation for these efforts rests on advancing our leading productivity, collaboration, communication, and business process tools including Microsoft Office, Microsoft Dynamics, and LinkedIn. With Office 365, we provide familiar industry-leading productivity and business process tools as cloud services, enabling access from anywhere and any device. New scenarios â like those enabled by Microsoft Teams â will redefine how work gets done and help foster employee engagement and culture. This work creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers. We see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are mobile, secure, collaborative, intelligent, and trustworthy. We offer our services across platforms and devices outside our own. As people move from device to device, so does their content and the richness of their services. We engineer our applications so users can find, try, and buy them in friction-free ways.\n\nOn December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation, the worldâs largest professional network on the Internet. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn.\n\nBuild the intelligent cloud platform\n\nCloud computing is foundational to enabling any organizationâs digital transformation. In deploying technology that advances business strategy, enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive, collaborative, and satisfied, and connect with customers in new and compelling ways. Enterprises work to unlock business insights from a world of data. To achieve these objectives, they increasingly look to leverage the benefits of the cloud. Helping businesses digitally transform and move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities. As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength. The Microsoft Cloud is a secure solution that can listen, learn, and predict; turning data into actionable insight that enhances business opportunities. It provides a scalable and complete collaboration suite that transforms the way teams work. With the cloud, high-performance computing and agility can help businesses expand their growth.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: larger datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; larger datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nWe believe our server products and cloud services, which include Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and Microsoft Azure, make us the only company with a public, private, and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business. What differentiates Azure is our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, and software-as-a-service (âSaaSâ) application integration. In addition, our hybrid infrastructure spans identity, data, compute, management, and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprise-focused SaaS partners. We are working to enhance the customerâs return on investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure. Businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter, a partnerâs datacenter, or in our datacenters with common security, management, and administration across all environments, providing the flexibility and scale they want. AI will be pervasive across devices, applications, and infrastructure to drive insights and act on the userâs behalf. Azure is also unique in its support for emerging applications so that Internet of Things (âIoTâ) devices can act locally at the edge while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale.\n\nWe enable organizations to securely adopt SaaS applications, both our own and third-party, and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure. We continue to innovate with higher-level services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices, rich data storage and analytics services, machine learning services, media services, web and mobile backend services, and developer productivity services. To foster a rich developer ecosystem, our platform is extensible, enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions, achieving even more value. This strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services.\n\nCreate more personal computing\n\nWe strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Windows 10 is the cornerstone of our ambition to create more personal computing, allowing us to move from an operating system that runs on a PC to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices. Windows 10 is more personal and productive with functionality such as Cortana, Windows Hello, Windows Ink, Microsoft Edge, and universal applications. Windows 10 offers a foundation for the secure, modern workplace. Windows 10 is designed to foster innovation â from us, our partners, and developers â through rich and consistent experiences across the range of existing devices and entirely new device categories.\n\nOur ambition for Windows 10 is to broaden our economic opportunity through three key levers: an original equipment manufacturer (âOEMâ) ecosystem that creates exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10; our own commitment to the health and profitability of our first-party premium device portfolio; and monetization opportunities such as services, subscriptions, gaming, and search advertising. Our OEM partners are investing in an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations for Windows 10. We now have the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.\n\nWith the unified Windows operating system, developers and OEMs can contribute to a thriving Windows ecosystem. We invest heavily to make Windows the most secure, manageable, and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce. We are working to create a broad developer opportunity by unifying the Windows installed base on Windows 10, and by enabling universal Windows applications to run across all device targets.\n\nAs part of our strategic objectives, we are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We are developing new input and output methods within Windows 10, including speech, pen, gesture, and mixed reality capabilities to power more personal computing experiences. The experiences and tools we build will unlock the creator in everyone and enable seamless teamwork not just in the workplace, but also at school and at home across all the devices people use.\n\nOur future opportunity\n\nCustomers are looking to Microsoft and our thriving partner ecosystem to accelerate their own digital transformations and to unlock new opportunity in this era of intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers, including offerings like the recently introduced Microsoft 365 which brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility and Security, that empower users to be creative and work together while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:\n\nTransforming the workplace to deliver new modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n\nBuilding and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals, including converting data into AI.\n\nUsing Windows to develop new categories of devices â both our own and third-party â as a personâs experience with technology becomes more natural, personal, and predictive with multi-sensory breakthroughs in voice, ink, gaze interactions, and augmented reality holograms.\n\nInventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games, using an approach that enables people to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\nApplying AI to drive insights and act on our customerâs behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.\n\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements.\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\nProductivity and Business Processes\n\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nOffice Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and Microsoft Teams, and related Client Access Licenses (âCALsâ).\n\nOffice Consumer, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.\n\nLinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.\n\nDynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP on-premises, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM.\n\nOffice Commercial\n\nOffice Commercial is designed to increase personal, team, and organizational productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets such as security, analytics, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing, including Software Assurance, and the number of information workers in an enterprise, as well as the continued shift to Office 365. CALs provide certain Office Commercial products and services with access rights to our server products and CAL revenue is reported with the associated Office products and services.\n\nOffice Consumer\n\nOffice Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift to Office 365. Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn connects the worldâs professionals to make them more productive and successful, and is the worldâs largest professional network on the Internet. LinkedIn offers services that can be used by customers to transform the way they hire, market, sell, and learn. In addition to LinkedInâs free services, LinkedIn offers three categories of monetized solutions: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions is comprised of two elements: Hiring, and Learning and Development. Hiring provides services to recruiters that enable them to attract, recruit, and hire talent. Learning and Development provides subscriptions to enterprises and individuals to access online learning content. Marketing Solutions enables companies to advertise to LinkedInâs member base. Premium Subscriptions enables professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. Premium Subscriptions also includes Sales Solutions, which helps sales professionals find, qualify, and create sales opportunities and accelerate social selling capabilities. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.\n\nDynamics\n\nDynamics provides on-premises and cloud-based business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning (âERPâ), customer relationship management (âCRMâ), supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications for enterprises.\n\nCompetition\n\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors such as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite.

Salesforce.comâs cloud CRM offerings compete with our Dynamics CRM on-premises and Dynamics 365 offerings.\n\nIntelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nServer products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, and Azure.\n\nEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\n\nServer Products and Cloud Services\n\nOur server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Server products and cloud services revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product.\n\nAzure is a scalable cloud platform with computing, networking, storage, database, and management, along with advanced services such as analytics, and comprehensive solutions such as Enterprise Mobility Suite. Azure includes a flexible platform that helps developers build, deploy, and manage enterprise, mobile, web, and IoT applications, for any platform or device without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software.\n\nEnterprise Services\n\nEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.\n\nWe compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\n\nOur database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.\n\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.\n\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and open source offerings. Azureâs competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities.\n\nOur Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.\n\nMore Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across all devices. This segment primarily comprises:\n\nWindows, including Windows OEM licensing (âWindows OEMâ) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows IoT; and MSN display advertising.\n\nDevices, including Microsoft Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices.\n\nGaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising Xbox Live transactions, subscriptions, and advertising (âXbox Liveâ), video games, and third-party video game royalties.\n\nSearch advertising.\n\nWindows\n\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\n\nThe mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n\nDifferences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets.\n\nAttachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n\nCustomer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\n\nChanges in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n\nPricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.\n\nPiracy.\n\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Revenue from Windows cloud services, such as Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and other Windows commercial offerings, is mainly impacted by attachment of Windows to devices shipped, pricing changes and promotions, mix of computing devices, and the customer mix among large enterprises, small and medium businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings.\n\nWindows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.\n\nDisplay advertising primarily includes MSN ads. In June 2015, we entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to outsource our display sales responsibility.\n\nDevices\n\nWe design, manufacture, and sell devices, including Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices, such as Surface Hub and HoloLens. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. We released the Surface Studio in December 2016 and our latest Surface devices, the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, in June 2017.\n\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. In November 2016, we completed the sale of our feature phone business.\n\nGaming\n\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment using our devices, peripherals, applications, online services, and content. We released Xbox One and Xbox One S in November 2013 and August 2016, respectively, and announced Xbox One X in June 2017. With the launch of the Windows 10 Xbox app in July 2015, and the launch of the Mixer service in May 2017, we continue to open new opportunities for customers to engage both on- and off-console. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox Live is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox Live revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of Xbox Live enabled content, as well as advertising. We also design and sell gaming content to showcase our unique platform capabilities for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Growth of our gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox Live enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals.\n\nSearch Advertising\n\nSearch advertising, including Bing and Bing Ads, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Oath (formerly Yahoo! and AOL) which is owned by Verizon, through which we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings.\n\nCompetition\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, hardware, and phone manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nOur gaming platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers. The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released its latest generation console in March 2017 and Sony released its latest generation console in November 2013. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our video games competitors include Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Xbox Live faces competition from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, and Google.\n\nOur search advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.\n\nWe sold our feature phone business in November 2016, which included the sale of our phone manufacturing facility in Vietnam.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nDuring fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, research and development expense was $13.0 billion, $12.0 billion, and $12.0 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 14%, 14%, and 13% of revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts.\n\nProduct and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\nOffice Product Group, focuses on our business across productivity, communications, education, and other information applications and services.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Research, focuses on our AI development and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search.\n\nCloud and Enterprise, focuses on our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n\nWindows and Devices Group, focuses on our Windows platform, applications, games, store, and devices that power the Windows ecosystem.\n\nLinkedIn, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.\n\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 66,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 35,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licenseesâ or Microsoftâs products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community.\n\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\n\nInvesting in the Future\n\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, and hardware operating systems.\n\nWhile our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, India, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company.\n\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the worldâs largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation.\n\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\n\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.\n\nOEMs\n\nWe distribute our software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\nDirect\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (âEnterprise Agreement Software Advisorsâ, or âESAâ). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also provide commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our online portals, marketplaces, and retail stores.\n\nDistributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (âLSPâ), distributors, value-added resellers (âVARâ), OEMs, and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.\n\nOur Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support.\n\nLICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and Software Assurance. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\n\nSoftware Assurance conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Software Assurance is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.\n\nVolume Licensing Programs\n\nEnterprise Agreement\n\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. Software Assurance is included.\n\nMicrosoft Product and Services Agreement\n\nMPSAs are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. Software Assurance is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses.\n\nOpen\n\nOpen Licensing agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open Licensing agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open License program, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and Software Assurance is optional. Under Open Value programs, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and Software Assurance is included.\n\nSelect Plus\n\nSelect Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and Software Assurance is optional.\n\nIn July 2014, we announced the retirement over a two-year period of Select Plus agreements for commercial organizations. Beginning July 2015, no new Select Plus agreements were signed with commercial organizations. Starting in July 2016, we no longer accept orders from commercial organizations for Select Plus after their next agreement anniversary.\n\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web, through the Microsoft Online Subscription Program. The program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.\n\nPartner Programs\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, hosting partner, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.\n\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption.\n\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.\n\nCUSTOMERS\n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016, or 2015. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of June 30, 2017, we employed approximately 124,000 people on a full-time basis, 73,000 in the U.S. and 51,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 39,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 40,000 were in product research and development; 34,000 were in sales and marketing; and 11,000 were in general and administration. The acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation resulted in the addition of approximately 11,000 people in fiscal year 2017. Certain of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nOur Internet address is www.microsoft.com. At our Investor Relations website, www.microsoft.com/investor, we make available free of charge a variety of information for investors. Our goal is to maintain the Investor Relations website as a portal through which investors can easily find or navigate to pertinent information about us, including:\n\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with or furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ).\n\nInformation on our business strategies, financial results, and metrics for investors.\n\nAnnouncements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available.\n\nPress releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news.\n\nCorporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of conduct and ethics, global corporate social responsibility initiatives, and other governance-related policies.\n\nOther news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting.\n\nOpportunities to sign up for email alerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time.\n\nThe information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website.\n\nDiscussion & Analysis\n\nMANAGEMENTâS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following Managementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (âMD&Aâ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (âAIâ). We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peopleâs lives. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\n\nWe generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\n\nHighlights* from fiscal year 2017 included:\n\nCommercial cloud annualized revenue run rate** exceeded $18.9 billion.\n\nOffice Commercial revenue grew 6%, driven by Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 46%.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue grew 14%, and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 27.0 million.\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics revenue grew 9%, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 78%.\n\nLinkedIn contributed revenue of $2.3 billion.\n\nServer products and cloud services revenue grew 13%, driven by Microsoft Azure revenue growth of 99%.\n\nEnterprise Services revenue decreased 2%, driven by a decline in revenue from custom support agreements, offset in part by higher revenue from Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\n\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (âWindows OEMâ) revenue increased 3%.\n\nWindows Commercial revenue grew 5%, driven by multi-year agreement revenue.\n\nMicrosoft Surface revenue decreased 2%, driven by a reduction in volumes sold, offset in part by a higher mix of premium devices.\n\nSearch advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, grew 9%.\n\nGaming revenue decreased slightly, driven by lower Xbox hardware revenue, offset in part by growth in Xbox software and services.\n\nHighlights are presented based on segment results.\n\nCommercial cloud annualized revenue run rate is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by twelve for Office 365 commercial, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties.\n\nOn December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. LinkedIn has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. See Note 9 â Business Combinations in the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nIn November 2016, we completed the sale of our feature phone business for $350 million.\n\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. Our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016 and 2017.\n\nIndustry Trends\n\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the userâs choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow oneâs career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, 2016, and 2017, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.\n\nSee a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2017 Form 10-K.\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.\n\nReportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (âU.S. GAAPâ), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. We have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 21 â Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements.\n\nSUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2017 2016 2015 Percentage\n\nChange 2017\n\nVersus 2016 Percentage\n\nChange 2016\n\nVersus 2015 Revenue $ 89,950 $ 85,320 $ 93,580 5% (9)% Gross margin 55,689 52,540 60,542 6% (13)% Operating income 22,326 20,182 18,161 11% 11% Diluted earnings per share 2.71 2.10 1.48 29% 42%\n\nFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016\n\nRevenue increased $4.6 billion or 5%, driven by growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, offset in part by lower revenue from More Personal Computing.

Diluted EPS was $2.10 for fiscal year 2016. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 and impairment and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in diluted EPS of $0.69.\n\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\n\nRevenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. Windows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from Search advertising and Gaming. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise Services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in Office and Dynamics revenue.\n\nOperating income increased $2.0 billion or 11%, primarily due to a decrease in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased $8.0 billion or 13%, driven by the decline in revenue as discussed above, and included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.3 billion or 5%. Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing gross margin decreased, offset in part by higher gross margin from Intelligent Cloud.\n\nKey changes in expenses were:\n\nCost of revenue decreased $258 million or 1%, mainly due to a reduction in phone sales, driven by the change in strategy for the phone business, offset in part by growth in commercial cloud and Search advertising.\n\nImpairment, integration, and restructuring expenses decreased $8.9 billion, primarily driven by prior year goodwill and asset impairment charges related to our phone business and restructuring charges associated with our phone business restructuring plans.\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $1.0 billion or 6%, driven by a reduction in phone expenses and a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%.\n\nDiluted EPS was $2.10 for fiscal year 2016.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2017, our U.S. income before income taxes was $453 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $22.7 billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2017 U.S. income before income taxes by $6.4 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $317 million.

This increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits.\n\nWhile we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15% and 34%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries including the impact of net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year 2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion.
