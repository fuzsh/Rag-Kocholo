This does not work but in all of the computers.\n\nAll computers are under Windows 7 Professional, 64 bits, MS Office 2010 Home and Office, all mice are Microsoft, can't remember the exact model, they are like the one in this image, regular optical mouse:\n\nI installed the MS software Intellipoint, and in some computers works (dragging the slides) and in some others don't. I just wanted to know if there's a known update to make this work or if I have to activate it somewhere?"
