Was the unit you tried 512MB? Apps in Rosetta (Office for example) need more RAM than universal binaries. With 1GB or 2GB ram, the jerkiness will go away. I find that Office is slower to launch, but once launched it seems to run just as fast as on a previous high-end PowerBook.\n\nIf that's your only concern, then add more RAM and it will be fine. The MacBook is really far more powerful and has a better display than the 12\" PowerBook.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: BarryXSharp\n\nUser level: Level 5\n\n7,918 points\n\nAdrian:\n\nI agree with you about inserting images (1MB and up) into PP presentations and wanting to move them about and/or resize them. I have same problem with this and I have Black MacBook with 1gig Apple memory (2x 512MB sticks). It's not smooth and is time consuming. I'm using Office 2004 for Mac - Standard Edition.\n\nI compared same operation on my 2x 2.5GHz PowerMac G5 with a 25MB image and it had no problems like I see on the MacBook.\n\nI monitured PP's resident memory while manipulating the 2MB image on the MacBook using Top.app and what I saw was that each time I moved the image about in the PP presentation the PP's resident memory jumped immediately by as much as 10MB and sometimes 20MB. Now if your system's RAM was already close to being fully subscribed then this activity will get slowed down some as system has to find memory allocations for PP's activity. This maybe is your problem. However, in my case I had plenty of memory available for PP to do its work and it was still a little jerky but really not that bad.\n\nIt could be the graphics feature of the MacBook that's slowing things down.\n\nCan I live with this - well yes I can as I don't do this type of PP stuff that much - I simply wanted to confirm your observation or not and post back to you as I have 1gig in my Black MacBook.\n\nIt does pay to evaluate the real machine as you've done before laying your money on the table.\n\nI have no clue as to when $MS PP will go UB.\n\nGood luck.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Thayne Miller\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n34 points\n\num.... ever heard of keynote? It's already Universal and 10^8 times better than powerpoint. Oh, and did I mention that it reads/writes powerpoint files as well? Seriously man, take a look, it's definitely worth it. Every time I give a keynote presentation at my university; I always get lots of compliments at how smooth the transitions are and how professional the themes look. I just got tired of powerpoint's \"white text on bright blue background\" crap. Honestly, it's one of the best products apple has ever produced, in my opinion.\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: GeeKay\n\nUser level: Level 4\n\n3,548 points\n\nHere's another plug for Keynote.\n\nI'm an old-school, index-card type of lecturer. But the kids these days, they all expect eye candy. So, during the past four months, I've given two \"PowerPoint\" lectures. Both of them were created using Keynote.\n\nI actually tried PowerPoint first, and found its interface to be as clunky as just about any other Windows application. (Word for Macintosh being a pleasant exception.) Then, I decided to fire up the Keynote demo that came with my Mini. I instantly loved it, and immediately bought it.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: spvnnn\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n34 points\n\nyup i tottally agree that keynote's a much better choice.. it's cleaner, like most other apple apps, and of course faster.. and since you can export your keynote presentation to ppt format, i dont see what's the problem.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: GeeKay\n\nUser level: Level 4\n\n3,548 points\n\nAdrian...\n\nDefinitely give Keynote a try. I think you'll find that you love it!\n\nGood luck with your next presentation!\n\nCheers,\n\nGeeKay\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Thayne Miller\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n34 points\n\nkeynote is a universal binary (as are most, if not all, apple apps now), so it will run on both the macbook and the 12\" powerbook. You win either way. =) Trust me, once you try keynote, you'll never go back. It actually makes creating presentations kind of fun! keynote also comes bundled with Pages, a document creation program. I have equal affinity for this app as well and I use it entirely in replace of Microsoft Word.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Mk Gonda\n\nUser level: Level 2\n\n375 points\n\nLike all tools it is what you get used to using.\n\nI have the exact problem with Office and especially with PowerPoint. Yes I have tried using Keynote and Open Office (both UB) and they both have export formatting problems. So much so that if the other people who need the file are on Powerpoint, it is essentially useless. Most of my files have embedded datasets, objects, geometric graphics and images. Transitions and animations are least of my worries for business purposes.\n\nInstead, I have resolved to using Office on XP partition - and will look forward to UB version of Office when released.\n\nAs for CS3, Adobe will be releasing Lightroom by the end of the year in UB so for my needs, there is no hurry on that. Based on Beta release, its promising for digital photo processing. Clearly CS2 is far more capable than just photo development so YMMV...\n\nMac OS X (10.4.6)\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: FlunkedFlank\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n80 points\n\n- Spotlight was even finding files I created!\n\nProgress indeed.\n\nJust for the record, and sorry if I'm making an obvious point, but that's simply how Spotlight works. It's not just an indexer that runs in the background (which would make it no better than a myriad of other such tools). It actually hooks into the kernel and by definition indexes files at the moment they are saved or modified. Very elegant technology indeed, but that wasn't related to the speed of the machine or anything.\n\nAlumBook 15\" Mac OS X (10.3.9) MacBook 1.83Mhz Mac OS X (10.4.6)\n\nLink"
