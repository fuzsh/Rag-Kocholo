        "text": "CS3 is very old it was a very good release of Photoshop but most likely a new version of Photoshop Elements would be a better choice to us. Adorner took down the CS3 Activation servers. They made a new download available that does not require activation for their old users. You need to enter your CS3 serial to be able to download it. Activation or connection error when starting CS3 or Acrobat 8\n\nJJMack\n\nI think I must be missing something. I'm following your link and it mentions a new installer, but when I sign in, all I get is a link to get a new serial number which I've already done. This might be me not understanding some terminology.\n\nOnce you've successfully entered your old CS3 serial number via this screen:\n\nyou should see the screenshot below which includes new download links at the bottom in Section 3.\n\nIf that's not what you see, please post a screenshot of what you do see.\n\nThis is all a lot of sh#t! it's a never ending loop of perpetuating Adobe persuasion to make you subscribe to the CC!!!! I spent hundreds of $$$$ buying this software only eight years ago. Yes this maybe an eternity in software world, however we had no inkling back then that this would be the case today....grrrr! Adobe should take more responsibility on this and issue an alternative.\n\nDirecting users to this forum IS NOT AN ALTERNATIVE ADOBE!!!!!\n\nAn alternative for what?\n\nI get that you are frustrated but this non-activation CS3 process IS the alternative for those who want to hang on to their ancient software and don't want the Cloud.\n\nIf Adobe did not provide this new non-activation serial number process which you can use forever then you would be left with nothing.\n\nYes but it doesn't work. I have followed all of Adobe's instructions trying to get CS3 reinstalled and working again but it just keeps saying 'Activation - No Connection' on launch. Your point that people should do away with legacy applications and update is beside the point - Adobe are offering a process that doesn't work and is frustrating people like me who spent many hundreds £ on the software 7/8 years ago, expecting that we would have access to it for life. Not being fobbed off to unhelpful forums or being told on the phone that we need to purchase an expensive monthly package for the rest of our lives.\n\nReally terrible way to treat people who have made this company extremely wealthy. Basically upgrade or p*$s off, is the attitude I have experienced from their staff today.\n\nI had the same problem installing CS3 on my new mac. I tried what adobe recommended but with no success and had the same problems that you are having. The way to get it working is to back up all your files and reformat the hard drive wiping off everything ( there is a hidden file somewhere that keeps the old serial number for the old version of CS3 which is causing the problem ).\n\nThen after you reboot go back to Adobe and get the new serial number and download their “new” version of CS3 and instal it using the new serial number. It will work. When asked to register go to Never Register. It will then work. Then you will have to reinstall your old files and apps from the the back up. Boring but it worked for me. Good luck.\n\nThanks for your response. I only use Photoshop these days - and I only use it to crop images for clients' websites. This all seems like a lot of hassle just to access a bit of software to do this simple task. So looks like I'll have to put up with Gimp until I can find a better solution. Thanks anyway, I might consider that on a rainy Sunday some time.\n\nHi James,\n\nSee if you have the cache.db file in the folder below.\n\n'Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Adobe/Adobe PCD/cache/'\n\nI can't remember if that is a hidden folder or not so you might need to turn on visibility for all files and folders.\n\nIf it is there delete cache.db. Try to start Photoshop and you should be prompted for the serial number at which point enter the new one. Click on Never Register.\n\nThen Restart your computer. Hopefully that will work.\n\nHi James,\n\nglad it worked-I was pretty certain it would as I've answered the question quite a few times now. Just a quick tip if you have a problem it's a good idea to start a new question in the forum and not bury your question away in an old thread like this one which started back in October\n\nOk, First, thanks for all the tips here. I've been doing everything I can to keep using my CS3.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing has worked.\n\nAt no point have I come across something that asked me to enter the new serial number that was given on the web page.\n\nI tried the cleaner (3rd time now) and have tried to re install CS3 per the link that was provided with no luck. It gets about 5%ish into the install and locks up. It's not the machine. It more than meets the requirements for pretty much anything.\n\nThe \"Support Chat\" was.... less than expectations.\n\nSo, if there are any other suggestions out there, I'd sure appreciate them!\n\nAt this point, I'm really wondering how big Shantanu Narayen's yacht needs to be!\n\nI have the exact same loop problem! I've tried to find the file to delete as Terri suggests, but it's no longer there, because I've un-installed/re-installed/ downloaded the installer with the new serial number... like 3 times now. Still does not work. I will try to install original software from the $600+ disc again and see if cache file is there so I can delete it. Fingers crossed."
