        "text": "Social videos are convincing, and they resonate with users; this is good news.\n\nMany brands, however, still struggle to create high-quality, professional videos that they can share on social media as a strong representation of their brand.\n\nBut with the incredible technology available today, we have more resources than ever before to make this task more manageable.\n\nWe wrote this post for the first time in 2016; it included only five video editing apps. We updated it last year, adding six new (at that time) apps. But a lot has changed and improved since then– including some of the apps we’d initially written about!\n\nIn this update, we’re going to look at 16 of the best video apps and software for 2018 that will cover all your video editing needs, along with some best social video practices.\n\nSocial video has never been so much essential to online marketing.\n\nIt’s automatically more engaging and dynamic than plain-text posts or even posts with images, meaning it can more effortlessly grab a users’ attention.\n\nVideos can also be more persuasive marketing tools.\n\nThis is backed up by statistics, which show that:\n\n65% of senior marketing executives believe that visual assets (including video) are essential to how their brand story is communicated\n\nCustomers would be 4x more likely to watch a video about a product instead of reading about it\n\nMobile social video views have skyrocketed each year; by 2020, it’s expected that 75% of mobile traffic will be video views\n\nViewers will retail about 95% of a message after watching it through video, as opposed to just 10% when reading the same message in text form.\n\nThe video editing apps and tools on this list offer a wide range of different features.\n\nSome are excellent video editors, while others have unique peculiarities like the ability to create incredible time-lapse videos or play with 50’s inspired comedy reels.\n\nWe selected both mobile apps and professional-quality desktop editors, and different price ranges (from free to a few hundred dollars).\n\nBetween these 16 tools, you’ll be able to create every video you’ve ever dreamed of, even if you have little to no experience.\n\n1. FilmoraGo\n\nFilmora is known for its incredible video editing software, so it’s no surprise that their video editing app FilmoraGo maintains that high standard.\n\nThis app allows you to trim a video clip, create subtitles and text, speed up the content, add filters, and add overlays.\n\nYou can add music to the video, which will play in the background. You can also add different themes, like a Charlie Chaplin theme, which adds relevant visual effects and, in some cases, music.\n\nFilmoraGo is free but has in-app purchases you can choose from. It’s available for both iOS and Android, and it’s easily one of the best video editing apps out there.\n\n2. Magisto\n\nMagisto is an easy-to-use editing app. Their goal is to turn images and videos into stories in just a few seconds. This app can enhance your videos in a few quick clicks.\n\nOnce you choose an image or video, you’ll select an “editing style,” with options including real estate, memories, storyteller, dance, and more.\n\nEach will come with music suggestions, but you can add your own music from your library or get music for commercial use. It combines these features with your video to help you achieve the effect that you were going for, giving your video an extra added touch.\n\nMagisto is free for both iOS and Android users, though they have a business plan that allows you to reorder movie scenes.\n\n3. Adobe Premiere Clip\n\nAdobe Premiere Clip is another one of our best video apps that comes from a big-name editing tool.\n\nUnlike the full desktop version, this app has more simplified features. It still accomplishes its mission to help users “create, edit, and share” videos.\n\nThey have two editing styles that you can choose from when you get started.\n\nTheir automatic editing option will quickly generate a clip based on your uploaded video, where you customize the pace of the video, the music, and the order of clips.\n\nTheir freeform editing lets you trim the video clip, sequence it, and edit it manually.\n\nLike other tools on this list, you can add in the music of your choice from your library, and you can share the video with the app’s community if you want to.\n\nAdobe Premiere Clip is a free app, and I think it’s effective without needing to upgrade to any of the paid plans if you’re looking for an app that will help you edit easily and quickly.\n\n4. Overvideo\n\nOvervideo is the only video editing app on this list that is only for iOS devices, so Android users may want to skip this one.\n\nIf you want to add subtitles to your video (but don’t want to do so on every social platform separately), this app is my best recommendation.\n\nYou can add text anywhere to a video, and determine how long it will appear on the screen.\n\nThis tool also has some great additional features, like the ability to add music and adjust the text and opacity of the text block.\n\nThe paid version of this app lets you edit your video a little more thoroughly, including with view cropping and clip trimming.\n\n5. LapseIt\n\nLapseIt is a simple but excellent editing app that I love.\n\nTimelapse videos can perform really well on social media; they grab your eye quickly, and they are effective at showing something that takes space over an extended period of time.\n\nLapseIt lets you shoot a new video through the app or choose an existing video from your gallery.\n\nThey have some amazing editing options, including an exceptionally user-friendly clip trimming system.\n\nYou can add music and filter effects, and you can also choose how quickly you’d like your video to progress.\n\nOnce you’re happy with your video, you can upload it directly to social media sites, including YouTube.\n\nThe basic LapseIt app is free for both iOS and Android, but their pro version is only $2.99. This version comes with added features and lets you produce higher resolution videos.\n\n6. Quik\n\nQuik is an incredible video editing software created by GoPro, and makes it easy to create social-ready videos in a few minutes or less.\n\nYou can add images (up to 200 of them), videos, and music to your video with just a few clicks.\n\nIt even has some great features that you won’t see from other video editing apps, like the ability to auto-sync music.\n\nQuick will also automatically analyze the images and videos you’ve uploaded to select the best moments, but you can also choose to pick them manually.\n\nYou can add text (with fonts of your choice), emojis, and slide titles.\n\nThis is easily one of the best mobile editing apps when it comes to ease of trimming and reordering clips of images and videos.\n\nIt’s the only mobile app that I always use to edit the actual video content.\n\nQuik also has excellent social sharing options, along with the possibility to share your video with text or email. It is currently available for desktop, iOS, and Android.\n\n7. Vizmato\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick video editing tool, Vizmato is a good choice. It lets you record videos in-app in HD from either rear or front-view cameras, or use videos from your phone’s library.\n\nVizmato lets you add themes, filters, and visual effects to your videos to make them interesting, exciting, and diverse.\n\nSome of these effects would be particularly helpful for Instagram Story ad creation, especially since you need to have all the video’s editing done before you upload it to Facebook’s ad system.\n\nLike other tools on this list, Vizmato has one-touch social sharing to several different platforms, including Vizmato’s own video feature portal to help your content gain additional visibility.\n\nVizmato starts as a free video editing app, but upgrading gets you additional features. A per-month subscription is $.99 (USD), and a year subscription is $9.99. It’s currently available iOS and is coming soon to Android.\n\n8. Cute CUT\n\nI’ve used Cute CUT when I needed to create Instagram Story Ads quickly (but make sure you choose the portrait view).\n\nIt lets you draw right onto the video, and you can add drawings, shapes, and text to only the specific segments of the video that you want. This is extremely helpful.\n\nWhile it does have features that allow you to trim or reorder clips, I’ve found Quik’s to be a little more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\nCute CUT has excellent drawing features—particularly the pro version—which is what I’d recommend it for.\n\nCute CUT has a Base app (which is a free video editing app) and a Pro app, which is only $5.99. If this is an app that you see yourself using often, go for the Pro version. It’s available for iOS and Android.\n\n9. In-Shot App\n\nIn-Shot App is another one of those great, easy-to-use video editing apps that you can use on the go.\n\nYou can upload videos and then add music, voice over narrations, text and emoji overlays, and time them all to appear at the right time and for the exact desired length.\n\nAnother advantage of using this one? There’s a decent library of royalty-free music that artists have donated, which you can use in your marketing content without paying a penny or worrying about copyright.\n\nThe learning curve is not high on this tool, which is nice if you’re looking for something to turn content around very quickly, but this also means that the functionality isn’t quite as high as other tools on this list.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for something really simple and fast to say, help create videos for Instagram Stories, this could be a good one. Otherwise, I’d likely recommend other tools on this list.\n\n10. PowerDirector Video App\n\nThis GooglePlay video app can do a lot, and it can do so while delivering fantastic quality: including 4k videos with hardware support.\n\nThis is something that not a ton of other apps on this can do, so that’s a huge advantage.\n\nIf you want your content pulled up on YouTube on a fancy big-screen TV, after all, the ability to have your videos show up in 4k will not only make them more enjoyable to watch, but it’ll make your brand look exceptional and highly qualified, too.\n\nPowerDirector has excellent voice over capabilities that are really easy to use, even for beginners. Also worth noting is their chroma key, which can layer color effects over an entire video to quickly change the color effects and the feel of the video itself.\n\nTheir chroma key works better than other “filters” on similar apps, which sometimes don’t translate to the HD high pixelation that can make your videos seriously look outstanding.\n\nPowerDirector also features fantastic blue screen and green screen capabilities, so you can place yourself in somewhere new and do something exceptional with your video content.\n\nOther cool features include:\n\nVideo collages\n\nVoice/ sound fading effects\n\nAdvanced background editing\n\n11. KineMaster\n\nKineMaster is all about precision editing, and you can actually trim videos at a frame-by-frame granularity and then immediately preview them to see how they look.\n\nThis app also gives you a lot more flexibility with layering than some of the other options here.\n\nYou can add layer after layer of text, graphics, images, and even handwriting on top of your videos to get the exact desired effect that you’re going for.\n\nThis makes design a lot easier in the long run if you’re creating more involved videos with multiple texts or graphics.\n\nThere’s also green-screen support, which is extraordinary.\n\nIn addition to being able to carefully adjust color, brightness, and the video clips and their speed, you can also fine-tune the audio on your videos within this app.\n\nYou can even edit the audio separately from the video itself, giving you more control and making things a little easier.\n\nThis app is available in both the Apple Store and on GooglePlay. The Pro Edition of the app is $39.99, and well worth it.\n\n12. LumaFusion\n\nI spent a lot of time in writing communities and kept noticing that some of my journalists friends kept mentioning something called “LumaFusion” over and over again. When I asked about it, they told me it was their go-to choice for video editing on the go, mainly when they were in a place they couldn’t bring their laptops.\n\nThis multi-track mobile video editing app is extraordinary and powerful.\n\nIt has undo/redo functionalities (which not all other apps do), and it covers the basics like trimming clips, duplicating content, adding transitions, and more.\n\nYou can also stack different images and video clips on top of each other, making more interesting and dynamic videos.\n\nI like that this app also has several different UI layout templates that you can use to more easily create gorgeous, professional quality videos very quickly.\n\nI’m also a fan of the audio features that comes with LumaFusion. My favorite might be the ability to adjust audio levels while you’re actually listening to it, which makes it easier to get it right a whole lot faster.\n\nTheir royalty-free audio library doesn’t hurt either and will save you a lot of time and effort (and potentially lawsuits) while you can improve your video with music.\n\nRight now, LumaFusion is only available for iOS, though you never know if that will change. It costs $19.99 (well worth the price) and can be downloaded here.\n\nBest Desktop Video Editing Software\n\nWith the increased emphasis on—and necessity for—video in marketing, having reliable, high-quality video editing tools is a necessity.\n\nWhile the above should have you covered for social posts, there are a few editing tools I also wanted to include.\n\nThe following tools will help even amateurs like me assemble professional-quality videos for your social media, product pages, and landing pages so you can represent your brand the way it deserves.\n\nThey’re all desktop apps for full potential functionality and precision, and though they cost more than a mobile app, they’re all worth every penny.\n\n13. Shakr\n\nWhile some videos like explainer videos may work best when created by a designer who is working on custom animation, most videos that brands use on social media and their landing pages merely need a little help to take it from an “I shot this on my iPhone” look to something that looks professional.\n\nShakr is the tool I recommend for these brands.\n\nShakr has an enormous library of video design templates that businesses can use to assemble gorgeous, high-quality marketing videos quickly.\n\nSome of these templates are designed for specific purposes, like Facebook video ads or those geared towards restaurants.\n\nThese designs have all been proven to provide high conversion rates, and are fully customizable; you can add your own images, video clips, and text.\n\nA subscription even allows you to use their commercially licensed music for your videos and gives you access to a library of stock photos. Pricing starts at $79 per month.\n\n14. Camtasia\n\nFor a short period of time, I was hired to edit and assemble videos for a marketing company. I used Camtasia the entire time, and I just used it a few weeks ago when recording a training video for a new employee.\n\nIf you want to record or heavily edit the technical side of a video that you already have, this would be my go-to choice.\n\nYou can record videos using screen capture or your computer’s camera, and you can edit video files you’ve already created.\n\nCamtasia has outstanding video editing capabilities, including:\n\nHigh-precision clip editing and reordering\n\nThe ability to remove audio from video and edit them separately, or to add a different voiceover narration\n\nRich animation features\n\nCamtasia costs $199 for lifetime access (though you may need to pay for upgrades in the future when they’re released if you want them). It’s available for both Windows and Apple devices, and it’s incredibly user-friendly on both.\n\nBonus use case: I also use Camtasia to record client calls that happen through my computer when my phone’s TapeACall wouldn’t work. You’re welcome.\n\n15. Premiere Elements 15\n\nFor those who prefer Adobe photo editing and are digitally and artistically talented, Premiere Elements 15 may be your video editing tool of choice.\n\nIt has better visual editing (as opposed to clip editing) features.\n\nYou can, according to one of their videos, literally “turn a frown upside down” with their video editing features designed to adjust facial features.\n\nSome of their unique features (aside from the facial feature adjuster) include:\n\nShake reduction, which can help make a video shot with a shaky hand less noticeable\n\nDynamic, dramatic effects, including text effects\n\nEffects that will actually move in the video (for example: if you had a thought bubble, it could follow its subject as they move)\n\nPremiere Elements 15 has a ton of incredible editing features, allowing you to edit every aspect of your video. It’s currently on sale for only $89.99, so I’d start your free trial now and invest if you think it’s the right fit for you.\n\n16. Final Cut Pro X\n\nFinal Cut Pro X has some insanely cool features, and if you’re looking for an all-out, does-everything-you-could-possibly-need video editing tool, this is the one to choose.\n\nIt’s only available for Apple, but if you have a Mac, you need to check this one out.\n\nIt, of course, can tackle everything that you’d expect like trimming video clips, adjusting audio, adding voice-overs, and editing or creating effects– everything that the other tools on this list can help with, and it does so flawlessly.\n\nThis includes advanced color adjusting, and the ability to create closed captions and add them to your video with ease.\n\nWhat really makes this tool unique is its stand-out features, including:\n\n360-degree video editing that helps you straighten the horizon, remove camera rigs, and more\n\nMulti-cam editing, which lets you sync up to 64 different angles of video with frame sizes and frame rates.\n\nStudio-quality 2D and 3D titles, which can be added to all videos (including 360-degree videos)\n\nVR headset playback, so that you can watch your 360 videos in real time from your VR headset\n\nAbility to edit HDR (high dynamic range) video\n\nThere’s a free 30-day trial available for Final Cut Pro X, and it costs $299.99 if you choose to purchase once the test period is up.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Social Video Best Practices\n\nThe video editing apps and tools discussed above can help brands of all sizes to create social videos that their audiences respond to.\n\nRegardless of which tools you use and what kind of videos you’re making, there are a few best practices that can provide better results. These include:\n\nKeep it brief.\n\nThough there are exceptions to this, brevity is preferred for most social videos. Some platforms like Twitter have strict time limits, so keep that in mind.\n\nAlways have a CTA.\n\nEach video you create is made to accomplish something. Add a CTA at the end of every video (bonus points if it’s clickable!) to encourage users to take that desired action.\n\nAdd subtitles.\n\nSome platforms are heavy on autoplay videos, which start without sound, so adding subtitles can help grab their attention. Subtitles are also necessary for users who may have hearing disabilities, or for those who are watching in an area where they can’t play the video with sound.\n\nStick to a single message.\n\nIf you want to get your point across, stick to a single, concise, simple message. You want there to be one story, one emotional impact, and one takeaway. Most importantly, there should only be one CTA."
