        "text": "I am of the Linux persuasion too. But frankly, if you need games, than you should have Windows, as in a \"real\" install. Games are very choosy software, and Wine just isn't that good. A VM has its limitations too. The only reason to play Windows games through Wine or a VM is to be trying to prove a point. It can be done, but it is just too damned uncomfortable. You could think about some other way to get the gaming you want, by either staying with games which can be installed on Linux (I went this way, but then I don't play much), or getting a console. If you decide that you still want your Windows games, make yourself a favour and make a real Windows install.\n\nWindows & OS X on the same PC? I don't see any need for that when you have your Macbook. You should be able to transfer data between them, e.g. by using a FAT pen drive. Besides, I don't think you can do it at all - you can make a Hackintosh, but I vaguely remember that you cannot dual boot it.\n\nSo you have your Windows. Should your Linux stay on it as a main OS? This depends entirely on you, specifically 1. How much do you want to use Linux and 2. How much time you spend on your PC playing games vs. doing other things. If you're only practically playing and do everything else on the laptop, there is no need to install a Linux.\n\nIf you are still unsure, just test it. Install both, install something which logs online time for each OS, run for a month or two. If you're not using the Linux, you can still ditch it. But if you're like me, you'll curse at every little ineptitude Windows 7 shows while the endless hunting for the elusive X configuration which finally makes everything right won't even register as a burden ;)"
