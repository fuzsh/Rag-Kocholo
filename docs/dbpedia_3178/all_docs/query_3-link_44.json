        "text": "Has anyone ordered a refurbished iMac from Apple online? Did you ever receive a unit that had a different OS on it then when it was originally sold? I'm looking for a unit with Catalina. I've spoken with 3 apple reps, and they say they do not have access to the information about the refurbished units operating systems. Their advice was to place the order anyway, and once it's unboxed and initialized, if the OS isn't the one I want, then i can box it back up and mail it back for a refund. Seems pretty convoluted to me. I don't fancy waiting and then unboxing, then setting it up, only to find out my preferred OS isn't on the unit. They said since it's a 2019, it SHOULD have Catalina, but the previous owner COULD have upgraded the OS to Big Sur. I'm kind of lost now, what to do. Just wondering if anyone else has this kind of experience? Thank you\n\nI purchased a 2017 refurb iMac last year from Apple. It originally had Sierra (10.12) and was loaded with whatever was current last year (Big Sur I think). In any case, I ordered it to be picked up at an Apple store. When I went to pick it up, I asked them to open the box so we could see which OS version was installed. I then asked if the genius could wipe it and install the original version. They told me that they couldn't, but I was firmly polite and said that it would run with its original OS - in other words, I talked them into it. They did; I went home and immediately made a bootable external clone. After that, I installed my older apps and made another clone. Then I upgraded the iMac. I can now boot into the external Sierra clone any time I need to use any of the older apps.\n\nYou just need to be careful when you order - only get one that came with and can run the older version you are interested in.\n\nApple refurbs ship with Apple-installed software. It’s usually fairly recent, but not always current. (If Apple can’t tell you what is installed, we certainly can’t.)\n\nIf you don’t like what’s pre-installed, either upgrade it to newer, or boot Recovery (Option-Shift-Command-R) and wipe and load what older you want, or create a Catalina bootable installer on another Mac, as supported by the hardware.\n\nIf you don’t get Catalina or somehow can’t get Catalina to load, ship it back within the return window.\n\nHere is an ➡️ Intro to macOS Recovery - Apple Support\n\nDeb wrote:\n\nI guess, I could grab a version of Catalina OS online somewhere, and install after wiping on the refurb one. I just was wanting to avoid all that, by getting one with 10.5 on it. A 2019 or 2017. Thanks tho.\n\nPresumably Catalina 10.15, as 10.5 is a very long time ago.\n\nThe oldest available macOS version for the Mac is available using Recovery, and here are the downloads: How to get old versions of macOS - Apple Support\n\nRunning Catalina won’t make any difference for any existing 32-bit apps, as those won’t work. That all ended with Mojave. if you’re contending with 32-bit apps and still on Mojave, use the Go64 tool to find what apps will cause you trouble with Catalina and later.\n\nAnd yes, chasing hardware and software for older app versions always gets to be a project. Always. It always increases in effort, too.\n\nI have purchased many Apple refurbished products, they all have come with the most current version of the OS available for that product. I cannot guarantee however I am 99% sure any Mac you buy will have Monterey installed on it. You cannot specify what version of Mac OS is installed on an Apple new or refurbished machine. You could contact a reputable reseller of used Macs such as MacSales.com and ask if they can install Catalina for you though, I don't know if they can or cannot.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would recommend upgrading the apps you are trying to run so they are 64 bit versions so you have more freedom and are not trying to stay stuck in the past with Catalina. You will eventually find trying to stay with older versions of Mac OS (or any OS for that matter) is a waste of time, effort and overall not wise as technology moves quickly and one must stay current.\n\nDeb wrote:\n\nNot concerned about any of the common apps but not interested in subscription based Lightroom. I have the stand alone version which will indeed work in Catalina if migrated rather than installed. That’s my interest in Catalina. Not into subscription right now in order to use Big Sur and Monterery. Not everyone chooses that path. I was just curious if anyone else had the same situation. I will carry on with my plan and possibly alter it. Thanks everyone for the feedback\n\nI understand what you want, and you and many of others have tried that, and—to be blunt—you’ve seemingly been stymied by the comparatively easy hurdle of macOS reinstallation.\n\nThis preservation effort can work great for a while, then the costs and the effort accrues; the bills can and will come due. They always do. And variously at the time of their choosing; when you’re under deadlines or outages or otherwise (over)loaded.\n\nAs for Lightroom, here are some options: https://alternativeto.net/software/adobe-lightroom/?platform=mac\n\nThis if the subscription is ruled out.\n\nOf what I’ve used… Pixelmator Pro, Affinity Photo (currently on sale), Flying Meat Acorn, and others, are all are potential candidates.\n\nWhere this current path will probably end up over time is with Catalina running as a guest in a hypervisor on some newer macOS version, but sooner or later you’re going to find other limits with this approach, whether it’s supported photo formats or communications or the Arm transition or whatever."
