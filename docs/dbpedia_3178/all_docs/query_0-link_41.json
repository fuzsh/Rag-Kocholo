New versions may now be available. For updated information about any of the issues described here, contact your software vendor. Error in Using Data Access from Microsoft Office Standard for Windows Version 7.0 ----------------------------------------- If you install Microsoft Office Standard for Windows version 7.0 on a computer running Windows 98 Second Edition, a \"Failure to load expression service\" error message appears when you use the Access ODBC driver from Office programs such as Excel or Word. To correct this problem, obtain the free update of Microsoft Office for Windows version 7.0b from Microsoft Product Support.

INSTALLING WIN32 SDK DEBUG COMPONENTS FROM THE MSDN CD-ROM ========================================== The MSDN components might not work properly with some Windows 98 Second Edition components. If you install the SDK or DDK debug components, reinstall Windows 98 Second Edition. Animated icons -------------- Some legacy third-party animated icon programs for Win 3.x may not function correctly on Windows 98 Second Edition. However, Windows 98 Second Edition fully supports animated cursors when using compatible display adapters. For more information, see http://search.microsoft.com/default.asp Under Choose your search category, click Support & the Knowledge Base. Then, in Enter your search word(s) or phrase, type \"Q123334\". Microsoft MS-DOS utilities running under Windows 98 Second Edition --------------------------------------------------- The MS-DOS utilities installed in the \\Windows\\Command directory have been enhanced to work with Windows 98 Second Edition. Do not use the disk repair utilities that shipped with older versions of MS-DOS. Most of the other MS-DOS utilities that worked with earlier versions of Windows should continue to work with Windows 98 Second Edition, but if they were specific to older versions of MS-DOS, you may need to use the SETVER command to enable them. The following MS-DOS utility files are deleted after you upgrade from an earlier version of Windows: Defrag.hlp Mwundel.exe Mwundel.hlp Networks.txt OS2.txt share.exe The following MS-DOS utility files are upgraded after you upgrade from any version of Windows 3.1. Ansi.sys Attrib.exe Chkdsk.exe Choice.com Country.sys Debug.exe Deltree.exe Diskcopy.com Display.sys Doskey.com Edit.com Ega.cpi Fc.exe Fdisk.exe Find.exe Format.com Keyb.com Keyboard.sys Label.exe Mem.exe Mode.com More.com Move.exe Mscdex.exe Nlsfunc.exe Scandisk.exe Scandisk.ini Sort.exe Subst.exe Sys.com Xcopy.exe Defrag.exe Drvspace.exe Emm386.exe Ramdrive.sys Readme.txt Setver.exe Smartdrv.exe Disk Utilities -------------- Disk utilities that perform low-level disk functions, such as defragmenters, disk-repair tools, and disk-compression utilities, often do not function correctly on FAT32 drives. Some of these utilities should work correctly on Windows with FAT16 drives. Contact the program vendor for information on Windows 98 Second Edition compatibility with older disk-compression utilities. The disk utilities included with Windows 98 Second Edition (ScanDisk and Disk Defragmenter) have already been modified to fully support FAT32. DriveSpace 3 is included with Windows 98 Second Edition. It has been modified to detect FAT32 drives, but it does not compress them. Multiple Display (Multi Monitor) Issues --------------------------------------- Some programs were not developed with the capabilities to operate seamlessly in a multiple display environment. As a result, these programs may exhibit abnormal behavior while operating with more than one active monitor. For more information about multiple monitor issues, see the file Display.txt, installed with Windows 98 Second Edition. Share.exe no longer works in MS-DOS mode ---------------------------------------- To support FAT32, SHARE support has been disabled in the real-mode MS-DOS kernel (sharing support is still provided under protected-mode Windows 98). Reinstalling Programs --------------------- If you are upgrading to Windows 98 Second Edition and install it in the same folder as your previous version of Windows, you do not need to reinstall your programs. If you install Windows 98 Second Edition in a new folder, you must reinstall all of your Windows- based programs. Copying from your old Windows folder to your new Windows 98 folder is not sufficient. MS-DOS-based programs --------------------- Your existing MS-DOS-based programs should run on Windows 98 Second Edition. If you experience problems with an MS-DOS-based program, you can set it up to run in an MS-DOS environment. >>>To run an MS-DOS-based program in an MS-DOS environment (MS-DOS mode): 1. Create a shortcut to the MS-DOS-based program. 2. Right-click the shortcut you created in step 1, and then click Properties. 3. Click Program, and then click Advanced. 4. Make sure the MS-DOS mode check box is selected. When you run a program in MS-DOS mode, it forces Windows 98 to shut down and load the program in an MS-DOS environment. You do not have access to devices that require protected-mode drivers. If you find that an MS-DOS-based program slows down or stops when it is in the background: 1. Right-click MS-DOS Prompt on the taskbar, and then click Properties. 2. Click the Misc tab. 3. Drag the Idle sensitivity slider toward Low. 4. Under Background, make sure the Always Suspend check box is cleared. Antivirus software ------------------ Existing antivirus software running on Windows 98 Second Edition should be able to detect viruses, but they may not always eliminate the viruses they find. We recommend that you update your antivirus software to a version that is designed to run with Windows 98 Second Edition. Contact your antivirus software vendor for an upgrade. Disk repair and optimization utilities -------------------------------------- To make it possible to store long file names on a FAT volume, it was necessary to change the Windows file system. These changes prevent most existing disk repair and optimization programs designed for Windows 3.1 from functioning correctly. Depending on how the disk repair and optimization programs work, Windows 98 may block them to protect the data on your disk. This limitation is necessary in a multitasking environment to prevent disk corruption caused by multiple utilities running simultaneously. We strongly recommend that you upgrade to disk repair software that was designed for Windows 98 if you are upgrading from Windows 3.1. For more information, contact your software vendor. Disk compression utilities -------------------------- Windows 98 Second Edition is incompatible with Stacker 4.1 and earlier versions. You need to uninstall Stacker version 4.1 or earlier before upgrading to Windows 98 Second Edition. Windows 3.1 shell enhancements ------------------------------ Most Windows 3.1 shell replacements still run on Windows 98 Second Edition, but with some limitations because of the taskbar, 32-bit components, and the new Windows 98 shell. If you want to continue running one of these programs, upgrade to a version that was designed to run with Windows 98. The major Windows 3.1 shell enhancement programs this limitation may affect are Norton Desktop, PC Tools Desktop, Tabworks, Dashboard, and Direct Access Desktop 1.0. Universal Naming Convention (UNC) network names and existing software ----------------------------------------- There are three ways to assign a network resource in Windows 98 Second Edition: - Assign a network resource by using its UNC name. UNC names are in the format \\\\server\\share. Windows 98 uses this method by default. - Assign a local name to the network resource. For example, assign one of your LPT ports to a network printer. - Assign a drive letter to a remote disk drive. This method was the default in Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 and is still supported in Windows 98 Second Edition. Using a UNC name removes much of the ambiguity of the Windows 3.1 method. UNC names tend to be longer in Windows 98 than their Windows 3.1 equivalents and can cause problems for some programs. If you experience such problems, you can revert to the Windows 3.1 method of addressing network resources. Using a UNC name may affect the following programs: Design CAD 2D for Windows, CorelDraw for Windows, Corel Photo Paint 5, ccMail, Quickbooks 3.0, Lotus Notes, MS Profit 1.0b, and other programs designed for the Windows 3.1 environment. NOTES ON SPECIFIC MS-DOS-BASED AND WINDOWS-BASED PROGRAMS ================================== 7th Guest --------- If you are running 7th Guest with a Pro Audio Spectrum 16 sound card, enable and use Sound Blaster compatibility mode, or configure your Pro Audio Spectrum card to IRQ 5 and DMA 3. Adaptec EZ-SCSI 3.1 ------------------- When this program runs with Windows 98 Second Edition, you may experience the following product limitations: - Adaptec EZ-SCSI does not modify your CONFIG.SYS and/or AUTOEXEC.BAT files like it does under Windows 3.1. To use real-mode device drivers with Windows 98, you need to run EZ-SCSI for DOS. To do this: start Windows 98, and then when the message \"Starting Windows 98\" is displayed, choose Command Prompt Only. Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are modified automatically. - The SCSI Power Management device driver included with Adaptec EZ-SCSI 3.1 is not compatible with Windows 98. - The SCSI tape backup package does not support backing up long file names. For information about Adaptec software products designed specifically for Windows 98, contact Adaptec directly at (800) 959-7274 or (408) 945-8600. Adobe Persuasion ---------------- You cannot install Adobe Persuasion version 3.0 if your CONFIG.SYS file is empty or has not been created. This is not a problem if you are upgrading from an earlier version of Windows or MS-DOS. >>>To create a CONFIG.SYS file: 1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Notepad. 2. Type \"rem This is a temporary config.sys file.\" 3. Click File, and then click Save. 4. Type C:\\Config.sys and then press ENTER. 5. Continue with the Adobe Persuasion 3.0 installation. For questions about Adobe Persuasion, call Adobe Systems, Inc., Customer Service at (800) 833-6687. Outside the United States, call (206) 622-5500 or the telephone number in the program documentation.

You may be able to work around this by setting a large maximum size for your swap file. Adobe PhotoShop 4.0 ------------------- When you use the Color Range feature on the Select menu, a page fault results. Adobe has a patch on its Web site (PhotoShop v. 4.01) which corrects this problem at http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/photoshop/ AH-64D Longbow (Jane's) ----------------------- If you use the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro and switch resolution from 640x480 to 320x240, the joystick will stop responding. Press one of the arrow keys to restore joystick input. A patch to correct this problem is available via the vendor at http://www.janes.ea.com. Ami Pro v3.01 ------------- To run the Ami Pro v3.01 tutorial correctly, you must set your Windows 98 taskbar to Auto hide. >>>To set your Windows 98 taskbar to Auto hide: 1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Taskbar and Start Menu. 2. Click Taskbar Options. 3. Select the Auto hide option. Ascend 97 Franklin Day Planner (Franklin Quest) ----------------------------------------------- To allow this application to properly install, rename MFC42.DLL in the \\Windows\\System folder. Ascend 97 will then use its own MFC42.DLL and complete the installation process. Contact the vendor for information concerning an updated version that does not exhibit this behavior. Astound 2.x ----------- If you experience printing problems, open the Properties dialog box for your printer and turn off EMS spooling. ATM fonts --------- ATM fonts do not appear on the font list when certain printer drivers for fax programs are set up as the default. You might have this problem with some versions of WinFax, FaxWorks, and older Quick Link 2 versions. A substitute TrueType font is used instead. AT&T Mail Access PLUS --------------------- If you use AT&T Mail Access PLUS for DOS or AT&T Mail Access PLUS for Windows (earlier than version 2.7), upgrade to the latest release of Access PLUS for Windows. To order an Access PLUS upgrade or to get more information about other AT&T messaging products and services, call (800) 242-6005 and ask for Department 95.

Under Advanced settings, click the Show window contents while dragging check box to clear it, and then click Apply. Cheyenne ARCSOLO 3.02 --------------------- Under Windows 98, ARCSOLO 3.02 cannot connect to the network drives mapped through Client for NetWare Networks (NWREDIR.VXD) and Client for Microsoft Networks (VREDIR) when the drives are already mapped. To work around this problem, add the following line to the [boot] section of your SYSTEM.INI file: network.drv=commctrl.dll NOTE: Any dll works; this is a 16-bit dll. ClarisWorks for Windows 3.0 v1 ------------------------------ To install ClarisWorks correctly, you must run the SETUPCW program on disk 2. The Setup program on disk 1 does not install the program under Windows 98 Second Edition. CleanSweep 3.0 (Quarterdeck) ---------------------------- Do not install a version of CleanSweep earlier than version 3.05 on Windows 98 Second Edition, as key Windows files are overwritten and render the operating system inoperable. A patch is available to update your version of CleanSweep to version 3.05 or later. See the Symantec Web site at: http://support.quarterdeck.com Conner Tape Backup ------------------ Because of enhancements to the Windows 98 file system which supports long file names, the Conner tape backup program does not work with Windows 98.

Faxworks v3.0 ------------- If your default printer name is extremely long, you may find that the Call Center dialog box does not appear. If this happens, shorten the printer name or, if you are printing to a network printer, capture the printer port. FaxWorks version 3.00f.041 -------------------------- The Advanced AGC option (audio gain control) is designed to adjust incoming call voice volume. Do not use this option with Windows 98 Second Edition. Using this option creates a .tmp file in your Temp folder. The file gradually fills the disk and causes a system lockup. First Aid 97 (CyberMedia) ------------------------ You might receive the following message from First Aid: Microsoft Backup is not installed on your computer. Would you like First Aid to install Microsoft Backup at this time? Yes or No You see this message whether MSBackup is installed or not. First Aid 97 is looking for a specific file name, Backup.exe.

This problem will be fixed in QuarkXPress 3.32. Microsoft FORTRAN 5.1 --------------------- If you want to create QuickWin applications using Microsoft FORTRAN 5.1 running on Windows 98 Second Edition, either delete or comment out the following line in the Fl.def file: APPOADER '___MSLANGLOAD' After you remove this line, recompile any QuickWin programs that were built with version 5.1. Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation ------------------------------ Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS and Windows is designed to work optimally under Windows 3.1. If you use Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation with Windows 98 Second Edition, graphics programs that you compiled using the program fail when you run them. A runtime error message appears instead of the usual graphics output. A patch is available to solve this problem. If you are still using version 1.0 instead of version 1.0a, obtain an updated version of the program. To determine which version you are running, switch to the Bin directory, and then run LINK.EXE. If you are running version 1.0a, the text \"Version 1.0F\" appears. To obtain the patch, contact Microsoft Product Support Services at the number listed in your documentation. Or, if you live in the U.S. or Canada, call (425) 635-7015. You can also download the file FPSFIX95.EXE from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on CompuServe or on Anonymous FTP: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/fpsfix95.exe Windows for Workgroup 3.x using Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ 1.0 ---------------------------------------------- When you upgrade from Windows for Workgroups 3.x to Windows 98 Second Edition, the 16-bit Microsoft Mail client and Schedule+ 1.0 continue to function. If Microsoft Mail is corrupted, install Windows Messaging Update. You can use Windows Messaging Update to send and receive e-mail through the Workgroups Postoffice (WGPO) or Microsoft Mail Postoffice on your LAN. The Windows Messaging Update (exupdusa.exe) is located in the \\tools\\oldwin95\\exchange folder on the Windows 98 Second Edition CD. After you install and configure Windows Messaging Update to connect to your post office, launch Windows Messaging, and then on the File menu, click Import Folder. You can then import your Microsoft Mail message file (*.mmf) into Windows Messaging. NOTE: Installation of the Windows Messaging Update disables the group scheduling functionality of Schedule+ 1.0. Microsoft Office version 4.0 ---------------------------- This version of Office does not install on Windows 98 Second Edition because the Share.exe file is missing. Creating a dummy version of Share.exe does not correct this problem. Microsoft Office 97 Service Releases (patches) ---------------------------------------------- If Windows 95 and Office 97 are installed on your computer and you then upgrade to Windows 98 Second Edition, the Office 97 Service Release 1 patch cannot be installed on your system. However, if you install the Office 97 Service Release 1 patch before you upgrade to Windows 98 Second Edition, the patch should work correctly. The Office 97 Service Release 2 patch has been released and can be used on both Windows 95 and Windows 98 systems. The latest Office 97 Service Release patches can be found at http://office.microsoft.com. Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.5 -------------------------------- With the Windows 98 interface enhancements, dialog boxes in Visual C++ version 1.5x may appear in different screen locations than they do on Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows NT. When you are debugging a program in the Visual C++ environment, we recommend that you do not minimize the Visual C++ main window. Minimizing may cause debug dialog boxes to be displayed off-screen, which would result in your not being able to maximize the Visual C++ main window. Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.2 -------------------------------- File version conflicts occur when you install this version of Visual C++ on Windows 98 Second Edition. When prompted, do not permit older versions of files to be copied over the newer versions. Installing older versions disables the Windows 98 Active Desktop. Microtek ScanWizard 2.0b7 ------------------------- If you have problems installing this program, perform the following procedure: 1. Add the following line to the [Compatibility] section of your WIN.INI file: DSHELL=0x00400000 2. Restart your computer, and then reinstall Microtek ScanWizard. 3.

Midisoft Studio 4, Midisoft Recording Session 4, MIDI Kit 1.0 ------------------------------------------------ If you experience problems running these Midisoft titles, see the vendor's Web page at http://www.midisoft.com/html/tech_support/faq/faq-st~1.htm From this site, you can contact their technical support for an updated Studio.exe file. Nickelodeon Director's Lab -------------------------- Some messages may appear at the end of the Setup program that may require you to close the Setup program manually. Closing it manually does no harm because Director's Lab has already been installed. After the Setup program adds the new shortcuts, you might see the message \"Setup Message: Script or DLL has been corrupted. Unable to load dialog template: 'mscuistf.dll: 2'.\" If this message appears, follow these steps. 1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE. 2. Click the Director's Lab Setup program, and then click End Task. Norton Backup ------------- Windows 98 Second Edition requires new settings for this program. Before you run Norton Backup, delete the NBACKUP.PIF file located in the Norton Backup directory. Norton Disk Doctor 2.0 and 3.0 (Symantec) ----------------------------------------- If you have Norton Utilities 2.0 or 3.0 installed before upgrading to Windows 98 Second Edition, Norton Disk Doctor will not run on an incorrect shutdown. To enable Norton Disk Doctor to run on an incorrect shutdown, either reinstall the application or perform the following steps: 1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt. 2. From the \\Windows prompt, type CD COMMAND and then press ENTER. 3. Type COPY NDD.EXE SCANDISK.ALT and then press ENTER. 4. Type EXIT to return to Windows. Your Norton Disk Doctor will now run correctly on improper shutdowns. Norton Utilities, AntiVirus, and Navigator for Windows 95 (Symantec) ---------------------------------------------- Many of the utilities contained in the original release of these products do not work correctly on FAT32 drives. The 2.x versions of these utilities support FAT32 completely. If you use the older versions of these products on Windows 98 Second Edition, error messages might appear indicating that you should obtain an updated version of the program from Symantec. Norton Navigator (Symantec) --------------------------- Norton Navigator places shortcuts to the applets contained in the Start menu.

Open your CONFIG.SYS file by using any text editor, such as MS-DOS Editor, and remove the following lines: Device=\\BlueMAX\\ExtraDOS.max pro=\\BlueMAX\\ExtraDOS.pro Install=\\BlueMAX\\ExtraDOS.max 6. Open your BLUEMAX.PRO file, which is located in the directory where BlueMAX is installed, and remove the following lines if they exist: Line beginning with \"PRGREG\" Line beginning with \"HPDAREG\" Line beginning with \"STACKREG\" 7. Restart your computer, and then follow these steps: a. When you see the BIOS installed successfully! message, press CTRL. b. Click Command Prompt Only. MAXIMIZE should continue setting up. c.

Refer to the \\Manual\\Technotes\\Readme.txt file (packaged with QEMM) for information about specific software and hardware incompatibilities with QEMM software. 2. Check Stealthing Options. Change ST:M to ST:F on the Qemm386.sys line in the CONFIG.SYS file, and then restart your computer. If Windows 98 Second Edition fails again, delete the ST:M or ST:F from the Qemm386.sys line in the CONFIG.SYS file, and then restart your computer. 3. Run QSETUP and turn off DOS-UP, Quickboot, and Stealthing Options (see previous step). 4. Run the OPTIMIZE program. NOTE: If DOS-UP or Stealthing is enabled in QSETUP, OPTIMIZE adds them to the CONFIG.SYS file. Currently, Windows 98 Second Edition may fail to start with DOSDATA.SYS and DOS-UP.SYS installed in the CONFIG.SYS file. DOSDATA.SYS, a portion of the DOS-UP features of QEMM, causes the Windows 98 multiboot feature to attempt to start Windows 98 even after you select the Previous Version of MS-DOS option. To bypass this situation, press F4 during the second appearance of \"Starting Windows 98.\" To correct this problem permanently, remove DOSDATA.SYS and DOS-UP.SYS from the CONFIG.DOS file."
