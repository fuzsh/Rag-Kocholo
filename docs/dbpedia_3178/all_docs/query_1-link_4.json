        "text": "Feedback, Shoutouts, and Links\n\nJP Prezzavento shared feedback about how to use my new classroom podcasting gear!\n\n#EdTech Thought\n\nWhat EdTech should NOT be used for? Our schools have many challenges but there are several ‘goals’ in education that technology has no business trying to accomplish.\n\nMake all learning digital/online\n\nReplacing the Teacher\n\nSaving money\n\n“Fixing” school\n\nSo what do you think? What problems should technology help to solve, and what should it not be used for? Leave a comment below.\n\n#EdTech Recommendation\n\nThe ability of AI to generate fake visuals is not yet mainstream knowledge, but a new website — ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com — offers a quick and persuasive education.\n\nFeatured Content\n\nThe Adobe Creative Cloud offers many amazing tools used by amateurs and professionals alike. Some of the most popular include Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro, for photos, graphics, and video editing.\n\nBack in 2013 Adobe moved away from the more traditional one-time purchase model for software and moved to a subscription-based model. I think they did this for three reasons.\n\nTo cut down on pirating of their software\n\nTo make updating their programs easier\n\nIncreased revenue from ongoing payments to use their suite of tools\n\nCreative Cloud Alternatives:\n\nLightroom Alternatives\n\nRawTherapee, as the name suggests, is great for editing RAW files along with most other formats in a non-destructive way along with batch-processing. RawTherapee is free and open-source software, meaning you can use it free of charge, wherever you like on whatever hardware you like. It is cross-platform – you can use it on Linux, macOS, or Windows and it’s available in 25 languages. https://rawtherapee.com\n\nDarktable is another Lightroom alternative. Darktable is an open-source photography workflow application and raw developer. A virtual light table and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable light table, and enables you to develop raw images and enhance them. It has a cleaner interface compared to RawTherapee and also offers non-destructive editing. It’s available for Mac, Windows, and various Linux builds. https://www.darktable.org/\n\nPhotoshop Alternatives\n\nGIMP – GIMP is a cross-platform image editor available for Linux, Mac, Windows and more operating systems. It is free software. Whether you are a graphic designer, photographer, illustrator, or scientist, GIMP provides you with sophisticated tools to get your job done. You can further enhance your productivity with GIMP thanks to many customization options and 3rd party plugins. GIMP provides the tools needed for high-quality image manipulation. From retouching to restoring to creative composites, the only limit is your imagination. GIMP gives users the power and flexibility to transform images into truly unique creations. It has so many features that you probably won’t miss using Photoshop! Historically, the interface hasn’t been great but in the last few updates, this has improved quite a bit. https://www.gimp.org/\n\nPhotopea is also a great alternative to Photoshop that is web-based. I previously talked about Photopea on episode 124. https://www.photopea.com/\n\nIllustrator Alternative\n\nThe best free alternative is Inkscape. There are various tools for object creation and manipulation and its SVG format file compliance makes it a suitable substitute for Illustrator. If you’ve used illustrator in the past you should have no trouble figuring out how to use Inkscape. It’s available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. if you’ve used illustrator in the past you should have no trouble figuring out how to use Inkscape. https://inkscape.org/\n\nAfter Effects Alternative\n\nBlender is a powerful free tool that a lot of people use that can help me get you some of the same results as its Adobe counterpart. In fact, Blender is preferred by many professionals to create 3D visual effects and realistic animated graphics. Without knowing it you’ve probably seen a lot of the projects on TV or in films that were created using Blender. Blender is open-source and available for Windows Mac and Linux. https://www.blender.org/\n\nInDesign Alternative\n\nScribus has all the tools you need including thought management, color profiles, and also supports Vector drawing tools. It has a very similar layout of grids, frames, and layers making the transition from InDesign to Scribus is easier. The latest stable release is available for all major operating systems. https://www.scribus.net/\n\nPremiere Pro Alternatives\n\nShotcut is one of the easiest video editors to use with a ton of features, all for free, not locked behind a paywall. It supports most of the popular media formats and even supports 4K resolutions. It’s available for Windows Mac and Linux. https://shotcut.org/\n\nOpenShot is an award-winning free and open-source video editor for Linux, Mac, and Windows. It’s packed full of features including no limit on how many layers you can have in your project and includes video transitions. https://www.openshot.org/\n\nAudition Alternative\n\nAudacity is the best free alternative to Audition. It’s open-source and available on every major operating system. Just about every feature you would need is included and it supports a variety of file formats and plugins that can be installed to add extra functionality. There are also different themes to change up the look.
