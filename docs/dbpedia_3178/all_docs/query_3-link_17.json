Setup copies this file to the Windows folder. This article is the first of two articles.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------- Microsoft Windows 95 README for Programs Information August l995 ----------------------------------------------------------------- (c) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1995 This document provides complementary or late-breaking information to supplement the Microsoft Windows 95 documentation. ------------------------ How to Use This Document ------------------------ To view Programs.txt on screen in Notepad, maximize the Notepad window. To print Programs.txt, open it in Notepad or another word processor, then use the Print command on the File menu. The phone numbers listed in this document are for use in the United States and Canada. If you are outside the U.S. or Canada, you can also contact your local hardware or software vendor for more information. -------- CONTENTS MS-DOS-BASED AND WINDOWS-BASED PROGRAMS THIRD-PARTY MEMORY MANAGERS --------- MS-DOS-BASED AND WINDOWS-BASED PROGRAMS ======================================= NOTE: All of the following references to software deal with the versions that were available at the time Windows 95 shipped. New versions may now be available. For updated information about any of the issues described here, contact your software vendor. Animated Icons -------------- Windows 95 does not support animated icons. Microsoft MS-DOS Utilities Running Under Windows 95 --------------------------------------------------- The MS-DOS utilities that are installed into the \\Windows\\Command directory have been enhanced to work with Windows 95. The disk repair utilities that shipped with older versions of MS-DOS should not be used with Windows 95. Most of the other MS-DOS utilities that worked with Windows 3.1 should continue to work with Windows 95, but if they were bound to an older version of MS-DOS, you may need to use the SETVER command to enable them. The following MS-DOS utility files will be deleted after you upgrade from an earlier version of Windows: Defrag.hlp Mwundel.exe Mwundel.hlp Networks.txt OS2.txt The following MS-DOS utility files will be upgraded after you upgrade from an earlier version of Windows: Ansi.sys Attrib.exe Chkdsk.exe Choice.com Country.sys Debug.exe Deltree.exe Diskcopy.com Display.sys Doskey.com Edit.com Ega.cpi Fc.exe Fdisk.exe Find.exe Format.com Keyb.com Keyboard.sys Label.exe Mem.exe Mode.com More.com Move.exe Mscdex.exe Nlsfunc.exe Scandisk.exe Scandisk.ini Share.exe Sort.exe Subst.exe Sys.com Xcopy.exe Defrag.exe Drvspace.exe Emm386.exe Ramdrive.sys Readme.txt Setver.exe Smartdrv.exe Re-installing Programs ---------------------- If you upgrade your existing Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups directory to Windows 95, then you do not need to re-install your programs. If you install Windows 95 to a new directory, then you must re-install all of your Windows-based programs. Copying files from your Windows 3.1 directory to Windows 95 is not sufficient. MS-DOS-Based Programs --------------------- Your existing MS-DOS-based programs should run from Windows 95. If you experience problems with an MS-DOS-based program, you can set it up to run in an MS-DOS environment. To run an MS-DOS-based program in an MS-DOS environment (MS-DOS mode): 1. Create a shortcut to the MS-DOS-based program. 2. Right click the shortcut icon, and then select Properties. 3. Click the Program tab, and then click Advanced. 4. Make sure that the MS-DOS Mode box is checked. When you run a program in MS-DOS mode, it will force Windows 95 to shut down and will load the program in an MS-DOS environment. Note that you will not have access to devices that require protected-mode drivers. If you find an MS-DOS-based program slowing down or stopping when it is in the background: 1. Right click the MS-DOS Prompt icon on the taskbar, and then click Properties. 2. Click the Misc tab. 3. Drag the Idle Sensitivity slider toward Low. 4. In the Background area, make sure that Always Suspend is not checked. Anti-Virus Software ------------------- Existing Anti-Virus software should be able to detect, but not always clean, viruses while running on Windows 95. This depends on where the virus was found and how the program chose to clean it. Also, virus shields may not be able to see all file activity, and therefore could miss some virus activity. It is recommended that you update your anti-virus software to a version that was designed to run with Windows 95. To contact McAfee for information about their new anti-virus software: McAfee BBS:(408) 988-4004, McAfee direct line: (408) 988-3832. To contact Symantec Corporation for information about their anti-virus software: (800) 441-7234 or (541) 334-6054. Disk Repair and Optimization Utilities -------------------------------------- To make it possible to store long filenames on a FAT volume, it was necessary to change the file system for Windows 95. Those changes will prevent most existing disk repair and optimization programs from functioning correctly. Depending on how they function, Windows may block them from executing in order to protect the data on your disk. This is necessary in a multi-tasking environment to prevent disk corruption caused by multiple utilities running simultaneously. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to disk repair software that was designed for Windows 95. For more information, contact your software vendor. Disk-Compression Utilities -------------------------- Windows 95 works with most major disk-compression products. However, since many of these products come with optimization utilities, it is recommended that you upgrade to the version designed for Windows 95. For more information, contact your software vendor. Windows 3.1 Shell Enhancements ------------------------------ Most Windows 3.1 shell replacements will still run on Windows 95, but with many limitations because of the taskbar, 32-bit components, and the new Windows 95 shell. If you want to continue running one of these programs, you should upgrade to a version that was designed to run with Windows 95. Major Windows 3.1 shell enhancements this may affect: Norton Desktop, PC Tools Desktop, Tabworks, Dashboard, and Direct Access Desktop 1.0. Using UNC Network Names with Existing Software ---------------------------------------------- There are three ways to assign a network resource in Windows 95. 1. Assign a network resource by using its UNC name. UNC names are in the format \\\\server\\share. Windows 95 defaults to this method. 2. Assign a local name to the network resource; for example, assign one of your LPT ports to a network printer. 3. Assign a drive letter to a remote disk drive. This was the default behavior in Windows 3.1 and is still supported in Windows 95. Using a UNC name removes much of the ambiguity of the older method that Windows 3.1 used. UNC names tend to be longer than their Windows 3.1 equivalents and this can cause problems for some programs. If you experience such problems, you can revert to the Windows 3.1 method of addressing network resources. For more information, look up \"capturing, printer ports\" and \"mapping, drive letters\" in the Windows Help index. This may affect the following programs: Design CAD 2D for Windows, CorelDraw for Windows, Corel Photo Paint 5, ccMail, Quickbooks 3.0, Lotus Notes, MS Profit 1.0b. Notes on Specific MS-DOS-Based and Windows-Based Programs --------------------------------------------------------- Adaptec EZ-SCSI 3.1: When this program is run with Windows 95, you may experience the following product limitations: - Adaptec EZ-SCSI will not modify your Config.sys and/or Autoexec.bat files like it does under Windows 3.1. To use real-mode device drivers with Windows 95, you will need to run EZ-SCSI for DOS. To do this, start Windows 95, and then when you see the message \"Starting Windows 95\", choose Command Prompt Only. Your Config.sys and and Autoexec.bat files will be modified automatically as needed. - The SCSI Power Management device driver included with Adaptec EZ-SCSI 3.1 is not compatible with Windows 95. - The SCSI tape backup package does not support backing up long filenames. For information about Adaptec software products designed specifically for Windows 95, please contact Adaptec direct at (800) 959-7274 or (408) 945-8600. Adobe Persuasion: You cannot install Adobe Persuasion version 3.0 if your Config.sys file is empty or has not been created. This is not a problem if you are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows or MS-DOS. To create a Config.sys file: 1. Click the Start menu, click Programs, click Accessories, and then click Notepad. 2. Type \"rem This is a temporary config.sys file.\" 3. Click File, and then click Save. 4. Type C:\\Config.sys, and then press ENTER. 5. Continue to install Adobe Persuasion 3.0. For questions about Adobe Persuasion, call Adobe Systems, Inc. Customer Service at (800) 833-6687.

For upgrade information, contact Alacrity at: fax (908) 813-2490, BBS (908) 813-2495. Ami Pro v3.01: To run the Ami Pro v3.01 tutorial correctly, you must set your Windows 95 taskbar to Auto-Hide. To do this: 1. Click the Start menu, click Settings, and then click Taskbar. 2. Make sure the Auto hide option is checked. AST Works: If you have problems with the voicemail program that comes with AST Works, you will need to obtain updated files. Those files are available on the Windows driver library, which can be ordered separately. Astound 2.x: If you experience printing problems, open the properties for your printer and turn off EMS spooling. ATM fonts: ATM fonts will not show up on the font list when certain printer drivers for fax programs are selected as the default. You will have this problem with WinFax (all versions), FaxWorks, and older Quick Link 2 versions. A substitute TrueType font will be used instead. AT&T Mail Access PLUS: If you use AT&T Mail Access PLUS for DOS or AT&T Mail Access Plus for Windows (earlier than version 2.7), you need to upgrade to the latest release of Access PLUS for Windows in order to work well on Windows 95. With the latest release, you'll get AT&T's new mail engine, Mail Transport, which eliminates the need for the Background Mailer TSR that was in earlier releases. To order an Access PLUS upgrade or to get more information about other AT&T messaging products and services, call (800) 242-6005 and ask for Department 95. Cheyenne ARCSOLO 3.02: Under Windows 95, ARCSOLO 3.02 cannot connect to the network drives mapped through the Client for NetWare Networks (Nwredir.vxd)and Client for Microsoft Networks (VREDIR) when the drives are already mapped. To work around this problem, add the following line to the [boot] section of your System.ini file: network.drv=commctrl.dll NOTE: Any DLL will work; this is a 16-bit dll. ClarisWorks for Windows 3.0 v1: To install correctly, you must run the SETUPCW program on disk 2. The Setup program on disk 1 will not install the program under Windows 95. Conner Tape Backup: Because of enhancements to the Windows 95 file system, which supports long filenames, the Conner tape backup program does not work with Windows 95. For information about an updated version of this utility, call Conner Peripherals at Conner Express, (800) 531-0968; ask for the Conner Backup Executive (CBE).

Faxworks v3.0: You may experience problems if your default printer name is extremely long, which could prevent the Call Center dialog box from appearing. If this happens, shorten the printer name or, if you are printing to a network printer, capture the printer port. For instructions on how to capture a printer port, see Windows Help. FaxWorks version 3.00f.041: The Advanced AGC option (audio gain control) is designed to adjust incoming call voice volume. This option does not work with Windows 95. Using this option creates a .tmp file in your Temp directory which gradually grows to fill the disk and cause a system lockup. Finesse: The Finesse program that was written for Windows 3.1 prevents Windows 95 from correctly displaying taskbar buttons. If you use this program, buttons representing your running programs will not appear correctly on the taskbar. To switch between open programs, press ALT+TAB. If you are in the United States, call your local Toshiba product support organization for more information. Or you can call (800) 999-4273. Outside the United States, call the product support number that came with this program. Fonts: Only TrueType fonts can be printed with Windows version 1.0 printer drivers.

Lotus Notes Windows Client 3.2: If you are using the NetBIOS interface over IPX and the NetBEUI protocol stacks, then it is necessary to configure the port for NetBIOS using the unit number that properly corresponds to that protocol. The default number for the first NetBIOS protocol is first set to 0, then any additional NetBIOS interface will start at port 7 through 1. It is likely that NetBIOS will use 7 or 6 if NetBEUI is using 0. To make changes, in the Lotus Notes Windows client, click the Tools menu, click Setup, and then click Ports. Managing your Money v2.0a for Windows: This program uses the Calendar.exe, Cardfile.exe, and Clock.exe files that shipped with Windows 3.x.
