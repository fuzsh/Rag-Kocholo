        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – For the past couple of years, Mac users have been burdened with a shameful secret few would admit, even to themselves. Their machines were slower than Windows PCs.\n\nNow the mantle of shame can be thrown off.\n\nA new line of high-end desktop Power Macs, available in August, will be the fastest personal computers on the planet.\n\nAt least that's the claim made by Apple Computer's charismatic CEO Steve Jobs, who unveiled the new Macs during a masterful performance at San Francisco's Moscone Center on Monday to kick off the company's annual software developers' conference.\n\nIn front of a packed, enthusiastic audience of Mac programmers, Jobs previewed the new computers with his trademark \"one more thing\" shtick.\n\nAfter talking for an hour-and-a-half about the next major revision to Apple's OS X operating system, codenamed Panther, Jobs revealed the new hardware at the end of his talk, as though the Power Macs were just an afterthought.\n\n\"We're here today to deliver the world's fastest personal computer,\" he announced nonchalantly. \"It's amazing.\"\n\nWearing his customary jeans and black turtleneck, Jobs described the new machines in detail before laying out a very convincing demonstration that, come August, the new Macs will leapfrog PCs in terms of performance.\n\nThe new Macs will be based on a \"massively parallel,\" 64-bit server chip from IBM, the PowerPC 970 processor.\n\nThe new machines introduce a completely new architecture to the Mac, which greatly increases the amount of data they can process and the speed at which they can do it, Jobs said.\n\nThe machines will come in three basic configurations, costing $2,000 for one with a single 1.6 GHz chip, $2,400 for a 1.8 GHz version and $3,000 for the top-of-the-line, dual 2 GHz model. Detailed specifications can be found here. By comparison, the least expensive dual-G4 Power Mac costs $2,800.\n\nThe new machines will come in a sleek, minimalist aluminum enclosure, and generate so much heat that they require nine computer-controlled fans to cool them.\n\nDetails of the new machines already had been leaked on Apple's own website. Jobs made light of the snafu, calling it \"premature specification.\"\n\nThe new Power Macs inspired new heights of colorful hyperbole from Jobs, whose powers of persuasion are legendary.\n\nJobs variously described the Power Macs as \"really, really exciting,\" \"super beautiful,\" \"an amazing, amazing machine\" and a \"thing of beauty.\" He also said, \"This thing can scream.\"\n\nThe 64-bit processor is the \"fastest ever,\" its 1 GHz system bus is the \"fastest ever\" and the new architecture, the \"highest bandwidth ever,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, describing the complex inner workings of the new IBM chip, Jobs boasted it has \"branch-prediction logic.\"\n\n\"I don't know what it does,\" he admitted. \"Predicts branches?\" he guessed, shrugging his shoulders and laughing. \"It's a good thing,\" he concluded.\n\nTo \"prove\" the new Power Macs are faster than Windows PCs, Jobs invited a series of third-party software developers onto the stage to run several comparative tests. In them, a dual 2 GHz processor Power Mac was compared to what Jobs called \"today's fastest desktop PC,\" which was equipped with a pair of 3 GHz Intel Xeon processors.\n\nThe Mac proved to be two to three times faster then the PC in the tests, which included creating complex images in Adobe Photoshop, rendering 3D animations, performing a complex mathematical calculation and playing a multipart musical score.\n\n\"The competition for this machine is not a PC any more,\" said one of the testers, Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research. \"It's high-end Unix workstations that cost twice as much. And it's faster than them also.\"\n\nIn a videotaped segment Jobs played for the audience, Ed Catmull, president of Pixar Animation Studios, said, \"After running our RenderMan benchmarks, we can say the G5 is the fastest personal computer in the world.\" Jobs is Pixar's part-time CEO.\n\nJobs also compared the new Power Macs to PCs on price. According to Jobs, a roughly comparable PC from Dell's website, featuring a pair of Xeon processors, costs $4,031, \"and is not as fast.\"\n\nHowever, the speed tests compared Apple's new machines to PCs available today. In three months, when the Power Macs ship, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to have versions of their chips running at 4 GHz and up, which may skew comparative tests back in favor of Windows-based machines.\n\nJobs said the new IBM chip would be running at 3 GHz in 12 months.\n\nJobs made no mention of portables, but developers at the show said they are confident the new 64-bit architecture will soon make its way into PowerBooks.\n\n\"It will certainly not be before next year, probably next summer,\" predicted Neil Ticktin, publisher of MacTech magazine.\n\nDespite the new architecture, the next-generation Power Macs will run current OS X software without any problems, Jobs said. Although Jobs didn't specify, he hinted that getting many applications to run 64-bit native required a simple recompile.\n\n\"Compiling (applications) should be a piece of cake,\" said John O'Fallon, president of Maxum Development, which publishes Mac server software. \"At least, that's the way they made it sound. There could be wrinkles.\"\n\nO'Fallon said the new machines were eye-popping, but he had to mentally pinch himself during Jobs' presentation lest he fall under the spell of the man's hypnotic selling powers.\n\n\"They are exciting,\" said O'Fallon, \"But I kind wanted to back off. I felt the same way I did when Jobs rolled out the G4. I know in a year or two he's going to be rolling out the G6.\"\n\nSee related slideshow"
