        "text": "I am a man on a mission.\n\nAs a tech professional (and all-around geek), I've watched coworkers and friends struggle for years under the thumb of the OS giants. Those of us in the industry have long known about alternatives, but recognized that the learning curve for the average user was far too steep to recommend a switch. Well, folks, I think the future has arrived...\n\nRecent releases of the alternative operating system \"Linux\" have become more and more user friendly and less intimidating for a transitioning Windows or Apple user. The time has finally come and I am here to educate you and anyone who will listen. Stay with me.\n\nWhat is Linux?\n\nLinux is an operating system, same as Microsoft Windows or Apple OS X. My favorite version (\"distribution\" or \"distro\" if you want to impress the IT guys) is Linux Mint. Rather than me reinventing the wheel, check out these links for an overview of Linux and Linux Mint.\n\nBenefit #1: Cost\n\nTry not to fall out of your chair: Linux is free. Yes, FREE, while MS Windows costs $99 or more per license and the current version of the Mac OS X costs $19.99. That may not seem like that much of an investment, but the costs multiply exponentially when you consider this scenario:\n\nI have a friend, let's call her Kris T., with an older Macbook who enrolled in some online courses to finish up her undergrad. Eager to embrace this new technology, wouldn't you know it, on the first day of class her old technology prevented her from accessing the courses. Because her hardware did not meet the requirements to upgrade to OS X, Kris T. couldn't update her applications or browser. The only solution at the time: Purchase a new laptop. In her situation, the cost to upgrade actually came out to be over $600 (for a mid-level laptop that satisfied her very minimal needs).\n\nWhat is freer than free? It's Linux! It will run on older hardware or newer hardware, it doesn't even care! What this means for you is no more forced purchases just because Microsoft or Apple decided to render your hardware useless by releasing an incompatible OS.\n\nHow on earth could Linux be such a secret then?\n\nWell, free things usually don't have an advertising budget and this is the case here too. And word of mouth doesn't do much if your eyes glaze over when your techie friends try to persuade you by prefacing with a story about how they built their own computer piece by piece, fully modded with LED fans and see-through casing to watch their masterpiece at work. Are you awake?\n\nSo my mission is to educate and bring more users over to Linux. This in turn with help spread the word, pay it forward the next wave of users spread the word, pay it forward, on and on and so forth, until... :cue dream-sequence chimes: the giants are toppled... We're gonna change the world here. Watch.\n\nSo while I may have you ready to go at this point, a caveat: Until this scenario plays out a bit and Linux becomes better known, the best candidates for conversion right now remain specific, read: advanced users. Is this you? Not sure? Read on and we'll figure it out together.\n\nWho is the ideal candidate for migrating to Linux?\n\n1. You do NOT use or rely on iTunes to manage your music library or more specifically your iOS device, e.g. iPhone, iPad, etc. So you would most likely need to be an Android device user.\n\n2. You do NOT use or rely on Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. These currently do not have a native install for Linux. Although there are workarounds for some of the products, you will probably not get the same user experience. Linux does have a great open source alternative to Photoshop called GIMP but it does involve learning a new product. (Can't afford Photoshop? Have I told you about how you can get this free alternative \"GIMP\"?)\n\n3. You are NOT an avid gamer. Although Steam is now supported on Linux, many of the major AAA titles will not run naively. Again there are workarounds that may be adequate for the casual player but may fall short for the hardcore gamer who needs every FPS they can squeeze out of their rig.\n\n4. You do NOT use or rely on AutoCAD or another Autodesk product. This also applies to any other proprietary software that you may use for home or business that do not have a native Linux install.\n\nFor an extensive list of Linux alternative applications visit Linux App Finder. There's TONS!\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nSimply… there are a lot of people who could benefit from migrating to Linux, especially Small Businesses where every penny counts. To me the largest hurdle for getting users interested and moved over to Linux is cohesiveness and guides that explain how doing X in Windows is done by doing Y in Linux. Let's address these, shall we?\n\nCohesiveness – Linux is about freedom and customization, but this means there is a wide variety of distributions out there. Of all these variations, none is really designated as the consumer (home user) version. Ubuntu is probably the best known. Dell and HP even sell laptops and desktops with Ubuntu Linux (but this is never highlighted in their advertising, so you'd never know). The main issue with Ubuntu, however, is that the company that maintains Ubuntu is more focused on its income producing products, so it may be difficult for a general user to get the hand-holding required to make the move.\n\nAfter much research, I decided to begin my own Linux journey using Linux Mint. This distro is based on Ubuntu, but has far stronger community support and an out-of-box feel closest to Windows. This is what I'm also recommending to you if you want to follow along for the revolution.\n\nEducation – There is an endless amount of information about using Linux and Linux Mint found in its user community, YouTube, Reddit, etc., but I've yet to come across a guide that says “hey former Windows user, if you were trying to shutdown your computer, the button for it is over here in Linux Mint.” The guide I envision would provide someone who is not technical or needs more hand-holding with a single, complete resource for navigating and using Linux ( Linux Mint).\n\nEducation also needs to focus on public perception. For those who still either have no idea what Linux is or think that it is some cryptic hacker tool, we need to make it known that it is actually a more stable and secure operating system, with a nice intuitive GUI to boot.\n\nUntil someone packages Linux in a way that is accessible to general users and provides the education they will need to make the switch as painless as possible, the big guys will continue to reign supreme. I want to contribute to effecting that change by educating and providing a comprehensive resource for potential new users.\n\nWatch this space for more to come in the series.
