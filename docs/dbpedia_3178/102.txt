Designed and developed an object-oriented application using C++ (under the Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE), PowerPlant class libraries, and the ColorSync operating system toolbox, to allow testing of eye patients using a variety of stimuli mapped onto computer monitors, featuring:

The ability to choose one of the many monitors connected to the system using a graphical interface very similar to what is available in the Montiors control panel

The changing of the color depth of the monitor to the resolution chosen by the user

The parsing of a color calibration table using a finite state machine syntax checker
