Silenced by the Soviet authorities for much of his career, in 1957 Pasternak permitted the publication abroad of his novel Doctor Zhivago. He was forced by his government to decline the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature. MARINA TSVETAYEVA (1892-1941), whose father was a classicist and whose mother was a pianist, was born in Moscow and published her first book of poems at seventeen. Tsvetayeva left Russia in 1922 with her two children and her husband, Sergei Efron, who fought against the Red Army in the 1918-1921 Civil War but was later to become a Soviet spy. Often living from hand to mouth, the family remained abroad until 1939. Two years later, after the execution of her husband and the arrest of her daughter, Tsvetayeva committed suicide. Along with numerous lyrics, her works include several extraordinary long poems, among them The Poem of the End, The Poem of the Mountain, and The Ratcatcher. RAINER\n\nMARIA\n\nRILKE (1875-1926) was born in Prague, the\n\nchild of a military officer who worked for the railways. His major books include The Book of Hours, inspired by a trip to Russia, the two volumes of New Poems, The Duino Elegies, and Sonnets to Orpheus. SUSAN SONTAG has written novels, stories, essays, and plays; written and directed films; and worked as a theater director in the United States and Europe. In 2001 she was awarded the Jerusalem Prize. Her most recent book is In America, a novel which won the National Book Award for Fiction in 2000.\n\nDigitized by the Internet Archive in 2022 with funding from Kahle/Austin Foundation\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/letterssummer1920000past_p9a3\n\nErIEBERS SUMMER\n\nBORIS\n\n1926\n\nPASTERNAK\n\nMARINA\n\nTSVETAYEVA\n\nRAINER\n\nMARIA\n\nRILKE\n\nEdited by YEVGENY\n\nPASTERNAK\n\nYELENA\n\nPASTERNAK\n\nKONSTANTIN Translated\n\nMARGARET WALTER\n\nM.

On May 12, Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 1 in F Minor is heard for the first time, performed by the Leningrad Philharmony; the composer is nineteen years old. On June 10, the elderly Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi, on the walk he takes every day from the construction site of the Cathedral of the Sagrada Familia to a church in the same neighborhood in Barcelona for vespers, is hit by a trolley, lies unattended on the street (because, it’s said, nobody recognizes him), and dies. On August 6, Gertrude Ederle, nineteen years old, American, swims from Cap Griz-Nez, France, to Kingsdown, England, in fourteen hours and thirty-one minutes, becoming the first woman to swim the English Channel and the first woman competing in a major sport to best the male record-holder. On August 23, the movie idol Rudolph Valentino dies of endocarditis and septicemia in a hospital in New York. On September 3, a steel Broadcasting Tower (Funkturm), 138 meters high with restaurant and panorama platform, is inaugurated in Berlin. Some books: Volume Two of Hitler’s Mein Kampf, Hart Crane’s White Buildings, A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh, Viktor Shklovsky’s Third Factory, Louis Aragon’s Le Paysan de Paris, D.H. Lawrence’s The Plumed Serpent, Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises, Agatha Christie’s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, T. E. Lawrence’s The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.\n\nPreface\n\nA few films: Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, Vsevolod Pudovkin’s Mother, Jean Renoir’s Nana, Herbert Brenon’s Beau Geste.\n\nTwo plays: Bertolt Brecht’s Mann ist Mann and Jean Cocteau’s Orphee. On December 6, Walter Benjamin arrives for a two-month stay in Moscow. He does not meet the thirty-six-year-old\n\nBoris Pasternak. Pasternak has not seen Marina Tsvetayeva for four years. Since she left Russia in 1922, they have become each other’s most cherished interlocutor and Pasternak, tacitly acknowledging Tsvetayeva as the greater poet, has made her his first reader. Tsvetayeva, who is thirty-four, is living in penury with her husband and two children in Paris. Rilke, who is fifty-one, is dying of leukemia in a sanatorium in Switzerland.\n\nLetters: Summer 1926 is a portrait of the sacred delirium of art. There are three participants: a god and two worshipers, who are also worshipers of each other (and who we, the readers of their letters, know to be future gods). A pair of young Russian poets, who have exchanged years of fervent letters about work and life, enter into correspondence with a great German poet who, for both, is poetry incarnate. These three-way love letters—and they are that—are an incomparable dramatization of ardor about poetry and about the life of the spirit. They portray a domain of reckless feeling and purity of aspiration which it would be our loss to dismiss as “romantic.” The literatures written in German and in Russian have been particularly devoted to spiritual exaltation. Tsvetayeva and Pasternak know German, and Rilke has studied and attained a passable mastery of Russian—all three suffused by the dreams of literary divinity promulgated in these languages. The Rus-\n\nPreface\n\nsians, lovers of German poetry and music since childhood (the mothers of both were pianists), expect the greatest poet of the age to be someone writing in the language of Goethe and Hölderlin. And the German-language poet has had as a formative early love and mentor a writer, born in St. Petersburg, with whom he traveled twice to Russia, ever since which he has considered that country his true, spiritual homeland. On the second of these trips, in 1900, Pasternak actually saw and probably was presented to the young Rilke. Pasternak’s father, the celebrated painter, was an esteemed acquaintance; Boris, the future poet, was ten years old. It is with the sacred memory of Rilke boarding a train with his lover Lou Andreas-Salomé—they remain, reverently, unnamed —that Pasternak begins Safe Conduct (1931), his supreme achievement in prose. Tsvetayeva, of course, has never set eyes on Rilke. All three poets are agitated by seemingly incompatible needs: for the most absolute solitude and for the most intense communion with another like-minded spirit. “My voice can ring out pure and clear only when absolutely solitary,” Pasternak tells his father in a letter. Ardor inflected by intransigence drives all of Tsvetayeva’s writings. In “Art in the Light of Conscience” (1932), she writes: The poet can have only one prayer: not to understand the unacceptable—let me not understand, so that I may not be seduced... let me not hear, so that I may not answer... The poet’s only prayer is a prayer for deafness. And the signature two-step of Rilke’s life, as we know from his letters to a variety of correspondents, mostly women,\n\nis\n\nflight from intimacy and a bid for unconditional sympathy and understanding. Although the younger poets announce themselves as acolytes, the letters quickly become an exchange of equals, a xi\n\nPreface\n\ncompetition of affinities. To those familiar with the main branches of Rilke’s grandiose, often stately correspondence it may come as a surprise to find him responding in almost the same eager, jubilant tones as his two Russian admirers. But never has he had interlocutors of this caliber. The sovereign, didactic Rilke we know from the Letters to a Young Poet, written between 1903 and 1908, has disappeared. Here is only angelic conversation. Nothing to teach. Nothing to learn. Opera is the only medium now in which it is still acceptable to rhapsodize. The duo that concludes Richard Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos, whose libretto is by one of Rilke’s contemporaries, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, offers a comparable effusiveness. We are surely more comfortable with the paean to love as rebirth and self-transformation sung by Ariadne and Bacchus than with the upsurges of amorous feeling declared by the three poets. And these letters are not concluding duos. They are duos trying, and eventually failing, to be trios. What kind of possession of each other do the poets expect? How consuming and how exclusive is this kind of love? The correspondence has begun, with Pasternak’s father as the intermediary, between Rilke and Pasternak. Then Pasternak suggests to Rilke that he write to Tsvetayeva, and the\n\nsituation becomes a correspondence 4 trois. Last to enter the lists, Tsvetayeva quickly becomes the igniting force, so powerful, so outrageous are her need, her boldness, her emotional nakedness. Tsvetayeva is the relentless one, outgalloping first Pasternak, then Rilke. Pasternak, who no longer knows what to demand of Rilke, retreats (and Tsvetayeva also calls a halt to their correspondence); Tsvetayeva can envisage an erotic, engulfing tie. Imploring Rilke to consent to a meeting, she succeeds only in driving him away. Rilke, in his turn, falls silent. (His last letter to her is on August 19.) The flow of rhetoric reaches the precipice of the sublime, and topples over into hysteria, anguish, dread. xii\n\nPreface\n\nBut, curiously, death seems quite unreal. How astonished and shattered the Russians are when this “phenomenon of nature” (so they thought of Rilke) is in some sense no more. Silence should be full. Silence which now has the name of death seems too great a diminishment. So the correspondence has to continue. Tsvetayeva writes a letter to Rilke a few days after being told he has died at the end of December, and addresses a long prose ode to him (“Your Death”) the following year. The manuscript of Safe Conduct, which Pasternak completes almost five years after Rilke’s death, ends with a letter to Rilke. (“If you were alive, this is the letter I would send you today.”) Leading the reader through a labyrinth of elliptical memoiristic prose to the core of the poet’s inwardness, Safe Conduct is written under the sign of Rilke and, if only unconsciously, in competition with Rilke, being an attempt to match if not surpass The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge (1910), Rilke’s supreme achievement in prose.\n\nEarly in Safe Conduct, Pasternak speaks of living on and for those occasions when “a complete feeling burst into space with the whole extent of space before it.” Never has a brief for the powers of lyric poetry been made so brilliantly, so rapturously, as in these letters. Poetry cannot be abandoned or renounced, once you are “the lyre’s thrall,” Tsvetayeva instructs Pasternak in a letter of July 1925. “With poetry, dear friend, as with love; no separation until it drops you.” Or until death intervenes. Tsvetayeva and Pasternak haven't suspected that Rilke was seriously ill. Learning that he has died, the two poets are incredulous: it seems, cosmically speaking, unjust. And fifteen years later Pasternak would be surprised and remorseful when he received the news of Tsvetayeva’s suicide in August 1941. He hadn’t, he admitted, grasped the inevitability of the doom that awaited her if she decided to return to the Soviet Union with her family, as she did in 1939. xili\n\nPreface\n\nSeparation had made everything replete. What would Rilke and Tsvetayeva have said to each other had they actually met? We know what Pasternak didn’t say to Tsvetayeva when they were briefly reunited after thirteen years, in June 1935, on the day he arrived in Paris in the nightmarish role of official Soviet delegate to the International Writers Congress for the Defense of Culture: he didn’t warn her not to come back, not to think of coming back, to Moscow. Maybe the ecstasies channeled into this correspondence could only have been voiced in separateness, and in response to the ways in which they failed one another. (As the greatest writers invariably demand too much of, and are failed by, readers.) Nothing can dim the incandescence of those exchanges over a few months in 1926 when they were hurling themselves at one another, making their impossible, glorious demands. Today, when “all is drowning in Pharisaism’”—the phrase is Pasternak’s—their ardors and their tenacities feel like raft, beacon, beach.\n\n—SUSAN\n\nSONTAG\n\nFOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION \"THE YEAR 2001 marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the death of the great German poet Rainer Maria Rilke. This book, which we first compiled twenty-five years ago, concerns 1926, the last year of his life. It contains his brief correspondence with the poets Marina Tsvetayeva and Boris Pasternak, who were drawn to the elder poet by their love and admiration for his great poetic gift. The body of the correspondence, which we unexpectedly received a quarter of a century ago, was accompanied in the first edition by commentary on the circumstances that brought these three great poets together and on their relationships with one another. The book was translated into many languages. For the Russian edition, which became possible only in the early 1990s, the commentary was significantly expanded by new documents. A second, enlarged Russian edition appeared last year. In addition to the letters to and from Rilke, this book contains part of the 1926 correspondence of Pasternak and Tsvetayeva. The full extent of the Russian poets’ correspondence, which continued over the course of many years, is not yet known. The primary collection of Tsvetayeva manuscripts was deposited at the State Archives of Literature and Art in Moscow by her daughter, Ariadna Efron, and was closed for twenty-five years. Last year the archive was opened. Elena Korkina, the scholar preparing the archives for publication, estimates that she will be able to begin work on the Pasternak letters no sooner than several years from now. XV\n\nForeword\n\nOn October German\n\n12, 1941, during the alarming days of the\n\nattack on Moscow\n\nand the evacuation,\n\nPasternak\n\ngave the originals of Tsvetayeva’s letters for safekeeping to her admirers Ekaterina Krasheninnikova and Olga Setnitskaya. He had just met with Marina Tsvetayeva’s son, Georgy (Mur), who had returned from Elabuga with news of the days preceding his mother’s suicide. Two days later Pasternak himself was evacuated from Moscow with a group of writers and joined his family. On receiving the Tsvetayeva papers, the young women made copies of the poems and some of the letters and wrote a description of the correspondence. In 1944-45, with Pasternak’s permission, they took a number of letters to be copied to the poet and collector Aleksei Kruchyonykh, who planned to include them in the archive he was compiling. In the course of this transfer, the letters were lost. Drafts of these letters were, however, preserved in notebooks in the Tsvetayeva archives, and we have drawn on some of these in this new edition. The May 11, 1927, letter from Tsvetayeva to Pasternak included in the epilogue was discovered only two years ago in a manuscript version of Krasheninnikova’s copy of October 19, 1941. Illegible words and omissions have been filled in according to context, and they are given in brackets. The letter, written over a year after Rilke’s death, discusses a possible meeting between Tsvetayeva and Pasternak. In the spring of 1926, they had planned to visit Rilke together in Muzot; now they dreamed of visiting his grave in Rarogne, the grave to which “the path will not be overgrown,” as Tsvetayeva wrote Pasternak’s father in 1928. We can only surmise how Tsvetayeva’s passionate soulbaring was received, since we do not have access to Pasternak’s reply. But judging by the fact that Pasternak immediately wrote Raisa Lomonosova that he had rejected the idea of\n\nxvi\n\nForeword\n\na trip abroad, we can assume that Tsvetayeva’s plea did not have the desired effect. The unexpected appearance of this long-lost letter leads us to believe that others will undoubtedly emerge once the full contents of the relevant archives have been made available.

Letters from Rilke and letters to Rilke from Pasternak and Tsvetayeva, written in German, have been translated by Walter Arndt, who has also added elucidatory footnotes on his translation. He has in addition translated and annotated the Russian, German, and French poetry appearing in this volume. Notes helpful to an understanding of the correspondence (identifications of persons and places, for example) have been placed at the foot of the pages and are indicated in the text by asterisks and other standard symbols. Superscript numbers in the text (mostly in the introduction) refer the reader to the bibliographic notes at the end of the book, which will prove useful to those wishing to consult original sources. In preparing this edition for an English-speaking audience, the publisher has added many explanatory footnotes not contained in either the original Russian manuscript or the published German translation; by the same token, the publisher has abridged or dropped notes that were not absolutely essential for an\n\nA Note\n\non the English Edition\n\nappreciation of the correspondence, many of these notes referring to material not available in English translation.

The letters brilliantly concentrate and refract the entire correspondence of the two other poets, Marina Tsvetayeva (1892-1941) and Boris Pasternak (1890-1960), a correspondence which extended over many years and much of which cannot be published until the next century. The editors felt obliged to prepare all the PasternakTsvetayeva-Rilke letters for publication after the release of Tsvetayeva’s letters to Rilke by the Manuscript Department of the Swiss National Library in Berne in January 1977, when Tsvetayeva’s fifty-year ban on their publication expired. Soon afterward Zeitschrift für slavische Philologie printed Tsvetayeva’s letters, but this violated the wishes of the author and, more important, profaned the substance of the letters. For at various times Tsvetayeva had insisted that the correspondence could and should be published as a whole in fifty years, when all this is over, completely over, and our bodies have rotted, and the ink has faded, when the receiver has gone to join the sender (I—the first letter to be delivered!), when Rilke’s letters will be simply Rilke letters—not to me—to everybody—when I myself will merge with all things and—oh, this is the main thing!— when I will have no need of Rilke’s letters because all of\n\nIntroduction\n\nRilke will then be mine. They must not be published without asking. Without asking means—ahead of time. As long as the receiver is here and the sender is there, no answer can be given. His answer to my asking will be the date. Will that do? Thank you. It will not be sooner than—God knows when.... The seven letters lying in my box (doing exactly what he is doing—not he, but his body—like the letters —not thoughts, but the body of thoughts)—those seven letters lying in my box along with pictures of him and that last Elegy, I give to future generations—give them now, not in the future. When they are born they will receive these letters. When they are born I will have passed away. That will be the day of the resurrection of his thoughts in the flesh. Let them sleep until Judgment Day, a day not of Fear but of Light. Thus, dutiful and jealous, I neither betray nor hide them.’ Tsvetayeva’s actions confirm her intentions. In 1939 she only to the outthat, on leaving Moscow she had removed from her papers a packet containing Rilke’s letters and photographs, books he had inscribed to her, and eleven letters from Boris Pasternak. She went to the State Publishing House, whose Department of Literature of National Republics of the USSR had supplied her with translating work (her only source of income), and entrusted the packet to the department’s editor-in-chief, Alexandra Ryabinina. Tsvetayeva must have been particularly concerned about the fate of these letters: copies carefully traced in her own hand remained among her personal papers, but apparently she felt that the originals required a more secure place. Shortly after her return to the Soviet Union Tsvetayeva\n\nreturned to the Soviet Union from Western Europe, be evacuated from Moscow to the city of Yelabuga at break of Soviet-German fighting in 1941; it was here August 31, 1941, she took her own life. But on\n\nIntroduction\n\nhad been brought to Ryabinina by Pasternak himself, who had on more than one occasion been aided by Ryabinina. Tsvetayeva saw Ryabinina as someone she could trust implicitly, and she was not to be disappointed. After jealously preserving the papers for many years, Ryabinina turned them over to Pasternak’s heirs in 1975, explaining that she did this to enable the remarkable correspondence to be published before long. On the packet, in Tsvetayeva’s hand, was written: “Rilke and Pasternak 1926.” During World War II virtually all of Tsvetayeva’s letters to Pasternak were lost, in circumstances related in Pasternak’s autobiographical article “People and Circumstances.’” But before this loss occurred, copies had been made of twenty of them,’ and four originals had been saved. Furthermore, Tsvetayeva had the habit of drafting her letters in a notebook; since this notebook has survived, the text of the letters she sent Pasternak in the summer of 1926 can be verified. Thus we have at our disposal all that Tsvetayeva intended when she said she would neither betray nor hide the letters but preserve them until such time as she considered proper. The editors would like to thank all those who aided them in their work, especially Anastasia Ivanovna Tsvetayeva, Anna Alexandrovna Saakyants, Yelena Baurdzhanovna Korkina, Lydia Pasternak Slater, Josepha Baier, Christoph Sieber-Rilke, and Joachim Storck.\n\nUnlike a correspondence that covers an extended period, this exchange of letters covers but a single moment. In one bright flash we glimpse a scene of startling concentration, more vivid in detail than if the picture were exposed to prolonged light. One has to read and reread, to ask questions and seek answers in the works, the biographies, the circumstances relating to a 5\n\nIntroduction\n\ndifferent reality—a tragically interrupted historical reality. Boris Pasternak wrote that historical changes affected every aspect of their lives, that “even the language in which people once spoke disappeared.” For that reason, “rejecting much, rejecting things that are risky and extreme, rejecting the peculiarities of the art of the earlier time,” he makes it his purpose to “present in a modern translation, in the more ordinary, commonplace, and tranquil language now prevailing, at least part of the former world, and this the most precious part”—that which has throughout the ages been distinguished by the Gospel theme of “the thermal, spectral, organic perception of life.”* It is of this that Pasternak spoke when he wrote to Tsvetayeva, in a letter of April 20, 1926, that he would remain in Moscow one more year for the sake of his work: “One year—this is my time limit and I will observe it. 1am speaking only about work, about fortifying myself, about continuing efforts aimed at restoring to history a generation that seems to have dropped out of it, the generation to which you and I belong.” This introduction will attempt to throw light on details that remain in shadow, and to provide an account of the circumstances that shaped the correspondence.\n\nEach of the three correspondents occupies an independent place in European literature and has created his or her own poetic world. In contrast to innovators of the avant-garde, they changed nothing that was tried and true: they did not find the destruction of the old essential or even justifiable. The new emerged because direct imitation does not allow for the preservation of lofty traditions; only inspiration—freshness, originality, the artist’s personal vision—can add to the wealth of mankind’s spiritual legacy. Tradition, as Pasternak\n\nIntroduction\n\nwrote, lies at the heart of an artist’s work, and faithfulness to tradition is precisely what promises him distinctiveness, the unexampled originality of his personal experience. Presumably this was Rilke’s attitude toward German romanticism, which, both directly and in the refracted light of Russian symbolism, became the spiritual cradle of Pasternak and Tsvetayeva. Unlike those who followed the beaten path of fashionable literary schools and trends, they both “withdrew from the world at an early age,” repelled by “reigning modes” (Pasternak’s letter to Tsvetayeva of March 25, 1926). For Pasternak and Tsvetayeva, Rilke was the incarnation of poetry and the spiritual life, a model to be worshipfully followed. His German lyric poetry especially attracted the Russian poets because it allowed them to make use of his experience in a highly original way, without a shade of imitation. Tsvetayeva defines this relationship with the word nachdichten: “Today I would like Rilke to speak—through me. In everyday language this is called translation. (How much better the Germans put it—nachdichten! Following in the poet’s footsteps, to lay again the path he has already laid. Let nach mean follow, but dichten* always has new meaning. Nachdichten—laying anew a path, all traces of which are instantaneously grown over.) But ‘translate’ has another meaning: to translate not only into (into Russian, for example) but also to (to the opposite bank of the river). I will translate Rilke into Russian and he, in time, will translate me to the\n\nother world.”® Pasternak, too, wrote of the use he made of Rilke’s creative experience: “I always believed that in my own efforts, in all of my work, I did nothing but translate or write variations on his themes, adding nothing to his world, always sailing in his waters.”’° For Tsvetayeva and Pasternak, Rilke’s poetry was the high*Sing? Relate? Fancy? Create? In Russian—no word for it. [M. Ts.]\n\nIntroduction\n\nest proof that in this divided and distorted world there exist real and immutable values not to be measured by pragmatic standards.\n\nThe intense interest Rilke took in the fate of Pasternak and Tsvetayeva during that last year of his life had its roots in memories, carefully nurtured and treasured, of visits he made to Russia in 1899 and 1900. Rilke, who was quite a young man when he visited Russia, remained her loyal and ardent admirer until his death. Everything associated with Russia was for him filled with deep spiritual meaning. “He loved Russia as I love Germany, not bound by ties of blood but in the free passion of a spirit,” wrote Tsvetayeva of Rilke.’ Rilke himself spoke of this again and again: “Among the great and mysterious assurances upholding my life is the fact that Russia is my native land” (1903).’ “What do I owe Russia? She made me what I am, of her my inner self was born; there is the homeland of my instinctual being, every kind of spiritual origin” (1920). “Russia became in a certain sense the basis of my perceptions and experience,” he confessed to his “young friend” not long before his death.’ And in a letter to the French writer and translator Maurice Betz, Rilke called his meeting with Russia the decisive event of his life.\" Rilke’s two trips to Russia, his determined efforts to learn the Russian language, to become familiar with Russian history, art, and literature, his making the acquaintance of eminent Russian writers and artists—all this testifies to the strength of the country’s attraction for him. In that neoromantic period the late nineteenth century, Western Europe was discovering, through Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, a little-known land inhabited by what many consid-\n\nIntroduction\n\nered a special people, chosen by God, which had yet to make its contribution to history. Western Europeans believed that their own civilization, sunk in rationalism and atheism, had run its course and was fast declining, while Russia, a youthful land, had not exhausted its fund of primordial faith and could expect a great spiritual blossoming. Seen in such a light, patriarchal Russia was the antipode of the bourgeois West. This attitude was confirmed in Rilke by his friend Lou Andreas-Salomé, whom the young poet first met in Munich in the spring of 1897. At the time, Andreas-Salomé was well known in German modernist circles. She wrote critical and philosophical articles for leading German periodicals and was also trying her hand at fiction. In 1894 she published a book about her friendship with Nietzsche (1882-83). Andreas-Salomé was born and raised in St. Petersburg, the daughter of a general stationed in Russia. At the age of nineteen she left Russia for Zurich, then, in 1887, married the well-known orientalist Friedrich Carl Andreas. Although she lived permanently in Germany after that, she never severed her spiritual ties with Russia. Almost every year she visited her mother in St. Petersburg, and from 1897 on she kept turning to Russian themes in her writing. She tried to contribute to the St. Petersburg journal Severny vestnik, the first Russian periodical to publish the works of Russian and West European symbolists. It was she who introduced Rilke to the critic Akim Volynsky. For the young Rilke, then avidly seeking his path in art, meeting Lou Andreas-Salomé was an event of enormous significance. She interested him in Russian culture and the Russian language, and helped him begin preparing for Russia. The Russian writer Sofia Schill (pseudonym Sergei Orlovsky), who met Rilke and Andreas-Salomé in the winter of 18991900 in Berlin, shortly after their first visit to Russia, says in her unpublished memoirs: “... actually it was Luisa Gustavovna [Lou] who displayed such a warm and lively interest in 9\n\nIntroduction\n\nour country; under her influence Rainer Osipovich began studying Russian writers.” In another passage from her memoirs, Schill observes that the young Rilke “found support in the exemplary life of his friend Andreas-Salomé. Her influence on the young poet was unmistakable.” On April 27, 1899, Rilke, accompanied by Andreas-Salomé and her husband, arrived in Moscow for the first time. The travelers put up at the Grand Hotel, near the Kremlin. From their hotel windows they looked out at the Iversk Gates and the shrine of Our Lady of Iversk. It was Holy Week and a crowd of worshipers surrounded the shrine. Church bells were ringing, services were being held in churches and cathedrals. The sensitive, impressionable Rilke was carried away by the scene. Twenty-five years later, in a conversation with the Polish writer and translator Witold Hulewicz, Rilke described his first hours in Russia: Tired as I was, I set out, after a short rest, to see the\n\ntown. Out of the twilight mist rose the contours of the cathedral, with two little silver chapels on either side of it and pilgrims resting on the steps, waiting for the doors to be opened. This spectacle, so extraordinary for me, shook me to the depths of my soul. For the first time in my life I was overcome by an indescribable emotion, as if I had found my native land... .* A week later, on May 2, Rilke and his companions went to St. Petersburg. Here he spent almost a month and a half that were filled, as he wrote his mother, “with people and pictures.” But he also spent a good deal of time alone, taking special interest in Russian paintings, including icons, and reflecting deeply on “things Russian,” in his effort to plumb the meaning of what he saw in this new land. The impressions Rilke received in his first weeks in Russia 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nconfirmed his preconceived idea of it as a wholly unique country. “The poet’s image of Russia was of a land of prophetic dreams and patriarchal traditions as contrasted with the industrial West,” wrote Sofia Schill.“ Here, he believed, he had found all that he had so desperately been seeking. He saw a fabulous country living in perfect harmony with nature, free from the lies of civilization, inhabited by a people who had not exhausted their rich spiritual powers. “It would be hard to describe how new this land is, how it speaks of the future, as though its palaces and churches were yet to be,” Rilke wrote to the poet Hugo Salus on March 18, 1899. On the following day, in a letter to the writer Franziska von Reventlow, he said: “Day after day it fills one with a strange feeling to be among people so full of reverence and piety, and I profoundly rejoice in this experience.” During a stay in Italy in 1898, the year before he went to Russia, Rilke had developed his philosophical conception of the artist, the creator, who makes God as Michelangelo did by carving him out of stone, who discovers him in all things and makes him visible. In his “Florentine Diary” Rilke defines the artist as a religious man, solitary and withdrawn from the world in order to concentrate on the inner life. It seemed to Rilke that in Russia his ideals merged with reality, that the Russian was an artist. “In your country,” he wrote to his Rus-\n\nsian friend Yelena Voronina (Kazitsina) on July 27, 1899, “everyone is a thinker, a philosopher—a poet, I might even say.”” Rilke’s sojourn in Russia helped him to recover the inner wholeness he had lost in the explorations of his youth, and to regain confidence in himself. In the summer of 1899 he felt certain that he was a poet and was finally convinced of his calling. He believed that “everything Russian” was the “best description” of his thoughts and feelings. “My art has become stronger and richer by the addition of immeasurable new territory,” he wrote Voronina, “and I return to my native land at the head of a long caravan of shining treasure.’\"*\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen he got back to Germany he threw himself heart and soul into the study of Russian and everything associated with Russia. Rilke told Voronina in a letter of July 27 that he was spending time “in the company of a Russian grammar,” and with such success that he was on the point of reading Pushkin and Lermontov in the original. “Lately,” he went on to say, “I have done a great deal of other reading: Tolstoy (I was especially impressed by his little sketch ‘Lucerne’) and Dostoyevsky, whose Brothers Karamazov | am still reading. Dostoyevsky has completely charmed me with his White Nights—how delightful they are! As for Garshin,* I have begun to fall under his spell, too.”” The views Rilke adopted under the influence of his Russian impressions found their way into his poems, prose, articles, and letters from the second half of 1899. Most of the poems written in September and October are included in the first part of The Book of Hours: The Book of the Monastic Life. In their first version these poems were called prayers, and the text that linked them was supposedly written by a monk who was an icon painter. In November 1899 Rilke wrote a cycle of short stories published the following year under the title The Book of God and Other Things. Three of them were dedicated to Russia: “How Old Timothy Sang, Dying...,” “Song of Truth,” and “How Betrayal Came to Russia.” His article “Russian Art,” which was written at this time and contained his general conception of Russia, is illustrated with paintings by Viktor Vasnetsov, whose work, in Rilke’s opinion, best expressed the national spirit. Early in 1900 Rilke made his first translations from the Russian, the most important of which was Anton Chekhov’s The Sea Gull, though this was unfortunately lost and no trace of it has come down to us. Thanks to his correspondence with Sofia Schill, Rilke was introduced to the work of the *Vsevolod Garshin (1855-88): Russian author of novellas.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nRussian peasant poet Spiridon Drozhzhin, a few of whose poems he translated into German. Then Rilke and Andreas-Salomé prepared to make a second, longer visit to Russia. In a letter of February 5, 1900, to Leonid Pasternak, the father of Boris Pasternak, Rilke wrote: Now first of all I must tell you that Russia, as I predicted to you, meant much more to me than a mere chance event. Ever since last August I have devoted myself almost exclusively to studying Russian art, Russian history and culture, and—I mustn’t omit this— your wonderful, peerless Russian language. Although I cannot speak it as yet, Ican without much effort read your great poets (and how great they are!}. I also understand most of what I hear spoken. What a pleasure it is to read the verse of Lermontov or the prose of Tolstoy in the original! What sheer delight! The immediate consequence of my efforts is that I feel an uncommon longing to go to Moscow and, if nothing unforeseen occurs, will join you there on April 1 (Russian calendar), this time to spend more time with your circle of friends, and spend it as one initiated and informed.” The instant Andreas-Salomé and Rilke arrived back in Moscow, on May 9, 1900, they plunged into its varied and unique life. Sofia Schill, who often saw them, described their stay in Moscow:\n\nLuisa Gustavovna, large and somewhat heavy, in reform clothes* of her own making and of an odd color; beside her a thin young man of middle height wearing a queer felt hat and a jacket covered with pockets. Rainer Osipovich was as fair of skin as a girl; his nose and oval *A manifestation of a movement at the time toward “natural” food and dress.\n\nIntroduction\n\nface were elongated; his large pale eyes gazed with the clarity of an infant’s upon these strange scenes. Nothing could have become him more than his little brown\n\ngoatee. This pair wandered about Moscow, the Arbat,* up and down alleys and side streets, holding hands like children, causing passers-by to smile and cast backward glances. But this did not disturb them. Often they had tea in taverns frequented by day laborers so as to hear their speech and talk to them. They spent their mornings in art galleries and museums. They attended church services. They joined the crowds at the Sukharev and Smolensk markets. They discovered the most remote corners of the city, unabashed by our dirt, rudeness, or hovels. Wherever they went they talked to the people, and according to their own testimony they were met everywhere with frankness, friendliness, and a desire to please. They were bent on discovering the true face of Russia. The further their explorations took them from the world of Europe and literature, the better they liked it. They made little use of the letters of introduction I gave them to my literary acquaintances. On the other hand, they were vastly interested in the people who attended my classes at the Prechistensky Workers’ School. On several occasions I held tea parties for them at which my foreign guests listened to what our weavers and typesetters had to say.... I found it fascinating to be present at meetings where our peasant workers spoke with representatives of Europe’s most refined culture. They were less interested in Russian workers’ first attempts to enter the political arena than in their daily lives, their village background, their wholesome roots: “the plowman’s *One of Moscow’s main streets.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nsoul has not yet been completely destroyed by the city and by living in workingmen’s barracks.” That is why they were particularly drawn to my peasant friend from Smolensk guberniya [province], now working as a warehouse attendant at the Kotov Textile Factory near Moscow. This man told them of the ecstasy he experienced when he was out alone tilling the fields in early morning, the air sharp and fresh, the spring sky filled with the singing of larks, the grass sparkling with dew.” On the evening of May 30, Lou Andreas-Salomé and Rilke set out on a long journey through Russia. Their first stop was at Yasnaya Polyana, Tolstoy’s country estate south of Moscow. Their experiences on this journey are best recorded in the letters they sent Sofia Schill. On June 2, Rilke gave her a colorful and detailed description of their second encounter with Tolstoy. Then, from Yasnaya Polyana, they took the train to Kiev, where they stayed some two weeks visiting the cathedrals of Sophia and Vladimir and the Kiev-Pechersky Monastery. After Kiev they went by steamer on the Dnieper to Kremenchug, crossed the entire Ukraine, and spent a few days in Poltava. Once more they traveled by train, passing through Kharkov and Voronezh on their way to the city of Saratov. There they boarded the river steamer Alexander Nevsky for a weeklong cruise up the Volga, stopping at all the large towns. The Volga scenery made a deep impression on Rilke, and the memory of it returned to him again and again in later years. “All that I had seen up to then,” he wrote on July 31, 1900, “was but a picture of country, river, world. Here was the real thing in natural size. I felt as if I had watched the Creation; few words for all that is, things made\n\non God the Father’s scale.”” The boat trip ended on July 2 at Yaroslavl. Rilke and Andreas-Salomé spent three days in the village of KrestyBogorodskoye, about three miles from Yaroslavl. “I spent three 15\n\nIntroduction\n\ndays in a little hut, living like a peasant among peasants,” Rilke wrote to his mother. “I slept without sheets and shared with my hosts the humble meals that they fitted into their hard labor now and then. The weather was fine, so this primitive life had much beauty in it... .”¥ From July 6 to 17 Rilke and Lou Andreas-Salomé stopped in Moscow, staying at the New Moscow Inn. On July 18 they went to the village of Nizovka in Tver guberniya, where for almost a week they were Drozhzhin’s guests. “Thanks to his great hospitality we feel very much at ease,” Rilke wrote Sofia Schill from Nizovka.* Their visit with Drozhzhin only deepened both travelers’ love and adoration for the simple folk. “Such poetry and tranquillity attend these people’s life of labor, such spiritual force, such spiritual power, that one is astonished and can only repeat Tolstoy’s words: ‘Go to the people and learn from them!’” (Letter from Lou AndreasSalome to Sofia Schill from Nizovka, July 20, 1900.)° The travelers returned to St. Petersburg at the end of July, stopping on the way for three days in Novgorod. AndreasSalomé then set out to visit her relatives on the Finnish coast, leaving Rilke alone in the city to study in the public library and at the Museum of Alexander III (now called the Russian Museum). His main interest was still in Russian art, especially the “World of Art” trend, whose searchings in many ways paralleled those of avant-garde German painters. It was during this period that he made the acquaintance of the painter and art critic Alexander Benois, a founder of, and a main contributor to, the magazine Mir iskusstva (World of Art). Their first meeting, on August 17 at the dacha in Peterhof, just outside of St. Petersburg, where Benois was then staying, initiated a lively correspondence and collabora-\n\ntion (1900-2). On August 22, 1900, Rilke and Lou Andreas-Salomé left St. Petersburg. Thus ended Rilke’s second and last trip to Russia. 16\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn his return to Germany, Rilke lived for some time in a painters’ colony in the North German village of Worpswede. The young poet became deeply attached to Heinrich Vogeler, the most outstanding representative of the group, to the painter Paula Becker-Modersohn, and to the sculptress Clara Westhoff, a talented pupil of Rodin’s who in March 1901 became Rilke’s wife. Recalling Rilke’s arrival in Worpswede in the summer of 1900, Heinrich Vogeler wrote: “He was at the time deeply influenced by the Russian character as described by Dostoyevsky. The catacombs of the Kiev churches had further strengthened his leanings toward mysticism. He had also visited Tolstoy. Many of his impressions were reflected in his art, much in the same way as Bohemian cut glass reflects the real world, with manifold variations enriching it and reproducing its form and color.” Rilke talked a good deal to his friends in Worpswede about Russia and her artistic life, hoping to interest them in Russian art. Acting as a link between Russian and German artists, he attempted to organize an exhibition of contemporary Russian art in Berlin. From 1900 to 1902, Rilke read a great deal in Russian, going beyond fiction and art criticism. He read Nikolai Chernyshevsky’s What Is to Be Done?, Pyotr Kropotkin’s Memoirs of a Revolutionist, Gogol’s essay on the Middle Ages. Of the latter he wrote (in Russian) to Alexander Benois on February 9, 1901: “Iam reading Gogol and cannot tear myself away. What a man! His essay ‘The Middle Ages’ is wholly delightful!”” Among the translations from the Russian Rilke made in 1900-2 was a fragment of Dostoyevsky’s Poor People (considered lost) and “Pilgrims,” a story by Vasily Yanchevetsky, a writer he had met in St. Petersburg in August 1900. What he had seen and experienced in the summer of 1900 is reflected in the second part of The Book of Hours, written 17\n\nIntroduction\n\nin September 1901 and subtitled On Pilgrimage. The background to almost every poem in this cycle is the vast expanse of Russia, her cities and steppelands, her pilgrims making their way to places of worship from towns as far away “as Tashkent and Tiflis.” Rilke’s love for Russia “had found sanctuary” in this book, as he wrote Leonid Pasternak in December 1906, when he sent him a copy. About a year after his second visit to Russia Rilke wrote an essay called “Basic Trends in Modern Russian Art,” in which he makes clear his view of its history and its future. At the end of 1900 Rilke had written six poems in Russian (two others were written in April 1901). One cannot help agreeing with the opinion of Lou Andreas-Salomé (to whom the poems were dedicated and presented) that “though the grammar is pretty awful, they still somehow are mysteriously poetic.” Rilke had begun writing in Russian as early as the summer of 1900 (letters to Drozhzhin and Sofia Schill). By late in that year he wrote Russian fluently. Rilke’s letter in Russian to Leonid Pasternak earned Pasternak’s boundless admiration. In his reply of January 2, 1901, Pasternak said: “I couldn’t believe my eyes! To have learned such a difficult language in one year, and so thoroughly as to be able to correspond in it! This is a feat so remarkable that I am still astounded; I show it to all my friends and they are as astounded as I am! Honor and glory to you!”” In late 1901 and early 1902 Rilke found himself in strained circumstances. His marriage to Clara Westhoff, the birth of a daughter, the acquiring of a home—all this demanded a steady income. At first he tried to find employment as an art reviewer for a German periodical, but this came to nothing. Gradually the idea of going to live in Russia took root in his mind, an idea first expressed in a New Year’s greeting to Benois in December 1901. On January 9, 1902, he wrote Leonid Pasternak: “If only I could find some modest situation in Moscow that would give me a marginal income and allow 18\n\nIntroduction\n\nme to go on with my work peacefully and without mundane worries, Iwould come and live in your country without a moment’s hesitation! As it is, Imiss Russia greatly and long to be there.” Two days later, in a letter to his friend Nicolai Tolstoy, Rilke exclaimed: “It becomes more and more clear to me that Russia is my native land—all others are alien to me.”” Eventually, Rilke decided to take some practical steps. With his letter of March 5, 1902, to Benois he enclosed a long letter to Alexei Suvorin, an eminent Russian publisher and publicist, in which he described his visits, his impressions, and his love for Russia. Hoping for Suvorin’s support, Rilke offered to work for Novoye vremya—one of Russia’s biggest newspapers at the beginning of the century, owned by Suvorin —and elaborated his reasons for deciding to take his family to Russia.\n\n“My wife,” wrote Rilke, “doesn’t know Russia; but I have told her so much about it that she is ready to leave her native land, which has become as alien to her as to me, and join me in making the move to your country—which is my own country spiritually. Ah, if only it turned out that we could live there for good! I believe this is possible—possible because I love your country, love its people, its suffering, and its greatness; love is the power and the ally of God.” Suvorin never answered this letter from an unknown German writer, and as it happened, Rilke soon abandoned the idea of going to live in Russia: on August 27, 1902, he went to Paris to write a book about Rodin. Nevertheless, his spiritual ties with Russia never weakened. In his letters to Lou Andreas-Salomé and his Russian friends, the theme of Russia and his nostalgic mood are ever-present. “When I was in Paris,” he wrote Lou Andreas-Salomé on August 15, 1903, “I seemed to be inexpressibly closer to Russia; and yet I feel that even here in Rome, as I contemplate the things of antiquity, I am preparing myself for things Russian, and for a return to them one day.” 19\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs he roamed through the countries of Western Europe he was\n\nalways meeting Russian\n\nartists, writers,\n\nactors; he\n\nwas always adding new friends to his old ones. On April 12, 1907, Rilke met Maxim Gorky on the island of Capri, an event he was to write about in several letters. Rilke’s attitude toward the famous Russian writer was ambivalent: although Gorky, as a man of the people who became a great artist, wholly conformed to Rilke’s image of the Russian character, his socialist views and his sociopolitical activities intimidated Rilke and made him distrust the Russian writer. The Russian theme did not stop turning up in Rilke’s poetry after 1902. We find it in the cycle “The Czars” from The Book of Images, completed in Paris in 1906, in the poem “Night Ride” from New Poems (August 1907), and, finally, in the “Russian” sonnet, the twentieth in Part I of his Sonnets to Orpheus (February 1922). The soul of Russia breathes in each of these works. His novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge is filled with Russian reminiscences. In fact, Rilke originally planned the book to culminate in the chapter on Tolstoy. Rilke’s spiritual development underwent significant changes over the years. Even so, in his basic ideas on life and art the mature Rilke of the Duino Elegies and Sonnets to Orpheus differs little from the author of The Book of Hours. With all his former vehemence he condemns the lack of spirituality and compassion in a modern world saturated with bourgeois values and relationships (see, for example, the third book of The Book of Hours and The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge). His rejection of a world divorced from God and Nature is as basic to his later outlook as it was to his earlier view. This finds fullest expression in his call for an intense inner life, both spiritual and emotional, an effort best furthered by solitary living, of which he always dreamed. Accordingly, in his intimate and confessional letter to Suvorin, Rilke speaks of himself as lonely and unwanted in his native land, of longing to lead a serious, solitary existence, out of which 20\n\nIntroduction\n\nwould emerge deep and tranquil poetry. Rilke realized his ideal of being an artist-recluse by moving, in 1921, into the ancient Swiss castle of Muzot. There he spent the last five years of his life, and there it was that fame and glory caught up with him—“the quintessence of all misconceptions that collect around a new name.” The number of Rilke’s readers and admirers grew quickly in postwar Europe, as his name became a symbol: a poet sequestering himself in a medieval tower from all world events, from war, revolution, inflation, misery, and ruin, became to\n\nmany the very personification of poetry, deepening of perception, and genuine creativity. People of different ages and callings, deeply dissatisfied with the place accorded things of the spirit in the modern world, turned to Rilke and his works, finding in them an antidote for their epoch. Marina Tsvetayeva wrote of him: Rilke is neither the mission nor the mirror of our times; he is their counterpoise. War, slaughterhouses, flesh shredded by discord—and Rilke. The earth will be forgiven for our times for the sake of Rilke, who lived in them. He could have been born only in our times because he is their opposite, because he is essential, because he is\n\nan antidote. That is what makes him our contemporary. The times did not commission him, they brought him forth. ... Rilke is as ineluctably necessary to our times as a priest is to the battlefield: to be for these and for those, for them and for us: to pray—for the enlightenment of the still living and at the parting from the fallen.* From January to August 1925 Rilke was again living in Paris. He showed the same lively interest in all things Russian that he had shown twenty-five years earlier, making new acquaintanceships and reviving old ones. Probably, as he looked back upon his life in anticipation of his fiftieth birthday, al\n\nIntroduction\n\nRilke felt as never before the strength of his spiritual ties with Russia, “that fabled land.” Once more he began reading Russian literature systematically, and he met with the eminent poet and prose writer Ivan\n\nBunin— “an exceedingly\n\npleasing figure,” as Rilke observed in a letter to L. P. Struve. He was especially taken by Bunin’s story “Mitya’s Love.” In Paris Rilke enjoyed attending the puppet theater directed by Yulia Sazonova (Slonimskaya), and there he renewed his acquaintance with Yelena Voronina, but this encounter brought disappointment to both of them. He wrote his friend Nanny Wunderly-Volkart, on March 3, 1925: Little by little I have been able to find most of the Russians I knew earlier.... Poor Yelena Voronina, whom I lost sight of twenty-six years ago because she did not care to tell me her new name after her marriage, which took place after I left St. Petersburg.... She is living here now with her husband, living among the émigrés, in poverty (she, for whom wealth had been a natural condition from the day of her birth!)—old, destitute, miserable, and, like all the Russians here, without hope for the future... .* Among the plans Rilke nurtured in his last days was that of writing a book about his Russian travels. He wanted to give new life to his memories, and thus the letter from Boris Pasternak, and the ensuing correspondence with Marina Tsvetayeva, came to him as a very pleasant surprise.\n\nAlthough coincidences often play a major role in people’s lives, scholarly works usually minimize their importance. In this case, however, coincidence cannot be ignored. 22\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn first arriving in Moscow in 1899, Rilke had called on a young professor at the School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named Leonid Pasternak. “On a beautiful spring day with the sun pouring its ecstasy over all things after a long hard winter,” recalls Leonid Pasternak, “I found a young man standing before me in my studio—a very young man, fair-haired and delicate-looking, wearing a dark green Tyrolese cape. In his hand he held letters of introduction from my friends in Germany, asking me to help him in word and deed to see our country and meet its people. If 1am not mistaken, they also asked me to arrange for him to meet Leo Tolstoy.” This request was not hard to grant, since Leonid Pasternak saw Tolstoy frequently at the time: he was illustrating Tolstoy’s novel Resurrection, which had been appearing in installments in the St. Petersburg magazine Niva since March 1899. On that very day Pasternak must have told Tolstoy about the guests from Germany, for on the evening of the next day, April 28, Rilke, Andreas-Salomé, and her husband visited Tolstoy at his home in the Khamovniki district of Moscow.\n\nLeonid Pasternak also introduced him to the well-known Russian sculptor Paolo (Pavel) Trubetskoy, who since 1897 had also been teaching at the School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. Trubetskoy had made a bust of Tolstoy and two statuettes, one of which, Tolstoy on Horseback, won the Grand Prix at the World Exposition in Paris in 1900. On leaving Moscow at the end of his first visit, Rilke wrote Leonid Pasternak: “Let me thank you once more for your friendly welcome and the help you so readily offered us. It was in your company that I spent the best, the most rewarding hours of my stay in Moscow.” A year later, chance brought Rilke and Leonid Pasternak together at a railroad station. Rilke was setting out to see Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, not knowing for certain whether 23\n\nIntroduction\n\nTolstoy was there. Pasternak, who was taking his family to Odessa, came to his aid by sending a telegram to Tolstoy. He wrote of this meeting: “Another curious coincidence was that my son Boris, then a ten-year-old schoolboy waiting with me for the train to leave, saw my young German friend for the first and last time in his life. Little did he or I dream that the great German poet was to wield such an influence over him in the future, and that Boris in his turn, through his translations, was to bring Rilke’s poetry to Russia’s new literaryicırelesuun Boris Pasternak\n\nhimself described this memorable encounter, thirty years later, in his autobiographical work Safe Conduct, dedicated to Rilke: On a hot summer day our express was about to leave Moscow’s Kursk Station. Just then someone in a dark Tyrolese cape approached our train window from the outside. A tall woman accompanied him. Father began talking to them about something that aroused the same warm interest in all three, but from time to time the woman exchanged brief remarks with Mother in Russian; the man spoke only German, and though I knew the language well, I had never heard it spoken as he spoke it. On our way, as we approached Tula, this same couple visited us in our compartment. They said that the express stopped at Kozlovka-Zaseka only on request and they were not sure that the head conductor would inform the engineer in time for them to get off at this stop.... They then took leave of us and went back to their car.... The faces and the incident were forgotten, presumably forever.* During his first visit to Italy, in 1904, Leonid Pasternak ran into Rilke on the streets of Rome. Rilke invited Pasternak to call on him and meet his young wife, Clara. “Unforgettable 24\n\nIntroduction\n\nare the hours we spent conversing with them,” Leonid Pasternak wrote. “Once again the main topic of conversation, out-\n\nside of art, was Rilke’s beloved Russia and Russian literature,\n\nof which he had made a serious study. With what knowledge and enthusiasm did he speak of the beauties of old Russian poetry, of The Lay of Igor’s Host, which he had read in the original.” (Rilke had not only read this classic of old Russian literature but even translated it into German.) The intervals between these meetings were bridged by letters and an exchange of books.” In December 1925, Western Europe joined in celebrating Rilke’s fiftieth birthday. Among the many greetings he received was a heartfelt one from Leonid Pasternak, who had been living with his wife and daughters in Berlin since 1921. In this letter Pasternak refers to still another encounter, their last, in a train in Switzerland. The poet’s reply to this greeting from his old friend, dated March 14, 1926, was the indirect cause of the correspondence between Rilke, Boris Pasternak, and Marina Tsvetayeva that soon began.\n\nMarina Tsvetayeva and Boris Pasternak were both from Moscow, both children of professors, both of roughly the same age. Their fathers came to Moscow from the provinces and, by virtue of their outstanding abilities, gained success and social position. The mothers of both were gifted pianists, pupils of Anton Rubinstein, though their careers as performers are not to be compared: Marina’s mother (née Meyn) was forbidden by her father to play in public, whereas Rosa Pasternak (née Kaufman) won a European name for herself in her youth and became a professor at the Petersburg Conservatory. Yet, when they got married, both women gave up 25\n\nIntroduction\n\nall thought of a professional career, to devote their talents to their children and families. The frequent trips which the Tsvetayev family made to Germany (1904-5) owing to the mother’s ill health, trips that gave Marina\n\nan intimate knowledge of German\n\nPensionen,\n\nmight be paralleled with the Pasternaks’ yearlong sojourn in Berlin in 1906 and young Boris Pasternak’s studies at Marburg University during the summer semester of 1912. Yet these similar childhood and adolescent experiences left entirely different imprints. Boris Pasternak emerged with a distaste for, and an inner struggle against, the romantic license and suicidal propensity associated with romanticism, and in the end he overcame them. Marina Tsvetayeva, on the contrary, regarded these qualities as basic to her life and art, and accordingly leaned upon them, cultivated them. By the outbreak of World War I Tsvetayeva’s talent was recognized by contemporary Russian poets of such authority as Valery Bryusov and Maximilian Voloshin, and she was gaining a name for herself in Moscow’s artistic circles. Before long she looked upon poetry as her destiny and mission. But it was not until the summer of 1913 that Pasternak, who had given more than ten years of his life to the study of musical composition and philosophy, began to write poems for his first youthful collection—an immature work for whose publication he was later to reproach himself. Pasternak’s early books of poetry were published as part of a futurist publishing venture and betrayed the effects of his dependence on a group, a trend. In the work and life of Rainer Maria Rilke, Pasternak found support and approval in his search for freedom and independence. Soon after he returned from Germany in 1907 he made the acquaintance of Rilke’s first collections—In Celebration of Myself, The Book of Hours, and The Book of Images—which had been presented to his father with inscriptions by the author. He was struck by their depth and seriousness, examples for which he remained 26\n\nIntroduction\n\ngrateful the rest of his life. In Pasternak’s university notebooks we find, interspersed with his lecture notes, his first attempts to translate Rilke.\n\nPasternak was not exaggerating when he said that Rilke laid the foundations for his spiritual development. The basis of Pasternak’s early rejection of romanticism was his striving toward perfection as a means of reshaping life. As early as 1910 he included the superb Danish prose stylist Jens Peter Jacobsen among his favorite authors, a novelist who had meant a great deal to Rilke, too. Prose became the musical and harmonic basis of his poetry. All the rest of his life he tried to impart the essence, the substance, with such concentrated vitality that the artistic form emerged naturally, as in a living organism. The life of the artist is a kind of ascetic novitiate, and the artist’s labors must be devoted to the task of giving verbal expression to an image of the world suffused with the joy of living, and with a feeling of kinship with all things. This becomes all the more necessary in time of tragedy and privation. Pasternak considered his first success in this respect the volume My Sister, Life, written in 1917. At the time of World War I and the Russian Revolution, Tsvetayeva and Pasternak were barely acquainted. According to Tsvetayeva:\n\nThree or four brief meetings. Almost without words, because I never want anything new. Heard him once giving readings with some other poets in the Polytechnical Museum. He spoke tonelessly and had forgotten most of the poems. His awkwardness on the stage reminded me of Blok.” He gave the impression of painful concentration, one wanted to push him—like a cart that is stuck—”Go on, go on!”—and since not a single word came across (a kind of mumbling, like a bear stretching * Alexander Blok (1880-1921), the great Russian symbolist poet.\n\n27.\n\nIntroduction\n\nitself} one couldn’t help thinking impatiently, “Good Lord, why torture yourself and others like this?”\n\nPasternak also remembered how taciturn their first meetings had been: “At a public poetry reading at the beginning of the revolution she was one of the poets I heard recite their works. Then, during one of the winters of War Communism, * I went to see her on some matter or other. I said nothing in particular, nor did she. Somehow Tsvetayeva didn’t impress me.”* In May 1922, after a long separation, Tsvetayeva rejoined her husband, Sergei Efron, who was then in Berlin. When Pasternak read her collection Versts, published in 1921, he immediately wrote her a letter full of admiration. Thirty-five\n\nyears later he recalled this in his autobiography: One had to read into her poetry. When I did this I was astounded by its immense strength and purity. Nothing comparable was being done at the time. Let me put it briefly: accepting the risk, I dare to assert that, with the exception of Annensky' and Blok and, with a few reservations, Andrei Bely,* the early Tsvetayeva was what all the other symbolists longed to be and were incapable of being. While they floundered in a sea of contrived schemes and lifeless archaisms, Tsvetayeva soared easily above the difficulties of creative work, achieving her tasks with superb ease and dazzling technique. In the spring of 1922, by which time she was already abroad, I bought her little volume called Versts. I was immediately struck by the lyrical power of her form, born of her life’s blood, strong-chested, fiercely com*The Bolsheviks’ stringent economic policy from 1918 to 1920.\n\nInnokenty Annensky (1856-1909): Russian poet, dramatist, essayist, translator, and classical scholar. *Russian symbolist novelist and poet (1880-1934).\n\n28\n\nIntroduction\n\npressed and condensed, not depending on individual lines, but captivating the attention by preserving the logical development of her stanzas without any interruption of rhythm. These qualities were close to my heart, perhaps because of the similar influences we had both been exposed to, or similar motivations in the forming of our characters, the similar role of the family and music, the similarity of the sources from which our aims and choices sprang. I wrote to her in Prague a rap-\n\nturous letter full of amazement that I had so long passed over her, failed to appreciate her. She answered my letter. We began to correspond, most frequently in the mid-twenties, when her Craft was published, and a little later when copies of her larger works—the striking, sweeping, innovative “Poem of the End,” “Poem of the Mountain,” and “The Pied Piper”—circulated in Moscow. We became friends.* In 1975, in the journal Zvezda, Tsvetayeva’s daughter, Ariadna Efron, wrote brilliantly and concisely about the friendship, collaboration, and genuine love between the two writers, as expressed in the poems, prose, and critical notes they sent to each other, and especially in their extraordinary letters. In her will she stipulated that most of this correspondence not be published until the next century. Its eventual publication will be an invaluable contribution to Russian literature and its history.\n\nAriadna Efron writes that the Tsvetayeva-Pasternak correspondence extended from 1922 to 1935, reaching its peak in the twenties, then gradually falling off. The two poets never met during this period; although they often planned a meeting, it was invariably postponed for one reason or another. In the early twenties Pasternak was destitute; he had 29\n\nIntroduction\n\nno means of supporting his family. At the same time, he was becoming more and more convinced of the insignificance of all he had written since My Sister, Life and Themes and Variations (1917-18). He came to doubt that the writing of lyrical poetry was justified in the times in which he lived, and he began to feel that such an occupation was both useless and unethical, that wars and revolutions required historians or writers of epics. Interestingly, a similar feeling inspired Tsvetayeva to write essays such as “Art in the Light of Conseieneel Pasternak recalled that, around this time, when he asked a delegation of German proletarian expressionist poets about Rilke, they had not even heard of him. One, more informed than his colleagues, said, “Rilke! Er ist ja so gut wie tot!”* And it was at this very time that Rilke’s Duino Elegies and Sonnets to Orpheus were published—his best work, the very poems that earned him immortality. There was indeed good cause for despair. Pasternak shared his doubts with Tsvetayeva, and she was delighted to be his confidante: “Boris, this is the first really human letter from you (the rest are Geisterbriefe') and I am flattered, rewarded, borne aloft,” she wrote on July 19, 1925. “You found me worthy of reading your intimate notes.” In this same letter Tsvetayeva foretold where his mood was leading him: “I can’t understand you. Stop writing poetry? And then what? Jump off the bridge into the Moscow River? With poetry, dear friend, as with love: no separation until it drops you. You are the lyre’s thrall.” From then on Tsvetayeva’s understanding and support were vitally important to Pasternak. That summer, with her approval and encouragement, he began the poem The Year 1905. It was difficult for him to switch from lyric to epic po*Rilke? Why, he’s as good as dead. TGhost letters.\n\n30\n\nIntroduction\n\netry, but since he nurtured the idea of writing a long novel in prose, he forced himself to regard this as necessary training. In early August 1925, Tsvetayeva passed on to Pasternak\n\nrumors that Rilke had died. His reply, of August 16, asked her to verify the rumors and tell him the circumstances of Rilke’s death. So distraught was he that in a letter to his sister Josephine he mentioned that he had premonitions of his own imminent death.\n\nIt was not only his long separation from his parents and sisters (resident in Germany since 1921) that led Pasternak to apply for permission to go abroad with his family, but also his longing to meet Tsvetayeva. He had a growing awareness of the importance of The Year 1905, Lieutenant Schmidt, and Spektorsky, major poems written while he was in constant contact with Tsvetayeva, his first reader and critic. He believed that she alone could fully appraise the tasks he set himself, his method of solving them, and his success in doing so. Tsvetayeva wrote of this to Leonid Pasternak on February 5, 1928: Boris is marvelous! And how little he is understood, even by those who love him! “His feeling for words... ,” “Words as an end in themselves... ,” “The independent life of words... .”—when all his work, every single line, is a fight for essence, when he cares not a fig for anything but essence (of course, as a poet, it is through words that he frees himself). “Difficult form” indeed! Not difficult form but difficult essence! His hastily written letters are not a bit “easier” than his verse. Don’t you agree? I can see from his last letters that he is lonely in art. Most of the praise he receives refers to the theme of 1905—he is receiving certificates of honor, so\n\nto speak, for his being a good boy.\n\nPasternak finished The Year 1905 in the spring of 1926, still battling his sense of hopelessness and crisis. He was 31\n\nIntroduction\n\nhelped to a recognition that he could go on living—and even make happy plans for the future—by reading Tsvetayeva’s “Poem of the End” and by learning that Rilke was alive and knew of him and his work.\n\nFor Pasternak Rilke offered the example of a poet who had disengaged himself from German romanticism for the sake of European unity and the movement toward realism in contemporary art. Tsvetayeva considered Rilke the personification of the poetic spirit, but he also embodied the romanticized Germany she loved so dearly. “Rilke was my last Germany. My beloved language, my beloved land...just what Russia was for him (the Volga world),” wrote Tsvetayeva.* She called Germany “my passion, my native land, the cradle of my soul.”*® Tsvetayeva’s mother had inculcated in her daughters a love of Germany and a thorough knowledge of its language when they were still children. In her memoirs Anastasia Tsvetayeva,\n\nMarina’s\n\nsister, writes:\n\n“My\n\nmother,\n\nwho\n\nwas\n\ndeeply attached to her father, told us about traveling abroad with him, about their journeys down the Rhine, that legendary river flowing between high banks, about ancient castles on promontories, about the Lorelei, where the nymph sang. We learned about her from Heine’s famous poem. The green and foaming Rhine became a part of our lives.” In the autumn of 1904, at the age of twelve, Marina saw Germany with her own eyes when her parents transferred her and Anastasia from Lausanne, where they had been studying in a Catholic boarding school, to Freiburg. They spent the winter there, in the Brinck Boarding School, while their mother followed her doctor’s recommendation and took the mountain air of the Black Forest for her consumption. Im32\n\nIntroduction\n\npressions of this winter are reflected in Marina’s adolescent poems, later included in her first book, Evening Album (1910). Apparently it was on this visit that she made her first serious acquaintance with German literature: Anastasia recalls that in Freiburg Marina “threw herself into reading German books with complete absorption.”* In letters and in a questionnaire she sent to Pasternak (see Chapter 2), Tsvetayeva referred to German as second only to Russian as her favorite language, and alluded to her constant reading of favorite German authors, especially Goethe. Tsvetayeva probably read Rilke’s Book of Hours in 1912-13, when that volume came as a revelation to Moscow intellectuals. In a letter to Rilke of May 12, 1926, Tsvetayeva wrote: “The Beyond (not the religious one, more nearly the geographic one) you know better than the Here, this side, you know it topographically, with all its mountains and islands and castles. “A topography of the soul—that’s what you are. And with your Book (oh, it was not a book after all, it was becoming a book!) of Poverty, Pilgrimage, and Death you have done more for God than all the philosophers and priests taken together.” Tsvetayeva began her dialogue with Rilke by saying, “You are the very incarnation of poetry.” For Tsvetayeva, Rilke was a poet of the first order, an artist creating things immortal. In her very first words to Rilke she hastened to distinguish him from the contemporary world she hated (“Your name does not rhyme with our time—stems from earlier or later—has always been”). Time and again she asserted that Rilke was the incarnation of poetry, as in her letter to Anna Teskovä of January 15, 1927: “The German Orpheus, that is, Orpheus who this time has made his appearance in Germany. Not Dichter* (Rilke)—Geist der Dichtung.”\"* And in a letter *A poet.\n\nThe spirit of poetry.\n\n33\n\nIntroduction\n\nto Charles Vildrae written in 1930: “... you and I are bound by ties of kinship: you love Russia and Pasternak—and especially Rilke, who is not a poet but poetry itself.”* Tsvetayeva’s conviction that poetry is the timeless, immortal, transcendent spirit made manifest in the temporal realm by its “bearers”—poets—was expressed in her first letter to Rilke; she also spoke of it in her essay “A Poet on Criticism” and elaborated it in the analysis of Sonnets to Orpheus contained in her letter of May 12, 1926, to Rilke. This conception of poetry was so congenial to him that he instantly recognized their spiritual affinity. The idea of the immortality of the soul caught in a cycle of births and deaths was adopted by the romantics from the Orphic school. Orpheus, the school’s poet and prophet, was Rilke’s and Tsvetayeva’s chosen hero. The concept gained many followers. Pasternak spoke of it in his Safe Conduct: “It was a concept of life as the life of the poet. It came to us from the symbolists, who took it from the romantics, especially the German romantics. ...In its symbolism, that is, in all that imaginatively touches upon the Orphic and Christian schools in their presentation of a standard of life for which the poet pays with his life, the romantic conception is irresistibly attractive and incontrovertible.” The young Pasternak could not remain indifferent to the beauty and brilliance of this view, and, as he confessed, he was only one of many. Later he completely liberated himself from it by concentrating on his craft and deliberately refusing to poeticize.\n\nAs he matured, he adopted another concept, which he uncovered in the spring of 1913 in “Symbolism and Immortality” and summarized nearly fifty years later in his autobiographical essay “People and Circumstances.” Pasternak considered that “when any man dies there remains some of that undying subjectivity which was part of him when alive and which constitutes his contribution to 34\n\nIntroduction\n\nhuman existence.” He believed that this deathless subjectivity, which is separate from the individual, “this patch, this fragment of the universal soul common to all mankind, represents a timeless cycle of action and is the principal matter of art.” In other words, “while the artist, like everyone else, is mortal, the joy of existence that he experiences is deathless and, with some approximation of his personal and immediate experience, can be experienced by others centuries later through his works.” Pasternak spoke in a letter to Rilke about the poet “who is himself always the essence of poetry, called though he may be by different names at different times.” The four lines of poetry Rilke wrote on the flyleaf of the copy of the Duino Elegies he presented to Tsvetayeva at Pasternak’s request may be seen as a paraphrase of these words: We touch With very One poet Who bore\n\neach other. How? With wings that beat, distance touch each other’s ken. only lives, and now and then him, and who bears him now, will meet.\n\nThe poet lives not today but always, not in history but in time, not in the moment but in infinity. The eternal kinship of poets in time—that is the theme of the quatrain, and in this light must be understood its concluding words, about the individual bearing the burden of the poetic gift, about the “poet” in the “man.” These four lines were the prologue to Rilke’s ensuing correspondence with Tsvetayeva. She took up the idea and further developed the image. In her first letter to him she spoke of Rilke the man and Rilke the spirit, “who is still greater than the poet.” In other words, she clearly delineated two aspects of his life: the real, everyday aspect, subject to time, and the spiritual, metaphysical aspect, beyond time. The theme “man and poet” was continued in her letters of May 12 and 35\n\nIntroduction\n\n13, with the image of Saint George mounted on a horse, the subject of a cycle of poems she had written earlier (included in the volume Craft), symbolizing the indivisibility of man\n\nand poet, with one (the man) “bearing” the other (the poet). Elaborating the idea that Rilke was not a poet but poetry itself, Tsvetayeva said in her first letter: “You are a phenomenon of nature”; then: “You are the fifth element incarnate”: poetry itself or (still too little) that whence poetry comes to be and which is greater than it (you).” She wrote the same to Pasternak in an early letter to him (February 11, 1923): “You are a phenomenon of nature.” These words are basic to an understanding of Tsvetayeva’s conception of poetry and life. Tsvetayeva’s spiritual nature was formed at the turn of the century. In her own way she adopted the views and outlook of that neoromantic epoch: the pathos of revolt against God, against rationalism, the acceptance of the romantic cult of the “soul.” Critics writing of Tsvetayeva spoke of her “Dionysian leanings.” Tsvetayeva, like Rilke, often employed the concept of “Nature” in the spirit of the times, which attributed special powers to it, deified it, spiritualized it, especially in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Accordingly, the human spirit, an integral part of Nature, is of prime importance. Tsvetayeva assumed that spirit and Nature merge and are at times interchangeable. “Nothing touches me but Nature, i.e., the soul; and the soul, i.e., Nature,” she wrote to Teskova\n\non December\n\n12, 1927.” Nature—sentient\n\nnature,\n\nto be exact—was for Tsvetayeva the source of all life, poetry, and creative energy. “The poet is nature and not a contemplation of it,” she declared categorically in one of her letters.* Poetry that is not the personification of Nature, of the soul, did not exist for her. She wholly accepted the romantic poet Vasily Zhukovsky’s statement that “Romanticism is the spirit” and considered it her duty to elevate the spirit, which “Literally: quintessence. [M. Ts.]\n\n36\n\nIntroduction\n\nshe felt was crushed, despised, and undefended in the world about her. The contemporary world was to her a kingdom of middle-class ignorance, of the commonplace and the everyday, in which lies and imitations prevailed. Tsvetayeva called it “the world of the body” as opposed to “the world of the spirit.” She vehemently rejected love, or what was accepted as love in “the world of the body.” Perhaps overemphasizing the gulf between soul and body, she referred again and again to the antagonism between the soul and love. She wrote of her “dislove of love.” In her letters to Rilke we find such phrases as “love hates the poet,” and “I do not love love, I hold it in contempt.” In her letter to Pasternak of July 10, 1926, she spoke of “the ancient, insatiable hate of Psyche for Eve—Eve, of whom there is nothing in me. Of Psyche— everything.” And in the same letter: “I do not understand the flesh as such and deny that it has any rights whatsoever.” Tsvetayeva often sang the praises of Psyche in verse, and called herself Soul. “Soul, that is my name,” she said in a letter to Rilke of February 8, 1926. The words she wrote in May\n\n1938,\n\nwhen\n\nNazi\n\nGermany\n\nwas\n\npreparing\n\nto invade\n\nCzechoslovakia, are typical: “I see Czechoslovakia as a free spirit over which the body has no power.” The world of genuine love—in which there was a union of souls, not of bodies—was the sublime, radiant, beautiful world Tsvetayeva created in her poetry, and in this sense her dialogue with Rilke was a dialogue between lovers. She recalled the words spoken by the poet Voloshin when they first met, in 1911: “When you love a person, you want him to leave you so that you can dream of him.”® In her poetry as in her life, Tsvetayeva created situations isolating those who loved, including herself, so that they could not meet physically. She did not deny the accepted attributes and manifestations of carnal love—she used them in her poetry—but she always sought to strip them of their corporeal carapace, freeing them from the bonds of base matter 37\n\nIntroduction\n\nand gross sensuality. She wrote to Rilke on August 2, 1926: “Why do I tell you all this? From fear, perhaps—you might take me for generally passionate (passion—bondage.” She went on to explain: “I sound quite different from passion.” Tsvetayeva extols “the handclasp without hands,” “the kiss without lips.” The following is from a poem she wrote in 1922:\n\nIn the world where the streams run back, On the banks of—a stream, Into a dream hand take Another hand’s dream.“ And on August 22 she wrote to Rilke: “I do not live in my lips, and he who kisses me misses me.” One of the leitmotifs of her letters to him is “freedom from desire.” In these letters, as in all of Tsvetayeva’s epistolary prose, we find the touching of imaginary hands, the touching of words, the “meeting of souls.” For Tsvetayeva such a meeting was not a play of fancy; it was indisputable, a given. The touch of a word was for her as real an act as the touch of a hand. In that letter of August 22 she also asserted: “Love lives on words and dies of deeds.” And “The word, which for me is already the thing, is all I want.” Thus “I love you” for her encompassed all the raptures and vicissitudes of love. She created a new reality, the reality of the spirit. And the more passionate and sensual her language in the ordinary sense, the more ideal it was in the poetic sense.\n\nHers, then, was a romantic and complex love aspiring toward the unattainable, the unachievable, the impossible, and based on the antithesis of the real and the ideal. Such a dualism assumes that the unachievable here is possible there. As Tsvetayeva wrote to Anatoly Steiger, “Don’t forget that the apparent impossibility of something is the first sign of its naturalness—in a different world, obviously.” 38\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis same duality is evident in Tsvetayeva’s attitude toward Rilke’s death: “This is the first time the best for me and the best on this earth have coincided. Isn’t it only natural that he should have gone? How do you regard life? For you his death is not in the natural order of things. For me his life is not in the natural order of things, is in a different order, is itself a different order,” she wrote to Pasternak on February 9, 1927, candidly contrasting her romantic perception of life with his acceptance of “the joy of existence.” Tsvetayeva felt that the farther one got from reality, the nearer one came to the ideal; the farther away from each other people were in reality, the closer they were in spirit, as she expressed in her August 22, 1926, letter to Rilke: “The farther from me—the further into me.” Characteristically, Tsvetayeva utterly ignored this world and elevated the other world to the absolute. She wrote to Pasternak on January 1, 1927: “How well I know the other one! From dreams, from the ambient air of dreams, from the density, the essentiality of dreams. And how little I know of this one, how much I dislike it, and how hurt I have been by it! But the other one—just imagine!—light, radiance, things illuminated quite differently, with your light and mine!” In her creative work Tsvetayeva tried to rectify this imbalance: “With my fancies I push my way through to the pith of things.”* In the context of her poetry, “fancies” meant Uthenideal™ Tsvetayeva’s concept of dreams derived from the same romantic approach. She regarded dreams as a means of escape from real life. It is significant that Calderön’s play Life Is a Dream was held in great esteem by German romantics and Russian symbolists. Dreams seemed more real as well as more exalted than waking life—manifestations of a different, incorporeal world, in which souls lived and communed. For that reason Tsvetayeva thought communication in dreams more ideal and satisfying than communication in waking life. 39\n\nIntroduction\n\n“My favorite means of communication is otherworldly—to dream: to see in one’s dreams,” she wrote to Pasternak on 19, 1922. In a letter to Steiger on August 8, 1936, she wrote, “This, and this only, is how I want it to be be-\n\nNovember\n\ntween us: in dreams while awake, in dreams while asleep, entering into a dream with you and living in it.”° She touched on this theme in her letter to Rilke of June 14, 1926, and developed it in the culminating letter of August 2. “When somebody dreams of us together—that is when we shall meet,” she assured him. And in her letter of January 1, 1927, written after his death, she implored: “Beloved, come to me often in my dreams—no, not that. Live in my dreams.”\n\nIn her notebook Tsvetayeva daily wrote down the poems and prose she was composing and fragments that later became letters. Sometimes she did not bother to copy out her notes, as in her letter to Pasternak on February 14, 1925: “This is a chance something, Boris, out of my poetry notebook; the rest has blurred and evaporated. My life consists of an unending conversation with you. I am writing to you on a leaf from that same notebook, my very own notebook, as on a leaf from my soul.” These letters are an integral part of her creative work and difficult to characterize. In no way can they be considered traditional epistolary prose. Communion with those akin to her in spirit evoked a creative mood approaching the ecstatic. Tsvetayeva rushed headlong into each new friendship, giving herself to it wholly. In letters to someone she worshiped she made no effort to restrain her passion, her impulsiveness, even obsessiveness. Indeed, her attitude toward letters themselves was highly romantic. “A letter is like an otherworldly communication, less perfect than a dream but subject to the same rules,” she wrote to Pasternak on November 19, 1922. “Neither the one nor the other can be produced on command: you neither write a letter nor dream a 40\n\nIntroduction\n\ndream when you want to but when it wants to: the letter—to be written; the dream—to be dreamed.”\n\nIn her correspondence with Pasternak, Steiger, Alexander Bachrach, and a few others, Tsvetayeva was very much conscious of herself as an artist, and she did create works of art. She could not have poeticized more completely—or, in a sense, more destructively—her relationships with these people whom, as a rule, she had never seen, or seen but a few chance times. Yet she treated every letter as an artistic undertaking, made of it a work of literature, an outpouring of her soul. Such were all her letters to Rilke—a peculiar, untraditional literary genre that might be called epistolary lyric poetry. Again and again Tsvetayeva insisted that she was concerned with life, not literature. The false and the contrived were repugnant to her. She was contemptuous of literature that did not reflect life and nature, regarding it as aestheticism, ironically referring to such literature as belles lettres, as in her letter to Rilke of May 12, 1926. She demanded of poetry, as a whole and in its every line, “the truth of this moment,” to quote her letter to Rilke of August 22. All her work is connected with facts, events, or emotional experiences in her life. She avoided inventing characters, preferring at times to draw upon myth and legend. Much of Tsvetayeva’s prose is addressed to people she knew personally (Bryusov, Bely, Voloshin, the poet and novelist Konstantin Balmont, the poet and playwright Mikhail Kuzmin, Sofia Holliday, and others), but her reminiscences bear little resemblance to traditional memoirs. Using as a point of departure certain individual characteristics that she remembered, Tsvetayeva constructed an artistic image, unfailingly remodeling and re-creating her character. Convinced that “the imagination rules the world” —a quotation from Napoleon used as an epigraph to a chapter in Evening Album—she assumed the greatest license in dealing with reality. “She created whatever she wished, paying little attention\n\nto actuality,” wrote\n\nher sister, Anastasia, 41\n\nIntroduction\n\nreproaching Marina for lack of restraint, for wantonly distorted portraits of their mutual friends. “The memory is compliant, and for me it is identical with the imagination,” Tsvetayeva wrote to Vladimir Sosinsky,“ and this was ultimately her point of view. Many of Tsvetayeva’s letters have this same creative cast. An unexpected encounter or a letter written for some definite purpose often served merely as an occasion to raise the theme to a different level, to a higher, poetic one. Tsvetayeva often forgot about the real person she was writing to, carried away by an image that the moment’s inspiration dictated. The worldly, commonplace attributes of her correspondent interested her only to the extent that they lent detail to the image. This led to the breathtaking flights and tragic falls of Tsvetayeva’s writing, as can be seen vividly in her letters to Rilke. Immersed in the creation of an atmosphere of spiritual communion, she failed to notice the actual man, who at that time was mortally ill. His repeated attempts to draw her attention to this offended her: she thought he was trying to resist her impulsive outbursts simply to preserve his tranquillity. No doubt Rilke was so exhausted by her lack of understanding that he stopped answering her letters; she lost touch with him several months before he died. To judge by his letters, Rilke at first placed great trust in Tsvetayeva and fully sympathized with her. Pasternak’s first letter acted as a tuning fork, immediately setting the key of kinship among the three of them, determining the character, style, and tone of their dialogue. Their correspondence was the conversation of people who understood one another with the utterance of but a single word, as if they had been initiated into one and the same mystery and felt no need to explain it to one another. The uninitiated reader must labor over the reading of their letters and poems. The best example of their esoteric style is the wonderful “Elegy” Rilke wrote to Tsvetayeva as part of this correspondence. But their corre42\n\nIntroduction\n\nspondence as a whole creates the impression at times that they were conspirators, accomplices, mutually aware of something no one else knew about. Each saw in the other a poet close in spirit and equal in strength. It was a colloquy and contest of equals—a luxury Tsvetayeva had dreamed of all her life. “The only equals in strength I ever met were Rilke and Pasternak,” she declared in 1938.” Rilke (or, rather, the image of Rilke that Tsvetayeva created in her letters to him) was the only person "
