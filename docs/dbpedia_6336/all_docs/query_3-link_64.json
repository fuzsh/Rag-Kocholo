        "text": "Giuseppina Larocca's research while affiliated with University of Florence and other places Publication (1) Publication Preview New Perspectives on Jacob von Stählin: Towards an Intellectual Biography Article Jun 2018Slavonica Giuseppina LaroccaGiuseppina Larocca The article is devoted to Jacob von Stählin, an important figure of the eighteenth-century Russian Culture. The contribution is an attempt to reconstruct his intellectual biography based on new archival researches. The role of Stählin from the 1735 to his death is provided, paying particular attention to his work as a poet and his contribution to the Academy of Sciences and the artistic activities.\n\nThe establishment of the imperial state by Peter the Great led to the birth in Russia of the modern literary system. The Imperial Sublime examines the rise of the Russian empire as a literary theme alongside the creation and evolution of modern Russian poetry between the 1730s and 1840. Arising from the need to glorify the Russian state and its expanding territories, the imperial theme quickly became enmeshed in a wider range of issues, from formal problems of genre, style and lyric voice to the vexed relationship between the poet and Russia's ruling monarchs. From this arose a specifically Russian tradition of linking poetics and politics, which I term the \"imperial sublime.\" Whether utilised in praise of the tsar or to question his authority, the imperial sublime provided a powerful means of formulating the relationship of poetic language to the state: the reconstruction of this genealogy allows us to see the connections between Petrine ideologies of the state Boileau's revival of the Longinian sublime, and the enthusiastic adaptation in Russia of new genres such as the ode and even the elegy."
