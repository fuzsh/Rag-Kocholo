An isokinetic trainer, the device was the brainchild of legendary swim coach James “Doc” Councilman and Mini-Gym president Glen Henson. They saw it as a breakthrough in the sports equipment industry. It allowed athletes to do any number of reps at max effort because the machine adjusted with every rep as athletes became fatigued.\n\nMany people heralded the Leaper for its ability to help athletes make big gains in their vertical jump. Indiana basketball star Kent Benson claimed that, after a summer’s work on the Leaper, his vertical jump improved by 4 to 6 inches. He led Indiana to the 1976 NCAA basketball title, which helped the marketing. So did several newspaper articles and even a Sports Illustrated feature on athletes benefiting from the new technology. The company sold over ten thousand Leapers in the 1970s and 1980s. NASA even launched a Leaper into space to help Skylab astronauts maintain their strength in zero gravity.\n\nAn Expensive Clothing Rack\n\nMy experience with the Leaper (which, in homage to jackrabbits, I nicknamed the Lepus) was different. My athletes hated it. After using it for a month, they draped their warmup jackets and pants on it. Despite the hype, why didn’t they like the Leaper?\n\nFor one thing, there was nothing “tangible” indicating strength gains. Athletes would watch a manual dial. The faster they applied force, the higher up the dial moved. This seemed to be an immediate turn-off. As I think about this now, the best explanation may be in one of the many great lines Carl Valle has presented on issues related to analysis and feedback: “Imagine if we painted over the numbers on weight plates and only eyeballed vertical jumps. Most coaches would cry heresy or think one is crazy.”\n\nPerhaps my athletes chose to use the Leaper as a clothing rack for the same reasons. The only way they could gauge their progress was by way of that force dial, which was cheap and clunky-looking even by 1970s standards. Henson himself was not satisfied with mechanical assessment monitor on those early units. Current models now have LCDs that count reps, measure power output and work in foot-pounds, and provide an average work number for all reps done—all good things. And other current products, such the 1080 Quantum Robotic System discussed in a previous blog, that provide meaningful data while continually challenging athletes to achieve higher levels of force, power, and speed.\n\nMy Leaper experience became the first of many “epiphany moments” during my track and field career. It pointed out to me the importance of creating the kind of progressively demanding training activities that provide valuable feedback, so athletes maintain their focus and their interest remains high.\n\nIntroducting Split Jumps\n\nOne example of this is “Split Jumps.” Originally, this in-place alternating-leg jump movement involved a couple of cones and short sections of fiberglass rods. Athletes began at a lower height—like 2 to 3 inches—and progressed to higher heights—4 to 6 inches. I drilled holes in the cones so advancing to a higher height was easy.\n\nHow do I complex that drill once athletes get bored with the initial movement?\n\nFirst, I add a lateral jump component. They jump sideways, clearing one set of cones, and then go back to their original position.\n\nVideo 1. Split Jump with lateral component.\n\nNext, I have athletes go two at a time while attempting 180s without breaking stride. The key here is to have athletes make their rotations both to the right and left. Some athletes have a natural rotational bias to turn one way. Making them go the opposite way is challenging.\n\nVideo 2. Splits Jumps with 180 complex.\n\nI further complex the tandem jumps by bouncing, lobbing, or chest-passing a med ball to athletes. The goal is catching and firing the ball back without breaking the movement. These throwbacks involve eccentric contractions. They should be fast and explosive. Athletes should not bring the ball to their chests before releasing. This is not easy, especially when the ball is bounced or lobbed. I also fake the toss, looking at one athlete but throwing to the other. This action further forces concentration. If an athlete stops because he has broken his rhythm or disengages the rod, he could still get hit with the ball if he is not looking ahead. Athletes watching this exercise enjoy seeing a teammate get plunked.\n\nVideo 3. Splits Jumps with med ball pass.\n\nDuration and Safety Concerns\n\nHow long do I keep them split jumping? Early in the season, until one of them breaks stride or drops mishandles a med ball. Two new athletes take their place. As they get better, I stop when they begin slowing down, which is clear from their longer ground contact times.\n\nFor safety reasons, I stopped using fiberglass rods and went with 2×4 foam blocks that are 36 inches long. Our pit reconditioner supplies these for free. The next clip shows the foam block in the horizontal position.\n\nVideo 4. Foam blocks enhance athlete safety.\n\nI can complex the drill, either by having athletes go from the 2-inch height (horizontal) to 4-inch (vertical) or, as in this last clip, by having athletes attempt the “top-of-the-line,” a clean 360 without any break in movement. This is the most difficult way I can complex the activity. Runners like to get to this point because they know it’s hard to do. Teammates enjoy watching someone attempting a 360. They are pretty vocal when he sticks a clean one going both to the right and left without ever breaking stride. Incidentally, the athletes in these last two clips are distance runners.\n\nVideo 5. Add a 360 to the split jump without a break in movement.\n\nWhat do I most like about these split jumps? For one, they can be done in limited space. We have no indoor facility. To avoid having to come back later in the evening to use the gym after basketball practices, we work out in a classroom or the high school hallways. The first three clips take place in one corner of my assistant coach’s tech lab!\n\nMost important is that split jumps are just fun to do. They engage the athletes in various levels of complexity. Concentration and arousal are always high.\n\nForty years after the dawn of the Leaper, my athletes now have a few more protocols on which they can confidently hang their hats.\n\nReference\n\nThe Leaper: Isokinetic Resistance Exercise\n\nPlease share so others may benefit.\n\n.\n\nThe post By Leaps and Bounds: My Evolution to the Split Jump appeared first on Freelap USA.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWhy Bar Displacement Is a Hidden Gem in the Weight Room\n\nBy Carl Valle\n\nAs someone who has used every device on the market, I place my priorities on what is important, not what is exciting. The boring reality is that most problems in the weight room are not new. In this article, I will address having more success in the weight room with bar tracking technology. The GymAware system is a great option for looking at the velocity of exercises, and displacement is a lesser-known but still vital measurement we need to do better with.\n\nWe pay considerable attention to bar velocity and exercise wattage, but not enough into sharpening the basic need of doing things right versus doing them with higher speeds or forces. For example, take the need to squat deeply, based on anatomy and skill level. We need to focus on doing the key core movements better early, then refine output as athletes evolve in training.\n\nDisplacement in the weight room: what, why, who, and when\n\nDefining displacement is difficult as it covers a lot of movements. I looked at everything I did in the last ten years and compared it to what I have been doing since I started doing more bar tracking. What seems simple—like asking how deep one squats—was an easy answer years ago, as most referred to milestones such as “below parallel” or even “90 degrees.” At first glance, this is convenient, something simple we can refer to. But when things don’t work out with the simple we have to go back to the drawing board.\n\nDisplacement is a measurement of change between different starting and stopping points in time of exercises based on a static reference landmark.\n\nI revised this summary several times before finally accepting it. The primary rationale is that it fits every exercise and forces coaches to ask what information they want to know about their program. What I had thought was a simple measurement or metric turned into a Cambrian explosion of important data.\n\nWhy should you want displacement, to see how distance and time create forces or control them? Work can be teased out, the technique can be properly evaluated, and even safety can be enhanced with bar displacement.\n\nAthletes doing strength and power training can benefit by recording the displacement of their barbell stroke. Athletes without barbells can benefit as well. Many youth and aged athletes use dumbbells and sandbags to create external loading after they perform unloaded motions.\n\nThe best time to look at displacement is when athletes are introduced to formal training with loading and teaching, meaning exercises that develop athleticism outside teaching specialized or game-specific movements.\n\nAthletes doing strength and power training can benefit by recording the displacement of their barbell stroke.\n\nClick To Tweet\n\nWhat coaching or training benefits does bar displacement provide?\n\nNow that the technical side is covered, let’s get down to business regarding what coaches want to know about the above information. I will boil down the needs to very explicit benefits with regards to bar displacement here.\n\nObjective feedback and recording: Full and appropriate ranges have always been athlete perception versus coaching observation. While the data from coaches is likely to be strong enough, it’s always a matter of the athlete knowing versus coach telling and remembering. Bar tracking helps athletes see if they are doing what they are supposed to do, without creating negative subjective feedback from a coach.\n\nOrthopedic health and management: Sometimes a movement may need to have specific ranges of motions to be mechanically safe to soft and hard tissue structures. Each athlete has a general biomechanical path that allows for effective and safe motion.\n\nWorkload scoring and typing: Work is a product of factors like distance, load, time, and other variables. Displacement during lifts can get muscle engagement estimations based on modeling and research. Surface EMG is important to consider if you want absolute information, but legacy research should guide basic exercises and give some helpful information.\n\nThe three big needs—following directions, safe movement, and sharper calculation of work—are essential. Simple displacement opens the door to a world of possibilities for coaches, sports medicine practitioners, and athletes.\n\nBar Displacement in Action with Squatting\n\nThe need to do barbell squats is something many strength coaches will be interested in whether they do front, back, or split squats. To me, it’s about getting the priorities mastered and performed properly. For illustrative purposes, we will use barbell front and back squats. When coaches use depth in coaching bilateral squats, they want the COM (center of mass) to drop. Increasing the distance the pelvis travels usually makes a more positive contribution to general performance, all else being equal. Most coaches want to squat deeply, and athletes sometimes can’t do that without excessive lumbar flexion and risk to the hips. How can you assess the best range of motion? My suggestion is to use the assessment of Dr. Stuart McGill and add bar displacement metrics to monitor consistency.\n\nStep 1: Orthopedic Assessment\n\nSquatting depth is more than just length of the torso and leg anatomy. It’s a complex yet elegant way of expressing body movement and mobility. From a legal perspective, I prefer the integration of measurements from a PT or ATC with good training knowledge instead of doing the assessment myself. Medical professionals need to more involved with athlete health while training, not just for injuries. Screening is always a crapshoot, but if you want to load the dice a bit squat properly.\n\nUse video and measure the end ranges to see what type and depth of squatting pattern to use with the lower extremities. Understand that things change slightly with the addition of ground reaction forces and a barbell, so make sure you can convert that information to a weight-bearing squat pattern. Some neurological and motor skill changes occur, but we are looking for limits on joint patterns rather than coordinative limits.\n\nStrength coaches should include the following data sets in their AMS platform or spreadsheet. It takes 10 minutes per athlete, but, believe me, it pays off tenfold over years of training.\n\nPant inseam – The traditional measure of pant length\n\nFoot size – The standard foot measurement with or without socks\n\nFoot and tibia length – The length from below the kneecap and barefoot versus shod\n\nStanding width – The distance between medial ankle points when standing\n\nSquat width – The distance between medial ankle points when squatting\n\nFoot flare – How much external rotation in degrees one uses to squat\n\nThe FMS (Functional Movement Screen) has taken a beating lately, but let’s be clear about the value of using unloaded exercises you plan to load. For years, I have used the overhead squat. I use that motion in addition to the traditional front and back squats to help assess how athletes respond to exercise patterns. A baseball team doesn’t try to predict UCL injury in pitchers with a squat indirectly; they try to make sure their squats are better directly! I video the exercise from the side and back and score that data in degrees with Dartfish. Then I merge the medical data with the exercise information.\n\nThe result of all this is the safe range of motion athletes can do in a general squatting pattern (orthopedic) and what happens when they are on their feet with an exercise appraisal. In the past, I just watched carefully. But this information is instantly vertical. You get what you need to know immediately.\n\nStep 2: Exercise Setup\n\nIn the early 2000s, I attended the SWIS and EliteFTS conference and seminar for proper squatting procedures. Jim and Dave hurt my feelings each time but were patient and added considerably to my coaching knowledge. I was never a power lifter nor had experience with Olympic-style lifts in high school and college, so I was merely competent and safe. I wanted more. I learned the importance of setting up the exercise and doing the details of respecting the exercise at all loads. Most people might think Jim and Dave cared only about heavy loads, but they made sure the expectations were high on the warmup with just a light load as well.\n\nTheir motto was “Treat heavy weights like they are light, and light weights like they are heavy.” What is important is instilling a consistent, repeatable approach to doing the exercise no matter what the load. Why? Repeatability increases the safety of the exercise and offers a better environment to assess change. If an exercise modifies stance or bar placement, the data changes and so does its interpretation. If it weren’t for those two workshops in Toronto and Boston, my current data would be tainted.\n\nStep 3: Coaching assistance\n\nMerging the medical and teaching screening to loaded assessment is the third and hardest step to do as it adds to the rubber hitting the road of the athletes putting it together. Having them use the range of motion they are given genetically, applying the procedure of starting and ending the exercise faithfully, and repeating the pattern with load is the goal. Coaches must reinforce and guide their athletes in the little nuances of squatting or executing the exercise.\n\nCoaches want to see if athletes hit their motions via eyeballing the pattern and making sure it looks what is expected. Sometimes the movement may increase range, but a lot of coaching is ensuring what athletes can do is repeated over and over again.\n\nAthletes make three classic errors when they are loaded and squatting. These errors can occur anywhere and at any level.\n\nChange in lifting strategy – Looking for a better number (pounds on the bar), athletes change their technique to get a mechanical advantage. Coaches want better transfer of increased muscular work, not better numbers from changing the motion. Athletes need to remember that the goal of lifting is to improve performance, and lifting sports are about improving numbers.\n\nChange in torso position – Sometimes less-skilled athletes will bend more at the torso because they perceive they are moving their center of mass lower. But they are simply bowing. Bar-tracking technology can pick up a little discrepancy, but the lack of depth doesn’t provide the same stimulus.\n\nDecrease in range or change in speed – Sometimes athletes are afraid to get stuck in the hole or simply feel unsafe squatting deep when the load increases. They may fight the depth and shorten up the stroke or pop a little to cheat on technique. While work may be similar to a faster descent, athletes must show control. So I don’t like bouncing in general.\n\nThe goal of the coach is to ensure that change only occurs on the scale, not on the exercise. We want to increase weight without changing anything besides effort through the feet.\n\nStep 4: Long-term Analysis\n\nLong-term analysis on squatting depth and general displacement throughout the season is awesome. While I have used barbell squats as the example, it’s relevant to all exercises, not just one movement. As a fan of Tom Tellez, I use the word stroke to replace the barbell or exercise motion length or action. Here are a few examples from the community of coaches.\n\nRelationship between exercise weight and range performance\n\nSimple observation of one exercise and execution over time is a great lesson in strength training. Does the athlete do the same stroke over time, even when the weight increases? This is not just as simple as the distance of the stroke. Some athletes use depth as an advantage, such as bouncing off the chest in bench presses. A tiny and simple variable of motion distance and the context of the displacement is extremely valuable. Repetition tempo and sticking points based on distance are all very telling of what is happening\n\nRelationship between program phases and performance\n\nAnother area of interest is seeing how different phases of an exercise show ranges of motion. Some exercises are concentric influenced, like pulls and shallower versions of the Olympic lifts such as power cleans. It would be interesting to see how the sum of bar displacement during each phase of the general lifting program shows up in other areas. Obviously, this type of analysis requires more time, but I find that harmony over a season means contrasting training by balancing out the scores every week or even mesocycles. Sometimes the range of motion of exercises is interesting to see with injury patterns and eccentric strength.\n\nRelationship between anatomical factors and exercise modes\n\nThe value of seeing simple comparisons like right and left leg in reverse leg pressing or split squat asymmetries may provide evidence of bad habits or injury. Sometimes left and right asymmetries don’t lead to a finite conclusion, but knowing patterns over time do matter. Athletes may train for years, and all of the reps add up to great results. But sometimes they add up to problems if not carefully watched. One example is major differences in leg power with cross-sectional asymmetries.\n\nOver time, some athletes may create changes in mobility and specific strength from program design of exercises, so the taxonomy of different movements in the weight room matters. I suggest seeing how structural balance distributes the work properly and reduces pattern overload.\n\nPutting bar tracking to motion with displacement scoring\n\nMy goal here is to explain how those in the iron game can get more out of their data, not do more unnecessary analysis or statistical breakdown. With coaches having less margin for error, marginal gains only make sense when they show up with big improvements over time. The process of getting more from VBT products that can accurately measure barbell or motion displacement can start with a small step. As you become more comfortable each year, add more analysis to whatever you feel will help your athletes.\n\nSometimes doing the basics better matters, sometimes mining the data and finding little ways to get better results is the answer, and sometimes just making sure everyone is fairly evaluated with objective information is best. I am a huge fan of doing the tried and true activities sharper and more refined. Using tools that can remove the guesswork and passively collect information saves time. Over the last few years, I have learned a lot from trying to do a better job. I am confident you will enjoy more success in your program with the right information.\n\nPlease share so others may benefit.\n\nThe post Why Bar Displacement Is a Hidden Gem in the Weight Room appeared first on Freelap USA.\n\n↧\n\nWant to Be a Standout Private Coach? These Ten Tips Can Make It Happen\n\nBy Drew Cooper\n\nThe business of coaching in the private sector, especially as an independent individual (versus a facility with a staff) is interesting and complicated. I will discuss the path I took, including buying equipment, tailoring marketing to my business needs, making mistakes, and my hopes moving forward. I’ve added some shared stories of the fun, successes, failures, pains, and difficulties of doing a “great job” as a private coach. My aim is to help anyone thinking about starting their own journey to a private coaching career.\n\n*Disclaimer: You can’t buy experience\n\nMy Story and Path\n\nThings began with me wanting to pursue kinesiology in college, getting scared, changing majors, then coming full circle to change back and finish with a B.S. in kinesiology from San Diego State. In college I held a job in the café of a VERY affluent gym. The typical client was a millionaire working in some tech or biotech company (Qualcomm headquarters was a bike ride away).\n\nI was fortunate to meet my first mentor in Steve Laubenberg, a coach with experience working with speed/power athletes and loving what he did. Meeting Steve was the beginning of my networking efforts. I bought some training sessions with him, which started a great relationship that still exists. He opened a business out of his garage, and I followed him there. He directed me to websites, authors, and general training info to further my knowledge. I attribute much of my successful beginnings to Steve.\n\nWhen he notified me of his impending move across the country, I saw this as an opportunity to purchase his equipment. I took a huge risk as a college senior by draining my savings. I bought his GHR, dumbbells, weight plates, barbells, chest supported row, lat pulldown/low row, and various accessories at a price that was unreal, and moved everything into my parents’ garage. I soon acquired my first client. He generated four referrals within the first month. Without the cheaply priced equipment and that first client to get me started, I doubt I’d be where I am today.\n\nI started getting young athletes who happened to be exceptional at their given sports, which of course attracted their peers also to train with me. In about a year, I went from one client in a two-car garage to about 25 clients in a three-car garage. I also added new equipment after selling my old stuff. With word circulating that I had athletes being recruited by schools, two high school coaches called me. That resulted in talks to their respective parents in group meetings. One meeting led to a ton of referrals. The other was essentially a dead end since I couldn’t house the entire team at one time in my garage.\n\nAfter realizing the shortcomings of a small space, I started looking into larger options. My initial plan was developing an “actual” business. Prices in the area were terrifying, so I attended my first business seminar. It slammed home the point that opening a gym on my own was nothing I wanted to get into. By this point, I had met my now-wife. She was planning on attending PT school.\n\nChange of focus\n\nThis convinced me that opening a gym wasn’t a viable goal. I went back to the garage with a new focus: offering a more personalized, high-end, private experience to my clients while reducing the financial risk by keeping overhead to a minimum.\n\nI felt like all I needed to do was be the best possible coach with the tools to provide a high-quality experience. I wasn’t pursuing your typical person who pays $20 a month for a gym; I couldn’t compete with the big gyms in that respect. With a consistent group of clients, I started to upgrade everything from basic to high-end: adding turf out back, a bigger rack with a platform, competition bumper plates, Omegawave Team, GymAware, Globus, FreeLap timing, Oly bar, kBox3, and more. At the same time, I got rid of enough things to make the garage feel more open and a bit nicer. This process allowed me to provide a service that very few could match.\n\nWhile this updating continued, I did more networking and hired Landon Evans to coach my brother and me to compete in powerlifting. I joke about “networking” because I had nothing to offer Landon for his time other than money. As with Steve, working with Landon opened up a relationship that has benefited me tenfold. I bugged him endlessly about his programming, what he was reading, what seminars he was going to, what websites to read, equipment he liked and how he used it. I still bug him. I can’t emphasize enough hiring people you respect if you can so you can pick their brains—it beats out every seminar I have ever attended.\n\nTaking advantage of good fortune\n\nTo recap, I was fortunate to have met Steve, and I took advantage of the situation and bought his time to learn and form a relationship. That led to the start of my business. Steve was just the first of numerous instances of good fortune.\n\nI was fortunate that my parents let me start in their house as it was low overhead (read: zero at the start) and allowed me to charge low prices to get rolling.\n\nI was fortunate to have a great client at the beginning who referred more clients, and some talented athletes were within those referrals, and I took advantage and worked hard to provide good coaching that made them better and spurred, even more, referrals.\n\nI was fortunate to be in an affluent area where people could afford private coaching, and I took advantage and treated intelligent, wealthy people so well that they enjoyed coming in and I was always timely and professional.\n\nI was fortunate that Landon took us on as clients, and again I took advantage and learned everything I could and helped him in any way I could so our relationship was mutually beneficial and led to significant growth for me.\n\nI was fortunate to work with young athletes who went on to great things. Right now I have guys playing lacrosse at Duke, Navy, Air Force, Middlebury, Drexel, Whittier, Boston, and Bryant. I have had guys at UCSB and SDSU club lacrosse. Two guys in England play English Premier Academy soccer at FC Fulham and Nottingham Forest, and a third with the LA Galaxy Academy. Then there was the one who was cut from his lacrosse team and played sparingly for his high school football team. He walked on at TCU—one of the country’s top NCAA football teams. He was named Scout Player of the Year, and earned a starting spot on special teams.\n\nNone of this is to brag, but guys like this are one reason I have done well in my business. The fact that they excelled generated more client referrals. I can say they were (and still are) my most valuable marketing assets. Their hard work and talent have grown my business for me, and I couldn’t appreciate that more. It allows me to maintain my focus on my job—which is to help people improve and stay healthy—rather than generating referrals via website optimization. For that I am thankful.\n\nWith all of this being said, here are ten principles I have focused on throughout the years. They have served me very well. I recommend them to you.\n\nBe a Better Coach\n\nThis is one thing I can never get away from—even if you suck at business but still get positive results, you will probably be okay. This won’t assure you a financial fortune, but it should be the foundation of everything to follow.\n\nI’ll never forget my first business seminar. I was just 22, sitting in the room nodding along and learning a lot of great information I still use today, then going to lunch with a group of attendees to talk shop. The first thing I wrote in my notes after lunch was “get better at coaching because you suck right now.” I underlined it and still have it today. The group of coaches was all much older (I’d say the average age was about 40) and more experienced, so it was a real eye-opener that the business side they were just learning came after years of experience in the trenches getting better as coaches. In my previous articles, I make the point that you can’t buy your way into being better. You need to sit down and work at it over a long period. The take-home is that if you are a great knockdown coach, business will be better, and people will find you.\n\nBe a Decent Human Being\n\nIf you are going to charge people to spend time working with you (and hopefully learning), be a decent person. Don’t be condescending, egotistical, or belittling with less-than-gifted clients. Everyone starts somewhere. Either make their time enjoyable or decline to take them on. If you aren’t ready and willing to work with a middle-aged, less-than-motivated, fat-loss client, don’t do it. If you want to be in the world of performance, you need to be honest with clients, and yourself. Learn how to help, motivate, and encourage those who obviously need it. If you take on clients who get less than your best, they can potentially give you a bad reputation that can affect your ability to work with your ideal clients. Bottom line: Treat everyone like they matter. They do.\n\nDefine Yourself\n\nThis is something I am just learning and paying attention to a lot more with private sector coaches I respect. They tend to have a strong recurring message with what they write and say. For example, I like Mark McLaughlin and Carl Valle. They both are well-educated and have a platform to speak from (NOTE: The following is my personal take on their messages). When I read Mark’s stuff, I typically expect something along the lines of monitoring what you can take action on, taking a long-term approach to development, examining the shambles of youth development—to which he will offer examples and fixes.\n\nCarl seems to know the technology world better than most. My take-home from him typically boils down to\n\nShow me the data/proof before you hype some training method/technology\n\nDon’t get lost in the 1% when people are messing up the 90%\n\nUse technology to provide objective feedback (but don’t get lost in the hype).\n\nWhile they aren’t limited to these topics, they do come up often, and both of them frequently answer questions on these topics. Essentially they are filling our coaching gaps with specialized knowledge. My point is that if you make a particular topic your area of expertise, you become sought out. Rather than you looking for work, work may start looking for you. But this will take serious effort.\n\nI have failed in this respect by choosing to help everyone from 12-year-olds to 65-year-olds. So my mission now is to zone in on a topic and become better than anyone else. That is a little tongue-in-cheek, but hopefully you get my point. To drive it home, let’s list a few more coaches and play word association:\n\nLouie Simmons – Powerlifting/westside\n\nMike Tuchscherer – Powerlifting/autoregulation\n\nBryan Mann – VBT\n\nEric Cressey – Baseball/arm care\n\nI could continue, but the point is that most visibly successful coaches have an area of expertise, and branch out from there because people have learned to trust them.\n\nA Budget and setup\n\nIf you plan on opening an actual brick and mortar facility, you need to figure out your setup, potential client population, training system, and expenses. This is an interesting topic with more and more people doing work online and more technology coming out every day. I recently visited Scot Morrison, a great PT in the Portland, Oregon area. We discussed what we would do if we opened up today. We came to the same conclusion: having simple equipment with better technology to monitor the process. If you have a healthy athlete, a barbell, bumper plates, squat stands, bench, med ball, and boxes, you are probably good to go, so starting a small facility doesn’t have to be a huge financial burden equipment-wise. The interesting stuff now (depending on who you work with) is new technology like Omegawave, Ithlete, GymAware, Freelap timing, sleep trackers, InsideTracker, TMG, Myoton, 3D motion capture, and more. The list goes on and on, and you could easily spend a fortune.\n\nThe questions become who are you working with, how will you use the technology, can you afford it (knowing better stuff is on the way and for a lot cheaper), and will it improve what you are doing or the results you are getting? It is far too easy to play “keeping up with the Joneses” when the Joneses may suck, not use the stuff they buy, be in serious debt, have pockets far deeper than yours, or maybe even get things for free (if they are attached to the company in some way or testing the product). Again, buying things won’t make you better, so be sure you can justify your purchases and that they fit your business and budget. Don’t climb into crazy debt just to get cool stuff. Start basic and grow slow as the technology available now may be obsolete in five years, whereas a barbell and knowledge last forever.\n\nNew marketing/public relations\n\nMy brother-in-law recommended a great book by Fraser P. Seitel and John Doorley called Rethinking Reputation: How PR Trumps Marketing and Advertising in the New Media World. I’m also reading CEO Strength Coach by Ron McKeefery. It’s great though Ron’s journey and my own are VASTLY different. Rethinking Reputation instills the idea of new media and public relations being cheap ways to spread the word about yourself or better yet have other people speaking positively about you. For us individual business owners/operators who can’t afford marketing campaigns, things like social media are wildly important. You’d be amazed at the amount of business driven through my garage based on athletes I have tagged squatting on Facebook. It can spread like wildfire since it shows up on their pages, leads to questions, and I get a phone call.\n\nBut in all honesty, I went to a couple of high schools to talk a while back. Other than that my entire business has been word of mouth. If I go out and tell you I’m good, you may scoff. If one of your friends tells you I’m good, you tend to believe it. This brings us back to being good at what you do and being a decent human. Otherwise, those leads disappear very fast and turn into people badmouthing you, which can kill business. So use social media to your advantage—not to brag to other coaches, but to complement existing clients and potentially drive their social world to ask about what you do as a coach. Remember, you want happy clients talking about you to their friends. I’ve found it to be the best way to build trust in new clients.\n\nWhat is important to you? How do you define success?\n\nAnother story from the business seminar I attended years ago was the realization of what “owning a gym” actually entailed. There are a ton of new responsibilities, headaches, and expenses that come with the opening of a true facility. I wanted to coach more than own a gym. You need to decide for yourself what “success” is. Do you want to coach elite athletes? Make a mid-six- figure income? Be known nationally as a speaker and expert in a topic? Or some combination of those? Because I define success as being a great coach, having financial security but maybe not the biggest income, freedom to study and spend time with family, and the ability to work from home doesn’t make that definition right for you.\n\nI find it important to have a purpose behind your work. Otherwise, you end up floating around and frustrated because things aren’t what you expected even though you never defined those expectations in the first place. To go back to the seminar, I learned several things:\n\nI want to be in the trenches\n\nI like learning more about training and performance\n\nI want to hold conversations with great coaches\n\nI want my clients to get better results with me than anywhere else\n\nSometimes I think I’m driven by the fear of not being a very good coach, so I end up investing more time to learn more. But I don’t get that same feeling from being a “business owner” (however, you can’t neglect this, as you’ll see in #10). I don’t get excited about thinking of marketing strategies, insurance payments, expansion, or hiring new people. To be quite honest that sounds awful TO ME but it may sound good to you, so figure that out. This process of figuring out what is important to you will help dictate decisions moving through your career and may change with time (it most likely will) but don’t put it off.\n\nBe a professional\n\nThis piggybacks with point #2 of Being a Decent Human Being in that you need to treat people in a professional manner whenever money is being exchanged. This is a bigger deal than you would think. If you stay small and private as I have, you begin to forge relationships to the point that your “clients” become more like friends. This never gives you the right to show up late, eat on the job, dress inappropriately, or use language that would bother your grandma. If someone is paying you for a service, always deliver that service in a professional manner. I have often paid for coaching and PT. The one thing that immediately pisses me off is someone walking around eating, not taking notes, not testing/retesting, or anything else along those lines. So show up early, dress appropriately, eat during your breaks, and be present because clients notice these things and it goes a long ways toward keeping them satisfied—and coming back.\n\nPedal to the metal! Always!\n\nThis is one of the most painful lessons I have learned. It is FAR too easy to take your foot off the gas when things are going well. You’re busy, people are happy, checks are coming in, and you get comfortable. The problem with getting comfortable is that kids have a season for their sport, adults go on vacation, school gets busy, people move, athletes graduate and move away, etc. So don’t stop trying to spread the word. There were times I told kids not to tell anyone about me because I was “too busy,” only to have lacrosse season hit and my schedule get cut in half. Now guys are off in college, referrals slow down, business is tougher, and I have to go back out to talk to coaches at the high schools to offer my thoughts and try a drive a new crop of athletes through my doors.\n\nIf I had just continued pushing the word out, I wouldn’t have to be out talking again. I’d be in the garage doing what I love. If you’re not growing, or people don’t hear about you, at some point business will slow down. If you get so busy you can’t handle it, keep pushing and raise your fees, offer different options like online coaching, or start doing large group conditioning work to continue to stay in touch with the newer, younger athletes to prevent all your athletes from picking up and graduating at the same time.\n\nOpen doors and don’t burn bridges\n\nIf I were to go back to my college self, I’d try to convince myself to go further in school and get a Masters, Ph.D., or DPT degree. That would result in more opportunities beyond training people in a gym. Higher education opens the door to teaching at the university level or gaining specific knowledge in a field where you can possibly consult/work for a tech company like Omegawave or Catapult. The DPT route allows you to accept insurance, teach, or have a salaried job higher than a personal trainer. Typically potential clients trust you more.\n\nDo you need higher education? Absolutely not. We can all point to a ton of examples of successful people with just an undergrad degree. On the whole, however, higher education opens more doors. Then it’s up to you to take advantage and monetize the opportunity.\n\nWhen I say don’t burn bridges, I mean that every relationship you build is a source of potential referrals and further business. If you have problems with someone, try to end on good terms even if that means swallowing your pride a little. In the long run, it will typically be in your best interest to have happy clients, past or current.\n\nOnce you decide to be a private coach, you become a businessperson\n\nOne thing I hear all the time is “I don’t want to worry about the business side, I just want to coach.” There is nothing wrong with that; just don’t go into business for yourself unless you are already established, have a following, and are a great coach. If you plan on starting out fresh with no real experience, you better learn how to network, sell, market, and “do business,” otherwise you will get crushed. There are tons of examples of great coaches failing and awful coaches thriving in our industry (as well as others). Typically it comes down to smart business decisions, a good demeanor or personality, and the ability to sell without sounding like a salesman.\n\nThink of it this way: If you are good at what you do, and you want to help people, it’s only right to sell so people don’t end up getting hurt down the street at some abomination of a program. I think it’s a good gut check to ask yourself that if you truly are as good as you think, why aren’t people knocking on your door? I ask myself that sometimes and it usually comes down to the fact that I haven’t done a good enough job keeping the pedal down and reaching out to more people. Business isn’t easy, and none of your competitors are out to help you. At some point you have to put the stubbornness aside and be a business person, or find a job as a coach and work as an employee.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nWhen all is said and done, being a private coach is far more than writing a good program. As important as being a great coach is, it is more important upfront to be a fantastic salesperson and a genuinely nice person. When I say “salesperson,” I mean a combination of communicator, educator, and actual seller. It is important in our field—rife with utter bullshit spewed out of every media outlet, infomercial, supplement ad, TV show, and layperson—that we know how to communicate concrete science efficiently and effectively so that we can foster trust in our abilities.\n\nTo tell someone that carbs aren’t the devil, sleep is important, heavy weights won’t make you bulky and slow, or whatever other misinformation you come across in the world of exercise is a matter of educating. The word “selling” refers to the delivery, not the material. You are educating in a non-threatening, easy-to-understand—maybe even humorous—way. Building trust with strangers can be rather difficult so don’t lecture and call people names. Most likely the “idiots on TV” already have the person’s trust so calling them names won’t help.\n\nLast, this business isn’t as unique as we like to think and make it out to be. Like any business or industry, some people suck, some are okay, and others excel. If you truly want to excel as a coach and business owner, it takes time and effort. It’s not always rainbows and unicorns, and even your ideal clients will drive you nuts at times. My recommendation is to become a flat-out knockdown coach, be willing to take a calculated risk on yourself, and don’t feel like guys like me have everything figured out because I’m writing an article. I make mistakes and get frustrated with myself constantly and question whether or not I should continue working on my own, so we are all human.\n\n*A final note. Before I completed this article, my wife and I moved to Northern California and left my business to my brother in San Diego. We have had serious talks about what I’m going to do now. Is it worth the risk to build a new gym and business here? Should I go back to school? Maybe even a complete change of business? At the end of the day, I don’t think there is anything else I’d rather do; however, that choice does not come easy. I question the risk versus passion. Just because I love the field and really can’t see doing anything else with as much drive, the risk can be so high working alone that sometimes plain old security sounds like a fairytale dream. All in all, after 7+ years of working alone in a field I love, I don’t think there is anything else I could do. I have knots in my stomach but look forward to what comes next.\n\nPlease share so others may benefit.\n\nThe post Want to Be a Standout Private Coach? These Ten Tips Can Make It Happen appeared first on Freelap USA.\n\n↧\n\nThe Science of Force Plates and Pressure Mapping\n\nBy Carl Valle\n\nIf you follow the latest innovations in sports performance, you have seen the use of force plates moving from the research world to professional teams and colleges. Some private facilities tout them as ways to decode what causes injuries and what holds the key to improved performance. The use of pressure mapping to solve complex foot and lower extremity injuries among elite soccer clubs is even more intriguing. I have used specialists who leverage the technology to add more insight to their craft since 2001, and seen how the research and clinical experience can really make a difference. On the other hand, a lot of bogus claims keep us stuck in the mud as a profession.\n\nSeveral times a week I muster the same long email responses to many myths of using a force plate with strength coaches, and the problem is trending now. Several providers of force plate systems and services are growing in popularity—Sparta Science, P3, Andy Franklin Miller, and more. Accelerometer-based products like Bar Sensei and Push have made efforts (some successful, some still needing evolution) to capture force production in the weight room. The Australian system GymAware provided a solid proxy to force output for years, and coaches love getting instant feedback with elite athletes.\n\nEveryone can learn from the science of Newtonian physics to help their athletes.\n\nClick To Tweet\n\nFinally, we have the surge in pressure mapping tools that improve cleat or boot fit, as well as adding another perspective to gait analysis. Tekscan, Novel, and Moticon systems are solving problems for sports medicine professionals as gait analysis is growing and becoming more practical. Coaches and sports medicine professionals are realizing that instead of using research to validate general concepts, it’s better to research their own athletes with the same instruments they are reading about in the literature. This is a great idea on paper, but when the rubber hits the road, it can be a very dangerous course.\n\nThis article will straighten out what is going on with force-time curves in sports motion, specifically with the common approaches of using force plates for jumping and pressure mapping for screening foot strike. Not everyone will be investing into $20K systems, but everyone can learn from the science of Newtonian physics to help their athletes.\n\nBeware of Geeks and Greeks Bearing Gifts\n\nSeveral professional teams have asked me what the best force plates are. Others wonder if pressure mapping will be the next big thing and worth the investment. My response has and will always be the same: Never purchase anything unless you can interpret the information the instruments measure.\n\nA force plate is a simple tool that records the body mass and muscular output changes into the platform surface over time.\n\nThat is all. Interpretation should not be more than how forces are created and transferred in that sporting movement. Extending out to diagnose specific injury or fatigue risks is getting into crystal ball country, not predictive analytics. A vertical jump is a useful action to peer into the nervous system, but biomechanically how jumping with two legs up translates to sprinting on a grass field or changing direction in basketball is limited. The use of force plates in professional baseball perplexes me. It may be great to see how leg power is modulating, but expecting it to help keep pitchers healthy is a pipe dream.\n\nMy concern is that professional sports teams are extending the value and significance of the force-time curves beyond what the science is telling us. This is not just voodoo or wishful thinking;, it’s closer to snake oil. Jumping vertically has some value to coaches and even sports medicine professionals, but to distill injury risk to a vertical jump profile is analogous to diagnosing disease based only on a stethoscope.\n\nIf force plates could solve our injury problems, it seems that many teams are either not using them or failing to take advantage of the data. Injuries are still piling up. Remember that the technology is older than the players currently in professional sport, so if it were a Holy Grail, we would have found it when everyone was rocking cassette players and watching The A-Team.\n\nMoving to another solution that captures force-time curves, the use of pressure mapping devices is going to get more popular now that the technology is more user-friendly. Pressure mapping is basically using an insole of sensors to see all the changes in vertical forces that interact with the foot. While not a force plate inside a shoe, the data does have validity to see relative force. But the absolute forces are not perfect.\n\nThe technology is designed to measure how each foot strike distributes its respective forces through the ground at a high sampling rate—how many times the device is measuring per second. Some devices collect data like a high-speed camera. Amazing stuff, but like any tool it requires a lot of education to do more than show cute charts to sportswriters looking for a good story on “data” or “science.”\n\nLooking at the data, medical professionals can solve for abnormal issues and make better decisions on footwear, orthotic interventions, therapy, and rest. All this technology is currently being used in research. The objective measurements can be used to help professional teams get better and define problems with more resolution. The promise of reducing injuries and improving performance sounds great on paper, but let the buyer beware. Many hardware systems eager to get sales are matching up with thought leaders to sell more of their products. You need to know who is providing genuine education and who is just marketing dubious science.\n\nWhat Force Plates Actually Measure\n\nA medical-grade force plate and the right software can dramatically reveal important changes to athlete function if used correctly. Three variables are clearly needed. Any break in the chain will make a force plate a very expensive toy for organizations, who will realize it is collecting dust when a new performance staff brings in the flavor of the month as the coaching regime changes.\n\nForce plates are simply a few square meters of measuring ground reaction forces. They are mainly useful for vertical jumping and sometimes sampling a running step if integrated into a high-speed treadmill, but they are just one shade of the necessary colors in a pallet of data to create a complete picture. Remember that force plates can provide only the following:\n\nThe amount of force one can transfer into the ground over time.\n\nThis summary is basically the limit of direct information a device like a force plate can provide. Not to oversimplify, but force plates are not much different than weight scales sampling at fast speeds. Sure, calculations and sometimes estimations of other metrics like peak power, mean force, and other scores can be acquired when the time segments of the force-time curve are dissected, but some pundits are extrapolating a lot from one set of numbers. The body is a complicated orchestration of many movements and joints. One gross time curve isn’t the same as adding video or motion capture, so don’t “jump to conclusions” with a line plot on a flat screen in a gym.\n\nSince most of the time people are extracting force profiles from bilateral vertical jumps using a single force plate, the information is junk when they don’t know if one limb is experiencing a poor neuromuscular performance. It’s truly amazing that many teams spend more than $50K on one force plate and repackaged software, when even a dual force plate system still needs video or motion capture to see the relationships of forces and motion of the body. Add EMG and now you are getting close to the whole picture. But keep in mind that research data is not team-friendly, so compromises are often made to do repeated measurements. Also, keep in mind that a research study may take a year or more to be studied and published—much different than the need for instant guidance.\n\nThe common and appropriate use of force plates is an attempt to gauge how power from training and subsequent rest interacts with individual athletes with primarily jump testing in the vertical plane. Bilateral jumping does indeed have some relationship to gross leg power in many sports, a prime variable to reducing injury and increasing performance. General leg power is not the golden ticket to running fast or reducing the dreaded ACL injury. It’s one part of the equation that is appropriate to test if properly sampled and interpreted. The problem now is it’s a wild west of unproven collection techniques, poorly executed analysis, and diluted reporting with cartoony graphs that would make the best sports scientists vomit. Yes, it’s that bad. But it’s like Santa Claus—everyone wants to believe because he brings toys every year.\n\nWhat pressure mapping can provide for sports professionals\n\nPressure mapping can come in different forms. Sometimes it’s a walking mat or strip of carpet-like sensors, sometimes it’s a completely wireless thin insole. Think of an LCD screen with tiny pixels, with each pixel detecting various levels of pressure. The primary use of pressure mapping is ensuring the gait curve (force-time curve specific to locomotion) is in harmony with the anatomy of the subject it’s testing. Most of the time the data is used in podiatry, attempting to improve outcomes with such unfortunately common problems like diabetic foot ulcers. It’s growing with sports medicine as a testing service because research is discovering how the foot and lower extremity better interact with the ground and shoe better.\n\nNot only does pressure mapping summarize force-time curves, but it can also capture the Center of Pressure (COP). While not a perfect definition, the COP is averaging the forces between the length and width of the foot every fraction of a second. The image below is a good illustration. Note the black line showing the summary of the distribution of forces through the sole of the foot, in addition to the peak forces with corresponding color codes.\n\nThe technology of pressure mapping is amazing and very useful, but clinical and research findings can evoke strong disagreement regarding the implications of the data. Ask a researcher what the findings of pressure mapping are. Usually, the response is “limited.” Ask a clinician, and the responses can range from “it depends” to “a staple in addressing problems.” The truth is that pressure mapping is medical imaging with motion. One needs the entire picture to make improvements, or the results may not surface.\n\nMy biggest criticism of research that analyzes forces and joint motion with pressure mapping is the poor study design construction. Getting 20 test subjects statistically summarized with crude foot evaluation approaches is antiquated, and not informative at all. Each foot is similar to a moving 3D fingerprint, rich in detail and individualism. While each subject may have similar data in the findings at the end of the investigation, how they get there is highly variable and often not included in the researcher’s conclusions. For example, some feet look anatomically different yet perform similarly, while others that look nearly the same may perform far differently. Taking the body’s most complicated joint system and summarizing it with rough labels such as “flat foot” or “high arch” is like using Starbucks sizing for a wedding dress fitting.\n\nOrthotics has a polarizing reputation—sometimes getting too much credit, sometimes being attacked for doing “nothing” for athletes. Like prescription medication, orthotic treatments treat a problem that needs a lot of patient information to help. In the past, blood transfusions had a huge failure rate because many donors didn’t match blood type, so the body rejected even “healthy” blood. When athletes experience injuries, most of the problem is managing the training load and preparing the body properly. But some variables can’t be fixed with better strength training and training plans.\n\nOrthotics are static devices and can address some problems, but they can’t fix everything. We have a myriad of coaches inspecting shoes and trying to match the right ones with their athletes. A shoe is an artificial addition to the foot, so those who want a natural orthotic-free fit often use a running shoe or cleat that unknowingly changes how the athlete interacts with the playing surface.\n\nThe goal of pressure mapping is to reduce aberrant forces that demonstrate direct pathological effects. Most of the impact of orthotics is minimal. But so is the difference in the modern NBA between winning and losing, and getting hurt and staying healthy. The fine line of what can injure an athlete pushing the body maximally can’t be summarized with conventional statistics, so modeling biological tissue and repair rates is what we need more of, not convenient statistical software packages that work for voter polls and crime figures of cities.\n\nPressure mapping is nothing more than an objective way to enhance what a good foot evaluation and gait analysis are already doing. It’s valuable to see direct problems with the foot, and indirect problems with the lower extremity and higher up. The pelvis and its function have a small influence as the body is interconnected, but it’s not as strong as many want to believe.\n\nMany therapists feel threatened by podiatry as they don’t have the same education or even medical ability to influence what is happening below the knee. Like a psychologist who can’t prescribe medications like a psychiatrist, therapists should focus on what they are more qualified to handle and use a combined approach. Core training is an obsession, and if it were solving the world’s problems, we would have been saved from since the stability ball invasion of the late 1990s. Core training has been around since the dawn of time, and it’s not working as well as we want. So it’s about seeing every part of the kinetic chain that interacts with the ground.\n\nHardware, software, and marketing games\n\nMost systems that elite teams and universities buy are usually bundled together, meaning if you purchase a piece of equipment you usually use the company’s software as well. As a user of sports technology for years, I know that what’s included can vary from amazing solutions to vomit from lazy software engineers who have no pride in their work. Many companies try to sell “added value” systems by tweaking existing software to make it appear more advanced or special. Usually, though, it’s nothing more than a logo swap and a few features.\n\nWARNING: The biggest pitfall in sports performance technology is ignorance of what the hardware can do and how the software spits out information. Some companies are truly innovating and pushing faster than research as equipment and data are surging in availability, but anything proprietary is still likely to marketing hype. The best solution is to send the marketing claims to sport scientists who spend 100% of their time looking at the same data and see if any merit exists. Most of the time it’s like a new supplement—lots of promise but little actual effect or scientific proof.\n\nA great solution is software that displays data clearly and doesn’t try to do too much. Coaches need transparency, not filtered glitter data. When one is estimating on estimations, calculations become random number generators. Coaches need to understand the difference between a direct measurement and a calculation. I roll my eyes when sales staffs use the magic word “algorithm,” thinking it’s a discovery rather than a formula that estimates what is happening with advanced mathematics.\n\nSolutions with force plates and pressure mapping\n\nMany professionals interested in buying instruments feel the pressure (pun intended) from management, peers, and athletic directors. Sometimes athletes will ask as well when social media and the YouTube world hype force plates or show Cristiano Ronaldo getting fitted for cleats. We are seeing elite athletes getting 3D printed orthotics now. The technology will soon be available everywhere, not just with pros. My concern is that people forgetare forgetting the simple and big perspective. I frankly hate listing or summarizing, but the two tools I’ve discussed mainly take care of three primary needs.\n\nForce plates are great for jumping and getting power profiles with a lot of granularity in force production. Contractile dynamics of the neuromuscular system can be dissected a bit, but the conclusions are very general, and specifics to other motions are limited.\n\nPressure mapping is great for screening injury and performance in conjunction with gait analysis. Decisions based on foot function and the relationship up the kinetic chain can be deciphered with a holistic approach and other data feeds.\n\nBoth pressure mapping and force plates can help athletes return to play by analyzing rehabilitation progress.\n\nBoth tools help athletes, but to create training programs in the weight room from a force plate is asinine. Using pressure mapping without a comprehensive clinical foot evaluation by a professional is also foolish. In summary, force plates help show how the strength program is doing and maybe how some fatigue is interacting. But the reality is it’s not to develop athletic performance, just likely lower body power and balance. Pressure mapping is designed to fine-tune foot/ankle function and footwear, not diagnose injury alone.\n\nSolution 1: Performance changes and testing\n\nMost coaches try to observe development with their athletes. Elite athletes have reached a high level of success in their sport, but are not finished products. Due to the constraints of travel and team game schedules, athletes compete underprepared because everyone allows it, including the players themselves. Let’s face it—most fans come to preseason training because they want to see some action. Nobody is going to pay big-ticket prices to see teams do small-sided games and half-court scrimmages. The goal of professional and college athletes is to ensure that biological, chronological, and training ages are equal. Instead of listing three bar charts from a vertical jump, it’s better to test multiple exercises and sport movements and just look at the force-time curve in detail.\n\nSolution 2: Medical screening versus medical diagnostics\n\nModern medicine usually identifies structural damage to anatomical points of interest as a diagnosis, provided it is coupled with clinical findings that match the imaging. Medical imaging isn’t going away soon, but functional outcomes in foot mechanics are growing in value. What is confusing is the difference between modern athlete screening and medical diagnosis, when many methods overlap and are similar. Here is the core summary:\n\nScreening – Athlete risk can be appraised when the etiology of common non-contact injuries is compared to evidence-based practices. Screening is done before one is injured to identify risk factors that can increase the likelihood of neuromuscular faults to joint and soft tissue.\n\nDiagnosis – Pathomechanics in conjunction with athlete clinical findings can enhance the confidence in the mechanism or severity. The main purpose of using pressure mapping and force plates with injuries is to restore the athlete to baseline or construct an intervention and return to play program.\n\nPressure mapping and force plate analysis can help with injury screening and diagnosis, but the literature is exhausting and must be combed over. Currently, no software magically creates a diagnosis or screens injuries without expertise, but the calculations can be interpreted with mild education.\n\nSolution 3: Jumping, throwing, and running analysis\n\nTeams, academies, and colleges measure common movements in sport and try to see what motions and forces increase injury risk. As mentioned earlier, a lot of variation between athlete populations and genetics that may make up much of the data are not specific enough to explain everything. Very few marathon runners tear ACLs unless they step funny, very few athletes pull hamstrings jumping up, and very few pitchers tear Achilles tendons on the mound. In general, based on the rates, injury type, and population, the sports world is trying to do the following with force plates and pressure mapping:\n\nCreate a sensible symmetry to increase the probability of performing well and reducing injury. As speeds and forces increase, so does injury risk. Some asymmetry is normal, but the body has only so many resources to manage forces that are not in harmony.\n\nIdentify researched factors known to be etiological points of risk for injuries. Some cardinal variables to injuries are valid, and simple things like landing can be assessed with force plates in addition to video.\n\nControl and manage forces in combination with the athlete’s shoes or cleats to ensure comfort and appropriate levels of function. Ski boots and skates are much different than track spikes and football cleats, so one is trying to ensure that no factor is causing damage or increasing the indirect risk of injury.\n\nThrowing athletes should use force plates to manage ground reaction responses by measuring their throws. Runners and sprinters can use treadmills or measure foot strike by sampling a few steps. Jumpers have perhaps the easiest and most direct option—simply testing their sporting style. Testing what people do isn’t rocket science and is not novel, but using jumping for every sport is too narrow and not valid for deducing specific risk or dissecting impairment.\n\nParting wisdom on measuring forces from the feet up\n\nIt can be nerve-racking when unfamiliar technology that holds a possible promise of improved sports performance appears. Don’t worry. Remember that jump testing, cutting, and running are all areas that coaches can help improve, and sports medicine professionals can screen and rehabilitate. Measurements help add more precision to what we see, and the goal of the technology is to assist professionals, not replace them.\n\nSome amazing athletic feats happen because great talents do a lot of special things quickly and forcefully into the ground, and that data can be collected and reported instantly. Now and in the future it’s expected that the simple line plot of forces can be measured and improved when good technology meets great people, and education can pave the way.\n\nPlease share so others may benefit.\n\nThe post The Science of Force Plates and Pressure Mapping appeared first on Freelap USA.\n\n↧\n\nHow to Use the kMeter to Develop Eccentric Power\n\nBy Carl Valle\n\nThe kMeter is a simple sensor that estimates work done with the kBox flywheel system. Many coaches ask me about how I use it. The honest truth is that I see what everyone else is doing, and cut out what may be just style or preference. Coaches and sports medicine people need to understand that it’s the best available tool for users to get unique estimations of work done without using force plates. Obviously with any training tool, you always need measurement to improve results or the consistency of results decreases. This article is specialized for users of kBox, but anyone wanting to learn how to improve performance will benefit by seeing what most sports need with strength development.\n\nWhat is the kMeter and what does it do?\n\nI was the first person in North America to get the kMeter. My first question was what does it do. The second was what should I be aware of with regards to what it doesn’t do. The kMeter is a relay sensor that sends data from the flywheel to an Apple device via Bluetooth. To appreciate the major convenience and value this solution provides, understand that entire companies do the very thing we likely take for granted when looking at our iPads or iPhones. The flywheel data is raw information, and the software converts it into usable scores. This information is all near real-time, and I wrote about biofeedback in another article. The scores are basically details of the work done per repetition of the kBox. Much of the innovation is making hard calculations instant.\n\nThe Exxentric kMeter converts raw flywheel data into usable scores in real time.\n\nClick To Tweet\n\nThe kMeter is not a force plate, and the data comes from the flywheel, not the kBox surface. I bring this up because sports professionals must appreciate the refinement of the mathematics, not hardware or app design.\n\nI spent six months validating the data I was capturing from the kMeter. I needed to know if the numbers were real. After thousands of reps, I am content that it is. To understand this commitment, think about spending ten hours a week making sure estimates from the sensor are enough to show strong evidence of the outputs during training. The sensor is not designed to do anything besides estimate work from the machine, but just having data from a very difficult to measure force is extremely valuable to coaches and medical professionals. Measurement is especially important now in sport, and the most exotic forms of resistance are more manageable.\n\nWhat the technology is doing and what the software is calculating\n\nThe flywheel momentum is received and then sent to the app for calculation and data visualization. Several metrics are listed, and most coaches want to know what is on the bar charts, so let’s review what the inputs are manually and what is being calculated in the back end of the software.\n\nAverage power – Mean power output of the repetition is expressed in wattage.\n\nConcentric peak power – The top wattage during the concentric action of the repetition is expressed in watts as well.\n\nEccentric peak power – The top wattage during the eccentric action of the repetition is expressed in watts, like the concentric portion.\n\nAverage overload – The average overload is the difference between concentric and eccentric actions. This can be net zero or a positive/negative percentage.\n\nRelative peak power – Based on self-reported input, the relationship between the user weight and the peak power output of the exercise is expressed in watts/kg.\n\nEnergy – The conversion of work done is expressed into kilojoules, a less conventional but appropriate summary.\n\nRepetitions – The number of repetitions performed. Remember, you can select different pre-reps based on how athletes get the flywheel going.\n\nAverage rep time – The mean duration of concentric and eccentric activity, without adjustments to distance. Rep time should be compared to vertical motion, a great composite metric I predict will soon gain interest with coaches.\n\nVertical motion – How much displacement vertically the user is creating, expressed in centimeters. The distance looks very good when compared to LPTs and video, so it’s a good idea to use this for depth of motions to audit exercise technique.\n\nMore information like actual rep-by-rep details is shown live during the exercises so that you can toggle between average power, peak power, and peak force. A line of statistical averages is shown when the work is compiled. Clearly, a lot of information can be collected rapidly. The goal should be to do the exercises correctly with great effort, and start using the information over time to make live coaching interventions instead of robotic responses to screen data.\n\nHow does one coach with the kMeter?\n\nThe most common question I get about the kMeter and kBox is how do I coach with the live feedback? Most people believe I will talk about “personalized thresholds” or “eccentric ratios.” But the truth is that I care about the quality of the workout. I want engaged athletes focusing on the task, not about numbers or anything else until the session is over or they need to know how they are doing after completing a set. I have only been using the kMeter for a short period of time, so I don’t have the perfect system.\n\nMy Velocity Based Training articles have stressed the need for objective feedback, and it must be done carefully. When athletes do heavy snatches from blocks, their feedback is completion of a quality rep, not seeing how many watts they got or the bar velocity. The job of the coach and fellow athletes is to support with old-school fervor, getting rowdy or being supportive. I want laser focus and athletes can always get the data seconds later if they need to. Remember, at most stations athletes are usually changing weight plates. Because of the nature of the kBox, instant feedback is more accessible. The resistance is the body and flywheel, not a plate with a unique load. A kBox environment is a harness or bar attachment, something with fewer moving parts besides the machine itself.\n\nThe most common approach with small groups is the coach using the kMeter just for arousal and awareness. Individual athletes can get more out of it because they are not sharing the device and can interact with the app more. The kMeter works like a charm in sports medicine and private training. The UX (user experience) is getting better to be more team-friendly. I am comfortable with small groups of 3-5 athletes, and I believe the enterprise option will be even faster and more simplified in the next year based on how things are trending.\n\nSo what does a kBox session with live kMeter output feel like? An organized riot! The process needs to be hands-on and collaborative with everyone supporting the eccentric rush and encouraging self-punishment with a solid push through to get the “taste of one’s own medicine” back. When I used this with my friend Jason during last winter, it reminded me of Mad Max 3 and everyone loved it.\n\nCoaches are going to want to use an Apple TV and a cheap flatscreen hooked up to get the mobile device projected. With the iPad mini being cheaper than regular Apple tablets, I use it and a good case and treat it like a large remote rather than a small screen. Keep in mind the audio component on rep feedback from the app uses a voice to help count. My only wish is that more sound options exist like custom recordings. I don’t know who I would use, but I bet Scotty Cochrane could easily increase the output by a statistical level.\n\nExporting data for later use\n\nMy first fear was that feedback was live but couldn’t be exported. The current app allows for email export similar to many early apps, and that is a necessary feature. What one needs to remember is that the file exported is a CSV (comma separated values) file. While Excel can open it, the file is not an Excel file. Many statistical packages require formatting to be adjusted based on the layout of the data, so I suggest using a script or macro to automate the process for both time and error reduction.\n\nDown the road, I would like to see Dropbox and other cloud-synching options as well as an API that can pipe the data right into AMS products, so data doesn’t have to be manually cleaned and sent. All of this will come in time as more and more kBox users evolve the art and science of flywheel training.\n\nWhat to analyze for athlete progress\n\nMost coaches are going to want what nearly everyone wants: MORE. Progress is not seeing gradual improvement or similar oversimplifications; it’s about making smart decisions of knowing when to push and when to let go. Eccentric training is the necessary demand for playing with fire and making sure one is unscathed. The difficulty is not training with the kBox in isolation; it’s knowing how it can play nice with other modalities. What I have experienced to be simple and successful is looking at the amount of total work done in the training program and see how much flywheel contribution is involved. From there I want to see if the flywheel is augmenting important metrics to the program.\n\nFor the first few months, coaches want to see if the added or integrated work is helping performance. This of course is hard to do without controlled trials in research, but good recordkeeping can hint to what is influencing what.\n\nFlywheel training must improve flywheel measurements. What this means is the simple and direct change with exercises needs to get better for the training to have a chance in other areas outside the exercise.\n\nThe eccentric utilization ratio must show a minimum worthwhile change. From my own records, heavy kBox use with soccer can increase the ratio by .15. But the total numbers all improve, thus, the small increase may be deceptive.\n\nExternal testing with sonography (fascicle length) and basic strength tests can measure the eccentric adaptations. Also looking at muscle changes in size via modern perimeter tools is important for knowing what is targeted. EMG can be done as well, and interpretation is best done by a sport scientist or knowledgeable professional.\n\nDeeper analysis for advanced athletes and the future\n\nI have less than a year of kMeter usage, so I want this article to reflect standard practices that anyone else could come to from loyal use. The future will be similar to Velocity Based Training, and it’s going to have many of the concepts of kinetic analysis from force plates. Deeper analysis can be done by using the exported data and seeing relationships with the flywheel training internally, and the connections outside the modality and into pure athletic motion. I have three predictions of what will be coming down the pipeline with the kMeter with analytics of eccentric training.\n\nThe current app only tags exercises. This is a self-reporting label of the outputs relative to the movement pattern and even self-reported flywheel load. Just like every VBT product, weights are inputted by the user, so expect exercise corrections for anatomical impact. One example is the squat-to-RDL pattern I love. What is going to be important are the three outputs (average power, peak power, peak force) and what they mean to hamstring adaptations. Technology does not make coaches an endangered species. They become even more important to ensure athletes do what they are supposed to do.\n\nConcentric peak power and eccentric peak power ratios are not a Holy Grail, but neither are they a throwaway Dixie cup. To know the work being done with more granularity, more research is needed to see how dissipation of forces from joint angles with force-time characteristics are interrelated. The flywheel overload is a misnomer since thermodynamics and machine efficiency impact the eccentric load. The truth is that kinetic forces redirected from the flywheel are not higher than the incoming concentric force, but how they are received is what coaches want. As this becomes a more important metric, expect refinements in the kBox when the science starts to catch up to the innovation.\n\nThe kBox is portable and durable, but things are going to get even more brutal as the community constantly experiments with it. Already we are seeing some great stuff by American coaches who have had less exposure, so what was possibly a weakness in accessibility is now a strength from something being new and exciting. I predict a huge ecosystem of support products and education as the system becomes more consumer friendly.\n\nThe power of the crowd\n\nThis article is just a review and exposes the surface of the kMeter, an important instrument that helps quantify the hard-to-measure outputs of the kBox. I am a believer in this technology and have sometimes been too skeptical of machines as I am a purist in training (gravity and motion). Now that I have done my homework with research and actual experimentation, I no longer feel as closed-minded.\n\nIf it weren’t for several Spanish coaches and my friend and mentor Hakan Andersson, I would be stuck thinking the option was for “Euros,” not somebody more hardcore. The kMeter is a user-friendly tool that kills off the antiquated laptop and makes data more accessible and useful, and I am confident the future will be brighter. I am not the thought leader in flywheel training. That is the crowd of great people who share their experiences and expertise openly. As the community grows, I see more adoption to help athletes improve performance and reduce injury.\n\nPlease share so others may benefit.\n\nThe post How to Use the kMeter to Develop Eccentric Power appeared first on Freelap USA.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nResisted Sled Sprint Training – Part 1 – Methods of Sled Load Prescription\n\nBy George Petrakos\n\nResisted sled sprint (RSS) training is an effective method to improve linear sprint performance – but how do we load the sled?\n\nThis article will provide an overview of the current methods of sled load prescription for resisted sled sprint (RSS) training. We are at a very early stage of quantifying the potential of RSS training for improved sprint performance. However, before we can effectively apply RSS training with our athletes, we have to understand why and how we are loading the sled.\n\nThe Benefits of Resisted Sled Sprint (RSS) Training\n\nPhysical training improvements in sprint performance can occur via two general means:\n\nIncrease in physical output\n\ne.g. increase production of triple extension force/power\n\nImprovement in efficiency of physical output\n\ne.g. increase in horizontal application of force\n\nSprint acceleration performance is largely determined by the angle of application of ground reaction force [1-3]. JB Morin and colleagues summarize the mechanical determinants of sprint acceleration as a ‘technical ability to apply horizontal force’ (Figure 1) [2]. RSS training is a tool to provide a potential improvement in horizontal application of force.\n\nWe constantly strive for effective and efficient methods for training transfer to performance. For an overview of ‘training transfer’, please read this top quality piece by Warren Young [4]. RSS training is likely to provide an enhancement of both physical output and efficiency of physical output .\n\nAdding a resistive load provides an overload of the force component [5, 6]. RSS training acutely provides the athlete with less braking forces, [7-9] longer opportunity for greater forward trunk lean and, therefore, a better chance for horizontal application of force [7, 10-13]. Although athletes spend longer on the ground when sled sprinting, this provides more time to develop their ability to produce propulsive (or horizontal) forces [9, 10]\n\nA recent review found 10 from 11 peer-reviewed studies observed RSS training improvements in either acceleration or maximal velocity sprint performance [14]. In sprint and strength-trained rugby players, 12 sessions of 3×20 m of RSS at a 12.6%BM sled load combined with 3×20 m of URS was enough to provide improvements in speed performance beyond 6×20 m of URS training alone [15]. The review also discounted the ‘heavy sleds make you slow’ myth. Sled loads from 12-43%BM were effective in the improvement of sprint performance.\n\nAlthough RSS training is an effective method for improvements in sprint performance, the review deemed it unlikely to be more effective than unresisted sprint (URS) training [14]. However, many of the studies kept sled load rather light. Part 2 of this article will discuss RSS load and the potential adaptations from different loads. Secondly, RSS training may provide different neuromuscular and biomechanical adaptations to URS training alone.\n\nSlow Down\n\nBut…we have a problem. We do not even have a grasp on the absolute fundamentals of resisted sprint training. We’re not even sure how to load the sled.\n\nOur current situation reminds me of NASA’s Mars Polar Lander of which crashed as two separate teams were antagonistically working in imperial and metric units (I’m certainly not comparing sport science to rocket science – we’re obviously a lot smarter with our finances). Authors have utilized three different methods of sled load prescription used in peer-reviewed training studies. This is a problem. Without a uniform and agreed method of sled load prescription, we cannot begin to accurately discuss RSS volumes, intensities and training adaptations.\n\nAbsolutely Relative\n\nTable 1 outlines the current and proposed methods of sled load prescription.\n\nTable 1. A comparison of current resisted sled sprint loading methods. Method Characteristics Limitations Absolute load (kg) Simple Does not account for body mass, sprint speed characteristics.\n\nUnlikely to provide targeted or uniform training stimulus across group of athletes. Percentage of body mass (%BM) Simple, requires athlete weigh-in only.\n\nAccounts for athlete body mass. Does not account for force, power or sprint speed characteristics.\n\nUnlikely to provide targeted or uniform training stimulus across group of athletes. %Vdec (decrement in unresisted sprint velocity) Accounts for differences in sprint performance.\n\nLikely to provide targeted or uniform training stimulus across group of athletes.\n\nResults from studies can be generalised to practice regardless of sled or surface type.\n\nCan be used with other measureable resisted sprint methods e.g. Run Rocket or Exer-Genie. Requires pre-testing with speed gates.\n\nNo ‘maximal’ value means opportunity to periodise RSS loads is unlikely. %MRSL (maximal resisted sled load) [16] Accounts for differences in sprint acceleration performance.\n\nLikely to provide targeted or uniform training stimulus across group of athletes.\n\n‘Maximal’ value provides opportunity for periodisation of RSS loads\n\nResults from studies can be generalised to practice regardless of sled or surface type.\n\nCan be used with other measureable resisted sprint methods e.g. Run Rocket or Exer-Genie. Requires pre-testing with speed gates, of which can hold time-constraints with large groups.\n\nI do not prescribe an absolute load (e.g. 10kg) or a load relative to athlete body mass (%BM). I would not ask a squad of 15 rugby players to each back squat 100kg, or hang clean 50% of their bodyweight. Why generalize these methods to RSS training? Body mass is rarely a determinant of sprint performance. Furthermore, RSS performance is related to individual force, power and sprint characteristics [16]. RSS programs prescribed with either absolute or %BM methods mean the coach is providing a non-uniform or unknown training stimulus among athletes (Figure 2). Alternative approaches are required.\n\nAlternative loading strategies must account for an athlete’s resisted sprint velocity or acceleration ability. Table 1 outlines the benefits and limitations of two alternative resisted sprint loading methods: %Vdec (decrement in unresisted sprint velocity) and %MRSL (maximal resisted sprint load).\n\nMeasurement of %Vdec is simple (Table 2) and application of this method has been used in various training studies [11, 17-21]. This method has much potential for use in applied settings. It accounts for both unresisted and resisted sprint velocity. Therefore, %Vdec accounts for the technical demands of resisted sprinting (e.g. greater trunk angle, changes in force production, changes in force application).\n\nTable 2. Simple method for %Vdec testing. Steps 1 Decide upon RSS training distance (say, 20m). 2 Test and record time/velocity for 20m URS trials. 3 Test and record time/ velocity for 20m RSS trials with a range of resisted loads. 4 Decide upon the % decrement in time/ velocity you wish train at – prescribe corresponding sled load.\n\nMRSL was originally developed by Martinez-Valencia, Pedro Alcaraz and their research group [16]. MRSL is somewhat of a misnomer. MRSL does not indicate the heaviest load before an athlete can physically move the sled. In this respect, it is not analogous to a traditional one repetition maximum (1RM).\n\nThe MRSL method is illustrated in Table 3 and Figure 3. Simply, MRSL is the “maximal load at which the athlete remains in sprint acceleration from 10 to 20 m in a 0-20 m resisted sled sprint”. For lovers of diagrams, Figure 4 further illustrates the description of MRSL. As we increase sled load, the rate of acceleration between 10 and 20m decreases. Eventually, sled load increases to the point where the athlete is decelerating, i.e. we have trialed beyond the maximal load to maintain acceleration.\n\nTable 3. Simple method for MRSL testing. Steps 1 Test and record times for 20m RSS trials. Record 10-15m (section A) and 15-20 m (section B) velocity. See diagram below. 2 If velocity of section A 3 If velocity of section A > section B, the athlete is decelerating. The corresponding load has surpassed MRSL. 4 Decide upon the %MRSL you wish train at – prescribe corresponding sled load.\n\nAlthough not identical, the idea of MRSL is not too far removed from the 1RM method of standard weight-lifting loading protocols. The MRSL test provides the practitioner with a single value. This value can act as a ‘maximal load’. Based on a ‘maximal load’, RSS loads can be programmed and based on the adaptation required by the practitioner. Part 2 of this article will expand on RSS programming using the MRSL method.\n\nIn-house research at UCD High Performance has shown MRSL to be a reliable method that significantly correlates with performance tests such as 0-10 m speed, 0-20 m speed, vertical and horizontal countermovement jump, horizontal bounding and loaded jump squats. Therefore, the test is certainly superior to the %BM or absolute load methods. MRSL loads were measured at between 22-50%BM for females and 30-65%BM for males. The top-end numbers are quite heavy, yes.\n\nFigures 5-1 through 5-5 illustrate how heavier sleds induce greater forward trunk lean and, therefore, increase the likelihood of greater horizontal force application.\n\nProvided the athlete is accelerating, the trunk lean during a resisted sprint will be specific to, or greater than, the trunk lean at a certain portion of URS acceleration, i.e. trunk lean over 20 m at 100%MRSL and that of very early URS acceleration. Therefore, training with loads close to MRSL may provide the athlete with increased exposure/ practice at the trunk angle experienced in early acceleration. More practice = a greater chance of developing a more favorable motor pattern or positive change in acceleration technique that enhances greater horizontal force application.\n\nThe practical application of MRSL will be discussed in Part 2 of this article.\n\nSummary\n\nRSS training is an effect tool for improvements in sprint performance. Adaptations are likely related to improved horizontal application of force. However, we are yet unsure of how to prescribe sled load.\n\nAbsolute or % BM sled load prescription methods do not account for sprint or acceleration performance. It is unlikely these methods provide a uniform stimulus between athletes.\n\nThe %Vdec is a simple and relative method of resisted sled load prescription. This method accounts for between-athlete differences in sprint performance and resisted sled sprint mechanics. However, this method does not inform the coach of a ‘maximal’ load or a measure of acceleration quality.\n\nThe MRSL method is superior in terms of providing an understanding of the relationship between sled load and the trunk angles obtained during specific URS phases.\n\nPinch of Salt\n\nThis piece of work is established from a combination of research evidence, opinion and most importantly, training/ coaching experience. I still have much to discover, and I invite critique, questions, and discussion.

Matthew Neel explains the benefits of the system for speed training.\n\nXceleration Sports Performance Labs Founder Matthew Neel explains the benefits of the 1080 Sprint.\n\nTranscript\n\nWe spent nineteen years developing the most comprehensive speed training program, and in those nineteen years we have never come across something as game changing as the 1080 Sprint.\n\nOur whole business is based on finding what limits an athlete’s speed and finding as many limiting factors as possible and doing everything we can to correct them. The 1080 Sprint allows us to see those things instantaneously. We can see whether it’s a force production problem, whether it is a turnover problem, or whether it’s a peak speed issue and just their movement speed alone.\n\nThe 1080 Sprint has really allowed us to expand our teaching and coaching capabilities. The instant feedback and the ability to give cues that we were never able to give before has really been one of the greatest advantages of the 1080 Sprint in our facility.\n\nThe ability to not just measure and see what an athlete’s made of, but actually being able to give them real-time cues and being able to change what they’re doing instantaneously as they feel it and see it visually coming back to the screen and looking at it has been a great asset to us.\n\nThe 1080 Sprint has allowed us to expand our teaching and coaching capabilities. - Matthew Neel\n\nClick To Tweet\n\nFor instance, when we are training athletes to run a faster 40-yard dash, we need to see exactly when they are reaching their peak speed, how much power they are producing and where they produce that power. We also like to see how long they’re producing that power. And if we can look inside an athlete’s 40-yard sprint and start to break it down and start to tear apart things and look at, well, they may have hit their peak speed at ten yards, and we need them to hit it at twelve yards, for instance. Or they can only hold their top speed for two or three meters, then we know exactly what area we need to train and develop.\n\nThe information that you get back from a 1080 Sprint test is going to give you more data that is applicable to a specific sport of specific position, more comparable than any data that you are going to receive out of typical combine test that we use currently. And used in conjunction with it’s a great tool to look inside that athlete and see what level they can actually play or perform.\n\nPlease share so others may benefit.\n\nThe post 1080 Sprint Review at Xceleration Sports Performance Labs appeared first on Freelap USA.\n\n↧\n\nHigh School Football Spring Training Test Results\n\nBy Chris Korfist\n\nEarlier this year, I was given the opportunity to work with a football team, something that I haven’t done in over a decade.
