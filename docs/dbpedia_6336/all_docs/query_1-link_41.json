        "text": "In 1952 the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam was vastly enriched with 1400 objects from the estate of the Amsterdam Jewish banker Dr Fritz Mannheimer (1890-1939). During his years in Amsterdam as a banker, from 1916 to 1939, Mannheimer purchased 3000 high quality objects of applied art and fine art. The complicated story of acquisition, the enforced Nazi purchase, recuperation and distribution has been discussed in my earlier article, see web site. About 1/30th of this treasure, some 100 objects, were purchased, through intermediaries, in Russia around 1930. This article attempts to answer these questions: Which art dealers, advisors or intermediaries did Mannheimer employ for buying from the Soviets? And which objects now in the Rijksmuseum originally stem from what collections in Russia?\n\nFinally, the chapter of 4 of the book is devoted to the framing of pictures by the 19th century Russian Romantics, as well as to the problem of the frame in the culture of the Russian avant-garde of the 1910’s - 1920’s. The Romantic aesthetic was concerned not with the problem of imagination [as was Baroque aesthetics], nor of reason [like the aesthetics of Neoclassicism], but of emotional experience and the psychological perception of the object. Thus if the frames of the Baroque or Neoclassical periods deployed fantasy or reason in the service of their mental images, the frames of famous pictures by Vereshchagin or the Russian ‘Wanderers’ brought their consciousness to bear on a quite different objective – the naturalistic depiction of a moralistic maxim or of a historical episode. This was the background against which the Russian avant-garde declared the end of the age of easel painting, thereby ‘overcoming’ the frame-as-window and putting forward a fundamentally new aesthetic of images."
