        "text": "This research article raises the question whether any link can be suppositioned between “factual” history and what we normally call “the history of literature”. Putting the texts of Eclogue IV and Boris Godunov to a close and thorough examination will perhaps take us nearer to finding answer to this question. There are a number of common features shared by Eclogue 4 and the Boris-drama that invite for a joint investigation of these works. Puškin's poetic achievement as the author of Boris Godunov “takes after” Vergil's in terms of genre innovation: both poets undermine the traditional generic form they inherited from their predecessors and this w oboikh sluchajakh leads to the establishment of a new genre. Puškin's demythologizing of history has much in common with the way Vergil handles myth and history: both Eclogue 4 and Boris Godunov offer insight into their own genre in the making, i.e. how a specific literary genre is born: the new genre is generated by the new artefact itself. Finally, both texts convey unmistakeable reference(s) to the idea of “eternal return”. In part 1 of this paper I dwell upon the fulfilment in Eclogue 4's poetic structure of what I call “implicit prophecy”. This kind of prediction in Eclogue 4 serves as a vehicle for anticipating the poetic structure. “Implicit prophecy” bears reference to what can be interpreted as an “inner event”. This “event” “takes place” in the course of literary history. In the second part of this study I discuss some of the aspects of the poetic composition of Boris Godunov, hoping to locate its place and the role in the literary process that make for its significance in what we define as “the history of literature”. It is the poetic structure of both the Vergil eclogue and the Puškinian drama that bears responsibility for the formation of the poetical self. In this paper I offer a “mapping” of “implicit prophecy” through which the literary artefact is to poetically anticipate, or “predict”, itself, fulfilling this prophecy and calling itself, the literary work, into existence. The poetic performance in the Fourth Eclogue revives, re-generates, the pastoral genre so that while none of the elements tradititonally marking this genre (shepherd, love etc.) appears in this poem, the bucolic character is assured solely by the autoreferentialities that make for the formation of the eclogue's poetic structure. The text thus constituted is an autoreferential realization of this innovative intention: the poetic innovation displays itself, making us witness the “making of literary history”. The Golden Age, whose arrival has actually been indicated at the beginning of the poem, is to be conceived as a consummated form of the poet's self-awareness. A close-reading of Pimen and Grigorii's monologues exposing the monastery scene reveals that the poetization of Karamzin's narrative makes up for the re-composed narrative to emerge from beneath a work of historiography. The famous Tacitean principle of sine ira et studio is resuscitated in the Puškin text, emerging in Grigorii's monologue as an important poetic allusion. The poet, however, deconstructs and re-assembles the chronicler-figure he had previously launched in the “Tacitean” direction. The equivalence of the narrator with the author-historian is thus questioned by the Puškinian “historiography”, with the author straightaway becoming “the historian”, that is, the authentic writer of the narrative woven about Boris Godunov and the “smuta”. In Vergil's poem the idea of “eternal return” is conveyed by a reference to the expected arrival of the “Golden Age”. The notion of the “Golden Age” will later return on a much grander scale: Vergil, regarded as the greatest of Roman poets in what came to be the “classical period” of the Roman literature, was to become an emblem for the “Golden Age” of that literature. Within the Russian paradigm it is Puškin who is allotted the same role as Vergil in Rome: he has become the etalon for Russian writers; he came to represent the “Golden Age” in Russian literature, having created the literary language in Russia himself. Vergil's Fourth Eclogue and Puškin's Boris Godunov are both vivid examples of how a literary genre is being re-created in and by a single poetic work that has conspicuously been made void of some of the most typical tokens that were traditionally regarded as indispensable for those genres. Or briefly: how poetic language on its own creates canon, poetry and literature."
