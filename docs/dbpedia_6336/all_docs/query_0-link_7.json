        "text": "V 9 No. 40 Paul O'Shea's Report from Doha\n\nWe’ll Always Have Doha\n\nBy Paul O’Shea\n\nAs Rick wistfully tells Ilsa in the 1942 film classic, Casablanca, “We’ll always have Paris,” so will I remember the 2019 World Track and Field Championships in Doha.\n\nDoha was my seventh World Championships. I’d been to other majors in Edmonton, Paris, Helsinki, Berlin, Moscow and Beijing. Mercifully free of the jingoism and marketing excesses of the Olympic Games, Worlds are every bit as rewarding as their four-year elders.\n\nDoha Worlds: the world’s third largest sporting event, with more than 200 countries sending athletes. Impressive results at Khalifa International Stadium: one world record, 86 national records, 43 countries won medals, with the United States taking 29. Jamaica (12) and Kenya (11) were second and third.\n\nDoha City, Qatar: scorching, humid, polluted. Skyscrapers springing from the desert, sixty-nine hundred air miles from my hometown airport, Washington Dulles.\n\nAbutting the Persian Gulf, Qatar is small, about the size of Connecticut. It sits on the world’s largest natural gas reserves. The country is also one of the world’s most contaminated, and on some evenings there was a haze in the stadium. The country readies for the 2022 World Cup when the average high temperature in December is just 76 degrees compared with September’s 102.\n\nMost of Qatar is populated by expats (over two million) with just 300,000 nationals. Many sleek, new high-rise buildings. At night, there’s a light show with skyscrapers outlined and lit up like giant Christmas trees. Off in the distance sits Doha Bay.\n\nThe weather was stifling, from the moment I stepped out of Hamad International Airport and into the city air. Three digits\n\nFahrenheit, with what one mightwryly call a wind-chill of\n\n113 degrees. Fortunately, the indoor cooling system at the International Stadium was effective. Some nights a sweater\n\nwas useful.\n\nClimate change skeptics might have second thoughts if they breathed in and out in Doha. It’s the world’s fourth most toxic environment. Three years ago the World Health Organization said air pollution in Qatar “vastly exceeds safe limits and is damaging the health of the population.” The Qatar Times, the country’s English daily newspaper, pushed back against the pollution charge. “The Ministry of Municipality and Environment has dismissed as baseless a report that suggested high levels of carbon emissions in Qatar. The ministry said the report did not properly reflect the reality of emissions at the global level in Qatar.”\n\nMany riyals, Euros and dollars probably exchanged ownership in the transaction that brought the Worlds to the Middle East. No one should be shocked, shocked that pay to play had gone on here.\n\nOpening day the women’s marathon started at 11:59 p.m. with the temperature at 90 degrees and 73 per cent humidity. Only 28 of the 68 starters finished, with the winning time 2:32:43. Bronze medalist Helalia Johannes from Namibia said afterwards, “I can’t say I enjoyed it.”\n\nOne memorable performer was the first American, Robin Groner, 41 years old, with three kids, and a full time job as a nursing administrator in New Jersey. She ran 2:38:44 in sixth place. Ten days later the weather was more cooperative for the men (the temperature was 84 at the gun with 51 per cent humidity), and 2:10:40 was the winning time. Only 18 of 73 starters failed to finish, still a high number for an elite field.\n\nTen days later the weather was more cooperative for the men (the temperature was 84 at the gun with 51 per cent humidity), and 2:10:40 was the winning time. Only 18 of 73 starters failed to finish, still a high number for an elite field.\n\nThe middle- and distance-running events largely went according to form. Favorites Ajee Wilson* and Donavan Brazier led early and won, Brazier with an American record, taking down Johnny Gray’s ancient (1985) 1:42.60 by a tenth.\n\n*correction: Wilson finished 3rd in 1:58.84.\n\nIn the men’s 1500 Timothy Cheruiyot quickly escaped challengers with 55.01 and 1:51.74 splits. Matthew Centrowitz ran about to form. He was eighth in 3:32.81.\n\nEqual-opportunity destroyer Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands strolled in the back of the twenty-two starters in the early laps of the women’s 10,000, then went through the field and cruised to a thirteen-second win in 30:17.62. A week later she took charge early in the 1500. Her 3:51.95 was the sixth fastest in history. Someday, could there be a Zatopek Triple in her kit?\n\nThe LetsRun crew called the men’s steeple the greatest ever. Our seats were a meter or two off the finish line, and looking down on the finishers, I thought Conseslus Kipruto had lost to Ethiopia’s Lemecha Girma, but the Kenyan won by one one-hundredth of a second in 8:01.35. In the men’s 10,000 Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda and Ethiopia’s Yomif Keleja fought an epic, side-by-side battle, with Cheptegei winning in 26:48.36.\n\nOne of the most anticipated events was the men’s high jump and the appearance of Qatar icon Mutaz Barshim. Slim as a whippet, returning from foot surgery, he made the first four heights, missed twice at 7-7 3/4, then cleared that on his third try. To defend his title Barshim soared 7-9¾, a height he hadn’t made in four years.\n\nU.S. relay teams performed admirably, winning four of the five baton events, including a mixed-sex four by four. Despite a history of botched handoffs and other mishaps, the men’s 400-meter relay team treasured the stick as if it were letters of transit that got Ilsa out on the night plane.\n\nI signed on for this Track and Field News Tour with many of the usual suspects, renewing and forging new relationships with the pursuers of international achievement. Their backstories enriched the memories from the oval: this is the track meet with benefits.\n\nT&FN Publisher and Tour Leader Janet Vitu waged vocal hand-to-hand combat with Qatar security as she pressed to get our bus closer than a 20K walk to the stadium. She prevailed.\n\nRoger Heinle is an Iowa corn and soybean farmer whose father spent eight consecutive years where duty and economic necessity had him milk the cows twice a day, every day for eight years.\n\nLong-time Cerritos College coach Gary Gaudet is a world-traveller with an impressive collection of passports. In addition to his extensive background in the sport that earned him California Community College Coaches Hall of Fame honors, he’s toured 116 countries. At Doha he oversaw the Tour’s Prediction contests, won by Tim Bianchi, Dan McGregor and Krish Kartha.\n\nWith us was Paul Pearson who never stopped running after Texas Western (I wrote earlier for Once Upon a Time in the Vest about his career Navigating the Currents of Time - Paul Pearson. Now in his late sixties, Paul’s an impressive age group runner and recently placed second in the National Senior Games 1,500. Going out for his morning workout in Doha he was brought to his knees by the atmosphere after running just twenty minutes.\n\nTour colleagues benefited from the high-performing team of Hollobaugh and Hollobaugh. Jeff’s daytime job is writing for Track and Field News, online and in print. In Doha his nighttime assignment was producing the daily TAFNOT TIMES, two pages of inside baseball delivered to the doorstep each morning. His book, The Miler is a rewarding read for those helping runners devise strategies to win middle distance races.\n\nAlso in our group was TrackandFieldHunter.com, writing crisply,\n\ncogently for his blog and others. I profiled Davidearlier for Once\n\nUpon a Time in the Vest.\n\nDavid Hunter, Writing for the Future, Today\n\nTucked into a corner of the pedestrian mall and adjacent to our hotel, the IAAF presented its Heritage World Athletics Championships Exhibition. Case after case of memorabilia on loan from legendary performers and museums. Zatopek’s shirt and shoes. A Bannister signed program. Jesse Owens’ Ohio singlet. Lasse Viren’s Onitsuka Tigers. On a television screen a loop of international cross country race videos.\n\nAt Khalifa International Stadium, aside from the inescapable heat there were minor management blunders. The hosts chose to site the medal ceremony up, up and away, high in the venue’s end zone. Medal winners were literally in reduced circumstances.\n\nStadium vendors adopted a here’s looking at you kid, nonchalance when selling water. Hollis Lenderking recorded six different prices in as many days. He’s the USATF Pacific Association sports administrator whose athletic history includes some fifty ultra marathons, and extensive beverage experience.\n\nMedia reviews of the 17th Worlds were mixed. Writing in The New York Times, Tariq Panja focused on the weak attendance that had to be augmented by busing in loads of migrant workers to cut embarrassment for the Qataris. But the heat drew most of his criticism. What the writer failed to acknowledge in his story were the performances.\n\nLetsRun said, “The track and field display that was put on last week in Doha at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships were unbelievable. Five years ago, when Worlds were awarded to Doha many wondered how Doha’s hot weather and the late date of the championship would impact the performances and some were making dire predictions, particularly for the long distance events. In actuality, nearly everything about the Worlds—minus the crowds and the absurd heat for the women’s marathon—ended up being amazing.”\n\nSeb Coe, unanimously reelected IAAF President at the Worlds, was effusive in his evaluation. “The world’s athletes have put on the best show in the history of the IAAF World Athletics Championships, according to the competition performance rankings which are used as an objective measure of the quality of international competition.”\n\nBased on IAAF scoring tables the men’s outstanding feat was the 75 foot two inch throw of shot put titlist Joe Kovacs.\n\ned. note. In 2014 we first saw Joe Kovacs and wrote this article about him. Joe Kovacs, An Emerging Force in the Shot Put\n\nThe women’s premier achievement was the 23 foot 11 ½ inch long jump by Germany’s Malaika Mihambo. Curiously, the IAAF failed to recognize in its list of the top five meet performances the world record 400-meter hurdle victory of Dalilah Muhammad. The mark was worth a $100,000 bonus.\n\nSo, as time goes by, the 2021Worlds will be contested at the newly reconstructed Hayward Field.

I will not repeat it.\n\nHere are my thoughts on this.\n\nNow Shalane Flanagan and Cam Levins have both come forward and said they should have been more supportive of Mary Cain. Probably a lot of others who should have as well, especially as Mary was so young when she was with NOP. Most of these others were post collegiate in their careers. Mary was taken out of high school to be turned into a world class athlete. Actually she was already world class, but her physical development was not yet over. She was in that girl to woman transition period and that was incredible stress put onto her physiology and psyche. When we consider this, it is not uncommon at all that thousands of girls go through this transition in their teenage years while combining high performance sports with growing into womanhood. When I was coaching the women at the U.of Dayton it was common knowledge that menstrual cycles would cease. There were already rules in place that weigh ins could only be done by staff in the training room privately and that information was not passed on to coaches. It was more for medical staff to be aware of possible anorexia or other eating disorders. NOP made their own rules so the athletes who were getting a salary from NOP had to put up and shut up. Their careers were on the line, and it is quite possible that insubordination was frowned upon. I don't know what if any sanctions were placed on the athlete for being insubordinate at NOP.\n\nIn the past, there were several schools of coaching, all successful including Igloi, Cerutty, Lydiard, Bowerman, Stampfl, Gerschler. I'm sure they all left some broken bodies along the wayside. Some were a lot harder than others. Bowerman was known to be very cautious about over training his runners, but some of the others were not. You thrived or you died.\n\nThe other thing that is very disconcerting is taking a kid away from home at a young age to train. This happens a lot in other sports such as women's gymnastics. But I think often a parent accompanies the young gymnasts to a training site to live. Still they ultimately turn their kid over to another adult to tell them how to live. We know things can go wrong such as happened at Michigan State. Parents have to examine their own motivation for doing this. I can imagine Mary begging her parents to let her go to Oregon where she would have the greatest coach in the world. Back in the day in East Germany, you didn't have to beg your parents to be allowed to go, you were taken by the State.\n\nHere in Canada we are dealing with a terrible time in our history when First Nations children were taken away at very young ages and forced to learn English, forget their traditional ways, and also be violated by opportunistic predators. It led to a long painful history, and today that cultural genocide will be a long time healing. I can see some parallels in this with how we treat young athletes. And when the athlete fails to live up to expectations they are dumped along the wayside.\n\nLook a bit further. In hockey, young boys become property, literally 'owned' by hockey organizations. At sixteen they move out of their homes to live at effectively a foster home while they play hockey and maybe if there is time, go to school. If they fail to make progress, they usually get a job driving a beer truck. Further down the line, look at the art of ballet. A girl is not going to move on if she cannot squeeze through a very narrow template by a certain age. Ain't no fat girls dancing in the ballet Russe. They train as hard as any athlete. The men in ballet do too. A number of years ago, the male dancers in a professional company were tested against NHL hockey players and scored higher in every category except upper arm strength. This is how society treats its performers. It's sink or swim, crap or get off the pot. Everytime you watch some prodigy or a 'seasoned' performer making an athletic performance or a musical or other artistic endeavor, remember they have paid a painful price for your pleasure.\n\nGeorge Brose\n\nVancouver Island\n\nComment:\n\nPreaching to the choir about Salazar’s Hx and his playing the edges and that misguided zeitgeist around winning at any cost.

Obviously Vladimir Kuts is one of them, because he got his picture on the cover. How many can you name without going to some running website? They are from the countries of Kenya, Ethiopia, Finland, Australia, Ethiopia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. That makes the question a little easier doesn't it?\n\nI must confess that I have not yet seen this book and am offering a free lifetime subscription to this blog to any of our readers who will be so kind as to write a review.\n\nHere is what Amazon says about the book which is also available at Barnes and Noble.\n\nThe modern era of distance running began in the early years of the last century. The classic distances for competition have been the five and ten thousand metres. Over this period, the records for both distances have been broken many times by a variety of athletes from many different countries.\n\nThe records of today are far removed from those set from earlier eras. The world records of today would have been largely unimaginable only a few decades ago. Over the period covered in this book, the five thousand metre record has been reduced by some two minutes, while the ten thousand metre record has come down by almost five minutes.\n\nDespite the obvious similarities between the two events, only ten men have succeeded in breaking the world record in both distances, making for a very select group. The group comprises runners from Finland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Russia, Australia, Kenya and Ethiopia.\n\nThis book looks at the careers of those ten men, the eras in which they competed, the types of training they undertook, and their lives outside of their sporting careers. As such, it is of interest for the social and political times in which they lived in addition to their purely sporting achievements.\n\n↧\n\nV9 N. 43 Harrison Dillard One of the Truly Great Ones R.I.P.\n\nHarrison Dillard 1923-2019\n\nNovember 17, 2019\n\nHarrison 'Bones' Dillard passed away last week in Cleveland, his home town.Let me start from memory. Harrison Dillard, a World War II veteran served with an African American military unit the Buffalo Soldiers in Europe during the war. He stayed in the army for awhile and shortly after the war, he began competing in international competitions between the Allied Powers who were occupying Germany.\n\nHe was born in 1923 in Cleveland and as a 13 years old youngster he watched Jesse Owens' homecoming parade in 1936 after his return from the Berlin Olympics. Owens won four Olympic Golds, and so would Dillard. Both men went to the same high school, Cleveland East Tech and had the same coach Ivan Greene. After the war, Dillard would have followed Owens to Ohio State U., but he felt it was too far from home and he might be homesick.\n\nStatue on the Baldwin Wallace Campus\n\nWe have reported in the past about some of his achievents in a meet in Frankfort FRG. Eventually he found his way back home and enrolled in Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio where he truly came into his own as a 120 yard high hurdler. By 1948, he was the favorite in the US to be the top hurdler in his specialty, but as often happens in that event, the favorite stumbles, hits a hurdle and watches the race from the ground or staggering to the finish line. And then he goes home and waits 'til next year. This didn't happen to Mr. Dillard because he had an ace in the hole, the 100 meters which he went on to qualify for enabling him to travel to London as a sprinter. In the Olympic 100 meter finals, Harrison Dillard upset the favored Barney Ewell to take the gold medal, then later ran on the 4x100 meter relay and brought honor to himeslf and his country with another first place.\n\nBy the next Olympics in the the Finnish capitol of Helsinki, Harrison Dillard cleared all the hurdles and set the record straight that he was the best 110 meter high hurdler in the world.\n\n1952 Olympic Trials in L.A. Coliseum\n\nJack Davis and Harrison Dillard\n\nThanks to Pete Brown for this photo\n\nOne of my regrets since starting this blog is not trying to get an interview with Harrison Dillard. It was just a few years ago I was in the Cleveland area and spoke to his daughter, but for some reason I decided not to disturb Mr. Dillard with a bunch of questions. Around that time I found the following article about him, written perhaps by someone who didn't know a lot about track and field but who could interview him to capture the more personal side. George Brose\n\nHere is something I had never heard about Harrison Dillard.\n\nHe was the 110 HH champion in the 1953 Maccabiah Games. GB\n\nFrom Grace Butcher (pioneer of women's distance running and Cleveland area native.)\n\nGeorge, here is my Harrison Dillard story.\n\nStarting track at 15 in 1949 as a hurdler (as you know, no long runs till our crusade in the late 50's), of course I knew about Harrison Dillard. His failure to make the team as a hurdler in '48 was such a shock but his 100 gold such a joy, then 4 yrs. later....\n\nSo when the time came in 1951 to choose a college, I chose Baldwin Wallace because if I went there, I could hurdle the same hurdles that Harrison Dillard had hurdled! What better reason? Plus the National Jr. Olympic Championship had been at that track in 1950, so I'd already run on the same track he'd run on, and he was the starter for that meet. I ran off to get married during the first quarter--I was 17, knew everything, no reason to go to college. (Started again in 1962 at age 28, older and wiser, at near by Hiram College, marriage and two children later.)\n\nYears after that, at a 5k road race in Cleveland, I was lined up for the start when the startling announcement came that Harrison Dillard was the starter! Oh my gosh! I hadn't known that. The gun went off, and my only thought during most of that race was his name running through my head in rhythm with my steps: \"Harrison Dillard! Harrison Dillard!\" I even said it out loud. And after the race, amazingly, I saw him sitting by himself as we waited for the results, so I went over to him, sat down, and told him why I'd gone to BW. It was a lovely conversation. He signed my number. He emanated niceness, gentleness. I have tears in my eyes as I recall that. What a gift to the world he was. Grace\n\nBill Schnier wrote:\n\nThanks for your article about Harrison \"Bones\" Dillard. He was one of the most dominating T&F men in US history and also one of the most inspirational after his fall in the 1948 Olympic Trials. Stories about him were exchanged at track meets in the Ohio Athletic Conference when I ran for Capital in 1965-66 and he had run for the Baldwin-Wallace Yellow Jackets about two decades before. He was certainly a pride to that small school in Berea, Ohio as well as to our entire conference and state.\n\nIt is remarkable that Jesse Owens, David Albritton, Harrison Dillard, and so many others all went to Cleveland East Tech High School. I have always wondered which Ohio high school would have won a mythical meet of all schools, past or present, when their top marks were reported. In other words, who has the best school records? My best guesses would be Cleveland East Tech, Cleveland Glenville, Lancaster, Dayton Dunbar, and Dayton Roosevelt. All school records would have to be converted to the current meters including the 100, but it would be quite an examination of history and one well worth examining.\n\nRichard Trace wrote: \"When I was a student at Miami,\n\nBW came for a meet and Harrison Dillard showed us how to do it.\n\nTribute to Harrison Dillard in Cleveland Seniors Magazine\n\nBy Debbie Hanson\n\nHere is how Sportsreference.com describes Harrison Dillard's career.\n\n\"Bones\" Dillard caused a major Olympic upset when he won the 100 m in 1948. He went to the 1948 AAU with an unprecedented streak of 82 consecutive hurdle victories, but was surprisingly beaten by [Bill Porter]. A week later, at the Final Trials, Porter won again and Dillard failed to finish. But he made the Olympic team by placing third in the 100 m and then took the Olympic title. Four years later he made no mistakes, winning the hurdles at Helsinki, and winning the gold on the sprint relay team for a second time. Originally inspired by the victory parade in his native Cleveland for [Jesse Owens] after the 1936 Olympics, Dillard developed into one of the most consistent hurdlers the world has ever seen. Owens encouraged Dillard to take up hurdling and later gave him the spikes he had worn in Berlin. Dillard went on to win 14 AAU titles and six NCAA championships, as well as setting world records in both the high and low hurdles.\n\nDillard was a member of the famed Buffalo Soldiers, which were African-American troops who fought valiantly in the Italian campaign from 1943-45 during World War II. He later was in charge of communications for the Cleveland Indians for 10 years. He also had a television and radio show and was responsible for the city's educational department spending\n\nPersonal Bests: 100 â 10.50 (1948); 110H â 13.6y (1948).\n\n1948 100 meters\n\nWinning the 100 meters in London\n\nThe fastest sprinters in the world in 1948 were felt to be [Mel Patton] of the USA and [Lloyd LaBeach] of Panama, who became his nationâs first Olympic athlete ever in London. They had raced several times in 1947 and early 1948, basically splitting the races, as there was little to choose between them. Another top sprinter was [Barney Ewell], but he had been at his best during the war years and was felt to be slightly past his prime. One athlete who would not compete in London was Hal Davis, who would have been favored in either 1940 or 1944 if the Olympics had not been lost to the war. An unusual thing happened at the US Olympic Trials. The heavy favorite in the high hurdles was [Harrison Dillard], who had not lost a hurdle race in several years, but he hit a hurdle in the final of the Trials and did not finish. Fortunately for him, he had also entered the 100 metres and made the team in that event behind Patton and Ewell. In the Olympic final, Patton got off to a disastrous start and was not a factor. Dillard led from start to finish with Ewell closing quickly to get the silver medal, LaBeach in third.\n\n1948 4 x 100 meters\n\nThe US team was originally to have had Ed Conwell but he had to withdraw with asthma, and was replaced by [Lorenzo Wright], who had medaled in the long jump. The US won the final quite comfortably, but were initially disqualified for a faulty exchange between [Barney Ewell] and Wright. On reviewing film of the race, it could be seen that the exchange had occurred within the legal zone, and the DQ was reversed, giving the United States the gold medal. However, the final decision did not become official for three days.\n\nDillard ran the third leg and Mel Patton anchored.\n\n1952 110 meters high hurdles\n\nAction in First Heat in Helsinki\n\nThe world record holder was Dick Attlesey (USA), but he hurt his foot in the heats of the US Olympic Trials, and did not make the team. But led by Dillard, the Americans again swept the medals, as they had in 1948. The finish was close between Dillard and [Jack Davis], Davis having been slowed by a poor start, likely due to being charged with a false start. Art Barnard was the third place finisher for the Americans.\n\n1952 4 x 100 meters\n\nDillard, Remigino, Stanfield, and Smith after the 4x100 victory\n\nThough the US had the fastest sprinters, the USSR team had won the 1950 European Championships and were known for teamwork and exact changeovers. In the final, the Soviets started out in the lead, led by [Boris Tokarev], and they maintained that until 100 metre champion [Lindy Remigino] caught them on the final turn. [Andy Stanfield] received the baton about equal with [Vladimir Sukharev] but ran away from him to win by two metres.\n\nDean Smith is the sole survivor of that 4x100 team. We are planning a story about Dean in the near future. ed.\n\nDillard and Ewell Steal the Show in Frankfort Aug 22 1948 by Ray Musleh\n\nHarrison Dillard and Jesse Owens with their high school coach Ivan Greene 1950\n\nThey Don't Build Hurdles or Hurdlers Like This Anymore\n\n↧\n\nV 9 N. 44 Old Photos from the Left Bank\n\nMy good friend Jerome McFadden (U. of Missouri 1963 and 4:05 miler, 2nd in Big 8 Conf.) is a frequent visitor to the City of Lights.

The British gentleman is Gerry Carr (not Jerry Tarr) and the American is Paul Winder.\n\nMy friend Geoff Williams in Victoria, BC brought the first notice to my attention. Mr. Carr was a thrower of things, implements of wood and metal, not the events for which Great Britain is best known. I take that back as PM Boris Johnson occasionally throws a public tantrum and others in that hallowed chamber are known to throw mud and and invective across the floor , sometimes scoring a hit but more often missing the point. I will not bring in the other English speaking governing bodies in the Western Hemisphere at this time, as I am growing quite weary from following their antics.\n\nPaul Winder\n\nPaul Winder was the alternate on the 1960 US 4x100 relay team which I'm sure most of you still remember as being disqualified after finishing first in the finals due to an out of zone exchange between Ray Norton and Frank Budd. He got to travel all the way to Rome and watch those events from the sidelines. He missed the chagrin of that race and probably was glad not to be associated too closely with that very low point of US sprinting history. Indeed it was probably the beginning of a long series of colossal losses in that event, interspersed with short bursts of brilliance.\n\nPaul is remembered by his alma mater Morgan State University in Maryland in this passage from their Hall of Fame Page.\n\nPaul was born in Atlantic City, N.J. He attended Pleasantville High School and was such a stand-out he was one of the highest recruited track prospects in the country. He chose to come to Morgan in 1957.\n\nUpon entering Morgan he immediately became recognized as Morgan's greatest track performer since Olympian George Rhoden. Among his accomplishments are an N.C.A.A. outdoor championship in the 100-meters, a 1959 National A.A.U. indoor-outdoor world record (6.1 sec.) in the 60-yard dash, an NAIA champion in 1959 in the 100-yards, an ICAA 100-meter champion in 1960. Paul was also a member of the 1960 400-meter Olympic relay team. He also captained the track team while at Morgan.\n\nPaul was a member of the R.O.T.C. as a Morgan man and entered the U.S. Marine Corps as a first lieutenant. During his military stint (1962-65), he was all-Marine track and field in the 100- and 200-meters and also the mile relay.\n\nOne of Paul's greatest thrills was having his Pleasantville High School name its track for him and the establishment of the \"Paul Winder Sportsmanship Award\".\n\nHere is what Geoff included on Gerry Carr.\n\nHi George. I check the local obits daily to see if I am in there and base my days activities on the results. As a consequence I get to recognise some names. Today it was Dr. Gerry Carr age 83 –a University of Victoria PE Professor. The name struck a bell so I read the whole thing and lo and behold he represented UK in the 1956 Olympics in discus ( not a strong event for us). I had seen him on occasions in the 50s as ( until Mark Pharaoh- 4th in Olympics) he was UKs best, Carr was 10th at Melbourne. Little on line about him but he may be known to some of your older correspondents. Thought you might be interested. He also represented England in the Commonwealth Games earning a bronze medal in the discus.\n\nOne anecdote that came my was was that Carr was practicing the discus in California and several football players came by the field that day and joined in and promptly started throwing futher than Mr. Carr.\n\nRegards.\n\nGeoff\n\nOther News\n\nMike Holloway, the Head Coach at the University of Florida has turned that program into an incredible powerhouse and recognized for his good works has been named the Head Coach for the 2020 United States Olympic Team going to Tokyo. This is considered a highly merited honor by all involved in the sport.\n\nOne bit of bad news for Mike this week however is that one of his top athletes has decided to \"go pro\".\n\nfrom Bruce Kritzler: Just heard Gators lost Hakim Sani Brown to pro track, after 2 yrs in Gainesville.

It’s gone. But that’s life.”\n\nYerman, who was part of the gold medalist 1,600-meter relay team, has endured anything but a simple life. At 80, the longtime Paradise resident is left to piece back together his life following the Camp Fire.\n\nOn Nov. 8, Yerman and his wife, Carol Mattern-Yerman, weren’t even in the country. The couple took a nine-day trip to Puerto Rico to visit a family friend and were left helplessly watching what was unfolding in their hometown.\n\n“We took a chance to have a good time,” Yerman said. “We watched (the Camp Fire) on TV.”\n\nMattern-Yerman’s daughter, Emily Vail, who was in Paradise, was the first to call Jack and Carol in Puerto Rico to alert them about the fire.\n\n“At first my daughter called … she goes ‘It’s looking really bad mom. We’re leaving,’” Mattern-Yerman said. “The last call I got from her she called to say goodbye. She said ‘It’s a firestorm. I love you. Goodbye.’ She made it. But at the time she didn’t think she was going to make it.”\n\nJack and Carol were only married for about four months when the Camp Fire broke out. The two were living in separate homes at the time. Jack’s home was burned and nothing was saved, but Carol had arranged for someone to watch her small, white rescue dog named Brady while they were in Puerto Rico. Thankfully, Yerman had stored his gold medal at Carol’s home.\n\n“(Carol) called the dog watcher and said ‘Hey get out of town, take the dog and take the gold medal too,’” Yerman said. “The dog and the gold medal were all we saved.”\n\nThe gold medal was won when the foursome of Yerman, Earl Young, Glenn Davis and Otis Davis finished with a world record time of 3 minutes, 2.37 seconds to win the 1,600-meter relay race at 1960 Olympics in Rome. Yerman ran an opening leg of 46.2 seconds.\n\n“Guys like to keep their Olympic running outfits and pins … but I lost my donkey derby trophy. That’s about as good as a gold medal,” Yerman joked. “Those were some nice memories up there.”\n\nLife before Paradise\n\nYerman had lived in Paradise since 1968, but was originally born in Oroville.\n\nHe never lived in Oroville since his mother and father divorced when he was born. He and his mother moved to Woodland where he grew up and went to high school.\n\nHis father, an alcoholic and drug addict, ended up dying of an overdose in Sacramento at the age of 55.\n\nHis family never owned a car, meaning he either had to walk, run or ride a bike to get around town. That’s when he grew fond of running and just being outside.\n\n“It was a great place to be a kid,” Yerman said. “We were kind of on the poor side. I never went on vacations so I had to make my own fun. The way I did was to go down to the park and play. It was a natural thing. I enjoyed physical activity.”\n\nAfter graduating from Woodland High School, Yerman ended up attending college at UC Berkeley, where he ran track and played fullback for the football team.\n\n“It wasn’t easy going to college,” Yerman said. “If you don’t make it, you’re a failure in your mind.”\n\nLike everything else in his life, Yerman’s journey to the Olympics didn’t come with ease.\n\n“Making the Olympics was a miracle for me — even getting there,” Yerman said.\n\nIn order to qualify for the Olympic Trials held at Stanford, Yerman had to finish in the top seven at the NCAA championships. Yerman was competing in the 400-meter race with the hopes of winning an individual gold medal.\n\n“There are eight guys in the race. I’m in last place watching them run away. It’s over,” Yerman recalled. “As we’re coming around the last turn, a kid from Iowa falls down. I qualified.”\n\n“Two weeks later, I didn’t have time to rest. So I was at Stanford, and I win. I was just lucky.”\n\nIn Rome, Yerman’s quest for an individual gold medal would end in the 400 semifinals, as described in the book “Your Time Will Come” by Jack’s son Bruce Yerman.\n\nYerman was able to still win gold as part of the 1,600-meter relay team.\n\nFinding home in Paradise\n\nAfter Yerman earned a master’s degree in teaching from Stanford, he and his then-wife Margo, began searching for a place to call home.\n\nThe two first tried living in Santa Clara, but it wasn’t quite what they were looking for.\n\n“We probably could have stayed there and done well, but we both just grew up in small towns,” Yerman said. “We said we want our kids to go to a town with one high school. Out in the country where the kids could run around a little bit.”\n\nThey started looking in Northern California, then Yerman landed a job teaching at Chico High.\n\n“We drove around and liked Paradise,” Yerman said. “It fit our mold better.”\n\nThey rented for their first three years in Paradise before purchasing their home where they would raise their four children.\n\nMargo Yerman died in May 2014 while holding Jack’s hand in their home.\n\nThe missing ring\n\nWhen Yerman and Carol returned to California from Puerto Rico, they didn’t have a home to go back to. They stayed in a friend’s fifth-wheel trailer in the meantime while they were figuring out what to do next.\n\nYerman, who had played for Cal in the 1959 Rose Bowl, had his Rose Bowl ring left behind in Paradise. When Paradise was opened back up to the public following the Camp Fire, Jack and Carol hesitated to go back to their properties and sift through the debris.\n\n“We didn’t personally do much sifting. It was just overwhelming,” Yerman said. “Most of the things I lost were un-siftable. They were consumed.”\n\nBut Yerman’s son, Bruce, decided to look through the debris of his childhood home. Within the rubble, he found the Rose Bowl ring, charred with the center jewel gone and melted. The twinkle of the diamonds placed in the shape of a football had been diminished but they still remain intact.\n\nYerman wanted the ring restored so he sent it to Jostens, the company that made it. About six weeks passed and the new, restored ring had arrived. It looked identical to the original, but the original, burned ring had yet to arrive at Yerman’s home.\n\nHowever, the original wound up in the possession of Tony Borders, a 31-yard old manager at Napa Auto Parts in Durham.\n\nAn unassuming white package arrived at Borders’ apartment. The packaging had Jack Yerman’s name with Borders’ address and no return address stamped on it.\n\n“It was just a little white bag with his name and my address,” Borders said. “It was super weird.”\n\nOften receiving junk mail, Borders didn’t think too much about the package. He placed the unopened bag on his coffee table, where it sat for two weeks.\n\nOne afternoon, Borders was tidying up his mail stack and decided to go ahead and open the package. There he found the burned Rose Bowl ring.\n\n“I opened it up and went ‘Whoa,’” Borders recalled. “I didn’t want to take a brush to clean it up. I didn’t want to destroy it.”\n\nBorders stored the ring in his safe, and then started doing some research. He searched the name ‘Yerman’ online and discovered he played in the Rose Bowl in 1959.\n\n“I thought maybe the family was getting it restored as a memento,” Borders said. “If this belongs to somebody’s family, that motivated me even more to try to find out who it belongs to.”\n\nBorders said he didn’t want to broadcast the ring everywhere for fear of an impostor trying to claim it. Instead, he reached out to Bruce Yerman on Facebook to try and get it back to his father. Borders and Bruce Yerman met up in Chico to give back the ring, a possession that Jack is thankful to have back in his life.\n\n“I called (Borders) up and thanked him,” Jack Yerman said.\n\n“What are the odds of somebody bringing it back?” said Mattern-Yerman.\n\nReturning home\n\nBoth Jack and Carol said they are thankful they were out of town the day of the Camp Fire, but being removed from the situation still leaves them wondering what would have happened had they been at home.\n\n“I’ve got mixed emotions. Sometimes we’re thankful, we really are. But sometimes we wished we were there and what we would have done,” Yerman said. “A lot of mixed emotions.”\n\nYerman, at one point, was actually on the missing persons list. He had received a few calls from friends asking if he was alive. Since then, the couple has listened to some speakers and done some counseling to deal with the situation.\n\nYerman still tries to see the silver lining within the situation. His granddaughter, Tori MacKay, a sophomore at Chico High, wrote a song about Paradise that Yerman happily likes to boast about. And at their temporary home, Yerman has grown fond of his neighbors.\n\n“There’s some very nice people here. Nice tenants,” Yerman said.\n\nThe couple now lives in Chico off of The Esplanade, in an apartment complex owned by Yerman.\n\nWeeks before the Camp Fire broke out, Yerman was renovating one of the units.\n\nThe previous tenants had trashed the place, leaving behind soiled couches and black stains in the bathroom.\n\n“It was disgusting,” Mattern-Yerman said.\n\nAfter the fire, Jack and Carol lived in a trailer for about six weeks before making the decision to move into the renovated apartment.\n\n↧\n\nV 9 N. 46 One of Jesse Owens' Gold Medals on the Auction Block\n\nJesse Owens' Gold Medal Auction (clik here for bidding info and picture of the medal)\n\nJust in time for Christmas.

I can only wonder what the discussions must be like in Putin's office these days. Certainly a few heads are in danger of being lopped off or at least a re-opening of a residential wing in the Gulags is being considered for some bureaucrats, not for cheating, but for getting caught. It was a run for your life situation after the balls up at Sochi for the domestic testing lab that got caught switching samples.\n\nSean Ingle reported today in The Guardian:\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has demanded the “toughest sanctions” against those responsible for deleting Russian doping tests in data handed over to the World Anti-Doping Agency – calling it “an attack on the credibility of sport and an insult to the sporting movement worldwide”. However, the IOC left the door open for Russian athletes to compete at next year’s Tokyo Olympics – provided they can show that they are clean.\n\nThat provoked a hostile reaction from the US Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart, who urged Wada to ban all Russian athletes from the 2020 Games after its compliance review committee found that the Moscow lab files, which were handed over to it by the Russians in January, had been manipulated.\n\n“Russia continues to flaunt the world’s anti-doping rules, kick clean athletes in the gut and poke Wada in the eye and get away with it time and time again,” said Tygart. “Wada must stand up to this fraudulent and bullying behaviour as the rules and Olympic values demand.”\n\nRussia was banned from last year’s Pyeongchang Winter Games as punishment for state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Sochi Olympics but 168 Russian athletes with no history of doping were cleared to compete as neutrals – a situation Wada’s compliance committee said may be repeated at Tokyo.\n\nTygart warned: “The response is inadequate, especially given the deceit perpetuated by the Russian sport system which is controlled by the government. Wada must get tougher and impose the full restriction on Russian athlete participation in the Olympics that the rules allow.”\n\nThe IOC maintains that “natural justice” requires them to punish any perpetrators but allow clean Russian athletes to compete. It also says there was no evidence that Russian Olympic Committee members were implicated in the “flagrant” manipulation of the Moscow lab data.\n\nBut the IOC was accused of being soft on Russia by lawyers for the whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who used to run the Moscow anti-doping laboratory before fleeing the country. “The Russian gangster state continues to deploy a predictable and deplorable policy of deception, evidence tampering and lying to cover up its crimes,” they said.\n\n“The Kremlin must think the people of the world are idiots to believe this shameless and transparent stunt. Wada should be applauded for revealing Russia’s latest crime, but if the IOC and the international sports regulatory framework gives Russia yet another free pass, other countries will simply follow in their footsteps.”\n\n↧\n\nV 7 N, 48 Mo Farah Still Has Skin in the Game\n\nMo Farah plans to return to the track after a brief sortie into full time road racing. Here is a report from the Associated Press today Nov. 29, 2019\n\nLONDON (AP) — Olympic champion Mo Farah is returning to the track and wants to defend his 10,000-meter title at next year’s Tokyo Games.\n\nAnnouncing his plans on his YouTube channel on Friday, Farah said: “I’m really excited to be competing. I’m back on the track.”\n\nFarah is a four-time Olympic gold medalist who won the 5,000-10,000 double at both the 2012 London Olympics and 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. He switched his focus to the marathon and road races after a farewell 5,000 victory at the Diamond League finals in Zurich in August 2017.\n\n“I hope I haven’t lost my speed,” said the 36-year-old British runner, won the Chicago Marathon in 2018.\n\nFarah’s announcement came one day after UK Athletics said it asked a lawyer to lead a review of its work with banned track coach Alberto Salazar and the Nike Oregon Project.\n\nSalazar worked with Farah from 2011-17, spanning his era of Olympic dominance, and was hired to advise UKA’s endurance program in 2013.\n\nSalazar was banned for four years by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last month for experiments with supplements and testosterone that were bankrolled and supported by Nike, along with possessing and trafficking testosterone.\n\nFarah was not implicated by USADA, and Salazar denies wrongdoing.\n\nSalazar has filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The case is unlikely to be judged before the Tokyo Olympics open on July 24. The men’s 10,000 final is set for July 31.\n\nSean Ingle writing for The Guardian today gives us the British point of view on this story.\n\nShares\n\n23\n\nTwo years after retiring from the track to run marathons, Mo Farah has performed a screeching U-turn and will defend his Olympic 10,000m title in Tokyo next summer.\n\nThe 36-year-old announced his decision after mulling over his disappointing 10th place at the Chicago marathon in October, although insiders have since revealed a niggle beforehand affected his performance.\n\nFarah has convinced himself he will be more competitive back on the track – and watched the recent world championships 10,000m final in Doha believing he could have beaten the winner, Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda, whose final lap time of 56sec was considerably slower than the Briton’s last 400m when claiming world gold in 2017.\n\n“I decided after Chicago, not straight away, but it was on my mind,” said Farah, who confirmed he would not attempt to double up in the 5,000m. “I was watching the world championship in Doha. I watched the 10,000m, and I watch other races, and part of you gets excited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You’re seeing people winning medals, for your country and stuff, and you ask yourself. It almost felt like I needed to be there. I still got a chance with the Olympics. Why would you turn it down?”\n\nFarah, who won double gold over 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics, added: “I hope I haven’t lost my speed but I’ll train hard for it and see what I can do.”\n\nTo qualify for the 10,000m in Tokyo, Farah will need to run 27min 28sec by 21 June. However he does not have to compete at the Night of the 10k PBs in Highgate in June, which doubles as the official British trial.\n\nThe qualifying standard should be a breeze for him, given it is nearly 45sec slower than his personal best. However, many in the sport would be surprised if Farah, who will be 37 when the Olympics come round, is able to recapture the staggering last-lap speed that made him an almost unbeatable winning machine between 2011 and 2017.\n\nFarah leaves a mixed legacy at the marathon, having run a European record 2:05:11 in winning the Chicago marathon in 2018 and finished third in London the same year, only to disappoint at the same races this year.\n\n“To win the Chicago marathon was nice, to finish third in London was OK, it was good,” he said. “But next year I’ve decided, Tokyo 2020, I’m going back on the track.”\n\nThe London marathon has confirmed Farah will not be runningnext April. However, he has left his options open to competing over 26.1 miles in the future.\n\n___\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nV 7 N. 49 Hayward Field Reconstruction Hitting a Few Snags\n\n↧\n\nV 9 N. 50 The Russians Aren't Coming ! The Russians Aren't Coming !!\n\nDecember 9, 2019\n\nFor the younger readers, our headline paraphrases the 1960s Alan Arkin film, The Russians Are Coming. The Russians Are Coming about a Soviet submarine that runs adrift off a small Cape Cod community and the reaction of the local villagers.\n\nThe Russians Are Coming. The Russians Are Coming: Trailer\n\nSo The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) has voted unanimously to ban Russian teams and athletes from competing under their flag at the Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 World Cup football competition in Qatar. The ban will be for four years. Seems the Russian sport juggernaught has once again run aground this time hitting a submerged testing lab in Lake Lausanne where WADA hangs out.\n\nHowever WADA has thrown out a bone for individual Russian athletes who can test clean. They will be allowed to compete under a neutral flag. Don't ask me who designs the neutral flag, I suggest a white hankie on a stick.\n\nThe Russians can still appeal this decision, which was unanimous, by going before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). No way a Russian oligarch will be sitting on that voting body. This will have to be done very quickly to be successful and still permit Russians to compete under their own Red White and Blue national flag. Odds aren't very great that this will happen, unless the Russians can come up with some incriminating video of the panel sitting on the CAS.\n\nTravis Tygart, the Execitive Director for the US Anti Doping Agency (USADA) wanted the punishment to go further by not allowing even 'clean' Russian athletes to participate in the Olympics.\n\nThis all boils down to a very politically motivated show of gamesmanship on the part of everyone. There is no doubt in my mind that the Russians cheated on an institutional level and continue to cheat and attempt manipulation of evidence when given a second chance to come clean. The world stage is the world stage. That is why actors wear makeup to aid them in pretending to be some other character. Now however the commercial side of life makes the selling of advertising and image as important as who wins, and if a little make up will help bring in more glory and sell more tickets, then so be it. I find it a tad ironic that this same day there was a release of information about how the American public was lied to by three successive governments concerning our involvement in Afghanistan to the cost of $1 Trillion and 2300 servicemen and women's lives.

I can only repeat my comments to your earlier note on this subject last month. Why should WADA or the IOC be made to decide whether Russian athletes are clean or not? Also the World Cup of Soccer is exactly what its name implies-a tournament for the best countries in the world-therefore the team is banned ( or should be) and that is that. We are putting up with enough lying and cheating in the world and here we have an opportunity to do something really positive. Also it would be for the long term benefit of individual Russian athletes . Maybe Felicity Huffman can talk to Putin and tell him the consequences of cheating.\n\nMy teeth are gritted fiercely. Geoff\n\nGeoff, I suspect that the Russians are still in the Lori Loughlin phase, somewhat in denial and trying to weasel out of any consequences. George\n\nGreat job George. You my beliefs on the use of performance enhancing drugs in track and field. From high school track and field athletes forward,any track and field athlete tested positive for any performance enhancing drugs by US Anti-Doping Agency should be banned for life from any track and field competition in the US.

Gregory\n\n↧\n\nV 9 N. 51 Sir Peter Snell R.I.P.\n\nIt is with much sadness that we report the passing of a true legend in the world of track and field.\n\nPeter Snell, 1960 800 meters, 1964 800 meters and 1500 meters Olympic Champion who passed away in his sleep last Saturday December 7, 2019.\n\n.\n\nHis 800 in 1960 of 1:46.3 was an Olympic record.\n\nThat win in Rome was a bit of a surprise to everyone, although Murray Halberg had earlier in the day shown the world what the new school of Lydiard trained Kiwis were capable of doing winning the 5000 meters. In 1962 in his homeland, Peter would take down the world records in the 880 and mile on a short grass track and better the mile a second time on cinders a year later. He also set a world record at 1000 yards the first time he raced on an indoor track in Los Angeles.\n\nWinning the 1500 meters at Tokyo\n\nIn 1964 he lowered the 800 OR again to 1:45.1, then took the 1500 in 3:38.1 which did not break Herb Elliott's record. Peter was one that will be remembered for a long time for many reasons but his powerful stride and strength down the straight will be difficult to forget. He could kick with anyone in his prime and only rarely lost a race unless his fitness level was not what it should have been at the time. He made a name for himself athletically but then proved himself more than capable in the classroom, earning a Phd. in Excercise Physiology under Phil Gollnick at Washington State University and then working for many years at the University of Texas in Dallas Fort Worth.\n\nWhen he retired from running, I believe he was working for a cigarette company, Rothmans, in New Zealand, but found this work limiting if he were putting in appearances for a product that was so detrimental to the public health even though they supported sport. In 1971, he came to the US to participate in a TV game show Super Stars where well known athletes competed with each other in a number of events not necessarily relating to the sport where the made their name. Peter won enough money to fund his way through university and eventually settled in the US.\n\nTen years ago he began experiencing heart problems and collapsed on the squash or racqetball court and was revived Recently he had been having more cardiac trouble and had passed out at the wheel of his car and struck several vehicles. Clearly things were not right and he eventually succumbed to heart disease.\n\nChristchurch, NZ 880 with our friend John Bork in the AAU top January, 1962\n\nBy 1964, his two Olympic wins were no surprise to anyone. The only question was who would be second in the two races. Interestingly Bob Schul ran just as fast his last 200 meters in his 5000 to win that event and on a wet, soggy track. Add those three races to Billy Mills' wonderful win in the 10,000 and and Abebe Bikila's 2nd marathon victory, and 1964 became one of the greatest Olympics distance shows of all time.\n\nSee our earlier issue on that mile record race in Wanganui, NZ and a follow up article with an exclusive conversation with Peter.\n\nMile Record at Wanganui\n\nA Brief Conversation With Peter Snell in 2012\n\nWe’ve recently reported on the racing in New Zealand when Peter Snell set records in the mile, 880, 800, and then went to Los Angeles and set the indoor 1000 yards record and 880 yards as well during that race. Ernie Cunliffe put us in touch with Peter, and I sent him a few questions about the race at Wanganui, and he graciously responded.\n\nMy questions centered around the effort of running on a short (less than quarter mile ) track, grass surface, what his expectations were going into the race, and what Arthur Lydiard’s role was in that week when the races occurred. I also asked Peter about getting into his chosen profession of exercise physiology. I enquired if he knew one of my former colleagues in the field, John Ivy, who also works in Texas. Below are the replies that Peter Snell sent.\n\nWednesday May 16, 2012\n\nGeorge,\n\nErnie forwarded the piece on Wanganui written by Roy (Mason) and quite frankly he has it all in a nutshell. I’m not sure there is much I can add except my thought processes leading up to and during the race. For example based on the New Years Day run mentioned by Roy, which was done 3 weeks after racing a marathon and during volume intervals in conjunction with long runs, I felt that 3.57 was conservatively realistic – in keeping with my preference for not raising expectations too high publicly.\n\nPerhaps you can give me some guidance.\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter\n\nGeorge,\n\nThe above draft was written last week and I lost a large chunk of the text when my application crashed. I was too bummed to try and do it over again.\n\nI had seen very little of Arthur that summer so all he had to go on were race performances, including the marathon, leading up to the Wanganui event. He may have been aware of my New Year’s day race and put 2 & 2 together, as did I. He was present at Wanganui but I did not see him until after the race when news people found him and brought him over for a photo attached if I can find it) His contribution was to publicly predict I would do 3:55 thus adding unwelcome pressure but it certainly filled the stadium. The non-standard track was not a problem as many of the club tracks on which I did my training were 5 laps to the mile grass.\n\nI preferred firm closely mowed well-rolled grass to loose cinders such as at Tokyo and Rome. Californian clay tracks were the best and I hated the bitumen track at San Diego. Too bad today’s rubberized tracks weren’t developed.\n\nYes I know John Ivy very well. My path to becoming an exercise physiologist started in 1974 when I enrolled as a freshman at UC Davis to educate myself out of an unsatisfying Sports PR job with a tobacco company. Thanks to an invitation to Superstars late 1976, I made enough money to stay on after graduating in 1977 and spend 4 years at Washington State to with Dave Costill’s colleague Phil Gollnick.\n\nThanks for the Jazy photo. I notice Michael Bernard in the photo. Jazy must have thought the 5000 was the easier race to win.\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter\n\nWednesday June 6, 2012\n\nGeorge I just saw your photo of Ron Delany and find it interesting to see how well the 1960’s runners are aging. With this in mind I’m attaching a photo of me, Jim Bailey (1st sub-4 on American soil, 1956) and Dave Wottle.

Smith was a Texas Longhorn football player and track sprinter in the late 1940s and early 1950s and one of the fastest men in the US and the planet at that time. He made the US team in 1952 with Lindy Remigino and finished a close fourth in the 100 meters, then came back in the 4x100 meters and earned a gold medal. Smith had grown up on a ranch in Texas and had a lot of the skills of a cowboy which would serve him well for the rest of his life. He had a friend in Hollywood and turned up there after the Olympics and got a job as a stuntman.

In distance running at the highest level, the traditional metrics are honors won, meeting performances and world rankings. Richard Amery offers another test: runners who set world records at both five thousand and ten thousand meters. They live in a high-end zip code.\n\nOnly ten men in the last 107 years have set world records at both distances. Since the the IAAF (now World Athletics) began recognizing records in each event in 1912, the shorter race has seen 35 record performances, the longer, 37 marks.\n\nIn his splendid new book, The Five and Ten Men: Ten Men Who Redefined Distance Running, Amery brings this group to life through an expansive recounting of their careers. It's a valuable book for the nostalgic fan, as well as the novice who wants to learn more about the sport's rich history.\n\nEmil Zatopek\n\nAmery says in the book's introduction, \"I've always been interested in distance running. Not because of any great ability on my part. My only ever-decent run was somewhat tainted. I won the South Australian State marathon but was soon disqualified (later reinstated) for wearing the wrong colored shorts!\n\nThe book's subjects choose themselves. Of the many record holders over these classic distances, there have only ever been ten who held both records. Were it to be a book on the ten greatest distance runners, the list would probably not be much different.\"\n\nPaavo Nurmi, the first to hold both records\n\nTaisto Maki, first to break 30:00\n\nAmery understands that comparing sporting performances over different eras is difficult. \"Distance running, in line with most other sports, has undergone great changes in the last eighty years or so in the period during which the individuals covered in this book competed.\"\n\nKenenisa Bekele the latest to hold both records\n\nMeticulously researched and reported, The Five and Ten Men (2019, 302 pages, Book Depository and Amazon) presents such familiar names as Nurmi, Zatopek, Gebrselassie, and Bekele. Kuts, Clarke, Viren, and Rono are also among the dual record holders. Mostly forgotten today Taisto Maki and Sandor Iharos. Geb leads the five-and-ten set with seven world records. Next are Zatopek and Clarke with six each. Bekele currently holds both, the first set in 2004, the other a year later.\n\nHaile Gebrselassie\n\nLasse Viren\n\nSome historically boldface names were never able to set both records. Among them: Gunder Hagg, Said Aouita, Paul Tergat, Mo Farah, and Eliud Kipchoge.\n\nOr the more obscure distance doublers, Maki and Iharos each suffered greatly because of the chaotic political events affecting the world, before and after the Second World War.\n\nTaisto Maki was the first to break thirty minutes for 10,000 meters. The Finnish distance runner set two world records at that distance, taking ten seconds off his own mark, with 29:52.6.\n\nSandor Iharos and Lazlo Tabori\n\nSandor Iharos was a key member of the highly successful Hungarian trio coached by Mihaly Igloi (Istvan Rozavolgyi, Lazlo Tabori, his compatriots). He broke the five thousand twice, the second race reclaiming the honor from Kuts. Iharos was also one of only two athletes (the other, Nurmi) to hold world records over 1500, 5000, and 10,000 meters. Amery ably describes the Hungarian revolution enveloping Iharos and others as the country struggled with Russian aggression.\n\nHenry Rono\n\nRon Clarke\n\nOne of the distance legends covered in The Five and Ten Men is Australian Ron Clarke, successful from the fifteen hundred to the marathon. He was the first to run three miles in less than thirteen minutes. Four days later he was the first to run ten thousand in less than twenty-eight-minutes.\n\n\"Clarkey\" was a familiar face on the starting line. During a 44-day European tour in 1965 he competed 18 times and broke twelve world records including he 20,000 meters and the one-hour run.\n\nFor Clarke, his record suffered from never having won Oympic gold, notwithstanding a career few exceeded. Those who saw it in person and those who find it on You Tube, remember Billy Mills' desperate charge in the home stretch of the 1964 Olympic ten thousand, and Clarke's stricken face as the American crosses the finish line several meters ahead to win gold. His bronze was to be his only Olympic medal; Zatopek gave him one of the Czech's own golds as a gift.\n\nVladmir Kuts leading Gordon Pirie\n\nEnriching the stories that Amery tells are thirty-nine photos of the ten in action, many of them this writer had not seen. The book's cover shows Russian Vladimir Kuts winning the Olympic five thousand at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.\n\nAuthor, Richard Amery\n\nA retired high school physical education teacher, Amery and his wife, Christine, live in the Adelaide hills of Australia. (Ed. note. The Adelaide hills are currently in the middle of severe forest fires at the time of this writing.) In his early years he was an accomplished runner. \"Now, on my morning runs with my border collie, I normally see no one, just the wildlife, mainly kangaroos.\"\n\n\"I've always had an interest in both history and distance running, and I hope this book is some demonstration of that interest. I've tried to tell stories that I think are worth telling, but in many cases have either been forgotten or never really told in the first place.\"\n\nIn an epilogue, the author traces the decline of performances at these distances to the growth of road\n\nracing, especially the big city marathons and their munificent financial rewards. Adding to the\n\ndeterioration are the lack of competitive opportunities stemming from the excision of longer races at\n\ninternational meets. We're approaching Seb Coe's ninety-minute plan.\n\n\"The only certainty is that the 5,000m and 10,000m records (as of August 2019) will be broken,\"\n\nAmery writes. \"Despite the longevity of the present records, sooner or laterthere will be others who\n\ncome along with the necessary physical and mental requisites to run better times. I will not be easy.\n\nThe last three record holders in both distances have been exceptional talents living in almost ideal\n\nenvironments from a distance running viewpoint, in addition to undertaking excellent (and hard)\n\ntraining. But broken they will be. Noting is more certain.\"\n\nA world record is like a Patek Philippe watch. You never actually own one. You merely look after it\n\nfor the next generation.\n\nCurrent titleholder, Kenenisa Bekele: 12:37.35 and 26:17.53.\n\n----------\n\nPaul O'Shea is a lifelong participant in the track and field world.

R..I.P.\n\nI never knew Phil Henson, but he was on our list of subscribers of this blog. We were recommended to him by best friend, Bill Schnier, U. of Cincinnati Track Coach. One of the highlights of Phil's career was serving as meet manager for Track and Field at the Atlanta Olympics.\n\nBill wrote these words about his friend.\n\nI just heard about the passing of Phil Henson but I don't know any details. Not only was Phil an extremely knowledgeable coach of T&F, especially the field events, but he was also a very good friend whose career in our sport mirrored mine in many respects. He preceded me as Sam Bell's grad assistant at IU and paved the way for me to eventually take his place when he became an assistant coach at the University of Wisconsin. When I left IU to take the head coaching job at the University of Cincinnati, Phil returned to IU to teach biomechanics and human performance, at the same time volunteering as an assistant to Sam Bell. He often told the correct story how we traded off living in the same apartment building at 571 Evermann Apts. at IU for 11 years; Phil and Jane for 5 years, then Kathy and me for 4 years, then Phil and Jane again for 2 more years. We were at the same university, had the same graduate school major, had the same job, and even lived in the same apartment. Following the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Kathy and I continued our honeymoon by going back to Central Connecticut University to stay with Phil and Jane for two days. Over the years we did many things together in large part due to our parallel lives. Jane died of cancer about 6 years ago and the last time I saw Phil was on a trip we took a few years ago to the Cass Scenic Railroad in Cass, WV. Phil loved trains and tractors, owning two tractors which he stored at his home in Bloomington.\n\nPhil was a wizard in his knowledge of field events. In addition he was equally skilled at organization, serving as the meet manager for T&F at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. His career path leaned more toward teaching whereas mine was in coaching, yet we still had so much in common. When the Big East T&F meet was held in Cincinnati, he served as the head referee. He was so well regarded that there were no protests during those three days in a conference which was extremely contentious. He made things go smoothly.\n\nFor the past 15 years or so Phil suffered from MS, causing an increasingly pronounced limp which I suspect was the eventual cause of his death. Nevertheless, he still lived a normal life, soldiering on in the best way possible. He was an extremely loyal person, serving Sam and Fran Bell, along with Brian and Brenda Lewis, as Sam and Fran aged.\n\nAs we age we lose more and more people with whom we share so many experiences of long duration. Two days ago I was informed of the death of Darrell Dailey, a person with whom I played every sport in grade school and high school for thousands of hours. Let's all remember our long-time friends and value what they have given us over the years.\n\nThe following came from the IU Sports Information Desk\n\nBloomington, Ind. – Former IU Track and Field Assistant Coach Phil Henson died on Saturday in Bloomington. He was 74 years old. Henson was a long-time assistant coach for the Hoosier program, working alongside legendary head coach Sam Bell from 1980-94. Henson played an integral role on Bell's staff during one of the Hoosier track and field program's most successful periods. He worked closely with numerous Hoosier NCAA champions, All-Americans and Olympians, including DeDee Nathan, Dave Volz and Alan Turner.\n\nIn addition to his work with IU Track and Field, he also served the sport in a variety of capacities both nationally and internationally. The highlight of his involvement on the international scene came in 1996, when he served as Director of Competition for Track and Field at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nIn addition to those roles, Henson was also a valued member of the Indiana University faculty. Henson, who earned both his Master's and Ph.D. from Indiana University, joined the IU Department of Kinesiology faculty in 1980, serving in a part-time capacity until his retirement from coaching. Upon the completion of his 1996 Olympic responsibilities, he became a full-time assistant professor until his retirement in 2013.\n\n\"Phil wore many hats at IU, all the way from full-time coach to professor, and most recently as a volunteer coach working with Coach Jake Wiseman and his multi-athletes,\" said IU Track and Field Coach Ron Helmer. \"Phil's knowledge of track and field was boundless, making him a highly sought after meet referee and official, including his work at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. Beyond that, Phil was just a good man who truly loved what he did. The track and field community lost a good one.\"\n\n↧\n\nV 10 N. 2 Mike Lindsay, Scottish Olympian, Oklahoma Sooner R.I.P. And Buddy Stewart 1000 Yard Man\n\nMike Lindsay, Scotland Discus Thrower and Shot Putter\n\nMike Lindsay, an outstanding shot and discus thrower at the University of Oklahoma class of 1960 passed away recently (December 11, 2019). He was 81 years old. Mike was from Glasgow, Scotland and had represented Great Britain in Rome and Tokyo in 1960 and 64. But he represented Scotland at several Empire and Commonwealth Games. He was fifth at Rome behind the three Americans Bill Neider, Dallas Long and Parry O'Brien, and the Russian Viktor Lipsnis. At the time Mike was throwing 58 feet, but he was used to being around the American trio and was not intimidated by their 60' throws. He threw his steady 58 feet and placed high.\n\nChris and Mike Lindsay at Great Britain B match against Norway.\n\nChris was a 400 meter man.\n\nI came to the Unversity a year later and got to know Mike a bit as he worked in Jefferson House for the year after he graduated. He was an incredibly intelligent man. He could breeze through his engineering texts prepping for a test and be carrying on a full blown conversation with several people. Initially that wasn't easy, because no one could understand him with his Scottish burr, and he couldn't get the Okie drawl. Eventually both he and the Sooners caught on.\n\nArthur Rowe and Mike Lindsay\n\nAs you will see in some of the following obits, he went home, earned a Phd. and became head of the sports science department at Leeds University, one of the top physical education and sports science departments in England.\n\nWhen Mike arrived at Norman, Oklahoma, he asked, \"Where is the weight room?\" People replied, \"What's that?\" Mike got them started with a weight program. At that time football was king as it is today, but there was no weight training program. The weight room was 'created' under the grandstand in a small unheated space, with a dirt floor. There was one bench, one barbell and a set of plates and a couple of dumbells, and I'm not referring to the pole vaulters. Oh yes, there was also a spittoon for Dan Erwin another all American shot putter. The note in the obit below that Mike benefitted from good facilities and coaching at the university was not quite true. He was his own coach and he introduced the concept of strength training to the university. At that time the only books one could find on weight training were published in England.\n\nIt is noted in sme of Mike's obits that he was never accused of doping in all his career. I remember though his mother used to send him protein supplements from health food stores in Scotland. He was always adding that powder to his milk in the dining hall.\n\nHe held the Scottish records in the discus and shot for 15 years. When he practiced the discus in the 180 range and we were running track work outs we always had to watch out of the corner of our eye when he was throwing, because the discus often skidded across the track. More than one runner has had a career ending injury from an errant discus. One of Igloi's top runners had that fate with the L.A. Track Club.\n\nI never saw this but I heard that Mike used to like to tease some of the track guys by stuffing them in the trash cans in the hall way. The only guy he couldn't do that to was 6'4\" decathlete and pole vaulter J.D. Martin. He also met his match in a wrestling contest with Tommy Evans the assistant wrestling coach and a 152 pound Olympic sivler medalist. Tommy pinned Mike in a matter of seconds.\n\nOn the track, Mike was the fastest guy out of the blocks on the team including the sprinters, and he could high jump 6. 0\".\n\nOne of the funniest stories about Mike was when he and Claude Hammond, another thrower were riding double on a bicycle (imagine 450 pounds of people on a bike) one of them on the handlebars. They came barreling around one corner of the football stadium and had a head on crash with another cyclist who weighed all of 130 pounds. It should have been no contest, but Hammond dislocated his finger, and when Mike saw it, he threw up and fainted. The little 130 pounder was standing over both of them trying to console Hammond. We laughed for days about that.\n\nI had been trying for several years to track down Mike and was not successful. I wish I had, and could have heard that great Scottish accent one more time.\n\nAnother member of that Sooner team also passed away recently. Buddy Stewart from Woodward, Oklahoma. Buddy was in the same year as Mike. He taught me some good life lessons as a rookie. As a runner he fit in between the mile and half mile. The 1000 yards was made for him and he did very well at that distance. When I saw him last time he told me he had married a woman who had saved his life when he was drowning in a swimming pool. He had come in from a training run and jumped in the pool to cool off and cramped up, and she was able to save him. Buddy's career wasn't as stellar as Mike Lindsay's but he was one of those people who still teaches you things that you carry along through life. I miss them both.\n\nGeorge\n\nBuddy Stewart winning the 1000 at Indiana U. Kentucky tri meet at Bloomington.\n\nHere is the Obituary on Mike from The Scotsman, by Jack Davidson\n\nMike Lindsay, athlete. Born: 2 November 1938. Died: 11 December 2019, aged 81\n\nMike Lindsay, who has died aged 81, was arguably Scotland’s greatest ever shot putter and discus thrower, raising standards in both events to unprecedented levels while winning a stack of honours domestically and internationally. A multiple British and Scottish champion and international on more than 35 occasions in the course of a long career, his high point came when, aged only 21, he secured 5th place in the shot at the 1960 Rome Olympic Games. This was the highest place ever achieved in the event by a British athlete and was subsequently never bettered, albeit equalled once, by Geoff Capes at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.\n\nAt the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, he secured silver medals for Scotland in both shot and discus, in the former missing gold by a mere 4cms. A year later he became the first Scot to breach the 60ft barrier in the shot, a feat as significant athletically as the four-minute mile, while at the World Student Games in Brazil he collected another two silver medals in his speciality events. Being one of the first British athletes to gain a sports scholarship to the USA, to Oklahoma University in the late 1950s, undoubtedly enhanced his development into a world class thrower. Once retired from competition in 1971, he enjoyed an accomplished career in the field of physical education and academia, becoming very involved in the development of the study of bio mechanics.\n\nMichael Robert Lindsay was born in Glasgow, the younger son of Archie and Lucy, at a time when his father was stationed locally in the army. Elder brother Chris was also a noted athlete who represented Great Britain ‘B’ at 440 yards. Because of family connections they soon moved to Coldstream, where Mike attended the local primary school. When Mike was 11 the family moved to London because his father had secured employment with Royal Mail and he attended St Marleybone Grammar School, where his sporting potential was first noted. A talented all-rounder, he shone at rugby, cricket and athletics, initially competing in jumping events. As he developed physically and started weight training, his coach Doug Mannion switched him to throwing events, at which he showed promise.\n\nIt proved a wise decision as Mike achieved prodigiously as a junior athlete winning the AAA (British) titles at shot and discus in both 1956 and ’57, in the latter year also claiming the senior AAA title at discus while still a junior. He also set a world junior best in the event with a throw over 193ft, beating the previous best by 10ft by the iconic Al Oerter, later multiple Olympic champion.\n\nIn 1957, aged 18, he set his first of many Scottish records in the shot at Edinburgh Highland Games, obliterating the previous one by 6ft, represented Scotland in his first international against Ireland in Dublin winning both shot and discus and gained his first British international vest against France. The following year, in Cardiff, he made the first of four appearances for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games, finishing a creditable 4th and 6th at discus and shot respectively, and in 1959 repeated his AAA discus success while runner up in the shot.\n\nOklahoma University, duly impressed, offered Mike a sports scholarship and he rewarded their faith by setting a British discus record within a year. Access to top level coaching and facilities while competing against throwers of the calibre of Olympic champions Parry O’Brien and Al Oerter edged him towards world class as he made his mark at the Rome Olympics.\n\nAfter graduating in mechanical engineering in 1962 he returned to continue competing successfully for virtually the next decade under coach Ron Pickering. He added an AAA title in the shot to his CV, won the event for Britain in the 1963 contest against the USA, beating future Olympic champion Randy Matson, competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and made further Commonwealth Games appearances in Perth, Kingston and Edinburgh.\n\nBy the time of Mike’s final international match in 1971, for Scotland against the Home Nations, he had topped the Scottish ranking lists at shot and discus for 15 years consecutively, an unparalleled dominance. Throughout his career he remained steadfastly drug free at a time when drug misuse had infiltrated the sport.\n\nAfter Perth 1962 he remained there for six months, teaching at the Scotch College, and on his return undertook a post graduate teaching qualification at Carnegie PE College in Leeds before studying for a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds when the significance of the application of Biomechanics to sport was being recognised. There followed lectureships in Biomechanics at Madeley College, Staffordshire, Dunfermline PE College, Edinburgh and a PhD in Bio Engineering at Strathclyde University. In 1979 he was appointed Director of PE at University of Leeds, where he remained until retiring in 2004, making a major contribution to the development of sports science degrees.\n\nEminent coach Frank Dick said: “Mike brought greater understanding to the application of Biomechanics to sport and developing athletes. He was also a true gentleman who hid his light under a bushel.”\n\nIn 1972 Mike married Vivienne Greener, a teacher and lecturer whom he had met in Leeds and the couple went on to enjoy 47 years together, latterly living in Harrogate.\n\n↧\n\nV 10 N. 3 Race Across America Eddie Gardner and the Bunion Derbies book review\n\nRace across America\n\nEddie Gardner and the Great Bunion Derbies\n\nBy Charles B. Kastner (Seychelles 1980-82)\n\nSyracuse University Press\n\nDecember 2019\n\n319 pages\n\nHardcover - $75.00\n\nPaper – $29.95\n\nReviewed by Thomas E. Coyne\n\nThis is a book worth reading! And well-illustrated, besides!\n\nActually, it is three books in one, drawing on Charles Kastner’s previous histories\n\nof the, now largely forgotten, 1928 and 1929 C. C. Pyle’s International-Trans-\n\nContinental Foot Races. The two races are covered but this is, equally, a focused look\n\nat race relations in the United States in the 1920’s and the efforts of African Americans\n\nto achieve full integration into white America.\n\nAuthor Kastner uses the story of Edward “Eddie” Gardner to tell his tale. Gardner,\n\nborn in Alabama, was a respected African American distance runner in the greater\n\nSeattle, Washington community. In 1928 he participated in the trans-continental race\n\nplanned by the Route 66 Highway Association to draw attention to the nation’s best-known\n\nnational highway. The Association contracted with C. C. Pyle to conduct the event.\n\nPyle succeeded, displaying a flair for attention and ballyhoo plus a level of incompetence\n\nand callousness that, in retrospect, makes one marvel even more at the tenacity of the\n\nrunners who completed, not one, but two such races.\n\nMoney, not glory, was the motivation for these runners. They were international distance\n\nrunning stars and poor, but athletic, working class Americans. The latter, with the same\n\ndesire as countless other Americans, generations before them, who had walked East to\n\nWest next to their covered wagons in pursuit of a better life for their families.\n\nPyle offered his competitors a shot at $25, 000 for the winner with $10, 000, $5,000 and\n\n$2,500 for second, third and fourth. Finishers five through ten would win $1,000. In 1928,\n\nthis was life changing money for the average person. To seek it, one hundred ninety-nine\n\nstarters toed the line on March 4, 1928 in Los Angeles and, after running 3,422.3 miles,\n\nfifty-five crossed a finish line on May 26 in New York City.\n\nA year later, reality had set in. Seventy-seven contestants, including forty-three repeaters\n\nfrom the first race, started on March 31st in New York City and, running a different route\n\nof 3,553.6 miles, nineteen finished on June 16th in Los Angeles.\n\nA major difference; the runners in the 1928 race received their prize money. The finishers\n\nin the 1929 run received worthless promissory notes and never collected.\n\nIn his two previous books the author focused on the races with some attention given to\n\nefforts by the African American runners to show their fellow white citizens they could\n\ncompete as well as white athletes as distance runners. In this writing, Kastner shines his\n\nlight on Gardner who finished in eighth place in the 1928 race. In 1929 he was the sole\n\nAfrican American to return for the second running and led the run in its early stages but\n\nsuccumbed to injury and fatigue and dropped out after 1,536.60 miles.\n\nEddie Gardner clearly wanted to successfully represent his race and African American\n\nnewspapers were the primary sources of information about that effort. Yet, there is no\n\ndoubt he also had the same motivation as the white runners. Finishing in the top money\n\nmeant a better life for him and his family.\n\nGardner, however, had to face the Jim Crow South as well as racial prejudice in other\n\nstates on his journeys and Kastner’s recounting presents a sobering look at race history\n\nin the United States. To the credit of his fellow competitors, Gardner was treated as a\n\nrespected comrade runner who shared the same miserable treatment C. C. Pyle gave\n\neverybody.\n\nKastner deserves accolades for the years of research that have gone into his three books\n\nabout C. C. Pyle’s Bunion Derbies. This account gives graphic descriptions of men who\n\nran through rugged terrain and terrible weather conditions at paces per mile that would\n\nbe respectable in modern day marathons and ultra-marathons.\n\nWhile the author does not comment on the hundreds of subsequent runs across America,\n\nhe should take pleasure in knowing that the spirit of the bunioneers lives on. Since Andy\n\nPayne’s 1928 run of 3,422.3 miles in 84 days the cross-continent record has now dropped\n\nto Pete Kostelnick’s 2016 run of 3100 miles in 42 days-six hours-30 minutes.\n\nRead the book! The will power of these runners will impress you.\n\nThomas E. Coyne has been a runner since 1947. In all that time he never once\n\nfelt the urge to run one step more than the 26.2 mile marathon distance.\n\nEd. Note: Some of you may recall that Thom Coyne also reviewed the first two books\n\nof this trilogy. The link to that review is: Vol 4 N. 3 April 29, 2014\n\nThis review was originally done for a blog by Thom Coyne's brother John Coyne for returned Peace Corps Volunteers.
