        "text": "You can make the argument that soccer players serve their countries every match by inspiring the hopes of their countrymen and women.\n\nIn times of war, a number of soccer players immortalized in and forgotten by the tides of time have served their countries in a very different way—as members of the armed forces.\n\nHere is a list of 50 of the many who did so.\n\nAs you scroll through these names, you’ll notice that the players listed are primarily British. There are a few reasons for this.\n\nFirst, the fascist powers during the Second World War—namely Germany, Italy and Spain—kept their leagues running during the conflict, while Britain shipped most of its players off, reserving only the biggest stars for friendly matches.\n\nSecondly, very little information exists in English on players from a number of countries that suffered through conflicts, particularly from the days before football was international entertainment. Research on the topic proves very difficult.\n\nIf you know of any players from non-English speaking countries not included, please list them in the comments section.\n\nA number of players listed served in the Footballers' Battalion during World War I.\n\nWilliam Joynson Hicks, a British political figure, created the Footballer Battalion because he felt it unjust that good British lads went off to war while athletes got to hang around at home playing games.\n\nEarly on in the war, a Parliamentary Recruiting Committee visited Upton Park, asking players and attendees at half time to sign up for the war effort. A number did, seriously increasing the ranks for the Football Battalion.\n\nScotsman Willie Thornton scored 138 goals in 219 performances for the Rangers between 1936 and 1954. He is one of Scottish football’s all-time top scorers.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Thornton managed Dundee and Patrick Thistle, and served as caretaker for the Rangers for one year.\n\nIn addition to his long-lasting career in Scottish football, Thornton served in the Scottish Horse regiment of the British Territorial Army during World War II.\n\nWillie won the Millitary Medal, which was awarded for “acts of gallantry and devotion to duty under fire.”\n\nGoalkeeper Bert Trautmann put in 508 performances for Manchester City between 1949 and 1964.\n\nTrautmann joined the Luftwaffe at the outbreak for World War II and served on both the eastern and western fronts. He was one of only 90 men from his 1000-strong unit to survive before being captured by the British.\n\nDuring the course of the war, Trautmann was awarded five medals by the Nazis, including an Iron Cross. After the war, Trautmann took up farming in Great Britain while playing football at the local level, before being conscripted by City.\n\nHe won FWA Footballer of the Year for 1956, in which year he put in a legendary performance for the FA Cup final.\n\nRight back Tom Cooper played professional soccer for 16 years at such clubs as Port Vale, Derby County and Liverpool.\n\nIn his last professional match, at Stamford Bridge in 1940, Cooper helped the Reds defeat the Blues 1-0. Later that year, Cooper joined the Royal Military Police to help in the war effort.\n\nIn June of 1940, Cooper was ridding a dispatch motorcycle, ferrying messages for the war effort, when he collided with a lorry and died. His death resulted in the British government demanding that all dispatch riders wear helmets.\n\nHarry Goslin scored 23 goals in 306 matches as a defender for the Bolton Wanderers during the 1930s. He signed for a fee of £25.\n\nDuring a match on 8 April 1939, Goslin told the assembled supporters that the entire team would enlist immediately after the match. They kept their promise, and became well known for their efforts.\n\nGoslin was promoted to sergeant and served an important role during troop withdrawal at Dunkirk. In 1942, Goslin and the rest of the Wanderers served in Egypt and made their way through the Middle East, where they played a friendly match against members of the Polish army.\n\nHarry died in December of 1943 in a mortar explosion.\n\nHerbie Roberts won four First Division titles in 11 years at Arsenal. Upon retiring in 1937, he took up the job of training the Gunners’ second team.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Roberts enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers infantry regiment, serving as a lieutenant. He died at the age of 39 of erysipelas, a skin disease that induces fevers, shaking, chills, fatigue, headaches and vomiting.\n\nRoberts was one of nine Arsenal players to die during WWII.\n\nThe story of German soldier Fritz Walter is so outlandish it seems more myth than reality.\n\nWalter was conscripted by the Nazis and ended up fighting the Soviets on the eastern front. He was captured toward the end of the war and destined for shipment to Siberian work camps, where prisoners were expected to live no longer than five years.\n\nWhile at a holding camp for prisoners of war, Walter caught a stray ball from a friendly game of football between guards and so dazzled them with his skill that he was quickly playing exhibition matches set up amongst the prisoners to show off his ability.\n\nSome say that he even coached teams and organized leagues in the detainment center, though how much of that is myth is hard to know.\n\nWhen time came for the prisoners to board the train for the Gulag, a guard spoke up on Walter's behalf. The soldier managed to convince his superiors that Walter was in fact Austrian, not German, and that he didn't deserve the punishment.\n\nWalter went on to captain the West German national side in the ’54 World Cup.\n\nScottish soccer player Norman Corbett had a long sporting career.\n\nIt began in his school years, when young Corbett captained his Falkirk side to the Scottish Schools Trophy. He played for Scottish Boys and Scotland Junior before signing with Hearts at age 15.\n\nCorbett made 166 performances with West Ham between 1937 and 1950, though he missed a few years during World War II, during which time he served with the Essex Regiment.\n\nCorbett was on the Hammers team that won the War Cup in 1940.\n\nAnother Scotsman, inside right Archie Macaulay made 83 performances with West Ham and 103 for Arsenal.\n\nA Falkirk native, Macaulay began playing for Rangers at 18 and went on to manage West Bromwich Albion, among other teams.\n\nBecause of Macaulay’s prominence as a player, he was allowed to stay in Britain during the war and play throughout the conflict, though he served the war effort at home through the Essex Regiment.\n\nWilf Mannion’s shock of blond hair earned him the nickname “Golden Boy.”\n\nThe Golden Boy put in nearly 350 appearances with Middlesbrough as an inside forward, and earned 26 national caps. He scored 111 goals in his career.\n\nIn 1940, Mannion went to France with the British army to take part in a massive offensive designed to stop the progressive of Germany’s Western Offensive.\n\nIn 1943, he took part in the siege of Sicily, during which time his captain was England international cricketer Hedley Verity.\n\nWater Hull became only the second black man to play top-flight football in the UK when he first took the pitch at Tottenham Hotspur in 1909.\n\nAfter playing in 120 matches at Tottenham and Northampton Town, Tull enlisted in the Footballers’ Battalion. Despite British law explicitly stating those of African or mixed racial heritage could not serve as miitary officers, Tull assumed the rank of second lieutenant.\n\nThe soccer pioneer was killed in action in 1918 during the Spring Offensive. He was posthumously awarded the Military Cross.\n\nVivian Woodward was one of the greats of the early days of organized English soccer. As a center forward, he scored 93 goals in 238 appearances for Tottenham and Chelsea.\n\nAt the international level, Woodward captained Great Britain (not England, mind you) to gold medals in the 1908 and 1912 Olympic games. As a member of England Amateurs, Woodward scored eight goals in a brutal 15-0 routing of an amateur squad from France.\n\nDuring World War I, Woodward served in the 17th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, a Footballers' Battalion. He fought on the western front, reached the rank of captain and was injured in battle in 1916 when a hand grenade blew up near his leg.\n\nMajor Frank Buckley played professional soccer for 18 years on and off, including stints at Aston Villa, Manchester United and Manchester City.\n\nBuckley was the first soccer player to join the Footballers' Battalion. Because he had served in the military previous to his football career, Buckley was automatically awarded the rank of lieutenant and quickly worked his way to major.\n\nMajor Buckley was sent back to Britain in 1917 when a gas attack badly damaged his lungs. Rumor has it he cared so passionately for the men in his charge that he paid for the education of the three sons of a man who was killed by a sniper.\n\nAfter the War, Buckley continued his soccer career and went on to manage Wolverhampton, Hull City and other teams after retiring as a player.\n\nScottish striker Richard McFadden was Clapton Orient’s top scorer for four seasons, from 1911 to 1915.\n\nIn his first season with the club, McFadden broke the team’s single-season scoring record, only to break his own record in his last season at Clapton Orient.\n\nThe footballer served as Company Sergeant Major Richard McFadden in World War I, and gave his life during the Battle of the Somme, but not before writing a long letter to the club eulogizing fellow Clapton Orient player Willie Jonas, who died not long before McFadden.\n\nHow many Scottish soccer players served in World War I? Well, a lot.\n\nWilliam Angus won the Victoria Cross for his service in the War, the most prestigious award for gallantry meted by the British crown.\n\nAngus won the Cross for leaving a trench during heavy bombing and gunfire to rescue a wounded soldier, receiving 40 wounds in the process. The footballer lost part of his foot and his left eye, but saved the life of the other soldier.\n\nPrevious to the War, Angus played for Carluke Rovers, Celtic and Wisham Athletic in the Scottish league.\n\nDonald Bell won the Victoria Cross for gallantry on account of his actions in the Battle of Somme.\n\nAccording to the official report of his actions in the London Gazette, “2nd Lt. Bell immediately, and on his own initiative, crept up a communication trench and then…rushed across the open under very heavy fire and attacked the machine gun, shooting the firer with his revolver, and destroying gun and personnel with bombs.”\n\nBell was a professional teacher and amateur soccer player before the war at both Crystal Palace and Newcastle United. He died in battle July 10, 1916 at age 25.\n\nInside forward Eddie Latheron helped Blackburn Rovers win the Football League title in 1912 and 1914.\n\nLatheron joined the team as a teenager and went on to set their single-season goal record. He scored a total of 94 goals in his 11 years with the club, at a rate of one goal per every 2.75 games.\n\nEddie served on the Front during World War I with the Royal Field Artillery as a gunner. He passed away at the age of 29 in the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nJimmy Speirs scored once for Scotland at the international level and racked up a total of 92 career goals at club level with teams like Rangers, Clyde and Leeds City.\n\nSpeirs enlisted in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders at the start of World War I, despite being officially exempted for having two young children.\n\nThe Scotsman won a Military Medal for bravery in May 1917, which earned him leave in Scotland during the summer of that year. He died in action the following fall.\n\nStriker Sandy Turnbull played professional soccer for Manchester United and Manchester City in the early years of the 20th century.\n\nThe gifted forward scored a total of 143 goals in 230 Football League performances, including the winning goal against Bristol City in the 1909 FA Cup final. Turnbull won the FA Cup with both Manchester sides and won the league twice with United.\n\nThe Scottish striker enlisted in 1915, after having been banned from the Football League for being found guilty of match-fixing. Turnbull died in battle at Arras on May 3, 1917. He was posthumously reinstated to the League for his efforts during the war.\n\nWilliam Gerrish, affectionately known as Billy to his teammates, played for both Aston Villa and Preston North End in the years leading up to the First World War.\n\nGerrish scored on his debut against Arsenal and notched a hat trick against Chelsea a few weeks later. In his first season, Billy helped Villa win the first division Football League title.\n\nGerrish enlisted in the Footballers' Battalion Middlesex Regiment and died in battle at the western front on August 8, 1916.\n\nFerenc Puskás, one of the great footballers of all time, never actually went to war, but the unique nature of the team he played on bears mentioning in this article.\n\nPuskás, along with his teammates, formed one of the great national teams of all time: the Mighty Magyars. In 85 matches with the Magyars, Puskás scored 84 goals. The team went undefeated for 32 games.\n\nAll told, Puskás scored 616 goals in 620 matches.\n\nHere’s where the military connection comes in. The club team Puskás played for was absorbed into the Hungarian army team in 1949. All of the team’s players were given military rank and status.\n\nPuskás eventually achieved the rank of major, even though he never actually served with the military. This, coupled with his lopsided gait, is how he earned his nickname: the Galloping Major.\n\nEngland international and professional writer Charlie Buchan scored 209 goals in 370 appearances with Sunderland from 1911 – 1925, despite his tenure with the club being interrupted with wartime service.\n\nIn 1915, Buchan enlisted in the Sherwood Foresters. His service earned him the Military Medal and the rank of second lieutenant.\n\nAfter the war, Buchan played professionally until 1928 with both Sunderland and Arsenal. He went on to be a BBC commentator and wrote one of the first soccer coaching manuals.\n\nWelsh goalkeeper Fred Griffiths played professional soccer more than 15 years with clubs such as Blackpool, Millwall, Tottenham, West Ham and Preston North End. He also made two appearances at the international level for Wales.\n\nOne of the more phenomenal aspects of Griffiths’ life is that he joined the military after retiring from football when he was 42, a year too old to be legally conscripted. Griffiths achieved the rank of sergeant and died in battle at the age of 44 in 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nNot to be confused with the noted 14th-century Scottish poet, Englishman John Barbour was a first-team regular at Preston North End along with Fred Griffiths and Charlie Buchan.\n\nAlong with his former teammates, Barbour enlisted and served in the British army during the First World War, and like Griffiths, he lost his life in the war. Barbour died on the western front in April of 1916.\n\nBriton Tom Finney was among the first generation of players to see the benefits of the English youth development system.\n\nAs a youngster from Preston, Finney was brought in to play for an experimental youth development project initiated by Preston North End. He had worked his way from this youth team to top-flight soccer by the age of 17, when the war broke out.\n\nFinney joined the British army and served in North Africa for the duration of the war. He was only 24 when the war ended. Finney rejoined Preston North End 1946 and played until 1960, scoring 187 goals in 433 matches.\n\nLev Yashin, aka The Black Widow, is widely considered the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game.\n\nIn 1941, Yashin served the Soviet war effort as a pre-teen when the Nazis invaded Russia. At the ripe old age of 12, Yashin went to work in a factory in his native Moscow, manufacturing weapons, vehicle parts and other wartime necessities.\n\nWhile working for the factory, Yashin played for its football team, alongside all manner of people too young, too old or too damaged to go to war.\n\nYashin went on to put in 326 performances for FC Dynamo Moscow over a 20-year span and 78 for the Soviet national team.\n\nIn 2011, Simonyan was awarded a medal by the president of Armenia for his efforts to create cross-cultural understanding and empathy between Russians and Armenians.\n\nSimonyan was too young to actually serve as a soldier, but he put in work during the war years for the Soviet effort. As a teenager, Simonyan and his friends organized soccer games in their town.\n\nWhen Soviet troops passed through the area, the striker and his soccer buddies would set up friendly matches for the military personnel. These matches increased camaraderie in units and eased the pressure of serving in war.\n\nThe story of Ukrainian giant Dynamo Kiev under German occupation is a strange and tragic one.\n\nThe Nazi invasion of Eastern Europe upended club football in all the countries that would become part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine included. Dynamo Kiev, one of the great teams in the region, was dismantled and its players forced to work in a bread factory for the German cause.\n\nWhen the German command found out the footballers were working in the bread factory, they decided to bring in a number of top German players to defeat the Ukrainian footballers, raining humiliation on the heads of the natives.\n\nTo the astonishment of the Nazis, the emaciated laborers thrashed the German team 5-3, despite the referee being an SS officer.\n\nTed Drake did the Arsenal faithful proud.\n\nIn his 167 league appearances for the Gunners, Drake scored 124 goals, despite being constantly plagued by injury. Think of him as an old-school Robin van Persie.\n\nAs with many players of his generation, the Second World War seriously impacted Drake’s professional footballing career. Though he played a number of friendly matches with Arsenal during the war, Drake served in the Royal Air Force and missed out on his most important soccer years.\n\nDrake suffered a spinal injury during a match in 1945 that effectively ended his professional career. He went on to manage Hendon, Reading and Chelsea.\n\nEddie Hapgood served England in a number of capacities: as a professional soccer player for Arsenal, as a member of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War and in the pre-war years, as a milkman.\n\nDespite serving in the military during the war, Hapgood managed to play in over 100 friendly matches for Arsenal during the war years, matches designed to keep the morale of the British people intact by proving that a few bombing raids every now and then weren’t enough to stop Big Ben from ticking.\n\nHapgood’s career as a player ended before the war did, and so Eddie made the transition to managing Blackburn Rovers in 1944, apparently while still serving in the RAF. He went on to manage Watford and Bath City.\n\nJack Crayston played right-half at Arsenal alongside Ted Drake and Eddie Hapgood from 1934 to 1943.\n\nLike Drake and Hapgood, Crayston enjoyed about five years of professional football in North London before the Second World War broke out. And also like Hapgood and Drake, Crayston joined the Royal Air Force and managed to play in over 100 friendly matches during the war.\n\nAll of this of course begs the question: Did these guys actually serve in the military, or were they part of a propaganda campaign aimed at getting young lads to join up in the image of their sporting heroes?\n\nThough he never served in war, the story of Matthias Sindelar, the Paper Man, is one intrinsically linked to the Second World War.\n\nSindelar was a member of the Austrian Wunderteam in the 1930s and is widely considered his country’s greatest player. To give you an idea of the Wunderteam’s formidable skills, they beat Germany, France and Hungary with a combined score of 23-2.\n\nKnown also as the Mozart of Football, the Paper Man played in a final exhibition match for Austria against Nazi Germany in 1938. The match was prearranged: It was to end in a draw.\n\nHowever, Sindelar was a good friend to a number of Jews and had no sympathy for the Nazi cause. Sindelar scored in the last 20 minutes of the game, as did teammate Karl Sesta. After each goal, the Paper Man performed mocking celebrations in front of the Nazi high command’s booth.\n\nLess than a year later, Sindelar was found dead in his apparent, a victim of an apparent gas leak. Debate abounds to this day as to whether or not that leak was an accident.\n\nHe began playing soccer as a means of staying fit in the winter. Coaches quickly found that his hand-eye coordination made him a great keeper.\n\nFrank abandoned baseball and played soccer as an amateur while driving a hearse for a funeral home. His skills as an athlete led him to play for the United States in the 1950 and 1954 World Cups.\n\nInterestingly, Borghi, who looks a little bit like Lou Ferrigno, was played by Scotsman Gerard Butler in the film The Game of Their Lives.\n\nJoe Maca played professional soccer in his native Belgium before the Second World War and for the United States national team after the war. As with Borghi, he played on the 1950 World Cup team that defeated England.\n\nPrevious to the war, Maca played for Royal Cercle Sportif La Forestoise, a third-division team in Brussels. During the war, Maca served for the Belgian army and played on the army’s soccer team.\n\nAfter the war, Maca immigrated to the United States. He played for Brooklyn Hispano in the American Soccer League. After the World Cup in 1950, Maca returned to Belgium, played for Royal White Star Athletic Club for one year and moved back to the United States for good.\n\nOne of the great French players of all time, Raymond Kopa was a creative attacking midfielder and striker.\n\nLiving in France during the Second World War didn’t provide Kopa with traditional wartime heroism provided to the English or Scottish players on this list, but he served the French nation during the war nonetheless.\n\nAlong with his father and brother, teenaged Kopa worked in the coal mines of northern France all through the war, providing fuel for France while under Nazi command. He even lost a finger in a mining accident.\n\nAfter the war, Kopa tried out for professional football sides to avoid the early death most miners—including his father and brother—suffer.\n\nThe venture proved successful. Kopa went on to play for the same Real Madrid squad that featured the talents of Ferenc Puskás.\n\nNot much is known about the life of Austrian soccer player Ernst Kunz.\n\nBorn in 1912, Kunz played for the Austrian national Wunderteam at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. The team took home the silver medal at that tournament.\n\nThe defender served for Germany in the Second World War. He died in battle on August 21, 1944 in Lithuania.\n\nRomanian footballer Petea Vâlcov is known for being one of the most successful strikers in the history of First League Romanian football, and the most prolific of the three brothers Vâlcov who played striker for Venus Bucureşti during the 1930s.\n\nAlong with his brothers Colea and Volodea, Vâlcov formed the most dangerous part of a famed striking triumvirate. He also scored four goals in seven matches at the international level for Romania.\n\nVâlcov served in the Romanian army during the Second World War and died fighting the Soviets at Kalmyk Steppe in November of 1943.\n\nAustrian midfielder Karl Wahlmüller competed on the same silver medal-winning national team as Ernst Kunz at the ’36 Olympics.\n\nLike Kunz, not a lot is known about Wahlmüller’s life—only that he died in battle on February 16, 1944 in Estonia, a nation that served as an important battle ground between the Nazis and Soviets.\n\nAccording to estimates, approximately 25 percent of Estonians died during the war, as did countless troops on both sides of the divide.\n\nPalestinian international Ayman Alkurd didn’t serve during wartime, but he deserves to be remembered as a soccer player who died as a result of the same ethnically and racially motivated systemic aggression that causes wars.\n\nAlkurd was born in 1975 and played for the Palestine national team throughout his professional career. He died at the age of 34, in 2009, during an Israeli airstrike on the Gaza strip.\n\nOther Palestinian internationals killed during the strike include Wajeh Moshtahe and Shadi Sbakhe.\n\nOne more Scotsman, for the folks at home.\n\nAngus Douglas—and can we pause here for a minute to acknowledge just how brutally Scottish that name is?—played for Chelsea and Newcastle United, as well as the Scottish national team.\n\nDouglas served for Britain in the First World War and survived, only to fall victim to the flu pandemic of 1918. He died just before his 30th birthday."
