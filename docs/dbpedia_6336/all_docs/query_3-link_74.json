Jian) compared with mirror carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGu, Ying; Lu, Cuiyun; Zhang, Xiaofeng; Li, Chao; Yu, Juhua; Sun, Xiaowen\n\n2015-05-01\n\nWe report the genetic linkage map of Jian carp ( Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). An F1 population comprising 94 Jian carp individuals was mapped using 254 microsatellite markers. The genetic map spanned 1 381.592 cM and comprised 44 linkage groups, with an average marker distance of 6.58 cM. We identified eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for body weight (BW) in seven linkage groups, explaining 12.6% to 17.3% of the phenotypic variance. Comparative mapping was performed between Jian carp and mirror carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.), which both have 50 chromosomes. One hundred and ninety-eight Jian carp marker loci were found in common with the mirror carp map, with 186 (93.94%) showing synteny. All 44 Jian carp linkage groups could be one-to-one aligned to the 44 mirror carp linkage groups, mostly sharing two or more common loci. Three QTLs for BW in Jian carp were conserved in mirror carp. QTL comparison suggested that the QTL confidence interval in mirror carp was more precise than the homologous interval in Jian carp, which was contained within the QTL interval in Jian carp. The syntenic relationship and consensus QTLs between the two varieties provide a foundation for genomic research and genetic breeding in common carp.\n\nEmergence of Xin Demarcates a Key Innovation in Heart Evolution\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGrosskurth, Shaun E.; Bhattacharya, Debashish; Wang, Qinchuan; Lin, Jim Jung-Ching\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe mouse Xin repeat-containing proteins (mXinÎ± and mXinÎ²) localize to the intercalated disc in the heart. mXinÎ± is able to bundle actin filaments and to interact with Î²-catenin, suggesting a role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to N-cadherin/Î²-catenin adhesion. mXinÎ±-null mouse hearts display progressively ultrastructural alterations at the intercalated discs, and develop cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. The up-regulation of mXinÎ² in mXinÎ±-deficient mice suggests a partial compensation for the loss of mXinÎ±. To elucidate the evolutionary relationship between these proteins and to identify the origin of Xin, a phylogenetic analysis was done with 40 vertebrate Xins. Our results show that the ancestral Xin originated prior to the emergence of lamprey and subsequently underwent gene duplication early in the vertebrate lineage. A subsequent teleost-specific genome duplication resulted in most teleosts encoding at least three genes. All Xins contain a highly conserved Î²-catenin-binding domain within the Xin repeat region. Similar to mouse Xins, chicken, frog and zebrafish Xins also co-localized with Î²-catenin to structures that appear to be the intercalated disc. A putative DNA-binding domain in the N-terminus of all Xins is strongly conserved, whereas the previously characterized Mena/VASP-binding domain is a derived trait found only in XinÎ±s from placental mammals. In the C-terminus, XinÎ±s and XinÎ²s are more divergent relative to each other but each isoform from mammals shows a high degree of within-isoform sequence identity. This suggests different but conserved functions for mammalian XinÎ± and XinÎ². Interestingly, the origin of Xin ca. 550 million years ago coincides with the genesis of heart chambers with complete endothelial and myocardial layers. We postulate that the emergence of the Xin paralogs and their functional differentiation may have played a key role in the evolutionary development of the heart. PMID\n\nJian Receives 2009 F. L.

Jian)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFeng, Lin; Peng, Yan; Wu, Pei; Hu, Kai; Jiang, Wei-Dan; Liu, Yang; Jiang, Jun; Li, Shu-Hong; Zhou, Xiao-Qiu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the effects of threonine (Thr) on the digestive and absorptive ability, proliferation and differentiation of enterocytes, and gene expression of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). First, seven isonitrogenous diets containing graded levels of Thr (7.4â25.2 g/kg diet) were fed to the fishes for 60 days. Second, enterocyte proliferation and differentiation were assayed by culturing enterocytes with graded levels of Thr (0â275 mg/l) in vitro. Finally, enterocytes were cultured with 0 and 205 mg/l Thr to determine protein synthesis. The percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency, protein retention value, activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase, weights and protein contents of hepatopancreas and intestine, folds heights, activities of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), Î³- glutamyl transpeptidase and Na+/K+-ATPase in all intestinal segments, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities in hepatopancreas, and 4E-BP2 gene expression in muscle, hepatopancreas and intestinal segments were significantly enhanced by Thr (p<0.05). However, the plasma ammonia concentration and TOR gene expression decreased (p<0.05). In vitro, Thr supplement significantly increased cell numbers, protein content, the activities of GOT, GPT, AKP and Na+/K+-ATPase, and protein synthesis rate of enterocytes, and decreased LDH activity and ammonia content in cell medium (p<0.05). In conclusion, Thr improved growth, digestive and absorptive capacity, enterocyte proliferation and differentiation, and protein synthesis and regulated TOR and 4E-BP2 gene expression in juvenile Jian carp. The dietary Thr requirement of juvenile Jian carp was 16.25 g/kg diet (51.3 g/kg protein) based on quadratic regression analysis of PWG.

This work describes the case of a 49-year-old male who displayed subacute renal failure induced by ingestion of herbal powder containing Xi Xin, which includes aristolochic acid. Since Xi Xin is a common ingredient in traditional formulae, care needs to be taken in the future to identify the aristolochic acid concentration of different components of Xi Xin. Xi Xin containing aristolochic acid should be forbidden for use in remedies in order to prevent the harmful effects of aristolochic acid.\n\nIdentification and characterization of a LTR retrotransposon from the genome of Cyprinus carpio var. Jian.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Liping; Yin, Guojun; Cao, Zheming; Bing, Xuwen; Ding, Weidong\n\n2016-06-01\n\nA Ty3/gypsy-retrotransposon-type transposon was found in the genome of the Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) in a previous study (unpublished), and was designated a JRE retrotransposon (Jian retrotransposon). The full-length JRE retrotransposon is 5126Â bp, which includes two long terminal repeats of 470Â bp at the 5' end and 453Â bp at the 3' end, and two open reading frames between them: 4203Â bp encoding the group-specific antigen (GAG) and polyprotein (POL). The pol gene has a typical Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon structure, and the gene order is protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and integrase (PR-RT-RH-IN). A phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene showed that it has similarities of 40.7, 40, and 32.8Â %, to retrotransposons of Azumapecten farreri, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, and Xiphophorus maculatus, respectively. Therefore, JRE might belong to the JULE retrotransposon family. The copy number of the JRE transposon in the genome of the Jian carp is 124, determined with real-time quantitative PCR. The mRNA of the JRE retrotransposon is expressed in five Jian carp tissues, the liver, kidney, blood, muscle, and gonad, and slightly higher in the kidney and liver than in the other tissues.\n\nXin, an actin binding protein, is expressed within muscle satellite cells and newly regenerated skeletal muscle fibers.\n\nPubMed\n\nHawke, Thomas J; Atkinson, Daniel J; Kanatous, Shane B; Van der Ven, Peter F M; Goetsch, Sean C; Garry, Daniel J\n\n2007-11-01\n\nXin is a muscle-specific actin binding protein of which its role and regulation within skeletal muscle is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that Xin mRNA is robustly upregulated (>16-fold) within 12 h of skeletal muscle injury and is localized to the muscle satellite cell population. RT-PCR confirmed the expression pattern of Xin during regeneration, as well as within primary muscle myoblast cultures, but not other known stem cell populations. Immunohistochemical staining of single myofibers demonstrate Xin expression colocalized with the satellite cell marker Syndecan-4 further supporting the mRNA expression of Xin in satellite cells. In situ hybridization of regenerating muscle 5-7 days postinjury illustrates Xin expression within newly regenerated myofibers. Promoter-reporter assays demonstrate that known myogenic transcription factors [myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), myogenic differentiation-1 (MyoD), and myogenic factor-5 (Myf-5)] transactivate Xin promoter constructs supporting the muscle-specific expression of Xin. To determine the role of Xin within muscle precursor cells, proliferation, migration, and differentiation analysis using Xin, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were undertaken in C2C12 myoblasts. Reducing endogenous Xin expression resulted in a 26% increase (P < 0.05) in cell proliferation and a 20% increase (P < 0.05) in myoblast migratory capacity. Skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain protein levels were increased (P < 0.05) with Xin shRNA administration; however, this was not accompanied by changes in myoglobin protein (another marker of differentiation) nor overt morphological differences relative to differentiating control cells. Taken together, the present findings support the hypothesis that Xin is expressed within muscle satellite cells during skeletal muscle regeneration and is involved in the regulation of myoblast function.\n\n[Study on nano-CaCO3 applicated in Xin Yue Shu Capsules preliminarily].\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Yan-Rong; Zhang, Zhen-Hai; Cui, Li; He, Jun-Jie; Hu, Shao-Ying; Jia, Xiao-Bin\n\n2012-11-01\n\nTo investigate the characteristics of nano-CaCO3 applicated in Xin Yue Shu Capsules. Studied the effect of different dosages of aerosil or nano-CaCO3 on fluidity, bulk density, moisture absorption of Xin Yue Shu capsules spray drying powder. In vitro dissolution and ferulic acid stability of Xin Yue Shu capsules was observed. It significantly improved powder fluidity and bulk density of Xin Yue Shu spray drying powder when aerosil or nano-CaCO3 was added. But there was no significant effect on powder moisture absorption, ferulic acid in vitro dissolution and ferulic acid stability. The effect of Nano-CaCO3 on improving powder fluidity and bulk density applicated in the spray drying powder of traditional Chinese medicine deserves studying further.\n\nVitamin D inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response potentially through the Toll-like receptor 4 signalling pathway in the intestine and enterocytes of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian).\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Jun; Shi, Dan; Zhou, Xiao-Qiu; Yin, Long; Feng, Lin; Jiang, Wei-Dan; Liu, Yang; Tang, Ling; Wu, Pei; Zhao, Ye\n\n2015-11-28\n\nThe present study was conducted to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D both in juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro. In primary enterocytes, exposure to 10 mg lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/l increased lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture medium (P<0Â·05) and resulted in a significant loss of cell viability (P<0Â·05). LPS exposure increased (P<0Â·05) the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8), which was decreased by pre-treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D3) in a dose-dependent manner (P<0Â·05). Further results showed that pre-treatment with 1,25D3 down-regulated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) and NF-ÎºB p65 mRNA expression (P<0Â·05), suggesting potential mechanisms against LPS-induced inflammatory response. In vivo, intraperitoneal injection of LPS significantly increased TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in the intestine of carp (P<0Â·05). Pre-treatment of fish with vitamin D3 protected the fish intestine from the LPS-induced increase of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8 mainly by downregulating TLR4, Myd88 and NF-ÎºB p65 mRNA expression (P<0Â·05). These observations suggest that vitamin D could inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory response in juvenile Jian carp in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro. The anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D is mediated at least in part by TLR4-Myd88 signalling pathways in the intestine and enterocytes of juvenile Jian carp.\n\nEfficacy of Jian'ganle () versus Hugan Pian (), glucuronolactone and reduced glutathione in prevention of antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Quan; Zhong, Fang-ying; Wu, Meng; Zhang, Xin-ping\n\n2014-06-01\n\nEvidence-based medicine is advocated by WHO and adopted by developed countries for many years. In China, however, the selection of essential medicine and various medical insurance reimbursement schemes medicine is usually based on experts' experience of prescription practice which is under heavy critics resulting from the lack of related comparative efficacy and evidence-based research. The efficacy of Jian'ganle in prevention of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by antituberculotics was evaluated in this study by comparison with Hugan Pian, glucuronolactone and reduced glutathione. Evidence was provided for relevant sectors such as Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China and National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China to select and renew the Essential Medicine List (EML), the new rural cooperative medical scheme in China (NRCMS) list or the reimbursement list of industrial injury insurance. A total of 189 patients with initial pulmonary tuberculosis were divided into four groups who took antituberculotics combined with Jian'ganle, Hugan Pian, glucuronolactone and reduced glutathione respectively. Their liver function profile including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), total protein (TP), albumin (A) and globulin (G) were detected at admission as baseline and after treatment. The Jian'ganle group was compared with the three others by chi-square tests. In an aspect of maintaining bilirubin indexes normal, Jian'ganle was more efficacious than glucuronolactone. And Jian'ganle had a little more efficacy than reduced glutathione to maintain protein indexes normal as well. And the therapeutic regimen of antituberculotics combined with Jian'ganle was the best in treating tuberculosis and preventing DILI at the same time. The study showed that among the four hepatinicas which demonstrated similar prevention\n\nEffects of curcumin on antioxidative activities and cytokine production in Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) with CCl4-induced liver damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Liping; Ding, Weidong; Du, Jingliang; Jia, Rui; Liu, Yingjuan; Zhao, Caiyuan; Shen, Yujin; Yin, Guojun\n\n2015-03-01\n\nWe investigated the protective effects of curcumin on liver-damaged Cyprinus carpio var. Jian (Jian carp). The carp were fed 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0% curcumin for 60 days, then injected intraperitoneally with 30% carbon tetrachloride solution. Liver and blood samples were collected to measure the liver index, serum- and liver-associated enzymes, liver histology, nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB)/c-Rel, interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and IL-12 mRNA expression, and the level of NF-ÎºB/c-Rel protein in the liver, and for a comet assay. We found that 0.5% and 1.0% curcumin significantly reduced the CCl(4)-induced increase in the liver index. The comet assay showed that the tail moment, olive tail moment, tail length, and tail DNA% improved in fish pretreated with 0.5 or 1.0% curcumin. CCl(4)-induced histological changes, including extensive hepatocyte degeneration, indistinct cell borders, nuclear condensation, and karyolysis were clearly reduced after treatment with 0.5% and 1.0% curcumin. Moreover, 0.5% and 1.0% curcumin significantly inhibited the CCl(4)-induced increase in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and promoted the restoration of superoxide dismutase in the liver; 1.0% curcumin significantly reduced serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase and hepatic malondialdehyde, but significantly increased the total antioxidant capacity and glutathione levels in the liver. The CCl(4)-induced upregulation of NF-ÎºB/c-Rel, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î± mRNAs and NF-ÎºB/c-Rel protein levels was inhibited by 0.5% and 1.0% curcumin, and IL-12 mRNA was reduced by all three doses of curcumin. The effects of curcumin on the liver index, enzymes, histological changes, and cytokines were dose-dependent. Our results indicate that curcumin reduces CCl(4)-induced liver damage in Jian carp by upregulating antioxidative activities and inhibiting NF-ÎºB, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, and IL-12 expression.

Jian).\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Jun; Shi, Dan; Zhou, Xiao-Qiu; Hu, Yi; Feng, Lin; Liu, Yang; Jiang, Wei-Dan; Zhao, Ye\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe present study was designed to assess the possible protective effects of arginine (Arg) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory response in juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro. Firstly, inflammatory response was established by exposing enterocytes to different concentrations of LPS for 24 h. Secondly, the protective effects of Arg against subsequent LPS exposure were studied in enterocytes. Finally, we investigated whether dietary Arg supplementation could attenuate immune challenge induced by LPS in vivo. The result indicated that 10 mg/L LPS could induced inflammatory response in enterocytes. Cells exposed to LPS (10-30 mg/L) alone for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH) (P < 0.05). The cell viability, protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity were decreased by LPS (P < 0.05). Moreover, LPS exposure significantly increased TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 mRNA expression in vitro (P < 0.05). However, pre-treatment with Arg remarkably prevented the increase of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 by inhibiting the excessive activation of TLR4-Myd88 signaling pathway through down-regulating TLR4, Myd88, NFÎºB p65, and MAPK p38 mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the experiment in vivo showed that Arg pre-supplementation could attenuate immune challenge induced by LPS via TLR4-Myd88 signaling pathway, and thus protect fish against LPS-induced inflammatory response. In conclusion, all of these results indicated pre-supplementation with Arg decreased LPS induced immune damage and regulated TLR4-Myd88 signaling pathway in juvenile Jian carp in vivo and in enterocytes in vitro.

The results showed that an 80 g/kg diet of glycinin exposure for 42 d caused poor growth performance and depressed intestinal growth and function of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). Meanwhile, dietary glycinin exposure induced increases in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation; it caused reductions in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities; and it increased MnSOD, CuZnSOD, GPx1b and GPx4a mRNA levels, suggesting an adaptive mechanism against stress in the intestines of fish. However, dietary glycinin exposure decreased both the activity and mRNA levels of nine isoforms of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (Î±, Î¼, Ï, Ï, Î¸, Îº, mGST1, mGST2 and mGST3), indicating toxicity to this enzyme activity and corresponding isoform gene expressions. In addition, glycinin exposure caused partial disruption of intestinal cell-cell tight junction components, disturbances of cytokines and induced apoptosis signalling in the distal intestines>mid intestines>proximal intestines of fish. Glycinin exposure also disturbed the mRNA levels of intestinal-related signalling factors Nrf2, Keap1a, Keap1b, eleven isoforms of protein kinase C and target of rapamycin/4E-BP. Interestingly, glutamine was observed to partially block those negative influences. In conclusion, this study indicates that dietary glycinin exposure causes intestinal oxidative damage and disruption of intestinal physical barriers and functions and reduces fish growth, but glutamine can reverse those negative effects in fish. This study provides some information on the mechanism of glycinin-induced negative effects.\n\nEffect of choline on antioxidant defenses and gene expressions of Nrf2 signaling molecule in the spleen and head kidney of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian).\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Pei; Jiang, Wei-Dan; Liu, Yang; Chen, Gang-Fu; Jiang, Jun; Li, Shu-Hong; Feng, Lin; Zhou, Xiao-Qiu\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe present work evaluates the effects of various levels of dietary choline on antioxidant defenses and gene expressions of Nrf2 signaling molecule in spleen and head kidney of juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian). Fish were fed with six different experimental diets containing graded levels of choline at 165 (choline-deficient control), 310, 607, 896, 1167 and 1820Â mgÂ kg(-1) diet for 65 days. At the end of the feeding trail, fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila and mortalities were recorded over 17 days. Dietary choline significantly decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in spleen and head kidney. However, anti-superoxide anion and anti-hydroxyl radical activities in spleen and head kidney also decreased. Interestingly, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) in spleen, GPx activity in head kidney, and glutathione contents in spleen and head kidney were decreased with increase of dietary choline levels up to a certain point, whereas, activities of SOD, GST and GR in head kidney showed no significantly differences among groups. Similarly, expression levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, CAT, GPx1a, GPx1b and GR gene in spleen and head kidney were significantly lower in group with choline level of 607Â mgÂ kg(-1) diet than those in the choline-deficient group. The relative gene expressions of Nrf2 in head kidney and Keap1a in spleen and head kidney were decreased with increasing of dietary choline up to a certain point. However, the relative gene expression of Nrf2 in spleen were not significantly affected by dietary choline. In conclusion, dietary choline decreased the oxidant damage and regulated the antioxidant system in immune organs of juvenile Jian carp. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it does not provide good benefits for AIH patients because of its serious side effects. Therefore, more and more AIH patients prefer to seek for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to manage their symptoms and reduce the side effects of steroids in China. Shu-Gan-Jian-Pi Decoction is a popular used Chinese herbal formula in Guangdong province of China, which has demonstrated the effect of improving efficacy and reducing side effects of corticosteroids in AIH patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Shu-Gan-Jian-Pi Decoction combined with steroid in AIH patients. So, this study aims to explore whether the combination treatment of Shu-Gan-Jian-Pi Decoction and steroid standard therapy could improve the clinical management of AIH. A prospective non-randomized study on AIH will be conducted between October 2015 and June 2017 in Guangdong Provincial hospital of Chinese medicine. Eligible AIH patients will be classified as the case group (nâ=â66) and the control group (nâ=â66) based on the interventions. Patients taking Shu-Gan-Jian-Pi Decoction combined with prednisone and azathioprine will be in the case group and those taking prednisone and azathioprine will be in the control group. The whole study will last 48Â weeks, including a 24-week observation period and a 24-week follow-up period. The primary outcome was complete response to therapy, defined as complete biochemical remission at the patient's last visit of observation period and the absence of predefined steroid-specific side effects throughout treatment. This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shu-Gan-Jian-Pi Decoction combined with prednisone and azathioprine on AIH patients. The achievement of this trial will provide evidence-based data for Shu-Gan-Jian-Pi Decoction, which could provide good benefits for AIH patients.

Based on data of interpreting TM orthophoto images and water quality monitoring in May 2010, the land use map of Xin'anjiang River, which was categorized to cultivated land, forestland, grassland, water body, building site, was obtained. Using ArcGIS hydrological and spatial analysis function, Xin'anjiang River was divided into eight sub-watersheds, and its watershed land use structure was analyzed. The water quality parameters such as TN, TP, permanganate index, fecal coliform bacteria were monitored from Jan 2010 to Dec 2010. The relations between water quality and land use were analyzed. The results showed that TN and NH4(+) -N had a significant temporal variation: dry season > wet season > normal river flow period, but other parameters did not vary significantly. In the space, Yuliang and Pukou were the most serious pollution sites. Cultivated land, water body, building site had a positive impact on water quality parameters, while there were negative correlation between the forestland and grassland. Annually, cultivated land had the most significantly important effect on TN, NH4(+) -N and permanganate index, and grassland had the most significantly important effect on TP. Cultivated land had the most prominently important impact on water quality parameters in dry season and wet season. What's more, in the normal river flow, cultivated land, grassland and forestland had the most remarkably important influence on TN, TP and fecal coliform bacteria respectively.\n\n[Effect of jian-gan-le on advanced schistosomiasis].\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Zheng-Wen; Wang, You-Bin; Huang, Wen-Jun\n\n2011-06-01\n\nA total of 80 cases of advanced schistosomiasis were selected and divided into an experiment group and a control group, 40 cases each group, by the random sampling method. The patients in the experiment group were administered with Jian-gan-le, and the patients in the control group received compound purple granules. In the experiment group, the curative rate was 25.0%, the improving rate was 70.0%, the inefficacy rate was 5%, and the efficiency rate was 95.0%. In the control group, the curative rate was 12.5%, the improving rate was 75%, the inefficacy rate was 12.5%. There was no statistic difference between the 2 groups (P all > 0.05).

The ordered structure is metastable in the bulk, so any glissile dislocation that disrupts the ordered pattern will release stored energy, and experience an increased glide force. Here we show how this connection between atomic ordering and dislocation glide force can be exploited to control the threading dislocation density (TDD) in Ga xIn 1-xP CGBs. When ordered Ga xIn 1-xP is graded from the GaAs lattice constant to InP, the order parametermoreÂ Â» ..eta.. decreases as x decreases, and dislocation glide switches from one set of glide planes to the other. This glide plane switch (GPS) is accompanied by the nucleation of dislocations on the new glide plane, which typically leads to increased TDD. We develop control of the GPS position within a Ga xIn 1-xP CGB through manipulation of deposition temperature, surfactant concentration, and strain-grading rate. We demonstrate a two-stage Ga xIn 1-xP CGB from GaAs to InP with sufficiently low TDD for high performance devices, such as the 4-junction inverted metamorphic multi-junction solar cell, achieved through careful control the GPS position. Here, experimental results are analyzed within the context of a model that considers the force balance on dislocations on the two competing glide planes as a function of the degree of ordering.Â«Â less\n\nEffects of Ala-Gln feeding strategies on growth, metabolism, and crowding stress resistance of juvenile Cyprinus carpio var. Jian.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Xiu-Mei; Guo, Gui-Liang; Sun, Li; Yang, Qiu-Shi; Wang, Gui-Qin; Qin, Gui-Xin; Zhang, Dong-Ming\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different L-alanyl-l-glutamine (Ala-Gln) feeding strategies on the growth performance, metabolism and crowding stress resistance related parameters in juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) under crowded condition (80Â g/L). Juvenile Jian carp (initial weight 26.1Â Â±Â 0.6Â g) were distributed into five groups which fed with graded concentrations (0% or 1.0%) of Ala-Gln for eight weeks. Control group (I, 0/0) fed with control diet (0% Ala-Gln) throughout the feeding trial. The other four groups employed different control and experimental diet feeding strategies ranging from two weeks control diet fed and two weeks experimental diet (1% Ala-Gln) fed (II, 0/2) to eight weeks experimental diet fed (V, 4/4). Results revealed that Mean weight gain (MEG) under all different feeding strategies of Ala-Gln were significantly higher than that of the control group (pÂ <Â 0.05), and MEG of group II (201.90%) was even higher than that of group IV (184.70%). Liver glycogen and blood total protein of groups II, III and V were significantly higher than that in groups I and IV (pÂ <Â 0.05). The highest level of serum thyroxine (10.07Â ng/ml), insulin-like growth factor-I (52.40Â ng/ml) and insulin (9.73Â Î¼Â IU/mL) were observed in group V. However, diet supplemented with Ala-Gln did not affect the levels of serum glucose, cortisol and catecholamine in fish. The mRNA expression of GR1a, GR1b and GR2 were also significantly changed in Ala-Gln supplementation groups compared with control group (pÂ <Â 0.05). After fish intraperitoneally injected with virulent Aeromonas hydrophila, the fish survival rates were significantly increased in all Ala-Gln supplementation groups compared with control group (pÂ <Â 0.05). Results from the present experiment showed the importance of dietary supplementation of Ala-Gln in benefaction of the growth performance, metabolism and crowding stress resistance in Jian carp breeding. The\n\nEffect of dietary glutamine on growth performance, non-specific immunity, expression of cytokine genes, phosphorylation of target of rapamycin (TOR), and anti-oxidative system in spleen and head kidney of Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

Jian). Fish were fed the basal (control) and glutamine-supplemented (12.0Â gÂ glutamineÂ kg(-1) diet) diets for 6Â weeks. Results indicated that the dietary glutamine supplementation improved the growth performance, spleen protein content, serum complement 3 content, and lysozyme activity in fish. In the spleen, glutamine down-regulated the expression of the interleukin 1 and interleukin 10 genes, and increased the level of phosphorylation of TOR protein. In the head kidney, glutamine down-regulated the tumor necrosis factor Î± and interleukin 10 gene expressions, phosphorylated and total TOR protein levels, while up-regulated the transforming growth factor Î²2 gene expression. Furthermore, the protein carbonyl content was decreased in the spleen of fish fed glutamine-supplemented diet; conversely, the anti-hydroxyl radical capacity and glutathione content in the spleen were increased by glutamine. However, diet supplemented with glutamine did not affect the lipid peroxidation, anti-superoxide anion capacity, and antioxidant enzyme activities in the spleen. Moreover, all of these antioxidant parameters in the head kidney were not affected by glutamine. Results from the present experiment showed the importance of dietary supplementation of glutamine in benefaction of the growth performance and several components of the innate immune system, and the deferential role in cytokine gene expression, TOR kinase activity, and antioxidant status between the spleen and head kidney of juvenile Jian carp.\n\nEffects of Dao De Xin Xi Exercise on Balance and Quality of Life in Thai Elderly Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIntarakamhang, Patrawut; Chintanaprawasee, Pantipa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 12-week Dao De Xin Xi exercise, modified short forms of Tai Chi, on balance and quality of life in Thai elderly population. Quasi-Experimental research, pretest-posttest one group design was done at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department, Phramongkutklao Hospital. Thai healthy elderly women over the age of 60, requiring regular Dao De Xin Xi exercise were recruited from either patients or workers in the hospital. A 60-minute Dao De Xin Xi exercise class was set as 3 times per week for 12 weeks. At baseline and 12 weeks, participants were tested in their static balance (Single-Leg Stance Timed Test with eyes open and close), dynamic balance (Expanded Timed Up and Go (ETUG) Test). Quality of life was measured by the abbreviated Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Fourteen females were studied with mean age of 62.8Â±4.3 years old. The Single-Leg Stance Timed Test with eyes open and close, Expanded Timed Up and Go (ETUG) Test improved significantly (before versus after exercises p <0.001). Significant improvement in quality of life were also found in each 4 domains, including physical health, psychological, social relationship, and environment (before versus after exercises p =0.001, 0.001, 0.004 and 0.005 respectively). No significant improvement was found only in the right Single-Leg Stance Timed Test with eyes close (p =0.091). A three times per week for 12-week Dao De Xin Xi exercise may help Thai elderly women improve both static, dynamic balance and quality of life.

Jian).\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Gangfu; Feng, Lin; Kuang, Shengyao; Liu, Yang; Jiang, Jun; Hu, Kai; Jiang, Weidan; Li, Shuhong; Tang, Ling; Zhou, Xiaoqiu\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThe present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that dietary arginine promotes digestion and absorption capacity, and, thus, enhances fish growth. This improvement might be related to the target of rapamycin (TOR) and eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP). A total of 1200 juvenile Jian carp, Cyprinus carpio var. Jian, with an average initial weight of 6.33 (SE 0.03) g, were fed with diets containing graded concentrations of arginine, namely, 9.8 (control), 12.7, 16.1, 18.5, 21.9 and 24.5 g arginine/kg diet for 9 weeks. An real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed to determine the relative expression of TOR and 4E-BP in fish muscle, hepatopancreas and intestine. Dietary arginine increased (P < 0.05): (1) glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities in muscle and hepatopancreas; (2) intestine and hepatopancreas protein content, folds height, and trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, Naâº/Kâº-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine kinase activities in intestine; (3) Lactobacillus counts; (4) relative expression of TOR in the muscle, hepatopancreas and distal intestine (DI); (5) relative expression of 4E-BP in proximal intestine (PI) and mid-intestine (MI), as compared with the control group. In contrast, dietary arginine reduced (P < 0.05): (1) plasma ammonia content; (2) Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli counts; (3) relative expression of TOR in PI and MI; (4) relative expression of 4E-BP in the muscle, hepatopancreas and DI. The arginine requirement estimated by specific growth rate using quadratic regression analysis was found to be 18.0 g/kg diet. These results indicate that arginine improved fish growth, digestive and absorptive ability and regulated the expression of TOR and 4E-BP genes.\n\nTong-xin-luo capsule for patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\nPubMed\n\nMao, Chen; Fu, Xiao-Hong; Yuan, Jin-Qiu; Yang, Zu-Yao; Chung, Vincent C H; Qin, Ying; Huang, Yafang; Tam, Wilson Wai San; Kwong, Joey S W; Xie, Wei; Tang, Jin-Ling\n\n2015-05-21\n\nPercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a standard treatment for coronary heart disease (CHD). Restenosis, defined as a 50% reduction in luminal diameter at six months after PCI, indicates a need for revascularisation. Restenosis has proven to be a major drawback to PCI. Tong-xin-luo is one of the prophylactic strategies for cardiovascular events in patients after PCI that is widely used in China, but its efficacy and safety have not been systematically evaluated. To systematically assess the efficacy and safety of Tong-xin-luo capsules in preventing cardiovascular events after PCI in patients with CHD. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), WanFang, Chinese Biomedical Database, Chinese Medical Current Contents, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from their inception to June 2014. We also searched other resources, including ongoing trials and research registries. We applied no language restrictions. Randomised controlled trials of participants with CHD after PCI were included. Participants in the intervention group received Tong-xin-luo capsules for at least three months. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third review author. The primary outcomes included occurrence of angiographic restenosis and adverse events; the secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, heart failure, angina, all cause mortality, mortality due to any cardiovascular event, use of revascularisation, patient acceptability, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Dichotomous data were measured with risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sixteen studies involving 1063 participants were identified. The risk of bias for fifteen studies was high and along with imprecision and possible publication bias, this lowered our confidence in the results. There was low quality evidence that Tong\n\n[Autobiography of modern acupuncturist Yu Shu-zhuang].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jia-jian' i; Guo, Jing; Yu, Zhen-zhong; Wang, Lin-peng\n\n2014-11-01\n\nProfessor YU Shu-zhuang is a distinguished acupuncturist in China.

Based on short-term spatial observations in the spring, summer, and winter and on long-term site-specific observation from 1988 to 2013, the spatial, seasonal, long-term variations, and the factors affecting transparency are presented for Xin'anjiang Reservoir (China). Spatially, transparency was high in the open water but low in the bays and the inflowing river mouths, reflecting the effect of river runoff. The seasonal effects were distinct, with lower values in the summer than in the winter, most likely due to river runoff and phytoplankton biomass increases. The transparency decreased significantly with a linear slope of 0.079 m/year, indicating a 2.05 m decrease and a marked decrease in water quality. A marked increase occurred in chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration, and a significant correlation was found between the transparency and Chla concentration, indicating that phytoplankton biomass can partially explain the long-term trend of transparency in Xin'anjiang Reservoir. The river input and phytoplankton biomass increase were associated with soil erosion and nutrient loss in the catchment. Our study will support future management of water quality in Xin'anjiang Reservoir.\n\nCultivating a \"Jian Zi\": Exploring an Art Teacher's Responsive Pedagogy for the Development of Art Talent in Taiwan\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nChen, Wei-Ren\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis qualitative case study explored the operational curricula of an art teacher's responsive pedagogy that focused on the differentiation aspects for artistically talented students in an elementary school in Taiwan.

This method combined the field investigation, morphological and molecular biology to identify ectomycorrhizal fungi. There were 37 different ectomycorrhizal fungi under 14 genera of 10 families on spruce in Xin Jiashan Forest of Qinling Mountains, 34 types belonged to Basidiomycetes, 1 to Ascomycete and 2 to unknown species. Among these identified ectomycorrhizal fungi types, Inocybe sp. was the dominant group; Russula nauseosa was the most dominant species; Hygrophorus sp., Tomentella coerulea, Inocybe sp. 1, Helotiaceae sp. and Lactarius deterrimus were common species; and the rest species were rare species. The large number but relatively rare species of dominant family and the small number but relatively more species of rare family survived in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities of Picea asperata. For the extreme degradation in arid area of western ecological system, identifing some rare family for further development and utilization had very important practical significance.\n\nLearning from the past: Rare Îµ-Fe2O3 in the ancient black-glazed Jian (Tenmoku) wares\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDejoie, Catherine; Sciau, Philippe; Li, Weidong; NoÃ©, Laure; Mehta, Apurva; Chen, Kai; Luo, Hongjie; Kunz, Martin; Tamura, Nobumichi; Liu, Zhi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAncient Jian wares are famous for their lustrous black glaze that exhibits unique colored patterns. Some striking examples include the brownish colored âHare's Furâ (HF) strips and the silvery âOil Spotâ (OS) patterns. Herein, we investigated the glaze surface of HF and OS samples using a variety of characterization methods. Contrary to the commonly accepted theory, we identified the presence of Îµ-Fe2O3, a rare metastable polymorph of Fe2O3 with unique magnetic properties, in both HF and OS samples. We found that surface crystals of OS samples are up to several micrometers in size and exclusively made of Îµ-Fe2O3. Interestingly, these Îµ-Fe2O3 crystals on the OS sample surface are organized in a periodic two dimensional fashion. These results shed new lights on the actual mechanisms and kinetics of polymorphous transitions of Fe2O3. Deciphering technologies behind the fabrication of ancient Jian wares can thus potentially help researchers improve the Îµ-Fe2O3 synthesis.

(Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA case of torrential precipitation process in the Mei-yu front, an Asian monsoon system east to the Tibetan Plateau, is studied with the coupled Penn State University/NCAR MM5 and NASA/GSFC PLACE (Parameterization for Land - Atmosphere - Cloud Exchange) models. Remote and local impacts of water vapor on the location and intensity of Mei-yu precipitation are studied by numerical experiments. Results demonstrate that the water vapor source for this heavy precipitation case in Yangtze river basin is derived mostly from the Bay of Bengal, transported by the southwesterly low-level Jet (LLJ) southeast to the Tibetan Plateau. The moist convection is a critical process in the development and maintenance of the front. The meridional and zonal secondary circulations resulted from Mei-yu condensation heating both act to increase the wind speed in the LLJ. The condensation induced local circulation strengthens the moisture transport in the LLJ, providing a positive feedback to sustain the Mei-yu precipitation system. It is found that local precipitation recycling shifts heavy rain toward the warm side of the Mei-yu front. This shift of rainfall location is due to the pronounced increase of atmospheric moisture and decrease of surface temperature over the warm side of the front.\n\nNeutronographic investigations of supramolecular structures on upgraded small-angle spectrometer YuMO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKuklin, A.

S.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nBulk growth of phosphorus and arsenic based ternary III-V semiconductor crystals using pseudo-binary melts such as GaP-InP, GaP-GaAs, AlAs-GaAs, etc. is significantly challenging due to the high vapor pressures of group V species in conjunction with slow growth rates and the need for melt replenishment and mixing during growth. Lowering the growth temperature is desirable such that the vapor pressures of P and As can be easily handled. Low growth temperatures could be achieved by using Ga or In rich solutions. However, this approach is less attractive for growing bulk crystals due to several experimental difficulties including sticking of the growth solution to the crucible wall and to the grown crystal, making it challenging for crystal extraction. Growth of ternary crystals from low temperature quaternary melts has been found to be attractive. In this paper, we will present a new method for the growth of Ga 1- xIn xP from InSb rich Ga 1- xIn xP ySb 1- y melts at low growth temperatures in the range of 800-1050 Â°C. Thermodynamic phase diagrams calculated at various temperatures using a Gibbs free energy minimization software and materials databases commercially available from Thermo-Calc software will be presented along with experimental validation for Ga 1- xIn xP crystals grown at 1000 Â°C.\n\n[Herbological study on the botanical origin of the Chinese crude drug shan-zhu-yu].\n\nPubMed\n\nMikage, Masayuki; Hutagi, Yukari\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe historical change in the botanical origin of the Chinese herbal drug Shan-zhu-yu, San-syu-yu in Japanese) was studied herbologically. The results obtained were as follows: The original plant, described in Shen-nong-ben-cao-jing written in the Hou-Han Dynasty (A.D. 25-220) and Wu-pu-ben-cao written in the Wei dynasty (A.D. 220-265), was Prunus pseudocerasus or an allied species such as P. tomentosa. However, the original plant described in Ming-yi-bie-lu, written in the same era, was thought to be Cornus officinalis; the fruit of which is used commonly today as Shan-zhu-yu. In addition to Prunus and Cornus, the plants of the genus Berberis, of the family Berberidaceae, and Zanthoxylum of Rutaceae were also used in China until the Ming Dynasty. The plants of Elaeagnus, of the family Elaeagnaceae, were possibly used in ancient Japan. Cornus officinalis was determined to be the origin of Shan-zhu-yu during the Qing Dynasty, China.\n\nEffects of partial replacement of fish meal by yeast hydrolysate on complement system and stress resistance in juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

Jian) (initial average weight 19.44Â Â±Â 0.06Â g). In the study, there were five groups: one control group was fed with a basal diet (YH0), and four treatment groups were fed with dietary fish meal replaced by 1% YH (YH1), 3% (YH3), 5% (YH5) and 7% (YH7), respectively. Each group had four replicates. At the end of feeding trial, twelve fish from each group (three fish per replicate) were randomly selected for assessing the growth and immunity. Meanwhile, 20 fish per replicate were injected by Aeromonas hydrophila. The results showed that (1) Replacement levels of YH significantly affected the growth of the fish with the highest values of weight gain (WG) occurred in fish fed YH3 diet. However, no significant difference in feed conversion ratios (FCR) was observed among all groups. (2) Pre-stressed plasma lysozyme activity, total protein and albumin contents and complement component 3 (C3) and complement component 4 (C4) levels of fish fed YH3 diet were significantly higher than those of fish fed YH0 diet. However, post-stressed immune parameters of fish in all groups were significantly lower. (3) There was a trend that the expression levels of the complement-related genes (c1r/s-A, c4-1, c3-H1, c5-1, fb/c2-A, mbl-2 and masp) initially increased and then decreased except mbl-2 and masp, with the maximum values observed in fish fed YH3 diet. Before stress, the expression levels of the inflammation-related genes (alp, il-1Î² and tnf-Î±) in the hepatopancreas and spleen of fish fed YH1 diet and YH7 diet were significant higher than that of fish fed YH0 diet. After stress, no significant difference in the expression levels of those genes was observed among all groups. These results indicated that FM replacement by YH could improve growth\n\nPREFACE: SANS-YuMO User Meeting at the Start-up of Scientific Experiments on the IBR-2M Reactor: Devoted to the 75th anniversary of Yu M Ostanevich's birth\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGordely, Valentin; Kuklin, Alexander; Balasoiu, Maria\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe Second International Workshop 'SANS-YuMO User Meeting at the Start-up of Scientific Experiments on the IBR-2M Reactor', devoted to the 75th anniversary of the birth of Professor Yu M Ostanevich (1936-1992), an outstanding neutron physicist and the founder of small-angle neutron scattering (field, group, and instrument) at JINR FLNPh, was held on 27-30 May at the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics. The first Workshop was held in October 2006. Research groups from different neutron centers, universities and research institutes across Europe presented more than 35 oral and poster presentations describing scientific and methodological results. Most of them were obtained with the help of the YuMO instrument before the IBR-2 shutdown in 2006. For the last four years the IBR-2 reactor has been shut down for refurbishment. At the end of 2010 the physical launch of the IBR-2M reactor was finally realized. Nowadays the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) technique is applied to a wide range of scientific problems in condensed matter, soft condensed matter, biology and nanotechnology, and despite the fact that there are currently over 30 SANS instruments in operation worldwide at both reactor and spallation sources, the demand for beam-time is considerably higher than the time available. It must be remembered, however, that as the first SANS machine on a steady-state reactor was constructed at the Institute Laue Langevin, Grenoble, the first SANS instrument on a 'white' neutron pulsed beam was accomplished at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at the IBR-30 reactor, beamline N5. During the meeting Yu M Ostanevich's determinative and crucial contribution to the construction of spectrometers at the IBR-2 high-pulsed reactor was presented, as well as his contribution to the development of the time-of-flight (TOF) small-angle scattering technique, and a selection of other scientific areas.

M.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nInfrared reflection spectra of CuxAg1-xIn5S8 mixed crystals, grown by Bridgman method, were studied in the wide frequency range of 50-2000 cm-1. All four infrared-active modes were detected, which are in full agreement with the prediction of group-theoretical analysis. Real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, refractive index and the energy losses function were evaluated from reflectivity measurements. The frequencies of TO and LO modes and oscillator strengths were also determined. The bands detected in IR spectra of studied crystals were assigned to various vibration types (valence and valence-deformation) on the basis of the symmetrized displacements of atoms obtained employing the Melvin projection operators. The linear dependencies of optical mode frequencies on the composition of CuxAg1-xIn5S8 mixed crystals were obtained. These dependencies display one-mode behavior.\n\nAnti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects of glycyrrhetinic acid on CCl4-induced damage in precision-cut liver slices from Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. jian) through inhibition of the nf-kÆ pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Liping; Ding, Weidong; Jia, Rui; Du, Jingliang; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Chunyun; Gu, Zhengyan; Yin, Guojun\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn order to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced damage in precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) from Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio. Jian), an acute liver damage model was established in this study. The viability of PCLS, levels of anti-oxidases in liver homogenates, expression of inflammation-related genes including nuclear factor-ÎºB (nf-ÎºB)/c-rel, inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), interleukin-1Î² (il-1Î²), interleukin-6 (il-6) and interleukin-8 (il-8), and protein levels of (nf-ÎºB)/c-rel in liver tissues were measured. The results showed that pretreatment of PCLS with GA at 5 and 10Â Î¼g/mL for 6Â h significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity of CCl 4 . GA attenuated CCl 4 -induced oxidative stress in PCLS through promoting the recovery of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels, and inhibiting malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis. In inflammatory response, GA at both 5 and 10Â Î¼g/mL significantly inhibited the increase in mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines including nf-kÆ/c-rel, inos, il-1Î², il-6 and il-8, and the protein level of Nf-kÆ/C-rel induced by CCl 4 . Furthermore, treatment with pyrrolyl dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 4Â Î¼g/mL), an inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor nf-kB, significantly inhibited nf-kB levels, and transcription of downstream cytokines inos, il-1Î², il-6 and il-8, also the viability of PCLS was significantly increased. These results indicated that GA suppressed inflammation and reduced cytotoxicity by inhibiting the nf-kÆ signaling pathway, and plays a role in liver protection. Copyright Â© 2017.

Previous studies on XJZT found that it is effective for treating peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastroenteritis and similar psychosomatic disorders of the digestive organs. It has also been shown that all the herbs used in XJZT contain antioxidants. In this study, we investigated the in vitro DNA protection effect of the individual herb extracts and the whole formula. Water extract of the herbs and XJZT were used to pre-treat human lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were then exposed to hydrogen peroxide. The in vitro DNA protection effect of the herbs was investigated by comet assay. No DNA protective effect (P < 0.05) was found for individual herb extracts, but XJZT showed protection of human lymphocytic DNA upon oxidative stress (P < 0.05). The in vitro DNA protection effect of XJZT was conferred by the synergistic effect of the herbs, while the individual herbs had no such effect.\n\nThe genome and structural proteome of YuA, a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage resembling M6.\n\nPubMed\n\nCeyssens, Pieter-Jan; Mesyanzhinov, Vadim; Sykilinda, Nina; Briers, Yves; Roucourt, Bart; Lavigne, Rob; Robben, Johan; Domashin, Artem; Miroshnikov, Konstantin; Volckaert, Guido; Hertveldt, Kirsten\n\n2008-02-01\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa phage YuA (Siphoviridae) was isolated from a pond near Moscow, Russia. It has an elongated head, encapsulating a circularly permuted genome of 58,663 bp, and a flexible, noncontractile tail, which is terminally and subterminally decorated with short fibers. The YuA genome is neither Mu- nor lambda-like and encodes 78 gene products that cluster in three major regions involved in (i) DNA metabolism and replication, (ii) host interaction, and (iii) phage particle formation and host lysis. At the protein level, YuA displays significant homology with phages M6, phiJL001, 73, B3, DMS3, and D3112. Eighteen YuA proteins were identified as part of the phage particle by mass spectrometry analysis. Five different bacterial promoters were experimentally identified using a promoter trap assay, three of which have a sigma54-specific binding site and regulate transcription in the genome region involved in phage particle formation and host lysis. The dependency of these promoters on the host sigma54 factor was confirmed by analysis of an rpoN mutant strain of P. aeruginosa PAO1. At the DNA level, YuA is 91% identical to the recently (July 2007) annotated phage M6 of the Lindberg typing set. Despite this level of DNA homology throughout the genome, both phages combined have 15 unique genes that do not occur in the other phage. The genome organization of both phages differs substantially from those of the other known Pseudomonas-infecting Siphoviridae, delineating them as a distinct genus within this family.\n\nComparative analysis of the main bioactive components of Xin-Sheng-Hua granule and its single herbs by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nPang, Hanqing; Wang, Jun; Tang, Yuping; Xu, Huiqin; Wu, Liang; Jin, Yi; Zhu, Zhenhua; Guo, Sheng; Shi, Xuqin; Huang, Shengliang; Sun, Dazheng; Duan, Jin-Ao\n\n2016-11-01\n\nXin-Sheng-Hua granule, a representative formula for postpartum hemorrhage, has been used clinically to treat postpartum diseases. Its main bioactive components comprise aromatic acids, phthalides, alkaloids, flavonoids, and gingerols among others. To investigate the changes in main bioactive constituents in its seven single herbs before and after compatibility, a rapid, simple, and sensitive method was developed for comparative analysis of 27 main bioactive components by using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for the first time. The sufficient separation of 27 target constituents was achieved on a Thermo Scientific Hypersil GOLD column (100 mm Ã 3 mm, 1.9 Î¼m) within 20 min under the optimized chromatographic conditions. Compared with the theoretical content, the observed content of each analyte showed remarkable differences in Xin-Sheng-Hua granule except thymine, p-coumaric acid, senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, and ligustilide; the total contents of 27 components increased significantly, and the content variation degrees for the different components were gingerols > flavonoids > aromatic acids > alkaloids > phthalides. The results could provide a good reference for the quality control of Xin-Sheng-Hua granule and might be helpful to interpret the drug interactions based on variation of bioactive components in formulae.

A.; Breivik, M.; Selvig, E.; Fimland, B. O.\n\n2009-03-01\n\nSeveral Ga 1-xIn xSb layers, capped with 1 Î¼m of GaSb, were grown on GaSb(0 0 1) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy in a Varian Gen II Modular system using either the conventional sample growth position with substrate rotation, or a tilted sample position with no substrate rotation. The GaInSb layers were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using both symmetrical and asymmetrical reflections. The \"tilted sample method\" gave a variation of Â±25% in thickness of the Ga 1-xIn xSb layers, while the indium (In) content varied by Â±10% around the nominal value. The disappearance of thickness fringes in 004 XRD scans was used to determine the onset of relaxation, as determining the in-plane lattice constant for tilted samples was found to be difficult. Determining residual strain in samples grown by the tilted method was likewise found to be very difficult. The critical thickness for several In mole fractions between 5% and 19% was determined and was found to be from 2.2 to 2.7 times higher than predicted by Matthews and Blakeslee (1974) [J.

The quantitative comparison of the measurement time using one and two-detector mode is done. The time range for experiments was from several minutes up to 12 hours. It was shown that two-detector system shortens more than twice the time of the measurement. While making a structural investigation using advanced software the two-detector system allows to treat the data at a qualitatively new level. An example illustrating the features of the channels choice and measurement time on the spectrometer was shown.

Results have shown that: (1) The advantageous changes of upper-level large-scale circulation caused the appearance and maintenance of the coupling between the upper-level jet (ULJ) and lower-level jet (LLJ) over the cycloneâs area. The coupling of jets in this case possesses some different characteristics from previous cases. Moreover, the coupling between the ULJ and LLJ caused the intensification of both lower-level convergence and upper-level divergence, which was favorable for the development of this cyclone. (2) From the analysis of the voricity budget, the role of lower-level convergence in the development of the cyclone was emphasized. Divergent wind in the lower troposphere was a direct contributor to the development of the cyclone. (3) During the development of the cyclone, cold air and warm air were active over the cycloneâs domain. Although this cyclone occurred at the mei-yu (Baiu) front, its development assumed baroclinity to a certain extent, which was just the main difference between this kind of cyclone and the first kind of low which is usually barotropic (or quasi-barotropic). (4) In recent years, studies on mei-yu front lows have paid more attention to the lower troposphere. In this paper, the analysis of the energy budget further supports this point: the certain effect of baroclinity forcing in the upper troposphere on mei-yu front lows cannot be ignored.\n\nChina Report: Political, Sociological and Military Affairs.

As part of a multi-telescope campaign to measure visible and infrared spectra and photometry, we obtained mid-infrared (approx. 8 to 22 micron) photometry and spectroscopy of 2005 YU55 using Michelle on the Gemini North telescope on UT November 9 and 10,2011. An extensive radar campaign together with optical light-curves established the rotation state of YU55. In addition, the radar imaging resulted in a shape model for the asteroid, detection of numerous boulders on its surface, and a preliminary estimate of its equatorial diameter at 380 +/- 20 m. In a preliminary analysis, applying the radar and lightcurve-derived parameters to a rough-surface thermophysical model fit to the Gemini/Michelle thermal emission photometry results in a thermal inertia range of approximately 500 to 1500 J/sq m/0.5s/K, with the low-thermal-inertia solution corresponding to the small end of the radar size range and vice versa. Updates to these results will be presented and modeling of the thermal contribution to the measured near-infrared spectra from Palomar/Triplespec and IRTF/SpeX will also be discussed.\n\nSurface and bulk effects of K in Cu 1-xK xIn 1-yGa ySe 2 solar cells\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMuzzillo, Christopher P.; Anderson, Timothy J.\n\n2017-12-29\n\nTwo strategies for enhancing photovoltaic (PV) performance in chalcopyrite solar cells were investigated: Cu 1-xK xIn 1-yGa ySe 2 absorbers with low K content (K/(K+Cu), or x ~ 0.07) distributed throughout the bulk, and CuIn 1-yGa ySe 2 absorbers with KIn 1-yGa ySe 2 grown on their surfaces. Distributing K throughout the bulk absorbers improved power conversion efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) for Ga/(Ga+In) of 0, 0.3 and 0.5.

On the other hand, y ~ 1 absorbers did not benefit from K introduction. Similar to Cu 1-xK xInSe 2, the formation of Cu 1-xK xGaSe 2 alloys was favored at low temperatures and high Na supply by the substrate, relative to the formation of mixed-phase CuGaSe 2 + KGaSe 2. KIn 1-yGa ySe 2 alloys were grown for the first time, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. For all Ga/(Ga+In) compositions, the surface KIn 1-yGa ySe 2 absorbers had superior PV performance in buffered and buffer-free devices. However, the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers only outperformed the baselines in buffered devices. The data demonstrate that KIn 1-yGa ySe 2 passivates the surface of CuIn 1-yGa ySe 2 to increase efficiency, VOC, and FF, while bulk Cu 1-xK xIn 1-yGa ySe 2 absorbers with x ~ 0.07 enhance efficiency, VOC, and FF by some other mechanism.Â«Â less\n\nSurface and bulk effects of K in Cu 1-xK xIn 1-yGa ySe 2 solar cells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMuzzillo, Christopher P.; Anderson, Timothy J.\n\nTwo strategies for enhancing photovoltaic (PV) performance in chalcopyrite solar cells were investigated: Cu 1-xK xIn 1-yGa ySe 2 absorbers with low K content (K/(K+Cu), or x ~ 0.07) distributed throughout the bulk, and CuIn 1-yGa ySe 2 absorbers with KIn 1-yGa ySe 2 grown on their surfaces.

For chaos detection, we have calculated maximum Lyapunov exponents for various values of fractional order. Feedback control method is then used to control chaos in the system. Further, the system is synchronized with itself and with fractional order financial system using active control technique.

We formulate a scattering approach to this problem and reduce the effects of disorder to two contributions: disorder-induced normal reflection and a random phase of the amplitude for Andreev reflection. We find that both of these are small even for moderate amounts of disorder. In the dirty limit in which the disorder-induced mean free path is smaller than the superconducting coherence length, the variance of the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state remains small in the ratio of the Fermi wavelength and the mean free path. This effect is more pronounced in three dimensions, where only impurities within a few Fermi wavelengths of the magnetic scatterer contribute. In two dimensions the energy variance is larger by a logarithmic factor because impurities contribute up to a distance of the order of the superconducting coherence length.\n\nThe Near-Earth Encounter of Asteroid 308635 (2005 YU55): Thermal IR Observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLim, Lucy F.; Emery, J.

This work led to the tentative identification of 71 phenolic compounds consisting of kaempferol 3-O-diglucoside-7-O-glucoside derivatives, isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside-7-O-glucoside hydroxycinnamoyl gentiobioses, hydroxycinnamoylmalic acids, and hydroxycinnamoylquinic acids. Ten of the compounds, 3-O-diacyltriglucoside-7-O-glucosides of kaempferol and quercetin, had not been previously reported. The phenolic component profiles of these vegetables were significantly different than those of the leafy vegetables from B. oleracea. This is the first comparative study of these leafy vegetables. Ten of the vegetables had never been previously studied by LC-MS.

The focus of the study is to demonstrate how a contaminated food source can affect the growth and development of permanent teeth germ in children. A sporadic outbreak of a peculiar skin disease was reported in Japan in October of 1968. An epidemiological study revealed the outbreak of this disease was caused by contaminated Kanemi rice oil. This episode of rice oil poisoned with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) was the first reported outbreak of PCB poisoning in the world. A second episode occurred in central Taiwan elevenmoreÂ Â» years after the Japanese episode. Registered data from the Taiwan Provincial Government Health Department reported 1,843 cases in 1980. Of this group, more than 800 women were child-bearing age and most of these women would or soon would be married and pregnant. The offsprings of these women were in danger, because it has been proven that PCB intoxication could affect the fetus. These babies, only contaminated through the placenta, are called PCB transplacental Yusho babies in Japan and PCB transplacental Yu-Cheng babies in Taiwan. Babies with PCB poisoning could have Fetal PCB syndrome (FPS) and may have retarded eruption of permanent teeth and other anomalies such as reduced numbers of teeth and abnormal shaped roots. The study of transplacental Yu-Cheng babies is an important public health issue for Taiwan.

Jian) with graded levels of dietary choline (165-1820Â mg/kg diet) for 65 days. The results firstly showed that choline deficiency induced inflammatory infiltration in the proximal intestine (PI), mid intestine (MI) and distal intestine (DI) of fish. Meanwhile, compared with the optimal choline group, choline deficiency decreased the activities of lysozyme and acid phosphatase, contents of complement 3 and IgM in the intestine, downregulated the mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A and defensin-3 in the PI and MI, LEAP-2B and hepcidin in the PI, MI and DI), anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) 10 and transforming growth factor Î²2 in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecule IÎºB in the PI, MI and DI; while upregulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6a and tumor necrosis factor Î± in the MI and DI, interferon Î³2b in the PI and MI, IL-1Î² and IL-6b in the PI, MI and DI), and signaling molecules (Toll-like receptor 4 in the MI, myeloid differentiation primary response 88 in the PI and MI, Janus kinase 3 and tyrosine kinase 2 in the MI and DI, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 4 and STAT5 in the PI, MI and DI) of juvenile Jian carp, further indicating that choline deficiency caused inflammation and immunity depression in the intestine of fish. But choline deficiency decreased the PI IL-6a mRNA level, and increased the DI LEAP-2A and defensin-3 mRNA levels with unknown reasons. Furthermore, dietary choline deficiency downregulated mRNA levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin 3c in the PI and MI, claudin 7, claudin 11 and occludin in the PI, MI and DI) and signaling molecule mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 in the PI, MI and DI of juvenile Jian carp, whereas\n\nOrbital Picture of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov Multiplets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeinrich, Benjamin W.; Ruby, Michael; Franke, Katharina J.; Peng, Yang; von Oppen, Felix\n\nMagnetic impurities on an s-wave superconductor induce Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states within the excitation gap of the superconductor. Here, we investigate single manganese (Mn) atoms adsorbed on different surface orientations of superconducting lead (Pb) and the nature of their YSR states. Depending on the adsorption site and surface, we detect a distinct number and characteristic patterns of YSR states around the Mn atoms. We show that the YSR states inherit their properties from the Mn d levels, which are split by the surrounding crystal field. The periodicity of the long-range YSR oscillations allows us to identify a dominant coupling of the d states to the outer Fermi sheet of the two-band superconductor Pb. The long-range and directional nature of the states are promising for the design of coupled adatom structures, which could bear topological phases.

JLJOL was given to the chronic bronchitis mice model (induced by smoking) through gastrogavage, and then SOD activity and MDA content were tested. SOD activity in model mice after JLJOL treatment was 0.67 +/- 0.15 NU/L, which was significantly higher than that in the untreated model (0.39 +/- 0.13 NU/L, P < 0.01). But the MDA content in treated mice was significantly lower than that in untreated one (9.26 +/- 2.90 nmol/L vs 16.07 +/- 5.62 nmol/L, P < 0.01). JLJOL could scavenge the injury of free radical on organism.\n\nIntestinal immune responses of Jian carp against Aeromonas hydrophila depressed by choline deficiency: Varied change patterns of mRNA levels of cytokines, tight junction proteins and related signaling molecules among three intestinal segments.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Pei; Liu, Yang; Jiang, Wei-Dan; Jiang, Jun; Zhang, Yong-An; Zhou, Xiao-Qiu; Feng, Lin\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the effects of choline deficiency on intestinal inflammation of fish after Aeromonas hydrophila infection and the potential molecular mechanisms. Juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) were fed two diets containing choline at 165 (deficient group) and 607Â mg/kg diet respectively for 65 days. Choline deficiency decreased intestinal lysozyme activity, C3 and IgM contents, increased acid phosphatase activity, downregulated mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides [liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin and defensin], cytokines [interleukin (IL) 6a, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), interferon Î³2b (IFN-Î³2b), IL-6b and transforming growth factor Î²2 (TGF-Î²2) only in proximal intestine, IL-10 in mid and distal intestine], immune-related signaling molecules [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), inhibitor of NF-ÎºB (IÎºB), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5)], tight junction proteins (claudin 3b, claudin 3c, claudin 11 and occludin), and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 (p38 MAPK ) in proximal and distal intestine of juvenile Jian carp after A.Â hydrophila challenge. In contrast, choline deficiency upregulated mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (LEAP-2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin and defensin), cytokines (IL-6b, IFN-Î³2b and TGF-Î²2), immune-related signaling molecules (TLR4, MyD88, NF-ÎºB, IÎºB, JAK3, STAT4 in three intestinal segments, and STAT6), claudin 11, and p38 MAPK in mid intestine of fish. This study provides new finding that choline deficiency-induced immune responses against A.Â hydrophila infection were varied among three intestinal segments in fish. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A validated and sensitive method via ultra fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) was established to simultaneously determinate five phenolic acids and four diterpenoids in rats in order to investigate their pharmacokinetic profiles firstly. Analytes were extracted by ethyl acetate and determined via multiple reaction monitoring mode in both positive and negative ion modes. The values for limit of quantification were in range of 0.025-1.250ng/ml. Inter- and intra-day precisions were no more than 10.9% with accuracy of -11.0%-10.6%, meanwhile the stable and suitable extraction recoveries were also obtained. And finally such excellent method was used to compare the pharmacokinetics of nine compounds in normal and acute blood stasis rats after oral administration of Guan-Xin-Shu-Tong capsules.
