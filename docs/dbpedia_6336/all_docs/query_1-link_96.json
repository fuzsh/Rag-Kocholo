Most of it has been painstakingly gathered, often from obscure and difficultto-access Russian archival sources, and many of the books cited have been written by highly respected academics who have devoted a lifetime to ground-breaking Stalinist historical research. In so doing, they have, collectively, opened up an endlessly fascinating but also highly contentious debate. Latterly, the field of Stalinist studies has been further complicated by a new and radical revisionist approach, much of which is contained in complex and exhausting arguments over facts, figures, and statistics.While so much serious research is stimulating public awareness about Stalin’s rule and constantly throwing up new evidence, it does not necessarily always make for easy or entertaining reading. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the economic and political chaos that have since unfolded in Russia have only served further to fuel the Stalinist debate and to bring to the fore a new generation of Stalinists both inside and outside Russia. It is the intention of this text, therefore, to provide a description of some of the most fundamental aspects of Stalin and of the political system that he instituted, in a form that is accessible not just to the Russianist or Russian student, but also to the lay reader who probably does not speak the language and knows and understands little about the life and times of Joseph Stalin. In so doing, it aims, deliberately, to move away from an emphasis on the complex political\n\naspects of Stalin’s rule (and there are plenty of scholarly tomes in print that already do this in exhaustive detail), toward an accent on the personal and an interpretation of some of the ways in which the lives of Russian people—both the population at large as well as some of Stalin’s more famous victims—were shaped and affected by thirty-five years of Stalinist rule.The further reading lists that follow most entries are therefore limited to English-language sources that should be reasonably easily available through most good public and university libraries. Each entry has been written so that it can be read in isolation and is cross-referenced to associated entries that might also be of interest. A particular objective has been to locate entries within the general social and political context and sometimes to relate aspects of Stalin’s life and rule by allusion to literature and history outside the Soviet Union. For this reason, and knowing from personal experience how baffling the reader can find books on Soviet history that are littered with unpronounceable and incomprehensible acronyms (of which there are a tedious excess in the Stalin period), a particular effort has been made to spare the reader from the inevitable confusion that these terms create. Brief definitions for those acronyms that are used can be found in the glossary at the end of the book. Inevitably, the list of entries is very highly selective, and some difficult decisions have had to be made about who and what to leave out. A general rule of thumb has been to exclude those people and events that do not strictly fall within Stalin’s years in power, i.e., after about 1928, unless they have a specific bearing on either Stalin the\n\nxiii\n\nman, his personal experiences, or his policies. By the same token, the biographies of those people who are included do not attempt a dry recitation of places, events, and dates in chronological order, but focus on that person’s particular relationship with or experience of Stalin and Stalinism. Some of the people and topics missing from the headword list are touched upon within some existing entries; others have a brief definition in the glossary at the end of the book. In the case of political or other issues, the entry is again slanted in terms of Stalin’s particular interpretation of or perspective on them. In general, though, it is hoped that the book contains a representative cross-section of Soviet arts, politics, science, and culture during Stalin’s lifetime; that it covers some of the key aspects of his policies; and that it also explains the most famous catchphrases and slogans associated with him.\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nWith this objective in mind and in the firm belief that, as Emerson said, “there is properly no history; only biography,” what follows has been grounded in an interpretation of the personal experience of events in an attempt to come to grips with the motivations behind individual behavior. The most gratifying end, for any author who tries to explain controversial historical events instinctively and on a more personal level, is that the text will in some small way entertain and inform the lay reader or interested student of Russia who wishes to know more about a hugely complex man and, in so doing, help them make some sense of one of the most impenetrably difficult periods in Soviet political history. Helen Rappaport September 1999\n\nJoseph Stalin A Biographical Companion\n\nA Agriculture See Collectivization; Five-Year Plans.\n\nAkhmatova, Anna Andreevna (1889–1966)\n\nO\n\nne of the great Russian poets and a national heroine, Anna Akhmatova (née Gorenko) is now venerated outside Russia as a major poetic voice of the twentieth century. She seemed born to endure great tragedy in her life and indeed was one of Stalin’s most long-suffering literary victims. Her tremendous will to survive, in her self-appointed role as a witness of the Great Terror, testifies to huge inner reserves of moral strength that sustained her through years of extreme poverty and isolation, to ultimately become a latter-day nemesis of the dark days of Stalinism. As one of the promising young literati in prerevolutionary St. Petersburg, Akhmatova became a leading voice of the Silver Age of Russian poetry, with her collections such as Evening (1912) and Rosary (1914). She briefly embraced the Acmeist group of poets, led by Nikolay Gumilev (1886– 1921), whom she married in 1910 (they divorced in 1918). But her lyrical verses, with their confessional style detailing the pain of love, resisted literary compartmentalization\n\nand she went her own way artistically, with the more impressionistic The White Flock of 1917. Her individualism survived the early days of foment in Soviet literature, when literary experimentation was for a short while tolerated, but her work was soon looked upon as insufficiently socialist in its concerns and was suppressed as “bourgeois” after the publication of her collection Anno Domini MCMXXI in 1922. It was the appearance of this work that prompted the eminent Soviet literary critic Boris Eichenbaum to famously deride Akhmatova as “half nun, half harlot” (an epithet later reprised by Andrey Zhdanov in the campaign against Akhmatova in the 1940s). But greater personal tragedy now began to haunt her, with the arrest and execution of Gumilev in 1921 (on fabricated charges of “counterrevolutionary activity”), and the arrest of their son, Lev, in 1934. Although Akhamatova had ceased publishing by the mid-1920s, condemned, in the words of the Literary Encyclopedia of 1929, as “a poetess of the aristocracy who has not found a new function in capitalist society,” like many other out-of-favor writers she continued to write and bear witness in private, composing an eloquent cycle of poetry, Requiem, on the years of the Great Terror “when only the dead / smiled, happy in their peace. . . . and innocent Russia squirmed / under the bloody boots, / under the wheels of black Marias.” Akhmatova, Anna Andreevna\n\n1\n\nThe poet Anna Akhmatova at the height of her beauty in the 1920s. Akhmatova suffered constant persecution under Stalin, but outlived him to commemorate the victims of the Great Terror in her poetry cycle Requiem.\n\nDuring the war (and possibly on the prompting of his daughter Svetlana, who loved Akhmatova’s poetry), Stalin allowed Akhmatova to republish a collection of her work From Six Books, only to summarily order its withdrawal a few weeks after publication. However, ordinary Russians overcame the virtual impossibility of obtaining Akhmatova’s verse in print by circulating it orally among themselves. This had always been a method of preserving the work of proscribed Russian writers, and Akhmatova’s (like Boris Pasternak’s) poetry was memorized by civilians and soldiers alike. Indeed, Akhmatova received many letters from Soviet soldiers at the front, requesting her autograph, often asking her to confirm the text of poetry that had been circulated only in samizdat (the illegal underground press) form.A trickle of Akhmatova’s work, mainly as a translator, did begin to appear in\n\n2\n\nAkhmatova, Anna Andreevna\n\nsome journals, but the persecution began again in 1946. This new campaign may have been due in part to a long night she spent, in November 1945, in conversation at her apartment in Leningrad with an English diplomat, Isaiah Berlin (later to become renowned as a historian of ideas), during which she talked about her life and work and discussed with him the state of the arts in Russia.With the Soviet Union now rapidly distancing itself from its wartime Western allies and the Cold War looming, this meeting became the cause of much suspicion and ludicrous accusations of treachery made against Akhmatova for talking to a “British spy.” Her apartment was bugged, her every move monitored. It was revealed in 1993 that the authorities had kept detailed files on Akhmatova since 1939, amounting to some 900 pages of “denunciations, reports of phone taps, quotations from writings, confession of those close to her.” Nevertheless, Akhmatova survived this later onslaught with an arrogant pride, and her powerful presence in Russian literature continued to make itself felt despite her virtual incarceration in her Leningrad apartment. In 1946 she was persuaded to venture back into public life and appear at a poetry reading in Moscow with Pasternak. The rapturous welcome given her sealed her fate.Word had already got back to Stalin of the excess of public adulation accorded Akhmatova at a brief public reading she had made in 1944. He is reported to have asked, incredulous at such an outpouring of love for the writer, “Who organized this standing ovation?” With the end of the war, the relaxation of censorship in the arts that had briefly prevailed began to evaporate, and Akhmatova and the writer Mikhail Zoschenko were singled out as the target of a concerted renewal of literary fascism—initiated by the head of the Leningrad Communist Party, Andrey Zhdanov. On Stalin’s behalf,\n\nhe launched a virulent vendetta against Akhmatova and Zoschenko in August 1946, designed to once again tighten the political screws on writers with supposed “bourgeois” tendencies and to bring the literary establishment as a whole back into line. But nothing, it seemed, could destroy Akhmatova’s dogged determination to transcend the nightmare of Stalinism in order one day to reveal its horrors. As her friend Nadezhda Mandelstam described her, “she was the stern and overbearing abbess of a convent in which the rules were strict to a fault and all sins had to be atoned for.” Her poetry cycle, Requiem, which she wrote between 1935 and 1940, was eventually published in 1963. It conveys not just the harrowing atmosphere of the Great Terror but also her own personal experience of it.Through all the years of persecution, her only artistic compromise, brought on by her desperation to get her son out of the Gulag, had been to write, in 1950, a trite cycle of verses,“In Praise of Peace,” lauding Stalin as “The true master of life, / The sovereign of mountains and rivers.” In the end, Akhmatova outlived Stalin, to see the account settled with the process of de-Stalinization introduced by Nikita Khrushchev and the release of political prisoners. In March 1956, she remarked to her friend Lydia Chukovskaya: “Each of our lives is a Shakespearean drama raised to the thousandth degree. Mute separations, mute black, bloody events in every family. Invisible mourning worn by mothers and wives. Now the arrested are returning, and two Russias stare each other in the eyes: the ones that put them in prison and the ones who were put in prison. A new epoch has begun.You and I will wait for it together.” Two months later, her son Lev was finally released from the Gulag.

But he discounted this idea as being impractical, feeling that he needed the kind of wife able to mix socially with the intellectual elite and top political cadres of the new government—someone who could hold her own with women such as Lenin’s bluestocking wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. While staying in Petrograd with his friend Sergey Alliluyev, Stalin found the solution to his problem in Alliluyev’s young daughter Nadezhda, a meek, compliant girl who seemed, as yet, untainted. She also had the right political pedigree, being the daughter of a fellow revolutionary and the goddaughter of Stalin’s countryman, the prominent Bolshevik Abel Enukhidze. Stalin soon prevailed on the sixteen-year-old Nadezhda, who was no doubt star-struck by his reputation as being one of those who had made the revolution, to travel to Moscow with him as his personal assistant at the Commissariat of Nationalities. At some stage that summer Stalin and Nadezhda’s relationship became a sexual one, probably against her Allilueva, Nadezhda Sergeevna\n\n3\n\nwill, and they were married in 1919 at the Tsaritsyn front, where Stalin had been sent to take charge of Bolshevik food supplies during the civil war against the Whites. Five months after the marriage was officially registered in Moscow, Nadezhda gave birth to a son,Vasily, followed by a daughter, Svetlana, in 1926. Despite the birth of her children, Nadezhda had been keen to assert her independence and escape the stultifying life of a Party wife shut up in the Kremlin. She had joined Lenin’s Secretariat as one of his assistants, where she developed a close relationship with both him and his wife. After the birth of Svetlana, Nadezhda spent more and more time with the children and other members of her family at the family dacha at Zubalovo south of Moscow. With Stalin now ensconced for longer and longer hours in his Kremlin office, Nadezhda increasingly came to feel herself the neglected wife, and violent rows—often aggravated by Stalin’s heavy drinking and rumors of his womanizing—began regularly to erupt between the couple. In 1926 Nadezhda’s attempt to leave Stalin failed and during his turbulent power struggle with Trotsky and the Left opposition in the Communist Party, she became increasingly isolated and depressed. Bored and lonely and desperate to do something useful, Nadezhda enrolled as a chemistry student at Moscow’s new Industrial Academy in 1929 in order to train as an engineer. On 8 November 1932, the day after a party in the Kremlin held to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the revolution, during which Stalin had flirted with the wife of a colleague, and he and Nadezhda had had an argument, Nadezhda was found dead from a gunshot wound. Immediately the cover-up of her suicide began; the Party announced her death, but not its circumstances; her children were told she had died of appendicitis. A grand state funeral was mounted with all due solemnity, featuring a Red Army band playing Chopin’s “Funeral\n\n4\n\nAllilueva, Nadezhda Sergeevna\n\nMarch” and with the hearse pulled by “four black horses, tasselled and garnished with red, with all the leaders of the government walking five-abreast the half mile to the cemetery.” Stalin, who had led the mourners, wearing grey not black, failed to appear at the graveside for Nadezhda’s burial. Paranoid about possible assassination attacks, he had left the funeral cortege after covering only a short distance. After her death, rumors began to circulate that Nadezhda had either been murdered by Stalin in a fit of rage, or by others on his orders, or that she had killed herself as a result of his increasingly intolerable behavior toward her. In terms of a propensity for fits of jealousy and fierce temper, Nadezhda had certainly been Stalin’s equal. There had been plenty of talk about her histrionic behavior, that she was a bit “mad” and wildly jealous over Stalin’s supposed relations with other women; others more sensibly observed that Nadezhda, a passionate and committed socialist, was in fact profoundly disillusioned with Stalin as a political leader and with his policies, such as the collectivization program. According to one close friend, Stalin had drunkenly alleged during their row at the party in the Kremlin just before her death that Nadezhda was in fact his own daughter; her mother, a Georgian, had indeed had lovers, including Stalin, around the time she conceived Nadezhda in 1901.This insinuation, whether or not it was true, may well have unhinged Nadezhda in the final desperate hours leading up to her suicide. In any event, with her mental state becoming increasingly unstable, it is likely, had she lived, that Stalin would have inevitably found it expedient to rid himself of her. Stalin himself remained bitter and angry at her death, commenting, on the day of her funeral, that “she went away as an enemy.” Although he later went through some ritual breast-beating over his neglect of her, in private he persisted in laying the blame, as he did with all his own shortcomings and\n\nfailures, at the doors of others. But the person who continued to hold a real corner of his heart was his first wife, Ekaterina. Occasional, flimsy rumors of other women after Nadezhda’s death have been circulated since, but Stalin never remarried. He did, however, mete out his revenge on the Alliluyev family during the Great Terror: Nadezhda’s sister Anna was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1948; her husband was shot in 1938; her brother’s and uncle’s wives were both imprisoned, as was her nephew.

London: Hutchinson, 1967.\n\nAllilueva, Svetlana Iosefovna (1926–)\n\nI\n\nn 1967, the name of Joseph Stalin, for some time excised from the popular consciousness inside and outside the Soviet Union, was suddenly in the newspapers again after the defection to the West of his daughter Svetlana Allilueva and the subsequent publication of her powerful memoir Twenty Letters to a Friend (1967). The contents of that memoir and the story of Svetlana’s subsequent unsettled life in the West testify to a life dogged by the shadow of her troubled parentage. It was not until she was fifteen years old that Svetlana accidentally found out about the true fate of her mother, Nadezhda, who had died in 1932. The young Svetlana had been told that her mother had died of appendicitis, but, in an English magazine given to her in the winter of 1941, she read that her mother’s death had been suicide. Until then she had lived a closed, protected life, first at the Kremlin, and after her mother’s death, at the family\n\ndacha at Zubalovo. Svetlana had always been happiest here and on holidays in the Crimea, surrounded by an extended family of Alliluyev relations and visitors such as the Ordzhonikidzes, the Bukharins, and the Voroshilovs. But everything changed after her mother’s death, and Allilueva’s memoir describes a life of increasing alienation from her father, while at the same time providing the first revealing commentary to reach the West on the working of Stalin’s mind and his increasingly obsessive behavior. She also details the sterility of Stalin’s private life during his final years, the futile evenings spent at the dacha at Kuntsevo drinking until dawn, his rejection of creature comforts, and the grotesque farce of his final illness and death. There is no doubt about Stalin’s affection for Svetlana, his favorite child. His many touching and affectionate letters to her testify to that, and it was not until she became a woman and fell in love for the first time that she encountered the darker side to his nature, and their relationship began to change. During the war, at a party thrown by her brother Vasily at the family dacha at Zubalovo, Svetlana (then only sixteen years old) met the forty-year-old film director and script writer Alexis Kapler. While not in the least physically attractive, Kapler was a clever man and a great conversationalist, and the impressionable young Svetlana was swept off her feet. Their few encounters— walks, trips to the cinema and art galleries—were closely monitored by Stalin’s agents, who also gave him transcripts of all their telephone conversations. A furious Stalin soon found the excuse for getting Kapler out of the way by condemning him as an “English spy” after he was spotted fraternizing with foreign journalists. Kapler was sent into exile for five years and a further term of five years of exile after that was completed. After the affair with Kapler, Svetlana became estranged from her father. In 1944, while a student at Moscow University, she Allilueva, Svetlana Iosefovna\n\n5\n\nSecret police chief Lavrenty Beria clutches an uneasy-looking Svetlana Stalin on his knee at Stalin’s Kuntsevo dacha in 1936. Stalin can be seen reading and smoking his pipe in the background.\n\nmarried Jewish fellow-student Grigory Morozov, but they divorced in 1947, not long after the birth of a son, Josef. She tried to patch up her relationship with Stalin by marrying again in 1949 to Yury Zhdanov, the son of top Party bureaucrat Andrey Zhdanov, a man of whom she thought Stalin would approve.The couple, who had a daughter, Katya, divorced in 1952. Svetlana’s third husband was Indian Communist Brajesh Singh. When he died in 1966 she was allowed an exit visa to travel to India with his ashes. But she did not return to the Soviet Union and defected in Rome, leaving her children behind in the Soviet Union. She settled in Princeton, New Jersey, in April 1967, where she wrote Only One Year (1969), about her life in the Soviet Union and the aftereffects of her defection. In the West, as the daughter of a major Soviet political figure, Allilueva was feted by the intellectual glitterati and was frequently interviewed on televi-\n\n6\n\nAllilueva, Svetlana Iosefovna\n\nsion and in the press. Not long after settling in the United States, Allilueva became a U.S. citizen. She had a fourth, short-lived marriage to American architect William Peters, by whom she had a daughter, Olga, in 1971. In the years that followed, Allilueva underwent a profound religious conversion, and it was for this reason that she moved to England in 1982 in order to send her daughter to a Quaker school. With the improving political climate in the Soviet Union, Allilueva decided to return in 1984, but her now thoroughly Westernized daughter, who spoke no Russian, hated it there. They had been obliged to settle, with considerable unease but away from public scrutiny, in Stalin’s own home country of Georgia. But two years later Allilueva and her daughter left Tbilisi, where they had been living, and returned to the United States. Her stay proved brief, and she moved again to England, determined to keep the press from her door.

The Russian avant-garde in art was particularly successful in capturing the immediacy of so much tumultuous change, with artists eager to find new ways of depicting the modern world with its emphasis on social change and scientific advances. Much of Soviet experimental art in its early days was spawned by the antiaesthetic movement known as Constructivism. This was inspired by the Cubist and Futurist movements in art, with their preference for geometric shapes and the Constructivists’ use of glass, plastic, metal, particularly aluminum, and other mass-produced materials that reflected the technology of the new Soviet machine age. The Constructivists’ Manifesto of 1920 emphasized their objective as being to construct a form of art that was socially directed, an art form that manifested the utopian aspirations of socialism rather than the small-scale preoccupations of the personal and contemplative in other, more traditional art forms. The basic principles of this functionalist approach, which came to be nicknamed “laboratory art,” were applied equally and to striking effect\n\nin industrial design, in architecture, in utilitarian furniture, textiles, and ceramics, as well as stage, poster, and graphic design, through its major exponents El Lissitzky, Vladimir Tatlin, Varvara Stepanova, Lyubov Popova, and Alexander Rodchenko. But this flourishing artistic climate of diversity began to change in the 1920s, and the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia, established in 1922, began to gain ascendancy with its demands for a Soviet brand of revolutionary realism to which all artists should conform and depict the present day along prescribed lines. Increasing accusations of formalism and decadence began to affect the Constructivists who had embraced the enthusiasm for new forms in their various and idiosyncratic ways. Individualists and experimenters in art were now marginalized in favor of a return to the bland, traditional forms of realist art—as epitomized by the vast canvases of the nineteenth-century school of Russian painters known as the “wanderers” (Ilya Repin, Stalin’s favorite, had famously depicted Ivan the Terrible and other notable historical figures). In 1932 Stalin imposed his will across the Soviet arts with the Party decree putting an end to all independent and fringe groups in favor of a single, all-embracing union that would ensure the suppression of all forms of purely subjective art. For under socialist realism, such forms were now superfluous and an indulgent luxury. Art was not a spiritual pursuit; it had one function—to serve the working class and, to do so, it should take its inspiration from real, everyday life. In the early days after the revolution, several émigré artists, including Marc Chagall, Wassily Kandinsky, and the sculptor Naum Gabo had returned to Russia, eager to find a new role for themselves. But within a few years, this situation was reversed. Throughout the 1920s, the hemorrhage of avantgarde artists leaving the Soviet Union seemed unstoppable. El Lissitsky (who went abroad 1921–1928), Naum Gabo (1922), Art and Architecture\n\n7\n\nVera Mukhina’s famous celebration of the New Soviet Man in her stainless steel sculpture The Worker and the Collective Farm Girl, specially created to top the Soviet pavilion at the 1937 Paris World Exhibition.\n\nKandinsky (1921), Chagall (1923), sculptor Antoine Pevsner (1923), and painter and designer Aleksandra Exter (1924) were among the many artists who felt they no longer had a place in the new culture. Many figures from the old avant-garde who stayed spent the rest of their lives languishing in obscurity, unable to exhibit or sell their work. One such figure was the Suprematist painter Kasimir Malevich, best known for his minimalist abstract works of 1918–1919, such as White Square on White and Black Square. Under Stalin, Malevich was condemned for his ideological alienation and was banned from exhibiting after his last one-man show in 1929 (although by 1922 and under increasing ideological pressure, he had all but abandoned painting, turning to writing and lecturing on art). Now living in a state of increasing penury, Malevich attempted his own interpretation of socialist realism by painting traditional, figurative subjects but in featureless Suprematist shapes and colors, creating an unsettling end product that, in the words of one critic, inspired “a kind of metaphysical terror.” On his death in 1935, Malevich was rescued from obscurity and given an official lying in state at the Leningrad Artist’s Union, followed by burial in a coffin made from one of his own Suprematist designs. Those major figures, primarily Tatlin and Rodchenko, who adapted by emphasizing the link between the arts and industry in their work, turned increasingly to design in posters, photo montages, theater sets and costumes. Tatlin had attracted attention in 1919–1920 with his design for the Monument to the Third International. This steel structure, projected to rise like a leaning spire to a greater height than the Eiffel Tower, had been the subject of considerable controversy but never got further than its twenty-two-foot model. From the late 1920s Tatlin spent several years working on a prototype wooden glider, the “Letatlin” (a pun of his name, based on the Russian verb letat “to fly”), but when this eccentric proj-\n\nect failed, he turned increasingly to theatrical design. As for Rodchenko, probably the most internationally successful of all the artists of the Stalinist period, he had proclaimed the death of art in 1928, saying that “every modern cultured man must wage war against art as against opium. Photograph and be photographed.” It was Rodchenko’s choice of the photographic medium, as much as anything, that led to his considerable reputation abroad (a reputation that has now vastly inflated the value of his work). With his camera Rodchenko became the great exponent of Constructivism in photography, developing a style of reportage that celebrated the physical prowess of the new Soviet man and the achievements of industry, which, in so doing, served as the perfect Soviet propaganda vehicle in the West. Rodchenko’s imaginative use of perspective, shape, and shadow was also to influence Soviet filmmaking, in particular, the work of Sergey Eisenstein and the documentary filmmaker Dziga Vertov. In the field of conventional painting, meanwhile, experimentation had been completely stifled for anyone seeking to earn a living as an artist. Painters found themselves rapidly shackled to producing hackwork depicting the same old conventional subjects of happy tractor drivers on the collective farms or steelworkers toiling at blast furnaces. Their only other alternative was to add to the already inflated Stalinist hagiography by producing yet more idealized paintings of the Great Leader in variations on the same heroic pose: Stalin as tousle-haired revolutionary in Baku, Stalin learning revolution at the knee of Lenin, Stalin on the podium, Stalin at the tractor factory or the collective farm, and Stalin at his desk planning the future. Figurative painting suffered more than any other branch of Soviet art during this period and remained stranded in these stultifying doldrums until long after Stalin’s death. It is only thanks to the risks taken by numerous Art and Architecture\n\n9\n\nprivate art collectors in the Soviet Union, who bought the paintings of out-of-favor artists and hid them away in their apartments, that the work of some of the most important figures in the Soviet avant-garde during the 1920s and 1930s was saved from destruction. In 1930, Aleksey Shchusev’s striking Constructivist design for the new Lenin mausoleum (inspired, in part, by the recent discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen in Egypt) became the focal point for a major rebuilding program launched by Stalin in Moscow. Many buildings, including historic churches and old districts, such as the market area of Okhotnyi Ryad (Hunter’s Row), were blown up wholesale in order to open up Red Square for the big showpiece parades that would celebrate the achievements of communism. With the introduction of socialist realism in 1932, architects were forced to become part of a single Union of Soviet Architects and forced to abandon small-scale projects in favor of the grandiose Stalinist projects. Ambitious plans for the construction of vast monoliths, such as the Palace of the Soviets, obliged architects to attempt impractical designs that looked wonderful on paper but were financially (and probably structurally) unrealizable. As the Five-Year Plans placed greater and greater demands on industry throughout the 1930s, architects began to take second place to engineers in the realization of vast industrial complexes, dams, and hydroelectric stations and, increasingly, town planning. In this respect, the work of the Vesenin brothers Aleksandr, Leonid, and Viktor produced architectural landmarks such as the Dnieper Dam and industrial works at Zaporozhe, as well as urban development projects for workers, including that constructed around the Likhachev Car Works. With the acceleration of Soviet industrial output, living spaces for workers became of paramount importance, but homes could no longer be designed to serve individual taste. Housing was envisioned on an in-\n\n10\n\nArt and Architecture\n\ncreasingly vast scale with whole districts bulldozed and rebuilt as functional and structurally nondescript hangars for the communal necessities of eating and sleeping, all constructed to a precisely prescribed amount of living space per person. While many of the vast canvases of socialist realist art and, in particular, those depicting Stalin have now been relegated to the forgotten storerooms of Russia’s art galleries, the legacy of late Stalinist baroque architecture, popularly dubbed the “wedding-cake” style, is still evident in some of the former Soviet Union’s major cities. Perhaps the most familiar landmark is the imposing edifice of the thirty-six-story Moscow University, which began construction in 1945. This return to classical forms in architecture had been endorsed by People’s Commissar for Enlightenment Anatoly Lunacharsky, when he asserted in 1932 that “the workers, too, have a right to colonnades.” One of the most innovative and individual exponents of the Constructivist style in architecture was Konstantin Melnikov, famous for the design of several workingmen’s clubs in Moscow and the Soviet pavilion at the 1924 Paris exhibition. He also built his own extraordinary cylindrical house just off the famous Arbat in Moscow in 1927–1929, as a prototype for an unfulfilled housing development. But in the 1930s he came under increasing attack for his pseudorevolutionary innovationism, partly the result of official sour grapes at his considerable reputation abroad, and in 1936 he was expelled from the Union of Architects. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was a great rush to remove and destroy much of the monumental art erected to Stalin and other political luminaries of the years of Communist rule. One of the greatest and most enduring pieces of Soviet sculpture to survive this orgy of destruction was Vera Mukhina’s Worker and Collective Farm Girl, originally executed in stainless steel to grace the Soviet pavilion at\n\nthe Paris exhibition of 1937. Much admired by Stalin, it was one of the first recipients of the Stalin Prize for art in 1941. Mukhina’s work marked the apogee of Soviet triumphalism in sculpture with its powerful symbolic image of the farm girl and the industrial worker raising their hands holding the hammer and sickle aloft in defiant unison. So impressed was Stalin with Mukhina’s work that he made overtures for her to sculpt his portrait. Mukhina wisely evaded the honor by insisting on working from life, a request to which Stalin would not accede in his final, reclusive years.

Although Soviet scientists had been aware of the principles of nuclear fission, first described by Otto Frisch and Lise Meitner in 1939, no coordinated Soviet research into its potential was begun until 1940, when leading scientists had written to the then head of the Council of the Chemical and Metallurgical Industries Nikolay Bulganin, urging the government to initiate a research project. In July a com-\n\nmission attached to the Academy of Sciences was set up to do this and immediately found itself having to contend with the difficulties of obtaining sufficient uranium for conducting experiments. However, when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the energies of Soviet scientists were hastily redirected to the war effort, and the nuclear project was temporarily sidelined. While the Americans and British continued to take little account of what information they received on Soviet efforts to achieve nuclear fission, the Soviets themselves were, by the end of 1942, secretly being fed information on the British project by the MI5 double agent John Cairncross and later by Klaus Fuchs (a leading physicist who later worked at the Los Alamos project in the United States), as well as by other Soviet spies in the United States. The Soviet nuclear project was resumed in early 1943, during the defense of Stalingrad, with Stalin ordering the production of at least 100 tons of uranium during 1944–1945. It is unlikely, however, that he had the objective of, or any realistic hope for, its immediate use militarily against Germany. At this particular time he was still naive about the complexities of the bomb’s production, as well as its strategic potential, and was simply hedging his political bets in anticipation of the future, postwar balance of power in both military as well as technological terms. At the Potsdam Conference held at the end of the war in Europe, Stalin appeared to show little interest when President Truman hinted to him that America had a nuclear capability. But after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945, Stalin realized, with a jolt, the enormous power of such weapons, averring that the old political equilibrium had now been destroyed. He immediately ordered the renewal of Soviet research, telling the scientific director of the Soviet nuclear project Igor Kurchatov to spare no expense, “If a child doesn’t cry, the mother doesn’t know Atomic Bomb\n\n11\n\nwhat he needs. Ask for whatever you like. You won’t be refused.” The task of supervising the crucial intelligence gathering behind this research was given to Lavrenty Beria, head of the NKVD (secret police), while Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign minister, was put in overall charge of the project. Beria proved to be an outstanding organizer in this respect. It became incumbent upon Igor Kurchatov, however, to warn that the continuing repressive attitude to Soviet scientific research, aimed particularly in the area of genetics, was now turning its attention to physics. If such interference were allowed to spread into the nuclear project, there would be no Soviet bomb.As it was, the scientists warned Stalin that it would take five years to create their own bomb. Stalin, therefore, demanded that all kinds of risks be taken to speed up research. Scientists were forced to work, often inadequately protected, with untested radioactive materials. Many of those employed at the lower level of nuclear research were prisoners in the Gulag. During the war, Beria had set up special research centers, known as sharashi, to utilize the talents of the many scientists and technicians who had been imprisoned during the purges.All those involved were now threatened with the dire consequences of failure. Uranium extraction was made a top priority, with Stalin emphasizing that heavy industry and technology should take precedence over other economic demands and that all the state’s resources should be harnessed to the nuclear project.This came at a time when the country was struggling to cope with the terrible depredations of war. Despite this, the Soviet science budget was tripled, and scientists engaged in the nuclear project were given such special privileges as country dachas and various financial incentives. Soviet nuclear capability would be developed on a major scale at a special, hidden city known as “Arzamas–16,” which was built, at Stalin’s orders, by convict labor be-\n\n12\n\nAtomic Bomb\n\ntween 1946 and 1954 in a dense birch forest 300 miles east of Moscow.The convicts who built it were subsequently consigned to exile in a remote region on Russia’s northeastern Pacific coast, and it was not until after the collapse of communism that the existence of this closed city was actually revealed.The Soviets finally achieved a selfsustaining nuclear chain reaction and built their first production reactor in 1948 at a specially constructed site near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains.The first test explosion of a bomb designed by Yuly Khariton was made in Kazakhstan on 29 August 1949 and witnessed by Beria and Kurchatov. Several of the scientists directly involved in achieving this success within four years instead of the projected five years were decorated as heroes of socialist labor by Stalin. The Americans and British were taken by surprise by this event (they finally heard of it nearly four weeks later), having been told by the CIA that this event would not take place before mid-1953. Stalin himself later admitted to Kurchatov that “if we had been a year or a year and a half later with the atomic bomb, we would surely have felt it on ourselves.” During the Cold War, as both sides accelerated their nuclear programs, several eminent scientists such as Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer (who had run the U.S. project at Los Alamos), and Andrey Sakharov (the father of the Soviet H-bomb) all warned of the terrifying potential of the nuclear monster. Stalin, however, was delighted with his new-found nuclear capability. It opened the doors to a new kind of power-broking—“atomic diplomacy”—that helped him consolidate his control over Eastern Europe and place enormous political pressures on the West, while avoiding actual conflict. By 1951 the Soviets had created a device equal to that of the United States and Britain. On 12 August 1953, six months after Stalin’s death, they tested their first hydrogen bomb. Stalin’s successor, Nikita Khrushchev, took no heed of Sakharov’s\n\npleading that Soviet nuclear testing should cease, asserting bullishly that the bomb “should hang over the head of capitalists like a sword of Damocles.” During the Cuban Crisis in 1962, Khrushchev’s combative stance on nuclear weapons was instrumental in bringing the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe.\n\nFurther reading: Taylor Downing and Jeremy Isaacs.

Babel grew up in the old Jewish quarter of the cosmopolitan Black Sea port of Odessa. His stories of his childhood capture the atmosphere of a lost time and a lost community. Jewishness colored all his later work, despite the difficulties of being a Jew in Soviet Russia. For the early part of his life, too, Babel struggled with the paradox of being a pacific Jew who welcomed the spirit of the revolution, while rejecting the violence of things done in its name. He was forced to accept, in fact, as his Jewish narrator in Red Cavalry, Lyutov, asserts that the International “is eaten with gunpowder— and spiced with best-quality blood.”\n\nIn the heady days of Petrograd 1915– 1917, when he first started out as a writer, Babel wrote vivid naturalistic pieces for Maxim Gorky’s journal New Life, and Gorky, quick to spot Babel’s rare talent, nurtured it, urging him to go out and grasp hold of life and experience in order to become an even better writer. It was an exhortation familiar from his own childhood, when Babel’s grandmother, urging him to pay attention to his studies, had insisted, “You must know everything!” Indeed, Babel’s innate curiosity about life and people would lead to a lifelong compulsion to ferret out the unusual detail in everything and to turn such observation into brilliant metaphor in his stories. During World War I, Babel had been exempted from military service (he was shortsighted and suffered from asthma), but he nevertheless volunteered and briefly served on the Romanian front. After the revolution, Babel worked as an interpreter for the Cheka (forerunner of the NKVD) before taking a post as correspondent for the government news agency YugRosta in the spring of 1920. He was assigned (under the alias of Kirill Lyutov, a necessity at a time of anti-Semitic violence among Bolshevik troops) to the already legendary First Cavalry Army, commanded by the swashbuckling Semen Budenny. At that time the First Cavalry, which had been formed to counter Cossack units fighting for the Whites, was Babel, Isaac Emmanuilovich\n\n15\n\nThe writer Isaac Babel, from his secret police file after his arrest in May 1939, exhausted by interrogation and without his spectacles. He was shot in the Lubyanka prison in January 1940.\n\nunder the overall command of Stalin as political commissar of the southern front.The reputation of Budenny’s half-savage and fearless Cossack horsemen preceded them everywhere. Babel, the quiet-spoken, physically weak, intellectual Jew with glasses, could not help admiring their courage and physicality and found himself constantly an impotent and ambivalent witness to the senseless cruelties visited by them on the Jewish population of the shtetl (the Jewish villages of the Ukraine). By the time he moved to Moscow in 1924, Babel was being feted as one of the best writers of his day for his originality of style and subject matter. The early 1920s was a fertile period for him. He produced most of his best work, including the thirtyfour stories later published collectively as Red Cavalry, as well as a series of tales about his childhood and the Jewish gangsters of the Moldavanka ghetto of Odessa, later published as Odessa Tales (1931).The process\n\n16\n\nBabel, Isaac Emmanuilovich\n\nof writing was painfully slow for him. He was a perfectionist who wrote and rewrote, sometimes as many as twenty versions of a single story. He was compelled to earn a greater part of his living writing screenplays and working as a “script doctor,” producing several fine scripts, including Benya Krik the Gangster, based on his Odessan stories. (He later worked with the director Sergey Eisenstein on the ill-fated Bezhin Meadow, suppressed by the authorities in 1937.) But by the early 1930s Babel found it increasingly difficult to adopt the required ideological stance in his work and to write to the demands of socialist realism. He published less and less original work. At the First Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934, he spoke for many other oppressed writers when he jokingly admitted that “my respect for the reader is so great that I keep quiet and do not speak. I have been acknowledged as a great master in the art of silence.”\n\nWhat probably saved Babel for a while from the inevitable arrest, which finally came in 1939, was the continuing friendship and patronage of Maxim Gorky, but after Gorky’s death in 1936 Babel became increasingly vulnerable. He retreated to his dacha at Peredelkino, where he refused lucrative inducements to begin publishing again, averring that “creativity does not dwell in palaces.” He was arrested there on 15 May 1939. All his manuscripts were confiscated, and as they took him away, a bewildered and shaken Babel was heard to say, “They didn’t let me finish.” For fifteen years nothing was known of Babel’s fate. On his rehabilitation in late 1954, Babel’s family was told that he had died somewhere in the Gulag on 17 March 1941, but the eventual opening of the KGB archives in the 1990s told a different tale. Under relentless interrogation at the Lubyanka from May to September 1939, Babel had made a detailed confession, probably on the promise of a lesser sentence or even of being freed. He admitted to having been a tool of the Trotskyists and to having been recruited as a spy for France on an earlier visit to Paris and duly played the obligatory role as the ideological penitent. Even worse, not only did Babel capitulate to all his interrogators’ demands, but in response to the demand that he denounce other “enemies of the people,” he also began incriminating his friends—the director Sergey Eisenstein, the Jewish actor Solomon Mikhoels, the writer Yury Olesha, and others. In September, in a last-ditch attempt to save himself, he wrote a letter to Beria from the Lubyanka in which he expressed a burning desire “to work, to repent, and to condemn a life wrongly and criminally wasted.” No one knows what physical and mental torments may have led to Babel’s betrayal of his friends or his own dignity as a writer, but when he later realized that all was lost, and by now tormented with guilt, he tried several times to recant, asserting that “this slander was prompted by\n\nmy own faint-hearted behaviour during the cross-examination.” On 26 January 1940, Babel was finally tried by a military tribunal at Butyrki prison, where he was now being held, when he denied all the charges to which he had previously confessed. He was shot the following morning. One of the great tragedies of his arrest and death is the lost legacy of the twenty-seven folders of Babel’s manuscripts confiscated at the time of his arrest, including essays, a book on Gorky, several dozen stories, a play, and a film script . Although the KGB archives have since been opened, there is no sign of these manuscripts.The loss to Russian literature is immeasurable.

The whole city,“with its chimnies and refineries . . . its grimy naptha-besprinkled streets . . . its shabby conglomeration of peoples, its inky harbour, its canopy of smoke,” had become by then “larger, more pungent, and less inviting than ever.” It was, however, the ideal recruiting ground for revolutionaries and political activists. The large-scale exploitation of oil in Baku since the 1870s had attracted a huge influx of workers from all over the Russian Empire, many of them from long-exploited Baku\n\n17\n\nand suppressed ethnic minorities. It was here that Stalin served his revolutionary apprenticeship after being expelled by the Georgian Social Democrats in 1907. The period 1904–1908 is a particularly shadowy one in Stalin’s career and is problematic for historians. He was constantly moving around from one hiding place to another and using several different aliases in order to evade rearrest and the long journey back into Siberian exile. However, Stalinist historiography later claimed a pivotal role for Stalin in agitational activities in Baku from the summer of 1904. Strikes and political unrest here and elsewhere in the Russian Empire contributed significantly to the 1905 Revolution, and it was essential that Stalin was seen to be directly involved in them. In reality, little is clear about his career at this time, and there is nothing to substantiate claims that he did anything more than make the occasional visit to Baku before 1907. Indeed, several members of the Baku underground—in particular Abel Enukhidze—who later wrote their memoirs and failed to mention Stalin’s role were forced to rewrite their accounts, minimizing their own contributions at the price of giving greater emphasis to Stalin’s. Stalin was in Baku on a more permanent basis by the autumn of 1907 when he set up a rival Bolshevik branch of the Georgian Social Democrats, publishing a trade union broadsheet, The Baku Proletarian. In it he encouraged the 50,000 oil workers to form a single trade union to represent them at the elections to the state Duma. In March 1908, Stalin was arrested again and languished in prison in Baku before being sent back to Solvychegodsk. But he was soon back in Baku, after escaping yet again, and hid out at the Balakhlana oilfield. He began republishing his broadsheet while orchestrating a general strike of the oil workers. Stalin later officially acknowledged his experiences at Baku as formative of his early revolutionary career: “Two years of revolutionary work among the oil workers\n\n18\n\nBaltic States\n\nof Baku hardened me as a practical fighter. . . . I first learned what it meant to lead large masses of workers and received my second revolutionary baptism in combat.” See also Batum; Georgia; Georgian Social Democrats; Historiography; Stalin: Imprisonment and Exile of;Transcaucasia Further reading: Edward Ellis Smith.

Norton, 1973.\n\nF\n\nBaltic States\n\nor centuries, the ancient Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia suffered incursions, wars, and partitions by other invading nations, among them Slavs, Germans, and Scandinavians. In the sixteenth century Lithuania had united with Poland, while most of Estonia and Latvia had come under Swedish control by the seventeenth century. A continuing process of partition and annexation brought the greater part of the region increasingly under the control of the Russian Empire during the nineteenth century, but the Baltic states remained fiercely protective of their national heritage and culture. But at the end of World War I, with all three states seeking to win back their independence, Stalin, as commissar for nationalities, was loudly proclaiming a different scenario. The Bolsheviks, he announced, would sooner or later liberate the workers of the Baltic from capitalism, and the revolution would sweep away the “petty kinglets” of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Still, the Baltic peoples resisted Bolshevik attempts to establish Communist regimes there, and the region clung to a degree of independence that, in 1920, the Soviets were obliged to recognize officially. In 1921 all three\n\nstates became members of the League of Nations and struggled to retain their political neutrality amid the escalating political tensions in Europe in the 1930s. When Stalin made his secret pact with Hitler in 1939, the two leaders, both of whom were reluctant to let go of their countries’ centuries-old control of the Baltic, made a deal on the future state of affairs. Germany would take control of Lithuania; Estonia and Latvia would fall to the Soviet Union. But when the Lithuanians resisted German domination, most of the area was turned over to the Soviets. By the autumn of 1939 Stalin’s foreign minister,Vyacheslav Molotov, had persuaded the Baltic states to sign a treaty of “mutual assistance” with the Soviet Union, and Red Army garrisons were rapidly installed in the region. Stalin’s annexation of the region under the German-Soviet Pact was followed by the states’ formal incorporation as constituent republics into the Soviet Union in August 1940 and by the imposition of one-sided elections to ensure the installation of proSoviet governments. The nationalization of Baltic industries was soon begun with the freezing of all business assets.The Sovietization of everyday life saw changes to school and university syllabuses and the removal of potent reminders of national identity. An immediate assessment was made by Stalin’s NKVD (secret police) officials of any undesirable elements—such as priests, non-Communists and nationalists, teachers, trade unionists, intellectuals, members of the bourgeoisie, and Jewish leaders in all walks of life. In Estonia in June 1940, 10,000 people were summarily shot or dispatched to the Gulag. This was but the beginning of a policy to deliberately relocate the region’s peoples in a drive to water down any resistance to Soviet domination. On a single night—14 June–15 June 1941—132,000 Baltic people were packed into cattle trains and deported to Central Asia and Siberia. Hopes of a return to their 1918 status as sovereign states faded in the Baltic after the\n\nGermans invaded in 1941. Many people had initially celebrated the German invasion as an act of liberation, but it was not long before Hitler’s intentions regarding their future became apparent—they were as exploitative as Stalin’s. The Nazis designated the region a single territorial unit bearing the characterless name of “Ostland” and made it clear that their objective for it was its wholesale Germanization, the subordination of its population as a source of expendable slave labor, and the plundering of its agricultural land for produce to feed the German war machine. Between July and August 1941 many thousands of the Jews in Latvia and Lithuania were deported to the death camps. Estonian Jews who had not already fled to the Soviet Union were also wiped out in the Holocaust. While resistance to German occupation during the war was limited, a nationalist resistance movement prepared itself underground for concerted resistance to any renewal of Soviet domination in the region after the war, and in 1946 there were numerous armed clashes between nationalist partisans and government troops. After the war, Stalin sought to continue the process he had begun in 1940. He met considerable resistance to enforced collectivization in Lithuania in the late 1940s, a fact that led to the deportation and deaths of thousands (142,000 were deported from the Baltic during 1945–1949). This forced relocation of the less cooperative peoples of the Soviet Union became a major Stalinist method of ensuring internal security. Many Baltic peasant farmers, who had been labeled “kulaks” (rich, money-making peasants), were deported by 1949. As many as one-quarter of the original people of the Baltic states were eventually forcibly resettled and supplanted by ethnic Russians. In the postwar years Stalin imposed a rapid industrialization and urbanization program in the region, which raised production levels and the standard of living but also rapidly eroded traditional rural farming Baltic States\n\n19\n\neconomies. The imposition of a Soviet-style bureaucracy was supported by a huge influx of Russian immigrants who took over the homes and jobs of native people, a process that dramatically shifted the ethnic balance of these states (by the 1980s almost half of the populations of Estonia and Latvia were ethnic Russians). A direct consequence of this was the deliberate marginalization of Baltic languages and cultural practices. Yet the strength of national identity persisted among the Baltic peoples, and an increasingly vociferous independence movement gathered ground throughout the 1980s. After the failed coup by Communist hardliners against Mikhail Gorbachev’s government in August 1991 threw the Soviet Union into chaos, the Baltic republics wasted no time in declaring their independence from the Soviet Union.

Many workers had settled here from all over the Caucasus, as well as from Russia. In 1901, not long after joining the Georgian Social Democrats in Tiflis, Stalin was sent to Batum to carry out propaganda work among the workers at oil refineries and factories by setting up a secret printing press. In February 1902 he was involved in inciting a strike and later a demonstration at which 300 people were arrested. A violent protest against these arrests led to more arrests and some deaths, and in April Stalin himself was imprisoned, first in Batum and then in Kutaisi, before being exiled to Siberia for three years. Soviet historiography of the Stalinist pe-\n\n20\n\nBatum\n\nriod has, of necessity, overemphasized Stalin’s role in the demonstration in Batum, as it has his activities in Baku. As one colorful account describes it, “Comrade Soso stood in the midst of the turbulent sea of workers, personally directing the movement.” But conflicting testimony and historical opinion make it hard to pinpoint the reality of Stalin’s early years as an activist. Growing archival evidence suggests that Stalin’s real role here and in his other early activities throughout the Caucasus was much less glamorous and more marginal than Soviet historiography contends. He played a more manipulative role behind the scenes, orchestrating events from a safe and always anonymous distance.

Norton, 1973.\n\nBeria, Lavrenty Pavlovich (1899–1953)\n\nT\n\nhe Yugoslav politician Milovan Djilas on meeting Beria in the late 1940s described him as “somewhat plumpish, greenish and pale, and with soft damp hands.” Andrey Sakharov, too, noted the “slightly moist and deathly cold hand,” an apposite observation since Beria’s metaphorical hand of death was felt by thousands. Djilas saw a creepy, lascivious element to Beria’s nature. It was a nature that could not be disguised by his love of Rachmaninov (whose music brought him to tears), nor by the prim appearance created by his neat pince-nez, nor belied by pictures taken of him in avuncular mode cuddling Stalin’s daughter Svetlana on his knee. In fact, Beria can claim the dubious distinction of being perhaps the most reprehensible of all Stalin’s apparatchiks (bureau-\n\ncrats), not only for his ruthless cruelty, but also for his lewd sexual proclivities and, in particular, his predilection for young girls (whom, as recent studies have revealed, he ordered his bodyguards to abduct from the street for own personal use).This would certainly explain the natural antipathy to Beria described by Svetlana of herself, her mother, and other female members in the Stalin household. Indeed, Stalin’s wife tried unsuccessfully to block his frequent invitation. By this time Stalin had found an important role for him as first secretary of the Georgian Communist Party, from which position Beria ensured the brutal institution of collectivization throughout Transcaucasia. He was also well placed to serve a particular role in singling out and eliminating Stalin’s and his own rivals in the region, thus establishing a “proper order” in the country as a virtual minidictator. Svetlana Allilueva asserted that Beria’s ascendancy in Transcaucasia was maintained only through Stalin’s support and that he had many rivals among the Old Bolsheviks, including Sergey Kirov and Sergo Ordzhonikide (the latter did not mince his words and told Stalin that Beria was a “crook”), who knew the truth of Beria’s history there. But as late as 1952 Beria ruthlessly put down a nationalist organization in his native Mingrelia, resulting in the execution of its Communist Party leadership and with them anyone who knew about his nefarious past. Beria would do anything to ingratiate himself with Stalin and bolster his own political position. In 1935, he wrote a hagiography of Stalin’s early years as a revolutionary entitled On the History of the Bolshevik Organization in Transcaucasia. In this, one of the seminal examples of the Stalinist falsification of history, Beria asserted that “the whole revolutionary movement of Transcaucasia and Georgia, has, from the first days of its rise, been linked inseparably with the work and name of Comrade Stalin.” Elevation to a senior role in government came with Beria’s election in 1934 to the\n\nThe much-feared head of the NKVD, Lavrenty Beria was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands.\n\nCentral Committee, followed by his candidacy for the Politburo in 1939. In 1938 Stalin had brought Beria to Moscow to replace Nikolay Ezhov as commissar for internal affairs. From here, having set up his own personal fiefdom operated by a mafioso-like gang of mainly Georgian bully boys (which also helped maintain his long-standing foothold on local power in the Caucasus), Beria proceeded to “purge the purgers,” including his predecessor, Ezhov. It was, however, a time of deceleration in the rate of arrests; although one can hardly apply the term “liberal” to the regime instituted by Beria, the frenetic terror of Ezhovshchina was at least over, with many who were awaiting trial suddenly and inexplicably finding themselves released. There is, however, a darker side to Beria’s hegemony at the NKVD. Accounts testify to the particular pleasure he took on a regular basis in witnessing, if not personally participating in, the torture of suspects. But as Beria, Lavrenty Pavlovich\n\n21\n\nthe Terror drew to a close, Beria’s main task became the administration of the vast network of labor camps of the Gulag. As deputy prime minister, with responsibility for security from 1941 to 1953, Beria became indispensable as a close aide to Stalin, overseeing arms production during the Great Patriotic War and ensuring that the desperate need for raw materials was addressed by the mass exploitation of slave labor from the Gulag. Some of his most important responsibilities were to oversee the Soviet nuclear project, to organize espionage activities abroad, and to ensure an adequate supply of uranium mined from open casts by unprotected slave laborers in Central Asia. For his efforts Beria was heaped with such awards as the Order of Lenin, the Red Banner, and the Order of Suvorov (for his efficient resettlement of thousands of people from ethnic minorities to Central Asia and Siberia), and, much to the disgust of the officer class, he was made a marshal of the Soviet Union in 1945 (during the entire war he visited the front lines on only two occasions). It is more than possible that before he died, Stalin was preparing to rid himself of Beria. By then the two men acted in an atmosphere of mutual antipathy and suspicion, but they had become totally dependent on each other. As one Old Bolshevik observed, “The two were lone wolves. And their alliance was lupine.” Stalin, who had become increasingly paranoid and reclusive, had no doubt come to rely too heavily on a man whom his daughter Svetlana described as “more treacherous, more practiced in perfidy and cunning, more insolent and single minded” than even Stalin himself. Indeed, she lays much of the blame for Stalin’s later excesses at the door of Beria, seeing him in effect as the “evil genius” behind Stalin’s throne and asserting that Beria, “a magnificent modern specimen of the artful courtier, the embodiment of Oriental perfidy, flattery and hypocrisy,” had succeeded where others had failed in convincing Stalin of his undying loyalty.\n\n22\n\nBeria, Lavrenty Pavlovich\n\nIn contrast to this view, which sees Stalin succumbing to Beria’s manipulative behavior, the historian Adam Ulam points out that Stalin, despite his failing powers, was perfectly well aware that Beria’s apparent loyalty was the knee-jerk reaction of the sycophant out to protect his own position. It was nothing but the elaborate concoction of a man who sensed his own vulnerability in the face of the uncompromising hostility of his peers.While Allilueva’s desire to find some kind of redeeming feature in her father’s behavior is understandable, Stalin had no scruples in exploiting Beria’s sadistic tendencies in the ruthless eradication of his enemies, and Beria responded by laying on with a trowel the one thing Stalin craved—flattery. And so the faux joviality of their drinking sessions at the dacha at Kuntsevo, the interchange of coarse jokes, and the sly asides in their native Georgian tongue might have convinced observers that the two men were thick as thieves, but the players themselves knew otherwise. For Beria equaled Stalin in duplicity, and the two men were now locked in their own danse macabre. When Stalin lay immobile and dying at his dacha in March 1953, Beria initially rose to the emotion of the occasion by playing the role of the distraught lackey, only to reveal his true contempt by spitting on the great leader’s prostrate body, once he was sure that Stalin had slipped into unconsciousness. On 9 March, at Stalin’s funeral, Beria delivered a eulogy to the crowds in Red Square, making clear his own claim to be Stalin’s successor. During the Great Patriotic War, Stalin had divided the responsibilities of Beria’s Secret Police into the MGB, responsible for security matters, and the MVD, which dealt with matters of public order, policing, and the administration of the Gulag. After Stalin’s death, Beria was quick to reunite these two departments under his sole control, as a power base from which to launch his own bid for the leadership in opposition\n\nto Malenkov and Khrushchev. Such a move alarmed his rivals, who were only too aware of Beria’s more “liberal” attitudes on matters such as civil rights, the dismantling of the Gulag (though how genuine these attitudes were has been called into question), and his desire for rapprochement with the West, particularly in the case of East Germany, which he was willing to see reabsorbed into a united but neutral Germany. Such a threat to the stability of the old Stalinist system could not be contemplated, and Khrushchev and Malenkov connived at Beria’s removal. A careful plan was laid to lure him to a meeting of the Presidium at the Kremlin on 26 June 1953, where he was separated from his bodyguards and surrounded by a phalanx of armed senior Red Army officers (backed up by armored cars hidden outside). Beria was denounced as a traitor and, in the greatest of ironies, as a British spy—a totally fabricated charge that Beria’s NKVD officers had used so many times against their innocent victims. For the next six months, Beria was held in an underground bunker in Moscow. Between 18 and 23 December 1953, he was tried in secret and shot soon after.The precise date is unconfirmed and rumor persists that he may have been already dead by the time of this “trial.” Another report claims that he was shot in a scuffle on his way to execution. Immediately after his death was announced, Beria became a nonperson.The long article describing his illustrious career in the third edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia was replaced in haste with a fourpage entry on the Bering Strait. Subscribers to the Encyclopedia dutifully followed the instructions issued to them to paste the Bering Strait article over Beria’s biography.

Not only had the three nations succeeded in defeating the common enemy, Hitler, but, more optimistically, Churchill asserted in Parliament in February 1945 that the Soviet Union and its military leaders would “live in honourable friendship and equality with the Western democracies.” Such idealistic talk could not, however, disguise the fact that the coming together of the three powers had been one of overriding expediency in the face of innate mutual mistrust. From Stalin’s point of view, the alliance had always been one of brutal necessity, which had become critical once the early successes of Hitler’s Operation Barbarossa had brought the Wehrmacht to the outskirts of Moscow. Equally, Churchill and Roosevelt both supported the alliance in the face of their own deep-seated loathing of communism. Indeed, Churchill in earlier times had launched into his characteristic purple prose to condemn the Soviet state and call on the democratic West to “strangle the babe of Bolshevism in its cradle.” When Hitler’s army attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, Churchill’s response had been unequivocal: “The Russian danger . . . is our danger.” Shortly after, he and Stalin announced an Anglo-Soviet agreement on mutual military assistance, and it took considerable courage on Churchill’s part to resist Stalin’s constant bullying for a second front to be opened in northern France to take the pressure off the Soviet Union. Churchill adamantly refused, and\n\n“The Big Three”\n\n23\n\nStalin and his wartime allies,Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, relaxing during the conference held in Tehran, November–December 1943, after the tide of the war in Europe had finally turned in their favor.\n\nthis would rankle Stalin for the next three years, until the June offensive of 1944 finally got under way. Meanwhile American military aid also began to flow into the Soviet Union, and in October 1941 a Common Law Alliance between the three powers was signed in Moscow. It came at a time when the military fortunes of all three countries were at an ebb and were yet to suffer further catastrophes in the Atlantic, the Western Desert of North Africa, and Southeast Asia. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Churchill sent his foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, to Moscow to clarify the relationship between the two countries, but progress was stymied by Stalin’s entrenched position on Eastern Europe and his insistence, after the war on a return to the “old frontiers” that the Soviet Union had held prior to the Versailles Agreement of 1919.\n\n24\n\n“The Big Three”\n\nBy March 1942, Roosevelt had joined Stalin in pressing Churchill to agree to a second front and an invasion of Europe. When Stalin issued Churchill an ultimatum on the matter, Churchill traveled to Moscow in August to discuss the situation personally with “the old bear” (as he referred to Stalin in a letter to his wife), taking with him gifts of Dunhill pipes.At their talks, the two men engaged in some heated horse trading over the future balance of power in southeastern Europe. Churchill seemed willing to accede to Stalin’s demands for Soviet influence as far as Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia were concerned, a fact that led to later recrimination from Roosevelt and the Americans. Stalin proved to be an extremely wily negotiator; the British view of him at the end of the Moscow talks was summarized by one of Churchill’s entourage, Colonel Ian Jacob:“I\n\ndon’t believe that it is possible to make friends with a man like Stalin, in the sense that we understand friendship. . . . He was absolute master of the situation at all times, and appeared to be cold and calculating. . . . I should say that to make friends with Stalin would be equivalent to making friends with a python.” Between January and October 1943 the balance of the war shifted dramatically in the Allies’ favor as the Soviets repulsed the Germans at Stalingrad and Kursk. Italy was invaded and Rommel was routed in North Africa. The time had come for “The Big Three” to meet and plan the final defeat of Hitler and the shape of the postwar world, which they did at Tehran between 28 November and 1 December 1943. Most of the talks were conducted in an atmosphere of amicable agreement, except when the particularly sensitive subject of Poland was brought up—a subject that led to heated interchanges between the two foreign ministers Vyacheslav Molotov and Anthony Eden. But important decisions were made on the opening of the second front, the future of the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, and the setting up of a postwar international peacekeeping organization—the United Nations. During the course of the conference Roosevelt had three private conversations with Stalin and at Christmas that year publicly stated that he had found him “a man who combines tremendous relentless determination with a stalwart good humor. I believe he is truly representative of the heart and soul of Russia,” a Russia that Roosevelt predicted “we are going to get along very well with.” From here until the leaders met again at Yalta at the end of the war in 1945, Churchill would be reduced to the status of third fiddle to the political duet played by Roosevelt and Stalin. This development particularly wounded the British leader, who had always valued his special relationship with Roosevelt. It soon became apparent after the death of Roosevelt (in April 1945) and Churchill’s\n\nfall from power (in the general election of July 1945) that any romantic notions that might have been nurtured about relations between the Communist East and the democratic West continuing in the spirit of that wartime triumvirate were baseless. Roosevelt’s critics felt he had been politically naive for “taking Stalin at his word,” but Roosevelt’s attitude toward Stalin had been based throughout on the deeply held conviction that cooperation between the “four policemen”—Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union—was the only way of guaranteeing a secure future world. Such a belief had been at the root of his tolerance of the more boorish elements of Stalin’s behavior and Soviet negotiating tactics at the wartime summits. Indeed, Roosevelt’s understated manner and his skill at handling a man as complex as Stalin ultimately proved more effective than the tactics of other, more volatile negotiators, who were genial and aggressive by turns. As for Stalin, he had proved himself a surprisingly skillful negotiator, as even the American diplomat Averell Harriman, who had been present at all the meetings of “The Big Three,” concluded: “I found him better informed than Roosevelt, more realistic than Churchill, in some ways the most effective of the war leaders.” By 1950, however, all the camaraderie of the war years had evaporated, as had the “rainbow of hope” that Roosevelt had talked about at Tehran in 1943. Stalin, in the final and most paranoid years of his rule, reverted to a policy of increasing isolationism bolstered by Soviet hegemony over the new buffer zone of satellite Communist states. The Iron Curtain that had now descended across Europe ensured that a renewal of rapprochement between East and West would be a long time coming.

But like his contemporary Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, he proved to be too outspoken and independent a force in the military for Stalin to tolerate indefinitely. B lyukher joined the revolutionary cause as a young factory worker and spent time in prison for organizing a strike. He served in the Russian army during World War I. He joined the Bolsheviks in 1916 and fought with distinction during the civil war, fighting the Whites in the south of Russia and leading his troops in a legendary march across Cossack-held territory in the Ural Mountains. At the end of the war, he was given a post in the Far East to oversee the final expulsion of the Whites and the Japanese from Soviet soil. In 1929, by now commander-in-chief of the Far Eastern Army, he reestablished Soviet control of the Far Eastern Railroad from the Chinese and later led Soviet forces against Japanese incursions into Manchuria, gaining a crucial military victory for the Soviets and laying the foundations of a powerful Soviet fighting force in that region. In 1937 Blyukher, a man of some political influence who was held in high regard by his peers, was compelled along with\n\n26\n\nother leading military men, as friends and colleagues of an accused (a favorite ploy of Stalin’s), to sit on the tribunal that condemned Marshal Tukhachevsky and others to be shot. It is said that Blyukher actually commanded the firing squad at Tukhachevsky’s execution. In a grim but typical twist to events at this high point of the Great Terror, even as Blyukher ordered this execution, he was himself being marked by Stalin for the same fate. Along with most of his staff and commanders, Blyukher was rounded up in a major purge of Stalin’s Far Eastern Army in 1938 and allowed a long enough reprieve to travel back to the Far East to command the final military repulsion of the Japanese in July–August at Lake Khasan. On his return in October, Blyukher and his immediate family (including his first wife) were arrested, and he was charged with being a Japanese spy, a favorite accusation at this time. He refused to trade a confession for a ten-year sentence despite long hours of torture in Lefortovo prison. Perhaps this final act of bravery was for him a way of redeeming himself morally for having been a party to the condemnation of his military comrades a year earlier. In any event, it was revealed in the late 1980s that Blyukher had not, in fact, been shot but that he died as a result of the severe beatings he received under torture. His wife was sent to the Gulag for eight years. See also The Great Terror; Manchuria; Red Army;Tukhachevsky, Marshal Mikhail Further reading: Robert Conquest. The Great Terror: A Reassessment.

He was much decorated in World War I before joining the Bolsheviks in 1918. Budenny soon established himself as something of a folk hero, as a result of his exploits against the Polish troops of Marshal Pilsudski during the Russian-Polish war of 1919–1920. He was put in command of the troops of the First Cavalry of the Red Army and was much admired, that is, until the less-than-edifying exploits of his troops, particularly against women and Jews, were vividly described in the stories of Isaac Babel’s Red Cavalry. Budenny protested loudly at this slander in an open letter to the journal Red News in 1928, in which he defended his heroic fighters and dismissed Babel’s book as the work of an erotomanic author, who indulged “in old women’s gossip” about “some Red Army man taking a loaf of bread and a chicken somewhere.” In the 1930s, Budenny, with his bristling mustache and swashbuckling Cossack air (he was a Don Cossack by birth), became the ideal vehicle for the promotion of Bolshevik Russia’s heroic revolutionary past, despite the fact that Budenny himself had never taken comfortably to Marxist dogma. Nevertheless, he slavishly mouthed the appropriate Stalinist slogans and was rewarded by being made one of the first five marshals of the Soviet Union in 1935. He further reinforced Stalin’s trust in him by serving as a member of the court that tried and condemned a group of Soviet generals, including Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Like many of Stalin’s other “yes” men, Budenny was promoted up the ranks and beyond his own capabilities, becoming deputy commissar for defense in 1940. His inability to adapt to modern warfare became apparent during the Great Patriotic War, when in one battle he attempted to lead, saber in hand, from the front—only this time on the top of a tank—as he had\n\ndone in the old days of cavalry charges. When he was later recalled for his incompetence at the front, he was kept away from active command, although he continued to organize cavalry operations. When he died in 1973 he was accorded, as a recipient of the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the honor of being buried in the Kremlin Wall.

London: Phoenix, 1997.\n\nBukharin, Nikolay Ivanovich (1888–1938)\n\nI\n\nf one were called upon to single out a member of the Bolshevik leadership after the Russian Revolution, possessed of all the attributes of the romantic political hero—charm, good looks, humanity, eloquence, and the ability to be tough when necessary—one would probably settle on Nikolay Bukharin. He was a charismatic figure of considerable intellect, as well as being preeminent outside the Soviet Union as a leading Bolshevik within the Comintern. Lenin himself had talked of Bukharin as “the darling of the Party.” But equally, he also noted Bukharin’s vulnerability, observing that he was like “soft wax on which any demagogue can inscribe whatever he likes.” Indeed, Bukharin’s more moderate economic policies made him a regular object of contempt among the hardline Bolsheviks, one of whom once jealously dubbed him “the Pushkin of NEP.” But Bukharin’s support for the New Economic Policy, and his particular brand of socialist humanism based on economic policies of cooperation and trust, although never fully developed, offered an alternative to the Stalinist economic system of coercion, for a while at least. Bukharin, Nikolay Ivanovich\n\n27\n\nA photograph of Nikolay Bukharin released to the international press on the announcement of his forthcoming trial for treason, held in Moscow in 1938. Bukharin, a leading Soviet economic theoretician, was shot on 13 March.\n\nBukharin served the statutory revolutionary apprenticeship as an underground activist for the Russian Social Democrats while he was a student of economics at Moscow University. In 1906 he joined the Bolshevik faction. Arrested and sent to Siberia in 1911, he escaped and while traveling in Europe met and worked with Lenin, developing a close relationship with him despite their frequent differences over theory. Later Bukharin made his way to the United States, and in New York, having already worked on Pravda for Lenin in Europe, he took over the editorship of Noviy Mir (New World).There he worked alongside Trotsky, who was also in exile. Returning to Russia after the revolution in February 1917, Bukharin soon became a major political player as a member of the\n\n28\n\nBukharin, Nikolay Ivanovich\n\nCentral Committee of the Communist Party. In 1918 Lenin gave him the editorship of Pravda, now established as the official organ of the Communist Party. He held this post, which gave him considerable influence over both official Party policy and propaganda, until 1929. By the beginning of the 1920s Bukharin had become a member of the Politburo and chairman of the executive committee of the Comintern. In the early 1920s he set his stamp as the major Bolshevik theoretician, publishing such works as The Economy of the Transitional Period (1920), The ABC of Communism (1921), and The Theory of Historical Materialism (1921). During the power struggle after Lenin’s death in 1924, Bukharin found it expedient to ally himself with Stalin on the right of the Party in opposition to those on the left—Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, and Lev Kamenev—who were agitating for a program of rapid industrial change and for enforced agricultural collectivization.At the time, the demonic figure of Trotsky (as he was viewed by the opposition) seemed to pose the greater and more vocal threat as he and his supporters appeared ever more extreme in their campaign to achieve worldwide revolution. Bukharin and Stalin at this time were thus united in criticizing Trotsky’s extremism and endorsing a more moderate line on industrialization.The pace of modernization should not be forced, in Bukharin’s view, and he advocated a continuation of Lenin’s New Economic Policy, which had as its foundation the traditional peasant economy. Bukharin believed that it was crucial to sustain the confidence and support of the peasantry by allowing them a modicum of initiative and free enterprise in keeping their own vegetable plots, in hiring labor, and in leasing land. It was their alliance with the proletariat of the city that had helped overthrow the tsars, and this relationship should"
