At the beginning of the Olympic year, there were three favorites among the Americans – Andy Stanfield, Art Bragg, and Jim Golliday. But Golliday was injured early in the year and did not make the Olympic team. Stanfield opted out of the 100, although he would make the team and win a gold medal in the 200. Bragg was joined on the US team by outsiders Lindy Remigino and Dean Smith. Their biggest opposition was felt to come from Jamaica’s Herb McKenley and Britain’s McDonald Bailey. The final in Helsinki is probably the closest mass finish in Olympic 100 metre history. Bragg did not make the final, but Smith, Remigino, McKenley, and Bailey were joined by Vladimir Sukharev of the USSR, and John Treloar of Australia. Remigino got out to an early lead but McKenley came on strong at the end and it was difficult to tell who had won. But McKenley’s fast finish saw him pass Remigino in the metres after the line, leading many observers to think the Jamaican had won. The photo finish was necessary to separate the runners, with Remigino winning gold, McKenley silver, and Bailey bronze. Smith, Sukharyev, and Treloar finished 4-6. The first four finishers were credited with 10.4 and Sukharyev and Treloar 10.5, but the auto times showed a margin of only 0.12 seconds between 1st (10.79) and last (10.91).
