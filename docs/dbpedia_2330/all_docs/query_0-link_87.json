        "text": "Montana is typically pretty good about taking care of their own. We support our locals schools, our workers, and of course our Montana State Bobcats. So when it comes to taking care of grandma and grandpa, where does Montana come into play?\n\nWalletHub did a study to find out which states have the \"Best Elder-Abuse Protection\" and Montana did not do so hot.\n\nWalletHub took 15 things into consideration to find out where states ranked and how they got their specific ranking. Listed below, you can see that this study is rather thorough.\n\nShare of Elder-Abuse, Gross-Neglect and Exploitation Complaints\n\nEstimated Elder Fraud Rate\n\nElder Fraud Loss Amount per Reported Frauds\n\nTotal Expenditures on Elder-Abuse Prevention per Resident Aged 65 & Older\n\nTotal Expenditures on Legal-Assistance Development per Resident Aged 65 & Older\n\nTotal Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program Funding per Resident Aged 65 & Older\n\nFinancial Elderly-Abuse Laws\n\nEldercare Organizations & Services per Resident Aged 65 & Older\n\nPresence of Elder-Abuse Forensic Centers/Groups\n\nCertified Volunteer Ombudsmen per Resident Aged 65 & Older\n\nFrequency of Assisted-Living Facilities Inspections\n\nQuality of Nursing Homes\n\nPresence of Laws Allowing Surveillance Cams in Nursing Homes\n\nPresence of Elder Justice Task Forces\n\nPresence of Elder-Abuse Shelters\n\nMontana ranks 49th out of all the states for Best Elder-Abuse Protection Laws. There are a few things you can do as an individual to help protect our elders that are easy to do.\n\nLook Out For Unusual Bank or Credit Card Activity\n\nBe Cautious of New or Unfamiliar “Friends”\n\nMonitor Social Media and Internet Use\n\nWatch For Changes in Legal Documents\n\nTake Note of Changes in Behavior\n\nBe Mindful of Any Decline in Personal Care Conditions\n\nLet's see what we can do in the future to take care of our grandparents and protect them. Respect our elders includes making sure they are being taken care of by us in every way, shape, and form.\n\ncc: WalletHub"
