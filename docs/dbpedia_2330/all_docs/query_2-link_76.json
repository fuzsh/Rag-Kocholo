        "text": "The White Buffalo and The Black Hoof\n\nOne of my favorite music artists for the past couple of years has been The White Buffalo. Up until now, it seems as though every time he hits Toronto, I have something going on so getting out there to see him is out of the question.\n\nThis time when we heard that he was going to be at The Garrison in Toronto, Kris ordered tickets for us immediately, and I started the countdown.\n\nFor those of you who aren’t familiar, check out The White Buffalo yesterday. He will not be playing these smaller venues soon.\n\nWhen we arrived at The Garrison, we were pleasantly surprised. It was like a larger Mavericks, which is one of my favorite Ottawa music venues. I like the smaller, more intimate venues. The Garrison did not disappoint.\n\nThe place packed up quickly, there was no doubt about that. The bartender was great, polite, and kept the booze line going steadily. The bar staff was equally as friendly. Kris and I met a new friend in Daniele, a really friendly and outgoing girl who moved to Toronto not super long ago. We laughed and chatted with her before the concert, between songs, and afterward as well.\n\nAs we waited for the concert, some guy moved to the front, knocking my drink all over me. He said sorry, so I didn’t make a big deal out of it. But when he did it the second time and said sorry just as casually, I confronted him and told him that I knew he apologized, but his ‘sorry’ sounded like more of an ‘oh well’. A few minutes after that, he turned to Daniele and I to move us to the front row. He felt really bad about the two incidents, and wanted us to see and enjoy the show.\n\nWe did not complain, we had the best view in the house!\n\nThe show itself was incredible. I got lost in The White Buffalo’s deep, soulful voice. He played the hits, old and new. I let loose a crazy laugh when he played ‘Bar and the Beer’…because he’s in Toronto singing lyrics that include the words ‘Drunken Stuper’. I don’t know if he is up on the news or not, but well played.\n\nAfter the show he announced to the crowd that he was sticking around for a drink and to meet everyone. Then this happened:\n\nYes, I chatted with Jake Smith and took a picture with him. I also told him my Mom has a crush on him, and he sounds like Joe Cocker. Anything else I said I am pleading the 5th on. Let’s just say, I am not very cool when talking to people that I have fangirl crushes on.\n\nI had to start this post with this part of the night because it’s what I want to brag about the most. I am still swooning from that evening.\n\nPrior to that, the night started off with Kris and I eating dinner at a little restaurant called the Black Hoof, followed by drinks at their sister bar, the Rhum Bar.\n\nThe Black Hoof was absolutely incredible. Feeling adventurous, we tried some food we never have-namely Sweetbreads, Cotechino, Blood and Brain Tourrine. We were not disappointed. The restaurant staff was friendly and helpful, and the food was amazing. Plus, we were happy to be eating at a place that incorporated all parts of the animal, not just desired cuts of meat. It was delicious, and both of us were surprised that our favorite portion of the meal was the blood and brain tourrine. When we headed to the Rhum bar, pre show, we indulged in delicious spiced rum at excellent prices. The staff there was also quite friendly and helpful.\n\nAll in all, our evening in Toronto was pretty incredible. Every person we crossed paths with were friendly, sociable, and a ton of fun. Hear that Ottawa people? The old wives tale about Torontonians being cold or rude is exactly that-a myth. I haven’t had such a friendly music experience since Bonnaroo.\n\nIn closing, you absolutely have to check out The White Buffalo. I can’t stress enough what an amazing musician he is. He is going to be HUGE. You also have to head out to Toronto to check out The Black Hoof, and The Rhum Bar also. Make some new friends while you’re at it. Leave Rob Ford to his own devices. Plenty of better things going on in that city.\n\nMusic and Memories\n\nIf I had a nickle for everytime someone mentioned a place and I said “Never been there”. I’d be living a life of luxury in a multiplex mansion. I am working on that. Bonnaroo was in fact a chance to go see some amazing music acts and also to get out of my little bubble, that I call Ottawa.\n\nIt ended up being so much more than that.\n\nFirst off, it was a helluva car ride. Not very scenic either, but we made our own fun, and it was so worth it.\n\nTHURSDAY- We arrived at Bonnaroo on a Thursday, and we were tired as hell. I was able to catch Walk The Moon, who were really awesome, but then I had to sit out Japandroids and Alt J. I had never done a full blown music festival before, or experienced such a long car ride. I definitely crashed. So Kris and I checked out the Ferris wheel after instead. During the day, we hit some heat. It was pretty mind blowing how cold it got in Tennessee at night.\n\nFRIDAY- Friday we woke up in our tent around 9AM due to intense heat. It was going to be a big day concert wise.\n\nI didn’t have the desire or energy to check out any day time shows. I hate being in crowds when its too hot, plus I was saving my energy for later that night. The thing is that never having had a major sunburn, and not being someone who slathers on sunscreen to go outside (I know, I know, but my genes are really good for this normally!), the heat kind of got to me a little. It was shocking. Instead if seeing a show outside we hit the comedy tent (which is air conditioned).\n\nRegardless feeling less than perfect later, I trucked on through, and saw the most amazing show of my life on this day.\n\nStarted with Wilco. I’m sure I don’t have to tell you, but these guys were so good. I watched them from the line for Paul McCartney. Jeph and Kris left the line up to catch the show from the pit in front of the stage. It was really great.\n\nHowever, Paul McCartney came afterwards, which made me forget any show I’d ever seen up to then, in my entire life. I cried twice during his set, once during his tribute to Linda McCartney, and once during his tribute to John Lennon. When he played ‘Live and Let Die’, we saw the most amazing stage pyro and fireworks. I couldn’t believe it. I never wanted it to end, and it almost didn’t end-at the age of 71, this guy came out to rock 3 encores!!! I was tired even, and this guy is able to do a high energy show. It really made me reevaluate what it is that I am doing wrong!\n\nAlthough there were thousands upon thousands of people watching this show, he made it feel like an intimate venue. He read signs in the crowd out loud to us, told stories about songs, and showed that he is not ready to stop in the least. What a class act.\n\nOh, and did I mention that we got to be really close to the front, in the pit?! Sure, we had to wait in line forever, and Ariane, Kris, and I had to threaten some line cutters, but we did it. And it was amazing!\n\nAfter the show was done, we all herded out like cattle to try to catch some ZZ Top. From what I could hear (and see a little of) it was a great show also. Originally we were going to dance a little to Pretty Lights, but alas, that show was really delayed, and it was 2AM, so we headed back to camp to have a drink and catch some Z’s. I fell asleep with a smile on my face…it was an incredible day.\n\nSATURDAY – I’ll start by letting you know that at this point, with sunscreen and all, I developed, as I like to call it ‘Elephant Legs’. What this means is that my feet and ankles swelled to the size of my thighs from the heat. And some red rashing started. Yes, I was super attractive.\n\nI almost got heat stroke. I sat in the shade with Ariane while Jeph and Kris went up close for Portugal The Man.\n\nAfter that show I was showing visable signs of heat stroke, so we retreated back to the tents until The Lumineers. Or so I thought. Not feeling well enough yet, Kris and Jeph went ahead while I had some drinks with Ari and JD at the campsite. A few too many, perhaps, but the three of us had some good laughs, and got some energy to go back for Jack Johnson, who was replacing Mumford and Sons at the festival.\n\nWe only heard Jack Johnson from far back, our group mostly giggling, but it was really cool of him to replace a band at the last minute. I’m sure we were respectful of that. I think.\n\nOne of the shows I was most excited for was Billy Idol, and he did his set on Saturday night. I was not prepared at all for the fact that he would basically put me to sleep. He saved most of his dancier stuff for the end, when everyone was exhausted from all his slow jams. I gotta give it to the guy though, he looks exactly the same.\n\nThe show was only ok…which was really disappointing to me. We should have been at the Rock & Soul Dance Party SuperJam which we caught the tail end of. Jim James was there, and Billy Idol joined – and put on a much better performance. That’s ok, we know for next time that that’s where we want to go to dance.\n\nSUNDAY – By this time with my giant Diana Ross hair, heat rashes, and swollen legs, I only look mildly human. But did I let that stop my fun? No. There was no way.\n\nWe started off by seeing David Cross in the comedy tent. He is as funny as he is inappropriate, and it was a great reprieve from the heat. He was so raunchy that people left during his act. But hey, that’s the kind of humor I like most, so I wasn’t leaving.\n\nAfter David Cross we did a bit of shopping at Centeroo, and I was happy with my purchases. Gave us enough time to go back to camp and store our items, then catch Holy Ghost! and get in line for Tom Petty while catching The National. Holy Ghost! was incredible. I danced right through, and I’d love to see them again.\n\nThe National was really really great. Kris left the line to catch the show a bit closer, which was great timing, because Matt Berninger got right into the crowd, right close to Kris!\n\nAfter The National came Tom Petty, and again, because we waited in line, we got into the pit. Super close to the band. This was the last show, and it was incredible. We got rained on and danced the night away. Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers were everything we’d hoped for and more. We danced, sang along, and enjoyed every minute of the show. It wasn’t anywhere near as show-y as McCartney’s show, but just as much talent. I love when you can see a band loves each other, and they have fun through every song. If it’s possible for anyone to sound better live than they do recorded – it’s these guys.\n\nAll of that to be said – Bonnaroo was one of the most intense, best experiences of my entire life. Sure we were stuck in ‘Port-a-pottyville’. Sure the heat got to me. Sure I had elephant legs. I couldn’t really complain because the fun we had was all very much worth it. I’d go back in a heartbeat, and I felt immediately sad that it was over when we got back home.\n\nIn my next post I’ll discuss where we went from Bonnaroo, and what fun we had in those places.\n\nI really want to thank Kris, JD, Ariane, and Jeph for being so much fun, and for taking me on this incredible journey that I will never, ever forget.\n\nFear Day with Dan DeMarbre\n\nIn my first blog post, I listed several things that I was hoping to accomplish over a period of 28 weeks. This past weekend I had the pleasure of spending some time with my great friend, Dan Demarbre, who was selected at random to complete a task with me.\n\nDan and I discussed our options for what kind of day we wanted to have together, set the date and executed.\n\nWe developed Fear Day together. We each did something that terrified us, but something that would be necessary to do, to be on the road to eliminating a fear or two.\n\nTo do this we brought the absolutely wonderful Kristian Lariviere with us. He was able to participate and witness our goings on. The word ‘fun’ cannot do this day justice. Dan and I were both really happy to be able to share our experiences with each other, as well as with Kris, who was incredibly supportive.\n\nThe day started off with a nice helping of food at Denny’s. Cheap, and filling. Kris and I were slightly hungover from throwing a wrap party for his action movie ‘Day One’, the night before. Which helped, because I wasn’t overly concerned about the events to come, more concerned with filling my stomach with food.\n\nFirst stop after breakfast: Little Ray’s reptiles. First we touched the largest snake known to man (or so it seemed). Then we had a little visit with Allie the Alligator. Which would normally scare me as well. But it was hard not to like Allie after learning that she was a rescued pet from Rockland, and finding out that she’s a friendly little thing. So I apprehensively gave her a little pet.\n\nAfter learning about Alligators and snakes, the presentation was over. This is when Dan asked the presenter (pictured above), if she had any arachnids for me to hold. Not touch, hold. You see, as part of fear day, Dan and I decided I should be trying to get rid of this fear that has sometimes paralyzed me. I really wanted to maim him right then, but that was the point in going.\n\nAt first, when she brought out the tarantula, I made a sound that would make you question my sanity and turned to bolt. There was a 6 year old child in the room that gave me the stink eye.\n\nI shakily agreed to touch one of it’s 8 furry legs. Not good enough. They wanted me to HOLD the spider. I explained to the kind lady that works there, that I was scared I couldn’t handle it, that maybe I’d throw it, and I didn’t want to kill the thing…\n\nThis was not being considered. She said she would hold my hand, make sure I didn’t throw it. And then this suddenly happened:\\\n\nYeah, my body language and the look on my face say it all. It’s hard to describe it. I pleaded with them to hurry and take the picture, but as soon as they did, I felt a lot more comfortable with this spider. It was light as a feather.\n\nWe spent the rest of our time at Little Rays learning about other animals, watching some feed, and enjoying ourselves.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The trip was really educational, and they really take great care of the animals at Little Ray’s. As for my fear, I can’t say that I will never be disturbed by a spider again, but I know I can get past it. I felt a huge wave of accomplishment after holding that furry bastard – uh, tarantula. It was ok, didn’t try to maim me in any way, and I know that I’d do it again. It was liberating, refreshing, and I was lucky to have two of my favorite people around to witness it.\n\nSecond stop for Fear Day…the Great Canadian Bungee! This is the highest bungee in North America.\n\nI was sort of surprised when Dan selected this for Fear Day. Afterall, I’d witnessed him and Kris jump off of the Stratosphere in Las Vegas.\n\nBut, if you know Dan – you will know that Dan does not like to be bound or restrained in any way. This is a real problem for him. I understand Dan’s fear. And here he is, signing up to do something that mixes adrenaline with a very real fear.\n\nDan explained to me that he has had other fears in the past, and to help him, he reads up on the physics of the actual issue at hand. What a smart guy! That way, he knows everything there is to know about what he is scared of, and is able to find what he’s frightened of completely irrational. So Dan is a nice mixture of Spock and a human with a heart of gold. I like this, a lot.\n\nThis is Dan’s ‘fear face’ upon seeing a jumper in action as we arrived. It looks like a mixture of ‘excitement’ and ‘I don’t want to think about it’.\n\nAfter what seemed like forever (they really let you build the fear), the guys were finally called to do their jump. Once you get called, you have to hike to the scaffolding, where you’ll stand with the other jumpers until it’s your time. Dan and Kris were the last of their group to jump.\n\nDan can probably tell you better than I can (and I hope he does!) but they were up there for awhile. From what I hear when a jumper walks the plank for his turn, it rattles the whole thing. I’m sure it was terrifying.\n\nFinally Dan’s turn! I assume the position to take pics, but I would need a much better source of photography to get anything really great. I take them anyway. Dan had a great jump! He got the water dip, and a really great swing back. I wish he was wearing a ‘Go Pro’ but its not allowed at the facility. The harder part for Dan was the being strung up, feet still bound, waiting for the boat to come get him. But he did it!!!! This was the best pic I could get:\n\nWhen Dan was done, he rushed up to me and we hugged. I was so proud of him. He felt that same sense of accomplishment I did earlier in the day.\n\nWe both got to stand together and watch Kris jump. He didn’t get to dip in the water, but he loved it regardless. Here they are in all their glory, after the jump:\n\nI was so proud of Dan, and glad we all had a fun day.\n\nWe had no idea how hungry we’d be after that, and how exhausted. We all had plans for later in the night that we were all much to tired to attend.\n\nAlthough we all felt bad about skipping out on plans, we were exhausted from all of the excitement, and feeling really good about how much we accomplished.\n\nMy day with Dan was a true success. It was originally about being able to spend a day with a friend. I was really happy to have picked Dan to spend a day with. He’s a fun guy, great to talk to, and an awesome friend. The fact that we each both got to face a fear made it even more amazing. We were also both happy for the moral support from Kris, who got right in there and did everything with us.\n\nI’m a lucky girl for having such great people in my life. Can’t wait for the next adventure.\n\nMovie Review #3: EVIL DEAD (2013) – Spoilers galore. Be warned.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the original ‘Evil Dead‘, ‘Evil Dead 2‘, and ‘Army of Darkness‘, were sheer perfection. These films have a dedicated fan base, so it’s a ballsy thing – to go ahead with a remake.\n\nI too, am a big fan. Take, for instance, the cake that made it’s appearance at my last birthday party.\n\nOn with the review. Here is what I liked:\n\n– The movie gave nods here and there to the fans. For example, Mia’s Michigan State sweater, the cabin itself, and the abandoned 1973 Oldsmobile– to name a few.\n\n-The subtle nods were appreciated. The film was also different in many ways. They did not recreate Ash, but sort of spread parts of Ash’s character to all of the cast.\n\n– I screamed at least 4 times. These were not due to cat scares…screaming because the kills (and maims) in this film were truly painful. It had been quite some time since I felt the need to cover my eyes during a movie. I didn’t-but I wanted to. In my opinion, that’s a good thing.\n\n– Jane Levy, who plays the role of Mia, really nailed the role. She had a full spectrum of emotions to portray, and her character arc is pretty insane. I hope we see more of her. This girl has talent! In fact, most of the characters were likeable, at least enough for me to care about what happens to them.\n\n– Solid moments of comic relief. Most of them involving Lou Taylor Pucci (Eric). This guy gets the piss knocked out of him, and won’t take it lying down.\n\n– The volume of blood, and the wonderful fact that it wasn’t CG! This is what I ask of a good horror film! Get a great special effects team, and do it right – the fans will notice if it’s digital blood. In the last scene of the film, it literally rains blood. It was amazing…gore done properly. So rare and wonderful.\n\nThings I didn’t like as much:\n\n– David and Olivia’s characters. Olivia (Jessica Lucas) was sometimes randomly hostile toward Natalie, although there is no real explanation or reason behind it. Shiloh Fernandez was only a decent actor in his portrayal of David, but not necessarily bad. I just didn’t walk away from the film hoping to see him in anything else.\n\nAll in all, I stayed thoroughly entertained throughout the film and enjoyed chatting to people about it after. I personally saw the film with the world’s biggest Evil Dead 2/Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell fan, and he loved it as well. I do recommend seeing this film theatrically, and not waiting until it’s released for home viewing. The effects will be much more effective on big screen, I’m sure.\n\nIf you are a fan of the original, go see the remake! Make sure to stay seated for after the credits.\n\nEven if you weren’t a huge fan, but enjoy a good horror flick, you don’t want to miss this one. It’s different enough.\n\nRATING: 8/10\n\nMovie Review #2: V/H/S – beware of spoilers!\n\nI’m a big fan of a well done horror anthology. Unfortunately, that’s where V/H/S falls flat. I can’t say I enjoyed the anthology as I hoped I would.\n\nFor those of you who aren’t familiar, V/H/S is a compilation of a few horror shorts, that are all recorded (at least in the film they are) on – you guessed it – VHS format.\n\nLet’s go with the same formula as my last post and first talk about what I liked:\n\nHannah Fierman in her role in the segment titled ‘Amateur Night’. This woman has eyes that stare straight through you, and she’s as creepy as Angela Bettis in ‘May‘ – which is a movie I enjoy very much.\n\nThe idea for Amateur Night. This segment was pretty original, entertaining, and painfully gory. I definitely liked it the most.\n\nIn ‘Second Honeymoon’ there is a brutal death that was pretty well done on the special FX standpoint, and I didn’t see the outcome occurring the way it did. I like surprises!\n\nIn ‘The Sick Thing That Happened To Emily When She Was Younger’, we got to see another sort of supernatural twist. I enjoyed that I thought the filmmakers were taking one route-then it went another way that I liked much more. This is not another ‘Paranormal Activity‘.\n\n‘Tuesday the 17th‘ is probably the short I liked the least (along with the wraparound story, but more on that later. I did like that it had some quirkiness to it. It didn’t ‘try’ hard enough though. But the idea had potential.\n\nI thought ’10/31/98′ was one of the best executions, I complained little about this one, and laughed out loud near the beginning. If ‘Amateur Night’ and ’10/31/98′ were the standard throughout the film, I would have been happier.\n\nAnd what I didn’t like? Well sure:\n\nAgain, I like horror for real scares, or bizarre, often comedic moments. There wasn’t enough of that here. A couple of the shorts attempted these things and I appreciated it. The rest of it was pretty unmemorable.\n\nThe characters. Not sure if it was due to poor writing, or poor casting, but I disliked almost every single character in every segment. There was a running theme of destructive, sexually sadistic men. I didn’t buy it. A whole compilation full of borderline rapists, with a few exceptions. Some were not that bad-but those poor souls didn’t seem to be able to…well…act. Which is their job, right?\n\nThe wraparound story…what the hell? I got nothing out of that, but irritated. It was a very underdeveloped idea.\n\nOverall, I think that the VHS format idea was awesome. I had been excited to get my hands on this movie for awhile. Maybe it was too over-hyped, and I ended up having expectations that the film couldn’t meet. I will be checking out V/H/S 2, because I hear it’s better then the first. Fingers crossed.\n\nRATING: 6.5/10\n\nMovie Review #1: The Possession – minor spoiler warning!\n\nI love horror movies. Love them. Zombie horror comes first, but I also enjoy a good slasher. I will admit that I love them because my survival instinct kicks in, and I get to yell out what I would do.\n\nHorror films about possessions petrify me. They are the exact reason I don’t do hard drugs (and the illegal thing, blah blah blah). To be completely out of control is a nightmare…but someone else being in control of me is even more terrifying. When I watch this sub-genre of horror, I expect to be terrified…and get disappointed when I’m not.\n\nFirst, lets talk about what I liked:\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan. Talented actor and looks like Javier Bardem and Robert Downey Jr‘s love child. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nCinematography. The film had some scenes that looked phenomenal. There was one in particular that I was impressed with, when the youngest daughter Em (Natasha Calis) went running for the dybbuk in a dumpster. (Look it up, I don’t know how to link in a fancy way yet).\n\nProducer-Sam Raimi. Like this.\n\nGrant Show. Yeah that’s right, Jake from Melrose Place. And he’s still handsome.\n\nThe unique plot line behind how the possession occurs. (Again, look up dybbuk).\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan (don’t you love a three named man?)’s proactive approach to fixing the issue with his daughter. Not a lot of the “I don’t believe this is happening logically, so therefore I will ignore everything” approach that most movies turn to because adults are too logical. It was refreshing for a character to see, believe, and press for change.\n\nThe Director. Ole Bornedal did a great job. He is also a great writer. I will watch more of his films, for sure.\n\nOn to the ‘what did not work for me’ part:\n\nThe pace. The Exorcist was slow in the beginning. It made up for it with real terror. This film didn’t pull that off.\n\nThe scare factor. Not scary…not to me. While we were watching this movie, I mentioned that it had an M. Night Shyamalan feel to it. Like a kid could watch it. When I watch a film of this sort I want to have to watch ‘Uncle Buck‘ before I go to bed to push away pending nightmares. There wasn’t anything really shocking.\n\nPredictability. I was able to predict (most) of what was about to happen. I don’t like doing that. Especially out loud. People that talk during movies suck. I definitely voiced my opinion during the movie.\n\nOverall: I would recommend this movie to a novice/whimpy horror viewer. Not for the seasoned. There is a lot of solid good, but not my cup o’tea.\n\nRATING: 6.5/10\n\n28 Weeks Later\n\nIn the past 28 weeks my life has changed a lot. Some of it for the better, some of it for the worse. Probably more so in the past 7 months than the past 3 years preceeding it.\n\nEven in the worst of times, what I can say is that I have had a lot of interesting experiences. I’ve said things I would never say, did things that I would never do, gotten over some fears, and developped new ones. I have challenged myself, other people, and dove right out of my comfort zone.\n\nIt’s been bittersweet, to say the least.\n\nOne of the results from the craziest year of my life-is knowing that I am capable of a lot more than I gave myself credit for. Now I have this adreneline rush to do more.\n\nI created a list of things I want to do in the upcoming 28 weeks. I will try my best to execute them and keep you updated through posts and photos.\n\nHere are my tasks:\n\nWatch 28 films and review them. That’s one a week, math wizards. I’m taking recommendations. Some of them I may have seen before, that I want to re-watch, or maybe I haven’t. Considering I am a cinephile, this won’t be a difficult task to get through.\n\nGet over my fear of balloons. Are you laughing yet? It’s a real thing. It’s called Globophobia. For real. When I see a child with a balloon especially, I run for the hills. They tend to push my balloon limits. By sitting on them…or pulling at them…or popping them. When a balloon pops, you hear a scream from me that would impress most slasher movie villians. That, or I dive for cover. Like I’ve lived in Compton. Anyway, this fear has got to go.\n\nGo to a music festival. Bonnaroo, June 2013-here I come! ( I am not counting Bluesfest). I am talking camping out and seeing as many shows as I can. YAY! Tennessee! *Cue Deliverince tune*\n\nTake a special interest class. Pole dancing, ceramics, cooking, mime, knitting, post-apocalyptic survival techniques. Whatever, I’m down.\n\nMeet another celebrity. I can only ride on Dane Cook‘s coat tails for so long. Everyone is well aware of how I stalked him in back of the building, armed with friends and relatives. I need a new story. Thanks for letting me grope you, Dane. On to the next.\n\nCook something that’s out of my comfort zone. I make fun of myself, but in reality, I’m decent with cooking. I don’t venture out with anything crazy, but I plan to.\n\nLight The Night. I had a crazy year, so I was unable to do the ‘Light the Night’ walk. My team is Heroes for Hodgekins. If you didn’t know, my Dad was previously diagnosed with Hodgekins disease. He is completely cancer free now! This is a cause close to my heart. For more information, visit http://www.lightthenight.ca/\n\nRead 10 books and review them. I am (was) an avid reader, before life got crazy. Recommendations will be taken, I only have two on my roster at the moment.\n\nTeach somebody something. I am not sure what I have to teach and whom. But prepared to be ‘schooled’.\n\nLet 3 friends or family members teach me something new. Golf? A french braid? Video editing? I don’t know.\n\nProduce something. Something is in the works. Co-producing counts. Stay tuned. Accomplished as of 047/28/2013!!!\n\nGirls night with Mom. My Mom and I are oddly similar: Contagious laugh-check. Opinionated-check. Big hair-check. Somehow we have never had a girl’s night. This is happening. Fun!\n\nHave a day at the war museum with Dad. So, I keep saying this is going to happen, but now that I live within a stones throw, it will really happen.\n\nWrite a script that gets filmed and screened. Oh, I write a lot. Just no one ever gets to view the final product.\n\nRenovate. Declutter, purge, redecorate my apartment within the means of my lease. I have this vision of painting my bedroom walls dark charcoal (boys, that means black), but I don’t know if this is the place to do it. We shall see!\n\nFlea market. I have memories of treasure hunting with my parents at flea markets. I want a unique ‘piece’ (insert piece o’crap joke here). I want to buy something that Ikea doesn’t have, essentially.\n\nSlumber party with my girlfriends. Life changes, people change…but the need to sit around in sleeping bags, gossip about boys, and eat popcorn with shaky processed cheese on it doesn’t.\n\nHost a theme party. I am good at these. I haven’t had one for a few years!\n\nFear Day with Dan DeMarbre – Completed!\n\nChosen by someone else\n\nChosen by someone else\n\nChosen by someone else\n\nChosen by someone else. What is this? I will randomly select 5 people out of a hat (cause I am innovative) to select tasks for me. There are guidelines though. Be forewarned.\n\nHave the best birthday party ever. I will be 29. 29. Isn’t that more relevant than the all famous 30th?! It’s the last year of my 20’s…\n\nGo ziplining. I actually want to change my pants just saying it. Why am I so scared of these things?!:(\n\nCreate a signature cocktail. My family and I know enough about booze. My Dad even makes his own wine and spirits! I’m sure I can do this!\n\nMake/create gifts for a random 4 friends or family members. Here is where that hat comes in handy again. I am a big fan of surprising people. The mushy side of me also wants to say that I am fortunate enough to know and be close to, the most amazing people in the world. I won’t say who and to, until it happens. It could be you:)\n\nHave a ‘I ACTUALLY COMPLETED EVERYTHING PARTY!’. And you’re invited!\n\nWish me luck!"
