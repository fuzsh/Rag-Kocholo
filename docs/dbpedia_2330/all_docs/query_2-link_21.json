        "text": "There is no God and no cure for cancer. Further proof of these truisms comes with news of the death of Ari Up (Ariane Daniele Forster) aged just 48. When she began singing with The Slits she was only 13 and this all female band came to epitomise the revolutionary DIY ethic of Punk and helped show that women need not be content to slavishly follow stereotypical roles as passive, pretty adornments. They were not, nor had any desire to be, typical girls.\n\nPlenty of other bands pretended not to able to play their instruments but The Slits were genuinely inept. They more than made up for this with attitude and an instinctive recognition of how you could incorporate dub rhythms and banal words to create a sound that was both radical and fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I never got to see them live but well remember being entranced by their sessions for John Peel. The current crimson wave of girl bands from the US owe a great debt to their innovative and fearless example.\n\nThis recording from the Peel session of Love Und Romance is nothing less than a classic which includes the following great lyrics (when Ari could remember them):\n\nOh oh oh sweet love and romance / I’m so glad we met by chance\n\nCall you everyday on the telephone / Break your neck if you ain’t home\n\nRelated Articles\n\nR.I.P. Ari Up of the Slits (pitchfork.com)\n\nRIP Ari Up, Slits hero (timeoutny.com)\n\nIt is every parent’s nightmare and, not surprisingly, news of the brutal murder of 15-year-old Sarah Scazzi is headline news today in Italy.\n\nIt is proof, if proof were needed, that human beings are capable of monstrous acts.\n\nIt also shows that television is a medium devoid of morals or integrity when it come to reporting such horrific events.\n\nThe media circus rolls in like an out of control juggernaut, sacrificing decency in the name of spectacle.\n\nSarah had been missing for 42 days and yesterday came the confession by her Uncle that he strangled his niece, then raped her before dumping the girl’s body in a well.\n\nThe news of the killer’s confession was delivered live on TV, on a programme in which Sarah’s mother was present. Shockingly, no one thought it appropriate to suspend the broadcast as this breaking news came in.\n\nToday daytime TV pours over the sordid details and show earlier interviews with the uncle faking tears for the missing girl. These interviews are continually replayed and the photos of Sarah are repeated until they cease to be sources of information but become part of a voyeuristic entertainment package.\n\nThe case would not have had the same impact (or coverage) if Sarah hadn’t had a Facebook profile, if videos of her did not exist or if the TV crew hadn’t interviewed the uncle.\n\nAnd what really can be gained by dwelling on the sordid details of this terrible crime anyway? This, sadly, is a crime where no lessons can be learnt. The only person to blame is the monster who committed the barbaric crime.\n\nThe medium is the message and the message here is that there is a sickness at the heart of our so-called civilised society which TV exploits without offering the compassion and humanity needed to bring about change.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMother told live on Italian TV of daughter’s murder (guardian.co.uk)\n\nMother told missing daughter dead on live TV show (sfgate.com)\n\nThe Collapse of Privacy (psychologytoday.com)"
