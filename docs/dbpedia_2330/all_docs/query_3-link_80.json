        "text": "The Slits: ‘Ping Pong Affair’\n\nAri Up, founding member and frontwoman of legendary punks The Slits, has died.\n\nThe news was broken by John Lydon (Sex Pistols/Public Image Ltd), who was Up’s stepfather. All that’s known at this point is that she died of a “serious illness.”\n\nUp, real name Arianna Forster, formed the Slits in the mid-‘70s at just 14, who after breaking through with their 79’ debut LP Cut, became a huge influence on what would follow, particularly the post-punk and riot grrrl movements. Musically the Slits were as influenced by eccentric, wonky reggae as they were the punk bands they were associated with, but their attitude, exemplified by their live shows and controversial sleeve art, was pure uncompromising punk. Up would go on to work with Adrian Sherwood’s New Age Steppers, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry and more as a solo artist.\n\nAlongside bassist Tessa Pollitt, Ari reformed the band mid-way through the last decade, releasing two new records and proving that they’d lost none of their nuttiness at various festival gigs last year. Up was 48 years old."
