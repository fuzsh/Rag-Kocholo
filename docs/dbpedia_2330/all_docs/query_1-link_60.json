        "text": "Penguins Kill Polar Bears: (L-R) Fraser Sanaghan, Gavin Cormack, Ben Proudlock and Kieran McGuckian\n\nIt’s a lovely Saturday afternoon in September when I meet Penguins Kill Polar Bears at Edinburgh’s Southern Cross cafe. Although drummer Kieran McGuckian is missing, the rest of the band – bassist Gavin Cormack, singer Ben Proudlock and new guitarist Fraser Sanaghan, and manager Murray Reid (AKA Manky Bastard) join me for a coffee fulled hour or so at the back of the cafe.\n\nThere’s much chuckling about the poor gag that I once started one early feature on them (a bad joke involving polar bears and penguins -if you haven’t heard it, it’s really not that funny). However, it transpires that this isn’t the first time that they’ve been in a band named after an animal. Ben admits that the band PKPB emerged out of were called the Peacocks. Who did they sound like? ‘Um, Kings Of Leon and the Red Hot Chili Peppers!’ However, when their bassist left, Gavin joined and they became Penguins Kill Polar Bears. At the time they were all still at school at Linlithgow Academy (apart from Fraser – the most recent member to join and previously a member of Lions. Chase. Tigers). Though the recent, excellent Dawn EP is their first release proper, an early release called ‘We All Got Saved’ was sold at school gigs.\n\nAnd if you’ve heard said EP, then you’ll know it’s not the likes of Kings Of Leon and the Red Hot Chili Peppers that PKPB evoke now, but rather the sound of a scottish band mining their own wonderful post-rock sound. They’re quite proud of the fact that the only notable alumnus of Linlithgow Academy is Iain Cooke from Aereogramme, who they definitely cite as an influence. They’re now based in Edinburgh, but feel that there’s a cliqueness in the music scene here, with a bias towards folk music. They are, however, too polite to name names! Ben particularly states that he would rather see a band ‘outside a scene.’\n\nThere are of course those acts that it’s fair to say are fellow travellers. They’ve mainly had coverage from blogs rather than the radio but there’s also been bands tipping each other off about them. Frightened Rabbit for example tipped off There Will be fireworks about them They will be recording their debut album at The Mill theatre in Strathaven, which is where Fireworks recorded their debut album. Other bands that they’ve shared stages with include the likes of the Twilight Sad, the Gothenburg Address and Pensioner. However, they are trying to break out of the same circle -‘there’s a risk of playing the same gigs with same people everytime,’ they note, sagely.\n\nTheir gigs both north and south of the border have elicited praise but also some weird behaviour. In Dundee one local nutter turned up and started to attack the merchandise stand whilst the band were playing. And then there was the guy who turned up with the Tazer in Stirling…Still, I have to laugh with them at their description of Edinburgh’s Electric Circus venue as being ‘like a strip-club out of Bladerunner.’\n\nHaving played south of the border as well, I ask how they feel they go down there. Discussing the notion of scottish bands and how they’re portrayed down south, Gavin is quite philosophical on this issue. ‘ There is a hype about the scottish accent, maybe in England it doesn’t go down so well,’ he says, thoughtfully. ‘I’ve gone off bands that sing with an American accent. Sing with your own accent!’ he adds, forcefully.\n\nAlthough they describe themselves as being ‘9-5 slaves to the wage’ they have been writing and touring throughout the course of the year. There’s no fixed plans for an album as yet, though there is some talk about writing 15 songs and selecting 10. There’s another ten gigs scheduled between now and the end of November, but the plan is that come December and January they’d like to focus on studio work.\n\n‘Dawn’s a collection of songs that we’d written over two years,’ explains Gavin. ‘We’ve always tried to do something a bit different from other bands. We wrote ‘Sandcastles’ two guitarists ago!’\n\nThe aim is for the album to be a complete piece from start to finish, and it’s going to be the next chapter in the band’s history. However -perhaps indicative of the age we are in both financially and independently – they are not looking for a record deal to put their album out. ‘We can make enough press for ourselves,’ they reason. ‘The major benefit of a label is them putting the money in -but you then have to pay them back.’ Murray: money’s not the most important thing. As long as we get petrol.’\n\nProgressing like they are, I’m sure they’ll more than get their travel costs paid!\n\nPenguins Kill Polar Bears’ bandcamp is here\n\nViolens -‘Amoral.’ (Static Recital)\n\nHaving really enjoyed Violens’ self-titled EP from last year I was really looking forward to reviewing this album. After the first couple of hearings, I must admit that I felt slightly disappointed. A love of eighties jangle pop -and indeed 80s indie in general – no bad thing in itself, but haven’t The Drums rather got that sewn up at the moment? I’d be willing to bet that they own The Smiths, You Can’t Hide Your Love Forever and Lowlife…\n\nYet by about the third listen, it starts to click. Yes it is very eighties indie-influenced, but even with the listener bearing this in mind, the NYC trio have drawn on their influences to produce a pretty solid debut LP. It is a tad over-produced at times, particularly on opening track ‘The dawn of your happiness is rising’; nevertheless it hangs together quite well as an album.\n\nAnd while it’s easy to hear their influences, it isn’t if all the songs are re-writes (though if you want to hear a band that shamelessly re-wrote 80s indie stuff, check out Dutch band The Essence who wore their love of The Cure on the sleeves to the point of cringemaking). ‘The dawn of your happiness is rising’ evokes the Smiths at their most upbeat and ‘Acid Reign’ reminds me of prime New Order.\n\nA good start, let’s hope that they find their own voice on their next album.\n\n***\n\nAmoral is out now on Static Recital.\n\nViolens -‘Acid Reign.’ mp3\n\nViolens -‘Violent Sensation Descends.’ mp3\n\nEven as I head into my mid-thirties, I’m still of the belief that music has a duty to disturb as well as to delight, to intrigue, and perplex. This track was waiting for me in my inbox when I got home, and four plays in the last half hour alone, I’m still trying to get my head around this track by Esben and the Witch, entitled ‘Warpath.’\n\nEsben and the Witch hail from Brighton and they are Daniel, Thomas and Rachel. Signed to the still achingly cool indie Matador, they are set to release their debut album Violet Cries. The press release jokes about them ‘petitioning retailers to add an “Uneasy Listening” bin card to their sales floor.’ Actually I like that idea. Their stuff is beyond ethereal. Their myspace is spooky and not in a shlock-horror way either. And it is -somehow-delicious. The only band in the world I can think to compare them to is Siouxsie and the banshees circa Juju.\n\nThis is not a track to fall asleep to, or to dance to. It is a track to give your complete and undivided attention to.\n\nEsben and the Witch -‘Warpath.’ mp3\n\nSo far they have released the 33 EP and the limited-edition 7″ and 12″s ‘Lucia, at the Precipice’ and ‘Marching Song.’\n\nThe video for ‘Marching Song’ is very simple, very disturbing and very good:\n\nAnd this video for ‘Lucia, at the precipice’ -probably wrongly -reminds me of Whistle and I’ll Come to You\n\nIt’s already been a bad year for losing musicians -and I’m absolutely gutted to learn today that Ari Up, lead singer of The Slits has died, at the age of cancer at the age of just 48.\n\nIf punk was supposed to have a scorched earth policy, there were certain acts who showed just how conservative peole might be, underneath it all. One act that might apply to was Suicide, but another was the Slits. At just fourteen Ari (born Ariane Daniele Forster) was the singer of the Slits, and they were touring and terrifying the life out of people. I was privileged to interview guitarist Viv Albertine earlier this year. She talked of it being a difficult time being in The Slits were people were incredibly anatgonistic, and where John Peel was the only person prepared to support them.\n\nBut Island Records released their debut album Cut, which plays as I type this. Not only did the cover unnerve people – the Rough Trade allegedly had a meeting about whether they should be stocking it, but this take on punk and reggae was something new and very raw. Yet like many records of that year – The Pop Group’s Y and PIL’s Metal Box being two other examples – shows just how ahead of the game they were. After a second album in 1981, Return Of The Giant Slits, the band split. But not without influencing a huge number of female artists – most notably Madonna. Ari also contributed vocals to one of my favourite cover versions ever the New Age Steppers’ ‘ take on Junior Byles’ ‘Fade Away.’\n\nHaving spent much of her time travelling and raising her sons, as well as being ivolved in the Dancehall scene, Ari reactivated the Slits in the last decade, releasing the Revenge of the Killer Slits EP and the Trapped Animal album.\n\nA true original, responsible for music that was both ground-breaking and gere-bender, the press may be commenting on whose step-daughter she was, but first and foremost, she was the leader of one of the most wonderful bands Britain ever produced.\n\nMy favourite Slits song…\n\nThe Slits -‘Typical Girls.’ mp3\n\nTwo awesome covers…\n\nThe Slits -‘I Heard It Through The Grapevine.’ mp3\n\nNew Age Steppers -‘Fade Away.’ mp3"
