        "text": "Do you have a little LeBron in the making? Or, for you older parents, a Baby Bird? Bad puns aside, registration is open now for the winter YMCA youth basketball league and not only are they looking for players but for coaches and officials as well.\n\nThe league will run for 8 weeks, January 8th through February 23, 2024, for boys and girls in the 1st through 4th grades. There will be separate boys and girls' divisions and players will not be grouped by schools. Sites of competition will rotate between Ramsay Elementary Gym, the Butte Knights of Columbus, Whitter Elementary Gymnasium and at Webster-Garfield with games being played on weekdays and Saturdays. There is a limited number of spaces available, so be sure to register now to ensure your child has a spot. The cost is $60 per player for members of the Butte Family YMCA and $95 dollars per player for non-members. The registration cost includes a team t-shirt, and the registration deadline is December 31. No late entries will be accepted but waitlists will be created if limits are reached. All potential players must register in person at the Butte Family YMCA at 2975 Washoe St.\n\nThe Butte Family YMCA is also actively looking for coaches and officials for the Winter Basketball League. Volunteer officials and coaches are vital to the program's success, and anyone interested can contact the YMCA's Sports Director, Amy Schulte, at Amy.Schulte@butteymca.org. Not only will you be helping the program, but you will be positively influencing many young lives and can potentially be building bonds that will last a lifetime.\n\nFor further details, call (406)782-1266."
