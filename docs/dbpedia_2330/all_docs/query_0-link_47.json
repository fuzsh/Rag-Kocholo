        "text": "With the thrill of the Christmas season behind us and more and more of our kids' time being spent indoors, this may be the time of year where they need to get out and run. And maybe, play a little defense. Whatever the case, or experience level for that matter may be, the 10th Lil' Dribblers basketball league gets underway this Saturday at the East Middle School Gymnasium, and from the ages they are welcoming, experience will not be an issue at all.\n\nLil' Dribblers is for kids up to 7 years of age, although they are willing to fudge a little bit on the age restrictions, and the program is more of an open-gym than a basketball league. The kids play at their own pace and learn as much about teamwork and friendship as they do about basketball fundamentals. The program is under the direction of Mike Bauer, whose basketball and personal credibility is rarely matched, and you will even find veterans of this little kids' program wearing varsity Purple and Maroon today.\n\nWhat makes this program special is that it is completely free thanks to local sponsors and volunteers. If your kid wants to play, just show up Saturdays at East Middle School, 2600 Grand Avenue. The program will run from 9am to 11am every Saturday through March 23, except for January 20th, February 3rd and February 17th. No registration is necessary, and the program is for boys and girls. Please thank the program's sponsors, First Montana Bank, Play 2 Win Tix, Uptop Clothing, Harrington Pepsi, Universal Athletics and Mariah's Challenge. Please direct any questions to Mike Bauer at (406) 490-7491 or Matt Paul at (406) 560-3520."
