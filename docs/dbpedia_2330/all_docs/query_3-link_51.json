        "text": "AO: Its funny because peoples perceptions are that everyone was fucking at the time, but it was a much safer time to be a girl. . Bands, everyone would sleep in the same bed, but no-one would try anything, you could sleep round anybodys flat and not wake up and find someone sticking it in your ear in the middle of the night. These girls today have a much harder time.\n\nAri: These girls today have it much, much harder, much more pressure from that angle. Its funny, everyone has this image of sex and drugs and rock at the time, but these were the things we were against actually. Even though sometimes it did get a bit out of hand with the punk thing and the drug thing but the philosophy was there that we shouldnt and most of us kept up to it, most of us didnt get caught up with that rock and roll sex and drugs thing..\n\nMsD: We had too much to do ..\n\nAri: We had too much to do, and even the people you think were the most irresponsible, like The Sex Pistols, with that name, they were totally nothing to do with sex. John [Lydon] my stepfather later, he protected me from all that. He had a weird circle of people around him sometimes. But whenever I was around he tried to shelter me from it. He had friends who were prostitutes and lesbians who were quite pushy, but he kept them away from me, he shielded me. He hung out with some crazy people, he used to go to that big club he used to hang out at, that lesbian club, do you remember what it was called ...?\n\nMsD: Louises\n\nAri: Yes! Yes, Louises, you know it? I dont know how I got in, I was only fourteen. It was such a weird time period, because now you would have to have your ID but we got in everywhere, I was everywhere, the 100 club, Louises, The Speakeasy which we took over from the hippies\n\nMsD: Ah, I loved the Speakeasy.\n\nAri: Yeh, the Speakeasy, it was a good one because it was a turning point. Punks didnt really hang out there at first but it was a turning point. You know that was Chris Speddings place, he was my stepfather before John. And my mum was hanging out at the Speakeasy a lot. And then sometimes John took Nora (my mum) to Louises and one night I ended up for some reason with John somewhere in the middle of nowhere and his circles of prostitutes and they did a bit of naughty stuff, but he kept me protected.\n\nAO: People were much more responsible, actually..\n\nMusic Machine Dec 1978"
