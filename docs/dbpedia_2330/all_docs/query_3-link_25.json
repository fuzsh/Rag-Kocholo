        "text": "The Slits‘ frontwomen Ari Up has died at the age of 48.\n\nThe singer – real name Arianna Forster – passed away yesterday (October 20).\n\nNews of her death was confirmed by the Sex Pistols and PiL frontman John Lydon, who is married to Forster‘s mother. He delivered the news about her death on his website.\n\n“John [Lydon] and Nora [Forster] have asked us to let everyone know that Nora‘s daughter Arianna – aka Ari-Up – died today (October 20) after a serious illness,” was posted on JohnLydon.com. “She will be sadly missed. Everyone at JohnLydon.com and PiLofficial.com would like to pass on their heartfelt condolences to John, Nora and family. Rest in Peace.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForster formed The Slits in 1976 at the age of 14. They released two albums, 1979’s ‘Cut’ and 1981’s ‘Return Of The Giant Slits’, before splitting up.\n\nShe later went on to release a solo album called ‘Dread More Dan Dead’ in 2005, among other projects, before reforming The Slits later that year."
