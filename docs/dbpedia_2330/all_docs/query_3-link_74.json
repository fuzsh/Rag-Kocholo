She was also one of the coolest people to ever grace this planet—much too cool for us, apparently.\n\nI never saw the Slits live, but here’s a remembrance by someone who did (in 1977!). The Guardian has also posted pictures (it’s where I stole the above photo from). And here’s Pitchfork Media’s obituary.\n\nBelow, Slits videos, about all we have now to hold onto.\n\n…and there are a ton more at YouTube, mainly of more recent performances.\n\nGodspeed, Ari Up. Everything that I know about dancing, I learned from you. You’ll be greatly missed."
