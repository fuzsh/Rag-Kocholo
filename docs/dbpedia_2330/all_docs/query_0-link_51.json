Once spoken, the inoa assumed a mystical existence and the power to help and protect the one named. It was believed that the more a name was spoken, the more powerful it became.\n\nFind your name into Hawaiian. If your name is not found, you may contact us and we will research your name through Hawaii’s Bishop Museum."
