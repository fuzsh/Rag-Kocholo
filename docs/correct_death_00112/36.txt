"The Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Memorial"

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was one of America's great poets. From 1837 until his death, he lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from the campus of Harvard University where from 1854 he was a professor. His home, on Brattle Street in Cambridge, was a frequent gathering place for many of New England's finest writers including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson. From July 1775 - April 1776, George Washington was headquartered in this same house.

Following Longfellow's death, his children established a park in Cambridge that stretched from the house to the Charles River. In 1914, a memorial to Longfellow was dedicated, executed by Daniel Chester French in 1913, that featured a bronze bust of Longfellow and low relief scluptures of characters from six of Longfellow's epic poems. The result, set amongst bushes and benches, is a traquil place for contemplation on this great American writer.

Today the Longfellow House is a National Historic Site administered by the U.S. National Parks Service. French's monument has fallen into some disrepair, with several noses of characters having been defaced, graffiti painted on the side of the monument, and overgrown shrubbery cluttering the landscape. Nevertheless, the Longfellow Memorial stands as an important part of French's ouvre and one that nobly enshrines the memory of America's great epic poet.
