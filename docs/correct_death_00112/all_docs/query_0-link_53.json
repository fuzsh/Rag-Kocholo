For the Cotton family, it took four generations before Lt. John Cotton married into a Mayflower line. After the Revolutionary War, he moved to the Ohio Territory along with his wife and his wife’s parents.\n\nThe Last Will and Testament of Keziah Little\n\n(Mayflower Quarterly Vol. 68 No. 1 March 2002 & edited October 2018)\n\n© Barry A. Cotton\n\nAfter the Northwest Territory was ceded to the United States at the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785, the Ohio Company purchased one million acres of land along the Ohio River and a number of families from New England migrated to Ohio in 1788 and 1789. One of the first families to settle Ohio was Nathaniel Little, his wife Keziah Atwood/Adams, his daughter Lucy and Lucy’s husband Lieutenant John Cotton, who served with Nathaniel Little in the War of Revolution. The marriage of John Cotton and Lucy Little links two of the oldest and most distinguished families of Old Plymouth Colony. Lucy Little is descended from Richard Warren, Mayflower passenger and signer of the Mayflower Compact. And, Lieutenant John Cotton is descended from Rev. John Cotton, who fled England in 1633 to escape trial by Charles I for being puritan.\n\nOpening up the Ohio River Valley had been the dream of George Washington ever since he first surveyed the area in 1770. After the Revolutionary War, Washington’s aide-de-camp, General Rufus Putnam, helped realize this dream by founding the Ohio Company on March 1, 1786 at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern in Boston, Massachusetts. Another Putnam, Colonel Israel Putnam Jr., joined Rufus Putnam in settling Ohio. Rufus Putnam and Israel Putnam Jr. were related, as their grandfathers were half brothers. During Washington’s presidency, Congress made Rufus Putnam the first Surveyor General of the United States and he is known as the Father of Ohio. Major General Israel Putnam Sr. was a hero at the Battle of Bunker Hill and the father of Colonel Israel Putnam Jr. whom Keziah Little named executor of her Will. Not only was Israel Putnam Jr. named executor of the Last Will and Testament of Keziah Little, he also is shown in the appraisement of Keziah’s estate as having signed a note with Keziah for $368.75 due on June 4, 1814. Israel Putnam Jr. died just prior to the disposition of the Will of Keziah Little so the court named his son, Aaron Waldo Putnam, executor after a $500 bond was posted with Aaron’s brother David Putnam and Keziah’s grandson, Robert Bradford, who also owed Keziah $33.84 in a note due on June 4, 1814.\n\nThe ancestors of the Little, Cotton & Bradford lines (shown below) were all from Massachusetts and most had lived in Plymouth since the landing of the Mayflower in 1620. Richard Warren, Mayflower passenger, was one of these and his daughter, Anna Warren, married Thomas Little in Plymouth on 19 April 1633 to establish the Little line in America. The Cotton family of Old Plymouth Colony was established in 1668 when Rev. John Cotton Jr. became vicar of the Plymouth Church. The Bradford Family descends from William Bradford, Mayflower passenger and Governor of Plymouth Colony. Captain Robert Bradford married Lucy Little’s sister, Keziah Little. As a result, the Bradford grandchildren (shown below) descend from two separate Mayflower lines. The Last Will and Testament of Keziah Little brings to light a branch of Mayflower descendants previously undocumented in the membership of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants. Included in this branch are at least five generations descending from the seventeen grandchildren named in Keziah Little’s Will.\n\nBradford: (Robert Bradford, Samuel Bradford & Otis Bradford)\n\nCotton: (Theophilus Cotton, Lucy Cotton, Joshua Cotton & John Cotton)\n\nDier: ( Sally Dier)\n\nLittle: (Welthy Little, Charles Little, Henry Little, Lewis Little, Nathaniel Little & George Little)Nashe: (George Nashe)\n\nSeall: (Betsy Seall & Morris Seall)\n\nThe three witnesses to the signing of the Last Will and Testament of Keziah Little also originated from New England and were among the first families to settle Ohio. Colonel Ebenezer Battelle graduated from Harvard College in 1775 and fought as a Colonel in the Massachusetts Militia during the Revolutionary War. After the war, Colonel Battelle joined the Ohio Company and migrated to Ohio with his son, Ebenezer Battellle Jr. in 1788. Luther Dana was the son of William Dana who had been an artillery captain during the Revolutionary War and both father and son migrated to Ohio in 1788. Philip Greene of Warwick, Rhode Island settled in Belpre, Ohio in 1796 with his parents and nine brothers & sisters.\n\nThe Last Will and Testament of Keziah Little documents the intermarriage of these two families as Lucy Cotton is named Keziah Little’s daughter and the children of Lucy Cotton (Theophilus, Lucy, Joshua and John Cotton) are named Keziah Little’s grandchildren. The following is a transcription of Keziah Little’s Last Will and Testament that is located in the records of the Washington County Courthouse in Marietta, Ohio.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nIn the Name of God, Amen, I Keziah Little of Belpre in the County of Washington and State of Ohio being in health of body and of a sound disposing mind and memory (for which I bless God) Do make and Ordain this as my last Will and Testament (to wit) 1st that my debts and Funeral charges be paid, 2ndly I give and bequeath to my three daughters Lydia Crain, Christian Tisdall and Lucy Cotton one dollar each 3.

We know he was from London and the evidence seems to indicate that he was a man of some wealth.\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth, arrived in Plymouth on the Anne in 1623 with the couples’ daughters Abigail, Anna, Elizabeth, Mary and Sarah. Two sons, Nathaniel and Joseph, were born to the Warrens in Plymouth.\n\nRichard Warren died in 1628. His wife Elizabeth outlived him by 45 years, dying at Plymouth in 1673. Her death was noted in the Records of Plymouth Colony (PCR 8:35) : “Mistris Elizabeth Warren, an aged widdow, aged above 90 yeares, deceased on the second of October, 1673, whoe, haveing lived a godly life, came to her grave as a shocke of corn fully ripe.”\n\nDuring the long period of her widowhood, Elizabeth Warren’s name appears in the records of Plymouth Colony. She appears first as executor of her husband’s estate, next paying taxes owed by a head of household, and finally as an independent agent in her own right.\n\nAn article by Edward J. Davies in the April 2003 issue of The American Genealogist gives evidence that Elizabeth Warren may have been the daughter of Augustine Walker. An Elizabeth Walker, daughter of Augustine Walker, married a Richard Warren in Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, on April 14, 1610. The will of Augustine Walker, dated April 19, 1613, refers not only to his daughter Elizabeth Warren but also her 3 daughters : Mary, Ann and Sarah. These three Warren daughters correspond to three of the Warren daughters who were passengers on the Anne in 1623.\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nA 1620 Mayflower passenger, Richard Warren is unusual because, although Bradford in his “Decreasing and Increasing” gives him the honorific title “Mr.”, he does not mention him at all in the text of his history, and very little is known about him except for a few brief mentions elsewhere. In Mourt’s Relation, p 15, Winslow lists ten men on an early expedition at Cape Cod, three of whom, including Richard Warren, were from London.\n\nJudging from land transactions of his widow, Elizabeth, who came over in 1623 on the Anne with daughters Abigail, Anna, Elizabeth, Mary and Sarah, the family appears to have been one of the wealthier ones at Plymouth. However, he was not one of the eight selected Undertakers in 1627. Nathaniel Morton wrote for the year 1628, “This Year died Mr. Richard Warren, who… was an useful Instrument and during his life bare a deep share in the Difficulties and Troubles of the first Settlement of the Plantation of New-Plimouth” (Memoriall, p.68). His widow, Elizabeth Warren, was given the unique distinction of having a law passed unanimously by the whole court to giver her the Purchaser status her deceased husband had had, “hee dying before he had performed the bargaine, the said Elizabeth performed the same after his decease, and also for the establishing of the lotts of lands given formerly by her unto her sonnes in law, Richard Church, Robert Bartlett, and Thomas Little”.\n\nThe three sons-in-law had married respectively daughters Elizabeth, Mary, and Anna, and the other two daughter were married later, Sarah to Mayflower passenger John Cooke, and Abigail to Anthony Snow. Richard and Elizabeth Warren had two sons born at Plymouth, Nathaniel, who married Sarah Walker, and Joseph, who married Priscilla Faunce- see the second revision (1986) of the Families of the Pilgrims booklet on Warren. Widow Elizabeth Warren’s servant, Thomas Williams, was charged with speaking profane and blasphemous speeches to her, but the court released him with a warning after he made a humble acknowledgment of his offence. She died at Plymouth 2 October 1673, aged above ninety years, “having lived a godly life, came to her grave as a shoke of corn fully ripe”.\n\nThe English orign of the Warrens, though much searched for, has not yet been found, but she was definitely not Elisabeth Jowett, as some have claimed. Athough Warren’s grand daughter Elizabeth Warren had a child by Joseph Doty, she did not, as has been written, marry him.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nFrom: Mayflower Families through Five Generation: Richard Warren (Volume 18 Part 1) 4\n\nGovernor Bradford wrote “Mr. Richard Warren lived some four of five years and had his wife come over to him, by whom he had two sons before (he ) died, and one of them is married and hath two children. So his increase is four. But he had five daughters more come over with his wife, who are all married and living, and have many children.” The wife and 5 daughters came to Plymouth on the “Anne” in 1623.\n\nIn “Mourt’s Relation” under date of “sixt of December” it is stated “and three of london, Richard Warren, Steeven Hopkins and Edward Dotte…” This statement that he was from London is all we know about the origin of Richard Warren despite considerable research to learn more.\n\nThe 22 May 1627 Division of Cattle names Richard Warren, wife Elizabeth Warren, Nathaniell Warren, Joseph Warren, Mary Warren, Anna Warren, Sara Warren, Elizabeth Warren and Abigail Warren.\n\nIn a deed dated 28 Sept. 1629 the land which Thomas Clarke sold to William Bradford was bounded on one side by the land of “widow Warren.”.\n\nAt the 7 March 1636/7 court it was agreed that Elizabeth Warren, widow, the relict of Mr. Richard Warren, deceased, was to be a “Purchaser” as she had performed the bargain after he husband’s decease, and also for confirming the land formerly given by her to her son-in-law Richard Church, Robert Bartlett and Thomas Little in marriage with their wives, her daughters.\n\nIn a codicil to his will dated 16 July 1667 Nathaniel Warren mentions his mother Elizabeth Warreen, his brother Joseph Warren and his sisters Mary Bartlett Sr., Anna Little, Sarah Cooke, Elizabeth Church, and Abigail Snow.\n\nOn 4 March 1673/74 Mary Bartlett, the wife of Robert Bartlett, acknowledged she had received full satisfaction for her share of the estate of Mistris Elizabeth Warren, deceased; and John Cooke, in behalf of all here sisters testified to the same. The court settled the remainder of the estate on Joseph Warren.4\n\nExcerpt taken from:\n\nPlymouth Colony: Its History & People 1620-1691 by Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Former Historian General General Society of Mayflower Descendants ISBN 0-916489-18-3\n\nRICHARD WARREN5\n\nORIGIN: London\n\nMIGRATION: 1620 on Mayflower\n\nFIRST RESIDENCE: Plymouth\n\nESTATE: In the 1623 Plymouth division of land Richard Warren received an uncertain number of acres (perhaps two) as a passenger on the Mayflower, and five acres as a passenger on the Anne (presumably for his wife and children) [PCR 12:4-6]. In the 1627 Plymouth division of cattle Richard Warren, his wife Elizabeth Warren, Nathaniel Warren, Joseph Warren, Mary Warren, Anna Warren, Sarah Warren, Elizabeth Warren and Abigail Warren were the first nine persons in the ninth company [PCR 12:12]. He was one of the purchasers [PCR 2:177].\n\nIn the 25 March 1633 Plymouth tax list Widow Warren was assessed 12s., and in the list of 27 March 1634, 9s. [PCR 1:10, 27].\n\nOn 1 July 1633 “Mrs. Warren and Robt. Bartlet” were allowed to mow where they did the previous year, and again 14 March 1635/6 [PCR 1:15, 41].\n\nOn 28 October 1633, a grant of Richard Warren’s land on which he was required to erect a dwelling, returned to the court “for want of building” and it was regranted to Mr. Ralph Fogg, provided he pay Widow Warren sufficiently for her fence remaining there [PCR 1:18].\n\nOn 7 March 1636/7 “it is agreed upon, by the consent of the whole Court, that Elizabeth Warren, widow, the relict of Mr. Richard Warren, deceased, shall be entered, and stand, and be purchaser instead of her said husband, as well because that (he dying before he had performed the said bargain) the said Elizabeth performed the same after his decease, as also for the establishing of the lots of lands given formerly by her unto her sons-in-law Richard Church, Robert Bartlett and Thomas Little, in marriage with their wives, her daughters” [PCR 1:54, 2:177].\n\nOn 5 May 1640 “Richard Church, Rob[er]te Bartlett, Thomas Little, & Mrs. Elizabeth Warren are granted enlargements at the heads of their lots to the foot of the Pyne Hills, leaving a way betwixt them and the Pyne Hills, for cattle and carts to pass” [PCR 1:152].\n\nOn 11 June 1653, as the result of a disagreement between Mrs. Elizabeth Warren and her son, Nathaniel, and a petition offered in court by Mrs. Jane Collier on behalf of her grandchild, Sarah, wife of Nathaniel Warren, the court chose four indifferent men to settle the matter of access to lands [MD 2:64, citing PCLR 2:73].\n\nOn 4 March 1673/4 Mary Bartlett, wife of Robert Bartlett, came into this court and owned “that she hath received full satisfaction for whatsoever she might claim as due from the estate of Mistris Elizabeth Warren, deceased, and John Cooke, in the behalf of all her sisters, testified the same before the court; and the court doth hereby settle the remainder of the said estate on Joseph Warren” [PCR 5:139-40].\n\nBIRTH: By about 1578 based on estimated date of marriage.\n\nDEATH: Plymouth 1628. (“This year died Mr. Richard Warren, who hath been mentioned before in this book, and was an useful instrument; and during his life bore a deep share in the difficulties and troubles of the first settlement of the plantation of New-Plymouth” [Morton 85].\n\nMARRIAGE: By about 1609 Elizabeth _____; she died at Plymouth on 2 October 1673, aged about 90 (probably an exaggeration) [PCR 8:35]. (Elizabeth’s maiden name has been given as “March” in many sources, without documentation).\n\nCHILDREN:\n\ni) MARY, b. say 1609; m. say 1629 ROBERT BARTLETT (date based on estimated age of children at their marriages).\n\nii) ANN, b. say 1613; m. Plymouth 19 April 1633 THOMAS LITTLE [PCR 1:13].\n\niii) SARAH, b. say 1614; m. Plymouth 28 March 1634 John Cooke Junior [PCR 1:29], son of FRANCIS COOKE.\n\niv) ELIZABETH, b. say 1615; m. by 1635/6 RICHARD CHURCH (he shared mowing land with Mrs. Warren 14 March 1635/6 [PCR 1:41]).\n\nv) ABIGAIL, b. say 1619; m. Plymouth 8 (or 9) November 1639 Anthony Snow [PCR 1:134].\n\nvi) NATHANIEL, b. Plymouth say 1624 (Bradford says he was born here, and his mother was a passenger on the Anne in 1623); m. Plymouth 19 November 1645 Sarah Walker [PCR 2:94]. (See WILLIAM COLLIER for discussion of her possible ancestry.)\n\nvii) JOSEPH, b. Plymouth by 1627; m. about 1653 Priscilla Faunce, daughter of JOHN FAUNCE (eldest child b. Plymouth 23 September 1653 [PCR 8:33]).\n\nCOMMENTS: In his accounting of the passengers on the Mayflower Bradford included “Mr. Richard Warren, but his wife and children were left behind and came afterwards” [Bradford 442]. As of 1651, Bradford reported that “Mr. Richard Warren lived some four or five years and had his wife come over to him, by whom he had two sons before [he] died, and one of them is married and hath two children. So his increase is four. But he had five daughters more came over with his wife, who are all married and living, and have many children [Bradford 445-46].\n\nBanks argued that Bradford’s language in the sentence above meant that Richard Warren had two wives, with the first of whom he had five daughters and with the second of whom, Elizabeth, he had two sons [English Homes 92-93], and deForest agreed with him [Moore Anc 562].\n\nMany attempts, all fruitless, have been made to discover the English origin of Richard Warren and the identity of his wife [MQ 51:109-12].\n\nRichard Warren was in the party that explored the outer cape in early December 1620; he was described as being of London [Mourt 32].\n\nOn 5 July 1635, Thomas Williams, servant of widow Warren, confessed that “there being some dissention between him and his dame, she, after other things, exhorted him to fear God & do his duty, he answered, he neither feared God, nor the devil” [PCR 1:35]. He was reproved and released [PCR 1:35].\n\nOn 5 January 1635/6 widow Warren paid 30s. to Thomas Clarke for borrowing his boat, and although returning it to a place of usual safety, an extraordinary storm wrecked it [PCR 1:36]. On 3 June 1639 “Mr. Andrew Hellot” was ordered to pay Mrs. Warren 10s. to settle an account between them [PCR 7:12].\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE: In 1938 L. Effingham deForest published a thorough study of Richard Warren [Moore Anc 561-70]. Robert S. Wakefield, Janice A. Beebe and others have prepared the Richard Warren volume in the General Society of Mayflower Descendants’ series of “pink books,” the fifth edition of which was published in 1995 [MFIP Warren].\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nResearch: “Warren, Richard: Came on “Mayflower” 1620, Plymouth. d March 1628.

But he had five daughters more come over with his wife, who are all married and living, and have many children.” The wife and 5 daughters came to Plymouth on the “Anne” in 1623.\n\nIn “Mourt’s Relation” under date of “sixt of December” it is stated “and three of london, Richard Warren, Steeven Hopkins and Edward Dotte…” This statement that he was from London is all we know about the origin of Richard Warren despite considerable research to learn more.\n\nThe 22 May 1627 Division of Cattle names Richard Warren, wife Elizabeth Warren, Nathaniell Warren, Joseph Warren, Mary Warren, Anna Warren, Sara Warren, Elizabeth Warren and Abigail Warren.\n\nIn a deed dated 28 Sept. 1629 the land which Thomas Clarke sold to William Bradford was bounded on one side by the land of “widow Warren.”.\n\nAt the 7 March 1636/7 court it was agreed that Elizabeth Warren, widow, the relict of Mr. Richard Warren, deceased, was to be a “Purchaser” as she had performed the bargain after he husband’s decease, and also for confirming the land formerly given by her to her son-in-law Richard Church, Robert Bartlett and Thomas Little in marriage with their wives, her daughters.\n\nIn a codicil to his will dated 16 July 1667 Nathaniel Warren mentions his mother Elizabeth Warreen, his brother Joseph Warren and his sisters Mary Bartlett Sr., Anna Little, Sarah Cooke, Elizabeth Church, and Abigail Snow.\n\nOn 4 March 1673/74 Mary Bartlett, the wife of Robert Bartlett, acknowledged she had received full satisfaction for her share of the estate of Mistris Elizabeth Warren, deceased; and John Cooke, in behalf of all here sisters testified to the same. The court settled the remainder of the estate on Joseph Warren.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nRichard & Elizabeth Warren in the records of the 17th century\n\nRichard Warren : Mayflower passenger\n\n“The names of those which came over first, in the year 1620, and were by the blessing of God the first beginners and in a sort the foundation of all the Plantations and Colonies in New England ; and their families …\n\n“Mr. Richard Warren, but his wife and children were left behind and came afterwards.”\n\nWilliam Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647, ed.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison (New York : Knopf, 1991), p. 441-3.\n\nIt is possible that Elizabeth Warren and her daughters were also part of the original group that meant to travel to America. William Bradford notes that, when the Speedwell was determined to be unseaworthy,\n\n“…it was resolved to dismiss her [the Speedwell] and part of the company, and proceed with the other ship [the Mayflower]. The which (though it was grievous and caused great discouragement) was put into execution. So after they had took out such provision as the other ship could well stow, and concluded both what number and what persons to send back, they made another sad parting; the one ship [the Speedwell] going back for London and the other [the Mayflower] was to proceed on her voyage. Those that went back were for the most part such as were willing so to do, either out of some discontent or fear they conceived of the ill success of the voyage, seeing so many crosses befall, and the year time so far spent. But others, in regard of their own weakness and charge of many young children were thought least useful and most unfit to bear the brunt of this hard adventure; unto which work of God, and judgment of their brethren, they were contented to submit.”\n\nWilliam Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647, ed.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison (New York : Knopf, 1991), p. 53.\n\nRichard Warren : Signer of the Mayflower Compact\n\n“I shall … begin with a combination made by them before they came ashore; being the first foundation of their government in this place. Occasioned partly by the discontented and mutinous speeches that some of the strangers amongst them had let fall from them in the ship: That when they came ashore they would use their own liberty, for none had power to command them, the patent they had being for Virginia and not for New England … And partly that such an act by them done, this their condition considered, might be as firm as any patent, and in some respects more sure.\n\n“The form was as followeth : IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. We whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, etc. Having undertaken, for the Glory of God and advancement of the Christian Faith and Honour of our King and Country, a Voyage to plant the First Colony in the Northern parts of Virginia, do by these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence of God and one of another, Covenant and Combine ourselves together into a Civil Body Politic, for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute and frame such just and equal Laws, Ordinances, Acts, Constitutions and Offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the Colony, unto which we promise all due submission and obedience. In witness whereof we have hereunder subscribed our names at Cape Cod, the 11th of November, in the year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord King James, of England, France and Ireland the eighteenth, and of Scotland the fifty-fourth. Anno Domini 1620.”\n\nWilliam Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647, ed.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison (New York : Knopf, 1991), p. 75-76.\n\nRichard Warren and the “First Encounter”\n\nThis story appears both in Mourt’s Relation, published in London in 1622, and (in a condensed version) in William Bradford’s Of Plymouth Plantation.\n\n“Wednesday, the sixth of December [1620]. It was resolved our discoverers should set forth … So ten of our men were appointed who were of themselves willing to undertake it, to wit, Captain Standish, Master Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winslow, John Tilley, Edward Tilley, John Howland, and three of London, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins, and Edward Doten, and two of our seamen, John Alderton, and Thomas English. Of the ship’s company there went two of the master’s mates, Master Clarke and Master Coppin, the master gunner, and three sailors …\n\nMourt’s Relation, ed. Jordan D. Fiore (Plymouth, Mass. :\n\nPlymouth Rock Foundation, 1985), p. 27-28.\n\n” … the 6th of December [1620] they sent out their shallop again with ten of their principal men and some seamen, upon further discovery, intending to circulate that deep bay of Cape Cod. The weather was very cold and it froze so hard as the spray of the sea lighting on their coats, they were as if they had been glazed. Yet that night betimes they got down into the bottom of the bay, and as they drew near the shore they saw some ten or twelve Indians very busy about something. They landed about a league or two from them … they made themselves a barricado with logs and boughs as well as they could in the time, and set out their sentinel and betook them to rest, and saw the smoke of the fire the savages made that night. When morning was come they divided their company, some to coast along the shore in the boat, and the rest marched through the woods to see the land, if any fit place might be for their dwelling. They came also to the place where they saw the Indians the night before, and found they had been cutting up a great fish like a grampus …\n\n“So they ranged up and down all that day, but found no people, nor any place they liked. When the sun grew low, they hasted out of the woods to meet with their shallop … of which they were very glad, for they had not seen each other all that day since the morning. So they made them a barricado as usually they did every night, with logs, stakes and thick pine boughs, the height of a man, leaving it open to leeward, partly to shelter them from the cold and wind (making their fire in the middle and lying round about it) and partly to defend them from any sudden assaults of the savages, if they should surround them; so being very weary, they betook them to rest. But about midnight they heard a hideous and great cry, and their sentinel called “Arm! arm!” So they bestirred them and stood to their arms and shot off a couple of muskets, and then the noise ceased. They concluded it was a company of wolves or such like wild beasts, for one of the seamen told them he had often heard such noise in Newfoundland.\n\n“So they rested till about five of the clock in the morning; for the tide, and their purpose to go from thence, made them be stirring betimes. So after prayer they prepared for breakfast, and it being day dawning it was thought best to be carrying things down to the boat …\n\n“But presently, all on the sudden, they heard a great and strange cry, which they knew to be the same voices they heard in the night, though they varied their notes; and one of their company being abroad came running in and cried, “Men, Indians! Indians!” And withal, their arrows came flying amongst them. Their men ran with all speed to recover their arms, as by the good providence of God they did. In the meantime, of those that were there ready, two muskets were discharged at them, and two more stood ready in the entrance of their rendezvous but were commanded not to shoot till they could take full aim at them. And the other two charged again with all speed, for there were only four had arms there, and defended the barricado, which was first assaulted. The cry of the Indians was dreadful, especially when they saw their men run out of the rendezvous toward the shallop to recover their arms, the Indians wheeling about upon them. But some running out with coats of mail on, and cutlasses in their hands, they soon got their arms and let fly amongst them and quickly stopped their violence …\n\n“Thus it pleased God to vanquish their enemies and give them deliverance; and by his special providence so to dispose that not any one of them were either hurt or hit, though their arrows came close by them and on every side [of] them; and sundry of their coats, which hung up in the barricado, were shot through and through. Afterwards they gave God solemn thanks and praise for their deliverance, and gathered up a bundle of their arrows and sent them into England afterward by the master of the ship, and called that place the FIRST ENCOUNTER.”\n\nWilliam Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647, ed.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison (New York : Knopf, 1991), p. 68-72.\n\nRichard Warren & the 1623 Division of Land\n\nThe 1623 Division of Land marked the end of the Pilgrims’ earlier system of land held in common by all. Governor Bradford explains it in this way: “And so assigned to every family a parcel of land, according to the proportion of their number, for that end, only for present use (but made no division for inheritance) and ranged all boys and youth under some family. This had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been by any means the Governor or any other could use, and saved him a great deal of trouble, and gave far better content. The women now went willingly into the field, and took their little ones with them to set corn; which before would allege weakness and inability; whom to have compelled would have been thought great tyranny and oppression.”\n\nWilliam Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647, ed.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison (New York : Knopf, 1991) p. 120\n\nPlymouth Colony Records, Deeds, &c Vol. I 1627-1651 is the oldest record book of the Plymouth settlement. It begins with the 1623 Division of Land, recorded in the handwriting of Governor William Bradford. The lands of Richard Warren were among those designated as “their grounds which came first over in the May Floure, according as thier lotes were case” and are described in this way “these lye one the north side of the towne next adjoyning to their gardens which came in the Fortune.”\n\nRichard Warren & the 1627 Division of Cattle\n\nPlymouth Colony Records, Deeds, &c, Vol. I 1627-1651 also tells of the 1627 Division of Cattle:\n\n“At a publique court held the 22th of May it was concluded by the whole Companie, that the cattell wch were the Companies, to wit, the Cowes & the Goates should be equally devided to all the psonts of the same company … & so the lotts fell as followeth, thirteene psonts being pportioned to one lot … ”\n\n“The ninth lot fell to Richard Warren & his companie Joyned with (2) him his wife Elizabeth Warren (3) Nathaniell Warren (4) Joseph Warren (5) Mary Warren (6) Anna Warren (7) Sara Warren (8) Elizabeth Warren (9) Abigall Warren (10) John Billington (11) George Sowle (12) Mary Sowle (13) Zakariah Sowle. To this lott fell one of the 4 black heyfers that came in the Jacob caled the smooth horned Heyfer and two shee goats.”\n\nRichard Warren : a 1626 Purchaser\n\nIn 1621, King James I authorized the Council for New England to plant and govern land in this area. This Council granted the Peirce Patent, confirming the Pilgrims’ settlement and governance of Plymouth. Peirce and his associates, the merchant adventurers, were allotted 100 acres for each settler the Company transported. The Pilgrims had a contract with the Company stating all land and profits would accrue to the Company for 7 years at which time the assets would be divided among the shareholders. Most of the Pilgrims held some stock. The Pilgrims negotiated a more favorable contract with the Company in 1626. In 1627, 53 Plymouth freemen, known as “The Purchasers,” agreed to buy out the Company over a period of years. In turn, 12 “Undertakers” (8 from Plymouth and 4 from London) agreed to pay off Plymouth’s debts in return for trade benefits.\n\nThe list we have of the 1626 Purchasers comes from the Plymouth Colony Records (Vol. 2, p. 177). Because of some discrepancies in the names, it is usually assumed that the list was compiled several years after the actual agreement was negotiated. The Plymouth Colony Records do not list Richard Warren; instead “Elizabeth Warren, widdow” is listed even though Richard Warren was still living in 1626/1627.\n\nRichard Warren : his death\n\n“And seeing it hath pleased Him to give me [William Bradford] to see thirty years completed since these beginnings, and that the great works of His providence are to be observed, I have thought it not unworthy my pains to take a view of the decreasings and increasings of these persons and such changes as hath passed over them and theirs in this thirty years …\n\n“Mr. Richard Warren lived some four or five years and had his wife come over to him, by whom he had two sons before [he] died, and one of them is married and hath two children. So his increase is four. But he had five daughters more came over with his wife, who are all married and living, and have many children.”\n\nWilliam Bradford, Of Plymouth Plantation 1620-1647, ed.\n\nSamuel Eliot Morison (New York : Knopf, 1991), p. 443-7.\n\n“1628.\n\n“This year died Mr. Richard Warren, who hath been mentioned before in this book, and was an useful instrument ; and during his life bore a deep share in the difficulties and troubles of the first settlement of the plantation of New Plimouth.”\n\nNathaniel Morton, New England’s Memorial\n\n(Boston : John Usher, 1669)\n\nRichard Warren’s burial site is unknown.\n\nElizabethWarren in the Records of Plymouth Colony\n\n1631 [a bequest in the will of Mary Ring] : “I give unto mrs Warren one woodden cupp with a foote as a token of my love.”\n\nMayflower Descendant, Vol. 1, p. 29-30.\n\n1633 : “a misted [meerstead] that was granted formerly to Richard Warren, deceased, & forfeited by a late order, for want of building, the said misted was granted to Mr. Raph Fog & his heires forever, provided the said Raph w’thin twelve moneths build a dwelling howse upon the same, & allow the widow Warren so much for her fence remayning thereon …”\n\nPlymouth Colony Records, Vol. 1, p. 18.\n\n1633 : “According to an order in Court held the 2d of January, in the seaventh yeare of the raigne of o’r soveraigne lord, Charles, by the grace of God King of Engl., Scotl., France, & Irel., defendr of the faith, &c, the psons heere under menconed were rated for publike use … to be brought in by each pson as they are heere under written, rated in corne at vi [pence] bushell … Widow Warren … 12 s[hilling]s.”\n\nPlymouth Colony Records, Vol. I, p. 9-10.\n\nIn 1634, she was also “rated” : “Widow Warren …. 9 [shillings].”\n\nPlymouth Colony Records, Vol. 1, p. 26-27.\n\n1633 [inventory] : “John.

BakerDirector & Librarian, Pilgrim Society & Pilgrim Hall Museum\n\n“A woman of valor, who can find? Far beyond pearls is her value… Give her the fruit of her hands, and she will be praised at the gates by her very own deeds.” Proverbs 31:10\n\nThe “Pilgrim Mothers” are mysteries. These intrepid women of 17th century Plymouth Colony are known by their husbands and known by their children. Their own lives, however, are seen only in glimpses, pale images reflected off the activities of the families which revolved around them. The women themselves are almost invisible.\n\nWhile the court records of Plymouth Colony reveal much about the daily activities of the law-abiding men of the Colony, they tell us little about the women (except for those few women who broke the law). There was, in fact, no officially recognized role for the law-abiding married woman. The activities and contributions of those women, although vital to the survival and success of the Colony, are nowhere registered or officially acknowledged.\n\nAccording to the accepted legal convention of the times, all married women, even those conducting business independently, were regarded as representatives of their husbands. Only widows could be legally recognized as agents in their own right. Very few widows availed themselves of the privileges and the responsibilities that such independent status would entail.\n\nOne Pilgrim woman, however, breaks through the patriarchal conventions of 17th century society. By the longevity of her widowhood and by the independence of her actions, Elizabeth Warren emerges from the collective category of “Pilgrim Mother” as a highly individual woman.\n\nElizabeth Warren appears full-grown on the shores of American history. Nothing is known of her English background, apart from her marriage to Richard Warren. Richard was one of the 102 passengers on the Mayflower, that sailed into Plymouth Harbor in December 1620.\n\nMany of the Mayflower passengers traveled as families. Some families, however, with many young children or other family responsibilities, or those thought (in Pilgrim William Bradford’s words) “most unfit to bear the brunt of this hard adventure,” separated. The men sailed in 1620 and the women and children delayed their sailing, planning on joining their menfolk after the Colony was established. Richard Warren was among the men who sailed alone in 1620.\n\nAccording to family tradition, Richard Warren brought with him on the Mayflower a particularly treasured (and very portable) family possession – a large linen damask napkin, woven in the Netherlands c.1600, now on display at Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nThe napkin’s woven design forms horizontal bands. One band shows a series of symbols – maces encircled by laurel branches and flanked by winged cherubs — representing the city of Amsterdam, with the words “Amster Dam” appearing beneath each symbol. Another band shows the city with houses, churches and canal bridges. The harbor below has rows of small boats with festive figures that appear to be dancing among barrels and boxes on the near shore.\n\nThe Warren family was separated for three years. One small ship, the Fortune, arrived in Plymouth in 1621 carrying a number of “lusty young men, and many of them wild enough” to supplement the fledgling Colony’s manpower. It was not until 1623 that two ships, the Anne and the Little James, arrived in Plymouth carrying 80-some new immigrants to Plymouth Colony, including members of the separated families. Among them were Fear and Patience Brewster, the daughters of Mayflower passengers William and Mary Brewster, as well as Samuel Fuller’s wife Bridget. Francis Cooke, who had voyaged on the Mayflower with his teenage son John, was joined by his wife, Hester, and their three younger children Jane, Jacob and Hester. Richard Warren was reunited by his wife Elizabeth and the five Warren daughters, Mary, Anna, Sarah, Elizabeth and Abigail.\n\nThe Warrens joined in the life of the small but growing agricultural community : Richard would have played a role in public affairs and worked the fields. Elizabeth would have run the large household that included not only the immediate family but also their farm workers and hired help. On occasion, she would have joined Richard in the fields. The Warren home would have been small and modestly furnished.\n\nVery little furniture survives from the early years of Plymouth Colony. Most pieces were simple and sturdy, suited to life in a frontier community. The Warren “joint stool,” so-named for its joined mortise-and-tenon construction, would have been used both as seating furniture and as a table. The Warren stool is now in the collections of Pilgrim Hall Museum.\n\nTwo sons were born to the Warrens after Elizabeth’s 1623 arrival in Plymouth Colony. Their birth dates are not recorded but evidence of their presence can be found in the “1627 Division of Cattle.”\n\nIn 1627, the Colony’s livestock, formerly held in common, was divided among the Colony’s residents. Every person living in Plymouth in 1627 was assigned to a “Lot,” generally arranged by family group, and the name of every resident was individually recorded in Plymouth Colony Records Volume I. Listed there we find not only Richard and Elizabeth and their five daughters, but also the names of their two young sons, Nathaniel and Joseph Warren.\n\nRichard Warren died in 1628. Elizabeth, left a widow with 7 children (five young women, ranging from early teens to probably early twenties, and two small boys under the age of 5), never remarried. Elizabeth outlived her husband Richard by 45 years.\n\nUnlike the majority of Plymouth Colony women, Elizabeth Warren’s name appears regularly in the records of Plymouth Colony during the long period of her widowhood. She appears first as paying the taxes owed by all heads of household. She appears next as executor of her husband’s estate.\n\nElizabeth then appears as one of the Plymouth Colony “Purchasers.” In 1626, 53 (male) citizens of Plymouth Colony agreed to underwrite some of the Colony’s debt in a complicated arrangement with its financial backers. Richard Warren was one of the original 1626 Purchasers. The list of the names of the Purchasers did not appear in the Plymouth Colony Records, however, until several years had passed. During that time, Richard Warren had died. In a startling break with tradition, the list of Purchasers does not contain the name of Richard Warren but, instead, “Elizabeth Warren, widow.” The Court felt it necessary to explain this unprecedented move, noting that Elizabeth was listed in Richard’s stead because Richard, “dying before he had performed the bargain, the said Elizabeth performed the same after his decease.”\n\nIn 1635, Elizabeth Warren appears in the Records of Plymouth Colony in a totally new role. No longer seen as acting to fulfill the obligations of her long-deceased husband Richard, Elizabeth now enters the recorded life of the Colony as a totally independent agent. We have not only a court case involving Elizabeth, we hear an echo of her actual words.\n\nElizabeth brought her servant Thomas Williams before the Court for “speaking profane & blasphemous speeches against the majesty of God.” In a disagreement between mistress and servant, Elizabeth Warren had exhorted Thomas Williams “to fear God and do his duty. He answered, he neither feared God, nor the devil.” Although Governor William Bradford advocated “bodily punishment,” the judgment of the Court was that a reproof was sufficient, Williams having “spoken in passion and distemper,” and making “humble acknowledgment of his offense.”\n\nElizabeth’s activities continue to be documented to an unusual extent in theRecords of Plymouth Colony. In the late 1630s, she appears in the Records deeding land from the Warren holdings in Plymouth’s Eel River Valley to her sons-in-law.\n\nThe Warren daughters had matured and married: Mary to Anne passenger Robert Bartlett, Anna to Thomas Little, Sarah to Mayflower passenger John Cooke, Elizabeth to Richard Church and Abigail to Anthony Snow. Relations within the large extended family seemed amicable.\n\nIn 1652, however, trouble suddenly loomed! Elizabeth’s deeds to her sons-in-law, deeds that had been executed 15 years previously, were challenged by persons unnamed. The Plymouth Colony Records report a petition brought by Elizabeth’s son-in-law Robert Bartlett asking for clarification of Elizabeth’s right to deed land because “sundry speeches have passed from some who pretend themselves to be the sole and right heirs unto the lands on which the said Robert Bartlett now liveth, at the Eel River, in the township of Plymouth, which he, the said Robert, had bestowed on him by his mother-in-law Mistress Elizabeth Warren.”\n\nThe Court decided, unequivocally, in Elizabeth’s favor, finding that she had the power to give the land, since she had been “by an order of Court bearing date March the 7th, 1637, and other acts of the Court before, invested into the state and condition of a Purchaser.”The Court once again ratified and confirmed her status as a Purchaser and specifically ruled that Elizabeth Warren had the right to dispose of her lands, including the gifts of land she had made to her sons-in-law.\n\nEven this clear-cut Court ruling was insufficient to settle the quarrel. And as the dispute continued, the identity of those “who pretend themselves to be the sole and right heirs” was revealed to be Elizabeth’s own son Nathaniel Warren and his grandmother-in-law Jane Collier.\n\nNathaniel, now married and in his mid-to-late 20s, claimed that he “hath right unto as heir unto the lands of Mr. Richard Warren, deceased.” The two sides in the quarrel agreed to submit the argument to arbitration, each choosing 2 members to sit on the 4-man arbitration panel. Elizabeth Warren chose William Bradford and Thomas Willett. Nathaniel Warren chose Thomas Prence and Myles Standish.\n\nThe arbitration panel came swiftly to its unanimous conclusion. Nathaniel Warren received an acknowledgment of his right to share in the Warren lands. The panel confirmed what had never seemed to be in doubt, namely that Nathaniel could continue to hold the land he currently possessed. Nathaniel was also granted 2/3 of the Warren “Purchase Lands” which had not as yet been assigned and possession, after Elizabeth’s death, of 3 acres of land near his current holdings.\n\nThe major finding of the arbitration panel, however, must have come as a severe shock to young Nathaniel! The expected outcome by law and by custom would certainly have favored Elizabeth’s son. But, far from vindicating his patriarchal claims, the panel issued a stunning and resounding confirmation of Elizabeth’s status as head of her household and of her authority to act as an independent agent. The panel not only found that she “shall enjoy all the rest of her lands and all of them to whom she hath already at any time heretofore disposed any part thereof by gift, sale or otherwise, or shall hereafter do the same, to them and their heirs for ever without any trouble or molestation” but severely rapped Nathaniel’s unfilial knuckles.\n\nThe Court concluded by bidding Nathaniel to\n\nforever cease all other or further claims, suits, questions, or any molestations or disturbance at any time hereafter concerning the premises, but that his said mother and all her children, or any other to whom she has any way disposed any lands or shall hereafter do the same, but that they may quietly and peaceably possess and enjoy the same.\n\nElizabeth Warren seems, indeed, to have quietly and peaceably enjoyed the remainder of her days. When she died in 1673, this remarkable woman received the unprecedented but well-earned tribute of a eulogy in the Records of Plymouth Colony\n\nMistress Elizabeth Warren, an aged widow, aged above 90 years, deceased on the second of October, 1673.

Hunt suggested that Robert Bartlett of Plymouth was the same as a Robert Bartlett baptized at Puddletown, Dorsetshire, on 27 May 1603, and twenty years later Paul Prindle published a fuller pedigree of this Dorsetshire family, but at the moment this proposed identification remains only a possibility [TAG 35:214, 55:164-70]. Robert of Puddletown had brother Benjamin and sisters Mary, Lydia and Elizabeth, all names used by Robert of Plymouth.\n\nClues as to the ages of the children of Robert Bartlett are sparse, and several attempts have been made to determine the birth order of the children. Aside from the evidence of birth dates for the last two children, the date of freemanship for son Benjamin and the age at death for son Joseph, our most useful information comes from the marriage dates for the older daughters. The statement has frequently been made that Benjamin must have been born by 6 June 1633, since he was made free on 6 June 1654 [PCR 3:48]. But he had by 4 April 1654 already married and buried one wife, and was soon to marry a second, which suggests a man a few years older than twenty-one in that year. If we place the birth of Benjamin in 1629, then we have a gap of about six or seven years in which to place daughters Rebecca and Mary (1629-1636), but to do this we must assume that they both married when they were about eighteen, rather than rely on our usual rule of marrying daughters at age twenty in the absence of other evidence. There would be nothing unusual about this, and the resulting sequence of births for the elder children is in agreement with the evidence. Note also that under almost any interpretation there is a gap of about six years between the births of the sixth and seventh children of this couple.\n\nOn 25 December 1635 Robert Bartlett took Richard Stinnings as an apprentice for nine years, his time to begin on 1 December 1635 [PCR 1:35]. On 4 August 1638, for œ6 10s. and twenty bushels of Indian corn, John Barnes assigned to Robert Bartlett the remaining term of service of Thomas Shreive (being three years from the first day of August instant), Robert Bartlett also paying Shreive œ3 6s. 8d., and Shreive agreeing to serve an additional year for another œ5 [PCR 12:32].\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE: The most complete treatment of Robert Bartlett and his family may be found in George E. Bowman’s account of the descendants of RICHARD WARREN in MD 3:105-17. This article includes abstracts of all records relating to Robert Bartlett and complete transcripts of the probate documents and some critical deeds, and is only slightly marred by a misguided effort to represent dates in both Old Style and New Style. A shorter but also excellent account may be found in Moore Anc 60-72. Paul W. Prindle included a solid version of the family in his limited edition Ancestors and Descendants of Timothy Crosby Jr. (Orleans, Mass., 1981), 2:342-50.
