        "text": "The tide rises, the tide falls,\n\nThe twilight darkens, the curlew calls;\n\nAlong the sea-sands damp and brown\n\nThe traveller hastens toward the town,\n\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\n\nDarkness settles on roofs and walls,\n\nBut the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;\n\nThe little waves, with their soft, white hands,\n\nEfface the footprints in the sands,\n\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\n\nThe morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls\n\nStamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;\n\nThe day returns, but nevermore\n\nReturns the traveller to the shore,\n\nAnd the tide rises, the tide falls.\n\n—\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–1882) was an American poet and educator whose works include Paul Revere’s Ride, The Song of Hiawatha, and Evangeline. He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy.\n\nLongfellow was born in Portland, Maine, which was then a part of Massachusetts. He studied at Bowdoin College. After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night (1839) and Ballads and Other Poems (1841). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to focus on his writing, living the remainder of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts in a former Revolutionary War headquarters of George Washington. His first wife Mary Potter died in 1835, after a miscarriage. His second wife Frances Appleton died in 1861, after sustaining burns when her dress caught fire. After her death, Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time and focused on translating works from foreign languages. He died in 1882.\n\nLongfellow was the most popular American poet of his day. In recent years, he has fallen out of favor, but his poems are still enjoyable to read for their musicality and their unapologetic renderings of traditional American themes.\n\n.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow in 1868"
