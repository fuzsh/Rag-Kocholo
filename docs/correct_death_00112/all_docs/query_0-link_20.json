Caroline Augusta was buried at Grave #18 on January 21, 1909.\n\nArticle from the \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" Monday, November 17, 1873:\n\nRUNAWAYS.--On Friday evening of last week, a runaway occurred at the Asylum grounds, which, though it might have resulted fatally, fortunately was only confined to laying up for a day or so Mr. Colby, of Cox & Colby, the Asylum brick contractors. Mr Colby was standing behind the driver of a two-horse wagon loaded with doors and window frames, and a Spaniard, passing the team, his horse on a dead run, scared the horses. The driver jerked the lines severely, and the horses lunging forward, threw him off the wagon onto the double-trees. Mr Colby managed to get hold of the lines, when the wheels ran into a ditch, and a portion of the load slid off, taking Mr Colby with it; not, however, before the driver had regained his position and caught the lines from Mr Colby's hands. Mr Colby was thrown on his head, which was severely contused, and the wagon, still rather heavily loaded, passed over his thigh. Fortunately no bones were broken and a stiffening of the sinews is all that he has had to suffer from, and he is now nearly recovered from the effects of an accident that, to a less fleshly man, might have been attended with a compound fracture of the thigh. The driver managed to stop the team soon after he recovered his place on the wagon.\n\nParents: Jonathan COLBY and Sally RING.\n\nSpouse: Caroline Augusta PLUMMER. Benjamin F.
