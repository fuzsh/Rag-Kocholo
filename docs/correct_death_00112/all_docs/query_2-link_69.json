        "text": "Editor's note: Two years ago, then-Daily News reporter Jeannette Hinkle met with Steve Pickford, innkeeper at Longfellow's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, and paranormal investigator Laura Anno to discuss whether former innkeeper Jerusha Howe might still be haunting the inn. As Halloween approaches, we bring this story back again for you.\n\nIn this special Halloween episode of our podcast, the Daily News, we take you on a spooky tour of Sudbury’s Wayside Inn. We ask the Wayside’s 11th innkeeper in 300 years and a paranormal investigator about former hostess Jerusha Howe, and find out why she might still be haunting the inn.\n\nMUSIC: Copenhagen Waltz\n\nMore: Beware of tricks while seeking treats: Crime data shows spike in Halloween vandalism\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nOne autumn night in Sudbury town,\n\nAcross the meadows bare and brown,\n\nThe windows of the Wayside Inn\n\nGleamed red with firelight through the leaves\n\nOf woodbine, hanging from the eaves\n\nTheir crimson curtains rent and thin.\n\nRound this old fashioned quaint abode\n\nDeep silence reigned, save when a gust\n\nWent rushing down the country road\n\nAnd skeletons of leaves and dust\n\nA moment quickened by its breath\n\nShuddered and danced their dance of death,\n\nAnd through the ancient oaks overhead\n\nMysterious voices moaned and fled.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow got the Wayside Inn right in his famous collection of poems, \"Tales Of A Wayside Inn.\"\n\nIt’s a real inn, which I didn’t know. Longfellow visited in the 1860s after his publisher suggested he needed some time away. Longfellow’s wife had died in a fire. The publisher thought a trip to the country would break his tragedy-induced writer’s block. The suggestion worked. His collection of stories about the people he met at the Wayside Inn became a best-seller.\n\nThe inn is set in the woods of Sudbury down a long winding road. When I visited last week, the air was just starting to get that frosty bite. The trees were brilliant shades of red and orange and yellow. The only sound was leaves in the wind.\n\nIt was beautiful in an eerie way. But I could have been biased. I was there to ask about a ghost.\n\nMore: Wayside Inn Foundation announces Hild as first director\n\nINTRO MUSIC\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nI’m Jeannette Hinkle, and this is the Daily News, an occasional podcast where we take a look at stories we’re working on in the newsroom. Today, we’re bringing you a special Halloween episode.\n\nFor those who haven’t been to the Wayside Inn, it’s a red clapboard colonial-style house. It’s in a pasture surrounded by woods. But the property includes more than the inn. There’s an old grist mill where they still make flour. There’s an old red schoolhouse. There’s a chapel.\n\nLaura Anno is a Boston area paranormal investigator, and the Wayside Inn property is basically her favorite place in the world.\n\nANNO:\n\nThe Wayside Inn, when you walk the grounds, as I’m sure you have, it’s like sometimes it’s like a moment caught in time. To me, it’s overwhelming. I just love it. If there was ever a cemetery at the Wayside Inn, I’d be first in line to have my ashes buried there. I love the place and combining the history, combining the peace and the nature and then into the paranormal investigation type stuff. It’s like a dream come true. It’s like the perfect storm.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe inn was warm and cheery when I visited. Multiple fireplaces were blazing. The ceilings there are low and wooden and there’s these old portraits on the walls. And hanging on one door in the back is a sign reading innkeeper.\n\nSteve Pickford is the innkeeper.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nEleventh innkeeper in 300 years.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nI asked Steve what an innkeeper does in 2019. Short answer: a lot.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nA big part of our business is the restaurant. However, we have 110 acres and nine historic buildings so I can come in on any given day and there might be a valve broken at the dam. There might be a gear needs fixing or repair at the grist mill. I might be helping to stock the trout pond. I might be manicuring some of the property. So it’s a little bit of everything and it’s complicated but you know, any given day anything could happen.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nBefore I get to the ghost of the Wayside Inn, you need to know some of the history of the place, before Longfellow. The inn opened in 1716.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nThe road out in front of the inn was the Boston Post Road and people traveled from Boston to New York City on that road. David How, he transformed his two-room house into a four-room inn, and he got the house of entertainment license at the time. And for 150 years, four generations of How operated as How’s Tavern.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nTell us your favorite local urban legends and spooky stories\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nEventually, Lyman How took over the inn. Lyman wasn’t that great at innkeeping and fewer people were traveling on Boston Post Road. Lyman started drinking a lot. The inn started to lose money. A lot of the people who still went to the inn went to see Lyman’s sister.\n\nHer name was Jerusha. She was the hostess of the inn. Outgoing. Very attentive to people.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThere are no portraits of Jerusha, but people said she was beautiful. She was tall and thin and well educated. She was a good cook. She could sing. Most importantly, though, she could play the piano.\n\nMUSIC: Battle of Prague\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nShe had the first piano in Sudbury. No one knew what a piano was, so people used to flock here to hear her play, like ‘What the hell’s a piano?’ And you know they’d see it, hear it and like it.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThis is one song Jerusha was known to play. It’s called the \"Battle of Prague.\"\n\nMUSIC: Battle of Prague\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nJerusha was called the Belle of Sudbury. Lots of men in town wanted to court her, but she wanted nothing to do with them.\n\nANNO:\n\nShe kind of was so proud of her English lineage that she kind of saw the guys in the area as kind of country bumpkins and farmers and not good enough for her.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nBut then an Englishman came to the inn. Not much is known about him, except that he was the only man to ever win Jerusha’s heart.\n\nANNO:\n\nThey fancied each other so much and he’d said, \"That’s it. You’re the one for me. I’m going to go to England, come on back and we’re going to start a family together, get married.\" And she never heard from him again, as that story that you’ve heard so many times goes.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nHe went off to get his affairs in order in England and no one ever heard from him again. So she kind of died a lady in waiting.\n\nANNO:\n\nAnd rumor has it, if it’s true, that she pined away for him, never heard back from him, and eventually died young of a broken heart, 44 years old.\n\nMUSIC: Battle of Prague\n\nANNO:\n\nThere might be legitimacy to the story for two reasons. One is because Lyman’s best friend was the postmaster, and it’s said that the postmaster is the one that tells the tale of Jerusha dying of a broken heart from a guy that she met in England waiting for and never returned. And the second reason is because she kept a well detailed diary and there were two entries that were fairly short on words, let’s just say.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe first entry that Laura is talking about says, “A first introduction.” Then, a few years later, another short entry read, “Rid of that trouble.”\n\nMore: 4 local cryptids you may run into around New England\n\nANNO:\n\nI bet you the introduction was with this gentleman. And then she finally just, kind of in written form anyway, said rid of that trouble. That’s what I think, because these two statements stand out in that diary blatantly as different than all her other entries. And interestingly, at some point she started quoting other writers’ really depressing poems and things. It sounds like she kind of went into a funk. One can only surmise that the story is true. But of course, there’s no proof.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nIf the stories are true, Jerusha is still waiting for that mysterious Englishman to return.\n\nWhen Jerusha was alive, she lived in Room 9 of the inn. Across a creaky wooden staircase was Room 10, and that’s where she did her sewing.\n\nOver the course of decades, guests of those rooms have reported strange happenings. Some have heard a woman crying. Some have seen the water faucets turn on by themselves. Others have smelled citrus, said to be the same scent of Jerusha’s perfume.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nSome people have some incredible stories, other people don’t. But it’s the talk of the town every morning when whoever stays in Room 9, in the morning everybody always asks, Did anything happen? Did you see anything, hear anything? But some weird stuff has happened. There is some strange stuff that I’ve heard.\n\nMore: Six Horror Films Set in New England for your Halloween Movie Marathon\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nSeveral potentially haunted happenings in Jerusha’s rooms are recorded in notes left by guests on scraps of paper tucked in the old building’s nooks and crannies. The tradition is called “The Secret Drawer Society.”\n\nANNO:\n\nIn the late 50s, there was the innkeeper, then Frances, I think it’s Koppet, and he started hiding candy for children in these little secret antique drawers and desks and stuff through the inn. And the kids were loving, running around, you know, grabbing these. And soon the adults started to do it. People begin writing little notes and crumpling up and stick em in these places are under rugs or behind drawers.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThe notes are still hidden around the inn, and when new guests visit, they add notes of their own.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nThis was her bedroom and her sewing room. Somebody is cleaning it so it’s already open.\n\nSo this is Room 9. So this was her room way back when. Like if you look up here. These are all the notes that people stick everywhere, so I mean it could be from last weekend or it could be from a long time ago. You know. Hope you enjoy your stay here in Room 9, some of the letters you read are pretty cool. We’ll be back. We made it through the night. Justin and I came to celebrate his birthday weekend. Bah bah bah bah bah.\n\nANNO:\n\nWhen you sit and read some of these notes, they’re anything from, \"I just got married to the love of my life, we’re on our one year anniversary,\" or, \"Oh, my husband used to take me here and he passed away 20 years ago, this place is still special to me.\" And you find yourself crying reading these notes and laughing reading these notes. But some of the notes — and when I say some, I mean consistently 6% of the notes — make mention of paranormal occurrences, at least as thought by the folks writing the notes. And I think I am safe to say that I’m the only person on the planet who has read as many notes as were available to read. And I think I’m hovering at around 3,700 notes at this point, and about 250 of them have paranormal experiences detailed in these notes.\n\nREPORTER:\n\nWhat would you say is the weirdest account that you’ve heard from a guest of Room 9 or 10.\n\nPICKFORD:\n\nProbably having her climb in bed with them.\n\nMore: 5 ‘Haunted’ New England Roads for Your Ghost Hunting Road Trip (with map)\n\nCOHEN:\n\nMy name is Marvin Cohen. I’m the lead bartender here at the Wayside Inn. I’ve heard many stories from customers on things like smelling her orange-scented perfume. Staying in guest rooms and seeing windows move, the shades and the curtains without any wind being outside, hearing things in the corridors knowing that the only person around is a night watchman who was not near them. One person told me he actually felt like he received a backrub while his wife was in the bathroom.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nLaura thinks the citrus scent is caused by cleaning products, not the echo of Jerusha across time. But she and other paranormal investigators have found some weird things they can’t explain.\n\nOne of those incidents was caught on camera by Laura’s friend.\n\nANNO:\n\nSomehow, when he was rewinding and watching his tape play, I think it was around 3 or 3:30 in the morning, you could see, clear as day, this black misty thing come up out of the floor to the right of the bed and kind of arc over the bed over him and then go into the wall behind the bed. And it happened again a few minutes later. We all ran down to the Wayside Inn and we set up cameras and we went outside with our cars. And we were trying to turn our cars on and off and our headlights and and move the curtains and do all kinds of things to try to replicate. And nothing would replicate it.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nAnother investigator recorded ghostly piano music.\n\nANNO:\n\nHe was sound asleep. His tape recorder was playing and he woke up to the sound of a piano playing. It was faint, but not so faint that it didn’t wake him up. He couldn’t name that tune, so to speak, but he jumped up and he started, you know, exited the door, started going down the stairs and the noise started getting fainter. He ran back up the stairs again. And as he started to approach the room, he started, he could hear it again till he got the room. And it was at its loudest when he was in the room. And he was excited because he knew he was catching it on tape. And he took that tape and ran it through the software program. He could see the the sound. He could hear the sound. He identified the notes. And then through our research of hearing the five songs that drew she’s most known for playing, one of them was \"Battle of the Prague.\" And we found a YouTube recording of that. And he was able to match it to the notes that were being played that he recorded.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nFor Laura, the patterns in the Secret Drawer Society notes, combined with the evidence collected by paranormal investigators, suggest there is something strange going on at the Wayside Inn.\n\nANNO:\n\nIt’s very curious and only adds to what you hear about the Wayside Inn. Nobody can hang their hat and say, this is Jerusha crying because of that guy from England. Nobody knows who the woman is crying. They only know that it’s a woman. It would be my guess it’s Jerusha. I can’t prove it, but it sure does seem like a lot of facts or theories are coming together in one pattern.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nSo if you’re interested in taking a trip to the country, if you’re looking to get away and meet some interesting characters, dead or alive, Laura suggests going to the Wayside Inn.\n\nANNO:\n\nBook ahead. I can tell you that, you know, I think that the Wayside Inn appeals to everyone. There’s great food, there’s great drinks. There’s great people. It’s a great place to stay. There’s history. There’s just so much going on. I love it. But boy, if you’re just into ghosts and anything paranormal, it is by far the most active hot spot, because I’ve been all around New England and I’ve had some interesting experiences here and there. But boy, you want to talk about more consistency and just holy cow moments. That would be the Wayside Inn and especially in autumn. It’s particularly spooky. And if you’re fortunate enough to get a room there in October, you know, you just might want to be quiet. And if you have a tape recorder, bring it. Put the vibe out there and see if you experience anything, if you hear anything, if you see anything. I think you, no matter what, wouldn’t be disappointed if you were to go there. And, and if something does happen or you do see or catch anything on on film or on tape or something, get a hold of me. I want to know about it.\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nThanks for listening to this special Halloween episode of the Daily News.
