In our age of the ever colder, ever more oxymoronic, educational institution, I count myself extremely lucky to have such warm, wise, and ‘agitating’ colleagues–friends in American and Canadian Studies at Birmingham. In particular, Danielle Fuller, a model academic, has steered me back on track at crucial moments and reminds me, as the rest of our small team does, of why we bother. I owe a debt of thanks to the, by now, hundreds of students who have taken my Death and the Moving Image class since I first started teaching it in 1998. At Brunel University and then at Birmingham, they have consistently enriched my thoughts on the subject. I’d especially like to acknowledge John Horne, who has been the model postgraduate student of recent years, and to thank him for providing countless additional resources for this project. My work on this book has benefited enormously from the careful and generous feedback I have received from such astute readers as Anat Pick, Ulele Burnham, Sara Wood and Monica Pearl. A special thanks goes to the last for her generous scrutiny of the entire typescript as well as her enduring friendship. Thanks are due, too, to the research seminar audiences at King’s College London and Keele University with whom I first tried out some of these ideas. My life has benefited enormously from the friendship and irreverence of my Birmingham crew, in particular Steve Hewitt, Jules Wright and Lindsey Myers, as well as from the enduring love and support of my parents and ‘older’ friends and colleagues. This was not an easy book to write. Dwelling with death for too many years, however academically, is arduous and especially so to those who have had to put up with it and me during this time. My sharpest appreciation and love go to Vita and Ulele who have borne the brunt. For Vita, who has always exuded, and never just in name, this project’s essential counterweight, I am eternally and humbly thankful. To Ulele, my provocatrice, and to whom this book is intellectually indebted, I send this swell of gratefulness. Death and the Moving Image has evolved since I started\n\n­\n\na c kno wle dge me nt s ix writing it, and changed course as I have. In the end, its waning cynicism is, I hope, where the next one will start.

Corpses litter Hollywood film; vulnerability or violence propels most mainstream fictions; the recently recovered or slowly dying make bookshelves groan. But the pain or smell of death, the banality of physical, or undignified, decline, the dull ache of mourning, are rarely seen. Cemeteries move further from the city, approach obsolescence as well as capacity, and hospitals hold dying at bay and far from the public eye. Yet our film and television screens are steeped in death’s dramatics: in spectacles of glorious sacrifice or bloody retribution, in the ecstasy of agony, but always in the promise of redemption. This book is about these dramatics or, more precisely, the staging of these dramatics in mainstream film, and the discrepancies that fuel them and are, by return, fuelled by them. The foregrounding of discrepancy, of the gaps or inaccuracies that characterise death’s mediation in its restless departure from lived experience, has always accompanied its sociocultural study. Since Ernest Becker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning bestseller of 1973 announced The Denial of Death – that the human condition is characterised by a fear of death which funds our actions but evades our consciousness – debates on the topic have negotiated this question of repression and of death’s faux nowhere-ness in contemporary life.1 Philippe Ariès provided the historical context to this death denial in his groundbreaking study of 1975: Western Attitudes towards Death: From the Middle Ages to the Present.2 In it he traced death’s social role from medieval to modern times: its long and slow journey from being familiar to becoming forbidden. Until the eighteenth century, death was an everyday event: an individual would die at home, surrounded by a steady stream of family, neighbours and children. With modernity, industrialisation and secularisation, things changed: death became an increasingly private or domestic enterprise and more about the loved ones looking on than the dearly departing themselves. Death shifted, in other words, from its function as public but banal ritual, to the intense, private,\n\n2\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nand even expressive performances of mourning in Victorian times, and then again to the conventions of ‘acceptability’, constraint, and solemnity, attending death in the subsequent period and since.3 Such conventions segregate the dying into hospitals, regulate the excesses of grief but still redirect attention away from the body in decline or exanimation: ‘Death, so omnipresent in the past . . . would be effaced, would disappear. It would become shameful and forbidden’.4 The manifestations of this interdiction would take somewhat different forms in different centuries and in different countries in the West but its modern entrenchment as taboo was universal. This is a grand simplification of Ariès’s historical cartography: its details are debated with erudition elsewhere but its prevailing themes, such as the romanticisation of death or its conservatism, will be addressed and updated throughout this study.5 What the summary reveals, however, are several important, and enduring, displacements going on within death and mourning practices in modern times and within the entrenchment of taboo. These displacements hold particular significance for any study of modern culture but especially so for mainstream cinema which trades more than most on the diversionary promises of lavish fantasy. Freud’s remark on attitudes towards death that we ‘seek in the world of fiction, in literature and in the theatre compensation for what has been lost in life’, achieves its most vivid realisation in this medium.6 When Ariès connects responsibility for death’s interdiction to an emphasis upon the preservation of ‘happiness, born in the United States around the beginning of the twentieth century’,7 we gain a clear mandate for the significance to this project of the Dream Factory, of the Hollywood system, which was consolidating socially and industrially at just this time, and its part in promoting the ‘American/ised’ way of life and way of death that preoccupy us here. Journeying ever further from the truths of the body in decline, Ariès’s historical displacements in the cultural role of death can be broadly conjured thus: from the public to the private; from the person dying to the person mourning; from the everyday to the extraordinary; and from ritualistic to romanticised remonstration or self-restraint. These new emphases, upon what can be usefully encapsulated as the exceptionalism of death, will prove to be very important to its cinematic treatment, and to my analysis. At their heart, for Ariès, was a certain denial, though he didn’t call it that. Whether it was eroticised, sensationalised or simply unmentionable, death from eighteenth-century Western culture onwards was increasingly cordoned off from the natural and healthy functioning of society. In this book, I pursue the bifurcated or ambivalent place of death\n\n­\n\nin troduc t io n: e ve r ywhe re a n d n o wh e r e 3\n\nin twentieth- and twenty-first-century culture: the ongoing split between its over- and understatement, between its cold, bodily realities and its fantastical, transcendental and, most importantly, strategic representation.8 Its cultural expression will be shown still to support the natural and healthy functioning of society but this sense of well-being is, I have found, highly contingent upon social factors that far exceed a universal fear of death. Popular culture, specifically mainstream cinema, will prove the privileged site for scrutinising such strategies’ nurture of the welfare of ‘Western society’. For Geoffrey Gorer, an early voice in the study of death and dying and to whom Ariès pays tribute, the twentieth-century interdiction must be understood in terms of a specific historical displacement, and one that also renders a universal death fear an inadequate explanation. His seminal article of 1955, ‘The Pornography of Death’, argued that in its taboo and titillating status – as forbidden-but-with-frisson – it held the same role that sex did in Victorian times.9 Death became the new obscenity, to be sequestered and repressed but also, tangentially, indulged, at least in those tawdry spaces that afforded it. A split occurred. Medical developments and the progressive control over the wages of the body caused a separating out of natural and unnatural death in society: ‘While natural death became more and more smothered in prudery, violent death has played an ever growing part in the fantasies offered to mass audiences’.10 This is where mediated death and cultural artefacts gain such prominence within the debate. Repressed in real life, death returns and returns extravagantly in representation. This split, and developing gulf, between sanitised natural and spectacular unnatural death will prove apposite, and even telling, in filmic translation. Not only will cinema’s dramatic display of death contrast with its inconspicuousness in real life but both natural and unnatural death migrate to the screen, albeit in different proportions. Crucially, however, this book will demonstrate that the ‘fantasies offered to mass audiences’ by cinema depend just as much, if not more, upon the niceties of natural death as the blood fests of its special events. Death’s critical importance here will hinge upon its salubrious, rather than lurid, spectacles. Prudery proves the most revealing still. Since its inception, cinema has provided an ever more dominating forum for society’s depiction of, and dealings with, death. It provides a rare site for representations of illness or grief, of wounded bodies or souls, or of the fringes of life. It is prolific in imaging death by stupefying risk, tragic misadventure or unpalatable crime. This pervasive staging of violent death proves not only gratuitous, or the flipside of repression, but psychologically strategic as Becker might have it: it serves our a­ voidance\n\n4\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nof mortality, distancing death from the self. Becker drew on the work of Otto Rank who put it thus: ‘through the death of the other, one buys oneself free from the penalty of dying, of being killed’.11 In crude terms, others suffer instead of us: the more we watch the death of others, the more we master it and are reassured of our own survival. For Alfred Killilea the aesthetic dimension of what we’re watching is vital: the more violent or graphic the representation of murder, the more clearly Western culture seeks to avoid the subject of death: ‘We continue to hide from the reality of our natural and unavoidable mortality’, he says, ‘by exposing ourselves to the more bizarre and violent manifestations of death’.12 More than just an ‘instinct to mastery’,13 or channelling of the ‘death drive’ in Freudian terms, we become inured to the place of death in our lives, hardened to it, precisely through the graphic visualisations of death and dying. And the more fantastical or discrepant such representations are, the stronger the guarantee of our distance from them. The individual might test and strengthen the death drive through these encounters with mortality, then, and culture, especially cinema, might offer a compelling platform for occasioning such thrills but psychoanalysis is insufficient to explain death’s rich role on-screen. Instead, what is emphasised here is the aesthetic and psychosocial – the compulsory interchange between psychic and social factors – import of these representations and, crucially, their codependence. Mainstream cinema abounds with such bizarre and violent manifestations, and numerous studies of action, thriller, gangster and horror films have pointed us to both their entertainment and ideological values.14 Pleasure in, indeed especially in, fear or suspense is pivotal here: mainstream cinema, lest we forget, is above all else an entertainment industry. Similarly, as Joel Black reminds us, ‘[o]ur customary experience of murder and other forms of violence is primarily aesthetic, rather than moral, physical, natural, or whatever term we choose as a synonym for the word real’.15 Though this study dwells on sombre topics and ethical suppositions, it is underwritten by the visual and visceral allure, or downright delight, these depictions promise their vast audiences. Death and the Moving Image, however, is not explicitly about murder or violence, monsters or villains, or such films’ sensational depictions of ever less natural death. Instead, innocuous or poignant representations, the seemingly more seemly fantasies about mortality, take centre stage. These, I argue, are far more potent as indicators of the distancing devices that surround death’s place in mainstream cinema and of the wider cultural needs such devices serve or betray. These distancing devices are about our fear not only of death but of our implication in others’ deaths. Indeed, the discrep-\n\n­\n\nin troduc t io n: e ve r ywhe re a n d n o wh e r e 5\n\nant depiction of mortality, I argue, stems from a set of other fears, cares or unconscious attitudes that are met and satisfied by the death dealings of mainstream film. The principal aim of this study, then, is to pursue and pin down these broader social attitudes and anxieties and, more precisely, what it is we are persuaded of, hardened to, or ‘buy ourselves free’ from in these moving representations. These innocuous or poignant filmic images of death also provide far more meaty testimony to life’s worth, to, that is, the unerring valuation of individuals’ existence that takes place in the medium. This is not to privilege existential angst or a philosophical approach, far from it. Rather, it isolates how mainstream cinema works to bestow value upon certain lives, specific sociocultural identities, in a hierarchical and partisan way. So, where the blood fests of the blockbuster might speak to the cheapness of life, these moving images of death divulge also what is held sacred and which lives are sovereign in cinema. It is niceties, then, that populate this study. Whether as the nobility of dutiful sacrifice (Chapters 1 and 3), the beauty of dying (Chapters 2 and 4) or the ‘progressiveness’ of post-racism (Chapter 5), mainstream cinema’s redemptive fantasies of death preach a corrective that masks what I will reveal as far more cynical, and sinister, mortal economies. By mortal economies I mean that film’s structuring logic or systems of exchange or encounter are underwritten by life’s worth, and by its, albeit imaginary, ‘capacity to dictate who may live and who must die’.16 Mainstream cinema is, in other words, an intrumentalisation of the politics of death or, after Achille Mbembe, ‘necropolitics’.17 The aim of Death and the Moving Image, then, is to unveil these mortal economies and thus the necropolitical frame to the outrageous fortune conjured by Hollywood and some of its best friends. Film’s primary corrective, or drive towards resolution or cure, belongs, to a great extent, to narrative itself. Mainstream narratives often end in death. This has as much to do with the Bildungsroman traditions of the feature film, the life journeys it has classically captured, as with the symbolic potential and flexibility of death.18 Death resolves the problems or themes of the text, in its punitive, profound or just finalising effect, but its functionality is not limited to films’ close. It plays a structural part throughout the narrative, whether or not it even occurs, or occurs only at the end. It provides, in other words, ‘a mechanism rather than a subject of representation’.19 At the same time, the shape and vibrancy of its part will be genre specific. Cinematic death has a particular relationship to narrative and genre, then, and though it remains subordinate to other issues in this book, its functionality animates the discussion throughout. In pursuing the paradox of the ‘paucity of experience and surplus of\n\n6\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nrepresentation’ of death in current times in the West, John Tercier turns his focus on CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to its depiction in television’s medical dramas.20 Pervasive, theatrical and uncommonly successful, television’s CPR skews statistical and other facts. But, for Tercier, it is obscene in that ‘[t]he traumatic realism of the resuscitative scene is meant to arouse us . . . it demands an emotional response not to the life that was lived, but to the spectacle of death’.21 Contemporising Gorer, Tercier expresses well the gratuitous pleasures of sensational immediacy here, of the ‘frenzied’ visuals of high-budget drama.22 He also, unwittingly, points to its ethical import. Making invisible or sequestering the dead and dying raises one set of ethical issues about the dismissal or ‘abjectification’ of vulnerability and the body in decline. But a sense of popular culture, channelling our capacity to be moved away from the human who is suffering and towards the dramatic effects of watching, raises yet another. Ethics will be a major theme in this study of death, as it has been for others, but my contrasting commitment to mass culture welds the concern for human relationality and its violent frame for encountering difference to popular entertainment and to the everyday fantasies of the majority.23 This is not to erect impenetrable barriers between mass and marginal artefacts or media, between high or low culture, or between real and fabricated suffering – quite the opposite. As I have previously argued of ethical spectatorship, a continuum operates between these.24 Real and imagined depictions of suffering, which can look alike and fill the same screens, command similar reactions and, therefore, connected theorisation. Part of the ethical landscape is a reckoning with precisely this, with the frame of entertainment for the news, say, or necropolitics for cinema. Similarly, a continuum of ethical reflection operates between the more rarefied or lowbrow images or texts. Where mass culture lends itself to moralism, ‘ethical reflection’, which is prioritised here, contests rather than cohabits with a state-sponsored prescription of right and wrong. Death and the Moving Image divulges the morality to mortality in cinema but it does so to point to something more dynamic, inherent, and even hopeful, in the relationship between film culture and human vulnerability. Returning to Tercier’s comment, and the parameters of this study, it is not just the grandeur of dramatic effect that lures us away from ethical reflection but the magnetism of affectivity itself. Interest has heightened in the spectators’ emotions, via film studies’ affective turn, or in their trauma, via the ‘cottage industry’ of its theorisation, since the 1990s.25 It is superseded here, however, by the question of how spectators’ reactions to these moving images extend film’s mortal economies. The valuation\n\n­\n\nin troduc t io n: e ve r ywhe re a n d n o wh e r e 7\n\nof some lives over others in mainstream cinema, so central to this study, takes place on-screen and off, in the text and in its context. It is, in other words, embedded in the film’s visual, visceral and narrative content but also in privileging the responses and conscience of the assumed audience. The Western spectator of mainstream cinema is woven into its necropolitics which affect and trauma theory don’t adequately cover.26 After all, as Vaheed Ramazani asserts, ‘the notion of trauma has become a privileged cliché of American, if not Western, culture in the new millennium’.27 On-screen suffering remains a fundamental coordinate to the moving image of death and dying but sustains complexity, politics and scepticism in this study. This is because, on the one hand, ‘the logic of vulnerability is a vast web of interconnecting vulnerabilites’: suffering always operates within, and compensates for, other systems of privation or stricture.28 On the other, the image is moving in that it here always depends upon the production of sentiment for its power; it always forces or reinforces channels of feeling and of ‘valuation’ regardless of one’s abilities to resist. So, while the moving image cannot but nod to film’s status as time-based media, and to Barthian concepts of photographic immortality, my use of it in the title of this book, and throughout, prioritises this different emphasis.29 When Tercier writes that ‘[i]n the twentieth century death abandoned real life for representation’, his pithy remark rings true in the context of his study but directs us to a central concern of mine: the way in which ‘real life’ so frequently stands for Western experience. It is, after all, only for some that death has abandoned real life.30 This book, in other words, contests the universality, and apolitics, of cultural interpretations of death and dying. Indeed, it infers they are unethical. ‘Identity’ influences, if not determines, how and where we expire or, as David Field, Jenny Hockey and Neil Small put it: ‘Worldly inequalities are in no way levelled at the time of death but persist, permeating every aspect of death and dying.’31 Identity is even, as Cornell West clarifies, a ‘matter of life and death’.32 More than this, geography, race, class, gender, age and so on determine our proximity to death and are crucial to what Walter Benjamin called our status as ‘dry dwellers of eternity’: whether we revel in the fantasies on the screen as our only, or primary, contact with mortal constraints or remain mired in the problems of malnutrition, disease, civil war or occupation.33 Context is everything. Though this book is fixed on mainstream Western culture and a ‘majority’ audience, it tries to keep the privileges and contingencies of this site and focus uppermost and seeks to resist the common if not ceaseless return to their concerns only, in other words, to their solipsistic thrall. Ariès’s work has proven to be a launch pad for much recent thinking\n\n8\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\non death and culture. Certainly his tendency ‘to assume that the dead are white, wealthy and male’ and his defining of culture via ‘educated and wealthy elites’ have been instrumental here.34 Meanwhile, the polarities inherent in his conclusions – the healthy past versus the unhealthy present, for example – proved resonant, if contentious, as did the favouring of loss over desire as the governing trope of culture’s treatment of mortality.35 Jonathan Dollimore, in particular, speaks extensively to the misdirection of theorists of death who look only to loss and denial, rather than to the erotic binding of desire and death.36 Elsewhere, I’ve privileged the erotic and ethical economies of spectatorship, and masochism’s primacy within it.37 Here, however, need and even perversity are oriented away from the self and towards a landscape or geopolitics of inequity and the deathly dealings of alterity that popular culture illuminates. The individual is crucial to this landscape but must not remain exceptional within it. That ‘I’ in this book’s subtitle, then, points to the importance of identity, subjectivity and sovereignty to the meaningfulness of film and to the (Althusserian) triangulation at its heart: of the sociopolitical, the aesthetic and the personal/psychological.38 Most importantly, that ‘I’ foregrounds the pattern and practice of privilege, the vortex of exclusivity and the tension with the ‘other’ upon which it depends. The major revision to Ariès’s argument is, of course, that death in contemporary Western society has not retreated into the private realm completely or convincingly at all. Rather, as Chris Townsend for one points out, culture is suffused with ‘engagements with death – literary and visual, musical as well as philosophical’.39 Scholarship has not been immune. There has been a steady but marked growth in interest in death and related topics, with an explosion in the twenty-first century, all at a time when death’s ‘recognition has become more publicly controlled and defined’.40 The question of film’s, or even film theory’s, place in such control and definition will haunt this book. Within film studies, deathrelated topics dominated at first and leant towards the broader themes gaining traction in the arts in the 1990s. Queer readings of AIDS and mourning, millennial analyses of mass culture and apocalyptic mythology, and the continuing, and related, postmodern debate on the death of film itself supplemented the escalating interest at the time in cultural history, memory, but especially trauma whose ‘star [was] rising within the academic firmament’.41 Marita Sturken, Suzannah Radstone and later Paul Grainge argue that cultural forms become important sites for the reflection and generation of individual and national loss and memory.42 The enduring and hypermediation of atrocity or disaster underlies the burgeoning critical interest\n\n­\n\nin troduc t io n: e ve r ywhe re a n d n o wh e r e 9 in cultural trauma that Wheeler Winston Dixon, Kirby Farell, Vera Dika and Mikita Brottman, among others, have written about in various ways in relation to film.43 Characterised by repetitiveness, redundancy, pessimism and, at times, prurience, these cultural productions, and their viewers, seemed to suggest Western culture’s growing hold on practices of death, and cinema’s distinction as a principal forum for fulfilling this. Certainly, the films that stage catastrophe, whether real or imagined, perform, or provide a public platform for, a cultural practice of death and mourning and, in so doing, they load death with historical and national meaning that cinema is perfectly positioned to impart. According to these theorists, they also work in different ways to displace fear, to offer catharsis, distraction or redemption. Led by the multifarious place of death in film, rather than the broader and emergent themes it animates, this study nevertheless pivots on its conservative functionality which these earlier works inform in explicit and implicit ways. Informed by the multidisciplinary trajectories of academic debate on the topic, first and foremost, Death and the Moving Image provides a survey of the representation of death and dying in mainstream cinema from its earliest to its latest renditions. In pursuing this range, it traverses narratives and genres fuelled by the prospect or promise of death, films filled with ‘actual’ death, and also grief-stricken tales of loss, fewer in number but more searing in effect. Its ‘before, during, after’ span takes into account this manifold presence – its expression or function as, say, structural charge, necessary spectacle or immobilising sorrow – and reflects this pseudochronology and figurative scope. That said, the three parts are neither discrete nor equally balanced: the brevity of the last is indicative of my turn away from trauma. But it is the benefits and price of death’s abiding conservatism in culture, of that ‘buying oneself free’, and its historical and technological contexts, that will be pursued most relentlessly here: the politics and aesthetics, ideology and iconography, of death in cinema perpetually troubled by ‘my’ part in it. How, then, do the various roles that death performs in the moving image – as something flirted with, embodied or responded to – determine the structural, aesthetic and political exchange between cinema and death? How do such variables as gender, sexuality or race, nation or narration or film-making practice have impact upon the representation of death and its sociocultural import? How does the fact that death ‘moves’ – in being filmic but especially in being emotive – render the study of the cinematic representation of death distinctly coercive or collective or ethically entangled? Part I, flirting with death, considers the precedence of ­self-endangerment,\n\n10\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nof the individual risking his or her life, in mainstream cinema. The first chapter addresses the action genre, the second suicide films, and the third looks at sacrifice in post-9/11 Hollywood. Moving from the timeless to the timely, from the recuperative to the absolutory, the section progresses from the structural role of flirting with death in film, its ‘recovery momentum’, in Chapter 1, to its detailed historical and geopolitical contextualisation in Chapter 3. In Chapter 2, film’s limited but highly ­symbolic representation of suicide, of the individual’s witting or selfwilled ­self-killing, affords the distinction of cinema’s mortal economies. These, the death-dealing visual and narrative logic of film itself, depend upon the interplay of identity and power, of, more immediately, gender, nation and race. This complex interplay, animated through the discussion of an Oscar-nominated Palestinian film, will remain in tension throughout the study and its identification of mainstream cinema as necropolitical. Part II addresses dying in cinema. Elaine Scarry’s seminal work on the unshareability and inexpressibility of pain provides the framework for exposing and exploring the rich cinematic language for bodily decline. It is a language of metaphor and of idiom; of the longhand of narrative and the shorthand of genre, but it is pre-structured in mainstream cinema by a grammar that seems irredeemably ideological. Chapter 4 maps out this language via the terminal illness film, its rigidity and its room for manoeuvre beyond Hollywood. The political underpinnings, and especially the racial unconscious of this language, preceding and determining it, are pursued in Chapter 5. Emerging steadily throughout, the ethical dimensions of the moving image of death are most fully explored in Chapter 6. The unshareability but connectivity of watching others die on, and through, film proposes a more radical cinematic language of human vulnerability. The last part contains a single concluding chapter. Drawing together the various discussions of the book, I locate, finally, this more radical relationship to human vulnerability within a Hollywood feature film about the Mexican–US borderland. In so doing, the book ends with the possibility of a more hopeful future for mainstream cinema’s dealings with death. Mainstream cinema is epitomised by Hollywood, by, that is, ‘white Hollywood’ where, as Mantha Diawara clarifies, ‘Blacks exist primarily for White spectators whose comfort and understanding the films must seek’.44 Hollywood provides most of the case studies here, and African American history a recurring setting for questions of race. This recurrence is inevitable given the pre-eminence of North American cultural history for any study of mainstream film and the primacy of black–white race relations within that history. But the relativity of social value, or the\n\n­\n\nin troduc t io n: e ve r ywhe re a n d n o wh e r e 11\n\nmortal economy of representation, as it gets played out to such vivid or veiled extremes in cinema, is always more than the seeming binary of this black–white relation. As Michele Wallace reminds us, ‘black stereotypes have become only the most visible symptom of the problem – the easiest thing to pick on’.45 Yet it is the broader dynamic of colonialism and subalternism that yields the intellectual frame to the study, that introduces its necropolitical approach to film in Chapter 2 and seals its wishful thinking in Chapter 7. I hope to keep that broader dynamic in play throughout. Though the place of gender within all this is, as always, of vital consideration, its significance is constrained. White Hollywood is invariably male, or at least masculinist, just as the non-white-authored films discussed below are directed, and populated, by men as well, but the double layer of women of colour’s erasure should not go unsaid. This erasure, this invisibility at the level of content and production, is an unavoidable feature of the terrain this study covers. The wishful thinking with which this book leaves off, that more hopeful future of Hollywood’s dealings with death, should be tempered accordingly. The North American emphasis is augmented by a comparative, as well as longitudinal and latitudinal, approach throughout. Non-Western, non-fiction and early examples expand the scope of this study, pointing to related concerns within film studies at the same time as complicating and, I hope, deepening our understanding of mainstream cinema and its (racialised and sexualised) normative consciousness. There is disproportionate attention to contemporary examples, but forceful reasons for this. Most obviously, there are simply more films of historical atrocity, terminal illness, bloody violence and so on, in this period due to well-known industrial and technological shifts. There was also that surge of scholarship on the topic. But there have been significant social and demographic changes that have had an impact on representation as well. Firstly, as Mary Bradbury acknowledges, ‘people live longer and take more time to die’.46 More narratives, or genres, about aging and dying would arise naturally, therefore. At the same time, the 1980s’ AIDS crisis resulted in a proliferation of texts about bodily vulnerability and dying in the West, as writers and other artists set their experiences to page, canvas or screen, enhancing this ‘era of autopathography’.47 The premillennial context occasioned another cause for the surge in apocalyptic narratives and, for Nancy Berns, ‘closure emerged so prominently’ in this period too, but the 1990s also witnessed a major increase in the representation of cancer.48 According to Robert Clark this occurred because the ‘leading edge of the “baby boom” generation . . . reached 44 years of age in 1990’.49 Such films,\n\n12\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nhe continues, ‘were now relevant to this generation’, but were also reflective of how ‘health care costs became a significant economic and political issue in the late 1980s’. Death and the Moving Image is then very much of its time: of the cultural, critical and historical location from which I write; of the urgencies surrounding the world’s economic crises, continuing and emerging conflicts, depleting resources and aging populations, and of the global expansion of film/digital cultures notwithstanding their enduring inequities.50 For Alessia Ricciardi, death’s proliferation within contemporary culture is down to the predominance of technologies, not least of the screen, providing new forums for death’s ‘basic, if problematic, ubiquity as a signifier’ as well as ‘new modes and constellations’ for mourning and, we might add, for that ‘frenzy of the visible’.51 While new screen technologies and the expansion of film cultures widen the field for death’s sombre or more extravagant return, such forums, as Margaret Gibson reminds us, inevitably widen the ‘gap between “real death” and its imagined or simulated forms’.52 Death, which is repressed or inaccessible in real life, returns in culture in various forms, genres and guises but still we must, as Sandra Gilbert puts it, ‘reconcile death denial with death display’.53 Such reconciliation underpins this book too, even as I seek to expand the context, to impose the politics, and to refuse the solipsism of death’s discrepancies. More than this, the specificities of the technology or media that manage this return, and their mass, niche or otherwise imagined audience, remain key to understanding film’s repetition of entrenched patterns of dealing with, taming, or even curing death in mass entertainment, or even its potential to break free. Indeed, this study traces another course, its own recuperative path perhaps, in pursuing this sense of the potentiality of film, even of mainstream film, to do death differently. For Leo Bersani the reassurances and redemptiveness that characterise culture can be shattered only by the radicality of art.54 Death and the Moving Image, however, seeks out some kind of shattering of the salvific impulses of Western culture from within its most popular forums. Film or, better still, film culture is taken here as a principal conduit of mainstream Western culture, of its import and, in fact, its exportation. Dedicated to the popular, to the political implications of mass culture’s themes and imperatives, this book’s abiding aim is to take the mainstream to task for its mortal economies but also ultimately to disinter the capacity for film, and film criticism, to engage with life and fragility more productively. Judith Butler, articulating a hope for a global community in the midst of the divisive inhumanity to others’ suffering, post-9/11, and the United States’ ‘war on terror’, prioritises the representation of vulnerability:\n\n­\n\nin troduc t io n: e ve r ywhe re a n d n o wh e r e 13 One would need to hear the face as it speaks in something other than language to know the precariousness of life that is at stake. But what media will let us know and feel that frailty, know and feel at the limits of representation as it is currently cultivated and maintained?55\n\nIt is to the power of the moving image to let us know and feel that frailty, to coerce but also to commune with human vulnerability, that I now turn.\n\nchapter 1\n\nSelf-endangerment and the Subject of Film\n\nLegend has it that, when the first moving images were shown to the public in Paris in 1895, the Lumière brothers’ Train Pulling into a Station had the small audience running for their lives. Though this is a telling tale of the remarkable potential of the new technology – especially its capacity to harness perspective and illusion in the service of the sensational – more interesting, for our purposes, is how, almost immediately, ‘cinema going’ meant a brush with danger.1 Of course, it is rarely the case that cinema is truly dangerous, that it actually involves risk or causes death, though its strong ties to propagandist and to subversive expression evidence its power and have restricted its use across historical and national contexts. But this primal scene of cinema history and of the media’s imperilling potential usefully delineates the main interests of the first section of this book. I want to argue that the moving image still involves, if not depends upon, some kind of encounter with what might be called self-­endangerment. On the one hand, this is an argument about film content, on the centrality of risk to narrative and to genre, and to the set pieces, spectacles and character arcs that constitute them. On the other hand, it is an argument about the experience of watching film, specifically how it involves some kind of surrender or abandon, albeit a thrilling and temporary one. Cinema is about self-endangerment, then, in terms of both content and spectatorship. Part I’s task is to illustrate this claim. It will show how self-endangerment is both rife and central to narrative pleasure but also, crucially, how ‘safe’, ultimately or unconsciously, it is made to be. The representation of self-endangerment, not least in its murky distinction from suicide, will be shown to be only temporary, and in Hollywood, at least, conservative: its perilous promise cushioned by irreality or failed realisation. Its protagonists, and the spectators who share in it, are ‘saved’ in the end. The danger was all part of the fun: the journey’s thrills and final reassurances. As the title – ‘Flirting with death’ – suggests, such a dalliance with danger, by characters and by spectators, is a staged and\n\n18\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nmanaged affair, and one that lies at the heart of the medium’s potential (and prestructured) conservatism: its self-limiting playfulness, its ‘first base’-only ethos. A number of trite distinctions emanates from this, not least those pertaining to the differences between, say, mainstream and independent film, and between Western and third cinema: the conservatism of the Hollywood model, for example, versus what is authentic, subversive or free about others. The comparative conservatism of Hollywood will be a recurring question in the book as we position its texts, and those closely related to it, against other contexts, in order properly to gauge the meaning of the mainstream. In this first chapter I shall argue for the pervasiveness, and productivity, of self-endangerment, and of the narrative’s ‘prospect of death’ in mainstream cinema. But what purpose might such an argument serve? What does reframing cinema in these terms reveal about cinema or, indeed, about its relationship to death? Where, in the introduction, I rehearsed various answers to this question more generally, what is disclosed here, quite vividly, is the significance of self-endangerment to explaining mainstream film’s pleasures and politics. How can the prospect of death be entertaining? How can it structure and determine narrative pleasure, and what, therefore, might this tell us about the sociocultural, aesthetic, or psychic, function of self-endangerment in cinema? In what follows I consider how self-endangerment – as self-risk that references death – is structured into film content in broad terms before moving on to specifics in order to build a more detailed answer to these questions. There are two sets of films that can be distinguished for their centralisation of self-endangerment, for their perpetual reference to the prospect of death. That is not to say that numerous other groups of films, or genres, don’t depend upon such a prospect. They do. Indeed, one of the aims of this book is to show how pervasive death and its cultural accoutrement are in film. Horror, for example, is characterised by the imminence of violent death. The narratives of film noir and melodrama are driven by the fatalism of their protagonists. While all these genres, however, are populated by characters who are reckless, often in their disregard for the warnings of others or their inability to control their passions, their relationship with death is irrational or frequently fantastic and, for now at least, not our concern. Our focus here is, instead, on self-endangerment as logical, as willed, as known: as an expectation both of the protagonists and of the audience. The first set of films, and the main focus of this opening chapter, represents the ‘genre’ most replete with death and most shaped by self-endangerment: the action film. With its numerous subgenres, and\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 19\n\nconstant hybridisation, the scepticism of those scare quotes attends its dubious status and definition as genre (indeed, it seems the paradigmatic post-genre genre) though, for ease, I shall continue to use the term. Intimately tied to the development of the blockbuster, and epitomising recent industrial trends, the action film has come to dominate what is thought of as mainstream cinema as well as its exportability. In this way, self-endangerment is an ever­-proliferating feature of film content. The second set of films lies at the opposite extreme. It represents the rarest image or theme, that of suicide, of self-endangerment for its own sake and the embrace, rather than proximity, of death, and it will be the focus of Chapter 2. Where the action film comes to define the mainstream project, the suicide film seems antithetical to it. And yet both, as will become clear, have much in common. Before I turn to the action film, I want to establish a more general principle: the place of peril in narrative per se. To do this, I’ll look briefly at two Hollywood films, Mr Jones and Fearless, both produced in 1993. Despite star protagonists (Richard Gere and Jeff Bridges) and directors of note (Mike Figgis and Peter Weir), Mr Jones and Fearless as male melodramas, and those dealing with suicidal tendencies and mental illness to boot, were hardly remarkable in their critical or financial impact.2 They do, however, encapsulate the broader structural function of selfendangerment in mainstream film, and distil some of the key issues for the emerging discussion. Primarily, they reveal how self-endangerment’s place within, and punctuation of, the text dovetails with the conservatisms of mainstream narrative (and spectatorship). They also introduce, in what will become a familiar refrain, the ideological and aesthetic coordinates activated through it. These will prove increasingly important as the chapter, and the book, progresses. Mr Jones and Fearless have a striking image in common: they both emphasise a scene in which the male lead stands upon the ledge of a tall building in a mortality-testing, death-defying, and martyr-invoking moment. It is a recurrent image in Mr Jones, framing the narrative – it is where the film starts and where it ends – and in Fearless, as well as being pivotal to the plot, it provides the advertising picture; it represents the film. While the similarities between these two films run beyond this shared image, so contrary an image of a male lead in a Hollywood narrative, they do not, however, stray far from their association with self-endangerment. Having been rescued from the ledge of the house he was working on as a carpenter, Mr Jones (Gere) is admitted to a mental hospital, but soon released. When readmitted, he is confirmed as suffering from manic depression. He wins his competency hearing and is discharged rather\n\n20\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nthan involuntarily committed. This displeases his psychiatrist Dr Bowen (played by Lena Olin) to whom an attachment continues to develop until he ‘crashes’ and agrees to remain in hospital as her patient. Bowen uncovers the roots of his problems partly through investigating his story. Taking this as betrayal, Jones leaves the hospital. The doctor pursues him, they are reconciled and their relationship becomes sexual. Bowen eventually resigns, having had Jones transferred. Jones, again feeling betrayed by her, gets released and returns to his earlier manic ways. Warned of his potential suicide attempt, Bowen follows him to the original ledge. Because of her presence he does not jump. The film ends with them reunited, sitting on the roof. In Fearless, an aeroplane has crashed. Max Klein (Bridges) is one of the few survivors and leads the others to safety. Suffering from post-traumatic syndrome, Max keeps proving his invincibility to himself by acts of selfendangerment. These include eating strawberries to which he had previously been dangerously allergic. Having befriended another traumatised passenger, Carla (played by Rosie Perez), he ‘cures’ her feelings of guilt for her baby’s death by re-enacting the impact of the plane through a car crash. She is restored to herself but Max ends up in intensive care. Recovering, he goes home with his wife (Isabella Rossellini) from whom he had separated earlier. He ‘reacts’ to a strawberry but returns from the edge of death.\n\nSelf-endangerment and Narrative Structure: the Recovery Momentum In both Fearless and Mr Jones the climactic final scene involves a selfendangering situation founded upon revisiting the ‘primal’ one: the opening one of the film. Max mentally revisits the plane crash while he is asphyxiating on a strawberry; Jones returns to the ledge from which he was about to jump at the beginning of the film. Cure, especially in Fearless, hinges upon the revisitation or repetition of the original trauma: a highly therapeutic pattern akin to the psychoanalytic process. In this way, the films offer themselves as healing processes and invoke ‘madness’ as illness but especially as the ‘disequilibrating’ force in the narrative: adversity temporary and contained. In Freud’s early writings and practice of hypnosis, the talking cure involved the recalling and reliving of the suppressed feelings that originally caused illness, which ‘permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and in arousing its accompanying effect’.3 This re-enactment, or ‘abreac-\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 21 tion’, undid or cured the original trauma. The importance of re-enacting to recovery remained central to psychoanalysis as it developed, even as the talking cure was dismissed in its simplicity, in its inability to account for the repetition rather than disappearance of trauma-inspired symptoms. When emotions caused by the original psychic trauma are suppressed, the patient is destined to repeat them, or rather repeat situations that provoke them: . . . the subject deliberately places himself in distressing situations, thereby repeating an old experience, but he does not recall this prototype; on the contrary, he has the strong impression that the situation is fully determined by the circumstances of the moment.4\n\nIn this way, the ‘compulsion to repeat’ allows the patient to dwell within his or her trauma, rather than to expel the traumatic emotions: ‘the patient repeats instead of remembering, and repeats under the conditions of resistance’.5 The repetitive compulsion is undone only through its interpretation (by way of analysis) and working through (by the patient). In this way, as Freud stressed, cure is not as simple or immediate as the moment or act of discharge, or abreaction, implicit to his and Breuer’s earlier work.6 The narrative in Fearless is a variation of this curative process, of the ‘remembering and working through’ of Freudian therapy.7 The lifethreatening situation of the aeroplane crash is the origin of Max’s trauma. He represses the anxieties it produced in him, such as his fear of death or will to live, feeling himself instead to be fearless if not immortal. The film follows his repetitive, ‘fearless’ self-endangering activities as revisitations of these emotions of resistance. It is only when his self-endangerment, in the final scene, allows him to submit to the original anxieties that he is cured. That the curative process is inscribed within the social and domestic space, rather than within the medical realm, makes it more accessible to the viewers (while reifying the normative, the family). Cure operates only through Max’s own processes of self-awareness and not directly as the result of therapy. In fact, Fearless takes itself out of, or at least diminishes, the medical discussion of mental illness, and the therapist is postured as something of a buffoon. Rather than the plane crash being forgotten by Max, it is a constant presence in the film: in his dreams, memories and drawings – those areas where the unconscious slips through.8 The heavy presence in the film of Max’s thoughts or, rather, memories – what could be called his ­‘mindscreen’9 – both signifies subjectivity and intensifies identification for the spectator who is strongly aligned with the protagonist during\n\n22\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nthese periods of heightened subjective experience. In this way, the curative process is not only available to the audience but also confirmed as the governing experience of the film. The spectator shares in the trauma but also in its discharge. This position for the spectator, and ‘purpose’ for the film in confronting trauma – expelling, displacing or indulging it – will resurface throughout this book. The initial life-threatening experience of Jones is not meant to be the origin of his ‘illness’ but a symptom of it. The narrative of Mr Jones can also be seen, however, as an episode in illness and cure, in that this original scene, while not the originating trauma for the character, serves as the original trauma for the viewer which is then revisited at closure. In fact, narrative itself could be seen to follow this path, so that recovery is always precisely about a form of repetition, a repetition of equilibrium. Where cure in Fearless involves the resurrection of the past and rejection of self-endangerment, in Mr Jones it incorporates balance which necessarily extends beyond the protagonist alone. Jones comes back from the edge and Bowen comes up to meet him, as an answer to his earlier question: ‘what would you risk everything for?’ While Mr Jones might be seen to offer a less conventional path or representation of mental illness, the mutuality of its ending seems more reflective of the heterosexual momentum of the piece, the union of the man and the woman fundamental to Hollywood narrative, than the machinations of transference that it nevertheless plays out. Where Mr Jones subsumes self-endangerment within the romance narrative and the rather lame but popular plea for moderation, Fearless closes off self-endangerment with the grand and unrealistic gesture of the final curative moment, so that it seems, ultimately, a point of plot. Where Mr Jones has been reduced to the status of ‘conventional melodrama’,10 Max’s return from death at Fearless’s end ‘smacks of a loss of nerve’.11 In both cases, again truer to the conventions of Hollywood narrative cinema than to the treatment of mental illness, the men are saved by the women who love them, and the films trace the passage back to, and recovery of, the lost or self-endangered self. This quest for identity is confirmed by the final scenes in which the women call the men back from the edge of death by shouting their names: they are literally saved by the assertion of their identities, through interpellation. It isn’t just melodramas, or mental illness films, that follow this curative trajectory. Mainstream cinema has a particular narratival relationship to self-affirmation. Broadly put, narrative closure is traditionally marked by the triumph of the protagonist’s self over adversity (even though, of course, closure can involve the death of a character, even the\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 23\n\nprotagonist).12 This trajectory, then, can be recast as a narrative investment in recovery; a formulation that proves especially meaningful for the analysis of filmic representations of illness, and Chapter 4 will take this further. Classical Hollywood cinema is the defining system at the base of mainstream film production, and has become synonymous with its principle characteristic, the traditional narrative: the succession of events in a ‘cause–effect relationship’.13 Closure is a key feature, the ultimate expression of narrative intent, confirming the meeting of expectations, the answering of questions and the stilling of movement. Narratives of illness often follow traditional paths of bravery and triumph but narrative itself can be seen as a passage to the resolution of problems, to the recovery of harmony as, in fact, quintessentially about cure. So cure, as illustrated in Mr Jones and Fearless, embodies both the conservatism of the text and the implicated viewer’s therapeutic investment, and coheres usefully into what I’d like to call the recovery momentum of narrative. The will to closure is a formidable force and crucial to mainstream film. It is condensed, most frequently, into the happy ending and its gestures of conventional love: unification, domestication and marriage. As we look further into the recovery momentum of mainstream narrative, as a psychic and social passage to self-reaffirmation, we find strategies not only for maintaining the status quo but, more explicitly, for maintaining and policing normative identity within it. While both Fearless and Mr Jones suggest this reinforcement (both end with the bonding of the romantic couple), at this juncture it is not the meaning or ideology of narrative that is key but its structuring, the idea of closure as a return following disruption. Both Vladimir Propp and Tzvetan Todorov, the key theorists of narrative, speak to this sense of recovery. Todorov turned Propp’s conception of the narrative’s struggles between, for example, good and evil (as hero and villain),14 into the equilibrating path of a narrative: the opening state of social harmony suffers a disruption, usually in the form of a villain’s intervention, before order or, as John Fiske puts it, ‘another, preferably enhanced or more stable, state of equilibrium’ is restored.15 The recovery momentum proves a useful analogue for mainstream cinema’s (conservative) investment in cure and self-affirmation, or, and as we shall see later especially, cure as self-affirmation. Mr Jones and Fearless, with their male protagonists and their emphasising, even mythologising, of recovery – their depictions are underwritten by messianic themes and images – allow the men to overcome fully their self-endangering condition. They integrate these seemingly oppositional characters into their mainstream projects and, in so doing, negotiate the interplay between an emphasis upon self-endangerment and conventional reassurances.\n\n24\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nThough repeating and even reiterating Hollywood’s narratival favouring of the male existential experience, Fearless and Mr Jones are suffused with self-risk and, as such, offer the fascinating incidence, and management, of contrary motivations. As we turn to action cinema, a genre that depends, at least superficially, on duty rather than on trauma to fund its pervasive spectacles of self-risk, we find, nevertheless, a similar play-off. This genre’s preoccupation with self-endangerment surpasses the recovery momentum to reveal something ambiguous but resounding about ‘flirting with death’ itself.\n\nMavericks and Martyrs: Action Cinema and the Marvellous Anticipation of Death Action cinema, as its name suggests, prioritises action sequences over the intricacies of storytelling, spectacle over narrative, surface over depth. This is, at any rate, how it has been theorised and how, for some, it encapsulates profit-led, dumbed-down Hollywood. Various writers have sought to recover the genre, or rather the critical value of the genre, from arguments fixated on those simple oppositions, or, rather, they have extricated from these oppositions important arguments on the play-off between, say, high and low culture, mainstream and marginal production, male and female visual pleasures or consumer affinities.16 Gender has proved to be a recurring priority of such criticism, and industrial and technological trends of increasing interest.17 These critical issues will infuse our analysis too: reframing action cinema as about self-endangerment tends to support the various arguments advanced about how the genre is meaningful, especially in terms of the maleness, and the commercial and ideological currency, of the subjectivity it expounds. That the genre in which death is most expected is also the one seen as least capable of profundity, nods immediately to the odd place of death within culture. Action cinema is characterised by the fast-paced, adrenalin-fuelled, depiction of pursuit or competition and, invariably, of combat. The nature of the pursuit and/or combat – whether on horseback, on foot, or as the oft-obligatory car chase – depends on subgenre and social context. What I mean is, the western, the war film, the Japanese samurai film, or the various waves of the Hollywood gangster or disaster movie, all provide different settings for ‘action’; all wage different forms of battle with eraspecific degrees of graphicness based on national production codes as much as on the special effects available. The amount of blood we see, or the body count, depends not only upon issues of censorship or cultural\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 25\n\npractice but also upon technology, though, as will become evident, it is not graphic realism that provides death’s key indexes here. What action films share, and what makes them so popular and in such primal terms, is the thrill of showing one individual or group pitted against another individual or group or, as in the sci-fi action movie, against some external threat to his or their existence. This is our modern coliseum. ‘Life or death’ is invariably what is at stake in this pitting, and what makes it so thrilling. This is as true of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai/Shichinin no Samurai (1954), the urtext of action cinema, as it is of Guy Hamilton’s Goldfinger (1964) or Tony Scott’s Top Gun (1988) or the Wachowski brothers’ The Matrix (1999). Action ensues through the need to compete, to win out, to survive. It ensues from the dangers integral to the plots of the films but also to the job specifications of the central characters, and it ensues, most importantly, as self-risk. The warrior, the secret agent, the fighter pilot . . . the messiah, must, by definition, confront death. And death must pervade the films to prove the status of the central characters and, with it, their value(s), valour and, often, patriotism. In this way, tied up in the self-endangerment of the action figures is a host of qualities that perform the films’ ideological work but also find self-endangerment, the individual’s life-risking, straying ever further from its ‘actual’ presence in society. You don’t have to be David Blaine (or Harry Houdini) or ‘Men on Wires’ either to realise that spectacular acts of self-risk are rarely witnessed by the masses or to acknowledge their marketability.18 Such acts, however, further obscure the self-destructive or suicidal behaviours of a not insignificant proportion of the population. Heroin addicts, the morbidly obese or depressives join extreme sports junkies in a catalogue of private hazards. Cinema, then, creates and indulges a fantasy of self-endangerment, and it is this fantasy, while acknowledging the gap between it and the real, that is also coming under scrutiny here. It is important to emphasise that action cinema, though saturated with the death of others, frequently nameless and faceless others, centres on self-endangerment. This distinction is crucial: it places the onus on the self, on the machinations of subjectivity, which is a main focus of mine. It also represents the turning inward of outward aggression, of sadism, which Freud termed secondary masochism.19 Rather than stress the masochistic economy of cinema, as I have done in previous work, psychoanalytic understandings of this turn or return are less important here than other things.20 Indeed, in later chapters, Levinasian understandings of it will more fully take their place. For now, though, this emphasis on the self reminds us that film is a self-centred medium, a key exponent of Western individualism and individuation. Though hardly news, given the\n\n26\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nmedium’s developmental domination by Hollywood, cultural and national coordinates will become increasingly pertinent. We shall move on to the ideological work of self-endangerment in film later but, for now, let us explore its more formal qualities. Action cinema is centred on self-endangerment in three main ways. Firstly, the films are underwritten by the prospect of death that emerges immediately and is referred to throughout the text in both vocal and visual terms: as spectacles and within dialogue. This expectation of death is also created extracinematically through pre-sell strategies and the audience expectation accompanying such high-concept genre films. Film content, then, is framed by the likelihood of fatal consequences and punctuated by death-dealing events. Secondly, this expectation coalesces in the numerous ‘actual’ self-endangering activities of the main protagonist, activities that ‘he’ invites, confronts but also generates. Crucially, this self-­endangerment exceeds the dangerous or death-dealing events and any fatalistic ambience, and takes on greater meaning. So, thirdly, the dangers of the job, the dutiful self-endangerment, is joined by, indeed it affords, self-endangerment of another sort: self-endangerment as non-conformity but also, often, as recklessness. This sort brings with it a host of other, related conditions – self-loathing, trauma, suicidal tendencies and acts – it is, in other words, a version of self-risk that is much closer to its ‘real’ presence in society. It is this third area that is the most telling for our purposes for it moves beyond the superficial allure of the spectacle of heroism that characterises the genre to reveal the individual’s and the collective’s fragile ego beneath. Top Gun epitomises the genre both in its focus on mortal combat and in its instigative role in the growth of action cinema in the late 1980s and 1990s. It was also the ‘first VHS title to ship more than one million copies’.21 But, more than this, it epitomises the genre’s three-pronged relationship to self-endangerment, just outlined, through its central character Pete ‘Maverick’ Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise. The film starts and ends with spectacles of self-endangerment to which Maverick is both incidental and central but, as will be shown, his self-risk exceeds the notions of duty that underwrite them. Maverick is a fighter pilot with a reputation for remarkable skill, for disregarding authority and even for recklessness. The film is structured around various aerial combats and, or mostly as, training exercises in which fighter pilots display their derring-do pursuing the ‘enemy’ across the sky. These extended sequences powerfully simulate the high-speed, perilous encounters and the urgency, bravery and bravado implicit in the men’s actions. With the camera ‘in the cockpit’, the action unfolds through close-ups on the pilots or as their point-of-view shots as\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 27\n\nthey pursue the alien MiGs, and this thrilling intimacy is intensified by the raspy voices of their headset exchanges as well as by the melodramatic cadences of the rock music soundtrack. In other words, there is a major investment (in cinematic and financial terms) in heightening the spectator’s alignment with the self-endangering experience. The film starts with just such a sequence: the dangerous spectacle that establishes the risks of the job and the high stakes that underpin all subsequent action to underwrite the film with the prospect of death. Maverick and Goose (Anthony Edwards) and Cougar (John Stockwell) and Merlin (Tim Robbins) are in two planes engaged in battle with an unidentified enemy that has crossed into United States airspace. The US planes win the showdown: they become ‘locked on’, their missiles’ target centred on the enemy plane. In the lexicon of aerial combat, to be locked on means ‘you’re dead’. The enemy retreats as a result. While we see almost no dying or dead bodies in the film, we know that a plane exploding means death, and that being ‘locked on’ causes it. Becoming ‘locked on’ is the goal of aerial combat and of the training exercises, and it means that the prospect of death is ever present, and constantly referred to, without ‘actual’ death ever needing to happen.22 Indeed, in this opening sequence, the equation is enough for the combat to conclude. This does not conclude the opening scene’s exposition of self-endangerment, however. Cougar, thrown by the encounter, has some kind of panic attack while returning to the aircraft carrier and is unable to control his plane fully to land safely. Maverick ahead of him, and dangerously low on fuel, defies the order to land and heads back to talk Cougar down, thereby risking his own and Moose’s life. If what fighter pilots do is dangerous, then Maverick’s version of it is even more so. The danger of being a fighter pilot resides not simply in combat itself but in the extra high-risk activity of aerial combat.23 What is established in this opening sequence, then, is death’s proximity but also Maverick’s particular flirtation with it. Self-risk is the norm in this environment but Maverick, as his name foretells, takes further risks by breaking the rules. It is not just his exceptional flying skills or contrast to weaker others (such as Cougar) that single him out, or even his arrogance, but his refusal to toe the line. He manages to defy various prohibitions: he is not court-marshalled for disregarding orders but awarded a place at ‘Top Gun’, the exclusive pilot training school, and he has an affair with a teacher there (Charlie, played by Kelly McGillis) and a teacher who originally rejects his advances. He even manages to evade ‘you’re dead-ness’: despite being locked on to by another plane, Maverick’s daring flying defies death and the previous logic of the equation. But there is a disturbing edge to his non-conformity: there is more to his self-­endangerment\n\n28\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nthan professional and patriotic obligation, or macho superiority. As Iceman (Val Kilmer) puts it: ‘every time you go up in the air, you’re unsafe’. Even Moose tells him that he feels scared as a result of Maverick’s recklessness. When, shortly afterwards, Moose dies while ejecting from their out-of-control plane, this tragedy and Maverick’s unavoidable implication in it, forces Maverick to reappraise his relationship to his reckless self-risk.24 Within this reappraisal is a resolving of an older issue that, to some extent, is meant to account for his behaviour. His fighter pilot father’s mysterious and ‘classified’ death – which threw into doubt the ‘old man’s’ abilities – haunts Maverick as much as any psychological complexity could play a part in this shallow tale. When visiting his superior officer, Viper (Tom Skerritt), after his and Moose’s accident, and being cleared of responsibility for it, Maverick hears the truth about what happened to his father. Viper explains that the secrecy surrounding the event was due to the fact that the combat that killed him took place on the wrong side of an international border and not, therefore, because his father had done something wrong. He then asks Maverick: ‘Is that why you fly the way you do? Trying to prove something? Yeah, your old man did it right . . . His F-4 was hit, and he was wounded, but he could’ve made it back. He stayed in it, saved three planes before he bought it.’ While dutiful self-risk and, finally, self-sacrifice explain the father, other factors contribute to Maverick’s wilful, nay suicidal, recklessness. In many ways he is simply, albeit temporarily, ‘damaged’ – his sense of self caught up in an endless, and necessarily destructive, testing of his own skill, of ‘living up’ to, but also surpassing, his absent father – and such damaged men frequent the genre. But a key factor to this tale is a masculinist proving of potency: an arrogant self-regard that militates against the necessary selflessness that defines a true hero. This isn’t to say that, in coming finally to define true heroism, masculinist principles are dispelled by the film but rather that they are refined. Heroism, according to cinema, requires self-risk but self-risk for one grand purpose only: to save others. Heroism, and male potency here, is compromised, therefore, if self-endangerment is tainted by the ego, by narcissism, or by suicide. Such self-endangerment, such tainting must be temporary: it must be recovered to its ideal form. Following a period of shaken confidence, Maverick gets back in the saddle for a ‘real’ combat situation. Though he falters briefly, he saves the day: protecting his colleagues and his country. Only then, only through this lesson, can he truly qualify as hero, and be rewarded accordingly. In keeping with the paralleling of his potency as pilot and lover, this reward finds him taking up his rightful position as teacher at Top Gun, and as Charlie’s lover once again.25\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 29 This structural, episodic and refined self-endangerment is absolutely typical of the action genre. If we turn to another seminal action film, Lethal Weapon (Richard Donner, 1987), we find the same thing. In its definition of heroism, it promotes, but then eschews, reckless self-endangerment by, or rather as, its end. This time it is Mel Gibson who takes the role of an exceptionally talented but maverick serviceman, the police officer Martin Riggs. This film is much more explicit about the significance of self-risk to its narrative, to the construction and appeal of its hero, and to the thrills of the action genre. Where Top Gun put the emphasis on male mastery, Lethal Weapon keeps displaying its hero in a state of compromise and stresses the proximity of death. The film is full of death-dealing scenes – it is a ‘shoot-em up’ after all – but the first death, the film’s opening sequence, depends upon the lure and aesthetics of suicide to set the tone. The film opens with a death which, typically for a mainstream narrative, establishes the themes of the film: drugs, the city, but also self-risk. A young blonde woman awakens mid-coke- and sex-induced reverie, writhing on a bed. She is wearing little: a negligee and knickers. After a little fingertip nibbling, she snorts a bit more coke and, with a smile on her face, takes a look at the view from the balcony of the high-rise apartment, her top blowing open in the wind. Next we see her mounting and then jumping from the railings. Her slow-motion descent is captured as a point-of-view shot and as long and side shots, and concluded with the camera inside the car that her fall crushes. Despite this car-crushing demise, she lands, oddly beatific on the roof. No blood spatter, no twisted limbs, just a beautiful and markedly feminine and sexualised corpse that has more in common with pornography, both soft core and snuff, than with any realistic depiction of a dead body. Just in case we should have missed how gratuitous this opening sequence is, we are told shortly afterwards that the woman was actually murdered, having been poisoned prior to her grand leap: ‘If she hadn’t have jumped she’d have been dead within 15 minutes’. Ludicrous and trashy though this is, it makes clear something I will keep coming back to in this study: the way that death in cinema is not simply about the slaughtering of enemies but a pervasive aesthetic of self-risk too. This ‘wasted’ experience contrasts dramatically with the other suicide scenes in the film. Indeed, we receive at least three in the first thirty-five minutes: ‘at least’ because our introduction to Riggs’s self-risk is somewhat more ambiguous: it sees him striding past colleagues sheltering from bullet fire, to egg on a lone and evidently unskilled gunman to shoot at him. When, unsurprisingly, the gunman misses, Riggs aims, fires, and takes him out. Again non-conformity combines with recklessness and selfendangerment to amplify heroism. As the commanding officer present\n\n30\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nFigure 1.1 The temporarily Falling Man.\n\nsays: ‘You’re a psycho son of a bitch but you’re good’. Called to the scene of a suicidal man atop a building, Riggs joins him on the ledge and, rather than talk the man down, Riggs forces him to jump to the inflatable crash pad below, and jumps with him. What is more, any ambiguity attending Riggs’s self-risk is thoroughly cleared up in an unusually graphic and rare depiction of male suicidal intent. Riggs, slumped on the floor in front of the television and empty beer cans, a photograph of his dead wife and son on his lap, weeps as he places his loaded gun, his lethal weapon, into his mouth. He is unable to fire, however. This inability to fire, here, contrasts sharply with his utter lack of hesitation, his trigger-happiness, elsewhere and clarifies the different stakes of the two versions of his self-endangerment: how the former, the ‘psycho son of a bitch’ scenario, can constitute heroism and the latter compromises it. Though these two work in opposition, and are rendered distinct, they are absolutely entangled. While Riggs is unable to pull the trigger, his proximity to death underwrites all of his actions as his new partner recognises immediately. Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is well aware of Riggs’s reputation for a reckless disregard for his own safety, for being, as well as using, his ‘lethal weapon’ but clarifies, as Top Gun did, too, how such self-risk is antithetical to dutiful selfendangerment for it imperils the lives of others, not least that of Murtaugh himself who is ‘too old for this shit’. The gun, Murtaugh says, is for control and incapacitation, not killing, though he’ll come to moderate this view.\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 31 In action cinema, a self-risking protagonist is a genre requirement, and a hero with a ‘death wish’ is the stuff of film legend. While selfendangerment in action cinema has a formulaic, and profoundly conservative, function, and there will be more on its ideological conservatism later, the genre’s use of it, and its broader implications for our cultural understanding of death, are not adequately explained either by the curative logic that is closure (the recovery momentum) or by the grandeur of the high-stakes spectacle: in other words, neither by its structural nor its sensational roles. Clearly, enacting and resolving self-endangerment enable numerous opportunities to prove the dimensions of the hero’s fearlessness and the film’s budget (and Hollywood’s investment in the status quo) and self-endangerment’s formal and spectacular endowments are obvious. But self-endangerment itself is neither singular nor straightforward. As Top Gun and Lethal Weapon reveal, there are, at base, two seemingly simple types at play here, one ‘bad’ one ‘good’. While the move from bad to good self-endangerment represents that curative logic or conservatism, the move is hardly linear and the two types are far from discrete.26 When dutiful, professional, even non-conformist, self-risk slips into, or becomes, framed by suicidal recklessness, then self-endangerment is tainted. It must be restored to its ‘purer’ form for conventional closure to be achieved. Curious, but significant, conclusions arise from this. Firstly, action cinema but, more specifically, its definition of the dutiful self-­endangerment of heroism, contains, even depends upon, reference to suicide or, at least, to a reckless, unnecessary or gratuitous self-endangerment. Put another way, in the action film, dutiful self-endangerment always slips into suicidal or gratuitous recklessness. Heroic self-risk, it would seem, cannot exist without reference to its shadow. Secondly, this gratuitousness often represents a stylisation, an aestheticisation of selfrisk. Such stylisation exceeds the required audience appeal of the highstakes spectacle – the special-effects-enhanced life-’n’-death battle is lure enough already – and, instead, functions to bestow value upon the life that is imperilled, a function that becomes increasingly important in this book. Thus, the construction of dutiful self-endangerment, that is, of heroism, is ambiguous, it is muddy, both in its entanglement with the ‘psycho’ or non-heroic version and in the inevitable, if dubious, visual pleasures that accompany its aesthetic renderings. In what follows we’ll look more closely at these conclusions and thus to the complexity of self-­endangerment’s relationship to the ‘subject’ of cinema, by which I mean not just its recurring content, its favoured stories, but its favoured version of self-hood.\n\n32\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nFavourite Subjects The action film – the most exportable, that is globalised, and most popular, that is lucrative, film genre – is replete with risk-taking protagonists but, as I’ve suggested above, their practices mean more than just a ready audience or return. The depiction of heroic self-risk is tied to its shadow, to its darker side, though the shape and weight of this connection vary. Films filled with dutiful self-endangerment – action films and their associated subgenres and precursors – are, perhaps surprisingly, framed by reference to suicide. I say surprisingly because both logic and faith – as religious or patriotic fervour – dictate that the aggrandising of ‘cause’ does not sit well with the doubt or despair associated with suicide. But therein lies the rub: religious and secular notions of self-risk have longstanding, though oft-ignored, antinomy. Self-risk and self-sacrifice are deified in JudaeoChristian tradition, revered in ‘legitimated’ nationalist practices – that is, those associated with this tradition, rather than Islam say – but prohibited, policed, and criminalised within society. No wonder things get muddy in their cultural expression. Increasingly apparent, of course, is the need to define what suicide means, and this will come, but for now the emphasis on the gratuitousness of these depictions, on an indulgence in charisma- or crisis-oriented self-risk, serves us well in understanding the thrills of the action film and the import of its central characters. To return, then, to the first of those curious conclusions: looking in any direction from Top Gun and Lethal Weapon reveals a repetition of heroism’s odd connection to its underside. Robert Aldrich’s The Dirty Dozen (1967) is a war film about twelve convicts who are trained as soldiers and given a high-risk mission behind enemy lines. Should they succeed in the mission, their crimes and sentences will be pardoned. The men are chosen because of their expendability – they all have long or life sentences – and what that credential lends to the task (and, of course, to the genre). The flimsy tie the men have to their own mortality, ‘we’re all dead anyway’ one says, clearly provides the proximity to death required for an action-based narrative. The film opens with a hanging in the military prison, however, and then goes on to emphasise the suicidal tendencies of the men. A close-up on laceless shoes and a comment about how a prisoner’s guitar is without strings confirm that the men are ‘high suicide risk’ and have had removed from their cells anything that could be used by an inmate to take his own life. The tone that is set for the film is not of self-sacrifice in the glory of combat but that of a narrative baptised in the iconography of stage-managed deaths. Heroism will be excavated from some of these men but, though their circumstances amply\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 33 commend them to the requisite risk-taking, heroism here remains haunted by self-killing.27 The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963), another classic war film, is set in a German prisoner-of-war camp during World War II. It tells of a mass escape by the Allied forces imprisoned there. Early on, their ranking officer, Captain Ramsey (James Donald), has a meeting with the German Kommandant who advises him to ensure that his men, who’ve a reputation for break-outs, stay put and stay alive. In this film, however, rather than self-risk being the way in which one does one’s duty, self-risk is one’s duty itself. As Ramsey explains to the Kommandant (Hannes Messemer), self-risk is the logical, the only, expression of soldierly obligation. To be a soldier is to keep resisting. The men imprisoned have no choice but to risk their lives trying to escape. Again, the narrative and thematic investment in self-endangerment – in the depiction of heroism, in the seeding of action and suspense – is writ large but, more than this, the contiguity between duty and self-abandon is exposed in its full force. In The Great Escape the contiguity is seamless – the two are, in fact, conflated – whereas, elsewhere, there is far more of a tension between them. Indeed, this tension is rife in the action film, and fraught with, while mediating, ‘life’s worth’: profundity indeed. This same conflation of duty and self-sacrifice occurs at the end of a more recent film, Black Hawk Down (Ridley Scott, 2001). In it, Hoot (Eric Bana), having refreshed himself briefly following the most traumatic of battles, heads straight back out to the front line stating to his incredulous but awestruck brother-in-arms: ‘that’s just what we do’. The nobility and paternalism on display in this extreme (overblown and thus more laughable than laudable) performance of heroism are consonant with the sensibility of The Great Escape, not least in conjuring the exceptional qualities of the United States/Allied forces: their selflessness as saintliness. The propagandist function and ‘soft power’ of the conflation of duty and selfsacrifice are clear. Though this ideological reserve is not simply about the United States, it is its primary domain. The fundamental attachment of national or humanistic duty to selfrisk, common to both The Great Escape and Black Hawk Down, also morphs into a more spectacularly, rather than sentimentally, gratuitous signature trope of the post-modern, high-gloss action movie. Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (Simon West, 2001), for example, opens with a typical scene of the protagonist embroiled in a death-defying encounter with an aggressive foe, here a robot. But Lara (Angelina Jolie) hasn’t simply invited or generated this situation, she has actually commissioned it. Having ‘killed’ the enemy machine, Lara flips open its control panel and we see that she\n\n34\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nhad it programmed to ‘Kill Lara Croft’. Physical, and frequently national, superiority is proven through the protagonist’s excessive proximity to death: excess which exceeds necessity. Nowhere are the framing and punctuation of the narrative by death-dealing episodes as gratuitous selfendangerment more elegantly or excessively rendered than in the James Bond series, from Terence Young’s Dr No in 1962 to the present day. To be Bond, and therefore On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (Peter R. Hunt, 1969), are not just to invite, suavely to flirt with, danger but to find oneself amid elaborate set pieces of imminent death. Bond films are studded with such scenes. Most memorable perhaps is Goldfinger (1964), in which 007 is strapped to a table, legs splayed, as a laser burns a slow but steady path between his thighs heading up towards his . . . torso. The sexual, even masochistic, implications of this spectacle are clear, but what we have here, again, is the mounting iconography of the action genre in its nascent form. Unlike the other protagonists mentioned, except perhaps Lara, Bond historically has lacked even shallow psychological causation for his maverick and self-risking behaviours: all is enacted in the line of duty. Both Bond’s and Lara’s acts represent a constant testing and proving of the characters’ extraordinary talents. Their imminent death scenes, their spectacular self-endangerment, are all surface. Visual pleasure is grounded firmly in the thrill of high-stakes action coupled with, or rather intensified by, the physical and erotic allure of these characters. If Maverick and Riggs recklessly self-risk out of grief, desolation or narcissism, Bond’s flirtation with death is, or at least was, without (need of) explanation. In later Bonds, especially Daniel Craig’s incarnation, this ceases to be the case: his derring-do is tinged with traumatic effect. Indeed, the current call and response of the Bourne and Bond franchises, find Bond, like his American partner, self-loathing, heart-broken and out of control.28 As this longstanding franchise trains itself again to the contemporary, it is the masculine and masculinist psychology of Hollywood heroism that gives it shape.29 It is important to note that Lara’s enduring lack, despite Jolie’s ample presence, finds her emblematic of heroines of old, of the very different story for girls. In her study of the action genre and gender, Yvonne Tasker traced the characteristics of North American films’ ‘fighting heroines’. She found that they possessed the caricatural sexualisation of comic book fantasies, were played for laughs in their novelty (especially within 1970s ‘Blaxploitation’) or, particularly in the late entry of the Hollywood action heroine in the mid-1980s, had their self-risk footnoted by maternal duty.30 Crucially, such women’s acts and breaks with male tradition were ‘explain[ed] away’, rather than explored psychologically or otherwise, and\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 35 another ‘common device has the heroine explicitly taking over her father’s role after his untimely death’.31 While Lara gets to save the world without reference to maternal instinct, she is still ‘doing it for daddy’ who disappeared many years earlier but inspires her actions directly and indirectly. Gloriously refreshing though her invincibility is, her mournful duty to his memory and his instruction propels the narrative just as her Barbarellan pose commands the gaze. Self-endangerment in mainstream cinema remains highly gendered. In all the films discussed above, heroism is being defined through the melding of duty and self-risk, and often in highly stylised terms. Always, however, there is reference to a more intimate, or psychic, flirtation with death which cannot help but complicate patriotic or personal responsibility even as it seeks to clarify it. Before we consider what those stylised qualities shore up, ideologically speaking, let us confront the issue of this complication, and begin to suggest why self-endangerment gets so muddied. A primary reason for the muddiness is that self-risk for its own sake – that is as charisma- but, especially, crisis-led recklessness for the individual alone rather than for anyone or anything else – is seen as antithetical to society and the social project. (This is not exactly the same as saying that suicide is taboo – which, of course, it is – for suicide is too limiting a term: its distinction will be discussed in the next chapter.) This selfish self-risk is the unthinkable and, of course, the undoable. But it is clearly not the unrepresentable in as much as I have found the action genre to depend upon its spectacular, emotive and narrative renderings. Its pervasive presence is harnessed, however, to offset and ultimately venerate dutiful selfrisk and with it other socio-cultural coordinates that are to be venerated too. ‘Selfish’ self-risk, then, is there to be firmly and familiarly rejected but must be entertained (and entertaining) to render the protagonist fallible but able to recover, human but always also exceptional. Let’s not forget, though, that selfish self-risk is also essential to the social project in broader terms: if there was no propensity for individuals to self-risk, even dutifully, out of ego-oriented reasons, then few would ever ‘serve’. In this way, the wall between the selflessness and egotism of self-risk is necessarily porous. We shall never know whether a soldier’s ultimate sacrifice was the product of depressed resignation (despite the medical diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), if the martyr has ‘his’ eye too firmly on the rapture of heaven, or if the suicide victim thinks only of the benefit to those left behind. What we do know is that we do not call the warrior altruistic, or associate suicide with heroism, for powerful and powerfully policed social reasons.\n\n36\n\nde at h and t he mo v i n g i m a g e\n\nAt the same time, the call to duty itself is not so simple. In our litigious, oil-led or info-saturated times, at least in the West, the purity of ‘causes’, even for the most military minded, has weakened. The new visibility of war demystifies its content and expands anti-war sentiment. Multiculturalism, meanwhile, messes with both the glory of God and the state, not least because it denies them their monology and their singularity. This is, of course, about now, and now is not all we are dealing with. Ridden with class and race issues historically, ‘signing up’ has always had its bitter pills, inner conflicts, and material advantages. Action film navigates these truisms: the everydayness and extraordinariness, appeal and danger, of its focalising men; their rampant individualism must be tamed in the service of both the self and of others. Clearly, what is at stake in these spectacles of self-endangerment is the vicarious thrill of confronting and surmounting certain death, and the pleasure of both watching suffering and watching it ease. It is a journey of heightened alignment with the self-endangering character to resolution which, as I’ve suggested, recovers the excesses of self-endangerment for the sake of defining heroism while also restoring the status quo: the raison d’être of the Hollywood machine. While I have stressed the universal and structural qualities of the narratives, the self that is endangering has certain specifications and so we come back to mainstream films’ favourite subject: the white ‘American’ male. This cliché and this mantra of mainstream Western identity depend upon the interdependence of its three parts. In this chapter’s closing pages I want to return to how self-endangerment in mainstream film bestows, and entrenches, individuals’ value along racial, national and gendered lines. The United States has long celebrated its independent spirits. Both the self-made man of the American dream, and the self-ruled pioneer of the great journey west, are characterised by their non-conformity as well as their bravery. The Hollywood action film, like the western before it, venerates this maverick sensibility. Its rule-breaking loners epitomise Americanness but they also render recklessness sexually alluring. Where in Top Gun sexual and professional prowess converge early on as the alpha-male fighter pilot proves his potency both in the cockpit and in his cocky wooing of Charlie, in Lethal Weapon things don’t come to a head quite so soon or so superficially. Indeed, Gibson’s sex-symbol status is purely part of an external economy, for spectators, rather than an internal one, at least in the first film. After the soft-core aesthetic of the opening ‘suicide’ scene, Riggs is immediately sexually objectified.32 Crossing his trailer naked, we’re introduced to our protagonist through the infamous ‘butt shot’. Unlike Maverick, no live romance will footnote Riggs’s self-\n\n­\n\nself-en da nge r me nt a nd t he s ub j e c t o f f i l m 37 assurance in this film, though the nuclear values of heterosexuality and home underpin the Lethal Weapon series nevertheless, as they did the late 1980s action film.33 Rather than celebrating masochism, say, or any illicit sexuality, the sexiness of the self-endangerer in mainstream cinema exalts the American hero and the conservatism of his recovery. His eroticisation gains this emphasis as we move towards Chapter 2 which will show how different things are for women, as does his recovery as the non-white, nonAmerican self-endangerer is shown"
