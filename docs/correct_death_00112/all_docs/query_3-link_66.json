        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was a native of Portland, Maine, where his father was a lawyer. He had a happy, sheltered childhood, and at the age of fifteen went to Bowdoin, where he entered the sophomore class and was Hawthorne’s classmate. Just at the time he graduated, it was decided to add a professor of modern languages to the faculty at Bowdoin. The professorship was offered to Longfellow. In 1826 he went to Europe to prepare himself by three years of study, which he spent chiefly in France, Italy and Spain. He taught so successfully at Bowdoin that in 1835 he was called to Harvard, and from that time we associate him with Harvard and Cambridge.\n\nBefore he settled down at Harvard he spent a year in Germany, and in 1836 took up his new work. His wife had died while they were in Europe but in 1841 he married again and led a happy home life in the old Craigie Mansion, almost under the shade of the Washington Elm. As years went on he became more and more famous as a poet, and finally gave up teaching altogether in order to devote himself to writing poetry and translating poems from other languages….\n\n“The Children’s Hour” shows us how he loved children, and he was loved by them in return. In fact, he was called the Children’s Poet, and toward the end of his life children presented him with a great chair made from the wood of the chestnut tree under which the “village smithy” stood. He lived to the age of seventy-five and died in March, 1882, as gently as he had lived….\n\nLove was the motive of his life and showed through all his verse. He wrote of the homely, everyday things of life, and turned them into poetry.\n\n“American Literature,” The Book of Knowledge"
