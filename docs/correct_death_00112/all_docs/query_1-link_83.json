        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 19th Century American Poet\n\n5th Cousin, six times removed\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow was born in 1807 in Portland, Maine and died March 24, 1882 in Cambridge, Mass. Longfellow graduated from Bowdoin College and traveled in Europe before joining the modern-language faculty at Bowdoin (1829 – 35) and then at Harvard (1836 – 54). His Voices of the Night (1839), containing \"The Psalm of Life\" and \"The Light of the Stars,\" first won him popularity. Ballads and Other Poems (1841), including \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" and \"The Village Blacksmith,\" swept the nation, as did his long poem Evangeline (1847). With Hiawatha (1855), The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858) and Tales of a Wayside Inn (1863), including \"Paul Revere's Ride,\" he became the best-loved American poet of the 19th century. The hallmarks of his verse are gentleness, simplicity, and an idealized vision of the world (from Britannica Concise Encyclopedia online).\n\nAmericans owe a great debt to Longfellow because he was among the first of American writers to use native themes. He wrote about the American scene and landscape, the American Indian ('Song of Hiawatha'), and American history and tradition ('The Courtship of Miles Standish', 'Evangeline'). At the beginning of the 19th century, America was a stumbling babe as far as a culture of its own was concerned. The people of America had spent their years and their energies in carving a habitation out of the wilderness and in fighting for independence. Literature, art, and music came mainly from Europe and especially from England. Nothing was considered worthy of attention unless it came from Europe. (This paragraph and following is from a biographical sketch by Roberto Rabe, on the Auburn University website.)\n\nBut \"the flowering of New England,\" as Van Wyck Brooks terms the period from 1815 to 1865, took place in Longfellow's day, and he made a great contribution to it. Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Oliver Wendell Holmes and William Prescott were a few of the great minds and spirits among whom Longfellow took his place. Among the ancestors of the poet on his mother's side were John and Priscilla Alden, of whom he wrote in 'The Courtship of Miles Standish'. His mother's father, Peleg Wadsworth, had been a general in the Revolutionary War.\n\nHenry was the son of Stephen Longfellow and Zilpah Wadsworth Longfellow. He was born February 27, 1807, in Portland, Maine. The variety of people and the activity of the harbors stirred the mind of the boy and gave him a curiosity about life beyond his own immediate experience. He was sent to school when he was only three years old. \"Every reader has his first book,\" wrote Longfellow later. \"I mean to say, one book among all others which in early youth first fascinates his imagination, and at once excites and satisfies the desires of his mind. To me, the first book was the 'Sketch Book' of Washington Irving.\"\n\nWhen Henry was a senior at Bowdoin College at age 19, the college established a chair of modern languages. The recent graduate was asked to become the first professor, with the understanding that he should be given a period of time in which to travel and study in Europe. Beginning in 1826, he travelled in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and England, and returned to America in 1829. At 22, he was launched into his career as a college professor. Between conferences with important people and courses in the universities, Longfellow walked through the countries.\n\nThis portrait was painted by Charles Loring Elliott, American artist from 1812-1868, oil on canvas painted circa 1842-1846; in the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nIn 1831, he married Mary Storer Potter, whom he had known as a schoolmate. When he saw her at church upon his return to Portland, he was so struck by her beauty that he followed her home without courage enough to speak to her. With his wife, he settled down in a house surrounded by elm trees. In 1834, he was appointed to a professorship at Harvard and once more set out for Europe by way of preparation. This time his young wife accompanied him but the journey ended in tragedy as his wife died. Longfellow came alone to Cambridge and the new professorship. The lonely Longfellow took a room at historic Craigie House, an old house overlooking the Charles River. It was owned by Mrs. Craigie, an eccentric woman who kept much to herself and was somewhat scornful of the young men to whom she let rooms. Longfellow entered the beautiful old elm-encircled house as a lodger, not knowing that this was to be his home for the rest of his life. In time, it passed into the possession of Nathan Appleton. Seven years after he came to Cambridge, Longfellow married Frances Appleton, daughter of Nathan Appleton, and Craigie House was given to the Longfellows as a wedding gift.\n\nLongfellow National Historic Site preserves the home of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the world’s foremost 19th century poets. The house also served as headquarters for General George Washington during the Siege of Boston from July 1775 - April 1776. In addition to its rich history, the site offers unique opportunities to explore the themes of 19th century literature and the arts.\n\nThe marriage was a happy one, and the Longfellow house became the center of life in the University town. The old Craigie House was a shrine of hospitality and gracious living. The young people of Cambridge flocked there to play with the five Longfellow children - two boys and the three girls whom the poet describes in 'The Children's Hour' as \"grave Alice and laughing Allegra and Edith with golden hair.\"\n\nIn June of 1854, he began 'The Song of Hiawatha'. Henry Schoolcraft's book on Indians and several meetings with an Ojibway chief provided the background for 'Hiawatha'. The long poem begins with Gitche Matino, the Great Spirit, commanding his people to live in peace and tells how Hiawatha is born. It ends with the coming of the white man and Hiawatha's death. The publication of 'Hiawatha' caused the greatest excitement. For the first time in American literature, Indian themes gained recognition as sources of imagination, power, and originality. The appeal of 'Hiawatha' for generations of children and young people gives it an enduring place in world literature.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow with his wife, Frances \"Fanny\" Elizabeth Appleton and two of their five children, Charles and Ernest, ca. 1849.

In 1861, the happy life of the family came to an end. Longfellow's wife died of burns she received when packages of her children's curls, which she was sealing with matches and wax, burst into flame. Longfellow faced the bitterest tragedy of his life and went to Europe for a change of scene. When it became necessary to remove \"the spreading chestnut tree\" of Brattle Street, which Longfellow had written about in his 'Village Blacksmith', the children of Cambridge gave their pennies to build a chair out of the tree and gave it to Longfellow. He died on March 24, 1882.\n\nThe Village Blacksmith (1842)\n\nBy Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nUnder a spreading chestnut-tree\n\nThe village smithy stands;\n\nThe smith, a mighty man is he,\n\nWith large and sinewy hands;\n\nAnd the muscles of his brawny arms\n\nAre strong as iron bands.\n\nHis hair is crisp, and black, and long,\n\nHis face is like the tan;\n\nHis brow is wet with honest sweat,\n\nHe earns whate'er he can,\n\nAnd looks the whole world in the face,\n\nFor he owes not any man.\n\nWeek in, week out, from morn till night,\n\nYou can hear his bellows blow;\n\nYou can hear him swing his heavy sledge,\n\nWith measured beat and slow,\n\nLike a sexton ringing the village bell,\n\nWhen the evening sun is low.\n\nAnd children coming home from school\n\nLook in at the open door;\n\nThey love to see the flaming forge,\n\nAnd hear the bellows roar,\n\nAnd catch the burning sparks that fly\n\nLike chaff from a threshing-floor.\n\nHe goes on Sunday to the church,\n\nAnd sits among his boys;\n\nHe hears the parson pray and preach,\n\nHe hears his daughter's voice,\n\nSinging in the village choir,\n\nAnd it makes his heart rejoice.\n\nIt sounds to him like her mother's voice,\n\nSinging in Paradise!\n\nHe needs must think of her once more,\n\nHow in the grave she lies;\n\nAnd with his haul, rough hand he wipes\n\nA tear out of his eyes.\n\nToiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing,\n\nOnward through life he goes;\n\nEach morning sees some task begin,\n\nEach evening sees it close\n\nSomething attempted, something done,\n\nHas earned a night's repose.\n\nThanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,\n\nFor the lesson thou hast taught!\n\nThus at the flaming forge of life\n\nOur fortunes must be wrought;\n\nThus on its sounding anvil shaped\n\nEach burning deed and thought.\n\nThis Longfellow poem was a favorite of Richard Bissell.\n\nA PSALM OF LIFE\n\nWHAT THE HEART OF THE YOUNG MAN\n\nSAID TO THE PSALMIST\n\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\n\nLife is but an empty dream ! —\n\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers,\n\nAnd things are not what they seem.\n\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\n\nAnd the grave is not its goal;\n\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\n\nWas not spoken of the soul.\n\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\n\nIs our destined end or way;\n\nBut to act, that each to-morrow\n\nFind us farther than to-day.\n\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting,\n\nAnd our hearts, though stout and brave,\n\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating\n\nFuneral marches to the grave.\n\nIn the world's broad field of battle,\n\nIn the bivouac of Life,\n\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle!\n\nBe a hero in the strife!\n\nTrust no Future, howe'er pleasant!\n\nLet the dead Past bury its dead!\n\nAct,— act in the living Present!\n\nHeart within, and God o'erhead!\n\nLives of great men all remind us\n\nWe can make our lives sublime,\n\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\n\nFootprints on the sands of time;\n\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\n\nSailing o'er life's solemn main,\n\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\n\nSeeing, shall take heart again.\n\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\n\nWith a heart for any fate;\n\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\n\nLearn to labor and to wait.\n\nThe above poem was first published in the Knickerbocker Magazine in October 1838. It also appeared in Longfellow's first published collection Voices in the Night.\n\nI'm a paragraph. Click here to add your own text and edit me.
