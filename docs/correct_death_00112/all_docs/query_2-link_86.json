        "text": "If you went to elementary school in the United States, you may have read Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's rousing poem, \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.\"\n\nThe poem, published in 1863 in Tales of a Wayside Inn, recounts the adventures of Boston's best-known Patriot.\n\nOne slight problem with the poem: it's not particularly accurate.\n\nBut what actually happened during Revere's famous ride across the countryside is more interesting and gives a lot more insight into his character.\n\nKeep reading to find out what really happened during that famous ride almost 250 years ago.\n\nTop photo: Statue of Paul Revere on horseback in his old neighborhood, Boston's North End\n\nBoston Discovery Guide is a reader-supported publication.

Learn more\n\nWhat Really Happened during Paul Revere's Ride?\n\nThe purpose of Paul Revere's midnight ride, as you may recall from your high school history class, was to race to Concord to warn Patriots Samuel Adams and John Hancock that British troops - 700 of them - were marching to Concord to arrest them.\n\nTrue, warning Adams and Hancock triggered Revere's ride from Boston.\n\nBut unknown to the British, Adams and Hancock were staying at the home of minister Jonas Clarke in Lexington, so Lexington, not Concord, was Revere's initial destination.\n\nRevere's ride marked the culmination of months of secret eavesdropping by Revere and fellow Sons of Liberty as British soldiers refreshed themselves in Boston taverns such as the Green Dragon, which you can still visit today.\n\nRevere's spying supported a larger resistance network (read more about it here); he also routinely carried news and information to other Patriots, so in that context, his ride to Lexington was nothing unusual.\n\nAs Longfellow's poem recounts, Revere slipped out of his home in Boston's North End, rowed across Back Bay (roughly where Boston Common meets Charles Street today) past the British frigate H.M.S. Somerset, and rode on horseback to Mystic Village (present day Medford).\n\nWant to see a reenactment of Paul Revere's ride? Check the Patriots Day Events schedule\n\nDid Longfellow Forget the Other Riders?\n\nIn his famous poem, Longfellow doesn't mention that William Dawes, a second alert-raiser who'd taken a land route out of Boston, joined Revere at Mystic Village (present day Medford) and they rode together to Lexington.\n\nRevere and Dawes reached the Clarke home in Lexington around midnight and delivered their warning.\n\nSuspicious as to why a such a large force of British Regulars would be needed to arrest Adams and Hancock, they realized the real target must be stores of munitions hidden by the Colonists in Concord, a few miles to the west.\n\nRevere and Dawes jumped back on their horses and headed to Concord - but Longfellow also fails to mention that Dr. Samuel Prescott also joined them along the way.\n\nDr. Prescott, a Concord local, had been visiting his girlfriend. When Revere and Dawes sounded the alert, Prescott jumped out the back window of his girlfriend's house and joined them.\n\nThe three men decided to ride toward Concord and stop at every house along the way to warn the residents about the British movements.\n\nFind out how Patriots Day commemorates these events\n\nDid Longfellow Forget Paul Revere Got Captured?\n\nLongfellow also doesn't mention in \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere\" that British troops captured all three men at a site near present-day Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford. Does he somehow forget this detail?\n\nOf course, like many poets writing about historic events, Longfellow takes some liberties in \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.\"\n\nSoon after Revere, Dawes, and Prescott crossed from Lexington into Lincoln, where today Route 2 runs past the Minuteman National History Park next to Hanscom Air Force Base, Revere ran right into a British ambush by two soldiers. He called to his friends for help - and they got captured too.\n\nAfter being taken at gunpoint by the British to a nearby field, Prescott escaped by riding into the woods. Revere tried to escape by riding in the opposite direction, which allowed Dawes to also escape while the Redcoats chased Revere.\n\nAlthough the British recaptured Revere, he told them the whole countryside knew of their advance and was taking up arms.\n\nHearing this, they released him and rode off to warn the advancing troops - but they were too late.\n\nColonial resistance caught the Redcoats by surprise as they approached Concord.\n\nOnce the Redcoats realized they were outnumbered, they had to fight their way back to Boston in a running retreat in what became the bloodiest battle of the day when they reached the small village of Menotomy (now Arlington).\n\nAs group after group of angry Colonists attacked the retreating Redcoats during this first day of the War for Independence, their thirst for freedom from British rule took hold.\n\nTours through Boston's History\n\nWhat Else Did Longfellow Get Wrong?\n\nThere's even some debate among historians and scholars about exactly which North Church in Boston's North End neighborhood had the two lanterns hung from it.\n\nHowever, Longfellow does get the details right in other parts of \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.\"\n\nHe accurately recounts the fierce fighting by local militias and farmers along the way - including women and older men such as Samuel Whittemore, another American Revolutionary War hero.\n\nAnd there's also no doubt that \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere\" is a rousing poem, and that Revere, who went on to have an illustrious career as a silversmith and businessman, is a genuine American hero.\n\nEven though \"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere\" highlights the bravery of only one particular person, it captures the spirit of determination that enabled the colonists to win the Revolutionary War.\n\n\"The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere\" is now in the public domain (meaning that it isn't protected by copyright) so we include it below for your reading pleasure.\n\nYou can also visit Paul Revere's house in Boston's North End. Aside from its historical connections with one of the great Sons of Liberty, it's also typical of the style of late Elizabethan houses that once filled the city but have now all but disappeared.\n\nMore to see and explore in Boston's North End\n\nThe Midnight Ride of Paul Revere\n\nBy Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nListen my children and you shall hear\n\nOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\n\nOn the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;\n\nHardly a man is now alive\n\nWho remembers that famous day and year.\n\nHe said to his friend, \"If the British march\n\nBy land or sea from the town to-night,\n\nHang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch\n\nOf the North Church tower as a signal light,--\n\nOne if by land, and two if by sea;\n\nAnd I on the opposite shore will be,\n\nReady to ride and spread the alarm\n\nThrough every Middlesex village and farm,\n\nFor the country folk to be up and to arm.\"\n\nThen he said \"Good-night!\" and with muffled oar\n\nSilently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\n\nJust as the moon rose over the bay,\n\nWhere swinging wide at her moorings lay\n\nThe Somerset, British man-of-war;\n\nA phantom ship, with each mast and spar\n\nAcross the moon like a prison bar,\n\nAnd a huge black hulk, that was magnified\n\nBy its own reflection in the tide.\n\nMeanwhile, his friend through alley and street\n\nWanders and watches, with eager ears,\n\nTill in the silence around him he hears\n\nThe muster of men at the barrack door,\n\nThe sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\n\nAnd the measured tread of the grenadiers,\n\nMarching down to their boats on the shore.\n\nThen he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,\n\nBy the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\n\nTo the belfry chamber overhead,\n\nAnd startled the pigeons from their perch\n\nOn the sombre rafters, that round him made\n\nMasses and moving shapes of shade,--\n\nBy the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\n\nTo the highest window in the wall,\n\nWhere he paused to listen and look down\n\nA moment on the roofs of the town\n\nAnd the moonlight flowing over all.\n\nBeneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,\n\nIn their night encampment on the hill,\n\nWrapped in silence so deep and still\n\nThat he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,\n\nThe watchful night-wind, as it went\n\nCreeping along from tent to tent,\n\nAnd seeming to whisper, \"All is well!\"\n\nA moment only he feels the spell\n\nOf the place and the hour, and the secret dread\n\nOf the lonely belfry and the dead;\n\nFor suddenly all his thoughts are bent\n\nOn a shadowy something far away,\n\nWhere the river widens to meet the bay,--\n\nA line of black that bends and floats\n\nOn the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\n\nMeanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\n\nBooted and spurred, with a heavy stride\n\nOn the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\n\nNow he patted his horse's side,\n\nNow he gazed at the landscape far and near,\n\nThen, impetuous, stamped the earth,\n\nAnd turned and tightened his saddle girth;\n\nBut mostly he watched with eager search\n\nThe belfry tower of the Old North Church,\n\nAs it rose above the graves on the hill,\n\nLonely and spectral and sombre and still.\n\nAnd lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height\n\nA glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\n\nHe springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\n\nBut lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\n\nA second lamp in the belfry burns.\n\nA hurry of hoofs in a village street,\n\nA shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\n\nAnd beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark\n\nStruck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;\n\nThat was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,\n\nThe fate of a nation was riding that night;\n\nAnd the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\n\nKindled the land into flame with its heat.\n\nHe has left the village and mounted the steep,\n\nAnd beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\n\nIs the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\n\nAnd under the alders that skirt its edge,\n\nNow soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\n\nIs heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\n\nIt was twelve by the village clock\n\nWhen he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\n\nHe heard the crowing of the cock,\n\nAnd the barking of the farmer's dog,\n\nAnd felt the damp of the river fog,\n\nThat rises after the sun goes down.\n\nIt was one by the village clock,\n\nWhen he galloped into Lexington.\n\nHe saw the gilded weathercock\n\nSwim in the moonlight as he passed,\n\nAnd the meeting-house windows, black and bare,\n\nGaze at him with a spectral glare,\n\nAs if they already stood aghast\n\nAt the bloody work they would look upon.\n\nIt was two by the village clock,\n\nWhen he came to the bridge in Concord town.\n\nHe heard the bleating of the flock,\n\nAnd the twitter of birds among the trees,\n\nAnd felt the breath of the morning breeze\n\nBlowing over the meadow brown.\n\nAnd one was safe and asleep in his bed\n\nWho at the bridge would be first to fall,\n\nWho that day would be lying dead,\n\nPierced by a British musket ball.\n\nYou know the rest. In the books you have read\n\nHow the British Regulars fired and fled,---\n\nHow the farmers gave them ball for ball,\n\nFrom behind each fence and farmyard wall,\n\nChasing the redcoats down the lane,\n\nThen crossing the fields to emerge again\n\nUnder the trees at the turn of the road,\n\nAnd only pausing to fire and load.\n\nSo through the night rode Paul Revere;\n\nAnd so through the night went his cry of alarm\n\nTo every Middlesex village and farm,---\n\nA cry of defiance, and not of fear,\n\nA voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,\n\nAnd a word that shall echo for evermore!\n\nFor, borne on the night-wind of the Past,\n\nThrough all our history, to the last,\n\nIn the hour of darkness and peril and need,\n\nThe people will waken and listen to hear\n\nThe hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,\n\nAnd the midnight message of Paul Revere.\n\nWhere to Stay in Boston's North End\n\nInterested in staying in or near Boston's wonderful North End neighborhood, filled with tantalizing Italian restaurants and bakeries?\n\nConsider these welcoming choices:\n\nBricco Suites\n\nBattery Wharf Hotel\n\nMarriott Long Wharf\n\nBoston Yacht Haven\n\nFind more hotels in or near the North End"
