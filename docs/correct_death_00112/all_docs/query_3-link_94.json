        "text": "Mad River, published in The Atlantic Monthly for May, was the last poem that we received directly from Mr. Longfellow’s hand. Shortly after his death several unprinted poems were found among his papers. Two of these lyrics were placed at our disposal. The first, Decoration Day, appeared in the June number of this magazine; the second, to which a sad interest attaches itself as being the last verse he penned, is now laid before the reader. The manuscript bears the date of March 15, 1882.\n\nWhat say the bells of San Blas\n\nTo the ships that southward pass\n\nFrom the harbor of Mazatlan?\n\nTo them it is nothing more\n\nThan the sound of surf on the shore, —\n\nNothing more to master or man.\n\nBut to me, a dreamer of dreams,\n\nTo whom what is and what seems\n\nAre often one and the same, —\n\nThe Bells of San Blas to me\n\nHave a strange, wild melody,\n\nAnd are something more than a name.\n\nFor bells are the voice of the church;\n\nThey have tones that touch and search\n\nThe hearts of young and old;\n\nOne sound to all, yet each\n\nLends a meaning to their speech,\n\nAnd the meaning is manifold.\n\nThey are a voice of the Past,\n\nOf an age that is fading fast,\n\nOf a power austere and grand,\n\nWhen the flag of Spain unfurled\n\nIts folds o’er this western world,\n\nAnd the Priest was lord of the land.\n\nThe chapel that once looked down\n\nOn the little seaport town\n\nHas crumbled into the dust;\n\nAnd on oaken beams below\n\nThe bells swing to and fro,\n\nAnd are green with mould and rust.\n\n“Is, then, the old faith dead,”\n\nThey say, “and in its stead\n\nIs some new faith proclaimed,\n\nThat we are forced to remain\n\nNaked to sun and rain,\n\nUnsheltered and ashamed?\n\n“Once, in our tower aloof,\n\nWe rang over wall and roof\n\nOur warnings and our complaints;\n\nAnd round about us there\n\nThe white doves filled the air,\n\nLike the white souls of the saints.\n\n“The saints! Ah, have they grown\n\nForgetful of their own?\n\nAre they asleep, or dead,\n\nThat open to the sky\n\nTheir ruined Missions lie,\n\nNo longer tenanted?\n\n“Oh, bring us back once more\n\nThe vanished days of yore,\n\nWhen the world with faith was filled;\n\nBring back the fervid zeal,\n\nThe hearts of fire and steel,\n\nThe hands that believe and build.\n\n“Then from our tower again\n\nWe will send over land and main\n\nOur voices of command,\n\nLike exiled kings who return\n\nTo their thrones, and the people learn\n\nThat the Priest is lord of the land!”"
