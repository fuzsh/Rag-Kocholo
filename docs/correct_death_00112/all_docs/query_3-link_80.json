        "text": "1842 Â· WebsterâAshburton Treaty\n\nThe Webster-Ashburton Treaty was signed on August 9, 1842 and resolved the border issues between the United States and British North American colonies which had caused the Aroostook War. The treaty contained several agreements and concessions. It called for an end on the overseas slave trade and proposed that both parties share the Great Lakes. It also reaffirmed the location of the westward frontier border (near the Rocky Mountains) as well as the border between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods. The treaty was signed by Daniel Webster (United States Secretary of State) and Alexander Baring (British Diplomat, 1st Baron Ashburton).\n\n1851 Â· First State to Attempt Prohibition\n\n\"In 1851, Maine outlawed the sale of alcohol, allowing exceptions only for \"\"medicinal, mechanical, and manufacturing purposes\"\". This made Maine the first state to experiment with prohibition. Neal Dow, mayor of Portland, believed that alcohol was linked to slavery and was also convinced by the Christian temperance movement. Dow ran into problems later for his anti-immigration rhetoric against the Irish, and also for breaking his own prohibition laws; although not a designated \"\"purchaser\"\", Dow personally purchased alcohol to distribute to local doctors, violating a technicality. As the citizens turned against him, Dow eventually ordered soldiers to fire on protesters. This marked a sharp decline in Dow's political career, and the Maine Law was repealed by 1856. Aspects of the law would remain in tact, however, and ultimately paved the way for the 18th Amendment, which prohibited alcohol on the national level.\""
