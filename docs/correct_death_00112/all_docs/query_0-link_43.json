Your most worthy father heard no less than 5 sermons that day!!! Kind o' sort o' professionally - as I suppose. Next morning when I saw them again Taz had written a note to yr. mother - I do not know whether it contained an epistle for you. However yr mother very kindly asked me whether you had had a note fr. Taz. before I left Gravesend and so I said I did not know of it - if you had. Then she said she thought she might show it to me as it concerned me as much as you - Your father came out and put a stop to it - whispering something to yr. mother and so I was not allowed to hear the contents of the epistle & was left in a great state of excitement.

(But they all the answer I could get them was that they new she was so & - struck out) But they pleased to enjoy my astonishment and would not tell me then. So of course I immediately concluded that T. Fenn had managed at length to find it out - perhaps Susan had let it out to him and that he had as usual propagated it.

Edward Liveing: Letter while travelling in Europe, 12 Jun 1853, Rhine Germany.\n\nLiveing Archive Image 3c-e-f\n\nFrankfurt . Sunday Even. June 12, 1853. My dear Mother, I think I had better write you some account of our journeyings thus far as you may be wishing to hear of us and I shall not have so good an opportunity of writing again for some time. After a hard days work on Tuesday last we managed to get on board the steamer at St Katharine's Wharf in the evening just in time to secure two berths for ourselves there were a great many passengers so that all the berths were taken and many had to sleep on the floor and on deck we had a very comfortable passage to Ostend, there was only a slight roll and we were neither of us at all sick - Uncle Charles got us a letter of introduction from someone in the N.D.O. to his brother in law at Ostend a M Wallis who was extremely kind and hospitable and made us dine and spend the rest of the day at his house - We slept at one of the hotels and set off early the next morning for Cologne by railway, a very long tedious journey which occupied the whole day - we met many English people on the way who were glad to talk - The natives also were everywhere very communicative and seem to delight in speaking English however little they know, and as far as we have gone at present most of them seem to know a little at the Railway Stations, Hotels etc - At the Railway Station at Verriers we were much amused by a small boy calling out \"London News, Punch, Bradshaws guide\" and on being told by another Englishman that the Punch was an old one he said \"good for all the summer\" which speach he had evidently got up by heart but was originally intended only for Bradshaw - At Aix la Chapelle we had to have our passports vise when calling out the names that we might reclaim our passports they read our names as M ?Swaingen & I happened to see the passport was mine and it was quite impossible to help bursting out laughing which highly offended the \"Maitre de Bureau\" & he would not let us have ours in consequence till all the others were served. We got to Cologne in the evening and took up our abode at the Belle Vue Hotel where we fell in with an Oxford undergraduate who was all alone & also going to Switzerland and seemed heartily glad of our company. He left us however this morning to join a party of Relatives at Baden. On Friday morning we looked about Cologne and of course I was very much delighted with the cathedral which they still continue vigorously building - I wonder whether it will ever be finished! We had not curiosity enough to see the bones of the 3 Maji as they charge a very high price for showing them. We found out St Peter's Church also where Rubens was christened and which contains a large picture by him St Peter crucified with his head downwards - a wonderful subject & wonderfully painted I think in spite of the faults generally found with it - Why in the world they keep the picture turned with its face towards the wall while a wretched copy on the back is generally only seen I cannot imagine. About 1 o'clock we set off by steamer up the Rhine and had my first \"Table d'hote\" dinner on deck at species of meal which I like very much but which is certainly better calculated to suit one's Taste than Stomach - At dinner we made acquaintance with a clergyman (English) and his sister who were also going to Coblenz.\n\nPage: 2\n\nThe banks of the River are certainly flat and tame until you have passed Bonn and there commences with the Seven Hills the beautiful scenery - \"The castled crag of Drachenfels Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine, Whose breast of waters broadly swells Between the banks which bare the vine, And hills all rich with blossom'd trees, And fields which promise corn and wine, And scattered cities crowning these, Whose far white walls along them shine\" etc. etc. Childe Harrold.\n\nI have just finished reading one of Sir Walter Scott's stories in which he gives a much better description of this than I can: \"the broad stream itself hurrying forward, with dizzy rapidity, and rushing around the Islets by which its course is interrupted is one of the most majestic spectacles in nature\" (?) \"The old castles seen from time to time on the banks of the river itself, or in the ravines and larger brook's which flow into it are picturesque ruins rendered interesting by the stories told about their former inhabitants\" & \" every stream which here contributes its waters to the Rhine, winds through its own tributary dell, and each valley presents a varying and separate character, some rich with pastures, cornfields & vineyards, some frowning with crags and precipices and others romantic beauties\" That it is \"one of the most majestic spectacles in nature\" however I should think very doubtful and if I do not see something more deserving of such a character in Switzerland I shall certainly be disappointed - We got to Coblenz by the evening and here took up our abode for the night - & got up early the next (yesterday) morning and climbed the stupendous rock of Ebrenbreitstein which is just opposite Coblenz and wonderfully fortified and from the top of which we had the most splendid panoramic view of the Rhine country; I wished I had time to stop & sketch we then went back to the hotel to breakfast and went on by steamer all day to Mayence Fr. thence we arrived here yesterday evening by railroad. Here we have spent the day as we found an English church after some searching and tomorrow morning we set off for Heidelberg - I hope I am already somewhat better for the thorough change though I am far from square yet - Bob is flourishing & I shall be glad to hear if Anna or someone will write to me - Best Love to all fr. your ever affect. son Edward.\n\nLetter on three sides of a large folded sheet addressed to Mrs Liveing Stoke by Neyland Suffolk Angleterre the address sheet is stamped Machmittag with several postmarks including Schaffhausen 15 6, Suisse St Louis 17 Juin, L 18 Jui 8 1853, Colchester Jun 18 1853 A.

June 18th 1853.\n\nMy dear Mother, Since I last wrote from Frankfurt we have had little else but misfortune & disappointment chiefly owing to the wretched wet weather - I have nothing therefore to tell you except what route we have come and where we are going to which cannot interest you as you do not know the country. We left Frankfurt on Monday morning and had a long railway journey by Heidelberg to Kehl we could not stop at Heidelberg as we wanted to get on that night to Offenburg - we stayed at Kehl and walked to Strasb urg and examined the cathedral which of course much delighted us the painted glass windows and the carving of the stonework being very far superior to any thing of ? ye. kind I had seen before - we got to Offenburg late in the evening and went to a Mr Pfachler's hotel, he is a friend of Mr Eddison's, and was stopping in London so that we did not see him but his son speaks English very well and was very kind and obliging and promised us 20 miles range of shooting! Roebuck, hares, pheasant s etc when ever we liked to come - on Tuesday we went by railroad to Freibourg and stayed there an hour which just gave us time to look at the church (Minster) which is very fine and very perfect and has much of the character of Strasbourg Cathedral, so that you would imagine the same architect built them both - we then went on by diligence (a four wheeled stage coach) up the Hollentha l and through a part of the Black Forest & along its outskirts to Schaffhausen - the first part of this journey was through a most beautiful country, but it began to rain when we started and we could see absolutely almost nothing the whole way - we reached Schaffhausen about two o'clock on Wednesday morning and had some trouble in finding out the hotel we wanted to go to as it was quite dark & no one about the streets - we went to see the falls of the Rhine early but there was no sunshine so that we did not see them to advantage - and then went on by diligence to Zurich but it was cloudy and wet so that we could see but little moreover they would not let us ride outside the diligence. We slept at Zurich and started at half past eight on Thursday morning for Ragatz it was tolerably fine though cloudy and we enjoyed the scenery on the lakes of Zurich and Wallenstadt very much and especially the journey from Wallenstadt to Ragatz by diligence but it was too cloudy to see the distant mountains - we slept at Ragatz (where we now are) on Thursday night and procured a guide to go with us the next day over the mountains to Glarus - as Uncle Charles directed us along that route - it poured with rain when we started and it has continued to rain almost incessantly ever since - we walked up the gorge of the Tamina and saw the hot baths and spring of Pfeffers (pictured) and then continued our route on to Vattis a little village at the entrance of a \" Kalfeuser Thal \" notwithstanding the wet we (sic) it was impossible\n\nPage 2\n\nnot to admire the gorge of the river Tamina certainly one of the most extraordinary spots imaginable - being quite wet through we had about four hours walk in the rain and clouds to the little village of Vattis amongst most magnificent scenery of which in consequence of the wet and cloud we could just see only so much as to let us know that it existed and was very magnificent if we could only see it. It was too late to cross the mountains then and there & so we were obliged to put up at a miserable little Inn in the place and were glad to change our wet clothes. The guide had a long discussion with the natives in the evening & they finally concluded that it was utterly impossible for us to pass up the Kalfeuser Thal and cross over the mountains (at the end of it towards Glarus) for the snow was still so deep that no one had yet been able to pass since the winter and some of the natives who had tried the day before were obliged to give it up & come back this was an extremely annoying piece of news as we had come 4 hours walk in the wet for nothing and it involved our undergoing the same journey back again to Ragatz as we were hemmed in by the mountains & that was the only way out which would suit us at all - in addition to this our plan of route was frustrated (the most annoying part of the whole) and we have lost in this way 2 days at least. I thought the guide did not like the trouble of going and therefore tried to persuade us into the idea that we could not but he stuck to it so resolutely that we should be obliged to turn back again if we attempted it that we thought we had better give it up lest we should lose another 2 days - I cannot tell now for certain that we have not been cheated, and as we know nothing of the Language it is very difficult to find out. I made the guide write his French speeches when I could not exactly understand them; the following is a specimen Remarkable for spelling \"S'il est possibel de pouvoir passe r acose la naiche (neige?) nous vero n s demain da n s l alpe. Mais s'il y a de n aa ges (?) sur les montains il est impossible de passer, il y a trop de danger\"\n\nPage 3\n\nWe accordingly walked back again this morning in pouring rain and dense clouds - we have changed our clothes again and had some table D' h ote Dinner and are going by the diligence to Glarus this afternoon and we hope to walk on to Schwytz tomorrow & from there to Arth & up the Rigi (Rhigi) the next day. We have seen so little at present and have been so disappointed that we are quite out of spirits - it is rather better weather this afternoon & I hope it will continue to improve otherwise we might just as well walk in our own valley of the Stour in England in a dense fog - we are both very well considering - but rather afflicted with blisters. Ever your affectionate son Edward.

Edward Liveing: Letter while travelling in Europe, 26 Jun 1853, Furka Pass Switzerland.\n\nLiveing Archive Image 2c-d-e-f\n\nInn on the Furka Pass June 26, 1853. My dear mother, We have had little else but a continuance of the same wretched weather since I last wrote to you from Ragatz . As soon as I had finished my epistle the weather having cleared up a little we've found our way back again by diligence and Steamboat to Weseu about 10 miles from Glarus w h ither we had intended to go - there was a fine sunset (almost the first I have seen since we left England) and by the time we arrived at Weseu it was a beautiful clear moonlight even I t was too late for the diligence to Glarus and we accordingly purchased a pole for a trifle and having fastened our luggage to it and hoisting it on to our shoulders we set off for Glarus where we arrived about 12 o'clock having fortunately managed to get a lift on the way I now began to be confirmed in an opinion I had formed some time before viz ; that we were very foolish in bringing so much luggage - We brought each a whole change of clothes besides shirts socks and sundries filling two carpet bags & in addition our plaids and great coats, altogether making a far greater weight than it is ever possible for us to carry; we have therefore been obliged to get a porter to carry our things whenever we have (? walk ed ) a anywhere which is an expensive way of travelling - for notwithstanding that Murray (John Murray's Handbooks for Travellers series started in 1836 and were the British take on Baedeker's idea) says you can get porters for 3 or 4 Franks a day we find we cannot get them for less than double the price. If I had to set out from England on the same expedition I should bring a knapsack (the only thing at all fitted for carrying weight with comfort for a long distance) in this I should have a few shirts socks etc & a change of shoes; I should bring instead of a change of clothes a water-proof loose coat and gaiters which may easily put in ones pockets and lastly either a great coat or a plaid it matters not which. It would have been easy to carry these 20 miles a day, much expense might have been saved, and we should have been also much more independent. For the last two or three stages we have adopted the plan of taking what we absolutely want in one carpet bag and sending the rest round to the next town by a diligence when there is one and we thus get on better. Sunday at Glarus was a beautiful day (the only fine day we have had in Switzerland) - we walked up the Linth Thal (Linthal) as far as the Baths of Stechelberg & back and enjoyed it very much about 27 miles altogether. On Monday morning the Landlord of the Inn procured us a porter to carry our baggage over the Pragel Pass to Schwytz about 33 miles - for which we were obliged to agree to give him 15 franks a vast deal to much - but there was no alternative - our Host said a mule would cost 30 Fr !!! Our porter brought a boy with him in the morning as he thought the luggage was more than he could manage - We set out in good spirits as it was then tolerably fine though cloudy - All along the Klon Thal and passed the lake of Klon it continued pretty fine and we enjoyed the walk for about 8 miles exceedingly by the side of the little lake which is shut in completely all round by mountains certainly one of the most picturesque spots I have seen \"une des vallees les plus gracious qu'il y ait dans les Alps\" As we began to ascend to the summit of the pass however it began to rain and it continued to do so all the rest of the day - and we walked on in icy cold rain & dense clouds, alternately on snow & wet yellow grass in sight of nothing but ourselves & the path for about 13 miles to the little village of Muotta - where we arrived thoroughly wet through cold and chilly - we could not induce our porter to go on any further and we were accordingly obliged to stop at the little Inn at Muotta W e changed our clothes and endeavoured to make ourselves as comfortable as we could under the circumstances but no one there could speak either a word of French or English so we were very hard up. However in ? the . . . . . evening the Priest came in hearing that we were there and he could ? talk French and of course understood Latin so that between the two we managed to have some conversation - He was excessively kind and seemed extremely concerned and interested about us; he stopped some hours to keep us company and acted as interpreter & mediator between us and our porter who got into a great rage & threw away the money when we offered him 12 Fr for his pay (nearly = to the original sum agreed on though he had come 9 miles short of the distance) we were quite determined however not to give him any more which we got the Priest to tell him and then let him go to bed to think better of it. The next morning after breakfast I sent for the porter and offered him the 12 Fr again which put him again into a towering passion - he declared he would have 15 and snatched up one of our bags and rushed about the room like a madman which amused us exceedingly though I was very angry too. His Reverence expecting there would be a row had already found his way into the house and when he heard the noise walked quietly into the room - his presence at once shut up the guide who put down the bag and seemed ashamed of himself and our kind & excellent friend taking our part lectured the man for some time and we were at last glad to get away in peace by paying 13 francs - The rain kept off long enough to allow us to get to Schwytz - we had intended to have gone on up the Rhigi - but pouring rain and dense clouds compelled us to stop at Schwytz . We sent our luggage on to Lucerne by diligence having had enough of porters - the next morning it being moderately fine we set off from Schwytz and walked to Goldau and from there up the Rhigi - when we got to the top we could see nothing for we were enveloped in clouds and mist - excepting that now & then between the clouds we caught a momentary glimpse sufficient to show us how magnificent at panorama we had around us if we could but only see it - it was also most bitterly cold and plaids and great coats did but little towards keeping us warm the roof of the Righi Kulm Inn being still covered with snow and patches of snow melting all about - After some time towards sunset the clouds in great part cleared off so that for a short time we had a view of the whole panorama though not a very good one much of the beautiful colouring of the picture having vanished as the sun sank - especially that most beautiful greenish blue colour which the lakes have when seen from the top of the mountain. The sun set behind the clouds unfortunately - \"sulky and grim he went to bed - sulky and grim went we\" this was hardly the case however with us - the other lines were more correct \"sulky and grim he rose again - sulky and grim rose we\" for when we got up we could scarcely see a yard before us for the dense clouds and wet; it continued to pour all the way down to Weggis & all the time we were crossing the lake to Lucerne but we managed to keep ourselves dry with umbrellas - at Lucerne we were glad to change our clothes and Feed - it cleared up for a few hours in the evening and I walked up to the \" Lime Trees\" a hill outside the town from which I managed to get a very good view of the lake & mountains around it Mount Pilate being most striking. The next morning Friday was tolerably fine but we could not leave Lucerne till the middle of the day as we were obliged to have our shirts etc washed here. We had a very comfortable passage along the lake in the steamer to Fluellen, the part of the lake called the bay of Uri being certainly stupendously grand by far the finest thing I have yet been able to see. We got on to a diligence at Fluellen going to the Hoof . . . . . village at the foot of the Golthard Pass but the rain & clouds came on again as bad as (before ?) and between that & the darkness we were able to see little or nothing of cv . . . . ? ye. wild and wonderful gorge of the Reuss and of the Devils Bridge crossing it. I wish much now that we had slept at Altorf ( actual spelling Altdorf)and walked on the next morning but having so little time we were obliged to hasten on. Martigny July 5th. I have had no time to continue my account suffice it to say that since I wrote the above we have had much better weather and we arrived here today & intend passing the Tete Noire tomorrow to Chamouny and thence to Geneva & home by Paris. - Bob fell down and hurt his leg so that he had to take to a horse for a time it is quite well again now - I am better than I was I am very happy to say but not by any means square yet.

Poem by Eliza (Ester Milnes Day): A TOUR TO THE GLACIERS OF SAVOY., 1792.\n\nCopied out in Edward Liveing's papers.\n\nAn Epistle to John Waller, Esq.\n\nESCAP'D from an ocean of ice,\n\nFrom the wonders we've been to explore,\n\nI send you my thanks in a trice;\n\nAnd I wish'd to have sent them before.\n\nSo charm'd with your elegant lays,\n\nYour kind wishes for all were so hearty,\n\nI would I could send you the bays\n\nThought your due by each one of our party.\n\nYou cannot conceive, my good Sir,\n\nWhat a chagrin I felt to depart\n\nWith only a verbal devoir,\n\nWhen I felt so well pleas'd in my heart.\n\nSo delighted with what I had read,\n\nTo describe it would make it the less,\n\nLike music it runs in my head;\n\nI wou'd praise but I cannot express.\n\nWhy so distant? full oft have I said\n\nSuch good neighbours should live near together;\n\nMy genius is heavy as lead,\n\nWhich, near you, was as light as a feather.\n\nYet ere we adieu for the last,\n\nI hope you forget not the plan;\n\nLet us have one more social repast,\n\nAnd pray, let it be at Lausanne.\n\nO come, but to hear where we've been,\n\nWhat a frolic we've ta'en in our gay days;\n\nIn us the old proverb is seen;\n\n\"Far fetch'd and dear bought's good for ladies.\"\n\nWhen we parted with you at Genevè,\n\nThe road was enchantingly various;\n\nWe began for to laugh in our sleeve,\n\nWhen they talk'd of the things that would scare us.\n\nThe Arve it flow'd winding along\n\nCultur'd vales, as we view'd them askance;\n\nEnraptur'd we chatted and sung,\n\nTill arriv'd at the town of Sallenche.\n\nAh me, then our troubles began,\n\nFor our carriage no further could go,\n\nSo we, stuff'd in a vile charabanc1,\n\nBe-jerk'd from our top to our toe.\n\nO, Gemini me! what a squalling,\n\nAs along the rough muleteer bang'd us;\n\nO, hold fast, be sure, each kept bawling,\n\nAs through the wild torrents he twang'd us.\n\nLook here! and see there! cried each one,\n\nAs over such steeps we were twitch'd;\n\nBut I vow in the midst of the fun!\n\nI thought our mule driver bewitch'd!\n\nSuch twistings and jerkings there were,\n\nPredetermin'd to heartily bump us;\n\nZig-zag, like a dog in a fair,\n\nTo all the four points of the compass.\n\nHowever, to shorten my story,\n\nIn very few words may be said,\n\nWhen you get to the vale of Chamouny,\n\nAll your twitches and jerks are repaid.\n\nFor though many a vale we had pass'd,\n\nAnd o'er mountains, whose heads were gigantic,\n\nYet this vale of all vales, at the last,\n\nWas beyond every thing most romantic.\n\nI wish'd for a genius of fire,\n\nI wish'd for a thousand of quills,\n\nOf paper, far more than a quire,\n\nTo sketch but each beauty it fills.\n\nFor though I no genius was born,\n\nFrom such wishes I am not exempt;\n\nYour pen would the subject adorn:\n\nYou might soar, but I must not attempt.\n\nFrom this vale you ascend the Glaciers;\n\nOn our ten toes we brav'd the fatigues;\n\nThat day laid aside female fears,\n\nAnd trudg'd, there and back, full eight leagues.\n\nO, such puffing, and breathing, and blowing,\n\nSome languishing, faint, half expiring!\n\nSome danc'd, others sung, as a-going,\n\nMelting airs! for we all were perspiring.\n\nThe guides they stump'd first, looking big,\n\nWith a prong, we each one scrambled after;\n\nThough they all talk'd of dancing a jig,\n\nI protest I was far off from laughter.\n\nCuriosity nudg'd me me vain,\n\nFor slipping I look'd to my feet,\n\nThough expiring, I durst not complain;\n\nBut with ecstasy cry'd Lord, how sweet!\n\nSuch chasms there yawn'd on the plain,\n\nAs fearful I peep'd o'er the rocks,\n\nAy, if ever you catch me again,\n\nI deserve to be clutch'd in your stocks.\n\nThen sliding and trembling again,\n\nEach wonder fresh frights on us heaping,\n\nEach silently grunting through pain,\n\nThough forewarn'd, we must all pay for peeping.\n\nArriv'd at the Maison de Blair,\n\nA hut that is not over nice,\n\nYet pleas'd, although homely the fair!\n\nThen went on to the ocean of ice.\n\nIf to wonder it makes you look old,\n\nSuch wonder of wonders are in it;\n\nMuse but how those billows are roll'd,\n\nYou'd be ninety years old in a minute.\n\nSuppose the sea heaving and swelling,\n\nArrested in act of that motion,\n\nWith colours the rainbow excelling,\n\nAnd you'll faintly conceive the Ice Ocean.\n\nThe torrents that scare you withal,\n\nThe deep fissures that strike ye with wonder,\n\nThe immense rocks of ice, as they fall,\n\nWith reverb'rating noise loud as thunder.\n\nYet though 'twas enchantingly fine,\n\nTrès superbe, magnifique , the rude murmur,\n\nStill the part I thought nearest divine,\n\nWas when my feet touch'd terra firma .\n\nDown the mountain we trudg'd it again,\n\nEach anxious to see the dear valley;\n\nThe whole party were hopping through pain,\n\nLike a group of lame ducks in an alley.\n\nBut oh, woe on woe, on the plain,\n\nThree good miles had we yet for to go;\n\nWe were caught in a deluge of rain,\n\nAnd besous'd from our top to our toe.\n\nThe lightning it flash'd in our faces,\n\nThe hail it bespatter'd us round;\n\nWe all made most direful grimaces;\n\nTo hear the hoarse thunder resound.\n\nHad you seen but the droop of our hats,\n\nNot a thread 'mongst us all of dry linen;\n\nThough we look'd like a parcel of rats,\n\n'Midst our troubles we cou'd not help grinning.\n\nArriv'd at our inn at the last,\n\nOur kind hostess she thought it so handy,\n\nBefore any other repast,\n\nTo drench us all round with some brandy.\n\nThen in our hot beds we reclin'd,\n\nEach serv'd with a bason of whey;\n\nYet withal, 'twas a wonder to find\n\nWe had none of us colds the next day.\n\nBut now the plot thickens, good Sir;\n\nWe were all for Martini that night;\n\nO, the road 'twas so bad, and so far!\n\n'Twould have turn'd your wig grey, with the fright.\n\nSuch a mountain of mountains to climb,\n\nIt was out of all carriage's rules!\n\nAs 'tis out of my power to rhyme\n\nThe figure we cut upon mules.\n\nEn cavalier one after t'other,\n\nWe mounted the Col de Baum's ridge,\n\nWhilst to keep up the rear rode my brother;\n\nLike so many ducks o'er a bridge.\n\nAnd first, like Dean Swift, we went up,\n\nAnd then we went down, down, down a,\n\nAnd then we were wrench'd o'er a gap,\n\nThat I thought would have cracked our crown a.\n\nAnd then we went sideling away,\n\nIn good truth I was struck with such awe, Sir,\n\nLike a stuck pig, I star'd with dismay,\n\nFor the mules they would go as they chose, Sir,\n\nRightly judging, they knew the way best;\n\nAnd though dreading to fall on my nose, Sir,\n\nI found 'twas in vain to contest.\n\nHad you been in the valley below,\n\nAs we seem'd to be scrambling o'er trees,\n\nYou'd have ta'en us, each one for a crow;\n\nOr the maggotty fry in a cheese.\n\nThen such calling each one for our guides,\n\nThat from laughter you'd not have withstood,\n\nA huge peasant at each of our sides,\n\nHand in hand, like the babes in the wood.\n\nYet in spite of our delicate woe,\n\nEach beauty rose on us so fast,\n\nAnd more to my fancy, I know,\n\nAs I knew it was mountain the last.\n\nArriv'd at the top, we descended,\n\nOn tiptoe; but think of our toil,\n\nWhen we thought that the worst it was ended,\n\nTo find we must trudge near four mile.\n\nO, such walking, good Heaven defend us!\n\nThough the guides seem'd to have it by rote;\n\nSure never was aught so tremendous,\n\nFit for no earthly foot, save a goat.\n\nStill hobbling, we fagg'd it again,\n\nAnd sideling like crabs, reach'd the vale;\n\nTo have kept on the mules would been vain,\n\nUnless we'd been tied on their tail.\n\nOn their stomachs, they slid down some places,\n\nHow enlivening this sight was to boot;\n\nIt caus'd us a few more grimaces;\n\nAnd I hugg'd myself, stumbling on foot.\n\nPass'd the steepest, we mounted again,\n\nO, sure for fatigue such a trimming!\n\nAfter all, three full hours in hard rain;\n\nSo that into the town we went swimming.\n\nSuch a group of deplorable creatures,\n\nBedaggled and wet to the skin,\n\nYet we hardly could summons our features\n\nTo look grave, when we came to the inn.\n\nSuch an inn, such a villainous inn,\n\nThe Grande Maison 'tis call'd at Martini;\n\nShould any one stop there again,\n\nI would set that one down for a ninny.\n\nThe beds were so dirty and small,\n\nBugs and fleas they attack'd us by dozens;\n\nBut what teaz'd me more than them all,\n\nWere those plagues of all plagues, call'd your cousins2.\n\nAfter all our fatigues, only think,\n\nTo be bor'd by those vermin all night,\n\nThat of sleep I could not get a wink;\n\nAnd I actually blubber'd through spite!\n\nBut when we got up in the morning,\n\nEach thinking themselves bit as me,\n\nWe began with a concert of yawning\n\nFor with but one eye could I see!\n\nThe other was clos'd up from day,\n\nHands and arms too, so swell'd and so sore,\n\nEach shew'd such a direful display,\n\nThat I wish'd myself home o'er and o'er.\n\nHere our carriage rejoin'd us again,\n\nAnd in we all tumbled, such frights;\n\nFrom complaining no one could refrain;\n\nFor a season, quite sicken'd with sights.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1.

What an anxious morning I have had no one can tell. Surely \"the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong\" - I desire that I may never forget the very great and most undeserved goodness of God in thus helping me: I have forgotten him day after day and night after night - but He has not forgotten me. If it had not been that many of y.things (ie. the) which I had read (and they were very few) were set in the papers - often the very things I had accidentally chosen to read the night before, and this not once but several times, I do not think I could have passed.\n\nI cannot think why you have not written to me.

I could only answer one question in it. It has been a terrible and heavy blow to me. I cannot tell what may be the consequence. I made guesses at 2 or 3 more of the questions - but it must remain very dubious whether I pass or not until the list is out. It is a very heavy blow at the last.\n\nWhat I have endured the last few days no one can tell. I am quite ill - completely exhausted in body and mind. I have had the most horrible nights lately - no sound rest but hideous\n\nPage 2.\n\ndreams and waking terrors - so that when I have arisen in the morning I have hardly known how to support myself much less to go to an examination. Should I get through I shall hardly recover and if I am plucked - oh! I cannot tell the consequence. I am all well nigh bewildered now.\n\nIf I get through I will tell you more about the examinations if I am well enough. I have been obliged to have soup and stimulants to keep me at all up.\n\nI am going to move into Mr Green's rooms today. He has gone to London - if he comes to you be very kind to him - he has been very kind to me. I am wrought up into the most horrible state of irritability. That pulsation in my stomach has increased think and frightened me a good deal just now.\n\nPage 3.\n\nGood bye my dearest wife. If I did not feel so ill I should be longing to be at home and with you and the dear children again. I think if I knew that I were through the excitement of that might aid in getting me up.

With regard to the food I have not been able to look after it any more - but she did not eat that fruit pie up the other day I was happy to see - indeed it would have been almost too preposterous. I have this day paid 11s 10d for milk, 8s 1d for a week beginning July 4th and 3s 9d for the next. I cannot tell that this is right it seems\n\nPage 3\n\nto me that you could not have paid up the milk bill as you said you would. Besides I paid 5s for the week - I suppose for washing but I do not know. I do not like having no one to keep house who I can depend on, & no time to see after it myself. George does not come home to dinner till 7 o'clock to night. Dr Todd does not get on with the work & I expect that when he goes he will leave it all in my hands & prevent my holyday.(sic) I do not know when Robert goes. Mr Green has passed the College of surgeons I am happy to say & has got one of Wigrams ships, 1st class, with passengers & emigrants. I am very miserable I don't know how to get back to Highbury now I am so bad. My best love to you dearest & the babes -Eddy has never written his note to me. How do they amuse themselves?

Edward Liveing FRCP: Notes on his Family, 1870.\n\nLiveing Archive IMG 3758/59/68\n\nPosted to respective persons refered to.\n\nNotes made July 1870 by Edward Liveing FRCP.\n\nCapt Liveing (Snr) died October 1836 at his house at Harwich; his wife in January 1837 at her son Edward at Nayland. She was well when she went there and was taken with the epidemic of influenza then prevailing and died of bronchitis.\n\nCapt William Liveing went to Weymouth about 1833 - 34. He had a house previously in Harwich (not the one he first occupied, in King Street next to his father's) belonging to Mr Thorogood bought by him for Capt Liveing's benefit. He was at Weymouth about seven years. The Lady Nepean was sold, at Harwich, the Govt giving Capt William Liveing £1700 (they sold it after for £400). All the captains of packet service at Harwich were ranked as Masters and Commanders so to secure half pay as naval commanders viz £150 or £120. Capt Liveing senior son was given a commission and the price of packet instead of he himself receiving a retiring Presentation.\n\nCapt William Liveing's vessel at Weymouth was The Flavier a lady's name changed to the Firefly. He was paid £1000 a year in service perhaps seven years. The naval officers were jealous that he should hold a birth of this good kind and they persuaded him to retire on pension of hundred £120 this was done under cover of a medical exam and certificate that his eyesight was bad. There were disputes about the ranks of these commanders ye Harwich packets in Harwich. E.g. on one occasional sprig of nobility in a man of war went on Board Capt G Drum's packet and asked for the master, Capt Drum sent for the mate, saying this is the master. Are you not the master then? No, I am commander. Uncle Henry says they held an admiralty commission in post office services. Another dispute was that Capt Bridge was so elated by his intimacy to the Hope family and the Prince of Orange (whom he carried over) that on one occasion on his return, he indirectly hoisted a Commodores flag and a naval officer came and hauled it down.\n\nCapt Liveing Snr began sea life with Capt Saunders who commanded the Revenue Cutter Argus. (He it was who picked up Major Money1, the celebrated Aeronaut when he fell into the sea) it was while Capt Liveing was mate of the Argus (his uncle Saunders being drunk in bed) that Capt Liveing piloted the Baltic fleet into the Texel. (Lord Nelson in command) on another occasion ( . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ) he did the same office into Copenhagen had to sound perpetually to ascertain if there was water enough for the men of war.\n\nPage 2.\n\nAfter serving in the Argos Capt Liveing Snr served in the Iris which he commanded (as Master). She was a rev [enue] Cutter and tender on the Adml in the Baltic fleet. He was at the siege of Boulogne, one of those unfortunate boating expeditions. Amongst other places of service he was specially commissioned, at one time to take Johnson a notorious smuggler who was supposed to convey tidings to the French, Capt Liveing was once in the same room to him without knowing it. At that time (the old war) too there was much privateering which gave the cutters plenty of work. Afterwards when the naval war was over his services were less in request and he joined the packet service; they were private vessels (that is the goodwill and vessels were bought by those commanding (or masters) but hired or chartered by Govt, for P.O. service. He had the Lady Nepean named after the admiral which afterwards went to his son Capt William Liveing. Capt T Liveing Snr twice conveyed the French Royal Family (except the King Louis XVIII) viz, afterwards? Charles X and his family to Holland.\n\nCapt W Liveing Junior. There were not packets enough for the service and the commanders of them agreed to fund four vessels themselves and Commanders or Masters for the Govt at certain contract. Captain Liveing Snr had a share in this and the appointment of his son Capt W Liveing as master of one of them the Thetis. (He had previously served as a sailor on his father's vessel the Lady Nepean) Capt W Liveing lost the Thetis on the rocks off Jutland, Court-Martial of captains acquitted him. After that his father resigned his command of the Nepean in his favour, which he secured to him through his friend . . . . . Lord Bexley (the Honourable Nicholas Vansittart Chancellor of Exchequer and MP for Harwich Lord High Steward of Harwich (see Portrait in Town Hall)\n\nPage 3.\n\nThe same kind friend procured for his next son Mr Charles Liveing (who had been brought up as a farmer) the position of clerk In the National Debt Office, in which he rose to be Chief Clerk. (C Liveing was apprenticed to Mr Wallanger at Finborough, his father paid £100 per annum for his learning, wheat fell to £7 a load in 1822 and farming became a bad business).\n\nBaileys of Harwich. \"Grandfather Bailey was a member of Corp: and a builder (the house he lived in and built was that in West Street where Mr George Deane lived) John Bailey his eldest son, apprenticed to Mr Hopkins, a surgeon (attended the livings &) he became surgeon and wrote a tr on Bella donna plant. So good that University of Paris conferred Doctor of M.D. on him. He married a Mrs Brooks (of Ipswich?) A first or second cousin of Capt Liveing Snr of Harwich. Another son was surgeon at Thetford successful and two daughters Mrs Sewell Oakley Mrs Sampson Harwich. John Bailey some, were 1 John Hopkins 2 . . . . . 3 Brooke 4 Alen 5 Edgar and two daughters Mrs Head of Ipswich and the other engaged to a army cadet, who used to be at Tendering, broken off. Brooke Bailey married his cousin Emily Sanson) was killed at siege of Leone Etan.)\n\nOld Hopkins became \"clerk of ye check\" and repeatedly Mayor of Harwich. Very wealthy £70,000. He put Mr John Baileys son J H B to college £500 per annum at Trinity College (Camb). He was clergyman at or near Baddow Essex (about uncle Henry's age) Hebrew scholar at Cambridge, was here and at Westminster School. Hopkins left £10,000 to Mr Hales who married Miss Catherine Stevens (once a sweetheart out of many of Charles Liveing. Very good looking he is now Mayor of Harwich (1870).\n\nGrandfather Fenn of Cobham had one son Robert, Capt in Yeomanry, who succeeded him in house and farm (Rectory farm belonged to Longe) and married Miss Harriet Liveing, and four daughters two married men in Bradstreet one of whom was steward and managing agent of the grandfather of the present Sir N Brooke Middleton of Shrubland Hall by Ipswich and Coddenham one married Mr Goodwin of Stowmarket? a jack of all trades - sharp - like old Thorogood, children disliked him.

Dr Edward Liveing: Letter to Charles Martin Torlesse, 29 May 1881, Bourne Farnham SRY.\n\nRef : Bygone Days Pages 269 - 271 See Books section\n\n\" MY DEAR MR. TORLESSE, \"\n\nWe have been talking and thinking much of you to-day, this being as we think, your eighty-sixth birthday, and we all, that is Tassie, Margaret, Willy and myself; desire to join in sending you our kind love and best of wishes for your 87th year. When we last heard of you you were thinking of getting into your garden again. I hope you may have been able to do so during some of the sunshiny days we have had, or if not yet that you will shortly be able. Here we have had some heavy storm showers since Friday, which the country needed very much, especially in this neighbourhood where the soil is exceedingly sandy and light and the hops just coming on. Perhaps you remember this part of the world in former years ? We are here about four or five miles of the chalk ridge of the Hog's Back, on what a few years ago was completely open heath country extending some 7 or 8 miles Eastward towards Godalming and southward to Hindhead where the Portsmouth road crosses the highest part of the sandhills overlooking Haslemere, before descending towards Petersfield. It must have been a grand country for highwaymen in days gone by, and indeed the site of the gallows on Hindhead is now marked by a granite cross where \" the gentlemen of the road \" used to swing, I believe almost within your memory. The country is still very wild and there are many miles of still open heath making glorious sheets of purple when the heather is blooming, but an extraordinary change has been effected in a much larger portion\n\nPage 270\n\nof late years, not so much by enclosure and cultivation as by planting with firs which seem to thrive in the sand where nothing else will, so that the country seen now from some of the higher points around looks like a piece of the Black Forest. I was talking to an old man the other day who was mowing the grass in Seale Churchyard (the next Parish west of Walter Holland's) and he told me he quite well remembered the first plantations made about 20 years ago, and the effect had been in that short time to make land worth nothing very valuable property. \"Another charm of the country here is the winding course of the River Wey through it, forming a most picturesque contrast of scenery when you come upon it, with now a narrow belt of green meadows and now steep wooded banks, and running as fast as a northern trout stream. About a mile from this house is one of the prettiest points, the site of Waverley Abbey, of which some picturesque ruins remain. \"The old man I spoke of just now told me, among other things, of the high prices he remembered in his young days during the old war, especially of bread and salt. He said they used to have to sell the whole inside of a pig to buy the salt wherewith to cure the rest, and that the price was a guinea a bushel. He went on to tell me a curious circumstance he remembered about salting a pig at that time, and he could fix the date he said, because he went to see two notorious malefactors hung at Godalming that year ; the circumstance was this : The pork was salted as usual but in a new tub, but when they came to take it out the salt was there as dry as when it was put in, nevertheless the pork was very fairly salted. \" Have you seen the life of Dr. Whewell, just edited by his niece Mrs. Douglas ? I should think it might interest you. \" It is strange and suggestive in these days of cramming and competitive examinations to find Julius Hare writing to Whewell of these as two great evils in 1843: I wished your Vice-chancellorship should have been distinguished by measures of greater difficulty and of higher importance to the University ; by an attempt at least to do something towards lessening those two terrible evils of our system, the practice of private tuition and the use of emulation as the one great spur to the acquirement\n\nPage 271\n\nof knowledge. You know how deeply I feel the mischief of these two evils. I believe it is very much owing to them that our position relatively to Oxford has altered so much in the last 20 years. Oxford has risen and we have sunk ; and we shall continue to sink unless we get rid of our system of drilling for parade and of our morbid stimulants, and adopt a system which will call forth a living power and train our students to walk without leading strings.' \" Have you seen the Revised New Testament ? I have not, but from what I hear of it it must be very disappointing. Alteration of old familiar words and expressions where not really necessary, and where changes were really required the attempt to translate into the quaint old language of the authorised version. I had looked for a new version in Modern English, not to replace the old one but to be used with it by any who wished. This I think would have been worth the labour, though a very difficult task. \" I hope we may see you some time in the course of the Summer or Autumn, and find you well. Looking forward to so doing I remain\n\n\" As always affect. yours,\n\n\" EDW. LIVEING.\"\n\n21.

Mr Jones invited him one day to dinner to meet an old and intimate friend of his, Mr Kirby the entomologist1.

He spoke of having seen him with the utmost seriousness and gravity of manner, and Mr Jones received the information with equal seriousness and good faith Mr Harold however could not help letting a smile cross his face which could not escape the notice of Mr Jones, who, inferring that it betokened some degree of in credibility thought it right to administer a severe rebuke on his unbecoming and sceptical frame of mind, which Mr Harold of course took in good part.\n\nI should say that Mr Harold died at an advanced age about 1840 (1765-1849)\n\nVery sincerely\n\nE L\n\nFootnote.\n\n1.

We left for this part earlier than I had intended, because we found unless we came here at once we could not have these quarters (which we like) at all as they were let later on. Aunt C. & I and Ma \"Bloater\" came here after a great scrimmage (sic) to get off on Thursday last. Harry and Margaret, who had been staying at Chobham, came on Monday, and Molly has arrived from Qn Anne St today . Some of us have been up the Pike's and also Bo(w)fell (sic) on both of which we found the remains of large Jubilee Bonfires, the iron bands which kept them together & the empty petroleum cans, various rocket cases & sticks. Men were employed here at 5s a day for weeks carrying up fuel etc? After all the result as seen from below, the people tell us here, was like a lantern on the top only. I hear there was a very fine one on Scafell Pike, but we have not got as far. We have had such a long drought & intense heat in the South since May that it seems quite a strange experience to find the air here keen & fresh and everything green instead of burnt up. Notwithstanding all this the year has been remarkable for the perfection of the tree foliage, and very strikingly so in London where the trees in all the squares parks and Gardens were still quite thick & quite green when we left, it appears due to the very late winter we had which made the spring a whole month behind, this late coming out seems always\n\nOver.\n\nfavourable to trees. Aunt Mary's illness of which you had not heard, consisted of a very severe attack of sciatica or pain at all events, in her leg & hip, entirely preventing her getting any ease or sleep for many days & nights and confining her to bed as any movement aggravated it. My belief is that it was not true sciatica which is a neuralgia?, but pain owing to inflammatory action in muscles or ligaments or tendons coming on at some time after a fall she had by not seeing well & sitting down on the edge of a chair which let her on to the floor. She still has a nurse with her who can manage her and make her comfortable - her poor stupid maid cant, In consequence partly of her man Coton's ill health and partly of his neglect and a want of any efficient head to look after things - her garden had been left to become a wilderness & her household much demoralised This is a pity as such conditions are far more easily prevented than cured. Harry's long illness which kept Charlotte away five months contributed by preventing her going to look after things there. And we had got to such a muddled state at home with our own stupids that it was absolutely necessary for her to stop at home as soon as she could get there. Margaret has been with her most of late, but she was unfit to go at one time, the care of the house at home having been too much for her. If no new misfortunes come I trust now we may get on better after we return and once more get into working grooves and get some things done & old arrears of all kinds which have accumulated cleared off. The last quarterly meeting of the College I had to conduct alone and\n\nOver.\n\nread or speak for nearly 2 hours as Sir Henry P was taken ill and unable to leave his bed. He has gone to N Wales to recruit where he has taken a large house at Llanfairfechan, & he has made myself and Meg promise to go and spend a week there on our way south, a great trial to me, & involving bringing dress clothes etc north and encumbering us, but it was kindly meant & the dear old man would not be refused. He now tells me she (sic) shall not resign just yet (this time last year he called at Qn A St & told me he should not continue after the opening of the New Hall in April last) not until the lease of his house expires which is not for another year or more. Personally I am glad for I am not master of half the business of the College's precedents for guidance in various cases as they arise, & I know no one else except himself who is, very much of both having grown up under his own management during the last 30 years. For myself it can only be acquired gradually as cases arise and by study of the Annals. To be able to answer all kinds of questions put off hand at a College meeting by any fellow is by no means an easy acquirement for a new hand or head rather. The Wilson Browns have left Assington Vicarage & gone to stay in Ipswich for a change - near Mrs Brown's mother, and sister (who is slowly dying of cancer of the tongue, poor soul!) Sam Brown went with H Mosley and Sarah Mosley a spar tour in Brittany and spent a day or two with us on her way back. She is a nice child I think, and simple, with all her learning and information which is considerable. I took her over the College. John Bridges has let his house for 3 months to a (sic) an old Lunatic (probably dementia) lady & her attendants, & gone abroad with his wife.\n\nOver.\n\nYes, I was very much interested in the Jubilee celebrations in the Abbey. Sir H. was afraid to go and so I went as representing him, with a Vice president, two Censors and Treasurer. We had good places above the Judges in S. Transept - 8 or 10 feet below the Triforium level. We had an extremely good view of the Old Lady and her immense family who occupied a large crimson dais in the centre under the lantern, with the Chair and Stone of Scone for the Queen & gold chairs for the family including the grandchildren of sufficient age. Round the dais was an extremely handsome ormolu railing brought from one of the palaces they said. Of course we could see nothing of the procession entering or coming up the Abbey. The performance was very unlike a religious one, and the music was execrable for the most part, poor in composition & thin in performance; and tho' we sat there for 2 hours in advance we were not relieved by any music or organ performance. In fact it was a very unworthy concern in that department though a very great success in every other. I never saw and could not have believed that so orderly & well behaved a mass of people could have been brought together. The puzzle to me was how to get there - having to go in scarlet robes & be there at 9 or before. A week before I had ordered a carriage; but Sir H. talking to me about it said his man had asked him L3 or L4 for one and advised me to see what mine was going to charge. Then I found that probably the carriages might never get up to the Abbey and so I countermanded it altogether. I started early & walked with my robes in a bundle to Baker Street about 8 - found the next train with abundance of room & booked for St James Park (our tickets were by Dean's Yard & Cloisters) - Long before we got there every carriage was full & the centre with people standing as many as could force themselves in. I got out and walked along a carriage way kept clear by police without difficult(y) (sic) to find an assembly of people in every sort\n\nOver.\n\nof court costume in Dean's yard. There I struggled on my robes & joined the rest. I thought very often both before and since of Barney Maguires account of the Coronation but a jubilee crowd is not what it was then, and the \"cakes & apples in all the chapels\" & free ingress & egress to a certain portion of the Abbey for all comers could never be again as it was so then. I heard through Duckworth whose brother was officiating as one of the Canons, that the organist had orders to blow out every stop in the organ over night to make sure that no dynamite had been lodged in any pipes etc. A good many people present in some form belong to the Abbey. I do not know whether I told you the history of my securing a letter of your G G G G Grandfather Dr Richard Torlefse thro' the kindness of Dr Munk1. One day he bought a long extract from a M.S. diary kept by a Dr Young of Plymouth at end of 17th & beginning of the 18th century; it contained an account of his examination for the licence as a Physician - very amusing indeed & very Pepys like. He thought it would interest Pitman & myself and he lent it me to copy, when I got it home I found it contained complete details of the exam as conducted by the Presidents House, Sir T Millington by himself and the Censors of whom Dr Torlefse was one, with amusing remarks on their various characters and manners - then \"Dr so & so a grim and sour old man\" and at the end he wound up with - \"but sweeter men than the present & Dr Torlefse I never met\". When I returned it to Dr Munk I said how much amused and interested I had been in such a lively picture of the College a century and half ago and then added \"but it has been an interest for me quite independently for Dr Torlefse who figures in it was my childrens four times great grandfather in a single line on their mothers side\" He then said\n\nOver.\n\n\"If that's the case you would like to see a letter I formerly had of Dr Torlesfe's; if I can find it you shall have it.\" He did find it and gave it me - it is his letter to the President when he fell into ill health & the gout, owing partly to the trouble & poverty which had come on him resigning his office of \"Elect\". It has his little seal with the stork crest - rather rudely executed. There are of course numerous entries in our annals (which go back to H(enry) VIII) of his share taken in College business; I have noted a few but have not had leisure to look them up. Dr Munk furnished me with another piece of information about him which helped to fill up a blank & reconcile a difficulty. There were of Dr Torlefse's children, besides Christopher & Anthony from the former of whom you are descended, & who took their names from their mother's family, the Browns of Stamford, two other sons at least, one \"Richard Torlefse Jnr.\" who witnesses a will of one of the family and William Torlefse of Barnards Inn Holborn, buried in St Andrews Ch. yard Holborn, who bequeathed his money to his dear friend Mrs Bleunerhafset, and cuts \"his brothers Christopher & Anthony\" off with a shilling\" The wills of old Christopher Brown of Stamford and his son bequeath money on the contrary to Dr Torlesse & Christopher & Anthony only of his children. Now Dr Munk showed me an extract from the registers of the Savoy Chapel containing the marriage of Dr Richard Torlefse with Mary (De Cardonnell). I cant remember the rather peculiar name. This was evidently a former marriage & Richard & William the children of it and only half brothers to Christr & Anty. Having Dr R Torlefs's writing, with the letter of Christopher's I found in the Brit Mussm,- and the family bible of his son John, and at least the will, probably letters also with the Torlefses, of the 2nd John (Mr Torlefses father at Stanmore) we have the series of handwritings from contempy of C.(arles)II downwards, Dr Monk found me the earliest signature of Dr Torlefse on his admission to the College to show me\n\nOver.\n\nits firmnefs as a young man compared with his last letter. I also wrote to the Vicar of Charlton, near Woolwich, where Bridget Torlefse his 2nd wife is buried asking him to search his register about the time Dr T died to see if he had been buried there too. His answer was in the negative & I have now no doubt he was buried in the grave of his first wife wherever that may have been in London, not impossibly in the Savoy Ch or yard. I enclose a Dividend Warrant from the Glasgow Tramways Company for\n\nL1 18s 9d which requires your signature within 3 months. Frances is at Lowestoft with her children I think I told you. We were to have gone to Switzerland walking cheap? this summer and did not intend to have come here again, but Harry's long illness exhausted both my own and Aunt C's funds , tho' we both have a little increase from Uncle Henry's now, so that we could not manage it. I was very sorry to hear of your being kept waiting for instructions to proceed with your shaft when you might as well have been at home. It was very provoking, also your being still kept waiting for your steam pump, I think it very wise of you to have built a little place & office for shelter next the works against the coming winter. But we hope to see you ere then. There are Aunt C., Harry, Miss Rands, Margaret Wolly & myself all sitting writing in a little room 11 feet square, or 11 X 12 625 feet above Ordce. Datm. The heat has been intense and suffocating in London for 3 months & Duckworth writing me from there a few days after having been a short run to Scotland said the air in London felt solid like wool\n\nOver/Here we have it quite cold & fresh like October early mornings and evenings and emerald green grass & deep shady siccamore (sic) trees, & a good deal of rain of course Best love from us all Ever your affecte father Edwd Liveing\n\n1.

Edward Liveing FRCP: Letter to Lionel Cresswell, 13 Feb 1898, Seeking data for Stemmata Alstoniana.\n\nLiveing Archive (C Buxton CD 5 Apr 2009)\n\nDraft of a letter to\n\nLionel Cresswell Esq\n\nWoodhall\n\nCalverley\n\nLeeds\n\n52 Queen Anne Street\n\n13 February 1898\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am much obliged to you for your letter and for sending me a portion of the Alston genealogy (as I learned for the first time) which you are completing and which keenly interests me.\n\nIt is quite true that very any years ago I tried to solve the problem of the connection of our branch of Alston's with those much better known, believing that they all emanated from Boxford in Suffolk or its neighbourhood and like the Waldegraves some had become wealthy in the once prosperous clothing trade in that part of the country. With that view, as leisure gave me the chance I searched the old Alston's house at Nayland which there contained a great number of old wills settlements deeds referring to Alston's, which had come into the office either the way of business or had been collected by George Alston Rector of Studland who years before had devoted himself to the same search. I photographed a few I think. I also obtained a large number of extracts from I think the Boxford and Newton Hadleigh and perhaps Edwardstone registers of births deaths and marriages. I also searched the Register books of the Boxford Grammar School which were kindly place at my disposal by the Trustees.\n\nAs my brother has told you I also searched the Will office of the Archdeaconry Of Sudbury at Bury St Edmunds, for a week and noted many wills. My object however there was not a search for Alston's but for any materials they could afford with reference to the great industry of . . . . . which has long since died out\n\nI also took down from members of the family long since dead all they could remember or had heard on the subject and extended the Alston pedigree of George Alston. I also searched in the British Museum especially Davy's Suffolk collections and I wish to say in passing that Davey put down everything he could get from anywhere regardless of authenticity and some of his tables are not compatible with others.\n\nThe lamentable end of it all is that more important things compelled me to put the whole matter aside without any complete collation of the materials, though as far as I went I had not succeeded in finding the missing links with the main stock.\n\nI have these papers somewhere in the house, and I think given time I could find them and separate these from others but may have difficulty in this: I am not as young as I was and much slower, and the work as Registrar at the College is getting too much for me. Consequently, excepting for my autumn holiday when I get far away from London, I have rarely a minute, most Sundays included, to call my own; and if there is an abatement of work there is always such an accumulation of arrears, things which have been pushed aside for matters more urgent at the moment, that I am no better off. What length of time can you give me?\n\nAs regards the sheet you have sent, there is much which I could correct and add with the help of some members of the family. Thus with respect to Catherine Mary Alston Downing, my mother, I can give children and grandchildren correctly with a little time to refer to the family Bible which is in the keeping of one of my brothers or sisters I don't know where. By the way my mother name was not Alston only Catherine Mary Downing. There are many corrections and additions wanted in the parts you have written across in blue and this suggests they have been already supplied though I do not know from what source. With regard to the two families of George Alston of Studland I could only correct them by applying to some of his descendants which you appear to have done. Edward Graham was a contemporary of mine at Cambridge MA from Trinity College. He was a barrister in London but got tired of waiting for a practice. I don't know how recently you have been in correspondence with Dr Fenn and Mrs Alston of Nayland Dr Fenn is a man of much leisure residing at Greyfriars Colchester and inherited a large Alston property and I know that he has given attention to the genealogy of Alston's at Nayland. He too is within easy connection with Mrs Alston of Nayland who is the oldest surviving member of the family and when I last saw her in July still quite vigourous though approaching 90 I think she is the Margaret of your line. Some years since she told me she had had visits and communications etc.\n\nWith regard to Sir Edward Alston who was president of the RCP in 1655/67 I can add nothing to what Dr Monk has collected as he ransacked the College Archives I kept the college manuals and they have been kept from the time of Dr Caius 1555 but they are records of College business and not biographic in any way.\n\nSo with regard to Samuel Alston of Leicester he did not marry one of the Pare's family but a stressor I think that's the name my brother would know all that best, she was my godmother.\n\nIt occurs to me to mention that Margaret Alston of Nayland told me some years since that she had visits and communications from a Mr Alston (I think a clergyman of Norfolk not as old as herself, but either of her own or my generation, who was greatly interested in finding our branch. This could not be your correspondent the Rev A.E. Alston of Framington of (a grandson of her half brother George,) relatively a child and well-known to her.\n\n30.

There were 3 servants in the house, a cook, a housemaid and a parlour maid.\n\n32. Liveing Family Memorabilia: Documented & Sketched mainly by George Liveing.\n\n33. Edward Liveing:\n\nEdward married Frances Jane (Tassie) TORLESSE [145], daughter of Lieut Henry Boden TORLESSE R N [1622] and Frances HAWTHORNE [1623], on 29 Aug 1854 in Stoke By Nayland SFK. Frances was born Sat 12 Nov 1831 in Tasmania Aust., was baptised Thurs 22 Nov 1831 in New Norfolk Tasmania., died on 3 Aug 1885 in 52 Queen Ann St Cavendish Sq Marylebone MDX aged 53, and was buried on 7 Aug 1885 in Stoke By Nayland SFK.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nTassie returned to England aged 12 after her parents deaths accompanied by her father's friend Sir John Franklin, then Governor of Tasmania, who was later lost seeking the Northwest Passage. She travelled with the family from Hobart to Melbourne on the 'Flying Fish' 9 Dec 1843, then on to London on the 'Rajah\" (Capt Charles Ferguson) in Jan 1844. Tassie shared a governess with Franklin's daughter Eleanor, some seven years her senior. This must have been a very difficult time for a young orphaned woman, Lady Franklin was said to be not an easy person to be around.\n\n(The Rajah sailed on the 10th of January 1844 from Geelong carrying 12 passengers including Lt Gov. Franklin, 1287 bales of wool and one bale of sheepskins. The Rajah arrived in St Helen on the 28th of March, and then arrived in London in on the 8th of June 1844. http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~dferguson/genealogy/Capt.Ferguson/CKFerguson.htm)\n\nOn the eve of her departure in Nov 1843 from Tasmania she wrote an impassioned letter to her cousin in Launceston Sarah Williamson nee Glascott, pouring her lonely heart out to her : \" My dearest and beloved Sarah, I never felt so unhappy in all my life, O that I was with you darling Sarah, I cannot tell you how utterly miserable I feel\" \"I do feel as if I was all alone in the World my own dear Sarah\" A remarkable letter for a 12 yr old, see \"Other Records\" in this file.\n\nUpon arriving in England however Tassie was embraced by loving relatives and happily settled into her Uncle Charles big family of similar age to herself, at the Stoke by Nayland vicarage.\n\nMarried\n\n23rd ult., at Stoke by Nayland, by the Rev H.
