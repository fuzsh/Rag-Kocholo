        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Dana was known as “Harry” to his friends, and lived and worked in the the academic community around Harvard during the early 20th century. The man was a social force of nature, well-known in Cambridge, Boston, and beyond. Lauded for his understanding of Russian drama, his writings, and his lectures, Harry was a respected teacher, author and preservationist.\n\nAs the grandson of the poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and the author, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., it seemed inevitable that Harry, too, would grow up to be an intelligent, thoughtful young man with literary inclinations. He loved to share these passions through teaching. As a gay man, he was an advocate for younger men as they navigated the social circles of elite Harvard and Cambridge. He fought unendingly for laborers and unions, traveled the world many times in his life, and saw the outbreak of World War I while in Germany. Later in life, after being dismissed from Columbia University for his pacifist views, he began to live and work in his grandfather's home."
