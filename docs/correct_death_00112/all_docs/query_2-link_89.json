        "text": "The poem “Paul Revere's Ride” by Henry Wadsworth is mostly inaccurate, but has some similarities with what actually happened. Paul Revere’s friend did climb a church tower, and his ride took place on the night of April 18 1775. However, he did not ride alone, he did not reach Concord, and he never shouted “The British are\n\nPaul Revere was famous for the warning of british troops on April 18, 1775. Sadly, this is just a poem. “Paul Revere’s Ride,” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is a poem incorrectly depicting the events of the fateful night.We’ll look at the Belknap Letter, a letter written by Paul Revere himself depicting what happened that night. We’ll look at the similarities and differences to see how different these two tellings of the night are and how Paul Revere was not a unique hero of the battle of Lexington.\n\nIn “ paul revere’s ride ” poem and in the letter from paul revere there are similarities and differences. I will give you three differences and similarities. The three similarities are they both say paul revere’s midnight ride was on april 18th 1775 , they both tell about one by land or two by sea depending on where the british come from, and they both talked about how the british would attack. My differences are the letter gives more information than the poem , in the poem it told some details of the battle , and in the letter paul revere barely talked about his midnight ride. Now i will explain my similarities than differences.\n\nThere are similarities and differences between the “Midnight Ride of Paul Revere” and the historical account of Paul Revere’s ride. In both texts Paul Revere went across the river to Lexington. However, they got across the river in different ways. Longfellow used history in his poem to make his poem more interesting, but he altered how he got across the river.\n\nThere are many poets that have been writing some of the most amazing poems in the world for years upon years. Poetry is a great way to write about some of the most meaningful things in one’s life, without directly having to state what you’re trying to say some of the times. A lot of poets write about events within their lives as well as things in everyday life in the lives of everyone in the world. The poems “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night” by Dylan Thomas (1914-1953) and “Psalm of Life” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) both use great diction and varying tone in their poems to portray their individual perspectives about life.\n\nRomantic poetry is characterized by its length and verbosity, its use of sentimental imagery and themes, and its wistful tone. Moreover, romantic poetry tends to romanticize the past, longing for a time that is more innocent and pure than the big bad future. The past can be relatively recent, as in the times of mothers and grandmothers; or the past may refer to the classical era of history and ancient civilizations. During a time of industrialization and urbanization, a more pastoral past also became a common subject for discussion. A return to a simpler life, and an appreciation for nature, were also themes shared by all the romantic era poets. John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \"Snow-bound\" fills all the criteria for romantic poetry, and may even be the quintessential American romantic era poem. In \"Snow-bound,\" a family is trapped inside their New England cabin. They use the opportunity for self-reflection, musing on the past, and bonding over their experiences. Natural imagery pervades the poem, which is narrative in style and epic in scope.\n\nGeoff Goodfellow is a famous Australian poet named the peoples poet who has had a hard and eventful life. His biggest battle to date is his recent battle with cancer. He got told that his life was about to come to an end in the next five years but what he had got taught from growing up in the northern streets of Adelaide was to never back down from a fight and this was going to be his biggest battle to date.\n\nPaul Revere's Ride is a collection of historical accounts centering around Paul Revere's midnight ride to warn the countryside of the battles that occurred. The novel is made up of narrative accounts that tell the whole story of the midnight ride. David Hackett Fischer goes to great lengths to cover every possible angle in telling the story. \"Fischer illuminates the figure of Paul Revere, a man far more complex than a simple artisan and messenger\"(3). By adding different perspectives he allows the reader to see not only the American idealistic point of view, but we get a chance to hear British accounts of these particular events. In this way Hackett Fischer paints an accurate and unbiased picture not only of Paul\n\nIn 1774, the Liberty Boys, spied on British men and met regularly to give information. Four years after his midnight ride, Paul Revere served as commander of land artillery in the catastrophic Penobscot Expedition of 1779. Paul Revere is usually most remembered for his horsemanship. He is also known for his contributions from his hammer and chisel. His ability to appeal to the colonial people through works of his copper engravings demonstrated the power of propaganda. After the War, Revere increased his business to open an iron foundry at the North End of Boston making utilitarian cast iron products that were useful and widely purchased by the local people. He also opened a copper mill which made bells for churches and rolled copper for the hulls of wooden ships. All of this demonstrated that Paul Revere was a man of great talents, and was therefore indispensable to Boston’s fame in resisting the authority of the British Parliament and King George III. Paul Revere did not gain immediate fame for his April 1775 Midnight Ride. In fact, it wasn't until Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, which greatly abolished Revere's act, that he became the folk hero we think of\n\nThe two documents Paul Revere’s Ride, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and the letter from Paul Revere to DR. Jeremy Belknap that was written in 1798. The letter written for Jeremy Belknap is about “Paul Revere’s Ride” including other people had warned him about British and that was running from British but after he fled them woke up a captain and that told almost every house until he got to Lexington. While the poem Paul Revere’s Ride, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is mainly about how he rode to Lexington warning people it does not include and details or facts about him running into many British soldiers or being warned by other people about British soldiers ahead.\n\nIn 1860, less than one hundred years after the event in which it is based on, the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere was immortalized in a children’s poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The poem became an instant classic and is mostly remembered by the opening line, “Listen my children and you shall hear, of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.” Written at a time when the United States was on the brink of a Civil War, it made some accurate accounts of what happened that night however, it was a children’s poem therefore a lot of the events were distorted and dramatized. The most important being, Paul Revere was not alone on his “Midnight Ride” as the poem says. William Dawes Jr. and Dr. Samuel Prescott also rode with him that night. Whatever\n\nPaul Revere was a jack of all trades. He was a Silversmith, early industrialist, and a patriot In the American Revolution. He is best known for his mid-night ride before The Battle of Lexington. During the ride he said “The British are coming one if by land and two if by sea”. Paul was one of the most important people in the 13 Colonies at that time. He played one of the biggest parts in the american revolution.\n\nFirst of, “Paul Revere’s ride in 1860,during the turbulent times when the United States was on the brink of civil war.” Some of the people didn’t know how he was or anything like that he might have been a normal person. “How accurate was longfellow poem?” The author was Franklin Johnson, “Paul Revere and the American Revolution” by: Ethel Ames, and “Paul Revere’s Ride” written By: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. What I have learned in the “Paul Revere and the American Revolution” was that on April 18, 1775, that Revere was sent to Lexington so he can warn the American leaders, Samuel Adams and John Hancock that the British troops were on their way to arrest them and then seize weapons being stored in Concord. How it was accurate is by that"
