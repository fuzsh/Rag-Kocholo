        "text": "(1807–82). Probably the best-loved American poet the world over is Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He was among the first American writers to use native themes. In such memorable works as The Song of Hiawatha, Evangeline, and The Courtship of Miles Standish, he wrote about the American scene and landscape. The early American settlers had concentrated on carving a place to live out of the wilderness. Their literature, painting, and music came mainly from Europe, especially from England. But the American Renaissance, an era of great American literary creativity, took place during Longfellow’s lifetime, and he made a great contribution to it. (See also American literature, “The Flowering of American Literature.”)\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow was the son of Stephen Longfellow and Zilpah Wadsworth Longfellow. He was born on February 27, 1807, in Portland, Massachusetts (now in Maine). From early childhood it was evident that he was to be drawn to writing and the power of words. His father was eager to have his son become a lawyer. But when Henry was a senior at Bowdoin College (Maine), he asserted his ambition in a letter to his father: “I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature.”\n\nThe year after he graduated from college at age 18, Longfellow set out for Europe to become a scholar and a linguist. He traveled in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and England before returning to the United States in 1829. At 22 he began his career as a college professor at Bowdoin College. In 1831 he married Mary Storer Porter, a former schoolmate. While at Bowdoin he expended his energies on translations from old-world literature, contributed travel sketches to the New-England Magazine, and served as a professor and librarian.\n\nIn 1835 Longfellow was appointed to a professorship at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and once more set out for Europe by way of preparation. On this trip, his wife died in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Saddened by her death, Longfellow stayed for a time in Heidelberg, Germany, where he fell under the influence of German Romanticism. In 1836 he returned to Massachusetts and took a room at Craigie House, a historic building near the Charles River. In time the ownership of the house passed into his hands. Seven years after he came to Harvard, Longfellow married Frances Appleton, and Craigie House was given to the couple by her father as a wedding gift.\n\nBy this time Longfellow had already published some poetry, and his work had achieved immediate popularity. In 1841 his Ballads and Other Poems, containing such favorites as “The Wreck of the Hesperus” and “The Village Blacksmith,” swept the country. From his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne he got the brief outline of a story from which he compiled one of his most famous poems, Evangeline, a Tale of Acadie, published in 1847. It is a sentimental tale of two lovers separated when British soldiers expel the Acadians (French colonists) from what is now Nova Scotia, Canada. The lovers, Evangeline and Gabriel, are reunited years later as Gabriel is dying.\n\nFeeling that his work as a teacher was a hindrance to his writing, Longfellow resigned his post at Harvard in 1854. In June of that year he began The Song of Hiawatha, a long poem about a legendary Ojibwa Indian named Hiawatha. After various mythic feats, Ojibwa becomes his people’s leader and marries Minnehaha before departing for the Isles of the Blessed. The poem’s publication in 1855 caused a literary sensation. For the first time in American literature, Indian themes gained recognition as sources of imagination and originality.\n\nThe colonial legend of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins next inspired the poet, and in 1858 The Courtship of Miles Standish was published. This romantic ode quickly became one of Longfellow’s most popular works.\n\nIn 1861 the happy family life of the poet came to an end. His second wife died of burns she received when a keepsake package of her children’s curls, which she was sealing with matches and wax, burst into flame. Longfellow found solace in translating Dante into English and traveled to Europe for a change of scenery.\n\nLongfellow’s Tales of a Wayside Inn, modeled roughly on Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, was published in 1863. The first poem in the collection, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” became a national favorite.\n\nLongfellow’s final years were filled with honors. He was given honorary degrees by the universities at Oxford and Cambridge in England. He was invited to an audience with Queen Victoria. He was chosen a member of the Russian Academy of Science and of the Spanish Academy. Longfellow died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on March 24, 1882.\n\nAmong Longfellow’s other published works are: Outre-Mer (European travel sketches, 1835), Voices of the Night (his first book of poems, 1839), The Belfry of Bruges (1846), The Seaside and the Fireside (1850), The Golden Legend (1851), The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri (a translation, 1865–67), The Masque of Pandora (1875), Kéramos and Other Poems (1878), Ultima Thule (1880), and In the Harbor (1882)."
