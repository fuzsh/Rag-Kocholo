        "text": "While at dinner on December 1, 1863, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow received a telegram. His son had been severely wounded in a skirmish on November 27, 1863. A bullet entered Charles’ left shoulder, passing through his back and clipping the spine before exiting the under the right shoulder blade. The elder Longfellow immediately set out for Washington, arriving there on December 3. After two more days of waiting, Charles arrived by train in the nation’s capital. According to the poet, “[t]he army surgeon who came with the wounded alarmed me by saying that his duty to himself and to me required him to say that the wound was very serious one and paralysis might ensue.” That evening, three more surgeons gave another more favorable report. Charles “will be long in healing,” but he it will be at least six months before he can return to the service. In fact, though Charles survived his wound, his military career was over. In summarizing the ordeal to a friend, the Henry Longfellow wrote, “I have been through a great deal of trouble and anxiety.” This “trouble and anxiety” is evident in the lines of the poem, “Christmas Bells”—the basis for the popular Christmas carol.\n\nI heard the bells on Christmas Day\n\nTheir old, familiar carols play,\n\nand wild and sweet\n\nThe words repeat\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nAnd thought how, as the day had come,\n\nThe belfries of all Christendom\n\nHad rolled along\n\nThe unbroken song\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nTill ringing, singing on its way,\n\nThe world revolved from night to day,\n\nA voice, a chime,\n\nA chant sublime\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nThen from each black, accursed mouth\n\nThe cannon thundered in the South,\n\nAnd with the sound\n\nThe carols drowned\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nIt was as if an earthquake rent\n\nThe hearth-stones of a continent,\n\nAnd made forlorn\n\nThe households born\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nAnd in despair I bowed my head;\n\n\"There is no peace on earth,\" I said;\n\n\"For hate is strong,\n\nAnd mocks the song\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\""
