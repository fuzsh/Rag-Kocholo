        "text": "Thursday, August 18, 2011\n\nAlabama Girls' Industrial School\n\nAlabama Girls' Industrial School\n\n​\n\nLocation: Montevallo, Alabama, USA\n\n​\n\nFounded: 1896\n\n​\n\nClosed: Began admitting men in 1956\n\n​\n\nFrom the University of Montevallo website:\n\n​\n\nIn October of 1896, the Alabama Girls’ Industrial School opened its doors to some 150 young women from all parts of the state. They had come to participate in a great experiment, in an innovation in education for Alabama. They had come to be trained to be teachers, bookkeepers, artists, musicians, dressmakers, telegraphers and milliners. In other words, at last, there was a school in Alabama whose purpose was to educate women to be self-supporting; at last, here was an opportunity to escape from the drudgery of field work, mill work or from the ignominy of depending on a father or brother for lifelong support if there was no husband. At last, here was an opportunity for young women to expand their minds and dreams in a state, poverty-stricken by economic circumstances, that could provide little public education for its citizens.\n\n​\n\nThe school had its beginnings with the dream of Julia Tutwiler, a proponent of education for women, and the vision of Senator Solomon Bloch, who introduced the bill in the Alabama Legislature establishing the school. On October 12, 1896, their efforts—and the efforts of scores of townspeople and other advocates—bore fruit with the opening of the school on that crisp fall day.\n\n​\n\nOf course, the first president chosen was a man (they nearly always were, even at women's schools). This despite the fact that Julia Strudwick Tutwiler (1841-1916) was an accomplished educator, prison reformer, writer, and outspoken proponent of education for women. Like many proponents of women's education, Tutwiler attended a women's college (Vassar) while also receiving additional training at Washington & Lee College and other schools in France and Germany. Tutwiler later became the first (and only) woman president of the Livingston State Normal School (later the University of West Alabama). Though it's impossible to review her entire life's work here, it is interesting to note that Tutwiler's prison reform work included the establishment of the first separate prison facility for women in the state of Alabama.\n\n​\n\nBy 1899, more than 400 students were enrolled at the Alabama Girls' Industrial School. By 1908, the school had acquired its \"first ghost\" when Condie Cunningham died in a dormitory fire. The tale is spun this way:\n\n​\n\nOn the evening of February 4, 1908, Sophomore Condie Cunningham and her roommate were attempting to melt chocolate for fudge in a chafing dish. They missed one curfew bell and when the second bell rang at 10 PM, they tried to put away the dish. Alcohol from the burner spilled and ignited Cunningham’s dress. Startled, she ran and the flames burned her severely. She died two days later. According to the librarian, this information was gleaned from the minutes of a board of trustees meeting. This lines up with the legend.\n\n​\n\nNot long after Cunningham’s death, residents began to report the screams of cries of a young woman. The grains of the wood on the girl’s former dorm room began to show a screaming face and the door was replaced. The door still resides in storage and does bear some likeness to a screaming face.\n\n​\n\nShortly therafter, the school underwent a number of rapid name changes:\n\n​\n\nIn 1911 AGIS became Alabama Girls’ Technical Institute. The phrase “and College for Women” was added in 1919. The Class of 1919 observed that “now that our school is becoming a college, we have begun to take up college stunts,” and College Night began on March 3. High school courses were gradually phased out and, in 1923, the school became Alabama College, State College for Women, a degree-granting institution.\n\n​\n\nOf course, it was too good to last:\n\n​\n\nFor 60 years, student expression had a decidedly feminine perspective at Montevallo, but in January 1956 that began to change. Backed by Alabama College’s board of trustees, administration, faculty, alumnae association and eventually the student body, the state legislature passed a bill on January 15, dropping the designation “State College for Women” and enabling the college to admit male students.\n\n​\n\nTwo men enrolled at Alabama College in January 1956. By September there were 35 men on campus, and a new era had begun. Seven years later total enrollment had tripled, and more than 40 percent of the students were men.\n\n​\n\nAlabama College was renamed the University of Montevallo in 1969.\n\n​\n\nPhotos: Students at the Alabama Girls' Industrial School, Students drinking sodas in the \"tea room\" at Alabama College (1944)\n\nFrom PCUSA NEWS <PCUSA.NEWS@ECUNET.ORG>\n\nDate Wed, 9 Mar 2005 12:36:05 -0600\n\n​\n\nNote #8661 from PCUSA NEWS to PRESBYNEWS:\n\n​\n\n05127\n\nMarch 7, 2005\n\n​\n\nIt's official: Mary Holmes is closed\n\n​\n\nHistoric Presbyterian college comes to an inglorious end\n\n​\n\nby Evan Silverstein\n\n​\n\nLOUISVILLE - The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has officially hung a \"closed\"\n\nsign on the door of troubled Mary Holmes College in West Point, MS.\n\n​\n\nThe denomination's Office of Racial Ethnic Schools and Colleges\n\nannounced the official closing in a press release dated March 3.\n\n​\n\nThe shutdown had appeared inevitable since the Mary Holmes College\n\nBoard of Trustees voted on Aug. 22, 2003 to suspend operations of the\n\nfinancially strapped, 113-year-old private college about 40 miles south of\n\nTupelo in northeast Mississippi.\n\n​\n\nThe Presbyterian-related college, which has a long tradition of\n\neducating African-American students, did not open for classes in the fall of\n\n2003 and had remained closed to students ever since.\n\n​\n\nBankruptcy proceedings are nearing the final stages.\n\n​\n\nThe closing of the historic, two-year college was widely known, but\n\nthere had been no official announcement from Mary Holmes or PC(USA)\n\nofficials. Until now.\n\n​\n\n\"The school leaves behind a legacy of great importance to the\n\ncommunity and to the church,\" Beneva Bibbs, associate for the PC(USA)'s\n\nRacial Ethnic Schools and Colleges, told the Presbyterian News Service. \"Our\n\nfocus and remembrance should be on the number of students who passed through\n\nthis school's rich and illustrious 113-year-history.\"\n\n​\n\nMary Holmes, which was supported partially by Christmas Joy Offering\n\nfunds, faced mounting financial pressures in recent years, many caused by\n\ndeclining enrollment and a deteriorating physical plant. It had lost its\n\naccreditation and access to federal education funds.\n\n​\n\nThe school's trustees voted on April 22, 2004 to file for Chapter 11\n\nbankruptcy protection, beginning a process that should be completed this\n\nspring.\n\n​\n\nThe PC(USA), which owned most of the 100-acre campus, assumed\n\ncontrol of the property last month.\n\n​\n\nThe Mary Holmes board had delayed a vote to close because the\n\nbankruptcy proceedings involved the dissolution of \"the Mary Holmes\n\nCorporation,\" according to Joey Bailey, the PC(USA)'s executive vice\n\npresident, chief financial officer and treasurer.\n\n​\n\n\"When the final gavel comes down on the bankruptcy, which\n\nwill be sometime between March 10th and May 30th, there officially will be no\n\nMary Holmes,\" Bailey said. \"It will have no operating entity.\"\n\n​\n\nAn initial report on the status of the property will be presented\n\nlater this month to the PC(USA)'s National Ministries Division and Mission\n\nSupport Services committees of the General Assembly Council (GAC), which will\n\nconsider what should be done with the school's remaining assets.\n\n​\n\nAn office administrator and a maintenance worker are the only two\n\nremaining staff members, according to the news release.\n\n​\n\n\"Student records and other vital statistics will be maintained at the\n\ncampus for the immediate future,\" it said. \"The property and grounds are\n\nbeing evaluated and monitored, including two buildings that will likely be\n\ndemolished due to safety concerns.\"\n\n​\n\nFor decades, Mary Holmes, with its open enrollment policy and\n\nfinancial-aid programs, gave many young people an opportunity to attend\n\ncollege who otherwise may have not had the chance, some Presbyterians said\n\nlast week in commenting on the long-anticipated closure.\n\n​\n\n\"Mary Holmes made it possible for the dreams of young\n\nAfrican-Americans in Mississippi and from all over the country to be\n\nfulfilled, dreams that otherwise would likely have been denied,\" said the\n\nRev. Curtis Kearns, director of the PC(USA)'s National Ministries Division,\n\nwhich oversees the denomination's office of Racial Ethnic Schools and\n\nColleges.\n\n​\n\n\"While it is sad to see this rich tradition come to a close,\" Kearns\n\nsaid, \"we believe that the luster of its distinctive history and its\n\ncontribution to the church and society will never fade, but will live on in\n\nits alumni.\"\n\n​\n\nJack Baugh, a former chairman of the Mary Holmes board, said it\n\nimproved the lives of many young people: \"Oh yes. Very definitely. Very\n\ndefinitely.\"\n\n​\n\nBaugh, also a former GAC member, said last week that many Mary Holmes\n\nstudents were able to advance to four-year institutions and continue working\n\ntoward better futures.\n\n​\n\n\"Mary Holmes would take those people that couldn't pass that\n\n(college entrance) test and get them turned around,\" he said. \"Most of them,\n\nthey'd later get into a four-year college and away they'd go, with a very\n\nhigh success rate.\"\n\n​\n\nMary Holmes board members Thomas Hood of St. Louis, MO, and Mary\n\nDavidson, of Woodland, MS, did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\n​\n\nMary Homes College found itself about $2.5 million in debt after\n\nyears of poor management and low enrollment, said Heather Lee, the\n\nBirmingham, AL attorney handling the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n​\n\n\"Typically this is a reorganization,\" Lee said. \"In this case, it\n\nalso can be used as a way to orderly liquidate. ... The church already owned\n\nthe great majority of the real property on the campus, and we just\n\nessentially liquidated what was left.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Mary Holmes debt includes a $456,000 loan approved by the GAC in\n\n2001 and $491,000 borrowed from the U.S. Department of Education for\n\nrenovation of a dormitory, Lee said.\n\n​\n\nShe said it also owes about $500,000 to Great Western Dining, a\n\nfood-services company, and more than $100,000 to the Internal Revenue Service\n\nfor payroll taxes the school had withheld.\n\n​\n\n\"At first we were trying to restructure,\" Lee said. \"We tried for\n\nseveral months for another school to come in. We just tried to reduce debt.\n\n... But it was just too late. There was too much debt at that point.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) dropped the\n\ncollege from its membership rolls in December 2002. Without accreditation\n\nfrom SACS or a similar agency, Mary Holmes was ineligible for federal\n\nfunding, the source of financial aid for almost every student.\n\n​\n\n\"What prompted the whole bankruptcy was the loss of accreditation,\"\n\nLee said. \"I mean, period. That did it.\"\n\n​\n\nMary Holmes College, founded in 1892 by the Presbyterian Church's\n\nBoard of Missions for Freedmen, was known originally as Mary Holmes Seminary.\n\nIt was named for the wife and mother of the school's principal founders, the\n\nRev. Mead Holmes and his daughter, Mary, who wanted to honor the senior Mary\n\nHolmes for having dedicated her life to helping former slaves.\n\n​\n\nThe school, then in Jackson, MS, originally was dedicated to the\n\nChristian education of young women \"in the domestic sciences.\" Private\n\nschools like Mary Holmes became the primary producers of black teachers in\n\nthe American South.\n\n​\n\nEventually the school opened its doors to male students. In 1959 it\n\ndropped its high school program and became Mary Holmes Junior College.\n\n​\n\nMary Holmes was owned and operated for many years by the Board of\n\nNational Missions of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States\n\nAmerica, the old \"northern church,\" a predecessor denomination of the\n\nPC(USA).\n\n​\n\n\"The Presbyterian Church has a rich history of supporting education\n\nbecause we believe that God expects us to approach and express our faith with\n\nour whole being - body, mind and spirit,\" said Allison Seed, chair of the\n\nGAC's National Ministries Division committee. \"This demands that we come to\n\nthe gospel prepared to the best of our ability. ... Mary Holmes College has\n\nprovided that preparation for countless students over the years.\"\n\n​\n\nTo subscribe or unsubscribe, please send an email to\n\npcusanews-subscribe-request@halak.pcusa.org or\n\npcusanews-unsubscribe-request@halak.pcusa.org\n\n​\n\nTo contact the owner of the list, please send an email to\n\npcusanews-request@halak.pcusa.org"
