        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (born February 27, 1807 – died March 24, 1882) was an American poet of the Romantic period. He served as a professor at Harvard University and was an adept linguist, traveling throughout Europe and immersing himself in European culture and poetry, which he emulated in his poetry. Before television, radio, and film, he rose to become not just the leading poet and literary figure of 19th-century America, but also an American icon and household name.\n\n10 Greatest Poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nby Satyananda Sarangi\n\nPicking just 10 is a tricky equation when it concerns the works of a poet as prolific as Longfellow. From being a cornerstone of American poetry and culture to being the most widely read poet in his lifetime, he dared to establish this very fact that Romanticism wasn’t confined to Europe (or British poets to be precise). With numerous translations from various languages, such as Spanish, German, and Italian, his popularity was perhaps something that any poet could only dream of.\n\nIt is an uphill task to compile his best ten, since many of his celebrated pieces like Paul Revere’s Ride, The Song of Hiawatha, Evangeline – A Tale of Acadie, The Wreck of the Hesperus, The Building of the Ship and My Lost Youth are long. For simplicity and convenience, I have stuck to his English poems that run not more than 60 lines. (Read an excellent essay on The Wreck of the Hesperus here)\n\nHere goes the list:\n\n10. “Haunted Houses” (1858)\n\nAll houses wherein men have lived and died\n\n__Are haunted houses. Through the open doors\n\nThe harmless phantoms on their errands glide,\n\n__With feet that make no sound upon the floors.\n\nWe meet them at the doorway, on the stair,\n\n__Along the passages they come and go,\n\nImpalpable impressions on the air,\n\n__A sense of something moving to and fro.\n\nThere are more guests at table, than the hosts\n\n__Invited; the illuminated hall\n\nIs thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,\n\n__As silent as the pictures on the wall.\n\nThe stranger at my fireside cannot see\n\n__The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;\n\nHe but perceives what is; while unto me\n\n__All that has been is visible and clear.\n\nWe have no title-deeds to house or lands;\n\n__Owners and occupants of earlier dates\n\nFrom graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,\n\n__And hold in mortmain still their old estates.\n\nThe spirit-world around this world of sense\n\n__Floats like an atmosphere, and everywhere\n\nWafts through these earthly mists and vapors dense\n\n__A vital breath of more ethereal air.\n\nOur little lives are kept in equipoise\n\n__By opposite attractions and desires;\n\nThe struggle of the instinct that enjoys,\n\n__And the more noble instinct that aspires.\n\nThese perturbations, this perpetual jar\n\n__Of earthly wants and aspirations high,\n\nCome from the influence of an unseen star,\n\n__An undiscovered planet in our sky.\n\nAnd as the moon from some dark gate of cloud\n\n__Throws o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,\n\nAcross whose trembling planks our fancies crowd\n\n__Into the realm of mystery and night,–\n\nSo from the world of spirits there descends\n\n__A bridge of light, connecting it with this,\n\nO’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,\n\n__Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.\n\nWritten at a time when he was already renowned, Longfellow showcases his brilliance and versatility in what seems a ghostly poem at first. But then subtlety takes over and the reader is introduced to how psychic phenomena and worldly desires may go hand in hand. The salient feature of this discussion is the gradual shift from after-world powers to how they govern the ambitions and aspirations of mortals. Quite strange it appears, yet the mention of ‘unseen planet’ and ‘ undiscovered planet’ further stress that uncanny forces may have had some role in the choices we make in this real world. A vivid imagery towards the end where ‘the moonlight is perceived to be a bridge’ turns out to be the icing on the cake. The poet is quite brave in pulling this off. Keeping in mind his inclination to romantic and sentimental works, he is aware of what he is best at.\n\n9. “The Rainy Day” (1842)\n\nThe day is cold, and dark, and dreary;\n\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\n\nThe vine still clings to the mouldering wall,\n\nBut at every gust the dead leaves fall,\n\nAnd the day is dark and dreary.\n\nMy life is cold, and dark, and dreary;\n\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\n\nMy thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past,\n\nBut the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,\n\nAnd the days are dark and dreary.\n\nBe still, sad heart! and cease repining;\n\nBehind the clouds is the sun still shining;\n\nThy fate is the common fate of all,\n\nInto each life some rain must fall,\n\nSome days must be dark and dreary.\n\nHow often has one come across a Longfellow poem that speaks of hope and optimism after taking us through gloomy lanes and cloudy circumstances? Relatively young at the time of this publication, the poet prefers the lines to be conveyed from the viewpoint of an old, ageing person pondering over his past and youth. Drawing a parallel between life and a bleak day works out well where the ‘vine’ symbolises ‘thoughts’ and ‘dead leaves’ are helpless as is the lost youth. A major portion of the poem relies on metaphorical effect, quite clearly an inherent skill of great Romantic bards. The closing quintain is a boost – everyone is put through rough patches to be able to win ; the universal anthem being that adversity (referred to as the rain) is inevitable and is the mother of success, for the lessons of ‘dark days’ are what bear the bright ones.\n\n8. “Nature” (1878)\n\nAs a fond mother, when the day is o’er,\n\nLeads by the hand her little child to bed,\n\nHalf willing, half reluctant to be led,\n\nAnd leave his broken playthings on the floor,\n\nStill gazing at them through the open door,\n\nNor wholly reassured and comforted\n\nBy promises of others in their stead,\n\nWhich, though more splendid, may not please him more;\n\nSo Nature deals with us, and takes away\n\nOur playthings one by one, and by the hand\n\nLeads us to rest so gently, that we go\n\nScarce knowing if we wish to go or stay,\n\nBeing too full of sleep to understand\n\nHow far the unknown transcends the what we know.\n\nThe universal truth of ‘death’ has been used as a touching subject time and again. However, monotony looms large but what stand out here are the uniqueness and the well thought out lines by a rather growing old poet. In fact this piece is a metaphor in its entirety and deserves a place in all time death poems alongside Donne’s ‘Death Be Not Proud’ and Shirley’s ‘Death – The Leveller’. In the format of the Italian sonnet (or Petrarchan sonnet) with a simple rhyme, the act of a mother taking her child to bed has been compared to how nature takes each of us to death. In both the actions, one seems reluctant – considering how a child wishes to play even at late night and how life wishes to continue even when one is too old. The ‘playthings’ are the bonds we share, the ‘rest’ is death that sneaks in and our ‘so gentle’ departure, an unsolved mystery in itself.\n\n7. “The Cross of Snow” (1879)\n\nIn the long, sleepless watches of the night,\n\nA gentle face—the face of one long dead—\n\nLooks at me from the wall, where round its head\n\nThe night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.\n\nHere in this room she died; and soul more white\n\nNever through martyrdom of fire was led\n\nTo its repose; nor can in books be read\n\nThe legend of a life more benedight.\n\nThere is a mountain in the distant West\n\nThat, sun-defying, in its deep ravines\n\nDisplays a cross of snow upon its side.\n\nSuch is the cross I wear upon my breast\n\nThese eighteen years, through all the changing scenes\n\nAnd seasons, changeless since the day she died.\n\nIn the words of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, ‘Poetry comes from the highest happiness or the deepest sorrow’; ‘The Cross of Snow’ being an expression of the latter. Simple yet striking, straight forward and drawn from a real life of hardships and mishaps, this sonnet goes down as one of his memorable tributes to Frances Appleton, his deceased wife and the portrayal of his sadness owing to her absence. Much pivotal to the emotional aspects are ‘sleepless’, ‘halo of pale light’ and ‘gentle face’. The reason of her death referred to as ‘ martyrdom of fire’ and the comparison between the natural landscape’s cross and the cross of Christ donned by the poet himself lend a powerful emotional quotient to the poem – a characteristic of most of his serious poetry in later life. Delving further into the reference made to ‘the cross’, ‘cross’ depicts the poet’s longing, seen as a lifelong burden that he has to bear.\n\n6. “The Ladder of St. Augustine” (1858)\n\nSaint Augustine! well hast thou said,\n\n__That of our vices we can frame\n\nA ladder, if we will but tread\n\n__Beneath our feet each deed of shame!\n\nAll common things, each day’s events,\n\n__That with the hour begin and end,\n\nOur pleasures and our discontents,\n\n__Are rounds by which we may ascend.\n\nThe low desire, the base design,\n\n__That makes another’s virtues less;\n\nThe revel of the ruddy wine,\n\n__And all occasions of excess;\n\nThe longing for ignoble things;\n\n__The strife for triumph more than truth;\n\nThe hardening of the heart, that brings\n\n__Irreverence for the dreams of youth;\n\nAll thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,\n\n__That have their root in thoughts of ill;\n\nWhatever hinders or impedes\n\n__The action of the nobler will;—\n\nAll these must first be trampled down\n\n__Beneath our feet, if we would gain\n\nIn the bright fields of fair renown\n\n__The right of eminent domain.\n\nWe have not wings, we cannot soar;\n\n__But we have feet to scale and climb\n\nBy slow degrees, by more and more,\n\n__The cloudy summits of our time.\n\nThe mighty pyramids of stone\n\n__That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,\n\nWhen nearer seen, and better known,\n\n__Are but gigantic flights of stairs.\n\nThe distant mountains, that uprear\n\n__Their solid bastions to the skies,\n\nAre crossed by pathways, that appear\n\n__As we to higher levels rise.\n\nThe heights by great men reached and kept\n\n__Were not attained by sudden flight,\n\nBut they, while their companions slept,\n\n__Were toiling upward in the night.\n\nStanding on what too long we bore\n\n__With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,\n\nWe may discern—unseen before—\n\n__A path to higher destinies.\n\nNor deem the irrevocable Past,\n\n__As wholly wasted, wholly vain,\n\nIf, rising on its wrecks, at last\n\n__To something nobler we attain.\n\nFinally, we arrive at one such poem that gives the impression of the typical Longfellow verse – inspiring with lofty ideals that lift the spirit no matter what. The whole of this, if summarised, is a clarion call for rising to the occasion, employing symbols that are not at all imaginative but truths encountered through life. Beginning from what St. Augustine has preached in Christianity, the poet lays out the negative qualities of man, ultimately resulting in hindrances to his betterment by the usage of ‘longing for ignoble things’, ‘strife for triumph more than truth ‘and ‘all occasions of excess’. The magnificent imagery is taken good care of by ‘cloudy summits of our time’, ‘gigantic flights of stairs’ and ‘solid bastions to the skies’ – the predictable manner in which the poet makes very fine use of poetic devices. The clear message delivered is that we need to have patience to pursue our goals; for Rome was not built in a day.\n\n“The heights by great men reached and kept\n\nWere not attained by sudden flight,\n\nBut they, while their companions slept,\n\nWere toiling upward in the night.”\n\nMoreover, this quatrain continues to be one of the most popular even today.\n\n5. “Excelsior” (1842)\n\nThe shades of night were falling fast,\n\nAs through an Alpine village passed\n\nA youth, who bore, ‘mid snow and ice,\n\nA banner with the strange device,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\nHis brow was sad; his eye beneath,\n\nFlashed like a falchion from its sheath,\n\nAnd like a silver clarion rung\n\nThe accents of that unknown tongue,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\nIn happy homes he saw the light\n\nOf household fires gleam warm and bright;\n\nAbove, the spectral glaciers shone,\n\nAnd from his lips escaped a groan,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\n“Try not the Pass!” the old man said;\n\n“Dark lowers the tempest overhead,\n\nThe roaring torrent is deep and wide!\n\nAnd loud that clarion voice replied,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\n“Oh stay,” the maiden said, “and rest\n\nThy weary head upon this breast!”\n\nA tear stood in his bright blue eye,\n\nBut still he answered, with a sigh,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\n“Beware the pine-tree’s withered branch!\n\nBeware the awful avalanche!”\n\nThis was the peasant’s last Good-night,\n\nA voice replied, far up the height,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\nAt break of day, as heavenward\n\nThe pious monks of Saint Bernard\n\nUttered the oft-repeated prayer,\n\nA voice cried through the startled air,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\nA traveller, by the faithful hound,\n\nHalf-buried in the snow was found,\n\nStill grasping in his hand of ice\n\nThat banner with the strange device,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\nThere in the twilight cold and gray,\n\nLifeless, but beautiful, he lay,\n\nAnd from the sky, serene and far,\n\nA voice fell, like a falling star,\n\n__Excelsior!\n\nFrom the ‘Ballads and Other Poems’, this short poem is obvious at the surface, though it caters to a very different idea. It possesses a deviation from typical ‘aim higher’ themes that have been the poet’s speciality as seen in the previous poem. ‘Excelsior’ – a Latin word meaning ‘still higher’ is somewhat the engine that drives the plot; its repetition after every stanza points towards a ‘warning’ bell to the protagonist (a young man) as well as to every reader. The description captures the mammoth task ahead of the young mountaineer by phrases such as ‘snow and ice’, ‘tempest overhead’, ‘the roaring torrent’ and ‘the awful avalanche’. Although he is shown as brave and steadfast in his vision, the successive warnings issued to him by an old man, a maiden and then the peasant convince us that the errand is way too much. Often in life, we take a hard stance on matters and the realisation comes when all’s done and dusted. Determination and perseverance are essential, but a wise person knows where to draw the line; the ending quatrain is just like the consolation we may have to ourselves. Now, what is more appealing about ‘Excelsior’ is its tone, a complete contrast to the tone in ‘The Ladder of St. Augustine’. However, as one may notice, the ill of ‘the strife for triumph more than truth’ from the latter is a similarity between the two poems. As a matter of fact, ‘Excelsior’ continues to be a widely anthologised piece.\n\n4. “The Reapers and the Flowers” (1839)\n\nThere is a Reaper, whose name is Death,\n\n__And, with his sickle keen,\n\nHe reaps the bearded grain at a breath,\n\n__And the flowers that grow between.\n\n“Shall I have naught that is fair?” saith he;\n\n__“Have naught but the bearded grain?\n\nThough the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,\n\n__I will give them all back again.”\n\nHe gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,\n\n__He kissed their drooping leaves;\n\nIt was for the Lord of Paradise\n\n__He bound them in his sheaves.\n\n“My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,”\n\n__The Reaper said, and smiled;\n\n“Dear tokens of the earth are they,\n\n__Where He was once a child.\n\n“They shall all bloom in fields of light,\n\n__Transplanted by my care,\n\nAnd saints, upon their garments white,\n\n__These sacred blossoms wear.”\n\nAnd the mother gave, in tears and pain,\n\n__The flowers she most did love;\n\nShe knew she should find them all again\n\n__In the fields of light above.\n\nOh, not in cruelty, not in wrath,\n\n__The Reaper came that day;\n\n‘T was an angel visited the green earth,\n\n__And took the flowers away.\n\nThroughout the narration, there hasn’t been any direct reference to the characters and events. A young Longfellow is more than adept at personification – this is what takes us by surprise and despite very loose meter, ‘The Reapers and the Flowers’ manages to break into the top five. When ‘Death’ is the reaper who takes along with him ‘the old’ otherwise shown as ‘bearded grains’ and sometimes even ‘flowers’ (the youth), one may predict how the poem would end. The mother, who represents the earth symbolically, is assured that her children (flowers) would find a better home in ‘fields of light above’ (heaven) and in spite of her love, she gives them away. However, the poet decides to render it a twist i.e. the reaper who took the flowers that day must’ve been some angel sent by God, as revealed in the last stanza. The greatest quality of this poem lies in its deeper layers of allegory. This short ballad is believed to point out yet another event from the poet’s life – the miscarriage suffered by his first wife, Mary Potter around that time. Having a basic meaning to itself, the figurative language elevates this piece to a higher level, for it paraphrases ‘Whom the Gods love, die young’.\n\n3. “The Children’s Hour” (1863)\n\nBetween the dark and the daylight,\n\n__When the night is beginning to lower,\n\nComes a pause in the day’s occupations,\n\n__That is known as the Children’s Hour.\n\nI hear in the chamber above me\n\n__The patter of little feet,\n\nThe sound of a door that is opened,\n\n__And voices soft and sweet.\n\nFrom my study I see in the lamplight,\n\n__Descending the broad hall stair,\n\nGrave Alice, and laughing Allegra,\n\n__And Edith with golden hair.\n\nA whisper, and then a silence:\n\n__Yet I know by their merry eyes\n\nThey are plotting and planning together\n\n__To take me by surprise.\n\nA sudden rush from the stairway,\n\n__A sudden raid from the hall!\n\nBy three doors left unguarded\n\n__They enter my castle wall!\n\nThey climb up into my turret\n\n__O’er the arms and back of my chair;\n\nIf I try to escape, they surround me;\n\n__They seem to be everywhere.\n\nThey almost devour me with kisses,\n\n__Their arms about me entwine,\n\nTill I think of the Bishop of Bingen\n\n__In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!\n\nDo you think, O blue-eyed banditti,\n\n__Because you have scaled the wall,\n\nSuch an old mustache as I am\n\n__Is not a match for you all!\n\nI have you fast in my fortress,\n\n__And will not let you depart,\n\nBut put you down into the dungeon\n\n__In the round-tower of my heart.\n\nAnd there will I keep you forever,\n\n__Yes, forever and a day,\n\nTill the walls shall crumble to ruin,\n\n__And moulder in dust away!\n\nOne often wonders how Longfellow comes up with such a merry, simple poem which he not only manages to write well, but also immortalises his three daughters by including them in it. This piece brings forth a welcome relief to readers and to the poet himself, as more serious poetry was what he was used to penning then. In the very first stanza, he refers to a brief period in the evening as ‘the children’s hour’ when he, otherwise occupied in his study, has some time to spare for his children. Seen as bit grave for most of the time, Longfellow lets the sweet and lovely father figure of himself take centerstage – unusual yet genuine in expressing his love. When Alice, Allegra and Edith hatch a plot to surprise him, he is aware of their footsteps but pretends otherwise. The mention of ‘Bishop of Bingen in his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine‘ emphasises the poet’s powerless condition for a short while; which he recovers from thereafter with the last and last but one quatrains. Struck by fatal tragedies during his lifetime, the poem in a part shows the poet’s insecurities – some of them hidden in lines:\n\nBut put you down into the dungeon\n\nIn the round-tower of my heart.\n\nAnd there will I keep you forever,\n\nYes, forever and a day,\n\nTill the walls shall crumble to ruin,\n\nAnd moulder in dust away!\n\nNonetheless, ‘The Children’s Hour’ is a timeless work depicting paternal gesture.\n\n2. “The Day is Done” (1845)\n\nThe day is done, and the darkness\n\n__Falls from the wings of Night,\n\nAs a feather is wafted downward\n\n__From an eagle in his flight.\n\nI see the lights of the village\n\n__Gleam through the rain and the mist,\n\nAnd a feeling of sadness comes o’er me\n\n__That my soul cannot resist:\n\nA feeling of sadness and longing,\n\n__That is not akin to pain,\n\nAnd resembles sorrow only\n\n__As the mist resembles the rain.\n\nCome, read to me some poem,\n\n__Some simple and heartfelt lay,\n\nThat shall soothe this restless feeling,\n\n__And banish the thoughts of day.\n\nNot from the grand old masters,\n\n__Not from the bards sublime,\n\nWhose distant footsteps echo\n\n__Through the corridors of Time.\n\nFor, like strains of martial music,\n\n__Their mighty thoughts suggest\n\nLife’s endless toil and endeavor;\n\n__And to-night I long for rest.\n\nRead from some humbler poet,\n\n__Whose songs gushed from his heart,\n\nAs showers from the clouds of summer,\n\n__Or tears from the eyelids start;\n\nWho, through long days of labor,\n\n__And nights devoid of ease,\n\nStill heard in his soul the music\n\n__Of wonderful melodies.\n\nSuch songs have power to quiet\n\n__The restless pulse of care,\n\nAnd come like the benediction\n\n__That follows after prayer.\n\nThen read from the treasured volume\n\n__The poem of thy choice,\n\nAnd lend to the rhyme of the poet\n\n__The beauty of thy voice.\n\nAnd the night shall be filled with music\n\n__And the cares, that infest the day,\n\nShall fold their tents, like the Arabs,\n\n__And as silently steal away.\n\n‘The Day is Done’ may have a predictable title deemed sufficient to guess its content, though it isn’t so. Unlike many of his significant works based on folklore, legends and stories, this one is tailor-made for a particular occasion—to be read at the end of a tiring day along with poetry, but not from any famous poet’s collection. When most of Longfellow’s poems speak of generalised ideas applicable to common readers, this remains the odd one out. The arrival of dusk and darkness is obvious and unnoticed like the falling down of an eagle’s feather. The introductory lines set a dampening mood—perfectly synonymous to the mood after a long day’s work; further begetting a strange sadness within the narrator—sadness sans concrete reasons. The only way out from this depressing setting may come from listening to poetry. But soothing poems would fare better than popular ones, because they ought to be spontaneous like tears and rainfall in summer; this being evident from ‘some simple and heartfelt lay’, ‘from some humbler poet’ and ‘songs gushed from his heart’. Use of plain similes like ‘cares being tents like those of the Arabs’ and correlation between rain, mist, sadness and sorrow, renders a mighty rhythm and an unbelievable imagery. A tremendous flow, that is seldom interrupted, elevates this work to the second spot.\n\n1. “A Psalm of Life” (1839)\n\nWhat the Heart of the Young Man Said to the Psalmist\n\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\n\n__Life is but an empty dream!\n\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers,\n\n__And things are not what they seem.\n\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\n\n__And the grave is not its goal;\n\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\n\n__Was not spoken of the soul.\n\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\n\n__Is our destined end or way;\n\nBut to act, that each to-morrow\n\n__Find us farther than to-day.\n\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting,\n\n__And our hearts, though stout and brave,\n\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating\n\n__Funeral marches to the grave.\n\nIn the world’s broad field of battle,\n\n__In the bivouac of Life,\n\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle!\n\n__Be a hero in the strife!\n\nTrust no Future, howe’er pleasant!\n\n__Let the dead Past bury its dead!\n\nAct,—act in the living Present!\n\n__Heart within, and God o’erhead!\n\nLives of great men all remind us\n\n__We can make our lives sublime,\n\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\n\n__Footprints on the sands of time;\n\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\n\n__Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,\n\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\n\n__Seeing, shall take heart again.\n\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\n\n__With a heart for any fate;\n\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\n\n__Learn to labor and to wait.\n\nAnyone with a little interest in English poetry, must have had this poem etched into memory; hence no guesses about Longfellow’s best poem. Such is its evocative eloquence, such is its superior effect on every person regardless of class, religion and nationality that it transcends the boundaries of a mere song, and in the right sense, transforms into a psalm – a path to be followed for glorified and righteous life. Recited at Senate meetings, public gatherings and even at churches, this poem is sometimes speculated to have inspired Longfellow after he had come across a board in a German graveyard. Certainly his greatest, ‘Psalm of Life’ seems to have varied ideas where each quatrain is a guideline in itself.\n\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\n\nLife is but an empty dream!\n\nThese first two lines provide the impetus to how the rest of the poem is to proceed. And indeed, he is 100 percent true in conveying that instead of blaming life, one must work towards improving it by making judicious utilisation of our short lives.\n\nTaking into account another stanza:\n\nTrust no Future, howe’er pleasant!\n\nLet the dead Past bury its dead!\n\nAct,—act in the living Present!\n\nHeart within, and God o’erhead!\n\nI can faintly remember people around me quoting the above lines to lend support to one another while in distress. The central theme never deviates from the ‘don’t give up’ catch phrase. Much credit goes to ‘A Psalm of Life’ in enabling Longfellow to leave his ‘footprints on the sands of time’ even after almost two centuries have faded from when he wrote it.\n\nI can bet that most of the poems that have made it to the list, would make it onto any Longfellow follower’s list of top ten (where the order can vary a thousand times for a thousand lists). Although the literary stardom of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow has dwindled ever since the advent of 20th century, his legacy is as grand as his rise to fame.\n\nAn alumnus of IGIT Sarang, Satyananda Sarangi is a young poet who enjoys reading Longfellow, Shelley, Coleridge, Yeats and many others.
