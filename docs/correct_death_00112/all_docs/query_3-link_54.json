        "text": "(Parts of this column were first published as an editorial in the York Daily Record/Sunday News at Christmas in 2014)\n\nAmerican poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote to a friend in 1863: “I have been through a great deal of trouble and anxiety.”\n\nAt this moment in which the 57-year-old widower with six children was losing his religion — as they say in the South when you're at the end of your rope — he found it.\n\nHe penned the memorable and meaningful poem, popularized with music for the past 60 years: \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\" and the focal point of a current film, screened in the region and nationally, “I Heard the Bells.”\n\nWhat was causing the famed poet \"trouble and anxiety\"? What is the story behind the poem?\n\nIt's a story from the Civil War. Actually, a Christmas story from the Civil War. But it applies to any war and any season.\n\nIt's a story about how hope can grow from despair. A headline on Christian blogger Justin Taylor's piece about the drafting of \"Bells\" started with this paradox: \"The True Story of Pain and Hope ... .\"\n\n+++\n\nThe Civil War years were most difficult for the Longfellow family of Massachusetts, as with many families, North and South.\n\nThree months after the war started in April 1861, Longfellow’s wife, Fanny, died in an accident in her home, her dress catching fire. Henry tried to douse the fire with a rug and his body, himself suffering burns. Her death caused Longfellow terrible grief.\n\nFurther, Longfellow nephew Stephen Longfellow and his wife’s half-brother Nathan Appleton Jr. served and both were wounded.\n\nIf such violence reached those living on Massachusetts soil, one would correctly expect it to deepen as you head to the Mason-Dixon Line.\n\nAt least 600 York County fighting men died from battle and disease, and Hanover residents witnessed a battle on their streets that left more than 300 dead, missing and wounded. One Hanover-area mother, Elizabeth Hoffacker, lost two sons in the Union Army, one in the Battle of Hanover and another a year later in fighting in Virginia.\n\n+++\n\nThe next stanza in the Longfellow story of tragedy came in March 1863 when 18-year-old Charles Appleton Longfellow ran off to join the Union Army.\n\nThe oldest of six Longfellow children missed the Gettysburg campaign of 1863 because of typhoid but was back fighting in the field in the Mine Run campaign in Virginia that fall. On Nov. 27, he suffered a severe shoulder wound, the bullet almost nicking his spine.\n\nHis father traveled to Washington, D.C., to consult with doctors. Would Charles survive?\n\nOne doctor said the wound could result in paralysis. Another surgical team provided more promising news, saying the young soldier would survive but would require months of healing. History tells us the second team was right, and Charlie, as he was called, survived, never again to serve in uniform.\n\nTaylor summed up Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's state of mind at Christmas 1863:\n\n\"He heard the Christmas bells that December day and the singing of 'peace on earth (Luke 2:14),' but he observed the world of injustice and violence that seemed to mock the truthfulness of this optimistic outlook. The theme of listening recurred throughout the poem, eventually leading to a settledness of confident hope even in the midst of bleak despair.\"\n\nMore by McClure:This deeply divided group opted to agree to agree. Then they thanked God\n\nMore by McClure: The 1911 holiday season a time of despair for this York family\n\n+++\n\nLongfellow's thoughts that day might reflect our own, as we think this Christmas season about the baby of humble parents born in a stable more than 2,000 years ago. Christians believe that Jesus, God's son, became human to live among men and women and to offer the world hope, then, now and in the future.\n\nBut then we think about those things today that defy peace. We all know about all the troubling rumblings and aftershocks we witness around the world seemingly every day.\n\nHow did Longfellow work through this disconnect between peace and panic?\n\nMaybe we can learn the lesson along with Longfellow: \"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep.\"\n\nHere's the hopeful sound the poet heard from the bells:\n\nAnd in despair I bowed my head;\"There is no peace on earth,\" I said;\"For hate is strong,And mocks the songOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\"\n\nThen pealed the bells more loud and deep:\"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;The Wrong shall fail,The Right prevail,With peace on earth, good-will to men.\"\n\nJim McClure is a retired editor of the York Daily Record and has authored or co-authored nine books on York County history.
