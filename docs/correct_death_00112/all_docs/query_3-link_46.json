        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born 27 February 1807 in Portland, Cumberland County, Maine, United States to Stephen Longfellow (1776-1849) and Zilpah Wadsworth (1778-1851) and died 24 March 1882 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States of peritonitis. He married Mary Storer Potter (1812-1835) 14 September 1831 in Portland, Cumberland County, Maine, United States. He married Frances Elizabeth Appleton (1817-1861) 13 July 1843 in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States.\n\nBiography\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (February 27, 1807 – March 24, 1882) was an American poet and educator whose works include \"Paul Revere's Ride\", The Song of Hiawatha, and Evangeline. He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, and was one of the five Fireside Poets.\n\nLongfellow was born in Portland, Maine, which was then a part of Massachusetts. He studied at Bowdoin College. After spending time in Europe he became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major poetry collections were Voices of the Night (1839) and Ballads and Other Poems (1841). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854, to focus on his writing, living the remainder of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a former Revolutionary War headquarters of George Washington. His first wife Mary Potter died in 1835, after a miscarriage. His second wife Frances Appleton died in 1861, after sustaining burns when her dress caught fire. After her death, Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time and focused on translating works from foreign languages. He died in 1882.\n\nLongfellow wrote many lyric poems known for their musicality and often presenting stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas. He has been criticized, however, for imitating European styles and writing specifically for the masses.\n\nParentage / Ancestry\n\nLongfellow was born on February 27, 1807, to Stephen Longfellow and Zilpah (Wadsworth) Longfellow in Portland, Maine,[1] then a district of Massachusetts,[2] and he grew up in what is now known as the Wadsworth-Longfellow House.\n\nHis father was a lawyer, and his maternal grandfather, Peleg Wadsworth, was a general in the American Revolutionary War and a Member of Congress.[3] He was named after his mother's brother Henry Wadsworth, a Navy lieutenant who had died three years earlier at the Battle of Tripoli.[4] Longfellow was the second of eight children;[5] his siblings were Stephen (1805), Elizabeth (1808), Anne (1810), Alexander (1814), Mary (1816), Ellen (1818) and Samuel (1819). Longfellow was of entirely English ancestry, all of which had been in New England since the early 1600s.[6]\n\nMarriage & Family\n\n1st Marriage: Potter\n\nOn September 14, 1831, Longfellow married Mary Storer Potter, a childhood friend from Portland.[31] The couple settled in Brunswick, though the two were not happy there.\n\nIn October 1835, during the trip, his wife Mary had a miscarriage about six months into her pregnancy.[36] She did not recover and died after several weeks of illness at the age of 22 on November 29, 1835. Longfellow had her body embalmed immediately and placed in a lead coffin inside an oak coffin which was then shipped to Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston.[37] He was deeply saddened by her death, writing \"One thought occupies me night and day... She is dead — She is dead! All day I am weary and sad\".[38] Three years later, he was inspired to write the poem \"Footsteps of Angels\" about her.\n\n2nd Marriage: Appleton\n\nOn May 10, 1843, after seven years, Longfellow received a letter from Fanny Appleton agreeing to marry him and, too restless to take a carriage, walked 90 minutes to meet her at her house.[58] They were soon married. Nathan Appleton bought the Craigie House as a wedding present to the pair. Longfellow lived there for the rest of his life.\n\nHe and Fanny had six children:\n\nCharles Appleton Longfellow (1844-1893) - Snuck away to join the Civil War where he was gravely wounded. He inspired Longfellow's poem I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\n\nErnest Wadsworth Longfellow (1845-1921) - renowned artist and art collector who donated a sizeable collection to the Boston Museum of Art.\n\nFrances Longfellow (1847-1848) - When the younger Fanny was born on April 7, 1847, Dr. Nathan Cooley Keep administered ether as the first obstetric anesthetic in the United States to Fanny Longfellow\n\nAlice Mary Longfellow (1850-1928) - noteworth philanthropist and historical preservationist. Never married.\n\nEdith Longfellow (1853-1915) - married Boston lawyer, Richard Henry Dana III, son of the popular writer Richard Henry Dana, Jr., author of Two Years Before the Mast.\n\nAnne Allegra Longfellow (1855-1934) - the youngest daughter of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882), she married a Boston lawyer. Her father immortalized her in his poem \"The Children's Hour\" as \"laughing Allegra,\" referring to her middle name.\n\nChildren\n\nOffspring of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Mary Storer Potter (1812-1835) Name Birth Death Joined with Baby Longfellow (1835-1835) 5 October 1835 Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands 5 October 1835 Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands\n\nOffspring of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Frances Elizabeth Appleton (1817-1861) Name Birth Death Joined with Charles Appleton Longfellow (1844-1893) 9 June 1844 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States 13 April 1893 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States Ernest Wadsworth Longfellow (1845-1921) 28 November 1845 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States 24 November 1921 Hotel Touraine, Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, United States Harriet Maria Spelman (1848-1937) Frances Longfellow (1847-1848) 7 April 1847 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, 184 11 September 1848 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts Alice Mary Longfellow (1850-1928) 22 September 1850 Longfellow House, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, 1928 7 December 1928 Longfellow House, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts Edith Longfellow (1853-1915) 22 October 1853 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 21 July 1915 Manchester, Essex County, Massachusetts Richard Henry Dana (1851-1931) Anne Allegra Longfellow (1855-1934) 8 November 1855 Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts 28 February 1934 110 Brattle Street, Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts, United States Joseph Gilbert Thorp (1852-1931)\n\nFamily Connections in Literature\n\nLongfellow's literary works include many remarkable historical familial connections, including the following:\n\nCourtship of Myles Standish\n\nThe story of their courtship has been romanticized for all time in the story of The Courtship of Miles Standish written in poem by their descendant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882).\n\nThe colony's military leader, Myles Standish (c1584-1656), desired the hand of Priscilla in marriage, but being to shy to speak himself, employed John as a go-between. However, Priscilla fell in love with John.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a fierce Indian war, the tale focuses on a love triangle among three Pilgrims: Myles Standish (c1584-1656), Priscilla Mullins (1602-1680), and John Alden (c1599-1687). Longfellow claimed the story was true, but the historical evidence is inconclusive. Nevertheless, the ballad was very popular in nineteenth-century America, immortalizing the Mayflower Pilgrims.\n\nVital Records\n\n1870 US Census\n\nRecorded at Cambridge MA - Living at Longfellow House\n\nHenry Longfellow - age 60 - ocp: Poet\n\nCharles Longfellow - age 25 - no occupation\n\nErnest Longfellow - age 23 - ocp: artist\n\nAlice Longfellow - age 18 - no occupation\n\nEdith Longfellow - age 16 - at school\n\nAnnie Longfellow - age 14 - at school\n\nReferences\n\nAlden House Museum Tour\n\nWadsworth in Middlesex County, Massachusetts\n\n‡ General\n\nHenry Wadworth Longfellow - Wikipedia\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882)/Immigrant Ancestors"
