Harry was a very gentle man. He would put me on a stool and ask me to be quiet, and I could watch him draw,” she said. “I was a very good kid because I was so amazed. It was very impressive.” Olive was taken to the office by another member of “this Wonder Woman network,” Marjorie Wilkes. “She was one of Mom’s dearest friends, and she lost her husband to the influenza, and so she came to live with us also,” Olive explained. “I think that the gut work was done between Marjorie and Dad, because she was the one who helped name her Wonder Woman. She used to do a lot of the lettering, and when he wrote the scripts she would be the one to type them up. She was a good lady.”\n\nIn The Secret History of Wonder Woman (Knopf, 2014), from chapter seven, “Machine Detects Liars, Traps Crooks”, Jill Lepore wrote:\n\n“No one knows more about the production of Wonder Woman than Marjorie W. Huntley,” Holloway liked to say. In the 1940s, Huntley helped out with the inking and lettering of Wonder Woman, including panel after panel depicting women shackled, hands and feet. “How can she run with that ball and chains?” one of Wonder Woman’s captors cries out. Huntley was schooled in suffrage, but she believed, too, in what she called “love binding”; the importance of being tied and chained. She also believed in extra-body consciousness, vibrations, reincarnation, and the psychic nature of orgasm.\n\nA Leroy lettering guide was used for the lettering.\n\nBelow is some biographical information about Marjorie Wilkes who was born December 29, 1889, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n1900 United States Federal Census\n\nParents: Samuel (Railroad Agent) and Georgia Wilkes\n\nHome: 300 Lee Street, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n1910 United States Federal Census\n\nParents: Samuel (Assistant Freight Agent/Georgia Railroad) and Georgia Wilkes\n\nHome: 500 Spring Street, Atlanta, Georgia\n\nWar Library Bulletin\n\nJune 1918\n\nCamp Gordon, Ga., Marjorie Wilkes, Hospital librarian.\n\nThe Library Journal\n\nJuly 1918\n\nCamp Gordon, Atlanta, Ga…..Marjorie Wilkes, hospital librarian\n\nBulletin of the American Library Association\n\nSeptember 1918\n\nThe librarian at Red Cross house, Camp Gordon, Miss Marjorie Wilkes, paid a call recently at the bedside of a man who was perfectly certain that he did not want to read anything. His was an orthopedic case and he was peevish and almost contemptuous. But it transpired that Miss Wilkes discovered in him a latent sense of humor and soon after her call she sent him a copy of “Penrod” with the message that if ever he had been a boy she was sure he would enjoy the book. The next time she visited the ward this man instead of being almost rude and wholly unresponsive was all smiles. Never had he enjoyed a book like that one. Would she send him another? Greatest thing he’d ever read.\n\nTo satisfy the needs of sick soldiers it is necessary not only to take the book to the man but to get acquainted with him. After this has been done the librarian and her orderly have the supremest satisfaction that can come to such workers, namely that of seeing every man in the ward with a book, a scrapbook, or a magazine in his hand. As Miss Wilkes’ orderly said after getting back from one of his rounds, “Well, I left everybody a-readin’.”\n\nBulletin of the American Library Association\n\nNovember 1918\n\nUpton Camp, N.Y.\n\nBase Hospital.....Marjorie Wilkes, Hospital Librarian\n\nNew York, New York, Marriage Index\n\nName: Marjorie “Wilker” [transcription error]\n\nSpouse: Laurence M.

Her parents were Azel and Sarah.\n\nSo far, the earliest mention of Louise was found in St. Nicholas, March 1897. She entered the contest, “A Thanksgiving Day Problem”, and her answers placed her in the Roll of Honor.\n\nThe 1900 U.S. Federal Census recorded Louise, a student, and her mother in Wakefield at 24 Yale Avenue.\n\nLouise was a bridesmaid at her brother’s wedding as reported in the Boston Herald (Massachusetts), April 25, 1901.\n\nAmerican Art News, April 15, 1905, included a report from Boston.\n\nThe drawings made in the semi-annual concours of Frank W. Benson’s life classes at the school of the Museum of Fine Arts were put on exhibition at the school on Thursday afternoon, remaining through the week. The student winning the highest numbers were as follows: No. 1, Louise K. Ames, Wakefield, Mass….\n\nLouise’s father passed away November 12, 1908; it was recorded in Genealogy of the Ancestors and Descendants of John White of Wenham and Lancaster, Massachusetts, 1574-1909, Volume IV (Press of the Nichols Print, 1909). Louise’s birth date was stated incorrectly as March 28.\n\nIn the 1910 census, Louise, an artist, and her mother lived in Wakefield on Yale Street.\n\nThe Printing Art, April 1915, showcased Louise’s art and designs.\n\nThe Boston Herald, May 9, 1916, reported Louise’s engagement.\n\nThe engagement is announced of Miss Louise Kimball Ames of Brookline, formerly of Wakefield, and Capt. William Emerson Norman. Miss Ames is the daughter of the late Dr. Azel Ames of Wakefield, and met Capt. Norman while on a voyage to Buenos Ayres a few years ago. Capt. Norman is in the British war transport service.\n\nLouise was included in the book, Some Examples of the Work of American Designers (Dill & Collins Company, 1918).\n\nThe Printing Art, October 1918, featured Louise’s Christmas card.\n\nThe 1920 census said Louise was a self-employed designer at home. Louise’s husband was a captain of a ship and thirteen years older than her. They resided on Gorham Avenue in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nThe 1920 American Art Annual, Volume XVII, listed Louise in the section, “Who’s Who Among Craftsmen”.\n\nNorman, Louise Ames (Mrs. W.E.), 51 Gorham Ave., Brookline, Mass. B.S.A.C. (Boston Society of Arts and Crafts)\n\nThe 1922 Brookline business directory included Louise in the artists category: “Norman Louise A (coml) 51 Gorham av.”\n\nOn September 22, 1922, Louise filed a Petition for Naturalization. Evidently her marriage to a British citizen affected her status. She was admitted on June 27, 1927.\n\nAt some point Louise moved to Groton, Massachusetts. The 1925 directory listing read: “Norman William E (Louise A) master mariner h Main”. The 1929 directory listing was identical.\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, Louise, her husband and eight-year-old son, William, were in Groton on Main Street. She was no longer working.\n\nOn June 14, 1939, Louise’s husband died of a fractured skull, due to a fall, and buried at sea. His death was reported in the Boston Post, June 15, and Boston Herald, June 17.\n\nLouise and her son remained at the same address in the 1940 census.\n\nThe Fitchburg Sentinel (Massachusetts), January 31, 1944, reported Louise’s son graduation from the U.S. naval reserve midshipmen’s school at Notre Dame.\n\nLouise traveled twice to England, in 1948 and 1951. The 1951 passenger list recorded her address as “34 Salem St. Wakefield, Mass.”\n\nThe Massachusetts Death Index, at Ancestry.com, said Louise passed away in 1962, in Melrose, Massachusetts. An obituary has not been found.\n\n(Next post on Monday: The Gene Thurston Mystery)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nUnder Cover: The Gene Thurston Mystery\n\nDust Jackets by Gene Thurston\n\n1930\n\nThe Amazing Web\n\nA.

It is a mystery to me that so little is known about Mr. Thurston. Any hints as to his lineage are gratefully accepted...”\n\nPerson of Interest Number One\n\nAt first glance, Eugene Bonfanti Thurston (1896–1993), a Tennessee native, seems to have the background and experience to have produced the Mystery League dust jackets. He was in New York City when he signed his World War I draft card (found at Ancestry.com) on September 12, 1918. It’s not clear when he returned to El Paso, Texas, where his family moved when he was a child.\n\nThurston was profiled in Early El Paso Artists (Texas Western Press, 1983). At El Paso High School, he was editor of the school newspaper The Tatler, and the yearbook. He took a two-year correspondence course in commercial art from the Federal School of Art in Minneapolis. He produced greeting cards, calendars, announcements, lithographs and prints.\n\nBut, according to the 1930 U.S. Federal Census, Thurston resided in El Paso, far away from the New York publisher of the Mystery League books. Working from such a distant seems impractical and costly, having to depend on the post office and courier services to deliver designs and artwork. Thurston’s occupation was an artist doing painting, plus he was married and had two daughters. So, I would rule out Eugene Bonfanti Thurston as the man behind the Mystery League covers.\n\nPerson of Interest Number Two\n\nAt Ancestry.com I searched “Eugene Thurston” and added the keyword “artist”. As I examined each name in the 1940 census, one person stood out because his occupation was “Designer”. Eugene Thurstson, 34, was a native of Michigan and resided in Manhattan, New York City at 178 East 91st Street. He was divorced and his highest level of education was the fourth year of high school. In 1939 he worked twenty weeks and earned 917 dollars.\n\nI refined my search by including the birth year, 1906, and birthplace, Michigan. In the 1930 census is “Eugene E. Thurston”, age 24 and from Michigan. His occupation was designer in the commercial art trade. Thurston’s wife, Edith, was 45 years old and a New York native. They married when he was 21 and she 42. They resided in Manhattan, New York City at 527 West 121st Street. A 1931 Manhattan directory had the same address for him.\n\nI did not find Thurston in the New York, New York Marriage Index at Ancestry.com. Presumably he had married out of state, probably in Michigan.\n\nApparently, Thurston resided in Brooklyn for a time. His wife returned from Europe on September 4, 1929. The passenger list recorded her address as 200 Washington Park in Brooklyn.\n\nThe Nassau Daily Review (Freeport, New York), August 10, 1935, published an item about Thurston visiting brother-in-law, Austin Long:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Austin O. Long of Hamilton street, Rockville Centre have as their week-end guests, Dr. and Mrs. Gould Cloud of Elizabeth, N. J., and Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Thurston of New York city.\n\nThurston has not yet been found in the 1910 and 1920 censuses.\n\nRegarding Thurston’s wife, Edith, there is considerably more information. According to Ancestry.com, she was born in Buffalo, New York, on February 26, 1885, and passed away in Florida, February 27, 1975. Her parents were Eli and Alice Long. In the 1900 census, Edith was the first of four children; her brothers were Austin, Raymond and Edwin. In the 1920 census and 1925 New York State Census, Edith was a widow who had the name, Robertson, and lived with her parents in Buffalo, where she was a self-employed landscape architect. In 1930, her book, High-Lights of Architecture, was published, and at Columbia University, Edith received her Bachelor of Science in Fine Arts (see column two). The 1940 census recorded her as an art teacher in Buffalo where she resided with her parents. The census said she had been a resident of Detroit, Michigan, in 1935.\n\nWhat became of Thurston after the 1940 census is not known. A World War II army draft card has not been found for him. It’s possible he enlisted in another service such as the marines, navy or air force. At Ancestry.com, an artist named “Eugene E. Thurston” was found in two city directories: Pasadena, California, 1947, and San Francisco, California, 1959. Directories at San Francisco Genealogy for 1960, 1962 and 1963 list the firm, Shawl, Nyeland & Seavey as Thurston’s employer. It’s unclear if this artist was Thurston the designer, who would have been in his mid-fifties in the early 1960s. Thurston has not been found in the Social Security Death Index.\n\nI believe Michigan-born Eugene E. “Gene” Thurston can be charged for the crime covers of the Mystery League books.\n\nMystery League Dust Jackets by Arthur Hawkins Jr.\n\nThe Mystery of Burnleigh Manor\n\nWalter Livingston\n\nMystery League, 1930\n\nSeldon Truss\n\nMystery League, 1931\n\nThe Maestro Murders\n\nFrances S.

One week from today 1,500 United Cigar stores throughout the country and Whalen and Neve drug stores associated with them, will offer you for 50 cents a copy of “The Hand of Power,” Edgar Wallace’s latest mystery novel, printed on good paper and bound in boards. And thus, my dears, will be written another chapter in the hectic history or the book business which seems to be going blotto. This new wrinkle was explained yesterday by Sidney M. Biddell, president of the Mystery League, and William A. Ferguson, secretary of the United Cigar Stores company of America. Educating magazine readers to buy books at prices within their reach is the aim of the Mystery League. Several hundred mystery books are published annually, its president pointed out, and his firm will not publish more than 24 in a year, so he feels that the new venture will not cut into the trade of book stores. “For one thing,” he said, “we expect to create a new class of book readers.” The impression seems to be fairly common that what the book business needs is “a new class of readers,” so thus worthy aim, as voiced by Biddell, isn’t exactly original. Ferguson thinks that selling you a book when you drop in to buy a pack of cigarets or a cigar, will be easy. Here and there, he said, some of his firm’s stores had been experimenting with the book business and things came off beautifully. Well, it seems Biddell got this idea about the Mystery League and needed a distributor for his wares, and there was Ferguson wishing he could get some books to sell. And then just to show you how things turn out, sometimes they met and talked it over. And now, as you tarry with dame nicotine, you may also select yourself a book. And remember the price only 50 cents. The idea has its possibilities, but we don’t quite agree with Biddell when he says it isn’t going to hurt the business of book stores. You’ll probably learn more about that angle after the booksellers catch their breath and proceed to have their say.\n\nCleveland Plain Dealer\n\n(Ohio)\n\nJune 26, 1930\n\nThe Hand of Power\n\nEvening News\n\n(North Tonawanda, New York)\n\nJune 27, 1930\n\n“Smokes and Books”\n\nA big cigar store chain, in association with a chain of drug stores, is taking up books as a side line. That makes a couple of thousand stores altogether. The book distribution will be done through an organization known as the Mystery League, operating on the book-a-month plan.\n\nBook-lovers, whether they smoke or not, will be interested in the fact that these books, of regular novel size, will be printed on good paper, bound in durable boards and sold for 50 cents apiece. This may have some effect on the general book market.\n\nThe idea of selling books in a tobacco store isn’t funny. It’s sensible. Smokers, being inclined to thoughtfulness, probably read more than non-smokers. Their taste for reading might be encouraged by giving a book with every box of cigars. But there ought to be many kinds of books offered besides mystery tales.\n\n(New York)\n\nJuly 2, 1930\n\nThe Hand of Power\n\nNew York Evening Post\n\nJuly 5, 1930\n\nDashiell Hammett review of Edgar Wallace’s The Hand of Power\n\nI managed to leave one of the three books that came to me for review this week in either a taxicab or a Pullman car somewhere between New York and Baltimore (finder please read and review, or at least review), and, to make a thorough job of it, also managed to forget its title and author, though I think the author’s name had a Louis in it. Luckily, I seem to have saved the right two books. The ones I have on hand are both excellent of their kinds: it is doubtful if the lost brother was so, good.\n\n“The Hand of Power” is the book with which the United Cigar Stores make their entrance into the current cut-price publishing shindig. It is Wallace at his best, at his least adult, at his most naively melodramatic; the Wallace who can juggle complete sets of false whiskers with mustachios—trapdoors, the secret passages they lead to, and forged wills, birth certificates and whatnot with his left hand: an occult poison or two, the necessary hypodermic needles, stolen heritages and at least one impersonation with his right; while balancing a stack of cowled menaces, a kidnaping and as many murders as you like on his head and managing a typewriter—using the ribbon’s red stratum—with his feet.\n\nThere has only been one man who could beat, Wallace at this game and he, George Bronson Howard, has been dead some seven, years and is completely forgotten. Herman Landon can sometimes hold the pace for a chapter or two, but seldom for longer than that. Sydney Horler’s warehouses are well stocked with hocus-pocus but in action he is all thumbs. M. P. Shiel, mechanically Wallace’s one undoubted superior in this dizzy field, is often enough—even in such essentially dull opera as “The Purple Cloud”—too authentic a magician to deserve a place among the masters of claptrap.\n\n“The Hand Of Power” starts off with a pair of cowled Proud Sons of Ragousa whispering in the sinister ear of the sinister Dr. Laffin on a desolate Dartmoor road, then jumps to dirty work la London—including some amazingly delightful nonsense in a shop-window, with the heroine in a green gown sitting at a desk in front of a single red rose—and culminates in much filthier work aboard the S. S. Escorial in the Arctic Circle. Noteworthy among the villains herein assembled is Captain Harvey Hale, “seventy-five by fifty coarse inches of muscle and bone.” This is just the sort of story Wallace can do if done at his best. I would not care to recommend it as a steady diet but it has its place. For instance, it makes swell reading when somebody who bores you is talking. Perhaps you do not care for this sort of thing even then. Then you should pay no attention to Wallace at any time, for when he tries to be reasonable he is simply dull.\n\nBoston Herald\n\n(Massachusetts)\n\nJuly 24, 1930\n\nThe Curse of Doone\n\nNew York Sun\n\nSeptember 5, 1930\n\nThe House of Sudden Sleep\n\nBoston Herald\n\n(Massachusetts)\n\nSeptember 30, 1930\n\nJack O’Lantern\n\nLockport Union Sun and Journal\n\n(New York)\n\nOctober 2, 1930\n\nJack O’Lantern\n\nDunkirk Evening Observer\n\n(New York)\n\nNovember 5, 1930\n\nThe Mystery of Burnleigh Manor\n\nThe Times-Picayune\n\n(New Orleans, Louisiana)\n\nNovember 25, 1930\n\nThe Invisible Host\n\nCleveland Plain Dealer\n\n(Ohio)\n\nDecember 10, 1930\n\nFive-book Gift Set\n\nDunkirk Evening Observer\n\n(New York)\n\nFebruary 3, 1931\n\nThe Monster of Grammont\n\nTrenton Evening Times\n\n(New Jersey)\n\nMarch 26, 1931\n\nDeath Walks in Eastrepps\n\nElmira Star-Gazette\n\n(New York)\n\nJune 18, 1931\n\nThe Gutenberg Murders\n\nTrenton Evening Times\n\n(New Jersey)\n\nAugust 6, 1931\n\nThe Tunnel Mystery\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\n(Pennsylvania)\n\nJuly 22, 1932\n\nThe Ebony Bed Murder\n\nNew York Evening Post\n\nAugust 22, 1932\n\n“Women Like Gore”\n\nSixty Per Cent of Mystery Novel Readers Feminine, Publisher Finds.\n\nIf statesmen like to escape from the intricacies of statecraft and industrial giants choose to forget the problems of industry by tucking their noses between the covers of a mystery novel, so do housewives hasten to wash their hands of the breakfast dishes and cooks yearn to curl up with a good (i. e.. hair-raising) book.\n\nEven more so, in fact. According to Sydney [sic] M. Bidden, the young executive of the Mystery League which supplies a book a month to the detective-minded public, 60 per cent of the buyers of mystery novels are women. They will have their mysteries, even if they have to go into cigar stores to get them. For this particular check-up was made through the chain cigar stores which are in many cases the distributors of Mystery League books. A general check-up among all the distributors would, Mr. Biddell opined, reveal an even higher percentage of women readers.\n\n“And here’s an even more startling figure for you,” Mr. Biddell went on. “When we held our Baffle Book contests, 80 per cent of the solutions were sent in by women, and only 20 per cent by men.\n\n“That proves something more than just numbers. It proves that, contrary to what most people think, women, don’t just read these stories to pass the time. They are interested in following the clues. They like to pit their wits against the author’s and see how quickly they can arrive at the solution.”\n\nLove interest? Mr. Biddell shook his head. It seems that over in England, where those cold Anglo-Saxons live, they like books in which the love interest predominates over the mystery. But here in sentimental America the heart is subordinated to the intellect.\n\n“There has to be a thread of romance, of course,” said Mr. Biddell, and he rummaged through hie files and brought out a letter from a woman reader.\n\n“I missed the love story in ‘______’,” the lady wrote, commenting on a recent novel. “Put a bit more in and all will be serene. Romance and mystery mix well. I for one can’t stand a straight love story.”\n\nAmong the 7,000 to 8,000 letters that come to the Mystery League’s office in the course of a year, the majority are from women. Ladies sit themselves down before their scented violet and baby blue sheets of letter paper in Melrose, La., and Mount Vernon, Iowa; in Danielson, Conn., and\n\nSan Juan Bautista, Cal., take pen in hand and inscribe their opinions of such and such a book or such and such an author.\n\n“They are both more loyal and more critical than men readers,” said Mr. Biddell, who has women folks of his own (he showed your reporter, pardonable pride, a snapshot of his young daughter, who will probably grow up to be a mystery writer herself). “Women demand that the background be bizarre—they want to read about a life as different from their own as possible.\n\n“They are quite impartial about whether their authors are men or women—there are about as many women writers as men, and Mary Roberts Rinehart, M. G. Eberhard, Agatha Christie, Carolyn Wells and Dorothy L. Sayres are as popular as any of their male colleagues—but they don’t take kindly to a woman sleuth.\n\n“I suppose,” Mr. Biddell ventured slyly, “that’s because even women don’t believe a woman could solve a really heinous crime. After all, have you ever noticed that even at the most successful mystery plays the matinee audiences are very sparse? Even the bravest women seem to like having a masculine arm within reach, and so they go in the evening when they can have a male escort.\n\n“Why do they read mystery stories, then? Well, psychologists tell us that we read mystery stories because our civilization is so refined that we miss the dangers of primitive life. Women, on the whole, live even less dangerous lives than men. Perhaps that is why their taste in literature is more gory than men’s.\n\n“Or perhaps,” said Mr. Biddell wickedly, “It‘s just because they have more time.”\n\nThe Bookshop Blog\n\n“The Mystery League: Great Crime Fiction or Only Super Deco Dust Jackets?” Diane Plumley’s research on the Mystery League books.\n\n(Next post on Christmas Day)\n\n↧\n\nLettering and Typography: Merry Christmas\n\n↧\n\nTypography: Happy Noo Year!\n\nJudge\n\nDecember 27, 1913\n\nHarold Ansel Van Buren\n\n(Next post on Monday: Carter Printing Ink Company)\n\n↧\n\nTypography: Carter Printing Ink Company\n\nTHE CARTER DUCKS\n\nThe Inland Printer\n\nJune 1907\n\nThe Inland Printer\n\nJuly 1907\n\nThe Inland Printer\n\nAugust 1907\n\nThe Inland Printer\n\nSeptember 1907\n\nThe Inland Printer\n\nOctober 1907\n\n(Next post on Monday: Everett R.

Sangor’s full name and birth information were on his World War I draft card. The U.S. Naturalization Record Index, at Ancestry.com, said Sangor arrived in America on February 25, 1904. At this time it is not known who accompanied him. Sangor’s draft card said his dependents included his mother, so she may have emigrated with him.\n\nIn the 1910 U.S. Federal Census, there are two women who were born in Russia and lived in Milwaukee. Sarah Sangor, 60 and a widow, was in the household of Harry Podolsky, her 35-year-old, Russian-born son-in-law, who was married to Rosa, also 35. The couple had two children, one born in New York and the other in Wisconsin. Rosa emigrated in 1904 which was the same year as Sangor’s arrival. Maybe Rosa and Sangor were siblings and traveled together in 1904; she would have been about 29 years old and Sangor around 15. There was no emigration date for Sarah.\n\nSangor has not yet been found in the 1910 census. His education was reported in Joe Mitchell Chapple’s “Heart Throbs” column which was printed in the Buffalo Evening News (New York), December 20, 1928.\n\n…Benjamin Sangor was an emigrant boy who in 23 years after landing at Ellis Island has become one of the largest real estate operators in the country. He attended night school at Milwaukee, and after graduating at the North Division School, attended the University of Wisconsin, working nights as a waiter or anything he could do to support himself, and finally graduated from the Marquette Law school.\n\nThe Cook County, Illinois, Marriages Index, at Ancestry.com, said Sangor married Sophia B. Kitz on August 20, 1912, in Chicago, Illinois. However, eight months later, the Milwaukee Journal (Wisconsin), April 19, 1913, printed this announcement:\n\nNaturalization Clerk Going to Be Married to Chicago Girl, Sunday.\n\nNaturalization Clerk Benjamin Sangor got things all mixed up Saturday, but his boss, Clerk of Courts Charles Maas, forgave him. There’s a reason. Ben is going to be married Sunday. The lucky girl is Miss Sophie B. Kitz, 1480 Farragut-av, Chicago. The ceremony will take place there.\n\nThe 1913 Milwaukee city directory listed Sangor as deputy clerk at the Court House and his residence at 871 40th.\n\nOn September 18, 1914, Sangor became a naturalized citizen. His address was 757 Frederick Avenue in Milwaukee.\n\nSangor became a lawyer and was named in the article, “Moha Challenges Validity of Law”, which was published by the Milwaukee Sentinel (Wisconsin), January 23, 1915.\n\nSangor signed his World War I draft card on June 5, 1917. The card said he was a lawyer and lived at 757 Frederick Avenue in Milwaukee. Sangor’s mother, wife and child were his dependents. The description of him was medium height and stout build with gray eyes and brown hair.\n\nAccording to the Cook County, Illinois Death Index, Sangor’s wife, Sophie, passed away March 27, 1918, in Chicago. She was buried at Ridge Lawn Beth El Cemetery. Her death certificate said she was born n Baraga, Michigan, on November 16, 1893, but the 1900 census and her gravestone have the birth year 1892. The cause of death was not stated.\n\nSangor was in the lawyers listings of the 1918 Milwaukee city directory. His address was 114 Grand Avenue. Sangor’s involvement in the Kroeger Brothers Company case was chronicled in the following newspapers.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal, November 5, 1918: “‘Rummy or Liar,’ Says Court”\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal, November 9, 1918: “Ready to Talk Now, He Says”\n\nThe Evening Sentinel, November 16, 1918: “Judge Geiger Tells Herzog He Falsifies”\n\nThe Evening Sentinel, November 18, 1918: “Court Declares Kroeger Bros. Co. Bankrupt”\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal, November 19, 1918: “Kroeger Witness May See His Son”\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal, November 20, 1918: “Rubin Explains Kroeger Deal”\n\nThe Milwaukee Sentinel, November 21, 1918: “Rubin Undergoes Long Examination”\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal, November 30, 1918: “Evidence Untrue, Says Court”\n\nThe Milwaukee Sentinel, January 22, 1919: “Contempt Charge Against Lawyers”\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal, February 24, 1919: “Rubin Denies He Sought Secrecy”\n\nThe 1919 Milwaukee city directory had this listing: “Sangor Benj 835 Caswell blk”.\n\nThe 1920 census recorded Sangor as a resident of Chicago at 4518 Prairie Avenue. He was single and a general practice lawyer. His Wisconsin-born, seven-year-old daughter, “Jacqueline”, was enrolled at the Chicago St. Xavier Academy.\n\nIn Funnybooks (2014), Michael Barrier wrote:\n\nBy 1922, B.W. Sangor was listed in a legal directory as a Chicago attorney and was advertising real-estate auctions in the Chicago Tribune. Sangor moved to New York by the mid-1920s…\n\nSangor has not yet been found in the 1925 New York state census, which said his daughter, “Jacqulyn”, attended Highland Manor School in Tarrytown, Westchester County.\n\nSangor’s real estate business, B.W. Sangor & Co., used a New York City address, “1,459 Broadway (42d St.)”, in a New York Times classified advertisement dated May 14, 1925 (below).\n\nSangor also advertised in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (1926) and Philadelphia Inquirer (1927).\n\nJune 22, 1926\n\nNovember 29, 1927\n\nSangor traveled to Europe in 1928. Aboard the S.S. Berengaria, he departed Southampton, England, on July 7, and arrived in New York, July 13. His address was 1457 Broadway, New York, New York.\n\nThe Rochester Democrat & Chronicle (New York), December 24, 1928, published a longer version of Chapple’s “Heart Throbs” column on Sangor.\n\nIn two sharply-contrasted environments, both of which he calls home, Benjamin W. Sanger, one of the largest realty operators in the country, eminent in community building, gave me his heart throb. In the brilliant and almost blinding glare of Broadway, shining in on his apartment at the Astor Hotel, New York, he began repeating the enchanting verses from Longfellow’s “Evangeline”…\n\n…That was the story of a tragic Arcady, but it brought to mind another and a happier one—at Pinewald, New Jersey, “where the pine forests meet the sea,” and where a new day play city is in the making, as Mr. Sangor said:\n\n“This is my city home, but I want you to come with me to my real home in the pine woods on the Jersey Shore a few hours away, and you will understand why I am so intense in my love of Longfellow’s lines. When I first began to read English, Longfellow seemed to be the poet who took me by the hand and welcomed me to the rich storehouse of American literature.”\n\nThree hours after I found myself with him at his home, called “Cedar Crest,” among the whispering pines and sands of the Jersey shore. Pointing to the west, called attention to a beautiful sunset, he continued:\n\n“There is a picture that hangs on the wall of heaven painted by the great Creator that to me surpasses all the thrills that I can ever hope to have in any art gallery. The quiet of these woods and the close contact to nature will perhaps explain to you why my favorite poem is ‘Evangeline.’”\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, Sangor was married and involved in real estate. His wife was not listed. He resided on Pinewald in Bayville Village, Berkeley Township, Ocean County, New Jersey. Pinewald was Sangor’s failed real estate project.\n\nAt some point, Jacquelyn Sangor returned to Illinois where she was a student at the New Trier High School in Winnekta. She was a senior in 1931.\n\nThe Echoes, 1931 yearbook\n\nSangor’s involvement in the comic book industry is told in Michael Vance’s Forbidden Adventures: The History of the American Comics Group (1996), Michael Barrier’s Funnybooks: The Improbable Glories of the Best American Comic Books (2014), and Alter Ego #61, August 2006. A list of people who worked in the Sangor Studio is here. Sangor’s daughter, Jacquelyn, married publisher, Ned L. Pines, in 1938. The New York Times reported the birth of Jacquelyn’s two daughters, in 1939 and 1942, and referred to her as “the former Miss Jacquelyn Sanger [sic] of Chicago.”\n\nIn the 1940 census, Sangor resided in Manhattan, New York City at 205 West 54th Street. He was married and an executive in personal services. His wife was not recorded. Who’s Who of American Comic Books 1928–1999 said his wife’s name was Frances.\n\nAfter the census enumeration, Sangor traveled by ship to Mexico. He departed Vera Cruz, Mexico, on June 5, 1940, and arrived, six days later, in New York.\n\nSangor signed his World War II draft card in 1942. His address was 205 West 54th Street in Manhattan. He was employed at Cinema Comics, Inc., 45 West 45th Street, New York, New York. He named his daughter, “Jacqulyn Pines”, who resided at 965 5th Avenue, New York City, as his nearest relative. On the back of the card was his description: five feet six inches, 175 pounds with gray eyes and hair.\n\nThe Brooklyn Eagle, January 16, 1948, published a legal noticed which named Sangor in a complaint.\n\nApparently, Sangor retired to Florida where he passed on January 26, 1953, in Miami Beach. A death notice was published in the New York Times, January 29, 1953.\n\nSangor—Benjamin W., on Monday, Jan. 26, 1953, at Miami Beach, Fla., dear husband of Frances Unger Sangor, beloved father of Jacquelyn Pines, loving grandfather of Susan and Judy Pines. Service at Frank E. Campbell, Madison Ave. at 81st St., New York City, Thursday, 12 noon.\n\nUnder the year 1953, DC’s “Other” Comics said: “Ben Sangor dies. Frances Sangor, his widow, is listed as co-owner for the next year.” There was a widow, Frances Sangor, who died at Good Samaritan Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, on April 1, 1964. She was born in 1896.\n\n*****\n\nThe Wikipedia profile of Sangor said: “…On October 1, 1925, a Benjamin Sangor married Etta Weidenfeld at the Hotel Martinique in Manhattan, New York City, though it is unclear if this is the same Sangor…” Wikipedia misspelled the name and had the date wrong. Below is the announcement in the New York Times, October 25, 1925.\n\nSanger–Weidenfeld—Mr. Joseph Weidenfeld announces the marriage of his daughter, Etta, to Mr. Benjamin Sanger at the Hotel Martinique Oct. 18, 1925.\n\nThe 1930 census recorded the couple in the Bronx. New York-born Sanger owned and operated an importing company.\n\n*****\n\n(Updated 10:07 am, January 26, 2015; next post on Monday: Ned L. Pines)\n\n↧\n\nComics: Ned L. Pines\n\nNoah Lewis “Ned” Pines was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on December 10, 1905, according to the Massachusetts Birth Records at Ancestry.com and Who’s Who in Commerce and Industry (1965), Volume 14. Pines’s first name, Noah, was recorded in the census records from 1910 to 1930.\n\nThe 1910 U.S. Federal Census listed Pines in Brooklyn, New York, at 1141 44th Street. His parents, Joseph and Dora were Russian emigrants, and his older brother and sister, Abraham and Lillian, were born in Massachusetts. Joseph was a manufacturer of rain coats.\n\nFive years later the Pines family resided at 1221 42nd Street, in Brooklyn, according to the 1915 New York state census.\n\nPines was a member of the Humane Club, a society for the prevention of cruelty. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 7, 1916 and March 15, 1918, used his birth name, Noah Pines, in a list of members. The April 6, 1919 edition of the Eagle used Pines’s birth name and nickname in an article about the Boy Scouts.\n\n161 Has Troop Paper.\n\nAn interesting Troop paper called the Scout Courier is issued monthly by Troop 161. The editor in chief is Noah Pines, and associate editors, Sam Shapiro and Will Pankln. Some excerpts follow:\n\n…Ned Pines has organized the Rattlesnake Patrol. This is the third patrol, leaving only another patrol to be filled to complete the troop roster. Who is going to found the next patrol?\n\n…Rattlesnake—Ned Pines, patrol leader; A. Wassenberg, assistant patrol leader.\n\n…Troop 161 meets at the Borough Park Y.M.H.A., 14th ave. and 60th st.\n\nThe Eagle, November 23, 1919, named Pines’s father and older brother as members of Troop 161. Pines’s future as a publisher was foretold in the Eagle, April 11, 1920, below:\n\nForm Company.\n\nAt the last meeting of the board of editors of the Scout Courier, official organ of Troop 161, it was decided to form an association to be called the Scout Courier Printing and Publishing company. The purpose of this company is to print and publish Scout magazines. Any troop desiring its paper printed should address Ned Pines, editor, at 1430 50th st.\n\nIn another publishing venture, Pines “advertised” in the Eagle’s Junior Eagle Exchange on May 2 and 9, 1920: “WANTED—Amateur papers for a collection. Write Ned Pines, 1430 50th st., Brooklyn, N.Y.”\n\nIn the 1920 census, Pines was in Brooklyn at 1430 50th Street. His father was in real estate, and his younger brother was named Kermit. The census enumerator recorded Pines’s first name as “Nora”. Who’s Who said Pines attended Columbia University from 1923 to 1924. He continued in scouting through the mid-1920s. The Eagle, January 20, 1924, noted his status.\n\nScout Myer Beckman has been appointed senior patrol leader. Scout Albert Kaplan, assistant senior patrol leader. Former Senior Patrol Leader Sydney Cantor has resigned, but is still staying with the troop. Veteran Scout Ned Pines has been made Assistant Scoutmaster. Through these columns we congratulate Mr. Pines….\n\nAccording to Who’s Who, Pines was president of Pines Publications from 1928 to 1961.\n\nThe 1925 New York state census and 1930 census said Pines resided with his parents and siblings at 260 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. His 1930 occupation was publisher.\n\nThroughout his life, Pines was involved in a number of charities. The Eagle, January 21, 1934, reported his work on the Junior Federation ball.\n\nPreparations for the biggest ball in the history of the Junior Federation of the Brooklyn Federation of Jewish Charities are being made this year, the committee in charge announced yesterday.\n\nThe ball will be held at the Hotel Plaza on Saturday night, Feb. 17, and the proceeds will be added to the funds raised by the junior group to meet its quota in the Spring campaing [sic] to be conducted by the Federation to take care of the budgetary allotments to the 25 affiliated societies.\n\nThis year's event will be the fifth annual ball and the first time it has been held outside Brooklyn. Several thousand tickets have been sent out and there has already been reported considerable response.\n\nAmong those giving a large proportion of their time to the arrangements are Ned L. Pines, chairman; Miss Blanche Posner, Miss Anita Hirschhorn, Miss Charlotte Seplowitz and Miss Josephine Bachrach.\n\nAccording to Who’s Who, Pines married Jacquelyn Sangor on August 29, 1938. The New York Times reported the birth of Jacquelyn’s two daughters, in 1939 and 1942, and referred to her as “the former Miss Jacquelyn Sanger [sic] of Chicago.”\n\nThe Echoes, 1931 yearbook of New Trier High School, Winnetka, Illinois\n\nInFunnybooks: The Improbable Glories of the Best American Comic Books (2014), Michael Barrier wrote:\n\n…Sangor had entered publishing with Cinema Comics, which was incorporated in September 1939….It also packaged comic books for other publishers, starting with Nedor Publishing Company. Nedor was owned by Ned L. Pines, who had married Jacquelyn Sangor….It was probably that family connection that brought Sangor into publishing in the first place (and provided him with the necessary financing). Pines was a leading publisher of pulp fiction….Pines needed to take only a short step to enter the comic-book business.\n\nSangor testified in 1943 that Pines called him in July or August 1941—that is, around the time that Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Comics made its debut —“and told me that he would like…to get a magazine with animals in the order of the Fairy Tales, talking animals and we discussed it, and I started on it about that time. Early in 1942 Sangor delivered the contents of the first Nedor talking-animal comic book, Coo Coo Comics no. 1, for publication in August….\n\nPines has not yet been found in the 1940 census. The Times, May 11, 1942, said his address was 965 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\nMt. Morris Enterprise (New York), December 17, 1952\n\nNed Pines (left), publisher of REAL Magazine, and Otto E.

The Alabama Divorce Index, at Ancestry.com, said it was in July, while Who’s Who said August. Pines remarried to Maxine Firestone, with whom she had two sons.\n\nPines passed away May 14, 1990, in Paris, France. His death was reported the following day in the Times.\n\n(Next post on Monday)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nAnatomy of a Logo: Skull & Bones\n\nOn September 12, 1991, I went to the DC Comics office and met with art director Jim Chadwick. He gave me a photocopy of Ed Hannigan’s rough cover design for his 3-book series, Skull & Bones, which Ed described as “A tale of Cold War intrigue set entirely in the Gorbachev era Soviet Union.” Jim wanted me to work out the letter design of Ed’s bilingual logo.\n\nBack at my studio, I enlarged the photocopy and drew a grid over the words. I placed tracing paper over the photocopy and sketched out the letters.\n\nNext, I drew guidelines on the tracing paper and refined the letterforms.\n\nOn September 23, I faxed the results to Jim. He called back and said, “Make the letters bolder.”\n\nThe next day I worked on a bolder version of the logo and alternate ampersands. I faxed the new version on October 3 and it was approved.\n\nOn October 10, I enlarged the bold version and added guidelines. It was positioned on my light box then a sheet of LetraMax was placed on top. The inking was smooth and quick. I delivered the finished logo on Monday, October 14.\n\nMonths later, the original art was returned. I saw that the first letter of the Russian word had been changed. Someone in the production department had drawn a new letter and rubber-cemented it over my art. When I peeled off the patch, a spot of the ink came off with it.\n\n(Next post on Monday)\n\n↧\n\nTypography: Comedy\n\n↧\n\nTypography: New Chinatown and Exception\n\nLos Angeles Chinatown\n\nException Shop in Guangzhou, China\n\nToday is the Chinese New Year 4713\n\nthe Year of the Goat / Ram / Sheep\n\nRelated post: Chop Suey\n\n(Next post on Monday: Chinese Oreo Cookies, Part 4)\n\n↧"
