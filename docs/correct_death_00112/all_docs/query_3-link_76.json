        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \"The Cross of Snow\"\n\nIn the long, sleepless watches of the night,\n\nA gentle face--the face of one long dead--\n\nLooks at me from the wall, where round its head\n\nThe night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.\n\nHere in this room she died, and soul more white\n\nNever through martyrdom of fire was led\n\nTo its repose; nor can in books be read\n\nThe legend of a life more benedight.\n\nThere is a mountain in the distant West\n\nThat, sun-defying, in its deep ravines\n\nDisplays a cross of snow upon its side.\n\nSuch is the cross I wear upon my breast\n\nThese eighteen years, through all the changing scenes\n\nAnd seasons, changeless since the day she died.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow's wife died tragically when an ember from the fireplace caught her dress on fire and burnt her so badly that she died a few days later. Longfellow tried to put out the fire, and it is said that his face was so badly disfigured that he grew the familiar long beard to hide the scars.\n\nEighteen years later he was looking at a book with pictures of the far west and the mountains when he came across a picture much like the one reproduced here. The poem that resulted is \"The Cross of Snow,\" one of his most poignant and touching sonnets."
