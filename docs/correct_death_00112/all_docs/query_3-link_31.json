        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is buried in the Mount Auburn Cemetery, Watertown, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, USA. (Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell and Robert Creeley are also buried here.)\n\nTomb of Longfellow\n\nFollowing the death of his first wife, Mary Storer Potter in Rotterdam, Longfellow returned to Cambridge and became a lodger at Craigie House where he was to live for the rest of his life. The house was later given to him and his second wife (Francis Appleton) as a wedding present.\n\nIn 1861 Francis tragically died after accidentally setting fire to her dress whilst melting wax to seal envelopes containing cuttings of her childrens' hair. In an attempt to douse the flames Longfellow received serious burns to his face. This made it difficult for him to shave and explains why he subsequently wore a beard.\n\nLongfellow's gift for writing accessible poetry with deceptively simple rhymes made him the most popular poet of his generation second only to Tennyson.\n\nWith the publication of The Song of Hiawatha (1858) Longfellow also became one of the first American writers to embrace native american themes.\n\nHe died on March 24th 1882, after a short illness, just a few days after he had written his last poem The Bells of San Blas. At his funeral, a passage from The Death of Chibiabos was read out.\n\nTwo years after his death he became the first American poet to have a bust placed in 'Poets' Corner', Westminster Abbey, London.\n\nHis other works include: Evangeline (1849), The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858), Tales of a Wayside Inn (1863) and Christus (1872)."
