OF CURTISVILLE DIED LAST NIGHT\n\nDeath came last night at 7:20 to relieve the suffering of Frank Goodwin Sr. whose condition during the past 48 hours had been such that recovery was impossible. Members of the family had been summoned to the beside Friday morning when it was apparent that the sick man could not survive for many hours. He had been ill for several weeks with stomach trouble and it is possible that his affliction was of a cancerous nature. The funeral services will be conducted at the late home near Curtisville Monday morning at 10:00 and Rev. Polly Couch will officiate. The deceased was a well known and respected resident of the community, he had many friends which gave their assistance during his hour of illness. The deceased was 72 years of age.

Goodwin of Elwood. About eleven years ago he was married the second time to Mrs.David Lilly, sister of S.D. Rouls of this city and the wife survives, but she is in poor health. No children were born to this marriage.\n\n12 DEC 1922 CONTINUED\n\nFrancis M. Goodwin, son of Enoch and Lavina Goodwin was born Apr. 6, 1850 in Rush Co., In. He was a member of a family of 16 children, they are not all full brothers and sisters as his father was married 3 times. Of the first marriage there were 8 children of yet 3 are living, they being James of Baton Rouge,La. WM. of Argos,In. and Leander of Curtisville, In. Of the 2nd marriage there were also 8 children, all of these are now gone as this man was the last to go. Francis came to Tipton Co. with his parents when a boy, locating on what is now James McCorkle's home and not only this county but this immediate neighborhood has been his home from early childhood. In 1883 he came to his home and has lived here ever since until his removal by death. Apr. 15,1869 he married Miss Sarah A. Frazee, 10 children were born to them, all lived to be grown exept Jesse who died in early childhood-Elmer at the age of 29 and Chloe at the age 16.The children yet living are WM. of Elwood, Sarah A. Rush near Windfall, Addenda Retherford and Francis M. near Tipton, Laura Parr, Nellie Wann and Luttie Drake near Curtisville. Jul. 28, 1911 his wife died entirely breaking up the home, as the children were all married. On the last day of Nov. 1912 he married Mrs. Louisa Lilly. They have been happily together and during her sickness a year ago he was so grieved thinking his home would soon be broken up again. Mr. Goodwin was always a farmer, industrious, upright and honorable, kind husband and a good neighbor. Mr. Goodwins health had been falling for some time, but for the last few weeks he had been confined to his house and later to his bed. His suffering at times was instense. The end came friday evening at 7:30 Dec. 1, 1922 peaceful & quiet just as he had lived after a journey here of 72 years. His wife & children were expecting his leaving, but it was so unwelcome and was a shock. This fathers death came the same day as his daughters death 23 years before, so it is another reminder that death is no respector of persons, as there is no age exempt, no climate where we will live forever, for there is a reaper, whose name is death & with his sickle keen he reaps the golden grain & the flowers that grow between.\n\nNotes for SARAH FRAZEE: Sarah died of paralytic stroke.\n\nNotes for LOUISA ROULS: Sister of S.D.

They were on their way to Curtisville when struck by the train. There were not witnesses to the accident except the train men whose names were unknown to the Pennsylvania employees at the station here, but whose homes are said to be at Richmond. The engine stopped at Curtisville long enough to notify the people there of the accident and a party in which was James Kane,husband of the woman killed,went to the scene. The Elwood ambulance made promt response to the notice from the station here. The bodies of Mr. & Mrs. Goodwin were found near the crossing and removed to the home.The former was probably killed instantly and the later lived for a few minutes. Mrs. Kane's body was found some distance from the scene of the accident and she lived for half an hour after reaching the Goodwin home. The bodies were brought to the York Morgue here and later removed to Edgar M. Clarks where hundreds of persons called to learn the particulars of the shocking accident. Dr. S. M.Cotton of Goldsmith, coroner of Tipton County, could not be reached last evening,the telephone office at that place closing at 6 o'clock on Sunday, but came to Elwood this morning to hold an investigation. He viewed the bodies and questioned the members of the family and from the information gained will give a verdict of accidental death, he will require that the men on the engine responsible for the death of these people appear and testify. Following the coroners investigation the bodies were removed to the Goodwin home. Preminent Tipton County people, Douglas Goodwin and his wife were among the best known residents of eastern Tipton County and they had a wide acquaintance in this city. Besides the daughter whose death occured yesterday they have three children; Mancil Goodwin of this city and George and Claude of Tipton County. Douglas was a half brother to Leander Goodwin of Curtisville, Mr. Kane and with his wife was spending the week-end at the Goodwin home, he had walked into Curtisville earlier in the day intending to join the party as they came through on their way to Elwood. The Kanes had no children. Elwood people who drive in the county north say that there ia a plain view of the track at this point and cannot understand why the driver of the car did not see the train approching from the north.The engineer of the train is alleged to have told the Curtisville people that Goodwin was driving slowly and that it looked as though he was going to stop the automobile at the crossing. The engine was running from Logansport to Richmond light. Goodwin knowing that the afternoon passenger train had come south was probably not expecting another train at the hour and relaxed his usual vigilance. The funeral services will be conducted at the Goodwin home north west of Curtisville Wednesday morning at 10:30 o'clock by Rev. Omer McCoy of Greentown.\n\nChildren of STEPHEN GOODWIN and LAURA MARSHALL are:\n\n161......i......WILLIAM CLAUDE GOODWIN, b. February 13, 1880, Tipton County, Indiana; d.

JAMES KANE MEETS DEATH IN AUTO ACCIDENT\n\nMrs. James Kane age 35, wife of James Kane an employee of the Lippincott glass factory, was killed in an automobile accident yesterday afternoon at what is known as the California Crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad six miles north of Elwood. In the car with Mrs.Kane were her parents, Mr. & Mrs. Douglas Goodwin, aged 65 and 60 respectively. Mr.Goodwin was a well known farmer living near Curtisville. The bodies were brought to Elwood,the automobile was dragged some distance and almost totally demolished, the automobile party had left home shortly before and were on their way to meet Mr. Kane,coming from Alexandria to join his wife, who had been spending the weekend with her parents. The crossing where the accident happened is regarded as being very dangerous, there were no witnesses to the accident and it is thought that Mr.Goodwin,who was driving did not hear the approaching engine until too late to avert a collision. It was a switch engine that was returning from Kokomo that struck the auto and it is now thought to have been operating at a high rate of speed. James H. Edwards of this city reports that he saw the same engine and says it was running at a very high rate of speed. The accident occured very close to the farm owned by Mr. Edwards father near Curtisville, the Goodwin home is also a short distance from the fatal spot. After striking the machine, the engineer rushed the engine to Curtisville and notified the people of the accident, they hurried to the scene and took charge of the bodies, Mrs.Kane had no children, her husband alone surviving her, the Kanes are highly respected by all who knew them and the dreadful accident is universally deplored by their friends, Mr.Kane is nearly frantic with grief, they reside at the foot of east John St. having recently purchased the little home in which they lived. The Times Tribune learned just before going to press that the three bodies of the fatal accident will be taken from the Clark Morgue at Elwood to the Goodwin home near Curtisville, where the funeral services will be held Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock, interment will be at the Elwood City Cemetery.\n\nTHE ALEXANDRIA DAILY TIMES 22 Apr 1941\n\nUNUSUAL BLOOD INFECTION ENDS LONG SICKNESS\n\nJames Kane, 55, former member of the city school board and for forty years associated with the Lippincott Glass Co. and Aladdin Industries here, died at 1:30 a.m. today at the family home at 415 east John St. In January 1940 Mr. Kane was stricken with a rare form of blood-stream infection and had been unable to follow his trade of millwright since. For several weeks he was a patient in Ball Hospital at Muncie for treatment and for a time during the past winter showed some improvement as the result of blood transfusions and other remedial treatment. His condition became worse a few weeks ago, however and since then he had been sinking steadily. The body was removed to the Roger C. Gipe mortuary to be prepared for burial and rested there today pending the completion of arrangements for the final rites. Mr.Kane was born in Meeker Co.,Minn. on Oct.26,1885. His parents James and Lucy Olive Butts Kane were native Hoosiers and after a few years residence in Minnesota returned to Indiana and made their home in Elwood. When Mr.Kane was 15 years of age he took employment here with the old Lippincott Glass Co. with which he was conected until it went out of business, then he became associated with its successor Aladdin Industries and had continued his employment there until failing health forced his retirement. In early manhood he was married at Elwood to Dessie Goodwin, who met death in an automobile accident in 1920. On Apr.4, 1928 he was married to Mary Gladys Dean at Elwood and they have since made Alexandria their home. Members of the family have been active for many years in the First Christian Church here, where Mr.Kane held various official positions through the years. Surviving members of the immediate family include the wife and three children; Mary Barbars, Myra Mae and James Woodrow, Mr. Kane also leaves four brothers and three sisters; Edward Kane of Alex.

LOUISA ANN GOODWIN (THEOPHILUS HENDRICKS, WILLIAM, AARON) was born October 23, 1850 in Ripley County, Indiana, and died December 20, 1937 in Huron, Lawrence, Indiana, USA. She married THEODORE A. PRIDEMORE February 08, 1868 in Dover Hill, Martin, Iowa, USA, son of ANDREW PRIDEMORE and JANE SLOAN. He was born November 04, 1835 in Willow Valley, Martin, Indiana, USA, and died November 08, 1931 in Huron, Lawrence, Indiana, USA. dkb at netplus.com has her marrying Theodore on February 8, 1866 in Willow Valley, Lawrence, Indiana, USA. Sources include Donna Conley (conley at blueriver.net)\n\nNotes for LOUISA ANN GOODWIN:\n\nPer http://www.familytreelegends.com/trees/badge757/6/data/4620\n\nHe was a private in Company G, 50th Regiment, Indiana Volunteers, enlisted Nov. 14, 1861 at Bedford IN and discharged Sept. 10, 1865 in Montgomery, Alabama. He applied for his military pension Sept. 11, 1920 in Shoals, Indiana. Louisa applied for Theodore's service pension on December 8, 1931 in Shoals, Indiana.\n\nBy Nona Joan Bridges Adamson, GGrandaughter of Dory and Louisa Goodwin Pridemore.\n\nAs told by Glen Pridemore - Paul Pridemore - several of the Cooper sisters - all Grandsons of Dory and Louisa.\n\n.....When the Civil War ended Grandpa Dory was serving as a Scout. His unit had reached the south part of Georgia. Rather than take his discharge, Grandpa Dory volunteered to accompany a train load of Confederate prisoners being returned to Texas. After seeing the prisoners to their destinations, Dory then returned to Martin Co., Indiana. His Mother, Jane Pridemore, had moved to Clay County, Illinois with the family of her older son, Jacob, so there was no one living in the family cabin. He had other family nearby though, the Roberts families and the Johnson families. He was quite content to be on his own. One morning after spending the night with his Johnson cousins Dory was walking home following the well marked path through the woods and over the fields, he had to pass a new cabin that had been built on Goodin Hill while he was away. As he got closer to the clearing a young girl came out the cabin door with a basket of wet clothes. She walked across the yard to where a rope was suspended between two sturdy trees. She was barefoot, but even dressed for work, she was a \"purty sight\" for the War veteran. When she saw him, she turned quickly and went back inside. But Dory was \"smitten\"!! He decided right then that he wasn't going on over to Illinois like he had planned, but was going to stick around and see more of that \"purty little thing\".\n\n.....The \"purty little thing\" was 16 year old Louisa Ann Goodwin, the oldest daughter of Theopolis and Fanny Goodwin. Dory had already heard about the \"newcomer\" who was working for the railroad that was being built through Martin Co. Theopolis wasn't much pleased when Dory begin to \"pay court\" to his daughter. Dory had built up a reputation as a \"wild one\" before he enlisted. The frontier folk were slow to forget, particularly so since Dory loved to tell stories about his pranks. Dory didn't scare easy though, and stuck with his courting until his pretty Lou agreed to sneaking off to get married. They set up housekeeping in Dory's old cabin. Dory wasn't afraid of work, and made a fair living for his pretty Lou and the babies that came along. He had a drinking problem though, and was often in trouble with Lou when he didn't get home with his pay.\n\n.....Louisa's family, the Goodwins, had moved on down to Gibson County. One of her uncles had a farm and was in need of help. Dory decided to take the offered job and move his family down to Gibson Co. He was celebrating the move with his Johnson cousins and had more than a bit too much to drink. The cousins got to wrestling around and Dory ended up biting off part of the ear of one of the guys. That sobered him up enough for him to leave for home, and within a day, to pack his family on a train headed for Gibson Co. He loved to tell the story though, and in his telling of the events, he had bitten his cousins ear off, and fearing trouble from the older Johnson family, had left in a hurry. They lived in Gibson County for several years.\n\nBy Nona Joan Bridges Adamson, daughter of Irene Cooper Bridges Owen Grandpa Dory called her Lou. Both Grandpa and Grandma were blind during their last years. For a few years they continued to live in their home. Son Tom lived next door. Tom tied a rope to the back of the house by the door and stretched it out to their outhouse so they could get back and forth. My mother, Louisa Irene Cooper, daughter of Candice Pridemore Cooper, went down to stay with Grandma and Grandpa. She was supposed to stay 2 weeks and then her twin sister, Evelyn, was supposed to come down on the train that stopped at Willow Valley and Irene would go home. It was very lonely for Irene as she was used to life with her 14 brothers and sisters. On the day Evelyn was supposed to come, Irene was packed to go home. When the train pulled in, Evelyn wasn't on it. So Irene spent another 2 weeks with her Grandma and Grandpa. The one bright spot in those 4 weeks was when her Aunt Effie came down on the train and took Irene down to Shoals. Later Grandpa Dory and Grandma Louisa took turns staying with their children. I remember visiting Grandma Candice and Grandpa George Cooper when I was 5 or 6 when Grandma Louisa was stying with them. She set in her rocking chair in the middle of the living room so she could hear what was going on. She didn't have any teeth and chewed Juicy Fruit gum. She became upset when everyone went into the kitchen and yelled out for Candice, demanding that she had company or was taken into the kitchen. When the meal was ready, Grandma Louisa took her gum out of her mouth and stuck it to the arm of her rocking chair before going in to eat. When she finished, one of my aunts went with her out to the toilet, then when she came back, she set down, put her gum back in her mouth, and started rocking.\n\nA member of the Christian Church, Theodore died of heart disease in the home of his youngest son Thomas, having been blind a few years before his death.\n\nShe died in the home of her youngest son, Thomas.

He was born March 1826 in Hutchinson Precinct, Bourbon, Kentucky, USA, and died 1897 in Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky, USA. She married (2) HEZEKIAH KINDER September 03, 1901 in Bourbon County, Kentucky.\n\nNotes for HENRY A. BUTLER:\n\nhttp://www.rootsweb.com/~kygenweb/kybiog/bourbon/butler.ha.txt\n\nHistory of Bourbon, Scott, Harrison and Nicholas Counties, Kentucky, ed. by William Henry Perrin, O. L. Baskin & Co., Chicago, 1882. p. 450.\n\n[Bourbon County] [Paris City and Precinct]\n\nH. A. BUTLER, farmer; P. O. Paris; is among the self-made men of this county. He was born in March, 1826, in Hutchinson Precinct; the eldest child born to Francis M. Butler and Rachel Wheat. By the death of his father he was left in care of his mother, who was unable to provide for her three children left upon her hands without any visible means of support. When a youth of twelve, he embarked for himself, working out by the month at very low wages. His school advantages were very limited indeed. Upon his attaining the years of manhood, he was employed to drive and handle stock for other parties; during this time he made fifty trips to New Orleans and forty to New York, eleven of which were performed on foot, the trips occupying seventy days each. In 1863 he purchased 150 acres in Menard County, Ill., for eighteen dollars per acre; two years and a half after he sold it and realized thirty-six dollars per acre; he then purchased 170 acres in Fayette County, which he kept a short time, then purchased 140 acres in Clintonville Precinct. In 1876 he purchased 220 acres, where he now resides, situated on the Flat Rock Pike, which farm he now owns. During the war he was engaged in the mule trade, in a small way on his own account, also was engaged in the hog trade, buying and shipping, which business he followed for several years and proved successful.
