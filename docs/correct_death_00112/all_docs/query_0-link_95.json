Since newspapers and magazines are important adjuncts to the creative literary forces at work in America, they fall within the scope of this compendium and have received full treatment. For convenience the material has been arranged in dictionary form, with cross-reference to related subjects. Bibli- ographical references for further study are given throughout the handbook. With so wide a field to cover the entries are necessarily concise. Author entries occupy the larger part of the handbook, but subject entries have not been slighted, as the most cursory examination of the follow- ing pages will reveal. Time and literary criticism have established certain American writers as major authors. Naturally these have been included* besides hundreds of minor authors about whom readers frequently discover that it is almost impossible to find information. For this reason American Authors and Books places special emphasis on obscure and neglected writers, presenting biographical and bibliographical facts about them where available. The exact date of birth and death, place of birth, and the important books of each author are given, the latter being arranged chronologically by first edition dates. Editorships of books, newspapers and magazines me indi- cated. If the author is also an educator, the name of the subject taught, the name of the institution with which the author is connected, and the inclusive years of that connection are given. Biographies, bibliographical notes, and other pertinent bits of information are given. In addition to authors there are several hundred entries for editors, publishers, booksellers, librarians, printers, book collectors, presidents of the United States, national heroes, and famous characters about whom books have been written. Among the last named are such entries as Daniel Boone, John Paul Jones, Calamity Jane, Johnny Appleseed, Billy the Kid, and John Brown. Establishing death dates for these hundreds of persons proved a difficult task. Many authors have passed from public notice, and their whereabouts are not known. The Dictionary of American Biography yielded many facts about deceased authors. Space does not permit us to make individual acknowledgments to the many men and women who contributed biographies PREFACE to that scholarly work. The obituary pages of The New York Times were s cann ed for the years between the publication of the Dictionary of American Biography and the present compilation. Alumni publications of many col- leges were also valuable sources of information. Several hundred novels, plays, short stories, poems, essays, orations, songs, hymns, and non-fiction books which have contributed to our literary history, receive separate entries, with publication dates. Most of the novels and plays and important books, have been briefly described. It is suggested that the reader look under the individual title entry as well as under the author entry, for in many cases a title merely mentioned under the author’s name receives full treatment under the separate title entry. For instance, in- formation about The House of the Seven Gables may be found under Na- thaniel Hawthorne, under the title The House of the Seven Gables, under the character entry Pyncheon Family, and under Salem, Mass., the place associated with the novel. This practice of consulting every possible entry associated with a book or author will greatly increase the value of this book. To aid those who remember the name of a particular character in a book but cannot recall the exact title or author, hundreds of characters are given separate entries. The entry is under the last name if both names are given, for instance under Sawyer, for Tom Sawyer. There are a few excep- tion, such as Aunt Polly, which is alphabetized under Aunt, and Black Tom ■rolpnabetized under Black. To distinguish fictional characters from real per- sons we have entered them in small type. Over 700 magazines have been described, with dates of founding, im- portant editors, contributors, etc. Since much of our literature made its first appearance in magazines it seems fitting that full attention be given them. c J CS °* ^ tAtlmttc Monthly, North A merican Review, Harper's Monthly, Century Scnbner's Magazine, Southern Literary Messenger, and St. Nick- mori. ’ IT*™ ° f ** 1Uerary master P ieces of the past.

The best piuMa m ® valuable files for local is umm Lisi °> pan in tht dweloXeM \"T PUyed such a \" important V! never been collected into one book. Ametie&t Authors and Books has made an effort to indude as many, of these firms as possible, $nd to give them adequate presentation. > ' J For the same reason we have included numeyrous descriptive entries for book dubs; historical societies; libraries; learned bodies and associations which have devoted themselves to the collection and preservation of books and manuscripts, and the restoration of national shrines. Our literary herit- age has been enriched by such organisations as the Massachusetts Historical Society, Grolier Club, American Antiquarian Society, American Bibliograph- ical Society, Junto, American Library Association, American Historical So- ciety, Library of Congress, The New York Public Library, Boston Public Library, and the Boston Athenaeum. That Americans have the privilege of visiting the Old Manse, Craigie House, the Poe Cottage, Mount Vernon, the House of the Seven Gables, Gettysburg, Plymouth Rock, Independence Hall, Bunker Hill Monument, “Old Ironsides,” Williamsburg, the Alamo, etc., is due almost entirely to the efforts of these literary and historical societies which have raised funds to restore and preserve them. There has been an increasing interest in the regional aspects of our lit- erature during recent years. Evidence of this may be found in the sectional novels and histories, and the many doctoral dissertations devoted to local his- tory, customs, and literature. For the benefit of teachers, librarians, writers, and students, we have included over four hundred cities, states, regions, andfl places with literary associations, with lists of guidebooks, histories, novels, plays, and poems written about them. The reader is referred to such typical entries as Concord, Maine, Southwest, Chicago, New England, South, Wil- liamsburg, Boston, San Francisco, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Virginia, Texas, Mississippi River, Hudson River, Cape Cod, Northwest Territory, Oregon Trail, The Hermitage, Greenwich Village, Beacon Hill, etc. It is sug- gested that readers consult all related subjects. For instance, material on the Rocky Mountains may be found not only under Rocky Mountains, but under Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Oregon Trail, the West, etc. Material on New York City may be found not only under New York City, but under New York Stale, Hudson River, Brooklyn, Washington Square, Gramercy Park, Greenwich Village, Broadway, etc. This is a particularly important rule to observe since the same books are not listed under each related entry. It is best to work from the smaller geographical area to the larger; for instance, Provincetown, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, New England. For the use of writers and teachers many special lists have been in- cluded. The following are typical: dime novels, censorship, whaling, witch- craft, Mormons, children's books, pirates, circus, cowboys, Indians, the Negro, Civil War, World War, Pony Express, United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, scouts, sea, humorists, nature writers, utopias, ABBREVIATIONS anon., anonymous ft., flourished assoc., associate Ulus., illustrated b., born lit., literary c. circa, about MS., MSS., manuscript, manuscripts comp., compiler n.d., no date cop., copyrighted prod., produced (plays) d., died prof., professor dept., department ed., edited q.v., quod vide, which see AMERICAN AUTHORS AND BOOKS A.
