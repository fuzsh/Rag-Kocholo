        "text": "DESCRIPTION: A large, two-story yellow house, in the Georgian style, seen from outside a gate. The house has symmetrical windows and decoration, with a large white front door at the center. Two white pilasters flank the door and two more define the outside edges of the facade. Above the door is a window with an American flag on a short pole. On each side of the house are four windows, arranged two over two. All the windows have twelve panes and are painted white with dark green shutters. Above the second story is a tall roof with two dormer windows and a triangular pediment centered above the front door. Along the edge of the roof and surrounding the triangular pediment is a decorative dentil molding edge. The top of the roof has a flatter pitch surrounded by a short white balustrade railing. Two large yellow chimneys rise above the dormers. A porch with white columns is barely visible on each side of the house. In front of the house, centered on the front door, is a series of twelve steps--three sets of four steps and a landing. A straight gravel path flanked by lawn leads to the steps. The fence and gate in the foreground is painted dark grey with a diamond lattice pattern. The house is framed with two lush trees and the sky is open above its roof.\n\nCAPTION: The Longfellow House today.\n\nCREDIT: NPS\n\n↑ back to top\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote that “all houses wherein men have lived and died are haunted houses. . . .” If we could summon the ghosts of the Vassall-Craigie-Longfellow House, we would see men and women who have given shape and substance to our world. For two centuries this was a family home, but it was also a celebrated gathering place for singers and soldiers, politicians and poets. Its story encompasses America’s fight for independence, the efforts to create a national identity through literature, and the endeavors by one family to preserve and share the treasures of many nations.\n\nIn 1843, when Longfellow and his bride Fanny Appleton became the owners of 105 Brattle Street in Cambridge, they were already well-acquainted with its illustrious history. The Georgian-style mansion overlooking the Charles River was built in 1759 for John Vassall, a merchant and ardent loyalist. The house stood among other magnificent estates belonging to fellow elites, friends, and relatives. In 1774, the Vassalls joined their neighbors in fleeing the insurgency preceding the American Revolution.\n\nIn July 1775 Gen. George Washington arrived in Cambridge to take command of the fledgling Continental Army, which was laying siege to British-occupied Boston. He chose the large and strategically located Vassall house as his headquarters. Here Washington welcomed his wife Martha to their first wartime home, received dignitaries and fellow patriots, plotted strategy with his generals, and celebrated the evacuation of the British army from Boston in March 1776.\n\nAndrew Craigie, the Continental Army's first Apothecary General, bought the house in 1791, set about increasing its grandeur and size, and married Elizabeth Shaw in 1793. Lavish living and failed investments plunged them into debt, leaving Elizabeth to take in boarders after her husband's death. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a young Harvard professor and up-and-coming poet, began renting two rooms in 1837. “They were once George Washington’s chambers,” he marveled to a friend. The house again became a social center, this time for Longfellow’s circle of friends and colleagues.\n\nIn July 1843 Longfellow married Fanny Appleton. Her father Nathan Appleton, a wealthy textile manufacturer, presented Castle Craigie to the couple as a wedding gift. The Longfellows thrived in the stimulating environment of Cambridge. Henry left his teaching position at Harvard to devote full time to writing and scholarship. Fanny was a gracious hostess and perceptive critic of art and literature who shared in her husband’s many activities. Throughout their lives the Longfellows and their five children—Charles, Ernest, Alice, Edith, and Anne—cherished their piece of tangible history. They filled their days with learning and their home with evidence of travels, personal interests, and intellectual pursuits.\n\nIn 1913 the Longfellow House Trust was established by the children of Henry and Fanny Longfellow to preserve their family home and open it to the public. The site was donated to the National Park Service in 1972. We invite you to explore this extraordinary house and to meet the people whose indelible spirits remain.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nDESCRIPTION: This modern view of the Parlor interior looks across the room at an angle, with two walls within view. When viewing the photo, the wall on the left is white paneled wood, with a light grey marble fireplace in the center. The wood paneling is highly decorated with architectural elements. Above the fireplace are decorative pilasters holding up a triangular broken pediment complete with thick dentil molding. This same dentil molding runs around the room at the top of the wall. To the right of the fireplace in the center of the photo, is a recessed, arched alcove. The second wall on the right of photo is covered in highly decorative wallpaper with pink and green floral medallions on a light beige background. A large oil painting in a thick gold frame dominates the wall, depicting a boy and girl in colonial clothing. The boy stands, wearing a tan coat, waistcoat, and breeches to the knee. The girl sits, wearing a white floor-length dress with a pink sash, and places her hand on a dog next to her lap.\n\nThe floor is covered in wall-to-wall carpet, a reproduction, with a large-scale white, red, and green floral pattern on a black background.\n\nThe room is furnished with tables, couches, and upholstered chairs.\n\nA four-branch chandelier with gold structure and white frosted shades hangs from the ceiling at the center of the room.\n\nCAPTION: The parlor is the most elegant room in the house and was used as a drawing room by both Martha Washington and Fanny Longfellow.\n\nCREDIT: NPS\n\n↑ back to top\n\nEven at the height of his fame, Longfellow never felt slighted when visitors came to his door asking to see “Washington’s Headquarters.” Longfellow took pride in the legendary status of his house. Decisions and alliances made here would ultimately lead to freedom from Great Britain and the beginnings of the new nation.\n\nGeorge Washington took command of the Continental Army in July 1775, shortly after the first shots of the Revolution were fired. When he arrived in Cambridge to set up his headquarters, he faced a bleak prospect. The mostly young and inexperienced army of nearly 20,000 officers and militiamen had no tents, blankets, or gunpowder, and lacked many necessary items. They faced smallpox, dysentery and New England's bitterly cold winter. “The reflection on my situation and that of my army produces many an unhappy hour when all around me are wrapped in sleep,” Washington wrote. “I have often thought how much happier I should have been if . . . I had taken my musket upon my shoulder and entered the ranks.”\n\nWashington and his officers were determined to get matters on course and met frequently in the room that later became Longfellow’s study. Washington was also busy consulting with a long list of friends and dignitaries including Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Benedict Arnold, and the chiefs of several American Indian tribes. Celebrated African American poet Phillis Wheatley was invited to visit after Washington received inspiring verse from her.\n\nMartha Washington arrived at headquarters in December 1775, after a month-long journey from Virginia and a political controversy while in Philadelphia. Her son, daughter-in-law, and enslaved servants from Mount Vernon joined her in transforming headquarters into a home. Establishing a precedent for the rest of the war, she provided inspiration to the men and acted as a trusted advisor, confidant, and source of emotional support for the commander.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nDESCRIPTION: Oil painting in bleak, grey winter tones. In the background, a small crowd of people gathers around a stopped carriage in front of a large two-story house. Two female figures appear to have just exited the coach. They stand facing a tall man in a blue coat and buff breeches, presumably George Washington.\n\nIn front of the house appears to be a broad lawn surrounded by a circular drive, very different from the modern image of the Longfellow House. A group of men, some carrying muskets, stand on the lawn. Five muskets are stacked together in a triangular shape behind them.\n\nThe coach is pulled by six horses, three of which are ridden by black men in uniforms of red coats and white pants. Two black men in the same uniform sit mounted on horseback on the circular drive. These are likely enslaved men.\n\nThe house is seen at a slight angle, showing the symmetrical front facade and the side of the house with a roofed porch with white columns.\n\nCAPTION: \"Lady Washington's Arrival at Headquarters, Cambridge.\" by Howard Pyle, 1896.\n\nCREDIT: Boston Public Library\n\n↑ back to top\n\nDESCRIPTION: A sepia-tone photograph of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow seated in his study. Longfellow sits behind a round center table which is piled with books, papers, and writing implements. Among the bric-a-brac visible on the table are a cup packed full of quill pens, a ceramic inkwell, a metal sculpture of an owl, a match holder in the shape of a monkey, and a glass of water. A portable, folding writing desk is in the foreground, with a stack of paper centered on its cloth surface and several quill pens lined up at its top. Over thirty books are arranged on the desk in piles and in a row with their spines up. One book is placed open, face down on the table. A dark floral rug or tablecloth is visible only at the edges of the table, otherwise its surface is completely covered.\n\nLongfellow has shoulder-length white hair and a full white beard and mustache. He sits almost in profile to the camera, leaning his chin on his fist, his elbow resting on another book. He wears a dark jacket and white shirt with a narrow dark cravat.\n\nBehind Longfellow is a white-painted door, a wood and cloth firescreen, and a side table with more books standing in a row and stacked. Hanging on the wall behind him is a charcoal portrait in an oval frame of Charles Sumner, senator and close friend of the poet. A lamp with a glass chimney and reflective shade hangs from the ceiling on a single metal pole.\n\nCAPTION: Longfellow in his study, ca. 1876\n\nCREDIT: NPS\n\nRELATED TEXT: \"All that is best in the great poets of all countries is not what is national in them, but what is universal.\"\n\n—Henry W. Longfellow, 1849\n\n↑ back to top\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow achieved much in his long life, but he was first and foremost a writer. “I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature,” he told his father in 1824, “my whole soul burns most ardently for it. . . .” Longfellow went on to be one of America’s most celebrated poets, offering the young nation heroes and stories of mythic shape and dimension.\n\nLongfellow was born in 1807 in Portland, Maine, the second son of a prominent lawyer and grandson of General Peleg Wadsworth, a hero of the American Revolution. After graduating from Bowdoin College he traveled in Europe immersing himself in its languages, literature, and history. “To my youthful imagination,” he said, “the Old World was a kind of Holy Land.” A speaker of eight languages, Henry spent his early career teaching language and literature at Bowdoin and Harvard colleges. In 1839 his first collection of poetry was published. The popular Voices of the Night included “A Psalm of Life” reprinted in newspapers across America.\n\nHenry’s congenial marriage and social life in Cambridge allowed his creativity to flourish. He retired from teaching in 1854 to devote himself fully to writing and was soon enormously successful. Longfellow was the nation’s first professional poet and gained an international reputation. His poetry collections were translated into dozens of languages and became instant bestsellers at home and abroad—enjoyed by laborers and scholars alike. Longfellow received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge universities in England and was honored in Poets’ Corner of Westminster Abbey. Composers Franz Liszt and Felix Mendelssohn set his works to music.\n\nAs a teacher and scholar Longfellow was familiar with heroic themes in classical literature. His own characters and stories in epic poems like Evangeline and The Song of Hiawatha were larger than life and have been thoroughly absorbed in American culture. In “Paul Revere’s Ride” the poet turns a virtually unknown Boston silversmith into an icon on par with the founding fathers. After his wife’s death in a household fire in 1861, Longfellow took on the monumental task of translating Dante’s Divine Comedy. He found consolation in this epic tale of salvation and enduring love. With friends and colleagues he founded the Dante Club, which met Wednesday evenings in his study for conversation and supper.\n\n“I should have to think long if I were ask’d to name the man who has done more . . . for America,” said poet Walt Whitman after learning of Longfellow’s death in 1882. It was a fitting tribute to the man who moved the world with words and spoke the language of his country’s heart and history.\n\nAll are architects of Fate,\n\nWorking in these walls of Time;\n\nSome with massive deeds and great,\n\nSome with ornaments of rhyme.\n\n—from “The Builders” by Henry W. Longfellow, 1849\n\n↑ back to top\n\nDESCRIPTION: The interior of the Longfellow library is a spacious, light-filled room with white-painted paneled walls. This modern photo looks at an angle across one half of the room, with the center of the space and two walls visible.\n\nAt the center of the room is a large rectangular library table with legs and frame of dark, ornately carved wood, and a green felt surface. It is cluttered with stacks of books, an inkwell, a vase, and a bronze sculpture of the Roman god Mercury. Hanging above the table is a large, six-armed chandelier with gold metal arms and swags and frosted white shades.\n\nTwo windows are visible on the left wall, each flanked by tall red curtains in a rich drapery fabric. Between the windows is a tall bookcase with glass doors. A small white statue of a standing woman sits in front of the glass doors of the bookcase. In front of the bookcase is a Gothic revival sofa with dark carved wood framing three seat backs, upholstered on their centers in dark green velvet. Placed in the back corner of the room stands a Japanese folding screen. Its gold panels showcase a nature motif of tree branches and flitting birds.\n\nThe wall on the right features a marble fireplace, flanked by tall, ceramic vases from Japan. The mantle is crowded with bronze figures, including a sculpture of a woman from the shoulders up, candelabras, an urn, and two dogs. Positioned on the wood paneling above the fireplace is a gilded parlor clock from France.\n\nThe floor is covered in a wall-to-wall carpet with a repeating pattern of red, yellow, and blue medallions.\n\nCAPTION: The spacious library held musical performances and other social gatherings.\n\nCREDIT: NPS/David Bohl\n\n↑ back to top\n\n\"We have decided to let Father purchase this grand old mansion if he will . . . how noble an inheritance this is where Washington dwelt in every room.\"\n\n—Fanny Appleton Longfellow to Thomas Gold Appleton, 1843\n\nHenry and Fanny Longfellow’s cosmopolitan and hospitable style made their home a vibrant place. They enjoyed formal meals with friends and family, good conversation, and the occasional musical performance in the library. Henry’s growing fame brought a widening range of visitors to his door, from perfect strangers to the famous—and infamous.\n\nNotable guests included writers Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Anthony Trollope, and Julia Ward Howe. At breakfast one morning was Charles Dickens, here on his first trip to the United States. Teacher and scientist Louis Agassiz came often to visit, and Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil met both Longfellow and Emerson here while traveling in New England. Singers, actors, and musicians made a pilgrimage to Cambridge, among them the “Swedish Nightingale” Jenny Lind and stage actress Fanny Kemble. One of Henry’s last visitors was playwright Oscar Wilde. “Longfellow was himself a beautiful poem,” recalled the flamboyant Irishman.\n\nBorn in the wake of the American Revolution, Longfellow witnessed the momentous events of the 1800s: westward expansion, the social and political turmoil surrounding slavery, and the Civil War. These were subjects for his poetry and conversation.\n\nCharles Sumner, the fiery abolitionist and legislator, was a frequent guest and fanned the flames of Henry’s anti-slavery beliefs. Other members of this influential circle were James Russell Lowell and William Dean Howells—editors of the durable Atlantic Monthly founded in 1857 as a platform for public opinion.\n\nGuests sooner or later found themselves immersed in family life. With five children, a large staff of servants, and numerous pets, the Longfellow home was far more than a shrine to the past or scholarly ivory tower. Henry and Fanny’s children were full participants in the world within the house—and grew up to embrace the world at large.\n\n↑ back to top\n\nDESCRIPTION: Sepia-tone photograph of man, woman, and two boys seated in a studio in front of plain, dark background. To the left, Henry Longfellow sits in full profile facing his family. He wears a white shirt, dark waistcoat and cravat and dark jacket. He has wavy brown hair just below his ears and a pronounced nose. To the right, Fanny Longfellow sits in three-quarter profile facing Henry. She wears a dark-colored dress with a white collar and a brooch at center front. She wears her hair up at the back, with the sides arranged around her ear. In between them, their son, Charles, age 5, is seated slightly off-center. He has short hair parted at one side and wears a dark coat with a white collar, which has a row of three buttons under one shoulder. He faces front, but his eyes point to the viewer's right. The white cuff of his mother's sleeve is visible at the base of his neck. The younger son, Ernest, age 4, sits directly in front of his mother, facing the camera. He wears a plaid jacket with a white collar, which buttons down the center front. His forehead is slightly furrowed and he has a small frown.\n\nCAPTION: Henry and Fanny Longfellow and sons Charles and Ernest, ca. 1849\n\nCREDIT: NPS\n\n↑ back to top\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis bronze sculpture shows the full figure of a young man, with his right hand reaching toward the sky. If he were a basketball player, shooting a layup, his right leg would be raised in front of him, as he leaped off of his left. But in this case, the right leg is kicked back behind him, just below his waist, as if he is being pushed skyward rather than propelling himself in that direction. To illustrate that propulsion, his left foot presses against a shaft of wind, blown from an upturned face in the base of the sculpture, whose cheeks are puffed out from exertion. This leaping man represents the mythological figure Mercury, taking flight. Besides his winged helmet and vine-woven shorts, he is nude. His feet have small sets of wings protruding from his ankles. In his left hand, he holds a staff, entwined by two serpents, called a caduceus. He stands on a circular base, adorned with a series of indistinguishable figures, shown in relief. The top and bottom on the base are made of black marble.\n\nCAPTION: Bronze copy of “Mercury” statue by Giovanni de Bologna, ca. 1850\n\nCREDIT: NPS\n\n↑ back to top"
