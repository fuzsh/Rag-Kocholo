He was one of eight children of Stephen Longfellow, a local lawyer, and Zilpah Wadsworth, daughter of a Revolutionary War veteran.\n\nYoung Henry enrolled at Portland Academy and then Bowdoin College. He was a bright student who excelled in foreign languages. As a young boy, Henry was interested in stories set in foreign places like the plays of Shakespeare and The Arabian Nights.\n\nWhile in Bowdoin, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne, a fellow student. By 1825, he graduated and traveled to Europe to study modern languages. After three years, he returned to teach in Bowdoin.\n\nIn 1831, Longfellow married Mary Storer Potter, a former classmate, and publisher.\n\nIn 1843, seven years after the death of his wife, Longfellow married Frances Appleton, with whom he had six children.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow’s Literary Career\n\nAside from teaching, Longfellow published his first book, Outre-Mer: A Pilgrimage beyond the Sea, a description of his European travels.\n\nIn late 1835, tragedy struck when Longfellow’s wife, Mary, died after miscarrying. He grieved for her in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nBy 1835, he returned to the United States and took a position at Harvard’s Modern Languages Department.\n\nAfter three years, he published Voices of the Night, his first collection of poems, followed by Ballads and Other Poems.\n\nVoices of the Night contains poems like Hymn to the Night, The Light of the Stars and The Psalm of Life, which gained him popularity.\n\nIn 1847, he published Evangeline, a book-length poem that depicts the tragic love of two young couples separated by time.\n\nBy 1854, after years of budget cuts in teaching, Longfellow decided to write poetry full-time.\n\nHiawatha and The Courtship of Miles Standish and Other Poems were soon published.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, Longfellow wrote Paul Revere’s Ride as a call for courage.\n\nIn 1861, Civil War broke out and the United States was divided between the North and the South. At the same time, Longfellow’s second wife, Frances, died from burn wounds after her dress caught fire. Distraught, Longfellow did write for a long time.\n\nAfter six years, he published the translation of Dante’s The Divine Comedy.\n\nBy the end of the Civil War in 1865 until 1880, Longfellow published more books of poetry.\n\nLegacy and Death\n\nOn March 24, 1882, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow died of acute peritonitis. He endured severe stomach pains and opium treatment for days before his body finally gave up.\n\nWhen Longfellow died, he was one of the most successful and famous American writers. In addition, his works were also recognized in Europe with admirers including Queen Victoria, Walt Whitman and Oscar Wilde.\n\nAmong his poetry includes Poems on Slavery (1842), The Golden Legend (1851), Flower-de-Luce (1867), Christus: A Mystery (1872), Three Books of Song (1872), Aftermath (1873), The Masque of Pandora and Other Poems (1875) and Ultima Thule (1880). In addition, he also wrote fiction works like Hyperion: A Romance in 1839 and Kavanagh: A Tale, in 1849.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about Civil War poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow across 22 in-depth pages.
