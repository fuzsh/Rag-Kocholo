E. Sissman (1928–1976)\n\nWE WERE NOT, either by temperament or experience, meant to live in paradise, L. E. Sissman wrote. It was for him a felt perception, a lived truth. Sissman’s well-crafted, highly formal, densely packed verse has a quirky radiance, a wildly focused perspicacity, a verbal joyousness that sometimes evokes moments of perfect happiness, perfect health, but mostly inhabits a recognizably fallen world, a civic middle zone, a daily mid-twentieth-century American realm. He was a close urban observer, a cosmopolitan poet with a baroque sensibility and an omnivorous appetite for contemporary life, contemporary manners. He was part Randall Jarrell (The Marschallin, Joy Street, July 3, 1949), part Weldon Kees (At the Bar, 1948), part Frank O’Hara (The Village: The Seasons). Like Wallace Stevens, he was Orpheus in a business suit—a man who earned his living as an advertising executive by day, and his soul as a poetic maker by night.\n\nSissman had an ethnographic eye for his own era, his own realm. He was a sort of lyrical anthropologist of his chosen milieu, the Northeast Corridor. Reading his poems you can hear the commuters ordering Scotch and branch water in the terminal bar, you can see the landscape passing through the windows of the moving train. It is no wonder that John Updike has written so insightfully about him, both in prose and poetry, since he shares with Updike an ability to evoke a moment in time in all its shimmering particularity. Many of his poems have dates in their titles: East Congress and McDougall Streets, Detroit, May 25, December 27, 1966. They are moments lifted out of time, held aloft and immobilized in the permanence of print.\n\nSissman had a special gift for eliciting, somewhat ironically, his salad days in the 1940s (Here I will entertain the young idea / Of Cambridge, wounded, winsome, and sardonic). He faced the discouraging fifties, which were for him devoid of poetry, with a wry survivor’s wit (At last with you the first time in my life, / My anchor, my harbor, my second wife). He wrote with sharp-eyed clarity and bright forthrightness about the mid-1960s and early 1970s, for him years of propulsive creativity in the face of a constantly approaching death (Very few people know where they will die,/But I do: in a brick-faced hospital, / Divided, not unlike Caesarean Gaul, / Into three parts). It was characteristic of Sissman to notice, in writing about his death place, that the hospital was split up like Julius Caesar’s conquered territory, and to pun on the word Gaul (gall). He was quiet, urbane, and high-spirited. Behind it all, his poems shine with a restrained but very real human longing and passion. They have a ruthless authenticity. They live in time. They remember paradise.\n\nLouis Edward Sissman was born in Detroit on New Year’s Day, 1928. He was part Jewish, part gentile, a gifted only child with an enormous vocabulary and a prodigious appetite for facts. (His remote and peripatetic parents, both ardent socialists—a proud, good-looking mother and a hard-working but feckless father—stand on two sides of his selected poems like ushers at the mortal gates.) He would later recall with amusing clarity what it was like to be a quiz kid on the radio and, at thirteen, to compete in the National Spelling Bee in Washington where, as he put it, he bested some poor little girl from ... Kentucky on an easy word (‘chrysanthemum,’ as I remember) and became the National Champion, the emoluments of which office included a $500 Defense Bond, a wooden plaque with two bronze owls on it, and an all-expense-paid trip to New York. The passion for particulars is revelatory, like the disclosure that follows: My main reaction to all this was to lose my lunch more frequently than usual, a long-standing symptom of my revulsion to performing in public, and to conceive a lifelong hatred for the exploitation of the young. Sissman’s sense of his own vulnerability enlarged into a sympathy for the suffering of others. Irony was protective covering, and compassion runs like a secret current through his work.\n\nSissman entered Harvard in the fall of 1944. He once said that he had never felt the merest traces of belonging anywhere until he took the trip east to Boston. At sixteen he was tall and gangly (six foot four, two hundred pounds), awkward, footloose, romantic—a bohemian in the making. The former quiz kid had been soured by his experiences with teachers; he was intellectually precocious but emotionally unprepared for college. Bad grades and an insolent attitude got him booted out for a couple of years after the war. A dean reputedly said to him, We have no room at Harvard for geniuses. (See In and Out: Severance of Connections, 1946.)\n\nSissman got a job as a stack boy in the Boston Public Library, moved through a series of furnished rooms, pursued girls, wrote poetry, grew up.(See In and Out: A Home Away from Home, 1947.) He was readmitted to Harvard in 1947, married for the first time in 1948, and sailed through to graduation cum laude in 1949. He won the Garrison Prize in poetry(Canzone: Aubade) and was elected class poet. He matured under the tutelage of John Ciardi, Andrews Wanning, and Theodore Morrison; his primary poetic models were W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and, above all, W. H.Auden. His work is rife with allusions to all three. Like Auden, he was a civic poet with a taste for narrative and a gift for metrical forms, for unfolding poetic sequences. Perhaps his natural formality was a way of distancing and ritualizing experience, since he was always an explicitly personal writer.\n\nThe fifties were for Sissman an off-kilter decade as he struggled to find his way. He had what he called a short, unhappy stint in New York. He worked as a copywriter and copy editor at Prentice-Hall, got a different job, equally undesirable, equally underpaid, with a publishing firm that collapsed, and returned somewhat ignominiously to Boston, where he moved on the fringes of the demimonde and had a series of disconnected jobs(campaigning for John F. Kennedy, selling vacuum cleaners, etc.) until eventually he landed in an advertising firm, which he liked. Some of these experiences can be gleaned from his later poems, but he seems to have written no poetry for a decade. As his friend and editor Peter Davison has written, \"Seen in hindsight his poetic silence is so curious as to be nearly as deafening as the seven-year silence that befell Wallace Stevens after Harmonium.\"\n\nBy the end of the 1950s Sissman had found his path. He started the decade as Lou and ended it as Ed. He married for the second time, now happily, and he and his wife Anne settled in the far suburb of Still River, an hour west of Boston. He enjoyed the craft of advertising, where his verbal dexterity and quick wit, as well as his knowledge of products, of how things worked, stood him in good stead, and he worked successfully in it for the rest of his life. He was also intermittently writing poetry again, some of it revived from college notebooks. In Writing, 1963 Sissman dramatizes with some precision the experience of awkwardly coming back, of being stirred into poetry again, into verbal life:\n\nSelf-denying\n\nCan get you something if, behind the blank,\n\nUnwindowed wall, you don’t become a blank,\n\nUnfurnished person. He was lucky. In\n\nThe dark of those bare rooms to let, there stirred\n\nSomething: a tattered arras woven with\n\nA silent motto, as Eliot said. A word\n\nNow, in his thirty-sixth summer, surfaces, leading\n\nA train of thought, a manifest freight, up to\n\nThe metalled road of light—for the"
