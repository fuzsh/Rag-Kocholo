Notes\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr.\n\nProfessor of Medicine at Harvard; Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth; one of the founders of the Atlantic Monthly (1857); member of Phi Beta Kappa, Harvard. Oliver Wendell Holmes was an accomplished physician and teacher of medicine, but he is best remembered today for his poetry.\n\nHe began writing poetry at an early age; one of his most famous works, “Old Ironsides,” was published in 1830. Surrounded by Boston’s literary elite, which included friends such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell, Holmes made an indelible imprint on the 19th century literary world. Many of his works were published in The Atlantic Monthly, a magazine that he named. For his literary achievements and other accomplishments, he was awarded numerous honorary degrees from universities around the world.\n\nMarr Date1840"
