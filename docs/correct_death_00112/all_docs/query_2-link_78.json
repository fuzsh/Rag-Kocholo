        "text": "On 28 May 1880, the entry in Mary Alice Haines journal reads:\n\nI came to Mrs. Dana as a nursery maid to dear little Dicky, a lovely little blue-eyed baby of nine months.\n\nMrs. Dana, was the former Edith Longfellow, daughter of poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The “golden-haired” Edith immortalized in her father’s poem “The Children’s Hour” was Wadsworth’s middle daughter.\n\nEdith married Richard Henry Dana III, son of author, Richard Henry Dana, a friend of Longfellow. Their first child, Richard Henry Dana IV “Dicky”, was born in his grandfather’s home, the Craigie House, Cambridge, Massachusetts on 1 September 1879.\n\nDicky’s nursery maid, Mary Alice Haines (who the Dana’s called “Allie” or “Alice”), was my 3rd great-aunt, born 8 May 1855, in Richibucto, Kent, New Brunswick, Canada, to John Hains and Alice/Alise Edith Childs. Siblings included Joseph, Alexander, George, James, William John (my 2nd g-grandfather) and Lizzie. After their mother’s death in 1860, their father remarried Jane Clare adding four half sisters, Alice, Annie Elizabeth, Caroline Sophia and Christina.\n\nMary was enumerated with the Dana family on 4 June 1880 at 39 Mount Vernon Street [likely an error, they lived at number 33 not 39] in Boston, Massachusetts. She was listed as a servant.\n\nTen days later, on 14 June 1880, Mary writes:\n\nMrs. and Mr. Dana start for Nahant [Massachusetts] to spend the summer, taking with them their dear little Dicky and myself.\n\nThe following day she adds:\n\nI don’t like Nahant. I think it is a perfectly horrid stupid place.\n\nThen on 1 Sepember 1880\n\nWe expect to return to Boston soon. I shall be glad, although I have had a very nice time after all. I went to ride often with Mrs. Dana and took little Dicky; and very often we row in the evenings.\n\nThey arrived in Boston 20 September 1880. On Christmas she writes:\n\nMrs. and Mr. Dana went to Cambridge with Dicky to lunch with his Grandpapa, Mr. Longfellow, and I had the afternoon to myself.\n\nShe writes often of her days with Dicky. Mary’s brother Joseph passed away 24 January 1881 in a hospital in London. A few weeks later she writes:\n\nEver since the death of my dear brother I have had lovely flowers sent to me. Little Dicky frequently brings me a pretty rose in his own, sweet, dimpled hand.\n\nTwo days after her brother’s death, Mary writes:\n\nDicky had little brother born last night. He calls him a little dolly and wants to shake hands with him [Henry “Harry” Wadsworth Longfellow Dana]\n\nPictured below, Mary with Dicky and Harry:\n\nOn her birthday, Mary received an apron from Mrs. Dana and flowers from Dicky. On 28 May 1881 she writes:\n\nOne year ago today I came to take care of little Richard H. Dana III, a dear little blue eyed boy of nine months with long golden hair. I was not at all taken with his appearance for I thought him very dull and not at all interesting. But today he is a real boy in every degree and running around and saying many words. He is very fond of flowers. I am now with him in Cambridge making a visit to his grandfather, Professor Longfellow, and he enjoys being here. He is a dear little fellow. I am getting so fond of him. I hardly know how I can ever leave him and he is so fond of me. He calls me A-ie; and since he has been here he has learned to hail the horse car; and if it doesn’t stop he will run into the street and scream, car! car!\n\nBeginning on 18 June 1881 she again summered in Nahant with the family. When they returned to Boston on 21 Sept 1881 she reports that Mrs. Dana and Dicky were sick with “slow fever”. On 15 October 1881 she comes to Cambridge (from Boston) to Mr. Longfellow as Mrs. Dana is very sick with typhoid fever. On 8 November she writes that she is still in Cambridge, with no hope of returning to Boston for weeks, as Mr. Dana is now very sick. The children are fine.\n\n28 November: We are still in Cambridge. Oh dear I do wish I could go home. I am so tired of Cambridge.\n\nMrs Dana writes to Mary: Dear Allie, Miss Alice said the children went to bed at half past five. I don’t understand, for Harry always had his supper at six. Have you changed all his hours–and why? I want him to have his supper as late as possible so as not to make such a long night, and I don’t understand why both children don’t go to bed as they always used to. Do write and tell me about it. I miss you all very much and wish you could come home again. I had no idea you would have to stay more than a week or two, but now I suppose we can’t have you back until Mr. Dana gets better.\n\n17 December: This is my last Saturday in Cambridge. I was so glad Mrs. Dana came out to Cambridge and said we could go home Monday. I am so delighted. Mr. Longfellow had a party for the children today. Dicky and my sweet little Harry were there.\n\nOn Christmas, Longfellow and Dicky presented Mary with the Longfellow Birthday Book written by Charlotte Bates, with quotes from the works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to go with each day of the year. The quotes appear on the left-hand page, and opposite them, two dates appear. There is room under each date to write the names of people who have that birthday. Longfellow added his signature under his own birth date.\n\nOn 24 March 1882 she writes:\n\nThis is a sad day in our home. Mrs. Dana’s father, Professor Longfellow died. We were to sail today but owing to Mr. Longfellow’s death we are to remain till 6 April.\n\nOn April 4th Mary traveled to New York with the Dana family. It was stormy and rainy. They boarded a ship, which departed for Europe, the following morning. Mary woke to sailors singing, it reminded her of her five brothers (all of whom were seamen). The sea was calm for a few days, then “frightful…running mountains high” causing seasickness. Finally, on April 15th they arrived in Liverpool.\n\nMary writes extensively of her journey, the tug boat that pulled them ashore, a forest of vessels, so many colors, funny looking cabs and ancient buildings. First stop was the Northern Western Hotel. She was shocked to learn, in Europe, she and the children were to eat dinner with the other servants in a separate small dining room.\n\nA few days later the group traveled by rail to London, where she noted pretty green fields, so much greener than those at home, trees in bloom and “funny” thatched houses. They drove four miles via carriage through the lovely Hyde Park to the hotel. She loved London’s cleanliness, the grand looking granite buildings and pretty Thames River. She rode from Kensington to Westminster using the underground railroad (which she described as a horrid black hole”), to visit the hospital where her brother Joseph died, to meet his nurses. She describes the view out his window which includes Westminster Bridge, Parliment House and Big Ben A few days later she visited his grave.\n\nOn April 24th they arrived via steam car at Hotel St. Romain in Paris, Mary writes:\n\nI went to ride today with Mrs. and Mr. Dana and the children. We had a lovely ride. How beautiful. I think I never saw anything so lovely. We saw the ruins of the castle of the French Emperor, and also the castle where Napoleon lived, all all the beautiful monuments….little did I think when I used to read about these historical buildings when I went to school, that I would ever see them.\n\nNext stop, via steam car, was Skes La Barre, France [?], then over the Alps into De Touin, Italy, on to Florence then out to the Villa Angelina [possibly in Sorrento ?] where she describes oranges, lemon and olive trees and writes of Dicky tossing bread into a pond with hundreds of kinds of fish who swam to feed. Two girls at the villa taught her some Italian.\n\nMary is amused to see people washing clothes in the river instead of with a tub and washboard. They slapped the clothes on stones to beat the dirt out, instead of rubbing them with the hands.\n\nAfter several days, they returned to Florence where they visited a high cliff overlooking the city and she attended a Scotch-Presbeterian church service (her journal describes the beautiful church, tells of them chanting hymns vs. singing and mentions the sermon was a striking one), then on to Milan for shopping and to see a cathedral and the evening gaslight illumination, then to Lake Como where they sailed in a steamboat and the following day took out a rowboat, “which charmed the children”. On her second anniversary with Dicky, he presented her a jewel case with a pretty set of ear drops and pin.\n\nOn 28 July she notes “there are eight of us” Mr. and Mrs. Dana, Dicky, Harry and myself, Miss Dana, Miss Isabella Dana. They travel to a number of villages – Switzerland is cold.\n\nOn July 30th she says she has been Harry’s nurse for one year. She is homesick much of the time. Although she enjoys the trip, she longs for letters from home and to be able to see home.\n\nThey traveled to Bologna, then Mr. and Mrs. Dana leave for Switzerland leaving Mary and the children behind. Here Mary writes “baby walked all around the yard for the first time”. A few days later she and the children traveled to Switzerland first by steamboat then via a carriage drawn by four horses.\n\non 11 August she writes:\n\nThusis, Hotel Viennala: We left here today but met with a sad accident and had to return to the hotel until Monday.\n\nMrs Dana writes home of the accident, where our Mary Alice saves baby Harry:\n\n…We meant only to stay here a day or two but an unfortunate accident has upset our plans and shaken our nerves. We engaged a very nice three horse carriage and started in fine style yesterday morning about nine o’clock , Richard and I upfront in the banquette with Dicky between us and Alice [Mary] and Harry inside. About 1 1/2 miles from Thusis the leader shied at a log on the side of the road and bolted right off the other side of the road, which was built seven or eight feet above a grassy meadow, with trees. There were no posts or railing and the leader going over first dragged the pole horses and carriage after him.\n\nRichard told me to jump out as I was on the up side, but it seemed so preposterous that we could go over and spoil our nice trip and perhaps all be killed in the bargain that I seemed paralyzed and stuck to my seat. R. could not get out past me and so over we went crash, the carriage turning completely over us but by a happy chance, whether by the struggling of the horses or not I don’t know, it turned half over again on to its side and so set us free.\n\nI had a confused sensation of dust and darkness, breaking wood and brown horses legs flying across my face and then with great effort I made a sidelong plunge to get away from the debris. I saw Dicky lying in a small ditch with Richard on top of him, but both alive. I was perfectly sure Harry was killed, and dashed back to the carriage turned on its side where in the midst of broken glass, cushions, baskets and boxes I found poor Alice crouching on her knees with Harry in her arms. His face was all bloody and she thought he was very much hurt for the carriage door had stuck him full in the face, but it turned out to be only a bad knock on his forehead and scratches on his face and nothing serious. Alice showed great presence of mind for Harry was sitting on the seat by her and when she found the carriage going over, she seized him in her arms protecting him from the sides and top of the carriage which pressed down upon her, bruising her arm and tearing her dress and apron.\n\nPresently we were all seated on the grass, dusty and bloody, the children wailing dismally, but all absolutely unimpaired! Was it not a miracle? It was such a relief to find we were not all killed or broken to pieces, we could hardly believe it, and I cannot really understand now how we escaped. Richard was very faint, but fortunately we had brandy in the lunch basket which revived us both and he was well enough to go back to the hotel. The driver with many “A, Dio!s” had disappeared and the horses were standing quiet as lambs, eating branches of the tree. Meanwhile we were the object of much interest and curiosity for the passers by, who saw with much dismay the broken carriage in the field below and two disheveled women holding two wailing children. All the beggars and children in the neighborhood flocked to the scene of disaster, the diligent stopped to inquire and many carriages. When they heard no one was hurt they went on again, the nervous females probably very unhappy for the rest of their journey.\n\nOne very kind Englishman came down to see if he could do anything for us. He seemed very much shocked, and finally presented me with a bottle of coloque [?] which I took to please him although we did not need it. My first thought was to get Dr. Wigglesworth and by dint of running part of the way Richard succeeded in getting back to the hotel just as he and his wife were on the point of taking the diligence over the Splugen [?]. They not only gave up going then but with the greatest kindness and generosity they insisted upon staying over until this morning to make sure that we were alright. I thought it was very good of them but I wished they would not do it for it was not necessary and it seemed too bad to spoil their plans as well as our own. And worse than all Mrs. Wigglesworth is very nervous about driving and of course this accident will not do much to reassure her. We saw them off in the diligence this morning and I felt very badly to see her so nervous. Dr. W came back in a carriage with R. to the scene of disaster and examined Dicky’s knee under an apple tree. It was very badly bruised and hurt him a good deal. Nothing was broken, however, and Dr. W. has examined it twice since and thinks it will be nothing serious. Poor little Dicky was very much frightened and I am afraid his nerves have received a severe shock. Dr. W. carried him carefully up to the carriage and all the town turned out to see us as we drove slowly through the main street.\n\nDr W. got us new rooms (ours had been given to others) escorted us to them and made us lie down. We kept Dicky in bed all yesterday but today he is dressed and sitting on a shawl in the garden. Harry did not say a word for full twenty minutes after the accident then when we were sitting on the grass he opened his mouth suddenly and said in the most piteous little voice “Dumpy down!” which made us all laugh….\n\nAfter a few days of recovery, they end the trip by touring Germany, visiting several spots including Heidelberg Castle and Strasburger Cathedral, they stopped again in Paris to shop and London where Mary again visited her brother’s nurses and grave. On 17 September they departed Europe, arriving in New York by the 25th on the Servia.\n\nThe journal comes to an end:\n\n29 Sept: One more day and I leave my dear boys. I am give them up to a new nurse Sunday evening.\n\n2 Oct: What a lonely day I spent. My first day away from my dear boys.\n\n22 Oct: John R. Stevens arrived here today from Michigan. We have not met for seven years.\n\nEdith Dana writes from Cambridge, 15 October:\n\nDear Alice,\n\nIt seems a very long time since you went away although it is only two weeks today. It was very hard at first. The first night I slept with Dicky and could not sleep at all. I was so worried and troubled and did not know how we could ever get on without you. The new nurse did not come until three o’clock Monday afternoon. And I was so tired out by that time, she had to take the children that night and has had them ever since.\n\nDicky seemed to feel your going more than Harry. He cried a great deal the first night “oh Mary gone!”, “Mary come back! come back!””Mary stay” and he was very suspicious of Margarete at first and would not let her do anything for him. She seems to be a very good girl and is kind and gentle with the children.\n\nI am only afraid she will be too gentle with Dicky and will not be firm enough with him. She is very fond of Harry already and thinks he is the best baby she ever saw. Everything goes on the same as when you were her, only Dicky’s hair that looks a little differently. Margarete curls it, but it looks more meek than when you did it. Dicky has a velocipede now and can ride it in the street.\n\nThey have seen “Cuddy Waddy” several times and she is going to be with Grandma in Boston. At least until Christmas time she and her ___ are now going to stay at 33 Mt Vernon St. and perhaps you will see her there. I hope I shall meet you there someday. Have you got all your things? Your parasol was in the corner of the big closet.\n\nMiss Annie is very glad you like her presents and says you need not trouble about writing. I was very sorry to here that John Stevens hurt his eye. I hope it is nothing serious. Be sure to tell him before you are married about your fainting fits. He has a right to know and it is your duty to tell him. If you do not he may blame you afterwards. Have you decided when to be married. I hope Johnie and Jenny are well [my gg-grandparents].\n\nI did not dare to tell the children I was writing to you but they would send a great many kisses if they knew. They are fast asleep now and look so sweetly. When Dicky plays steam cars he always says “Mary go too”.\n\nHarry has learned a good many new words. He can say “Jumbo” and “corner” and many others. Mr. Dana and I went to Newport last week for three days and saw Mr. Appleton and the girls who were all interested in hearing about you. The girls liked the bows we bought for them at the “Bon Marelie”\n\nI hope you will write to me.\n\nYours very truly\n\nEdith L. Dana\n\nMary was married in Boston, 26 October 1882, to John Roderick Stevens, an old flame from Canada (he had first married Lucy A Higgens on 10 Jul 1880, she died ten days later).\n\nAlice Longfellow sent a painting as a gift.\n\nThe newlyweds returned to Michigan where they raised a family of six (four who lived to adulthood).\n\nFor some time, Mary kept in touch with the family writing to Edith Dana and her sisters Alice and Allegra. The letters indicate they valued Mary’s confidence, advice and sympathetic ear as well as her more mundane services as nursemaid to the boys and any other family member needing help. Edith updates her with stories of the boys antics and progress and always sends their kisses.\n\nDrawing to Mary [Allie] from Dicky:\n\nA year after their European voyage, Edith writes saying:\n\nDear Allie, It is just a year ago today that we left this house to to to New York and sail for Europe. How thankful I am we are not starting off now! I wounder how how now we ever had the courage to undertake it with that two small children. Harry not even able to stand alone. I think we ought to be very grateful all at home again safe and sound. And you really married and out at “Dan Teacy’s house” [?] in Michigan! How much has happened in one short year!…\n\nIt goes one to tell stories of the boys and how excited they were to receive her letters. She congratulates Mary on the baby expected in August and offers to send some of Harry’s baby clothes. She mentions Mrs. Dana’s fall on Mt. Vernon St. which resulted in a broken hip which is making her quite uncomfortable and depressed. She expresses how much they miss her and sends kisses from the boys.\n\nIn 1884, Mary is still sending gifts to the boys. She writes “Harry Haines” on Harry’s card, perhaps a private joke between them which Mrs Dana mentions in a thank you note sent from 33 Mt Vernon Street.\n\nIn another letter, Edith writes to Allie with well wishes for Jennie [Ferguson ?] and says that God can save her, just as he saved them in the carriage upset:\n\nIn 1885, Edith Dana writes saying it was very kind of Mary to name her baby Edith after her and hopes that she can meet her someday.\n\nDana children 1893:\n\n**Special thanks to Mary’s descendants for sharing her journal, photos, artifacts and letters.\n\nUPDATE August 2016:\n\nToday I visited the Massachusetts Historical Society on Beacon Street in Boston. In their manuscripts collection are the Dana family papers which include the journal of Richard and Edith (Longfellow) Dana III (a few pages below). Richard notes that Edith did not write in this time period. His writing adds color to Mary’s experiences. He speaks of Dicky as an infant and Harry’s birth; summers at Nahant; intimate details of having typhoid fever; his father-in-law’s death and the trip to Europe which includes his version of the carriage accident.\n\nTo be transcribed at a later date…. Next stop Cambridge to read through the Longfellow family letters!!\n\nI was honored to be the recipient of Aunt Natalie’s genealogy research binders, when she downsized to a smaller place. They were chock full of documents and letters that she had collected back in the 1970’s & 80’s via snail mail and by personally visiting libraries, repositories, cemeteries and ancestral towns.\n\nAunt Natalie on a “Roots” trip to Richibucto, Kent County, New Brunswick, July 1983\n\nShe had a few brick walls. One of her biggest? She was unable to identify the parents of Alice Edith Childs, wife of John Hains/Haynes, my 3rd g-grandmother. Thirty years later, so much is online, perhaps there are records available to solve the mystery!\n\nI haven’t uncovered a document that names Alice Edith Childs parents, but indirect evidence, when correlated, appears to point to Joseph Childs of England and Jannet Dunn of Dumfriesshire, Scotland.\n\nTo solve the mystery, I looked at all likely family members, not just my direct line ancestors.\n\nHere’s what I know:\n\nAlice Edith Childs was born about 1822 most likely in Canada. Some online, unsourced, trees, give her birth date as 19 April 1822 and birthplace as Fredericton, York Co, New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nShe married about 1848, John Hains/Haynes, who was born about 1824, son of Joseph Hains/Haynes III and Willie Nancy Ann Boone. Some online, unsourced, trees, give their marriage date as 17 March 1848 and marriage place as Fredericton, York Co, New Brunswick, Canada.\n\nUPDATE: May 2016 – new facts related to Alice – Blog Post – Losing a Mom, Alice/Alise Edith Childs\n\nAlice and John had at least 7 children who lived to adulthood:\n\nJoseph Haines (1849 – 1881)\n\nCaptain Alexander “Alex” Hains/Haynes (1850 – 1907)\n\nGeorge William Haines (1851 – 1914)\n\nJames Haines (1853 – 1875)\n\nWilliam John “John” Haines (1856 – 1939)\n\nMary Ann “Alice” Alvin Haines (1856 – 1924)\n\nElizabeth “Lizzie” Hains (1858 – 1920)\n\nAlice Edith Childs died 9 November 1859 and is buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Church, Rexton, Kent County, New Brunswick.\n\nPhotos courtesy John Childs\n\nTwo years later, in the 1861 census of Canada in Richibuctou, Kent, New Brunswick, John Hains a native born Episcopalian, working as a laborer, is listed with the following family (http://tinyurl.com/kzxexm2):\n\nJohn Hains 37\n\nJoseph Hains 11\n\nAlexander Hains 10\n\nGeorge Hains 9\n\nJames Hains 7\n\nMary Hains 6\n\nJohn Hains 4\n\nElizabeth Hains 3\n\nPatience Amerieux 45 (John Hains sister)\n\nThere is a second Mary Haines of about the same age, also enumerated in Richibucto, Kent, New Brunswick in 1861 with her “grandparents”. In this census, Janet Childs is listed as Scottish. Joseph Childs is listed as English (http://tinyurl.com/lltgpj9).\n\nThe household is as follows:\n\nJoseph Childs 72\n\nJanet Childs 64\n\nNicholas Childs 25\n\nRobert Childs 16\n\nMary Haines 7\n\nCould Mary Haines have been enumerated twice (this is my theory)? Or were there two Mary Haines age 6/7 in the area?\n\nA Jannet Dunn, wife of Joseph Childs is also buried in the churchyard of St Andrews Church, Rexton, Kent County, New Brunswick. John Childs (likely my cousin, a descendant of Christopher Childs and Elizabeth Crossman, a likely brother of my Alice Edith Childs) lives near the cemetery. In 2013, he sent photos of the two graves, Jannet and Alice Edith, and said in an email “they are very close to one other”.\n\nJannet died 2 April 1869 in Richibucto, which puts her birth about 1798; about 24 years old when Alice Edith was born, the right age to be her mom.\n\nA transcription from the local paper, claims Jannet was “native of Dumfriesshire, Scotland”.\n\nProvincial Archives of New Brunswick (PANB), Daniel F. Johnson\n\nA transcription to a marriage record for a Joseph Childs and Jannet Dunn is as follows:\n\nJoseph CHILDS Northumberland Co. Janet DUNN married: 3 Aug 1821 [Alice Edith was likely born 1822] by J Wheaton wit: George Pagan, B Goldsmith – EARLY NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY MARRIAGES [transcribed by D. Purdue from PANB Microfilm # 15488].\n\nJohn Hains and Alice Edith Childs’ daughter Mary Ann “Alice” Haines kept a diary in a fifty cent ledger book [transcribed and published by her grandson Ralph and his wife Peggy Stevens; copy in my personal files].\n\nShe recorded events of the three year period she was employed by Mrs. Richard H. Dana of Boston from 1880-1883. Mrs Dana was the former Edith Longfellow, daughter of Professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow of Cambridge. Mary was nurse to Edith’s two sons Dicky and Harry. She wrote frequently of her family.\n\nShe mentions the following:\n\nVisiting her Aunt Mrs Morton at Restigonche Bay – she later names Aunt Mary & cousin Janet Morton.\n\nDoing the old mill walk April 24 1880 with cousin Jenny Morton (same dates she was in Restigonche Bay)\n\nThe 1881 census of Restigonche lists the following Morton family (http://tinyurl.com/kns345p):\n\nAlexander Morton 59\n\nMary Morton 47\n\nAnnie Morton 25\n\nJanet Morton 19\n\nLizzie Morton 11\n\nEdith Morton 6\n\nWilliam Morton 30\n\nRobert Morton 28\n\nDavid Morton 21\n\nAngus Morton 17\n\nJoseph Morton 14\n\nMary Morton’s maiden name in a number of online unsourced trees is listed as Childs.\n\nBy 1871, Alice Edith’s husband John Hains/Haynes had remarried. He is found living with his new wife, Jane, and their four daughters in Richibucto. None of the children from his first marriage are living with him (http://tinyurl.com/mff3t3l).\n\nA Mary Ann Haines of the same age as our “Mary” in 1871 is found living in Chipman, Queens County, New Brunswick with a Quint family (http://tinyurl.com/nxh98or):\n\nAnson Quint 47\n\nHenry D Quint 36\n\nEuphemia Quint 40\n\nAnson Quint 3\n\nMyra Helen Quint 2\n\nRobert B Quint 6 months\n\nMary Ann Haynes\n\nFurther research shows that Euphemia Quint’s maiden name was Childs. In 1861, a 30 year Euphemia (indexed as Uphemy) Childs is found living in Harcourt, Kent, New Brunswick with a 60 year old Robert Dunn (http://tinyurl.com/kl847mq – possibly a brother or cousin to Jannet Dunn?)\n\nRobert Dunn 60\n\nUphemy Childs 29\n\nJames Raynalds 22\n\nRobert died in 1865. There is a tombstone that is likely his, in Chipman, Queens County, New Brunswick (same place where Euphemia is living in 1871). The deceased’s birth place is listed as Dumfriesshire, Scotland (same as Jannet Dunn).\n\nJohn Haines writes a letter to his daughter in Feb 1895, presumably Mary as the letter was found in a collection belonging to her grandson. In 1895 Mary was living in Michigan. John writes, “Remember me to the family and your aunt Euphemia and family” (based on census data, it appears Euphemia Childs may have been residing in Wisconsin in 1895).\n\nThere is also an Elizabeth Childs who names Joseph and Jannet as parents in her New Hampshire marriage record:\n\nAn old online message board post reads as follows:\n\nIf there were 10 children of Joseph Childs and Jannet Dunn (as per the message board post), perhaps they were:\n\n(1) Alice Edith (Childs) Haines, abt. 1822 – 1859: her daughter Mary Haines is likely the Mary listed with Jannet/Joseph Childs in 1861 census as “granddaughter”, Edith is buried very close to Jannet (Dunn) Childs; her likely daughter Mary Haines resided in 1871 with a probable sister Euphemia Childs.\n\n(2) George Childs abt. 1823 – ?: listed as witness to Mary Childs wedding (his sister?).\n\n(3) Christopher Childs, abt. 1829 – 1891: he was Presbyterian, lived in Richibucto in 1871 and had children named Janet, Joseph, Euphemia, Margaret, Elizabeth, Christopher & John (all similar family names). He married Elizabeth Crossman. In 1881 brothers Christopher & Robert Childs were living next door to one another in Richibucto; the 1891 Richibucto census lists a father of England and mother from Scotland; he died in 1891, no parents are named.\n\n(4) Elizabeth (Childs) Davis, abt. 1830 – 1912: she was born in New Brunswick and names her parents as Joseph Childs (born England) and Jannet (born Scotland) in her New Hampshire marriage record 18 May 1875. Her husband (Benjamin Davis) died in Concord, NH on 3 Jul 1885 and is listed as a widower. She was 45 when they married, it does not appear that they had children together (Benjamin’s will lists children Benjamin and Augusta – he was married at least 3 imes). She is later found as Elizabeth Knapp living with her brother James in BC in 1911. Her 1912 death record lists her as a widow and names her parents as Joseph Childs and Jean Dunn.\n\n(5) Euphemia (Childs) Quint, abt. 1831 –?: living with a Robert Dunn of the same village in Scotland as Jannet in 1861 (her uncle/cousin?), listed as a witness to Mary Childs wedding (her sister?) & living with Mary Haines in 1871 (her niece?); married Henry D. Quint\n\n(6) Jane (Childs) Little/Haywood, abt. 1832 – 1924: in 1861 living in Richibuctou and a Presbyterian. Children named Joseph, Janet, William Christopher, Mary, John & James (all similar family names); married (1) Andrew Little, (2) James Haywood\n\n(7) Mary (Childs) Morton, abt. 1836 – 1903: – listed as “Aunt Mary” in Mary Haines diary, George & Euphemia Childs listed as witnesses when she married Morton (siblings?). Names her children Janet, Joseph, Edith, Mary, Lizzie, William & Robert (all similar family names). The 1900 US census says her dad is from England, mother from Scotland. Note that the 1880 census says her dad is from Ireland (informant unknown); married Alexander Morton.\n\n(8) Nicholas Childs (female), abt. 1837 – 1919: listed with parents Jannet/Joseph in 1861 census, father Joseph in 1871 & living with her brother James in 1901 and 1911 in Westminster, British Columbia.\n\n(9) James Childs, abt. 1840 – 1923: listed with father Joseph in 1871 census – in 1881 he is living in Weldford with his wife Elizabeth Ferguson, listed as Presbyterian, dad is from England, mother from Scotland and has sons named James, Joseph & John (all similar family names – although John might be Elizabeth’s son). In 1901 he is living with his wife and sister Nicholas in Westminster, British Columbia. In 1911, James is with his wife and sisters Nicholas and Elizabeth in BC, all listed of English origin. In 1913, Elizabeth died and he married second Elizabeth Mitchell; they had three children, one of whom was named Janet Bertha Edith. The marriage record names James’ parents as Joseph Childs and Janet Dunn. In 1921 he and his family were enumerated in New Brunswick; the document claims his parents were born in Scotland. His 1923 death certificate names his father as Joseph born in Scotland.\n\n(10) Robert Childs, abt. 1845 – ?: listed with Jannet/Joseph in 1861 census & Joseph in 1871 census; in 1881 brothers Christopher & Robert living next door to one another in Richibucto.\n\nStill not definitive proof, but intriguing and pretty plausible…. I am hoping one of my long lost cousins who has the family bible or other family records can solve our mystery!! And maybe help with my burning question – if Jannet & Joseph are my 4th g-grandparents. where in Scotland/England were they born and what made them relocate to Canada?\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nIn the summer of 2014, my husband and I visited Richibucto.\n\nWe visited the cemetery and found that the graves of Jannet and Edith Alice are indeed very close together.\n\nUPDATE June 2016:\n\nAnd we have a DNA Match!! On Ancestry DNA, user aoife3 matches my DNA as a predicted cousin. The match is Euphemia (Childs) Quint, I am in the process of verifying this line but it looks promising!"
