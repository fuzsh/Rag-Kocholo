        "text": "Preliminary Note:\n\nIn what follows frequent reference is made to the different editions of FitzGerald’s Rubaiyat, as well as to other translations (notably that of E. H. Whinfield) and to the works of Heron-Allen. A very useful web-site, for comparing the four editions of FitzGerald published during his lifetime, can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.therubaiyat.com/\n\nThis site also contains the 1883 edition of Whinfield, cross-referenced to FitzGerald (and also, incidentally, Richard Brodie’s extraordinary anagrammatic paraphrase of FitzGerald.) As for Heron-Allen’s invaluable reference books, these can be found online, via the web-site of the Dutch Omar Khayyam Society:\n\nhttp://www.omarkhayyamnederland.com/translators/english/e-heron-allen---1898/index.html\n\nor directly, along with an assortment of Heron-Allen’s extraordinary range of other works, at:\n\nhttp://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Heron-Allen%2C%20Edward%2C%201861-1943%22\n\nOne work of Herron-Allen's of which I wasn't aware until I was well into putting together this verse by verse commentary, was his book The Second Edition of Edward FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Umar Khayyam (1908; 1912.) Though there is inevitably some overlap - references to Hafiz, Anacreon and Tennyson, for example - surprisingly there is not a great deal! Heron-Allen quotes extensively from J.P. Muirhead's translation of Vaux de Vire (1875) and from James Thomson's Essays, Dialogues and Thoughts of Giacomo Leopardi (1905), for example, neither of which I have used at all. What I did discover via Heron-Allen was Herbert A. Giles' Gems of Chinese Literature (1884), which turned out to contain far more Omarian material than Heron-Allen himself used. Rather than insert this material bit by bit into the following verse by verse notes, however, I have opted to put it all together in Appendix 21, to which readers are referred.\n\nAnother verse by verse commentary, this time of the 5th edition, is The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam with a Commentary by H.M. Batson and a Biographical Introduction by E.D. Ross, published in 1900. Again, though there is some overlap, there is surpringly little of it, demonstrating, it would seem, that there is a lot of Omarian material out there!\n\nFinally I should add that in the course of my studies I came upon some interesting antecedents of Omarian thought in ancient Egyptian and Babylonian literature. These are not included in the verse by verse note that follow, but are gathered together in Appendix 2g, immediately following the section dealing with the related topic of ancient Egyptian and Babylonian Theodicy, Appendix 2f.\n\nVerse 1.\n\nAwake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night\n\nHas flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:\n\nAnd Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught\n\nThe Sultán's Turret in a Noose of Light.\n\nSunrise. The Sun (the Stone), when it rises (is flung) into the Sky (the Bowl of Night), causes the Stars to become invisible (it puts them to flight). According to FitzGerald’s note on this verse, “Flinging a Stone into the Cup was the Signal for ‘To Horse!’ in the Desert.” The image thus likens the start of the day to the start of a journey. The Hunter of the East is, again, the rising Sun, the Noose of Light being the hunter’s lasso.\n\nThis verse is a prime example of the assertion that the freshness and originality of the first edition of The Rubaiyat was rather spoiled by the revisions made in subsequent editions. The flinging of the stone into the bowl was particularly problematic, and may even have arisen from a scribal misreading of the original Persian (see below), but the image was, as FitzGerald put it (II.280-1), “so pretty and so smacks of the Desert Life….that it is worth risking it.” As Martin (note 1e, p.205) says:\n\n“Unfortunately, he was nagged by his friends and his conscience until he felt compelled to eliminate what he had invented. He ruined a superbly evocative opening in so doing, and for years thereafter he fiddled inconclusively with the stanza, trying unsuccessfully to find another way of breathing life into the flatness of the original.”\n\nThe verse in the fifth edition reads:\n\nWake! For the Sun, who scatter’d into flight\n\nThe Stars before him from the Field of Night,\n\nDrives Night along with them from Heav’n, and strikes\n\nThe Sultan’s Turret with a Shaft of Light.\n\nThe stone has disappeared – and in fact, it only ever appeared in the first edition. FitzGerald’s most detailed thoughts on the image are contained in one of his letters, written to Cowell in the summer of 1857 (II.280-1, as cited above.) Here he talks of the throwing of a pebble into a cup as “a sign of breaking up the Party…though in this case it does not mean breaking up any Party but that of Night, whose departure is a sign for the Drinkers to assemble.” (Hence this serves as a lead in to verses 2 and 3 below, with the drinkers assembling before the tavern door.) It does seem odd that the stone flung into a cup at the end of a party becomes, in verse 1, the Stone flung into the Bowl of Night to signal the start of the day’s party, but there it is!\n\nAccording to Heron-Allen (as note 11a, p.3-5) FitzGerald’s source of inspiration for the stone was verse 134 of the Calcutta Manuscript. But in the corresponding verse in other manuscripts, a word for “wine” (bāda) is used instead of one for “stone” (muhra), leading to the possibility that the verse from the Calcutta Manuscript is a scribal misreading, and that the image should be one of splashing wine into a bowl rather than casting a stone into a bowl. (If that sounds odd, the idea seems to have been that the spreading reddish colour of the dawn sky was being likened to the pouring of rosy wine into the bowl of the sky.)\n\nHeron-Allen also says that flinging a stone into a cup or pot “is the signal for ‘striking camp’ among tribes of nomad Arabs”, an assertion taken up by, for example, R.A.Nicholson in his notes on the verse (in the A & C Black edition of 1909): “Among some nomadic tribes the signal for striking camp was given by casting a stone into a bowl.” Where the “striking camp” and “tribes of nomad Arabs” have come from is a mystery, and neither Heron-Allen nor Nicholson gives a source to enlighten us. I personally have never seen any actual reference to this practice in any book of traveller’s tales, and it seems extremely unlikely (though see below) that casting a stone into a bowl would make enough noise to rouse a whole camp! Far more effective, surely, would be gunshots, drums or gongs, or even something akin to the call to prayer. However, as FitzGerald indicates in the above cited letter to Cowell, Francis Johnson’s A Dictionary – Persian, Arabic and English, under muhra (stone), certainly does give (in the 1852 edition, p.1280) the following entry: “muhra dar jām afgandan, To throw the pebble into the cup (a signal for mounting on horseback.).” This is clearly the source of FitzGerald’s note on the opening verse of his first edition, so there is some substance behind this, but unfortunately Johnson’s own source is not stated, and that source remains stubbornly unclear despite considerable co-operative efforts to find it, these efforts involving Sandra Mason, Bill Martin, Garry Garrard and myself. The most promising lead so far has come from the translation of The Shahnama of Firdausi by Arthur George Warner & Edmond Warner, published in 9 volumes between 1905 and 1925. The Warners tell us that the signal for an army to march forth was given by the Shah dropping a ball into a cup attached to the side of his elephant, both cup and ball being made of bell-metal (vol.1, p.79.) Thus, for example, prior to Zal leading his army against Afrasiyab, we read (vol.1, p.381):\n\n\"....When he mounted\n\nHis elephant and dropped a ball the sound\n\nMade by the cup was heard for miles around.\"\n\nPoetic licence ? Possibly. Bell-like resonance ? Possibly. But, of course, neither FitzGerald, nor Heron-Allen, nor Nicholson, said anything about marching armies, so the whole business remains something of a mystery!\n\nFor those interested, more details can be found at Bill and Sandra’s site, at:\n\nhttp://omarkhayyamrubaiyat.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/more-on-the-puzzle-about-quatrain-one-what-does-the-stone-signify/\n\nVerse 2.\n\nDreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky\n\nI heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,\n\n\"Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup\n\nBefore Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.\"\n\nDawn’s Left Hand (which became “the phantom of False morning” in the second and subsequent editions) was referenced as follows by FitzGerald in his Notes to the First Edition:\n\n“The ‘False Dawn’: Subhi Khasib, a transient Light on the Horizon about an hour before the Subhi Sadhik, or True Dawn; a well-known Phenomenon in the East. The Persians call the Morning Grey, or Dusk, ‘Wolf-and-Sheep-While.’ ‘Almost at odds with, which is which.’”\n\nThe rather puzzling ‘Wolf-and-Sheep-While’ sentence, which FitzGerald dropped from the note in subsequent editions, was probably taken from Robert B.M.Binning, A Journal of Two Years’ Travel in Persia, Ceylon etc (1857):\n\n“Most travellers in this country have noticed the frequent phenomenon of the false dawn; but this is of too common occurrence in India, to attract the notice of anyone coming from that country.\n\nThe gray of morning just preceding daybreak, is called by the Persians hava e goorg u meesh (time of the wolf and sheep) as at that time a man is supposed to be able to see these animals on the road before him, but would be unable to distinguish the one from the other. The phrase is very similar to the French ‘entre chien et loup.’” (vol.1, p.176.)\n\nThe False Dawn is certainly a reference to the zodiacal light, as was very ably demonstrated by J.W.Redhouse back in the nineteenth century (see The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol.10, p.344-354 (1878) and vol.12, p.327-334 (1880), particularly the latter, p.333, letter from W.J.L.Wharton.) It is now known to result from the reflection of sunlight from interplanetary debris in the plane of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic), and so is more especially visible (in the northern hemisphere) after sunset in spring and before dawn in autumn, at lower latitudes, where and when the plane of the ecliptic is more steeply inclined to the horizon. Being relatively faint, it is also more easily seen in places where the air is clear and free from the light pollution of modern cities. Hence in Omar Khayyam’s time and place, it would have been a much more visible phenomenon than it is for most of us today. As indicated above, in the northern hemisphere, it is visible both before sunrise (especially in September/October) and after sunset (especially in March/April), but only its morning appearance has ever been of any significance to Islam, as it can give a false message to the faithful about the onset of the true dawn, when the morning prayers begin, and especially during Ramadan, when both prayer and fasting begin. The phenomenon is referred to, somewhat obscurely, in Surah 2.187 of the Qur’an: “Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from its black thread, then complete your fast till the night appears.” (translation Abdullah Yusuf Ali) For a scientific account of the phenomenon, see M. Minnaert, The Nature of Light and Colour in the Open Air (1954), p.290-295.\n\nIn this verse is the first of many references to the Tavern and drinking wine, the recurring theme of the poem being “eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die, and there is NOTHING after death.” The last two lines use Cup in a dual sense – “fill the Cup” in the third line means “pour a cup of wine to drink”, whilst the Cup in the last line is the first of many symbolic references to human beings, Cups being made from Clay as Adam was made from Clay by God (compare verse 35, for example.) The life disappearing from the body of a human being at death is likened to the wine drying out in a cup.\n\nIt is of interest to compare this verse of FitzGerald’s with verse 200 of E.H. Whinfield’s translation of 1883:\n\nWhen false dawn streaks the east with cold, grey line,\n\nPour in your cups the pure blood of the vine;\n\nThe truth, they say, tastes bitter in the mouth,\n\nThis is a token that the \"Truth\" is wine.\n\nThis, of course, is a good example of a Sufic verse, where the wine is unequivocally symbolic.\n\nAs regards drinking wine in the morning, the Persian poet Hafiz, in one of his odes, refers to the “enlivening draught of morning wine” (translation by John Nott), to which Nott appends this footnote:\n\n“A cheerful cup of wine in the morning was a favourite indulgence with the more luxurious Persians. And it was not uncommon among the Easterns to salute a friend by saying, ‘May your morning compotation prove agreeable to you.’”\n\nSee Samuel Rousseau, The Flowers of Persian Literature (1805 ed), p.164-5. Rousseau (whose book, as mentioned earlier, was published as “A Companion to Sir William Jones’s Persian Grammar”) also quotes the following translation (by Jones himself) of another ode of Hafiz (p.158):\n\nThe dawn advances veiled with roses.\n\nBring the morning draught, my friends, the morning draught!\n\nWhilst the morning draught might seem quite civilised to many of us, the injunction, made later in the same ode, to “drink…incessantly the pure wine” seems considerably more worrying! But then Hafiz did live in the days before a glass of wine counted as two units of a suggested weekly intake, and, in any case, his injunction may be a Sufic one, a striving for increasingly Divine Intoxication! (For the morning draught in Hafiz, see also the extracts from Odes IV and V of Cowell’s translations in Appendix 1h.)\n\nVerse 3.\n\nAnd, as the Cock crew, those who stood before\n\nThe Tavern shouted – \"Open then the Door.\n\nYou know how little while we have to stay,\n\nAnd, once departed, may return no more.\"\n\nThis verse continues the Dawn theme of verses 1 and 2 with a Cock crowing. Lines 3 and 4 say, in effect, life is all too short, and when we die, that is it – there is no coming back. (Cf. “Drink! – for once dead you never shall return” in verse 34.)\n\nThe injunction to drink while you live, for once dead there is no going back either to the Tavern or to the World of the Living, finds an echo in an epigram from The Greek Anthology (a fascinating collection of short poems, mostly epigrams, ranging in date from Classsical to Byzantine times). The translation used here, and in later quotations from it, is by W.R.Paton (Loeb, 1919):\n\n“This is the monument of grey-haired Maronis, on whose tomb you see a wine cup carved in stone. She the wine-bibber and chatterer, is not sorry for her children or her children’s destitute father, but one thing she laments even in her grave, that the device of the wine-god on the tomb is not full of wine.” (7.353)\n\nI regret that I do not know more of the story of Maronis, for she has at least two such epitaphs! A second one is quoted in the notes on verse 23 below. (The explanation of the two epitaphs of Maronis is probably that some of the so-called epitaphs in the Greek Anthology are not real ones but imaginary ones, written in jest or to make a philosophical – often Omarian – point about Life and Death..)\n\nVerse 4.\n\nNow the New Year reviving old Desires,\n\nThe thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,\n\nWhere the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough\n\nPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.\n\nThis is a puzzling verse at first. The “New Year reviving old Desires” is, as FitzGerald indicates in his notes, a symbolic reference to the renewal of Nature associated with the Spring Equinox, here associated with human thoughts and feelings – as Tennyson put it in Locksley Hall, “in spring a young man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.” The spring revival is here illustrated with the twinned references to blossoms bursting forth on the trees (“the White Hand of Moses on the Bough puts out”) and flowers bursting forth from the ground (“Jesus from the Ground suspires”), this twinning being nicely illustrated in FitzGerald’s quote from Robert B.M.Binning, A Journal of Two Years’ Travel in Persia, Ceylon etc (1857):\n\n“The sudden approach and rapid advance of the spring, are very striking. Before the snow is well off the ground, the trees burst into blossom, and flowers start forth from the soil.” (vol.2, p.165.)\n\nA similar image is to be found in Sir James Baillie Fraser’s Narrative of a Journey into Khorasan in the Years 1821 and 1822 etc (1825), which FitzGerald may well have read (42):\n\n“Spring here claimed and enjoyed her full sway; the wood in many places lofty and magnificent, consisted of oak, beech, elm, alder; with thickets of wild cherry, and thorns, which were covered with a sheet of white and maiden blush blossoms…….flowers of various kinds, primroses, violets, lilies, hyacinths, and others no less lovely though unknown, covered the ground in the richest profusion, and mingled with the soft undergrowth of green herbage.” (p.599)\n\nBut of course there is no direct reference in these accounts to either Moses or Jesus, who are both, incidentally, present in the original Persian verse: “The hands of Moses appear like froth upon the bough, / And the breath of Jesus comes forth from the earth.” (Heron-Allen, as note 11a, p.13.)\n\nOne suggestion is that the White Hand of Moses and Jesus are both blossoming plants of spring named after the two prophets (in Islam, Jesus is regarded as just another prophet, like Moses). The name of the first, a white tree-blossom (“on the Bough”), relates to two verses in the Qur’an (Surahs 7.108 and 26.33), and to a similar verse in the Bible (Exodus 4.6), in which the hand of Moses is miraculously turned as white as snow (or leprous) by God. (In Persian poetry, hand and leaf are poetically interchangeable.) As for “Jesus from the ground suspires”, this means that the plant bursts forth in life from the ground – the word “suspires” = “breathes forth” is used because the life-giving power of the prophet Jesus was believed to reside in his breath.\n\nHowever, a rather more likely suggestion is that though the White Hand of Moses may be the name of a particular tree-blossom (though I have to say that I have been unable to discover which), Jesus is not the name of any particular flower. Rather the reference is to spring flowers generally bursting forth from the ground, as if enlivened by the life-giving breath of Jesus.\n\nThis reference to the Breath of Jesus probably stems from Surah 5.110 of the Qur’an, in which Jesus makes a model bird out of clay, and, by breathing upon it, brings it to life. The Qur’an in its turn probably borrowed this story from a source like the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas (Greek Text A, II.3-4; Greek Text B, III.1. A standard translation can be found in M.R.James, The Apocryphal New Testament (1924).) By way of explanation of this, since living beings breathe, it is natural to connect life-force with the breath, and in New Testament Greek the word pneuma can refer both to the spirit that animates the body and to the breath from the nostrils or mouth. Associated with this is the episode described in John 20.21-22 in which Christ appears to his Disciples after the crucifixion:\n\n“Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.”\n\nHere pneuma is used in relation to the Holy Ghost (or Spirit). Compare also Genesis 2.7:\n\n“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”\n\nVerse 5.\n\nIrám indeed is gone with all its Rose,\n\nAnd Jamshýd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;\n\nBut still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields,\n\nAnd still a Garden by the Water blows.\n\n“Iram with lofty pillars” (as it is dubbed in Surah 89.7 of the Qur’an) was a fabulously wealthy garden city, adorned with trees and fruits and flowers, said to have been destroyed by God for its wickedness, and long ago lost in the desert sands of southern Arabia. It is equated with the lost city of Ubar and the ancient Omanum Emporium of Ptolemy, its legendary wealth being a result of the frankincense trade. It was dubbed “the Atlantis of the Sands” by Bertram Thomas, an explorer who had ventured across the so-called “Empty Quarter” of Arabia, and who wrote a book about his adventures, Arabia Felix, published in 1932. Thomas wrote:\n\n“Suddenly the Arabs, who were always childishly anxious to draw attention to anything they thought would interest me, pointed to the ground. ‘Look, Sahib,’ they cried. ‘There is the road to Ubar.’\n\n‘Ubar?’ I wondered.\n\n‘It was a great city, our fathers have told us, that existed of old; a city rich in treasure, with date gardens and a fort of red silver. [Gold?] It now lies buried beneath the sands in the Ramlat Shu’ait, some few days to the north.’\n\nOther Arabs on my previous journeys had told me of Ubar, the Atlantis of the sands, but none could say where it lay.” (p.160-1)\n\nIram/Ubar was finally located with the help of satellite images, and an expedition to investigate the site (at modern Shisur), using geophysical scanners and such like, took place in the early1990s. It turned out that the city (actually, more of a town in size) was destroyed when it collapsed into a sink hole. See Nicholas Clapp, The Road to Ubar: Finding the Atlantis of the Sands (1998) – the figure on p.201 (reproduced in Gallery 7F, Fig.8) gives a vivid impression of its extraordinary demise sometime between about 300 and 500 AD. Ironically, Bertram Thomas had actually been there, without realising that it was Ubar (Arabia Felix, p.135-137.)\n\nAs for Jamshyd, according to various sources, most notably the great epic poem of Persia, The Shahnama, written by the poet Firdausi around 1000 AD, Jamshyd was a (legendary) Persian King, said to have reigned over a Golden Age lasting 700 years, during which pain, suffering and even death were unknown. During his reign Jamshyd is said to have raised humanity from a state of abject barbarism to a state of true civilisation, giving them the security of houses, the luxury of silk, and the delights of jewellery and wine. He is also credited as the first person to create a structured society, by dividing his people into four classes – priests, warriors, artificers and husbandmen. He is further said to have founded the great city of Persepolis, now in ruins (Persepolis was the Greek-derived name of the city, meaning “The City of the Persians”; in Persian its name was Takht-e Jamshyd, meaning “The Throne of Jamshyd”, in accordance with the legend.) But pride comes before a fall, as they say: Jamshyd set himself up as a god, his nobles deserted him and, with the help of King Zohak, they deposed him and “sawed him in twain”.\n\nJamshyd’s discovery of wine, briefly mentioned above, is referred to in an engaging footnote in Sir John Malcolm’s The History of Persia, from the Earliest Period to the Present Time (1815):\n\n“Jemsheed was the first who discovered wine. He was immoderately fond of grapes, and desired to preserve some, which were placed in a large vessel and lodged in a vault for future use. When the vessel was opened, the grapes had fermented; their juice, in this state, was so acid, that the king believed it must be poisonous; he had some vessels filled with it, and poison written upon each; these were placed in his room. It happened that one of his favourite ladies was affected with nervous headaches; the pain distracted her so much, that she desired death; observing a vessel with poison written on it, she took it and swallowed its contents. The wine, for such it had become, overpowered the lady, who fell down into a sound sleep and awoke much refreshed. Delighted with the remedy, she repeated the doses so often, that the monarch’s poison was all drunk. He soon discovered this, and forced the lady to confess what she had done. A quantity of wine was made; and Jemsheed, and all his court, drank of the new beverage, which, from the circumstances that led to its discovery, is to this day known in Persia by the name of zeher-e-khoosh, or the delightful poison. – Moullah Ackber’s MSS.” (vol.1, p.16)\n\nJamshyd is said to have owned a fabulous Cup whose precise nature is every bit as mysterious as the Christian Holy Grail. It is sometimes said that it was used for the magical purposes of drinking the Elixir of Life, but more usually it is associated with Divination Its interior is said to have been decorated with seven rings, corresponding to the 7 regions of the world, the 7 seas and the 7 heavens (or the 7 planets – see the notes on verse 31 below.) This would give anyone using the Cup for scrying purposes the power to see what was happening in any corner of the 7 regions of the world.\n\nThe idea of glimpsing the future, or spying on distant events, by peering into a cup or bowl of water (or other liquid), which is clearly related to gazing into a crystal ball or magic mirror, is both widespread and ancient. It is said, too, that the technique originated in Persia. Thus, St Augustine, in his City of God (7.35), says of Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome after Romulus, that he resorted to such practices, “making his gods (or rather his devils) to appear in water and instruct him ….which kind of divination, says Varro, came from Persia.” (Translation John Healey, Everyman’s Library, 1945.) Strabo, in his Geography (16.2.39), in a list of types of divination in use amongst various peoples, says of the Persians that there are “the dish-diviners and water-diviners, as they are called.” (Translation H.L.Jones, Loeb, 1930.) Thomas Taylor, in a footnote to his translation of Iamblichus – on the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans and Assyrians (3.14) in which Iamblichus talks of divining in water, says:\n\n“This divination according to the imagination through water may be illustrated by the following extract from Damascius (apud Photium): ‘There was a sacred woman who possessed in a wonderful manner a divinely gifted nature. For pouring pure water into a certain glass cup, she saw in the water that was within the cup the luminous appearances of future events, and from the view of these she entirely predicted what would happen.” (2nd edition, 1895, p.150-1)\n\nThere is a biblical example of such a divining cup – albeit an infuriatingly fleeting reference to one – in Joseph’s silver cup (Gen.44.2) “whereby indeed he divineth” (Gen.44.5 & 15). S.R.Driver, in The Book of Genesis (1909) says, in his note on this:\n\n“The allusion is to the method of divination called hydromancy: water was poured into a glass or other vessel, pieces of gold, silver, or precious stones were then thrown in; and from the movements of the water, or the figures which appeared in it afterwards, the unknown was divined.” (p.358)\n\nIn his footnote to this, Driver adds:\n\n“Norden (quoted by Knobel), whose Travels were published in 1752-5, relates that when he and his party sent their firman to a local dignitary in Egypt, they were met with the reply, ‘The firman of the Porte is nothing to me. I have consulted my cup, and I find you are Franks in disguise, who have come to spy out the land.’ And Lane (Modern Egyptians, vol.1, p.337ff.) mentions a ‘magic mirror’ of ink: in order to discover the author of a theft, ink was poured by a magician into a boy’s palm; he was directed to look into it steadfastly, and at last declared that he saw in it the image of a person, who proved to be the thief. See also Wade, Old Testament History, p.81.” (p.358)\n\nJoseph’s divining cup makes only a fleeting appearance in the Old Testament, and it is equally fleeting in Louis Ginzberg’s meticulous compilation Legends of the Jews (1925). Here Joseph pretends not to recognise his brothers (as in Gen.42.7), but, unlike in Genesis, says to them that “by this magic cup I know that ye are spies.” (vol.2, p.83). Somewhat curiously, later in the story, Joseph has “a magic astrolabe…whereby he knew all things that happen” (vol.2, p.98), but the cup hidden in Benjamin’s sack (as in Gen.44.2 & 12) is now mentioned as if it is only an ordinary silver one (ib.p.99-100). (Interestingly, the cup seems only to be an ordinary one in the Qur’an, Surah 12.70 & 72.) However, Robert Graves and Raphael Patai’s account, in their Hebrew Myths; the Book of Genesis (1964) is more consistent: Joseph uses his divining cup to denounce his brothers (p.265) and it is this same cup which is hidden in Benjamin’s sack (p.269).\n\nThe article on Jewish Divination in Hastings’ Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (vol.4, p.807) says of Gen.44.5 & 15 that:\n\n“To judge from later parallels, the practice must have consisted in filling a cup with water or wine, and gazing intently on the surface till the beholder saw all kinds of images.”\n\nTo this is added the following survival of this technique:\n\n“To find out whether a man will survive the year: take silent water from a well on the eve of Hosha’anah Rabba, fill a clear glass vessel with it, put it in the middle of the room, then look into it; if he sees therein a face with the mouth open, he will live, but, if the mouth is closed, he will die. This must be done in the hour of the domination of the moon. Some do it on the Day of Atonement, with a vessel filled with lighting oil instead of water. (Mifaloth, 119.)” (ib.p.807)\n\nThe article on Christian Divination in the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (vol.4, p.789), in talking of divining the future by gazing into water, and referencing St Augustine as mentioned above, says this:\n\n“This practice still survives in the water of silence and other ceremonies associated with Christmas Eve, Halloween, St Mark’s Eve, and Midsummer Eve. A love-couplet quoted by Abbott from Salonica illustrates the practice: ‘A lump of gold shall I drop into the well, that the water may grow clear, and I may see my husband that is to be.’ (Macedonian Folklore, p.51-57.)”\n\nGetting back to Jamshid’s Cup, in the Shahnameh, in the story of Byzun and Manijeh, Kai Khosru uses Jamshid’s Cup to divine that the missing Byzun is still alive, and though bound in fetters, he will soon be successfully released.\n\nOf FitzGerald’s verse 5, Heron Allen (as note 11a, p.13) says that it is “a very composite quatrain, which cannot be claimed as a translation of all, or the main part” of any particular quatrains in the Calcutta or Ouseley manuscripts, and he gives no specific antecedents for it. Indeed, he says, “I have never found any reference to the Garden of Iram in quatrains attributed to Omar Khayyam.” Nor does he give any manuscript source for FitzGerald’s reference to “Jamshyd’s Sev’n-ring’d Cup” However, verse 355 of E.H.Whinfield’s 1883 edition reads thus:\n\nTo find great Jamshid’s world-reflecting bowl\n\nI compassed sea and land, and viewed the whole;\n\nBut, when I asked the wary sage, I learned\n\nThat bowl was my own body, and my soul!\n\nThe last two lines, of course, are a Sufistic version of Jamshid’s Cup, meaning, as Whinfield says, that “man is the microcosm.” Originally, though, it was undoubtedly a real divining cup\n\nThe overall theme of verse 5 is that everything man-made must perish, but that nature herself continues on regardless of time – “still the Vine her ancient Ruby (grapes/wine) yields” etc.\n\nVerse 6.\n\nAnd David's Lips are lock't; but in divine\n\nHigh piping Pélevi, with \"Wine! Wine! Wine!\n\nRed Wine!\" – the Nightingale cries to the Rose\n\nThat yellow Cheek of hers to'incarnadine.\n\nThis is a very obscure verse. David is the author of the Psalms in the Bible (see also the Qur’an, Surahs 4.163 and 17.55), but instead of singing his holy songs (Psalms), he calls for wine, perhaps because, from an Omarian point of view, singing about Wine is ultimately just as significant as singing about God. Actually, there is a little more to it than this, as we shall see shortly, but first we need to take a look at the strange connection between the Nightingale and the Rose.\n\nPersian folklore links them in variations on the following basic story: Originally, the Nightingale could not sing very well, and all Roses were white. But then one day the Nightingale noticed the Rose and fell in deeply in love with her. So inspired was he by her beauty that he actually began to sing melodiously for the first time, but not only that, in pressing his body against the flower, a thorn pierced his breast, and his blood poured out over the Rose, turning it red. Thus were created together the Song of the Nightingale and the Red Rose. Prof. R.A.Nicholson, in his notes on this verse in a 1909 edition of The Rubaiyat, says:\n\n“In Persian poetry the Nightingale (Bulbul) is constantly represented as the lover of the Rose (Gul), a charming fancy, and one that is supported by rhyme, if not by reason.”\n\nRhyme alone, of course, cannot account for this strange association, and I have been unable to trace its origins. One contributory factor, however, may well be supplied by the following observation about the nightingale in Persia, taken from Robert B.M.Binning, A Journal of Two Years’ Travel in Persia, Ceylon etc (1857):\n\n“It is migratory here, as in England, making its appearance with the roses in April, and disappearing with the rose, at the end of the summer.” (vol.2, p.311.)\n\nBinning makes two other references to this in vol.1, p.219 and vol.2, p166.\n\nA good example of the association between the nightingale and the rose in Persian poetry is the following, taken from ode 14 in Gertrude L. Bell’s translation of Poems from the Divan of Hafiz (1897):\n\nThe nightingale with drops of his heart's blood\n\nHad nourished the red rose, then came a wind,\n\nAnd catching at the boughs in envious mood,\n\nA hundred thorns about his heart entwined.\n\nIn Persian Art, too, the Rose and the Nightingale are a popular decorative theme – see the article “Gol o Bolbol” in the (online) Encyclopedia Iranica, and for some examples of art-work, see Gallery 7A, Folder 1.\n\nGetting back to FitzGerald, though, in verse 6 the link between David and the Nightingale is singing, and the reference to the Nightingale, the Rose, and “that yellow Cheek of hers to incarnadine”, derives from the foregoing folktale, FitzGerald using “to incarnadine” meaning “to make blood-red”, the link with red wine being, of course, that it is like blood in colour. But whatever, according to Heron Allen (as note 11a, p.15 n.2), in Persian literature yellow is the colour of sickness and misery (compare yellow = jaundiced in English), so that the Nightingale’s song, in turning the yellow cheek of the rose to incarnadine (the colour of healthy flesh) is effectively infusing it with health and happiness. Incidentally, in editions after the first, FitzGerald changed “yellow” to “sallow”.\n\nBut getting back to David, why are his lips “lock't; but in divine / High piping Pélevi, with \"Wine! Wine! Wine! / Red Wine!\"? The explanation of this curious phraseology appears to be that David is here not literally the Psalmist (Singer of Holy Songs), but a fore-image of the Nightingale, whose Song is not a Psalm but a bird-call: \"Wine! Wine! Wine! Red Wine!\", if repeated over and over again, would have the characteristic repetitiveness of birdsong. That, I think, is why David’s lips are “lock’t” – they are locked in repetitive bird call; why they are “high piping” – which relates more to birdsong than a sung Psalm; and why he sings in “Pehlevi”, the ancient language of Persia – which relates more easily to the Persian Nightingale than to the Jewish David, for, as FitzGerald tells us in his note on this verse, “Hafiz also speaks of the Nightingale’s Pehlevi, which did not change with the People’s.” That is, in Persian lore the Nightingale’s song preserves the original language of Pehlevi, whilst that of the People changes with time.\n\nLinking David with the Nightingale does occur elsewhere in Persian poetry, notably in FitzGerald’s own translation of Attar’s Bird Parliament (lines 192ff), where the Nightingale says: “Yea, whosoever once has quaff’d this wine / He leaves unlisten’d David’s Song for mine.” However, David does not feature in the original verse on which FitzGerald based his verse 6, as can be seen from Heron-Allen’s translation of it (as note 11a, p.15-17):\n\nIt is a pleasant day, and the weather is neither hot nor cold;\n\nThe rain has washed the dust from the faces of the roses;\n\nThe nightingale in the Pehlevi tongue to the yellow rose\n\nCries ever: “Thou must drink wine!”\n\nIn verse 6, then, FitzGerald himself has brought David into things, adding what is seemingly his own novel twist: he has David literally morphing into the Nightingale as the verse unfolds.\n\nInterestingly, the Persian folk-tale of the Nightingale and the Rose has a modern incarnation in Oscar Wilde’s short story The Nightingale and the Rose. The story is given in an edited form, with some commentary on sources etc, in Appendix 10. In its turn, Wilde’s story has inspired a number of western art-works, some examples of which are given in Gallery 7A, Folder 2.\n\nOn the Red Rose and Blood, see also the note on verse 18 below.\n\nVerse 7.\n\nCome, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring\n\nThe Winter Garment of Repentance fling:\n\nThe Bird of Time has but a little way\n\nTo fly – and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.\n\n“Come fill the Cup” – the eat, drink and be merry theme again; don’t regret the past (Winter), live for today (Spring) – for life is short. “The Bird of Time” image is very neat.\n\nSimilar sentiments are to be found in John Gay’s The Beggars Opera (1728), in the second verse of the 22nd Air:\n\nLet us drink and sport to-day,\n\nOurs is not tomorrow.\n\nLove with youth flies swift away,\n\nAge is nought but sorrow.\n\nDance and sing,\n\nTime's on the wing,\n\nLife never knows the return of spring.\n\nJohn Gay, it should be remembered, was buried in Westminster Abbey, beneath an epitaph which included his own Omarian couplet:\n\nLife is a jest, and all things show it;\n\nI thought so once and now I know it.\n\nGod had the last laugh, however. In the 1930s it was discovered that Gay’s epitaph obscured a medieval wall-painting, and so it was removed to the abbey triforium, away from public gaze, where it remains today (2011).\n\nInevitably here “tempus fugit” (time flies) comes to mind, a catch-phrase whose original form is not so catchy: “fugit inreparabile tempus” meaning “time flies beyond recall”. It comes from Virgil’s Georgics (3.284) and its context is surprisingly mundane. Virgil has decided to change his subject from animal lusts in the breeding season to putting herds of sheep and goats out to pasture. The original “tempus fugit” is simply part of a poet’s way of saying, “time to move on” or “time to change the subject.” Thus it was actually a mundanely used turn of phrase, rather than a carefully considered attempt to be clever, which became a world famous dictum fully two thousand years after its author penned it! Perhaps not surprisingly, “tempus fugit” features on the occasional tombstone (I recently came across one quite by accident in the Kensal Green Cemetery in north London) and also quite regularly on old sundials (for example, at the Parish Church of Reigate, Surrey.)\n\nIncidentally, another Latin catch-phrase regularly quoted on old sundials (at Cadder House, near Glasgow, for example) is one already used a couple of times in the course of the main essay – namely, “carpe diem,” meaning “seize the day”. This comes originally from the Odes of Horace (Book 1, Ode 11), its context being so Omarian that the relevant lines of the ode are well worth quoting here, in the neat translation by W.G.Shepherd (1983):\n\n“Be wise, decant the wine, prune back / your long-term hopes. Life ebbs as I speak: / so seize each day, and grant the next no credit.”\n\nFor the use of these Latin catch-phrases on sundials, see, for example, The Book of Sundials, originally compiled by the late Mrs Alfred Gatty, enlarged and re-edited by H.K.F.Eden and Eleanor Lloyd (1900): (#108; p.221-2) for “carpe diem” and (#1337; p.425-6) for “tempus fugit.” Also of interest is The Book of Old Sundials and their Mottoes, illustrated by Alfred Rawlings and Warrington Hogg, with an introductory essay by Launcelot Cross (1922), for in addition to “carpe diem” (p.29) and “tempus fugit” (p.73; p.92), we see that by 1922 some of FitzGerald’s verses were actually appearing as the mottoes on sundials (verse 46 on p.63 & verse 51 on p.94.) For more a more detailed account of Omarian themes in epitaphs and on sundials, see Appendix 14.\n\nLord Byron made a famous use of “carpe diem” in a letter to John Cam Hobhouse, written from Bologna, and dated August 20th, 1819:\n\n“My time has been passed viciously and agreeably – at thirty-one so few years months days hours or minutes remain that ‘carpe diem,’ is not enough – I have been obliged to crop even the seconds – for who can trust to tomorrow? tomorrow quotha? to-hour – to minute –- I can not repent me (I try very often) so much of any thing I have done – as of any thing I have left undone – alas! I have been but idle – and have the prospect of early decay – without having seized every available instant of our pleasurable year.- This is a bitter thought – and it will be difficult for me ever to recover the despondency into which this idea naturally throws me.” (Byron’s Letters and Journals, edited by Leslie A. Marchand (1976), vol.6, p.211.)\n\nBut to return to the subject of Time, Hector Berlioz, in a letter to his friend Saint-Georges, dated 27th November 1856, wrote: “Time is a great teacher, it is said; unfortunately, it is a cruel teacher that kills its pupils!” (For the original French, see Pierre Citron, Hector Berlioz – Correspondance Générale (1989), vol.5, p.2187.)\n\nVerse 8.\n\nAnd look – a thousand Blossoms with the Day\n\nWoke – and a thousand scatter'd into Clay:\n\nAnd this first Summer Month that brings the Rose\n\nShall take Jamshýd and Kaikobád away.\n\nFor every thousand flowers that grow, a thousand others die (return to dust, earth or Clay); more than this, at the same time as a single Rose blossoms in a garden, great kings may pass away – Kaikobad, like Jamshyd in verse 5, was a legendary Persian king, mentioned in the great epic poem of Persia, The Shahnama, already mentioned in connection with Jamshyd in verse 5 above. For Kaikobad in particular see verse 9 below. Compare also the association of the Rose with a buried Caesar in verse 18 below, But the Blossoms in line 1 and the Clay in line 2 have deeper connotations, for the Blossoms are symbolic of people, and the Clay symbolic of “the dust of the ground” from which God created Man (Gen.2.7), and to which, on death, Man must return: “Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust”, as it says in the Book of Common Prayer. See also notes on verse 36, verse 53 and verses 59-66 in the Kuza Nama.\n\nFor this image of flowers “scatter’d into Clay”, compare Walter Crane’s strange painting “The Mower”, in which the winged Mower – the Angel of Death – scythes down human-faced flowers in a meadow (see Gallery 3D, Fig.3.) The scythe also features in a similar sense in Millais’ painting “Spring (Apple Blossoms)” (see notes on verse 72 & Gallery 3C, Fig.7.) It also features, of course, in his “Time, the Reaper”, as mentioned in chpter 11 of the main essay. Another unusual use of the image of Time as the Reaper is to be found in a clock designed by Gustave Doré, now much more famous for his engravings than his paintings or his sculptures. The clock is being scaled by numerous cherub-like figures, who, as they reach the top, are scythed down by the winged figure of Time (illustrated in Gallery 8D, Folder 2, Fig.2.) Returning to poetry, another use of the scythe of Time is to be found in Shakespeare’s 12th Sonnet (“nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defence”) and yet another in Edward Young’s Night Thoughts, first published in the 1740s, but very popular throughout the Victorian period. This extract comes from Night 1, lines 193-8:\n\nEach Moment has its sickle, emulous\n\nOf Time's enormous scythe, whose ample sweep\n\nStrikes empires from the root; each Moment plays\n\nHis little weapon in the narrower sphere\n\nOf sweet domestic comfort, and cuts down\n\nThe fairest bloom of sublunary bliss.\n\nFor a number of Omarian parallels to be found in Young’s Night Thoughts see Appendix 12c. For Doré’s clock, see “Design for a Clock, ‘Time mowing down the Hours’, modelled by Gustave Doré” in Amelia B. Edwards’ article “Gustave Doré: Personal Recollections of the Artist and his Work” in The Art Journal (Dec 1883), p.390. It is Edwards’ illustration of the clock that is shown in Gallery 8D, Folder 2, Fig.2, as mentioned above. For the origins of Father Time and his Scythe see Appendix 14c.\n\nVerse 9.\n\nBut come with old Khayyám, and leave the Lot\n\nOf Kaikobád and Kaikhosrú forgot:\n\nLet Rustum lay about him as he will,\n\nOr Hátim Tai cry Supper – heed them not.\n\nKaikobad and Kaikhosru are Kai Kobad and Kai Khosru, legendary kings of the Persian Kayanian Dynasty or Kaianids (hence the Kai). Kaikhosru was the great grandson of Kaikobad.\n\nRustum (or Rostam) is, as FitzGerald notes from his first edition onwards, the Hercules of Persia. He was the all-action hero, who, according to the Shahnama, required the milk of ten nurses at birth and felled a rampaging elephant whilst still a child. He grew up to slay a dragon, outwit a cunningly disguised witch, single-handedly rout an army, and destroy a demon known as the White Deev, these being four of the so-called Seven Labours of Rostam (which of course naturally invite comparison with the Twelve Labours of Hercules.) A key episode in the Shahnama is the story of Rostam and Sohrab. Sohrab was the son of Rostam by the Princess Tahmina, but grew up with his father being unaware of his existence. The two were destined to meet, unrecognised by each other, in single combat at the head of two armies – Rostam at that of Persia, and Sohrab at that of Turan. Rostam slew Sohrab, but only learned that he was his son after the event – the core of the tragedy. The episode was taken up by Matthew Arnold in his poem “Sohrab and Rustum”, first published in 1853. For some Persian Miniature illustrations of the deeds of Rustum, see William Lillys’s section of Oriental Miniatures: Persian, Indian, Turkish, edited with Introductions and Notes by William Lillys, Robert Reiff and Emel Esin (1965).\n\nHatim Tai, that is, Hatim of the Tribe of Tai, is the epitome of generosity and hospitality, just as Rostam is the epitome of courage and strength. It is said that while Hatim’s mother was pregnant with him, she dreamt that she was given a choice between ten ordinary sons and one son of extraordinary generosity. She chose the latter option. It is further said that Hatim would refuse to feed at his mother’s breast unless she suckled another child on her other breast at the same time. In another story, the adult Hatim received a royal emissary whilst his flocks were in pasture, so he slaughtered his own horse to feed his guest. Hatim died an infidel, for which he should have been tormented in the fires of Hell after his death. But on account of his virtue, an exception was made for him, and, by way of compensation, he was allowed to dwell in a paradisical garden in the midst of the Flames of Hell! (This, of course, is one of the problems of religious dogmatism: there are always the truly virtuous outside that dogma!) See the articles “Hatem Tai” in the (online) Encyclopædia Iranica and “Hatim al-Tai” in the (First) Encyclopedia of Islam.\n\nVerse 9 means let you and I forget the Lot (fate) of Kings Kaikobad (verse 8) and Kaikhosru; ignore the feats of that greatest of heroes, Rustum; and ignore, too, Hatim Tai, that great chieftain famed throughout the world for his hospitality (for they are all of no real consequence.)\n\nVerse 10.\n\nWith me along some Strip of Herbage strown\n\nThat just divides the desert from the sown,\n\nWhere name of Slave and Sultán scarce is known\n\nAnd pity Sultán Máhmúd on his Throne.\n\n(Following on from verse 9) Ignore all that Earthly power, and come with me to a quiet place where no-one cares who is a Sultan and who is a Slave; indeed, let us pity Sultan Mahmud (= Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, in Afghanistan, ruled 998-1030 AD) with all the problems that his kingship brings him. (“Strown”, used to rhyme with “sown”, is an old form of the word “strewn”, meaning “scattered”; the wording is a bit artificial, but is intended to convey the idea of a piece of land, at the edge of the desert, where grass and flowers grow, but which is not cultivated, and is thus, symbolically, well away from it all – in other words, well away from the ordered court of the Sultan, and all its power struggles.) A.J. Arberry (note 1d, p.200) has suggested that the linking of Slave and Sultan in line 3 is a reference to “the celebrated passion of Mahmud for his slave-boy Ayaz, frequently cited by the Persian poets as an instance of the unpredictable vagaries of human love.” Even if only a possibility, the idea is of some interest.\n\nSadi, in his Gulistan (=Rose Garden, for which see also Appendix 1h), tells us that on one occasion Sultan Mahmud was asked why, when he had so many handsome slaves, he had such high regard for Ayaz, who was in no way remarkable for his looks. Mahmud replied, “Whatever pleases the heart appears fair to the eye.” (E.B. Eastwick, The Gulistan of Sadi, Ch.5, Story 1, 1880 ed., p.158.) Sadi repeated the story in his Bustan (= Orchard) thus:\n\n“Someone found fault with the king of Ghazni, saying: ‘Ayaz, his favourite slave, possesses no beauty. It is strange that a nightingale should love a rose that has neither colour nor perfume.”\n\nThis was told to Mahmud, who said: ‘My love, O Sir, is for his virtues, not his form and stature.’” (A.H.Edwards, The Bustan of Sadi (1911), Ch.3, p.65-66.)\n\nFor the strange love of the Nightingale for the Rose, alluded to here, see the note on verse 6 above.\n\nThe homosexual love of the Sultan Mahmud for the Slave Ayaz finds something of a parallel in the love of the Roman Emperor Hadrian for Antinous. Antinous was not a slave, and unlike Ayaz, he was gifted with classical good looks (not unlike Michelangelo’s David, in fact!), but, nevertheless, their love crossed social boundaries. Antinous is said to have drowned himself in the Nile, as a voluntary sacrifice which would ensure the success of some chosen undertaking of his beloved Emperor. Hadrian was grief-stricken at his death, and had numerous statues of him set up throughout the Empire. Hadrian seems genuinely to have believed that a newly visible star, presumably a nova, was a celestial manifestation of the soul of Antinous, a belief which brought him much ridicule. (See Dio Cassius 69.11.)\n\nOf course, there are also unpredictable vagaries of heterosexual human love, a good example of which is the (albeit fictional) love of the African King Cophetua for the young beggar-girl Penelophon. The King never took any interest in women at all until, one day, he just happened to catch sight of Penelophon through his castle window, and, in the words of the poet, Cupid had speared him with his dart. She was apparently soon as speared as he was. The two were married and lived happily ever after. Indeed, they were eventually buried together. The story, which seems to have originated as a medieval romance, was told in some detail in Richard Johnson’s Crown Garland of Goulden Roses (1612), and was well enough known for Shakespeare to make a passing reference to it in Romeo and Juliet (Act 2, Scene 1: “…Cupid, he that shot so true/when King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid.”) Johnson’s text was reprinted in Thomas Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765), and it was probably Percy’s version which was read by Tennyson and inspired his poem “The Beggar-Maid” (written in 1833, but not published until 1842). William Holman Hunt illustrated Tennyson’s poem in the famous Moxon edition of Tennyson’s poems, published in 1857. The story was also the inspiration for Edward Burne-Jones’s wonderful painting, “King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid” (1884) (Gallery 3A, Fig.2).\n\nThe unpredictable vagaries of heterosexual human love are also the subject of the 4th Ode in Horace’s Book 2, which opens thus (translation by W.G.Shepherd):\n\n“No need to blush because you love / a slave-girl, Xanthias. By way of precedent, / the snowy skin of Briseis / moved Achilles; / the beauty of Tecmessa moved her / master Ajax;”\n\nBut getting back to Sultan Mahmud, he seems to have become, in Persian poetry, a useful symbol of the transience and ultimate futility of earthly power: see, for example, the rather strange account of Mahmud’s eyes in Cowell’s article on The Rose Garden of Sadi in Appendix 1h.\n\nThe lessons to be learned from contrasting “Slave and Sultan” find another example in a verse of Omar Khayyam’s, not used by FitzGerald, but used to great effect by E.H. Whinfield (listed in note 13) as verse 473 of his translation of 1883\n\nA Shaikh beheld a Harlot, and quoth he,\n\n\"You seem a slave to drink and lechery\";\n\nAnd she made answer, \"What I seem I am,\n\nBut, Master, are you all you seem to be?\"\n\nThe equalising of Slave and Sultan in FitzGerald’s verse 10 brings to mind an epigram from The Greek Anthology. It is the epitaph of a slave named Manes. The translation is again that of W.R.Paton:\n\n“This man when alive was Manes, but now he is dead he is as great as Darius.” (7.538)\n\nDarius was, of course, the great King of the Persians.\n\nAgain, Marcus Aurelius, in his Meditations (VI.24), wrote:\n\n\"Alexander the Great and his groom, when dead, were both upon the same level, and ran the same chance of being scattered into atoms or absorbed in the soul of the universe.\" (Translation of Jeremy Collier, 1891)\n\nAnother aspect of Death as the Great Leveller is to be found in Lucian’s Dialogues of the Dead, in particular in the dialogue of “Nireus, Thersites and Menippus.” The scene is set in Hades. Menippus is basically a philosophical observer who appears in several of the dialogues, whilst Nireus and Thersites are characters from Homer’s Iliad – the former having been in life the most handsome of the Greeks to sail to Troy (Iliad 2. 672-3), the latter the ugliest (Iliad 2. 219). Both are now skeletons in Hades and they enjoin Menippus to judge which of them is the most handsome. In their skeletal state, of course, they are indistinguishable. As Menippus says to Nireus, “Neither you nor anyone else is handsome here. In Hades all are equal, and all alike.” (Translation by M.D. Macleod, Loeb 1961.)\n\nVerse 11.\n\nHere with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,\n\nA Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse – and Thou\n\nBeside me singing in the Wilderness –\n\nAnd Wilderness is Paradise enow.\n\nIn the quiet place of verse 10, with bread to eat and wine to drink, and with you reading poetry to me, such a place would be Paradise. (“Enow” is an old fashioned poetical word for “enough”.) This is one of the most famous verses in FitzGerald’s translation, and one much illustrated, and though there is a possible antecedent for it in the original verses of Omar Khayyam (or of one of his imitators!), it is amusing to reflect that one of the verses which FitzGerald actually used in his ‘translation’ featured a loaf of bread, a gourd of wine and a leg of mutton (Herron-Allen, as note 11a, p.23) – no book of verse! But then for most of us today there is little romance in a leg of mutton! Incidentally, in contrast to Professor Arberry’s assertion, mentioned above, that the poet’s companion on this picnic was “a pretty young boy”, another picnic verse (verse 32 in the Ouseley Manuscript, quoted in the notes on verse 56 below) has him accompanied by “a playmate houri-shaped” – a girl. Again, another Persian original has him accompanied specifically by “a tulip-cheeked girl.” (See the translation by Avery and Heath-Stubbs, cited in note 13, verse 234.) Certainly, most illustrators opt for a pretty young girl when it comes to illustrating this verse! (See Galleries 1C & 2C for some examples)\n\nThere is an interesting classical parallel for the sentiments of this verse in the Latin poem Copa. Formerly thought to be a minor poem of Virgil’s, it is now thought merely to be written in the style of Virgil by some unknown author, at some unknown date. It is contained in a collection of such pseudo-Virgilian poems, all probably by different authors, in a collection known as the Appendix Virgiliana. Copa – it means the Barmaid – is a song sung by the hostess of a roadside tavern to her customers. The following is extracted from the translation of H. Rushton Fairclough, revised by G.P.Goold (Loeb, 2000):\n\n“Why go away when you’re tired with the heat and the dust? How much better to recline on a couch with a drink! Here are panelled booths and cabins and goblets, roses, flutes, harps, and a pavilion cooled by a shady curtain of reeds…..And there are little cheeses, dried in rush baskets, and waxen plums of autumn’s season and chestnuts and sweetly blushing apples: here are loaves of purest bread, here Love, here wine…Come here and rest your weary limbs beneath the shade of vines, and entwine your drooping head in a coronet of roses, and kissing the luscious lips of a pretty girl….Why save fragrant wreaths for ungrateful ashes ? D’you want your bones buried under a garlanded tombstone? Set forth the wine and dice! To hell with him who thinks of tomorrow! Death is tweaking my ear and says: ’Live it up now, for I am coming!’” (p.439-441)\n\nSimilar thoughts are to be found in The Greek Anthology, the translation used here being again that of W.R.Paton:\n\n“Let us bathe, Prodike, and crown our heads, and quaff untempered wine, lifting up greater cups. Short is the season of rejoicing, and then old age comes to forbid it any longer, and at the last death” (5.12)\n\nAnd again:\n\n“This is life, and nothing else is; life is delight; away, dull care! Brief are the years of man. Today wine is ours, and the dance, and flowery wreaths, and women. Today let me live well; none knows what may be tomorrow.” (5.72)\n\nVerse 12.\n\n\"How sweet is mortal Sovranty!\" – think some:\n\nOthers – \"How blest the Paradise to come!\"\n\nAh, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest;\n\nOh, the brave Music of a distant Drum!\n\nHow enticing is earthly kingship; how enticing is the promise of heaven after we die; but better to take the good things you have now (“the Cash in hand”), than to long for things we might never have or which are unattainable (“the brave Music of a distant drum”). A recurring idea throughout The Rubaiyat is that not only is Heaven unattainable, but that life after death does not even exist.\n\nWith FitzGerald’s verse 12 we may compare Horace, Odes 1.9 thus:\n\n“Avoid speculation / about the future; count as credit the days / chance deals; youth should not spurn / the dance or sweet desire.” (Translation by W.G.Shepherd.)\n\nVerse 13.\n\nLook to the Rose that blows about us – \"Lo,\n\nLaughing,\" she says, \"into the World I blow:\n\nAt once the silken Tassel of my Purse\n\nTear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.\"\n\nThe Treasure of the Rose is its pollen, from which other Roses will grow; its Purse is the stamen of the flower. The idea here is that real Treasure has nothing to do with money, or commerce, or power. The carefree words of the laughing rose contrast nicely with the serious thoughts of mankind’s “worldly hopes” in the next verse.\n\nCompare “the too brief spell of the rose” in Horace Odes (2.3). This, like the other references to Horace cited in the notes on verse 7, verse 10 and verse 12 above, is one of a number of parallels that have been drawn between Horace and Omar Khayyam (see also the allusion to Horace in More’s article in Appendix 7.) Other examples are: “Pallid death kicks impartially at the doors of hovels and mansions” (from Odes 1.4) and “virtue can give no pause to wrinkles or imminent age or invincible death” (from Odes 2.14) – the translations here being again by W.G.Shepherd, in the Penguin Classics edition of Horace’s odes and epodes. I do not propose to go further into the parallels here, but refer interested readers to Herbert Edward Mierow’s article “Horace and Omar Khayyam” in The Classical Weekly, vol.xi, no.3 (1917), p.19-21. It was, as we have already seen, Horace who coined the Omarian catch-phrase “carpe diem”, in his Odes (1.11). Interestingly, though FitzGerald was a great fan of Lucretius, he was not a fan of Horace (II.590 & 593).\n\nVerse 14.\n\nThe Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon\n\nTurns Ashes – or it prospers; and anon,\n\nLike Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face\n\nLighting a little Hour or two – is gone.\n\nThe aims of Worldly Hope are fleeting, no matter whether that hope ends in failure (burnt to Ashes) or success (for even success is like Snow, it melts and is gone all too soon.) Everything is transient.\n\nThe insignificance of human “Worldly Hope” was famously captured by Keats in his poem “When I have fears that I may cease to be” (1818), in the closing lines:\n\n....then on the shore\n\nOf the wide world I stand alone, and think,\n\nTill Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.\n\nLongfellow was one of few poets who had a slightly more optimistic approach. In “A Psalm of Life” (1838) he wrote:\n\nLives of great men all remind us\n\nWe can make our lives sublime,\n\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\n\nFootprints on the sands of time;\n\nThere are two views of Fame. Fame in its posthumous aspect is seen by some as one of the few ways of living on in this world after physical death, the most famous example of this view being Petrarch’s poem “The Triumph of Fame over Death” (on which see Gallery 8H, Fig.15, and the notes on it.) The Roman poet Martial was not so sure of such a view. Posthumous fame is all very well, he felt, but you have to be dead to get it! (This is the sense of the last two lines of the 10th epigram in his Book 5.) In the Christian tradition, of course, “all is vanity”, so the quest for posthumous fame becomes a sin (see, for example, St. Augustine’s City of God, 5.14.) Not only that, but in the long term even posthumous fame must fade and die with time, and so in this sense Death must ultimately triumph over Fame, this being the message of FitzGerald’s verse 5 (“Iram indeed is gone with all its rose / And Jamshyd’s Sev’n-ring’d Cup, where no one knows.”) It is ironic that so many of the famous names mentioned in Petrarch’s “Triumph of Fame over Death” are quite unknown to most people today! But then “hope springs eternal in the human breast”, as Pope famously said in his Essay on Man back in 1734, and so the yearning to transcend death through posthumous fame continues!\n\nIncidentally, on literary fame and its celebration, either by burial or by effigy, in Westminster Abbey, FitzGerald had a theory that no-one should be celebrated there until at least a hundred years after their death. Only by then, he argued, will posterity have determined whether or not they are really famous enough to qualify. FitzGerald declined to subscribe to a monument to his friend William Makepeace Thackeray for this very reason (though he was sure that Thackeray would eventually qualify, as we shall see). In a letter to W.F. Pollock, written in December 1864, he wrote:\n\n“…there are already such a heap of vulgar Statues to People no one, even now, cares for that I shouldn’t care to see WMT lumped among them, next to – Sir W. Follett, for instance. What Foreigner, looking into the Noble Abbey, but must wonder at such an Intrusion; the Name not known, I suppose, out of Britain, and not exciting any very lively recognition here.” (II.537)\n\nA little later in this same letter, FitzGerald added:\n\n“I feel sure WMT will be known and admired one hundred years hence…and then the New Zealander may make a Bust, or a Statue as he pleases.”\n\nThe New Zealander here is effectively “a person in the distant the future”, an image very popular in FitzGerald’s day, but largely forgotten today. For its origins, which are rooted in notions of the transience of empires, see note 40 to the main essay.\n\nAgain, in a letter to Anna Biddell written in January 1873, FitzGerald complained about the burial in the Abbey of the author and politician Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton:\n\n“Not one word of his clever Books do I remember, or ever wish to return to: and in fifty years hence I believe Posterity will be even more ignorant of him than I. So I don’t think they should have laid him in Westminster Abbey, though he be quite as worthy as half the People there. I say one hundred years should elapse before those beautiful Walls are made the Records of men: if their ‘Works have followed them’ and are known a hundred years after, there is a strong presumption for their being known another – and perhaps another – hundred.” (III.398)\n\nFitzGerald’s comments here are very apt, as any thoughtful visitor to Westminster Abbey knows: so many of the great and good of past ages are totally unknown to most of us today: sic transit gloria mundi, yet again.\n\nBut getting back to “worldly hope”, in art, the figure of Hope was famously depicted by both Edward Burne-Jones and George Frederick Watts.\n\nBurne-Jones depicted “Hope” (1896) as a young woman, imprisoned and chained, yet looking and reaching towards heaven. She holds a sprig of apple-blossom, symbolic of hope (possibly a relative of the cornucopia traditionally held by the Roman goddess Fortuna.) Interestingly, flowers are shown growing in the spaces between the cracks in the floor of her cell. These could simply indicate that the flower – like hope – takes root where it can, but another, more negative suggestion, is that they are periwinkles, garlands of which were formerly placed on the heads of those condemned to execution, “whence, perhaps, comes the Italian name for periwinkle of fiore di morte (flower of death.)” (See W.G.Constable’s article, “’Hope’ by Edward Burne-Jones”, in The Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts, vol.39, no.231 (February 1941), p.12-14; also Malcolm Bell, Sir Edward Burne-Jones: a Record and Review (1899), p.112-113. For the painting itself, see Gallery 3A, Fig.3.)\n\nIncidentally, if some of these symbolic interpretations of flowers sound a little far fetched, we should remind ourselves that most of us today remember very little of the flower-symbolism used and readily understood by our Victorian forebears.(The red rose as a symbol of love is probably the most famous survival.) There were numerous books on the subject, one of the most famous today being a little book entitled The Language of Flowers. First published in 1884, it is still famous today mainly because it was illustrated by Kate Greenaway. Leafing through a copy, if you’ll pardon the pun, reveals that actually some of the symbolism is still preserved in flower and plant names – the forget-me-not as a symbol of true love and the weeping willow as a symbol of mourning, for example. Other symbols are preserved via classical mythology (eg the narcissus as a symbol of egotism) or via the symbolic conventions of Christian art (eg the white lily as a symbol of purity – it is regularly used in connection with the Virgin Mary.) But other symbolism well known in the past is now very obscure – the bluebell as a symbol of constancy, for example, or the peony as a symbol of shame. As for the flower known as Queen’s Rocket, presenting one of these to a young lady would apparently convey the message, “You are the Queen of Coquettes”, this presumably working by nothing more than rhyming slang! Incidentally, the Greenaway book is currently satisfying a renewal of interest in such things in paperback form.\n\nBut getting back to Hope in art, Watts’ painting depicted the figure of “Hope” (c.1885-6) as a blindfolded young woman sitting upon a globe and pressing her head against a lyre all of whose strings, save one, are broken (Gallery 3G, Fig.1.) The globe symbolises the world, of course, and the blindfold symbolises the fact that Hope, like Faith, is often blind. The lyre symbol is interesting. Watts himself indicated that it wasn’t the negative aspect of the broken strings which mattered, but the positive aspect offered by the single unbroken string. “It is only when one supreme desire is left that one reaches the topmost pitch of hope,” he said. Interestingly, the Roman goddess Fortuna, mentioned above, was also sometimes depicted in art wearing a blindfold, or in literature represented as blind; and one of her ancillary symbols was a globe or wheel – the latter being the Wheel of Fortune (as depicted in the paintings of that title by Burne-Jones, mentioned earlier: indeed, in one version Fortune is shown blindfolded – see Gallery 3A, Fig.8.) In the case of Fortuna the globe might possibly represent the world (many educated people in Roman times would certainly have regarded the world as a globe and not flat – see, for example, Pliny’s Natural History, Book 2, chapters 2 & 64) but it may possibly be just a ball of stone on which the goddess stands, rolling unpredictably, thus symbolising the unpredictable nature of fate. The wheel on the other hand is spun by the goddess to dole out fate, again unpredictably – rather like deciding fate on the basis of the spin of a roulette wheel. See also the notes on verse 49 below, particularly the quotation from Pacuvius. Incidentally, the globe appears to be an earlier symbol which came later to be replaced by the wheel.\n\nHope and Fortune are paired together in an anonymous epigram in The Greek Anthology. The translation is again by W.R.Paton:\n\n“Hope and Fortune, a long farewell to you both! I have found the way. I no longer take delight in aught of yours. Away with both of you! for ye lead men far astray. Ye present to our minds, as in visions of sleep, things that never shall really be, as if they were. Away with thee, poor puppet, mother of many woes; away with you both! Make sport, if you will, of whomever ye find after me, whose mind dwells on things he should not think of. Of a truth Fortune is a delusion for all mortals; for she is without force, and mostly even without being. – Who wrote this, God knows. Why? Himself only knows.” (9.134, 135)\n\nThis type of epigram must have enjoyed some popularity – both Hope and Fortune are similarly bade farewell in 9.49 and 9.172.\n\nFor Watts’ painting see The Vision of G.F.Watts, edited by Veronica Franklin Gould (2004), p.77-8 and also her book G.F.Watts: the Last Great Victorian (2004), p.193ff. For an imaginative look at Watts’ “Hope”, see H.W.Shrewsbury, The Visions of an Artist – Studies in G.F.Watts R.A., O.M. – with Verse Interpretations (1921), p.63-70. For the Roman goddess Fortuna, see, for example, the articles on “Fortuna” in the standard Smith’s and Lemprière’s Classical Dictionaries; also useful is H.V.Canter’s article “Fortuna in Latin Poetry”, in Studies in Philology, vol.19, no.1 (January 1922), p.64-82.\n\nThe image of “Snow upon the Desert’s dusty Face” in FitzGerald’s verse 14 is, incidentally, to be found in the original Persian (where the snow is depicted as “resting for two or three days” – see Heron-Allen, as note 11a, p.30-31.) See also the paragraph from Robert B.M.Binning, A Journal of Two Years’ Travel in Persia, Ceylon etc (1857), vol.2, p.165, quoted in the notes on verse 4 above.\n\nVerse 15.\n\nAnd those who husbanded the Golden Grain,\n\nAnd those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,\n\nAlike to no such aureate Earth are turn'd\n\nAs, buried once, Men want dug up again.\n\nThose who are cautious with wealth (= who store the Golden Grain) and those who are reckless with it (= who scatter their Golden Grain to the winds) all share the same fate – they alike become rotting corpses which, once buried, no-one wants dug up again. (Aureate Earth = gold-infused earth, linking up with the Golden Grain.)\n\nThe last two lines of verse 15 amuse me because they are about the only part of The Rubaiyat that I would actively disagree with, and for this reason: relics – and most particularly those of Christian Saints. Objects of devotion, often revered for their healing powers, the bones of the saintly dead have long been dug up and put on display to the faithful, who, far from shunning them, have sought to get as close to them as possible!\n\nQuite where and when it all started is difficult to pinpoint with certainty – possibly as early as the 2nd century AD – but the corpses of early Christian saints and martyrs were certainly being ‘translated’ (a polite word for what effectively meant ‘looted’) from the Catacombs to the Churches of Rome from about the 7th century. One of the most famous corpses – that of St Cecilia, the patron saint of music – was removed from the Catacomb of Praetextatus in AD 821, and deposited in a church purpose-built for her. Again, sometime in the late 9th to 10th centuries, in northern Spain, the bones of St James the Greater were allegedly dug up at Compostela, the great Cathedral of Santiago (= St Iago = St James) becoming the focus of the third greatest Christian pilgrimage after Jerusalem and Rome, and, of course, the source of vast amounts of pilgrim revenues. Likewise, in Cologne in 1106 AD the alleged bones of the martyred St Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins were dug up and eventually put on proud display in the purpose-built Church of St Ursula. Again, in England, following the murder of St Thomas Becket in 1170, his corpse became the focus of a cult at Canterbury Cathedral. Nor are such devotions an outmoded or medieval fad – the corpse of St Bernadette Soubirous, famous for her visions of the Virgin Mary at Lourdes in 1858 – today still lies on display in the Convent of St Gildard at Nevers.\n\nBut returning to Khayyam’s “aureate earth”, the trade in Christian relics became very big business. As early as the 9th century a character by the name of Deusdona was raiding the catacombs of Rome ‘to order’, and even acting as middle-man between Pope Eugene II and the church of Soissons in France for the sale of the body of St Sebastian! Again, in the 11th/12th century the monks of Mount Sinai sent a finger of their corpse of St Catherine of Alexandria to Rouen Cathedral in return for “regular donations” from the city to monastery funds. And if you couldn’t buy it, well, you could always steal it, the most famous of such thefts being that of the body of St Mark, stolen from Alexandria in AD 828 by Venetian merchants to be deposited in the great Basilica of St Mark in Venice. Much earlier than any of these, in the 4th century AD, St Gregory of Nyssa somewhat gruesomely declared that “the mould and dust from the martyred body of St Theodore was carried away as if it were gold” – aureate earth, indeed! (Most of the foregoing is taken from James Bentley, Restless Bones (1985), the quote about St Theodore being on p.27. For St Bernadette Soubirous, see Father André Ravier, The Body of St Bernadette (1986).)\n\nBut if one thinks about it, this preoccupation with bodily relics is not confined to Christian saints. There are secular relics too – the body of Lenin, displayed in his mausoleum in Moscow, is probably the most famous example; the head of Oliver Cromwell is another; and poor old Tutankhamun has had more than his fair share of attention!\n\nActually, it is Oliver Cromwell who links us up with FitzGerald, if not with Khayyam, via FitzGerald’s researches, undertaken on behalf of Thomas Carlyle, into the true site of the Battle of Naseby – this in connection with Carlyle’s great book on Oliver Cromwell.\n\nBasically, FitzGerald (whose family owned the estate on which the battle had taken place) doubted that Carlyle had quite the correct location for it (I.339 & 349), favouring, instead, the location suggested by local tradition (I.342-3). In a letter written to Bernard Barton in September 1842, FitzGerald described how he had had a trench dug, and found “bones nearly all rotted away, except the teeth, which are quite good.” At the bottom of the trench, he went on, lay “the form of a perfect skeleton: most of the bones gone, but the pressure distinct in the clay: the thigh and leg bones yet extant: the skull a little pushed forward.” He went on: “I don’t care for all this bone-rummaging myself: but the identification of the graves identifies also where the greatest heat of the battle was. Do you wish for a tooth?” (I.351) Subsequently one local resident proposed using the grave-soil containing the crumbling remains “as a manure for turnips” (I.355), to which Carlyle responded, in a letter asking FitzGerald to send him “a tooth and a bullet”: “Honour to thrift. If of 5000 wasted men, you can make a few usable turnips, why, do it!” (I.356)\n\nThe finding of the remains, though, also struck both FitzGerald and Carlyle in more traditionally poignant ways. In the above mentioned letter to Bernard Barton, FitzGerald wrote of the newly uncovered remains:\n\n“…let the full harvest moon wonder at them as they lie turned up after lying hid 2400 revolutions of hers. Think of that warm 14th June when the Battle was fought, and they fell pell-mell…”\n\nThen he added the detail that reminds us why the dead are indeed “no such aureate earth”:\n\n“…and then the country people came and buried them so shallow that the stench was terrible, and the putrid matter oozed over the ground for several yards: so that the cattle were observed to eat those places very close for some years after.”(I.351)\n\nIn the above mentioned letter to FitzGerald, Carlyle wrote:\n\n“The opening of that burial-heap blazes strangely in my thoughts: these are the very jawbones that were clenched together in deadly rage, on this very ground, 197 years ago! It brings the matter home to one with a strange veracity, – as if for the first time one saw it to be no fable and a theory, but a dire fact.” (I.356)\n\nVerse 16.\n\nThink, in this batter'd Caravanserai\n\nWhose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,\n\nHow Sultán after Sultán with his Pomp\n\nAbode his Hour or two, and went his way.\n\nHere, the world is likened to a Caravanserai, a desert accomodation built for the use of travellers, whose entrances and exits are days and nights, and whose guests (Sultans, Kings and Emperors) come and go (are born and die). The theme is the transience of earthly power, and recalls that well-known verse from Gray’s Elegy written in a Country Churchyard (for more on which see Appendix 24):\n\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\n\nAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave\n\nAwaits alike th’inevitable hour:-\n\nThe paths of glory lead but to the grave.\n\nLess well known are these lines from Longfellow’s poem “Haroun al Raschid”:\n\nWhere are the kings, and where the rest\n\nOf those who once the world possessed?\n\nThey’re gone with all their pomp and show,\n\nThey’re gone the way that thou shalt go.\n\nProf. R.A.Nicholson gives an interesting aside on verse 16, in his notes on a version of FitzGerald’s first edition, first published in 1909:\n\n“Attar relates in the Memoirs of the Saints that one day Ibrahim ibn Adham, Prince of Balkh, was seated on his throne, giving audience to his subjects and surrounded by courtiers and pages in due ceremony. Suddenly a man entered, whose appearance struck the attendants with such awe that their tongues sank into their throats, and not one of them dared to ask his name. He advanced and stood in front of the throne. ‘What do you want?’ said Ibrahim. He replied, ‘I have come to lodge in this caravanserai.’ ‘This is not a caravanserai,’ said Ibrahim, ‘but my palace; you must be mad.’ ‘Who was the owner of this palace before you?’ asked the stranger. ‘My father.’ ‘And before that?’ ‘My father’s father.’ ‘And before that?’ ‘Such and such a one.’ ‘And before that?’ ‘The father of such and such a one.’ ‘Where are they all gone?’ ‘They are dead.’ ‘Then,’ cried the unknown, ‘is this not a caravanserai, where one comes and another goes?’ With these words he departed and was seen no more.”\n\nThe episode is to be found in A.J.Arberry’s Muslim Saints and Mystics: Episodes from the Tadhkirat al-Auliya (Memorial of the Saints) by Farid al-Din Attar (1966), p.63-4. Ibrahim (or Ebrahim) was a Prince who, after the fashion of Buddha, renounced his kingdom and took to asceticism. The above episode is preceded by the following, here taken from Arberry:\n\n“Ebrahim ibn Adham’s saintly career began in the following manner….One night he was asleep on his royal couch. At midnight the roof of the apartment vibrated, as if someone was walking on the roof. ‘Who is there?’ he shouted. ‘A friend,’ came the reply. ’I have lost a camel, and am searching for it on this roof.’ ‘Fool, do you look for the camel on the roof?’ cried Ebrahim. ‘Heedless one,’ answered the voice, ‘do you seek for God in silken clothes, asleep on a golden couch?’” (p.63)\n\nReturning the earlier episode of the caravanserai, though, the mysterious stranger who departed (or in Arberry’s translation, vanished) was Khezr/Khidr/Khadir, whom tradition reckons to be the unnamed one consulted by Moses, on his travels, in the Qur’an (Surah 18.65ff). His character is a fine example of the vagaries and complexities of myth and folklore, for the associations of his name with the colour green associate him with Spring and the Fountain of Life on the one hand, and yet, on the other hand, he is associated with both Elias of the Old Testament (of whom he is said to be a reincarnation) and with our St. George (but without the Dragon) on the other! See, with particular reference to Turkey, F.W.Hasluck, Christianity and Islam under the Sultans (1929), vol.1, p.319-336. Also, Saint George for England: the Life, Legends and Lore of our Glorious Patron by “H.O.F.” (c.1935) pp.13 (Northern Syria), 23-4 (Saracen), & 53 (Persia). The links between Khidr and St George are, however, tenuous. A.J.Wensinck’s article “Al Khadir” in The (First) Encyclopedia of Islam refers only once to St George, where he talks of “a confusion with St George, with whom al-Khadir has certain points of resemblance” (p.864, col.1)\n\nThe caravanserai as a symbol is also used by Hafiz in one of his Odes, the following translation being from Prof. Cowell’s Ode VII (Appendix 1h):\n\n“Since from this caravanserai, with its two gates, departure is inevitable, What matter whether the arch of life’s lodging be high or low?”\n\nIn his footnote to the “two gates” Cowell writes:\n\n“The world is here represented as a caravanserai, with its two gates of birth and death. The caravanserai is an open area, surrounded by a wall, in which are built numerous arched recesses, where the travellers lodge for the night.”\n\nWilliam Kinglake, in his Eothen (1844) goes into a little more detail:\n\n“A caravanserai is not ill adapted to the purposes for which it is meant. It forms the four sides of a large quadrangular court. The ground floor is used for warehouses, the first floor for guests, and the open court for the temporary reception of the camels, as well as for the loading and unloading of their burthens, and the transaction of mercantile business generally. The apartments used for the guests are small cells opening into a corridor, which runs round the four sides of the court.” (Chapter 17)\n\nEdmund J. Sullivan did an interesting illustration of this verse – see Gallery 2A, Folder 1, Fig.3 and the notes on it.\n\nVerse 17.\n\nThey say the Lion and the Lizard keep\n\nThe Courts where Jamshýd gloried and drank deep:\n\nAnd Bahrám, that great Hunter – the Wild Ass\n\nStamps o'er his Head, and he lies fast asleep.\n\nThe lion and the lizard as the inhabitants of the ruins of the former palaces of kings is the type of image beloved of the Biblical prophets. Isaiah chapter 34 is a particularly fine example of doom-laden invective, directed against the Edomites, whose land shall be laid waste by the Lord:\n\n“The cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it…and thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls. The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.” (verses 11-14)\n\nAgain, as we saw in chapter 8 of the main essay, Volney pictured the ruins of the palaces of Palmyra as the dens of wild beasts, and its temples as the haunt of savage reptiles. Such images, of course, have a basis in fact. Rose Macaulay, in her marvellous book The Pleasure of Ruins (1953), quotes R.D.Traill (in his 1847 edition of Josephus) on the ruins of ancient Caesarea, “once the glory of Palestine, now the haunt of jackals and wild boars” (p.66); she tells how Alfonse de Lamartine, when visiting the ruins of Baalbek in the 1830s, stayed in the house of a Christian bishop, “the first living being he had seen in Baalbek except jackals and swallows” (p.79); and she quotes J.E. Baum’s account of the ruins of the highland stronghold of Gondar, (in former Abyssinia):“And now hyena and jackal, hyrax and lizard, hold high revel in these silent, crumbling halls” (p.432). Macaulay also records that in the 15th century nothing was left of the former glories of Athens “but a miserable village infested by foxes and wolves” (p.155). Indeed, so established was this type of image that when the strange fashion for building artificial ruins as garden décor arose throughout Europe in the 18th century (the ‘Roman Arch’ at Kew Gardens, built in 1759-60, is a famous example), its resident flora and fauna were an essential ingredient, as Macaulay explains:\n\n“For the perfect ruin, there had to be ivy, an owl (preferably screech), a raven and a few bats in the tower, a broken arch, with moss, trees thrusting through Gothic windows, a toad, an adder, and perhaps a fox. There might, too, be a hermit; but in that case the roof must not be so ruinated as to let in the rain; a ghost was less trouble.” (p.32)\n\nRose Macaulay, incidentally, was related to Thomas Babington Macaulay – the famous historian, of particular relevance to us in this essay on account of his role in the saga of the New Zealander (see note 40 of the main essay): her grandfather, Samuel Herrick Macaulay, was a cousin of the famous historian. The Pleasure of Ruins is a must for anyone interested in any aspect of the lore of ruins, though, oddly enough, she doesn’t mention the New Zealander at all!\n\nBut to get back to verse 17, for Jamshyd, see the note on verse 5 above. As for Bahram, he is not a legendary king but a real one, and one of the most popular kings of Iranian history – namely, the Sasanid king Bahram V (420-438 AD.) His name is sometimes rendered Varahran in English. His nickname Bahram Gor comes from his love of hunting the onager or wild ass (= gor). One legend has it that he actually earned his nickname by slaying a lion and an onager with a single arrow! According to one account he even died whilst out hunting, though another account does say that he died a natural death in the summer of 438 AD.\n\nAccording to another story, before Bahram became king there was a second claimant to the throne, and in order to decide who should become king, Bahram suggested that the royal crown should be placed between two lions, and whoever could retrieve it by killing the beasts should become king. The second claimant withdrew, but Bahram slew the two lions and thus gained the crown. (This episode is to be found in The Shahnameh and also in the Haft Peykar – see below.)\n\nAs FitzGerald says in the notes to his first edition onwards (see also II.318, 320n1 & 321), Bahram is also known for his Seven Castles, each of a different colour, each housing a royal mistress, each of whom tells Bahram a tale. One of the principal accounts of all this is to be found in the Haft Peykar (Seven Beauties) of Nizami. In brief, Bahram Gor acquires seven mistresses, one from each of the seven regions of the World. He is advised by a learned architect, geometer and astrologer to build a domed pavilion for each of them, and, in order to ensure good fortune, he is advised that each of the pavilions should be of the colour that is associated with the region of the World from which its occupant comes, and with its ruling planet. The story is thus riddled with sevens – seven mistresses, seven pavilions (or castles), seven colours, seven regions of the world and seven planets. Nor is that the end of the sevens, for a large part of the poem is taken up with the seven tales that are told to the appropriately dressed (colour-coded!) Bahram Gor by each of the mistresses in turn, these stories being told on the seven successive days of the week, the particular day being the one associated with the planet that governs the region from which the mistress comes. Thus, for example, the Russian mistress is installed in the Red Pavilion, this being the colour associated with Mars, which governs her region of the world; and Bahram Gor, dressed in red, is told her story on Tuesday, which is the day associated with the planet Mars! Needless to say, many a Persian ruin with the slightest hint of colour came to be associated with this extraordinary story. Thus, Sir William Ouseley, in his Travels (see note 42 of the main essay), tells of being shown the ruins of three of these pavilions by his guides: the Green one (vol.2, p.225), the Blue one (vol.3, p.204) and the Red one – this last one, somewhat suspiciously, in two different locations! (vol.2, p.422 & p.440) Robert Binning, too, in his Journal of Two Years’ Travel in Persia, Ceylon etc (1857) mentions the Yellow Palace, said by his guides to have been inhabited by Bahram Gor’s Chinese mistress …(vol.2, p.353-4).\n\nFor all of the foregoing see the articles “Bahram” and “Haft Peykar” in the online Encyclopædia Iranica. For the Haft Peykar in particular, see The Haft Paikar, translated by C.E.Wilson (1924), in two volumes, vol.2 being Commentary; and The Haft Paykar, translated by Julie Scott Meisami (1976; 1995). For three interesting Persian miniatures illustrating three of the pavilions/castles/palaces, see Werner Forman (photographs), Vera Kubrickova (text) and R. Finlayson-Samsour (translator), Persian Miniatures (1967?), nos. 33-35, these being the Red, Turquoise and White palaces respectively: the miniatures literally glow with their respective colours! The Red palace miniature is shown by way of example in Gallery 7F, Fig.9.\n\nThe meaning of verse 17 is that the former palace of Jamshyd (verse 5 and 8), now in ruins, has become the haunt of wild animals like the Lion and the Lizard; and Bahram lies buried in some unknown place where the wild animals that he once hunted now walk over his grave while he lies still in death (“fast asleep”). (In the original Persian lines used here by FitzGerald there was a play on words, for the word “gor” can mean both wild ass and grave.)\n\nTeimourian (note 1i, p.224-6) wonders if Khayyam’s imagery in verse 17 and elsewhere in The Rubaiyat was based on his visits to the ruins of Ctesiphon (about 20 miles south-east of Baghdad) and of old Babylon or Babel. In Khayyam’s day, both were already “the scurrying ground of lizards”.\n\nKhayyam’s theme here, as elsewhere, is the transience of earthly power, of course, an interesting parallel for which comes from Edward Robinson and Eli Smith, Biblical Researches in Palestine, Mount Sinai and Arabia Petraea: a Journal of Travels in the Year 1838 (3 vols, 1841.) Talking of their visit to the Pyramids of Gizeh they write:\n\n“They are probably the earliest, as well as the loftiest and most vast of all existing works of man upon the face of the earth; and there seems now little room to doubt that they were erected chiefly, if not solely, as the sepulchres of kings. Vain pride of human pomp and power! Their monuments remain unto this day, the wonder of all time; but themselves, their history and their very names, have been swept away in the dark tide of oblivion!” (vol.1, section 1, p.38.)\n\nHarriet Martineau also visited the pyramids, describing her experience in her book Eastern Life, Past and Present (3 vols,1848), in vol.2, Part 1, ch.19. Leaving her ear-trumpet behind so as to keep her hands free for climbing, she clambered to the top of the Great Pyramid, then down again to explore the interior. Then she recalled the old saying, still quoted in guide books today, that “All things dread Time; but Time dreads the Pyramids.” (p.74)\n\nShelley would not grant even this: in time the monuments themselves would crumble away into oblivion, as he wrote in “Queen Mab”, written in 1813 (Part II, lines 126-133):\n\n‘Beside the eternal Nile\n\nThe Pyramids have risen.\n\nNile shall pursue his changeless way;\n\nThose Pyramids shall fall.\n\nYea! not a stone shall stand to tell\n\nThe spot whereon they stood;\n\nTheir very site shall be forgotten,\n\nAs is their builder’s name!’\n\nThe haunting image of former glory ruined and lost in desert sands is also to be found in Shelley’s poem Ozymandias, published in 1818:\n\nI met a traveller from an antique land\n\nWho said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\n\nStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,\n\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\n\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\n\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\n\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\n\nThe hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.\n\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear –\n\n\"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\n\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\"\n\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\n\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.'\n\nThere has been much controversy over what inspired Shelley to write this poem. What is not widely known is that it was written as part of a verse-writing competition, on the chosen theme of “Ozymandias, the King of Kings”, with his friend Horace Smith, which took place just after Christmas in 1817. Both poems were afterwards published in the Examiner – Shelley’s on January 11th 1818 and Smith’s (which is quoted in note 40 of the main essay) on February 1st. The chosen theme, plus some overlap of the two poems, shows that something specific prompted the competition. Certainly the title and the words which Shelley puts on the pedestal show that Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian of the first century BC, was a primary source. Diodorus describes a huge statue of a seated pharaoh:\n\n“….marvellous by reason of its artistic quality and excellent because of the nature of the stone, since in a block of so great a size there is not a single crack or blemish to be seen. The inscription upon it runs: ‘King of Kings am I, Osymandyas. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie, let him surpass one of my works.’” (Book 1, ch.47, translation by C.H.Oldfather, Loeb 1933)\n\nOzymandias is now identified as Rameses II, Ozymandias being a Greek rendering of one of his names.\n\nBeyond Diodorus Siculus, disagreement reigns as to the precise source(s) of inspiration. What seems fairly certain is that Shelley’s meeting with “a traveller from an antique land” is a poet’s way of saying that he (and Smith) saw an engraving of a broken statue in a book of someone else’s travels to Egypt, and linked it up, possibly on the basis of nothing more than poetic fancy, with that wonderful inscription recorded by Diodorus (which, so far as I know, has never actually been found on any statue!) But an engraving of which broken statue and in which book exactly? The candidates are legion. See, for example, D.W.Thompson, “Ozymandias”, in the Philological Quarterly, vol.16 (1937), p.59-64; Johnstone Parr, “Shelley’s Ozymandias” in the Keats-Shelley Journal, vol.6 (Winter 1957), p.31-35; Eugene M.Waith, “Ozymandias: Shelley, Horace Smith, and Denon” in the Keats-Shelley Journal, vol.44 (1995), p.22-28; and John Rodenbeck, “Travelers from an Antique Land: Shelley’s Inspiration for ‘Ozymandias’” in Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics, No.24 (2004), p.121-148.\n\nAnother view of the time-ravaged statuary of ancient Egypt is provided by.the following extract from a letter from Gustave Flaubert to Louis Bouilhet, written on his tour of Egypt, and dated June 2nd, 1850:\n\n“I have seen Thebes: it is very beautiful. We arrived one night at nine, in brilliant moonlight that flooded the columns. Dogs were barking, the great white ruins looked like ghosts, and the moon on the horizon, completely round and seeming to touch the earth, appeared to be motionless, resting there deliberately. Karnak gave us the impression of a life of giants. I spent a night at the feet of the Colossus of Memnon, devoured by mosquitoes. The old scoundrel has a good face and is covered with graffiti. Graffiti and bird-droppings are the only two things in the ruins of Egypt that give any indication of life. The most worn stone doesn’t grow a blade of grass; it falls into powder, like a mummy, and that is all…Often you see a tall, straight obelisk, with a long white stain down its entire length, like a drapery – wider at the top and tapering towards the base. That is from the vultures, who have been coming there to shit for centuries. It is a very handsome effect and has a curious symbolism. It is as though Nature said to the monuments of Egypt: ‘You will have none of me? You will not nourish the seed of the lichen? Eh bien, merde. I’ll shit on you.” ( From The Letters of Gustave Flaubert 1830-1857, selected, edited and translated by Francis Steegmuller (1981), p.119)\n\nIt is an apt observation that has a modern parallel. In any large English city there are statues of the good and great of past times, most of them now quite unknown to the people who pass them by today, and all of them seem to be the ignominious haunt of pigeons. Even Queen Victoria is not exempt. Sic transit gloria mundi, as they say.\n\nBut getting back to FitzGerald, in his note on verse 17 in the first edition, he adapts the following passage from vol.2, p.19-21 of Robert B.M.Binning, A Journal of Two Years’ Travel in Persia, Ceylon etc (1857) in which the traveller found various lines of poetry scrawled by ancient tourists on walls in the ruins of Persepolis:\n\n“Persians entertain our, not very praiseworthy, custom of writing their names in remarkable places which they may happen to visit; but the Persian usually accompanies his autograph with a verse or two of poetry, of his own or anybody else’s composition. In the nooks and recesses of this quadrangle, I observed sundry metrical effusions, illustrative of the vanity of human ambition, in connexion with these large structures; and copied one quatrain, an original no doubt, in rather halting metre which runs thus:\n\n‘Behold that proud temple that once reared its crest to the heavens. Kings and princes came hither to rub their foreheads upon its threshold. On its highest pinnacle I saw a ringdove perched, and she sang out coo, coo, coo (i.e. ‘where, where are they?’)’\n\nThe writer, though no great poet, is right in his sentiment. The builders of the palace-temple of Persepolis were doubtless influenced, like the Pharaohs who erected the pyramids, by a vain ambition and delusive hope of terrestrial immortality; and if events always turned out as human judgement proposes they should, the memory of these princes would co-exist with their beautiful works: but the hopes of man are rarely realized, and their names, and the period when they lived, are alike forgotten.\n\nIn the same recess, another visitor had transcribed an apposite couplet from Hafiz:\n\n‘The final resting-place of everyone is a handful or two of earth: say then where is the use of building stately mansions, lofty as the skies.’”\n\nFitzGerald spotted that the verse about the ringdove quoted by Binning was a corrupt version of one of Omar Khayyam’s verses, namely quatrain no. 419 in the Calcutta Manuscript (II.335). In the notes to the first edition he rendered the verse thus:\n\nThis Palace that its Top "
