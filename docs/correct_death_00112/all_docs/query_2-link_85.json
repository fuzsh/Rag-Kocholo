        "text": "In the summer of 1852 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, vacationing with his family in Newport, Rhode Island, happened one day upon the old Jewish cemetery, established in 1677. Impressed by the quiet of the ancient burial ground amid the bustle of the busy seaport, he persuaded “Mr. Gould the Tailor, a polite old gentleman who keeps the key,” to admit him into its silent serenity. The now-famous poem at right resulted from his walk among the crumbling tombstones.\n\nIsaacs, Judah, Moses, Alvares, Rivera…these first Jews of Newport had arrived in the New World in 1658, fleeing religious persecution. The settlement of Newport, then only nineteen years old, welcomed them…and, later, a group of Spanish Portuguese Jews who fled the Inquisition.\n\nIn 1759 Newport’s Jewish community built one of the first synagogues in the New World, naming it Touro for its first rabbi, whose descendants lie buried beneath the graceful monuments on the opposite page. They, and the humbler Jews whose names adorn the more modest graves on the following pages, repose in surroundings little changed since Longfellow found them “at rest in all this moving up and down.” But their dead nation, contrary to Longfellow’s expectations and in a manner beyond his ken, would rise again.\n\nHow strange it seems! These Hebrews in their graves,\n\nClose by the street of this fair seaport town,\n\nSilent beside the never-silent waves,\n\nAt rest in all this moving up and down!\n\nThe trees are white with dust, that o’er their sleep\n\nWave their broad curtains in the southwind’s breath,\n\nWhile underneath these leafy tents they keep\n\nThe long, mysterious Exodus of Death.\n\nAnd these sepulchral stories, so old and brown,\n\nThat pave with level flags their burial-place,\n\nSeem like the tablets of the Law, thrown down\n\nAnd broken by Moses at the mountain’s base.\n\nThe very names recorded here are strange,\n\nOf foreign accent, and of different climes;\n\nAlvares and Rivera interchange\n\nWith Abraham and Jacob of old times.\n\n‘Blessed be God, for he created Death!’\n\nThe mourners said, ‘and Death is rest, and peace’;\n\nThen added, in the certainty of faith,\n\n‘And giveth Life that nevermore shall cease.’\n\nClosed are the portals of their Synagogue,\n\nNo Psalms of David now the silence break,\n\nNo Rabbi reads the ancient Decalogue\n\nIn the grand dialect the Prophets spake.\n\nGone are the living, but the dead remain,\n\nAnd not neglected; for a hand unseen,\n\nScattering its bounty, like a summer rain,\n\nStill keeps their graves and their remembrance green.\n\nHow came they here? What burst of Christian hate,\n\nWhat persecution, merciless and blind,\n\nDrove o’er the sea—that desert desolate—\n\nThese Ishmaels and Hagars of mankind?\n\nThey lived in narrow streets and lanes obscure,\n\nGhetto and Judenstrass, in mirk and mire;\n\nTaught in the school of patience to endure\n\nThe life of anguish and the death of fire.\n\nAll their lives long, with the unleavened bread\n\nAnd bitter herbs of exile and its fears,\n\nThe wasting famine of the heart they fed,\n\nAnd slaked its thirst with marah of their tears.\n\nAnathema maranatha! was the cry\n\nThat rang from town to town, from street to street:\n\nAt every gale the accursed Mordecai\n\nWas mocked and jeered, and spurned by Christian feet.\n\nPride and humiliation hand, in hand\n\nWalked with them through the world where’er they went;\n\nTrampled and beaten were they as the sand,\n\nAnd yet unshaken as the continent.\n\nFor in the background figures vague and vast\n\nOf patriarchs and of prophets rose sublime,\n\nAnd all the great traditions of the Past\n\nThey saw reflected in the coming time.\n\nAnd thus forever with reverted look\n\nThe mystic volume of the world they read,\n\nSpelling it backward, like a Hebrew book,\n\nTill life became a Legend of the Dead.\n\nBut ah! what once has been shall be no more!\n\nThe groaning earth in travail and in pain\n\nBrings forth its races, but does not restore,"
