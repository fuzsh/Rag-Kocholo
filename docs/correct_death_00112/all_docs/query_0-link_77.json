        "text": "Romanticism. The first part of the second volume offers a selection of the writing of authors ranging from Blake to Keats. English Literature – An Anthology for Students. Volume 2 - From the Romanticism to the Twentieth Century. Poznań: Dom Wydawniczy Rebis, 2011, pp. 536.\n\n‘The New Ecce Homo’ is a very rare book, when I sent a Xeroxed copy to Dr. Gordon Stein, who was the greatest living authority, he called me and said that he had heard of the book but had not known it had been translated into English, and that he had never before seen a copy in any language. I find it a delight to read because of the great insight and delightful terminology the Author uses."
