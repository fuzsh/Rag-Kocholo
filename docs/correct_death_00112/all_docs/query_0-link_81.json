Ancestry.\n\nVan as a child suffered poliomyelites which left him with a withered left hand. His life was one of dedicated commitment, upon completing his education at Cambridge, his father, in a congratulatory letter, observed how hard Van had worked to achieve his results. He went on to a lifetime of service as a parish minister with the following quotes a sample of how he was regarded:\n\n\"Nobody could have served Cuckfield more faithfully and better than Mr Fenn had done\"\n\n\"Parting with the Rev E.V. Fenn has caused very real sorrow throughout the parish. His earnest and devoted service endeared him to one and all, and many will remember his unselfish example and faithful ministry with appreciation and gratitude. The high esteem and affection which he won by his unfailing kindness to everyone, add warmth and sincerity to heartfelt good wishes for his future well-being\".\n\n\"This parish has been enriched by the presence and quiet influence of the late E.V. Fenn . . . . . for his many helpful sermons . . . . . his quiet example of humble and sincere Christian faith, his complete unselfishness and his thoughtfulness for others\".\n\n\"The news of the death of the Rev E.V. Fenn was received in the villages of Lois Weedon and Weston, with very profound sorrow\"\n\nVan's sermons were both scholarly and spiritual, he was a well-regarded preacher.\n\nOrmskirk Advertiser\n\n12 October 1915\n\nThe New Vicar of Kirkby.\n\nInstitution by the Lord Bishop of Liverpool.\n\nA large number of the parishioners, in spite of the unfavourable weather, attended St Chad's Parish Church Kirkby to witness the institution of the new vicar, the Rev Ernest Vanderzee Fenn M.A., by the Lord Bishop of Liverpool, and his induction, by the Venerable Archdeacon Spooner, to the benefice. The Rev E Vanderzee Fenn has for the past 8 years been Curate of Cuckfield, Sussex and now succeeds the Rev R Lloyd Crawley Boevey who has resigned owing to failing health. The service was conducted by the Venerable Archdeacon Spooner, and opened with hymn \"Our blessed Redeemer\" . . . . .\n\nAfter the institution ceremony, Archdeacon Spooner received at the hands of the Bishop the Mandate of Induction, and in company with the new incumbent and the churchwardens (Messrs G Glover and James Merser) proceeded to the main door of the church, where the Rev E Vanderzee Fenn was inducted \"into the real, actual, and corporeal possession of the Church and Benefice of the New Parish of St Chad, Kirkby, in the Diocese of Liverpool, with all its fruits, members and appurtenances\"\n\nthe closing him was \"Through the night of doubt and sorrow\" and whilst this was being sung a collection on behalf of the Diocesan ordination candidates exhibition fund was taken.\n\nVan retired to live with his brother H L Fenn in N Z in 1951. His addition to the household helped considerably with financial matters, for, while not wealthy, Van enabled his brother to purchase newer cars, motor mowers to help with the big garden, etc. In 1955 he fell from his bicycle and died as a result of his injuries. Van did not marry, he was a very gentle, reserved, and scholarly man, who won great respect for his accepting and compassionate manner.

I say short because men who want to \"keep\" a full term are only obliged to \"keep \"49 nights.\" Keeping \"a night,\" by the way, means being in college between 12 midnight and 6 in the morning. On one occasion, a man decided to ride home on his bicycle; as it was summertime, he wanted to start very early, and so he left off at 4 o'clock; on arriving home, he found a telegram awaiting him, which requested his return to college, as he had not \"kept\" his full term by two hours.\n\nI said just above that this was the most enjoyable term ; these joys, however, I should mention, are by no means experienced by the third year \" honours \" men, whose tripos is fast approaching (though I am sure they make up for it after it's all over). They will have been \" up \" some time before most men arrive, putting in some extra work, for the time is now short before the \"dies nefasti.\" \"Tripos,\" by the way, is said to be derived from the word \"tripod\" or three-legged stool, on which the examiner sat facing the unfortunate candidates. This was in the days of \" viva voce \" exams., happily no longer now in existence.\n\nThe \"Trips,\" as they are called, all come off this term, but in good time to leave things clear for May Week. Much ignorance exists, I believe, amongst most people with regard to the, term \"May,\" as used at the Varsity. It is indeed, in itself, very misleading, for I may say at once that none of the things coupled with the word \"May\" have anything to do with the month alluded to at all. College \" Mays,\" for instance, are exams. held at the end of terms either in December, March, or June : \"May week\" itself is in the early part of June, and likewise also the May races, and so on. May week begins on June 5th this year, and lasts about 10 days (\"week,\" then, is another misnomer).\n\nThe first 4 days are devoted to the boat races, the most important events. Cambridge is crowded with visitors, and everyone almost goes down to the races; heaps of parties row up from the boathouses and line the bank with their boats, while others throng the \"paddock\" at Ditton, which is situated about half-way down the course, where the \"gallery\" bumps take place. It is said that some of the spectators care as little for the actual racing as the lady- who remarked that Henley would be really delightful if it wasn't for those tiresome races. However that may be, everyone seems very interested when the eights pass, though I admit the most exciting time is the return journey for those on the river.\n\nThe Cam, not being widely celebrated for any capacious breadth, is soon crowded from side to side. Rowing is out of the question very often; boats are incessantly running you down, and if you don't keep a good look-out your rudder will be unhooked and your boat will go anywhere but the right way then - this is a very old joke. There is, however, seldom an \"upset\" in spite of all the \"mush.\" I have only seen two canoes upside down with their former occupants in the water, but canoes are a bit risky on occasions like this. Well, the rest of May week is given up to college balls and concerts, etc., and then we come to more serious things.\n\nVisitors begin to disappear, and the examiners get their turn : tripos lists are now appearing, which had almost been forgotten in the past week. Men very seldom go to hear their own list read out, but send deputies, who return to congratulate or condole as the case may be. \"Degree\" day follows closely, and the rather tedious performance is for a few minutes relieved by the presentation of the famous wooden spoon to the last man in the mathematical tripos. When this happy man advances to receive his degree, a huge wooden shovel (bearing no resemblance to a spoon) is dangled in front of him from the gallery; as soon as he can manage to get hold of it he cuts it off and bears it away in triumph as a B.A. On one occasion a certain Vice Chancellor tried to abolish this ceremony, and every man who went up to the galleries was searched by the proctors. When the time came, however, there was the \"spoon\" again as usual dangling in front of the Vice-Chancellor himself.\n\nSo this brings us to the end of the term, and is perhaps a fitting end to this attempt at a description of something of what one experiences at Cambridge.\n\nE.

Vanderzee Fenn to succeed the present vicar, the Rev. R. Lloyd Crawley-Boevey, who will retire in August next.\n\nThe Rev. E. Vanderzee Fenn has for the past eight years been curate at Cuckfield, Haywards Heath, Sussex, where he has done excellent work. He is M.A. of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and was ordained in 1903 by the Bishop of Truro, when he was licenced to St. Minver, Cornwall.\n\nLord Sefton has presented the Rev. E. Fenn, curate ''of Cuckfield, to the vicarage of Kirkby, near Liverpool which is worth about L300 a year, with house.\n\nThe handsome church at Kirkby was rebuilt by the late Lord Sefton at a cost of L18,000. It contains a remarkable Roman font, highly decorated.\n\nOur readers will be much interested to hear that the Rev. E. V. Fenn will be inducted to the living of Kirkby on October 12th, at 7 p.m. (1915)\n\nThe Rev E V Fenn vicar of Kirkby Liverpool, has been appointed to the vicarage of Lois Weedon, Northamptonshire (Patrons Kings College Cambridge).\n\nThe Times 24 November 1927.\n\n1939 Register\n\nVicarage , Towcester R.D., Northamptonshire, England\n\nErnest V Fenn20 Feb 1880 single Clerk In Holy Orders\n\nMary Legg 07 Nov 1863 Housekeeper Widow\n\nIn 1951 Van travelled out to New Zealand on the Dominion Monarch to visit his brother and family, the following are extracts from the diary he kept off the voyage.\n\nFriday, January 12: At Waterloo I meet G Burne who comes to bid me farewell, though he cannot stay to see the trains start.

Fenn\n\nServed Church Over 50 Years\n\nThe Rev. E. V. Fenn, who died in Timaru yesterday, was a minister of the Anglican Church in England for many years before retiring and coming to live in Timaru. A few years ago he celebrated 50 years of ordination, and received many congratulatory messages from the parishioners he served so well at Home.\n\nMr Fenn, who was a bachelor, lived with his brother, Mr H. L. Fenn, at Gleniti. He was well known for his work at St. John's Church, Highfield, where he was ever ready to assist at services and for a period relieved as vicar.\n\nIn his quiet and efficient way Mr Fenn served the church faithfully and well for more than 50 years His work at St. John's will long be remembered.\n\nTimaru Herald - Jan 1956.\n\nTributes Paid at Funeral of Rev E. V. Fenn\n\nA tribute to a \"great friend and a great priest of the church\" was paid by the Rev. R. P. Andrews at the funeral of the Rev. E. V. Fenn held in St John's, Highfield, .yesterday. There was a large attendance of parishioners and friends of the late Mr Fenn.\n\n\"Mr Fenn was a man of real humility and sincerity,\" said Mr Andrews.\n\nHe mentioned that in the Sanctuary at St John's was a prie dieu which Mr Fenn had given the church to commemorate his 50 years in the ministry.\n\nMr Andrews also spoke of the great help given St John's by Mr Fenn during the last five years, particularly at the time the ministry was vacant, and when he, Mr Andrews, was without the services of an assistant curate.\n\nDuring the service at the church the choir sang Psalm 23 and the hymn \"Now Thank We All Our God.\"\n\nAssisting Mr Andrews at the services at the church and at the graveside was the Rev. B. A. W. Beckett, and the clergy was represented by the Rev. Canon H. S. Hamilton, Waihao Downs, the Rev. L. E. Cartridge, of Waimate, and the Rev. G. S. Lamont, of St Mary's, Timaru. Two members of the clergy, the Rev. J. Thomas, of St Peter's, Kensington, and the Rev. A. A. Purchas, of Fairlie, were pallbearers.\n\nTimaru Herald - Jan 1956\n\nMemorial Service\n\nTo Rev. E. V. Fenn\n\nHeld at St. John's (Timaru NZ)\n\n\"Seek those things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God\"\n\nHow true these words are of Ernest Vanderzee Fenn,\" said the vicar, the Rev. R. P. Andrews, at the memorial service to the Rev. E. V. Fenn held in St John's, Highfield, last night.\n\n\"When a man is ordained to the ministry he is called upon to make his main interest the things of God, the teaching and spiritual welfare of God's children; and to make his main study the Word of God. After 50 years, even when he had retired from active ministry, Mr Fenn never failed each day to read his Bible and to study it in the original texts of Greek and Latin; and also to say the daily offices of Matins and Evensong.\n\n\"His mind was indeed set upon the things above, and yet this interest in the Scriptures and in prayer went hand-in-hand with a lively interest in people and, especially, a desire to help whenever possible. Mr Fenn, who was a nephew of our late Archbishop Julius, took his M.A. degree at, Cambridge University and studied at Wells Theological College. After serving two curacies, he was vicar of Kirkby for 12 years and of Lois Weedon for 24 years.\n\n\"It was a happy day for this parish when, on his retirement, Mr Fenn came to visit the home of his brother at Gleniti and a happier day still when he found such a warm and happy welcome that he decided to stay. We have often had reason to be grateful for his ready and able assistance in this parish. For two months before I came to St. John's Mr Fenn conducted all the services; and during my first year, when we had no assistant curate, he gave invaluable help, enabling us to increase the services in the other centre's.\n\n\"I know that you appreciated, as I did, his sincere desire to be of assistance; and his helpful sermons which, while giving evidence of his careful Bible study, always contained a message to take away. But it is not only in this parish that Mr Fenn gave such willing and able help. In almost every parish in South Canterbury he took services, sometimes for several weeks at a time\"\n\n\"But I think the two things for which most of us will remember Van Fenn are his simple and sincere humility and his thoughtfulness for others. His humility was rooted in his love of God and his consciousness of God's blessings. When he had completed 50 years in the ministry his first thought was, How can I in some tangible way express my thanks to God and we are proud to have in our, church his beautiful gift for this purpose\"\n\n\"His thoughtfulness for others, often when he might so well have been thinking of himself, has been an example to all of us. We shall long remember his many acts of unselfish kindness, and remembering will help us to do the same.\n\n\"Here was a man who, at the call of God, set his affections on things above, and who found the love of God and the work of the ministry thrilling and satisfying.\n\n\"And so as we offer our sympathy to those from whose family circle, he will be sadly missed, we thank God for the wonderful example of his life and ministry; and also for the joyful knowledge that our loved ones do not die, but pass as it were through a doorway to a larger and brighter room.\n\n\"Of Ernest Vanderzee Fenn it, may well be said:\n\nBlessed are the dead that die in the Lord, even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours' And for ourselves, this promise of St. Paul is true; if we will set our affections upon things above, then Christ, Who is our life, shall appear, then shall we appear with Him in Glory\".\n\nAssisting Mr Andrews at the services at the church and at the graveside were the Rev B.A.W. Beckett, and the clergy was represented by the Rev Canon H. S. Hamilton, Waihao Downs, the Rev L. E. Cartridge of Waimate, and the Rev G. S. Lamont of St Mary's, Timaru. Two members of the clergy, the Rev Jim Thomas of St Peter's, Kensington, and the Rev A. A. Purchas, of Fairlie, were pallbearers, also Edward Elworthy, Hamilton Sinclair-Thomson, Dr Melville Brookfield, & Edward Fenn.\n\nTimaru Herald - 1956\n\nCatalogue of (Fenn) Family Memorabilia, Ref S/49 has a collection of three of Van's sermon notes.\n\nResearch Notes:\n\nLater date of ordination from his diary and confirmed in a postcard to Van from his Aunt Isabella Cotes dated 17 Mar 1904.\n\nFrom a collection of letters, from parishioners, kept by Van.\n\nDear Sir just a line to ask you kindly if you could posoble marry me and George next Wensday as he had the bands put up here as well and he cannot get the paper or else we're going to have the weeding Wensday next half past 9 but he say he cant get the paper Sir mother is so worried about it and we have written to our relations to come as he told us two and do not know what two do if you cannot do it Sir could you kindly have the bands called to Morrow Sunday both of this parish as he always here Sir mother is so worried Sir about me it hard for her to keep me at home so long A is now I've been at home And it so hard for her to bear Sir we should take a lot of her mind if you could marry us next Wensday he is coming to see you this morning Sir or could you come to see mother of this morning Sir she be home morning but out after dinner\n\nFrom your truly E.

I hope you like him. We had our holidays the first month at a place near Midhurst. Everybody here misses you dreadfully, and the spirit has quite gone out of Bateman.\n\nWe went to Portsmouth and all went over the Royal Sovereign.

It was kind of you to say that you would never get a kinder vicar than father, and I quite believe it: we, on our part will never get a nicer curate, or anybody more unselfish than you. I hope you won't mind me saying this - and really every one of our family like you extremely and all felt like weeping when we heard you had to go - and I bet 2d Mary did.\n\nSt Minver is all very nice in its way but too quiet in the winter pour moi. I have given up smoking for Lent and a few other things too - I really don't smoke much. I bewail the fact that I am leaving this place at the end of term - I get a ripping time here and like no end. Father doesn't care for the church teaching here and another thing can't afford L.60 a year when he might be paying half that amount at Kings. Father doesn't think I do well here, because I have never brought back a prize - I might have perhaps if I was allowed to go in for sports. Any rate I shall try my hand at that next term at Kings - I shan't be stopped there. I expect you think me the black sheep of the family - and there you're right - Jack and Paul are much better and \"gooder\" than I ditto Mary. Jack and Paul are jolly good sorts and Mary too - although I often have rows with them. Well I will stop here.\n\nWith Love to you I am Yrs.\n\nAffectionately Marc Antony B\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n1. Census: England, 3 Apr 1881, 1 Portland Tce The Green Richmond SRY.

It was an autumn evening,\n\nAnd the sun had sunk to rest\n\nWhen the event took place, which I\n\nWill tell at thy behest\n\n2. At Colchester a famous town\n\nNear England's eastern shore\n\nThere dwelt a family of Fenns\n\nFamous in time of yore\n\n3. The father was a doctor grand\n\nHe'd six sons (one a baby)\n\nBut now instead of any boys\n\nHe wanted a young lady\n\n4. Well on this night the story goes\n\nThe wish was brought to pass\n\nA little baby girl was born\n\nA fat and charming lass\n\n5. And soon the joyful news was spread\n\nThrough England high and low\n\nTo Stubbington and Tiverton\n\nTo London and Veytaux\n\n6. For of these Fenn's the eldest was\n\nA student up in town\n\nWho worked all day and slept all night\n\nAnd wore a cap and gown\n\n7. The second son was far away\n\nIn Switzerland's fair land\n\nHe had a tutor and was trained\n\nFor engineering grand\n\n8. The third and fourth in distant parts\n\nWere being taught at school\n\nThe fifth son still remained at home\n\nUnder a lady's rule\n\n9. The sixth was not yet two years old\n\nAnd could not speak one word\n\nThe seventh was the baby\n\nOf whom you all have heard\n\n10. Yes we seven now in all\n\nAs happy as can be\n\nSix manly boys and now at last\n\nA gentle little she\n\nE. V.

Who is lying in the playroom\n\nWith his nose upon his paw\n\nStaring straight into the fire\n\nWishing now for nothing more\n\n2. Why t'is Tip that dog of beauty\n\nWho is lying on the rug\n\nHe's a slender made for service\n\nNot a fat and ugly Pug\n\n3. When his master standing near him\n\nThrows a pebble or a stick\n\nWith a bark and with a scamper\n\nHe is off and running quick\n\n4. He has now six noble masters\n\nAnd a little mistress fair\n\nYes the Echo answers gently\n\nShe was only born the year\n\n5. Yes his master's love him dearly\n\nAnd they give him names so rum\n\nAs Chameleon oh how leafley\n\nComey, Yoney, Will he hum\n\n6. When the holidays are over\n\nAnd the cab is at the door\n\nHow he cries and moans unhappy\n\nGently lifting up one paw\n\n7. But the day that brings his master's\n\nHome to see his face again\n\nMakes him happy makes him joyful\n\nTakes away his grief and pain\n\n8.

The Chimes from the adjacent church were distinctly heard, when Seven Poor Travellers commenced singing A Christmas Carol. Barnaby Rudge then arrived from The Old Curiosity Shop with some Pictures from Italy and Sketches by Boz to show Little Dorrit who was busy sorting The Pickwick Papers. David Copperfield who had been taking American Notes then entered and informed the company that The Great Expectations of Dombey and Son respecting Mrs Lirriper's Legacy had not been realised. He also told them that he had been watching Boots at The Holly Tree inn taking Somebody's Luggage from Mugly Junction to Mrs Lirriper's Lodgings in a street that has No Thoroughfare opposite Bleak House where The Haunted Man had given one of Dr Marigold's Prescriptions to aid The Commercial Traveller who was brooding over The Mystery of Edwin Drood\n\nPostcard addressed\n\nHarold L.

(Begun) 27th March 1906\n\nSt Minver Wadebridge.\n\nMy dear Harry\n\nI have just had a letter from Father telling me of your departure and how Charlie, Cyril and Edgar were down at Tilbury with you. I had intended to send you a wire, but did not find out the time of your departure etc, so I hastily wrote a note and send it to Streatham via Charlie - I hope you got it. Then on studying the papers I see that the Tongariro spent half a day at Plymouth. Would that I had known it beforehand for I should certainly have come up to see you. However it is too late and it is no use crying over lost opportunities. Then, Henry my boy I ought to have sent you a birthday and a parting present, but I put it off till too late: and parcels cost a lot, I suppose, to NZ. Never mind I must make you a present of all I say. Well, by the time you get this I suppose you will be in the Episcopal residence, for I want to send this off by this week's mail. I am thinking about you now in this bitter weather, he with such strong E winds and am wondering what sort of a passage you are having through the famous Bay of Biscay, and what sort of a travelling companion Mr Morris turns out to be. I hope you are going through the voyage without seasickness. Several people have spoken about you here; indeed your visit caused quite a little excitement in the parish. Here I must bring the first instalment of my letter to an end. I still grieve over the fact that I let you go away without sending you a farewell gift. I am sorry brother.\n\nMarch 28th\n\nMany happy returns of the day. Your birthday here is a brilliant sun shining day, but it still blows hard and cold from the NE I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of your bicycle, I dare say it will arrive before the end of the week, otherwise I shall write and hurry Paull up a little. We had an exciting incident at one of the farms last week. A young fellow went off his head suddenly and attacked his aunt, sister and brother: they tried to keep him in a room while the aunt ran to help, but he smashed the door and pursued the old lady knocking her down with an axe: but his brother and sister then tackled him and managed to hold him, in spite of bites and kicks, until help came. We are all very thankful it was not much worse for he might have killed all three had it happened at night. The old aunt is recovering fast. By the way the Sunday you were at St Minver vicarage you met her sister, Miss Tummon, (pronounced Tumon) after service, when she had come in for her magazines.\n\nMarch 30th\n\nHere there is a delay of two days, and certainly this letter will not go till next week's mail now. We have got a beautiful day today reminding me of the weather we had while you were staying with me. It really was providential having such grand weather those few days. I am sure we have not had anything like it since, nor for many weeks before you came. I shall long remember our trip to Trevose lighthouse, and to Pentire etc, and our Sunday together. I had a letter from Dolly the other day urging me to offer for a curacy in Richmond as Mr Binny is still advertising for another priest: but I am sure Richmond would not suit me. I know too many people! I suppose you managed to pay all your farewell visits, but you must have had a rush at the last. We are getting near Easter now and our practising our anthem, Wesley's \"Blessed be God\". I hope choir and organist do not break down. We hope to have the \"choral\" concert on April 25 when we perform our \"oratorio\" and we only have one or two more practises left for that. I went over to St Kew last week to preach on a Wednesday evening. It was a somewhat gloomy service, and the organ blower added to the strangeness of the proceedings by letting the wind out and producing that weird noises which Edgar used to call a goat's noise? or something of that kind, when you had your All Saints recitals. In my sermon I suddenly perceived the book rest in the pulpit vanishing below and could do nothing to arrest its downward progress. However it did not put me out at all and I let it go down as far as it liked. It's getting on for 2.30 so I must be off to do some visiting and continue this epistle another time.\n\nApril 2nd\n\nAnother two days interval. Yesterday being Sunday I had no time for writing nor yet on Saturday. Your bicycle has arrived quite safely and in good condition. It came out by the bus on Friday and I unpacked it at once and rode up to Churchtown that evening for choir practice on my new treasure. It is nice after my old fixed wheel and chain cracking bike. I feel that you did not make me give you enough for it. Thank you muchly for letting me have it. I was wondering yesterday what sort of a Sunday you had, whether there was any clergyman on board or any attempt made to have a Sunday service. The weather has improved a little now, and we had a beautiful evening yesterday. I was preaching at St Minver evensong and had a nice congregation to talk to. This morning I had a long letter from Aunt Isabella, with an account of Harold Hand's death. I had heard nothing of it, save a bare mention of the fact from a letter of Dolly's, so I was glad to hear about it. Aunt Annie seems dreadfully upset; altogether it was so sudden and unexpected. Edgar paid Aunt I a visit, he was stopping with Charlie apparently, for the sports. Cambridge had an easy beating, seven events to three and probably will be defeated in the boat race also this year. I shall miss your telegram, which for two years has brought the news to St Minver so speedily, but if Edgar goes up I must make him wire. It seems odd to think that when you get this letter, the race will have been over for about six weeks! I wonder if news such as the Oxford Cambridge race gets out speedily to NZ. I have not heard anything of Polly Julius (as she was) though I suppose she must be in England now. You must give my love to all at Bishops Court Uncle Churchill, Aunt Alice, Ada and Bertha, but I do not think I have ever set eyes on Ada and certainly I have not seen Bertha (so tall!). Here comes dinner I must go on another time.\n\nApril 4th\n\nI am going to finish off this epistle today so that you may get it by the time you reach NZ or soon after. I had Paull's bill today, very moderate charges considering all he did in the way of cleaning, overhauling etc: also a letter from old Mrs Smith of Richmond. She had heard from Father of your departure and wished me when I wrote to you to tell you that she sends every good wish for your future prosperity. She went back to reminiscences of Fonnnereau House??, etc. I always connect Mrs S. with invitations to drink tea with her, to meet Rosy, and to sit in her pew!. Edgar has sent me a long account of the Varsity sports. A Keble man won the 3 miles much to Edgar's satisfaction. I shall never forget the sports day when Dolly was with us, and we fought for a cup of tea afterwards and were charged ruinous prices. The betting on the Varsity Boat Race has veered round to Cambridge now but they are fully trained and in danger of overtraining. However we are looking forward to a good struggle on Saturday. When you are in Christchurch seek out a good worthy man by name Rogers incumbent St Albans Church, I fancy; Uncle Churchill will know him. He comes from these parts; knows Mrs Hereford and would be very interested to see you and hear about your visit to St Minver and your meeting with Mrs H. I am hoping this letter will not be more than 21/2oz for I am sending it for a penny and don't want to begin by overcharging you. Whenever you get a spare moment to write, your letters will now be exceedingly welcome. You had better right general epistles home which Father can send round the family.\n\nGoodbye, and please give my love to everybody at Bishops Court. This is a very disjointed letter, I am afraid, and full of nothing in particular. Edgar said, by the way, that he never saw Charlie give you any note from me so I am afraid you'd never got my farewell message. I am sorry. Here I must end up wishing you speed his success in picking up a job and every happiness in your abode the other side of the globe.\n\nI remain\n\nEver your affectionate brother\n\nE. Vanderzee Fenn.\n\nSt Minver\n\nWadebridge\n\nNovember 6, 1906\n\nMy dear Harry\n\nAfter a careful study of the calendar I conclude that a letter dispatched this week will reach you just before the 25th of next month: so I am now writing to wish you a very happy Christmas, and this letter is my Christmas card! I suppose you will hardly be dining off roast turkey and hot plum pudding or mince pies, in the middle of summer, but that your Christmas fare will correspond to the season of the year; perhaps including ices amoungst other cold collations. Anyhow I do hope you will enjoy your Christmas Day, though I suppose there will be no hope of your getting to Timaru for a celebration or an ordinary service with the good old Christmas hymns. I had hoped to secure a short holiday at that time between my departure from St Minver and my settling down to work in my new parish so as to have one more Chris"
