        "text": "God sent His singers upon earth\n\nWith songs of sadness and of mirth;\n\nThat they might touch the hearts of men,\n\nAnd bring them back to heaven again.\n\nThe first, a youth, with soul of fire,\n\nHeld in his hand a golden lyre;\n\nThrough groves he wandered and by streams,\n\nPlaying the music of our dreams.\n\nThe second, with a bearded face,\n\nStood singing in the market place;\n\nAnd stirred with accents deep and loud,\n\nThe hearts of all the listening crowd.\n\nA gray old man, the third and last,\n\nSang in cathedrals dim and vast;\n\nWhile the majestic organ rolled,\n\nContrition from its mouths of gold.\n\nAnd those who heard the singers three,\n\nDisputed which the best might be;\n\nFor still their music seemed to start,\n\nDiscordant echoes from each heart—\n\nTill the great Master said, I see\n\nThere is no best, but in degree:\n\nI gave a various gift to each,\n\nTo charm, to strengthen and to teach.\n\nThese are the three great Chords of might,\n\nAnd he whose ear is tuned aright,\n\nWill hear no discord in the three,\n\nBut the most perfect harmony."
