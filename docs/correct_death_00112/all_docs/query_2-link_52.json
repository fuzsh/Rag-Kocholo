        "text": "I heard the bells on Christmas Day\n\nTheir old, familiar carols play,\n\nAnd wild and sweet\n\nThe words repeat\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nAnd thought how, as the day had come,\n\nThe belfries of all Christendom\n\nHad rolled along\n\nThe unbroken song\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nTill ringing, singing on its way,\n\nThe world revolved from night to day,\n\nA voice, a chime,\n\nA chant sublime\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nThen from each black, accursed mouth\n\nThe cannon thundered in the South,\n\nAnd with the sound\n\nThe carols drowned\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nIt was as if an earthquake rent\n\nThe hearth-stones of a continent,\n\nAnd made forlorn\n\nThe households born\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\n\nAnd in despair I bowed my head;\n\n\"There is no peace on earth,\" I said;\n\n\"For hate is strong,\n\nAnd mocks the song\n\nOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\""
