        "text": "Death: 24th March 1882\n\nLocation: Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States\n\nCause of death: Peritonitis\n\nPhoto taken by: Midnightdreary\n\nBuy books by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nAmerican poet born in Portland, Maine, and educated at Bowdoin College in Brunswick; where he met his lifelong friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Longfellow became a professor of modern languages at Bowdoin and then Harvard, where he first began to publish his poetry. He retired from Harvard in 1854 to concentrate on his writing.\n\nHis first wife, Mary Potter, died in 1835 after a miscarriage. His second wife, Frances Appleton, died in 1861 after sustaining burns from her dress catching fire. After her death, Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time and focused on his translation; he was the first American to translate Dante's The Divine Comedy. His work was popular in his own lifetime and today he is remembered for The Song of Hiawatha and The Village Blacksmith among others."
