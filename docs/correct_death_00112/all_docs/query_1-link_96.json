You should visit Browse Happy and update your internet browser today!\n\nIn the valley of the Pegnitz, where across broad meadow-lands\n\nRise the blue Franconian mountains, Nuremberg, the ancient, stands.\n\nQuaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art and song,\n\nMemories haunt thy pointed gables, like the rooks that round them throng:\n\nMemories of the Middle Ages, when the emperors, rough and bold,\n\nHad their dwelling in thy castle, time-defying, centuries old;\n\nAnd thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted, in their uncouth rhyme,\n\nThat their great imperial city stretched its hand through every clime.\n\nIn the court-yard of the castle, bound with many an iron hand,\n\nStands the mighty linden planted by Queen Cunigunde’s hand;\n\nOn the square the oriel window, where in old heroic days\n\nSat the poet Melchior singing Kaiser Maximilian’s praise.\n\nEverywhere I see around me rise the wondrous world of Art:\n\nFountains wrought with richest sculpture standing in the common mart;\n\nAnd above cathedral doorways saints and bishops carved in stone,\n\nBy a former age commissioned as apostles to our own.\n\nIn the church of sainted Sebald sleeps enshrined his holy dust,\n\nAnd in bronze the Twelve Apostles guard from age to age their trust;\n\nIn the church of sainted Lawrence stands a pix of sculpture rare,\n\nLike the foamy sheaf of fountains, rising through the painted air.\n\nHere, when Art was still religion, with a simple, reverent heart,\n\nLived and labored Albrecht Durer, the Evangelist of Art;\n\nHence in silence and in sorrow, toiling still with busy hand,\n\nLike an emigrant he wandered, seeking for the Better Land.\n\nEmigravit is the inscription on the tombstone where he lies;\n\nDead he is not, but departed,—for the artist never dies.\n\nFairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair,\n\nThat he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air!\n\nThrough these streets so broad and stately, these obscure and dismal lanes,\n\nWalked of yore the Mastersingers, chanting rude poetic strains.\n\nFrom remote and sunless suburbs came they to the friendly guild,\n\nBuilding nests in Fame’s great temple, as in spouts the swallows build.\n\nAs the weaver plied the shuttle, wove he too the mystic rhyme,\n\nAnd the smith his iron measures hammered to the anvil’s chime;\n\nThanking God, whose boundless wisdom makes the flowers of poesy bloom\n\nIn the forge’s dust and cinders, in the tissues of the loom.\n\nHere Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, laureate of the gentle craft,\n\nWisest of the Twelve Wise Masters, in huge folios sang and laughed.\n\nBut his house is now an ale-house, with a nicely sanded floor,\n\nAnd a garland in the window, and his face above the door;\n\nPainted by some humble artist, as in Adam Puschman’s song,\n\nAs the old man gray and dove-like, with his great beard white and long.\n\nAnd at night the swart mechanic comes to drown his cark and care,\n\nQuaffing ale from pewter tankard; in the master’s antique chair.\n\nVanished is the ancient splendor, and before my dreamy eye\n\nWave these mingled shapes and figures, like a faded tapestry.\n\nNot thy Councils, not thy Kaisers, win for thee the world’s regard;\n\nBut thy painter, Albrecht Durer, and Hans Sachs thy cobbler-bard.\n\nThus, O Nuremberg, a wanderer from a region far away,\n\nAs he paced thy streets and court-yards, sang in thought his careless lay:"
