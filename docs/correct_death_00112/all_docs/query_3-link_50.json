        "text": "Each piece is custom finished. Depending on a sculpture’s texture and level of detail, the look of a patina can vary. A slight variation in color from order to order is to be expected.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, our reproductions are hand cast in plaster and reinforced with burlap, fiber strands, and/or metal rods for extra strength.\n\nFLAT WHITE: A unified, matte white finish. This is the optimum patina for cast drawing as it allows focus on form.\n\nWHITE PATINA: A white finish with a light ivory tone added to the top surfaces.\n\nLIGHT ANTIQUE PLASTER: A soft mixture of whites, grays, and yellows to replicate the look of an aged plaster cast.\n\nANTIQUE PLASTER: A dramatic mixture of grays and yellows to replicate the look of an aged plaster cast.\n\nBRONZE: A rich brown finish with golden highlights to replicate the look of bronze.\n\nSTONE: A mixture of lighter tones to resemble natural stone.\n\nDARK STONE: A mixture of darker tones to resemble natural stone.\n\nSANDSTONE: A soft base color with warm highlights to resemble the look of natural sandstone.\n\nTERRA COTTA: A variation of warm tones to resemble terra cotta.\n\nASSYRIAN STONE (Applies only to item numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 and 738): A two-tone patina augmenting the shallow relief sculpture and its stone texture.\n\nTANAGRA PATINA (Applies only to item numbers 317, 318, 319, 320, 396 and 813): A finish that replicates the colors of the Tanagra figurines as shown in the product images."
