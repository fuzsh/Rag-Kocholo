        "text": "A thesis submitted to the Division of Modern Languages, Harvard University, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, by Karl O. E. Anderson\n\nIn Three Volumes\n\nVolume I\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\n1940\n\nCHAPTER II: The Culmination of Morris’s Interest in the North: 1871-1876\n\nDuring the years 1871 to 1876 Morris’s interest in early Scandinavia reached its height, and during this period he devoted practically all of his time and energy to his Scandinavian work. He not only continued to translate Icelandic sagas, turning at least twelve of these works into English, either wholly or in part, but he also prepared renderings of a number of Icelandic, Danish, and Swedish ballads. He made two prolonged trips to Iceland, one in 1871 and the other in 1873, visiting the scenes of his beloved sags and drawing fresh inspiration from the country, its people, and its literature. He wrote a great number of minor poems which were a direct result either of his visits to Iceland or of his growing acquaintance with Old Norse literature. And at the very end of this period he produced his long poem Sigurd the Volsung, which is considered by most critics to be without question the greatest English work – if not the only truly great work in English – inspired by a Norse legend.\n\nIn the case of the Scandinavian work Morris produced before 1871, we know, or can ascertain fairly definitely, the exact time at which the various translations or original poems were written out: in the case of the Norse works he prepared during the period 1871 to 1876, however, we are generally not aware of the precise date of composition. Hence I shall not be able to discuss the renderings and poems belonging to this period in their chronological order, as I have done with his earlier productions, but I shall\n\n[147]\n\ntreat them instead by groups.\n\nI have already called attention to the fact that Morris translated a number of Scandinavian ballads, and I have pointed out that he began turning Northern folk songs into English at least as early as the beginning of 1870, for his rendering of “Hafbur og Signy,” the first of those that are dated, was composed on February 4th of that year. In all, Morris translated ten Scandinavian ballads – namely, “Habfur and Signy,” “Hildebrand Hellelil,” “Agnes and the Hill-Man,” “Knight Aagen and Maide Else,” “The Mother under the Mold,” “Axel Thordson and fair Walborg,” “The Lay of Christine,” “The Son’s Sorrow,” “Den Lillas Testamente,” and “Herr Malmstens drőm.” Only four of these renderings are dated or can be fairly definitely dated, - “Hafbur and Signy,” which, as I just pointed out, is marked “February 4, 1870” in the hologram manuscript, “The Lay of Christine” and “The Son’s Sorrow,” which must have been prepared before August 26, 1870 because they are included in an illuminated manuscript finished at that time, and “Hildebrand and Hellelil,” which is dated “March 1, 1871.” Although the date of the compositions of the other six is not definitely known, it is generally assumed that all these ballad translations were written out in the early 1870’s.\n\n[148]\n\nMorris printed none of his ballad renderings until 1891, when he included in Poems by the Way “Hafbur and Signy,” “Hildebrand and Hellelil,” “Agnes and the Hill-Man,” “Knight Aagen and Maiden Else,’ “The Lay of Christine,” and “The Son’s Sorrow.” The first four Morris described – and correctly so – as translations from the Danish: the last two, as he indicated, are renderings from the Icelandic. “The Mother under the Mold,” also Danish, was first published by Miss Morris in 1915 in the last volume of the Collected Works. Morris’s translations of “Den Lillas Testamente” and “Herr Malmstens drőm,” two Swedish folk songs, were not put into print until 1936, when Miss Morris included them in her William Morris: Artist Writer Socialist. the rendering of the famous Danish ballad “Axel Thordson and Fair Walbrog” has never been published; Miss Morris, in the book just mentioned, merely states that the manuscript is in her possession, describing it as a “long ballad in four-line verse, from the Danish.” She does not indicate whether the translation is complete.\n\nIn the case of the five Danish ballad renderings by Morris that have been published, I find that for four of them he followed the versions given in Abrahamson, Nyerup, and Rahoek’s Udvalgte Danske Viser fra Middelalderen; for only one did he use the text in Grundtvig’s Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser. It is rather surprising that for\n\n[149]\n\nfour of these folk songs Morris preferred the versions in Udvalgte Danske Viser to those in Danmarks Gamle Folkeviser; - Grundtvig’s texts always reproduce the ballads exactly as they are found in the old manuscripts or in contemporary recordings, without any alterations or additions, and hence present the songs in their original form, with all their crudities and inconsistencies as well as with all their vigor and color, whereas Abrhamson, Nyerup, and Rahbek in their edition frequently make changes, additions, and deletions in accordance with modern taste and sometimes combine\n\n[150]\n\nseveral ballads to form their own version, in this way giving the songs a literary finish which is really foreign to them. For his Icelandic ballad translations, Morris followed the texts given in Svend Grundtvig and Jón Sigurðsson’s Íslenzk Fornkvæðl. One of his renderings from the Swedish, “Dan Lillas Testamente,” he based on the version of this ballad in Adolf I Arwidsson’s Scenska Fornsånger; for the other, “Herr Malmstens drðm,” he used the text in Geijer and Afzelius’s Svenska Folk-Visor.\n\nMost of the ten ballads Morris translated had previously been turned into foreign languages. Five of the six Danish ones were very well known in English, German, and French versions, and the sixth had appeared in English once; the two Icelandic songs, how-\n\n[151]\n\never, so far as I know, had never before been rendered into\n\n[152]\n\nEnglish or French, and only one of them had ever been turned into German; of the two Swedish ballads, one had been printed in English, German, and French, and the other had appeared in German and French but never in English.\n\n“The Mother under the Mold,” and the Swedish ballad translations call for special comment. As I have already stated, none of these pieces were published by Morris himself, the Danish folk song appearing first in 1915 in the Collected Works and the Swedish\n\n[153]\n\nones in 1936 in William Morris: Artist Writer Socialist. When Miss Morris printed these works, she did not indicate that they were translations, but presented them as original compositions of her father. However, the three poems follow so closely to the Scandinavian ballads designated above – namely, “Den Dødes Igjenksomst” in Abrahamson, Nyerup, and Rahbek’s Udvalgte Danske Viser, “Den Lillas Testamente” in Arwidsson’s Svenska Fornsánger, and “Herr Malmstens drőm” in Geijer and Afzelius’s Svenska Folk-Visor – that there can be practically no doubt that they are direct translations of these Scandinavian pieces. In the case of the first one, the rendering is so exact that there is not room for any uncertainty whatsoever. In the other two poems Morris departs occasionally from the Swedish ballads just cited, but although some of these differences are surprising, they are really not great enough to justify any serious doubts that Morris’s compositions are translations. Moreover, these discrepancies are almost certainly not the result of Morris’s having followed some other version of these songs, as it seems at first that they might be, for an examination of all the European folk songs on these two themes that are recorded or mentioned in the ballad collections of F.J. Child, S. Grundtvig, and Geijer and Afzelius shows, as I shall make clear in a moment,\n\n[154]\n\nthat of all these versions the two Swedish ones referred to above are by far the closest to Morris’s poems; evidently the differences between these Swedish pieces and Morris’s translations were simply the result of his incomplete knowledge of the Swedish language or of the demands of the metre and rhyme.\n\nThe ballad theme embodied in “Den Lillas Testamente” is extremely widespread, being found throughout almost the whole of Europe, in the introductory remarks he gives in his English and Scottish Popular Ballads to “Lord Randall,” the English equivalent of this folk song, Professor Child cites 18 versions of this ballad in English, 12 in Italian, 6 in German, 1 in Dutch, 2 in Swedish, 2 in Danish, 2 in Magyar, and 1 in Wendish. A comparison of all these texts with Morris’s reveals, as I just stated, that the one called “Den Lillas Testamente” in Arwidsson’s Svenska Fornsánger offers by far the closest resemblance to Morris’s piece and must almost certainly have been Morris’s source. Not only does this Swedish folk song correspond more closely in general form and substance to the poem in question than do any of the other versions, but it also contains certain details found in this work which are not given in any of the other numerous ballads on the same subject. For example, it is only in Arwidsson’s version that the poisonous food of which the central figure in the folk song has partaken and is now dying is described as fried eels and pepper. In regard to the medium of the poisoning Child says,\n\nThere is all but universal consent that the poisoning was done by serving up snakes for fish. The Magyar says a toad, English M. a four-footed fish, and German D a well-peppered broth and a glass of red wine. English L adds a drink of hemlook stocks to the speckled trout; F, H have simply poison. The fish are distinctively eels in the Italian versions, and in English A, D, E, G, T, Swedish B.\n\n[155]\n\nThus, although some of the versions state that the poison was eels and one mentions pepper, it is only in Arwidsson’s ballad that we find the combination fried eels and pepper. Furthermore, it is in Arwidsson’s version alone that the list of bequests made by the victim of the poisoning is given in exactly the same order and form as in Morris’s poem; in fact, I believe this Swedish folk song is the only one in which the dying person refers in his will to barns filled with wheat.\n\nI stated above that Morris’s poem differs in some respects from Arwidsson’s ballad and that these discrepancies are evidently the result either of deliberate changes or of failure on the part of Morris to understand the Swedish. Thus, in the first stanza of the original the girl who has been poisoned says,\n\n“Jag har vát i bänne\n\nHos broderen min!”\n\nbut in Morris’s poems she states,\n\n“To my brother’s house I went to play.”\n\nThe reason for Morris’s incorrect rendering of the Swedish here was very likely that he was unacquainted with the word “bänne,” meaning “prison,” which is now obsolete. Again, in the third and fourth stanzas the Swedish says that after the girl had eaten the eels, she gave the bones to the dogs, and they as a result burst into fifteen pieces; but Morris states that it was the broken meat that the girl threw to the dogs, and that when they had eaten of this food, their\n\n[pg. 156 is missing]\n\n[157]\n\nthird with 7, and fourth with 1; that there is 1 in Norwegian, which has been collected in 3 different forms; that there is 1 in Romaic, with 9 versions; that there is 1 in Catalan, with 2 variant forms; that there is 1 in Italian, with 6 versions; that there is 1 in French, with 8 different forms; and that there is 1 in Finnish, 1 in Wendish, 1 in Dutch, and 1 in Faroese. An examination of all these forms of this ballad-them shows that here again, although the theme and situation are similar in many of the others, none of them by any means resemble Morris’s poem so closely in subject matter and form as one of the Swedish ones – namely, “Herr Malmstens drőm” in Geijer and Afzelius’s Svenska Folk-Visor. Besides, it is only in this version that the lover is given the name “Malmsten” and that the young man learns of the death of his sweetheart from a woman in blue and a woman in red.\n\nTo be sure, in this ballad also, Morris departs from his original in a number of cases. Thus, he completely omits the double refrain,\n\nSå lustelig locker man liljorna\n\nFőr älskogsfullt han sőrjde’na,\n\nand in several passages he renders the Swedish freely. For example, the exclamation\n\n“Gud nåde er, Herr Malmsten, hvad sorg I får,”\n\n[158]\n\nMorris turns into the question,\n\n“My lord Malmston, what aileth you?”\n\nFor the lines\n\nHerr Malmsten så hastigt af gångaren sprang;\n\nHan lyfte så lätt under bare-stång,\n\nMorris writes,\n\nHe let his horse loose hastily,\n\nAnd by the dead corpse quick stood he.\n\nThe Swedish says that the young man, on meeting the pier of his beloved, took off his six gold rings, and\n\nDet gav han åt den, som skulle grifta och ringa,\n\nbut Morris simply states that the youth pulled off the rings\n\nAnd gave them to the clerks to hold.\n\nIn none of these cases, however, is Morris following other versions of the ballad. Most likely it was simply his lack of complete familiarity with the Swedish that led him in these passages to reproduce the original incorrectly or with undue liberty. Perhaps, also, the exigencies of metre and rhyme were sometimes responsible.\n\nAll the ballad translations that Morris produced he apparently prepared by himself. The only external evidence bearing upon the\n\n[159]\n\nquestion of authorship that we have is the remark “translated from the Danish (by poor little me)” in the holograph manuscript of one of the copies of “Hafbur and Signy” and the statement at the end of the illuminated manuscript A Book of Verse to the effect that ‘I made the verses; but the 2 poems, the ‘Ballad of Christine’ and the ‘Son’s Sorrow,’ I translated out of the Icelandic.” That Morris should have been able in the early 1870’s to render Icelandic ballads into English unaided is of course not surprising, for his study of the sagas with Magnússon had undoubtedly made him by this time well acquainted with the Icelandic language, but that he should also have been capable of translating Danish folk songs by himself is rather unexpected. However, strange as it seems, we must, I believe, for various reasons that I shall present below, interpret these two statements literally, and also assume that Morris rendered not only these three ballads by himself but all ten that have come down to us. Evidently it was his intimate knowledge of Icelandic and the slight familiarity with German that he is known to have possessed that enabled him, with the aid of dictionaries, to read the Danish and Swedish although he had never made a formal study of these languages.\n\nMorris sometimes surprises us by the literalness of his ballad translations, even occasionally rendering correctly a difficult word or phrase which other translators of the ballad in question misunderstood; but, as I just stated, he apparently prepared his\n\n[160]\n\nrenderings by himself, for there is no reason to suspect that he received aid from anyone acquainted with the Scandinavian languages. In the first place, if the translations had been the result of collaboration, Morris would almost certainly have stated this fact when he published them; with only one exception, he acknowledged the assistance of Magnússon in every saga-rendering he printed. Secondly, if he had sought help in this work, it would most likely have been from Magnússon, who was acquainted with all the Scandinavian languages, but Dr. Einarsson in his recent biography of Magnússon says nothing of any collaboration by Morris and Magnússon on ballad translations, although he quotes and refers to a great many letter relating to their work together on the sagas. Thirdly, if he had received help from Magnússon, his renderings would have undoubtedly have been far more accurate than they are; very rare indeed are the errors in the saga-translations they produced together. It is thus almost certain that in turning these eight folk songs into English, he was not aided by Magnússon or by anyone else who was proficient in reading Danish and Swedish.\n\nThere is one other probability that must be considered: in rendering these Danish and Swedish ballads into English, Morris may\n\n[161]\n\nhave been aided by previous English, or even German and French, translations. However, it seems extremely unlikely that Morris went to the trouble of locating English, German, or French renderings of the folk songs he wished to turn into English and that he then followed these in reading the Danish and Swedish; such a procedure would be entirely inconsistent with what we know about Morris’s usual methods of work. Moreover, when we compare the previous English, German, and French translations with Morris’s versions, we find, as I shall show, not only that there is never the slightest verbal similarity between Morris’s work and that of his predecessors, but also that sometimes Morris correctly interprets a passage which was misunderstood by the others and that he occasionally mistranslates a phrase or word which is correctly rendered in all the other translations.\n\nThus, in “Agnes and the Hill-Man” Morris correctly renders the Danish “tøyse” as “twice,” but Prior, the only other translator of this particular version, interprets it as “thrice.” Later in the same ballad Morris renders the lines\n\n“Og naar du kommer paa Kirkegulv,\n\nsaa maa du ej gaa med din kjaer Moder I Stol”\n\nmuch more closely that Prior does, for Morris translates them as\n\n“So that when thou standest the church within\n\nTo thy mother on bench thou never win,”\n\nbut Prior says,\n\n[162]\n\n“And when thou kneelest at church to prayer\n\nApart from thy mother place the chair.”\n\nSimilarly, in “Hafbur and Signy” Morris’s version is in several cases more exact than the six previous translations that were based either on the text in Danske Viser or on the very similar text in Tragica. For example, in the account of Hafbur and Signy’s arrival in Signy’s chamber and their preparation for sleep, Morris renders correctly the lines which Danske Viser read,\n\nSaa tændte de op de voxlys,\n\nSaa herligt vare de snoed’,\n\nand in Tragica appear as,\n\nSaa tendte de op de voxxe Lius,\n\nSaa herlig vare de snaa,\n\nFor he says,\n\nThen kindled folk the waxlights\n\nThat were so closely twined;\n\nbut most of the other translators seem to have been troubled by the word “snoed” or “snaa” in the second of these lines. Thus the rendering of this ballad in Fraser’s Magazine departs entirely from the original at this point:\n\nHafbur and Signy took the light,\n\nAnd their room they lovingly sought.\n\n[163]\n\nGrimm, also, completely misunderstood the line:\n\nSie zeundeten de Wachslichter an, so freudig waren die zwel.\n\nIn his Old Danish Ballads in 1856, Prior, following Grimm’s translation, says,\n\nThe tapers all they lit so bright,\n\nGrew friendly more and more;\n\nand in 1860, in his Ancient Danish Ballads also, Prior seems to have relied on Grimm for this line, although he says that his rendering is based on the text of this ballad in Tragica, for here he translated the two lines thus:\n\nThe cheerful tapers there they lit,\n\nAnd were se well inclined.\n\nNarmier’s French version is likewise incorrect at this point: “Le flambeau de cire est allumé. Tous deux étaient bien joyeux.” The only other translator besides Morris to understand the word was Sander, who says,\n\nDas kunstgedrehte Licht von wachs,\n\nDas leuchtet ringsumher.\n\nA few stanzas later in the ballad we are told that when Hafbur and Signy were in bed together, Signy discovered the identity of Hafbur, who had come to her disguised as a maiden, and that she chid him for having thus deceived her and put her to shame. She asks,\n\n[164]\n\nin Danske Viser,\n\n“Hvi rider ej til min Faders saard\n\nMed Hund, og Høg paa Hænde?”\n\nand in Tragica,\n\n“Hvi rider I icke til min Faders Gaard\n\nMed Høg of Hund I hende?”\n\nThere is nothing difficult about these two lines, and Morris translates them correctly as\n\n“Why ridest thou not to my father’s garth\n\nWith hound, and with hawk upon glove?”\n\nMoreover, Grimm and Sander render them correctly in their German versions of this ballad, and Marmier, though not so exact, keeps the main idea of the original. Prior, however, departs from the Danish in the second line both in his Old Danish Ballads in 1856 and in his Ancient Danish Ballads in 1860:\n\n“Why ride not in with hawk and hound\n\nIn court my hand to claim.”\n\nThe third English translation follows the original more closely than Prior does, but is still not so exact as Morris:\n\n“With hawk and hound to my father’s hall,\n\nAh, if you only came!”\n\n[165]\n\nIn Morris’s rendering of the ballad “The Mother under the Mold” occurs another very striking example of his independence of previous translators. In this song we are told that one night a dead mother begged the Lord for permission to arise from her grave in order to visit her children, who were being maltreated by their stepmother; the Lord yielded to her entreaties, whereupon,\n\nHun skjød op sine modige Ben,\n\nDer revnede Mur og Marmorsten.\n\nThe Danish word “Ben” can of course mean either “bone” or “leg”; in this passage it almost certainly is used in the sense of “legs.” However, Morris is the only English translator to give it this interpretation:\n\nThen forth her weary feet put she.\n\nThe rendering in the London Magazine reads,\n\nThen up she raised her weary bones;\n\nRobert Jamieson gives the translation\n\nWith her banes sae stark a bowt she gae;\n\nFraser’s Magazine has\n\nShe lifted up her weary bones;\n\n[166]\n\nPrior in his Ancient Danish Ballads renders the line as\n\nOut from the chest she stretch’d her bones;\n\nand Longfellow, presenting this ballad as the Musician’s third story in his Tales of a Wayside Inn, gives the translation\n\nShe girded up her sorrowful bones.\n\nIn his Old Danish Ballads Prior translates the passage very loosely, omitting the word entirely:\n\nIn coffin then no longer pent\n\nHer corpse its marble tombstone rent.\n\nThree of the German renderings use the collective noun “Gebein,” which of course cannot refer to “legs.” besides Morris, Grimm and Marmier are the only translators who definitely give the word the meaning “legs”: “Da hob sie auf ihre můden Bein,” and “Elle se lève sur ses jambs fatigues.”\n\nFinally, I should like to point out that in his rendering of “Hafbur and Signy” Morris includes the refrain, as do Grimm and Sander, but that all the three other English translators, as well as Marmier, omit it.\n\nThat Morris was not dependent upon the work of his predecessors is indicated not only by passages, like those just cited, in which his renderings are more exact than the previous translations, but also by cases in which Morris mistranslates the original and all\n\n[167]\n\nthe other renderings are correct. I should now like to give a few examples of such mistakes by Morris.\n\nThus, in “Agnes and the Hill-Man,” when Agnes has escaped from the mountain and the Hill-man tries to induce her to return by telling her that her children are crying for her, Morris completely misunderstands Agnes’s exclamation\n\n“Lad dem græd’, lad dem gra͜ed’, lad dem græd’, med de vil:\n\njeg n ej mere hører dem til,”\n\nand writes,\n\n“Let them greet, let them greet, as they have will to do;\n\nFor never again will I hearken thereto!”\n\nPrior, the only other translator of this Danish ballad, is much more exact though not absolutely literal:\n\n“The children may wail, as they will, and cry,\n\nwith them nothing more to do have I,”\n\nIn his “Knight Aagen and Maiden Else” Morris likewise makes two mistakes which are not found in the other renderings of this folk song; these errors, however, seem to be the result of carelessness, rather than of a failure to understand the Danish. Thus he incorrectly translates stanza three,\n\nDet var Jomfru elselille,\n\nHun var saa sorrifuld;\n\nDet hørte Ridder Herr Aage\n\nHen under sorten Muld,\n\n[168]\n\nas\n\nIt was the maiden Else,\n\nShe was fulfilled of woe\n\nWhen she heard how the fair knight Aagen\n\nIn the black mould lay alow.\n\nAll the seven earlier renderings, however, state correctly that it was Aage who heard Else crying, not that Else wept because she learned that Aage was in his grave. Later in the same ballad we are told that Aage arose from his grave one night in order to go and comfort Else, and that after she had welcomed him into her chamber, she took her comb and smoothed his hair:\n\nSaa tog hun den guldkam\n\nSaa kjæmte hun hans Haar.\n\nMorris, however, says,\n\nO, she’s taken up her comb of gold\n\nAnd combed adown her hair.\n\nHere again all the other translations are correct.\n\nSimilarly, in his “Hafbur and Signy” Morris makes a very serious mistake, failing to understand the old Danish word “axle,” meaning “to put on”; thus he misinterprets the lines\n\n[169]\n\nMidt udi den Borgegaard\n\nDer axler han sit Skind.\n\nas\n\nNow out amid the castle-garth\n\nhe cast his cloak aside.\n\nAll the other translators render it in the right way.\n\nFinally, I should like to point out that one of the mistakes I discussed above in Morris’s rendering of the Swedish ballad “Den Lillas Testamente” – namely, his translation\n\nThe flesh fell from them that they died\n\nfor\n\nRemna I femton stycken,\n\nis not found in Marmier’s rendering, the only other version based on the same text, for Marmier says, “Leur corps s’est brisé en morceaux”; similarly, the errors I noted above in Morris’s translation of the other Swedish ballad are not in the other renderings of this song.\n\nIt is not necessary to cite further examples of this type. The ones I have already pointed out, like the specimens of previously quoted cases in which Morris gives correct renderings but the earlier translators misunderstand the original, show clearly that\n\n[170]\n\nthere is not the slightest reason for believing that Morris was guided in any way by the work of his predecessors. Moreover, it should be noted that the mistranslations which were made by Morris but not by the others indicate not only that Morris was not following other renderings but also that he could not have collaborated with Magnússon or with anyone else who was thoroughly familiar with Danish and Swedish.\n\nIn order to make this last point clearer – namely, that the lack of accuracy in Morris’s translations tends to prove that he could not have prepared them with the aid of some friend who was well versed in the Scandinavian languages. I should like to show that Morris’s mistakes are by no means rare by briefly calling attention to a few more cases in which he failed to understand his original. So far I have mentioned only those passages which Morris renders incorrectly but others translate in the right way, but there are of course words and expressions which not only Morris but others failed to comprehend.\n\nThus in “Hildebrand and Hellelil,” he misunderstands the line\n\n“Min Fader lod mig saa haederlig somme,”\n\nrendering it rather absurdly as\n\n“He taught me sewing royally.”\n\nMoreover he seems to have been unfamiliar with the word “svige,”\n\n[171]\n\nmeaning “to deceive,” for in “Hafbur and Signy” he mistranslates the line\n\nKong Sivards Datter at svige\n\nas\n\nKing Siward’s daughter to woo.\n\nHe fails to understand the line\n\nDer Dug drew over de Spange,\n\nand renders it incorrectly as\n\nO’er the meads the dew drave down.\n\nHe confuses the word “stodte” with “stod,” ad thinks that the lines\n\nDe stødte paa Døren\n\nMed Glavind og med Spyd\n\nmean\n\nSo there anigh the high-bower door\n\nThey stood with spear and glaive.\n\nLike all but three of the other ten translators of “The Mother under the Mold,” he misinterprets “udi Sky” as “under the sky”; the phrase means, of course, “in terror.” For the Danish\n\n[172]\n\nDe Hunde de tuded saa højt udi Sky,\n\nhe says,\n\nUnder the sky the hounds they bayed.\n\nThus, as I have already stated, there is absolutely no reason to believe either that Morris relied on previous translations in preparing his ballad renderings or that he had the aid of anyone acquainted with the Scandinavian languages.\n\nFinally, before closing my discussion of Morris’s ballad translations, I should like to point out that in spite of occasional errors, the renderings are on the whole very pleasing and highly successful. Morris always took pains to imitate the form of the originals as closely as possible; and as far as his knowledge of Icelandic, Danish, and Swedish permitted him to do so, he reproduced faithfully the substance of his texts. For example, he always retained the metre and rhyme scheme found in the originals, and often, though of course by no means always, imitated their metrical irregularities. Moreover, unlike many of the previous translators, he as a rule kept the refrain, which is such an integral part of the Scandinavian folk songs; in only one ballad rendering – that of “Herr Malmstems drőm” – did he omit the refrain. It should also be noted that he frequently introduced feminine rhymes, in this way reproducing the melodious quality of the original ballad poetry; in “Agnes and the Hill-Man,” for example, Morris’s first and fifth stanzas run thus:\n\nAgnes went through the meadows a-weeping,\n\nFowl are a-singing.\n\nThere stood the hill-man heed thereof keeping.\n\nAgnes, fair Agnes!\n\n[173]\n\nThere she sat, and lullaby sang in her singing,\n\nFowl are a-singing.\n\nAnd she heard how the bells of England were ringing.\n\nAgnes, fair Agnes!\n\nEqually striking is his insistence on reproducing, as far as his knowledge of Icelandic, Danish, and Swedish and the demands of metre and rhyme allowed him to do so, exactly what is given in his originals, and nothing more. Never was Morris guilty of trying to improve his texts. In only one or two cases did he add a single image or descriptive detail of his own, although many of his predecessors enlarged upon the originals when the expressions in the ballads were bald or crude. One or two examples of Morris’s close adherence to his sources will suffice. Thus the opening stanza in “Hildebrand and Hellelil,”\n\nHellelil sidder I Bure –\n\nMin Sorrig veed ingen uden gud.\n\nHun syer sin Søm saa prude.\n\nOg den lever aldrig, jeg vil for klage min Sorrig,\n\nMorris renders faithfully as\n\nHellelil sitteth in bower there,\n\nNone knows my grief but God alone,\n\nAnd seweth at the seam so fair,\n\nI never wail my sorrow to any other one;\n\nbut Robert Buchanan in his Ballad Stories of the Affections translates this stanza very freely:\n\nHelga sits at her chamber door –\n\nGod only my heart from sorrow can sever!\n\nShe seweth the same seam o’er and o’er.\n\nLet me tell of the sorrow that lives for ever!\n\nAnd a rendering of this ballad in Fraser’s Magazine for January, 1865, departs even further from the original:\n\n[174]\n\nShe sat in her bower, with eyes of flame,\n\n(My sorrow is known to God alone.)\n\nBending over the broidery frame,\n\n(And oh there liveth none to whom my sorrow may be told)\n\nLater in the same ballad Morris translates the lines\n\n“Aldrig var det saa dyb en Dam,\n\nMin Broders Hest jo over svam.”\n\nas\n\n“No deepest dam we came unto\n\nBut my brother’s horse he swam it through”;\n\nbut Robert Buchanan and the translator in Fraser’s Magazine take great liberties with the text, for one says,\n\n“Through deep fords the horse can swim;\n\nHe drags me choking after him,”\n\nand the other relates that\n\n“The deep ice-rivers were red with gore,\n\nAs over them we and the wild horse tore.”\n\nFinally, at the opening of “Knight Aagen and Maiden Else,” in a stanza already commented upon in another connection, the original says,\n\nDet var Jomfru Elselille,\n\nHun var saa sorrigfuld,\n\nand Morris translates\n\nIt was the Maiden Else\n\nShe was fulfilled of woe;\n\nbut George Borrow in his Romantic Ballads states,\n\nIn her bower sat Eliza;\n\nRent the air with shriek and groan.\n\n[175]\n\nMorris’s ballad renderings make it clear that he keenly appreciated the quiet beauty, simplicity, pathos, and reticence of the Scandinavian folk songs. This understanding of the art of the ballads together with his inherent ability as a poet enabled him to produce translations which are remarkably close in spirit and tone to the originals and which at the same time possess real poetic value of their own.\n\nDuring the period 1871 to 1876, which we are now considering, Morris prepared not only the ballad renderings just discussed by also a great number of saga translations. Very few of these renderings, however, were ever published at this time. In 1871, in the March and April issues of the Dark Blue, he presented to the public an English version of the Friðpjófs saga hins fra͜ekna; in 1875 he republished this saga, together with five other short Old Norse tales, in a volume called Three Northern Love Stories, and other Tales. These are the only saga translations that he printed from 1871 to 1876, - in fact, from 1871 to 1891.\n\nIn his “Story of Frithiof the Bold” Morris followed the longer and better known of the two recensions of the saga. He does not state on which edition of this form of the tale he based his rendering, but very likely he used the first of the two texts in volume II of Fornaldar Sőgur Nordrlanda; this volume, as I have already\n\n[176]\n\npointed out, was in his library at his death.\n\nWhen Morris printed this translation in the Dark Blue, he presented it as entirely his own work; but when he republished it with only a few changes together with five other sagas in Three Northern Love Stories, he stated on the title page that the renderings in this volume were the result of collaboration between Magnússon and himself, and made no special comment on the authorship of the translation of the Friðpjófs saga. It is not known whether the rendering was originally produced by Morris alone and was later revised by Magnússon when it was republished in 1875, or whether the earlier translation also was the work of both men and the absence of Magnússon’s name in the Dark Blue is entirely without significance. That Morris received aid from Magnússon in preparing the first version as well as the second seems, on the whole, very likely, for when we compare this translation with the Old Norse, we find that it is remarkably close and exact. Very few alterations, as I just stated, were made when the story was printed again in 1875, and in only three cases were actual mistranslations corrected; most of the changes simply introduce archaic words of forms, or\n\n[177]\n\noffer slightly more exact renderings. It seems extremely improbable that Morris could have produces this very literal translation entirely unaided in 1871. Very likely Magnússon prepared the first draft as usual and Morris afterwards wrote out his own rendering on the basis of Magnússon’s version, making a few minor errors which Magnússon may never have had a chance to correct or which he overlooked if he actually did revise the work.\n\nAs in the case of the ballad translations, there is of course a possibility that Morris produced this rendering without Magnússon’s aid but was guided by some previous translation. The Friðpjófs saga had already been turned into English by George Stephens, his rendering of the saga appearing in 1839 in the same volume as his English version of Bishop Tegnér’s poetical version of the tale. We know that Morris was familiar with this work for H. Buxton Forman, speaking of another matter in his Books of William Morris, refers to a letter he received from Morris in the winter of 1873 \"returning a copy of George Stevenson’s Frithiof which I had borrowed for him….” Morris may easily have seen\n\n[178]\n\nthis book as early as 1871. However, a comparison of Morris’s translation with Stephens’s shows that Morris was almost certainly not dependent upon the work of his predecessor in any way. In the first place, Stephens’s rendering, as he himself states, is based mainly on the text in Bjorner’s Nordiska Kämpa Dater, which, as I have already said, differs in many cases from the text Morris used. Furthermore – and this fact is much more important – several passages which are the same in the Kämpa Dater and in the Fornaldar Sőgur are given entirely different interpretation by Morris and Stephens, sometimes Morris, sometimes Stephens, being the more exact. Finally, I should like to point out that none of the mistranslations which occur in Morris’s version in the Dark Blue but were corrected in the Three Northern Love Stories are found in Stephens’s rendering, or, as a matter of fact, in any of the Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and German translations.\n\n[179]\n\nVery likely Morris did not borrow Stephen’s book because he wanted to use it as a guide in his rendering of the Icelandic saga, but because he wished to become acquainted with Tegnér’s poem on the same subject. We know that Morris was familiar with this work, for in a note at the opening of his translation of the Friðpjófs saga in the Dark Blue he says, “This tale is the original of the Swedish Bishop Tegnér’s ‘Frithiof Saga,’ a long modern poem, which has a great reputation, but bears little enough relation, either in spirit or matter, to its prototype.” It is almost certain that Morris was not so proficient in Swedish that he could read this long narrative poem in the original; there were of course many English renderings of the work available at this time, but inasmuch as we know that he borrowed Stephens’s translation in the early seventies, it is fairly safe to assume that it was on the basis of this rendering that he formed the opinion expressed in this note.\n\nAlthough no saga translations were published from the spring of 1871 to 1875, we know that Morris was extremely active during these years in turning Icelandic sagas into English. Almost all our information regarding this work, except for a few references in letters, comes from the illuminated manuscripts he used to produce recreation at this time. I have already on several occasions referred to Morris’s activity as an illuminator. As I have stated before, he began this work as early as 1856, but did not complete any painted book until 1870; from that year until 1875 or\n\n[180]\n\n1876, however, he spent all his leisure time in writing out and decorating manuscripts, and produced during these years an astonishingly large number of such books. Many of them are copies of sagas he had rendered out of the Icelandic.\n\nOn the basis of one of these manuscripts we know that by the end of 1871 Morris had translated the Kormáks saga Øgmundssonar and had begun his English version of the Heimskringla. This manuscript, which is now in the private library of Sir Sydney Cockerell of Cambridge, England, and which I have had the privilege of examining, contains, in translation, the whole of the Kormáks saga, one page from the opening of the Heimskringla, eighteen stanzas of “Hafbur and Signy,” and two pages of the Friðpjófs saga; according to a note by Sir Sydney Cockerell at the beginning of the book, the “paper on which everything in this volume is written bears a watermark dated 1870 and the date of the skript[sic] is not later than 1871.” The last two selections in this book are not important\n\n[181]\n\nfor the purposes of this study, for we know from other sources that Morris had translated “Hafbur og Signy” and the Friðpjófs saga by the end of 1871 and both renderings in their entirety have been published; the first two selections, however, are of special interest.\n\nMorris’s translation of the Kormáks saga was never printed; in fact, it is only through this illuminated manuscript and a few waste leaves that we know that he prepared a rendering of this tale. The basis for his version must have been the Kormaks saga sive Kormaki OEgmundi dilii vita, published in Copenhagen in 1832, for this was the only text printed at this time. His translation covers the whole of the saga, but does not include any of the “Fragmenta carminum” found at the end of this edition. I have compared the rendering with the original, and find that it is accurate and similar in style to Morris’s other saga translations.\n\n[182]\n\nIt is likewise very interesting to learn that Morris had begun his rendering of the Heimskringla as early as 1871, as the illuminated page of the opening of the Yngling saga included in Cockerell’s manuscript indicates. This very lengthy work, which he was not to complete until more than twenty-five years later, seems to have occupied his attention throughout this period; in a letter dated February 11, 1873, he writes, “My translations go on apace, but I am doing nothing original….I certainly enjoy some of the work I do very much, and one of these days my Heimskringla will be an important work.” Other illuminated fragments of the Heimskringla rendering also exist. In the private library of the late Sir Emery Walker of Hammersmith, London, there is an illuminated manuscript which contains various short selections, among them nineteen pages of the opening of the Heimskringla, covering “The Preface of Snorri Sturluson” and almost twenty-five chapters of the Ynglinga saga; those pages that bear a watermark are dated 1870, and the script is similar to that in Cockerell’s manuscript, so that very likely these leaves also were written out in 1871. At the time of her death Miss May Morris had in her posses-\n\n[183]\n\nsion two vellum leaves which bear no title but contain part of Chapter XXI, the whole of Chapter XXII, and the opening of Chapter XXIII of Morris’s translation of the Haralds saga hárfagra. There is writing on both sides of the pages, and the leaves are numbered 35, 36, 37, and 38; evidently they were originally part of an illuminated manuscript of the whole of the Haralds saga hárfragra. The script used here is larger than in the other two Heimskringla manuscripts, and is somewhat different in character; probably these leaves were prepared at a later date.\n\nAlthough his work on the Heimskringla must have occupied much\n\n[184]\n\nof his attention during the years 1871 to 1872, he nevertheless found time for several other saga-renderings. We learn from a letter written December 8, 1873 that by that time he had read the Viglundar saga, the Heðins saga ok Hőgna, the Hróa páttr heimska, and the porsteins páttr stangarhőggs; in the letter, just mentioned, Morris describes the material he intended to include in the volume of translations which he was then planning to publish but which did not appear until 1875 under the title Three Northern Love Stories, and says,\n\nIt [the book] stands thus now as I intended at first: the Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-tongue, printed in the Fortnightly some years back; the Story of Frithiof the Bold, printed before in the Dark Blue; the story of Viglund the Fair, never before printed: these ‘three Northern Love Stories’ will give the name to the book, but to thicken it out I add three more short tales; Hrol the Fool, Hogni and Hedin, and Thorstein Staff-smitten; the first of these three a pretty edition of a ‘sharper’ story and the same as a tale in the Arabian Nights. The second a terrible story; a very well told, but late version of a dark and strange legend of remote times. The third simple, and not without generosity, smelling strong of the soil of Iceland, like the Gunnlaug.\n\nMoreover, an illuminated manuscript shows us that three months later – namely, by the end of February, 1874 – he had translated three more fairly long sagas, - the Hænsa-póris saga, the Sandamanna saga, and the Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings. His rendering of these three tales is written out and decorated in a very beautiful script of 224 pages, which is now in the Fitzilliam Museum, Cambrdige, England; Morris did not date the work, but a note at the end, evidently in the hand of Sir Sydney Cockerell, points out a “letter to Mr. C. Fairfax Murray shows that this book was finished in February 1874.” The sheets that are watermarked all bear the\n\n[185]\n\ndate 1870. None of these translations were published until 1891, when all three appeared in the first volume of The Saga Library.\n\nThe last of these three tales, the Hávarðar saga, it should\n\n[186]\n\nbe noted, was one of the Scandinavian works which Magnússon and G. E. J. Powell had intended to publish in an English form before Magnússon began collaborating with Morris. As I have already pointed out, Magnússon wrote out a renderings of this tale and handed it over to Powell for revision in 1863, but the latter never completed his share of the work so that it could be printed; even as late as 1869 and 1870 references in letters show that they were still planning to publish it. Probably Magnússon by that time realized that it was useless to wait longer for Powell, and so put his literal translation in the hands of Morris.\n\nThe story of Haward became one of Morris’s favorites among the shorter Icelandic tales; he once wrote to Theodore Watts-Dunton, in a letter which evidently accompanied a presentation copy of Volume One of the The Saga Library, “Seriously I hope you will like it. The Howard Saga, I think the best short saga after G… and the other 2 are very good.” In the Fitzwilliam Museum illuminated manuscript of “The Story of Hen Thorir,” “The Story of the Banded-Men,” and “The Story of Haward the Halt,” we find at the end “A gloss in rhyme on the story of Haward, by William Morris.” In this gloss, which consists of fifty-eight lines in heroic couplets, Morris briefly retells the main events of the tale; the comments that he makes on the characters and their deeds in the course of this poetical summary show that he was deeply moved by this old story of wrong made\n\n[187]\n\nright even in the face of overwhelming odds, and reveal that he sincerely sympathized with old Haward in his troubles and weakness. Note, for example, the following passage towards the end, in which he compares the change in Haward’s fortunes to a beautiful dream:\n\nA dream methinks all this by someone told,\n\nOf many griefs in all defeat grown old;\n\nA dream of lying down unloved, alone,\n\nFeeble, unbeauteous, but by mocking known,\n\nAnd waking up a famous man and fair,\n\nWell-loved, most mighty, bold all deeds to dare;\n\nHappy to bring the hardest thing to pass;\n\nNought left save longing of the wretch one was:\n\nOf lying down most loth to wake again,\n\nAnd waking up to wonder what was pain –\n\nA dream of wrong in one night swept away\n\nAnd Baldur’s kingdom come with break of day.\n\nAnother Icelandic work which Morris seems to have translated by the end of 1874 is the Haldórs páttr Snorrasonar. Three pages of an illuminated manuscript of his rendering of this story, called by him “The Tale of Haldor,” are now in the private library of Sir Sydney Cockerell; as is pointed out in a note on the inside of the front cover of the book in which these pages are bound, this selection is written out in the same script as that used in the Fitzwilliam Museum manuscript just discussed. There are two “pættir” concerning this Haldor, one dealing with Haldo and Einar pambarskelfir, the other with Haldor and King Harald Harðráði; it is the first of these that Morris translated. He wrote out only about forty lines\n\n[188]\n\nin the illuminated manuscript, and so it is difficult to determine which text of this “páttr” he was following in his rendering; however, even this short passage shows that he certainly did not use the version in Volume III of the Flateyjarbók and that very likely he did not base his English version on the text in the Saga Ólafs Tryggvasonar published in 1689, but it does not indicate whether he followed the version in Volume III of Fornmanna Sőgur or that in Volume I of Flateyjarbók. All these books, it should be noted, were in his library at his death. This translation was never published and is not mentioned in any of the studies of Morris. I should also like to point out that Morris’s knowledge of Old Norse literature must have been very extensive, since he read and translated such minor and very slightly known tales as this one and the last three included in Three Northern Love Stories; probably he read this account of Haldor because this man was the son of Snorri the Priest, with whom Morris had become acquainted in the Eyrbyggja saga at an early date.\n\nAnother illuminated manuscript which was likewise probably produced in the early 1870’s contains about one-fourth of Morris’s rendering of the Vápnfirðinga saga. This translation, like that of the\n\n[189]\n\nHalldórs páttr, was never published, and is not mentioned in any of the Morris studies. The manuscript is now in the private library of the late Sir Emery Walker of Hammersmith, England. The rendering, as usual, is very literal, with an archaic coloring. Evidently the translation was based on the text in Nordiske Oldskrifter, the only version printed at that time. The Porsteins páttr stangarhőgga, which we have already seem that Morris had read by the end of 1873, is a continuation of this saga; very likely he had translated the saga proper also by that time.\n\nFinally, I should like to point out that three other saga translations that we know Morris prepared – namely, his renderings of the Heiðarvíga saga, of the Egils saga Skallagrímssonar, and of the Norna-Gests páttr – may have been produced during the period 1871 to 1876. The first of these works was not published by Morris until 1892, when it appeared in the second volume of The Saga Library. The other two Morris himself never printed, but manu-\n\n[190]\n\nscripts of parts of both these translations are extant, and one of these manuscript renderings, comprising forty chapters of the Egils saga, Miss Morris published in 1936 in her William Morris: Artist Writer Socialist. All of these translations are undated, but, as I stated above, there is reason to believe that they were prepared in the early 1870’s. In the first place, various allusions to Norse customs that Morris introduced in his poem “Anthony,” which, as I shall show later, he seems to have written shortly after 1870, indicate, though they by no means definitely prove, that he was familiar at that time with the Heiðarvíga saga and the Egils saga. Moreover, as I shall make clear in Chapter IV, the verse form Morris uses for his English versions of the “vísur” in The Story of the Heath-Slayings points to its being an early work. Finally, it should be noted that, as we shall see in the next chapter, Morris did no translation work from the late 1870’s until\n\n[191]\n\n1890, and when he resumed his translating at that time, he seems to have devoted all his attention to finishing or revising renderings he had begun in the 1870’s; with the exception of The Story of the Heath-Slayings, all the translations he printed in The Saga Library are works we definitely know he had prepared or at least begun in the period 1868 to 1876. None of this evidence is of course conclusive, but it all indicates that these saga-renderings were produced in the period now under discussion.\n\n[192]\n\nAlthough Morris translated so many sagas in the early 1870’s, he published only one small volume of Icelandic tales during these years; this was Three Northern Love Stories, and other Tales, which appeared in June, 1875. The first two sagas which he included here, “The Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-Toungue and Raven the Skald” and “The Story of Frithiof the Bold,” he had already printed in periodicals, as I have pointed out before; both these tales he and Magnússon now carefully revised before republishing them in book form. I have already commented in detail upon these two translations. The third tale of love is “The Story of Viglund the Fair,” a rendering of the Víglundar saga, a late fictitious narrative. Morris almost certainly based his translation of this work on the text in Nordiska Oldskrifter. However, the melody which he introduced in Chapter Eleven for the song that Ketilrid sings when she thinks that Viglund has drowned is not found in this edition or in the only other text available in 1873; this tune he evidently inserted because, as he notes in his Journal of his first visit to Iceland in 1871, he had heard it played on an Icelandic violin at one of the farms at which\n\n[193]\n\nhe stayed on this trip. These three tales of love, “The Story of Gunnlaug,” “The Story of Frithiof,” and “The Story of Viglund,” make up more than three-fourths of the book; the remainder consists of three very short tales or “pættir.” “The Tale of Hogni and Hedinn” is a translation of Sőrla páttir, or Heðins saga ok Hőgna; Morris seems to have used the text given in Fornaldar Sőgur Nordrlanda. “The tale of Roi the Fool” is an English rendering of Hróa páttr heimska; the two texts of this story existing in 1873, one of which is found in Fornmanna Sőgur and the other in the Flateyjarbók, differ so very slightly that it is impossible to determine with certainty which one served as the basis of Morris’s work, but it seems that he followed the former. The last story is “The Tale of Thorstein Staff-Smitten,” a translation of porsteins páttr stanagarhőggs, which is a continuation of the vápnfirðinga saga; the text given in Nordiske Oldskrifter of this “páttr” was the only\n\n[194]\n\none published by 1873. In the case of the last four sagas, Morris’s renderings are the only English versions ever printed.\n\nAt the beginning of this collection of six short Icelandic tales we find a very brief Preface with comments on the general nature of each story, and also a chronological table of the main events in “The Story of Gunnlaug.” At the close of the book are two notes; in one of them Morris presents a two-page translation of the story of Hogni and Hedinn as it appears in Chapter L of the “Skáldskaparmál,” thus giving his readers an opportunity to compare this short account with the much more detailed version given in the Sőrla páttr, which he had translated in the text. There are also at the end two indexes of characters and places mentioned in these six sagas.\n\nThe book met with almost unqualified approval in the contemporary reviews. All the critics were loud in their praises of the accuracy and general style of the rendering, and freely recommended the volume to their readers. As was to be expected, most of the reviewers, recognizing the superior merits of “The Story of Gunnlaug,” placed this tale far above any of the other sagas in the book, and hailed it as one of the treasures of the world’s literature. One critic even devoted his whole article to this saga, merely mentioning the names of the other five tales. Edmund Gosse, whose review is by far\n\n[195]\n\nthe most scholarly and acute, says of this story,\n\n…it claims admiration for a rounded and finished form, a passionate perfection of style, a fullness of detail without an iota of triviality or thinness, which distinguish it above all its fellows. Without the grandeur of “Njála,” the romantic verve of “Grettis,” the fullness of humanity of that “Laxdaela” which we can only hope Mr. Morris may yet find time to render for us, the “Gunnlaug” has a concise picturesqueness, a purely artistic perfection, which place it at least as high as these, perhaps higher.\n\n“The Story of Frithiof” also was warmly praised, but “The Story of Viglund” was generally described as being distinctly inferior to the first two “love stories.” Mr. Gosse even went so far as to say, “With all deference to Mr. Magnússon’s learning and Mr. Morris’s taste, we feel doubtful whether they were justified in occupying so much time and space with a saga so late and so poor as this.” However, both Gosse and one of the other critics took pains to point out that the songs in this story were particularly beautiful; Gosse wrote, “The ‘Viglundarsaga’ is understood to be inelegant and unclassical in language….The best parts of the work are the passages in verse, which bear marks of an earlier and a far more gifted hand….We would take this opportunity of pointing out how especially beautiful are Mr. Morris’s versions of these short poems.” The other three tales in the book were dismissed by the reviewers with only a few words. It is of course not surprising that this collection of stories, unlike the other two saga translations that Morris and Magnússon had published in book form, was highly praised by the critics, for these six short tales, especially the first three, in view of the fact that the characters and action portrayed in them were much\n\n[196]\n\ncloser to modern life, were much more easily understood by the nineteenth century Englishman than the Vőlsunga saga or the Grettis saga.\n\nDuring the period of Morris’s life which we are now considering, when Morris was devoting himself almost entirely to Scandinavian studies, he became so intensely interested in Iceland and its literature that he determined to make a tour of the country even though he realized that such a trip would be accompanied by severe hardships and real dangers. Early in July, 1871, Morris left England for Iceland in the company of Eiríkr Magnússon, C.J. Faulkner, and W.H. Evans. The party first sighted land at Berufjőrðr in the southeast, and then sailed along the southern coast to Reykjavík. After spending a few days in the capital city, they set out to the southeast for the purpose of visiting Bergthorsknoll and Lithend; then they headed north proceeded through wild, rugged territory up to the northern coast; at Hnausar they turned south, riding back to Reykjavík along the western shore of Iceland, through the district richest in saga-associations. Morris and his friends returned to England early in September.\n\nEven this extended trip, however, did not completely satisfy Morris’s longing for the land which was the main scene of the sagas he loved so well, and he soon began planning for a second visit. Two years later, in February, 1873, he wrote to a friend, “Iceland gapes for me still this summer: I grudge very much being away from the two or three people I care for so long as I must be, but if I\n\n[197]\n\ncan only get away in some sort of hope and heart I know it will be the making of me….” In July of that year he set sail again for Iceland, accompanied this time only by C.J. Faulkner. Morris and his friend landed at Reykjavík, made a brief visit again to Njál district, and then set off in a northeasterly direction through the heart of Iceland; at Dettifoss, far up in the northeastern corner of the island, they turned west, and when they reached the Blandá they began travelling south, passing between Longjőkull and Arnarfellsjőkull on their way back to Reykjavík. On this second journey they visited very few saga-steads, most of their time being spent in wild, uninhabited country. They returned to England early in September.\n\nDuring both his trips Morris kept a diary. The first one he rewrote when he came home, turning it into a finished, literary account of his experiences and impressions; the second diary he never revised. Neither the journal of the first journey nor the diary of the second was published during Morris’s lifetime, but they were both printed by Miss May Morris in 1911 in Volume VIII of the Collected Works. Both accounts- but particularly the first one- are very well written and are extremely interesting; they have a special importance for the present study because of the light they throw on the extent of Morris’s acquaintance with saga-traditions at this time.\n\n[198]\n\nThus, very frequently in his description of the places that he and his friends visited, Morris shows in a striking manner that he knew the sagas very thoroughly and that he clearly remembered incidents and even details mentioned in these narratives. For example, when he is writing of their journey in the northeastern part of Iceland near Midfirth and is telling of their approach to Midfirth Neck, he notes, “Just as we turn out of the valley on to the neck, we come on a knoll, the site of Swala-stead, where Vali of the Bandamanna Saga was murdered….” A few pages later, when he is describing the district around Ramfirth, he refers to Thorodd-stead as “the dwelling-place and death-place of Thorbiorn Oxmain, who slew Atli Grettir’s brother and was slain by Grettir in his turn.” In his account of their ride past the head of Swanfirth, he says, “ …we rode down the other side of the firth till we came to Vadil’s-head where Arnkel the Priest, the good man of Erybyggia, is buried; … down here also Thorolf Lamefoot, Arnkel’s father was burned and so partly got rid of.” Of Swordfirth he writes,\n\nThen we all rode away together passing by a little creek that Thorlacius pointed out to us as Sword-firth (Vigrafiőrðr) the scene of that ueer fight in Erybyggia where Freystein Rascal is killed, and often mentioned in that Saga: I remembered what a much bigger place I had always thought of for that place, where the very skerry in the middle is named after the fight, and called Fight-skerry.\n\n[199]\n\nHe even remembers the family relationship of various characters: he refers in one passage to Áseirgsá as “the home of Ásgeir Madpate, father of Hrefna and uncle of Grettir’s father,” and in his account of Burgfirth he reminds his readers that “Egil lived at Borg, and his son Thorstein, father of Helga the Fair….”\n\nMoreover, he not only reveals an intimate familiarity with the more famous sagas, which we already know that he had read, but he also shows that he was acquainted with some of the less important tales, which we should hardly expect him to have studied. Thus, when he and his friends are travelling in the northwestern part of Iceland, on their way from Grímstunga to Hnausar, Morris writes,\n\nThe hero and “landnáms-man” of the vale is Ingimund the Old and most of the steads Thorstein shows us have reference to him; at the first we come to Ás[where] lived Hrolleifr, the rascal he protected, and who slew him; … Thorstein points out a sandy spit running into the river which is the traditional place of the deadly wounding of Ingimund….\n\nAs Miss Morris points out in a footnote, these incidents are described in the Vatnsdæla saga. It is still more surprising to discover a few pages later that he is familiar with the Finnboga saga ramma: he describes Borg as “the place of the Saga of Finnbogi the Strong; in its present condition rather a poor characterless story; but with one touching part in it where the wife of Finnbogi dies of grief for the slaying of her favourite son by a scoundrel.”\n\nUndoubtedly the two tours increased Morris’s knowledge of the\n\n[200]\n\nsaga-traditions considerably. On several occasions we are told that the guides supplemented the stories in the sagas by local traditions. For example, in describing Swala-stead, to which I have already referred, Morris says, “Víðalin told us of it that many stories were current of it and of Swala’s witchcraft, and repeated a rhyme that says how the day will come when the big house of Swala-stead shall be lower than the cot of Víðidalstongue.” A few pages later he says that when they were riding at the head of Hvammfirth, an old parson at whose home they had made a brief stop pointed out the places of interest in that locality:\n\nThen we went out and he showed us above the house Auð’s thing-stead and doom-ring, and close by the temple of those days; though Auð herself was a Christian, and would have herself buried on the foreshore between high and low watermark, that she might not lie wholly in a heathen land: they show you a big stone on the beach that they call her gravestone: but ‘tis covered now by the tide.\n\nMoreover, in many cases Morris’s visits to the scenes of the sagas seem to have changed his conception of tales he already knew and to have helped him to understand the characters and their actions more fully. Thus, when he is describing the horrible aspect of the mountains as they are passing Skialdbreið on their outward journey in 1871, he writes that “…just over this gap is the site of the fabulous or doubtful Thorisdale of the Grettis-Saga; and certainly the\n\n[201]\n\nsight of it threw a new light on the way in which the story-teller meant his tale to be looked on.” Much later in the Journal he says of Fagraskógarfiall, one of the haunts of Grettir, in the Mires, “It is as such a savage dreadful place, that it gave quite a new turn in my mind to the whole story, and transfigured Grettir into an awful and monstrous being, like one of the early giants of the world.”\n\nIt is clear from remarks that Morris made in the accounts of both trips that he was deeply moved by his visits to the scenes of the sagas. As he describes the approach to Thingvellis he writes, “My heart beats, so please you, as we near the brow of the pass, and all the infinite wonder, which came upon me when I came up on the Neck of the Diana to see Iceland for the first time, comes on me again now, for this is the heart of Iceland that we are going to see nor was the reality of the sight unworthy….” A few lines later, as he draws closer to the place, he remarks, “Once again that thin thread of insight and imagination, which comes so seldom to us, and is such a joy when it comes, did not fail me at this first sight of the greatest marvel and most storied place of Iceland.” When he is writing of the his second visit to Lithend in 1873, he states,\n\nIt was the same melancholy sort of day as yesterday and all looked somewhat drearier than before, two years ago on a brign evening, and it was not till I got back from the howe and wandered by myself about the said site of Gunnar’s hall and looked out thence over\n\n[202]\n\nthe great grey plain that I could answer to the echoes of the beautiful story – but then at all events I did not fail.\n\nA short time after he had returned to England, at the close of his second tour, he wrote to a friend,\n\nThe journey has deepened the impression I had of Iceland and increased my love for it. The glorious simplicity of the terrible and tragic, but beautiful land, with its well-remembered stories of brave men, killed all querulous feeling in me, and has made all the dear faces of wife and children and love and friends dearer than ever to me…! surely I have gained a great deal, and it was no idle whim that drew me there, but a true instinct for what I needed.\n\nMorris’s intense interest in everything Scandinavian during the years 1870 to 1876 – an interest which, as we have seen, led him to translate a number of Icelandic sagas and several Northern ballads and induced him to make two trips to Iceland- is reflected also in several original poems which he wrote at this time. All but one of these, Sigurd the Volsung, are minor works or fragments; I shall discuss these shorter poems first, for all of them seem to have been composed at an earlier date than the Sigurd.\n\nThree of these short pieces – “Iceland First Seen,” “Gunnar’s Howe above the House at Lithend,” and an unnamed fragment dealing with Gunnar and Njál- were directly inspired by his visits to Iceland. All three are undated, but although two of them were not published until 1891, when they appeared in Poems by the Way, and the third was first printed by Miss May Morris in 1936 in her William Morris: Artist Writer Socialist, the subject matter of these poems\n\n[203]\n\nmakes it almost certain that they were written in the early 1870’s.\n\nIn “Iceland First Seen,” a short piece consisting of six seven-line stanzas in anapestic hexameters rhyming ababacc, Morris represents himself as asking, as he catches his first glimpse of the bleak, mountainous country, what it is he has come to see in this desolate land, and he answers that it is Iceland’s glorious past which has drawn him thither; he goes on to say that even when Balder returns to the earth and all sorrow and pain come to an end, it will be pleasant to dream of the days of old, when men lived nobly and courageously, although faced with inevitable defeat and ruin. According to his Journal of his first visit to Iceland, he obtained his first glimpse of the country when the “Diana” sailed into Berufjőrðr on July 13, 1871 to land some passengers at the trading-station of Djúpivogr; no places are mentioned in the poem, but the description of the scene given in the opening stanza agrees with the account of Berufjőrðr in the Journal, so that this must have been the spot which inspired him to write these lines.\n\nThe second poem occasioned directly by his visit to Iceland, “Gunnar’s Howe above the House at Lithend,” is rather brief, consisting of only twenty hexameter lines. Here Morris describes his feelings as he stands at dusk one day, while the moon is shining feebly in the Northern summer sky, before the mound in which lies the famous Gunnar of the Njáls saga; he laments that noble\n\n[204]\n\ndeeds of the past can be so quickly forgotten that a man can now stand in this spot\n\nwith unbated breath,\n\nAs I name him that Gunnar of old, who erst in the haymaking tide\n\nFelt all the land fragrant and fresh, as amidst of the edges he died.\n\nToo swiftly fame fadeth away, if ye tremble not lest once again\n\nThe grey mound should open and show him glad-eyed without grudging or pain.\n\nLittle labour methinks to behold him but the tale-teller labored in vain.\n\nLittle labour for ears that may hearken to her his death-conquering song,\n\nTill the heart swells to think of the gladness undying that overcame wrong.\n\nIn these lines Morris is obviously referring to the account given in Chapter LXXVII of the Njáls saga of how one night shortly after his death Gunnar’s mound opened and Skarphedinn and Hőgni, Gunnar’s son, saw and heard Gunnar singing within. Morris records in the Journal of his first trip to Iceland in 1871 that he visited Lithend on July 21st, and says that he saw Gunnar’s mound first in the early evening and again, the same day, just before midnight. It was almost certainly this second visit that provided the setting for this poem; in his Journal he writes of it as follows: “… it must have been about eleven at night as we passed the howe again: the moon was in the western sky, a little thin crescent, not shining at all as yet, though the days are visibly drawing in, and the little valley was in a sort of twilight not: so to camp and into our tents away from the heavy dew: the wind\n\n[205]\n\nnorth-west and sky quite cloudless.” According to his account of his second journey to Iceland, he saw Lithend again in the summer of 1873 on his way from Reykjavík to Steppafil. On the outgoing trip the party passed by without stopping, but when Morris and his friends returned, they halted for a rest at that farm and Morris revisited Gunnar’s howe; he says, however, that the day was dreary and that he did not at all feel moved by the associations of the spot as he had been two years before. Undoubtedly it was the visit in July, 1871, that inspired the poem under consideration, and very likely Morris wrote the piece at this time or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe third poem on Iceland, as I have already stated, is only a fragment. After expressing his longing for the days of old when men lived bravely and nobly and even in defeat gained fair fame, Morris says he will try to sin of these past days while waiting for their return, and he then abruptly begins to describe the site of Gunnar’s home at Lithend, with Fleetlithe to the north and Eyiafell to the east, pointing out to his imaginary companion the path of green on the hill where Gunnar lived and died and telling his friend that it is impossible from this spot to see Bergthorsknoll, where Njál and Sharphedinn lie at rest. At this point the poem ends,\n\n[206]\n\nThe fragment that we have gives little indication of what Morris originally intended to do in this piece; it is possible that he had planned to retell briefly the story of Gunnar and Njál, using the actions of these men to exemplify the way of life that he had praised at the opening of the poem. Both this piece and the one discussed just before it reveal the deep impression that the Njáls saga, which he first read in Dasent’s translation, had made on Morris; undoubtedly his visits to the scenes of the tale had made the story even more vivid. For the metrical form of the poem Morris chose seven-line stanzas rhyming ababacc, each line containing seven accents; in this use of fourteen-syllable lines, as Miss Morris points out, Morris foreshadows the choice of metre he was to make for his Sigurd the Volsung.\n\nThree other poems which were printed for the first time in Poems by the Way in 1891 were the result of Morris’s Scandinavian studies. Only one of these, “The Raven and the King’s Daughter,” can be definitely placed in the period 1871 to 1876, the manuscript of this work being dated August, 1872, but the other two also, “Of the Wooing of Hallbiorn the Strong” and “The King of Denmark’s\n\n[207]\n\nSons,” for reasons which I shall state in a moment, were very likely composed in the early 1870’s, and are usually assigned to those years by critics.\n\nAll three of these poems are written in the ballad style, and are furnished with a double refrain. Two of them deal definitely with Scandinavian material; and the third also, “The Raven and the King’s Daughter,” although its subject matter cannot be traced directly to Norse sources, seems to have been influences by the author’s Scandinavian studies. Very likely, as I just stated, Morris wrote all three poems during the period now under consideration, when his mind was full of Scandinavian matters and he was translating Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic ballads. Of course, the use of the ballad form with the doullable refrain cannot be ascribed definitely and solely to the influence of his study of the Scandinavian folk songs, for Morris was also well acquainted with the English and Scottish ballads; however, double refrains are much more usual in the Norse bads than in the English and Scottish ones, and, besides, some of the refrains Morris introduced distinctly recall Scandinavian refrains, whereas none of them are at all closely paralleled in the English and Scottish ballads, so that\n\n[208]\n\nit seems very likely that these three ballad-imitations were, in form at least, the direct result of Morris’s interest in Scandinavian folk songs in the years 1870 to 1876.\n\n“The Raven and the King’s Daughter” tells of a princess who has been shut up by her father in a tower and who seeks information about her lover Olaf from a raven. On its first visit the bird relates that it has seen Olaf sailing to battle in the company of Steingrim, and it says that he was then singing a song, promising to return and win his love. For this information the girl gives the raven a ring. A short time later the bird comes back to tell the princess that Olaf distinguished himself in the battle, and that he is now lying asleep on his ship; it adds that before the fight Steingrim promised to unite Olaf with his love. The next day at daybreak Steingrim brings Olaf, dead, to the bed of the princess, and she dies at once.\n\nThe names “Olaf” and “Steingrim” indicate that this story deals with Scandinavian characters, but so far as I know, the poem is not a translation of any Norse ballad and is not based on any immediate Scandinavian source. However, although the story as a whole is apparently Morris’s own, he seems to have drawn some of its details at least from the Scandinavian and English\n\n[209]\n\nballads. For example, in several of these folk songs, as in Morris’s poem, birds are represented as carrying messages or news; in regard to Morris’s selection of a raven for this purpose in his tale, it is interesting to note that in the English and Scottish ballads the birds which play the part of messengers are described as hawks, parrots, starlings, magpies, popinjays, nightingales, larks, cocks, or simply as birds, but never, it seems, as ravens, whereas in the Scandinavian folk songs they are regularly given the name “ravens.” Moreover, the account at the close of Morris’s poem of the death of the princess upon the lifeless body of her lover is paralleled, roughly at least, in a great many ballads. Finally, the refrain which Morris uses in this ballad-imitation,\n\nFair summer is on many a shield\n\nFair sing the swans ‘twixt firth and field,\n\nmay very likely have been suggested to him by the refrains in the\n\n[210]\n\nIcelandic ballads “Vallara kvæði” and “Draumkvæði,” for in the first of these the refrain is\n\n-skín á skildi –\n\n-sol og sumarið fríða -,\n\nand in the second it runs\n\num sumarlánga tíð:\n\nmín liljan fríð:\n\nfagurt syngur svanrinn-\n\nBoth these ballads are printed in Grundtvig and Sigurðsson’s Íslenzk Fornkvæði, with which we have already seen that Morris was acquainted.\n\n“Of the Wooing of Hallbiorn the Strong” bears the subtitle “A Story From the Land Settling Book of Iceland, Chapter XXX.” In this poem Morris follows fairly closely the story told in the Landnámabók of Hallbiorn’s visit to Odd of Tongue, his marriage to Odd’s daughter, Hallgerd, the slaying of Hallgerd by Hallbiorn because of her refusal to accompany him home in the spring, the death of Hallbiorn at the hands of Snæbiorn, and the end of Snæbiorn on Gunnbiorn’s skerries. As is to be expected, Morris makes the tale somewhat longer and fuller, adding descriptive details, dialogue, and a little sentiment; but he does not depart from the main facts of his original, and the ballad style in which he writes the poem helps him to preserve much of the terseness, restraint,\n\n[211]\n\nand directions of the Icelandic account. The most striking change that he makes in the story concerns the part played by Snæbiorn in the tragedy. In the Landnámabók we are not told directly that Snæbiorn is a lover of Hallgerd, but we are led to suspect that he has some particular interest in the girl, for when the news of her slaying are brought to Odd, her father, the latter refuses to pursue Hallbiorn but immediately sends word to Snæbiorn, and it is this man who carries out the revenge on Hallbiorn and his followers. Morris, however, makes it clear from the outset that Snæbiorn is a rival lover, and he uses this character to render the situation more tense throughout the poem.\n\nVery interesting is Morris’s insertion into the story of a number of place-names which are not given in his original; apparently he introduced these names in order to make the setting more vivid. Thus, he mentions Deildar-tongue, Whitewater, Brothers’-Tongue, Whitewater-side, Olfus mouth, Helliskarth, Oxridges, Shieldbroad-side, and the Wells. In the Landnámabók the references to the scenes of the action are extremely vague; in order to give the tale such a definite setting Morris almost certainly must have drawn upon some other account of these incidents. However, so far as I know, there is no other written version of the story. In fact, with the exception of Whitewater and Whitewater-side, both of which are frequently referred to in the sagas, the\n\n[212]\n\nplace-names that Morris inserted are very rarely indeed mentioned in any of the sagas; only two of them occur in the Icelandic works which we know Morris had read at this time. Most likely Morris had acquired the knowledge he reveals here of the setting of the story in the course of his trip to Iceland in 1871. According to the Journal he kept during his first visit, he and his friends travelled through the region in which the tale is laid, and he mentions all but one of these places in his account of this part of his trip. Although he does not make any reference to this tale in the Journal, it is not at all unlikely that Magnússon, or some of the other Icelanders in the party, told or referred to the story as they were riding though this district, pointing out the places concerned, and that it was on this oral account, as well as on his own familiarity with the region and his acquaintance with the story in the Landnámabók, that Morris drew when he wrote his poem. In this connection it is interesting to note that a slight mistake that Morris makes in the poem in regard\n\n[213]\n\nto the setting is also found in his account of this district in the Journal of his tour. In both descriptions he states that Odd lived at Deildar-tongue, but as Magnússon points out in the Notes to the Journal, Odd did not live here but at Breiðabólstaðr.\n\nIn this poem Morris uses the refrain\n\nSo many times over comes summer again,\n\nWhat healing in summer if winter be vain?\n\nSo far as I know this is not a translation of any Scandinavian refrain, nor does it seem to have been directly inspired by any Scandinavian ballad. There are, however, a great many references to summer in the Scandinavian folk songs; as examples of refrains expressing a somewhat similar idea I should like to cite the following:\n\nNu är sommaren kommen;\n\nI år så blir de ten sommar;\n\nI år så få vi en sommar;\n\nTy nu går sommaren in;\n\n-Sumarið mun líða-.\n\nThe ballad entitled “The King of Denmark’s Sons” deals with Knut and Harald, the sons of King Gorm and Queen Thyrre. According\n\n[214]\n\nto Morris’s story, Harald, who was hot-headed, reckless, and given to fighting, grew up in jealousy and hatred of his brother Knut, who was kind-hearted, just, and fair, and who consequently won the love of his father and of all the people. In fact, Knut was so dear to his father that the King made a vow that whoever brought him news of his son’s death should himself lose his life at once. One Christmas as the young men were returning home for the Yule-feast, Harald came upon Knut in Lima-firth, the former having ten ships, the latter only three. The two parties fought, and Knut was killed. On his return home the following morning, Harald went at once to the Queen’s bower, and remained there the whole day. In the evening, evidently following the counsel of his mother, he strode into the hall where his father was drinking, and in answer to the King’s request for news, said that he had seen a white and a gray falcon battling together, and that after a long fight the gray one killed the white one. Gorm failed to realize the significance of the story. During the following night, however, while the King slept, Thyrre and her maidens draped the hall in black, and in the morning, as Gorm marched to his high-seat, he noticed the change. He asked the Queen whether Knut was dead, and she replied,\n\n“The doom on thee, O King!\n\nFor thine own lips have said the thing.”\n\nBefore noon old Gorm himself lay dead.\n\n[215]\n\nIt is interesting to note that in his poem Morris did not follow the more usual form of the story, according to which Knut was slain not by his brother but by the enemy, when the two brothers were fighting side by side in Great Britain; this is the version given in Saga Ólafs Konúngs Tryggvasonar, in the history of Saxo Grammaticus, in C. C. Rafn’s Nordiske Kæmpe-Historier, and in most of the modern histories which deal with the incident. Morris’s story is of course far superior to the other from a literary point of view: it has greater unity, it is much more dramatic, and the sense of tragedy is far deeper. For this form of the tale Morris very likely drew upon the account found in the opening chapters of Jómsvíkinga saga. This version is given by Torfæ\n\n[216]\n\nalso in hs Trifolium Historicum, and by J. B. Des Roches in his Histoire de Dannemarc, the passages in Des Roches which deal with these incidents being virtually a translation of Torfæus’s account. However, although we know that Morris could read both Latin and French, and although there is nothing in his poem which he could not just as easily have drawn from Torfæus or Des Roches as from the Jómsvíkinga saga, it seems most likely that it was the Icelandic version which served as the basis of the poem, for this account is the longest and most fully developed and is by far the most readily accessible. In retelling the story, Morris made only a few relatively unimportant changes.\n\nThe refrain that Morris uses in this ballad imitation,\n\nSo fair upriseth the rim of the sun.\n\nSo grey is the sea when the day is done,\n\nis not, so far as I know, either directly translated from, or even closely paralleled by, the burden in any Scandinavian folk song. I have not found anything resembling the second half of Morris’s refrain in the Scandinavian ballads; the first part may possibly\n\n[217]\n\nhave been suggested by such lines as,\n\nFör dagen dagas upp under östan;\n\nDet dagas intet än;\n\nMen det dagas likväl under tiden;\n\nIn der dagenn opliust!\n\nIn addition to the fragmentary poem on Iceland which I discussed above, Miss Morris printed in 1936 in her William Morris: Artist Writer Socialist two other unfinished poems on Scandinavian subjects which seem to have been composed during the period we are now considering.\n\nThe first one, which consists of only twenty-one and a half lines, tells, in rather humdrum verse, how the sailors aboard a trading-vessel which had passed from Ghent to Norway and was now skirting the coast in sight of the “Thrandheimers mountains,” suddenly became aware of a longship bearing down upon them, its drake-head flashing in the sun; at this dramatic moment the story comes to and end. This fragment, like the uncompleted poem about King Harald and the unfinished drama “Anthony,” both of which I shall discuss in a moment, was evidently an attempt on the part of Morris to tell and original story laid in the Viking Age. It\n\n[218]\n\nis rather surprising that during these years when he spent so much time reading and translating sagas he did not compose a tale of his own depiciting life in the saga-times; not until fifteen years later, when he began writing his prose romances, do we find him using the institutions, beliefs, and customs he found in the sagas to build up a background for an original narrative. The fragmentary story under consideration is told in rolling anapestic hexameter lines, which are grouped in seven-line stanzas rhyming abcbabc.\n\nThe second fragment is somewhat longer, consisting of twenty heroic couplets. These lines also, as I have already indicated above, seem to be the beginning of an original narrative poem dealing with events supposed to have taken place in early Scandinavia. The fragment opens with a description of the skald Hornklofi singing in a Norse hall at night, when suddenly\n\nfrom hollow of the horn\n\nA formless dreadful note of war is born\n\nSuch as we heard it when the day was new\n\nAnd the light wind across our raven blew\n\nDrifting the sailless ships in Hafursfirth\n\nWhile yet our glory was but come to birth.\n\nAfter a short account of this memorable victory at Hafursfirth the scene shifts back to the Norse hall, and the poem tells how Earl Ragnvald stands by the high-seat where sits King Harald, whose golden hair, now cut,\n\n[219]\n\nLies either side his face in tresses fair.\n\nFor the familiarity Morris reveals here with the skald Hornklofi, with Harald’s important victory at Hafursfirth, and with the clipping of Harald’s hair by Earl Ragnvald after the King had made himself sole ruler of Norway, he was obviously indebted to the Haralds saga hárfagra. However, there is no incident recorded in this saga between the time of Harald’s battle at Hafursfirth and the death of Ragnvald to which the poem as a whole can refer; apparently Morris was planning to treat the material in this part of the Heimskringla in an entirely original way.\n\nThe longest of these minor poems which Morris seems to have written during the period now under discussion and which bear the mark of his Scandinavian studies is the dramatic fragment “Anthony,” which he left unpublished but which his daughter printed in 1915. There is no external evidence, so far as I know, which dates this work. When Miss Morris published it in the last volume of the Collected Works, she included it in the group of compositions headed “Poems of the Earthly Paradise time (About 1865-1870)”; however, it seems to me almost certain that it was written well after 1870, for not only does Morris seem to allude to episodes in sagas which we know he did not read until after this year, but his very extensive references to the customs, beliefs, and history of the early Norse-men indicate that he was exceedingly well informed about these matters and that he was literally steeped in the stories of the sagas, and such was not the case before 1870. To be sure, Miss Morris\n\n[220]\n\nseems to have had no definite reason for ascribing the poem to this early period, and very likely she had no intention of placing it definitely before 1870; she evidently assigned it to this group because she could not include it in either of the other two sections, the first one being “Early Poems,” written while Morris was at Oxford or directly thereafter, and the last one being “Late Poems,” most of which are compositions resulting from his Socialistic activities. For the reasons stated above, I have decided to consider the fragment a product of the central period of Morris’s interest in Scandinavia; and I have accordingly felt justified in suggesting as possible sources of Morris’s Scandinavian allusions sagas which he seems first to have read during the years 1871 to 1876.\n\nThe leading figure in this drama is Anthony, a wealthy man of “noble Southland kin.” When the play opens, Anthony is sailing with Wulfstan, an English Shipmaster, to the home of Rolf on the coast of Norway, for the purpose of seeking revenge upon this Northman for having many years before attacked his ancestral castle in the south, slain his father, and carried off his sister Margaret. Just after Anthony has arrived in Norway and has been reunited with his sister, the poem ends. Morris does not state the time of the action, but various allusions in the fragment indicate that the story is laid in the tenth century. We are told, for example, that Iceland has been settled and that Icelandic\n\n[221]\n\nskalds are visiting in Norway; these remarks fix the time of the action well after 872. On the other hand, inasmuch as Norway is described as still being heathen, we can safely assume that we are dealing with the period before the reign of Olaf Tryggvason, who died in 1000, or at any rate before the death of Olaf the Holy in 1030.\n\nUnlike most of Morris’s other Scandinavian works, this poem does not seem to have any definite historical or literary basis. I do not know of any similar situation in the sagas. However, two of the characters may have had historical prototypes. There is a possibility that in the case of Rolf, the Viking who plundered and burned Anthony’s castle, Morris had in mind Rolf Ganger, who, according to the Heimskringla, frequently harried in the South – Baltic lands, once made a raid in the Vík contrary to the command of Harald Fairhair and was consequently outlawed, went plundering in the Hebrides and later in northwestern France, and finally became earl of what is now called Normandy. Rolf Ganger came to Normandy in 911 and died in 931. Morris was undoubtedly familiar with the history of this Rolf not only from the account in the Heimskringla but also from the story in Mallet’s Northern Antiquities. However, Morris never applies the picturesque name of Rolf ganger to his character, as it seems very likely that he would have done if he had intended that his poem should refer to the historical Rolf.\n\n[222]\n\nMoreover, in his poem Morris says that Rolf fought at York, Scarborough, and Dunwich, but none of the sagas, so far as I know, mention battles by Rolf Ganger at these places. On the whole, in spite of a certain similarity between the two, it is perhaps unsafe to assume that Morris intended to identify his character with Rolf Ganger. On the other hand, it is very probable that in the case of Earl Sigurd, who is depicted in the poem as the ruler of these Northmen, Morris is referring to Earl Sigurd of Ladir, who held practically supreme power over the Thrandheim district from the time of the death of his father Earl Hakon until he himself was murdered by the sons of Gunnhild, an event which, according to Laing, occurred in 962. the career of this Earl Sigurd is described at great length in the Heimskringla. However, in Morris’s poem Earl Sigurd is said to have visited the English king, but none of the sagas, so far as I know, mention any journey of Earl Sigurd of Ladir to England. Again, Morris says that Rolf was the foster-father of Earl Sigurd, but the sagas do not indicate where Earl Sigurd of Ladir was fostered. Nevertheless, in spite of these departures from the saga account; it is not at all unlikely that Morris meant to refer directly to the historical Earl Sigurd. The other Norse characters in the poem, Thora, Thorgerd, and Eric, are obviously entirely Morris’s own creations.\n\n[223]\n\nAlthough the story as a whole appears not to be based on any situation described in the sagas, it is clear that Morris drew directly on the sagas for many of his details; we find in the poem a number of references to early Scandinavian customs and beliefs, and there are several passages which distinctly recall episodes in the sagas.\n\nThus, at the opening of the drama, when Wulfstand and Anthony are on their way to Norway, the English shipmaster describes for Anthony the character of the Northmen, and imparts to him some sound advice as to how he must act in this new land. He says,\n\nA second warning: try your mocks on them,\n\nThey will not laugh belike or say a word\n\nThough the hall roars around them; you shall think\n\nThem dull and go on piling jeer on jeer;\n\nBut two hours thence, two hours or days or months,\n\nAs time serves, you shall find they understood.\n\nSimilar situations are found frequently in the sagas. In the Heiðarvíga saga, for example, Bardi is ridiculed and jeered at for being slow in seeking revenge for his brother Hall; but although he seems to pay little attention to these remarks, he carefully plans his actions with the help of Thorarin, and when the opportune moment arrives, he takes a revenge about which there is nothing mean. In the Hávarðar saga Ísfirðings old Howard is grievously insulted on two occasions when he seeks atonement from Thorbiorn for the slaying of his son Olaf, but although Howard must submit to these outrages at the time, he does\n\n[224]\n\nnot rest until he succeeds in killing Thorbiorn. Again, towards the close of the Vőlsunga saga Atli slays the brothers of Gudrun, his wife, and then mocks her; Gudrun pretends to be appeased, but some time thereafter she kills Atli’s two sons, murders him, and sets fire to the whole hall.\n\nA few lines later Wulfstan says,\n\n-Take this by the way that they may well deal thus,\n\nSell you a sword and thrust you through therewith,\n\nSell you a house and burn it o’er your head,\n\nSell you a horse and steal it the next morn,\n\nSell you a wife and bid her loose her tongue\n\nUntil you make a red mark on her face –\n\nAnd then the district-court and her tall kin\n\nAnd point and edge, or clink of the King’s sweet face\n\nOutside you purse – Well all that by the way.\n\nNothing exactly like this is related in any of the sagas, so far as I know. Very likely Morris is deliberately exaggerating the actual facts, because Wulfstan, into whose mouth he puts this statement, is obviously in a facetious mood as he characterizes the Norsemen for his friend Anthony. However, there is of course a certain element of truth in the description. For example, we frequently read in the sagas of the burning of people in their houses. The most famous account and the most likely source for Morris’s remark is, needless to say, the description given in the Njáls saga. The Hænsa-Dóris saga describes much more briefly a similar act, and the Eyrbyggja saga tells of an attempt at burning which was frustrated. Moreover, the last part of the passage\n\n[225]\n\nquoted – the account of the rights of married women – recalls the divorce of Thordis from Bork in the Eyrbyggja saga because of the blow he had give her when she tried to murder Eyolf. The account in the Laxdæla saga of Gudrun’s separation from her first husband Thorvald is perhaps even more similar; in that saga we are told that when Thorvald struck Gudrun because he had become impatient at her incessant demand for jewels, she replied that he had now given her what all women highly esteem, “en pat er litarapt gótt,” and when she was later divorced from him, she received half his property.\n\nIn his account of the Northmen Wulfstan goes on to say to Anthony that\n\nall women here –\n\nYea how you start – are marked and known and named\n\nDuaghter of this goodman, sister of that.\n\nEvidently Morris inserted this remark here because the Scandinavian system of nomenclature, which he of course met with in all the sagas he read, interested and amused him.\n\nAs the ship rounds a ness and they come in view of Rolf’s hall, Wulfstan describes the scene in the following words:\n\nlo there the hall\n\nBig enough for a king, the water deep\n\nUp to the garth-gate; there on the round hill\n\nThor’s temple – may Christ curse it! the ship-stocks,\n\nOne, two, three cutters, one great merchant-ship\n\nJust newly pitched – the long-ships neither there.\n\nA little later in the conversation, Wulfstan, having discovered the purpose of Anthony’s visit to Norway, exclaims,\n\n[226]\n\nWhy, [had] I said to Rolf thou wishedst him dead\n\nHe would laugh somewhat – drink nightlong with thee\n\nAnd call thee to the ring of hazel wands\n\nWherein they fight next morn….\n\nI do not know of any exactly similar situation in the sagas; but so-called “holmgangs” are frequently mentioned, and the description of one of these may have been the basis of Morris’s remark. In the Egils saga we learn that Egil Skallagrimsson at one time visited a friend called Friðgeirr at his home in Norway.\n\nAfter being detained there for three days by inclement weather, he prepared one morning to depart, and was then told that Ljótr the Pale, a famous beserk, had challenged Friðgeirr’s sister in marriage. Egil at once gladly assented to fight in his place and returned into the hall. The sagaman seems especially eager to show how unconcerned Egil was over such a fight, for he states that they drank all that day and arranged a great feast in the evening for a host of guests; the next day Egil killed Ljótr.\n\n[227]\n\nWulfstan tries further to frighten Anthony from seeking revenge by extolling Rolf’s prowess in battle; he describes vividly his skill in handling a sword, concluding with the remark,\n\nSo say his own men, and our English folk\n\nHave e’en such tales to tell of him at York\n\nAnd Scarborough and Dunwich.\n\nI have already referred to this passage in my discussion of the possibility that Morris intended to identify his character Rolf with Rolf Ganger, and I have pointed out that the sagas do not state that Rolf Ganger ever fought at these places. However, Morris shows that he is familiar with the history of the Norse incasions of England in ascribing battles here to his character, for the Northmen were very active in this part of England. York and Scarborough are frequently mentioned in the sagas.\n\nThe second scene of the drama is laid in Rolf’s home, where Thora, his wife, is talking with Margaret, Anthony’s sister. It is interesting to note how Morris utilizes his knowledge of the early history of Scandinavia by inserting allusions thereto in order to make his story more vivid and more realistic. Thus Thora remarks,\n\nday by day,\n\nFor a year past, I thought of sending thee\n\nUnto my mother’s brother in the North\n\nOr out to Iceland to my father’s kin.\n\n[228]\n\nThora babbles on, and recalls her wedding-feast five years earlier, at which Earl Sigurd, then a fair young man, was present; she exclaims that he was so handsome that\n\nBaldur come back to life again he seemed.\n\nWith Balder and the story of Ragnarők we have already on several occasions seen that Morris was acquainted.\n\nAfter Wulfstan and Anthony have arrived, we learn that Icelandic skalds are being entertained at Rolf’s house, for Thora checks Wulfstan’s rather florid praises of her with the words,\n\nNay Wulfstan, we shall get to verses soon;\n\nContent thee, man, two Icelanders we have\n\nTo set the big words going….\n\nWe read repeatedly in the sagas of Icelandic poets who lived as honored guests on the large estates in Norway and received noble gifts as reward for their compositions; in fact the majority of the Norwegian court poets were Icelanders. Some of the most famous of the Icelandic skalds who visited Norway w"
