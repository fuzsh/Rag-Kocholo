This historic yellow mansion in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was home to one of the world's foremost poets, scholars and educators. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow lived here from 1843 until his death in 1882 and produced many of his most famous poems and translations here. Geneneral George Washington also lived in the yellow house and used it as his headquarters during America's Revolutionary War, planning the Siege of Boston here between July 1775 and April 1776.
