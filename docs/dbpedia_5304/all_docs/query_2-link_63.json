Please send comments or corrections to Jeff Miller.\n\nLast revision: Jan. 20, 2022\n\n1897. Electrical engineering professor William Gladson of the University of Arkansas is said to have constructed an experimental wireless transmitter. [In 1900 a wireless telegraph station was installed at the University of Arkansas. In 1912 the school was granted a special land station with the call sign 5YM. A commercial broadcast license was obtained on Dec. 4, 1923, and in January 1924 5YM became KFMQ.]\n\nFall 1898. Notre Dame Professor Jerome Green sends messages a distance of about a mile, from Notre Dame to St. Mary’s, by wireless telegraphy. According to Notre Dame Professor Barry Keating, this is the first wireless transmission of any significant distance in North America. A detailed review of his work appeared in the July 1899 issue of American Electrician.\n\nOct. 1899. Marconi’s first trip to the U. S., to broadcast results of the America’s Cup race\n\n1900. University of Wisconsin professors and students begin experimenting with radio transmission using spark transmitters in 1900. By 1915 daily weather reports for farmers; June 1915 experimental license granted using 9XM on 475 and 750 m 5000 watt spark station; 9XM begins daily weather reports in Morse code in 1917; voice transmission in 1919 or 1920. According to Thomas White, \"9XM was first licensed as an experimental station around July, 1915, then was shut down with everyone else on April 7, 1917. After the war, 9XM first reappears on the station lists in the May, 1920 Radio Service Bulletin.\" According to Return With Us Now, the journal of the Radio Historical Association of Colorado, 9XM was authorized to continue its telephone exchange with the U. S. Navy stations on the Great Lakes during the war. [Bill Harris].\n\nDec. 23, 1900. The Canadian-American physicist Professor Reginald Aubrey Fessenden transmits speech using a spark-gap transmitter. He spoke the words, “One, two, three, four, is it snowing where you are Mr. Thiessen? If it is, would you telegraph back to me?” Mr. Thiessen, one mile way, heard the transmission. His voice was the first ever to be transmitted by radio waves and heard by another person.\n\nDec. 12, 1901. Marconi believes he hears letter “S” transmitted by Morse Code from Poldhu to Signal Hill, St. Johns NF. [The feat was considered the first transatlantic radio transmission, but later researchers have concluded that his reception was not possible and that Marconi may have instead heard static caused by lightning.]\n\nMarch 1902. Nathan B. Stubblefield of Murray, Ky., demonstrates wireless telephony by transmission from shore to a steamboat on the Potomac river near Washington, D. C. [He first demonstrated his invention in the Murray area in 1892.]\n\nNov. 25, 1905. An advertisement for the Telimco Wireless Telegraph Outfit appears in Scientific American. This may be the first advertisement for a radio. Details are available at http://earlyradiohistory.us/1905teli.htm.\n\nDec. 21, 1906. Reginald Aubrey Fessenden conducts a public demonstration of radiotelephony between Brant Rock and Plymouth, Mass. [In a 1932 letter Fessenden said this might not be considered the beginning of broadcasting because it was transmitted to an invited audience, and he stated that a transmission he sent on Christmas Eve in 1906 would be the first broadcast. The Dec. 24, 1906, broadcast, he wrote, was advertised in advance, with U. S. Navy and United States Fruit Company ships notified by telegraph. Fessenden claimed that the broadcast from Brant Rock included a female voice singing a Christmas carol, a violin solo by Fessenden, and a phonograph recording. There is apparently no proof that the Dec. 24 broadcast actually took place.]\n\nJuly 18, 1907. De Forest makes the first ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone. They were race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association Regatta held on Lake Erie, sent from a steam yacht to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, on South Bass Island.\n\nDec. 16, 1907. 1st SINGER TO BROADCAST was Eugenia H. Farrar, whose voice was broadcast by Lee De Forest December 16, 1907, from Brooklyn Navy Yard on the occasion of the departure of Admiral Robley Dunglison Evans (\"Fighting Bob Evans\") on a cruise with the fleet. (FFF) (De Forest claims to have begun regular broadcasting in 1907 from laboratory in Parker Building in New York.\n\n1908. De Forest set up transmitter at foot of the Eiffel Tower and gave a demonstration program of gramophone records\n\n1908. Berlin Convention assigns the initial letters N, W, and some K to the United States\n\n1908. A. Frederick Collins broadcasts voice and music using an arc transmitter in Newark.\n\n1909. Harriet Blatch, De Forest’s mother-in-law, speaks in favor of women’s suffrage; De Forest claims the first propaganda broadcast\n\nJan. 31, 1909. The word broadcast appears in the Boston Globe in an article “Experiment with Wireless,” which refers to how information about a ship that was sinking was “sent broadcast” by wireless telegraphers. [On Jan. 9, 1910, the New York Times refers to how Lee DeForest has a long distance transmitter that allows music from the Metropolitan Opera Company to be “sent out broadcast.” These citations were provided by Donna Halper.]\n\nMar. 18, 1909. First ham transmission, as Einar Dessau of Denmark talks to a government radio post about 6 mi away\n\nApr. 1909. Charles Herrold transmits voice from San Jose. [In 1910 he used the call FN; in 1912 he maintained a broadcast schedule with some regularity; by 1913 he used the call SJN; in 1916 he was assigned the calls 6XE (portable) and 6XF (fixed); in 1921 the call was changed to KQW and in 1949 to KCBS.]\n\nJan. 12-13, 1910. De Forest arranges the world’s first radio broadcast to public, directly from Metropolitan Opera to several listeners in New York. He used two microphones and a 500-w transmitter. According to the 1989 edition of the Annals of the Metropolitan Opera, \"In a pioneering effort, two decades before radio became an important aspect of the company’s activities, parts of (Puccini’s) Tosca (January 12, 1910) and complete performances of (Mascagni’s) Cavalleria Rusticana and (Leoncavallo’s) I Pagliacci (January 13, 1910) were broadcast. Few could hear the transmission as the sound quality was poor.\" The cast of Puccini’s Tosca on January 12 featured Olive Fremstad as Floria Tosca, Pasquale Amato as Baron Scarpia and Riccardo Martin as Cavaradossi, the tenor lead.\n\nIn his 1950 autobiography Father of Radio, De Forest wrote:\n\nFor my debut in broadcasting of opera, [Metropolitan Opera House assistant director Andreas] Dippell suggested the double bill of Cavalleria Rusticana and I Pagliacci. The Acousticon microphone was located in the footlights, but for the opening aria, 'La Siciliana,' in Cavalleria, which was sung behind the curtain, a duplicate microphone was located on a small table before which Ricardo Martin stood when he sang that aria. Then before the curtains were withdrawn for the opening scene, this microphone and the wires and table were swiftly removed from sight. For Caruso, as Canio in Pagliacci, the microphone was installed in the footlights.\n\nAccording to The Empire of the Air (1932), \"Mr. Emil J. Simon, a radio engineer of Cleveland, heard the program while aboard a Royal Mail liner at sea and reported that the reception was excellent.\"\n\nIn an interview given to the New York Evening Mail and later quoted in Empire of the Air (1932), de Forest said:\n\nThe first broadcasting of music, other than phonograph, occurred in the spring of 1910 on top of the Metropolitan Opera House, where I erected a temporary radio-telephone transmitter connected with two microphones placed among the footlights of the stage. The first opera singer whose voice was thus broadcast was Caruso, singing the role of Turiddu in Cavalleria Rusticana.\n\nDe Forest’s recollections as to the precise date and the role of Caruso were flawed. The Annals of the Metropolitan Opera indicates that in the first opera of the double-header presented on Jan. 13, Cavalleria Rusticana, Riccardo Martin sang the role of Turiddu. The second opera, I Pagliacci, featured Enrico Caruso singing the lead tenor role, of Canio. Furthermore, the Jan. 14, 1910, New York Times reported, \"The warblings of Caruso and Mme. Destinn in Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci was not clearly audible to the reporters who were summoned to hear it at the headquarters of the inventor..\" In July 1925 Radio News reported in Part 10 of \"The Life and Work of Lee DeForest,\" \"Through the cooperation of the Acousticon company, DeForest was able to put a couple of microphones on the stage and in the wings. The opera selected for the first bill was actually two operas. It was one of the Met’s. usual double bills. It consisted of Pagliacci and Cavalleria Rusticana. Caruso was appearing in the former and Mme. Mazcarimi in the latter.\"\n\nArthur E. Zimmerman, Ph.D., who assisted with this entry, reports that he has checked the entire 1909-1910 season and found that Caruso did not sing in Cavalleria Rusticana at all. He also reports his original source implies, but does not state, that the second opera, which featured Caruso, was not broadcast.\n\nJune 24, 1910. U. S. approves an act requiring radio equipment on certain passenger-carrying vessels\n\n1911. First U. S. radio license is issued to George Hill Lewis of Cincinnati\n\n1911. The New Jersey Telephone Herald operates a wired \"radio\" service in Newark for about 5000 subscribers. The service ended in Dec. 1912.\n\nMay 25, 1911.

President Taft signs into law the Radio Act of 1912.\n\n1914. 8CO (8YV, WSAJ) Grove City PA [According to Darren J. Morton, 8YV was licensed on March 1, 1917. The licensing of 8CO in 1914 has not been confirmed.]\n\nApr. 5, 1914. Inning-by inning scores of an exhibition baseball game between the New York Giants and Memphis Turtles, playing at the Red Elm Bottoms in Memphis, was sent from the Falls Building to the steamboat G. W. Robertson. Information was telephoned from the ball park to the Falls Building, and then sent by Victor H. Laughter’s voice transmitter to the Robertson.\n\nAug. 26, 1914. Radio Operator, Commercial Extra First Class, license number 1 issued to Elmo Neale Pickerill; qualified by demonstrating a skill of 32 wpm in Continental Morse Code and 35 wpm in American Morse\n\n1915. Weather and crop reports are broadcast from the University of Texas. The Handbook of Texas Online has:\n\nIn 1911 J. B. Dickinson, manager of the Texas Fiscal Agency at San Antonio, constructed wireless facilities at both schools to teach electrical engineering students about radio transmissions. As part of his experiments in high-frequency radio, University of Texas physics professor S. Leroy Brown built radio equipment and began broadcasting weather and crop reports from a physics laboratory on the UT campus in 1915. During World War I, using the call letters KUT, the university’s Division of Extension operated Brown’s equipment to broadcast reports from the United States Marketing Bureau and Department of Agriculture. By March 1922 the station had combined with a second campus station (call letters 5XY) and with a 500-watt power rating was one of the best-equipped and most powerful stations in the nation. The usual broadcasts were from 8 to 10 P.M. on three nights a week; programming consisted of music, lectures, and agriculture and marketing reports.\n\nSpring, 1916. De Forest regularly maintains a phonograph concert service three times a week, as experimental 2XG New York NY, with the Columbia Phonograph Co. furnishing records in exchange for announcements; an elaborate opening of that service was arranged, at the Hotel Astor, to which press representatives were invited\n\n1916.

Harold Power, founder of AMRAD, broadcasts a phonograph concert using the 1JJ call of the Tufts Wireless Club. The three-hour concerts during March were heard by ships at sea, various amateurs, and a Boston Globe reporter who was quite amazed to hear something other than Morse code. Power began using the call 1XE in 1917. 1XE later became WGI Medford Hillside MA.\n\nJune 1916. 9ZP (KGFX) Pierre SD\n\nAug. 1916. 8XK (8ZZ, KDKA) Pittsburgh PA lic\n\nAug. 1, 1916.

XWA (CFCF) Montreal receives government authorization to send voice transmissions. (The station had received authorization to send code for experimental broadcasts on 3/20/1919. According to Mary Vipond in Listening In: The First Decade of Canadian Broadcasting, voice broadcasts began in the fall of 1919, based on Marconi factory notes.)\n\nFall, 1919. The wartime ban is lifted and De Forest resumes broadcasting at Highbridge, the Bronx\n\nOct. 1, 1919. In the Radio Service Bulletin, the Bureau of Standards announces an experimental Government land station located at Washington, DC, featuring the call letters WWV. The station had no assigned wavelength or fixed hours of operation.\n\nOct. 17, 1919. The Radio Corporation of America is formed, incorporating in Delaware\n\nNov. 1919. 1XE (WGI) Medford Hillside MA broadcasts voice and music sporadically, once or twice a week. Donna Halper says that according to correspondence she has seen from Harold Power, these broadcasts increased during 1920 to the point that by late summer, they were on a fairly frequent basis.\n\nNov. 19, 1919. 8ZAE (KQV) Pittsburgh PA lic\n\nDec. 1919. (or early 1920) De Forest moves transmitter to the World Tower Bldg. on W 38th St. and begins a combined vocal and phonograph service (in 1920 station is shut down because government De Forest had not obtained approval for move, De Forest claims station had its license canceled by the Federal Radio Inspector of that district because \"there was no room in the ether for entertainment\")\n\nJan. 1920. Vaughn de Leath sings on De Forest’s station to become \"First Lady of radio\"\n\nMar. 1920. 1XE (WGI) begins weekly Sunday afternoon classical music concerts\n\nAccording to the March 16, 1925, issue of the weekly publication the Boston Chamber of Commerce, \"...From records available at WGI, it would appear that the Medford Hillside station was broadcasting regular programs at least one month before KDKA.\" The statement was written by Lewis Whitcomb, assistant program manager of competing WEEI and formerly radio columnist for the Boston Post [Donna Halper].\n\nApril 1, 1920. The Western Radio Electric Company receives a license for a Special Land Station with the call letters 6XD to operate in Los Angeles, California. [In October of 1922, Radio Doings magazine called 6XD \"The first broadcasting station in Southern California, one year in advance of any other in the area.” Pacific Radio News in 1921 listed 6XD as broadcasting on 325 meters/920 kilocycles two nights a week. Phonograph records from Victor were played on the air in exchange for plugs for a local music shop. It is likely that experimental radio station 6XD was on the air about 5 months ahead of KNX’s predecessor, 6ADZ. Station 6XD was relicensed as radio station KZC on 360 meters December 9, 1921, and changed calls to KOG in February of 1922. The station went off the air and was deleted March 9, 1923. Information from Jim Hilliker.]\n\nMay 20, 1920. First scheduled broadcast in North America, XWA (CFCF) Montreal. A concert by vocalist Dorothy Lutton was broadcast. See also an earlier entry for XWA. Arthur E. Zimmerman, Ph.D., who is researching the history of the radio stations of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada, Limited, believes that CFCF \"has a strong claim as the oldest 'real' radio station in the world, the criterion being that it pre-announced a broadcast for May 20, 1920, and it can be verified that the broadcast actually took place.\"\n\nJune 1920. KD-- assigned for all stations starting now (having exhausted KI-- KO-- KU--)\n\nJune 4, 1920. Official announcement of experimental broadcasts on WWV: \"Experimental concerts are at present being sent out on Friday evening from 8:30 to 11, by the Radio Laboratory of the Bureau of Standards, using a wave length of 500 meters.\"\n\nAug. 20, 1920. 8MK (WBL, WWJ) begins formal period of testing\n\nAug. 31, 1920. 8MK (WBL, WWJ) is formally dedicated and broadcasts election returns\n\nSept. 6, 1920.

First broadcast by a dance band, Paul Spech and his orchestra\n\nOct. 5, 1920. World Series scores aired by 8MK (WBL, WWJ)\n\nOct. 14, 1920. The first college radio station goes on the air at Union College in Schenectady, according to Famous First Facts, which identifies the station as WRUC. The original call was actually 2XQ, according to Radio World of June 10, 1922. In March 1922 the station was given the call WRL. [Donna Halper] According to Famous First Facts, \"It instituted a series of weekly programs on Oct. 15, 1920, consisting of vocal and instrumental phonograph records. The programs were broadcast from 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. with a three-minute interval. They were initially heard within a 50-mile radius; this increased under favorable weather conditions. A 5 50-watt U-2 transmitter was used.”\n\nOct. 16, 1920. Westinghouse applies to Dept. of Commerce for a license to begin regular broadcasting service; by telephone a few days later permission granted to use the amateur call 8ZZ in case the formal and written license was not received by Nov. 2\n\nOct. 27, 1920. KDKA call letters assigned; call is between the ships Montgomery City (KDJZ) and Eastern Sword (KDKB) (but White has call assigned Oct. 22); the KD- for all policy continued until April 1921\n\nNov. 2, 1920. KDKA broadcasts election results 8 p.m., 330 meters, 100 w, apparently using the call 8ZZ; Leo Rosenberg of Westinghouse’s publicity dept read the returns; Donald Little and John Frazier in charge of technical operation; regular broadcasting then followed nightly 8:30 to 9:30\n\nNov. 25, 1920. Famous First Facts has:\n\nNov. 25, 1920 - FIRST FOOTBALL GAME (COLLEGIATE) BROADCAST was presented by (WTAW) of College Station, Tex. The game was played on Thanksgiving Day between Texas University and the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas at College Station. At that time the station was operating under an experimental license and had the call letters 5XB. A spark transmitter was used and the transmission was in code. This was the first play-by-play broadcast of a football game.\n\nHowever, the Handbook of Texas Online has:\n\nNov. 1, 1921. The first licensed station in L.A., KQL, had its first and possibly only broadcast on November 1, 1921..Tiny ad in Los Angeles Times, page 3 on 11-1-21. [Hilliker]\n\nOn November 24, 1921, possibly the first broadcast of a football game in the country aired from the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Texas A&M University) via call letters 5XB, which is now WTAW. The station operated as a ham relay station at 250 watts. Originally, the station was to air the final score of the Texas-Texas A&M Thanksgiving game, but Frank Matejka, W. A. Tolson, and others decided to send a play-by-play account of the game via Morse Code. Student Harry Saunders and assistant coach D. X. Bibleqv designed a set of abbreviations to fit every possible football situation and sent the list to every station that would broadcast the contest. The game aired over the ham relay stations; the Morse Code was decoded and announced to fans over a public-address system.\n\nAnother source says the first football game broadcast was Nov. 23, 1919, with the score Texas A&M 7, University of TX 0.\n\nDec. 15, 1920. WWV is reactivated in cooperation with the Bureau of Markets of the Department of Agriculture, who used the station as an experimental radio service for the dissemination of market news (the \"Daily Radio Marketgram\"). Transmissions used a 2 kW spark transmitter and Morse code, continuing for four months at 5:00 PM (except Sundays and holidays) on 750 kHz (400 meters). The service was subsequently adapted by the Air Mail Radio Service of the Post Office Department, on April 15, 1921.\n\nDec. 22, 1920. FIRST PRIZE FIGHT BROADCAST FROM THE RINGSIDE was presented from Madison Square Garden. Joe Lynch of New York City defended his bantamweight title against Peter Herman of New Orleans in a 15-round fight. (FFF)\n\n1921.

[Another claim for the first opera on radio is Mozart’s The Impresario on WJZ on March 15, 1922.]\n\nMay 20, 1921. 1XE (WGI) is believed to have begun regular daily broadcasting on this date. Broadcast historian Donna Halper reports that Little Folks Magazine bought commercial time on Eunice Randall’s children’s story hour from November 1921 on. These could be considered among the first commercials aired or could be considered barter advertising. However, on April 4, 1922, the station did receive payment for a commercial for an auto dealer.\n\nJuly 2, 1921.
