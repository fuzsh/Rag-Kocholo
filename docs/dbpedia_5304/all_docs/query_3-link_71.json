        "text": "“Continued broadcasting will change the awareness of the people. The DPRK (North Korea) is a country that cannot exist long. Broadcasting is like shooting a gun at the general public. You should broadcast even if you think there is only one person in the audience. You should not spare money for broadcasting.”\n\nNorth Korean defector & former journalist\n\n2000\n\n“I really admire your daily programs and listen to them on a regular basis. I believe that what you are producing is the best programming among all Persian radio broadcasts originating from abroad.”\n\nListener in Iran\n\n2000\n\n“Through jamming, through all the technical problems, across seas and oceans for many years, weâve been listening to VOA.â¦ We are especially interested to hear about people who are able to laugh at themselves and their circumstances.”\n\nListener from Russia\n\n2000\n\n“Radio Free Asiaâs Uyghur program is the only source in the Uyghur region that provides timely news and truthful information. Our government and media broadcast only propaganda and untruthful information.”\n\nListener from the Uyghur region\n\n2000\n\n“RFA is an objective, fair, and accurate radio station. What you report is exactly what we ordinary people need so we can learn what is happening around us. Often, the Chinese government blocks the news and also tries to fool us. We donât even know what is happening in our own environment.”\n\nStudent from China\n\n2000\n\n“For me, Radio Libertyâjust as for millions of its listeners in the boundless stretches of [Russia]âwas and is the real embodiment of its name, âSvobodaâ (freedom). It is freedom from lies, it is the freedom to receive and distribute information as it is formulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the quiet days of our lives, one can think that âSvobodaâ is one radio station among many. But, oh, such days are few! And in all the othersâthose showery and stormy days and times of fog and bloodâyou understand that âSvobodaâ will still be needed by Russia on its long path to Freedom!”\n\nElena Bonner, Russian human rights activist\n\n2000\n\n“You are ordinary Chinese, but the work you do is extraordinary. Your work is to wake up millions of Chinese who have been cheated, numbed, fooled and persecuted and learn their situation. Thanks to you, RFA. You have opened a window for China and introduced space for democracy and freedom. You are a real promising sunshine. I wish all of the RFA staff good health and ask you to work hard so Chinese people can break away from the hardship of life sooner and live happily and freely. This will be RFA âs achievement that will be remembered forever.”\n\nListener from China\n\n1999\n\n“Although I could not understand why some callers support the CCP, we have at least one thing in common we all love to listen to RFA. I think the CCP is afraid of people listening to RFA because they do not want people to know more about freedom and democracy.”\n\nCaller from China\n\n1999\n\n“RFA broadcasts, like an educator, has brightened our hearts â¦They have opened our eyes. China always wants to keep the Uyghurs ignorant of the world. But now we understand democracy, human rights, and freedom. RFA broadcast means more than food, drink, and air to us because it give s us hope and inspiration. We hope RFA increases the broadcast time in the Uyghur language.”\n\nRFA Uyghur Listener\n\n1999\n\n“I want to thank you because of the great service you provide, especially the Persian radio. In all the days of the protests, the only news agency I could trust was youâ¦.I hope someday all the work we do will lead Iran to freedom.”\n\nListener from Iran\n\n1999\n\n“As one of the constant listeners of Radio Liberty, I want to thank you, the American Congress and the American people for the enormous contribution you have made to the dissemination of the ideas of democracy, justice and freedom through the entire world. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Radio Liberty is one of the few tribunes for those struggling for the establishment of democracy and a just society in those countries where even up to now rule dictatorship and authoritarianism.”\n\nKhazratkul Khudoiberdi, former Uzbek political prisoner\n\n1999\n\n“I am a Uyghur listener. I think RFA is the only station where we Uyghurs can express our political views freely. So, on behalf of 25 million Uyghurs, I am very thankful for you. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!”\n\nRFA Uyghur listener\n\n1999\n\n“Let me call you Voice of a Miracle because your voice enters directly to the heart and interconnects the entire world.”\n\nVOA Learning English Listener\n\n1999\n\n“It is not possible to get the truth from domestic Chinese sources. In order to get the truth in China, one has no choice but to become a faithful listener to the Voice of America.”\n\nWei Jingsheng, Chinese dissident\n\n1998\n\n“âI am in anguish. There is a spiritual hunger in me. I thirst for certain information, but given the way things are in China, my thirst cannot be quenched. I can only tune into your program often. I like your program a lot. Your program moves me so much that I have become an insomniac.â”\n\nRFA Listener, Guangxi Province, China\n\n1998\n\n“The Tibetan language program...has become the listening post and window to the outside world for the Tibetans under the occupation by China. I know for a fact that the Tibetans inside Tibet listen to your program every day at the great risk of being prosecuted and imprisoned by the Chinese authorities.”\n\nExcerpt of a letter to Radio Free Asia f rom a listener, Wangchuk Tsering, in Nepal\n\n1998\n\n“Your voices are our voices. After I've listened to you once, I can't stop listening. Not only do I listen to programs carefully I also love to talk about them, think about them, and tape them.”\n\nLetter to RFA from Shanxi Province, China\n\n1998\n\n“You can say that your program speaks to our hearts and in the middle of the long lingering night, it lets us see the hope of a free China. History will never forget youâ Radio Free Asiaâand the Chinese people who live under the dictatorial rule and long for freedom and democracy will thank you.”\n\nMiddle school history teacher, Yunnan Province, China\n\n1997\n\n“The fact that mainland China has jammed Radio Free Asia in this way really proves that your stationâs broadcasts have hit the Communist Party where it hurts.”\n\nListener from China\n\n1997\n\n“Dari [VOA] air shows are received in Kabul loud and clear. Your scientific, cultural, and informative programs certainly help us gain scientific knowledge. Your call-in show covers a range of interesting subjects and your broadcast policy is appropriate as it contains material fit for the needs of our society.”\n\nListener in Kabul, Afghanistan\n\n1997\n\n“...[Y]our program is ameliorating the lives of Rwandans and Burundians who seemed abandoned by the whole world. Now is the time that America is really showing its democratic leadership by trying to build a country that was divided by conflict.”\n\nRwandan listener (VOA)\n\n1997\n\n“I listen to your program [VOA] every evening....Iâd like to use this opportunity to express my gratitude to you on your effort to enforce some light in the dark media skies over Yugoslavia.”\n\nVOA Serbian Listener\n\n1997\n\n“I arrived from Cuba on May 26, 1996, and I can tell you that thanks to Radio MartÃ­, the Cuban people keep themselves informed, from all points of view, about news, art, culture, and music.”\n\nRadio MartÃ­ Listener\n\n1997\n\n“I am intellectually challenged by my weekly VOA show which broadcasts all over the world and is translated into many languages...”\n\nGreta Van Susteren, VOA Contributor\n\nFormer MSNBC, CNN, and FOX News host\n\n“Macedonia has experienced what it means when you lose free media. It means that you become hostage to fake news, malign information and very, very difficult warfare. So, in our experience, VOA has always been the source of freely information, the appropriate context, analyses, and explanation, that actually every citizen of this world needs today.”\n\nRadmila Sekerinska Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Macedonia\n\n“Television is not the only source of information. but it is the source in which many people have the greatest trust. Current Time is the only television in the world that tells these people, in Russian, the truth about the current state of affairs. And it is television that is the most effective way of gaining their trust.”\n\nVitaly Mansky, Russian documentary filmmaker\n\n“Many media programs have dealt with ISIS using various methods. However, the new documentary series, âDelusional Paradiseâ adopts a unique, extremely sensitive line by focusing on the âliving victimsâ who have lost loved ones and family members to ISISâs violence.”\n\nWaleed Barkasyieh for Almodon.com\n\n“I trust RFA Khmer because RFA Khmer is working for the Cambodian people in order to know the truth.”\n\nListener from Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n\n“Now, we high school students are starting to get to know your station. Your program is very educational. You give us information that our teachers and government won't give to us.”\n\nListener from Guangzhou, China\n\nOn Radio Free Asia\n\n“I first learned about Hong Kong's Occupy Central Movement through shortwave broadcasting by Radio Free Asia. I am thrilled for the people of Hong Kong to bravely fight for democracy and freedom.”\n\nCaller from Huizhou, China\n\n“I feel like I am home. I wake up (in Cuba) with (Con Voz Propia) every morning, and I canât believe I am here!”\n\nBerta Soler, leader of the \"Ladies in White\" protest group\n\nAppearance on Radio MartÃ­âs daily live show, Con Voz Propia (In Their Own Voice)\n\n“People know me not for my blog, or my Twitter account, but by my presence and voice on Radio MartÃ­.”\n\nCuban blogger Yoani SÃ¡nchez\n\n“The Voice of America has become the voice of Venezuelans.”\n\nVenezuela opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado\n\nInterview with VOA's Spanish Service\n\n“Voice of America, by all standards, has been a media outlet with the highest listenership and most reliable source of information of all international media outlets.
