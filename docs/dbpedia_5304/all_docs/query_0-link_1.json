Its towers are located in St. Clairsville, Ohio. It is West Virginia's only class A 50,000–watt clear-channel station, sharing the frequency's Class A status with KTSB in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and KJNP in North Pole, Alaska. WWVA can be heard in most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States at night, as well as most of Canada. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and uses the on-air nickname \"The Big One\" (borrowed from sister stations WLW and WTAM). WWVA was one of the first stations in the U.S. to have an in-studio Citizens band radio to talk to listeners at night, in between songs and other on-air items, during the 1970s when it produced and ran an in-house nightly truckers' show hosted by the popular radio personality, Buddy Ray. Ray left the station in the early 1980s. In two instances has WWVA been threatened with relocation, neither being successful: first in 1930 to Charleston by then-owner West Virginia Broadcasting Corporation, and again in 2004 to Stow, Ohio (a suburb of Akron) by then-Clear Channel Communications. WWVA is one of the Local Primary 1 Emergency Alert System stations in the Wheeling area.
