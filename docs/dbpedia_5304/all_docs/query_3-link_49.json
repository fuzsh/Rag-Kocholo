Theyâve since fixed the issue of having to continually delete and reload the app when it freezes up. Fingers crossed that it stays this way. Thank developers for listening.\n\nIâve really enjoyed having this app so donât take my 1 star review the wrong way. I need to listen to traffic in Philadelphia when coming out of South Jersey so I can get the Philly news station that updates traffic reports every 10 minutes. The latest update changed the entire look of the app. Since this last update, Iâve had nothing but issues. I have to reboot my phone, delete the app and reload it just to get it to start working, and even then the options are minimal. It wonât let me get to my favorites. The only thing it will let me do is search for the station I want. Then, if I get a phone call, it pauses like normal, but then I have to go through the process of rebooting and other steps to get it working again. Iâm sure Iâm not the only one having issues. Please fix the and I will update my review.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi,\n\nI understand that you are having an unpleasant experience with streaming.\n\nI request that you update the app to the latest version. If you continue to experience issues, please reach out to us at support@audacy.com with reference #396730\n\nThank you,\n\nAudacy Support Team\n\nLabGuy16 ,\n\nA few issues\n\nI only use Audacy to get my favorite sports station and for the most part itâs fine. But I often have issues where randomly every so often the app will go back about a minute maybe in the broadcast and replay what I just heard. At the end of a segment it will sometimes repeat that segment. This may be a CarPlay issue, but when connected to CarPlay it will occasionally stop playing audio while still âplayingâ the broadcast and I have to usually hit stop and then play to resume audio and maybe have to rewind depending how much I miss. When resuming listening my last listening session, itâs 50/50 whether the app does a new âboot upâ and I have to go find the episode I was listening to under recents or it just brings up my last episode and I can just hit play. It does however usually resume where I left off or close to it. My favorite feature, the playback speed button, has been disabled for a few months now. Hopefully that comes back sooner rather than later so I can shorten my listening segments a bit.\n\nAnd this may be a CarPlay issue but it would be nice to have a chapter skip/back button in addition to the 15 second skip/rewind. And the only working button on the general audio screen is the play/pause. Skip/back donât do anything and thereâs no 15 skip.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi,\n\nWe see that you are facing multiple issues while streaming on the Audacy app.\n\nKindly reach out to us atÂ support@audacy.com (mailto:support@audacy.com)Â with referenceÂ #35916. We'll definitely assist you.\n\nRegards,\n\nAudacy Support Team\n\nAcam1223 ,\n\nGood but frustrating and disappointing.\n\nPlease read other reviewers frustrating reviews as of recent (Jan-Apr 2022). I am experiencing the same things as them. Below are a few positive experiences though\n\nI utilize this app because my local sports radio station WFAN 660AM is on it. So even when Iâm not in the car, I can listen to my favorite sports talk radio station. The rewind feature is useful if I miss a segment or interview, and having each show upload âsegmentsâas podcast sound bites is useful too so I can catch up later if I want too. What is frustrating is that sometimes this app does not play when the phone screen is locked. This forces me to restart my phone and log out of my account and then back in. Last year I was super excited when I learned that I would be able to listen to the AM radio broadcast of the Yankee game. This is the most frustrating thingâ¦.I live within broadcast metro area and sometimes I can listen to the game and sometimes it says Iâm âout of the broadcast regionâ even when Iâm listening in a location where itâs worked before. This is a big turn off for me and has me looked for the Yankee radio stream elsewhere. I have the location-service feature turned on, and Iâve even pre-selected the region to see if that would work in the app settings and it doesnât work. This is extremely frustrating because radio broadcasts should be available no matter the situation.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for providing valuable feedback.\n\nIt seems like you have some concerns when streaming live games and using the features on the app. We request you to write back to us at support@audacy.com and refer # 364334 so that we will look into it further. Looking forward to your email soon.\n\nThank you,\n\nAudacy Support Team"
