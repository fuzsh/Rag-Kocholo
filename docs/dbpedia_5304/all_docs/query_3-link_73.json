        "text": "Dr. Santiba Campbell recently appeared on Triad Today with Jim Griffin on WSJS Radio to discuss her new role as Interim Vice President of Academic Affairs at Bennett College. Dr. Campbell, who has been with Bennett College for over a decade, brings a rich background in psychology and a deep commitment to empowering students. Her interview also addressed unconscious biases and our “cognitive toolbox.”\n\nReflecting on her first 39 days as Interim Vice President, Dr. Campbell expressed her excitement about taking on this position at Bennett College in a time of innovation and transformation. “It definitely feels different,” she shared, noting that the transition from professor to administrator is both challenging and rewarding.\n\nA native of North Carolina, Dr. Campbell’s academic journey at Bennett College began in 2012 as an assistant professor of psychology. Over the years, she earned tenure and advanced to become an associate professor, focusing on social psychology. She received her Bachelor of Arts in psychology from Winston-Salem State University and earned a master of arts and a PhD from the University of Delaware, where her basic research question addressed: What factors determine whether, in the face of perpetual threats posed by racism and racial discrimination, African Americans maintain positive psychological well-being, physical health, achieve success and reach personal goals, or adopt negative self-images and other destructive behaviors? This was studied through the lens of racial identity development, intersectionality, and contemplative practices, with an interest in college student success and satisfaction. “We don’t always process the impact of racism on mental health,” Dr. Campbell said. “Understanding how racism affects us is crucial for supporting our students.”\n\nOne of the critical topics discussed during the interview was unconscious bias. Dr. Campbell explained how these biases influence perceptions and interactions, often without our awareness. “We all have a ‘cognitive toolbox’ where biases can linger,” she noted. “But by expanding our knowledge and exposing ourselves to different cultures, we can reshape our perceptions.”\n\nDr. Campbell emphasized the importance of intentional exposure to diverse cultures as a means of reducing unconscious bias. “By exposing ourselves and our children to different cultural experiences, we break down barriers,” she said. “It’s not just about acknowledging diversity; it’s about celebrating it.” She encouraged listeners to embrace cultural differences.\n\nAddressing Bennett College’s mission to empower and educate women of color, Dr. Campbell spoke passionately about aligning academic goals with the institution’s core values. “Bennett College is committed to providing an education that fosters leadership and civic engagement,” she stated. “My role is to ensure that we continue to build a community where every student can thrive and succeed.”\n\nDr. Campbell also highlighted the importance of fostering meaningful partnerships and academic initiatives that enhance the educational experience at Bennett College.\n\nIn addition to her academic achievements, Dr. Campbell was recently selected as an American Council on Education (ACE) Fellow for the 2023-2024 academic year. This prestigious fellowship, awarded following a nomination by President Suzanne Elise Walsh, JD and a rigorous selection process, placed Dr. Campbell at Odessa College in Odessa, TX. Under the mentorship of Dr. Gregory D. Williams, she engaged in a transformative year-long leadership development program, further honing her skills, broadening her impact on higher education, and preparing her for academic leadership roles."
