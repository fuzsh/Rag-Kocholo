        "text": "A Note From J. T. Anderton\n\nVP/Managing Director of Duncan's American Radio\n\nIn addition to a lifelong interest in AM tower sites and coverage, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to do more than two years of research in the internal technical file room of the FCC, to gather technical data for my series of coverage map atlases, published by Duncan's American Radio. In addition, I visited more than 2,500 stations in all parts of the country during an 11-year stint as a regional manager for the NAB. I have also photographed more than 1,000 tower sites over the past 20 years. I have talked with radio people and engineers in all parts of the country, and also have had the chance to cross-check the heresay and folklore at the FCC. Given that these towers are so unique, I'm fairly confident that if there are more, I would have come across them by now.\n\nI didn't go into this detail to brag, just to establish that I might be a reasonably reliable source.\n\nHere are the Blaw-Knox diamond cantilever towers still standing (to the best of my knowledge), along with their electrical radiating length (each would be a few feet higher above ground, allowing for base insulators, aiviation beacons, etc.):\n\nWSM, Nashville (650) 800' WLW, Cincinnati (700) 739' WBT, Charlotte, NC (1110) 3 in directional array, 428' each WFEA, Manchester, NH (1370) Taller of two towers in directional array, 350'(second tower is 199') WBNS, Columbus (1460)\n\nWHO in Des Moines had one until the late 1940's, when it was replaced at the same site by the existing uniform cross-section tower. The bottom two-thirds of the old WHO tower was moved to the rear of an Iowa State Police station in Des Moines for use as a communications tower.\n\nThese towers are a special part of radio history. I have visited all of them, and they do make quite a visual impression. Most uniform cross-section towers all but disappear visually against many skyscapes, but not these. Their mass stands out against any color of sky, often resulting in strong visual images. The WLW tower, with the call letters lighted in white at the mid-way point, makes a strong visual impression, especially at twilight.\n\nAll five of the 50-kw transmitters ever used by WLW are still in place at Mason. All five are licensed and capable of full-power operation, including the original water-cooled 1927 Western Electric. This unit was the first 50-kw transmitter to be licensed in the United States. In the 1980's, the engineering staff of then-owner Jacor Communications restored this transmitter to it original operating condition, using parts left on hand by the engineers of longtime owner Crosley Broadcasting.\n\nRandy has a strong sense of the importance of the WLW Mason site in radio history.\n\nI hasten to add that WLW is no relic. It is a living, breathing, 100% local, full-service, ratings and revenue dominant AM radio station (a rarity in this era). According to our Duncan revenue estimates, it is the highest billing radio station outside of the largest markets.\n\nJ T Anderton\n\nDuncan's American Radio\n\nFROM THE BEGINNING\n\nMarch 2, 1922-A broadcast station license for the call letters WLW was issued by the Radio Division of the Bureau of Navigation, U.S. Department of Commerce to the Crosley Manufacturing Company authorizing 20 watts of power on 833 kilocycles. The company, which manufactured \"The Harko\" radio receiving set, was owned by Powel Crosley Jr. who was to be WLW's sole announcer and technician.\n\nAugust 18, 1922-WLW moved from Crosley's home to his new factory building at 1625 Blue Rock St. at B & O right-of-way and was authorized to increase power to 200 watts.\n\nSeptember 1, 1922-WLW began using a newly-installed Western Electric 1-A transmitter, raising the power to 500 watts and changing the operating frequency to 970 kilocycles. For an antenna, the station used two 125 ft. toweers, supporting a 140 foot 12 wire \"T\"-type antenna.\n\nJune 7, 1923-WLW began sharing time on 970 kilocycles with a new Cincinnati station, WSAI. The air slogan used was \"Queen City of the West\".\n\nEarly 1924-WLW used the air motto \"The Station With A Soul\", moving to new quarters at 519 Alfred Street, Cincinnati and raising power to 1000 watts.\n\nMay 1924-WLW changed frequency to 700 kilocycles, but was later shifted to 710 kilocycles to make room for WBAV of Columbos, Ohio. WBAV was re-assigned elsewhere on the dial, later that year.\n\nJanuary 1925-Remodeled, spacious studios were opened at the Crosley factory. WLW was then granted permission to raise power from 1000 watts to 5000 watts.\n\nJanuary 27, 1925-WLW installed a new 5 KW transmitter at Harrison, Ohio where two 200 foot tall towers were erected. Also, that month, WLW's studio location was moved to 3401 Colerain Ave. WLW presented its inaugural from the new studio on 710 kilocycles with 5000 watts of power at 8:00PM that day.\n\nJune 1, 1927-The new Federal Radio Commission assigned WLW to operate on 700 kilocycles, dividing time with WMAF at Dartmouoth, Massachusetts and KFBU at Laramie, Wyoming.\n\nSeptember 4, 1927-WLW became affiliated with the NBC Blue Network.\n\nMay 5, 1928-WLW was granted a construction permit to raise power to 25,000 watts regularly and to 50,000 watts experimentally by the FRC.\n\nOctober 4, 1928-WLW closed the Harrison, Ohio transmitting plant, moving the operation to Mason, Ohio, adjacent to the WSAI site there. A new Western Electric 50,000 watt transmitter was installed in a new building built by WLW there. The antenna was a \"longwire\", running north to south, suspended between two 300 foot towers, 600 feet apart.\n\nOctober 4, 1928-- WLW became the first United States commercial 50 KW station. By the end of that year, four other stations attained the 50 KW power level -- WEAF New York City, WGY Schenactady NY, WBAP Fort Worth TX and KDKA Pittsburgh PA. 1928, thus, became the year of the beginning of regular 50 KW broadcasts.\n\nEarly 1933-WLW began construction of a new, first-of-its-kind 500,000 watt facility at Mason, Ohio with the approval of the FRC. A new $400,000 RCA 500 KW transmitter was installed at the site and a new 831 foot, 136 ton, half wave, Blaw-Knox double diamond-shaped vertical antenna was erected for $46,000. A 75 feet square, concrete lined pond was built in front of the building for transmitter cooling. Water was pumped through specially designed, water cooled tubes, then out through fountains which sprayed the water into the air and into the pond.\n\nJanuary 1, 1934-The FRC authorized WLW to use 500,000 watts on an experimental basis using the call W8XO.\n\nApril 17, 1934-The FRC issued a license to operate at 500,000 watts during regular hours under the WLW call letters.\n\nWednesday, May 2, 1934-WLW began experimental 500 KW broadcasting as Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt threw the switch at the White House desk in Washington D. C. Some saw the WLW call letters as signifying \"Whatta Lotta Watts\".\n\nDecember 21, 1934-WLW was required to cut back to 50,000 watts during the nighttime hours due to interference caused to CFRB at Toronto, Ontario, about 375 miles away.\n\nOctober 1, 1935-New downtown Cincinnati studios were opened in the Union Central Building Annex. WLW's main studios, including the showplace \"Studio A\" with its massive pipe organ (dubbed the \"Moon River Organ\"), remained at 1329 Arlington St. The organ is now located at the Shady Nook Restaurant in Millville, Ohio.\n\nOctober 18, 1935-WLW's 831 tower was struck by an aircraft at the 600 foot level, leaving the tower mechanically undamaged!\n\nEarly 1938-WLW used the air slogan \"The Nation's Station\".\n\nFebruary 28, 1939-WLW reverted back to 50,000 watts of power, ending the superpower experiments, except for the W8XO experimental license, allowing 500 KW operation between 12 midnight until 1:00 AM, which remained in effect until December 29, 1942.\n\nSeptember 1945-The Crosley Corporation was sold by the Powel Crosley interests to \"The Aviation Corporation\", a major industrial manufacturer.\n\nToday-WLW \"Seven-Hundred W-L-W\" is Ohio's second oldest continuously licensed AM broadcast station. It operates on 700 KHZ with 50 KW of power from studios located 1111 St. Gregory St., Cincinnati. The transmitter site remains on Tylerville Rd., Mason, Ohio. Licencee is Jacor Broadcasting of Cincinnati, Inc. with Randy Michaels being the CEO. Randy is known to be quite knowledgable in the technical end of the business. It is a \"Full\n\nService/News/Talk/Sports\" station, with a country music program for truckers after midnight. It runs 24 hours a day and is an affiliate of the ABC Information Network.\n\nThis short synopsis was written, using historical information obtained from Broadcast Pro-File and some other sources. I have left out many names, location changes, frequency changes, power changes and numerous other changes and details in the history of WLW. More detailed information can be obtained from Broadcast Pro-File at:\n\nBroadcast Pro-File 28243 Royal Road Castaic, CA 91384-3028\n\nFor more details on this or other radio station histories, you can write to them for a free catalog of historical radio station documents for very reasonable prices."
