We're a one-hour show, and not just opinion but actual analysis with guests who are experts in their fields. Other shows focus on news and current events, which means they're competing for attention, to beat other shows to the punch or, worse, to shout louder to get noticed. There's no shouting here. We take a broader approach. Our goal is to inform, not see who can shout over the other or out-duel with talking points. Instead, we want to arm our audience—with better information, and more in-depth information than you'll get anywhere else. Why? Because better informed people make better decisions. I Spy Radio is issue oriented. We're not a news show, we're a knowledge show.
