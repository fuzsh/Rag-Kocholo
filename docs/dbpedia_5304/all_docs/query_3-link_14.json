        "text": "Radio stations don’t exist exclusively to play the latest chart toppers on repeat.\n\nThroughout history, #Radio has been a fundamental part of our evolution as a species. When it first arrived, radio was a way to help us stay on top of the latest news from the war. Over time, it emerged as a source of entertainment, and a reliable way to listen to the news.\n\nAs radio stations became increasingly popular, hosts found new ways to connect with their listeners, through call-in competitions and radio dramas.\n\nAlthough music has always had a strong part to play in the growth of radio as a medium, talk radio has been one of the most enduring, and emotionally influential creations of radio technology.\n\nToday, talk radio is still a crucial part of our society, enlightening, engaging, and informing listeners around the world.\n\nHere’s why talk radio is a concept worth discussing.\n\nA brief history of talk radio\n\nBefore we ever had music on the radio, we had voices. People telling us what was happening around the world or keeping us informed on trending topics.\n\nThough music eventually arrived as a way of keeping the masses entertained, the demand for conversation remained strong throughout the years. Talk radio evolved into a genre of its own — often reserved for discussions about politics, culture, and society.\n\nUnlike other forms of radio, talk radio was focused on engaging the listener. People were asked to call in and share their experiences or offer their opinions through polls. Guests were often invited into #TalkRadioStations to add another voice to the conversation too.\n\nUsually, these radio stations each had their own agenda or theme. Calls and conversations were screened to maintain a specific atmosphere, keeping the conversation focused on things like progressive topics, politics, news, or even sports.\n\nThroughout the history of broadcasting, talk shows have remained a common facet of entertainment. Today, the traditional talk radio program has helped to prompt the rise of other media too, such as television panel shows, and podcasts.\n\nThe rise of talk radio even led to the transformation of certain radio stations in the UK. For instance, the London Broadcasting Company became “Leading Britain’s Conversations” — a channel specifically devoted to talk programming.\n\nIn the US, talk-based radio stations gave consumers a way to listen to the messages of politicians, and discuss their ideas about society in a free, uncensored environment.\n\nSo, how has talk radio endured the changing media landscape?\n\nThe continued popularity of talk radio stations\n\nHuman beings are creatures that consistently crave knowledge.\n\nWe love being aware of what’s going on around us. In the early days before radio existed, this meant checking the newspaper every morning for information about what’s going on in the world. However, newspapers were often limited to those who could read. Radio was accessible for anyone, anywhere.\n\n#RadioStations have always concentrated on a unique combination of information and entertainment. While news stories and updates are there to keep listeners informed, talk radio concentrates more on the entertaining impact of creating emotional responses in fans.\n\nWhen you listen to a talk radio station, you tune into a conversation that’s designed to be controversial, topical, and emotionally compelling. More than any other kind of radio program, #TalkRadio creates passion, by making us feel angry, anxious, sympathetic, or even disgusted about what’s happening around us.\n\nThe most popular talk radio stations throughout the years knew that if they wanted to inspire and motivate their listeners, they needed to rile them up. That’s why there are so many stations out there specifically dedicated to addressing the controversial topics that broadcasters would have avoided in the past.\n\nThe good news for today’s radio hosts is that their listeners actually enjoy feeling these strong emotions — even if they’re negative. Getting angry about a specific topic makes us feel like we’re part of a community or committed to a cause. It’s a way to bring societies together. What’s more, many talk radio stations also allow us to have our voices heard on a subject too. We can call in, cast a vote, or say something about how we feel.\n\nTalk radio was one of the very first ways to give the public a voice.\n\nWhat’s next for talk radio?\n\nWhile entertainment, and the way that we collect information, has changed in this modern era, talk radio still remains a popular part of our culture.\n\nMany companies have begun to expand their stations by moving recordings of their programs online or offering podcast versions to long-distance listeners. You could argue that podcasting is the child of talk radio and the next stage in #RadioHistory.\n\nJust like talk radio stations, podcasts are about bringing communities together to listen to discussions about crucial topics. Some podcasts focus on politics and news — similar to their traditional radio counterparts. Others concentrate on more niche subjects.\n\nLike the radio stations that came before them, podcasts also listen to their community through live-streamed messages, social media and more.\n\nThe enduring popularity of podcasts and the fact that talk radio stations like the BBC and LBC still have millions of listeners across the country are testaments to the value that we still see in societal conversations.\n\nJust like when radio first emerged in the world, we’re still turning to this technology as a way of informing ourselves, bringing communities together and more. As consumers continue to look for more ways to make their voice heard, and discuss more important topics, talk radio will only increase in popularity.\n\nTo read more, tune into Radio Fidelity’s full length article here."
