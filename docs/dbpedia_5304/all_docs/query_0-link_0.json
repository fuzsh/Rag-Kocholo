At night, with a good radio, it can be heard in much of North America. WLW serves as the Cincinnati network affiliate for ABC News Radio; the AM flagship station for the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network; a co-flagship station for the Cincinnati Bengals Radio Network; and the home of radio personalities Mike McConnell, Rocky Boiman and Bill Cunningham. The WLW studios are located in Sycamore Township (with a Cincinnati address). The transmitter is a uniquely constructed diamond-shaped Blaw-Knox tower in nearby Mason. Besides its main analog transmission, WLW simulcasts on 99 watt FM translator W233BG at 94.5 MHz and on an HD digital subchannel of co-owned 107.1 MHz WKFS. The station is a primary entry point station in the Emergency Alert System for Southwest Ohio, Kentucky and Eastern Indiana. Launched by industrialist Powel Crosley Jr., WLW became the flagship station of the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation, later a part of Avco. One of four charter affiliates of the Mutual Broadcasting System, WLW holds the distinction of being the only AM radio station ever authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast with a power output of 500,000 watts, which happened in the 1930s.
