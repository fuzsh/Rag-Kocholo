I canât figure out how to get to my favorite artist-based station (can find artist in search, but there doesnât seem to be a station option anymore?) canât find the Recently Played Songs list once Iâm playing a station. Itâs fine to change things, but not in such an extreme way that it appears so nonsensical to even fairly on-top-of-things users that they canât easily find the features that are important to them. I donât know if it was a web app before, but it must be because I donât recall downloading an update and everything is just a little off, not polished and smooth like a native app would be. I expected that sort of thing on a minority platform like WP, but itâs really disappointing to have a worse experience on a brand new iPhone. Anyway, this app is in need of some major organizing/UI changes before it can match the user experience of previous versions. If I have to put in hours curating my stations (which looks like the direction this is going), as opposed to having a variety of stations that are good, just need minor tweaks to be great, Iâd might as well use Pandora!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi there, thanks for providing this feedback about your experience using the iHeartRadio app on your device.
