        "text": "WAPI\n\nBirmingham, AL\n\nKimball 3/8\n\nThe organist at WAPI was none other than Stanleigh Malotte, better known for his work at the Alabama Theatre in Birmingham. The only known recording of Malotte that exists today is an eleven minute demonstration called \"A Walk Through The Organ.\" The tape was released to the public in 1990 as a fundraiser, however, Malotte's first name was mis-spelled as \"Stanley.\" Malotte's bio from Wikipedia appears below and you can hear the recording by clicking here.\n\nCharles Stanleigh Malotte (born September 5, 1901 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – died February 1973 in New York, New York) was the house organist for Alabama Theatre from 1936 to 1955.\n\nStanleigh Malotte came from a musical family; his father, mother, and brother were also musicians. He began violin lessons at six and began taking organ lessons from his church choirmaster at 12.\n\nMalotte first became a theatre organist for Sid Grauman on the west coast, but later got a job with the Paramount/Publix chain and wound up working for Francis Falkenburg at the Olympia Theatre in Miami, Florida. Malotte was in Miami for approximately ten years, doing some work on radio as well as later working as organist at the Capitol Theatre. Falkenburg brought in Malotte from Florida shortly after Falkenburg transferred to the Alabama Theatre. Malotte's first performance at the Alabama was on May 27, 1937.\n\nDuring his time at the Alabama, Malotte was well known for rewriting the lyrics of popular songs of the time with lyrics pertaining to current events, from the local to national levels. He also often selected music to be performed based on the movie being shown. He was also known to drink quite a bit, although some maintain this actually made him a better entertainer. Malotte also played the organ for WAPI-AM from their studios in the Protective Life Building.\n\nIn August 1947 Malotte left his organist job to become a morning disc jockey at radio station WWSW in Pittsburgh. On September 19, The Birmingham News published on its front page a lengthy letter by Malotte that was highly critical of Pittsburgh and its residents, calling them \"dim-witted citizens—a race of robots—human refuse . . . with a complete absence of social consciousness . . . .\" He was fired from his job by program director Fred Joyner the day the letter was published, although Joyner cited Malotte's failure to come to work twice that week as the cause. A few days later, the Alabama announced Malotte would be returning to its organ console on October 2.\n\nAfter leaving the Alabama Theatre in 1955, Malotte was associated with the Hammond Organ Company. He also wrote material for television and commercials. Malotte later returned to his birthplace of Philadelphia. He died of a heart attack in New York City.\n\nWFIL\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nKilgen Opus 5931, a 4 Manual 14 Rank organ installed in 1937. This appears to be an original installation and not a transplant from a theatre.\n\nInformation from Steve Frank stevenfrank@MAC.COM\n\nWhen I lived in Albany from mid 60s-72 that was my main practice organ! I'll send you a private email with a picture. It was WFIL, Philadelphia, 1937 according to the current owner, Al Adair. He and I were both students of Jim Barnett, whose organ it was. He also acquired a number of Skinners and peppered the city with collections of pipework and various consoles (including the 1928 Grace Church, NYC Skinner)\n\nWhen Covenant finally built their 'new' church building, the old building became Fellowship Hall. Jim removed the Kilgen and put it in a building downtown. It got vandalized for the copper wire! He died a number of years ago, and left it to Al.\n\nIn June, 2008, Al wrote me, \"He never got it going, and it sat for years deteriorating. The console is only a shell now; in fact I had to take it apart in order to get it out of the room. The original entrance had been bricked up, so that I had to take it out in pieces through a small door. The relays, wiring, etc. were a hopeless mess. I was planning to sell it this summer. Of course, after all this effort to save it, I'd like to keep it intact. Maybe there's someone out there who will take it on. If there's no interest, maybe I'll piece it out. It's in storage in Cincinnati.\"\n\nHaven't been in touch in a while.\n\nInteresting note, was the exposed Positiv division with some copper pipes that Jim had added. Made it authentic for my Bach\n\nSteve\n\nPHOTO BELOW: Steve at the WFIL organ once it had been moved to Albany, GA.\n\nOn Jul 28, 2011, at 12:06 AM, Terry Charles <hitidesin@YAHOO.COM> wrote:\n\nWhen I was attending a Georgia college, I became involved with the Kilgen Organ from the radio station in Louisville, KY. It was installed in Covenant Presbyterian Church in Albany, Georgia. I was permitted unlimited use of it, tuned it a couple of times and POOF - graduated from college and never saw it again.\n\nWGN\n\nChicago, IL\n\nWurlitzer\n\nThis instrument started out as a 2/7 Wurlitzer. It was installed in the Drake Hotel. It was repossessed from a band leader who defaulted on his payments and resold to WGN. When WGN built their studio in the Tribune Tower. They had Kimball rebuild the organ as a 3/10 adding 3 Kimball ranks. These were defined as Open Diapason with 16 foot extension being diapason and not a Diaphone as Wurlitzer would have done, a church style English Horn and a Clarinet. The organ had two consoles, one in the studio where the chamber was located and one in a remote studio on the first floor. The organist had to listen to the instrument through earphones in the remote studio.\n\nWhen the organ was removed from WGN, the Kimball portions, including the console, were sold to a private individual, and the Wurlitzer portion was installed at Mundelein. The Kimball console and the 16’ Open Diapason were destroyed in a house fire in Wisconsin.\n\nTHE ABOVE INFORMATION, REGARDING THE WGN CONSOLE, WAS CORRECTED BY PAUL@ SZYMKOWSKI.NET ON 8/22/2010. PAUL REPORTS THAT HE HAS THE ORIGINAL CONSOLE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF RESTORING IT. A further report from Jon C, indicates that the Kimball console was sold to Balcom and Vaughn, and that it ended up in Seattle.\n\nA photo of the WGN console\n\nAnother view of the WGN organ courtesy of Jim Lewis.\n\nThe WGN organ was heard into the late 1950’s with staff organist Harold Turner providing program each Sunday morning called \"Pipe Dreams\". After Harold Turner retired, the organ was used infrequently if at all. (see comment from Walt Strony below)\n\nOne notable program that originated from WGN was the Hartz-Mountain program. Jon Habernaas recalls that the program featured live canaries in the studio that were trained to sing along with melodies played by an organist referred to as Gloria and violinist referred to as Gene. Jon tells us that the WGN organ survived much longer than most broadcast organs as it was a favorite of Colonel McCormick and was included in the move from the Michigan Avenue studios to the new broadcast facility on Bradley Court, which was located about a mile NW of the old Riverview Park location at Western and Belmont. The organ was removed from the Michigan Ave studio by Frank Wichlac and Associates and later installed by him in the new studio. Jon had the opportunity to work on the crew during both the removal and new installation. The organ was installed in the larger TV studio at Bradley Place and remained there until WGN-TV decided that the space occupied by the organ chambers could be better used to store the equipment used by the station for the Illinois Lottery. The organ was donated by WGN to the Archdiocese of Chicago which sent it to be added to the theatre organ in the auditorium at Mundelein. The original 7 rank Wurlitzer portion along with the Vibraharp was used and the Kimball portion rest of the percussions were sold to help defray the cost of the installation. The organ had a xylophone and bells originally, but no traps.\n\nTo hear an authentic recording of the WGN organ, as it was heard on the Hartz-Mountain program, click here\n\nAdditionally submitted by John Scott:\n\nYour info about WGN is fine but incomplete. After the TV era began, the Wurlitzer-Kimball was moved out of Tribune Tower to new studios at a suburban location in Chicago, where Harold Turner played it on both radio and TV. At that location it was played by Turner as a featured concert at one of the national ATOS conventions.\n\nAn additional note from Walt Strony:\n\nI am offering a correction / addition about the WGN Organ. I knew Harold Turner quite well and the Executive Vice-President of WGN, Alexander Field was a close friend. I was in contact with both of them (especially Al Field) until they passed away.\n\nAl Field was an organ enthusiast and member of CATOE when I was young and just getting started as a theatre organist. When Harold retired, as you state, the organ wasn't used. There were calls from the public stating that they missed it. Al Field arranged for WGN to hire me to videotape some Christmas music. That music was aired several times in several versions, usually with another choir. To my knowledge, that was the last time the organ was played for broadcast. The director was Orlando White, a black man - so his name will forever be in my brain!\n\nSupposedly the console still exists, having survived a fire, and it is in storage somewhere. (see note above indicating tha the console is now in Seattle WA.\n\nAbove: Harold Turner at the 3 manual WGN console, and below: an ad from the September 29th 1935 Chicago Tribune.\n\nWJJD\n\nChicago, IL\n\nJunchen's information is that Wurlitzer opus 1359, a III/11 originally built for the Drake Theatre, Chicago, was moved to WJJD's studios in 1935.\n\n(contributed by Les Hickory)\n\nHoward L. Peterson also did broadcasts from the Arcada Theatre in St. Charles, IL. over WJJD\n\nWJJD first put on the air in 1924 by J.J. Davies (WJJD) in 1924 at Moosehart, the Moose Club Children's Home, located north of Aurora, Illinois. It was reallocated to Chicago in 1941 and operated on \"limited hours\" from 1941 to 1980.\n\nThe first organ music broadcast over WJJD was the Geneva Marr and Colton 3/16. from the Arcadia Theatre in St. Charles, Il. The original Marr and Colton was a 3/10. Geneva made two modifications to the Marr and Colton with each organist hired after the first. There were two and Howard Peterson being the 3rd. The original Marr and Colton was installed over the summer of 1926 and was ready for the opening on Labor Day in September 1926. Nine months later the organist left and 2nd one wanted changes. 3 ranks and a piano were added to what was a cold air return and would have been a chamber if a larger organ would have been installed. A 2nd blower and relay were added in the basement next to the boiler in a room where the electric service entered the building. One year later Howard was hired. The Marr and Colton console was stationary in the pit. The pit was expanded, a whole dug and a cable lift installed and a new console build by Geneva and design by the theatre owner, who was an artist, was built and installed. Three more ranks were added and installed in the back of the theatre in what was a storage room in the booth area. The Geneva relay that was installed a year ago was added to and the wind from that blower was ran to the back of the house. No other changes were made to the organ after that. We don't know when Howard left, but do know that a Les Doyle played the organ either during WW2 or after. Then the organ was silent for many years until CATOE came in and I became the next paid house organist. 1974 to 1985..\n\nAbove: an ad for the program of organ music featuring the Arcadia Theater's Geneva organ and organist Albert F. Brown.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Jim Lewis)\n\nWLS\n\nChicago, IL\n\nWLS had a 3/12 Barton with a straight console. It lasted into the fifties when ABC bought WLS and terminated the WLS original studios\n\nWLS also had a 1928 Link 2/3 with blower # 21959\n\nThe following information is provided by Jon Habermaas:\n\nJust visited your site about radio organs, great site. WLS and WENR shared the same frequency...WLS broadcasting during the day and WENR at night. WLS was owned by the Prairie Farmer Magazine and was primarily a farm station. One of its prime shows was the WLS Barn Dance Program which originated from the 8th Street Theatre in Chicago. The WLS Barton was on the air until the end of the station as a farm station and the organ was heard daily on a program called the Noon Show with Howard Peterson at the console. WENR was the ABC radio outlet in Chicago and came on the air at dusk with WLS signing off and WENR signing on with the first network program, \"The Lone Ranger\". ABC bought the Prairie Farmer magazine, I suspect to get a full time access to the frequency and that ended the WLS studio on Washington Blvd and the Barton was sold. From what I understand it languished and deteriorated in storage in a barn somewhere in Indiana never to be heard again. The WENR WurliTzer was installed in a studio in the Civic Opera Building where WENR had its' studios. It was a very popular organ with the artists and I understand also a favorite of Samuel Insull, who at that time owned the building and had offices on the floor above the WENR studio.\n\nThe Sunday funnies were also aired on WLS radio with Howard Peterson at the Barton.\n\nHoward Peterson at the WLS Barton.\n\nView the article entitled \"Whatever Became Of The WLS Barton\"\n\nWLS organist Ralph W.

The main organ. Wurlitzer Opus 1001 began as a Style H Special and was enlarged, including the addition of a three manual console in 1929.\n\nThe organ was removed and relocated in the Shady Nook restaurant in Cincinnati. At some point, the restaurant closed and the owners had the power to the building cut off. Which disabled sump pumps and allowed the organ chambers to flood. The crew who removed the organ had to wear masks because of the mold that had formed. There was some question about how much of this organ was actually the WLW organ because of the various additions that had been made in 1929. John Alford obtained some of the pipe work at that time on the chance that they were actually the pipes used at WLW and played by Lee Erwin. During the time at the restaurant, however, the owner swapped out some of the ranks, which clouded the whole matter of what parts were from the original organ. At this time, the Shady Nook Restaurant is in bad condition.\n\nPat Gillick seated at the WLW console in a 1932 photo.\n\nThanks to Dave Burns for the use of this photo\n\nA photo of the Wurlitzer Opus 1001.

Photo is from a 1950s brochure published by the station.\n\nMessage from Charlie Porter regarding KMBC and the above recording:\n\nI have information concerning the KMBC studio organ in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nNot only do I have info, but I have found in my archives the last broadcast studio transcription recording of the organ in Feb. 1951. This recording was loaned to me a number of years ago by the late Don Keilhack, who resided here in San Diego for a number of years, and moved back to his hometown of Kansas City. I copied these recordings onto a high quality TDK hi bias cassette tape (the best available) back in the early 90s. Don took his studio recordings with him when he moved back to KC. He personally new the (then) organist P. Hans Flath. Flath was a well known organist in KC for years. He opened the Loew’s Midland Theatre “Wonder Morton“ in 1929, as well as a very respectable church organist. I have found a picture of Flath, courtesy of the University of Kansas, The Arthur B. Church KMBC Collection . Not sure what might have happened to those original recordings upon Don’s sudden demise, as I lost touch with him after he left SD. In my research at the University Website I found no existence of these particular recordings. Don was also an excellent theatre organist and copied Flath’s style. Being somewhat of a reclusive, he never really did public performances.\n\nThe organ at KMBC was a 3/10 Robert Morton Opus # 23450, not a Wurlitzer. It was an organ transplant from the Wade Hamilton Organ & Piano Studios in Tulsa, OK. installed there in 1929. See page 579 in the Encyclopedia Of The American Theatre Organ Vol. II. Not sure when KMBC acquired it, page 536 (same volume II) has a picture of Ann Reiling (no info on Ann) at the KMBC console in KC. That finish on the console looks to be a ugly thick textured finish. It was a faded almost Army green. Arrrrg!\n\nNow this recording is of good fidelity, except for some LP surface noise. It has now been transferred onto CD. It could easily be “cleaned up” with today’s many digital programs available for computers. However, it is quite listenable and enjoyable. The announcer is Paul Taylor, and he identifies with the station call letters at the end of the late night ½ hour broadcast. But what makes this recording even more eventful and rare is Flath himself comes on at the end with Paul Taylor and they have a friendly exchange about the organs imminent removal, being sure to give the date of this historic broadcast. Apparently more recording was done after the broadcast that evening, as there is another person in the studio which you hear making a request of Flath. Could it have been Flath’s wife? There is even a short cipher noted several tunes later, but Flath plays it out. At the very end of the recording are two selections played at the pipe organ by Flath in the 3rd Christian Science Church of KC, accompanying an unknown soloist.\n\nSadly the KMBC organ was dismantled quickly as the old building was scheduled for demolition. It was seen as not cost effective to re-install and besides, the new station had provided a new Hammond organ and grand piano in it's own studio room for Flath's broadcast. The Morton eventually found it’s final resting place in a barn, on a dirt floor, outside of Kansas City for over 30 years.\n\nWhen it became available, time had taken it’s toll. What remained and salvageable, was rescued by a local member of our Theatre Organ Society of San Diego about 25 years ago. Wood crates with wood pipes had suffered major termite damage. The console was falling apart. But all was packed up and lovingly brought back to San Diego anyway to be parted out like an old junk car. The console was a basket case, but has been rebuilt and brought back to the beautiful original oak finish and is now playing in a home installation here of I believe about 20 ranks. Well there you have it. A real lost treasure!\n\nNow I have also found your site with the recordings of famous broadcast organist, and this recording belongs with them, but I’m not sure who should receive this. If you can give me your address, I can forward this recording on to you. I can mail two, one for you and one for the archive site (Sounds Of American Organs). I also intend to contact the University of Kansas to see if they want a copy for their KMBC archives. I could be wrong, but in my research of their site I don't believe they have this recording. Many studio transcriptions pryor to 1951 seem not to exist.\n\nThanks and best wishes from San Diego!\n\nCharlie Porter\n\nKMOX\n\nSt. Louis, MO.\n\nKMOX had a 2/5 Kilgen Opus #3502 that was installed in 1926. Between 1926 and 1937, the instrument was enlarged to a 4/16 under a succession of jobs that were assigned opus numbers: 4443, 4577, 4816, 5225, 5302 and 5869.\n\nOrganist Ken Wrright at the KMOX console.\n\nAdditional information from Terry Charles: Hi gang... When I was attending a Georgia college, I became involved with the Kilgen Organ from the\n\nradio station in Louisville, KY. It was installed in Covenant Presbyterian Church in Albany, Georgia. I was permitted unlimited use of it, tuned it a\n\ncouple of times and POOF - graduated from college and never saw it again. A side note, going back - while in college, I was responsible for\n\nFred Pillsbury's KMOX Kilgen to be installed in First Methodist Church in Cuthbert, Georgia. THAT organ, console and ALL of its pipework was\n\n\"junked\" according my conversation with the organ company that built a new organ for that church just after I learned of it. QUESTION - did that\n\nAlbany Kilgen organ bite the dust? I cannot find a website for the church. TC\n\nMore from Terry:\n\nHere's the interesting story about how the famed KMOX Kilgen came to rest in the Cuthbert Methodist Church, Cuthbert, Georgia.\n\nI had \"discovered\" in the Covenant Presbyterian Church, Albany Georgia the almost twin to Fred Pillsbury's KMOX Kilgen, the 4/14 Kilgen from WFIL in Philadelphia (after all these years believing that organ was the WHAS Kilgen. Steven Frank substantiates it was really the WFIL Kilgen). Now I have to look at your site and find the WHAS data., Anyway, the story - I wrote to Fred, described everything about the Covenant installation including the added, exposed copper positive. I described the two large chambers under the choir loft floor area. The organ spoke into a hallway sort of area, maybe 6-8 feet deep and the sound reflected upward. I told him what he already knew by his own KMOX Kilgen, that the organ was a POWER house, with a huge scaled Tibia Clausa, 16' Post Horn and Oboe Horn. The strings were gorgeous. The trems did not work or were disconnected. A friend and I tuned it a couple of times while I was in college. Well, Fred wrote to me that he was very impressed with my keen interest in the Kilgen Organs, mentioned he was selling his KMOX Kilgen in preparation to install the Saint Louis Ambassador Wurlitzer. I hadn't had the chance to write back when on a Saturday afternoon, my girlfriend, Carolyn Milner and I were seated in the town's only movie theatre when on the screen in little letters came the words \"Terry Charles Come To The Box Office\". Startled, I went as fast as I could and they gave me the phone... it was FRED! He again commented on my keen interest in the pipe organ and said \"IF YOU CAN FIND A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION YOU MAY SELECT THE PLACE FOR MY ORGAN TO GO TO AND I WILL PAY FOR INSTALLATION.\" I'm sure I didn't sleep and my grades probably suffered... but I wasn't happy with the hierarchy of the College (which had a Hammond Model D I think it was) and ruled the college out immediately. Trellis Case was the music professor at the college AND the organist at the Cuthbert Methodist Church of which I was a member. So I told Trellis about the whole thing and we went before the board and they accepted the offer. The church had an old tracker organ in terrible condition. When the organ came for installation it was summer and college was out for the time. When fall arrived and I returned I found the installation a success in every way... except the console was SO big it had to be placed on the floor outside the choir loft. And then years later I returned to play it and I remembered it was LOUD... LOL And more years later, I was informed by friends in Cuthbert that the church has a new Greenwood Pipe Organ. I immediately contacted them and was told ALL was junked...\n\nSo, there you have it!\n\nAll the best,\n\nTerry\n\nwww.kirkorgan.com\n\nNBC Studios Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles, CA.\n\nThe following was submitted by Mr. Jack Bethards:\n\nNBC Studios, Hollywood. The first stand-alone NBC Studio was buillt at 5515 Melrose Avenue right near the Paramount lot. It was a beautiful art deco building and still exists as a television studio. I don't believe it had a pipe organ. It is possible that they may have used the Paramount Studio organ for broadcasts since it was literally a walk-away. That may also be the reason that they acquired the Paramount organ for their San Francisco building since they may have been familiar with it. (The Melrose building had a very fascinating history. Radio grew so quickly that this 1935 building was obsolete by 1938. It was then used by KHJ and the Mutual Don Lee Broadcasting System, then by Capitol Records and later by a succession of radio and television stations.)\n\nThe 1938 NBC building was a magnificent plant with many large auditoriums It is certainly one of the finest studios ever built. Strangely enough, given the lavish expenditure on the property, it is surprising that they had a hybrid organ made up for their studio G. The basis of it was the KPO San Francisco Welte organ. To it was added a lot of Wurlitzer material to the specifications of Paul Carson. The organ was installed by Charlie Hershman and Henry Pope. Later, Charlie left the job and Henry Pope finished it along with his helper Will Knights. I met Henry Pope at NBC and I knew Mr. Knights as well. That organ was one of the most famous radio organs because it became the One Man's Family and Bridge to Dreamland organ after those shows moved from San Francisco to Hollywood. That organ was later acquired by Paul Michelson and I'm not sure where it is now. It has been well documented in the theatre organ magazines from time-to-time.\n\nHenry Pope at the NBC Studio organ in Los Angeles\n\nNBC RADIO CITY STUDIOS\n\nSan Francisco, CA.\n\nLocated at the 111 Sutter Street Studio on the 22nd Floor of the Hunter-Dublin Building (1929) Six rank, 2 Manual Robert Morton from the Don George Teaching Studios. See an article from the June 9, 1929 local newspaper about the purchase of the Robert Morton organ here. Thanks to Jim Lewis for submitting the article.\n\n1942: at the new 420 Taylor Street studios: Wurltizer (Opus 464) 210SP 19 rank 3 Manual. Original 1921 installation from the Paramount Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nThe following exerpt, written by Mr Jack Bethards, gives a picture of the relationships between local studios of network affiliates and the actual network production centers in large cities.\n\nNBC Network, San Francisco. It is important to separate networks local station studios. In big cities they were often separate. Until 1927, NBC programs originated from KPO, their local red network affiliate. In 1927, NBC built a large network complex on the 22nd floor of the Hunter-Dulin building at 111 Sutter Street. From here they broadcast both on their red and blue networks (the local blue network affiliate was KGO and I don't believe it ever had a pipe organ.) In 1927, NBC bought an organ from the Don George theatre organ teaching studio and had it installed at 111 Sutter. It was a Robert-Morton two-manual, 6-rank job very highly unified. This organ was used on the famous network programs, One Man's Family and Paul Carson's Bridge to Dreamland. By 1935, most network production had moved to Hollywood. In 1942, the organ was sold to Charles Hershman, who removed it and re-installed it in 1944 with some modifications at St. Paul's Community Church in South San Francisco. It is currently being re-located to the Western States Museum of Broadcasting in Ashland, OR.\n\n(Above: A 1929 photo of Elmer Crowhurst at the 6 rank Morton in the 111 Sutter Street NBC Studios. This organ provided the music for the long-running NBC serial \"One Man's Family\" and Paul Carson's \"Bridge to Dreamland\")\n\nThe following information on Elmer Crowhurst was provided by his grand-daughter:\n\nFrancis Elmore Crowhurst born 19 May 1890 Oakland, CA. He married Melva Amelia Pringle on the 10 of February 1911 in Seattle, WA. He hated the name Francis so he used Elmor instead, not sure why he left off the final e. But it was frequently misspelled as Elmer. When he was between engagements, he advertised in the trade papers using F.E. Crowhurst possibly to save the cost of the ad.\n\nMr. Crowhurst's grand-daughter interviewed her grandmother Melva Crowhurst in 1980 about her grandfather's musical history. This is what she related:\n\n1914-1921 he played organ at the Imperial Theater, which is now United Artists Theater, S.F.\n\n1920 for 4-5 weeks he played organ in the Mission Theater in Los Angeles – the movie was Rudy (Rudolph) Valentino & the Four Horsemen.\n\nHe then moved to the Pantages Theater (Vaudeville) and played piano, then a few more weeks at the Million Dollar Theater all in L.A.\n\nThe family then returned to S.F. Where he played with the Wally Lind Orchestra first at the Hof Brau restaurant on Market St at 4th, here he played both piano and organ. 1922 he played at the New Mission Theater for a few years. Grandma was proud that Mayor Rolfe and others stayed after the movie to listen to Grandpa play. 1923 The family moved to Santa Cruz to play at the New Santa Cruz Theater. (During this time he was offered a job in Honolulu but turned it down after he discovered he couldn't bring his car).\n\n1929 He moved to radio work – first played on Charlie Marshall's Hillbilly Band (he played the Jew's Harp) and for One Man's Family at NBC radio. He played the Theme Music “Memory Lane”. Vera Vey played Barbara Jo Allen the little girl in Memory Lane. Baton Yarboro was an actor on OMF and ILAM. At the 3rd anniversary of NBC radio in S.F. Mel got to dance with Carlton E. Morse, who was writer of One Man's Family. He later married and he and his wife wrote “I Love a Mystery” together.\n\n1930 or 31 – For 8 months he had a ½ hour organ concert at 11 to 11:30 pm, also on NBC radio, later the show became Paul Carson's Bridge to Dreamland.\n\nNote: When he was playing at NBC (KPO) they did not have many good selections of saxophone solos so he wrote “Melva” a Volks Caprice type of waltz. He also played on the first Jaquard type player piano rolls that allowed style to be added to the music.\n\nFrancis Elmore \"Elmer\" Crowhurst in tux.\n\nPaul Carson, composer of \"Patricia\" and organist for the One Man's Family program at undetermined console.\n\nClick here to listen to Paul Carson playing One Man's Family program lead-in and closing\n\nIn 1942, NBC opened what was probably the most modern and perfect ra ever built at 420 Taylor Street. It also housed local stations KPO (later KNBC, later KNBR) and KGO. It was a modern-style building and still exists although the interior has been converted into office use. For studio B in that building they acquired, and Charles Hershman installed, the very fine Wurlitzer opus 2035 of 1929 from the Famous Players - Paramount Motion Picture Studio in Hollywood. This is the instrument mentioned in your Radio City Studios (NBC) citation. You mention the same instrument under KNBC, but KNBC never had a pipe organ of its own and should not be listed. (By the way, the NBC building was known as the Radio City of the West.) This organ was sold to Richard Simonton and installed with additions in his North Hollywood home.\n\nKNX\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nWurlitzer 3 manual 11 rank Styke F Opus 1516 from the Capitol (Legion) theatre in Walla-Walla WA.\n\nThis is the original Wurlitzer Opus Walla Walla Legion (Capitol) theatre Wurlitzer that was installed in KNX by Balcom and Vaughan in 1937\n\nKNX was located near to Columbia Square. At some point, CBS purchased KNX and made it their flag ship station, so performers were often seen running across the parking lot between studios.\n\nMr. Jack Bethards has kindly submitted information on KNX as follows:\n\nKNX, Los Angeles. The organ you list for KNX should be listed as CBS-Columbia Square, Studio 4. This as a CBS network facility primarily and also housed their local affiliate KNX. Before that facility was built in 1937, KNX had its own studio down the street on Sunset that housed a three-manual, 10-rank Robert-Morton. That studio was taken over by KMPC subsequently and I'm not sure whether they kept the organ or not. It is now a restaurant and the organ is gone.\n\nSupplement to Mr. Bethard's comment above: The original KNX studio on Sunset, later became a Spaghetti Factory restaurant. That has now closed and the building was demolished.\n\ne.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Jim Lewis\n\nAbove: The 3 manual Robert Morton organ at the old KNX studio in Hollywood. The studio later became KMPC and then it was gutted to become an Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant. The facility has since been demolished.\n\n.\n\nAbove and below are performers Phil Olman and Margaret Hart who had a program called\n\n\"You're In The Act.\" T he pictures are from KNX and date from Feb. 19, 1946.\n\nThe above photo shows Ivan Ditmars at an unidentified Balcom and Vaughan console.. According to Tom DeLay, (see below), this is not the correct console for KNX. The original console, according to Mr. DeLay, would have looked more like the console shown at the top of this page.. We have left the above photo in place simply because it does show Mr. Ditmars. In the years after World War II, Mr. Ditmars served as an orchestral conductor and music director for network programs, the most notable being \"Escape\".\n\nTo hear a 1997 Chuck Schaden interview with Ivan Ditmars, click HERE\n\nINFORMATION ON KNX WAS FURTHER SUPPLEMENTED IN JULY OF 2011 WITH THE FOLLOWING FROM TOM DELAY :\n\nI was again looking at your list of radio studio pipe organs and there is a conflict on the Los Angeles KNX (Columbia Square) organ.\n\nI see Jack Bethards has correctly added some information regarding the CBS Columbia Square organ. However, there is more to the story and likely far more than you will ever need!\n\nFirst of all, KNX/CBS Columbia Square had a 2/5 Kilgen organ opus 4931, 2/5 installed in 1932.\n\nThe photo you have showing Ivan Ditmars at the 3m \"KNX\" console isn't correct. The KNX console is much more like the KOMO Seattle console with Ed Zollman, Sr. which you show near the top of your page.\n\nIn 1937, Balcom and Vaughn sold KNX/CBS Columbia Square Hollywood the style F 2/8 from Walla Walla, WA. B &V rebuilt the original 2m F console into a 3m with rather simple somewhat crude moderne lines. Two unit chests from the Kilgen were used to add a Gottfried English Horn and Gottfried Brass Trumpet. The original style F Clarinet was removed and a Gottfried \"Bell\" Clarinet was put in the spot where the Wurlitzer set had been. The Junchen list says this organ was a 3/11. It was not. It was a 3/10 but B & V did purchase the 3 ranks from Gottfried for this organ.\n\n(CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO THE DEDICATION PROGRAM OF KNX COLUMBIA SQUARE ORGAN IN 1937, WITH EDDIE DUNSTEDTER AT THE CONSOLE)\n\nHEAR IVAN DITMAR PLAY AN EPISODE OF \"FRONTIER TOWN\" ON THE KNX ORGAN\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Evening Express December 17, 1925. Page 14\n\nWhen KNX/CBS Columbia Square got rid of the organ, the console was sold to Marguerite Moore in Porterville, CA for her hybrid 3/18 organ. The balance of the KNX organ was installed in the Filmore Presbyterian Church (now Filmore Bible Church.) The two Kilgen chests were sold to George Wright for use in his Pasadena studio organ (that burned in 1970.) To replace the Kilgen chests, Richard Villemin of Porterville added a Wurlitzer style 165 from the El Campanile Theatre Antioch, CA. He placed the English Horn (where the 165 Vox Humana had been) and Brass Trumpet (where the 165 Trumpet had been) on this chest and retained the rest of the style 165 ranks. With the B &V KNX console sold to Mrs. Moore, Richard Villemin installed a 3m Moller console from the Hillstreet Theatre in Los Angeles. As far as I know, the KNX/Columbia Square organ is still installed in Filmore. The Moore organ was donated to Fresno Pacific University in 1981 and installed there in 1982 where it and the B & V console remains.\n\nEventually, the 3/18 or 20 Wurlitzer from one of the LA sound-stage studios (can't recall which one right now) to replace the B & V adapted style F. The 3/18-20 Wurlitzer was never installed at Columbia Square and was sold to Actor Joseph Kearns (Mr. Wilson on Dennis the Menace TV show in the early 1960s.) Upon Kearns' death in 1962, this organ was taken over by Robert Carson in the Kerns' home. The organ has since been installed in the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, OH.\n\nI realize this is far more info than you need for your radio organ page, but this is what I learned and experienced from working with the late Dick Villemin (1919-1987) and also in helping him service the former KNX organ in Filmore, CA.\n\nTom DeLay\n\nSalinas, CA\n\nSupplement from Jim Lewis:\n\nI really enjoy reading through your page on radio station organs. Attached is a photo of the 3/10 Robert-Morton that was in the KNX studios in Hollywood. This was before Columbia Square was built. This studio later became KMPC, then was gutted on the interior to become The Old Spaghetti Factory. It was demolished not long ago.\n\nRegards,\n\nJim Lewis\n\nWSMK\n\nDayton, Oh\n\n1933 Wurlitzer Style \"E\" Sepcial (Opus 1750)\n\n(had previously been incorrectly listed as a Style \"R\"\n\nNote by the present owner of the organ, John Scott:\n\nThanks very much for all your work in compiling the info about Radio Station organs. As a person interested in this sort of history, I had thought of starting such a project myself. I am glad to see that you included WSMK among the Ohio stations. However, I am curious as to your source(s) of information about Wurlitzer Opus 1750, since the listing as style R is not correct. The Wurlitzer lists compiled by Judd Walton, updated in 1973, indicate that its designation should be Style E Special. It was a special because it had an extra rank, and because it had a player. I now own this organ, and the small relay for the player is still with it, because that small relay makes a nice pedestal for one of the switch stacks.\n\nWhen I acquired Opus 1750 about 1970, I made a trip to Dayton with a friend, and we researched microfilms of Dayton newspapers in the 1927 period. The Wurlitzer lists indicate initial shipment to \"A New (LH Cox) Theatre\". What we found were articles and advertising for the Palace Theatre, LH Cox, Manager, which opened December 25, 1927. Another interesting bit was that the theatre was for African-American patrons. We then traveled out to the site and found the building still there, although without heat or electricity, and clearly doomed. I took a color picture of the exterior, which I later had enlarged to an 8\" x 10\" size. We were able to find an agent, who let us in,and with flashlights we saw the auditorium and a big hole in the wall on stage left where the single chamber organ installation had once been.\n\nThe Wurlitzer listings indicate Moby's Department Store in Columbus as the next stop for Opus 1750 before it reached WSMK. However, I contacted noted Columbus organist Roger Garrett about that, and have a signed letter from him stating that to the best of his knowledge the Wurlitzer was never installed there. He stated that he played a Moller at Moby's.\n\nThe Moby's thing, however does indicate another possible interesting article for T.O. mag, namely department stores that had organs. Another one that I know of was the Herz store in Terre Haute, Indiana, which had a Barton of a few ranks; it later went to a church, and after that to an individual.\n\nIn my Email to you in early 2007, I mentioned a radio station organ in Toronto which I thought was a Casavant. However, I have since confirmed that it was built by the Franklin Legge firm, another Canadian builder of some note. An interesting sidelight about that is that the Legge organ was sold to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at auction in 1923 from the Casa Loma mansion where our Canadian friends now have the Wurlitzer."
