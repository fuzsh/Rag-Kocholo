        "text": "Regarding:Ray 24-Oct-2007 03:08\n\nAbout WBUS, 93.9 FM. The studios were with WMBM, but the transmitter was on the tower at the Deauville Hotel at 6701 Collins Ave. In about 1979 or 80 I helped move the transmitter out of the roof of the building. This was about the time it became Love 94. After years of losing money with Jazz, love music made a profit. Jazz and Classical music fans are very vocal, but not wanted much by advertisers. That's why WTMI finally sold out.\n\nThe red and white tower was still on the Deauville the last time I saw the building.\n\nAfter the Deauville, I think Love 94's transmitter went to One Biscayne and then the 1000 foot Gannet tower near 441 and County Line road when it was built in the early 1980s.\n\nThe FM on the Deauville was WEAS 94.9 not WBUS 93.3. That was my old station, Gannett bought WINZ and WEAS and moved the FM to one Biscayne in 1978 changed to WINZ-FM ZETA4, WBUS was on the WMBM AM tower and they along with 105.1 (then beautiful music) joined ZETA on the pole on One Biscayne. That only worked for 6 years when we built Gannett Tower and everyone moved. Rick EdwardsDear Visitors:\n\nOur dear friend Don Boyd passed away on Wednesday, Sept. 27th after battling pancreatic cancer. Those of us who got to know Don will miss him deeply.\n\nIn speaking with his wife (Karen) this evening, she was unsure who would be administering this site in the future, but was open to suggestions.\n\nIf you have the time, inclination and desire to keep this site up-to-date as best as possible, please contact Karen through oldmiamimemories(at) gmail (dot) com - perhaps you can be the helping hand she will need.\n\nThe site is paid up for a number of years, but right now no one will be monitoring it or adding any photo archives.\n\nRest in peace, Don...HI..I USED TO BE THE DJ ON WTTT IN CORAL GABLES FLORIDA BACK IN THE 50S..I WENT UNDER THE NAME OF SY THE GUY..AND DID A R AND B SHOW. I THEN DID THE SHOW IN ATLANTIC CITY NEW JERSEY FOR TWO YEARS FROM A CLUB CALLED MACS TAVERN.AND THEN DID TV SHOWS ON DUMONT.I DONOT KNOW IF ANY OF MY FRIENDS IN BROADCASTING ARE STILL ALIVE IF SO THEY CAN REACH ME AT walomi7713@att.netIn the 1950s I used to go downtown to the Biscayne Terrace Hotel studios of WINZ and answer phones for Jerry Wichner, my favorite DJ. Also \"worked\" for him at WGMA n Hollywood some years later. I tried to Google an image of him and surprisingly found nothing at all. Does anyone possibly have a photo of him lurking or lingering around the house? Thanks, Don AdamsHi everyone! Is there a place online where I can hear South Florida Radio jingles from the first half of the 1970s (between the breakup of the Beatles and the onset of Disco). During my high-school years I listened to WMYQ, WQAM, WFUN, Y100, WGBS, WIOD (especially the Dolphin games) and tuned in to WWOK for the Bob Griese Show.\n\nIf anyone remembers, the summer of '72 was the ultimate year for S.Fla talk radio (e.g., WKAT--the talk of Miami, Alan Courtney on WIOD), with both parties having their conventions on Miami Beach (Zippies in Flamingo Park, Nixon-McGovern, Jane Fonda, etc.). Wow.\n\nI tried the links at the top of this forum, but I'm trying to find that particular time period. Thanks for any help! :)Bob Green, former WINZ disc jockey and husband/manager of singer Anita Bryant, passed away on January 26, 2012. From the Vintage South Florida Radio Yahoo Group:\n\n\"We also lost Bob Green, former husband of Anita Bryant, on January 26th. Bob was the first jock in Miami to take a major MOR station to a top 40 format at night. He was on WINZ when he met Bryant, and the rest is history.\"\n\nA far more detailed story is located at:\n\nhttp://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2012/02/onetime-disc-jockey-bob-green-anita-bryants-husband-during-1977-gay-rights-battle-dies-at-80.html#storylink=misearch\n\nDon Just a quick note re. Jerry Wichner, WINZ:\n\nI remember drifting off to sleep nearly every night (ca. 1955) when I was a lovestruck teenager whose girlfriend was too enthralled with her science teacher to pay much attention to him. Needless to say, I was depressed, but Jerry's reassuring presence on WINZ's airwaves was the comforting influence that helped me pass many lonely hours on those hot summer nights.\n\nWe seldom realize how we affect those around us, and how important that can be. Jerry surely never knew of me, but I can testify that his friendly, reassuring on-air presence generated powerful and positive effects. Now, at 70 I appreciate that Karma is a very powerful force that should never be underestimated. Disregard it at your peril.\n\nJerry, wherever you are, I'm sure your Karma has been good for you, and I am glad. I hope to emulate your example during whatever time I have left on this good earth.I have a memory of WQAM with Rick Shaw as DJ. Was going to work listening to the radio; Rick Shaw said he needed someone to put some money in his parking meter on Biscayne Blvd. Then come to the station and you can win a prize. I found his car, went to the station, think I was put on the air and won a transistor radio, wow! I worked at a bank nearby and some employees heard me on the air. What a memory back in the day. Loved listening to Rick Shaw. Thanks for your website.More on the death of CHARLIE MURDOCK:\n\nFrom: http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/86141/former-wlw-gm-owner-charlie-murdock-dies\n\nFormer WLW GM, Owner Charlie Murdock Dies\n\nJanuary 20, 2011 at 4:21 AM (PT)\n\nCondolences to family and friends of former DJ, PD, GM and station owner CHARLES K. (CHARLIE) MURDOCK, who died SUNDAY (1/16) in FLORIDA at 78, according to the CINCINNATI ENQUIRER.\n\nMURDOCK started his career while at the UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA at the school's WRUF, then, after serving in the military and serving as PD and officer in charge for ARMED FORCES RADIO SERVICE stations in KOREA, he worked on the air at WRVA-A/RICHMOND and WQAM-A/MIAMI, where he became PD and OM.\n\nHe was named FM at WSAI-A/CINCINNATI in 1965 and moved to crosstown WLW-A as VP/GM in 1967. In 1976, MURDOCK's QUEEN CITY COMMUNICATIONS bought WLW and WSKS, selling the stations in 1983. He later produced television programming airing on ESPN, LIFETIME, USA NETWORK and local CINCINNATI CBS affiliate WKRC-TV and ABC affiliate WCPO-TV.\n\n.Former WQAM 560AM program director and disk jockey CHARLIE MURDOCK passed away on January 16, 2011, at Panama City, Florida where he was visiting friends. Charlie worked at WQAM in the 1950's and 1960's. I remember meeting Charlie at numerous WQAM events in the 1960's and he was always nice to his young fans.\n\nAn article about his passing is at:\n\nhttp://news.cincinnati.com/article/AB/20110118/NEWS0104/101190355/\n\nRIP Charlie. I'll always remember your voice on the late afternoon drive time shift at Tiger Radio, you having your daughter Martha Sue saying things on the air and your promotional ads for Flynn's Dixie Ribs on Dixie Highway in South Miami.\n\n.Richard Minor, the guy who made the counterfeit WQAM Beatles record, did a masterful job. Both were pressed on vinyl (not styrene), and the labels match pretty closely (though the original is a very slightly different shade of orange). The biggest difference is in the dead wax etchings, between the grooves and the label. Both are hand-etched, but the original has no spaces between the WQ and 1096. The counterfeit has the letters and numbers a little farther apart.\n\nI wrote about Maximillian the Mechanical Money Monster in my Florida garage bands book, \"Savage Lost\". The word that \"stopped\" Maximillian was \"Snickelfritz\".A memory of a more inocent time........... WFUN scattered plastic medicine bottles around the entrances to my public school around 1960 or 61. In each was a faux Rx with a number on it and labled \"Dr FUN\"........ we scrambled for them like Easter eggs. I think they announced the numbers on air for prizes if you called in when your number was called.Welcome Johnny, I'm glad you found the website and I thank you for posting. It's great to know that a North Miami High grad really made it big! : ) My wife graduated from North Miami long after you and her dad taught there in the 60's. Perhaps with you commenting here it will attract some of your old buddies and maybe they'll leave some comments also.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDonHi Don\n\nSurprised to see John Powell menion me on your website. I got my start in radio in Miami...Quite a thrill since I was in the first graduating class at North Miami high School and Miami is my home town. From there on to Rochester NY, Cleveland at WHK, New York City at 1010 WINS..KYA in San Fransisco and finally here in Washington DC for the past 40 years where I have have been broadcasting for ABC Sports and the University of Maryland Football and Basketball teams as well as the Washington Nationals.\n\nReally enjoying looking at your site and seeing so many familiar names, Buddies of mine such as Rick Shaw, Charlie Murdock, Jerry Wichner, who I used to file record for, Gene Weed, Jimmy Dunlap and the list goes on and on.\n\nAll the best\n\nJohnny Holliday (Bobbitt)\n\nwww.jholliday.com\n\njholliday6@aol.comBelieve it or not, family of a friend of mine from Lakeview Elementary won a Mustang convertible from WQAM. Beautiful car - she'd drive me home in it. It was that contest where you kept an orange styrofoam ball on the end of your radio antenna and the radio's car would spot you, stop you and give you prizes. Rick Shaw himself stopped her Mom while she was out shopping.\n\nImagine doing that these days?In the fifties, Jerry Wichner of WINZ would play Rock-and-Roll on his program and also travel around town broadcasting at venues for dance contests. Later on, he tamed down his music on a late night show, and would always sign off with an unidentified haunting melody that remained in my head for about 45 years until with the help of friends it was identified as Hugo Winterhalter's \"Fandango\".Great memories. In 1948 I was hired by a little AM station located on SW 2nd at the river, called WWPB. I did production for a show called Requestfuly Yours. Requests and dedications were only taken by Western Union Telegrams. The on air personality was Jack McCormack. I left there after a few years to work for WVCG in the Gables at a show that was supposed to be African American, but the DJ was white, although he did sound black. His name was Sy The Guy. A couple of years of that and we were bought as a package to bring the show to Atlantic City. A fun place but way before the legal gambling. I really enjoyed every second I spent growing up in Miami of the 40's and being an adult there in the 50's. Wally Reed (Sy the Guy) if you are still around, try edtalkingbird@mail.com.Don,\n\nWonderful website, and connects many of the dots for me, as one who grew up in S. Fla., now\n\nliving in Atlanta.\n\nThe WGBS ad includes Red Barber! I seem to recall he did some of the early Dolphin games,\n\nwith Mel Allen, of all people! Also, the famed sportscaster Johnny Holliday got his start in Miami radio,\n\nand was a graduate of North Miami High--didja know?I remember the mechanical money monster on the call-in contests but I never would have remembered the name. I'm sure I won $5.60 when I lucked out and got through despite the delay that Hialeah callers endured when calling from certain telephone exchanges.\n\nRick Shaw was the DJ who ended his show with Ray Peterson's \"Goodnight My Love\" and that is mentioned somewhere on this site. Rick has his own gallery on this site including photos from his retirement party. He still does commercials, still works with the Majic Children's Fund, and still emcee's area high school reunions for classes smart enough to hire him.\n\nDon\n\nI just started looking at this area of the site. I posted the comment about Maximillian the Mechanical Money Monster. I'd also like to add that I saw the comments from 2007 regarding hearing \"Goodnight My Love\" at 9:00 PM every night. That was the signoff song for a dj I don't remember the name of. I heard it every night before I went to sleep (strict home rules). I believe it was sung by Paul Peterson (Donna Reed Show?).Here's a weird memory from around 1963. Anyone besides me remember Maximillian the Mechanical Money Monster? It was a contest run by WQAM. They would announce the contest, you'd call in and if you were the first caller you'd play. The game was a tape recorder calling out amounts of money, from $.56 to $56.00. I was listening one day and they announced that they would take the next caller from Broward County, but in the middle changed it to Dade. Since I had already dialed and hadn't hung up yet I got through. The DJ was Charlie Murdock. Maximillian started, and you needed to call out \"gimme.\" The next amount stated by Max was what you won. I said \"Gimme\" and ended up with the second highest prize, $25.60. Charlie the DJ asked what I was going to do with the money, and I told him (with my mother's urging in the background) that I was going to spend it in NYC on vacation. I was on the original airstaff of The Mighty Bus when they first signed on the air. I did weekend shifts 12Noon-6pm Saturday and Sunday for the first 6 months after they signed on. Alan Margolis hired me, because I had all the records they would be playing. Later We were joined by Mick Dean, Sandy Thompson, Boston Bob Perry and others I can't quite remember. I ended up going to work at Tone Distributors and have been a record promo rep for 40 years.\n\nDavid NewmarkTo Ray V:Hi Ray,\n\nNice to see your (old) post about the WBUS antenna being on top of the Deauville. That was not the Bus's stick, it was WAEZ which had a studio in basement lobby of the Deauville Hotel. The Bus radiated from the WMBM Quarter wave stick located right behind the WMBM WBus studios and 814 First St. When we moved the station (WBUS)across the street, it was then that we moved the stick to the top of the tower one site in downtown. Les Goldberg was the chief at the time. When I switched format to Love 94, I hired Roy Pressman as chief.\n\nHope that clears that one up for you.\n\nAlso, my pilot for my stint at doing WFUN's traffic reports from 4679X Dick Richard, where are you buddy....? I am easy to find.I was at CGHS in the 1950s and I remember listening to an R&B station with a (presumably) African-American DJ who liked to recite little rhymes between songs. Three that I remember were:\n\n\"Ain't nuthin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees,\n\nAnd they wouldn't be shaken if it wasn't for the breeze\"\n\n\"Ain't nuthin' cookin' but the peas in the pot\n\nAnd they wouldn't be cookin' if the water wasn't hot.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Ain't the house rocker Momma, ain't the house rocker's son\n\nBut I'll sure keep you rockin' 'til the house rocker comes.\"\n\nIf anyone remembers this DJ's name and/or the call letters of the station, please let me know so I can credit him online.What a great site....I \"won\" a job at the old WCKR in 1962 when i was a senior in high school....myself and a girl from NBM High both worked on the old Rick Shaw show taking dedications, reading top 10 lists, etc....what a great experience...we were known as Don and Diane. Worked with Roby, Sonny Hirsch, Larry King, Sid Knight....I moved to NC in 1973 but still think fondly of those days....Needless to say, hanging around those guys, I grew up quickly. *I still have some of the old 45s disc jockey copies that they gave after they left the play list....i can be reached at donlawrence@gaston.k12.nc.us .... would love to know what happened to Diane....thanks....great memories reading thisReaders, I received this e-mail seeking information on a WQAM Beatles Interview 45 record that was released during the Beatles invasion of America. If anyone knows anything about this can you please respond with your knowledge? Thanks\n\nDon\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n12/30/08: I found your site while searching for the impossible. I have been looking for a Picture of a WQAM Beatles Interview 45 that has been verified as Original. I have seen many (and own 3) but cannot authenticate them. Even the 560 web site isn't sure. \"Experts\" claim if it has a flat on top of back label then it is counterfeit. I was hoping since you had a web site that you could ask your followers and maybe someone could send pictures and help out an old man in Tucson. Thanks!\n\nDave - H82Type@cox.net\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~During the early 70's, my dad worked for WQAM after they went off the air (I think it was early Sunday morning, 1 AM). He did work at the studio and he took me with him a few times. One evening we went out to the old transmitter behind the Miami Herald. Walked out to the tower. What fun that night was. Later I recorded him, after testing, saying this is \"WQAM, Miami, signing off\". Wish I still had that tape...Random Recalls... In the early '70s, WQAM and WFUN were pretty dominant for Top-40, but got serious competiton with the arrival of WMYQ-FM. Their party was in turn spoiled by WHYI-FM (\"answer your phone by saying 'I listen to the new sound of Y-100 and win!'\"). Being right next door on the dial, it was tempting for listeners to jump back-and-forth if they didn't like what was playing. MYQ's afternoon DJ, Robert L Collins, would 'burrp' during the half-second silence after the classical intro of ELO's \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and close each show with \"Sergeant Pepper.\" WFUN's night DJ Jefferson Stone had his \"how does a sweathog...\" jokes and anti-Donny-Osmond routines. During evening, the sound quality of WFUN would go down... maybe they went to low power? --X1WFUN recently had a reunion. You can see some of your favorite DJs from your past here:http://appleson.com/WFUN%20Reunion%20Main.htm\n\nAnd if you're more into Country music and remember stations like WWOK, there was a radio reunion for them too: http://appleson.com/WWOK%20Reunion%20Main.htm\n\nGreat to see many of our local radio talent still around and doing well.\n\nRay IF YOUR TRULY OLD TIME MIAMI ROCK AND ROLL RADIO YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT IT ALL STARTED AT WFEC WITH TJ THE DJ AND OTHERS . WMBM WAS ALSO A EARLY FACTOR . IT WAS BLACK MAN MUSIC WITH A DIFFERENT SOUND. BUT THEN , WE IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY STARTED CATCHING THE FEVER. THEY WERE BLAZING NEW TRAILS BEFORE QAM & INZ GOT HOT. WE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER JERRY WICHNER'S LATE NIGHT SIGN OFF SONG AT WINZ.. \"THE OLD MASTER PAINTER FROM A FAR AWAY PLACE\" THEN CAME RICK SHAW AND BOB GREEN AND THE REST IS HISTORY.About WBUS, 93.9 FM. The studios were with WMBM, but the transmitter was on the tower at the Deauville Hotel at 6701 Collins Ave. In about 1979 or 80 I helped move the transmitter out of the roof of the building. This was about the time it became Love 94. After years of losing money with Jazz, love music made a profit. Jazz and Classical music fans are very vocal, but not wanted much by advertisers. That's why WTMI finally sold out.\n\nThe red and white tower was still on the Deauville the last time I saw the building.\n\nAfter the Deauville, I think Love 94's transmitter went to One Biscayne and then the 1000 foot Gannet tower near 441 and County Line road when it was built in the early 1980s.\n\nYes, I have broadcasting in my blood. I came to Miami as a 4-year-old in 1942, went to Miami Shores Elementary School, left in 1949, and came back as a young man in early 1961 as a news reporter, then producer, ended as producer of documentaries at WCKT-WCKR - until April, 1968. Started when the TV station was jointly owned by Knight and Cox newspapers. Covered Miami politics, crime, Cuban and other Latin American issues, the Cape.... good years! Thank you so much for pulling all these memories together.Since I lasted posted a thought 6/28/07, I've recalled listening to Jerry Wichner's early evening dedication hour in the mid to late 1950's. It was really cool if your latest crush called in with a song dedicated to your name!! By the mid to late 1960's, I was a young wife and mother who listened to \"The King of Radio\" - Larry King and his week night talk show after I had put my pre-schoolers to bed for the night. Fast forward to this decade - I listen to Larry King on CNN after my husband has gone to bed! Sign of the times, and thanks once again for the memories.Does anyone remember The Place on Biscayne Blvd and arund 140th street. It was across the street from the carpet store. Wow do I remember the bands \"Queen Kids\" and \"Six Pack\". They were the best and you only had to be \"16\" to get into The Place. I remember long lines. There was also another hot stop at the Colseium bowling alley and I think it was off of 27th avenue. Let's don't forget Milander Auditorium on Palm Avenue. Dances every Friday night until 10:00pm my how those days have changed."
