        "text": "SECTION II:\n\nVictim Media Advocacy:\n\nHow to Build Positive Relations With the News Media\n\nPAGE INDEX\n\na. Print Media\n\ni. Daily Newspapers\n\nii. Weekly Newspapers\n\ni. Monthly Newspapers\n\nii. Magazines\n\nb. Broadcast Media\n\ni. Television\n\nii. Radio\n\ni. Wire Services\n\nii. Web-based Media\n\nTypes of News Media\n\nThe term ânews mediaâ spans a variety of entities that cover international, national, state and local news, and feature stories. By understanding the different types of media and the roles of their respective personnel, victim advocates can develop an effective media strategy and know how to contact the right person.\n\nThe news media generally fall into three general categories:\n\nPrint media.\n\nBroadcast media.\n\nWeb-based media.\n\nMost print and broadcast media today have Web sites that augment their regular news and programming, and often feature a section devoted to the âcommunityââwhich is a good source to promote information about victimsâ rights and services.\n\nIn addition, there are media and outreach venues that are specific to crime, victimization, justice, and public safety issues. These are sponsored by national and local organizations in both electronic-, Web-, and paper-based formats.\n\na. Print Media\n\ni. Daily Newspapers\n\nIn 2003, there were 787 daily newspapers and 680 evening newspapers in the United States.20 In large urban jurisdictions, many daily newspapers also publish a condensed daily version of their print publication that tends to focus more on local news and is free to the public.\n\nNewspapers offer a variety of opportunities for victim assistance organizations to make or contribute to the news, publicize their activities, and seek community support:\n\nNews stories often include experts, commentary, or background resources about timely issues that occur at the national, state, and local levels. Newspapers try to provide local angles to national news events, and always need local experts whom they can rely upon for information and referrals to other sources.\n\nFeature stories focus on the human element of lifeâpeople and programs that make a positive difference in a community; overcome adversity and succeed against significant odds; or make exemplary contributions to improving a community.\n\nEditorial pages feature letters-to-the-editor from readers that respond to past articles or comment on current issues within a community, and often publish editorial columns written by their readers.\n\nCommunity calendarsâoften a regular column published once a weekâoffer readers concise information about special events and activities.\n\nSome newspapers have a regular column devoted to volunteer opportunities where local agenciesâ volunteer needs can be matched to readersâ interests.\n\nKey newspaper personnel who are responsible for news, editorials, and community relations includeâ\n\nNews editors. The number and types of newspaper editors will vary depending on its size:\n\nAn executive editor (also called âeditor in chiefâ) is the person responsible for overseeing the news division and newsroom.\n\nIf the news and editorial divisions are separate within a newspaper, there may also be an editorial page editor who is responsible for editorials, opinion columns, and letters-to-the-editor.\n\nA managing editor oversees the day-to-day activities of the news division.\n\nOther editorsâsuch as national, state, features, and photo editorsâare specialized in their departments and oversight, and report to the managing editor.\n\nThe city editor (also called âmetro editorâ) oversees local news.\n\nThe copy editor runs the copy desk, which is responsible for checking spelling and grammar, and identifying anything that might be missing in a story. Upon completion, the copy desk will return an article to other editors to finalize.\n\nReporters (also called âstaff writersâ) are the journalists who actually research, conduct interviews, and write stories. Some reporters are assigned to specialized âbeatsâ(such as a âcrime beatâ or âcourt beatâ). Others are general assignment reporters who cover a wide range of issues. Larger newspapers are more likely to have specialized beat reporters.\n\nHeadline writers (primarily in larger newspapers) are responsible for creating headlines for all stories.\n\nii. Weekly Newspapers\n\nIn 2003, there were 6,704 weekly newspapers in the United States.21 Weekly newspapers (also called âweekliesâ) generally cover smaller geographical areas than daily newspapers, or are published as âalternativesâ to daily publications. Weeklies tend to focus more on local issues and events that are relevant to the geographic communities they serve. Like daily newspapers, weeklies include news, editorials, and feature stories, and often offer community calendars with brief information about local events and activities. The opportunities for victim and public awareness described above in âDaily Newspapersâ also apply to weeklies, and itâs sometimes easier to get published in weekly newspapers because of their community focus.\n\niii. Monthly Newspapers\n\nThis type of publication can be found primarily in large urban areas. Monthly newspapers are usually free, and often serve a specific geographical area with news, features, and editorials that are targeted to that community. They are a great source for publicizing activities or events within a specific community, as their readers live within and often take personal interest in the neighborhood in which they are published.\n\niv. Magazines\n\nThere are literally hundreds of magazines published in the United States that address news and general and special interest topics. Magazines are published nationally, regionally, and even locally.\n\nb. Broadcast Media\n\nÂ\n\ni. Television\n\nThere are 1,686 broadcast television stations and 308 cable television stations in the United States.22 Similar to newspapers, television offers a wide range of public and victim awareness opportunities:\n\nTelevision news can be international, national, and/or local in scope. Local experts are often sought to make news or feature stories more relevant to a community.\n\nHuman interest stories inform viewers of inspiring people and activities within the community.\n\nSome television news programs have editorial segments in which community leaders or spokespersons comment on the news of the day or issues that are of interest to the stationâs viewers.\n\nMany television stations include âcommunity calendarsâ in their newscasts and on their Web sites that provide information about community activities.\n\nAll television stations are required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to include public service announcements in their advertising.\n\nKey television station personnel who are responsible for news and community relations includeâ\n\nThe general manager (also called âstation managerâ) is responsible for overseeing all station operations.\n\nThe assignment editor identifies the most important issues and news that a station will cover. He or she will set priorities, assign reporters to cover stories, and manage logistics such as live coverage or satellite feeds.\n\nThe community relations director (also called âpublic affairs directorâ) identifies the needs of a community and tries to address them through programming and public service partnerships.\n\nThe news director oversees a stationâs news department and makes key decisions regarding the content of a newscast, staff assignments, and technical aspects related to a news broadcast.\n\nNews reporters investigate, write, and report the news, coordinating closely with news directors and anchors.\n\nNews anchors are the on-air talent who report the news. Many news anchors are also seasoned journalists with experience in reporting and producing news segments.\n\nLocal cable television stations are great venues for promoting crime victim-related issues. Some stations sponsor programs devoted to local issues and seek experts within a community for their news and feature programs.\n\nÂ Â ii. Radio\n\nThere are 13,261 radio stations in the United States, including 4,811 commercial AM stations, 6,147 commercial FM stations, and 2,303 educational stations.23 The format of radio stations varies: their primary focus can be news, talk, music, or a combination. Some stationsâ formats address targeted audiences (such as farm reports in rural communities or listeners in urban communities).\n\nOutreach through radio stations is similar to that described above for newspapers and television stations. In additionâ\n\nRadio public service announcements are a good venue for victim assistance organizations to promote their programs and activities.\n\nTalk radio stations and programs offer an open, âcall-inâ environment to address key public issues related to crime and victimization. Talk radio has been experiencing significant growth; radio listeners reported just under one and one-half hours (86 minutes) of radio news/talk listening on the average weekday.24 Â A talk radio format allows:\n\nVictim advocates to send press releases or suggestions for on-air discussions, or to pitch themselves as expert guests.\n\nOpportunities to introduce and/or respond to on-air topics related to crime and victimization.\n\nLively, interactive discussions about crime- and victim-related topics that can include experts and callers.\n\nCrime victims and survivors to present their unique perspectives about crime and its impact.\n\nKey radio station personnel who are responsible for news and community relations includeâ\n\nThe general manager is responsible for the overall operation of a radio station.\n\nThe news director oversees the news operations of a station, and identifies issues of interest to listeners and assigns stories to reporters.\n\nReporters investigate, write, and report on-air about local news and feature stories.\n\nRadio announcers are âthe voice of the radio stationâ who introduce programming, news, music, and often read public service announcements.\n\nThe promotion director shapes a stationâs overall image, activities and programming, and coordinates tie-ins to special community events, as well as local organizations.\n\niii. Wire Services\n\nWire services are news organizations that supply news reports, features, and human interest stories to both print and broadcast news media. The major wire services host Web sites with contact information for submitting press releases or ideas for stories, and some have local bureaus in major cities that focus more on state and local news.\n\niv. Web-based Media\n\nÂ All television and radio stations host Web sites that support their mission and programming. Most daily newspapers also publish versions of their publication on the Web. In both cases, Web sites not only document the original news and programming, but also augment it through opportunities for readers, viewers, and listeners to interact with the experts and/or people who are featured.\n\nIncreasingly, there are media whose only outlet is Web-based. They may address news, politics, and public policy and/or targeted issues.\n\nThe use of Web-based blogs is also increasing. A blog (abbreviation for âWeblogâ) is a journal or diary that is posted online for viewing by the public. A blog contains an ongoing series of entries that are written from the most recent to the oldest. Blogs are opinion-oriented and provide authors with the opportunity to comment on themselves and their own experiences, current social or political issues, and/or respond to current events in the news.\n\nBlogs are often attached to Web sites and specific issues, but can be independent online journals created by anybody for any purpose. Generally, there is no cost associated with sponsoring a blog and there are many Web sites (such as www.bloggers.com) that host blogs for free.\n\n(Top of Page)"
