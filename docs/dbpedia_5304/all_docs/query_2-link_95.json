Thanks.\n\nThe One Hundred Oldest Stations in the United States\n\nPlease note that the definition of \"oldest\" is based on licenses issued by the DOC,\n\nAND the beginning of regular programming. For example, KCBS' ancestor was on\n\nthe air with a regular schedule of programs in 1912 range. The DOC did not truly\n\nhave a \"broadcast\" license until much later. Some suggest WBZ was the first of\n\nthese. One thing we know for sure, KDKA was NOT the first broadcaster,\n\nNOT the first to have a \"commercial\" license, and NOT the first to do news (in\n\nfact the election reports often cited for KDKA's \"opening\" were done as station 8ZZ.)\n\nFor more information, please see http://www.oldradio.com/archives/general/1st.html\n\n(as of 10/20/12)\n\nThe information and dates used were adapted from Thomas White's research.\n\nWas KDKA really the first station? Perhaps. Please, read on...\n\nA discussion by Barry Mishkind about which station was on the air first.\n\nWho's On First?\n\nA discussion by Thomas White about which station was on the air first."
