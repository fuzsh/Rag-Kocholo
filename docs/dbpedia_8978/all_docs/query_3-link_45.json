        "text": "The United Arab Emirates demonstrated its commitment to financial sector innovation last week when it undertook the first cross-border transfer of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital dirham.\n\nOn January 29, the chairman of the UAE Central Bank sent 50 million digital dirhams - the equivalent of approximately $13 million - from the UAE to China over mBridge, a platform that allows countries and financial institutions to experiment with using CBDCs for cross-border wholesale payments.\n\nThe transfer forms part of the UAE’s efforts on developing a CBDC that can drive the the country’s digital transformation, and is the first in a series of pilot programs the UAE intends to run with CBDCs, with future projects to focus on establishing CBDC bridges with India, and a proof of concept for a CBDCs use in domestic retail and wholesale payments. Jointly these efforts comprise part of the UAE’s CBDC Strategy, which the Central Bank announced in March 2023.\n\nThe UAE’s pioneering work on CBDCs is just one component of the country’s drive toward pioneering financial sector innovation. The UAE has also made clear its intention to serve as a hub for the development of a well-regulated blockchain and crypto sector as another component of digital transformation. As we’ve noted before, last year the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the world’s first crypto-specific regulatory body, rolled out a comprehensive and robust framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) looking to operate from Dubai.\n\nAdditionally, carefully designed and comprehensive regulatory regimes established by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and by supervisors in nearby Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah, these developments are helping the UAE to build a reputation as a leader in digital asset innovation. Indeed, crypto firms and financial institutions seeking to innovate in the space, such as Standard Chartered Bank, are increasingly looking to the UAE as a base from which to operate.\n\nAs noted in our recent 2024 Regulatory Outlook, we think that across this year the UAE will continue to cement its status as a global and regional hub for well-regulated crypto innovation - and its recent experiments with the digital dirham are testament to its ambitions.\n\nFor more on crypto developments in the UAE, check out the Elliptic blog.\n\nHong Kong to consider regulation of OTC crypto brokers as exchanges face registration warning\n\nOver in the Asia-Pacific region, policymakers in Hong Kong are considering how to deal with unlicensed over-the-counter (OTC) crypto brokers amid a looming regulatory registration deadline for exchanges.\n\nOn February 2, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB) of Hong Kong announced that it will soon launch a consultation on how to bring OTC crypto brokers within the scope of Hong Kong’s regulatory framework for crypto.\n\nThe FSTB’s announcement came just three days before the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a reminder on February 5 that virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) must submit a licensing application to the SFC by February 29 or must shut their doors by May 31 of this year. The SFC, which administers Hong Kong’s licensing regime for VATPs, has repeatedly warned the public not to trade on crypto platforms that are not licensed, and has called out exchanges that it suspects are fraudulently claiming to have an SFC license to deceive investors.\n\nThe FSTB’s statement of February 2 notes that OTC brokers in Hong Kong appear in some cases to have played a role in enabling investors to use unlicensed exchanges - therefore prompting a need to bring OTC brokers within Hong Kong’s regulatory framework as well.\n\nAs noted in our 2024 Regulatory Outlook, we think that Hong Kong will continue to stand out as a center for crypto innovation in the APAC region this year owing to these efforts to establish a robust regulatory framework. Alongside the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) plans to regulate stablecoin issuers, the efforts of the FTSB and SFC to ensure the effective oversight of crypto trading platforms can both facilitate innovation in the crypto space - including for retail trading purposes - while helping to protect consumers.\n\nTo learn more about Hong Kong’s evolving regulatory framework for crypto, watch our on-demand webinar with the SFC’s Director of Licensing and Head of Fintech Unit, Elizabeth Wong.\n\nChina to enhance AML rules for crypto\n\nOn mainland China, financial sector authorities are planning to introduce anti-money laundering (AML) measures for crypto as evidence emerges that its ban on crypto has failed to prevent illicit finance involving the technology.\n\nAccording to reports, China will include provisions to regulate crypto activity for AML purposes as part of legislative changes to the country’s AML laws due to become law in 2025. The plans come on the heels of a recent report by the United Nations indicating that cryptoassets, and stablecoins in particular, are playing an increasingly important role in money laundering in China. The US government has also used financial sanctions to target China-based facilitators of North Korea’s crypto-related activity.\n\nIn 2021, China famously banned crypto trading activity completely - but reports of money laundering occuring via underground brokers in China suggest that the ban has merely pushed crypto into less transparent channels.\n\nSouth Korea looks to bring accountability to crypto firms\n\nIn another piece of news from the APAC region, on February 5 the South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced plans to enhance scrutiny of crypto firms operating in the country.\n\nSpecifically, the FSC has proposed changes to South Korea’s legislation on crypto that will - if adopted - require that executives of regulated crypto exchanges are approved by the FSC prior to being appointed. The enhanced authorities will also provide the FSC with the ability to suspend a company’s license if its executive members are under investigation. If approved, the changes will take effect from March of this year."
