        "text": "How to buy UAE Dirham (AED)\n\nYou can buy UAE Dirham with Asda Travel Money in three different ways:\n\nIn-store bureau\n\nBuying your UAE Dirham from your local Asda Travel Money bureau is all about ease and convenience. It’s a super easy way to organise your holiday money, as we have locations in Asda stores all over the country. Just pop in when you’re doing your weekly shop. Our same day travel money service is ideal for last-minute currency before your trip (subject to availability).\n\nClick & Collect – UAE Dirham (AED)\n\nConverting sterling to UAE Dirham has never been simpler. All you need to do is purchase your currency online and choose Click & Collect to pick up your travel money at one of our many selected Asda stores, free of charge.\n\nHome delivery for UAE Dirham (AED)\n\nSelecting home delivery means your UAE Dirham will be delivered direct to your door. Choose next day home delivery from £4.99 (for orders placed before 2pm) or FREE home delivery for orders of £500 or more. The minimum order available for home delivery is £350.\n\nWhat is AED Currency?\n\nThe United Emirates uses the United Arab Emirates Dirham or, as it’s more casually known Emirati Dirham, since 1973. Its name comes from the word Drachmae, Greek for ‘handful’. While it’s officially abbreviated as AED, DH or Dhs abbreviations are also common. [1]\n\nShould You Buy United Emirates Currency Now or Wait?\n\nMost vendors and retailers in the UAE prefer cash transactions. So, it’s a good idea to have some cash on you.\n\nBuying United Emirates currency before you go means you won’t need to find an ATM on arrival or deal with pesky international transaction fees. With AED currency already lining your pockets, you’ll be ready for the adventure of a lifetime.\n\nExchange Rate\n\nIf you’re organised and change your currency in advance, it may help with getting a better exchange rate. Whereas leaving it to the last minute and buying your currency at the airport, means higher rates and potentially high commission fees too. It pays to plan ahead and buy your UAE Dirham before you travel.\n\nGBP to AED\n\nDubai and the rest of the UAE is a wonderful place to explore. From its beaches and red dunes to its world famous buildings and shopping malls. But with so much to see and do, you’ll want your AED to go as far as possible.\n\nThankfully, at Asda Money we offer competitive exchange rates for UAE Dirham when you buy your foreign currency with us. If you find a better rate within 5 miles, we’ll match it with our Price Promise.\n\nAED to GBP\n\nAnd if you’re left with currency in your back pocket at the end of your trip, there’s no need to waste it at the airport – Dubai Airport can be expensive at the best of times[2]. With Asda Money, we’ll buy back your UAE Dirham at the same rate with our Buy Back Promise.\n\nBuy back rate for UAE Dirham\n\nTo benefit from our Buy Back Promise, you simply need to take it out for £2.99 when you buy your currency in the first place. Once you’re home with leftover UAE Dirham in hand (bank notes only), we’ll buy it back from you at the original exchange rate up to maximum value of £250. Any value above this limit will be exchanged using the applicable daily rate on the board. T&C’s apply."
