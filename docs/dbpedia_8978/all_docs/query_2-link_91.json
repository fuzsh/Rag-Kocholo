        "text": "In the UAE, regulation of the establishment and conduct of businesses is shared at the federal and emirate levels. Effective June 1, 2021, the UAE removed the requirement for companies to have a local sponsor, allowing foreign investors and entrepreneurs to establish and fully own onshore companies in most sectors.\n\nThe amended ownership law is a part of UAE government efforts to increase the ease of doing business and enhance the UAE’s appeal to foreign investors, entrepreneurs and talent. It will further strengthen the country’s position as an international economic center and encourage the flow of investments to key sectors.\n\nThe Global Competitiveness Index Report 2019, issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF), ranks the UAE as the most competitive economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The report states that the UAE’s adoption of information communications technologies “complements long-standing competitive advantages, including a stable macroeconomic environment, a sound product market, and one of the most modern transport systems in the world.”\n\nOther clear advantages to doing business in the UAE include:\n\nNo restrictions on profit transfer or repatriation of capital\n\nNo corporate or income taxes\n\nA currency, the Dirham, that is stable, secure and pegged to the US dollar\n\nVery low, or non-existent, import duties\n\nCompetitive labor costs\n\n100% foreign ownership available for onshore companies in most sectors\n\nThese factors, combined with a strategic geographic location, an expanding infrastructure and an extremely safe environment, make the UAE an ideal place to do business."
