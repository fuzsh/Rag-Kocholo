        "text": "Currency in Dubai, UAE\n\nCoronavirus in the UAE: Some information on this website is out of date as a result of measures taken in the UAE to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Confirm with official or authoritative sources.\n\nCurrency used in UAE and Dubai is the United Arab Emirates dirham (AED)\n\nThe UAE dirham is pegged to the US dollar with the rate fixed at (approximately) Dh3.67 = US$1.00 (or 1 UAE dirham = 0.273 US dollars).\n\nThe currency unit in the United Arab Emirates is the UAE dirham, divided into into 100 fils.\n\nCommon abbreviations include AED or Dh before the number, and dh or dhs after the number.\n\nShops in the larger shopping centers might accept some foreign currencies. Usually other Gulf (GCC) currencies, US dollars, Euros, and British pounds.\n\nUAE banknotes are printed overseas including the UK and France. The Central Bank has announced plans to build a currency printing plant in Abu Dhabi (Reuters 12 Dec 2009).\n\nMoney exchange in the UAE\n\nForeign currency exchange is available at banks and money changers for most of the common currencies.\n\nShopping centers usually have a money changer that is open the same hours as shops are (banks hours are shorter).\n\nAl Ansari Exchange, Al Rostamani (Thomas Cook), and UAExchange are popular money changers in the UAE.\n\nMoney changers in the UAE are generally safe to use, especially if you use reputable agencies. If you're not sure if a money exchange is reputable or not, go to one in a shopping mall.\n\nBanknotes and coins used in Dubai and the UAE\n\nList of UAE banknotes and coins Amount Color Picture front Picture back Size mm1 Circulation5 Comments\n\nBank notes in the UAE\n\n5 dirhams brown Sharjah Central Souk Landscape 145x612 10 dirhams green Arabian dagger (Jambiya) Farm 147x62 20 dirhams turquoise Dubai Creek Golf and Yacht Club Dhow (Samaa, Sama'a) 149x63 50 dirhams purple Al Jahili Fort in Al Ain Oryx 151x64 100 dirhams red Al Fahidi Fort in Dubai Dubai World Trade Center 155x66 200 dirhams3 orange Sharia Court and Zayed Sports City UAE Central Bank HQ 157x67 older notes are brown 500 dirhams blue Jumeirah Mosque Falcon 159x68 1000 dirhams brown Al Hosn Palace in Abu Dhabi Abu Dhabi corniche towers 163x70 darker brown than 5 dhs\n\nCoins in the UAE\n\n1 fil5 3.5m very rarely seen 5 fils 40m rarely seen 10 fils 50m rarely seen 25 fils 260m common 50 fils (small)4 365m common 1 dh (small)4 ~50 fils (old)4 common 50 fils (large)4 ~1 dh (new)4 uncommon 1 dh (large)4 uncommon [?] 5 dh rare, first issued 1975\n\nCommemorative coins in the UAE\n\n1 dh 5 dh 25 dh 20g silver 50 dh 40g silver 100 dh 60g silver6 9x issed 1999-2018 500 dh7 20g gold 6x issued 1976-2003 1000 dh7 40g gold 16x issued 1976-2013 1500 dh7 60g gold 4x issued 2004-2012 5000 dh7 200g gold 2x issued in 1996. 250,000 dh8 No, was incorrect headline\n\nAll banknotes are issued by the UAE Central Bank and are printed in English on one side, and Arabic on the other. Coins have \"United Arab Emirates\" and the denomination in Arabic on one side, and a picture and date on the other. Coins show face value only in Arabic (or not at all for gold commemorative coins), not in English.\n\nChicklets are not an official UAE currency unit issued by the Central Bank, but an irritating replacement common at petrol stations and small supermarkets in lieu of small change. Chicklets are a one-way transaction only, you can't use them for purchases (although if enough people tried, maybe that would encourage shops to give proper change).\n\nNotes\n\nBanknotes are of increasing size as the value increases.\n\nSize given as 157mm x 67mm by UAE Central Bank but that appears to be an error, the 5 dh note is smaller than the 200 dh note. Our estimate is 145mm x 61mm (not confirmed).\n\nThe 200 dh bank note was updated in May 2008 to reduce confusion with the 5 dh and 1000 dh banknotes.\n\nFrom 1995 new 50 fil and 1 dirham coins were issued, smaller than the older coins. The new 50 fil coin has a heptagonal shape (7 sides not 6). The new 1 dh coin is similar in size to the old 50 fil coin, and the two coins are easily confused if not looking at them. If you get a 50 fil coin instead of a 1 dh coin as change in a shop, don't be too quick to accuse them of trying to scam you. It is much more likely to be a mistake. We've had it go both ways, getting 1 dh instead of 50 fils or vice-versa.\n\nSome sources say the 1 fil coin was withdrawn from circulation in 2005. We didn't find any official reference to confirm that, but did find reports from 30 Jan 2018 which said there were 3.4 million one-fil coins in circulation. Reports referred to a FNC session where the topic of a shortage of low-value coins was discussed. Obaid bin Humaid Al Tayer, Minister of State for Financial Affairs, gave the numbers of coins in circulation as of 25 Jan 2018 as follows (Reference: GN, KT, TN)\n\n1 fil coins: 3.4 million, value AED 34,000\n\n5 fil coins: 42.4 million, value AED 2.12 million.\n\n10 fil coins: 48.7 million, value AED 4.87 million.\n\n25 fil coins: 262 million, value AED 65.5 million.\n\n50 fil coins: 363.8 million, value AED 181.9 million.\n\nThe AED 100 silver commemorative coins are all 59 or 60g of silver except for the 40g 1999 issue commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Dubai Ports and Customs Department.\n\nCommemorative coins in table listed with a face value AED 500 or greater are not issued with the face value showing on the coin, so the values given in the table are based on:\n\nCoins issued prior to 1996 with a face value of AED 500 or AED 1000 do have the face value written on them. Higher value, or weight coins were not issued before 1996.\n\nThose coins have weights of 20g and 40g of gold respectively.\n\nFace values for coins without the amount shown are calculated on the basis of AED 500 for each 20g of gold weight.\n\nSilver coins all show the face value.\n\nSee heading \"Commemorative Dirham not worth AED250,000, Sep 2018\" below.\n\nMost Expensive Face Value Coin in the World (not really)\n\nCommemorative Dirham not worth AED 250,000, Sep 2018\n\nNumismatic eyebrows were raised somewhat when reading UAE newspaper headlines on 17 Sep 2018, for example:\n\nDhs250,000 Emirati School Commemorative Dirham\n\nNew Dh250,000 commemorative coin launched in UAE\n\nAED 250k is an unlikely amount for a single coin face value, anywhere, even if the UAE was trying to get a headline for Most Expensive Coin in the World. It's even more unlikely for a coin that weights only 6g, is made of copper-nickel, and commemorates a school. Not to cast aspersions on the value of education, but to put things in perspective, the 200g gold coin celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the UAE is considered to have a face value equivalent to AED 5,000. Difficult to think of something that would be 50x more significant than the 25th anniversary of the UAE. Perhaps the 1000th anniversary of the UAE, or the completion of the first terraformed Dubai suburb on planet Mars - Dubai Mars City?\n\nExplanation is found in the original press release from WAM (16 Sep 2018) which said a partnership between the UAE MOE and the UAE Central Bank \"... resulted in a joint initiative to issue the AED250,000 Emirati School Commemorative Dirham.\" Presumably they meant 250,000 coins would be issued. The photos of the coins show the denomination is AED 1. An earlier press release also explained the coin commemorates the \"UAE New Education System Emirati School\", rather than just a single school.\n\nUAE currency information\n\nUAE currency history\n\nNote that 1 UAE dirham is ~ 100 Qatari dirhams, or 1 UAE fil = 1 Qatari dirham. The Qatari riyal is split into 100 Qatari dirhams.\n\nFrom 1973, two years after the founding of the UAE, notes and coins were issued as UAE dirhams for the entire country. The new currency replaced the old currencies in use until then at the following rates.\n\n1 UAE dirham = 0.1 Bahraini dinar, or 1 BD = 10 Dhs.\n\n1 UAE dirham = 1 Dubai-Qatari riyal, or 1 UAE dirham = 100 DQ-dirhams (QD-dirhams), or 1 UAE fil = 1 QD-dirham.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1973, the Trucial States then the UAE, except for Abu Dhabi, used the Qatari-Dubai riyal\n\nAbu Dhabi emirate used the Bahrani dinar and fil. One BD = 100 fils. One BD = 10 Gulf rupees.\n\nDubai and other emirates used the Qatari riyal and dirham. One QR = 100 dirhams (a different dirham from the UAE currency used from 1973).\n\nAjman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Quwain each issued their own coins but used Dubai-Qatari banknotes.\n\nBefore the mid-1960s, the Indian rupee was used in the UAE, or more specifically the Gulf rupee, which was still issued by India and had the same value as the Indian rupee but was pink and not legal tender in India. You will occasionally hear older residents say \"rupees\" when referring to \"dirhams\".\n\nUAE currency museum\n\n18 Dec 2013 - the Central Bank announced the opening of a currency museum at its headquarters. See UAE coins and notes museum for more information.\n\nUAE currency updates\n\n20 Aug 2012 - the UAE Central Bank announced that a new version of the 50 dirham note would be issued, and circulation of the new notes would begin on Monday 30 July 2012. The new note would have a new security feature - the silver metallic thread on the front of the note would be replaced with a broader (3mm) colour shifting thread reading \"UAE 50\".\n\n2012? New AED 500 notes were put into circulation, with new security features but otherwise looking much the same as the older 500 dirham notes.\n\nGCC Common Currency and Monetary Union\n\nThe six GCC countries - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE - had planned to launch a common currency by 2010, but Oman pulled out of discussions in 2006, and the UAE withdrew in 2009. In 2009 the 2010 target was moved to 2015 but as of 2014 that seems unlikely to happen. \"Maybe one day\" is probably the most realistic launch date for now.\n\nOther information moved to GCC currency union section on list of GCC countries page.\n\n[Update] UAE commemorative coins and other special issues\n\nSince 1976, the UAE Central Bank has issued commemorative coins on a regular basis, annually from 1998. In 1976 two coins were issued in denominations of 500 dhs and 1000 dhs, made of gold. You probably won't get one as change from your shopping trip to Carrefour. In subsequent years a range of denominations have been issued, including 1 dh, 5 dhs, 10 dh, 50 dh, and 100 dhs coins. Materials include copper-nickel alloy, silver, and gold.\n\n10 March 2012 (announcement date) - The UAE Central Bank will issue a silver coin to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Khalifa International Date Palm Award, with the logo on the back, and the portrait of UAE President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on the front.\n\n03 March 2012 (Gulf News report) - the \"UAE's first gold coin\" will be available by the end of March 2012 reportedly. The announcement that it will be the first gold coin issued by the UAE seems a bit odd - there were gold coins issued in 1976. But anyway, the coin will have a portrait of President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on the front, and a picture of the Burj Khalifa on the back. Coin is being marketed by the Dubai Multi-Commodities Center (DMCC). A prototype was launched in August 2011.\n\nLast update Monday 11-Nov-2019"
