        "text": "Money and notes\n\nIn Dubai, you will find coins of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 fils and 1 dirham. On one side of the coins are motifs typical of the United Arab Emirates, such as palm trees, jars or gazelles.\n\nAs for notes, there are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 dirhams. There are banknotes of various colors and all have their value written in Arabic.\n\nWhere to change money in Dubai\n\nIn Dubai, there are many international banks with ATMs where you can withdraw money, and this is one of the most cost-saving ways to obtain the local currency during the trip. In Dubai, there are also cash machines in the big supermarkets, in the metro, and in the most central areas of the city.\n\nIn the streets, you will also find many currency exchange offices and shops that offer this service, but there is always the risk that you could receive a counterfeit note.\n\nIn hotels and airports you can also change money easily, but normally you will get a worse exchange rate.\n\nPay in cash or by card?\n\nAlthough you can pay by credit card at virtually all restaurants and shops in Dubai, it is always best to carry cash to avoid problems. For taxis and small shops, it is preferable to pay in cash as many do not have a dataphone.\n\nType of change"
