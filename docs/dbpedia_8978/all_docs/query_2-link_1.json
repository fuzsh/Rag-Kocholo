        "text": "History of the UAE Dirham\n\nThe ‘Currency Board’ was established as per Union Law No. 2 of 1973, which was replaced by Law No. 10 of 1980 concerning the Central Bank, Monetary System and Organization of Banking (PDF, 550 KB).\n\nThe Currency Board issued the national currency that replaced the Bahraini Dinar and the Qatari and Dubai Riyal currencies that were in use at the time as per the website of the UAE Central Bank. The UAE dirham was introduced in circulation for the first time on 19 May 1973. The Qatar and Dubai riyal were in circulation since 1966 in all of the emirates except Abu Dhabi, where the dirham replaced the Bahraini dinar.\n\nCoins\n\nCoins are in the denominations of AED 1, 50 fils and 25 fils. The coins of 1, 5 and 10 fils are not used in everyday life. So, all amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest multiples of 25 fils.\n\nSince 1976, the Currency Board and then Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates have minted several commemorative coins celebrating different events of the United Arab Emirates as below:\n\nCBUAE to issue silver coin to commemorate first Emirati astronaut's space mission - WAM\n\nReissuance of Commemorative Coins in honour of Founding Father – WAM\n\nCentral Bank issues commemorative coin on Asian Cup – WAM\n\nCommemorative coins\n\nAlongside currency used for everyday transactions, the CBUAE also mints commemorative coins to celebrate the many highlights and achievements of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nGovernment entities, banks and the CBUAE are all entitled to request CBUAE to issue a commemorative gold, silver or circulation coin to mark an important occasion.\n\nRead more about currency and coins."
