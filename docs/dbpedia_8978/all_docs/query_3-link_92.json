This coin is round in shape with two sides arranged in a circle.\n\nOn one side, there are the words “Lailahaillallah” and “Alhamdulillah”. On the other side, the name of the ruler and the date of minting are printed.\n\nHistory of Dinar and Dirham\n\nThe use of dinars and dirhams began during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. These two gold and silver coins were used as a medium of exchange because they were considered valuable and valuable, replacing the barter system previously used by the Arab community.\n\nThe term “dinar” stems from the Latin word “Denarius” used by the Romans, while “dirham” comes from the Persian “Drachma”.\n\nThese coins began to circulate as a result of trade between the Arabs and Sham, which was under Roman and Yemeni or Persian rule.\n\nAt the time of the Prophet Muhammad, the weight of dinars and dirhams was determined through a standard created by him and his best friend, Arqam bin Abi Arqam, namely 7 dinars equivalent to the weight of 10 dirhams.\n\nIn the history of Islamic government, the use of dirham was first applied during the reign of Abdul Malik bin Marwan, with metal weights based on the size of the “solidus”, the currency of Byzantium.\n\nDifference between Dinar and Dirham\n\nAfter knowing their history, here are the differences between dinars and dirhams that are important to know.\n\n1. Shape\n\nBoth coins are round and thin, similar to other coins. However, the design and engraving of each coin can differ depending on the country and company that issued it, which also affects the price of the coin.\n\n2. Materials of Manufacture\n\nDinars are made of gold, while dirhams are made of silver. The weight difference between the two is quite significant, with the dinar weighing around 4.295 grams, while the dirham is around 2.975 grams.\n\nIn addition to the difference in material and weight, the precious metal content is also different. Dinars generally contain higher levels of precious metals than dirhams.\n\n3. Value and Price\n\nDue to the difference in materials and precious metal content, the prices of dinars and dirhams also differ. Dinars, which are made of pure gold, have a much higher price compared to dirhams.\n\nOn the other hand, dinars are also considered more favorable for investment due to their more promising price increases.\n\nRead more: Authenticity Test, Here are 10 Ways to Distinguish Real and Fake Gold Manually\n\nUses in Indonesia\n\nSince dinars and dirhams are made of precious metals such as gold and silver, their use is limited to the following purposes, among others:\n\n1.
