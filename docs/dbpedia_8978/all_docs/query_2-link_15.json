ATMs are found across the UAE, mostly in the major cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nCulture\n\nThe United Arab Emirates bears a significant resemblance to neighbouring Arab countries and the larger Arab culture. Modernisation of its culture occurred after the discovery of oil mines in the country in 1960, when small mud walled towns started developing as cities and towns with high rise buildings. However the people of the country have still held the United Arab Emirates traditions.\n\nEmergency Services\n\nPolice: 999\n\nAmbulance: 998/999\n\nFire: 997\n\nWeather\n\nThe best time to visit is between October and May.\n\nThe hottest time is from June to September with little rainfall."
