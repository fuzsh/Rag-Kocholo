        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to the United Arab Emirates in the near future, you may want to exchange some of your money into dirham, the country’s official currency. The international symbol for the currency is AED.\n\nSince 1997, the dirham has been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Instead of fluctuating, the conversion is always the same: 1 USD is worth 3.6725 AED.\n\nThis post has everything you need to know about converting USD to AED, including where to secure the best exchange rates and how to avoid paying high fees on your conversion.\n\nHow to Convert USD to AED\n\nCalculating a conversion of dollars to AED is relatively simple. You can make the conversion using a calculator, or you can do it by hand.\n\n1. Use a Currency Calculator\n\nUsing a currency conversion calculator is typically the easiest way to get an estimate when converting currency.\n\nKeep in mind that exchanging currency often comes with added fees that a conversion calculator won’t be able to predict. For instance, credit card companies and ATM networks usually charge a 1% conversion fee on all foreign transactions. Individual merchants may also charge supplemental fees if you ask them to convert the price of an item to your home currency at checkout.\n\n2. Calculate it Manually\n\nAnother option is to do the calculation manually using a simple mathematical formula. You need to know the current exchange rate—in this case, 1 USD is worth د.إ 3.6725 AED.\n\nMultiply the amount you have in USD by the exchange rate. The resulting number will show you the amount of AED you have available to spend on your trip.\n\nManual Currency Conversion Example\n\nLet’s say you have 1,000 USD and would like to figure out how many dirhams you have for a trip to the U.A.E. Using the current exchange rate, the formula for your conversion would look like this:\n\n1,000 USD x 3.6725 = 3670.25 AED\n\nHow to Buy AED\n\nWhen you’re ready to buy dirhams, it’s a good idea to plan to ensure that you pay the fewest and lowest fees. Here are three ways to get the currency you need while minimizing the fees you’ll be charged:\n\nExchange at a bank or credit union before your trip: Heading to your bank before your trip is often the most cost-effective way to exchange currency. Since you have an existing relationship with them, your bank will likely give you the best exchange rates and charge the lowest fees. For example, Bank of America doesn’t charge its account holders an exchange fee. However, it does set a shipping fee of 7.50 USD on orders worth less than $1,000.\n\nUse your bank’s ATM abroad for withdrawals where possible: If you need to exchange more money while on your trip, try to find an in-network ATM. For example, Citibank and HSBC have ATMs in the U.A.E. Most banking apps have an “ATM locator” feature to help you find the closest option, and using an ATM affiliated with your bank can help you avoid excess fees.\n\nOrder currency online: If your bank doesn’t offer online shipping, you can also use a third party to get currency delivered to your door. However, be aware of inflated costs with some of these vendors. For instance, Currency Exchange International (CXI) advertises that it does not charge an exchange fee. However, you’ll pay up to $30 for overnight shipping.\n\nWhat to Avoid When Exchanging Currency\n\nExchanging currency at the airport: While exchanging currency at the airport is unquestionably convenient, these kiosks often offer some of the worst exchange rates while charging some of the highest fees.\n\nExchanging currency in a street kiosk: Most shopping malls, especially those in large cities like Dubai, have at least one currency exchange kiosk usually available during extended mall hours. Still, you’ll likely pay a premium to use one of these convenient locations.\n\nNext Up:"
