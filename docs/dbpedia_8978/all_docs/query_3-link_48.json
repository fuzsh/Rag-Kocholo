        "text": "A national currency has a greater significance to the country than its value. The strength of the legal tender of a nation determines the socio economic health of the country. The Emirati Dirham is one of the most powerful currencies in the world for its stability and the representation of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHISTORY\n\nRight until the late 1960s, all the emirates who form the United Arab Emirates used to transact with the Gulf Rupee which was based on the Indian Rupee. Later when India devalued the Gulf Rupee against its own currency, some of the emirates moved on to the Saudi Riyal and later settled on Qatar and Dubai Riyal while Abu Dhabi chose Bahraini Dinar.\n\nTwo years into its independence, in 1973, the UAE setup a The Currency Board which introduced the UAE Dirham as the official currency of all emirates part of the United Arab Emirates. Later in 1980, the UAE set up its own Central Bank to take control of its currency and other financial policies.\n\nAn interesting fact about the UAE Dirham is that its exchange value always remains the same to the American currency where 3.6725 UAE Dirhams will get you 1 US Dollar always.\n\nThe decision to base the UAE currency on the United States Dollars stems from the notion that the US Dollar remains by far the most stable currency across the globe.\n\nCOINS\n\nA UAE Dirham is equally divided into 100 Fils. In 1973, the Emirati Government introduced minted coins of values 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 Fils, and 1 Dirham. Coins of 1, 5, 10 fills are rarely seen nowadays as most of the transactions are rounded off to 25 Fils.\n\nNOTES\n\nThe UAE Currency Board also introduced notes with the denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 Dirhams in 1973. While a 1000 Dirham note was first introduced in 1976, it was later pulled out of circulation only to be reintroduced in 2000. The 500 and 200 Dirham notes were introduced in 1983 and 1989 respectively.\n\nSYMBOLS ON THE LEGAL TENDER\n\nJust like any other country, the UAE too has used symbols and illustrations to demonstrate its culture and heritage thorough its legal tender.
