        "text": "The official currency of Dubai is the United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED), which is commonly referred to as the Dubai currency.\n\nIn understanding the AED, it’s important to note that it is divided into smaller units called fils. There are 100 fils in 1 AED, and coins are available in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 fils, as well as 1 AED. Banknotes are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 AED.\n\nThis article will delve into the historical journey of Dubai currency, the history of coins, and the history of bills reflecting the evolution of Dubai’s economy and its transition from a small trading hub to a global financial center. Today, the UAE Dirham is a stable and widely accepted currency that plays a vital role in the country’s economic growth and development.\n\nHistorical Journey of Dubai Currency\n\nDubai’s currency, the UAE Dirham (AED), has come a long way since its introduction in 1973. Over the years, it has undergone several changes and developments to become the stable currency it is today. In this section, we will take a closer look at the historical journey of Dubai currency, the history of coins, and the history of bills.\n\nBefore the introduction of the UAE Dirham, Dubai’s currency was the Gulf Rupee, which was issued by the Government of India. With the formation of the UAE in 1971, the Gulf Rupee was replaced by the Qatar and Dubai Riyal, which was used until the introduction of the UAE Dirham in 1973.\n\nHistory of Coins\n\nIn 1973, the United Arab Emirates introduced coins in various denominations, including 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 fils, as well as 1 dirham. The 1, 5, and 10 fils were made of bronze, while the higher denominations were in cupro-nickel. In 1995, the 5 fils, 10 fils, 50 fils, and 1 dirham coins were resized, and the new 50 fils took on a curve-equilateral-heptagonal shape.\n\nCoins bear Eastern Arabic numerals and Arabic text. The 1, 5, and 10 fils are infrequently used, with amounts typically rounded to the nearest 25 fils. The rare 1 fils coin sees limited circulation, posing a risk of confusion with the similarly sized old 50 fils coin.\n\nSince 1976, the Currency Board of the UAE has minted commemorative coins marking significant events and rulers. Notable is the 25 fils coin featuring a gazelle, the 50 fils with three oil derricks, and the 1 dirham portraying a dallah. All coins display Lunar Hijri and Gregorian years of minting.\n\nHistory of Bills\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) introduced its first series of banknotes on May 20, 1973, with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 dirhams, followed by a 1,000 dirham note on January 3, 1976. In 1982, a second series was introduced, excluding the 1 dirham and 1,000 dirham notes.\n\nThe series was expanded with the addition of 500 dirham notes in 1983 and 200 dirham notes in 1989. The 1,000 dirham notes were reintroduced in 2000. The current banknotes, in circulation, include denominations of 5 (brown), 10 (green), 20 (light blue), 50 (purple), 100 (pink), 200 (green/brown), 500 (navy blue), and 1,000 (greenish blue).\n\nThese banknotes feature Arabic text on the obverse with Eastern Arabic numerals, while the reverse includes English text with Arabic numerals. The 200 dirham denomination, initially produced in 1989, was reissued in a different color (yellow/brown) in 2008, replacing the older green/brown version. The 200 dirham note was scarce as it was not regularly circulated; any in circulation today typically comes from bank stocks.\n\nOn March 22, 2008, a new 50 dirham note was released, featuring enhanced security features like a color-shifting windowed security thread. On December 7, 2021, a redesigned polymer 50 dirham note was issued to commemorate the UAE’s golden jubilee.\n\nThis marked the UAE’s first polymer banknote. Additional polymer banknotes of 5 and 10 dirhams were introduced on April 21, 2022, with the 1,000 dirham polymer note expected in the first half of 2023.\n\nInflation and Buying Power of United Arab Emirates Dirham\n\nThe United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) is the official currency of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is abbreviated as AED or DHS. The Central Bank of the UAE is responsible for issuing and managing the currency. The AED is pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 3.67 AED to 1 USD. This means that the exchange rate between the two currencies remains relatively stable.\n\nOne of the factors that affect the value of a currency is inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling.\n\nThe inflation rate in the UAE has been relatively low in recent years. According to Statista, the inflation rate of the UAE was at 1.93 percent in 2019 compared to the previous year. In 2020 and 2019, there was negative inflation (deflation) with rates of -2.08% and -1.93%, respectively. This indicates a decrease in the general price level during those years.\n\nThe low inflation rate in the UAE means that the purchasing power of the AED has remained relatively stable. This is good news for residents and tourists alike, as it means that their money can go further.\n\nFor example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a product that costs 100 AED this year will cost 102 AED next year. However, if the inflation rate is 0%, then the cost of the product will remain the same.\n\nThe low inflation rate in the UAE means that the purchasing power of the AED has remained relatively stable. This is good news for residents and tourists alike, as it means that their money can go further.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates Dirham\n\nIf you are traveling to Dubai or any other city in the United Arab Emirates, you will need to familiarize yourself with their currency, the United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED). The Dirham is abbreviated as “د.إ” or “AED” and is commonly referred to as the Emirati Dirham.\n\nThe UAE Dirham was introduced in 1973 to replace the Qatar and Dubai Riyal. The value of the Dirham remains stable against the US Dollar, which is the most widely accepted currency for international transactions. The 2021-2023 series features new designs and includes the following.\n\n5 dirhams\n\n5 dirhams (brown) featuring Ajman fort on the front and Dhayah Fort in Ras al Khaimah on the reverse.\n\n10 dirhams\n\n10 dirhams (green) showcasing Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque on the front and Khor Fakkan Amphitheatre on the reverse.\n\n50 dirhams\n\n50 dirhams (navy blue) depicting Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, the other founding fathers, on the front and Sheikh Zayed signing a union document on the reverse.\n\n100 dirhams\n\n100 dirhams featuring Al Fahidi Fort on the front and Falcon and Dubai World Trade Centre on the reverse.\n\n200 dirhams\n\n200 dirhams featuring Sharia Court and Zayed Sports City on the front and Falcon and Central Bank on the reverse.\n\n500 dirhams\n\n500 dirhams (light blue) featuring the Terra Sustainability Pavilion in Expo Dubai and the Museum of the Future, Emirates Towers, and Burj Khalifa in Dubai\n\n1000 dirhams\n\n1,000 dirhams (brown) featuring Sheikh Zayed “Hope” probe and the Barakah nuclear power plant in Ruwais.\n\nCurrency Usage in Dubai\n\nThe official currency of Dubai is the United Arab Emirates dirham (AED), which has been in use since 1973. One dirham is made up of 100 fils.

Coins come in 1, 25, and 50 fils.\n\nIs USD Accepted in Dubai?\n\nWhile the official currency of Dubai is the dirham, the US dollar (USD) is widely accepted in most places, especially in tourist areas and major shopping centers.
