        "text": "General Information\n\nThe symbol for the UAE Dirham is \"د.إ\" or \"DH.\" The ISO currency code is AED. The dirham is further divided into 100 fils, and coins and banknotes are available in various denominations.\n\nCoins: Coins are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 fils, as well as 1 dirham. These coins are commonly used for everyday transactions.\n\nBanknotes: Banknotes are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 dirhams. The higher denominations are typically used for larger transactions.\n\nCurrency Exchange:\n\nDubai has a well-established network of currency exchange services, with exchange offices located at airports, shopping malls, and commercial centers. Additionally, many banks offer currency exchange services, making it convenient for residents and visitors to obtain dirhams.\n\nCashless Transactions:\n\nWhile cash is widely used in daily transactions, Dubai has embraced electronic and cashless payment methods. Credit cards, debit cards, and mobile payment systems are commonly used, providing convenience and efficiency in financial transactions.\n\nMoney Safety\n\nWe suggest that you bring a $300 in cash and withdraw additional amounts from an ATM or bank if needed. In general, cash is the easiest and most common form of payment.\n\nThere is no need to open a bank account in Bahrain. The easiest way to have access to your money is to bring an ATM, debit, and/or credit card linked to your US bank account (or any other country). If your PIN number is longer than 4 numbers, you should change it to 4 numbers before you leave. Check with your bank for details about any fees that they charge, and alert your bank that you will be abroad so that they don’t freeze your account at least a few days prior to your departure. Some students temporarily add their parents as a joint account holder, to deal with any problems that may arise during your time abroad with the bank.\n\nTipping\n\nCash is the preferred method for tipping in Dubai. See the guide below for recommended amounts\n\nRestaurants and Cafés:\n\nRestaurants with Service Charge:\n\nMany restaurants in Dubai include a service charge in the bill, which typically ranges from 10% to 15%. In such cases, additional tipping is not mandatory, but it's common to leave small change or round up the bill as a gesture of appreciation.\n\nNo Service Charge:\n\nIf the bill does not include a service charge, it is customary to leave a tip of around 10% of the total bill. However, this is discretionary and based on the level of service received.\n\nHotels:\n\nPorters:\n\nIt is customary to tip porters who assist with carrying luggage. A tip of AED 5 to AED 10 per bag is common.\n\nHousekeeping:\n\nLeaving a small amount (around AED 5 to AED 10 per day) for the housekeeping staff is a common practice, especially if they provide additional services.\n\nConcierge:\n\nTipping the concierge for special services or helpful recommendations is at your discretion. AED 10 to AED 20 is often considered appropriate.\n\nTaxis:\n\nTipping taxi drivers is not mandatory, but rounding up the fare or leaving a small amount as a token of appreciation is common.\n\nTour Guides and Drivers:\n\nTipping tour guides and drivers on organized tours is a nice gesture. A tip of around AED 20 to AED 50 per day, depending on the length and type of the tour, is common.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\nSmall tips are appreciated for various services, such as hairdressers, delivery services, and other personal services. The amount may vary based on the level of service."
