        "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has successfully completed the first cross-border payment using the Digital Dirham.\n\nThis historic transaction of AED50 million ($13.6 million) was sent by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of the board of the Central Bank of the UAE, to China.\n\nThe cross-border payment was facilitated through the \"mBridge\" platform, a collaborative effort of the BIS Innovation Hub, four founding central banks including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China and Bank of Thailand, and over 25 observing members.\n\nThe program aims to transform wholesale cross-border payments using a multiple-central bank digital currency (multi-CBDC) common platform underpinned by distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n\nThe project seeks to address inefficiencies such as high costs, low speed and transparency, and operational complexities, while safeguarding currency sovereignty and monetary and financial stability for each participating jurisdiction."
