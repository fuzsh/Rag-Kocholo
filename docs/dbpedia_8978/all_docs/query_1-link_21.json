        "text": "What is the currency in United Arab Emirates?\n\nThe official currency in United Arab Emirates is the United Arab Emirates Dirham, which is issued and overseen by the 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils; 1 AED. If you’re buying your travel money online you may also see the official code being shown - AED. In stores and restaurants, United Arab Emirates Dirham prices are likely to use the currency symbol د.إ.\n\nOnce you’re in United Arab Emirates you’ll see costs of items shown in AED and you’ll need to start paying for things in local coins and notes which are often found in the following denominations:\n\nbanknotes - 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 AED and coins - 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils; 1 AED.\n\nCan you officially pay in AUD when you are in United Arab Emirates?\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to officially transact in AUD in United Arab Emirates, which is why it’s time to start getting used to AED and learning more about the currency exchange rates so you’ll know what you’re spending on your trip.\n\nThis guide will walk through all you need to know, including US dollar/United Arab Emirates Dirham rates and where best to get your travel money from.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates DirhamCurrency nameUnited Arab Emirates DirhamISO codeAEDSymbolد.إSubunitFilsCentral Bank1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils; 1 AEDBest travel cards to take to United Arab EmiratesWise\n\nAED coins and banknotes\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the AED coins and banknotes you’ll need to be familiar with when you’re in United Arab Emirates.\n\nAED banknotesAED coinsbanknotes - 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 AEDcoins - 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils; 1 AED\n\nHistory of United Arab Emirates Dirham currency\n\nThe Euro (EUR) is the official currency of the Eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 27 European Union countries. It was introduced in 1999 as an accounting currency and launched as physical coins and banknotes in 2002. The euro is the second-most traded currency in the world and provides the benefits of removing exchange rate risk in the Eurozone.\n\nIs AUD accepted in United Arab Emirates?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the official currency in United Arab Emirates is AED. If you carry AUD with you on your trip, you’ll probably need to exchange it before you can spend.\n\nSometimes when you’re away on a trip abroad you’ll find that merchants will take payments in a selection of major foreign currencies. However, the chances are that where this is offered, you won’t get a good exchange rate for your AUD. Planning smart and convenient ways to spend in AED when you’re away is likely to mean you save on costs in the end.\n\nUsually, having a few different ways to pay and get cash is the best option for travelers and tourists. That’s because you’ll have a back up plan in case one payment method isn’t accepted for any reason, and you can pick the method that’s best suited to the specific transaction. Having a multi-currency card from a provider like Wise, plus your normal bank debit card, and some local cash in AED should mean you’ve always got options. You can use your cash for small purchases and tipping, and make low cost payments and cash withdrawals with your multi-currency card, while keeping your bank card in reserve for emergencies.\n\nUse a travel card on your next trip to United Arab Emirates\n\nUsing a travel debit card in United Arab Emirates is usually cheap, safe and convenient. A few providers in Australia offer multi-currency cards which come with a linked payment account that lets you convert, hold and spend in AED. That allows you to add a balance in AUD and switch over to AED to lock in the exchange rate and set your travel budget.\n\nOnce you have AED in your account there are no extra fees to make payments, and you’ll not have foreign transaction charges to worry about, either.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of a couple of handy travel debit cards you may want to order and use in United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhat is the currency exchange rate for A$ 1 AUD/AED?\n\nIt’s helpful to get to know the live AUD/AED rate so you can easily calculate how much things are costing you while you’re on your trip abroad. The rate you need to focus on is the mid market rate, which is the one banks and major currency services get when buying and selling currencies. This rate isn’t always passed on to customers. Instead you may find that the AUD/AED rate you get when exchanging travel cash includes a markup - an extra fee.\n\nFind the AUD/AED mid-market rate from a currency conversion site or a website like this, so you can keep an eye on the market and compare the rates you’re offered as you travel against the mid-market rate easily. Right now, the mid-market rate for 1 Australian Dollar to AED is 0.6065.\n\nShould I exchange AUD to AED before traveling to United Arab Emirates?\n\nIt’s a good idea to exchange AUD to AED before you head off to United Arab Emirates, as you can often find a better exchange rate and lower overall costs before you travel.\n\nWhen you’re in United Arab Emirates you’re going to need AED in cash for some of your spending - particularly when tipping or making smaller value purchases. Buying your AED travel money in advance can get you better AUD/AED exchange rates, and saves you wasting precious time shopping around for a good deal once you arrive in United Arab Emirates.\n\nTips for exchanging money in United Arab Emirates\n\nAt merchants and ATMs, make sure you’re charged in AED. If you’re asked if you’d rather pay in AUD instead, say no. That’s a sign of dynamic currency conversion, which usually means extra costs. ATMs are widely used in United Arab Emirates so withdrawing money in target-currency is easy, particularly in big cities and Dubai.\n\nBest place to exchange currency in United Arab Emirates\n\nYou can get your AED in United Arab Emirates in a couple of ways.\n\nYou’ll be able to use a travel debit card from a provider like Wise to make convenient payments and cash withdrawals and to convert funds online.\n\nOr if you prefer an offline solution you can carry some cash in AUD to exchange when you arrive. Currency exchange providers are often in airports and hotels, although the exchange shops in a city center are likely to be cheaper overall.\n\nHow to pay in United Arab Emirates?\n\nYou’ll need to have AED to spend in United Arab Emirates. However, generally having a few different payment methods is a good plan. That means that if a merchant won't accept one, you’ve got a back up. It’s also reassuring to know you have a different way to pay if you were unlucky enough to have a card or some travel cash stolen. Here are your key payment options in United Arab Emirates.\n\n1. Debit or credit card\n\nCard payments can be helpful in shops, restaurants and hotels but there will be places where cash is also important. Order a travel card from a provider like Wise for cheap and fast transactions, including card payments and cash withdrawals as and when you need travel money in AED.\n\n2. AED cash\n\nCash is widely used in United Arab Emirates, so it’s worth having some with you at all times. You may want to exchange money to AED before you leave, but it’s also usually convenient to make ATM withdrawals locally once you arrive in United Arab Emirates.\n\nYou’ll usually find you can use a card to make payments in United Arab Emirates, but carrying some cash in AED is also reassuring. It’s often easier for tipping and making smaller purchases, plus you’ve got a nice backup if your card is ever out of action for some reason.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to have both a card and some cash in AED when you’re in United Arab Emirates. Some merchants will prefer cash, but having a card for higher value payments and in busier more tourist places is also convenient. Consider using a travel card from a provider like Wise or Revolut alongside your cash for flexibility.\n\nPaying for the trip in AUD\n\nIf you’re paying for things in United Arab Emirates with a AUD bank card you might find a foreign transaction fee is added. This pushes up your costs when you spend in a foreign currency, and can be tricky to calculate.\n\nTravel debit cards don’t always work this way. When you make purchases in United Arab Emirates using the Wise card you can either choose to convert your account balance to AED in advance in the Wise app, or just leave your balance in AUD and let the card handle the transaction when you pay. You’ll always get the lowest available fee and there are no extra foreign transaction charges.\n\nConclusion - Currency in United Arab Emirates\n\nYou won’t be able to pay in AUD when you visit United Arab Emirates - so learning about the currency you need is essential. Whether you decide to use a travel debit card from a service like Wise , or stock up on AED in cash in advance, knowing the mid-market exchange rate can help you get the best available deal.
