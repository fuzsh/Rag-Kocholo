        "text": "Origin and History\n\nUAE Dirham\n\nUAE Currency Denominations\n\nUAE Currency Exchange Rates\n\nFAQs\n\nDo you want to visit, or are you planning to move to, the UAE soon? To ensure your stay is hassle-free, you must familiarise yourself with the UAE currency and exchange rates. MyBayut has compiled a handy guide to the United Arab Emirates currency—the UAE Dirham—including denominations, exchange rates, top exchange companies and more.\n\nHistory of the UAE Dirham\n\nThe UAE dirham’s story begins in 1973, replacing the Qatar riyal, the main currency since 1966 (except in Abu Dhabi). This switch came after a period where Qatar and Dubai both used the riyal, following the transition from the Gulf rupee.\n\nThe dirham’s initial coin system mirrored the Qatar riyal, with denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 fils plus 1 dirham. Lower value fils coins (1, 5, and 10) were made of bronze, while others used cupronickel.\n\nA 1995 update saw these smaller denominations and the 1 dirham coin shrink. Interestingly, the new 1 dirham matched the size of the old 50 fils, and the new 50 fils coin became smaller and adopted a unique heptagonal shape.\n\nThe first dirham bills came out in 1973. They were followed by a new set in 1982 that removed the 1 dirham and 1,000 dirham notes. Higher-value banknotes were introduced later, with 500 dirhams arriving in 1983 and 200 dirhams in 1989. Finally, the 1,000 dirham note made a comeback in 2000.\n\nOn 28th January, 1978, the dirham was pegged to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights, but in practice, it is set to the US dollar.\n\nWHAT IS THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY OF THE UAE?\n\nThe official United Arab Emirates currency is the UAE Dirham or the Emirati Dirham. The Dirham was put into circulation on 19th May 1973. Before this, the Bahraini Dinar was used in Abu Dhabi, while Dubai and other Emirates used the Qatar-Dubai Riyal.\n\nThe UAE Dirham is pegged to the US Dollar, with a fixed exchange rate of 1 USD = AED 3.67.\n\nThe official abbreviation for the United Arab Emirates Dirham is ‘AED’. However, unofficial abbreviations such as ‘Dh’ or ‘Dhs’ are also used.\n\nUAE CURRENCY DENOMINATIONS\n\nBelow are the UAE currency denominations for the UAE coins and notes.\n\nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES DIRHAM COINS\n\n1 AED or United Arab Emirates Dirham is divided into 100 fils. The UAE Dirham coins come in denominations of 25 fils, 50 fils and AED 1.\n\nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES DIRHAM NOTES\n\nThe UAE Dirham notes come in AED 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 denominations. A new 50 dirham note was launched on the occasion of UAE’s Golden Jubilee. Similarly, to celebrate the hosting of COP28 and the country’s 52nd National Day, the Central Bank of UAE (CBUAE) released a new AED 500 polymer note in 2023.\n\nCheck out the detailed guide to the UAE currency symbols.

This small nation, wealthy due to its oil exports, initially pegged the dinar to the British pound. Today, exchanging one US dollar yields only about 0.30 dinar, solidifying the KWD’s position as the world’s most valuable currency.\n\nWHAT IS THE CURRENCY USED IN DUBAI?\n\nThe official currency used in Dubai is the UAE Dirham, like the rest of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nCAN YOU USE US DOLLARS IN DUBAI?\n\nYes, most malls, restaurants, hotels and stores in Dubai will accept US Dollars. However, retailers may levy extra charges. Remember that certain retailers may not accept older USD notes, so we recommend visiting an exchange bureau to have some Dubai currency denominations.\n\nWHICH ARE SOME OF THE BEST EXCHANGE CENTRES IN DUBAI?\n\nThe well-known money transfer services in Dubai include UAE Exchange, Al Ansari Exchange, Al Fardan Exchange and Al Rostamani Exchange. You can find branches of these money exchange companies in Dubai at these popular locations:\n\nUAE Exchange:\n\nMall of the Emirates, Al Rigga, Al Quoz Mall, Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Branch, Dubai International Airport and Various metro stations.\n\nContact: 600-555-550\n\nAl Ansari Exchange:\n\nMarina Walk, Deira City Centre, Dubai International Airport, Dubai Mall, Ibn Battuta Mall, Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR) and Mall of the Emirates.\n\nContact: 600-546-000\n\nAl Fardan Exchange:\n\nDubai Mall, Mall of the Emirates, Bur Dubai, Satwa, Al Quoz and Dubai Festival City Mall.\n\nContact: 600-522-265\n\nAl Rostamani Exchange:\n\nDubai International Airport, Ibn Battuta Mall, Mall of the Emirates, Dubai Marina and Palm Jumeirah.\n\nContact: 800-4250\n\nSimilarly, you can find money exchange services in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAnd that wraps up MyBayut’s guide to the UAE currency rate and AED denominations.
