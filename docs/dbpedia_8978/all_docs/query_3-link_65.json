        "text": "UAE is one of the top-visited destinations in the world. You want to know why? From the busy streets of Dubai with tall standing buildings to the most beautiful mosque in Abu Dhabi with peaceful surroundings, Dubai has every element to even make you revisit it. Though UAE has transformed a lot over the years, it did not miss out on its cultural heritage and tradition. One of the many things that reflects UAE’s heritage is the Dirhams and its symbols on the currency of the UAE.\n\nDirhams and its symbols\n\nBefore spending the currency, have you ever taken a second to see what’s on the Dirham coins and notes? Apart from just the value of the coin, it has something more to say about the UAE’s cultural importance. It even says how the country has transformed from a fishing town to what UAE is now. Want to learn about the UAE’s culture? Scroll down to find out what Dirhams and its symbols have to say.\n\nName of the currency\n\nTo know about the currency, let’s start with its name. Dirhams is the currency of the UAE that is available both in the form of coins and banknotes. The currency is abbreviated as AED, Dh or Dhs. Dirham is represented in Arabic as د.إ. Though many of them have the national symbol of UAE on it, there are many more Dirhams and its symbols conveying different meanings.\n\nAbout the Dirham coins\n\nThe coins are of three denominations which are 1 Dirham coin, 50 fils coin and 25 fils coin.\n\nThe front side of the coin displays a unique symbol along with the year it is created in both Hijri and Gregorian year. Not just this, you can also find many coins that are exclusively minted to feature the rulers of UAE and to mark the celebration of events.\n\nOn its backside, you will have the United Arab Emirates written in both Arabic and English along with the value of the coin written in Arabic.\n\nSymbols and its representation\n\nBelow are some of the currency symbols and what it conveys.\n\n1. 1 Dirham coin\n\nSymbol: Dallah Coffee Pot\n\nThe symbol of 1 Dirham coin is the Dallah Coffee Pot which represents Emirati culture and the hospitality for guests. How do they welcome guests? Dating back to the earlier days, the Emirati followed a tradition of greeting the guests with a steaming pot of Arabic coffee with some dates. Arabic coffee or Qahwa is a perfect blend of Cardamom and Saffron and is still served as a welcome drink among most families.\n\n2. 50 fils coin\n\nSymbol: Oil Derricks\n\nThe little structures that are on the coin represent the oil derricks of the country. Earlier it was the fishing and pearl diving which contributed the major part of the income. Then there came the discovery of oil in the 1950s and contributed majorly on the economy. The first export was from Abu Dhabi in 1962.\n\n3. 25 fils coin\n\nSymbol: A gazelle\n\nYou can find animals on most of the Dirham coins and notes. What you find on 25 fils coin is a Gazelle, native animal in UAE’s desserts, especially in Abu Dhabi. These form an integral part of wildlife in the country and existing since the rule of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.\n\nAbout the Dirham notes\n\nThe notes are of various denominations which are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000. The front and backside of the notes feature a unique symbol.\n\nSymbols and its representation\n\nBelow are some of the currency symbols and what it conveys.\n\n4. 5 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: Blue Soak in Sharjah\n\nBlue Soak is also called the Central Market, known for trading and shopping. About the place, it is of rich culture with 600 shops selling almost everything. Being built with stunning architecture, it stands as one of the historical monuments in UAE and fits the best in its currency. At the back of AED 5 banknote, you will find the Imam Salem Al Mutawa Mosque.\n\n5. 10 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: Omani Dagger\n\nOmani Dagger is a weapon used for hunting by the men. Being a symbol of power, it will forever remain as an iconic symbol of the UAE’s heritage. Though the use of these has gone, it still makes itself a place as collector’s items because of its cultural importance. If you have gone through the streets of UAE, you would found this as a souvenir in beautiful cases.\n\n6. 10 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: Palm Tree\n\nThe symbol can be found not only in the 10 Dirham note but all over the UAE. It stands as an important symbol representing hospitality as this was the only shelter people had in the past. Now you may find tall buildings like Burj Khalifa but what stood tall in the past, is these Palm trees.\n\n7. AED 20 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: Dhow boats\n\nThe currency has the symbol of a Dhow boat which is yet another important symbol. Dating back to the pre-oil era, people totally relied on dhow boats for water-transport. Being the largest part of income is fish and pearl diving, this dow boats are of much cultural importance.\n\n8. 50 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: Arabian Oryx\n\nLike Gazelle, it is again a creature in the deserts of UAE and the national animal of the country. Not of much cultural importance, it made itself as one of the symbols to mark the presence of wildlife. Due to the efforts of Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, once an extinct animal, now has been saved and walks with pride.\n\n9. AED 100 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: Al Fahidi Fort\n\nThe Al Fahidi fort is one of the important landmarks to talk about the UAE’s heritage. It has been used as a defence fort and place for rulers to reside. However, the place is now the Dubai museum, displaying artefacts for one to understand history.\n\n10. AED 200 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: The Central Bank of UAE building\n\nWhats deserves to be on the currency more than a place manages the currency of the country? The place is located in the Al Fahidi District, making itself in 200 Dirham note.\n\n11. 500 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: The Falcon\n\nThis majestic bird played an important role in the past. Bedouins used this bird to hunt small prey and have been an important survival tactic those days. However, now it has become a pass time for the locals and a cultural aspect for the tourists. In addition, it is the national bird and official emblem of the UAE.\n\n12. AED 1000 Dirham note\n\nSymbol: The Qasr Al-Hosn\n\nBeing on the top denomination, is the Qasr Al-Hosn, the ancient stone watchtower in Abu Dhabi. With this being the safeguard, also served as home to the rulers and seat of the government. This has now become a museum preserving relics and artefacts."
