        "text": "Currency\n\nThe name of the currency in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates is the dirham (AED or Arab Emirate Dirham – also commonly abbreviated to Dhs or DH).\n\nThere are 100 fils in a dirham.\n\nNotes come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 dirhams. The writing on the front of the note is in Arabic while that on the reverse is English.\n\nThere are 1 dirham and 50 and 25 fil coins in common circulation.\n\nUAE Dirham Exchange Rate\n\nThe dirham to dollar exchange rate is fixed at a rate of 3.6725 dirhams to US $1 (or 1 dirham equals 0.272 US dollars). Most world currencies are not pegged to the dollar and so their exchange rate with the dirham fluctuates daily.\n\nMiddle Eastern Countries\n\nDubai is a popular destination for visitors from the Middle East. The city attracts around one million visitors each year from Saudi Arabia alone. Exchange rates for the dirham (AED) with currencies such as the Saudi riyal (SAR), Omani rial (OMR), and Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) are shown below.

They are located all over the city but if you are a tourist it is probably easiest to find one by heading to the nearest shopping mall. Most will have at least one bank and a couple of money exchanges.\n\nDue to the city’s diverse population and mix of tourists, the banks and exchanges in Dubai typically hold more currencies than those in Europe and the US. You’ll have no difficulty exchanging any major currency.\n\nMoney exchanges typically offer better rates than the banks. Airport rates are less competitive than those in the city. Exchange rates at hotel currency exchanges are generally poor. Savvy travellers will just change a small amount at the airport to cover tips and taxi fares and exchange the rest of their cash at one of the money exchanges in the city.\n\nThe exchange centres have longer opening hours than banks. They usually open around 8 or 9 am and close late in the evening. Most also offer a range of additional services including cash advances against credit cards, money transfers, pre-paid credit cards, bill payments, and mobile phone top-ups.\n\nExchanges in Dubai include:\n\nAl Ansari Exchange – over 50 locations in Dubai including branches at Al Khaleej Centre, BurJuman, Century Mall, City Centre Al Shindagha, City Centre Deira, City Centre Mirdif, Dragon Mart, Dubai Festival City, Dubai International Airport, Dubai Mall, Dubai Outlet Mall, Gold and Diamond Park, Ibn Battuta Mall, Madina Mall, Oasis Centre, Souk Madinat Jumeirah, and Wafi Mall.\n\nAl Ghurair Exchange – branches include BurJuman, City Centre Deira, and Mall of Emirates.\n\nAl Rostamani International Exchange – branches include Dubai International Airport, Ibn Battuta Mall, the Mall of the Emirates, Al Khaleej Centre, City Centre Deira, and Dubai Mall.\n\nAl Fardan Exchange – locations include the Festival Centre, Dubai Mall, and the Mall of the Emirates.\n\nUAE Exchange – branches include City Centre Deira, Dragon Mart, Mall of the Emirates, Mercato, and City Centre Al Shindagha.\n\nBanks\n\nDubai is a major financial centre and boasts a good number of both local and international banks.\n\nForeign banks with a significant presence in Dubai include Barclays, Citibank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered.\n\nLocally based banks include Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB), Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD, Mashreq, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, RAKBANK (National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah), and Union National Bank.\n\nHours vary by bank but most are typically Saturday to Thursday from around 8 am to 1 or 2 pm. Banks close on Fridays. Branches at the shopping malls open later and usually close around 9 pm.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nMasterCard, Visa and American Express are accepted at nearly all hotels, restaurants and shops in Dubai.\n\nATMs"
