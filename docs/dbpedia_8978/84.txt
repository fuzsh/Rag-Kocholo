Currency

The name of the currency in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates is the dirham (AED or Arab Emirate Dirham – also commonly abbreviated to Dhs or DH).

There are 100 fils in a dirham.

Notes come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 dirhams. The writing on the front of the note is in Arabic while that on the reverse is English.

There are 1 dirham and 50 and 25 fil coins in common circulation.

UAE Dirham Exchange Rate

The dirham to dollar exchange rate is fixed at a rate of 3.6725 dirhams to US $1 (or 1 dirham equals 0.272 US dollars). Most world currencies are not pegged to the dollar and so their exchange rate with the dirham fluctuates daily.

Changing Money

There are a multitude of banks and money exchanges in Dubai where currency can be exchanged. They are located all over the city but if you are a tourist it is probably easiest to find one by heading to the nearest shopping mall. Most will have at least one bank and a couple of money exchanges.

Due to the city’s diverse population and mix of tourists, the banks and exchanges in Dubai typically hold more currencies than those in Europe and the US. You’ll have no difficulty exchanging any major currency.

Money exchanges typically offer better rates than the banks. Airport rates are less competitive than those in the city. Exchange rates at hotel currency exchanges are generally poor. Savvy travellers will just change a small amount at the airport to cover tips and taxi fares and exchange the rest of their cash at one of the money exchanges in the city.

The exchange centres have longer opening hours than banks. They usually open around 8 or 9 am and close late in the evening. Most also offer a range of additional services including cash advances against credit cards, money transfers, pre-paid credit cards, bill payments, and mobile phone top-ups.

Exchanges in Dubai include:

Al Ansari Exchange – over 50 locations in Dubai including branches at Al Khaleej Centre, BurJuman, Century Mall, City Centre Al Shindagha, City Centre Deira, City Centre Mirdif, Dragon Mart, Dubai Festival City, Dubai International Airport, Dubai Mall, Dubai Outlet Mall, Gold and Diamond Park, Ibn Battuta Mall, Madina Mall, Oasis Centre, Souk Madinat Jumeirah, and Wafi Mall.
