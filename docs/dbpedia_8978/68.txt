The UAE Dirham is the official currency of the United Arab Emirates. It was introduced in 1973 to replace the Qatar and Dubai Riyal. The dirham is divided into 100 fils and is pegged to the US Dollar at a rate of AED three-point-six-five per USD.

Coin designs on the obverse side of the dirham include a Falcon, the national emblem of the UAE, while the reverse side features traditional Arabic calligraphy. In 2018, a new dirham coin was introduced with a more modern design.

Dirham notes come in denominations of five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, and 200 dirhams. The 500 dirham note was introduced in 2000 but is not frequently used.

The UAE Dirham is one of the strongest currencies in the world and is accepted by most businesses in the country.
