        "text": "The first complete and uncensored edition of one of the great Russian epics of the 20th century by a Nobel Prize-winning author contains an introduction, notes, and comprehensive background essays for this panoramic fictional chronicle of twentieth-century Russian history.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nLanguage Notes:\n\nText: English (translation)\n\nOriginal Language: Russian\n\nFrom Library Journal:\n\nAwarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, the late Soviet author is best known for this gigantic epic in which he sought to correct the unfavorable image of the Don Cossacks. With World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Russian Civil War as backdrop, it's an old-fashioned, blood-and-guts narrative, filled with earthly humor and a wealth of colorful characters. The story concerns the fluctuating fortunes of Grigory Melekhov, a young Cossack who is both a hero and a victim of the uprising. This new edition, advertised as being \"complete and uncensored,\" is agreeably readable-a major plus given the work's length and complex scope-although the dialog sometimes offers an incongruous mix of Briticisms (e.g., blighters and buggers) and backwoods American expressions (mebbe not and baccy). The editor, a Slavonic scholar, provides a valuable introduction, notes, bibliography, and background essays. This new edition is highly recommended for all libraries with strong Slavic collections and for any library where a good story is enjoyed, regardless of length.\n\nSister M. Anna Falbo, Villa Maria Coll. Lib., Buffalo\n\nCopyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
