        "text": "Update 11/03/24: Gerry K replaces Andrew Bird\n\nWith Andrew Maxwell, Gerry K, Jamie Oliphant and hosted by Tom Toal!\n\nHeadlined by the hilarious Andrew Maxwell! Renowned for his cutting edge comedy and intrepid social commentary, Andrew has appeared on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, he is also the recognisable voice of MTV’s hit show Ex On The Beach. As well as being a regular on Radio 4 as the host of Welcome to Wherever You Are, he’s frequently on The News Quiz, which he has also guest hosted. As seen on Qi (BBC Two), Live At The Apollo (BBC One), Have I Got News For You (BBC One), Celebrity Juice (ITV2) Mock The Week (BBC Two) Conspiracy Road Trip (BBC3) and High Road Low Road (rté)..\n\nThroughout his career, Andrew has had many sell-out shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and has also performed at The Amnesty / Channel Four’s Secret Policeman’s Ball (alongside Eddie Izzard, Chevy Chase and Dylan Moran), Glastonbury, Kilkenny’s Cat Laughs, The HBO US Comedy Arts Festival in Las Vegas (alongside Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock), and several appearances at the Montreal Just for Laughs Festival.\n\nOpening the show is Gerry K! Anecdotal, observational and refreshingly honest in style, Gerry’s comedy is enriched by a somewhat unique perspective: Real name Gerry Kyei (pronounced “Chay”), Gerry was born in the East End, but grew up in rural Essex, as a rare black face in an almost totally white ­and very parochial area (a million miles away from the traditional Essex stereotype towns like Harlow, Basildon, Romford and Southend). In addition to providing some truly original insights into life in rural England, these early experiences have ensured Gerry’s comedy delights an incredible range of audiences often confounds expectations.\n\nGerry K first hit the stage in 2003 and performed his first Edinburgh show four years later. As well as performing stand-up Gerry has acted on The Bill, Angelo’s and hosted a football forum with Jeff Stelling and\n\nWith up-and-coming comic Jamie Oliphant!\n\nHosted by the brilliantly funny Tom Toal!"
