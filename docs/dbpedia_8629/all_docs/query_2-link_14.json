        "text": "not quite comedy , but i find House M.D humour top notch!\n\n\"Dr. Gregory House: I suppose \"minimally at best\" is your stiff upper lip British way of saying \"No chance in hell\"?\n\nDr. Robert Chase: Actually, I'm Australian.\n\nDr. Gregory House: You put the Queen on your money. You're British. \"\n\n\"Dr. Robert Chase: She was fine two hours ago.\n\nDr. Gregory House: If by fine you mean bleeding profusely out of every orifice, then yeah, I believe you. \"\n\n\"Dr. Gregory House: [to the crowd in the walk-in clinic's waiting area] Hello, sick people and their loved ones! In the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring chitchat later, I'm Doctor Gregory House; you can call me \"Greg.\" I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.\n\nDr. Lisa Cuddy: Short, sweet, grab a file.\n\nDr. Gregory House: This ray of sunshine is Doctor Lisa Cuddy. Doctor Cuddy runs this whole hospital, so unfortunately she's much too busy to deal with you. I am a board... certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology. I am also the only doctor currently employed at this hospital who is forced to be here against his will.\n\n[to Lisa]\n\nDr. Gregory House: That is true, isn't it?\n\n[to crowd]\n\nDr. Gregory House: But not to worry, because for most of you, this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin. Speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this: this is Vicodin. It's mine! You can't have any! And no, I do not have a pain management problem, I have a pain problem... but who knows? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell. So, who wants me?\n\n[nobody moves]\n\nDr. Gregory House: And who would rather wait for one of the other two guys?\n\n[everybody raises their hand] \"\n\ni think i recounted this before, but the greatest comedy scene ever put down on tape in the history of planet is probably in episode 4(?) of Spaced. Which, i hope, still retains something in translation, although i'm doing this from memory so scuse if it's off :\n\nbrian (who's covered in paint) : \"what are you playing?\"\n\ntim : \"Tomb Raider 3\"\n\n\"she's drowning\"\n\n\"yeah\"\n\n\"is that the point of the game?\"\n\n\"depends how you feel really\"\n\n\"how do you feel?\"\n\n\"well, i got a letter from my ex-girlfriend this morning, it was full of you'll-always-be-special and i'll-always-love-you platitudes designed to make me feel better while lessening her deep-seated sense of guilt for running off with a slimy city boy called Dwayne and destroying my faith in everything good and pure\"\n\n\"did it work?\"\n\n\"no, it made me want to drown things\"\n\n(turns and looks at brian for the first time)\n\n\"You've got some paint on you\"\n\n\"it's a literal tribute to the self reflexivity of Rembrandt\"\n\n\"did he like it?\"\n\n\"he's dead\"\n\n\"bloody hell, that really backfired\"\n\nI recently saw the movie Waiting, the movie has some classic greatness!\n\nMonty's Mom: So I called your house today, at two. You were still asleep, weren't you?\n\nMonty: That's an understatement.\n\nMonty's Mom: So what did you do last night? I trust my little angel didn't do anything immoral.\n\nMonty: Well, ummm... Let's see. I started by getting completely hammered drunk. It was bad. Then drove, while intoxicated, to pick up this disease-infested hooker.\n\nMonty's Mom: Uh huh...\n\nMonty: From there... uh, let's see. Me and the hooker went back to my place...\n\nMonty's Mom: The hooker and I.\n\nMonty: Excuse me. The hooker and I went back to my place and from there... God, it was just a blur of intravenous drug abuse and unprotected sex, while taking the Lord's name in vain.\n\nMonty's Mom: Dean, did you know that when Monty was a child everyone thought he was retarded?\n\nMonty: Dean, doesn't my mom look old? I mean, much older than she rightfully should?\n\nMonty's Mom: So why aren't you and Serena still together? I liked her.\n\nMonty: I don't know. I guess it got old. We had a relationship based on orgasms.\n\nMonty's Mom: Oh, how charming. You are being safe aren't you? I don't think I could handle the idea of you reproducing.\n\nMonty: Come on, mom! Of course I'm being safe. I pull out.\n\nMonty's Mom: Yes, well your father pulled out too but we've all seen the tragic end of that story.\n\nMonty: You think I wanna have kids? Absolutely not! That's why I stick to anal sex.\n\nMonty's Mom: If only I had been so lucky.\n\nMonty: You see I don't, I don't work with any exact boundaries of the law because I wasn't consulted when the god damn laws were made. No, instead nameless, faceless politicians, the so called protectors of the moral majority decide what is right and what is wrong. I mean come on. I govern my life around my own personal code of ethics, and I suggest that you do the same. That way if, within the constructs of my own morality, I were to do something that is considered illegal, so be it. I feel no guilt whatsoever and furthermore, if I were to buckle under the social weight of the system by adhering to laws that I do not truly believe in then I would be extinguishing the very fire of patriotism and individuality. So in sense, by having sex with Natasha, I'd be preserving the rights our four fathers fought and died for, right.\n\nMonty: With women, it's always one of two things. Either they won't sleep with you, and then there's really no need to ever call them again. Or they DO sleep with you... and then there's really no need to ever call them again.\n\nDean: How many times can we have the exact same conversation?\n\nMonty: It's like we're stuck in a fucking time paradox where neither our wisdom nor your virginity will ever escape.\n\n[ QUOTE ]\n\nthe greatest comedy scene ever put down on tape in the history of planet\n\n[/ QUOTE ]\n\nHah totally. I also love the scene where Brian is trying to avoid cliches by not *actually* putting brush to canvas but painting with his penis instead.\n\nSpaced is still my no.1 all time favourite comedy and I suspect that it might always be. Whilst there have been many many comedies/sitcoms over the years that try to get laughs from flat/apartment sharing, nothing in my opinion on that subject can remotely touch Spaced. I suppose that the time it first came out there were so many parallels to my own life, that I could instantly relate. Anyone that's ever shared living space needs to watched Spaced. Much that I'm a big fan of Simon Pegg, I don't think any of his work since Spaced has been as funny. We used to watch him before he was famous on the south London comedy club scene, and his standup stuff was truly awesome. Ah, happy days indeed. I've tried American comedy clubs but they just aint working out for me.\n\nI've tried to get into the Mighty Boosh since they started running it on BBC America but just haven't had much luck. Not much more than a titter here and there from me. I guess I need to give it more time!\n\n[ QUOTE ]\n\nGreenwing is really pretty damn good too. Just getting into that now.\n\n[/ QUOTE ]\n\nGreen Wing is hilarious although I think it could have done with being a tad shorter, maybe 45 minutes.\n\nIn my comedy collection I have:\n\nPhoenix Nights - comedy gold. Peter Kay's best work IMO. When the lights go out \"I can'work in these conditions. You call me a DJ?!\" *storms out* \"WHO IS HE?!\" hahah, hilarious.\n\nAli G in Da USAiii - I was never a big fan of Ali G until this series. It's just so funny to watch. The fashion area is the funniest. \"How did you get the work to be all about a team...\" *some shit of an answer..\" [moments later] \"how did you get the work to be so individiual?\" and the guy fucking answers!\n\nLeague of Gentlemen - The classic dark comedy. Got all the series and Live at Drury Lane. It really is great and shows how dark comedy can go.\n\nLittle Britain - Series 1 and 2. Both great but I shan't be getting Series 3 - that was a flop in my eyes.\n\nI also have every episode of South Park on the computer.\n\nAs for my favourite, I'd probably have to go with League of Gentlemen I'd say. Its the sheer darkness and all the characters have value. Series 3 delves a bit from the winning formula of the other 2 but its still great.\n\n\"Hello Dave..\"\n\n\"I'm not dave\"\n\n\"Is dave there?\"\n\n\"There's no dave here..\"\n\n\"Hello dave, I've got some pegs.\"\n\n\"pegs?\"\n\n\"would you like to buy some pegs, dave\".\n\nThat was absolutly hilarious (not correct but close enough).\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzhTVXanSOM video of it here..\n\nThe Sinfest rant box:\n\nI'm thinking about starting a religion which is the exact same as Christianity, same book, same story, same rituals. Heaven, hell, sin, salvation, all that good stuff. The only difference would be that instead of the name \"Jesus\" I would insert the word \"Dude.\" And instead of God it would be \"Voltron.\" Otherwise everything else is in tact. So you got Dude of Nazareth and Voltron Our Father in Heaven. Has a certain ring to it, don't it? I can imagine a Sunday sermon about Dude in the desert being tempted by Satan. What did Dude do? He resisted! Yay! Way to go, Dude! And Genesis would read: In the beginning there was Voltron. Voltron made the earth and the heavens and on the sixth day the Lord Our Voltron created man in his own image. When he saw that it was good, Voltron rested. Moses, of course, would be known as \"Beavis.\" I think it has potential. The Church of Dude. And Voltron. We could play team basketball against the Subgenius people and the Flying Spaghetti Monster Cult. We could form our own league. Winner gets dominion over all existence.\n\n-T.\n\nOn death. Death is a funny thing. It's like magic. We're here. Then poof. We're gone. Imagine what it was like for the first organism to experience death. The amoeba. He must've been like, \"Oh shit! Oh shit! I'm... fading away! What the hell is this sensation!? Aaauughhh! Oh Amoeba God, make it stop!\" And then, after a fierce protoplasmic death rattle, it's gone. Poof. Magic. Maybe his amoeba buddies gave him a proper burial, dressed him up in a little black outfit and placed him in a tiny casket. Actually, no. They all must've been freaked out. It was the First Death Of Anything Ever. They were probably like, \"Dude, what happened to Fred?\" as they watched his lifeless single-cell body float off in the primordial ooze, nary a trace of the jubilance and zest for life he once displayed. Maybe they thought it was cool. Maybe they were like, \"Wow. Check out Fred. He's all frozen! That's so weird! I want to be dead too! I want to be dead like Fred!\" Fred probably started the whole Goth thing. In his wake, he inspired countless other single-cell organisms to be sullen depressives, moping around, wearing little amoeba boots with huge buckles on them, putting on too much mascara and singing Nine Inch Nails songs. So it's all Fred's fault. Fred the Amoeba: Inventor of Goth.\n\n-T."
