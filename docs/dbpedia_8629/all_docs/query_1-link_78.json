        "text": "Setups and punchlines are the basic elements of stand-up comedy bits. Generally speaking, the setup puts forth a situation or an idea, on which the punchline provides a new, sometimes radically altered, perspective. Ideally, this twist or reversal creates a dialectical relation of tension between the two that cannot be resolved by appeal to either setup or punchline, but traps thought between them in an 'epistemological problem' as comedian Louis CK put it. For comedians, setups and punchlines are basic tools, practical and concrete ways to create and organize material. They are also familiar to humor theorists. One of the main theories of humor focuses on incongruity: jokes involve bringing together elements that don't seem to belong together. However, incongruity by itself is not enough to make something funny; the elements need to be related in a more precise way so as to open up a range of imaginative possibilities between them, enabling reflexive digressions. In this paper, I offer an analysis of how a setup and punchline relate to each other as a reversible figure-ground pair (in the sense of Roy Wagner). Through exploring the semiotic relations in specific examples of comedy bits I will show how incongruities can be evoked and calibrated, and discuss how the bit may be related further through figure-ground relations to other elements, such as the persona of the comedian, current events, or cultural conventions. The research is based on 20 months of ethnographic field work in Finland, including becoming an amateur comedian myself.\n\nThe bond between language and ideology has caught the attention of discourse analysts. Investigating this bond, discourse analysts have further demonstrated that everyday interactions are embedded in and with different ideologies. Likewise, the performance of humour is motivated by the interlocutors’ ideological inclinations. On the strength of these propositions, this study attempts a critical analysis of the ideologies in selected Nigerian stand-up comedy routines (NSC), with particular reference to Fairclough and Wodak’s notions of ideology in discourse. Routines were purposively selected from editions of “Night of a Thousand Laughs” (NTL), the earliest stand-up event and a stand-up comedy road show in Nigeria, so as to focus on the performances of practicing and professional stand-up comedians in the country. Two categories of ideologies were found in NSC routines: the first relates to the art of comedy performance while the second relates to the country’s sociocultural context....\n\nThis essay examines the work of stand-up performer Hannah Gadsby in relation to persona, extending the conventional reach of persona studies to the realm of live performance and comedy. The author analyses Hannah Gadsby’s risky decision to kill off her widely adored comic persona in her 2017 show Nanette, replacing it with a persona that shot her to global celebrity and changed the power dynamics with her audiences. The essay investigates Gadsby’s contention that stand-up is bad for her mental health and is predicated on an abusive relationship with audiences. It considers her strategies of comic unmaking and remaking in the contexts of women working in a sexist industry within misogynist societies. It also interrogates Gadsby’s dramaturgies of foregrounding persona creation and the performative dialogic of ‘face’ or ‘mask.’ Gadsby’s postmodern deconstruction of her own comic artistry and her exposure of the limits of stand-up as a form are examined through a new concept of meta-per...\n\nCulture has to do with representations which are privately stored in a number of individuals and publicly transferred from one person to another maintaining a certain stability in the process of transmission. Widely shared cultural representations involve a mutual manifestness of assumptions making the cognitive environment of a collectivity become wider. In this article, it will be argued that stand-up comedians play an important role in the transmission, reinforcement and adjustment of cultural representations, especially when they are engaged in humorous monologues whose provocation of laughter is not based on explicitly linguistic strategies, but lies in the joy of mutual acknowledgment of what culture is (or should be) like. This claim will be illustrated with an eightcase typology of possible effects from comedians’ cultural representations concerning sex roles in society.\n\nBeing a universal trait of human language behaviour, verbal humour has ultimately been a recognized field of research in linguistics. Such subject of study infuses different forms of distraction such as stand-up comedy where laughter thrives. This response is considerably noticed in the shows of Abdelkader Secteur, an Algerian comedian. On the basis of such reaction, this paper aims to disclose the linguistic reasons behind the comedian’s verbal humour which lead to laughter. The question that arises “what makes the stand- up comedian’s discourse humorous?” suggests that the comedian uses a figurative language embodied in a chunk of opposite scripts which mark his performance. To check the proposed hypothesis, an empirical study is given based on a selection of the humorist’s two performances derived from You Tube downloads given to a to an sample of thirty-two Algerian participants be watched then analyzed through the general theory of verbal humour (hereafter, GTVH).\n\nIn Nigeria, in relation to the aforesaid functions, everyday citizens and professional humourists use humour to express their expectations from and disappointments in the socio-political leadership of the country. Common Nigerian jokes indicate the country’s travails with ethnicity and failed political leadership. They also enunciate populist perspectives on nationhood, identity and the challenges of everyday living. In spite of the centrality of humour to daily life in Nigeria, scholarly interests in its sociocultural, political, rhetorical, interactional and interpersonal dimensions have been very minimal. According to Obadare (2016), it is as if once something is categorised as humour, it is expunged from any serious interrogations. There are diverse and numerous dimensions of humour in Nigeria, given the country’s extensive and still expanding popular culture landscape. A handful of these dimensions are examined in the papers that make up this special issue of EJHR.\n\nThis study focuses on stand-up comedy in English at Rome’s Comedy Club and investigates how the comedians and the audience deal with humor based on stereotypes about Italians and foreigners living in Italy (e.g. culture shock, cultural differences and identity issues). In addition, this article discusses how comedians and the audience interact (mostly in English and sometimes in Italian) and negotiate humor regarding sensitive topics. The data analysis demonstrates that the comedians consciously exploit the context and accommodate to the audience to guarantee a positive response. In turn, the audience’s sense of superiority is fulfilled by the disparagement of comedians in general and self-disparagement. Most importantly, the audience shows that they do not take audience-disparagement at face value."
