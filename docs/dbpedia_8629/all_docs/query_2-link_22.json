        "text": "I thought this would be a fun thread, because although it's fun to discuss which comedians we like the most, one of the things about comedy is that people have comedians they detest, as well.\n\nI don't know if anybody else feels similar, but I can't really get into stand up comedy, it rarely really makes me laugh. It's quite annoying, going to a stand up gig or watching a DVD with everyone splitting their sides laughing and yourself just going \"Urrr.. Yeah, har har har!\" If anyone feels the same way, but has some sweet comedians to recommend, that would be awesome!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, I'll begin:\n\nI've four comedians that I do really enjoy, and in no real order:\n\nPaul Merton, one of the wittiest men of all time, in my opinion and one of the few that consistently makes me laugh out loud.\n\nBill Bailey, because he just IS funny.\n\nStewart Lee, whom I discovered when I got offered tickets to go and see him and I said yes as I had nothing else to do. What a joyous surprise when I realised I was witnessing one of the funniest people I think, ever to exist. I saw 'Britain's Favourite High Street Coffee Outlet', which I believe may have been renamed to 'If You Prefer A Milder Comedian, Please Ask For One'. His 'critique' of Frankie Boyle and Richard Hammond were possibly the funniest things I've ever witnessed (I couldn't breathe at point).\n\nEddie Izzard, although I've only discovered him recently, he is awesome.\n\nAs for most 'uncomical'... Stephen K. Amos, Michael Mcintyre and Sean Lock would probably be the comedians I enjoy least..\n\nSooo, what are your comedy tastes OcUK?\n\nWhy the Micheal McIntyre hate? I see it around - why people say 'sorry' for liking him - where does this stem from?\n\nI have a theory - does any one not fit into this? --\n\nPeople who like and find Lee Evans funny do not like McIntyre, and vice versa..\n\nI can't stand Evans and his 'slapstick style', but find McIntyre's observational comedy very funny. People I've asked about this always seem to like one or the other but not both.\n\nWhy the Micheal McIntyre hate? I see it around - why people say 'sorry' for liking him - where does this stem from?\n\nI have a theory - does any one not fit into this? --\n\nPeople who like and find Lee Evans funny do not like McIntyre, and vice versa..\n\nI can't stand Evans and his 'slapstick style', but find McIntyre's observational comedy very funny. People I've asked about this always seem to like one or the other but not both.\n\nHe has good material but the fact the laughs at his jokes more than his own audience winds me up too much when watching him."
