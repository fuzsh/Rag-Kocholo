        "text": "Al Murray is bringing the iconic character to the King’s Theatre on Friday, June 28 as part of the Al Murray: Guv Island tour promising audiences “some absurd explanations for things, all wrapped up in the guise of common sense”.\n\nAl says for people who have seen any of this shows before its “that vibe but all new”.\n\nREAD NEXT: Legendary musician to host solo gig in Glasgow\n\n“There’s stuff about TikTok, there’s some stuff about kids these days,” he says.\n\n“There’s stuff about state of the nation stuff, who the Pub Landlord would send to Rwanda which is things like people who get to the ticket barrier without a ticket.\n\n“And there’s a thing about how we’re being colonised by the Americans and turned into Americans so they're the headlines from some of it.\n\n“But I talk to the audience a lot and they’re involved in all the stories and the flow of the show.”\n\nThis year marks 30 years since the Pub Landlord made his first ever appearance at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1994 in the show Pub Internationale with Harry Hill.\n\nAl came up with character “by accident to fill a gap” and says its \"quite amazing” for him for The Guv to still be so popular after three decades.\n\n“If you asked me to explain why [the Pub Landlord is still popular] I wouldn’t know,” he says.\n\n“I think it’s the sticking with it, the refreshing it every time we do a tour. He’s the same but it’s all new.\n\n“Which is afterall what comedians who don’t play characters do. Any other comic, the way they present it doesn’t change but what they’re talking about might.”\n\nHe continued: “When I came across it, I realised quite quickly that basically because what it is is an attitude I would be able to keep it going for a while.\n\n“But when I first came up with it, I didn’t think 30 years.”\n\nIn the 30 years since the conservative publican was created, Al says its “weird” that his point of view has come to take centre stage in the political landscape.\n\nHe explains: “When I started doing this he was kind of reactionary and he wasn’t partciualry pro-European and all that sort of stuff.\n\n“And what’s happened in the decades since is that kind of point of view went centre stage and I think that’s really interesting.\n\n“It means it gets refreshed all the time by events in a way in a way I never imagined.\n\n“There was a period where people would say to me ‘why are you still doing that act, it’s all out of date that point of view’ and I remember thinking it isn’t, you’re just looking in the wrong place.\n\n“Being reactionary and that sort of archetype is eternal.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Opening date revealed for city centre Popeyes\n\nDespite visiting Glasgow as the Pub Landlord several times over the years, Al says he still gets a “buzz” performing in front of the city’s audiences and says he “loves” playing here.\n\nHe said: “What I feel when I’m in Scotland is the character is automatically more English when he’s not in England so that gives an immediate point of engagement.\n\n“And I love all that, I love the sort of old school banter that might be there with a Scottish audience.\n\n“Glasgow audiences are famous for the possibility they might give you a hard time, renowned for being feisty, and I love all that.”\n\nSo where does Al like to go when he’s in Glasgow when he’s not on stage?\n\n“Cafe Gandolfi,” he reveals.\n\n“I absolutely love going there for breakfast.\n\n“And I like Ubiquitous Chip and Oran Mor.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t just go there to work, it’s a place I go for fun.\n\n“It’s one of those places which is just the best vibe, the best groove.\n\n“I’m looking forward to coming back because it’s been ages.”"
