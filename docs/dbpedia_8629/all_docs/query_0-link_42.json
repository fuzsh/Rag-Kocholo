Headlining the event in Southport, Merseyside, will be John Bishop, with support from Katherine Ryan, Jason Manfordt, Al Murray, Paul Chowdhry and will be hosted by Judi Love.\n\nEarlier this year, the promoters M&B announced a Comedy In The Park event in Kettering, and 8,000 tickets were sold in just 48 hours, so comedy fans are advised to order early to avoid disappointment.\n\nOperations Director James Penny commented,\n\n“We are excited to bring this huge comedy event to Merseyside .

Judi’s motto ‘Laughter is Healing’ provides a very accurate insight into how she deals with life’s many obstacles. Judi will take everyday situations, add her unique perspective and turn it into something hilarious. It’s the type of humour that resonates in people from all walks of life. Love has proved herself to be a hilarious comedian in both her stand-up and across TV and radio.\n\nIn addition to comedy you can expect award-winning street food; pop up cocktail bars, cafés, bars, shops and stalls. The ultimate night out for any comedy lover!!\n\nThe promoters are confident that the event will be something to look forward to next year as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. However, because of the size of the location, plans can be adapted to run the event with social distancing should that be required and the event will be completely safe and COVID compliant."
