Expect belly laughs!\n\nGoing from strength to strength, Travis has had a busy few years writing for the BritBox revival of the classic hit show Spitting Image, with recent TV appearances including Channel 4's Black, British and Funny, ITV2's The Stand Up Sketch Show, Dave's Late Night Mash, Comedy Central's Drunk History and Channel 4's The Artists.\n\nHe is the creator and co-presenter of the popular weekly boxing podcast Undefeated, with fellow comedian KG tha Comedian. Travis was nominated for The Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year in 2016.\n\nTravis has supported Dave Chappelle on his Sticks & Stones London tour and Britain's Got Talent Golden Buzzer winner Kojo Anim on his nationwide Taxi tour. He has also performed alongside Katherine Ryan, Jon Richardson, Rob Delaney and Russell Howard.\n\nIn 2018 Travis was filmed while performing alongside Dave Chappelle as part of the production Dave Chappelle and Friends directed by Stan Lathan, with the year before closing the year out performing to a sold out crowd at the famous West End Palladium Theatre as part of the U Got Jokes comedy show, with his performance receiving particularly high acclaim.\n\n'Travis Jay shows he is a polished performer with the wit and charm to say important things to the masses without them even noticing' Nooruddean Choudry, JOE\n\n'A triumph of attitude… energetically entertaining' Steve Bennett, Chortle\n\n'He’s amazing' Dave Chappelle\n\n'A confident and engaging performer… plenty of laughs throughout… a fresh and funny perspective that anyone in the audience would be enlightened by' Ross Crae, Sunday Post\n\n'Confident, competent and clear on his comedic voice' Elliot Gonzalez, iTalk Telly\n\n'very funny' Jay Richardson, The Scotsman\n\n'Impeccable impressions… extremely likeable and hilarious' Callum Wilson, Edinburgh Festivals Magazine\n\n'Laidback yet cleverly astute… Travis Jay’s finely-tuned set displays his versatile comedic chops, with the warm delivery of an old friend' Aisha Josiah, Fringebiscuit\n\nStudio\n\n£15\n\nTravis's website\n\nX Travis Jay\n\nInsta travisjayent\n\nFb Travis Jay\n\nTiktok travisjayent0\n\n20 Sep from £15\n\nC\n\ncomedy\n\nLucy Porter - No Regrets!\n\nThe irrepressible Lucy Porter bounces back into action with a show all about regrets.\n\nFrank Sinatra had too few to mention, but Lucy’s got hundreds, and she’s prepared to go into graphic detail about all of them. Disastrous dates, professional calamities, ruined friendships and parenting fails. Lucy describes all the mistakes she’s made, works out why they happened, and ponders how her life would have turned out if she’d acted differently.\n\nLucy looks at the things we might all collectively regret - not sticking to the work-life balance we strove for during lockdown, not realising that clapping for the NHS wouldn’t be enough to save it, allowing people we thought were quite fun on TV to become politicians.\n\nHow does regret tie in with guilt and shame? As a middle-aged, middle-class, left-leaning ex-Catholic, guilt is one of Lucy’s top five hobbies (along with going to the garden centre, doing jigsaws, making bread and watching subtitled foreign dramas on Netflix. She’s also ashamed of all these hobbies.)\n\nIt’s not all negative though. If you regret something, you can use it to change your ways: see the thing you regret as your rock bottom, and let it spur you on to become a better person. Lucy looks at how she can use shameful or annoying things from her past to change her future.\n\nLucy regrets volunteering at the school fete when her kids were younger, because now she’s committed to being the Hook a Duck Lady twice a year for the rest of her life. Maybe she could learn to say No a bit more?\n\n'Impeccably punch-lined anecdotes...

Sure, they turned thirty, got diagnosed with ADHD and had top surgery, but perhaps the biggest adjustment is to the revelation that maybe their mum was right all along? Not about everything obviously, but they must concede that on teen drinking and being 'forced' to go on holiday, Keyworth Sr probably had some solid points.\n\nOn their choice to have surgery, Keys feels lucky in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to the people they have around them. That said, it was a long road and there’s still conversations to be had about their gender identity and what this means in a world that seems increasingly hard on gender non-conforming people.\n\nBut as Sarah goes home for the ﬁrst time post-surgery, to celebrate their mum’s own milestone birthday, it’s the conversations with their nearest and dearest that have them reﬂecting on their year and asking some big questions.\n\nWhat does acceptance look like? From whom does it matter?

(Warning: This is a stand up show. NOT a rodeo.)\n\nRussell Hicks is here to stay and he really is happy to be here.\n\nSo, why don’t British People believe him?\n\nHot off the back of a starring role in an Amazon Prime show that nobody watched, and was cancelled immediately, American Stand Up comedian Russell Hicks, lives in the UK where he allegedly performs stand-up comedy. Naturally, his parents still think he makes his money through some kind of illegal activity, so buy some tickets and help prove his legitimacy!\n\nYou may have heard Russell as the voice of Sky Comedy, seen him entertain studio audiences at ‘Have I Got News for You’ or caught him opening for the likes of Al Murray or ‘Britain’s Got Talent’ winner Axel Blake. He’s performed up and down this country, picking up three Leicester Festival nominations along the way. He’s even been officially declared a Global Talent by Arts Council England.\n\nKnown for his improvised performances, Russell has amassed millions of views online and gained a devoted following of fans who’ve come to know that no two shows will be the same. Considered one of the best improvisers in the country, Russell has appeared on some of the UK’s biggest networks. He has starred in several episodes of ITV’s ‘Stand Up Sketch Show’ and won the Channel 4 competition series ‘Captive Audience’ with his fully improvised comedy, and starred in Prime Video series ‘Lovestruck High’ narrated by Lindsay Lohan as the loveable Texan Coach Hughes.\n\nSuitable for ages 16+ years.\n\nStudio\n\n£16\n\nRussell's website\n\nX Russell Hicks\n\nInsta russellhickss\n\nFb Russell Hicks\n\nTiktok russellhickscomedy\n\n25 Oct from £16\n\nC\n\ncomedy\n\nF\n\nfamily\n\nC\n\nchildren & young people\n\nWiFi Wars\n\nWiFi Wars returns with a very spooky version of the live comedy game show where you all play along!\n\nLog in with your smartphone or tablet and compete in a range of games, puzzles and quizzes to win the show - and prizes!\n\nHosted by comedian Steve McNeil (team captain on UK TV's hit comedy/gaming show Dara O’Briain’s Go 8 Bit) and aided by Guinness World-Record-Breaking tech whizz, the award-winning Rob Sedgebeer!\n\n'Not To Be Missed' The Guardian\n\nTime Out - Critic's Choice\n\nThe Times - Hot List\n\nMetro - Top Ten London Geek Nights Out\n\nStudio\n\n£15 | £12 under 16s\n\nFamily and Friends (4 people) £48\n\nWifi Wars website\n\nX Wifi Wars\n\nInsta wifiwarsuk\n\nFb WiFi Wars\n\n29 Oct from £12\n\nM\n\nmusic\n\nD\n\ndance\n\nT\n\ntheatre\n\nHundred Watt Club - A Burlesque and Cabaret Spooktacular Speakeasy!\n\nBack at Norden Farm by popular demand, Hundred Watt Club invites you to peek inside their cabinet of curiosities and celebrate Halloween with an evening of bizarre burlesque, queer cabaret and sublime circus entertainment.\n\nExpect spinetingling striptease, madcap comedy, dizzying circus stunts and all manner of cabaret tomfoolery.
