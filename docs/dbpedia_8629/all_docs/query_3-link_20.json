        "text": "Al Murray Comedian is The Pub Landlord but before that, he studied History at Oxford and rubbed shoulders with the likes of Stewart Lee, Ben Moor and Richard Herring in the Oxford Revue. He went on to write for Week Ending and Spitting Image before working on his now infamous solo act.\n\nHe supported Frank Skinner on his world tour of 1992. Unfortunately, Al soon became bored with the rigidity of his material with an act which was based around sound effects. Fortunately, in the same year, he met Harry Hill at a Radio 4 commissioning meeting.\n\nAfter subsequently performing stand up with Murray at the Edinburgh Festival, Hill asked him to come up with an act for his Pub Internationale show. In 1994, Murray created the Pub Landlord.\n\nHe appeared as Harry Hill’s big brother Alan in The Harry Hill Show from 1997-2000. After a wrangle as to whether he was ‘too famous’ to win it, Al won the Perrier Award in 1999. The show was now based around the Pub Landlord. This led to stage shows including And A Glass Of White Wine For The Lady, My Gaff, My Rules and Who Dares Wins.\n\nAl Murray comedian has taken his Perrier award winning show ‘The Pub Landlord’ from the stand-up circuit to television. ‘Time Gentlemen Please’ debuted on TV in 1999 to critical acclaim with Murray starring and co-writing with comedian Richard Herring.\n\nAl Murray, The Pub Landlord, on his one-man-mission to put the Great back in Great Britain. His hilarious live stand-up shows have made him one of the most popular comedy acts in the country. He won the Perrier Award (after 4 successive nominations). He then secured Olivier Award nominations for both of his sell-out London West End runs.\n\nDon’t miss the chance to go see the man who understands that, ‘rules is rules, and if we didn’t have rules then where would we be, eh? That’s right, FRANCE!’ And, don’t forget, it’s ‘pint for the fella, glass of white vine-fruit based drink for the lady.’\n\nFor corporate hosting and cabaret enquiries, check your desired event date does not clash with Al’s tour dates by clicking here: AL MURRAY DATES"
