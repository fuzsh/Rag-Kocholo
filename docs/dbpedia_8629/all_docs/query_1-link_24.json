        "meta_description": "The ranking is very intentional and deliberate, starting with the very best, ending with the very worst. \n\nNevertheless, assigning each person a rating (good, bad, awful, whatever) isn't such a precise \"science\" because some comedians are very uneven, or some may be charismatic but with weak material, or unlikable but with OK material. The label/rating I give out is intended to be approximate rather than precise.\n\nVery few are listed as \"the best\". That's because there are very few comics who fulfill all the criteria necessary to not make me switch them off after just a few minutes. My criteria used to be lower, which is when I sometimes had interest and patience in watching 30 minutes of an average comedian, but now only a few are deserving of my time; these few I can watch for over an hour without ever getting bored.\n\nCriteria:\n\n1. Charisma and an interesting personality. A comedian needs to be unique in some way otherwise he's just a random Joe Shmoe off the street telling (bad) jokes, and the moment a comic seems average he is automatically of no use, to me at least. Just as I don't listen to average music (except when checking out new stuff), I completely try to avoid comedic mediocrity: being bored AND annoyed is way too much. In fact, \"comedians\" such as Amy Schumer are so bad they are actually worse than a randomly picked pedestrian telling jokes. But nepotism will do that... She is the niece of a powerful Washington politician and she is also that other thing, so all doors to show-biz were open for her. \n\n2. Courage to be politically incorrect - which is pretty much the same thing as being honest, as opposed to being an Establishment sycophant: a \"minorities pleaser\", in other words a devious, calculating liar who pretends to care so much for women, blacks and gays that he can't ever make \"fun\" of them. EVERYBODY should be made fun of. Life is absurd in all of its forms, and all of it contains comedic potential. No gender, race or religion can be exempt, for any reason. The moment you start censoring yourself to such an extent you're doomed - as a person as well as a comedian. \n\n(Except invalids, that's where I draw the line. Jokes about the paraplegic and similar junk is ugly. But just because I draw the line there doesn't mean everybody else should: each person has their own tastes, limits, tolerance levels... We can't allow anyone - least of all hypocritical, dishonest liberals - to impose such Orwellian restrictions on us. Far from being \"liberators\" of society and mankind, they are in fact the biggest censors and freedom-of-speech opponents on the political spectrum. Liberalism is oppression, as all offshoots of Marxism are.)\n\nShow some balls out there on stage, or go home and shut up. We have enough cowards in the media as it is - among actors, musicians, directors, athletes, political analysts, journalists, and authors - so we don't need liars and phonies in stand-up comedy too, which is (or should be) a special, unique arena which serves as the last refuge for Free And Open Speech. Once we allow Reds to destroy stand-up comedy as well as everything else they'd (nearly) destroyed, we will be one huge step closer to totalitarianism which Soros and his gang have been pushing for in the last few decades. (If this is news to you then know that you've been successfully brainwashed: it's not too late for you, but curing you will prove a difficult task, mostly because you'd been trained/programmed not to think for yourself, or not to think at all. Learning to think at an adult age can be a daunting task for the intellectually apathetic.)\n\nUnfortunately, most comedians lack the balls to be honest. They just don't have it in them. Whether that's because they are privately dishonest too, or because they are afraid of \"offending\" someone, is irrelevant: the results are the same. Especially these days there is so much cowardice and so much obsequiousness, because truth and honesty are considered \"racist, homophobic, misogynist, Islamophobic, transphobic\" (by hypocrites and the New Moral Police) and whatever other dumb-phobic words these people had invented in the meantime while I was typing up this text. Dishonesty becomes obvious rather quickly in most comedy routines, within 5 minutes or even just 30 seconds: these types of pseudo-comedian con-artists are quickly identifiable and the moment I smell that stench of political correctness i.e. \"playing it safe\" I shut them off, forever. No second chances. Once a devious sell-out, always a devious sell-out. \n\nComedy has to be all-inclusive, which is something that - very ironically - liberals struggle to understand and accept. They allegedly want an \"all-inclusive egalitarian\" society, but with their ultra-biased non-inclusive routines Red comics prove that they have no interest in that: they actually want MORE EQUALITY for minorities and women than for example male Caucasians. Much more. They want white men to be relegated to the status of pariahs of society, to have their rights curtailed, and all in the name of virtue-signaling, just to satisfy their own narcissism (coz narcissists want constant acceptance and praise, and they will always seek it among those who offer more of it i.e. to the highest bidder, and liberals just happen to be currently the highest bidders), but more importantly to have more job security in a media landscape dominated by the Left, which doesn't care who is funny, just who is politically compliant. So much black-listing is going on behind the curtains, not \"just\" people getting \"cancelled\" which is done out in the open - as warning to anyone else who wants to \"step out of line\" and dare question the Grand New Liberal Status Quo. \n\nExtreme bias is ugly and malicious, can be a sign of low intelligence too, besides which it makes a comic very predictable and boring, plus makes him out to be a calculated d****e as opposed to a genuine, frank character who lets it all hang, who takes risks, doesn't play it safe for fear of offending some minority of uptight lunatics who can't take a joke. Cowardice isn't funny in a comedian. Balls are. Comedians are funny when they are brave, not when they are compliant. Nobody wants to hear a routine consisting only of G-rated humour.\n\nThis means that if you make fun of men, make fun of women too. If you make fun of \"rednecks\", then make fun of blacks and Orientals as well. If you constantly ridicule moderate Christians then at least have the decency to poke fun at Islamic extremism as well (if you dare). If you make fun of the Right, mock the Left too. Be \"all-inclusive\", since that is what our Marxist Overlords allegedly want...\n\nEspecially mock the Left. Because they are the ones in power, dominating nearly all discourse and propaganda, and because we've been fighting them in recent decades. They are the spoil-sports, the NWO Moral Police, the screaming righteous street preachers, the fanatically aggressive lynch mobs, the zealous regressive hypocrites, the narcissists who loathe the world because it isn't exactly to their liking. What was that last movement that so fanatically tried to \"mold\" the world to their own liking? The Nazis, who else. National-socialists. Not a coincidence, at all.\n\n3. A good sense of humour. This may seem bleedin' obvious, but it's hardly a given. Most comics are mediocre or even pitifully unfunny; they go for the cheap, obvious stuff and they do it in ways that are off-putting, boring, cringy, or their personality just isn't up to scratch. Not EVERY confident person seeking laughs can just hop on a stage and be funny. You can give a talented comedian weak material and they might be able to save face to some extent on account of their other strengths, but give average material to a hack with a mediocre personality/charisma and/or low comedic instincts and the jokes have absolutely no chance, they will bomb like a Chevy Chase TV show. Evidently, gifted comics very rarely use weak/average material, so this was just a hypothetical thing...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe list might change, because I might add a few names I'd omitted, or that I checked out for the first time recently.\n\nMany big names are missing, such as Lenny Bruce or Don Rickles, because while I know (some of) them from movies I'm not familiar with their stand-up stuff.\n\nI don't pretend that I am an expert on stand-up comedy, I am not. I haven't watched numerous stand-up comics as some other people have done. This is hence not a comprehensive list by a long shot - but it does contain a lot of the very best ever, that much I am certain of. Besides, my lists always give you some information/descriptions unlike most other lists that are cobbled up in 5 minutes. I may not have everyone here, but at least there are (accurate, brilliant) descriptions of the ones that are here.",

        "text": "THE VERY GOOD (WHO IS OCCASIONAL QUITE MEDIOCRE)\n\nCan be great, some top material, but also occasionally quite unfunny because full of s*** which is when the comedy suffers - because it has no truth at its foundation. And considering that he does lots of political/social commentary he (as all such comics) needs to do proper research i.e. needs to understand the situation on each issue REALLY WELL in order to joke about in a way that reflects reality as opposed to someone's fantasy or sponged propaganda. He understands the gender stuff very well, he's as clever as a shrink, but when it comes to politics and social issues he bases his jokes on complete fabrications and lies. Sort of like making a joke centered around the perceived truth that Italians are introvert and quiet: such a routine would never work because the crowd would be totally confused. \"What's he talking about? Italians aren't introvert and quiet.\" (This could work only as absurdist humour used ironically, but that's not what I am referring to here.) Sometimes he nails it (but only gender relations and stuff that doesn't require research i.e. stuff he can pick up from personal experience), but sometimes he just goes into outer space and bases the jokes on total baloney, which is the political stuff that he knows absolutely nothing about. He is one of those \"headline readers\". They understand 5% of an issue but feel as if they know 90% of it.\n\nBasically, he is one of those intelligent people who are too lazy to better themselves. Such people have great observation skills in terms of personal experience i.e. they can excel only at things they have close and direct contact with (i.e. women i.e. his great understanding of the genders), i.e. stuff that doesn't require extraneous effort, but he's completely hopeless with the stuff that requires study, lots of reading, and deep analysis. Such people let the media and their schools do ALL of their thinking for them, which is why 95% of all people are zombies essentially...\n\nFor example, his slavery jokes often bomb because it simply isn't true that blacks were the only slaves and that whites were never slaves themselves. He clearly knows zero about the history of slavery - a trait he shares with 90% of the American/Western populations... You gotta root your comedy in reality, especially observational comedy, otherwise you can only make equally clueless people laugh.\n\nBut that's why great stand-ups are so rare. Not only do they have to fulfill the various high standards required to be funny and likable, they also have to be educated and intelligent enough to base their social humour on facts, not fiction. Chris Rock is severely under-educated and under-informed hence nearly all of his political humour is idiotic.\n\nHis \"racism\" doesn't help either. I'm not saying he hates white people, but does he like them? Certainly a question mark there. Someone this biased should not be doing racial humour. In the 90s his racial stuff was much better than it's been recently, and was incomparably funnier. Lately he's been sounding like a bitter old racist (I'm not saying he is, just saying how he comes off), and even the blacks in his audiences aren't laughing nearly as much because they can tell that he's going too far, and that the \"points\" he is making are far-fetched and fallacious. In the show \"Tamborine\" he sounds like a mini-Farrakhan. If a white person talked about blacks the way he does about whites in that show they'd be crucified, jailed, perhaps even threatened.\n\nOn that same DVD he states that \"only in America is the legal system unjust\". That is typical American-centric imbecility that one only hears from totally clueless Americans who seem oblivious of the fact that there are 200 other countries out there, and that the majority of them are far worse off than even the poorest regions in the States. But he can't know that, because he only reads headlines and has never spent any significant amount of time abroad. The \"ghetto\" and Hollywood is all he really knows, and those are very niche. To even suggest that America is the most corrupt country in the world is amazingly cretinous, but to actually say it - without joking - is a sign of extreme naivety and very poor education. Stupid he certainly isn't, but if he passed 5th grade it would only be because they let him slip through.\n\nIn \"Never Scared\" he actually says \"drugs will never be legalized in America because then the white man can't make money from putting brothers and sistaz in jail\". Now, how the hell does anyone make money off holding all these people in prison? If all American prisoners worked in labour camps and actually produced something in factories doing 12-hour shifts, I might even semi-agree, but they produce almost nothing (on average), but instead cost the state (hence the taxpayers) huge amounts of money. (Chris probably thinks prisons cost nothing, he has no clue how the world really works, he is rather paranoid and preoccupied with the \"white threat\".) The gov't would much rather prefer that the \"brothers and sistaz\" were all free and employed, rather than being on welfare or in prison - because that costs the state money, it's a huge burden on the system. Besides, if drugs were legalized then EVERYBODY would be in on the cocaine and heroin trade, hence blacks (who Chris implies are the main dealers) would no longer hold a monopoly on that (new) industry.\n\nFurthermore, in that same show Chris goes on an incredibly silly rant about a white conspiracy to keep \"brown countries\" poor on purpose. This was so idiotic that I found myself smiling at the very idea, because it's such a typically anti-white dumb racist conspiracy. But don't think he was saying it for a laugh, he wasn't: he was using this as the TRUTH onto which he'd string jokes. (Modern stand-up comedy has as much MORALIZING as actually humour, jokes.) That show is generally completely off the charts crazy in terms of its \"logic\", as if Rock were himself high on crack which he's advocating should be legalized. There's some great material in that show too, but ALL of the political stuff in it is so utterly illogical, and so rooted in racist fantasy that most of it fails to be funny. Because, as I said numerous times, satire and parody are funny only if they are rooted in reality. If they are based on a fictionalized version of some quasi-reality then the routine makes no sense and has no point to make. Hence not funny, but pointless and random instead.\n\nThen he goes on a rant about Affirmative Action, giving us a Mickey Mouse version of the history of slavery, all sorts of nonsense that liberals use as an excuse to keep the status of blacks as a \"special minority\", even decades after AA was started. (AA will be in place even in 100 years, and they will still be making excuses for it.) He makes a few good jokes, but most of this bit fails because it's rooted in nonsense. When you joke about fantasy you end up with jokes about a non-existent fantasy world, which is bewildering and confusing rather than funny. The crowd, despite being at least 50% black in this venue, was noticeably quieter during these bizarre segments than during the first 15-20 minutes which were quite funny. Evidently, even his hardcore fans were a little confused by these theories.\n\nMake no mistake though, the first 20 and the last 20 minutes of that show are great, it's just all the middle stuff that's quite bad.\n\nHe too like Chapelle seems obsessed with scandal comedy based on racial themes, which is sometimes corny and can become overbearing. When done right racial humour can be great (Russell Peters), but it needs to be balanced AND rooted in reality otherwise it won't work. I am anyway wary of black comedians doing racial humour because they by default have the \"upper hand\" (in America) hence can abuse this unfair advantage as a minority bestowed upon them by Cultural Marxism - which they sometimes do, such as what Chris did in \"Never Scared\". To Rock's credit though, he does lots of balanced racial humour, i.e. isn't afraid to spill the beans on black vices as well, which he does more of in some of his earlier shows, when he was younger, less known hence braver (because less dependent on the left-wing entertainment industry on whose support he relies to stay wealthy - plus it was a much more free era). After all, black audiences enjoy laughing at themselves as all normal people do - something liberals don't seem to understand because they never bothered to get any black friends, or pretend not to comprehend because that wouldn't suit their agenda (which is to \"protect\" black people from those horrible horrible evil white people). Most crowds on his DVD gigs are black, and they absolutely lose their minds laughing whenever he jokes about the foibles of the black culture. They CAN laugh at themselves and they DO enjoy it... all ye liberals ought to know this.\n\nHe may be a bit too PC for me, though, sometimes, though that all depends on the gig. Certainly his Oscars clips hold zero value for me. I don't need to watch them to know he plays it safe with the trickiest issues. The fact that he got to host the Oscars in recent times is a strong indication that he is willing to bend over for his Overlords, which by default means he doesn't mind straying into PC territory - for that extra cash. In recent decades NONE of the other Oscars hosts were non-PC so this sends a clear message about Chris's integrity. He will \"ho\" himself (as he puts it) for money and prestige, something Ricky Gervais wouldn't. Ricky, despite being a liberal just like Chris, willfully provokes the ire of the entire American show-biz industry (which is 95% communist), best exemplified by his Golden Globe appearances as host. Needless to say, Ricky will NEVER be asked to host the Oscars. They prefer the likes of Amy Schumer and Jon Stewart who far more accurately represent what Hollywood stands for now: elitism, privilege, hate, bias, lies, non-talent, political compliance, ethnic preference and nepotism.\n\nYup, integrity. Whereas I can choose to ignore an actor's political stances, because a movie is not his own product and films are a huge team effort - and may not even be a political film at all, stand-up comedy is far more personal: there's literally just one personal in charge, hence this person's political attitudes and personality are of paramount importance, defining the entire tone and attitude of the show. I can completely ignore a singer's political orientation - or even their extreme criminal record - but I can do no such thing for a comic. I have to like and respect a comic as a person (at least to some extent) in order to listen to his routine, and if his integrity is void then there's no respect and no likability... Very simple.\n\nWhat Rock is far better at than political issues (which he doesn't understand) is gender comedy, this he excels at. Only Burr is as good at understanding and relaying male-female relationships as Chris is. These two are the best at it, no question, because both have great instincts about human behaviour and they are brutally honest in exposing the foibles of both genders - especially women whom they understand far better than the average guy (who is by all accounts a totally dumb simp in this regard; guys need to watch Alexander Grace more to learn what it's really all about). I would even go as far as to say that no comic understands the female psyche as well as Chris does. Neither of them are too savvy about political issues but when it comes to day-to-day real human issues they are great. It shows that they are very intelligent, but lack the education to extend that intelligence to the more complex issues that require a lot more reading than merely personal experience which is easily acquired, with less effort.\n\nRock has some great material, but a thing he'd need to fix is his delivery, his style. It's over-the-top black preacher stuff: shouting, repeating SEVERAL TIMES what you just said, making bezoomny faces, the whole lot. The older he gets the more pronounced this over-theatrical delivery becomes. Just like a cliche of a black Southern priest - which unfortunately he does not do ironically. He'd be (much) funnier being more himself (advice I'd give to most comics - except the ey-holes), rather than play up the \"ghetto stereotype\" that is expected from black comics. (God forbid any of them \"act white\" (whatever that means, because not all white ethnicities act or speak the same at all), because then they run the risk of becoming the laughing stock of many in the black community who expect everyone to say YO in every sentence (which, hilariously/ironically, many white people do too, in their lame attempts to sound street-smart). Nowhere is it written how a black American man must speak: they should be able to speak in any way they choose, but are constrained by their own prejudices and deeply ingrained habits of what's acceptable and what's not.) Chris talked normally when he was starting out as a comic. When he was 21 there was none of that theatrical crap in his speaking. Now he jumps around the stage like a preacher begging for donations.\n\nChris does lots of non-PC material, but similarly to Gervais he feels the need to occasionally \"remind\" the crowd that he \"supports\" social justice and all that stuff. Comics should NEVER have to apologize for their material, and if they feel they must do it (i.e. are pressured by their sponsors, corporations, the media and all the other virtue-signaling hypocrites), they should apologize AFTER a gig or tour in interviews, or on their Twitter accounts... Because there is a difference between unconditional courage (which gets my maximum respect) and conditional courage (which doesn't get my full respect). And they should NEVER praise themselves during gigs about how socially aware they are, which Chris did on several DVDs. Nobody (aside from fools) wants to listen to anyone praise themselves - much less a comic doing a routine that's supposed to be FUNNY as opposed to a public test of his morality.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nI'd never heard of him until after I started this list. He is a Canadian born to Anglo-Indian parents (which I assume means both are part-British), yet they immigrated directly from India not from Britain, so already his background is very unusual.\n\nTrue to his bio and very suitably, almost his entire routine (in certain shows not the case) is based on racial humour and cultural observation comedy, which he does in a way that is friendly, non-hateful and non-aggressive hence why he isn't pelted with food at his shows. He gives off somewhat A-holish vibes, in fact I suspect he might be unlikable in private, but his routine is entertaining and chill. Unlike some other \"race comics\" he creates a friendly environment, not a lynching mob mood with racist overtones. A lot of his ethnic imitations are very funny, especially when he does his fellow Indians, or the Chinese. Not often hilarious, but different from other comics, because he relies more on improvisation than most. He involves himself in even more banter with the crowd than Jimmy Carr, and that's saying something. You need to have balls to stray so often from your material by talking to the audience, especially at large venues filmed for a DVD. Or you need to have low criteria, however you wanna interpret it...\n\nThe great thing about his routine is that he makes it very international, poking fun at foibles from nations that NEVER get discussed by other comics, such as the Lebanese or Filipinos for example. He doesn't bore us by doing the umpteenth impression of a Texan hillbilly or an angry Scotsman, instead he does impressions of Saudis, the Chinese, the Poles, which is much more original hence more interesting. After all, the world doesn't only consist of North American culture, there are numerous other regions to explore, analyze and mock too...\n\nIt does help that he'd apparently traveled a lot which gives him first-hand insights or at least impressions, unlike typical UK and US comics for whom America and the UK are the entire world. Chris Rock, for example, once said (in earnest) that \"everybody hates America because our god is money\" - which is a very idiotic thing to say as the entire world revolves around money, and always did, always will. Nor does \"everyone\" hate Americans, that is also baloney that he was taught by Chomsky and the like. But Chris had probably rarely ventured outside the States or read anything substantial about the rest of the world to know this... Which is why comics unfamiliar with history and other cultures should stay away from overly political comedy: they usually embarrass themselves by revealing their ignorance and their overly US-centric attitudes.\n\nStill, despite his travels he sometimes makes gaffs such as referring to \"the English accent\", as if there was just one. Of course, he meant the BBC English, the Queen's English, but being Indian and an accent impersonator he ought to know that English accent come in a wide variety. It's possible that he does know this but chose to simplify the truth jut to get a joke out of it.\n\nWhen he strays away from racial humour he sometimes does well, but sometimes goes overboard, such as his sexual humour which gets cringy at times.\n\nHe is the ONLY comedian who stated a very obvious truth about white Americans, paraphrasing: \"I feel sorry for the white people, they'd been made to believe that they are the biggest racists - when in fact Orientals and Indians, us Asians are the biggest racists by far.\"\n\nIt takes balls to say that, though I suspect he wouldn't say it NOW, not in this decade...\n\nHe also once mocked American whites for being so afraid of being accused of racism that they even pretend not to notice when a person is black. He did this in one show and it was very clever. He is practically the only comedian who clearly named the elephant in the room, by discussing how cornered white westerners have become in terms of this type of \"reverse-racist bullying\". If anyone was going to do it, certainly it wouldn't be a white comedian because he'd be afraid (ironically) of being labeled racist, and it wouldn't be a black comedian because they hardly ever give white people slack, so I suppose it makes sense that it took an Indian comedian to openly talk about this. And I'm pretty sure the Overlords weren't too happy that he did this... because white Americans aren't \"supposed\" to find out, i.e. not supposed to realize how they'd been blackmailed and cornered by their own liberal insanity.\n\nAnd because he goes in detail about various races/ethnicities/cultures, you also get to learn something, which is extremely rare to get from a stand-up routine. There is never a sense that he is trying to pit the races against each other. Rather, he uses racial and cultural differences to make everyone laugh at each other - and at themselves - in a way that is non-toxic and amiable. I suppose certain black comedians (and a few white ones) could take notes from this. But then again, why would they? Controversy sells better, and extremism and bias pay off more. Though only the Left type of extremism.\n\nHis imitations are very good, sometimes top-notch, both of \"stereotypes\" and random individuals. He does a variety of accents really well.\n\nAs I said, 95% of his stuff is racial/cultural, but one of his funniest bits is the breakdance story. His bit about the need to hit one's children is great too: very un-PC, brave, funny.\n\nI prefer Russell's earlier stuff, from the 00s, for example \"Outsourced\". But you can pick almost any show. \"Notorious\" is weaker though, pick that only if you liked all the others."
