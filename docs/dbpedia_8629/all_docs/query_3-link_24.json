This year the Guv is all about legacy - he wants a tour to show that yes, we can all make a difference, go the distance.\n\nTackling the Euro, Why Kids Don't Know The Meaning Of Hard Work, Saying The Unsayable, Scots' Independence and the Delicate Balance of Supply and Demand, the Guv's tour will reboot you as parents, sort you out as kids, set you free as citizens.\n\nAmbitious? Yes. Epic? Certainly. This is the TV edit of a live DVD, recorded during his 2012 The Only Way Is Epic Tour."
