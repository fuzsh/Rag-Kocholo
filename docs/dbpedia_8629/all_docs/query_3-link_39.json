        "text": "There are two comedians preaching revolution at the moment – and not just Russell Brand. In character as the Pub Landlord, Al Murray tells us he's here to help turn around ailing Britain. Let's build pyramids around the M25 to entomb reality TV stars; let's lower our children's ambitions, and let's cut loose the Scots. The Landlord offers these up as radical solutions to the nation's woes, but they're not remotely unexpected from a character who has been peddling uber-traditional (though he would deplore the prefix) little English-isms for nigh on 20 years.\n\nUnlike Alan Partridge, for example, Murray's Landlord alter ego isn't developing with age. We find out no more about him; his prejudices and passions remain the same (he calls Ukip \"those leftie bastards\"). And for much of this touring show, that's fine. In a spoof on boorishness by one who sometimes seems boorish himself, the Landlord is lighter on his feet tonight. Much of the first half is composed of gleefully insensitive audience abuse. But Murray's a master at it: his wit is quick, his verbal violence is equal-opportunity, and his own loudmouth tactlessness is the real butt of the joke.\n\nThe scripted material isn't as impressive. His act one closer about parental discipline tests the patience for little return; a section soliciting euphemisms for vagina is hard to love; and his physical comedy business with a fold-up tent is funny enough without the phallic tomfoolery. But elsewhere, a routine about vajazzling has sparkle (the Landlord opposes it, with reference to the laws of supply and demand), and an anti-Scottish tirade (marvelling that the whisky industry has \"persuaded the world that it's a luxury to lick disinfected wooden floor\") is enjoyably OTT. There's no revolution here. But, gurning like Les Dawson and sloshing lager across the Wetherspoons-style upholstery, Murray's latest cheerfully kills time until we get there."
