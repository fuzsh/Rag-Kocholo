        "text": "Contributed by Jonny Collins\n\nI’ve told you what music is good, I’ve told you which video game characters are trans, and I’ve revealed which comedians are responsible for my continued pursuit into this fruitless endeavour. And I wouldn’t be a stand-up comedian if I didn’t get writers block after 3 short articles, so rather than explore a different topic, I’m going to tell you all which 8 stand-up specials I would choose to keep if I could only watch 8 for the rest of time.\n\nLike Desert Island Discs, except instead of contextualized by being stranded on a desert island with 8 singles and the means to play them, in this hypothetical scenario, we’ve achieved our goal of cancelling all comedy and comedians – but I want to smuggle a handful of them to hypocritically enjoy whilst decrying anyone who still does comedy or finds it enjoyable in the post-apocalyptic year of 2025.\n\nWhatever, the context doesn’t matter – here are the 8 stand-up specials I would pick:\n\nLeopardoptera – James Ross\n\nI’m trying to avoid the really obvious hard hitters for this list – not the big Netflix specials, not the iconic DVDS from the country’s biggest names. Nah I want to make sure the more DIY specials are represented on here, and I can’t talk about DIY stand-up specials without shining a light on the incredible Leopardoptera by James Ross (and not just because I went to see this being recorded).\n\nI first saw James Ross perform in 2015 and was immediately charmed by his surreal sense of humour, sharp delivery, and aggressively inclusive attitude, which has been a huge source of inspiration for my act since then.\n\nHis hour show is a masterclass, demonstrating how to warm an audience up by compering for yourself, working anecdotes into coherent pieces of stand-up, using props and visual aids to enhance ideas, committing to an idea well past the point of it no longer being funny, and right back around to it being hysterical again, deconstructing the very nature of stand-up and comedy tropes, and even doing observational ideas in a unique way that stops them from feeling tired and played out in 2022.\n\nLeopardoptera is a beautiful special that many of you won’t have seen, and I urge you to look out for it. You can watch it with a NextUp comedy membership, and you can also buy the download from Gumroad here: https://jamesrosscomedy.gumroad.com/l/Leopardoptera\n\nVive La Revolution – Mark Steel\n\nLittle bit more mainstream, but still, I think worth highlighting. Mark Steel isn’t exactly an underground name, but I’d also wager that he isn’t the first person most people think of when they think of stand-up comedians and specials.\n\nMark Steel is a big lefty history nerd, and you’ve probably stumbled across him a few times, particularly whenever the Tories do something stupid (which is often). In fact, I’m only familiar with a narrow body of his work – but one of his specials “Vive La Revolution” is one of my favourites all time.\n\nMark is a very competent stand-up, and absolutely thrives when he’s writing and performing to a theme. Vive La Revolution, if you hadn’t guessed, is the story of the French Revolution told through the medium of stand-up comedy.\n\nIf you know anything about Blizzard Comedy, you’ll know that proletariat revolution and pretentious stand-up comedy that teaches you things as well as makes you laugh are 100% what we’re about. Whenever I need a break from the capitalist hellscape we’re trapped in, watching this special calms me down, and also reminds me that there are other options apart from being complacent in your oppression.\n\nVive La Revolution is also viewable on NextUp Comedy\n\nCold Hard Cache – The Delightful Sausage\n\nTaking a huge swerve away from Mark Steel here, sometimes a comedy special doesn’t need to be about anything profound to stick with me. Sometimes just an hour of two of the funniest people ever to grace this earth dicking about together, corpsing, and stringing together a very loose narrative in between some of the most quotable skits of the 2010s.\n\nCold Hard Cache isn’t the most ambitious work by Amy Gledhill and Chris Cantrill, but as an hour of pure fun dark nonsense, I don’t think I could survive knowing that it was gone forever. Whether it’s Chris screaming “I AM A FEMINISM” in the middle of an incredible parody of anti-woke white men, Amy and Chris enacting the history of the internet with skits that put League of Gentlemen to shame, or Chris’ “Kony 2012” tattoo reveal at the end, that only gets funnier and funnier every year further we get from 2012.\n\nCold Hard Cache won’t change your life or test your perspective on a tricky issue, but it will have you absolutely pissing your ass off laughing rolling laughing floor out loud. And in the words of the sausage themselves, “both are fine”.\n\nTheir last special “Ginster’s Paradise” is also worth an honourable mention – and is technically a more polished show, retaining the chaotic humour that define cold hard cache in a deeper narrative. But in terms of pure quotability, Cold Hard Cache just edges it for me. They’re recording a new special soon too, Nowt But Sea. When I go see that, I may change my mind – but this spot is reserved for the sausage.\n\nOnce again, watch this on NextUp Comedy\n\nAll My Heroes are Dead, In Jail, or Touched Up Your Nan – Raul Kohli\n\nThis is probably the deepest cut on this list and is also free to watch on Raul’s YouTube channel.\n\nRaul is possibly my favourite comedian of our generation.\n\nHe expertly treads the line between genuinely insightful and nuanced political commentary, and incredibly accessible, well written jokes that can appeal to audiences across political spectrums – to make a package that might not answer the difficult questions of division in society in the 2010s but provides a look through a unique voice from a non-white man on a topic which quite frankly even well meaning white people often talk over.\n\nAn absolute must watch from one of the greatest comics of this generation.\n\nVisit his YouTube channel to watch.\n\nGlorious – Eddie Izzard\n\nGoing from an underground DIY artist to one of the biggest comedians this country has produced – any of her specials could go on this list. In fact, I could include all of them here and I’d still have to pick one to get rid of.\n\nIn the end I opted for Glorious. I really think everything from Definite Article to Dress to Kill is perfection – and Glorious was right in the middle of that range.\n\nDress to Kill probably has the individual better skits, but as a show I really like the way Glorious loosely formats itself through the Bible – starting with Genesis, ending at Revelation – not strictly covering all biblical stories, and going on a lot of unrelated tangents throughout – but has a thematic cohesion that just gives Glorious that extra bit of satisfaction to sit through. It might not have Cake or Death, but it’s still Izzard at her prime, gloriously silly, one-woman skits about everything from the creation of the universe and trying to use a printer in the 90s.\n\nYou already know she’s great – go watch her stuff more. I don’t think it’s on any streaming, but DVDs are fairly cheap, and there’s probably some streaming services or places you can purchase it, she’s fucking huge, you’ll find it.\n\nImagine That – Rhys Darby\n\nThis is an interesting one – as this is actually the first ever stand-up DVD I ever owned. Before I got into Eddie Izzard, before I even really got into Lee Evans, I asked for this DVD for Christmas one year because I loved Flight of the Conchords.\n\nI don’t think I knew what to expect at the time, but what I got was a lovely hour and some of a nice New Zealand man making sound effects and doing mimes whilst occasionally saying the word fuck in stand-up skits that no other comedian could manage.\n\nI have in my head that this is a family show. It definitely isn’t as there is strong language, but Rhys has such a childlike wonder to his stand-up persona, and with skits like the two knights fighting over bouncy castles, Imagine That is a show for 30-year-olds with the personality of a 6 year old, and it just gives me pure serotonin to watch.\n\nHammerhead – Joseph Morpurgo\n\nLike Cold Hard Cache, this special just cuts through right to my funny bone, and I find myself revisiting this at least once a month.\n\nHammerhead is a one man show contextualized as the post-show Q&A of a one-man interpretation of Frankenstein. It starts off as a fairly bog-standard series of theatre gags, creative use of projectors and staging, but nothing ground-breaking.\n\nBut then out of nowhere it spirals out into a character study of this tortured actor who’s been abandoned by his family, deep in debt for artistic dreams, and stuck in a cycle of failure. The way it’s weaved in alongside the narrative beast of Frankenstein is genius, and without spoiling anything, and the climax of the show pays off about 20 different set up gags throughout the show, it’s honestly like orgasm of laughter after 50 minutes of edging.\n\nYou can watch this on NextUp Comedy, and you should because it’s great.\n\nI’ll be Bec – Bec Hill\n\nBec Hill compered my second ever gig, and is one of the loveliest people you’ll ever have the pleasure to meet – doing accessible comedy with the aid of her flipchart, doing everything from one liners to endearing anecdotes, Bec Hill is just an all-around great comedian, and you’d expect her special to be fantastic.\n\nAnd it is, but in a very different way from what I was expecting.\n\n“I’ll Be Bec” is one of the deepest and existential shows I’ve seen in my entire life. She eases you into the show with silly puns, flip chart doodles and lighthearted jokes, then we are quickly transported to a dystopian reality where Bec has to make a tough choice that could change the very nature of the world and her position in it. Without wanting to spoil too much, this show is profound, reflective, and optimistic, it’s honestly “Inside” levels of incredible. And years before Inside was released.\n\nIt’s on NextUp comedy – and if you watch just one of the shows on this list, make in that one.\n\nSpeaking of Inside, here’s some honourable mentions which didn’t make the list but barely:\n\nOne Man, One Guvnor, Al Murray: This show is a brilliant satire of the global economic system without sacrificing what makes the Pub Landlord character great. It’s not for everyone, but from a purely technical level, it’s one of the most well-crafted sets I’ve ever seen.\n\nGoing Out, Lee Mack: This was the first show I ever saw live, and I was at one of the recordings, and as such I can’t tell if my love for this show is nostalgia, or because it’s generally great. What I will say though is that Lee Mack is one of the sharpest comedy minds going, and all of his specials are great examples of how to craft a stand-up show with pure jokes and keep it fresh and interesting.\n\nDeaf Comedy Fam, Ray Bradshaw: The first show at the Edinburgh fringe performed in both English and BSL, Deaf Comedy Fam is a delightful special about Ray’s experience growing up with Deaf parents, full of anecdotal humour as well as deconstruction of stereotypes associated with Deaf people, and just solid ass jokes.\n\nTinselworm, Bill Bailey: A solid special, but I mostly love it for the best cover of Creep by Radiohead I’ve ever heard at the end using Hindi musicians and elements. Absolutely beautiful\n\nInside, Bo Burnham: I’ve literally just watched this (I know, late to the party). And yeah, it’s as good as everyone says. Maybe more profound watching it whilst still in lockdown, but it is still a show with strong artistic direction, genuinely fantastic music, and some amazing jokes to go along with it\n\nJust A Pinch, David Stanier: The real king of the virtual comedy specials, David Stanier is another comedian who just hits that sweet spot with me that he always makes me laugh. While arguably less profound than Inside, Just a Pinch is surprisingly thematically strong despite the silly gags and skits, talking about how the little irritants that can build up and overwhelm you – it’s just a pinch, but they can build up. Imagine being pinched everywhere on your body at once? Not fun.\n\nPolitics for Bitches, Luisa Omielan: I didn’t include this one because I don’t think I’ll watch it again, but despite that, I will never forget this show. Not only does it contain some really stripped down and to the point political commentary to expose political corruption to audiences who might not be the most literate in politics. It also contains a story about her Mum’s cancer, which I just happened to watch when the same experience was happening to me, and it was cathartic. The ending wasn’t happy in the traditional sense, as cancer rarely is. But it was such a human story, including all the genuinely hilarious things that can happen in this situation – and keeping them funny. The most tragic and difficult things in life all have comedy in them, and Luisa extracted that without downplaying the severity, and this show found me when I needed it most.\n\nThose are my picks – do you agree/disagree? Well, let me know by finding your nearest bus stop, tattooing your opinions on your arm, and flagging down every bus driver and ask if they can pass on the message to me when they next see me. They’ll know where to find me.\n\nThanks for reading."
