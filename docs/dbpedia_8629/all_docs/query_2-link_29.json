        "text": "This week's comedy news\n\nFrankie Boyle is back in the headlines, after accusing UK satirists of being too cosy with the establishment. The comic, a veteran of satirical TV panel show Mock the Week, says that it's \"not a coincidence that you see people we would call satirists at the politician-of-the-year awards.\" Boyle told The Sunday Times, \"if you're outside that loop, then you're not supposed to be doing it and you'll get in trouble. We're actually a society founded on something pretty unpleasant, and we've got to address that. But the minute you start, it's open season on you.\"\n\nAs if to refute Boyle's claims, however, David Frost – yes, the David Frost who's a knight of the realm, husband of Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, father of Eton pupils – has told the Telegraph \"I don't think I've joined the Establishment.\" The broadcaster was talking to the Telegraph on the 50th anniversary of his proto-Mock the Week satire show That Was the Week That Was. Pub landlord-mimicking comic Al Murray may soon have to issue the same denials as Frost: next month, he will be guest-editing the elite's breakfast broadcast of choice, Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nIn the US, a sitcom actor distances himself from the embrace of the mainstream. Two and a Half Men is best known in the UK as the one Charlie Sheen was fired from when he had his drugs blowout early last year. Now it's attracting its second raft of shocking headlines in two years, after its star Angus T Jones – the 19-year-old half-man of the title – launched a hilarious/bizarre attack on the sitcom, from an evangelist Christian perspective. \"Please stop watching it. Please stop filling your head with filth,\" he said this week in a video posted by the Forerunner Christian Church in California. Jones has starred in the show since he was 10 years old, and is paid $350,000 an episode. But that clearly hasn't engendered much loyalty. \"I'm on Two and a Half Men, and I don't want to be on it,\" Jones goes on. \"I don't want to be contributing to the enemy's plan. You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I know I can't. I'm not OK with what I'm learning, what the Bible says and being on that television show.\" Laughing Stock wonders if he'll have to wrestle with the problem for much longer, or whether Warner Brothers might step in once again …\n\nBack in the UK, Hunderby creator Julia Davis has called for more variety in UK TV comedy. In an interview with Metro, Davis criticises telly programmers' habit of seeking to clone successful shows. \"The main thing is to believe writers know what their voices are and if they are left alone they will come through with something,\" says Davis. \"People say the US is more conservative; I think actually it is a bit looser here, but trends change. For example, I don't know that Nighty Night necessarily would be made now.\" Elsewhere, the new generation's Al Murray, Simon (Lee Nelson) Brodkin got himself arrested for pretending to steal his own DVD from HMV on Oxford Street. This was apparently a \"publicity stunt gone wrong\", although – given the coverage it's received – the stunt seems to have gone fairly well to us. After last week's report of US comic Katt Williams' chaotic appearance at an Oakland comedy club], fans who attended the gig have now united to sue the standup for \"non-performance\". Meanwhile, comedian Brian Conley has been discussing his flight from ITV show I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here after being diagnosed with malnutrition and exhaustion. Apparently, Conley stopped taking anti-depressants while in the jungle, despite having been on the medication for 15 years.\n\nIn other news, lineups have been announced for the 20th Leicester comedy festival and for the London comedy film festival in January. On telly, we hear that Peter Kay is working on a spoof version of Channel 4's The Secret Millionaire; and that BBC3 has commissioned a new sitcom, Way to Go, about assisted suicide. BBC4 has announced its winter comedy lineup, which includes Brian (Hannibal Lecter) Cox as Dundonian hoax emailer Bob Servant, and a comic dramatisation of the exile of PG Wodehouse. Red Dwarf star Robert Llewellyn will star in Britain's first ever Kickstarter-funded (audio) sitcom, A Brief History of Time Travel ; and a Simpson's script submitted by a young Judd Apatow is to be made, 20 years after it was written.\n\nAnd if you want to see what Morecambe and Wise would look like if they were reconstructed entirely out of foodstuffs (and who doesn't), now's your chance…\n\nThe best of the week's Guardian comedy coverage\n\nTo mark the return to our screens of well-loved C4 sitcom Peep Show, its writer Sam Bain selects his funniest moments from the first seven series.\n\nTV schedulers have programmed Peep Show against BBC3's rom-com Him and Her. TV reviewer Sam Wollaston adjudicates.\n\n\"Undoubtedly the funniest and most original British sketch comedy since Big Train and The Armando Iannucci Shows\", says Paul Whitelaw. So why is Limmy's Show! not broadcast beyond Scotland's borders?\n\n\"Radical, profound, a masterpiece\"; Deborah Orr outs herself as quite a fan of the NHS sitcom Getting On.\n\nRihanna's former partner, the domestic abuser Chris Brown, taken down on Twitter by a comedy writer, name of Jenny Johnson. Tributes paid here.\n\nControversy of the week\n\nA controversy according to the classic formula this week, whereby the curtain-twitching branch of the UK media makes a fuss about something hardly anyone has seen, and drums up lots of welcome publicity for the \"offensive\" show they were purporting to condemn. \"Is this the sickest cartoon ever?\", howled the Daily Mail, as Channel 4's Full English featured an animated cat-fight between the ghosts of Jade Goody and Princess Di. In the series, co-created by Alex (son of Gerald) Scarfe, the pair were attempting to strangle one another in an argument over which one was the real \"people's princess\".\n\nOfcom is reported to have received \"several\" complaints about the show, which it is currently assessing. Channel 4 describes the cartoon show as \"unashamedly rude and silly\", which pretty much sums up the type of gag cracked in the Di and Goody sequence. \"Sorry I'm late, everyone,\" Diana introduces herself: \"had some car trouble, the traffic was absolute murder.\" Diana is later dubbed a \"bulimic slut\" by Jade; Jade gets called \"baldy\" by the cartoon Di. This material left viewers \"incensed\", reports the Mail, which then struggles to justify the claim by quoting mild tweets like the following: \"'I do not really like this Full English show. It is not Family Guy and it just did a cancer gag on Jade Goody. It wasn't in good taste\". Cue outrage as outrage fails to be as outrageous as billed!\n\nNot everyone approved of Sam Wollaston pitching BBC3's Him and Her and C4's Peep Show against one another in his TV review this Monday. Even fewer endorsed his conclusion that the Beeb's sitcom was superior. One of the few was greygran, who thought that:\n\nHim and Her has terrific supporting characters, all gruesome and believable, while amid the mess, our romantic pair live out their mundane lives placidly and nobly. If viewers can't see bits of themselves reflected in this masterpiece they must be having a laugh. The Peep Show [sic] is good but not ground-breaking\n\nBut Simone Rogers spoke for the majority when she begged:\n\nPlease don't do this. I am 32, and Peep Show speaks for a generation like myself. Who hasn't met someone like Super Hans, Jeremy or Mark somewhere along the line? I remember free parties, terrible come downs and hangovers, agonizingly tedious office jobs, etc. I find that no other comedy show reflects the fears and desires of being a 30-something who fears they will never fulfil their potential. It is the stuff that Pulp lyrics are made of, Thatcher's children, who somehow missed out on the opportunities and wealth so available to the previous generation X-ers. I watched Him and Her once and after five minutes switched off in disgust, all that had happened was an infantile conversation about farts and burps. Living with two children, I can get this for free. Peep Show presumes its viewers are more interesting and intelligent than [anything on] BBC3.\n\nMeanwhile, after Deborah Orr's paean to the BBC sitcom Getting On, readers contributed praise upon fulsome praise of their own, of which barkingbroom's comment is a typical example:\n\nThere is more love, compassion, pathos and empathy flowing out of that half-hour show than some people will experience in a lifetime. It is just not where we expect to find it and that is what makes it so brilliant.\n\nOthers tried to explain the show's relatively modest viewing figures – including skepticaemia, who echoed many in arguing that Getting On is too true for comfort:\n\n[It's] difficult for this show to find an audience – a comedy about disease, dying, and how people cope or don't cope with it. The problem is that, for people who have spent time in a terminal geriatric ward, the subject matter could be too raw. Those who have not yet experienced it, are probably not going to really get it. [It's] proper observational comedy of something most of us would rather not observe."
