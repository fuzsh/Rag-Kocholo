He is also one of the few stand-up comedians to be asked by ITV to perform two Audience With's.... Al’s sitcom Time Gentlemen Please (Sky One) has become something of a modern day cult classic and his series, Al Murray’s Multiple Personality Disorder (ITV1) saw him introduce a whole host of new characters and demonstrate his vast comedic range.\n\nAl’s other TV appearances as The Pub Landlord includes three appearances on The Royal Variety Performance (ITV1), hosting both Live At The Apollo(BBC1) and Edinburgh and Beyond (Paramount Comedy Channel) and his edgy quiz show Fact Hunt (ITV1).

He won the Perrier Award (after a record four successive nominations) and secured Olivier Award nominations for both of his celebrated sell-out West End runs. Internationally, Al has forged an enviable reputation with numerous sell-out runs in Melbourne, Sydney, Montreal and New Zealand.\n\nHis Pub Landlord's Book Of British Common Sense, was a best selling title when published in both paperback and hardback with 300,000 sales.
