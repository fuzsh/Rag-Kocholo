        "text": "Never mind the dystopian-feeling venue, says Mark Brown – an evening with Bill Bailey remains a joyfully silly treat\n\nSo, it’s come to this. Thanks to Covid-19, attending a comedy show now involves a logistical operation akin to that of the Berlin Airlift.\n\nIn order to see Bill Bailey perform at the Virgin Money Unity Arena in Newcastle’s Gosforth Park (billed as “The UK’s first dedicated socially distanced music venue”), you must arrive by car or taxi (strictly no pedestrians), and do so within a given 20-minute arrival slot. Once at what is also the home of Newcastle Racecourse, you must don a face covering while walking around, as well as observing the show entirely from within the confines of the sort of numbered pen in which you might expect to find livestock on auction day.\n\nBy the time you unfold your (no doubt carefully disinfected) plastic seat and contemplate the possibility that this might be the dystopian future of entertainment, you’re certainly in need of light relief. Thankfully, you’re in the right place, as Bailey remains one of the funniest, most brilliantly original comedians in the UK.\n\nWe know him for his fabulously creative combination of music and offbeat observational humour (who can forget his imagining of Kraftwerk playing the Hokey Cokey?), but Bailey isn’t averse to a bit of political comedy, and has both Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab in his sights. He doesn’t despair of British politics entirely, however. “At least”, he says, “we’re not America”.\n\nThe socially distanced field in which Bailey is performing (to call it an “arena” is stretching the term somewhat) has been designated as a music venue, and the stage for his show looks very much like a large rock band’s. A talented and versatile musician, he has with him an array of instruments, ranging from an electric guitar to the delightful percussion instrument known as a handpan.\n\nThis is the Bath-born comedian’s first show in six months, and the material is classic Bailey. The musical and poetic humour (a doctor’s bad news songs, an anti-racist limerick) are as inventive and eclectic as ever. His more discursive jokes (including a tale about an incident involving a Dubai Airport customs officer, by way of numerous, hilarious, rambling asides) are executed with the seemingly spontaneous delivery of a West Country Billy Connolly.\n\nThere are high-brow gags, such as the origins of a vulgar hand gesture in Aristophanes’s play The Clouds, and the Twitter account of Samuel Peeps. There are also panto-style gags, such as Bailey leading the audience in a speeded up rendition of California Dreaming by The Mamas and the Papas.\n\nIndeed, in a similar vein to Eddie Izzard (who famously performed in France entirely in French), Bailey offers an impressive, amusingly truncated rendering of his set in German. This is, perhaps, topped only by his side-splitting skit about conducting his home life entirely via heavy metal.\n\nThe pandemic may have turned the world upside down, but Bill Bailey is as reassuringly clever, creative and joyfully silly as ever.\n\nEuropean tour dates: billbailey.co.uk\n\nThis review was originally published on the website of the Daily Telegraph on September 2, 2020\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/what-to-see/bill-bailey-review-virgin-money-unity-arena-newcastle-still/\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nTheatre & comedy\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nTron Theatre, Glasgow\n\nTouring until March 8\n\nMark Thomas: 50 Things About Us\n\nTron Theatre, Glasgow\n\nTouring until May 1\n\nBy MARK BROWN\n\nScotland’s small, but accomplished, children’s theatre sector has a fine track record of creating imaginative productions that thrill and fascinate their young audiences. Few companies have contributed more in this regard than Red Bridge Arts (producer of such brilliant shows as Stick By Me, Space Ape, Night Light and Black Beauty).\n\nThe North Queensferry-based company would appear to have another hit on its hands with Rosalind Sydney’s new adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s much loved story of The Secret Garden. The play is, in some ways, a decidedly modern take on Hodgson Burnett’s tale of an orphan girl from colonial India who is sent to England to live in the grand house of her rich, reclusive uncle.\n\nFor a start, the little girl, Mary (who is played splendidly by Itxaso Moreno), has been orphaned, not by a cholera epidemic, but by a war. When she arrives in the palatial abode of Mr Craven, she is not only far from home, but also unable to speak English (she comforts herself by singing a folk song in the Basque language, which is Moreno’s mother tongue).\n\nLonely and afraid, Moreno’s Mary faces the redoubtable housekeeper Mrs Medlock (Gavin Jon Wright) and the well-intentioned housemaid Martha (Sarah Miele) with a wonderfully comic truculence. The actor imbues her character with such boldness, in both personality and physicality, that she creates an almost instant rapport with the young audience. That identification is palpably constant throughout Mary’s journey from bereaved sullenness to the joys of friendship and discovery in the late Mrs Craven’s beautiful garden.\n\nPlayed by a cast of just three, necessity (as so often in Scottish theatre) proves to be the mother of invention as actors gender shift between roles. Wright doubles up as Martha’s intrepid, younger brother Dickon, and Miele plays Mr Craven’s sickly, and comically paranoid, son Colin.\n\nThe Secret Garden is a story well-suited to our anxious times, directed, as it is, towards human solidarity in the face of fear and loss. This strong staging of it enjoys tight co-direction by Sydney and Ian Cameron, smart, semi-minimalist design by Karen Tennant, excellent, atmospheric sound and music by Danny Krass, and delightfully exuberant movement direction by Robbie Synge.\n\nFor those of us (in Scotland, a clear majority) who are still reeling from the victory of Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson in December’s general election, Mark Thomas’s latest show, 50 Things About Us, promised to be something of an antidote. The Prime Minister – who equates Muslim women wearing the niqab with “letterboxes” and calls gay men “tank-topped bum boys” – is, the self-proclaimed “ex-anarchist” comedian and activist proclaims, like an “alcoholic Hugh Grant in a fat suit”.\n\nThe “us” in the title of the show (which plays Dundee and Stirling next month) are the peoples of the UK. The “50 things” are those aspects of the state and the folk who live in it which Thomas loves and hates.\n\nOne of the things he hates, as he made clear first off in Glasgow, is English nationalism. If or when the people of Scotland vote for independence, it will, Thomas thinks, be like we’re finally leaving an abusive relationship.\n\nOther targets include Tory barrow boy MP Mark Francois (an “EDL Care Bear”) and land use in the UK (six per cent is given over to grouse moors, he says, which is more than for domestic dwellings). The things he loves include the Daily Mail-confounding fact that the London Bridge attacker was stopped by someone armed with a narwhal tusk and a prisoner on day release.\n\nTypically of Thomas’s stage shows, there is an impressive amount of research and a prodigious memory behind what almost seems like a stream of consciousness. Typically, there’s also time for some asides.\n\nHe loves the Glasgow Film Theatre, but hated the movie he watched there (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, starring Tom Hanks, is “so saccharine it’s got diabetes”). He’s also not a fan of theatregoers lighting up the auditorium with their mobile phones during the performance (“Tory behaviour”), and, un-Britishly, challenged a patron who was doing so.\n\nWe have become accustomed to Thomas’s stage works (such as Showtime from the Frontline and 100 Acts of Minor Dissent) having conceptual, theatrical and technical elements that distinguish them from stand-up comedy. In truth, 50 Things About Us, in which the comic speaks with only the occasional aid of a tablet computer, is much closer to a comedy club routine (and it’s none the worse for that).\n\nAs ever, Thomas’s intelligence, mischief and anger are a winning combination. If only he could be granted his wish to become director of the British Museum, whereby he’d return its imperial plunder and open not one, but two rooms dedicated to the late Ian Dury.\n\nFor tour details for The Secret Garden, visit: redbridgearts.co.uk\n\nFor tour details for Mark Thomas, visit: markthomasinfo.co.uk\n\nThese reviews were originally published in The Herald on Sunday and the Sunday National on February 16, 2020\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nTHEATRE\n\nSHOWTIME FROM THE FRONTLINE\n\nTRAVERSE THEATRE, EDINBURGH\n\nReviewed by Mark Brown\n\nHave you heard the one about the left-wing, English comedian who went to a refugee camp in the Palestinian Occupied Territories and set up a comedy club? Mark Thomas, Faisal Abualheja and Alaa Shehada have.\n\nShowtime From The Frontline, the trio’s new UK touring production, is a spin-off from a comedy class and club night Thomas organised in the Freedom Theatre in the West Bank city of Jenin. Abualheja and Shehada (actors with the Freedom Theatre) were among Thomas’s students.\n\nAnyone expecting the show to be a piece of megaphone theatre that simply denounces the Israeli Occupation for two hours hasn’t kept up with Thomas’s work over the last 12 years. From his anti-arms trade piece As Used on the Famous Nelson Mandela (2006) to Bravo Figaro (2012), in which he explored his late, conservative bricklayer father’s love of opera, the south London comic has received richly-deserved plaudits for his unique line in multimedia theatre shows which combine satirical comedy, storytelling and activism.\n\nSo it is with this piece. Due respect is paid to Juliano Mer Khamis, the remarkable Israeli Jewish-Palestinian founder of the Freedom Theatre, who was murdered outside his playhouse by an unknown assassin in 2011.\n\nThereafter, Thomas, Abualheja and Shehada tell the story of how they created a comedy club in Jenin. The Palestinian actors play the roles of the various students, female and male, as well as those of the disapproving worthies who make up the Freedom Theatre’s board of directors.\n\nThe results are very insightful and extremely funny. Some of the aspiring stand-ups avoid the subject of the Occupation. One hijab-wearing, young Muslim woman does a very humorous skit about her attraction to a Korean K-pop star.\n\nAbualheja’s own routine does broach the Occupation, but from an hilarious angle. The district where he lives is at the entrance to the Jenin camp, he tells us.\n\nAlways the first to be affected by Israeli Army incursions and curfews, it is known as the “pregnancy district”. The curfews and electricity switch-offs force the people of his district to make their own “entertainment”, he explains. Israeli demographers are still mystified by the recent spike in the birth rate.\n\nCombining performance with film of the club night in Jenin itself, this thought-provoking, engaging and extremely funny show breaks down common stereotypes and preconceptions about Palestinians one joke at a time.\n\nTouring until April 21: markthomasinfo.co.uk\n\nThis review was originally published on the website of the Daily Telegraph on February 15, 2018\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/comedy/what-to-see/hilarious-engaging-tale-comedy-club-jenin-showtime-frontline/\n\n©Mark Brown\n\nJonathan Pie: Live\n\nPleasance Courtyard\n\nUntil August 28\n\nReviewed by Mark Brown\n\nThe warning that Jonathan Pie: Live “may contain some f***ing strong language” is accurate but inadequate. The one-man show should also carry an alert that Tom Walker, creator and performer of the parody TV news journalist, might have a bloody aneurysm in front of your very eyes.\n\nOr, to put it another way, fans of Pie’s three-minute TV skits will be pleased to learn that he makes the step-up to a 60-minute live show with his apoplectic political rage entirely intact.\n\nWalker is arguably the UK’s sharpest political satirist since John Oliver. His alter-ego, the left-wing reporter Jonathan Pie, combines the brilliant characterisation of Al Murray the Pub Landlord with the radical anger of Mark Thomas.\n\nPie made his name courtesy of the Russian state’s mischief-making global TV channel RT and, more significantly, youtube. The smart conceit of the live show is that he’s now working for the BBC, having been drafted in as a last-minute replacement for John Barrowman as the anchor of Children in Need.\n\nPresenting Ainsley Harriott in a 12-hour Macarena in Swansea is enough to get the veins on Pie’s neck twitching. But that’s as nothing compared to his off-camera observations about Theresa May (“Margaret Thatcher’s re-animated corpse”) or new Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond’s £8.5 million personal fortune.\n\nThere’s a fine line in Pie’s comedy between entertainment and well-researched editorialising. Serious points are well-made about a range of subjects, from TTIP to the worrying rise of a censorial brand of easily offended political correctness.\n\nHowever, just when you’re beginning to worry that the show is getting more like a Jeremy Corbyn rally than an Edinburgh Fringe comedy gig, Pie pulls it back round to a hilariously graphic assault on a Tory politician or a decidedly un-PC rant about his ex-wife.\n\nThis review was originally published in the Sunday Herald on August 14, 2016\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nGlasgow International Comedy Festival\n\nLibby McArthur: The F-Word\n\nVespbar\n\nReviewed by Mark Brown\n\nForget funny on Festival Friday. Instead, the opening night of the Glasgow International Comedy Festival offered River City star LibbyMcArthur’s execrable alliterative monologue The F-Word; which alights upon a series of matters relating to life for women in “the F-zone”, i.e. one’s forties and fifties.\n\nImagine, if you will, a character from Tony Roper’s nostalgia fest The Steamie, crossed with Maw Broon (matriarch of our other national comic strip, The Broons) who is compelled by some demonic swine to speak almost entirely in words beginning with the letter ‘f’ or, occasionally, the sufficiently similar ‘ph’ sound, and you have something approximating McArthur’s performance poet alter ego.\n\nWith subjects ranging (and I use that word loosely) from advice your mother gave you, to that ever-reliable publication The People’s Friend, how much simpler life was in the Seventies, and the affrontery of young women today in their short skirts and high heels, it isn’t difficult to see why McArthur froze, having forgotten her lines, about seven minutes in (I assumed, like me, she’d simply become too bored to continue).\n\nBut wait! Could there be something more sophisticated, more postmodern and cynical going on? In this referendum year, when the people of Scotland are evaluating the place of their culture in the 21st-century, could McArthur – who is as couthie as the kailyard – be the tartan-trimmed secret weapon of the Better Together campaign? If there’s anything guaranteed to sap Scotland of its cultural self-confidence it’s this parochial tosh, which is farcical, flaccid and philistine.\n\nThis review was originally published in the Sunday Herald on March 16, 2013\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nGlasgow International Comedy Festival\n\nCarl Donnelly\n\nThe Stand\n\nReviewed by Mark Brown\n\nIf it takes a bit of bottle to be a warm-up act for a big name comedian, how much more courage is required to turn up at The Stand on Thursday night as the warm-up for an entire festival? Respect is due, therefore, to Carl Donnelly who made his way into the festival programme as an appetiser.\n\nThe point has been made many times before that a good comedian is, in essence, just an excellent liar. Donnelly – who is, if he is to be believed, 32 years old and recently divorced – is such a good liar he should be on the BBC TV show Would I Lie To You? (in fact, he might even be good enough to work for the Metropolitan Police, replacing one of its extraordinary liars from the Stephen Lawrence case).\n\nOpening a festival which has its fair share of gag tellers, Donnelly eschews the sharp, guffaw-inducing one-liner in favour of the gently rib-tickling shaggy dog story. And why not?\n\nFrom close encounters with Australian animals, to an inappropriate streaker at a 40th birthday party in Birmingham, and a fabulous fib about a storm-tossed Irish fishing boat, the Anglo-Irishman tells his tales, in their varying levels of believability, with a winning combination of affability, vulnerability and absolute earnestness. Donnelly can certainly be credited with warming up the festival sufficiently; although whether or not one is prepared to believe that he almost died trying to eat a crumpet in a oner is another matter entirely.\n\nThis review was originally published in the Sunday Herald on March 16, 2013\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nComedy\n\nBarry Humphries\n\nSeen at Festival Theatre, Edinburgh;\n\nat King’s Theatre, Glasgow, February 11-15\n\nReviewed by Mark Brown\n\nSir Les Patterson, the comic monster who Barry Humphries installed as Australia’s “cultural attaché”, has reinvented himself as a celebrity chef. In the first half of Humphries’s farewell tour, Sir Les cooks up a typically flatulent storm in a wonderfully cartoonish Australian backyard.\n\nSir Les is as offensive and hilarious as ever as he showers his audience with single-entendres (and the front row with saliva). The prosthetic genitalia, and some of the gags, have been around for many a decade, but this matters not a jot as Humphries, whether playing Sir Les or his sex offender priest brother Father Gerard (a recent creation), exerts an irresistible command over the auditorium.\n\nIt’s a command which is especially impressive when the comedian appears as the ghost of Sandy Stone. There is tremendous skill and bravery in the shift of pace required by this old codger who ruminates quietly, and with real pathos, on loss and love.\n\nThere was a disquieting moment during the Sandy skit on Tuesday night. The old bloke, as old Australian blokes sometimes do, made a politically incorrect observation, specifically about Polish migration, only for a minority of the audience to fill Sandy’s customary pause with dubiously appreciative applause. Now, Humphries may dress to the right politically – as readers of his occasional and witty writings for The Spectator will know, he’s an admirer of the late Lady Thatcher – but I’m doubtful that he intended to provoke a xenophobic ovation.\n\nThe show’s second half is, as one would hope and expect, all about Dame Edna. Arriving fresh from an “exclusive ashram” in India, she inevitably descends into cruel interactions with the audience.\n\nOne woman is seemingly complimented on being dressed for a special occasion, only for Edna to hazard a guess that the occasion might be washing a car, among other quotidian pursuits. Nor does the Dame spare those who are out of her immediate gaze. The people in the gods are, variously, her “little plebies” or her “misies” (short for Les Miserables).\n\nThe entire, two-hour-and-twenty-minute show is carried off with a delightful sure-footedness which is the hallmark of a truly great stage comedian. As Edna disappears in a flurry of gladioli, the great man takes a bow as arguably the finest of his creations, a debonair gent, looking good on his 79 years, wearing a velvet jacket, tipping his fedora to his adoring public. We know him as Barry Humphries.\n\nThis review was originally published in the Sunday Herald on November 10, 2013\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nGLASGOW INTERNATIONAL COMEDY FESTIVAL\n\nAndy Parsons\n\nKing’s Theatre\n\nDaniel Sloss\n\nKing’s Theatre\n\nKatherine Ryan\n\nBlackfriars Basement\n\nSimon Evans\n\nOran Mor\n\nReviewed by Mark Brown\n\nI have to tell you, dear reader, that I have spent the last week laughing continuously and grinning from ear to ear. But enough of St Mirren’s glorious League Cup victory last Sunday, what of the Glasgow International Comedy Festival?\n\nIn an extensive and star-studded programme, the name of Andy Parsons was sure to grab the attention. The Mock The Week star has a talent for topical comedy which seems made for our tempestuous times.\n\nIn his latest show – entitled I’ve Got A Shed – the topical gags come in the second half. The first section of the set (which is made up of very funny, self-deprecating anecdotes and a riff on his hatred of Kendal Mint Cake) is delightfully old school.\n\nIn the second half the political material comes thick and fast. Observing that various commentators have described Boris Johnson as “quintessentially British”, Parsons notes that the Mayor of London was, “born in America, named after a Russian, and looks like a Swedish person who’s eaten another Swedish person.”\n\nParsons once did a tour which was entitled Britain’s Got Idiots. The hecklers at Wednesday night’s show seemed determined to prove him right. The comedian batted away most of the mindless banter with professional aplomb. However, even he was thrown when, having unicycled on stage for his wonderfully daft finale, a bloke in the stalls insisted on continuously shouting his congratulations on Parsons’s circus skills.\n\nIt seems to be an unwritten law of comedy that the younger a comedian is, the more they have to talk about sex. If there are younger comedians than 22-year-old Scot Daniel Sloss, I’m guessing they’re not at the Comedy Festival because they’re too busy recording material for the Playboy Channel.\n\nCourtesy of his youth and a series of successful TV appearances, Sloss has, as his regular support act Kai Humphries is quick to point out, developed a significant following among teenage girls (including, problematically for the Festival, kids under the age of 16). Normally I’m the kind of laissez faire, liberal parent who is routinely denounced in the pages of the Daily Mail, but by the time Humphries had completed his set of sexual vulgarisms, I felt as if I’d been transformed into a Scottish male version of the late Mary Whitehouse.\n\nThe arrival of Sloss – favourite topics, his desire to perform a violent sex act on Lorraine Kelly and a recent visit to an STD clinic – did nothing to assuage my rising sense of discomfort. If this material is suitable for 14-year-old girls, I’m the next Pope.\n\nSloss certainly has the cocky swagger of a young comedian with a successful career ahead of him, even if his material (from fat Americans to moving out of his parents’ house) is somewhat uninspired. Anyway, if he ever did try to have his violently wicked way with Lorraine Kelly, I suspect she would get him in a headlock and take him straight down the nearest cop shop.\n\nWhile Sloss was playing two back-to-back shows at the King’s, Canadian comic Katherine Ryan (who now resides “near Tottenham”) was deserving a bigger venue down in the Blackfriars Basement. More imaginative than Sloss in her sexual material (you will have to find out elsewhere what a “moose knuckle” is), Ryan’s stage persona is a winning combination of wide-eyed, small town Canadian and streetwise North Londoner.\n\nCanada’s icons (from bears to Mounted Police) are crashed together with hilarious effect. Bears, it transpires, eat kids, but not their training shoes or their dogs; leading to trouble for the dogs when the Mounties arrive.\n\nRyan made a big impression with her recent Let’s Dance For Comic Relief impersonation of Nicki Minaj. Little surprise, then, that a considerable proportion of her set is comprised of material about pop culture; including a very funny routine parodying Beyonce’s hip shaking performance at the 2013 Super Bowl.\n\nEven at the very close proximity forced upon her at Blackfriars, Ryan works the crowd with sure-footed confidence; hardly surprising, given that the 29-year-old has more than held her own with comedy’s big boys on TV shows such as Mock The Week and Never Mind The Buzzcocks. If Daniel Sloss is this good seven years from now, he should think himself very lucky indeed.\n\nIt’s a big leap from Beyonce to Ernest Shackleton’s heroic, if ill-fated, Antarctic exploration. It’s the measure of Simon Evans’s distinctiveness that a long section of his set is comprised of tales of an abandoned expedition and a dramatic rescue in the coldest reaches of the southern hemisphere; Evans admires Shackleton for having an upper lip so stiff that he didn’t even allow himself an expletive as his ice-crushed ship sank into the South Atlantic.\n\nEvans has the demeanour of an irascible, old-style English schoolmaster. The hilarious snobbery of his views on football (which he considers a good way of keeping the least evolved members of society away from town centres on Saturday afternoons) is reminiscent of Harry Enfield’s toffs Messrs Grayson and Cholmondley-Warner.\n\nIf the Hove resident comic’s wit is unusually learned, it is also deliciously wicked. Apropos the area of Florida which comprises Disneyworld, amidst other attractions, and is known simply as “The Parks”, Evans observes that America has done for the word “park” what Nazi Germany did for the word “camp”.\n\nThe Glasgow International Comedy Festival continues until March 31.

This, her debut comedy show, certainly gives full vent to her versatile talents. In six comic monologues (performed over an hour), she takes us from a politically embittered guide in a South Wales “mine experience” heritage attraction to a self-loathing pop culture columnist on a broadsheet newspaper.\n\nAs a first attempt at creating her own comedy show, Moulds’ piece is extremely promising. Some of her characterisations have a disquietingly hilarious ring of truth about them. Not least her postmodern academic, who offers a trendy, “new” twist on Christian theology which is no more than a justification for his own wildly inappropriate sexual behaviour.\n\nHowever, for every moment of good writing, there is at least another of weaker, more obvious material. A hapless Australian extreme sports athlete, who, predictably, arses up his attempt to get sponsorship for his base-jumping DVD, is a case in point.\n\nVariety is certainly the spice of Moulds’ show, but, for now, the quality of her material is a little too variable.\n\nShirley And Shirley\n\nUnderbelly, Bristo Square\n\nUntil August 27\n\n**\n\nCharacter comedians Shirley And Shirley are like a cross between The Fast Show and Little Britain. However, as the double act change quickly between one pair of ludicrous caricatures and another, their work lacks the intelligence and the underlying satire which often characterised those TV shows.\n\nThe Shirleys’ procession of absurd characters includes Kate and Pippa Middleton, who are reinvented, preposterously, as warring sisters with African-Caribbean accents. Then there’s the sexually desperate, Italian TV presenters “the Gay Brothers”, who turn – as the Shirleys often do – to a comedy of audience embarrassment, to say nothing of a pair of drunken posh girls, or the Scouser-hating “Mancie Girls” (whose pride in their native Manchester is accompanied by a string of obscenities).\n\nFor sure, Shirley And Shirley are fast and furious; indeed, the format of their show looks suspiciously tailored for TV. Their material may be disappointingly shallow and riddled with single-entendres, but given the show’s focus upon celebrity culture and “reality” TV, they might just find that their brand of comedy finds a niche in some corner of the televisual firmament.\n\nTom Deacon\n\nPleasance Dome\n\nUntil August 26\n\n**\n\nTom Deacon seems like a very nice young man. The kind of guy a twentysomething young woman could safely take home to meet her parents, if only he’d stop talking about masturbating onto biscuits.\n\nDeacon, who also DJs on Radio One, has recently hit the not-very-significant milestone of 26 years of age. This has plunged him into an existential crisis, which has been exacerbated by his girlfriend calling him a “boy man”.\n\nRather than challenge this accusation, he has decided to compound it with a set which is largely about his quest to exorcise the ghosts he acquired when he failed to complete the 1995 English football sticker album, by filling the album for the 2010 World Cup. Add to that his crippling Xbox addiction, and the impression of a shambolic, perpetual undergraduate male is complete.\n\nDeacon has a certain stage charm for sure, and the abundant insignificance of his subject matter is, without a doubt, its very point. However, one can’t help but feel that his, at best mildly amusing, laddish ramblings are evidence of a tiredness in confessional comedy.\n\nThese reviews were originally published in the Sunday Herald on July 5, 2012\n\n© Mark Brown\n\nGlasgow International Comedy Festival\n\nJerry Sadowitz\n\nStand Up For Palestine\n\nStewart Lee\n\nAll shows King’s Theatre, Glasgow\n\nReviews by Mark Brown\n\n“Thanks for coming”, says Jerry Sadowitz at the end of his stand-up show, entitled ‘Comedian, Magician, Psychopath’. “Has the most controversial living Scotsman mellowed?”, I hear you ask. Has he f***!\n\nHis fond farewell comes at the end of a characteristically expletive-charged rant in which Sadowitz expresses his deep-felt hatred of, in no particular order: Aberdonians, Edinburghians, Geordies, the people of Yorkshire, Mancunians, Liverpudlians, Londoners, the Welsh, capitalists, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party, black people, Pakistanis, the Chinese, Americans, Billy Connolly, all TV comedians, scientists, journalists, gay people, women, and men. That is not a comprehensive list, incidentally. The raging misanthropic pessimism of the show (catchphrase, “it’s all f****ed”) also extends to Scots, Jews and, logically enough, himself.\n\nSadowitz (or his on-stage alter-ego, at any rate) has – like a phenomenally bad tempered cross between Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry (“Harry’s not racist, he hates everyone”) and Lenny Bruce – got angrier with age. Being outraged by his indiscriminate verbal nihilism (as, on Friday night, a young woman in the grand circle was by a particularly obnoxious skit extolling the virtues of rape) is about as pointless as asking Craig Whyte for a character reference. As Sadowitz says himself (while explaining his homicidal hatred of Michael McIntrye), “I’ve gone from being offensive to being unacceptable because that c***’s the f***ing reference point.”\n\nSadowitz may bust taboos with all the subtlety of an Israeli invasion of Gaza, but his violently unleashed comedy remains as compelling as a hotel fire.\n\nTalking of Israeli invasions, some of Scottish comedy’s biggest names were out for Monday’s night’s Stand Up For Palestine gig (raising cash for the Palestine Legal Aid Fund). Excellent compere Martin Mor had a nice idea when he got the entire audience to stick up two fingers at him, so that he could photograph it for a future “Welcome to Glasgow” advertising campaign (although a request for us to throw “Sieg Heil” salutes was a bit of an own goal, given the pro-Israel lobby’s insistence that Palestine solidarity is fuelled by anti-Semitism).\n\nFrankie Boyle (who’s pro-Palestinian views have been expressed in characteristically controversial style in the past) offered a typically strong set, with material ranging from the death of Whitney Houston (which has busted his accumulator at the bookies, because she went before Paul Gascoigne) to the “Michael Jackson Children’s Hospital”. There was good material, too, from David Kay (part-nerd, part-Chick Murray), Bruce Morton, Fred Macaulay and, the people’s choice, Gary Tank Commander.\n\nIf, ironically, there was very little politics in the Palestine gig, Stewart Lee (who is like a fusion of Eric Morecambe and Noam Chomsky these days)went some way to making up the deficit with a typically clever set littered with dubiously “factual” quotes, such as the Norwegian fascist mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik’s admiration for the work of Jeremy Clarkson. A highlight of the set came in Lee’s sharply satirical attempt to meet the demands of right-wing commentators who insist that every joke should be “balanced” by similar material about Muslims and Islam.\n\nThere’s good stuff about wanting to be a successful, dead comedian (like “lazy, dead Bill Hicks”). Oh, and, as evinced by a moment in which he runs around the stage like a prat, smiling inanely and playing with his microphone cord, Lee hates Michael McIntrye too.\n\nThese reviews were originally published in the Sunday Herald on March 25, 2012\n\n© Mark Brown"
