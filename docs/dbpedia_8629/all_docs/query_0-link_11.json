        "text": "Two heavyweights of stand-up are in conversation as Ed Byrne interviews Al Murray.\n\nEd tackles Al on a vast array of topics from Thackeray's attitude to the Irish to the thorny issue of offence in comedy via how best to talk to McFly.\n\nEd Byrne is an Irish comedian and actor.\n\nHis celebrated observational routines made him a leading light of the UK stand-up circuit in the mid-90s and he went on to tour internationally, playing festivals and theatres across the world.\n\nAfter an early stand-up foray as a character called 'The Murderer', Al Murray created his famous Pub Landlord character in the mid-90s as part of a touring show with Harry Hill.\n\nThe Pub Landlord went on to tour venues and festivals worldwide before making his own TV chat shows and sitcom.\n\nAl also presents history documentaries and stood against Nigel Farage in the 2015 UK General Election.\n\nChain Reaction is the long running host-less chat show where this week's interviewee becomes next week's interviewer.\n\nProducer: Richard Morris\n\nA BBC Radio Comedy production for BBC Radio 4, first broadcast in February 2016."
