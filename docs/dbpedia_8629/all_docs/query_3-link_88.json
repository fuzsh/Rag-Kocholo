        "text": "guv island\n\nOi Oi then - Look who's back and heading out on a brand new tour for 2022 - it's only The Pub Landlord himself! With a barrel of new barroom banter, the iconic Al Murray is trailing the breadth and width of Britain once more on the Guv Island Tour\n\nOne of the most recognisable comics in the country, Murray has been honing his hilarious alter-ego since 1994's Edinburgh Festival, since then he's had numerous television and tour appearances and the character has even published four books. Don't miss the 'people's man of the people' as he serves up his unique observations on the state of the country and offers a balm in the form of ancient pub wisdom."
