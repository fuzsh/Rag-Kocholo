The style has been described as \"festive abuse\".\n\nThe style can be distinguished from an act based on satire, or political humor. Insult comedy is often used to deflect or silence hecklers even when the rest of the show is not focused around it.\n\nNotable performers[]\n\nPage Template:Div col/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\").\n\nSee also[]\n\nRoast (comedy)\n\nThe dozens\n\nReferences[]"
