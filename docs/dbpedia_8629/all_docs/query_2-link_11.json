        "text": "From Jerry Seinfeld's first UK show in eight years to tiny fringe festivals, our comedy critic picks 10 must-see events for this July and August\n\nThe Tringe\n\nThis comedy festival is the best thing in Tring. As well as TV stars (Romesh Ranganathan, Clive Anderson, Josh Widdicombe), catch rising talent such as deadpan musical duo Flo & Joan, whimsical surrealist Lucy Pearman and acerbic stand-up Sara Barron.\n\nVarious venues, Tring (tringefestival.co.uk), from July 1 to July 20\n\nJames Acaster: Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999\n\nAcaster reinvents himself as a confessional comic in a truly smashing touring show that reveals the story behind his atrocious Great Celebrity Bake Off appearance. Fight for a ticket. Read the full review\n\nCity Hall, Sheffield (jamesacaster.com), July 1 and touring to Dec 5\n\nMilton Jones\n\nDaft one-liners delivered with a thousand-yard stare by the man with the best Hawaian shirts in the business.\n\nKomedia, Brighton (miltonjones.com), July 2 and touring to April 18 2020\n\nBalham Comedy Festival\n\nEd Byrne, Al Murray, Shappi Khorsandi and Omid Djalili are among the acts treading the boards at a stylish 1931 venue which recently reopened after a million-pound refurbishment.\n\nThe Bedford (balhamcomedyfestival.com), London SW12, from July 5 to July 13\n\nARGComFest\n\nLondon’s coolest comedy weekend hosts 48 “Actually Rather Good” one-hour shows. Stand-ups Josie Long, Nish Kumar, Nick Helm and Larry Dean are joined by surrealist John-Luke Roberts, the high-tech but low-brow Mat Ewins and an interactive Midsomer Murders spoof from Adam Riches.\n\nShoreditch Town Hall, London EC1 (argcomfest.com), from July 6 to July 7\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nHey, what’s the deal with observational comedy? Find out from the US mega-star who reinvented it when he makes his first UK stand-up appearance in eight years with four shows in Hammersmith.\n\nEventim Apollo, London W6 (0844 249 1000), from July 12 to July 13\n\nRhod Gilbert: The Book of John\n\nThe Welsh wizard’s comeback show chronicles his petty arguments with a dim driver who ferried him about after a stroke. Includes the funniest rant about frozen prawns you’ll ever hear. Read the full review\n\nWhite Rock Theatre, Hastings (rhodgilbertcomedian.com), July 17 and touring to Dec 13\n\nLeicester Square Theatre, London WC2 (020 7734 2222), July 25-26\n\nEdinburgh Fringe\n\nAt the largest festival on earth, comedy is king. This year has a typical mix of old hands (Hugh Laurie, Craig Ferguson) and new stars such as returning 2018 award-winners Rose Matafeo (see above) and Ciarán Dowd.\n\nVarious venues, Edinburgh (edfringe.com), from Aug 2 to Aug 26\n\nHave you seen any of the comedians on this list perform? What are your own recommendations for stand-up shows and comedy festivals this summer? We want to hear from you in the comments section below."
