        "text": "Post by ashcampbell on\n\nHey all\n\nI know it's very subjective and depends on one's own opinion, but...I think there are some comedians out there who are just so unfunny that it baffles the mind as to how/why they are famous.\n\nSome examples to me are:\n\n1) Katt Williams\n\nI really really REALLY do not understand why anyone would think this guy is funny. He falls back on the usual crutch of racial jokes, and the fact that he tells his unfunny jokes in the most nasal, annoying voice ever just makes it all worse. I don't get it at ALL.\n\n2) Kevin James\n\nI just don't find him funny. *shrugs* Either his stand up, or his TV show. He just doesn't appeal to me.\n\n3) Dave Attel\n\n4) Anyone who's hosted The Man Show\n\n5) Ralphie May\n\nOK, a white comedian who's overweight, and talks like he's black. Oookay.\n\nThere are others, but those are the main ones I don't understand.\n\nAnd I just wanna take a quick second to mention a comedian I find vastly underrated who is one of the funniest people ever on the planet....\n\nDana Gould.\n\nThe man is gut-bustingly hilarious.\n\nAnyhow.\n\n- Matty\n\nPost by Orange on\n\nI usually find Dane Cook damn hilarious, save for Isolated Incident, that IMO sucked.\n\nOne comedian that's not funny to me? Lisa Lampanelli. I've never found this bitch funny, not once and I've tried more than once. If it's one mainstream comic I can't understand the hype about, it's her.\n\nAlso throw me in Bob Saget as well. I can't take the guy who was Danny f***ing Tanner as edgy and dark, I just can't.\n\nPost by Spankymac is sick of the swiss on\n\nJeff Dunham. The man just isn't funny at all. If other people like him, fine, but he's just not even close to funny for me. He's a talented ventriloquist, but that's it.\n\nI'm the same way. I think, as a ventriloquist, he's tremendous, but his comedy's miserable. And kinda racist.\n\nPost by Koda, Master Crunchyroller on\n\nI usually find Dane Cook damn hilarious, save for Isolated Incident, that IMO sucked.\n\nOne comedian that's not funny to me? Lisa Lampanelli. I've never found this bitch funny, not once and I've tried more than once. If it's one mainstream comic I can't understand the hype about, it's her.\n\nAlso throw me in Bob Saget as well. I can't take the guy who was Danny f***ing Tanner as edgy and dark, I just can't.\n\nLisa is hyped because of the supposed shock value of her comedy. Only problem is, if you've seen just ONE Comedy Central Roast that she's in, you've pretty much seen all of her material.\n\nPost by Cranjis McBasketball on\n\nKevin James' stand up isn't bad. Granted, I've only seen one 5 minute set from Just for Laughs.\n\nSince, Doug Stanhope hosted the Man Show, huge disagreement there. Stanhope is the man.\n\nThe rest in the OP, haven't heard that I know of, well, enough to make an informed decision. What I saw of Katt Williams wasn't funny.\n\nPost by Mozenrath on\n\nJeff Dunham. The man just isn't funny at all. If other people like him, fine, but he's just not even close to funny for me. He's a talented ventriloquist, but that's it.\n\nAgreed here. Very dated material, very cliche. Walter is about the only part of his act that is any good, and even that isn't particularly revolutionary."
