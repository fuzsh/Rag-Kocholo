Al Murray is a popular English comedian and TV personality, best known for his alter ego character, The Pub Landlord. He has been listed in The Observer newspaper as one of the 50 Funniest Acts In British Comedy, and as the 16th Greatest Stand-up Comic by Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.

Al first introduced the Pub Landlord character in 1994 during that year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe, in the show Pub Internationale (which also featured Harry Hill). He then appeared as the Pub Landlord in his theatre show My Gaff, My Rules, and was subsequently short-listed for a Laurence Olivier Award in 2002. More recent theatre tours include A Glass Of White Wine For The Lady and Giving It Both Barrels.

On television, Al has applied his unique brand of humour on such series as Al Murray's Happy Hour - which won a British Comedy Award and was nominated for a National Television Award - and Compete For The Meat, in which teams battle it out to win the coveted prize of a frozen chicken!

Al's considerable comedic range is perhaps best demonstrated in his TV show Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder, in which he introduced a whole host of new characters. Al also headlined a 2009 episode of Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow, filmed at the Brighton Dome.

Al has also appeared in character as the central focus of the modern day TV classic Time Gentlemen Please, as well as a number of other television appearances, including the An Audience With... series.

Al reached a new audience with an impressive performance on Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen, as well as a credible Neil Diamond impression on Stars In Their Eyes. He also appears as himself on the panel shows Mock The Week and QI, and presents a number of historical documentaries on Discovery.

Al has written five books, including The Pub Landlord's Book Of British Common Sense, Watching War Films With My Dad and, more recently, Let's Re-Great Britain.
