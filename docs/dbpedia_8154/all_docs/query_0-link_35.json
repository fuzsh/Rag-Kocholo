        "text": "End of proceedings\n\nBaroness Howe withdraws her amendment but suggests she may return to the issue at third reading, which brings an end to the day in the House of Lords\n\nPeers will be back at 11.00 BST on Thursday with a trio of debates on the construction industry, alternatives to university and Malawi, after the peers oral question session.\n\nVideo links for children\n\nCrossbench peer Baroness Howe of Idlicote tables an amendment requiring a remote video link, which allows evidence to be given away from a court room, to be made available for all young witness and victims involved in criminal trials.\n\nA child's evidence can often be crucial in deciding the outcome of a criminal case and where in cases of sexual abuse \"they are often the only witness\" she tells peers.\n\nDespite this NSPCC has found that over half of young victims experience stress symptoms, ranging from \"sleeping and eating problems and depression to bed wetting and self harm\" she says\n\nThe amendments are supported by the NSPCC, Barbados and Victim Support\n\nPassage of a Bill\n\nThe report stage is an opportunity to consider further amendments following committee stage. Consideration of complex bills at report stage can be spread over several days - today is the second of three days of report stage on the Criminal Courts and Justice Bill for example.\n\nIf the Bill is passed at report stage, the legislation moves on to a third reading. This is the final stage in the House of Lords - barring any parliamentary ping pong.\n\nUnlike the House of Commons, amendments can be made at third reading in the House of Lords, provided the issue has not been fully considered and voted on during either committee or report stage.\n\nSecond amendment\n\nTabling a second amendment aimed at protecting children involved in the criminal justice system, the Earl of Listowel sets out his plans to give youths aged over 17 detained in Police custody the right to be held in Local Authority accommodation rather than a police cell.\n\nChildren aged 16 and under already have this right, but the Earl of Listowel argues \"police custody is an unsuitable and detrimental environment\" for any child.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nDay ends in the Commons\n\nHome Office Minister Norman Baker concludes his speech, which brings an end to the day in the House of Commons.\n\nMPs will be back at 09.30 BST on Thursday, and have a variety of business to deal with, including a debate on a backbench call to scrap legislation enacting fixed-term parliaments.\n\nDo stay with us for now though, as the House of Lords begins a debate on Northern Ireland. That'll be followed by further scrutiny of the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill.\n\nGovernment response\n\nNorman Baker, a minister at the Home Office, is responding to the adjournment debate on behalf of the government.\n\nAnother vote\n\nTime for another division on the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, on former Chief Inspector of Prisons Lord Ramsbotham's amendment to prevent \"secure colleges\" from being established until comprehensive rules on their operation - including on the use of force and the treatment of young offenders with mental or physical health needs - have been established.\n\nGovernment defeat\n\nIt's a government defeat, and there was only one vote in it.\n\nLabour inflicts a defeat on the government's plans for \"secure colleges\", as their amendment preventing under 15 year olds from being placed in the colleges is passed by 186 votes to 185.\n\nAmendment proposals\n\nPeers are debating a series of amendments that would, amongst others things:\n\nensure that girls and young women were not detained at the same college as boys or young male offenders,\n\nprevent anyone under the age of 15 from being placed in a secure college, and\n\nensure there are adequate specialist provisions for the mental health and wellbeing needs of young people in secure colleges\n\nMilitary Covenant debate opened to floor\n\nThe front bench speeches have been made, meaning the floor is now open to backbench MPs.\n\nConservative MP Oliver Colvile, who sits on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee and vice-chairs the all party parliamentary group for veterans, is first up.\n\nHe argues that more needs to be done to support veterans with mental health problems, citing examples from the United States.\n\nHe warns that Britain is set for a \"tidal wave\" of mental health issues, which the government \"has to do something about\".\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nLord Ramsbotham's view on colleges\n\nThe government's plans to build a new multi-million pound secure college in Leicestershire is simply a \"cost saving exercise\" based on \"presumed economies of scale\" former Chief Inspector of Prisons Lord Ramsbotham says.\n\nGovernment claims that education, health care and safety are at the heart of the new project are \"salves for our conscience\" he says.\n\nGovernment position on secure colleges\n\nJustice Minister Lord Faulks counters claims that the government's \"secure college\" plans were rushed, telling peers that the government has \"engaged with wide range of stakeholders and experts\" in forming their programme.\n\n\"Throughout the process ministers have written to, and met with, a wide range of stakeholders to keep them appraised of our plans,\" he told the House.\n\nThe designs for the UK's first secure college, set to open in Leicestershire in 2017, had been tested by NHS England, the Department of Education and experts in \"education and custodial provision\", he added.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nGovernment response\n\nDefence Minister Anna Soubry is responding to Jeffrey Donaldson's speech on behalf of the government.\n\nShe explains the principles of the covenant, and says the government has worked hard to \"rebuild\" it, including through improvements to health care, education and housing.\n\nShe cites additional funding for injured personnel to have access to \"the latest world-leading prosthetic limbs\" as a specific example.\n\nSupport for Armed Forces\n\nJeffrey Donaldson calls for changes to the 1998 Northern Ireland Act to ensure greater support for Armed Forces veterans.\n\nHe says officials in Northern Ireland had indicated to him that the legislation had constrained departments in terms of providing adequate support for veterans - and adds that greater clarity over how the covenant should be implemented, is needed.\n\nMr Donaldson - who sits on the Commons Defence Committee - calls on the government to amend the law to give veterans a \"distinct status\" to ensure they receive \"the recognition and provision they deserve\".\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nLabour view on secure colleges\n\nLabour Justice spokesman Lord Beecham begins his wind up speech on Lord Ramsbotham's amendments, which he has put his name to, by quoting a letter to the Telegraph, describing the government's plans to build the UK's first secure college for young criminals in Leicestershire as \"bad for children, bad for justice and bad for the taxpayer\".\n\nHe called the college, which would house hundred of young offenders, the \"largest children's prison in Europe\".\n\nWhat is the Military Covenant?\n\nThe Military Covenant is the nation's duty of care to the Armed Forces. It was enshrined in law in 2011 to ensure nobody in the forces was disadvantaged by their service. David Cameron had pledged that the military would get \"the recognition it deserves\".\n\nWhat's a secure college?\n\nIn January the government revealed its plans to build the first secure college for young criminals in England and Wales.\n\nThe college, set to open in Leicestershire in 2017, would house hundreds of young offenders and double the time they spent in education.\n\nThe college would have a head teacher, or principal, who would be in the core management team alongside an offender manager. It will eventually house up to 320 young offenders aged between 12 and 17-years-old.\n\nLords debate\n\nPeers are debating a series of amendments put down by former Chief Inspector of Prisons Lord Ramsbotham that would stop secure colleges from being established until comprehensive rules on the operation of secure colleges - including the use of force and the treatment of young persons with mental or physical health needs - have been established.\n\nStatement repeated\n\nAccording to the National Audit Office (NAO), one in six foreign offenders living in the UK have absconded. This figure includes 58 dangerous individuals, some of whom have been missing since 2010.\n\nRemovals of foreign offenders from Britain has fallen to 5,097 from a peak of 5,613 in 2008/09, while the number of home office staff working on Foreign National Offender cases has risen from 100 in 2006, to nearly 1000.\n\nBy the end of March 2014, 12,500 FNOs were living in Britain, either in prison or within the community awaiting deportation. The NAO claims that public bodies have spent an estimated £850m on dealing with these criminals.\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nHome Office Minister Lord Bates is repeating a government response given to an urgent question in the House of Commons by Home Secretary Theresa May on a National Audit Office report on the removal of Foreign National Offenders.\n\nImplications for UK as a whole\n\nAnother DUP MP, Sammy Wilson, warns that if Northern Ireland becomes a \"backdoor for serious international crime\", it will have \"huge implications\" for the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nSDLP's argument attacked\n\nRev William McCrea - the DUP's spokesman on justice and home affairs - attacks the \"bankruptcy\" of the SDLP's argument for opposing the NCA, and claims it must have a \"hidden reason\" for not supporting the organisation.\n\nThe South Antrim MP says the limited powers of the NCA in Northern Ireland means \"there is a backdoor open to organised criminal gangs in areas of drug enforcement, human trafficking and serious criminality\".\n\nHe claims the nationalist parties' objection to the NCA centres on it being \"a UK-wide agency\", and accuses them of pursuing a \"crusade to remove and block anything that is British from the Northern Ireland\".\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nInternational pressure\n\nCrossbench peer Lord Alton of Liverpool urges the government to increase pressure on its international partners to do more to combat Ebola, revealing that Swedish furniture manufacturer IKEA has provided more funds to the cause than \"Spain, Luxembourg and Norway\" combined.\n\nInternational Development Minister Baroness Northover reassures peers that the UK is calling on all countries to \"scale up their efforts.\"\n\nOversight concerns\n\nDefending her party's position, Margaret Ritchie, the SDLP MP for South Down, stresses that it supports the \"principle\" of the National Crime Agency, but is concerned about a \"lack of proper oversight mechanisms\".\n\nSinn Feín and the SDLP blocked a move to give the NCA powers to carry out police operations and recruit agents in Northern Ireland.\n\nMs Ritchie says that for negotiations on the NCA to progress, there must be clarification on the issues of accountability and oversight.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\n'Appropriate' powers\n\nOpening a debate on the devolution commission, chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin, Labour peer Lord Foulkes of Cumnock calls on the government to ensure the commission is based on principles, rather than \"party horse trading\", to ensure only \"appropriate\" powers get devolved.\n\nCall for transparency\n\nToday's session in the House of Lords gets underway with Baroness Anelay of St Johns telling peers that the Foreign Office \"stands ready to support\" the Qatari government in its attempts to improve the treatment of migrant workers employed in the gulf state during the construction of World Cup 2022 venues.\n\nBaroness Anelay tells peers the question over whether Qatar should lose its rights to host the World Cup - put to her by Labour peer Lord Monks - is a \"matter for Fifa itself\". She does however believe that \"every sporting authority should be responsible and transparent in its dealings.\"\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nLord Fox\n\nFormer chief executive of the Liberal Democrats, Christopher Fox, becomes Lord Fox as he is introduced in the House of Lords.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nNew peer\n\nBefore that peers welcome another member to the House of Lords: former chief executive of the Liberal Democrats, Christopher Fox. He will join the Liberal Democrat benches in the upper chamber, as Lord Fox.\n\nLords about to begin\n\nOur live coverage of the House of Lords is about to begin. Today's main business is the second day of report stage of the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill.\n\nAs peers scrutinise the wide-ranging bill, a vote may well be forced on the government's Secure College proposals for young offenders, which Labour peers claim will introduce risk and uncertainty.\n\nHealth Committee coverage\n\nYou can continue to watch the remainder of the Health Committee's evidence session here.\n\nUK case\n\nBritish nurse William Pooley, who survived Ebola after being given the experimental drug ZMapp, is the only known UK resident to have caught Ebola in the current outbreak.\n\nMr Pooley, who caught the disease while volunteering in West Africa, returned to Sierra Leone to resume his work on 20 October.\n\nEbola risk in the UK\n\nResponding to a question from Health Committee member Andrew Percy, a Conservative MP, Dame Sally Davies erepeats her comments that, under current modelling, the UK is \"likely to get a few cases [of Ebola] over the next few months\". The number shouldn't reach \"over a handful\", Dame Sally adds.\n\nNo 'safe haven'\n\nDUP MP Nigel Dodds emphasis that \"we cannot afford\" for Northern Ireland to be seen as a \"safe haven\" for criminals and their \"illegal criminal assets\", as he makes the case for the NCA to operate in Northern Ireland.\n\nEbola symptoms\n\nEbola is a viral illness of which the initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding.\n\nThe disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.\n\nIt then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. Funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.\n\nPolicing south Armagh\n\nAndrew Robathan, a former Northern Ireland minister, claims that south Armagh, which has a Sinn Fein MP, is a \"bandit country\" with no \"rule of law\". \"We need to have the NCA in there...to find out what is happening,\" he argues.\n\nNorth Down MP Sylvia Hermon intervenes to state that the \"vast majority of people in south Armagh are actually law-abiding, decent citizens\". Mr Robathan says she is right, and adds that \"decent people who see crooks getting away with things are as appalled as anybody else\".\n\n'Myth busting'\n\nResponding to a question on how the Ebola virus might mutate, Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer, tells the committee she would be \"totally surprised if it became airborne\" , as has been suggested.\n\nEbola is not airborne, Dame Sally assures the panel, and adds that she is \"delighted to myth bust\" the topic.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nDiagnosis risk\n\nDr Paul Cosford, Director for Health Protection and Medical Director at Public Health England, tells the Health Committee that there is a risk that more common tropical diseases, such as malaria, are getting misdiagnosed as Ebola, resulting in correct treatment being withheld.\n\nHe said, however, that there is \"a clear algorithm for diagnosing Ebola\" being used by NHS staff, which includes testing for other tropical diseases that might produce similar symptoms, which should reduce incidence of this happening.\n\nBackbench contributions\n\nThe floor is now open to backbench MPs. Deputy Speaker Dawn Primarolo asks members to keep their contributions to under 10 minutes, otherwise a time limit will have to be enforced.\n\nDeadline needed\n\nLabour front bencher David Hanson challenges the government to set out a \"road map\" for securing an agreement among the Northern Ireland parties to sign up to the NCA. He suggest a timescale should be set because deadlines can \"focus minds\".\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nHealth Committee\n\nThe Health Committee is about to begin its evidence session on Ebola with Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014, and has rapidly become the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976.\n\nOver 4,500 people have reportedly died from the disease in five countries; Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the United States.\n\nSinn Fein absent\n\nSinn Fein MPs are not present in the debate, as they refuse to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen which is required to sit in the House of Commons.\n\nNI criminality\n\nShadow Home Office minister David Hanson pledges Labour's support for the motion. He cites a report which states that criminal gangs in Northern Ireland are involved in drugs, human trafficking, fuel fraud, killing, and preying on society.\n\nGovernment position\n\nMike Penning informs the House that the government will be supporting the DUP motion. The justice minister says he hopes the debate can convince Sinn Fein and the SDLP to understand that blocking the NCA is \"harming their constituent\".\n\n\"What we need to do is wipe away the ideology and get the NCA working in Northern Ireland like it does in the rest of the country,\" he adds.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nCriticism\n\nIntervening, Independent MP Lady Sylvia Hermon, who represents North Down, criticises the SDLP and Sinn Fein for their \"irresponsible\" position on the NCA. She claims that Northern Ireland risks becoming a \"honey pot\" for human traffickers, drug dealers and criminal gangs.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nNCA must 'operate in full capacity'\n\nJustice Minister Mike Penning is speaking on behalf of the government in the debate. Mr Penning - a former coalition minister in the Northern Ireland Office - says it is vital for the NCA to be able to \"operate in full capacity\" in Northern Ireland.\n\nConcerns\n\nSinn Féin and the SDLP, worried about the NCA's accountability, blocked a move to allow the body to operate fully in Northern Ireland.\n\nGregory Campbell tells MPs there is an \"onus\" on both parties to sign up to its full implementation in Northern Ireland, in order to fight criminal gangs.\n\n\"The net needs to be tightened, and the organisation that can help tighten the net is the National Crime Agency,\" he argues.\n\nBBCCopyright: BBC\n\nNCA remit\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) came into being last year, replacing the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. It targets crime gangs across local, national and international borders.\n\nCalls for NCA\n\nThe motion being debated condemns the \"increasing number of illegal activities being carried out by organised criminal gangs\" in Northern Ireland and calls for the implementation, in full, of proposals for the National Crime Agency to help deal with the problem.\n\nMain business\n\nThe Commons has moved on to its main business now, beginning with a debate on the National Crime Agency. It is being opened by Democratic Unionist Party MP, Gregory Campbell, who represents East Londonderry.\n\nBill unopposed\n\nMichael Fabricant's bill is unopposed and it clears its first parliamentary hurdle: first reading. The next stage - second reading, which involves a debate on the general principles of a bill - is scheduled for 6 March. However, it is unlikely to become law due to lack of parliamentary time.\n\nCross-party support\n\nThe Lichfield MP tells the House of Commons his legislative proposal has cross-party support.\n\nHe argues that a monogamous, healthy, sexually active gay man who does not have HIV/Aids or Hepatitis B, nor is having sex with someone that has these diseases, should not be prevented from donating blood. He says he wants equal rules to be applied to the straight and gay communities.\n\nCurrent law 'discriminatory'\n\nMr Fabricant argues that the current law is unfair and discriminatory towards homosexual men and says the rules on blood donation need to be changed to reflect modern medical science.\n\nGiving blood\n\nCurrently, a man who engages in sexual relations with other men can donate blood, provided he has not undertaken the act in the last 12 months. Gay women have never faced similar restrictions on donating blood, nor have heterosexual men who are promiscuous with multiple partners and practise unsafe sex.\n\nUrgent question ends\n\nThat brings the urgent question session to an end, and business moves on to the ten minute rule bill.\n\nConservative MP Michael Fabricant is proposing a bill to overturn the law banning most gay men from donating blood.
