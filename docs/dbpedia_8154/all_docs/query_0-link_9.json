        "text": "Updated: Over 120 MPs and Peers have signed this letter\n\nOver 115 UK Parliamentarians from all major UK political parties have signed a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, Rt Hon Rishi Sunak, calling on the UK Government to support a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the horrific killings. They urge the Prime Minister to support all measures to prevent further killings, which includes:\n\nAn immediate humanitarian cease-fire by all belligerents.\n\nThe release of all hostages.\n\nThe presence of independent, international observers on the ground in Israel and Gaza.\n\nProviding unrestricted aid to civilians in Gaza – fuel, clean water, food, medical help and supplies.\n\nProtecting the human rights of both Israelis and Palestinians, including guaranteeing the right of forced transferees to return home.\n\nWorking with partners for a definitive resolution of the conflict realising the Palestinian right to self-determination and mutual security for both peoples.\n\nWhilst many Parliamentarians expressed support for the letter, they were not able to sign due to front bench duties and party positions.\n\nCaabu continues to urge people to contact their elected representatives, and demand they support a ceasefire and push for the Government, the main opposition and all political parties to support a ceasefire.\n\nThe Rt Hon Rishi Sunak, MP\n\n10 Downing St 14 November 2023\n\nDear Prime Minister,\n\nWe, a group of cross-party parliamentarians, are writing to express our deep concern at the events unfolding in Israel and Gaza and call on you to support a ceasefire, end the horrendous levels of killing of civilians and chart a political path to lasting peace for the region.\n\nThe call for a ceasefire is backed by multiple UN agencies, nearly 700 NGOs globally, Pope Francis, the Archbishop of Canterbury, more than 250 British lawyers, including eminent Jewish lawyers, 120 countries that voted in favour of the UN General Assembly motion and 76% of the British public. A ceasefire should not be an end goal in itself but a chance to end the violence, ensure unfettered humanitarian assistance, get the hostages released, and begin the process for a new political reality for Gaza.\n\nThe massive Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, destruction of civilian infrastructure and killing of over 11,000 Palestinians including 4,630 children raises significant concerns as to whether Israel is complying with international law. This must be investigated. The complete siege of Gaza, which is depriving over two million civilians (almost half of whom are children) of food, water, and fuel, as well as forcible population transfers, are serious violations of international law and amount to war crimes.\n\nHamas must be held accountable for their attacks on 7th October. These were war crimes for which the perpetrators must be brought to justice. The taking of hostages is also a war crime under the Geneva Convention and we join you in demanding immediate and safe return of all hostages.\n\nIsrael has the right under international law to defend itself in response to the terrorist attacks on 7th October. However, whatever the provocation, every nation is bound to comply with the rules of war.\n\nPrime Minister, we urge you to undertake that our Government fulfils its obligations under the Geneva Conventions, condemn the killing of all civilians and support all measures required to prevent further killings.\n\nThese must include:\n\nAn immediate humanitarian cease-fire by all belligerents.\n\nThe release of all hostages.\n\nThe presence of independent, international observers on the ground in Israel and Gaza.\n\nProviding unrestricted aid to civilians in Gaza – fuel, clean water, food, medical help and supplies.\n\nProtecting the human rights of both Israelis and Palestinians, including guaranteeing the right of forced transferees to return home.\n\nWorking with partners for a definitive resolution of the conflict realising the Palestinian right to self-determination and mutual security for both peoples.\n\nPrime Minister, when you addressed the House of Commons on 23rd October and said, “hope and humanity must win”, you outlined an aspiration we can all agree on. Yet, in the weeks since you made this statement, hope and humanity feel more distant than ever.\n\nThe desperate, deplorable scenes from Gaza must stop.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCC. the Rt Hon David Cameron, Secretary of State, FCDO\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon\n\nParliamentary signatories listed in alphabetical order below.
